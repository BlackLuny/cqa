df7bf836aea5d7c83e8e3ffb0bf38d9baa	Most bones are fine to give a dog including beef bones. This excludes bones that are weight bearing for large animals such as the leg bones. These bones are so hard that dogs will tend to break their teeth on them.  Better choices are rib bones or neck bones.<br>  Cooked bones are NOT more tender, they are more brittle and will tend to splinter. This is because cooking or drying the bone removes the collegen in the bone (which is what makes the bone softer and more flexible) and leaves only the calcium behind which is hard and brittle.  There is some concern about thinly sliced bones because not only is slicing a bone not natural and gives the bones sharp edges but also the blade cutting the bone creates heat and can cause some loss of collegen from the bone.  The extent to which this may affect the bone is variable.<br>  Any other bones from chicken, fish, rabbit, pig or other animals is perfectly fine. All these animals have smaller bones which are easily digestible by a dog. <br>  <br>  Bones are an excellent source of calcium for dogs and an excellent way to clean a dog's teeth. <br>  To learn more about bones you may want to try www.rawfed.com|`|39c4d35ef5b420dbf742cb6cf8ed9f4baa	Hi Easy Rider!<br>  There is a difference of opinion among canine experts as to whether bones should be given to a dog raw, cooked, hard, or soft, and even whether they should be given at all. On one point, however, there is total agreement, never give a dog splintering bones from chicken, pork, fowl, and rabbit, (although chicken bones that have been cooked in a pressure cooker until they are very soft can be quite nourishing and safe).<br>  <br>  A marrow bone is the traditional symbol of a treat for a dog, and he obviously appreciates it. It may be too big and hard for small dogs. In fact, large breeds generally handle bones much better than small ones. Bones that are mostly cartilage, such as spinal and shoulder bones of veal, knuckle bones, and soft rib bones, are good chewing material that can be entirely consumed.<br>  <br>  The real danger is intestinal compaction, especially in small dogs, if the masticated bone has not been mixed with other residue in the dog's stomach. A small amount should cause no trouble if it is given right after a meal.Please look article: <a href="http://www.askedweb.com/askedweb/Bones_For_Your_Dog_-_Delicious_Treat_Or_A_Deadly_Snack/" rel="nofollow">http://www.askedweb.com/askedweb/Bones_F...</a><br>  But a nylon bone offers the same advantages without the risk!<br>  Jason Homan|`|AA11592942	the difference is that chicken bones splinter and beef bones do not.  there should be a difference between cooked and raw because just like hamburger. raw will cause fits. any meat a dog eats should be cooked. cooking kills bacteria|`|AA12260609	.Cooked bones are harder, more brittle and more splintery than raw bones.  They are the ones most likely to be caught in the mouth, to pierce the intestines, to set like concrete in the large bowel, or stick like fish hooks into the rectum.  All those events are bad news for dogs.  The long and the short of it is…Don't feed cooked bones.  They are unnatural and a danger to dogs.|`|520e9447abd8aef4d0b17df2b53497beaa	Raw bones are softer and less likely to splinter and shard into dangerously sharp pieces (unless they've been left out in the sun all day, then they are brittle). Raw bones can also be digested in the dogs gut. Bones are necessary to keep the dogs teeth in good condition, so even though there may be a small risk, in my opinion, the benefits are worth it. It is expensive to have dogs teeth removed under anaesthetic and that isn't without risks either.<br>  <br>  Dry food doesn't do the same job, it's like us eating something from the bakery (it is the same as dry dog food, a baked good), it builds tartar and contributes to teeth and gum problems.<br>  <br>  My family are greyhound breeders and used to breed Australian Silkies and in all that time (over 60 years) there was only one dog we've ever known who had a problem with a bone, it stuck in her upper palate. A pair of pliars took care of that and she was none the worse for wear. She still had bones after that and never had another problem. We don't give small bones anymore though, we use large beef shin bones, they can chew but not chew through them.|`|A3NpgX9Paa	Sorry I disagree with a lot of you, you can give beef bones and I do, we have a blast on rib night in our house, we cook beef ribs the dogs get the bones, they don't crack, break, or splinter in anyway, they keep tartar buildup way down so that we rarely if ever have to have dentals done on our large dogs.  They don't have bad breath, and don't grind or wear their teeth down, they love them period.  We do not however ever give poultry bones of any kind ever, they do splinter and can perforate the esophogus and intestines.  We also buy the raw beef femur bones with all the marrow in them for the same reason, won't crack!  My dogs have all had them and had excellent dental and general health.  They also love pigs ears.  Crushed  and pressed rawhide is okay, just not the strips or long peices that are rolled up.|`|AA10851621	I use the beef femur bones. I nuke them for 30 seconds to kill any bugs/germs then scrape most of the marrow out of them. To much of the marrow  gives mine runs. Never give them the T-bone bones since these can splinter. The beef bones are the safest. And always supervise them with any bone or toy.|`|e24927ac320c44b5277a8072d74a368faa	I've been feeding my dogs raw beef marrow bones for over 40 years, we've never had a problem. I mean the large leg bones, not ribs or anything that can splinter. The marrow bones do not splinter, and the joints are especially good for their teeth, they take a lot of chewing. The marrow is a real treat, and keeps them busy for a long time, trying to extract it.<br>  <br>  Raw bones are softer, and wild dogs did not have microwaves!|`|2be14aaeddfaa187fb19a7f9392bf657aa	No you don't feed bones like t-bones, rib bones, etc..these are too small. Raw meaty knuckle bones and beef marrow bones (not the small round ones but the big ones) are perfectly fine for dogs. They are perfectly safe and natural for dogs to chew on. They are good for teeth as well (no dry food does not help clean teeth contrary to popular belief). Bones given to dogs should NEVER be cooked. They should always be fed raw. Cooked bones become brittle and can easily splinter/break and can cause problems.<br>   Raw bones will NOT make a dog sick or cause worms. Again dogs are designed to chew on them and eat the meats and marrow off these bones.It is completely natural for them.|`|AA10029366	I give my dogs raw beef bones...yep, the whole kennel. All 25 of them, and I've been doing it for years.<br>  <br>  Prior to cooking, bones are softer and spongier. Cooking leaches structural components from the bone (SC did a better job of explaining that!), and they end up thin and brittle...which is why they are more prone to splintering, and those splinters end up in the stomach.<br>  <br>  Try breaking a raw beef rib, versus a cooked one, and you will see what I mean.<br>  <br>  I don't believe that ANY bones should be given to a dog without subsequent supervision, and that those bones that develop any sharp edges in the course of chewing should be thrown away.<br>  <br>  But I do feed my dogs raw beef bones -- specifically knuckle bones. They clean teeth like nothing else, the dogs love them, and they provide natural nutrition.
AA11725989	The mother will take care of them for awhile,,,,we called a pet store and they took the babies off our hands after they were weaned!!<br>  And on the flip side...hampsters have a 2 year life span...They don't recommend keeping the babies with the mother after a while...|`|Z1EPM5jeaa	once the babies open their eyes you will need to seperate them into seperate cages or else they will fight|`|2b68f0b7d55034007ed85368f740bb32aa	The mom will do everything. Just whatever you do most important thing. Don't touch the babies. Just let them be. Also Be aware that hamsters sometimes eat there babys if there sickor weak. So don' tbe alarmed. Good Luck|`|389c7ca909ed8e7d45814f58d66fe8bbaa	Congrats!  Make sure the litter you're using is either aspen, Care Fresh or Critter Care.  Never use pine or cedar they are harmful to all small animals.  Are you sure she's a dwarf and not a young Syrian since you said you've had no prior experience with hamster?  When you found her she was already a week pregnant, they carry for 18-21 days for dwarfs and 16 days for Syrians.  The only thing extra I would do is add some vitamins into her diet.  For the babies mom will know what to do.  Leave them alone until their eyes open and don't clean the cage until that time.  Mom will be protective of them so use caution in taking them all out.  Use either gloves or rub the dirty litter on your hands to mask the smell of your hands.  We use a small plastic reptile box with vents to contain while cleaning the cage.  Use only water, no bleach or soap, they can harm the babies lungs..  They are also great for the rare vet trip.  Now don't be too upset if mom eats any, she may be a first time mom and they've been known to eat the sick or weak ones.  We had one that birthed 5 and only one survived two days later.  She may not have been mature enough to raise that many also.  They will begin to sniff out food in about 5-7 days as their eyes begin to open, now's the time to lower the water bottle to their height or put a second in there for the babies.  We have a rescued mom and litter right now, we added the extra bottle and put an extra food dish as well.  At 3-4 weeks they will begin to wean from mom.  By 6 weeks you have to separate mom and girls from the boys.  The girls usually are alright with mom.  When we used to breed, we did it that way.  At 6 weeks they can go to new homes, but I always wait until 8 weeks to allow for more growth and personal handling by us.   Lots of people say that pet stores will take them, but not always, they have their own suppliers. I had one say they'd take all I had at the time (15), but they got a shippment and took none.  I ended up keeping all of then myself.  I already had the cages from prior years of breeding.  I no longer breed, but instead rescue them and other small animals for the last 1 1/2 years.|`|4c21766cd27a2c290be1bf8183e37399aa	nature will take its coarse.... congrats and start looking for homes now so that when they are old enough you can find them homes....smile<br>  <br>  here are some links:<br>  <a href="http://www.hamsterland.com/default.asp?cat=faq&con=0" rel="nofollow">http://www.hamsterland.com/default.asp?c...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.hamsterlove.freewebspace.com/custom4.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.hamsterlove.freewebspace.com/...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.petwebsite.com/hamsters/hamster_questions.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.petwebsite.com/hamsters/hamst...</a><br>  <a href="http://forum.exotichobbyist.com/hamsters/messages/2148.html" rel="nofollow">http://forum.exotichobbyist.com/hamsters...</a><br>  <br>  edit : I agree with blue human interaction is fine.....check out the web pages they are pretty good.....|`|tZAPa2acaa	WHATEVER YOU DO DO NOT TOUCH THE BABIES OR HER!

My dwarves had babies, it was fun but they just kept coming and coming!  As soon as possible, separate the males from females in separate cages (girls can get pregnant as early as five weeks!!!) and work on getting them homes... unless you want to keep them all!  It can be very hard to tell the difference in dwarves, especially in baby dwarves, but these sites gives good explanations: <a href="http://img288.exs.cx/img288/3483/sexingdiagramdwarfcustom4dr.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://img288.exs.cx/img288/3483/sexingd...</a> and <a href="http://russiandwarfhamsters.tripod.com/hams/id19.html" rel="nofollow">http://russiandwarfhamsters.tripod.com/h...</a>  You may also notice that the males butt is a bit more pointed and seems to stick out more beyond the hind legs, where as a female is more rounded in the butt - see if you can see the difference in the illustrations in the sites above to get the idea, that will help.<br>  <br>  Good luck and have fun!  They are adorable as they grow!|`|dRalNpvPaa	Congrats! You're a "grandma"!  LOL!  The momma will take care of them just fine.  Keep the tank clean, provide fresh water and food.  Be ready to seperate them at 6 weeks of age (or you will have a lot more on your hands!).  The boys will breed back to their mother or their sisters, so if you can't tell what sex they are, keep them all seperate until you can find homes for them.  (The local Pet store might be willing to take them for you.)<br>  You certainly can touch them as soon as their eyes open.  (The smell of a human is NOT strong enough to keep a momma from her baby!)|`|dX0ZIlCmaa	We raised hamster babies before Syrian not dwarf but they'd most likely be similar. It was difficult, the mom didn't like certain babies and would thought them out, the runts passed away and I'd say it was a cross between sad and happy. Suzie did most the work but we'd help out by moving the babies into the nest if they were kicked out. At one time they had mites because Suzie was from the pet shop. We took the bottom of the cage into the bathroom and moved each baby, changed the bedding and used qtips and water to get the mites off. It was worth it for most of the group was wonderful, like all hamsters they could be nippy at times but still wonderful.|`|se3F6vELaa	just make sure momma is fed and watered, keep cage clean and momma will do the rest
tZAPa2acaa	Wow, you seem like you REALLY want to breed those little hamsters, I think they must be really bad parents if you have all that and have done all that research on them, But maybe they just dont want you to breed them, You could just tell your parents to just buy 2 of the same gender, And your parents ¨^Might approve¨^, But 12 is a very young age.. especially since your hammies can have multiple babies, Yes brothers and sisters d mate! plus the Original mother and father would keep on mating, God i can just imagine in my hand all those hamsters, Eventually at the end you might be having to donate them to the pet store... So if you REALLY want hamsters, Then just tell your parents you want 2 but of the same gender, So they dont mate. Hope this helped.|`|b6ec0af9817eed2c93fae59b294e80caaa	ok, how old r u???

Unless hes bored, then he chews on anything within reach. Ugh... I would suggest getting a bit with a roller (or a cricket as its called) This allows them to play with something without chewing. I personally dont approve of Tom Thumbs because they are very severe but I think you could find a nicer bit with a roller. I would try that. Also, is the bit adjusted properly? if its too loose, they tend to chew on it as well. It might just be a personality thing too. She might grow out of it, shes pretty young, my three year old chews a little bit but I just bought her and switched bits so that might be it. One of the horses I trained chewed on the bit when I first put it on (she got over it) so, maybe shes not used to it yet.

If so, you should try and find the owner soon. <br>  <br>  (2) With time, all cats eventually settle in. It could take anywhere between 1-3 weeks before he is completely comfortable (of course depending on the cat and how old it is as well).

011025cc23dbdb0248758e7c4ae607f1aa	por el contrario de lo que cree la mayoría de la gente, en la raza golden retriever hay problemas de conducta y serios, conozco personalmente varios casos, el más grave fue el de una conocida que tuvo que sacrificar su golden hijo de campeones porque era demasiado agresivo y mordía mucho, a su hermano (mayor de edad y que convivía diariamente con el perro, lo sacaba y alimentaba) la última vez lo mordió en el brazo y en el cuello y terminó en el hospital con más de 70 puntos de sutura, luego de eso y de que el perro se volvió incontrolable al punto de morder y abalanzarse sobre cualquiera tomó la lamentable decisión de sacrificarlo, y escuché varios casos más muy similares. Yo creo que mucho tiene que ver la forma en que se educa al perro y cómo se lo trata, pero a veces en algunas razas en las que el componente genético no se cuida y no se sacan de los planteles de reproductores a perros con tendencias agresivas pueden pasar casos como los que te cuento.|`|32iBgdNOaa	Hola, yo trabajo con perros de exhibición y te puedo decir con seguridad que los trastornos de conducta en la raza golden retriever son bastante comunes, si bien hay ejemplares excelentes de carácter hay otros (y ví varios) que es mejor perderlos que encontrarlos, costaba mucho dominarlos en pista y había que estar siempre pendiente de que no agredieran a nadie en prepista o directamente en la pista.

YayhNRlKaa	Dachshunds have been very high on the biting charts lately-- meaning they are known to bite! Under cocker spaniels, I believe they had the highest dog bite rate of 2007. However, I love the breed- and I pet sit for some Dachshunds that are just great! I wouldn't say they are necessarily good with children, but they LOVE their families and will be good to children in their families. They do become weary, however, of people not in their immediate families. They may run and hide when people come over or may be aggressive... or ya may just get lucky and get a real outgoing Dachshund! Try checking out this site: <a href="http://www.dogbreedinfo.com/dachshund.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.dogbreedinfo.com/dachshund.ht...</a><br>  <br>  Also, you may want to consider adopting a mutt from a shelter... I know it doesn't sound quite as appealing as a pure bred, but you will be adopting a dog that is in MUCH better health and well as a better temperament. When mutts are born, negative genes are bred out of them... They are about 10 times healthier than pure breds, which now a days may as well be called in breds. They will also have a great temperament and most likely be amazing with kids... If you want an "experts" opinion, go to your local rescue or shelter and tell them your family living situation. They are trained to match you with a dog thats perfect for you and will be great with your kids. This is really the best thing to do for your family, and for the dog, who's life you will be saving :)|`|9JDDzLyIaa	I'm not sure if I can convince you to get one. I have had one for 8 years. Mine is extremely possessive. If anyone gets near me he growls at them. He does not like kids. I got mine from a pet store that gets them from puppy mills. WRONG CHOICE. He has so many issues and has been trained by professionals but still acts crazy. They do bark very loud. And they are stubborn. I call his name and tell him to come here and he just stares at me like I'm dumb. He gets in this trance when being punished and viciously attacks everything around him and puts holes in stuff. He has that hound odor that never goes away no matter what I do. He's a good watch dog though. That's all I can think that's a benefit. I forgot to add that he attacked my mom before and she had to be hospitalized.|`|RzZ911Sgaa	It's all in how you train them. I was raised with dachshunds and have one now as an adult. They are very loving animals, yes their bark is loud but if you train them right they will not bark much. The only negative thing I have learned about them over the years, is they all seem to be pretty hard to house train. Check out this sight it will help you decide.|`|mKqofJB4aa	they are really good dogs, as long as they grow up with kids & are around kids. if you want to adopt.. i would make sure they dog had kids around before. they dog bark. all dogs will park. & honestly the "association" you are living in is stupid, ALL DOGS BARK. haha.<br>  my ex boyfriend has 3 of them & the only time i ever heard them bark is if somebody rang the door bell or knocked at the door.<br>  we dated for about 2 years.. so i was around them alot|`|to2opyqNaa	they do bark loud but are sweet with kids as long as there treated right<br>  and with respect my bff has 3 and there kids ages are 7 11 and 13 they have had there first one  for almost 6 years they are great  but need lots of attention or they will get dominate|`|umYvT7Mqaa	dachshunds are good with their own family. What I've learned is that when it comes to other people outside their family, they can be mean!|`|024lJBZ4aa	Everything you heard about dachshunds is true.<br>  <br>  Dachshunds are hunting dogs, they are hounds with terrier personality.  They have a very loud bark, which they like to use frequently and are diggers.  They can be possessive of their people, their crate, their food, their toys.  They can be good with older children who understand how to handle an animal.  The Dachshund will not accept rough handling (from anyone)<br>  <br>  Always think about what a dog was originally bred to do.  Dachshunds are intelligent and independant thinkers, they were originally bred to bolt denning animals, particularly badger from under the earth to the hunters gun.  They will happily kill mice, rats, gerbils, woodchuck, fox, raccoon etc.  They will also chase the cat, unless the puppy was raised with the cat and even then, it may not chase the house cat but will chase the outside cat.<br>  <br>  Because they were bred to hunt quarry that live under earth, the Dachshund has very strong digging skills.<br>  <br>  To learn more about the dachshund please visit the Dachshund Club of America <a href="http://www.dachshund-dca.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.dachshund-dca.org</a><br>  <br>  Don't buy a dog because your child wants one and buying a pet as a Christmas gift is a particularly bad idea.  <br>  <br>  The question is:  Do you want a pet?  Do you want a dog?  As the parent, you are the one who is going to care for the pet, not your child.<br>  <br>  I'm on my second Dachshund, I think their great dog, though they do have their "quirks".  Do your research.|`|p7swtBYzaa	I have 5 dachshunds of my own and foster more - and I would never want to convince anyone to get one if they don't love the breed.<br>  <br>  They do bark much louder than their size would suggest, they don't dig "incessantly", just if they want to get at something, then they are terrific diggers, it's what they were bred to do - dig out and kill badgers, foxes, rabbits - these are prey dogs - hunting dogs, not just cutesy little lapdogs, though they love laps and luxury well enough too.<br>  <br>  As for being "possessive", that's nonsense - they need to be socialized with other dogs and new people, then they are friendly as can be.   Try a dachshund rescue and get one that has already been socialized and trained if you are worried about that.<br>  <br>  It's the most amazing breed there is to my thinking, doesn't mean you would agree.    Get the best book on the breed,<br>  "Dachshunds for Dummies" - bad title, great book, tells you all about dachsies.   Our rescue has all first time dachsie owners read it before we ever give them one of our fosters.<br>  <br>  Depending on the age of your son, I wouldn't recommend a dachsie for kids under 10 --- we don't usually adopt out to families with kids under 12.   Dachshunds do not like their ears and tails pulled by bratty kids and they react accordingly.   Kids have to be taught to be polite to small dogs - it can be done.<br>  <br>  Good luck, read up on dachshunds - you might love the breed, we sure do - but they are not for everyone.<br>  <br>  trixxie --- I'm still laughing about your not very astute knowledge about dachshunds --- but to say that mutts are so much healthier than pedigree dogs is downright hysterical.   Where do you think mutts come from?   A mix of pedigrees obviously, at least originally, and it is just as likely that all the health and genetic problems of the breeds that make up the mutt are in that poor mutt than that only the good parts are --- use some common sense here!!!<br>  <br>  Jamie c --- you got the poor dog from a puppy mill and he doesn't sound at all socialized - very sad.  <br>  When you claim he has an odor, you go into the realm of "impossible", the 2 hounds that have almost no odor are beagles and dachshunds.   I have 6 right now - they don't have a bad odor at all.   If your dog smells, he either has a problem, skin condition, needs a dental, anal glands impacted, or you are feeding him really poor quality food.   Take him to the vet to be checked out and don't feed him supermarket junk.<br>  No healthy dachshund on a good diet has a bad odor - just should NOT be, something is wrong with your poor dog.|`|G11IZ2HLaa	You did not say how old your son is, but for the most part they are not for small children.  They do not tolerate a lot of kids noise.  They do have a rather loud bark, but are not really "barkers" at nothing.  Another thing with kids is that there is a special  way to pick one up so as not to hurt their backs..and kids are not really aware of this.  Also, as for digging, yes, they like to dig.  They were bred for this, but they are not outside dogs at all and when they are outside, they should be supervised.  To my opinion, the best family dog is a good old Beagle.  Snoopy!|`|2kTpJdKOaa	my mom has two and they do bark really loud and these two bark all the time.  those two are not possessive.  they have  not been properly socialized though so whenever anyone comes over they go nuts.  The boy is not neutered and has bit my aunt twice but not bad.  Haven't seen any signs of them digging either.  I would say as long as you and your son can put the time into exercising them all the time, because they are high energy, then you should be fine!  they are loving dogs if you can handle the barking!  |`|XpKY04Tnaa	 I've owned Dachshunds for 17 years. First of all don't get one just for a Christmas present. I rescued one already that was a Christmas present. They are GREAT companion dogs. To answer your questions. <br>  <br>  -- that they dig incessantly, Not True! They do like to tunnel into things like your bed covers. <br>  <br>  are very possessive  Not Really. They tend to attach themselves to one person. They like everybody else just not as much. <br>  <br>  have an extremely loud bark for such a small dog. Ture! These are hunting dogs and sound like a much bigger dog when they bark. Good for Home security.<br>  <br>  The association I live in fines people with barking dogs  Where the heck are you planning on keeping this poor little guy? Mine stay with me all the time. They go into their cage when I'm out or sleeping and only bark when a stranger comes to the door. Are you planning on leaving him in the back yard all day while your out. He will most differently bark at all the strangers that go by. I had a little female once that would bark at anything that moved. But in their defense they bark about as much as other dogs. <br>  <br>  All in all they are wonderful dogs. PLEASE do your RESEARCH before buying one. Their are tons of Dachshunds websites out there. |`|9ZiqmgGzaa	when i was a child a woman about a block away had one and it couldnt wait to be let out and play with us<br>  and he did nt dig  but i think he did have a pretty good bark but he only barked when my dad would come home cause he liked him
dCONRLn8aa	That's possibly the saddest (emotionally) question anyone has ever asked here.  So sad in fact it warrants an answer.  i've personally been resposible for the deaths of hundreds if not thousands of snails in my yard over the course if many years.  I've never once considered keeping them alive for any length of time.  Though through all my murders I've noticed something.<br>  <br>  Snails are very resilient little guys.  They can get crushed but only the shell will be damaged and they will be fine.  On occasion I will find a snail that looks like I attempted to kill it yet it's shell has completely reformed and healed.<br>  <br>  I think if you just let the snail go it will be fine.  Most of the time birds are the ones killing them and a shell isn't going to stop them broken or not.<br>  <br>  Or you could put him in a box with air holes water and leaves/plant flowers.|`|pDPSaL37aa	I used to own 50-60 garden snails. I had 4 adults and they all mated and I wound up having a ton. One of their shell's were cracked and it basically died in a few days. I didn't even see it's body anywhere which was weird. If he's doing fine then that's great. I kept all of mine in a large pet carrying case at first, but then switched to a 5-10 gallon tank (I can't remember) with a good lid. I sprayed room temperature water on them every day so they didn't dry out. I had soil (bought from any flourist, the untreated kind) on the bottom of the tank and sometimes even planted small seeds (usually sunflower seeds). They loved climbing up the stem once it grew bigger, and sleeping upside down under the leaves. You can feed them leaves, fruits and vegetables. I usually gave mine lettuce, thinly sliced carrots and apples. They lived pretty long actually.|`|wbRjrV4baa	If there's shell damage it will need calcium to help it repair itself, which most people (myself included) give in the form of cuttlefish bone.

First off the Betta, Angelfish and Gourami are not gonna like each other. The gourami and Angel may be ok together but they will both love to eat the Betta's fins. Plus the angel likes at least one other Angel to swim with. All the rest of them sound fine though, that's the only thing I see wrong with it. Your not overstocked like the first guy said though, where did he get his degree from ??? lol Just kidding cheese<br>  <br>  Well maybe you got nice guys then lol. I kept and angel and Betta together for like maybe a day until I had to rescue the poor Betta. He got his butt kicked. Come to think of it, that angel beat up my gourami too ......

FNOuXXwPaa	My dog is 8years old and my partner just bought a kitten home I have never owned a kitten so I  wasn't sure what to do so I have been putting them together in the garage for the last week for about 1hr a day and today they finally started playing with each other the dog never threatened the kitten just kept sniffing it make sure you are there to supervise them while this is happening  but eventually they will learn to get along they have no choice if they are going to live together in the same house.I know your situation is the opposite to mine but it is worth a go make sure there is no were for the cats to hide and they can see the dog for the whole hour and every now and then bring them close to each other. but not close enough for them to scratch the dog that's what I did and It seemed to work for me  Im sure there will be people that disagree with the way I did it but I don't really care and  I will probably have to do it again when my new dog arrives early next year|`|3e5c9f32c95260657fe7f58b36af2eb8aa	It is hard for anyone to say either way without seeing them together. That said as long as the dog doesn't want to actually kill the cats in my experience they probably will learn to co-exist in the same home. <br>  <br>  Put them in the same room and let them check each other out. Try not to intervene unless they really go after each other. They'll figure it out.|`|pDPSaL37aa	You should have introduced them slowly. Has the dog been cleared as far as making sure he tolerates other animals? If you've had your cats first, they shouldn't be forced to be locked up in a room. This is going to make them really stressed out when finally face to face with the dog. They have no idea what is going on and they're probably really scared now. The dog should have the run of half the house, and the cats should have the other half. If not able to do this, buy a childproof gate and separate them in different rooms. They'll get to see and smell each other, but won't be able to attack one another. If the dog is being able to have the whole house, he may get territorial and think he was the first one there and may wind up attacking your cats.|`|mKqofJB4aa	if the dog doesn't like the cats there isn't much you can do. the cats will get over it and learn to avoid the dog, as long as the dog isn't antagonizing them! if the dog isn't going to attack the cats, i would let them out of the bathroom and make them suck it up, unless u want to get rid of the cats... or get rid of the dog? but if the dog is nice to them, make them suck it up.|`|cZNkJTy9aa	ill try to help ok did u hear them fight or something  if you do get them away of each other if u don't hera them fight leave them  they might be best friends u don't know life is strange  things just happen and if there good  with each other play with them i might it help|`|Zjq1yzEqaa	i have the same problem, but it still isn't solved.|`|AA11869952	You can't "make" your pets like each other.  But, just like some kids who are just meeting, it can take time.  Cats are gonna be harder to teach that dogs are good things.  If you can associate the cat with something good for the dog, though, that is a start.  For example, he can get a treat every time the cat walks into the same room.  <br>  <br>  If you can get him to sit or lay while the cat sniffs him, that might help the cat get acquainted too.

cnZlMojUaa	Most of these were relevant before my old guy went deaf.<br>  <br>  For some reason, this dog knows the word "porkchop" and he will howl. He knows it is associated with food.<br>  <br>  "Night-night" means run up the stairs to the bedroom door. <br>  <br>  My mom taught him "all-gone" with a hand gesture and when he sees/hears this, he knows he isn't getting any more treats and will go sit and be quiet.<br>  <br>  My dog actually knows what "B-A-T-H" spells. He runs to a corner and lowers his head and ears.<br>  <br>  Hubby taught him "Curly-Q" and "Twisty-Top". When he would hear these, it meant that hubby was going to twist the hair on top of his head. Twisty-Top meant a unicorn horn and he didn't mind that. Curly-Q involved more hair and twisted it down his head/back. He hated this and would try to tuck his head under anything he could find (covers, his bed, the couch, etc.) We don't do this one since he can't hear now.

Usually they all dive into crates or under the coffee table.<br>  <br>  "Where does the puppy go?" = dog goes into his crate. Only works on one dog - the one I've had since he was 14 weeks old.<br>  <br>  And, of course, whenever I go into the bathroom they all go into their crates. Why? Because the bathroom is usuallly my last stop before I leave the house. When I leave they get crated and a special treat for being in the crate.

Boy are they disappointed when I go into the bathroom and don't leave the house.<br>  <br>  Edit:<br>  <br>  "Want this?" or "Here" means I have something to eat that I'm not going to finish.

Usually it has them heading for the dog door to continue outside.<br>  All I have to say is "Pests" and they are in the kitchen ready for their dog brisket.<br>  When I was a kid we had a little terrier mix that if you said "Want to go for a walk" he would run for the closet where his leash was.

I have the most horrendous mouth, I truly do- Something I just will not apologise for. I never speak to my dogs in anger, or frustration, so their reactions are probably more reactions to my energy than anything else, but they understand that the second I say a single dirty word(lol) they know I mean business.<br>  <br>  And for some reason, 'Get your a** in bed this instant' means 'go lie under my bedroom window, wagging like a spaz'. <br>  I also can't use the 'H-word' around my puppy. I have no clue how, but that word for him means jump up and wrap your arms around my waist. Only me, nobody else. I am, of course, talking about the word hug. I could train it out of him, but I rarely ever use the word anyway, and when I do, always want hugs from my oversized moron of a puppy.|`|nYv65TlEaa	mine is,who did that,<br>  I have 3<br>  one will hide under Sofa if it was him,one will roll on its back,and hope for a belly rub,and one will put his head down,so I usually know who did it<br>  <br>  I also have a bad habit of saying Move,mommy(me) has to go pee,they all follow or are ahead of me to go to the bathroom<br>  <br>  I have to say outside for them to go potty in the back yard,and bye bye they know means the front door<br>  <br>  and if one won't stop barking cause one is hogging the ball,I will say,do you want a bath,he'll stop and go hide,weird thing is,he loves his bath,lol.he never fights me,he lifts his paws,he turns for me on his own when i go to wash his back side<br>  <br>  Dogs are very smart|`|GUIdP1ENaa	My dog knew that when I blew out the candles,hung the cordless phone on the charger that I was leaving the house.

Stop by saying 'whoa'. I have never noticed but normally when i ran with my dog ( because i own a horse i guess it rubbed off on me) and everytime i wanted to stop i would say "whoa!" and stop.<br>  <br>  2. I taught her how to "go for a run". When I go sliding I would say lets go for a run and head down the hill with her chasing after my sled. Now, when I say it she will come to my side and look at me until i start.<br>  <br>  3.Kiss- everyone I am sure knows what this means to a dog.<br>  <br>  4. Hussle/Hike- Whenever I would call them to come inside I would call "Hussle" or "Hike". Now, they know what it means ( it's basically come but in a different form.)<br>  <br>  5.Thank-you : This to them and me is a good girl or boy! Whenever ( thanks to my mom) I got what I wanted from them I would say thank-you and give them a treat or pet them. Now, when I say it to them it is basically a form of happiness and has taught them "manners". AHAH<br>  <br>  That's it I think. I probably taught my dog much more that I didn't even realize!

b3a9cb04f7081dd4a39e0319c3aa3acfaa	Corgis are "herding dogs" that were originally bred to herd sheep.  They have a tendancy, if untrained, to nip at your heels, and tend to bark a lot when they're excited.  Once they bond to their humans they are very loyal.  They're good as inside "lap dogs" but are also good as candidates for "agility" and "rally-o" training due to their ability to learn quickly, and their high levels of energy.  Because of their long bodies and short legs, they can sometimes have back problems as they age.  <br>  <br>  We're surprised that no one has claimed her yet; Corgis are generally very desirable dogs.  Thank you for rescuing her.|`|RqlPSyrzaa	I'm unclear as to what your question is. <br>  If your looking to find out more about Corgi's in order to better care for the dog, you can find tons of information online or at a library or bookstore. <br>  Additionally, you can find tons of information on dogs in general at all these locations. <br>  If you're looking for a way to adopt the dog out, try petfinder, craigslist, and even better, try looking for a corgi rescue organization in your area.<br>  If you specify your question, we can better help.|`|lzmAVkuOaa	corgis are wonderful loving dogs.<br>  they are full of energy and love to play.<br>  But can be couch potatoes as well!<br>  <br>  Heres a good site on them<br>  <a href="http://www.dogbreedinfo.com/pembrokecorgi.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.dogbreedinfo.com/pembrokecorg...</a><br>  <br>  call your shelters too see if anyone is looking for a corgi.|`|EOYVileUaa	I suppose you're referring to Pembroke Welsh Corgis, not Cardigan Welsh Corgi's.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.akc.org/breeds/pembroke_welsh_corgi/" rel="nofollow">http://www.akc.org/breeds/pembroke_welsh...</a>|`|cEerFO38aa	I would take her to the shelter - she might have a micro chip in her that would lead you to her owners.

I doubt the shelter will put down a dog they know they will get rid of quickly.<br>  <br>  Anyways, Corgi's are great dogs - they are really loving, energetic, and great with kids.

Your pet Pembroke should be brushed thoroughly at least twice a week.<br>  <br>  The Pembroke Welsh Corgi is an active dog who is willing and able to carry out his owner's commands in the pasture, the obedience ring, or the family home.

How often are you willing to groom a dog? Do you want easy to train or difficult? What about general temperament?<br>  <br>  How often will the dog be home alone? How many family members? Oldest is..? Youngest is...? Any other pets? Do you guys travel?<br>  <br>  Any dog can walk and all dogs need daily (or every other day) exercise.

It is worth remembering that young dogs need to have time for their bones and joints to develop before you give them too much walking the larger the breed the more time needed generally speaking.|`|mNBhYBAfaa	any dog is good for a walking partner. a terrier, border collie, boxer, lab, or a mix of several breeds (mutt lol) would be great.|`|iIwHwpXxaa	Golden retriever, well any working dog :)<br>  <br>  just golden retrievers/ labradours springer spaniels make nice pets dogs aswell
kWwgWSSgaa	You have two options.<br>  <br>  First if your husband still wants to keep the Akita, then sit down and discuss how much of a commitment your husband is realistically willing to make to caring for and training the junior dog. If the responsibility is likely to fall squarely on your shoulders, then rehoming might be a better option.<br>  <br>  If you can agree to work together to train the Akita then agree the boundaries that you want to set & maintain them consistently. At eight months old she is at the adolescence stage of her development which can try the patience of a saint [my hitherto obedient Dobermann decided to test the boundaries at roughly the same age, to see if I really meant what I said.]<br>  <br>  You may want to have a professional dog trainer work with your and your dog individually, until you feel able to control her. After that you could start obedience classes. What collar do you use? Again you may want to consider a half check collar, a very useful training tool if used correctly. When the dogs pulls the handler corrects the dog with a quick check, followed by an immediate release.<br>  <br>  Second, if you decided that rehoming is the best option, then I would suggest contacting Akita rescue, as they are best placed to match the what the dog needs in a home, to what a family needs from a dog.<br>  <a href="http://www.akitarescue.org.uk/" rel="nofollow">http://www.akitarescue.org.uk/</a><br>  <br>  Good luck with whatever you decide.|`|cnZlMojUaa	I can sense your frustration with this. You have 2 options:<br>  <br>  1. Rehome the dog, so she is in a family that will take the time to train her. This is the best option if you have a very deep resentment to this dog. <br>  <br>  2. Invest the time and effort into this dog by taking her to obedience training and actually teaching her to be the best dog ever. She is 8 months old and I would wonder why you would be using a pee pee pad for a dog this age. She is urinating on the floor, because she has learned it is OK to go in the house. Start over on her housetraining and only allow her to go outdoors. When you are not home, crate her. The pulling on a walk can be managed with obedience training, but it will take a commitment by you and hopefully your husband. Your dog needs to know and respond to basic obedience commands. Even though this dog wasn't your idea, you are the dog's care-giver at this point. You need to take her to the obedience classes. It would be nice for your husband to go as well, but it seems that you need to be the one in command of this dog.<br>  <br>  Which option you choose, is up to you and your family, If you can look deep into your heart and feel a connection and bond with this dog, I would strongly hope you would go with option 2 and invest the time needed into your new family member. If you honestly have a true dislike for this dog, please find her a home where all family members love and adore her and will give her the guidance she needs.|`|6UmRmaeWaa	Two options:<br>  <br>  1: Training. Sign up for classes, pay whatever it cost and really stick to what you all have learned.<br>  <br>  2: Find someone who know more. It does stink when you have to find a new home but at least you are trying to help the dog instead of completely giving up on her.<br>  <br>  Puppy classes are wonderful! They really helped us.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|9kTejB0uaa	As others have said, you have two options.  And it goes without saying that at 8 months she's going to need to be brought under control, and fast!   So you either find training classes, if you can, or bite the bullet and rehome her.  That would, in view of her previous 'bounce', be very sad, as the more homes she goes to, the more 'baggage' she will pick up and the more difficult it's going to be to sort her out.<br>  <br>  So obviously if you can do it yourself (yourselves!!), so much the better.  I think you need to bring your spouse onboard here - big time!!  Not only because this was his idea to begin with, and because he may be able to control her (strength-wise) more easily than you can.<br>  <br>  If you really decide this is beyond you, please please offer her first to her breeder (if you know where she was bred), or to Akita Rescue because this is a specialised breed, and they will hopefully have people on their waiting lists (always easier to find homes for the girls than the boys!) who are experienced in the breed, and who will know what they are likely to be taking on.<br>  <br>  Good luck - I hope she ends up a keeper!|`|Eg1G2mvVaa	I very much believe that a dog is for life and would normally advise on ideas to facilitate keeping the dog, but I am not sure this would be appropriate here.  You did not want this dog, you are allergic to it, you are not equipped to train and manage a dog of this type, the dog is still young enough to be rehomed easily.  Your husband wanted this dog, but is not willing to live up to the responsiblility, I think that it is about time that he learns what happens when he fails to live up to his responsibilities (or else you are facing 40+ years of unwanted, untrained pets pulling you around).  By rights his mum should have taught him this as a child, but it looks like it is up to you instead.  I would suggest giving your husband a month to get the dog into training and having him take over all responsibilities immediately.  As soon as he fails have the dog rehomed - he needs to learn!<br>  <br>  These are big, strong, willful, intelligent dogs who MUST have dedicated and knowledgeable owners who are willing to care for them properly.  In this case that is not you!  I think that it would be best for the dog and your family to give the dog a new chance with the right owners, and your family a chance with the right dog.|`|JM4Uiunqaa	Everything you have described is a result of poor (or a complete lack) of training and socialization. All of these behaviors can be fixed with a little work from you and your husband. The nipping is a concern, but since you are catching it early, you should be able to stop it before it becomes a really big problem. Akitas are too big for pee pads. Period. They are clean dogs and potty train easily, so I have no idea why you are confusing her by making her pee in the house. At four months she should be able to hold it for 5 hours so unless you are leaving her alone for longer than that, you shouldn't be having problems. If you are consistently leaving her for longer than that, then you need to get someone to come let her out or take her to a boarding kennel/doggy daycare. It also sounds like she might have some separation anxiety. You should start crate training her so she has a safe place to go when you need to leave her alone. The crate will be her den and she should enjoy it; feed her in it, put toys in it, make her sleep in it. <br>  <br>  I cannot stress enough how much this dog, and you and your husband, needs PROFESSIONAL training. She is on the road to becoming a very ill behaved adult with some potentially dangerous behaviors. If you chose to rehome the dog, please talk to an akita rescue. You will be unlikely to find a family that can give her the training she needs by yourselves and I'm sure you and your husband would hate for her to be euthenized just because no one took the time to train her.|`|Hv2Bk46Zaa	I had an Akita, and she was absolutely the BEST dog I have ever had. They are highly intelligent and make great family dogs. They are also very loving. I would suggest taking her to obedience training if she is giving you a hard time.Obedience training can make all the difference in the world in a dog's behavior.|`|2c844fcf526bc2b90f16b7c425e11aa7aa	Have you thought about obedience training her?  That should have been your husband's first stop when he got the puppy.<br>  <br>  Uncontrolable puppies are the fault of their owners. Tell your husband to man up and do the right thing by this pup he had to have. <br>  Training will fix this dog.   She's just a puppy who's been allowed to run wild with no direction or leadership.<br>  <br>  Akita's are not difficult to train but they need a responsible owner who must be prepared to do the hard yards.  So far your husband has let his dog down badly.<br>  Had he not come along and taken this puppy then she might have gone to a home with an owner who was prepared to do the right thing by her.<br>  <br>  If he fails this pup any longer it will end up in the pound and be euthanized.  It can not be put up for adoption because it has shown aggressive tendencies.  Neither can you rehome her for the same reason.  It would be most unfair to the new owners unless of course they are experienced with the breed.<br>  <br>  Does your husband want the fact that he has caused the death of this puppy on his conscience?    <br>  Lay down the law to him, he has wimped out on his responsibilities.|`|4b8fb7d13eab5f34e3a4f0ce4fbb2680aa	Find a good training class soon:<br>  <a href="http://www.apdt.co.uk/local_dog_trainers.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.apdt.co.uk/local_dog_trainers...</a><br>  If you take the time to train her, you'll have the best dog you could ever wish for.

I didnt care WHAT kind of dog I got, I just wanted a dog!!<br>  I was young and stupid and didnt research this dog enuff.. and although she was a great dog and very very beautiful, I couldnt take care of her. She walked well, once i got her to stop pulling (yes... puppy training classes WORK!).. BUt we have a small yard, so she needed ALOT of walks. When I got pregnant, it was impossible to walk her, so she would get out all the time.<br>  My ex did NOTHING to help me with her.. not the walking, or cleaning up the hair that seemed to get EVERYWHERE, or the mud that was tracked in because she dug up our WHOLE yard and made it into a muddy mess! <br>  I finally got fed up and found a wonderful rescue that takes only huskies, husky mixes as well as other artic breed dogs. They found a WONDERFUL home for her and we are all much happier.<br>  I would give her up if I were you. If your husband wont pitch in, then you are the dogs caregiver and therefore make the decisions.<br>  Put your foot down and tell him to help, tell him to go to the training classes with you and the dog.. do not take no for an answer.<br>  If he's truely stubborn, then tell him his beloved dog must go!|`|ceeNqETqaa	Take her to obedience classes and socialisation classes.<br>  <br>  Do you have warm feelings towards her, because it won't work if you don't like her.<br>  <br>  If it were me I'd persevere, she's still very young and they all seem like typical puppy traits to me... Make sure she knows that you won't stand for any of her naughtiness. We have a crate/cage for our pup, we give him 2 warnings and then on the third he gets put in the cage and left there til he calms down (ignore any crying).<br>  <br>  We've got a puppy, yes he barks, nips, chews stuff but that's all part of the experience.<br>  <br>  And Akitas are soooo beautiful!! It seems a real shame to give up.<br>  <br>  The other things is, your husband. I'm sure you have; but I'd have a damn good conversation with his lack of support when it was his idea to get the puppy.He needs to know it is an equal reponsibility.<br>  <br>  Best of luck to you....|`|qlECsz0Iaa	if you still want the dog and do care her about her then you should look into obdience classes, which will help with alot of her issues.  also look into crate training, it works pretty well as long as  your gone less than 8 hours a day.<br>  <br>  if you do decide to re-home please try and find the right person (not a shelter i hope) please make sure the perspective new home knows all about the problems your having.  also getting her obdience classes even if you decide to keep her maybe an incentive for a new family now that she has learned.<br>  <br>  it really is a personal choice you and your spouse need to discuss.|`|vwC7klVVaa	You said you only got her because your husband wanted her well that is bad dog ownership  You should never have got her it is unfair on her .Any dog should be wanted by all the family you both need to take responiblity for this puppy now  that you have her. Dog are very sensitive to how we feel so you are probably giving her signals that you don't want her and are scared of her. Dog need the humans in their lives to take the role of pack leader. She also need dog trainning and maybe a dog behavoiurs and the sooner the better as her problems are caused by you and your husband. You need to sit your husband down and talk to him about what is best for this puppy. I would normal say a dog is for life but it is totally unfair for this poor puppy to be in a home that it is not want respected and loved. And if you cannot give it what it needs it would be better to find it a new home were it will be loved wanted and gived the guideance and trainning it needs. I would suggest if you got it from a good breeder you conact them to see if they could help re-home it or contact a akita rescue group  as all breeds have people who rescue and find suitable loving homes.|`|AA11896118	I feel for you mate. You NEED some pro help here. Akita's are big and potentially bad dogs so they must be well trained for your and their sakes. It sounds like, and don't think Im having a pop at you personally, maybe you guys need the training too. Akita,s are fighting dogs so you MUST be able to dominate them. Once she knows her place in the family (pack) she will respond to you better. Try the kennel club for trainers.. Good luck sis...|`|KHhfcMtgaa	ive just been through a similiar experience, we had a collie/ GSD mix and she was a real handful, it started off with all the things that u have mentioned and we tried to train her, but we were both inconsistent and the dog was getting mixed messages, to cut a long story short she started to get aggressive tendencies and the decision was made to rehome her.  the people that showed an interest were not suitable...working all day, no garden, not responsible for thier own actions let alone a dogs.  in the end we decided to take her to the dogs trust who assured us that they could find her a family that would suit her and do follow up checks as well,  i have to say though that i completely regret the decisions and i miss her more than i ever thought possible, theres also the overwhelming feeling that i have let her down, i just pray now she gets a lovely home - i can see in hindsight that with a bit more patience and a LOT more tarining things could have been a whole lot different - im just so sorry she had to suffer the trauma of being re-homed in the first place.  My bf wants us to get another dog but i just cant, i cant replace her like a toy, we made mistakes and its ended up with a whole lot of heartbreak.  i am now in the process of fostering dogs to gain confidence and experience with these beautiful creatures|`|uJES9DrYaa	akitas are alot of trainig and it is a verry big dog biger than Dobermans they need lots of trainig and you should start with that right away tright to fing a responcible akita breeder they will help you in some things you need to know akitas also need a firm hand and you should talk to a dog trainer also, you should reserch the breed imedialty you should have done that before geting the puppy so please get online and reserch the breed find a responcible breader that knows what he is taking about try to know the most about the dog breed, try to talk to your husband and tell him that its his dog and he should be helping you take care of it if he dosnt then try to do asmuch as you can for the dog if you succed then akitas can be the best dog you can have. If you dont then take it to a dog shelter. <br>  <br>  hopes this helps keep me updated

Some other thots are do u have a good friend who knows your dog really well that would sit for u?  Also have u thot about taking your dog to a kennel?  Have u thot of taking your dog with u on vacation?  Dogs like to go on vacation too. Just some ideas.  Good luck!
3IXDx9nhaa	RSPCA has an animal shelter at Yagoona. (See website below for volunteer work.) I think the best place for work experiece in Sydney to do with animal care would be Vets.  Write up a letter requesting work experince with Vets in your area and close by.  Make sure you include;<br>  -Why you want to do work experience with animals &<br>  -Dates, days and hours you can work.<br>  Your daily chores might be things like washing and hanging out bedding, cleaning etc. which might not seem too exciting but the idea is to put you into the work environment and give you tasks that you can manage and to give you a feel for the job.|`|c59aa0746b771ce4755726e1da6772d1aa	Animal welfare league has two shelters in Sydney<br>  <a href="http://www.animalwelfareleague.com.au/branches.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.animalwelfareleague.com.au/br...</a><br>  good luck.

Why did you allow your dog to run around? I would say it is  irresponsible to let dogs run around and run into neighbor's yards. It sounds like your neighbor does not want your dog to be in their yard. It is their yard, not yours. Please keep your dog contained. Now, you need to take your foo foo dog to the vet. <br>  <br>   I will bet you the next time you let it run around freely, your neighbor is going to poison your dog. Please be a responsible owner and keep your dog contained. Don't let your dog get into neighbors' yard. I hate when strange dogs come into my yard because I never know if they are going to cause fighting with my two intact males.<br>  <br>   I had a issue with my pervious neighbor who kept letting her lab coming into my yard. I had called animal control many times and talked with her many times. One day I just had it enough and took her dog to the animal control and dump there.|`|U69ofDvaaa	Wash him off. Get it off. It can hurt him.<br>  If he seems lethargic or is acting differently for 24 hours, get him to the vet. Make sure he didn't accidently ingest any spray.<br>  <br>  Unless you don't have proof that a certain someone did it, you can't really do anything.<br>  <br>  Next time keep a closer eye on your dog. Don't let him run loose, if that's what happened.|`|I38WF5aFaa	Report it to the cops.  Paint on the dog's fur won't do any harm.  The solvents to clean it are more harmful than the dried paint.  If he was sprayed in the eyes it could cause irritation.  Watch for symptoms.  Inhaling the mist can irritate his lungs and nasal passages but there isn't much you can do about it.  Let his body flush it out.  Pay attention to your dog for signs of problems and don't let him wander around loose any more.|`|taLD45Sqaa	If you kept him on your property and away from people who don't love dogs like we do then this wouldn't be a problem!

Legally you can't do anything if you don't know who did it.
wsLngQ8oaa	Well depending on how big your cage is, it could be as simple as holding the cage on your lap. When I was in college I used to have a hamster, and always took him with me when I went home. I now move about 4 hours away and he'd made that trip a couple times too. He's gone now yes but he lived about 3 years, lived in 3 different places, and traveled a lot and he was fine. I only had one bad experience with him traveling and I had him in his ball, and he got sick. you're only doing 15 min you'll be fine|`|EdN7fkTgaa	You should get a small traveling cage like this:<br>  <a href="http://www.petsmart.com/product/index.jsp?productId=2753313" rel="nofollow">http://www.petsmart.com/product/index.js...</a><br>  Or this:<br>  <a href="http://www.petsmart.com/product/index.jsp?productId=2753615" rel="nofollow">http://www.petsmart.com/product/index.js...</a><br>  <br>  You can take a piece of tissue and wet it for your hamster to lick during the journey if she is thirsty. You can take her out occasionally but don't do it to many times as she can jump of your hand and hide in small area's in the car. You must bring some hamster food for her to!Hope this helps!GOOD LUCK!|`|fa3395ec50c737646f26f5ca2e0c0af1aa	That shouldn't be too long a drive for a hamster.<br>  Just watch out for drafts, (so hammie won't catch cold)<br>  and depending how hot it will get, the temperature inside the car as well. (so hammie won't overheat)|`|IYd6bw7Gaa	I had hamsters in my dorm with me and brought them home with me on extended visits home.  It was an hour and a half drive.  The hamsters were fine every time. However, as a precautionary buy either Wet Tail Drops or Dri Tail as a preventative.  The car ride can be stressful which can cause wet tail.  I would put the drops in her water for the entire 2 weeks and for a few days after you're home.  Also it comes with a dropper so you can orally give her the drops since it gets so diluted in the water.  Any signs of stress or a dirty bottom increase the dosage... you cant overdose on that stuff.<br>  <br>  Have a great trip!|`|MbUXTe0oaa	You can get a travel cage for her so you don't have to hold the bigger cage. Then when you get to where you're going you can just resume caring for her as usual (be sure to bring food and extra bedding).|`|40IUKsC2aa	just put some extra bedding on the cage and she will be fine.<br>  and make sure the cage ain't moving that much.|`|sQHfnMEqaa	She might, but worse, you'll have to take care of her for TWO weeks. That means you'll need to wash the cage there and feed her... etc. <br>  <br>  I would rather leave her at home if I were you. It'll make you sad, but you won't have to deal with the feeding/cleaning etc.|`|xHxKDQ80aa	I have moved three hours with two dwarf hammies in the car. They just slept the whole way or ran in the wheel. Make sure they don't over heat or get too chilled, and only fill the water bottle halfway so it doesn't slosh around all over the bedding.<br>  <br>  Good luck :)|`|AA11767283	well...actually its your choice. if you want to bringyou hamster then ring her. my brother had an assembly and it was a 30 minute drive so i i wanted to bring my hamster so i brought it! she was fine afterwards|`|pWsbbQ7eaa	You have to be careful so she doesn't fall somewhere. That's my main concern. Other than that, you should take her with you!

I really miss her still, she was very old. But I swear she was passive aggressive. When something she did not like was going on in the house, like company, she left protest vomits in the walkways of the house. She threw up so much we took her to the vet, nothing wrong. I seriously think she was bulimic, LOL!<br>  I really miss her!<br>  Blessings!|`|4HUZJdVNaa	Cats they are very smart and bright and cats do know that carpets<br>  are hard to clean and why they decide not to barf on floors|`|DArAz67Caa	cats do not know any better-----anyhow-----I recommend buying your cat some laxative-----it can help ease hairballs----learned this from my husband--|`|7mhRDbvsaa	cuz they don't like the hard floor<br>  <br>  your not a cat so why are you in this section??|`|qy0whHiCaa	It's hard to understand the mind of a cat really because they are not from this world. Cats first showed up on earth about 7000 years ago to take over the Earth. However, there was a small group of the little buggers that saw there was some potential in humans and got the destruction called off. Over the centuries they have watched us and helped us indirectly to avoid total self destruction by our own hands. They do still continue to transmit reports back to the mother ship on a daily basis. <br>  <br>  As for yaking on the carpet, it could be that you just have a very @ssholeish cat on your hands. Hope this helps hawt stuff!!!!|`|5XYlHv6Paa	I've had my cat for 13 years, and he has thrown up on the carpet 90% of the time. One time, I caught him in the act and carried him while pre- throwing up to the wood floor. <br>  <br>  Once when it was on the wood floor I stepped on it without my glasses on and slid. I would rather have him done it on the carpet that time.|`|APiKyN3qaa	lol I have 3 cats and one of them threw up in my bed yesterday then I woke up and found 2 huge piles in the living room carpet.<br>  <br>  I guess they didn't like the friskies chunky chicken. needless to say I only gave them 9 lives dry food that morning.<br>  <br>  but cats dont know any better|`|8aW6f0Byaa	My old cat just used to sit on the kitchen tile at the edge of the living room, and quite seriously LEAN OVER on to the living room carpet to puke.<br>  <br>  It's either pure spite or not splashing on their feet.  I don't know, but it amazed me every time she'd do this.|`|P0WyZU8Uaa	It feels more like grass to them.  Cats will eat grass to settle their stomachs too.<br>  <br>  I know what you mean ... it's really irksome to have to clean it off the carpet or rug and furniture too.|`|83zdE9rTaa	Cats are so smart  they don't want it to bounce or create a swamp at their paws.   Or something in the carpet makes them throw up to start with?|`|WWybNcWEaa	because they hate  Jesus|`|KXQVRQdjaa	They are driven by the almighty force of Murphy, whose law has dictated that the universe make life as annoying as possible.<br>  <br>  Perhaps they are tempted by Basement Cat?<br>  <br>  Actually, I have an exceptional kitty cat.  She always moves to the tile before she tosses her cheezburgers.  <br>  <br>  Try feeding them grass to make them upchuck less often.
23a9a397ca0d0ff6f0dae262ba570eecaa	This is normal for a 6 month old pup,don't fret too much about it. Don't even consider surgery. Wait a couple of months and the ears will look just fine. I bet your pup is either teething or just finishing teething. Wonky ear is more prevalent during teething.|`|nlMfJtxcaa	It's too late to do anything even if you wanted to. The ear cartilage "sets" right about when the dogs are teething. If you'd caught it before you could tape one ear or the other so that they'd both either stand or flop, but that time has passed and your dog's ears are how they are.|`|Bw18seFqaa	leave her ears alone.. its cute and gives her character.  At 6 months, the cartilidge in the ears is already formed or forming, and there isnt anything you can do about it.<br>  <br>  She wont suffer any problems because of it..  its just how her ears are.|`|fOLO4TNhaa	Haha..I know the type ;D<br>  <br>  Iv got a Jack Russell she is 6 months old her ears are crazy too!<br>  At 4 months :)<br>  <a href="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3225/2746500080_c9bf24dffd_o.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3225/2746...</a><br>  Now at 6 months (ears are still as crazy as ever) :D<br>  <a href="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3028/2869168169_0ab9fe7aab_o.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3028/2869...</a><br>  Look at those ears!!!<br>  <a href="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2029/2760496702_027f9eb579_o.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2029/2760...</a><br>  <br>  Id leave it when he grows his head and body will fit his ears.|`|yh3OBqyTaa	If you like the way your dog's ear look then you should just keep your money in your pocket and skip the surgery. I think it looks fine and it does give your dog character, |`|WGdFO8OKaa	With out surgery there is nothing to be done. My dog has floppy ears that go all over the place she is 3 and never had a problem. It is really cute!|`|c15rWijuaa	If she's six months old give her a little time.. That floppy one might get stronger and stand up. My Sasha had one floppy ear and one standing ear for about two months.. I was throughly convinced she was gonna stay that way and then one week that floppy one just stood up. So give her a little while. <br>  <br>  If not, it's be super adorable.. I was actually kinda disappointed when my girls stood up.|`|BsePBpz2aa	if you love the dog, don't change anything about her! you apparently love her the way she is. and that's how it should be, there is nothing beneficial about having ears the same, unless you enter her in show, and that can't happen cuz she's a mutt, but there's nothing wrong with that. so don't worry!|`|fVt4MaDYaa	Why would you want them the same?  <br>  <------- See my dog in my avatar?  I love his ears like that.<br>  <br>  That's the fun of mixed breeds too, you never know what appearance you're going to get!|`|mKqofJB4aa	thats mean. the dog isnt even done developing. and it is a mutt.. they arent expected to look perfect.  i dont think you should change anything.|`|Qe04KxYoaa	Why would changing her ears be the best for her? She is fine the way she is. <br>  <br>  They will be fine just leave them be.
mKqofJB4aa	either his tummy hurts from the change of the food. or he could have worms? the only way to really know is take him to his vet visit today.|`|s6b3RnsWaa	Are you sure it's not just a hair ball? <br>  Take your kitten back to the vet and remember to never give your cat milk........that will surely give it diarrhea. Also, has your kitten had it's shots yet? I thinking mainly for worms. <br>  Anyway,make sure you tell the vet what you've told us. One last thing, make sure no chemicals are being sprayed near your kittens bowls.<br>  <br>  All kittens are born with worms. Odd your vet would make a comment like that.|`|pDPSaL37aa	It may take a while for his belly to get used to the new kitten food. I wouldn't worry if he didn't eat so much. He probably didn't feel so good and going to the vet might have stressed him out. As long as he is drinking plenty of water because they can easily become dehydrated with diarrhea. Keep an eye on him, though. Good luck and I hope all goes well!|`|2GVZPDataa	ok relax  a litle bit i know its hard cause animals are kids but im sure he will be ok sweety  kittens are very reslent <br>  when you changed his food did you put small amounts of kitten food in to adult food? be cause if you didn't that it is probley why he is sick. kittens have a very senaitve bellys anytime you switch food on any animal expeasly a baby of some sort try to mix the food i is easier on there belly also you can give him no more then one mil of some pepnobiso or let him lick you finger a couple of times with it on your finger  maby two or three and it should stop him from being sick|`|gMCXXdT8aa	Eww.
9tMNpFmEaa	Quit using your sharpie marker on it.|`|qvDVgwrpaa	My cat had the same thing, and it turns out that it was cat acne. In order to stop this, you need to throw away your pet bowls and get new ones. As for cleaning it off the ccat, warm water and a washrag works. Hope this helps!|`|iYzmnIsJaa	Take him to a vet.  If part of the problem is feline acne and you are using plastic food dishes ---- you should change to ceramic or metal.  I personally prefer ceramic.  Also I wash my cats dishes every day with hot, soapy water & thorough rinse.|`|NMVGyVkXaa	if your cat has black spots or abscesses in his/her mouth then take it to a doctor. it might be gum cancer and my cat died beacause of it.|`|5aLRWAfLaa	I would suggest taking him to the vet just to be safe. you don't want to wait and find out it's something serious later on. Tis better safe than sorry.|`|4c2f3QU6aa	well, thats just normal pigment|`|nUTJYYhTaa	The black stuff in his eyes is likely discharge from a herpes virus. It is not contagious to humans and is very common in cats. It cannot be cured but the symptoms can be treated. You can take your cat to the vet for an examination and they can give you a gel to put on its eyes when they have discharge.<br>  <br>  As far as the nose, if it's hard stuff, it's probably the equivalent of boogers. Don't worry about it.
oFowogdsaa	it isn't just riding exp. that it needed it is more so horse knowledge i.e. feeding, shoeing, what to do in an emergency etc. just because you can jump high doesn't mean you know a lot about horses. So because i don't know how much you know i cannot really judge when you should buy a horse and neither should anyone else. I would talk to someone who knows your exp well, like your trainer/coach. Good luck and keep in mind you will become a better rider, faster if you ride different horses. :)|`|FLBCvJuDaa	When you can afford board and vet bills.|`|pUpPXNzLaa	To own a horse you must have the following:<br>  1) MONEY--->A LOT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br>  2) TIME--->QUITE A BIT (haha bit like on the bridle) ALSO!<br>  3) EXPERIENCE--->A LOT OF THIS TOO!!!<br>  <br>  It all depends on what you have learned in those 2 years. If you feel confident in owning and know all of the expenses and how to cure certain medical things...then you MAY be ready. Ask this same question to your trainer....  :)|`|iiNAJfGCaa	I know people who have never ridden in their lives and have owned horses for 20+ years. Riding is only one aspect of owning a horse. The most important thing is stable management. When you feel that you can competently care for your horse (and this includes ALL aspects: health, vet care, grooming, exercising, farrier, vet, etc. etc. etc.) and have the financial ability to support him/her, then you are ready.|`|RloOJ43haa	It's not enough to know how to ride. You also need to know horse care and management such as feeding, grooming, and turnout. You also need to know what kind of tack to use and how to care for it. <br>  <br>  Finally, you need to have the time, the energy, and the money to take care of a horse. <br>  <br>  You have not shown that you have these other items.|`|6GehblM3aa	It's not only how many years you have ridden, but the care aspect of things as well.|`|oHL8qA42aa	If you are with a trainer, you really dont need to have ridden at all. It all depends on the horse..|`|m9ypuTViaa	that all depends. i know a girl who has been riding for like 7 years and shes one of the stupidest horsemen ive ever seen. if you are good and you have alot of savvy, then go for it. if not, dont punish a poor horse. its a lot harder than most people think. i worked at a barn for years before purchasing my first horse, and it is still hard. ive had mine for a year now, and its still difficult. if you arent completely committed, then please dont buy one. its always sad to go past the stall that has that adorable little horse in it, but its rider never comes to see it|`|8hoocYPEaa	Owning a horse isn't just about riding it. It can also be pretty expensive to own one. You have to be prepared to groom, feed, and exercise it. Horses need a lot of care. Are you willing to pay the farrier and vet bills that can range from hundreds to thousands of dollars? Do you have a place to put it so you can get out to see it on a regular basis? Do you have enough knowledge in how to own a horse?<br>  The fact that you can jump 2'5" does not mean that you are prepared to take on the huge responsibility of owning your own horse. And from the information you've listed, no, I don't think you're ready to own a horse.|`|jzBzwBYaaa	It all depends on how much you absorbed in those two years and if you can afford one financially. Its not recommended, but you could get a horse as a beginner. You just need to find a horse that matches with your experience level. I've been riding for two years too and I just bought my first horse a month ago. Take the time to look around and find one you really want. I wasn't even looking, then the owner of my barn offered me this horse and my parents said yes,|`|x5rdxAxbaa	when you know what it takes to take care of a horse. My grand parents didn't ride until after they got horses, but my grand father worked at the zoo before he retired and needed large animals to care for. I don't think knowing how to ride has much to do with owning a horse. You need to know that it takes up the whole day to take care of horses. They eat twice daily, you have to give them hay at lunch time as well. You have to be able to afford the feed and the hay. Hay is getting expensive. You have to have the time to muck the stalls and the paddock. It's a lot of work taking care of horses, and you have to give them mental stimulation as well. My grand parents don't have time to do anything. The wake up at 4am and go to bed at 10pm and don't go anywhere besides for the barn.|`|Lylx2yz2aa	As my mum has been riding since she was small, i have always had a horse because my mum rides a lot but i started riding for about 2 to 3 years before my mum bought me my own, i know we had a horse but she 18hh and im only small :P so i wanted my own i got one of my own i was only 14 then but i really regreated it after :( don't know why because my horses are  my life <br>  <br>  But it was because i had to give up everything really like nights out with my friends and things like this, i gave it all up to spend with my horse  but looking back know i am glade i did. because them days out with mates i was not gaining much but weight [hehe] but with my horse i was building a bond which is unbreakable <br>  <br>  Back to the point <br>  <br>  i think 2 years is alright if <br>  -you can afford Feed, stable, tack, hay etc <br>  -You can Afford Insurance [BIG MUST]<br>  -Can Afford if your horse comes ill you have money for this<br>  -Time. you would give up most things for the horse<br>  -Lot of times goes into horses <br>  -If you know you can go into a field and catch a horse<br>  <br>  Most of all just riding a horse is not the same as owning one <br>  <br>  And if i was you i would loan a horse or something like that for a few months or weeks just to get you ready for when you buy one <br>  <br>  But good luck in getting a horse:D <br>  <br>  Once you get you horse the bond is going to be unbreakable :P|`|d6gE2XQ0aa	I rode 2 years before i got my first horse so I think it would be fine. But first you must choose the right breed, barn,feed,saddle etc. I have had two horses and both of them were great. I hope you find one!!!
5cYgk9FSaa	Hmmm, well I'd keep your fourplex extremely clean *for now*, and buy all the neccesary things to keep it clean.<br>  Australian Shepards *obviously being herding dogs* need room to run, so I'm sure he/she would be spending a lot of their time outside, which would prevent *some* accidents,<br>  <br>  Otherwise, I don't know.<br>  Haha.<br>  Good luck, I really hope you can get him. Australian Shephards are such good dogs, from what I've heard!|`|PM23RDycaa	*sighs* its bad when adults are doing this. Ok rules are rules and if he bends them for you he will have to bend them for everyone else. If you want a dog move into a pet friendly place. You have been clearly told that you cannot have pets. Would you be trying this if he wasn't your soon to be in law? If not then don't try and take advantage of the fact you are about to marry his son. <br>  <br>  No pets means no pets.|`|aCqSF87Raa	If you signed a lease agreement or have some sort of deal going on with him, then his rules are golden. He owns the place and is leasing it to you. If he lets YOU have a dog, then anyone else that moves in at a later date will have to be allowed a dog - he is right in that aspect!<br>  <br>  If he doesn't want you guys to have a dog, then that's his decision as owner of the property. This is beyond the whole "convincing mom and dad" stage as in this situation HE is the LANDLORD and OWNER of a building he is LEASING to you.<br>  <br>  If you guys want a dog, move to a place that allows them. End of story.<br>  <br>  PS - Sorry if it isn't what you want to hear, but that's life. Time to grow up and accept that we don't always get what we want.<br>  <br>  PPS - Aussies are HIGH energy dogs and without proper exercise (in the form of long brisk walks NOT in your back yard) they CAN become VERY destructive. They are also a shedding breed. I would not consider them to be the best apartment type dogs unless you have owned in the past...|`|vouUQQzBaa	I'm afraid the dad is correct.<br>  <br>  Allowing you to have a dog will cause havoc with future tenants.  Think of his situation as well.<br>  <br>  I know, I feel for you. I couldn't do without my dogs. But you can't force a person to deal with possible consequences (not to mention financial problems). Just because YOU will take care of your apartment, doesn't mean others will.|`|jeyLZLDGaa	Offer to pay a bigger deposit.|`|AjPbtm7oaa	Grow up & cut the cord.|`|AA11244754	He's right, because how will it look if he goes to show an apt. and the prospective tenants see you
UbSJPBuNaa	you fish is not pregnant she most likely has dropsy(illness) from your description.|`|bDPVRtCNaa	Goldfish do not get pregnant. They become gravid with unfertilized eggs. They will appear larger than usual, and should be at least a year old to be sexually mature. <br>  -Separating a gravid female means removing her from the other fancy goldfish who may be a male, meaning that there will be no fry. The female will scatter eggs which the male then fertilizes.<br>  <br>  The way you describe the behavior it sounds more like an illness. Buoyancy issues are usually related to bloating and swim bladder disorder. Swelling to the extent that the scales poke out like a pinecone points towards dropsy.<br>  <br>  Never completely clean the tank. Partial water changes of about 25% weekly are enough to maintain an appropriately stocked aquarium. <br>  <br>  To figure out exactly what is wrong with your fish may you please add tank size, diet, and maintenance in a detail?|`|8vDyvxePaa	Yeah, that's what my fish did just before she died, too.  You should separate her, because a few days after my fish died (and we really cleaned the bowl afterwards) my other goldfish did the same swimming thing and was dead the next morning.<br>  <br>  I didn't have a tank, I had a bowl, but for me I just cleaned the little pellets and decorations with hot water (reaaally well)  and the inside walls of the bowl, too.|`|cf87f1aa28522c98acc4676433f4e725aa	Gold fish do not need a heater in the tank.  Change 3/4ths of the water out once a month.  If you "swish" the gravel with your hand and stur up the dirt before you take out the 3/4ths then your tank will be cleaner.<br>  <br>  Swimming upside down doesn't sound normal to me.<br>  <br>  If you think you she is pregnate then yes seprate her.|`|5n1qcXSfaa	I've had goldfish before, the male tends to chase the female so that she can lay the eggs and he can fertilize them. However, I had the same problem you did. My goldfish got chased so much it died, which is what might be happening to your goldfish. I would separate her. <br>  <br>  The temperature can be kept at 74 degrees, contrary to what is believed.|`|7ydnDQl2aa	No temp requirement for goldfish.<br>  I think your fish is sick and bloated, not pregnant.  My fish was doing that just before it died.  I hope that's not the case with you, though.
nFcl0BOsaa	Bad idea at any price. Incredible that anyone would throw $1,000 at something and not do their research first. <br>  <br>  "...The very tiny "teacup" Yorkies often have serious health and behavioral problems..."<br>  <a href="http://www.dogbreedinfo.com/yorkshireterrier.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.dogbreedinfo.com/yorkshireter...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  Edit: Sweetheart, you're not listening. Responsible breeders try to breed to the breed standard -- not dogs that are way undersized or even oversized. <br>  <br>  Yorkies should range from 4 - 7 lbs., which is plenty small enough already. Any breeder who tells you their Yorkies will be smaller than that is NOT doing it the right way, and you should stay far away from them. They don't care about the dogs or the breed and they don't care about you.|`|y0cbLn0Yaa	If you do choose to go ahead and purchase an ***undersized*** Yorkshire Terrier then be prepared for huge veterinary bills and heartache.<br>  <br>  Because of the poor breeding practices used by "breeders" when producing these undersized dogs for the commercial market, the puppies often have multiple health problems brought upon by their miniaturisation.<br>  <br>  The breeders are not very ethical and have no consideration as to whether they are producing healthy animals.  Their prime concern is to produce animals which will be marketable in the current trend of ***micro dogs***.  Therefore consideration isn't put into whether the parents are healthy, free of genetic problems and of sufficient quality to be bred from.  The only consideratin given is size so that smaller and smaller puppies can be produced.<br>  <br>  Before you go ahead and part with such a large amount of money, at least educate yourself on the problems associated with this kind of breeding practice and its implications on the puppies produced.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.wakyonline.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.wakyonline.com/</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.elvisyorkshireterrier.com/yorkie/teacup-yorkie.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.elvisyorkshireterrier.com/yor...</a><br>  <br>  There is a starting point for you.<br>  <br>  Edit:  OK I was being nice but I see that was pointless.

They are just premature or runt puppies.  Most of them are very sickly and you will really get to know your vet quite well if you should decide to get one of these dogs.  They also do not live very long, some only 2 or 3 years.  These are just poorly bred dogs that byb's but a high price tag on.<br>  <br>  |`|7BqOnBa8aa	First, "teacup" is a name given by bad breeders for puppies that are  much smaller than the breed standard. This means they are poorly bred, and prone to genetic disease, often the runt of the litter will be sold as "teacup" because "runt" doesn't make you extra money. So, to find a decent puppy in your area, that did not come out of a disgusting puppy mill, you find the Yorkshire Terrier club of (whatever state you live in), and ask for breeder recommendations. Alternately, there are toy breeds dying daily in shelters, and many many rescue groups across the nation. You can adopt a shelter pet for less than $100, and it will be as sweet, small, cute, and smart as any $1000 dog. Then you donate the other $900 to Yorkie rescue.

OxFsslN8aa	My opinion is to wait until your older dogs is gone.  A young puppy is high energy which is very very stressful to older dogs.|`|w9aR8ymGaa	Your dog is ill and (I am assuming?) going to die soon...I would wait.  I wouldn't take the chance that your dog won't like the puppy.  I would want my dea old friend to die in peace, not being annoyed by a puppy.  (obviously the older dog could love the puppy but I wouldn't want to take the risk of the negative)  <br>  <br>  I am really sorry for your problems with your sickly older dog.  I wish you peace in his passing.|`|6SeWCfUfaa	I would wait till the dog passes.  The puppy would grieve the loss too and that could affect it's personality dramatically.  You could be setting yourself up to create separation anxiety issues in the new pup.  <br>  <br>  So, I'd wait.|`|TZzWGFNMaa	you can get one but gradually introduce it because you never know how animals will react with each other!|`|uCZGZXLBaa	I guess it depends how ill your 11-year old dog is.   If it's paliative, then wait.    If it's something fixable or that will simply get worse with age, go ahead a get a puppy.  Often a pup will give new life to an older dog.<br>  It also helps with your grieving process.<br>  cjb|`|NAGiNKFWaa	Well the things you have to consider is the health of your current dog.  Your new puppy will grieve and mourn when the older dog dies, but if your older dog is sick, it can be a big burden caring for a dying dog and the demands of a new puppy.  I would wait.  Older dogs are often annoyed by the hyper puppies and they just want to rest and don't want a puppy in their face.  It can be helpful to have an older dog help train a younger puppy and a younger puppy can sometimes help with a dying dog, but this is a question you are going to have to answer for yourself.  From experience, I would wait until the older dog has passed.|`|GaL66jbQaa	Depends on what kind of ill. it might actually stress your dog out more. meeting dogs on walks is very different than having a puppy in the house all the time
EkPZBEvaaa	Platies are a great starter fish that is hardy and lives preaty long-so are the danios. Neons are a good fish too, but you cant buy paradise guarami-which are gorgous by the way-because you will have no neons left in the morning. If you are getting tiger barbs or Serpae Tetras, DONT GET guppies or swords tale males (or females preferably) because they will get their fins niped off. something to keep in mind is that if you plan on getting guppies, platies or mollies especially of both sexes-expect to find baby fish eventually because these fish are live-bearers which means they give birth rather than lay eggs. Guppies breed like rabbits but have a lower survival rate because they are so small (unless you put them in a breader net using a cup NOT a net) and many of the females die young because they breed and have babies at too young an age.AVOID BREEDING GUPPIES-its messy, and unstoppable cycle, and they a crazy amount of fish (half my fish are guppies). Hope that helps. No frogs or crabs can be kept with non-carnivorous fish-what u have- because they grow and eat the fish.|`|u1Ec867Eaa	Looks like a good list, the Tiger Barbs can nip fins though, are a little bit aggressive.  Only add a few at a time though, not all at once.  Start with the Danio's.  You might look at Cardinal Tetra's instead of Tiger Barbs, they are a great schoaling fish and are very attractive.|`|4qIzyIz4aa	what if you put a single fish that grows big when it reaches adult age (about 24 inches or more). it's more fun and challenging! i suggest a Pangasius Sanitwongsei or an Arowana!|`|OaaJ7o9Haa	That's a 29 gallon tank. I don't think there's enough room for all 18 fish you want. That's largely due to the fact that tiger barbs are aggressive and will be territorial.<br>  However if you want it that way, it's your choice. Keep it clean and all is well. Those are all good starter fish. I love dalmation mollies ^_^ I started my tank with sunset fire platies and albino corydoras.|`|dE5fs9yzaa	My first were probably livebears like platies and swordtails (thar was over forty years ago..LOL) I then moved on to african cichlids and then fancy goldfish. But my fave tropical is a Harliquin rasbora. I always had a large school of these, around 15-20.|`|2qVcpkF3aa	My first fish were Neon Tetras and Cherry Barbs. Then I went to a 20 gallon tank. I had a blue gourami and he ended up killing all of my fish twice. lol. I thought a Cichlid would even out the aggression....not the case. I had to get rid of the gourami...=(. Cichlids are awsome and I would never go back to community. <br>  <br>  I like the Danios and Tiger barbs. The barbs are very active fish and are awsome|`|NwZ6yrq7aa	my first fish were 3 mollies, a black, a silver and a dalmatian.  I presumed them all to be female.  The girl at Petsmart had no clue.  A few days later the dalmatian gave birth and I rescued 2 fry, only one made it.  Another girl, she's nearly 3 months now!  Dalmatian had another batch mid Feb., rescued 4.  Only one has made it so far.  Too small to tell if it's a boy or girl.  Next I bought 5 sunset platies.  Lost one to ick.|`|AA11556697	even though the tiger barbs are cool looking they are a little aggressive...Danios are FUN! i would get more then 6... Black tetras are nice schooling fish, red minors are, if you want color add some rainbows, the have red rainbows, tourquise rainbows, boasami rainbows (yellow and blue) they will add a nice color to your tank.|`|0cNKI9fJaa	my first were 5 chiclids in a 55 gallon then added more later. sold that tank for 300 now have 30 gallon fowlr.(slatwater) fish only with live rock
wF52XMxAaa	With any of these birds, remember that personalities can vary.<br>  <br>  Cockatiels are excellent pets and have the lifespan you're looking for (though they can live longer), but they're not especially cuddly.  Affectionate, yes, but not cuddly.  see <a href="http://www.birdsnways.com/wisdom/ww21eiii.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.birdsnways.com/wisdom/ww21eii...</a><br>  <br>  Lineolated parakeets are also excellent pets with a similar lifespan.  They're cuddly, but perhaps not as playful.  see <a href="http://www.parrotchronicles.com/mayjune2003/lineolated.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.parrotchronicles.com/mayjune2...</a><br>  <br>  For cuddly and playful I'd recommend:<br>  <br>  a pyrrhura conure (e.g., green cheeked or maroon bellied - the quiet conures). <a href="http://zoologica.wordpress.com/2008/09/11/living-with-a-maroon-bellied-conure/" rel="nofollow">http://zoologica.wordpress.com/2008/09/1...</a><br>  <br>  The poicephalus parrots (decent talkiers):<br>  <a href="http://zoologica.wordpress.com/2008/09/11/living-with-a-maroon-bellied-conure/" rel="nofollow">http://zoologica.wordpress.com/2008/09/1...</a><br>  <br>  lovebirds:<br>  <a href="http://www.avianweb.com/lovebirdpets.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.avianweb.com/lovebirdpets.htm...</a><br>  <br>  parrotlets:<br>  <a href="http://www.parrotparrot.com/articles/aa031501.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.parrotparrot.com/articles/aa0...</a><br>  <br>  However, these have lifespans of 20 years or more.|`|1n1OlJbhaa	I have an idea on what you're looking for. A dove preferably a white dove or ring-neck dove. They're very tame, they live anywhere between 15-20 yrs. They are not that big, they love to cuddle, be played with, they all have interesting yet different personalities. They love playing games if you teach them. I currently have 3 and they never cease to amaze me at how much they learn, and how friendly they are. If you want a dove that's quite and really really easy to tame and get to know you then a female is what you want, if you want more spice then get a male, but the only thing is that they squawk way too much. They make for awesome pets and there's never a dull moment with them. I guarantee you'll fall in love with the dove.|`|K2QwEM4raa	Parakeet or budgie. Both are greet birds if given training and attention. I don't think any really like to cuddle. Just head and neck rubs and kisses. But I sure love my Amazon but he would live much longer than you want.|`|12VQ4ETcaa	Cockatiels are awesome.  Our bird Pepper is still around and he's 23 years old, so take into account that a bird may live a lot longer than you thought.|`|6VFh61jhaa	I would reccomend a budgie. They are awesome pets, and once you train them they can be very entertaining.|`|m1ypmbNKaa	I would highly recommend a cockatiel and If you are going to get a cockatiel, I think it would be fairly wise to know what they are first! This will give you an idea on if you want this bird or not, and a idea on what this bird is like. Remember, not all birds are the same, this is just in general!<br>  <br>  Cockatiels are small/medium sized birds, bigger than a budgie but smaller than a Quaker (Monk) Parrot. They are the ideal bird for families with small children, or people that don't like larger birds and want a vocal one that you can handle. They are very popular in the US (United States), and are actually the second most popular after the budgerigar (budgie). They are hook-bills with a large variety of colors and a crest, commonly known as a 'mohawk'. Because of their small size, cockatiel care and taming is easier than other bird species. They can copy (mimick) speech, but they are hard to understand. However, they can be taught to whistle and whistle tunes. They can easily charm you when the mood hits them. <br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  * JUST SO YOU KNOW (JSYK):  Finches, Canaries, and other small birds like that are not considered 'pet' birds. They are considered decorations in those small fancy cages. Finches are there for their cuteness, and chirps, while Canaries are known for their beautiful colors and marvelous singing. They are not touchy-feely birds, they are meant to be cage-bound and to stay in cages and to never be let out. If you want a bird you can handle, these are not the birds for you!|`|sWkcLzJtaa	Budgies, also known as parakeets, are a very good breed for beginners. I own 2 budgies, male and female. they are cuddly, fun, and love to be played with as long as you start hand taming it about a week after you buy it. You probably want a male cuz females have a way less ability to talk(if you care), theyre bites hurt more, and they are more territorial. Also make sure to research a lot on the breed of bird you get. Good Luck!|`|TfuFjTMQaa	They're are many small friendly birds. The best ones are budgies, canaries, love birds and finches.I personally love budgies they are cuddly and fun. They also learn tricks, but not as fast as love birds. Budgies talk though. Canaries make a lovely sound. Finches are quite boring to be honest.|`|nHp8zzkjaa	Love birds, they are cuddly and love to play. they live in the range that you want and they come in a wide variety of colors.|`|u45B1OYiaa	well, a parakeet is always a safe beet, or a cockatoo! get a boy, they talk eaier, cuddle more, and easier to bond with.|`|o3nNm1iAaa	Hi!<br>  <br>  Good starter bird would be a cockatiel or a parakeet(budgie). Do you like small birds or medium sized birds? I can come back later and edit this:)|`|Qas05nZraa	finch

Make sure you keep him in a warm room after his bath until he is properly dry. If you start at the tail and work your way up the body he wont shake as much as they shake from the head down! Put an old towel in the bottom of the bath to stop him from slipping Wear a swimming costume as you will get as wet as he is :D Be very careful not to get water in his eyes or ears. When you have finished, give him a good rub down with a clean old towel and give him a good brush when he as dried off.|`|KoaNr1x5aa	yes just use a mild shampoo make sure he is rinsed well and dried well|`|sR1cHYmnaa	I agree with everyone else.

You're going to have to spend about 200.00-300.00 getting two gliders because they are colony animals, that is unless you want to spend 3 hours a night with a single. A cage that is AT LEAST three feet tall and two feet wide which is around 200.00 store bought, 100.00 if you build it yourself. They have a very specific diet of fruit, veggies, and protein and they must be fed every night. Not to mention finding a cheap exotic vet that won't charge you a arm and leg. <br>  <br>  They do tend to mate a lot and uncontrolled mating can lead to health problems, incest, and cannibalization, so it's best to neuter. I would do a lot of research before getting a pair, but I promise if you do end up getting some you won't be let down. I've had mine a long time and I couldn't imagine being without them.|`|8GeNdCsIaa	well lets start with is it possible to get them in canada. yes it is. you need to find a really good breeder. do some good research on the sugar gliders so u know what ur in for. if u find a good breeder they will have hand raised them. you need to play and hold ur glider daily as they love to be held and be around ppl. if u ignore them they can turn nasty. you would need a large cage that has very small holes or they can escape.  you need to find out wat they eat. most tiems they are fed fruits and veggies. the cage should be cleaned if not daily every other day. if u got a male and female yes its very likely they would have babies.|`|d2vTHGHBaa	they dont play with you <br>  <br>  they stink really bad like horrid decaying death, disgusting!<br>  <br>  we had 2boys and 2 girls we had them in 3ft wide cage 2 1/2 feet high, they killed each other and never had 1 baby, they make the weirdest noises at night they eat worms and crickets<br>  <br>  i think ppl bred them just for the money i dont think they are pets they are very unhappy if you want something that might one day love you back i might suggest a ferret and gliders are about 100 bucks a piece
vgWqUcobaa	Find something really yummy that your mouse likes.  Only give it to him from your hand.  Be patient with him, just put your hand in with the treat on it.  Start with the treat on your fingers and let him just grab it and run.  Do that for a few days then start putting the treat further and further back on your hand.<br>  <br>  It is going to take time and patience, but once he starts coming for his treat, start gently calling him by name.  When the 'big friendly hand' is known for giving treats and is no longer a threat he should start spending more time on it (yeah, at first looking for more treats :), but what the heck...it works) and eventually climbing up your arm.<br>  <br>  Always make sure where you are handling your mouse is someplace safe and secure so he isn't startled and jumps from your hand only to escape or get hurt.  It's a good time to put the cage/aquarium on the floor when you want to handle him, especially until you are sure he feels safe and secure.|`|Do7DFmXXaa	you leave your hand in for an hour? wow.<br>  <br>  anyway, the way you should usually pick it up is by letting it sniff the back of your hand, then pick it up so it's head is facing towards your wrist, and don't delay when you do it. the mouse may wriggle a bit but should be fine once you have it out.|`|AHW7HBD3aa	show him that you love him
zTsr6t7laa	try mixing his kibble with wet food, something with lots of juicey gravy...<br>  or wet food on it's own.  <br>  If that doesn't work, cook.  A lot of people feed there dogs the same food they eat (minus the junk food of course), Rice, with chicken or ground beef and some healthy veggies like green beans and carrots is good.  even potatoes and ground beef.<br>  <br>  Another things dogs really like is a raw egg on top of their food, or some cheese.|`|XMk53TPtaa	It's possible that your dog has allergies to certain dog foods and one or all of them have upset his stomach. My dog, a bull terrier, is allergic to grain fillers such as corn, wheat, rice and so forth. I researched it and found a great allergy free food called: Natural Balance by Dic Van Patten. If you have a Petco near you, they usually carry it. It's actually USDA approved for human consumption because they use no meat by-products or waste meat.|`|XljFNvGGaa	You could try putting a little meat broth on the dog's kibble. I make my own dog food and my dog looks and acts so much better! She was shedding like she was dying but my homemade dog food cleared it up. She loves it so much that she absolutely inhales it.<br>  Here is my recipe:<br>  4 chicken hindquarters<br>  1 cup brown rice<br>  1 cup barley<br>  2 lbs of frozen mixed vegetables (I avoid corn- she's allergic to it.)<br>  <br>  Put all the ingredients in a large crockpot with 3 cups of water. Cook on low until the chicken is very tender. Cool. De-bone chicken and chop the rest of the ingredients (include the chicken skins) or put it into a food processor in small batches. Freeze in 2 or 3 serving containers or indiviual baggies. I feed my 10 pound dog 2/3 cups everyday. This makes enough dog food to feed a 10 pound dog for about 3 weeks. I also give her about a 1/4 teaspoons of finely ground egg shells mixed in with her food to provide calcium and phosphorus.|`|gLefTs2xaa	My bet was hes been given a lot of options including human food and learned if I don't like it I will get something else...<br>  <br>  Pick a good quality food. Stick to it. If hes learned bad habits it will take time but he will learn, Youdidn'tt say what age he is or how long you had him but if a puppy feed 4 times a day, put food down, after 15 minutes pick up whats left, anddon'tt give more until next meal. I know that can sound harsh but he will learn to eat. If trying just dry food, sometimes using a spoonful of canned and mixing it in will help him like it better, but same thing, after 15 minutes pick it up. <br>  As he gets older, you will go to feeding three times a day, adults generally eat once a day or twice a day, follow your vets advice on that. <br>  Most important is to not give people food EVER while he learns to eat his food, and not to keep switching food out.
x3RBy8Ljaa	Check of urinary infections, that could be the problem.  Have you change litters lately?  If she poops in it and pees somewhere else maybe you should try putting two litter boxes.  My cats poop in one and pee in another.|`|lpllr9MDaa	I had the same problem and was about to get rid of my cat.  I had tried everything.  A friend told me about a cat litter that has additive in it to make it irresistable to cats.  It's called Dr. Elsey's Precious Cat.  It worked like a charm.  Our vet had given us some powder from the same company to sprinkle in the box, but it didn't work as well.  Our local grocery store carries it, it's in a blue plastic bag.  I still use it, I'm afraid to switch to another brand or she will go back to peeing everywhere.  My cat is 8 years old, too.  We've had her for 2 years, she was my mom's cat.  To my knowledge, there was no peeing problem before we got her.|`|s2F6pK9Xaa	We had the same problem with an abused cat that my husband and I took in from the moment she arrived.

We had her tested for a urinary tract infection and sure enough that was the problem.<br>  <br>  We gave her two weeks of antibiotics to clear the infection. Also, we found that once she was using the litter box, she would often miss. There would be a trail of cat pee from the box on the basememt floor. So on the vet's suggestion, we bought a large rubbermaid box like the kind you would use for under-the-bed storage...and filled it with the good clumping litter- the expensive stuff. This worked SO WELL! it's big enough that she can get her tubby self into it now and actually keep her business in the box too. I would recommend trying it.|`|AA11654482	Your cat doesn't know it's a litter box. Cats usually use a litter box which has a lot of saw-dust in it. They sort of get to know that it's a litter box.|`|u7Dy2qOkaa	One problem might be that she isn't fixed. She's probably spraying everything so it's her property now. Once you get her fixed and just show her where the litter box is she should be fine.
d8ZiGRPGaa	This is probably going to be an unpopular answer but use a choker chain and when they pull, yank hard on it.     No, it's not the most humane/pc/warm and fuzzy way to handle it but it's effective.  Make sure when they are walking well beside you that you reward their good behavior.   |`|PTwkiSQNaa	first of all u shouldnt be walking them the same time.u should get a time shedule and set a time of which dog gets a walk what time of the day.second of all if they r pulling on the leash keep pulling them back when they tried to go foward.|`|qnxAN2t5aa	when dogs pull it's usually because there's something they want to see ahead so what you should do when your dog pulls is stop, turn around and take a few steps in the opposite direction. then turn back around and continue on your way. it will take a while but your dogs should realize when they pull, they're only getting further from what it is they want to see.|`|iqpiEd8Naa	Use a gentle leader or a pincher collar.  I have an American Bulldog that is nearly impossible to walk and I use the pincher collar on him -- he doesn't mind it -- note: I only have the collar on him for walks - do not ever leave it on them full-time as they could hurt themselves.  I keep the leash short so that he will walk next to me.  He and I both enjoy our walks together more!<br>  <br>   Contrary to what one idiot said - you do not yell at them and yank their leash -- this sort of bad behavior will encourage bad behavior from your dog.  People like this confirm to me that there should be some sort of screening before just anyone can get a dog!  What a loser!|`|Pys8PVySaa	What i would do with my dog is that we would go out walking somewhere, she would always pull and tug on the leash. So what I would do is, not to hard though, yank the leash back enough where she come back to me. Then, shorten the leach up so there is only enough space on the leash where they have to stay right next you. Keep them there throughout the walk. If this, or nothing else, works, try maybe taking your dogs to an obedience class. Good luck.|`|Rx7wv4JLaa	Try training each one individual before walking them together. This will allow to focus on one dog at a time..then try them together. <br>  <br>  There are many ways to train a dog to not pull..the first option is to see a trainer. Here is some links to leash training option if you do not want to see a trainer. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.aspca.org/site/PageServer?pagename=pets_leashmanners" rel="nofollow">http://www.aspca.org/site/PageServer?pag...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.veterinarypartner.com/Content.plx?P=A&A=1538&S=1&SourceID=47" rel="nofollow">http://www.veterinarypartner.com/Content...</a><br>  <br>  If after attempting leash training...and I always suggest trying to train the dog first and use a management tool second..then you try getting a gentle leader. <br>  <br>  Remember all training takes time, patience and consistency. |`|4higWvgaaa	Contact a professional trainer.|`|D9zHSj1waa	I would recommend to enroll in a training class or pay for an hour of time with a trainer, hopefully they would have a method for both dogs at the same time. <br>  <br>  The best way to get an individual dog to walk properly on a leash is a little time consuming. When I trained mine, I started on a walk and every time the dog pulled I stopped. As a note, if you are where you shouldn't stop, turn and walk the other way. The dog will learn that he needs to watch you in order to know where he's going. When he stopped pulling and took a step back, then we started walking again. The first walk around the block took over an hour, but after that , the dog knew what was expected on a leash. With continued practice, I hardly ever have to stop now when we are walking.<br>  <br>  It takes time, but its worth it. Good luck,|`|22mLmAfzaa	get collars on their neckes and get 5-7 feet leeches and tie them around your waist, when they start pulling either scream at their names or stop and pull both leeches back at the same time, this causes them to listen, by screaming their names in a really mad voice they think they did something wrong, and with stopping they won't be able to move and will most likley stop and listen<br>  <br>  GOOD LUK :D|`|mKqofJB4aa	try this thing called a haltee.<br>  it goes around their nose , but it isnt a muzzle, they can still eat with it on.  it worked for my australian shepheard<br>  they hate it at first, but they wont pull because its uncomfortable<br>  seriously try it :)<br>  the dog trainer i was using @ the time reccomended it to me|`|qvUE51bdaa	I have the same problem with both of my dogs pulling on the leash.<br>  I pull on the leash just enough to get the dogs attention. Then a sharp sounding NO!!!. |`|ZnjWMOq4aa	ALWAYS remember that you are the boss. In order for your dog to respond correctly to your commands, you must be a strong pack leader. Walking is one of the best exercises to establish you as a leader. <br>  Start with a standard buckle collar and a strong lead. Retractable leads are not recommended. Use a WIDE collar, preferably with padding on it so as not to injure your pooch. <br>  Always have your dog sit and stay while you attach the collar and lead. Do not let your dog jump around or get too excited. You must always remain in command. <br>  Walk out the door first. Have your dog sit and stay inside until you have walked outside, then allow your pooch to follow. <br>  Your dog should always be walked on your left side. If he tries to change sides, stop walking, direct him to your left side, praise him, then continue walking. <br>  In order to stay in control, you should not let your dog walk far in front of you (even if the lead still has slack). Otherwise the dog is leading the walk, instead of YOU leading the walk. If you aren't leading, you aren't in control. Your dog's shoulder should not pass too far in front of your own legs. <br>  Once you feel your dog has walked too far in front of you, stop walking. Give him a LIGHT tug (this is not to pull him back, but to get his attention) and pull him back until he is positioned into an acceptable space in front of you. You should have a training noise established for your dog. A quick "tch" works, or a clicking of the tongue. This noise is a substitute for the word "no" which can become white noise to a dog during walks. Use this noise in conjunction with the LIGHT tug. <br>  You may have to stop many many many times on your walks. <br>  Continue walking your dog. As the dog stays within an acceptable distance, give him lots of praise in a happy voice. Carrying treats is always a good idea too. When the dog walks to forward, repeat the stop, tug, pull and noise. <br>  Remember that patience, persistence and determination are keys here. Many dogs take weeks or months to become perfect walkers. Your dog will not be a polite walker in simply a day. Always continue training and practicing. <br>  Remember that losing patience, or becoming upset puts the dog back in control. With you as the leader, you and your dog should get along just fine. <br>  If your dog continually charges forward regardless of your practicing remember the "touch" rule. Dogs will respond to touch. Touch him on his leg, haunch or back to get his attention if he ignores your training noises or commands. Also putting your hand down in front of the dogs face when he begins to charge forward may deter him. <br>  Method Two <br>  Use the same materials as in method one, but instead of simply stopping when your dog pulls, turn around and walk back to a certain landmark (e.g. if you're walking to the lake, walk back to your car and start again; if you're taking a walk around the neighborhood, return to a place your dog has already been before). These "penalty yards" make the return walk boring, which helps your dog quickly realize that they shouldn't walk ahead of you if they want to get anywhere interesting. <br>  Give yourself a set time to walk. If you have an hour at the dog park, you may spend all of that time walking to the park from the car. If you stick to your time guideline, your dog will get his hour of walking, but not much stimulation. <br>  <br>  If the dog is older or stubborn and the above isn't working....make him sit and stay on the sidewalk for an uncomfortably long time. Try him again. If after two long sit stays, he isn't getting the picture put him back in the house and you walk by yourself happily for 5 minutes outside. Then try him again. Be more stubborn than he is. <br>  Don't overtrain. Keep early training sessions to 30 minutes or less. End on a happy success moment. Don't end it when he is screwing up. <br>  Never put your dog in a crate with a choke collar on! <br>  Don't "punish" your dog with yelling, hitting or excessive tugging or pulling. 1) It shows him you are no longer in control and 2) it can make him pull more. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>

By the time you read this it may have already broken open when he licks and cleans. <br>  <br>  However, its not impossible that he has skin cancer.

The plants you have are mainly thin-leafed plants; angelfish do better with broader leaves to lay their eggs on.<br>  <br>  The Amazon Sword Plant, Echinodorus amazonicus, is a Rosette plant that is very popular with aquarium hobbyists. They are capable of reaching approximately 20 inches in height under proper water conditions.

zqVDJxUIaa	You haven't cycled your tank yet. This cloudiness is due to high ammonia levels. Ammonia is a poisonous chemical that can kill the fish. It is excreted from fish waste, decomposing plants, etc.<br>  <br>  "Cycling the tank" means that you are establishing a bacteria bed in your biological filter to remove the toxins that the fish's metabolism creates. There are right and wrong ways to do this, and several things you can do to slow this process (which you don't want to do). There are two steps to cycling, but you don't have to do anything special for either of them. First, your filter will grow a culture of bacteria that digest ammonia and turn it into Nitrite (which is more toxic than the ammonia in hard water or water with a higher pH), then your filter produces bacteria that digest Nitrite and turn it into relatively harmless Nitrate. However, Nitrate will contribute to loss of appetite and stress in your fish, as well as contributing to algae growth, so it is important to do regular small water changes to keep your tank in best condition. <br>  <br>  Steps to solve the problem:<br>  1. Don't add any more fish!<br>  2. Perform 20-30% water changes every two days<br>  3. Remember to condition the water using a chlorine neutralizer such <br>     as Aqua Plus (Nutrafin).<br>  4. Vacuum the gravel using a gravel siphon<br>  5. Optional* Use Cycle, a product by Hagen, which establishes <br>     beneficial bacteria into your aquarium.<br>  <br>  Do these steps, and the water will return clear after a few days.<br>  <br>  For more cycling info: IMPORTANT!: <br>  <a href="http://www.bluecrayfish.com/cycle.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.bluecrayfish.com/cycle.htm</a><br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|AA11708471	We need more info<br>  <br>  How big is the tank<br>  what fish you have in it and how many<br>  What sort of filter<br>  did you cycle the aquarium|`|xXDkTJcWaa	Get some algae eaters.

One of the biggest reasons is that you are probably overfeeding. If you have a small tank (less than 20 gallons) you should only be feeding your fish once every two days. You may need to clean your entire tank before starting this or hte cloudiness will never go away.<br>  <br>  A plecostomus may help if there is simply debris but it is not likely to make a huge difference.<br>  <br>  If you have goldfish, you'll always have cloudy water as those suckers tend to be dirty.|`|h1zWBH4Uaa	your tank could be cloudy for a multitude of reasons. what kind of fish do you have? how long has it been since your last water change? how many fish do you have? <br>  <br>  your tank could be going through bacterial bloom, if <br>  a) you just bought some new tanks mates<br>  b) you did a 100% water change<br>  c) your gravel is dirty<br>  d) you let the uneaten food just sit at the bottom of the water and it contaminates it. - you can fix that by getting a gravel vacuum, and vacuum every two weeks [depending on what type of fish you have and on how many]<br>  e) you could have poor water quality, test it. if you have high ammonia or high nitrate, do a drastic water change (like 50%) and get cycle biological aquarium supplement.<br>  f) also, if you have males and females, they could be constantly mating, therefore realeasing sperm...<br>  g) you might have a bad filter. have you tried rinsing it or getting another one?<br>  h)and algae growth. what you can do is reduce the amount of time your lamp is on,|`|zfTCpjGZaa	You haven't cycled your tank yet.<br>  Info:<a href="http://www.aquatic-hobbyist.com/profiles/misc/fishcycling.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.aquatic-hobbyist.com/profiles...</a><br>  It's very important to cycle your tank, the above link has good information.

gU34xa9vaa	Never take notice of anyone who says to get a cat declawed, they are very ignorant as it's a very cruel thing to do to a cat. You may be in a country where it's banned anyway, it will soon be banned everywhere and then the people who advise it will have to think again.<br>  All you need are scratching posts and pads around the house and each time your cat claws the carpet, just gently lift him to one of these. He's still just a kitten at 8 months old so he will grow out of this in time anyway.|`|Rw7gi86Naa	A cat needs to scratch, that's natural behavior and should not be punished at all!  Sometimes though, this behavior can interfere with our lifestyle and we don't want our best sofa or newly fitted carpet being used as a scratching ground.  Cats scratch to keep their claws in good shape.  Layers of the claws are shed and underneath sits a new and sharp nail which provides the best protection possible for self-defense.  Scratching is also a form of territory marking.  Every time a cat scratches, it leaves its personal scent behind.  Small glands between the toes make that possible.  You can watch how a cat stretches itself while scratching.  This helps to keep the muscles in its legs, back and paws in good health.  The claws act as a sort of anchor, and are buried into the surface of the scratched item.<br>  <br>  Most common types of damage are scratched furniture, ripped carpets and shredded wallpaper.  You want to eliminate the problem before it occurs.  Buy or build a stable, tall scratching-post, right from the start.  Here are some tips to do it right: If your cat is scratching your furniture or rugs, here is some advice on training them to use a scratching post:<br>  - The post should be at least two feet high, covered with sisal-rope, (mine like the carpeted ones)<br>  - Get more than one, especially when you have a multi-cat household <br>  - Place the post close to the furniture or other areas which are most at risk <br>  - Introduce a new scratching-post with some catnip sprinkled on its surface.  Cats love that and it’s more attractive to them <br>  - If your cat starts scratching the "wrong" object, say "NO" and gently carry your cat to the desired post.  Demonstrate how to use it by scratching the post with your own nails.  If the cat doesn‘t catch on after trying this repeatedly for a few days, gently pick up his paws rub them along the post.<br>  - Never force your cat.  When it starts scratching the post by itself, make sure you use verbal praise with a rewarding treat and plenty of affection.  The cat needs to know that using the scratching post results in positive things such as affection, playing and treats.<br>  - When you have a kitten, start early with the "pawing at post" technique <br>  - Invest in what’s called a “cat tree” which acts also as a leisure area for your cat.  Different textures and heights make it more interesting, you perhaps want to build it yourself <br>  - Try some repellent like pepper-dust or some commercial products on your furniture to keep your cat off these areas<br>  - Be persistent and don't give up too soon<br>  <br>  Use cat claw trimmers and only take off a tiny bit at the end of the nail. Some people say to do it every other week. I think it‘s safer to cut off less than you are told, and to do it more often, (like once a week). Never use trimmers that are made for humans or dogs, because you are more likely to hurt her that way. You can ask your vet or groomer to show you the proper way to do it. Here's a website that shows you how:  <br>  <a href="http://www.catscratching.com/htmls/article.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.catscratching.com/htmls/artic...</a>|`|WNsjy5oFaa	get a scratching post - scratching and clawing is a natural instinct. if the cat won't use it you can try rubbing a cloth over the cat and then over the post so it aquires the cats own scent.|`|5XYlHv6Paa	Whenever he does it, spray him with a spray bottle.|`|3JEQkrQCaa	going to agree with the poster directly above, <br>  <br>  one thing..<br>  NEVER EVER EVER GET A CAT DECLAWED!!!!<br>  how the hell would you feel if i chopped the tips of your fingers off.. its cruel and does not good.. you cant even get a vet who will do it in britain it is that bloody barbaric...<br>  <br>  scratch posts, toys, maybe use a little bit of spray like cat-away arount the areas its scratching.. dont spray the cat with water it will get neurotic and certainly never ever declaw it...|`|2PZwRa3faa	get the kitty declawed or get it a scratching post thing|`|sstPPNoHaa	u can get a scratch post<br>  declawed<br>  or spray him|`|3arJsZ91aa	Buy some scratch mats instead of scratching posts.|`|Fu7OK54kaa	If you buy catnip spray (I use Johnson's catnip spray) and spray it over your cat's scratching-post, he'll love it! And it encourages cats to scratch so spray it where you want the scratching. When he scratches the carpet, keep a bottle of water nearby and spray him when he starts and he'll learn eventually!<br>  <br>  ALL 9 cats love the catnip!!!

Some young puppies if money is an issue, can heal with bandaging alone, the leg would never be the same again though.  It would also mean many visits to the vet and would probably cost up to $800.  Pinning would be the best option which varies in price from clinic to clinic and it depends if a specialist does it, it would be alot more.  But ballpark figure $1500-$2500 depending on size of the dog as well.|`|3O6CTb3saa	The best way to tell that is to call several vets around the area and see how much they charge as each vet is little different in price and if they would need to do more while in there doing surgery.  But shop around and see what u can come up with for prices.  Usually the secretary can tell u all the prices.  hope this helps.|`|x5rdxAxbaa	it depends on if there is anything else wrong other than just the broken leg. Like a torn ligament.

There is like this cube thing that the pet store sells, you put treats inside and the dog has to figure out how to get them out. My smooth Collie loves that kind of stuff! Also, depending how puppy she is, make sure you have plenty of chew toys for her teeth.

W6FDz7C4aa	I used to be a vet technician. My advice would be to get soft food and see if he'll lick that up. You might just need to take him to the veterinarian. He might have some hidden sickness that is really hard to detect without testing. Just feed him the soft food and if that doesn't work take him to the clinic!! I hope he makes it!! =[|`|VMY7No0eaa	TAKE HIM TO THE VET AND quit guessing what is wrong.<br>  If it is kidney problems or something similar your cat can die.|`|Y8ssQvCKaa	Have you taken him to a vet?<br>  <br>  You need to if you haven't- and I'm assuming you're not- because they can give you medication to make him better, and suggestions on how to keep him eating.|`|31b9d943eeebee817b486384aaf5dc76aa	What did the vet say is the problem?<br>  <br>  You might have to syringe feed him or consider a feeding tube until he will eat on his own. But it's hard to say without more information.<br>  <br>  Edit to add: Ok, the vet doesn't know what to do? Have you run any kind of bloodwork? If not, you need to have it done. If your vet won't or can't, find a new vet who will dig deeper. Please don't wait around on this.|`|59f093dfc2cc9473cea87692c7a50804aa	If you think you cannot afford to take him to a veterinarian, be advised that many will allow you to pay the bill in installments.  <br>  <br>  You first have to try to make him well, and the eating part will return naturally.    If he sits still and doesn't eat, he'll die.  |`|S3V65XDkaa	I just erased my previous answer now that I've seen your additional details.  <br>  <br>  What did the vet say was wrong?  <br>  <br>  If soft food is not working, try some baby food.  Heat it up so the aroma is stronger, then let it cool before giving it to him.

But that's not surprising, lol.<br>  <br>  Why I love my papillons:<br>  <br>  They're not like most little dogs- they're ridiculously smart, considered the smartest of the toy breeds. They're easily trained to do lots of things- very versatile and capable little athletes.  They're also using them as therapy dogs (i have a therapy dog papillon) and service dogs now!  They are very very funny dogs and so mischievous!  They're very people oriented and love their people unlike any other breed i've known.  They're very devoted and attached to their people and want to be with you all the time.  Mine love EVERYONE.  Every new person is an undiscovered best friend.  They don't need much grooming, really.  They have no undercoat, so a brushing once or twice a week will do.  I also love that they're higher energy dogs and are ready to go whenever.  <br>  <br>  Chis, I haven't been around nearly as much but I've known a few.  I like them, but they're not paps...  Paps are just in a league of their own.<br>  <br>  Things you need to consider with paps- <br>  <br>  1.  They're way too intelligent for their own good.  They learn fast, true, but they also need a lot of mental stimulation.  And they also need a consistent trainer- they remember every repetition.  <br>  2.  They're very sensitive and can get upset if you get harsh with them.<br>  3.  They can be barkers, but I find them really not too bad.<br>  4.  They're very energetic dogs.  They may look like a lapdog but really they're not.  They love to go for long walks and do strenuous exercise like agility. <br>  5.  They're small, so they're kind of fragile.<br>  6.  They shed, but not near as much as a double coated breed.<br>  <br>  As far as personality, I've had the whole spectrum.<br>  <br>  My two past dogs were both pretty calm.  One was the most brilliant dog I've owned.  He was just perfect and sweet and smart.  Never got in trouble.  Our other past dog was a bit more outgoing, but very sweet and snuggly and very athletic.<br>  <br>  Now, the four we have now are a mess.  Our male is a spazz, but he is brilliant and very intuitive.  He has a huge vocabulary and actually now knows what we're saying if we spell certain words.  He is toy obsessive but he is a real lover.  He's very easily motivated- just bring a toy, and he'll fetch all day.  Our younger female is a bit timid at first but a trickster.  She can trick everyone out of their toys.  she's very sweet, but not big on cuddles.  Our puppy is a hellion.  He's got the most energy of any dog I've ever owned (big dogs included).  He is always in trouble.  When he does stop, he wants to be right across your lap.  Then he crashes and does it all again.<br>  <br>  Our older female is my favorite.  She's four and she's a real mess.  She's a very intense dog, always observing her surroundings, always 'on'.  She's the therapy dog, loves everyone.  She's also an agility dog, very lean and athletic and very motivated to do what you ask.  She has a huge list of tricks she knows, and I've only had her a half a year.  She's lazy most the time, though.  She's also got a really high prey drive and is known to bring me little dead animals- yuck!  She's so fun, though and just a blast to be around.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://i235.photobucket.com/albums/ee307/Rabastan259/July%202008/jump-1.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://i235.photobucket.com/albums/ee307...</a>|`|lZhnxOPuaa	get a chihuahua or any other small dog|`|mKqofJB4aa	i have worked with puppies for over two years now, and i would recommend a papillon over a chihuahua ANY day to ANY body. papillons are so much smarter and friendlier. chihuahuas are shaky and they don't do well with small kids, especially if there aren't any to grow up around. papillons are much easier to potty train, and chihuahuas are almost impossible. papillons will require more grooming and shed a bit more  than the chi, but it is defiantly worth the better dog.
mKqofJB4aa	neuturing him will always help any agressive behavior... but you should have done it a bit earlier. any dog that is part of a pack will try to be the alpha dog, maybe since when he was a baby the other dogs showed him who was the boss, and now since he is bigger and stronger he knows he can boss the baby around, just make sure u dont leave them together without someone watching them !! get him fixed asap.|`|kd9kWB8Kaa	according to my math you let him breed at ten months.  he lives with three females and now another female.  and you wonder why he's getting aggressive.<br>  neuter him and spay the females|`|nmWztjGMaa	neuter him|`|rMzEt909aa	Neutering him will certainly help two ways.  It will make him less aggressive, and it will also keep him from mating with his daughter when she comes in heat!  <br>  Also, please, do not let him and the puppy alone anytime!  Often these aggressive dogs will bite and kill a smaller dog, all in the name of dominance.  <br>  And, now it's also up to you to get him trained so he stops acting this way.  If you can't do it, I suggest you pay a qualified trainer, because your puppy's life may depend on it.  <br>  Good luck!|`|IaXMUPVvaa	Yeah definatly get him neutered asap! Next make sure your giving all your dogs enough exercise. You should be walking them one hour/ day as a pack. You should be the leader. They should walk beside or behind you, not pulling in front. Next make sure that you are the pack leader. Make him wait for food before giving it to him. He should not be allowed on any furniture and you should be able to make him go where you want him to go. Good Luck, you just need to dominate over him and become the leader of your pack.|`|d4xvwTG5aa	he is probably just showing her that he is alpha.. my dogs did it too|`|VvppD3hwaa	Neutering him will help!  A male dog who is not neutered will tend to be more aggressive, mark (lifting his leg) in the house more, run away, ect.  After neutering him, I would take him to basic obedience classes to show him that you are the boss and the pack leader.  If you like reading, Ceasar Millan has a great books on training and understanding your dog, and also the TV show Dog Whisperer.  Good luck!!! Schedule a neuter!|`|Z3Stwfekaa	i think you answered your own question males are always protective over there girls. and are always the boss,he is suddenly acting this way as his hormone level will continue to rise as he reaches adult hood.when they have there hormones surging through them,definately neuter him and spay the girls there are millions of unwanted dogs and thousands destroyed that cant find homes the last thing you want is them breeding which he is at the prime age to do so. good luck|`|Z71ZNKfoaa	The neuter idea seems to be the popular one in this situation. If he is in fact trying to announce his Alpha Male possition in the pack than he needs to be taught that YOU are the Alpha.
0tCYtnPUaa	from my experience that sounds like the early stages of demodex.<br>  I would give them eggs in their diet as well as yogurt (not too much, diarhea on top of itchy skin sucks!)<br>  It may be caused by the food they are eating now vs the food they were eating before you got them, sometimes a quick food switch can cause issues.<br>  <br>  I use a great shampoo that I got from my vet called keto-chlor by Virbac.  I also have a spray called malaseb that is really helpful.<br>  <br>  good luck!|`|mKqofJB4aa	every dog has demodex to some extent!<br>  get them checked :)<br>  its nothing horrible, just needs to be treated!|`|f9fb186e1c82bf7349b1e14dcbb1bcc4aa	Could be.. you need the vet to do a scraping and get a proper diagnosis..

BwrSdzxSaa	Heres what I did.  Put the crate in your room with your puppy.  Your puppy must firstly be introduced to the crate.  Try luring him with treats and if goes inside, give him praise and more treats.  You should close the door and most likely he will whine.  You should ignore this.  Look away, and if he stops give him a treat.  He will begin to get that whining will get him nothing, but silence will get him treats.  After he is well acquainted with the crate.  You should sleep with him in the same room with the crate.  He may whine a bit, but the best thing to do is ignore him.  After a week or two, you should get him familiarize with being left alone.  Puppies tend to have separation anxiety and it is better to deal with it now before they turn older.  You can try this.  Have him enter the crate, and leave the room.  He will whine and if he does you have to wait until it stops.  Then if he stops for a while, enter the room again.  Leave the room, while slowly increasing the time you leave.  I suggest that the first time should be 1 min, the second time should be 2 min, third time should be 4 min, and etc.  Try this for a week, he should do fine be then.  After all the crate training, you can have him sleep in a separate room.  Try getting a baby monitor so that you can attend him when he actually needs to go potty.  He should be familiarize with the routine for a month or two.  Puppies need a lot patience, after all they were just taken from their mothers and litter mates.  They need at least 3 months, before they completely forget about them, and get used to you fully.<br>  <br>  Another thing you can do is buy a hot water bottle, although it had little success with my pups.  You  can also try giving him something that smells like you, it seems.|`|eu6UQElYaa	Ignore it.  It's annoying at first but if you cave in it will just make the behavior worse.  The next time you put him in there, put him in with his favority chewy toy and something soft that has a comforting scent to him such as a shirt of yours that's already been worn that you don't mind parting with.   We always put a blanket on the bottom of the crate so that they can burrow and for comfort, it's not very pleasant to sleep on hard plastic.  <br>  Beyond that just try and get him used to his crate and try and get him to see his crate as a positive at times when you don't have to lock him in there.   During the day keep the crate door open and encourage him to walk in by placing treats or favorite toys inside the crate.  Then when he walks in give him plenty of praise and pets.   Let him walk out when he's ready.  Go like that for awhile until he gets used to it and then progress to closing the door after him.  Continue to give him praise if he stays in without whining.  Then progress to leaving the room, a few seconds at first and move to longer stretches of time up to a couple minutes, continuing to praise if he doesn't whine.   Then come night time he should do much better.<br>  |`|9d8438febeda9f081685c3c773c13d90aa	Please go ahead and give him a blanket...But also do this..<br>  Give him a radio...You can turn it down real low where you can't hear it, but he can...The human voices will sooth him and he won't feel as alone.. :-)|`|d2b13247b0a080e166b6ef614a4f6a7daa	You have to understand that he was taken away from his mother and litter-mates only a few days ago. He needs time to adjust to you. If you know for sure that he doesn't have to potty, then you need to ignore the whining. I know it's ear piercing. Two years ago I had to deal with it in stereo! LOL. I also suggest you join the Yahoo group SPT. It's a positive puppy training group. There are a lot of knowledgeable people there, and there is a ton of info in their files and archives. |`|eDySIDPQaa	Nope, no hot water bottle, no clocks, just his fave toy and good soft sheet to lay on..then<br>  <br>  put the crate beside your bed,and make sure the pup can see you ,and you are in hands reach of the crate, if the pup can hear and smell you, the baby will be fine...this is the way, I use to crate train all my new babies and it works...alos put a large sheet over the top of the crate and allow it to hang down, but leave enough of the front open to allow, again for the dog to be able to see you and smell your scent<br>  <br>  heard the old saying out of sight, out of mind, not in the case of a puppy, they need your scent and be able to see you, then as the pup gets older, you move the crate further and further away from you, thus the dog will sleep fine without having to smell or see you..<br>  <br>  and I hope you get some well earned sleep|`|ixFbNr4taa	Buy some ear plugs<br>  Figure out his potty schedule (or use the attached one)<br>  Be Owners and not Enablers!!!<br>  <br>  I would put in a crate pad and a small blanket ( or something with your scent on it like an old sweatshirt)  Cut off the arms and slice the side seem.  It will be tough the first few weeks or so.  You will have to get up at least once in the middle of the night to "relieve" him.  Just remember - no playing - potty and back in the crate.  You said "we"  so someone should make a "take out the baby schedule" so the burden is spread around!<br>  <br>  GOOD LUCK!!|`|jwAVFqOZaa	yes a hot water bottle will help, simply because its like they are sleeping with their littermates. A ticcking clock works as the littermates heart beats. I dont know if this would work any more since you let it sleep with you.<br>  <br>  try ignoaring it even though it IS hard and i know it. I always feel like its a baby and it needs comforting before it can fully go to sleep but if you do it long enough it will probably leave you alone.|`|mKqofJB4aa	ignore him when he cries. but get a metal can and put change in it.. and when he whines just say no and make a loud noise that will scare him.. eventually he will just learn that no means he is being bad and will stop! dont baby him or it will just be harder to brake!|`|jooOlp0Iaa	I love the look of a shih tzu. They are so cute.|`|cfa88753f7600fda90be14ecd9c432bfaa	congrats on the new family member. <br>   I also got a new puppy, he's 9 weeks old.  he sleeps in a dog kennel (crate) at night. We have it in our bedroom, so he's not alone. As he was use to being with other puppies.<br>   I put in towel on the bottom, incase he wets.  a soft toy, to cuddle or play with. He whins for a few minutes.. then nods off.. the second night was the worst, as he wouldn't stop.. till we got the spray water bottle out, and gave him a squirt or two... he finally got the message.  now all we do is leave the bottle in front of his door. He knows.  <br>  and he sleeps right thru the night.  The spray of water doesn't hurt him. and he only get a mist..<br>    I get up in the morning and take him out right away. so no accidents.  Then feed him.  and then take him out again, then we eat.<br>   <br>    Don't sleep with puppies in your bed, besides the whinning, they might pee. also you might  roll over on the little guy.  <br>     enjoy the new addition..

4aAhEK9daa	How sad.  Why are you giving away?  I could never do that.  Persians are very laid back, adaptable cats. If you're the one rehoming him hopefully it's a home without small yappy dogs or young children - both not good matches for a Persian.  If you haven't found a home for him DO NOT give him away on craigslist.com.  Give him to a no-kill shelter and let them find him a suitable home.|`|VkXQq2y2aa	The new owner is going to have to have patience and give the cat lots of attention and love to make him comfortable again.<br>  i wish your cat well :]|`|t3jddE2naa	for a seven yr old cat it most likely take longer than it would a kitten. but it would probably take a lot longer if they treat the cat a lot different than you did.
NAGiNKFWaa	I would think with a small puppy like that you would still be feeding 3 times a day, maybe cutting down to 2 times a day.  Baby teeth come out around 4 to 6-months-old.  Trade your fingers for toys, bones, carrots something so it can teethe on.  Here are some tips, use what helps.   I use a crate* to potty train with, but only for potty training and then I break it down and store it.  I put blankets and a small food and water dish in the crate.  Dogs don't potty where they eat and sleep.  When they are first little, I only expect them to hold their potty for 4 hours, and then 6 hours, then 8 hours and so on.  So when they are first little, I set a timer or alarm clock to wake myself up at night to take them *out.  I only allow my puppy in the bedroom* or the living room, only one room at a time.  They have to graduate to more space.  If I allow them to have full run of the house, it will overwhelm them.  I take them out the same door each time.  I tie a dinner bell to the door handle.  Do not use a jingle bell as they could get their toe caught in it.  So when they are little, I ring the bell for them, and then open the door to go *outside to potty.  When they get bigger, I take their paw and whack the bell and open the door to go potty.  Eventually getting to the place where the puppy will ring the bell and let me know when they need to go potty.  Dogs want to please you, so it is your job to let them know what behaviors please you and what doesn't.  So when my puppy goes potty, I give her a treat*, and clap, and make a fuss and praise her.  So she learns that going potty outside makes me happy.  If she has an accident, make a disgust sound like “tsst” and take her out right away.  I never yell* or spank* my puppies.  Take them out when they first wake up, after they eat or drink, before nap, finish romping, when their activities change, or when they are sniffing around. Some puppies go pee right away, but may not go poop until 10 minutes later, so wait for the poop..  I have a little play time here, because sometimes I think they are done, and they are not.  Puppies train at their own pace.  While I may have a puppy that hasn't had an accident in several weeks, I don't let my guard down.  I don't expect my puppies to be "fully potty trained" until one-year-old.  If they have a setback, shake it off, and start over.  I only have my puppies in the crate when I am not watching them.  When I am sleeping, cooking, ironing, doing chores, basically when I am not watching her.  All other times, she is out of the crate practicing being a "big girl."  This is the time I train her how to behave in the house.  So we are practicing "no barking", 'no biting", "no jumping", and "don't eat the furniture."  I also have to practice "playing inside" so she doesn't knock over things.  You must keep the puppy in sight when they are little because they don’t know the difference between newspaper and carpet, and you don’t want them sneaking off and getting into trouble.   Some puppies can sleep through the night around 3-months-old, but their bladder is grown around 6-months-old. <br>    <br>  REVISIONS:  <br>  *I use a CRATE to train with.  It is the method I prefer, compared to other methods I have tried.  I noticed that if they are in the crate, while I am doing chores, they are o.k., because the crate allows them to see me and be re-assured.  The crate can also be a comfort when stored in the basement for dogs who live in areas where thunderstorms and tornados are an issue. .  However, use the method that works best for you.....a laundry basket, a cardboard box, a woof-woof house, x-pen, child gates, whatever works for you. <br>  *OUTSIDE, pee pad, litter box, whichever method you are using.   When the puppy is first little, keep the pee pad, litter box near the food and water dish, so the puppy can eat and drink, and then go potty.  You can move it away as they get older.  The pee pad has a scent that smells and initiates potty.  Sometimes a pee pad makes a sound that scares some puppies, so you might want to use a litter box if that happens.  The pee pad allows a puppy to walk around, but a litter box keeps the puppy in one place. <br>  *BEDROOMS, I use the bedroom and living room for training, because it works for me.  Choose rooms that work for you, but watch for rooms that are damp, or drafty.  While my puppies sleep in the bedroom during training, once they are trained, I let them sleep where they want to.  They don't have to sleep in the bedroom forever. <br>  *TREATS.  While I use treats for training, you don't have to.  I like Charlee Bears for training (a little cracker for a little mouth,) I use them for training, but once they are trained, I cut back on them.  <br>  *SOME PUPPIES will go potty in the same spot each time.  Some puppies have to be told to go potty.  A command like "go out" for pee, or "go finish" for poop, might work for you, keep saying “go finish” until the puppy poops.  This is a good thing to train if you travel with your dogs.  By using commands, the puppy won't get confused when you are visiting someone, on vacation with you, or when you get to a new home.  The command will tell them what you want them to do in an unfamiliar place.  You might also want to use a leash method, so the puppy doesn’t sneak off, or for strange places. <br>  *YELLING.  It is not a good idea to "yell" or "spank" your puppy and then take them outside when they have an accident.  They may get confused and think that going outside is punishment.  While you want to correct them, if you are extreme, they may not want to go outside again.  Shake it off, and resume your schedule.  You have to keep it real.  Puppies train at their own pace, but a puppy can only hold their potty for a few hours.  A guide would be 1 hour for each month of age, plus 1 hour, so a three-month-old puppy should only be expected to hold their potty for 4 hours at most.     <br>  SOURCE:  These tips, tricks, and ideas were contributed from many brilliant minds.  Thanks for your help!|`|QVP8zSuWaa	A puppy class with help you both<br>  He should be eating 3 times a day for a few more months <br>  Puppies do not know biting is bad. When he bites you  a firm NO and replace your hand with a toy.|`|WQlCxeFlaa	He's 3 months old, he's still a puppy and like a child, you wont be able to hold his attention for too long. Keep your training sessions short and use chicken as his treat. When you training him, give him a hand signal as well as the verbal comand. If your going to teach him sit..give him a piece of chicken first to get his attention. Open your hand with your palm facing up and close your hand. He's going to jump around and try to figure out how to get the chicken. Once he sits...when he's moving to sit. say "Sit" and give him a treat. He'll cath on.

637af0df73292f4d1c8ec85214c9a369aa	Oster makes various dog clipper models.  They range from around sixty dollars to several hundred dollars.  I bought the middle of the road clippers when I groomed my mother's poodle (I'm at work or I'd give you the specific model number) for around $120.  They work great.  <br>  <br>  Grooming your dog is about technique and if you aren't trained in the specifics of technique your grooming job will likely never come out perfect.  There are specific ways you need to hold the clippers and you need to shave in a certain direction in relation to the way the dog's hair is pointed.    However, you can learn to do a functional grooming job by reading some of the online tutorials on google.  Simply type in "dog grooming" or "dog grooming technique" into google and hundreds of websites will pop up that can show you how to groom your dog.  <br>  <br>  Likewise, if you type in "dog grooming schools" into google with the area you live in you'll be able to bring up a list of places in your area.  Grooming school tuition can cost several thousand dollars so that might not be cost effective to enroll in such a school if you just want to groom your own dog.<br>  <br>  Getting your dog to hold still is another thing entirely. Most groomers are skilled to be able to groom a dog even if he his squirmy and also their tables are equipped with a lead that holds the dog in an upright position (see the url pasted into the source below).|`|RNqHUNgEaa	My only advice is don't skimp on the costs. Proper grooming supplies are expensive, but in the long run will save you money from not going to the vet. Get a grooming table with an arm. This will help hold the dog still and elevate it to make it easier to groom. Clippers come from cheap to incredibly expensive. Cheap ones are dangerous and painful for the dog. I have never shaved a dog, so I don't have a suggestion for a brand, but buy the best one you can afford.|`|x8Vgu6acaa	Invest in a good set of clippers.  Not the cheaper pet home versions. You will never get a good clip with those.   I love my Oster A 5 and have had them for 15 years.  You will need a couple different blades depending upon your dog and how you want him clipped.  There are probably some how to books or videos.  But in the end, it takes practice. <br>  <br>  The groomers have a lot of experience making them hold still.  But you can train your dog to stand and hold still.  Try to teach him this before you try to clip him.  Start by him standing while petting, then brushing, then with clippers but not clipping.  Then while clipping.  <br>  <br>  Sometimes it is just easier and cheaper to take him to the groomers if you only do it once or twice a year.|`|cnZlMojUaa	I have a set of professional quality Andis clippers (model AG, about 7 years old). Oster is the other brand I would consider. Know that you will need to get at least one and possibly multiple blades for the clippers. I have Scotties and decided that it was worth the investment in professional quality grooming equipment. This meant clippers, blades, professional grooming shears, combs, brushes, grooming table. It was expensive, but think how many times you would need to use the clippers at $60 (your grooming fee) to pay for the instrument. Your basics are the clippers, blade and good quality grooming shears. My grooming shears were an obscene cost, but will last forever. I'm giving a link to a PetEdge which is the vendor I got the majority of my grooming supplies from.<br>  <br>  With a mixed breed, it will be harder to find the right style to groom. If you know his mixes, you may be able to research those breeds and get ideas, but his grooming should enhance and show his body style to its best, so it will be unique to him. With my Scottie, I contacted a rescue organization and was giving wonderful resources. We began grooming our little girl, because we suspected she was abused at a groomers before we got her.<br>  <br>  How to keep him still? With our dog, we were able to use treats and I could hold her in position while hubby groomed. I suggest having an extra set of hands to help.

At day 21, you will need to separate any male pups from the mum or female siblings or you risk pregnancy.

I would not pick at it or get it irritated.  Let the vet check your dog over, to determine what the spot is and if there are any others on his body.  They can then give you medications and shampoos to help clear it up.<br>  It's good that you are getting it checked out now.  Best of luck to your dog.

gnRiLwSxaa	I don't know if this is considered cruel nowdays, but years ago I stopped a dog from barking at every thing that passed by, by hitting him with a rolled up newspaper every time he did it, and scolding him.|`|b20e8a86dd6ffa04ae8d661727a79c74aa	did something happen recently to make one of the dogs nervous? if one starts going, the pack mentality will kick in, and the others will bark also.  I would work really hard with the worst offender first.  go to the location where the dogs begin barking the most.  make sure you have a way to hid the view, or if it is outside, be ready to do alot of in and out, in and out.  When the dog barks, close the drapes, or take the dog back inside the house for 30 seconds.  when your dog doesn't bark, reward with a small piece of food or cooked chicken.  The dogs will figure out that barking equals a loss of freedom (can't see outside anymore, can't play in the yard any longer) and will abandon the offending behavior.  you might have to ask a friend or neighbor with a dog, or lawnmower, or whatever to walk past your dogs to be able to train them in a consistent fashion.  this will take time...and don't forget to keep treating even if you think the dogs have got it down.  eventually the dogs will see outside stimulus as something pleasurable rather than a source of anxiety.
01kEv36Faa	You shouldnt bathe cats in water.  This is very traumatizing for them and can cause more harm than good.  The best bet is to give the cat time to lick himself clean.  If you want something to surface clean him, ask your vet for a good quality dry spray that you can lightly spray and brush out.  I forgot the name of it.|`|AA11449072	First off DO NOT use normal soap on him! This will irritate his skin and could be poisenous. Go to your local pet store and buy a shampoo made for CATS, even the ones marketed for dogs are dangerous for cats.<br>  Put a towel in the bottom of you tub so your cat can get a stable foodhold, you don't want her thrashing around and slipping. Scrub him clean then rinse him off and toweldry him. It might be a good idea to keep him in the bathroom as he dries as if you let him in the house he may stuff himself into a corner where his wet fur will pick up dust.<br>  Good luck!|`|kOaPltGUaa	Cats should not be bathe.  They lick themselfs clean.|`|5Agn35EKaa	Your cat won't like it but when I need to bathe my cat I use proper pet shampoo. Soap is not for washing cats. I grip my cat by the scruff of her neck at the back as this tends to partially paralyse it long enough to put her in a bath of warm water and then I gently wash her all over.|`|5SlDYsVPaa	This sounds cruel... but when my friend and I wash his cat, one will hold the backlegs VERY tight... but not too tight. and one will hold the front and wash... Someone told us, that at the vet, or whatever... that she worked at... they would take shoelaces and wrap around starting above the knee cap. It doesn't hurt them... but they will scream because of the water. GOOD LUCK!!!|`|AA12353479	When I give my cat a bath I just sit her in the water and she does fine.  She is about the same age as yours.  First off you shouldn't use regular soap on cats.  You should go to a pet store or wal- mart and buy a cat shampoo only.  It has special ingredients made for cats.  I use Sergeant's SKIP-FLEA and TICK SHAMPOO for cats.  It is rich in coconut conditioner's to help your cats coat.  I got it at a Wal-Mart.  After he gets out of the bath you should feed him tuna in oil, it will help replenish the natural oils that lie in the cats coat to protect it.

They need to be able to roam around the house, the people who own cats with no clue how to live with them boggles my mind.  Not saying that about you.|`|zpwJR60baa	Wow, this is a hard situation. What you can do is ask your local Animal Control for consultation, if they find this cruelty animal, then you can ask them if you take over the care for this cats.   <br>  You can also not given your name..   <br>  <br>  First Why not ask your BF to see if you both can adopt them? Then if this is ok, then have your BF to ask her mother to surrender or share maybe share the care for the cat?<br>  <br>  Plus, does the room big and have ventilation?  If they have ventilation, and a nice cat tree... if is not as bad so far.<br>  <br>  Once again, I am not trying to judge.  If you let them see your situation without confrontation, your communication will be open.  Honesty is better.  Like you care for her, and the cat. You understand the grieving... <br>  <br>  <br>  Once again, I am not trying to judge, and the best is to ask the animal control for advice, without giving your name.. <br>  <br>  If you all can not care for the cat.. there is craiglist, other place like SPCA that can find them good home.

AA11992723	It's really important to clean up after her poop. the poop laying on the ground will become infected with parasites, and the parasites will then infect your dog when she eats the poop and your lawn will be infected because the eggs are microscopic and will remain in the lawn. if your dog or you simply steps on them you can bring them into your house and infect yourself! You can get hookworms for example, just by stepping on them. they go through the bottom of your foot.<br>  And if your dog has any trace of eggs in her feces, she can carry that anywhere into the house, the eggs can be on her fur. if you touch any area with eggs, then put a hand to your face/mouth, you can get worms.<br>  <br>  before you even consider whether she is eating poop because of physical, emotional, or habitual reasons, (female dogs do tend to eat poop to keep their area "tidy", it's an instinct because a mom will clean up her puppies' poop in the den) you need to clean up the lawn so it is sanitary enough for you, your dog and any new dog you bring into your home and yard.<br>  <br>  you should drop off a stool sample to your vets to check for worms, clean up the entire lawn, and treat your lawn with lyme if the vet says she is positive for any type of worms.<br>  <br>  she won't live to 20 if she keeps infecting herself with worms:(|`|FXeuwkX0aa	You could at least buy her some A-1 sauce <br>  <br>  <br>  ewww- I am sorry I cant beleive I said that.|`|6SeWCfUfaa	I don't think your mom should get you another dog until you can learn to pick up this dogs poop before it gets a chance to eat it.|`|0n2tpS1oaa	ahaha yeah my dog does that too<br>  just try to keep her away from it and try to teach her its bad.<br>  dont let her get grass tho, it makes them throw up!! lol i say that from experience|`|AA12128656	i've never heard of them eating poo because they are lonely, but many dogs do it if it's partially digested. a lot of dogs who are fed middle to lower quality food do corophragia (poo eating) because they are missing nutrients, or because the food with all the fillers is harder for them to digest.<br>  <br>  see your vet about it, to assess the dog's nutritional need, and clean up the poo as soon as your dog makes it. taking away the poo takes away most of the problem.<br>  <br>  some folks have had luck with feeding their dog a few bits of pineapple with their meal to make it taste acid, but i hear it doesn't always work.|`|OxFsslN8aa	I don't think I have ever heard that eating poop is a sign of a lack of companionship.  Aren't you or the other humans in her home her companions?   Eating poop is a natural instinctual thing for many female dogs.  In the wild a female canine eats her poop and that of her puppies in order to keep predators from smelling where they are.  It is gross to humans but not to dogs and shouldn't be punished (I didn't say you were) for doing so.  Dogs also eat their own poop to re-eat their undigested foods.  When you look at her poop is there large pieces of food?  <br>  <br>  I would think carefully about adding another dog to your "pack" as many times that comes with a lot of issues much bigger than poop eating.|`|RT8LZy7gaa	This is actually a medical condition that won't be cured by getting another dog. It's usually related to diet and nutrition.  Give her a good quality food and a vitamin daily.<br>  <br>  Buy a product called "Distaste" and put it in with her food. It makes her poo taste bad (like poop wouldnt taste bad enough!) and discourages them from eating it and breaks the cycle.|`|zBH33xb5aa	some dogs will start eating their feces because it still has protein and stuff in it. at 8 i'd try putting her on senior food. she has a chance of fully digesting the food and might not be as interested in her feces. as for companionship, sorry never heard of it. just to be warned if you get a puppy it might make her mad and start other problems, see if friends can bring over another dog to see how she reacts.|`|WzmwVlLnaa	Well, I don't know if dog's eat poop because of lack of companionship. One dog in my family ate poop voraciously and she had two other dogs living with her, all of which got along wonderfully. Another ate her own poop and lived with one other dog. I think it's pretty normal for some dogs. What breed is she?|`|2rwNv5OHaa	I have heard from veterinarians that you can add the meat tenderizer  " Accent" to the dogs food before they eat and once it is digested and they have the desire to consume the feces the Accent deters them from eating it.

We don't give our puppy a full dose, and I think after a month or so, you are only supposed to use it twice a week.  You really better ask your vet to make sure you are using it right.
asEeCmzraa	Going from one dog to two, for us, wasn't a huge deal, because we took in an older dog. Going from two to three, though, was a huge transition. <br>  Getting a new dog always requires work. You have to be able to gage the dogs reactions to one and other- This other dog sounds pretty neglected, and probably poorly socialised. If you do want this new dog, you need to realise that it isn't just getting another dog- You will most likely inherit an animal with some issues. Make sure he isn't going to be a problem with your other dog. <br>  If you can physically handle one cocker, then you can most likely handle two. When my dogs do get walked, they walk together. You need to have perfect control for this to go smoothly, though. If you have a treadmill, these work great for extra exercise for boistrous puppies and older dogs. <br>  The bottom line is, do you want this other dog because you want another dog, or because you want to save him? It may sound cruel, but don't get involved with another dog if you don't think you can handle it. For every ounce of physical investment, there's tons and tons of emotional and mental investment. <br>  Best of luck, and I hope I helped.|`|6SeWCfUfaa	I actually think two is easier than one.  <br>  <br>  I'm in a similar boat being single and financially secure.  Right now, I've only got the one dog but I have had two at a time, and even three.  Sure you add in things like having to feed, vet, and train two of them, but ... you get back being able to let the two of them entertain each other.  As simple as that sounds, there really is a profound difference in the amout of attention each dog will need from you when there are other members of the pack.  With two, you can actually find moments when you can kick back and not have the dog seeking your attention.|`|AoSeHXeQaa	I could not in good conscience leave a dog in that situation.<br>  I would take the dog, do the best I could to incorporate him into my household, get him healthy and train him.  If at the end of that time, I feel he is too much work for me, then I would find him another home. <br>  Oh- wait - thats what I do anyway :o)<br>  <br>  I foster dogs for a local shelter, so I am constantly bringing home new dogs.  The dynamic does change with each dog, and some dogs are more demanding.  But I find that if the dog is still with me after a month, he just blends in, and is no more work, at all.<br>  <br>  The first couple of weeks can be challenging.  At that point I am usually dealing with housetraining and whatever bad behaviors the dog has been taught.  After that, its downhill.<br>  <br>  Please go save the dog.|`|QLopvWKDaa	I had three questions for myself on whether to get a second dog-<br>  <br>  1. Right now I am pretty much welcome anywhere with my one small dog when I travel or visit family...with two, I need to start looking at people cringing when I visit,boarding or not going.<br>  <br>  2.  Do I really have the time to train another dog- really train him.  I am at work 9 hours a day.  Dogs don't train each other- too bad, because that would be nice!<br>  <br>  3. What if my current dog just can not adjust to this new interloper- what's my plan B, am I committed to keep this dog no matter what? No re-homing- that's my own rule for me!  I've done it before and it broke my heart.<br>  <br>  But I do feel for the little guy! Just be sure you can really handel it for the long haul- it would be awful if you had to re-home him again.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|EnwYxbS4aa	Well firstly be as sure as you can about keeping him as it would be terrible to give him a taste of a lovely home (yours), and a doggy friend only to send him packing again.<br>  <br>  I think you sound really responsible and you have obviously put lots of thought into this. <br>  <br>  Personally I went from one well trained dog to taking in another pup and it was great   -  (I now have 3 and like someone else here the third was more of an adjustment!).<br>  <br>  They keep each other company, the younger dog will take example from the older dog - (you obviously still have to train him but it will be easier with a well behaved dog as an example), it can be very entertaining  to watch the way they interact with each other also.<br>  <br>  The only little problem which you should think about is can you manage to walk two dogs on your own?  With me I just pop my dogs into the car and drive them to an area where they walk off the lead, but would you be comfortable walking two dogs on your own?  <br>  <br>  Other than that two dogs can actually be less trouble then 1!<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|RPp3WVOnaa	You sound like you are knowledgeable and responsible with your dog Duncan.  Sounds like the 8 month old cockers just needs some love and attention and training and I would bet he will do great getting out of the house where he lives and into a positive loving environment. Even if it is only a "foster" situation until you can find him a good adoptive family who will give him what he needs and deserves.  I took a toy poodle out of a home environment where it was living under the dining room table, ate table scraps, and generally was not really wanted ( it had been someones mother in laws dog who had passed away).  It had only four fang teeth and was matted and flea infested. They didnt want it. I scooped up the little guy and took him to the vet and had his teeth pulled, got him neutered, and then took him to the groomer and he was the best little dog after just a short time of my giving him the love and attention he so very much needed.  If you can afford it and are willing to give him what you gave to Duncan I say go get the little guy. You will be a better person for it.  Best Wishes!!! And thanks for caring!|`|Xq1WloWXaa	I just recently got a lab puppy and I also have a 3 year old mix breed dog whom I consider my son. <br>  <br>  They have been together now for about 2 months, and it's getting easier as time progresses. At first the older dog, completely ignored the puppy. He didn't want to be in the same room as him, wouldn't let the puppy get anywhere near him. Gradually the older dog started to accept him and now they play together regularly. (sometimes too much!) It was and is constant work to make sure that the older dog still gets his due, such as getting fed first, getting his leash put on first, ect. Little things that show that he is still important is key.<br>  <br>  I think my older dog is now happier that he has a constant playmate; however I have noticed that the older dog is getting more aggressive towards other dogs. I'm assuming this is because he's now the dominate dog in the house, his confidence is bolstered and tries to assert himself on other dogs. <br>  <br>  For me, it's become easier to exercise my older dog, but I'm sure every situation is different depending on the different personalities of the dogs.|`|qJr8xmKKaa	I myself am asking myself whether it is a good time to add another dog to the family.  I would be cautious with this dog you are looking to adopt because it probably has little or not training and socialization which could be a problem for you in the future, however it definately needs a better home then the one it is in.  I would take him from the home and then maybe talk to a cocker spaniel rescue about taking him if his behavior seems to be too much for you? Also, absolutely make sure he and your current dog get along!  That is the biggest thing for me.  I want my dogs to be best friends, not enemies.|`|NAGiNKFWaa	I see you met my old neighbors, sorry.  Well I got mine as puppies, and basically that is what you will be doing with this second puppy.  You do get a benefit of having a well trained older dog help with the training.  I think you are going to have to crate this puppy and get on top of the potty training right away.  You know this is going to be hard, but you have the benefit of having one balanced dog and you already know how to train them, I guess you really only have to realize if you can mentally handle the stress until you get this puppy trained.  I would think it would be a little easy to train the new one, since it will thrive on attention and want to please you. I hope you already picked up this puppy.|`|m81dfyOYaa	If you're willing and able to put the time in to house train another dog, having a second dog isn't hard at all once you're worked out all the "wrinkles". Ask to bring the pup home to see how Duncan reacts to him, you don't want dogs that are fighting non stop. Have him vet checked, I brought a pup home that had kennel cough, worms, a urinary tract infection, it was a rough, expensive year. Other than those issues, I've always had 2/3 dogs and enjoyed it. Good Luck.

Try and get some replacement puppy milk formula and puppy bottles from the vet just in case she rejects the pups and you have to feed them. Remember, don't worry too much.

o8LX83jVaa	if you just put the fish in the tank then it just means that it is checking out its surroundings. they can be in tanks by themselves or with others of their kind and even a few other species of fish. <br>  <br>  what size tank do you have? how long has the tank been set up? what other fish, if any, are in the tank? what type of filtration? plants?<br>  <br>  i would say that he should be fine by himself and a 20 gallon tank you could put one more but that might be pushing it as they are very messy fish. you will need about double the filtration for your tank if you get another one. <br>  <br>  also they like a very heavily planted tank and lots of places to hide. and they are freshwater fish and will become extremely stressed if you put salt in the tank, even if it is just a little salt.|`|YnCUyvK7aa	No, it doesn't need a friend.  Since it's new, it's probably just checking out the tank right now, but most species of puffers are territorial, so in time, seeing another fish in the mirror that won't go away will be a source of stress for your fish.  The territorial nature is another reason not to get 1, they would be fighting over territory in too small of a tank.<br>  <br>  You might find that your puffer will nip the fins or kill the tetras that are in your tank.  I don't know if you planned to keep them together, or were just using them to be sure the tank was cycled for the puffer.<br>  <br>  And I'm not sure why you're planning to make your tank brackish if you have a South American puffer.  These fish are a freshwater species, they don't need salt like the figure 8 or green spotted puffer.  The South American is at the bottom of the first page under the FW puffers in this website.  <a href="http://www.thepufferforum.com/forum/ug.php/v/PufferPedia/" rel="nofollow">http://www.thepufferforum.com/forum/ug.p...</a>
EeJMITyCaa	Yes, I psychology I've learned that all higher level mammals dream about experiences. Particularly in REM sleep.|`|2G6b5y8Taa	dogs do dream im sure she is dreaming of something good if shes waging her tail|`|lyr7WxtMaa	When there tail wags there dreaming of something fun, or good memories. When it comes to dreaming they react like humans do.
2G6b5y8Taa	they should be spayed|`|AA12128656	if the disease was inherited in the first place, after kipsy was discovered to have it, ryla should have been spayed once the pups were weaned, and all the pups should have been sold with spay and neuter contracts.<br>  the chance is too great to pass the disease on. part of being a good breed representative is also being healthy.<br>  <br>  the breeder should research the breed better and find stock without the disease.|`|AA10283080	They should all be spayed or neutered even without the presence of a hereditary disease considering every time they give birth they prevent an already living animal a chance at finding a home. <br>  <br>  But especially since the disease that caused the original mother to be put down is present they should all be neutered and spayed to prevent it from being passed on to more offspring.<br>  <br>  Edit: Well whether she was hit by a car or died of natural causes doesn't matter. What matters is that she had a disease that was dangerous to not only her offspring but to the humans who would come into contact with any animal that would show signs of that disease.|`|mfXDUkRYaa	No. Dogs with known hereditary illness (even suspected) in the family should NOT be bred. It is not fair on anyone, least of all the dogs if they develop the same problem.|`|AA11449072	Wow  that was confusing. I read through it a couple of times and I think that yes, She should be spayed. First of all because she could pass on the disease to her pups and I think it is really irresponsible for a breeder to take that risk. Second 5-6 million dogs are killed every year in shelters because there are no homes for them or people buy from  BREEDER. When you buy a dog from a breeder you are condemning a shelter dog to death. Spay the dog.|`|AA12126470	The female should not be bred.<br>  It is people who choose to breed dogs with chances of passing things on to pups that have kept many of the genetic diseases going.<br>  If no one even bred a dog who carried genetic flaws the amount of genetic disease would be less. <br>  You are always going to have some pop up but if you breed those with the possibility you are part of the problem not part of the solution.|`|JM4Uiunqaa	I'm not sure what you mean by "dogs cannot "carry" this disease." If it's truly a genetic condition, then you HAVE to have unaffected carrier dogs. Assuming it's a simple recessive inheritance the three possibilities are NN (both genes "normal) in "clear" dogs, Nn (one normal, one mutated gene) in carrier dogs, and nn (both mutated) in affected dogs. Breeding two Nn dogs would give an average of 50% carriers, 25% clear, and 25% affected. Any dogs that came from Kispy or her mate should be neutered/spayed and not bred since there is a good chance they are carriers or affected. The dog that was mated with Ryla should also be neutered as he must be a carrier as well. Lessen should not be bred under any circumstances. The goal of responsible breeding is to improve the breed: I fail to see how breeding a dog that could be a carrier of a serious genetic defect would benefit any breed.|`|aoYWZqq8aa	I WOULD HAVE LET MY DOOG GOT A LITTLE OLDER|`|6SeWCfUfaa	The dog should be spayed.  <br>  <br>  This is what bothers me about some breeders.  They will look at something as "well, there is a chance they might not have the disease" instead of doing the responsible thing and making sure any chance of passing that disease is eliminated.  If even the chance is slight, the dog is NOT the best candidate for breeding.  And, I wouldn't call a 50% chance "slight."  10% or less would be slight ... but even in that case, I'd spay.<br>  <br>  That's my story and I'm sicking to it.|`|8584e0329fb17c662606d5a6a8650ee2aa	The dog should be retired,spayed and not bred.  Too many breeders of top show dogs put inheritable diseases second after conformation.  It should be the other way around.  The risk is too high.  Already other dogs have developed the disorder, it's the end of this particular breeding line.|`|KjEbYCuDaa	It is a decision that should be made once the dog (Lessen) has been tested for this disease.  Seems pretty simple. Once a blood test comes back negative or positive a decision should only be made after consulting with the vet on the  possible scenarios.<br>  What would I do? I would not breed her -period, I would continue showing her until she gets her championship and then have her spayed.|`|P3eXNNqLaa	First I would see if there is a way to test it, but from the sound of it she most likely at least a carrier which means she could pass it on to her pups as well. In my opinion a dog that has genetic diseases is no show or breeding quality. The whole point of showing and breeding is to breed for a healthier, more beautiful, perfect dog. In this case showing and breeding this doesn't working towards that goal. It is also unfair to the people who receives the pets to have to see there dogs suffer that way. Its the breeders responsibility to purge that defect from its lines.
HnOqbe5Vaa	Aww he is beautiful! Lovely and fluffy and has such a friendly, playful face! :D He is a domestic tabby shorthair :) x|`|8584e0329fb17c662606d5a6a8650ee2aa	He is a domestic short hair (DSH) - or mixed breed cat - most cats are.

Nice markings.|`|VDP3pNCPaa	He is a brown tabby with white, looking a lot like one of mine.  He is a beautiful kitty.   His parentage is a blend of many different breeds.
HVIQNuz0aa	Dogs have hearing a thousand times better than humans. It hurts there ears so the dog will either be afraid of it or attack it.|`|asEeCmzraa	My younger dog thinks vacuuming is a fantastic game. He's outside, and when the vacuum goes anywhere near the door, you see his head go down, his eyes lock, and he stalks the thing through our door. He barks and leaps and wags his entire behind. Nutter.<br>  My older one, on the other hand, couldn't run fast enough. Hates it. <br>  <br>  Both dogs hate the hose, though. And the younger cannot stand scooters, prams, other dogs, skateboards, strangers, and children. He doesn't attack, except other dogs, he just hides behind me. I think this is partly my fault- I hate everything on that list, except other dogs, so I probably don't help.|`|6SeWCfUfaa	Lucky ... my dog tries to herd mine.
342b3711423c978836fa192cef3238d8aa	It's called spontaneous rehearsal and he's a very smart puppy.  What you do is ignore him, no reward and no praise because you didn't ask for that sit.  Just move a couple of feet away, call him and quickly ask him to sit, (don't ever let him see the treats, that's bribing, not rewarding!), now you call praise and reward him.<br>  <br>  If you want to teach him down, don't put him in a sit first because dogs then get in the habit of sitting first and won't go straight into the down.  Teach the down totally separate from the sit.  Try putting a treat held between your fingers on the ground close to him so he has to go down to get it.  Don't say the word "down" until he's actually down.|`|NAGiNKFWaa	Puppies are very smart, so you have to be careful when training them.  So at first he has to sit and then he gets a treat, so next you have him sit and then shake and then get a treat, and you keep adding things.  Now be very careful and pay attention.  You may think you taught sit, shake, treat, but he may have seen the treats and barked, so the puppy thought you taught sit, shake, bark, treat.  They are very smart, but keep training, they are a magnet for learning new things from 8 to 16-weeks, so cram as much training time in as you can, but not too much because it can be overwhelming.  Don't forget you have to teach them to play too.|`|nwHqblWiaa	My Bichon Frise does the same thing..I just taught her how to give her paw and now everytime I have a treat and say "Lola" (her name) she sits and gives me her paw! Hahaha. I don't know really how to break her of it either. Im sorry...but your puppy isn't the only one! ;]|`|evEJxv06aa	Puppies are very smart, so you have to be careful when training them. So at first he has to sit and then he gets a treat, so next you have him sit and then shake and then get a treat, and you keep adding things.|`|fBMSIlSIaa	Haha my lab does this. But shes older now, about 7 yrs old and shes learned other things. Just try other tricks without showing the treat bag and if he does it right, then get the treat bag and give him a treat.|`|EeJMITyCaa	If you dont ask for it then dont treat. Otherwise your puppy is training you.|`|asEeCmzraa	Your dog has figured out that sitting=treats. If he sits without treats on your command, then it's time to move on to a new command.<br>  You can teach a dog basically anything from sit. Down, shake, roll over, stay... The list is pretty much endless. <br>  I would start on getting him to drop, or go down, either or- it's your preference. Once he has it, you stop treating. Once he has it without treats, move on. Remember to always revise what you've tought your dog- Don't just presume that because he got it once, he's pefected it. I still go over basic obedience with my dogs- And they're 7 and 1 years. They don't get treats, but they know their commands perfectly. <br>  Once he has perfected basic verbal commands, you can move onto things such as hand signals and noises- No words.|`|yLkSov8maa	What do you mean? You can teach him anything such as:<br>  1.lie-down: when he is in sit position take a treat and put it to the floor and say "lie down" when he lies down say it once more then say "GOod-Boy!" and give him the treat.<br>  <br>  2. Dance; Hold the treat up and say dance, when he starts to jump on his hind legs to get the treat, praise him!<br>  <br>  Really you can teach whatever you want, because he sits on his own doesn't mean it's the end of the road, it just means he is trained!<br>  <br>  <br>  Have fun training your pup more tricks!|`|qapJU3tMaa	This pup is entirely too young to be away from it's Mom and litter mates.  These small breeds of dogs need to stay with the breeder until they are around 12 weeks old.  You can attend some puppy classes once your dog has all of his vaccinations.  Your breeder can refer you to a kennel club in your area, and they can refer you to a puppy class.|`|0q2B11ygaa	naaa i dont think my dogs are that smart!!! their mutts hahah but they pretty smart when it coems to food b.c u know when the hungry b.c they take their big cow bowls and smash them up against the house til we get the idea!!! kinda funny hahah <br>  <br>  best of luck with ur pup i know u really love him he is so lucky to have u|`|qTTAoEWPaa	hmm try teaching him the "up" command to get him sto stand up, so that way you can still work on the sit command. <br>  my dogs do this too but i just tell them up and to sit again lol :)|`|CgEQAgXhaa	Do the same thing you did with sit.  If hes sitting before he gets the command, dont give him a treat.  Just move on to another command.  Give him the treat after he performs a new trick.|`|FdcWPp48aa	Well, apparently he learned to sit quickly.  Just move on to other commands and mix them up to keep him on his toes.
AA11992723	why would you shave her?? the fur helps insulate from cold AND Heat!<br>  <br>  go to your own vet, sometimes shelter vets are overwhelmed, sometimes shelters are corrupted too. one shelter near me just got shut down because they were selling purebreds to pet stores.<br>  <br>  don't try to train her to stop panting, it is a physical instinct for cooling down, pain, stress, heart problems, seizures, or other physical illness. she needs vet care.|`|AA12128656	panting can also be a sign of distress, she may be in pain. have her go to the vet, she may have arthritis or something else which is hurting her. they can help make her more comfortable.|`|NAGiNKFWaa	Panting is a sign of pain, I would get an x-ray done to see if your vet can find out what is going on.  It could be a tumor you can't see.|`|nPuZVGFRaa	Do you leave a water dish out for her 24/7?<br>  Dogs do this because there hot, thirsty, scared, etc.|`|zituIhQ2aa	it can actually be a sign of heart problems..they pant to increase the oxygen in their blood...
Gnzeq3f2aa	His age has nothing to do with his abusing the animal. Many young people are just as bad - if not worse. Your neighbor could have medical issues such as Alzheimer's or depression that affect his judgment. That doesn't make him evil. And to say "old people neighbors are evil" is wrong. Most older folks are very kind and have a lot of wisdom to share with younger folks if they take the time to listen. Try to remember they were young once too and you will be an "old people neighbor" yourself someday. <br>  <br>  That being said, if you are truly concerned about the treatment the dogs are getting call Animal Control and report it. They will investigate and take any needed intervention. <br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|RPp3WVOnaa	Call your local humane society and report him. He doesnt have a right to hit his dog or try to hurt your pets. They wont tell him you called. They keep it anonymous. You would be doing the animal a favor.  Just because people are old doesnt mean they are evil.  There are a lot of senior citizens who are lovely people.  He may be senile or have dementia or Alzheimers.  Best Wishes!!|`|0FA9gr9Iaa	Dont do any thing that will make him more angry try makin him understand that what he is doin is wrong if that wont work then......<br>  <br>  DO WHAT EVER U WANT!!!|`|IcfoAI3naa	take some pictures or video of him doing that then call the police.|`|dskMPG3Haa	videotape him beating the dogs and trying to hurt your animals and send the videos to the humane shelter.<br>  <br>  if that doesnt work then steal the dogs and give them away.<br>  yew have to help them somehow?|`|cY8DgJv5aa	First, call the humane society and report the abuse.  Take video and/or pictures of the abuse if you can.  Evidence like that would be priceless.<br>  <br>  Second, don't generalize all old people as evil and heartless ("old people neighbors are evil").  The age of your neighbor isn't the primary factor here.  Its his behavior towards animals that is upsetting.  It could just as easily be a 30-year old man as it could be a 90-year old man.
XagPxe7Faa	First, let me start by saying that this is a horrible situation that you are faced with.  I understand what a difficult thing this is to deal with and the thought of rehoming a dog that you've come to think of as a member of the family is truly heart breaking.  <br>  <br>  I am familiar with the typical restrictions enforced by HOAs.  You state that they will not permit a kennel type structure, and that is about the norm.  However, will they not permit you to build a fence surrounding you whole yard?<br>  <br>  Also, you are right.  It is likely that a shelter would not adopt the dog out and would euthanize it, given his record.  However, a rescue, more specifically, a breed specific rescue, would be less likely to do that.  They would likely take more time to try to place the dog in a home with no children, have his behavior reinforced by professionals, and offer to return the dog to you if they could not find a home in leiu of putting it down.<br>  <br>  Being that the dog HAS bitten...for whatever reason, you have to look at the possibilities of the situation.  The end result behind and aggressive bite is still the same, regardless to if the reason behind the dog's actions were provoked, or instinctual.<br>  <br>  I for one, could not fathom having a dog with that record around my children, but that's just me.  I love my dogs, more than some of my family members (LOL), but my child comes first.|`|AA12128656	how about finding a shiba enthusiast who has no kids? he sounds like he would be a good dog for someone older,  the other two bites involved running kids too? <br>  the dog obviously needs to be trained what is appropriate play and what is not.<br>  <br>  have you considered building a kennel for him when he isn't in the house, being monitored by you?<br>  <br>  if you can't properly contain or train the dog, then you obviously shouldn't keep it. re-homing it or having it euthanized are your only options. and i'm not crazy about euthanasia. <br>  <br>  in my house, dogs get ONE chance. bite a kid on purpose, meet my 9mm. but it's never happened with my pit bull terriers... only a rescued whippet mix once|`|tPGxPDvBaa	Either contacting a dog trainer/behaviorist with experience in dealing with shibas or contacting the Shiba rescue & asking them who they would recommend or if they would re-home him.  I adopted a 4yr male shiba last year & mine does fine but no kids nearby.  Mine doesn't warm up either like my other dogs.  He doesn't show any aggression, he just doesn't go over to them for attention or petting.  I wouldn't let him near any kids running around or screaming only standing still & being quiet if then.  The high prey drive is standard on them & one of the reasons I don't suggest most ppl get one.  So many ppl lately have seen one & don't realize how difficult they can be.  Good luck & maybe you can find someone similar to my situation where they are single & no kids nearby.|`|0JHi6Rxaaa	This is not the dogs fault, it is yours. Fence your yard properly, never leave any dog unattended with any child and never invest in a large, guardian breed unless you are committed to keeping them properly. This is not a vicious dog, it is a guard breed that thinks it is doing its job. It needs to be worked. It needs to think and get exercise and have its breed respected. You are lucky no one has been killed. <br>  <br>  Contact Todd loves Moslers (sp?) or another breed specific rescue and surrender this dog. It deserves a family that understands its needs and is willing to act accordingly. This is too much dog for you.<br>  <br>  EDIT: Yes a rescue can adopt him out, if they have the resources to keep him until a proper owner presents his or herself. I currently foster a Rottie who will bite a stranger and in the beginning wanted to push me around and would have bit me over food aggression and bed guarding issues. After 6 months with me, he's as meek as a kitten with family, but still cannot be trusted with most guests. He seems to like kids, but I never let them run and play around him, even muzzled. Early socialization and training might have prevented this, but it is what it is. I deal with it. When he gets adopted it will be to the correct environment or he will spend his life with me.|`|OxFsslN8aa	I would suggest erecting a kennel 10' x 10" with a lock on the door for when he needs to be outside.  Dogs don't need free reign at all times.  If you walk him several miles a day & allow him to be in the house with the rest of your pack at night for sleeping and during bad weather, I think he would be fine in kennel during the day.  Allow him to have toys that keep him amused like Kongs.  <br>  <br>  It sounds like you are a very responsible owner & I commend you for your efforts to this point.|`|YUQgyPT3aa	You should have a fenced in area specifially for the dog...no kids allowed, and the dog should be neutered if it is not already.<br>  <br>   If the prey drive in your dog is THAT strong, and you are unable to train him to control himself, it probably would be better to rehome him.<br>  <br>  There are S I specific rescues that have people with years of experience with these dogs and their personalities...Of course they would not adopt out a dog that has these types of issues to a home with children, however, a stronger handler may be able to rehab and rehome him to a good experienced dog owner.<br>  <br>  So sorry, tough decision, please investigate every option before euthanization. <br>  <br>  good luck|`|CcESWX5vaa	here if a person gets in the yard fence or not  your liable for his/hers medical bills because here any dogs that bite are to be confined to a pen away from children you could be looking to go to court  n be sued sorry to say if the bites  just bruised the skin or brought blood.|`|QV2WQsd8aa	Do you have a fence?  If not, I realize it's an expensive investment, but I would build a secure fence and put a lock on the gate so that kids cannot allow themselves in whenever they want.  I understand your concern about giving him to a rescue, but I'd talk to the Shiba Inu rescues and see if they would be willing to give him a try at a last resort.|`|f6be38fa4f0a14b54a53885b1dcdae82aa	You have a serious liability problem on your hands. Every report made to Animal Control is evidence that the dog is a problem. You need to have this animal contained in an area that children cannot be allowed near. If he has bitten more than once he may not differentiate with one of your own children if he is agitated. <br>     Children under the age of 10 do run and play. You need to not allow your children have friends over to play at their house or deal with the dog in a responsible adult fashion.  As a parent I would not have let this get past the first bite incident.<br>     Ask yourself if you can afford to lose your home in the event that some other parent decides to sue you. And remember, these previous bite reports show a pattern that a good attorney would find to be a cake walk in court. Don't rely on your home owner's insurance either. They frown upon dog related injuries.|`|pvm8wo9Waa	If you can, put up a fence and lock the gate.   If not, see if you can use a totally wireless fence and whether that works for you.  I would not permit other children to visit. Otherwise, walk your dog and and walk him on leash in the yard to prevent this behavior.|`|s76aC4G8aa	I'm sorry to say but a shelter or rescue will not take a dog that has a biting history.  All you can do is train the dog.<br>  <br>  What I suggest, is making sure your back yard is gated and locked to keep kids out because kids don't read signs because they don't see them so they are pretty much a CYA.  Then with your dog on a leash in the back yard and you with a bag of treats, you need to work on his "desire" to chase when kids are around.  Get the neighbors kids to help, tell them that they will not be harmed because the dog will be on a leash at all times and no where near them to cause any harm.<br>  <br>  sit your dog down and have the children about 50 feet away or just under, have them playing pattycake in a circle standing, then when your dog sits quietly reward and move a little closer, when he doesn't react reward him.  Then have the kids jump up and down make noise [not screaming] the jumping up and down will get him excited, you want to put yourself in between the kids and the dog, make him focus on you and reward when he's calm, if he looks over and doesn't react reward.  Then move closer, keep this up reward when he does not react or even shows no interest, have him laying down about 10 feet from the children.<br>  Ok once he's got that down pat and it shouldn't be hard because he likes kids, then you'll want to have them RUN past one at a time.  This will be harder because his instinct will be to "chase" you must curb this by snapping his leash to the side when he lunges or goes for the kids, try at first to keep his focus on you while giving him treats [be careful that you don't reward a bad behavior] have a child run by if he doesn't react reward, if he does, snap the leash to the side and have him refocus on you.  The goal is to have the children run past and he only LOOK at them and NOT react to the running.  Maybe combine it with the phrase "No Chase".  Don't lose patience and do this for about 15 minutes every day until he begins to simply NOT react to them running.  This will require you in the yard with the dog on a leash.  He has to "understand" that chasing and biting is "not acceptable" to you.<br>  <br>  It will take considerable time and probably have to work with him for his life because you won't end up with him "fixed" you will be able to control it though.  Remember, you have to unbreak a very bad habit that he's been allowed to get away with for four years, be proactive NOT reactive.<br>  <br>  Good luck
ZYzhBhgJaa	remove him, the parent will eat the fry. African cichlids keep their eggs in their mouth until they hatch, and they don't eat while their eggs are inside, so when the eggs hatch & the fry swim out, the mother is quite hungry, and little jr makes a tempting and convenient snack!|`|WnDWrEiOaa	you should keep him away from other big fishes|`|dE5fs9yzaa	Link doesnt work.<br>  Tried again and it worked but don't see a fry.

kWwgWSSgaa	It's a visible form of identification. The breeder of my current Dobermann b*tch, had the litter tattooed before I colleted her. I was given the papers to transer the details registered into my name.<br>  <br>  If a dog with a tatoo was stolen/went missing & was found, the finder could contact the regiser, who would then contact the owner.<br>  <br>  Even if the tattoo partially fades [which has happened with Tori's tattoo] the register can still trace the dog by sex, breed & a partial tattoo number.|`|RN1wGlWWaa	Probably an identification mark.  I've heard of it before.|`|ad09a262eea23aed99f3309da57c67c5aa	Many tattooed dogs came from larger breeders who raise several litters a year.  It is their way of identifying the pups as is required by AKC rules.  Most tattoos from national dog registry, tattoo a pet etc. are placed on the flank.  Tattoos in the ears can be altered by cutting off the ear and therefore are not used much for ownership purposes.  Tattoos placed on the flank were a means of identification before microchips.  Some were the owners social security number (no longer used), the dog's registration number, a random number, or a number assigned by the tattoo registry.  You most likely will not be able to find the source of the tattoo.|`|yyf5N7Ogaa	It is her AKC registration number. This was the common way of identifying dogs before microchips. I would write AKC and let them know you now own the dog, so if she gets lost she is returned to you and not the former owner.<br>  <br>  ADD: Here is the AKC Website. Try looking under registration.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.akc.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.akc.org/</a>|`|HVIQNuz0aa	It's just an ID.

When you take her to to the vets next ask them to check for you.  Hope this helps
J0OfYZiXaa	Hi there,<br>  <br>  My suggestion for you is to start making friends with people at your barn.

MG8MwZrIaa	I've had mice before and they do make excellent pets.  But like the other person said, yes, they can bite, but if you spend a lot of time playing with them and getting them used to being handled, they'll be fine.  They're great because they are awake more in the daytime than hamsters.  They're a lot of fun to watch.  :)|`|OrvTG44laa	Mice are good pets, but you should get rats.  Rats are like mice, except they are bigger and smarter.  They are better pets, but both are good.  <br>  I'd go for the mouse- or rat- because of their social nature and friendliness.  Mice are very social and crave your attention.  Hamsters are solitary and don't need your companionship, but will tolerate handling.  Mice are smarter, and will form a stronger bond with you.  They are both really the same amount of care and money, and mice will be more rewarding in the long run.  So get a mouse- but you should get a rat because they are a lot better than mice.  <br>  Mice are generally friendly towards humans and rarely bite unless they are not handled and socialized properly.  Remember, any animal, even humans, that don't have proper socialization at a young age will become nasty.  I suggest getting a younger one, so that they can be properly socialized and tamed.  Mice are very easy to tame, too, because of how social they are.  Just handle them and play with them from a young age for about 20 minutes today.  Make sure you buy from a pet store where they have been handled and socialized.  If a mice is left by itself and neglected, it won't be friendly towards humans and may bite.|`|38B9AkVjaa	well this is up to you, if you would like something a bit different and a challenge but fun to look after then get a mouse, or get a hamster because you are comfartable holding and caring for one.<br>  <br>  my personal opinion would be hammy<br>  <br>  <br>  xx|`|rfXJTJriaa	get a hamster!!!! they are sooo adorable i had mice but they fought and it was bad|`|sq3hGb98aa	I'll go for hamsters because a mice will bite.|`|jScAfrvYaa	you should get a rat. they are great pets. and somewhat exotic because not many people own them. however, if you are reallly stuck on a mouse or a hampster, i woulod go with a mouse. they seem like really good pets. but be careful with the cage you put them in because they are reallly tiny and can squeeze out of a lot. an aquarium/tank would be a good habitat for them because they have no bars or spaces. they arent that expensive either. about $20 for a ten gallon one. not too bad.|`|10eguzBCaa	hamsters there are cool
rXMTdUg4aa	If they are clear you will see the quick. It will be pink and you want to stay above it. If they are black... take the dog to the vet for a nail trim. Its hard to tell someone where to cut with out seeing them myself. If you don't cut nails on a regular basis, you won't have the experience. You WILL quick the dog. Have them done by a groomer or take the dog to the vet. Tell your friend to take better care of her dog.|`|bfdcc0fde62d752fd00994881ebd0257aa	Just clip a little bit off making sure not to go low enough to hit the quick(about half way to the quick).Then maybe after two or three weeks later clip a little more off,again, making sure you don't hit the quick.If you cannot see the quick(I have never had a dog with nails where I couldn't see the quick)then by all means,take it to the vet and have them do it.|`|QV2WQsd8aa	The quick will grow as the nail gets longer.  You will have to clip small amounts gradually.  This may take a few weeks.  I would suggest taking her to a groomer and tell them you would like her nails grinded.  I am a groomer and I use a dremel tool (like pedi-paws) to grind their nails instead of clip them.  I am able to grind them back farther than I would be able to clip them and there is less chance the dog will bleed.  Most groomers do not charge much just for nails.|`|FdcWPp48aa	The quick does grow out with the nail, so be careful how much you clip off.|`|Ip2Z6nesaa	What I do with my dog is I lay her on her back when I'm going to clip her nails so I can see her and she can see me and she is comfortable. She gets very nervous when we clip her nails because when I first learned how, she jolted and I cut off a little too much and her nail started bleeding. <br>  What I've learned works best is cutting off little by little of the nail with the special dog nail clipper, until I see the slightest bit of lighter nail or white. It might be easier with my dog since her nails are black, but just pay close attention to any change in color. In case you're scared of making her bleed, you can try buying that special powder for dogs when you clip their nails. You get a Q-tip, dip it in the powder and apply it to the nail and it will stop the bleeding. It's called Stiphic Powder (that's what it says on the bottle my vet gave me) or Styptic Powder (what the internet says). There's a brand called Quick Stop specially made for this, so if you cut it too short, no worries. It just helps the blood clot to stop the bleeding.|`|jV7SmnaTaa	If they're white nails - you can usually see where the quick ends.  If they're black nails, you will just have to take a little off at a time until you see a ring in the center - then you're getting close to the quick and need to take a break.  It might not be a bad idea to pay a groomer or vet clinic the $10 if they're really long and the dog may be wiggly.  Otherwise, if you want to do it yourself, invest in a good pair of clippers and some clotisol or quickstop.  Best wishes!<br>  <br>  Edit:  In response to some of the other answers:  Yes, the dog does need to have its nails clipped - otherwise they can get caught on something and tear off - then you have a bloody mess and a painful dog.  Also - the PediPaws is a nice idea, but they don't work very good.  If they dog weighs less than 10 pounds they work OK if you don't have to take much off - but, if you have any significant nail that needs to be taken off or if it's a larger dog the PediPaws is junk!|`|AA10283080	When a dogs nails get that long it takes a long process to clip them without clipping the quick. The quick grows with the nail so you have to clip just a small amount off the end of the nail. A week from then you clip off another small amount because the quick has moved back some. Then the next week you clip even more because the quick has moved back even more.<br>  <br>  It can be a lengthy process but it's better than clipping the quick.|`|2ieiGIhTaa	I take my dogs to petsmart once a month or so to get their nails clipped.  They charge 8 bucks a dog, which is totally worth it, because it is a terrible job.|`|90yjyha0aa	Your best bet would be to take the dog somewhere to get the nails cut (assuming the family will let you).  Let them know that long nails can actually hurt the dog.  I'm not sure if the quick would grow with the nail or not. I would think no, but I'm not sure. If you take the dog somewhere like the vet or petsmart they can cut them for you. I take my dog to petsmart and they grind his nails. That way his nails are rounded off so they don't splinter and they are shorter than they would be if they were cut.|`|plhfe5Zaaa	I'd take her to a groomer if they are long, it's not expensive. If you don't trust groomers a vets office will do it for pretty cheap. If you wanna do it yourself have the dog stand in a bath with warm water on its feet to make the nails softer. Then cut off small amounts at a time. The quick does grow with the nail. If they are black nails I wouldn't even try it myself.|`|KxjUim7yaa	They need to take the dog to a groomer or the vet. The dog will need corrective clipping over a period of time to get the nails back to where they should be without damaging the quick. The dew claws can grow in a complete circle or into the paw if left unclipped. I go to the vet and they just charge $12.|`|zhk8o514aa	Be careful, longer the dog toenails are the longer the quick is going to be.  Sometimes they are so long that a vet has to take care of it.
CvbB4qv3aa	DONT get a ferret for that reason please.<br>  As a ferret owner i know, you cant get one because you think it can live without a cage.<br>  My boys [ferrets] have been through 3 cages in 1 year and are currently in a 5 story cage.<br>  It costs alot, they can get sick alot too.<br>  They cost alot to feed, they poop alot.<br>  The smell is so strong your friends will smell it on your clothes even when washed.<br>  <br>  You really do need to look into it more before you go "i want one get me one now"<br>  <br>  Your 14 years old, get a cat or something.<br>  Ferrets are very demanding and take alot of your time up.|`|A9Koz4cqaa	Ferrets are wonderful pets but they are not for everyone.  They are escape artists and can fit their body into anything the can get their head to fit into.  My ferret came to me as a stray and it may because she escaped from someones house.  They have a distinct odor and need frequent bathing to minimize it (even if they are descented).  I think you need to research them a lot more before you decide they are right for you.  They are a ton more work then gerbils!|`|AA11925457	my parents would not let me get frogs so i went out and got theim anyway but the difference is i am leagle and i can get what i want|`|5voFMvonaa	tell them that ferretts are good for hunting rabbit stew|`|fdNbSn0Vaa	Honestly I would not try talking your parents into letting you get a ferret because they need to get out and play everyday for a couple hours and they at least need a 10x10 cage unless your gonna let him/her run around freely all day but them you have to make sure all cords and electrical wires are covered or put up.....they need alot of attetion and a ferret might not be the best pet for you right now|`|GKYNpF1Gaa	I couldn't convince my parents that getting a pet snake was a good idea! I just brought mine home one day and my mum fell in love with him!|`|ip5EWw7uaa	They are wonderful creatures - but they don't make very good indoor pets because they are pretty strong smelling. Given your track record on gerbils - and the fact that ferrets are far more likely to escape, I would suggest kicking the whole idea into touch. This sounds like a lot of grief waiting to happen.|`|GvxFdve3aa	wow thats easy if you  have slugs or other crap like that in your garden then tell your mum the ferret will eat them <br>  <br>  then say it will make you more responsible since u have to clean it every day and spend at least 2 hours with it per day<br>  <br>  then say this is what you wannted for about 2 years but knew theyd say no <br>  <br>  then say youll do whateva they tell u to do for 2 weeks
AA12128656	it's possible that it's a product of nervousness or OCD. do you know anything about her history? you may need to have the vet intervene on this one, or find a way to keep her otherwise occupied so she doesn't do this.
iasOicRjaa	He probably was referring to Medial Patella Luxation.....the ligament doesn't work properly and allows the kneecap to slip in and out of the correct position.....it is genetic but can be aggravated by jumping up a lot (stress to the knee) Suppliments might help promote good joint health but there are no supplements to cure his problem....if it gets bad enough you may have to opt for surgery to fix it. You can help him by feeding him a high quality diet, make sure he doesn't become overweight, and if you want to you can add glucosamine/chondritin to his food. Many vets offer glucosamine chondritin supplements to promote good joint health. Ask your vet how much to give your baby :-)|`|f6be38fa4f0a14b54a53885b1dcdae82aa	Didn't the vet suggest a supplement? I would ask him first. I give my shepherd a daily joint enhancer that contains glucosamine, choindroitin and MSM. I give similar products to my older horses.|`|9cMmaOm9aa	Poor Thing :( <br>  this website is very helpful and its about dogs health <br>  <a href="http://www.sniksnak.com/doghealth/kneecap.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.sniksnak.com/doghealth/kneeca...</a><br>  hope he gets better your dog gets better soon|`|pzMWdVoLaa	tide the dog
Ag8pE3Cyaa	Yes and it can be corrected. When you come in the door do not look or talk to her. She will jump at you and do her little happy dance but completely ignore her till she's calmed down. Only give her affection once her little frenzy is over. <br>  <br>  When someone else comes to the door, get a spray bottle ready by the door. Even before opening the door if she gets excited, spray her (aim the mouth) and say 'no'. Let people in, continue controlling her with the spray bottle. Soon, she'll only see the bottle and will turn around. <br>  <br>  She pees cause you let her get excited. If you control her excitement and do not let it escalate she won't pee.|`|6SeWCfUfaa	It's not uncommon, but it's not what I would call "normal."  <br>  <br>  Some breeds and some individual dogs are more prone to this, but you can teach them not to do this.  Obedience training to increase their confidence will help.  More exercise and socialization so they don't get so excited and over stimulated by things.  And ... making greeting, comings and going at your house very low key events.  In other words, if she's all happy, happy when you come home, you should ignore her until she really settles down, then pay her some very calm attention.  When she meets new people, they should be told to ignore her until she calms down also.  <br>  <br>  You can also start to desensitize her by leaving the house and coming back over and over and over.  And not paying her attention until you can come in the door and she'll remain calm for you.  Then calmly pet her.|`|OxFsslN8aa	Many dogs do this.  If you don't enjoy cleaning up the mess you can condition your dog not to enjoy your entrance quit so much by ignoring her for 5 minutes after you get home.  Walk through the door without making eye contact or talking to her & go about your business.  You could go outside and have her follow and then enthusiastically greet her.|`|rXEVEfqHaa	Yeah its normal. My friends dog does this all the time.|`|AA10973353	Sometime dogs can get too excited and pee. I suggest when you come in the door, don't speak to the dog or pay any attention to it, take it directly outside to go potty.  After she has gone potty outside, the you can greet her, get all excited with her, and have fun!|`|1534d468a65c751ee8e89c33fc301985aa	I had the same problem with my dog. She pees inside my house.. I showed him to my vet and got everything OK.. But it doesnt help.. Don't you think. We care for them.

My dog did this to until I made her sit to greet people and not jump, therefore she became calm and as she got older..NO MORE PEEING! :)|`|lxXMfqnKaa	I think that this is normal for some dogs.  My grandmas dog does it ALL THE TIME and he has done it ever since he was a puppy.|`|BUkQybJLaa	my girls friends dog does the same thing and some times also when i try grabbing it.|`|5KLXlfb2aa	yes it is because my dogs do that. When they get really happy they tend to let everything out(on the accident though).|`|QvF7ZJibaa	it sure is, we call it happy pee|`|FXeuwkX0aa	Sure- I pee as soon as my wife gets home.|`|4cWtH7X2aa	Yes it is, not all dogs do it but a lot of them do.

I wanted a dog to do obedience and flyball with.  Aussies are well suited for these things.  I also wanted a dog that would be naturally protective and a good deterent, Aussies also fit that bill.

They're also very energetic and up for anything you want to do.<br>  <br>  I'm going to add this question because I think it's important:<br>  What are the worst things about this breed?<br>  They shed like crazy.  If you don't like dog hair, you won't like Aussies.  They are very energetic and need to be kept busy.  If you don't like having a dog that wants to play from morning till night, you won't like an Aussie.  They can be very stubborn and sometimes, they can be bullies with other dogs.  So you have to watch them closely and not let them get away with things.  They'll also herd children ... which can be a plus in some cases, but most of your neighbors won't like it :)<br>  <br>  Did you choose a male/female dog for a reason?<br>  I chose a male because with this breed, and with the lines I he came out of -  they have a bit more stable temperment than the females.

I would be hesitant about putting barbs in with danios & mollies, but if the tiger barbs you currently have are fine with them, then go for it. You must have a decent sized school, because this will keep them from becoming too aggressive. If you want to add Green tigers, go ahead, and you won't have to buy six because they will just join in with your other tigers.|`|NuSFGFtOaa	It all depends on your tank size.

You should ALWAYS keep tiger barbs in groups of 8 or more or they will nip your fishes fins.|`|86b135e0c5c7fa8152fab546e88b509caa	Green Tiger Fish - do you mean Green Tiger Barbs? In which case they are just another colour form of the regular Tiger Barb and can go with those. Just make sure your tank is large enough to support them, ideally over 25 US gallons. <br>  <br>  I would avoid Apisto's with fin nippers like Tiger Barbs, clash of personalities and the Apisto's may get fin nipped, especially the males. Apisto's can get very territorial if they decide to spawn also.<br>  <br>  If you don't mean Green Tiger Barbs, can you be more specific on species? Maybe a latin name?|`|QV6swGUMaa	tiger barbs need to be in a group are they can be very nippy as i did not know and had to bring back because they were harrasing my angel fish.i got this site with a chart for fish off someone the other day which is very good and helpful.<a href="http://www.ratemyfishtank.com/freshwater_compatibility_chart.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.ratemyfishtank.com/freshwater...</a>
AA12126470	Be ready to train from day one. It is a life long thing to train with your dog.<br>  Dobermans need consistant rules. Set them and then follow them all the time do not make exceptions. Dobermans require tons of exercise. A walk a day is not going to do it for this breed. They need time to run. They enjoy playing rough and hard. Mine look at times like a dog fight in the yard. It is all play. <br>  The breed is prone to many things. Cancer of any type is common. <br>  Von Wilde brands a bleeding disorder<br>  bloat like any large chested dog.<br>  Skin problems with the blues and fawn dogs and some of the reds as well. <br>  They can have dominance issues. You need to take the leadership role. If you do not the dog will and you will have issues you can not even imagine. At times this breed does ont take direction from children well. You need to supervise them with kids. <br>  They require lots of attention. They have been called velcro dogs. They like to be with the owners. Doing what ever you are doing. <br>  They eat a fair amount but you need to feed a very high quality diet to ensure good health and weight. <br>  When you get a pup the tail will have been cropped. They are done a about 3 days old. The ears are done at about 9-12 weeks. That would be your choice.|`|qgeI6Chxaa	Any good breeder should have already done the ears and tail. Don't let anyone make you feel guilty about cropping and docking, there's nothing wrong with it. Cropped dogs are just as healthy and happy as any other.<br>  <br>  Dobermans are not "easy" dogs that I would suggest for first a time dog owner. They require good training, so obedience classes are a must. You have to be firm with them or they'll take advantage of you. If you can't be the alpha dog, Dobies have no problem filling that role. They also have a lot of energy and need plenty of exercise.<br>  <br>  If you're sure you can handle one, Dobermans are great pets. They're friendly, affectionate, playful, and protective. When properly socialized, Dobies are great with kids and other dogs. Their coat is easy to maintain, although they do shed a bit.<br>  <br>  edit: Looks like a lot of people would rather rant about cropping than answer your question. Here's a copy of an answer I posted a few days ago about the reasons behind cropping and docking:<br>  <br>  For many working dogs the tails are cropped to prevent injury. Herding dogs, for example, are at risk of getting their tails caught in gates. Guard dogs are docked so that there's less for an intruder to grab. Many breeds have very brittle tails, so docking is a way to prevent injuries. Some people think docking is cruel, but it's a lot better than a traumatic injury and amputation.<br>  <br>  Ear cropping also serves a practical purpose. Cropped dogs are much better at locating the origin of sound, which is a huge advantage for hunting or guard dogs. Cropping also helps reduce ear infections by increasing airflow in the ear canal. Floppy ears are a result of selective breeding, but all wild animals have prick ears for good reasons.|`|yb01tlviaa	yuck, ive been working with dogs for 3 years now, and EVERY SINGLE doberman i have met in the past 3 years has had SOMETHING wrong with it.  Not to mention it is usually the owners fault, people dont understand that a doberman is for a very experienced dog owner, they are very difficult to train and keep control of, so, best of luck to you, although i really recommend you dont get one. As for the cropping, thats f*cking mean and is so very pointless.|`|qapJU3tMaa	The tail should have been docked when the pup was 2-3 DAYS old.  It would be considered a surgery now.  Why do you want to crop ears?  Don't know where you live, but in the UK it's against the law to crop ears.  It's cruel and inhumane.  Why would you want to put the dog thru that pain?|`|kWwgWSSgaa	It has to be an excellent match between what the breed needs from a home & what the person/family wants from the breed.<br>  <br>  The Dobermann is not the breed for the faint hearted or inexperienced dog onwer. They are inclined to be dominant, need to be trained from day one, in a firm [but not harsh] fair, consistent way, corrected for unwanted behaviour & lavishly praised for obeying/responding to a command. <br>  <br>  The Dobermann puppy will play by the rules, as long as it knows what the rules are & they are consistently applied by all of the family. It is vital if the pup is to accept its place at the bottom of the pack that this is done. <br>  <br>  Owning a fully grown Dobe who lunges at every other dog or is nervous in new situations is not only embarrassing, but dangerous, so it is truly important to introduce your young puppy to as many situations as possible to enable it to grow into a confident adult.<br>  <br>  The Dobermann is a *very* active, super intelligent breed, that thrives when worked & mentally stimualted. An adult Dobermann needs at least 1.5 hours exercise off lead exercise.<br>  <br>  The Dobermann is not an ideal breed to live in a kennel, as is prefers to be with its human pack as much of the time as it can manage. Not called the velcro dog for no reason. If this isn't something you want from a dog, choose another breed.<br>  <br>  In terms of care for the coat, it's very low maintenance. Daily brush with a zoom groom, cleaning ears, trimming nails, brushing teeth/raw bones. The amount of food an adult dog eats depends of the type diet you decide to feed it & the amount of exercise it has.|`|6qsocyK3aa	In the UK, docking and cropping is illegal and for good reason. It's cruel, out-dated and unnecessary. Plus it looks stupid. <br>  <br>  A note about tail-docking: dogs have tails for a reason; they help them to balance. To have it removed just because it's fashionable is selfish and cruel. You dog may have balance problems throughout its whole life.
iasOicRjaa	I think the crate training method is the best for any dog at any age.<br>  <br>  Consistency is the key to house training.|`|NAGiNKFWaa	Here are some tips, use what helps.  I use a crate* to potty train with, but only for potty training and then I break it down and store it.  I put blankets and a small food and water dish in the crate.  Dogs don't potty where they eat and sleep.  When they are first little, I only expect them to hold their potty for 4 hours, and then 6 hours, then 8 hours and so on.  So when they are first little, I set a timer or alarm clock to wake myself up at night to take them *out.  I only allow my puppy in the bedroom* or the living room, only one room at a time.  They have to graduate to more space.  If I allow them to have full run of the house, it will overwhelm them.  I take them out the same door each time.  I tie a dinner bell to the door handle.  Do not use a jingle bell as they could get their toe caught in it.  So when they are little, I ring the bell for them, and then open the door to go *outside to potty.  When they get bigger, I take their paw and whack the bell and open the door to go potty.  Eventually getting to the place where the puppy will ring the bell and let me know when they need to go potty.  Dogs want to please you, so it is your job to let them know what behaviors please you and what doesn't.  So when my puppy goes potty, I give her a treat*, and clap, and make a fuss and praise her.  So she learns that going potty outside makes me happy.  If she has an accident, make a disgust sound like “tsst” and take her out right away.  I never yell* or spank* my puppies.  Take them out when they first wake up, after they eat or drink, before nap, finish romping, when their activities change, or when they are sniffing around. Some puppies go pee right away, but may not go poop until 10 minutes later, so wait for the poop..  I have a little play time here, because sometimes I think they are done, and they are not.  Puppies train at their own pace.  While I may have a puppy that hasn't had an accident in several weeks, I don't let my guard down.  I don't expect my puppies to be "fully potty trained" until one-year-old.  If they have a setback, shake it off, and start over.  I only have my puppies in the crate when I am not watching them.  When I am sleeping, cooking, ironing, doing chores, basically when I am not watching her.  All other times, she is out of the crate practicing being a "big girl."  This is the time I train her how to behave in the house.  So we are practicing "no barking", 'no biting", "no jumping", and "don't eat the furniture."  I also have to practice "playing inside" so she doesn't knock over things.  You must keep the puppy in sight when they are little because they don’t know the difference between newspaper and carpet, and you don’t want them sneaking off and getting into trouble.   Some puppies can sleep through the night around 3-months-old, but their bladder is grown around 6-months-old. <br>    <br>  REVISIONS:  <br>  *I use a CRATE to train with.  It is the method I prefer, compared to other methods I have tried.  I noticed that if they are in the crate, while I am doing chores, they are o.k., because the crate allows them to see me and be re-assured.  The crate can also be a comfort when stored in the basement for dogs who live in areas where thunderstorms and tornados are an issue. .  However, use the method that works best for you.....a laundry basket, a cardboard box, a woof-woof house, x-pen, child gates, whatever works for you. <br>  *OUTSIDE, pee pad, litter box, whichever method you are using.   When the puppy is first little, keep the pee pad, litter box near the food and water dish, so the puppy can eat and drink, and then go potty.  You can move it away as they get older.  The pee pad has a scent that smells and initiates potty.  Sometimes a pee pad makes a sound that scares some puppies, so you might want to use a litter box if that happens.  The pee pad allows a puppy to walk around, but a litter box keeps the puppy in one place. <br>  *BEDROOMS, I use the bedroom and living room for training, because it works for me.  Choose rooms that work for you, but watch for rooms that are damp, or drafty.  While my puppies sleep in the bedroom during training, once they are trained, I let them sleep where they want to.  They don't have to sleep in the bedroom forever. <br>  *TREATS.  While I use treats for training, you don't have to.  I like Charlee Bears for training (a little cracker for a little mouth,) I use them for training, but once they are trained, I cut back on them.  <br>  *SOME PUPPIES will go potty in the same spot each time.  Some puppies have to be told to go potty.  A command like "go out" for pee, or "go finish" for poop, might work for you, keep saying “go finish” until the puppy poops.  This is a good thing to train if you travel with your dogs.  By using commands, the puppy won't get confused when you are visiting someone, on vacation with you, or when you get to a new home.  The command will tell them what you want them to do in an unfamiliar place.  You might also want to use a leash method, so the puppy doesn’t sneak off, or for strange places. <br>  *YELLING.  It is not a good idea to "yell" or "spank" your puppy and then take them outside when they have an accident.  They may get confused and think that going outside is punishment.  While you want to correct them, if you are extreme, they may not want to go outside again.  Shake it off, and resume your schedule.  You have to keep it real.  Puppies train at their own pace, but a puppy can only hold their potty for a few hours.  A guide would be 1 hour for each month of age, plus 1 hour, so a three-month-old puppy should only be expected to hold their potty for 4 hours at most.     <br>  SOURCE:  These tips, tricks, and ideas were contributed from many brilliant minds.  Thanks for your help!|`|f6be38fa4f0a14b54a53885b1dcdae82aa	Spend plenty of time and have lots of patience. GSDs are really smart and are usually easy to train. Crate training is good if you don't use the crate as a babysitter. It gives the dog a place to feel safe and keeps a puppy from getting into trouble while you are not there to watch them.<br>     You need to take the dog out every 2 hours or so (and about 20-30 min. after meals until you learn his potty schedule. Reward him with praise and small treats when he does his business outside. Do not scold him if he has an accident. Consider that your mistake in not reading his signs fast enough. Use the same door to exit and enter every time you take him out for a bathroom visit. That way he'll begin to associate the door with his need to go out. Keep the potty trips to "business only" outings. Play time should be separate until he learns the system.<br>    My shepherd (now 10) practically came trained. He has given us many years of pleasure. If only he had thumbs....|`|rXMTdUg4aa	The same way you would any other puppy... 4 months is a little old to just begin paper training.
KxjUim7yaa	If you adopt from a shelter you will be saving a life.<br>  You can give a forever home to some lucky dog.<br>  You can give training and love to one in need.<br>  The care you give will come back to you as unconditional love.|`|pzMWdVoLaa	take dog for Gard|`|zpjIjG5Waa	you should add your reasons first so you dont get duplicate answers|`|PM23RDycaa	Nope considering your HAVE at least ONE dog already.

o8LX83jVaa	you need to get a gravel vacuum. if you don't have gravel then you should just clean the tank by emptying out all the water and scrubbing it cause if you don't have gravel, which you should, you most likely don't have any beneficial bacteria in the tank.<br>  <br>  what size tank is it? what filtration? what fish? what decorations? plants?|`|szRr1fYbaa	Yea just use a gravel cleaner to take out 25% of the water and scrape the algae of of the front of the glass. your welcome. PS if there is left over fish food then you are feeding them to much it is better to underfeed than overfeed. give them as much as they can eat in 5 min if any is left then give them less food next time.|`|9d5CT2zyaa	Get a vacuum from the pet store. Its a long tube with a big opening on 1 end. You use to siphon water from your tank.<br>  <br>  When you use it, push it down into the gravel all around the tank and it will suck the poo out along with water. <br>  <br>  You can use this to do your weekly water change and get all the gunk out of your tank.|`|NwZ6yrq7aa	Get a gravel vac.  Mine has a 3x1 inch opening and water changes go by in a flash!  Get the water flowing through the vac and then just pass the gravel vac over your gravel.  Don't be too aggressive with the vac by pushing it to far into the gravel, you don't want to lose all of your beneficial bacteria.  Happy cleaning!|`|4qIzyIz4aa	you will have less problem with it if you have a cycling type of filter because it continously sucks the dirt at the bottom while giving oxygen in the tank. if you dont have that, just use a fine fish net instead,|`|jnzSz3tRaa	get a gravel vacuum and just run it along the bottom

They are not working titles or a breed championship.  Lots of dogs are breed quality, as you put it, but that doesn't make them breeding material.  <br>  <br>  Please SPAY & NEUTER.  When you first asked this question, you knew that you were about to be bashed.|`|wUg7iYU1aa	Then go to craigslist..... you don't need to breed your dog, you have no clue what you are doing, and there are thousands of labs in shelters. Leave it to the professional breeders.|`|FdcWPp48aa	You say a lot about your male, what has the female done to prove she would be adding good healthy puppies to the world?|`|zpjIjG5Waa	Okay this is just my opinion for what it's worth. I bred my Shih-tzu and know exactly the amount of time and effort it entails. If you or someone can't give these dogs 24/7 of your time you have no right to try and bred any animal. There is so much it involves. I'll just give you one example. When my dog was in the process of actually giving birth, one of the puppy's despite all of her mothers efforts would not breath.  If i wasn't right there next to her, that puppy would not have survived. There are so many things that can go wrong you need to educate yourself to all of them. House training takes a minimum of 8 weeks and you have to create a schedule for feeding and time outside. Breeding is very time consuming and if you can't be with those dogs all day every day. (and i don't mean to sound cold) but I don't care how pure or what medals either dog has. You don't have the right to breed them.<br>  Personally It was one of the best experiences of my life and more then worth it to me. But then again I was extremely careful, did a lot of research ahead of time, and those dogs controlled and ruled my life for almost 6 months. If you can't give it the same please don't do it.<br>  <br>  P.S. I kept the one that wouldn't breath, and that's the only one I can honestly say wasn't 100% healthy. I still have minor problems with her health today.|`|ba8dd4c6a9b532bef579aff3e8706fe7aa	Too many red flags here for me to believe you.|`|18f339d2d88d8a05cc418425220b52e1aa	Sometimes it is necessary to help him get 'it' in.  Just a slight guiding hand.
hdQvbs0naa	Carefresh is perfectly fine. People say it is dusty, but that's a matter of preference. Some people just don't like the dust, bgut that doesn't make it bad for them. As long as your rats aren't sneezing a lot, it's fine! <br>  <br>  The only BAD beddings are pine and cedar (aspen is not bad for them). Sawdust, as well, actually, because that can hurt their lungs. <br>  <br>  I use fleece blankets, which I like because I save money on buying bedding. Just wash and reuse. :]|`|65e71fbb06f5d33192d9789c626a3e49aa	As long as you avoid pine and cedar, anything else is your preference (and what your rats prefer of course).<br>  <br>  Aspen shavings are nice, in my opinion, and so are the recycled-newspaper-pellet things, and corncob bedding is another alternative.  I always gave my rats a big handful of toilet paper that they could use to shred and make a nest out of.  So if you can afford it, and you like it, and they like it, and it's not pine/cedar, then you're ok.|`|MG8MwZrIaa	I used to use aspen chips, but the vet told me that they're really bad for little critters.  She suggested Carefresh, so that's what I've been using.  It does seem a bit dusty when I dump it out of the bag, but my hamster loves it.  I tried to save some money once and bought the imitation brand at Walmart, called Critter Care... Avoid it!!  It's much cheaper, and comes in fun colors, but it smells horrible as soon as the critter pees on it.  The Carefresh smells so much better.  Good luck!|`|UlOKMInqaa	I use a product called "Eco Bedding". It has no dust, is very absorbent, and dries quickly. Your rats will love to nest in it, as well. I get mine at Petsmart and it's around $8 for the size of bag that I need for my three females which it lasts me about two cage cleanings, sometimes more.|`|A2IDiIpIaa	Hey,<br>  Aspen chips are acceptable but the absolute best (and what I use for my rats) is carefresh ULTRA. <br>  It is a bit more expensive but it is extremely high quality and very absorbent.<br>  Hope I helped<br>  Dad to three baby rat girls.|`|M9o5WpOqaa	Hi there.If you are having a dust problem with the regular Carefresh,I recommend Carefresh Ultra-it has less dust.My rats/hammies/piggies and rabbit love it-it's absorbent and much softer/more comfortable for them to snuggle up in.
IUM5XfPcaa	Mine was great!!!   BUT there are alot of things you need to know about them before you get one. They need TONS of exercise.. and not just walking them.. they need LOTS of room to run around.. <br>  They need a tall fence, cause they are escape artists..And they are mischievious.. they like to play games.. like keep away. Mine used to get my cell phone and not want to give it back.. <br>  She was able to open the front screen door and she would just RUN AND RUN AND RUN! <br>  They need alot of mental stimulation too.. games and such.<br>  one final note.... they shed.. A LOT. I mean they REALLY shed.<br>  My husky was wonderful. I loved her so much. Unfortuately i had to give her up because I didnt research the breed enough to know that my situation wasnt a good one for this type of dog. <br>  If you have the time and energy for this type of dog, I would say go for it. They are pack pack animals, but your family IS its pack.. they blend right into the family...  just watch because with our husky, she treated me and my husband as the alphas, but treated my child like she was her sibling. She would grab her clothes and pull her around trying to play with her.. and she got nipped a few times when the husky got too rough. I WAS just playing, though, so as long as you stay on top of the situation, it should be ok<br>  Good luck!|`|8584e0329fb17c662606d5a6a8650ee2aa	They are good pets for certain people but they can be a very challenging breed and are not for everyone.  They are high energy, need lots of exercise and training every day, generally do not do well with cats and other small animals as they tend to have high prey drive, and shed very heavily.  They do not thrive in hot climates and need protection from heat in places where there is hot weather.|`|1itC64nVaa	If you train them right, when they are a puppy, than definitely. They are great pets. And yes, I'm sure that husky's would love to have another play mate! If I was a husky (or even any dog)  I would get bored being alone. But as long as i have an owner or another dog (like a husky) I would be fine!|`|sYAMwcfmaa	They are very good pets as long as they are trained well. Huskies do not have to be in packs, you can own only one. But, the most important part is to be able to give your the exercise it needs to stay healthy and content. A big backyard is also helpful inkeeping your pet happy. <br>  <br>  Buying one as a puppy makes it more easy to train.<br>  <br>  But, either way Huskies make great pets whether alone or in a pack.|`|Re576Xa5aa	yes, you will need 2,. THey need more exersise than the averege pet owne can give|`|5NIXNq2haa	All dogs are pack animals :)|`|RPFaLzc0aa	I can tell you, it's good that you are investigating the breed of a dog before you buy it. It does make a difference. You could have never told me that until I did buy a Siberian Husky. They are not territorial dogs and they do not bark when someone knocks or comes around the house. They are also notorious escape artists and don't come when you call them. They also howl for quite a long period of time. They are beautiful though and the closest one can get to a gray wolf. I saw one that was pure white the other day with one brown eye and one blue eye. The one I had was red and white with blue eyes. Very pretty and we named him Nakoma.|`|HCQI5UARaa	It will be great if you work out a lot because this dog need lots of excise and lots of room .Buts a great thing that you are going to get a puppy then it can get used to every thing .
zpwJR60baa	Cat does not use the back paw for scratching... it will be ok.<br>  <br>  Other way to protect your furniture.. is double stick tape.  Safe for furniture, and safe for the cat. <br>  Have your cat nail trim|`|rXEVEfqHaa	Yes its normal!|`|1v9N9LJsaa	I highly recomend Feliway spray for your furniture and a scratching post &/or mat. I also like the comment about the double sided tape, but you still should give kitty a proper place to scratch because it's a natural behavior.<br>  <br>  The soft paws don't last very long, so if he/she lets you, trimming your cats nails, using the Feliway spray and strategically placing scratching posts and scratching mats close to where he/she likes to scratch your furniture should really help divert him/her from scratching the furniture.<br>  <br>  A combined approach has always worked for me!
lT3Aqt1Caa	ferrets that aren't trained will bite for several different reasons, i.e.scared or playing. they are easy to train when they are young, just like cats. this may sound silly but firmly tap her nose, say no, maybe even try spray bottles. believe it works, you train them just like dogs and cats.|`|28a4c7095a375d84642d6cf86c0d5a84aa	Never wake a ferret when they are sleeping. Let them smell your hand first so they know it is you and not dinner.  If he always bits feed him first and once finished and before he sleeps gently pick him up. If not handled daily to begin with he will be nippy.
EeJMITyCaa	Why make your husband unhappy just so you can get another dog. You already have two. Of course he is going to resent the dog because doesn't want one. If your husband doesn't want more than two then you should be happy with the two you have. Marriage is about compromises and it sounds like a pretty good compromise that you have two of them already.|`|FXeuwkX0aa	Rescue a doggy- there are many who need homes.<br>  <br>  Cumon- You girls know how to talk us into anything.|`|add1238669d46216eb94b39fb19e0553aa	i also think the more the merrier when it comes to animals but every individual person has there limit. my family lives with 6 dogs and some days i would love to add to them and some days i would love to subtract a few. if 2 dogs works for your husband then i would say stay with 2 dogs why create a problem where there isnt one.|`|NAGiNKFWaa	No, you  really shouldn't adopt another dog if everyone in the family isn't on board.  Your husband has valid reasons for not wanting another dog and if you just go off and get another one, he is going to resent you and that dog, and his stress will be passed to that dog.  I don't think there is anything wrong with wanting another dog, but if your husband doesn't want it, it would be a huge mistake.|`|gCBqdHf2aa	I wouldn't. I currently have four pits and three cats and recently gave my snake a better home, <br>  I tell you it is a real headache, as much as I love them all. I can only take out one dog at a time ( such as to the park) and doesn't make it fair for the others, and it is alot of food and alot of poop to clean up.|`|AA12352550	My husband is the same way!! Just keep sweet talking him!!! I have 2 Pugs and I still want more!!!|`|6cZeMyyFaa	I don't think there is anything wrong with wanting more dogs. I can understand why your husband might feel the way he does about it, though. It's like having another baby, and the "could i love another as much as i love these?" syndrome.<br>  <br>  As long as you have the money and the time to have another dog keep thinking about it and see if he would change his mind over time. I'm sure once you got another dog he would fall in love with it like he does the others.|`|yyf5N7Ogaa	You need to be in agreement before you get another dog. One of the questions we ask on our Breed Rescue adoption form is "are all persons living in the household in agreement about adopting this dog?" This is because too often when there is disagreement, the dog ends up being returned. <br>  <br>  Three dogs does really change the dynamic of the relationships and can sometimes be good and sometimes be very bad.|`|I021AfMbaa	No, adopt your third dog after fullfilling the responsibilities of the first and second, that is till their passing day. <br>  <br>  Don't give to another what you'll take away from one, that is time and effort, companionship and love.|`|TXmAx8jwaa	Do what you thinks best, but seriously two dogs is enough, thats what i think anyway.|`|BCRNnk8Gaa	no I wouldn't, the economy is bad, you may have to start eating their food to survive and well more dogs means less food|`|1IVEYMA9aa	Dogs are good in small proportions. I would say stay with the two dogs.|`|8584e0329fb17c662606d5a6a8650ee2aa	I agree with everyone who says that all in the family should be in agreement when adding a family pet.  I also work with a humane society and we want to see all family members interact with the new animal and be sure everyone is in agreement.  It's a big commitment.  Too many dogs and cats get returned because of disagreements and resentments that come up later when things don't go perfectly.<br>  <br>  Another consideration is that all of your animals and people are doing well together right now and adding another animal really does change things.  In my experience, the change from a two dogs to three is much bigger than going from one dog to two.  The situation becomes much more like a dog pack and less like a family of humans with a couple of dogs and the dynamics and relationships change.  So adding a third dog could really change the relationships between you and your current dogs and between your current dogs themselves.  This can be worked on, but it's a big project.<br>  <br>  Talk about it some more but don't do it unless your husband is 100% on board for all of your sakes.|`|rDb9ZLyfaa	I love animals too and would adopt 6 dogs if I had the room and means,  but I do have 2 dogs right now and 3 cats.  My husband would kill me and I wouldn't blame him if I brought in another dog.  I would just put it on the back burner until he says it would be ok ...don't push the issue.<br>  There is nothing wrong with you for wanting more animals but it just isn't reasonable unless you are a millionaire and have unlimited funds and time for all of them|`|fWbMoxBXaa	If your husband doesn't want one, then just don't get one right now. You should respect his wishes.|`|CgEQAgXhaa	I had the same problem with my husband when we got our 2nd dog.  He wasnt really into having two but I wanted a playmate for our dog.  He was so hyper and always wanting to play and I felt like i was neglecting him if I couldnt play.  I waited for my hubby to go out of town and 'surprised' him with a puppy he always wanted as a kid.  A blue heeler.  He was upset at first but now he cuddles with her and plays with her and loves her just as much as our first dog.  Make sure you have enough room in your home for a third dog.  And in your life.|`|zpjIjG5Waa	Do me a favor and e-mail me the answer when you get a good one. I'm in exactly the same boat. I have two Shih-tzu's and i definitely want another. I love my two girls to death and would truly like another puppy. My husband is steadfast in saying no even though 3 years ago we had 3 dogs before his dog passed. I can't figure this one out either even though i know for a fact we and our home can handle it.

It must be a local one in your area.<br>  <br>  I have worked with several different ones here & they all seem to operate about the same.  Most don't have kennels to keep the dogs in so they foster them out.  I am in a foster program & have a dog every now & then when they need a large area for a large dog.  I have three of my own.|`|020573c2b8f6f31da5d9ac91c3b09ee6aa	never heard of this one. i belong to about 10 others.
nq4cwGwiaa	That would be great, I would go to the mini zoo, or collect them all :)|`|OEQRASrbaa	I didn't see the movie, so I don't know how small you're talking, but maybe. I mean, you figure all domestic dogs came from a wolf-like creature thousands of years ago. And we managed to get tiny yorkies and chihuahuas from that. There's even three different sizes of schnauzer.<br>  <br>  So if they could find a way to captive-breed lions for years and somehow stunt their growth repeatedly, then maybe. But it wouldn't be in our lifetime.
qHwI9ev8aa	Your betta won't make a bubble nest immediately. Give him time to settle in to his new place. Make sure his bowl is in a warm spot that doesn't get direct sun and if there's room in the bowl, get him a plant (real or artificial). He'll soon start prepping for his never to arrive lady!|`|wnnudNp5aa	Some males make nests all the time, others never do. If you just got him yesterday, for sure he isn't comfortable in his environment yet. He'll need a couple of weeks to settle in and get used to his new digs. <br>  Since it seems this is probably your first Betta, I urge you to go to  a book store, pet store, or your public library and get a book or two about Bettas. You can then learn everything you need to know to keep your little friend healthy and happy for many years to come. Good luck!|`|dE5fs9yzaa	People! Give the poor fish a break! You just got him and expect a bubble nest right away? He won't do much till he starts to feel comfortable in his surroundings. Are you wanting to breed him? If not, don't worry about a nest. Some males never build nests.|`|o8LX83jVaa	first, you got it yesterday.<br>  second, only mature males will make a bubble nest<br>  third, there has to be a male and a female in close proximity but not in the same tank for the male to make a bubble nest<br>  <br>  i had a male betta and a female betta in a tank with a separation piece and the male never made a bubble nest.|`|NwZ6yrq7aa	Make sure your betta is a male.  Probably is, it's more commonly sold.  Then give him some time.  Do you have a heater?  Betta's are tropical fish and need warm waters, about 75-78 degrees.  How big is your tank/bowl?  The bigger the better.  Mine are in 2.5 gallon tanks.  A gentle flow filter is beneficial, but if you keep up on water changes they aren't completely necessary.  2 of my betta's fins are so long ANY filter is too strong.  I just do 2 water changes a week and suck out any poop I see daily.  So: male, heat, time, and as much clean water that you can provide.  Just be patient.  Happy waiting!|`|PGq1Jm4Maa	Is it a female,and is it pregnant???<br>  ._.<br>  Is there a male and a female?<br>  Why am i even answering this....|`|EkPZBEvaaa	Male bettas only make a bubble nest when they are content with their encvironment and healthy, or in the presence of a female betta. If you just got it, dont expect anything for up to 2 weeks. I have i male that never made a nest-had it for 2 years- and another that has kept one all his life-even make it again within the hour after water changes, but he's happy, playful, healthy active and gets dried worm as treat. try buying these if he's not making anything in a week. A nest is a good indicator of health and happiness so encouraging is not wrong, but if he doesn't want to make one, you simply wont be able to make him.|`|WnDWrEiOaa	don't rush
Rw7gi86Naa	To keep cats out of the garden, the best thing to do first is to lay some soft netting down in rows in between all the flowers. You can use chicken wire also. Put several rocks at the edge of the netting to keep it in place better. You can sprinkle a thin layer of soil over the netting, and use decorative rocks so it‘s not obvious why they are there. If any cat tries to dig in the soil, their claws will get stuck in the netting, (or wire). Next, you can apply some repellent to the rocks. You can purchase some cat repellent at any pet store. Cats don’t like the smell of citrus fruit, so it is an excellent deterrent for gardens and plants. Citrus scented cleaners can be another means of keeping cats out of your garden. Be aware that you will need to re-apply this occasionally since the scent will wash off with water.<br>  <br>  Another idea that may involve less maintenance but more money is to set up sprinklers attached to motion sensors. So when the cat walks near the garden, the sprinklers will turn on, scaring the cat away.<br>  <br>  ** NEVER USE MOTHBALLS, because they can harm the cat. Mothballs are composed of naphthalene and/or paradichlorobenzene; both are toxic substances. By law in the US, pesticides can not be used for purposes other than stated on the label. Mothballs are a pesticide. Scattering them over the yard for repelling animals is definitely not on the label. Mothballs have been implicated in several poisonings of small children who mistake them for candy. The label almost certainly states that they are not to be placed where they can be accessed by children. They could also be hazardous for animals such as cats and dogs. **<br>  <br>  ** Burying orange or lemon peels may deter cats, but it may attract other animals such as raccoons. **|`|zQB0kEmcaa	When you see them in your garden throw water on them - they hate that.|`|C8Djjxqkaa	Get a cat. They are using it as it is neutral/disputed territory. If you have a cat then then it will fight and keep them out.|`|x3RBy8Ljaa	Cats hate citrus and particularly cherry,  put citrus peels all over the place and if you want you can also put some moth balls in your garden area if you toddlers don't go there.<br>  <br>  You can always get a dog or turn on sprinklers when you see them|`|UNFxjNHkaa	try putting citrus peels in your garden.  I've never had this problem, but I heard that citrus peels work.. try that.. cats apparently do not particularly like the smell of them|`|zpwJR60baa	Call the animal care control.. they can give you advice..|`|f10424ac1ac7b1791b4f665094823d61aa	What about a sonic deterrent?   They start at about ￡15 but they work really well.    <br>  <br>  Cat's just hate the sound they give off and will steer well clear of your garden.<br>  <br>  It might be worth the investment as they last forever.

Don't get a dog to chase them away, that's just retarded. Another, don't get a cat to fight them off for you. All the cats could end up seriously hurt and you don't need/want that.<br>  <br>  Anyways, just call animal control to see if they have any advice. Or maybe you could call the Human Society to see if they know of anyone that could come and pick the cats up and take them off to be adopted.|`|Z8mmsOIqaa	Many animal control agencies will take the cats away but you must trap them first.  <br>  <br>  The only other thing I can suggest is just waiting for them and shoot them in the rear with an air rifle (its funny and they tend to stay away after too) It just stings them.<br>  <br>  To keep cats out of my plants I have also put spikes in the ground and I have also laid out tape sticky side up so they get tangled in it.<br>  <br>  They don;t come around my house much anymore|`|ZLQ6X0oOaa	A MASSIVE DOG!!!!!!<br>  <br>  orrrrrr.... you can buy plants like these<br>  <a href="http://www.gardeningdirect.co.uk/Coleus-Scaredy-Cat/XF182,default,pd.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.gardeningdirect.co.uk/Coleus-...</a>|`|sZ0McynSaa	Plot Saver.<br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.messinawildlife.com/index.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.messinawildlife.com/index.php</a>|`|NImJALxgaa	Buy a dog.<br>  <br>  They'll get rid of cats and are fun pets.|`|f1lpdiNEaa	Try putting orange peel on the soil.

I bought some granules that stank a bit from Homebase - they worked, but it costs about ￡4 a tub, and if it rains you have to re-spread them, so it was costing about a tenner a week. I then heard that cats didn't like citrus, so grated oranges and spread that all over the places they offended in most - that didn't work. <br>  <br>  I then got my own cat, because cats aren't supposed to go in their own garden, and their scent should deter other cats. Would you bloody believe it, not only do the other cats still do their business in my garden - my cat does aswell the git. Poisening or shooting do seem attractive alternatives...
3bf821ff353c216ffc93ff7a91b60828aa	Are they cone shaped?  Sounds like Malaysian trumpet snails, from you saying they hide in the gravel and come out at night.  They're actually not bad, and a lot of people want them.  Sell them on ebay, that's where I ended up buying mine.  They're good because they sift through the substrate, which is great if you have live plants.  They're also great at cleaning up any leftover food that gets trapped down in the substrate.  And, they're great at algae control, and won't touch your live plants.  They may eat pieces of algae growing on them, but they won't eat the plants.  I had a tank with some green spot algae on it, can't scrub the stuff off...they cleaned it right off with no problem.  I'm only telling you that, because not all snails are bad pests.  And, they're not hermaphroditic, so they need a male/female to breed, which is good.<br>  <br>  The pet store was right, the rid a snail chemical products are pretty harsh, and can kill your fish as well.  Mine love algae wafers and shrimp pellets.  What you can do, drop some in after the lights go out, and wait a few hours and then you can just scoop up a bunch with the food, they'll all be congregated on the pieces of food.  I would try to sell them if you want to make a few bucks, or just give them away, they'll survive a few days in the mail as long as it's not too hot/cold outside.  <br>  <br>  As to why you have them all of a sudden....nothing new recently added to the tank-fish, plants, rocks, etc.?  If not, then my guess is you've had them all along and never noticed them-since they hide during the day, or that drum you got from the pet store-maybe they had used it before for something and there was snails in there.  <br>  <br>  And, too late now-maybe useful for the future, but there was no need to move all the water with everything.  As long as you keep the filter media wet, all you needed was enough water to move the fish in, and just let them adjust to the new water at your new house.|`|dE5fs9yzaa	They came in on your plants, i assume are live? If not, they came in on something. Outside of a rid-snail type medication, I would removed the gravel and wash eveyrhting to make sure I got rid of the snails. i know, you need to recycle but you could have some water aging and just put up with the snails until the water is ready.|`|svrFBaENaa	Piece of lettuce in a veggie clip. Put it in before you go to bed, pull it out in the morning. A lot of the snails should be attached to it. I've heard it works. Never had to do it myself as my Betta loves to eat snails. She literally sucks them right out of their shell. It keeps my snail population in check.|`|WnDWrEiOaa	yeah i agree with the above answer|`|9d5CT2zyaa	Just before night put a big peice of cucumber in a veggie clip and then turn off all the lights. Come back in several hours and you will have a lot of snails on the cucumber so take it out and dispose of them.<br>  <br>  Just keep doing this until you get your problem under control.<br>  <br>  If you don't want to dispose of the snails i would recommend selling them. Some people use snails in their tank to take care of their algae problem.|`|d8f443bc582285db859040a0c5e47adcaa	don,t use the chemical snail killer that shops offer you,they do kill the snails but can be lethal to certain fish and the dead snails cause pollution,unless everything is treated you will not get rid of all,clown loaches would eventually do the job but do you want them?i used a trick from an old fish keeper  who use to tape a small piece of raw meat[very small]in a saucer and put it meat side down on the gravel at lights out.first thing in the morning he would lift the saucer and put a net under it before lifting out of the tank.the meat is hard to eat and was still there covered in snails and i mean covered!!!try it it really does work.this method will not remove all of them but regularly done more than controls them.<br>   hope this helps|`|QV6swGUMaa	i have the same problem as you so i do.last night i read to put a piece of lettuce under a sauceror on weighed down with a rock .when the lights go off they will all head for the lettuce.give it 6 hours with lights off and when ya go back there should be loads i got 10 this morning and i bough a puffer for my other tank to eat them all up :)
31e3aeeef48254ed515aa846df344c44aa	If she's really skittish (and does she act that way with fireworks, too?), your vet may prescribe sedatives.  These are generally pretty safe, and most dogs react well to them.  <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|NAGiNKFWaa	We make the room as dark as possible, and play music loud.  you might consider a crate, some dogs feel safe in their crate, or a closet.  With Andy I use melatonin, walmart pharmacy, 1 milligram per 10 pounds of dog.  You might try covering the ears, maybe with a scarf or something so she can't hear the noise, and rubbing her with a dryer sheet, the static from the storm bothers them.|`|RN1wGlWWaa	By "comforting" her during a storm, you are actually making it worse - by telling her its something to be afraid of.  Try to distract her with toys, treats, and other things then to hold and pet her.<br>  <br>  You should act as normal and unafraid as the pack leader.  The dogs take clues from us as the leaders.  Our lab is very scared of thunderstorms because she was left outside during them before we got her.  We have tried to just pretend its nothing scary and may give her a few pats or distract her with some ball throwing.<br>  <br>  She normally doesn't come in our bedroom as she doesn't like to walk on the floor (uncarpet) but if the storm is at night, she will come in and lay tight by the bed on the floor to be near us.|`|fuI8RhhVaa	If you know a thunderstorm is coming, give her something to occupy her mind. Give her a bone, or whatever, and when the thunderstorm comes, just remain calm, and just keep pressing her down to stay in that spot, and keep showing her that bone or toy. If she ignores it and goes completely wild, always remember to stay calm. Instead of letting her run around the house, try and keep her confined to a small area of the house, where you can keep practicing this. Just keep holding her down and giving the toy or bone (never treats, that reinforces the habit) and hopefully sooner or later she will get it.|`|RPp3WVOnaa	My Lhasa Apso gets scared during thunderstorms too.  My vet told me that holding him and petting him and talking to him like a baby didnt help at all but only reinforced the behavior. He told me to talk to her normally and try playing with her and distracting her. I dont know that this has been 100% effective in my situation. Crating him with a soft blanket inside and placing a blanket over the crate and leaving the front part of the crate uncovered generally calms him.  Best Wishes!!|`|6SeWCfUfaa	Some dogs never get over that, but ... holding her and petting her only reinforces the behavior.  <br>  <br>  I had a dog that was a total wimp about thunder storms.  But, she was crate trained and if I left her crate up with some soft stuff to lay down on, she's seek refuge in there during storms.  She'd still shake and whine some, but at least she wasn't bouncing around the house like a total moron.|`|AA11750243	Yes, if you act normally your dog will be calmer. If you baby him, he will not feel any better. Try distracting him by playing or try turning up the tv or play music. My dog is scared of fireworks and I know this works with her.|`|UzJRCEEFaa	when you see it approaching, start playing loud music while cleaning, and the dog may see that as normal routine, music will drown out most thunders,<br>  <br>  until the power goes out.
IRaIxWJKaa	If they're not tiny balls of grit (flea poop), and are flat, it may just be dirt in the depressions of the skin.  Skin is dimpled somewhat, and it can accumulate dirt.  <br>  <br>  Yours is being treated for stomatitis?  Has he been checked for feline bartonella?  A number of cats with bad mouths actually have feBart, which is treatable with that 21 day course of antibiotics.  It resembles Stomatitis, which is not easily treated, and both show up when the immune system is really low in a cat.  The bartonella is spread via fleas and can sit in the cat/'s system for years. The stoma is a reaction of the cat's immune system going wonky.  <br>  <br>  Just on the off chance that it may be Bartonella, the next time your cat has a full blood panel, ask them to check for it.|`|QPKgc1xJaa	Give the cat a bath sounds like embedded dirt.|`|uzZuwtgXaa	If he regularly goes out then it may be dirt bits.|`|kw1bBNqlaa	I read in Cat Fancy one time, that cats get acne except its brown (instead of red/pink like humans) so he might have cat acne.|`|Z8mmsOIqaa	it could just be how his body gets rid of unnecessary elements, like we seep oil from our pores, or some people have dandruff.|`|oT71QN8Raa	Are the specs raised...like, can you actually feel them or do they seem to be part of the skin until you scrap them off?  Does your litter clump?  If so, it could be wet litter getting all over him.

f10424ac1ac7b1791b4f665094823d61aa	Maz, I think you should allow your cat to carry on doing this if she wants to.<br>  <br>  It is not going to do her any harm and it is giving her comfort of some kind.   If you try to stop her she may become anxious or neurotic because she will not understand why she is not allowed to do it.<br>  <br>  The saggy bits will not hurt her or be troublesome to her in anyway.    It is a bit unusual for a cat to do this, but not unheard of.   Some cats love to suck and she has decided that it's her nipples that she likes best.|`|rXEVEfqHaa	Its probably just a comfort thing. Very interesting though because I've never heard or seen a cat do this. I've heard of them sucking on peoples armpits and things but not their own nipples. lol<br>  When you see her do it you could tell her no and pull her head away from her nipples or as a vet on what to do. I'm sure theirs something out there that you could put on her to make her nipples taste nasty. OH yes its called Bitter Apple  It tastes disgusting. <br>  <a href="http://www.1800petmeds.com/Bitter+Apple-prod10575-10575.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.1800petmeds.com/Bitter+Apple-...</a><br>  I've used it on a dog awhile back and it worked well!<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|oT71QN8Raa	Normal...no.  Sign of rabies, definitely NOT.  But I don't think there's anything wrong with it necessarily.  I had a goat once that used to do that.  We never figured out why, but it never hurt her nor made her unhealthy in any way.  The nipples did get chapped from all the wet/dry/wet/dry action.  So would the "sagging bits" you are refering to be skin chapping off?  The only thing you'd have to worry about here is if any skin comes off prematurely and causes and open wound (just like chapped lips sometimes bleed) and possibly being infected.  Have you talked to a vet?  If you just call them, they will usually give over-the-phone consults and obviously don't charge for that.  You can give them this info and see if it really is anything to worry about.  I don't think it is - but I am of course not a vet :)|`|iBafHj32aa	Cats are odd.. I used to have 2 kittens and the little one used to suck its brothers toes..

I'd check with the vets just to make sure as I've never heard of them sucking them selves...|`|lpllr9MDaa	I have seen this behavior in a cat once before.  I think it's harmless, but I wouldn't necessarily call it 'normal'.  If you are concerned, you should talk to your vet.|`|x3RBy8Ljaa	Cats are odd in deed.  I have an 11 month old female that when she needs comfort she nurses off the throws or cushions of the sofa.|`|3L2DHgv4aa	This is a sign of extreme stress and anxiety. There are some products on the retail market that may help reduce these feelings. Make sure she is warm and comfortable and has lots of toys to play with to distract her. Being a year old, she should be just about grown out of this behavior, but if she persists, please see your vet about possible medical treatment, like sedatives.|`|u7Dy2qOkaa	Ugh, don't believe what the first person said. You would know if your cat had rabies. Don't have it put down.<br>  <br>  I really have no idea what to tell you except that it's just a comfort thing like you said. I mean, I've seen cats do this and they've lived normal healthy lives. :/ Sorry hun.
tPGxPDvBaa	The sun causes a chemical reaction to the skin.  Same thing happens to your skin. You also smell from being outside. Plus their coat can pick up & hold odors.  The smell is stronger on some dogs than others & nothing you can do about it - just part of nature & owning a dog.|`|BI428TcBaa	He's probably sweating. When did you last bathe the dog?|`|rwziaAm4aa	Actually, dogs don't sweat except for their paws. If I had to guess from your description of dead fish smell, I would say your dog expressed his anal glands. This happens to some dogs when they are overly excited or scared. It happens often to smaller dogs to since their poop is smaller and doesn't express the glands normally so the glands build up the stink juice. You can get the vet or groomer to express (squeeze out) the anal glands for about 20 -30 us dollars.<br>  <br>  I would smell the dogs rear area to see if this is the source of the smell, also research a little about anal glands to see if this is the smell you think you are getting.
OxFsslN8aa	Remember that puppies explore things with their mouths in order to learn what they are.  Dogs first use thier nose to smell something and then their mouths to investigate it.  I think it is important to allow time for your dog to explore when you take a walk - allow him to pick up leaves & sticks and gently guide him away from things that are not good to put in his mouth.

Prior to that your walks should be about listening, looking & learning.|`|RPp3WVOnaa	The leave it command is a good one to teach if done with a firm voice (not loud or mean) and done with a firm but not harsh tug on the leash and plenty of praise and a treat for their good behavior.

Have someone drop a piece of food a few feet away.  When the pup goes for it, then give a sharp pull back and say LEAVE IT in a firm stern voice.  When he stops trying to take it, then allow him to go over and take it on a "release" of OK.<br>  <br>  Do this a few times and keep doing it till he ignores the treat on the floor no matter if its a foot away or 5 feet away.  Once he knows the command, then its easy outside to get him to ignore things.<br>  <br>  Our lab can have treats dropped right in front of her now, and she will look at me for the release command before taking them.
oT71QN8Raa	Check him for injury - cats purr when they are in pain too sometimes.  If he and his brother were rough housing at all this morning or last night, he may have hurt himself.  As long as he is eating and drinking water and using his "toilet" (try to catch him using it, to make SURE he is) then give it a day and then call a vet to make an appointment.  If its a minor injury, he'll be normal in a day.|`|cTYAYrb9aa	Maybe there is something he dislikes about being picked up?<br>  <br>  My cat doesn't like being picked up when she has eaten or had an upset stomach.|`|x3RBy8Ljaa	If his behavior hasn't changed except for when you pick him up maybe now he doesn't like it.

Please take him to the vet.  He depends on you.<br>  <br>  When it comes to pets, err on the side of caution.|`|3klcE6Gjaa	I agree with the other answers to just keep an eye on him, and to double check that he doesn't have any injuries.<br>  <br>  One of our cats meows every time you pick her up, and squeeks, even.  It sounds like it's hurting her, but she does it no matter how carefully you pick her up.  Never figured out why.  Just think it's a personality trait of hers.<br>  <br>  Due to the cowering of your cat, however, I'll assume either something frightened him, or he got hurt a little.  My cat, when he was a kitten, LOVED to be handled, but as he got older, he started acting very paranoid of everything for no real reason as we're a very loving family to him.  Once he gets over his fear stage, he goes right back to purring and following us around.  It's rather odd.

6eed3c6ed1117fe6baa4febd3849d742aa	Poor thing!  There are so many things to which dogs can be allergic, and it's so expensive to go through allergy testing, but it may be your only answer.  With your dog at such a young age, it is a very worthy investment.<br>  <br>  Is it a constant thing, or can you figure out any trigger times or circumstances?<br>  <br>  Since it isn't fleas, I would still experiment with diet.  I had a cocker that suffered allergies to something in addition to fleas.  We tried different foods for ages, and it wasn't until we discovered Orijen (and later Evo) that the scratching stopped.  Totally!  I tried to figure out what the offending agent was, and the only thing that was clearly obvious was corn.  But lots of dogs have problems with wheat.  There are so many possibilities.<br>  <br>  Cool baths give temporary relief while you are sorting it out, and dogs usually benefit nicely from Benadryl.  Check the web for recommended veterinary dosages, it is surprisingly high.  They also get relief from hydrocortisone ointment.  Once the skin is broken,  infection becomes the first line of attack in treatment, and the vet can administer a hydrocortisone shot.<br>  <br>  But none of these procedures are a permanent fix, which is why you need to know the source of the irritation.  Good luck!|`|OxFsslN8aa	The key is to find out why she scratches.  I will tell you my story - my golden retriever started itching & got black skin under his belly.  Two local vets looked at him & said he had allergies & prescribed Prednisone (a steroid) and antibiotics.  After two rounds of the antibiotics nothing was better so I searched online.  What I found after 60+ hours of research was that my dog had an intestinal yeast infection and the antibiotics actually made it worsen.  I found that his diet had grains & starches which fed the yeast infection.  I found a grain free - starch free food & started giving Acidopholus pills and AZO (women's yeast pills).  After about 9 months he was clear & itch free.  <br>  <br>  The reason I tell the story is because it isn't always what it appears to be and you should keep looking until you find the cause for the itching.  The stress that itching causes on a dog can lead to behavior pproblems if left unsolved.  Good luck.|`|zpjIjG5Waa	Sounds like allergies to me or possible a skin disorder. You need to take her to the vet and find our which it is<br>  <br>  By the way what food did you switch to. So many out their even what they consider good dog food have fillers in them that can cause allergic reactions.

bQisGgSsaa	She might not be hunrgy or she might don't have a taste for that kind on Dog Food.|`|asEeCmzraa	Put her on a supervised feeding schedule. 20 minutes, twice a day is all the food should be down for. Once that 20 minutes is up, the food goes. If the dog is still eating after 20 minutes, take away the food as soon as she wanders away. She will quickly learn that she gets fed what you feed her, when you feed her. No healthy dog will starve itself. If the dog goes without eating its own food for more than three days, take her to a vet. <br>  Do not allow her to eat the puppy's food. If she tries, stop her. A dog shouldn't eat out of another dogs bowl. You could also feed them separately, one inside, one outside or in different rooms.|`|AA10973353	Of course she's eating the puppy food.  It tastes much better than the adult food!  First, you need to quit trying all different kinds of food, you'll have her stomach in an uproar and she'll not want anything to eat.  Second, quit free feeding both of them.  Feed them 3 times a day, seperate them when you feed them, even if you have to crate them to eat, put their food down for 15 minutes, whatever they don't eat, take it up, and put it down at the next feeding.  She won't starve herself.  It's a dog's natural instinct to eat.  And, when she realizes she's not going to get the puppy food, eventually she'll get hungry enough to eat her own.  No dog should ever be free fed.  It's not healthy for them to just be able to eat whenever they want to. Some dogs even have an over-eating trait, and will eat themselves to death, literally.  Some dogs that have this trait:  pug, beagle bassett, dachshund...just about any hound dog.  The best thing you can do for both these dogs, is control their diet.  Each bag of food you have will tell you the amount of food to feed per day, based on their weight and age. Follow that recommendation, and feed them seperately.  Hope this helps|`|1itC64nVaa	Sometimes if you put like tuna juice or gravy in hard food, then she might realize that the food tastes really good, and will eat it.

It could be that your dog is having dental problems. This was the case for my dog recently, granted he is quite a bit older.

Don't know if it could be the same thing with your dog.|`|P3eXNNqLaa	Check with your vet first. But an eating schedule is the way to go. This is a common result of free feeding.

It can be hard.|`|stg7DVZ7aa	I think it's the best idea that you separate the puppy's food from her food and see what happens when they eat their meals away from each other.

My name is Rebecca, and I rescued a labrador mix named Spike from a shelter around eight months ago.  He had terrible behavior when I got him, including barking all night, going to the bathroom inside, and being aggressive towards other animals.  I went the local trainer route with no success.  It was nothing more than a waste of time and a lot of money.  Next I spent even more time and money on the course from a famous "tv dog trainer".  I didn't see *any* improvement from there.  Finally, after six months of frustration, I found a guide that worked.  I put my story online so that hopefully I can save other people the time, money, and unneeded tears that I went through.

Never ignore a dogs natural instincts, they usually know better then you do whats good for them. I can't see how its gonna hurt her. Puppy food is usually richer in vitamins and minerals. I would take her to the vet and see if there's something going on that you can't see. But meantime if she's eating the puppy food let her. <br>  I learned a big lesson with food while my dog was pregnant years ago. She too stopped eating. Sheesh i was down to boiling chicken for her and she still turned her nose up on it.  Then one day i was eating bagels with Lox and cream cheese and she started begging me for some. While looking at her as if she was crazy (she never begged for food like that) it dawned on me... what is in Lox and cream cheese but Omega 3 fatty acids ie: Fish oil and dairy. EXACTLY what a pregnant dog needs most in their diet. She was just telling me with the six puppy's in her belly what her body was craving. when your dog starts to act strange there's usually something their trying to tell you if you listen hard enough.

AA11992723	If the dog is a puppy, nipping is probably due to teething. If an adult dog, he never learned bite inhibition. If you tried to stop the dog by hitting and screaming, the dog bit you in fear.

How old is your son?  Does your dog behave in all other ways?  What was the circumstances of the biting at your son?  <br>  <br>  Dogs have a very hard time with children because children are like the dogs on the lowest end of the pack hierarchy.  Children don't usually establish dominance with dogs.  Children have high pitched voices and jerky movements which confuse dogs.  In a wolf pack a dominant dog will nip at a submissive dog's muzzle as a correction.  Domesticated dogs will bite at the face of a small child because the face is usually close to them & it's a natural instinct.  <br>  <br>  I would suggest obedience classes (if you haven't ever done them) because those classes teach you and the dog how to interact as a pack - you being the leader.  I would also suggest that you not trust your dog alone with your child simply because the dog has given a warning about how it will behave if frustrated or anxious.  <br>  <br>  The best thing for the dog is to learn how you want it to behave - they don't know unless taught with kindness & patience.  Good luck.|`|dPlbLOgYaa	Nipping or bitting as a puppy can be caused by different factors. I have a 135 lb.

bf5084d1ec35330c95ff7b7bd883bbffaa	Forget about using the chemicals sold by pet stores to make your aquarium water clearer.  As you've already seen, they give marginal results.<br>  <br>  I have had excellent results using a Magnum 330 power filter (external) with the blue & white filter cartridge (looks like a HEPA filter for water).  If that doesn't do it for you, you can add a few teaspoons of diatomaceous earth to the same filter cartridge and that will definitely clear your water of any particulates that are causing the cloudiness down to microns in size.<br>  <br>  ADDED LATER:  You can keep your existing filter.  Just use the Magnum 330 with diatomaceous earth when you see you're getting cloudy water.  They make a special hanger for the Magnum filters so you can hang it temporarily on the side of your tank for as long as necessary.  On a 75 gallon tank, it may take about 2-3 hours max, before the tank becomes completely clear.<br>  <br>  ...or if you want, you can keep the Magnum 330 running constantly as well.  I use only an undergravel filter with a powerhead attached, and a Magnum 330 on my home aquarium full time.|`|7guIba8paa	how are u heating the water ur adding i took advice on using my hot tap but i found it made the water cloudier also u know u'l be upgrading again coz them loaches get BIG|`|4CMx1uzXaa	Change your water filter or clean the tank with one of them magnet wipe things.|`|6t68dbfoaa	Try activated carbon in your Fluval.

Flocculents can contain nasty things like aluminum that you don't want in your tank.  Don't use them.<br>  <br>  "...you can add a few teaspoons of diatomaceous earth to the same filter cartridge and that will definitely clear your water of any particulates that are causing the cloudiness down to microns in size..."<br>  <br>  Diatom filters are great for clarity, but this is a bit risky, so be careful.  DE will increase the backpressure on your filter greatly!  Note that there are different grades of DE, so use the coarsest if you do that.  Personally, I would not toss DE in any filter except one designed for DE - too much risk of clouding the water with DE if it slips through your other media, or breaking the pump due to increased backpressure, or restricting flow rate to the point that your water is not effectively filtered and begins to stagnate, or gunking up all your other media to the point that you have to throw it all away.<br>  <br>  Use a micron filter pad instead, like this:<br>  <a href="http://www.drsfostersmith.com/product/prod_display.cfm?pcatid=4353" rel="nofollow">http://www.drsfostersmith.com/product/pr...</a><br>  I assume that micron filter pads are finer than your 'polishing pads' but if not, ignore that suggestion.<br>  <br>  The important questions here, in my opinion, are these:<br>  What color is the cloudiness?<br>  Do you overfeed?<br>  Do you have a 'cleaning crew' (such as snails or shrimp)?  These can be hard to keep with clown loaches, but some - like the burrowing nocturnal Malaysian Trumpet Snail - are somewhat safe from them.  Not sure how they would do with softer, slightly acid water.<br>  What kind of substrate do you have?  It may be decomposing.  Peat and some expanded clays may prevent crystal clear water, especially with fish like loaches and plecos that play in the dirt.<br>  <br>  I have to wonder why you are keeping platies (super-hard, alkaline, cool water) with discus (super-soft, acidic, warm water), but if it works, it works.<br>  <br>  <br>  So, my suggestions:<br>  1)  Post the additional info.<br>  2)  Add plants to absorb nutrients.<br>  3)  Increase lighting to 12 hours/day to increase phytoplankton and decrease floating bacteria.  If you have no plants, it may also increase green algae growth, which also cleans the water (your pleco will like it).  Just keep the viewing walls clean and let it grow elsewhere unless you think it's ugly.<br>  4)  Only feed as much as your fish can eat in a few minutes, once or twice per day.<br>  5)  Vacuum the gravel once per week when you do your 30% water change.<br>  6)  Make sure your carbon is WELL RINSED before putting it in the tank, if you use carbon (you don't have to).<br>  7)  Consider refilling with RO/DI water instead of RO.  You can get this by the gallon (using your own containers) for $0.25 to $0.39 per gallon at some grocery stores.  Don't use entirely dionized water or the pH, hardness, and total ion concentration will eventually drop to 5.7, 0, and 0, which will be lethal to everything in the tank, but half-and-half may help.  Make sure your tap RO filter is working correctly (the membranes don't last forever, and can tear, etc.)<br>  8)  Consider this stuff:<br>  <a href="http://www.seachem.com/Products/product_pages/Purigen.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.seachem.com/Products/product_...</a><br>  It absorbs dissolved organics, and you can recharge it.  Be sure to get a media bag too.<br>  9)  Try adding some Malaysian Trumpet Snails to keep the substrate clean, and freshwater fairy shrimp to eat the floating organics.<br>  <a href="http://www.arizonafairyshrimp.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.arizonafairyshrimp.com/</a><br>  Thy will probably eventually get eaten by fish if there is nowhere to hide (like in java moss).<br>  <br>  10)  If all that fails...  or if you want to do the cheapest, easiest thing in the first place...  simply add 0.1 mL of 3% hydrogen peroxide per gallon of water, once every day for 10 days and see if the condition improves.  If algae starts dying or bleaching, then stop.  Peroxide destroys dissolved organic compounds and microbes - it's the poor person's ozone generator, and much better than UV.  Try to find a brand that lists the active ingredient as "Hydrogen Peroxide" rather than "Hydrogen Peroxide, Stabilized".  Food-grade H2O2 is also pure.  As much as I hate Walmart, in the US, Walmart brand is pure H2O2 with no stabilizers.<br>  Be sure to add it to the tank already diluted by at least 20-to-1 with aquarium water, and don't spill any on your clothes - it bleaches.  Peroxide will decompose into oxygen and water within minutes to hours (depending on how clean the tank is) and leave absolutely no residue.  Above 1.0~1.5mL/gallon it can start to damage plants and animal gills, but this level (0.1mL/gal) is safe in a mature tank.  Peroxide at about 1mL/gallon is used to treat some fish parasites.  But it only destroys organics, and will not clear water clouded by inorganic dust from (e.g.) gravel.<br>  <br>  <br>  Edit.  Thanks for the additional info, but the answer remains murky (excuse the pun).  It's healthier for both fish and plants to get around 12 hours of light per day, though, rather than 8; and it might help the plants pull up extra nutrients so they don't cloud the water.|`|krru14Zlaa	do you have any snails? get a clummber and wait about 6 hours and you see a these snails if you turn off the lights and it kills them|`|g6zbKojDaa	Hi Kelly,<br>  It sounds like your tank has a bacterial bloom. There are different strains of bacteria which compete in an aquarium. Heterotrophic bacteria compete with autotrophic bacteria and if there's an abundance of organic matter, heterotrophic bacteria will bloom and out-reproduce autotrophic bacteria, the bacteria most responsible for converting ammonia and nitrite to nitrate.<br>  So how to reduce heterotrophic bacteria? Water changes can help, but these bacteria reproduce much more quickly than autotrophic bacteria so it's difficult to keep up with them. Reducing their nutrition will also help. Don't feed your fish as much or as often and hopefully that will reduce the bacterial bloom. Vacuuming the gravel helps too.<br>  You may have to wait until the autotrophic bacteria increase and the heterotrophic bacteria decrease. This could take a few weeks.<br>  As long as the fish are doing well, the cloudiness/bloom is merely an aesthetic issue and will eventually clear up as long as you are performing routine maintenance.<br>  <br>  PS...I just read your additional details and saw that you use RO water. This could be part of the problem. Autotrophic bacteria need elements/minerals such as carbon, nitrogen, hydrogen, phosphorus, sulfur, potassium, calcium, magnesium and iron for their metabolic functions. RO water as you know is devoid of these elements. I recommend amending the RO water with Electro-Right or aquarium salt; I use oyster-shell calcium, magnesium and potassium supplements (Naturalist by Rexall is what I use, and is inexpensive.)<br>  <br>  Good luck,<br>  David
hNRPQWqBaa	silver dollars are great.  they are schooling fish and grow fairly big (5-6 inches?)<br>  the dragon goby seems to be an awesome choice.  never had one myself, but i've looked into them:)  i've found them at about 8in long at petstores, but they will grow a good couple feet.  they may eat smaller fish, so its tankmates should probably be on the larger side.  also, they require more salt in their water that other fish may not be able to handle.<br>  there are also clown loaches, angel fish, gouramis, and tigar barbs that i've really liked having.<br>  have fun!:)
aeonmRR2aa	The water alone will have a volume of 20*20*20 = 8000 cc (mL) when completely full.  Water has a density of 1g/mL, giving 8 kg when full.<br>  <br>  For reference, that's 8 liters or 2.11 US gallons.|`|u5qKnvaGaa	4 kg, or 8lb 13oz
wd5rksMoaa	Should have listened to Bob Barker.|`|DtkLsetkaa	It could be, take her to the vet there may still be time to abort the kittens and get her fixed.  You should have taken care of that beforehand.<br>  <br>  I hope that if you DO plan on having the kittens that you have loving, safe homes set up for them and the responsibility to take back the kittens at any given point in their lives if the family is unable to keep them.  That is the mark of a responsible breeder, along with a lot else.  If you aren't this responsible, then please do not have those kittens.   Thousands of kittens get put to sleep every day, and you are condemning them to death by having more.|`|zpwJR60baa	Hi, I am a cat behaviorist, and I hope this help...<br>  <br>  The first noticeable sign of pregnancy in a cat is a change in her nipples. Approximately three weeks after mating her nipples will become pinker and more enlarged. This is called 'Pinking'<br>  Your cat may become more affectionate and want more of your attention.<br>  There may be an increase in appetite.<br>  Pregnancy can be confirmed by your vet from approximately 22 days using ultrasound.<br>  As the pregnancy advances your cat may begin 'nesting' behavior. She may begin searching for a place to deliver her kittens. She will try to get into closets, cupboards and other secluded places.<br>  <br>  Cat pregnancy is 52-70 days. If this is the case, you need to get the yourself ready...|`|vxyHnqc5aa	Yes that's absolutly normal, Check her nipples, they should be starting to swell slightly and become more noticable.  Female cats do like a lot more affection when they are pregnant, just like humans do.  And you will notice a very increased appitite, you should be feeding her kitten food now as she will need the extra vitamins and calcium as the kittens will sap everything from her.  Feed her as much as she will eat and you'll get good strong healthy kittens,  Also try Cats milk, my cat loves it and it is full of goodness.  Good luck and I hope everything goes smoothly.|`|u7Dy2qOkaa	It could be, and if so then congrats!<br>  Anyways, just take it to a vet and have her checked.<br>  <br>  I so hope she is, watching a cat give birth is amazing.|`|AA11429715	Pregnant cats often become a bit more clingy, they're looking for reassurance that they're still wanted.

No-one can answer this for you. My dog Jasper died and I went to the shelter 3 months later and adopted two more dogs. My neice had the gall to tell my sister "its too soon for me to get another dog" But guess what- Andy and Midnight are very greatful to have a home and my wife and I love them very much. Where would they be now had I waited.<br>  <br>  I would only ask that you adopt a dog from a shelter when you are ready- so many need homes.|`|NAGiNKFWaa	You are the only one who can answer this question.  I have been down this road and I can say that it is best to give yourself time to grieve so you won't resent the new puppy, or feel like you are replacing Dixie.  I am so sorry about Dixie, I don't think we ever get over the pain of loosing a dog.  Here is a poem that give me comfort.  <br>  <br>  I stood by your bed last night, I came to have a peep.<br>  I could see that you were crying, you found it hard to sleep.<br>  I whined to you softly as you brushed away a tear,<br>  "It's me, I haven't left you, I'm well, I'm fine, I'm here."<br>  I was close to you at breakfast, I watched you pour the tea <br>  You were thinking of the many times your hands reached down to me.<br>  I was with you at my grave today, you tend it with such care.<br>  I want to re-assure you, that I'm not lying there.<br>  I walked with you towards the house as you fumbled for your key.<br>  I gently put my paw on you, I smiled and said, "It's me."<br>  You looked so very tired, and sank into a chair<br>  I tried so hard to let you know that I was standing there.<br>  It's possible for me to be so near you every day<br>  To say to you with certainty, "I never went away."<br>  You sat there very quietly, then smiled; I think you knew...<br>  In the stillness of that evening, I was very close to you.<br>  The day is over... I smile and watch you yawning<br>  And say "good-night, God bless, I'll see you in the morning."<br>  And when the time is right for you to cross the brief divide,<br>  I'll rush across to greet you and we'll stand, side by side.<br>  I have so many things to show you, there is so much for you to see.<br>  Be patient, live your journey out... then come home to be with me.<br>  ~Author Unknown~|`|6qsocyK3aa	It's never too soon to get another dog so long as you know you won't be getting one as a replacement. It's not to say you can't love a new dog, but not in the same way as your old one. Dogs, like people, have very different personalities and quirks to each other and you must learn to love a dog for what it is, not because it reminds you of another one. I would suggest you get a completely different breed.|`|73f4817c9af75121ee93853e03437fc1aa	awww...my sympathies!   Get another dog whenever YOU feel you are ready for another - there's no set time when it's "right" to get another.  Of course nothing will ever replace your Dixie, but it sounds like you are missing the companionship of a dog and there's nothing wrong with that.  With spring right around the corner you shouldnt have a problem finding one - just be sure and go to the shelter so you can save a life to replace the life of the dog you just lost! good luck!!|`|wjwsFPMuaa	I remember when one of my kitties died. I ended up getting another one the next day. Not to replace but to comfort me. The new kitten kept me constantly busy and didn't allow me to think much about the circumstances surrounding my other cat. Every once in awhile I would recollect a good time with my lost cat when something similar happened with the new one and that also made me feel better.|`|aaCK25mGaa	well no it helps to get another dog|`|A9Koz4cqaa	I have clients ask me this all the time.  It is NEVER too soon to get a puppy.  Many people feel guilty like they are trying replace their lost pet but in fact they could never do that.  Nothing replaces the memories you have or the love you shared but it helps you to heal so much faster.  You can focus on the love you have for your new pet rather than dealing with the grief.|`|zpjIjG5Waa	I'm surprised that you want another dog so quickly but if so go for it. Were all different in how we react to a loss. If you feel you want one so quickly I don't think there's anything wrong with it. You have a huge hole in your heart so fill it if you feel your ready.|`|CcESWX5vaa	no its not a bad ideal a new puppy will keep your mind off dixie i wish i had done that but i never had my dog put to sleep in 1998 due to bad arthiritis vet recommended it i never got a new dog till 2003.i had brandon for 14 yrs hardest thing i ever did was put him to sleep.|`|P3eXNNqLaa	That really just depends on you. There is no right or wrong. Do what you are ready for, but don't get one before you are ready to take responsibility for a new puppy, and all the work involved.|`|aU2yDd8qaa	Nope, no matter if you get one a day later or a year.. you'll still love your old dog all the same. It's up to you. Getting a new one can help ease the pain a bit too.|`|HbGNHW8Qaa	It all depends on you. No one can help you make the decision.<br>  <br>  If you're ready, it can definitely be a great choice to go ahead and finding a new puppy.|`|WBGlnIF5aa	there is nothing wrong with getting another dog but its your choice|`|OyJOPmHvaa	Its only too soon if your not ready in yourself to love another dog, I had a new dog after 2 months of my other dog died, in mt experience it helped us to heal, don't get me wrong you will always love your Dixie and no other dog will ever replace her, Hollie my new dog will never replace Tara, but it has helped us, we even had the same breed again but that was our personal choice.<br>  My heart goes out to you because I Truly know how you feel.|`|CNN2IU3aaa	I had the same thing once you get a new dog you can think postive like all the love u gave to dixie and u care about u can put on the new dog you have and you probably need someone to cuddle to and have now that your dog has passed i had the same problem then once i got a new dog i actually was happy i did..|`|16c836400ca09a5e1eadd5a523f3be35aa	it's normal & fine . i had a parrot that i LOVED & when he died i was so sad ! i kept having dreams (ridiculous?) lol , idk . but yeah , it's been a while , but im getting another one (:
zpjIjG5Waa	you may want your soon to be husband to contact the military for starters. To ship an animal there's no guarantee that in the process of shipping they will take care of that animal. You get what you pay for. <br>  Once your married though as far as I know the military may have better options for you.<br>  Personally my animals wouldn't go anywhere unless i was there. But that's just me, Either way I wouldn't trust anyone with the care of my animal no matter what I was paying them. <br>  If i were in your shoes i'd consider taking a ship over with my dog.|`|FXeuwkX0aa	You could probably fed-x him but you better poke an airhole.|`|18f339d2d88d8a05cc418425220b52e1aa	There are a lot of requirements for shipping a dog.  All that you can find out from the airlines you choose to ship him by.  You also need to find out if there is a quarantine period in Spain.  Some quarantine periods are up to 6 months so check with the airlines.<br>  <br>  I have never had a dog shipped but I would start by contacting all the different airlines to find out what restrictions apply & what you need to do before you ship him.<br>  <br>  We have Kirtland Air Force Base here & many of the military turn their dogs over to AHA for adoption cause of the quarantine period or health reasons or the cost of doing it.  If you could go over at the same time as the dog I think it would be better.  But check with all the different airlines & see which one would be best to suit your needs.|`|sQOXjKFNaa	call the airline you will be flying on! They  will direct you to international shipping and let you know what you will need to ship the big guy!
AM7CgQ4daa	it really depends on what area you live in, what industry and work is situated in your area, and if that work continues to go strong or dry up.  After saying all that, I do not imagine the economy improving for at least a year, and could be several years.<br>  If you are finding it hard to cope financially now, you may want to consider rehousing the younger dog.  Although a hard decision to make, in the future your dog will be older and more dogs will be up for adoption.|`|tbGZnkgPaa	Wow, talk about a loaded question!<br>  <br>  1. A mature Australian Sheppard is about 18-20 months old, so yours is still a puppy!<br>  2. I could not find specifics on cosequin but you can call your Vet or pharmacy and ask. Just like with humans different medicines take different amounts of time to leave the body.<br>  3. Not for a while, some experts say it's not even the worse yet! But from a basic economic standpoint it will be when consumers start purchasing again! And that will be when they have extra money (or when they can find work...jobs are being lost every day) that they don't have to put toward late payments or other debt. Do a google search and you can find several different opinions.|`|A9Koz4cqaa	I had a client recently run out of cosequin and within 2 days the dog started to show signs of soreness.  You can buy cosequin over the counter now so you may find it cheaper at a pet store or online.<br>  I cant really help you out with the rest of your questions.  The economy is going to take a while I am guessing but that is all anyone can do is guess.  I live in detroit and its pretty bad here:(

iasOicRjaa	You could try feeding a better quality food....also for coat health add a little bit of fish oil to his food every day or give him fish oil caps.|`|KxjUim7yaa	No bacon oil. Don't put anything on hs skin in the way of oils. Get some Salmon oil to add to his food. The dry skin and dandruff is also a sign of food allergy. Purina has a lot of corn. It is what many dogs are allergic to. I used to have a skin problem like yours with my Dachshund. It was the food. I now fix his food, but you can find good grain free foods. Innova EVO puppy would be good. I also use Solid Gold Barking at the Moon or Innova EVO Red Meat for my adult dog.
7nGhHv3Saa	It's fine but I don't suggest it, it's not at all healthy or comfortable.

F3FrZ7eAaa	Turns out males and females are both the same in personality, but they grow differently and need different requirements.<br>  <br>  Male ball pythons get from 3.5-4 feet, while females get a bit bigger ranging from 4.5-5 feet in length. There have been bigger females, but that is almost never seen and very rare. When I say they need different requirements-- I just meant they need different tank sizes are adults. The minimum for females (as an adult) is 40 gallons, while for males it's a good 30 gallons. Ball pythons aren't very active, which is why they don't need a huge home. <br>  <br>  Myself, I own a male Ball Python. He is very docile, never tried to bite me, and he's very friendly. Just make sure your daughter is gentle when holding the little fella. Also, keep in mind that babies can be a bit nippy. It doesn't hurt much though, so I hear. <br>  <br>  Over all, they make great pets male or female. Good luck|`|ZRGkOB7oaa	Regardless of gender, both make equally nice snakes to work with. Gender doesn't really have an affect on the temperament(maybe with breeding females it might, but im just assuming) If you want a larger BP, then females are the way to go as they usually are a bit larger than males. Also, I have heard certain morphs can be a bit aggressive(have no cue why). Mostly its Mojaves ball pythons that I have heard can be a bit aggressive, but if you're just getting a normal ball python your daughter will be fine with either a male or female. Hope this helps:)|`|jTeDpBjlaa	All snakes have their own personalities which can be influenced by how they are treated and handled. <br>  <br>  Females DO get a little bigger, though.|`|DHCXeLvvaa	They both have great temperaments so it doesn't matter what sex you get<br>  <br>  they can sometimes be picky eaters so make sure you do your research|`|atxog9hFaa	Female snakes in general are nicer for beginners.|`|b9610cdca9c953260b26bc2dd476eab7aa	either male or female  ball pythons are called ball pythons becuz when threatened they curl up in a ball rather then fight. one thing to keep away aggression is daily handling...feeding frozen thawed rats in a seperate container from the cage and feed frozen thawed instead of live...good luck :) make sure you do your research :))|`|EREY1I8naa	They're both friendly if you socialize them well, but from experience, my females have always eaten better.|`|1LnyIktsaa	a male ball python is way better than a female ball python.|`|su5Tuo9Yaa	MALE!!!!! they are sooooooo much nicer. womon think people are disturbing them and get mad|`|b94588139eda1c69ea59fe863af53826aa	the first person should not have even replied to this, they think the snakes should not be kept cause they are wild lol there are lots of captive breed snakes kinda like dogs but i guess people shouldnt have dogs either right?    temperment doesnt differ depending on sex a ball python is going to act like a ball python. snakes are all different so you will have males and feamles that will bite  just pick one that is calm and not trying to bite you.     if you keep snakes you will get bit sooner or later so be ready

7KxQXHzOaa	It will com out after a few water changes.<br>  <br>  good luck|`|lNzhglLFaa	you are most likely going to run in to filtration problems... with nothing in the bottom of the tank there is nothing for the good bacteria to grow in... there for you are most likely going to have a big ammonia spike....i would really consider putting some gravel in it or adding stress zyme in regular increments...i also would not feed the fish more than twice a week...<br>  <br>  if you insist on keeping the bottom bare, yes i would think that the sand you missed will eventually get siphoned out....|`|XAsR6uPvaa	Since it is a bare bottom, you will eventually have to clean the bottom of the tank with something >_><br>  <br>  The sand will get removed along with the fish waste.<br>  <br>  Also, if the sand somehow manages to float and not sink, then your filter might take care of it.<br>  <br>  <br>  Best way I would suggest to get it out is by getting a clean piece of cloth and wiping the bottom of the tank.
a2cjwMKcaa	You dont need to have substrate in the tank, but many fish appreciate some cover like caves, logs, rocks or driftwood. The fish will probably be more settled and less agressive if they can claim their own bit of sheltered territory. Plecos especially like a cave or similar to shelter in during the day.<br>  <br>  Ian|`|Qhdozm54aa	So long as you are able to keep on top of the sand in terms of maintenance then it would probably be best to leave it as it is. With multiple cichlids in a tank it is often necessary to break up the line of sight between the fish by providing decor in the form of rocks, bogwood and (so long as the fish aren't known to uproot them), plants.|`|yjsIhHeuaa	Substate works better, because natural filtration happens, tank looks cleaner, and overall fish feel more secure because they can only see top, and side views vs. all views together.<br>  <br>  Black sand is a nice substrate and i would recommend it.<br>  Bare bottom should be avoided at all cost, unless tank is a quarantine tank.

BTHY8oZYaa	I wish I knew.<br>  <br>  My neighbor is an 'animal collector' as I call her.  She doesn't believe in fixing her male animals.  As a result we had an over population of cats (until the coyote population went up.)  <br>  <br>  She also has 3 large male dogs in her back yard and 3 small (2 female 1 male for breeding) in her house.  <br>  <br>  I really think the answer to your question, <br>  Why do people think they should just breed their dog(s)? is "BAD BREEDING."|`|AA12128656	because they're idiots and they like to keep all of us rescue people up to our ears in fur and vet bills....<br>  <br>  UGH!!|`|hKVOw1Sjaa	That is Human Nature,greed and ignorance on the part of too many people who think they an make a quick Buck and soon find out it is not that easy and in fact a lot of hard work if they are serious about breeding correctly and believe me you rarely make money but lose it as you breed only to get better dogs then you already have.<br>  The only people who do make money are the backyard breeders and puppy millers who care nothing re the health or care of the dogs or pups which some poor fool will buy in a pet shop or from one of these people and inherits a sick,poorly developed puppy.<br>  The name of the game for some people is the Holy Dollar!Little do they know what they are in for.Just read some of the questions on this site like what do l do my female has had two puppies and it is 4 hours later and no moe puppies,ugh,have they not heard of the telephone and people called vets and emergency vets?|`|mfXDUkRYaa	They probably think that because any human can have a baby (something that I don't think is right), any dog can. They probably think of puppies as something really cute and soft, not expensive, messy chewers! And there's the greed - they can use the money they make from pimping their dog out for their own enjoyment.|`|KxjUim7yaa	They are oblivious to the overpopulation, they don't know the first thing about breeding, and they think that they aren't the BYB we talk about. But mostly it is the money they plan to make.|`|lDXh0jRVaa	I've got one word for you and it sums it all up:<br>  <br>  MONEY<br>  <br>  A good breeder loses money to the litter, a crappy one makes hundreds if not thousands of dollars for little more than the hassle of having to hear them yip all night. So aggravating.|`|ZRGkOB7oaa	I completely agree with you! There are millions if not thousands of homeless dogs in the US alone. I just don't understand why ppl constantly insist on breeding more and more animals just so the overall population of dogs in shelters keeps increasing. I love puppies and all but they are already tons of breeders out there. The world doesn't need much more unless they were trying to bring back a certain breed that is short on breeding animals. What's the problem of having one nice companion animal mix breed or not. It wouldn't matter! I just think its very wrong to use breeding as a HOBBY or for the purpose of creating profit for themselves.|`|g4KHXYFPaa	"I have two dogs of the same gender,same breed,let's breed them"<br>  <br>  Fortunately this type of breeding doesn't produce offspring.<br>  <br>  There was a time when I thought much the same way as these people, only I never, ever intended on breeding.  I used to think two healthy, purebred dogs were just fine if registered with the same kennel club to breed.<br>  <br>  I also never thought,"I want my dog to breed, because I want more dogs just like him/her".  Smart people know this doesn't even happen with kids, much less puppies.|`|ZSW9GHCZaa	I have absolutely no idea, but I agree with you completely! There are also many good dogs AND puppies available at any local pound.|`|wUg7iYU1aa	I wish i could answer this for you, but I have no clue what is wrong with these people today. They are ignorant, and are obviously very selfish people.|`|AA12192261	money, money, money, it makes me sick.|`|CcESWX5vaa	i breed mine because i love the breed i dont make alot of money  i do sell my pups but not for $1000s  i seen breeds online go $1500 to $3000  i only breed 1 litter a yr but yet i get put down as a bad person i know my dogs go to good homes n if the animal shelter wanted really to adopt their animals out they wouldnt be charging $250 adoption fee  n then you got to get the shots alot can afford cheaper puppies  that they know are  ok instead of paying for  a dog from a shelter n not getting a garantee our shelter gives a 14 day grarantee thats it after that your sunk n they dont have dogs tested for parvo or seperated from  the other dogs thats in the kennels.so why pay for something you dont know is  sick or not? if the people i sell my pups too cant keep them i will buy them back but i have never had a pup returned n everyones happy with them.i sell mine for $250 but their vet checked first shots n wormed  before they leave my property  n thats included in the $250 i  dont make much off them  but that  not the point i breed because i love the breed.some bybs as you put us do care. if my dogs just get a cough they go to the vet i love my dogs i would NEVER  do anything to hurt them.i got a pom due  the 24th shes goes for a xray the 18th  n i have homes  picked for the pups.so dont judge unless you know the breeder.

Make sure you have placed boxes with towels you can throw out afterwards in several locations so she can choose!<br>  <br>  Are you sure you can't see any movement from the kittens?  Wait until she is sleeping on her side and watch closely for 10 minutes, there should definitely be some slight rippling!<br>  <br>  If her nipples are not enlarged at all with milk she probably has a few more days.|`|zpwJR60baa	Big Belly, pink ****.. yes, yes, yes...|`|kZrZCPRMaa	Maybe within a week<br>  it could be anyday now(:
gbd4PMwfaa	Good Luck trying to get over this. It is very difficult and though I have my own horse and ride in the winter, when it gets below 15 degrees her I don't go. It is very depressing. I try to read as many horse books as possible and even though unrealistic, there are many computer games that involve horses out there. You could also do exercises in your house to prepare yourself for when you start riding again.|`|vaf7wGOpaa	Man, I'm going through that right now. I live in New York City, and I have a house in Pennsylvania, and that's where I go riding, so I can only ride on weekends when we go up, and vacations. :'(<br>  <br>  so anyway, I like to try to surround myself with horse anything, such as wearing my jodhpurs and helmet, surrounding myself with horse pictures and videos, and even act like im at the barn. For example, i was cleaning my room yesterday, and i pretended I was mucking out a stall. :)|`|RoPLmd2daa	Unfortunately, there is only one cure for this ailment: hunting down horse owners from your local tack shop who need their horses exercised in the winter.<br>  Your prognosis is grim, lol.<br>  If you can, find a new stable that still holds lessons in the winter months (usually in an indoor), or get your horse fix by offering to groom horses at your current stable.<br>  <br>  P.S.- Looking at the horses you wish you had online when you can't ride will make your condition worse!! :P|`|bXTQAGnDaa	:) I think everyone who likes horses gets that. I know I do but luckily I'm in MS so I can still ride some during winter. You could do what's already been said look for a place that gives lessons in winter, offer to groom horses, see if anyone needs somebody to look after/ride their horse. hope this helps :)|`|BREi7qw7aa	i think that happens to everyone who loves horses! theres nothing you can do really, but just keep imagining how awesome it will be when it warms up and you can ride agian!|`|cGRyDCpQaa	I think that happens to everyone who can't ride!<br>  <br>  Both my horse and I are injured... we can't do much.

2jVnYgkeaa	Well, like others have said, it works great for rounding out the tip of the nail. For the actual trimming I've found it takes too long, so I clip first then use it to smooth out the tip.|`|LrAqoYODaa	I have & use them on 3 of my 4 Chihuahua's (the 4th is too small for it yet).  It took a while for them to get used to the sound/feeling of using the pedi-paws & even now they're not crazy about it but do tolerate it.  <br>  <br>  Saying that, I also still clip their nails first.  I use the Pedi-Paws more fto smoothen out the sharpness after clipping.  Same for my lab mix -clip first & then file.<br>  <br>  On the small dogs I think you could use them soley for keeping them short but for a big dog I honestly don't think they are heavy duty enough.|`|ZGFXBie9aa	They work fine... they're very weak, so not great for heavy duty jobs, but they are nice for smoothing...<br>  I reccomend clipping, and then using the pedipaws...<br>  <br>  I just got one the other day... it works... but again, very cheap/weak. <br>  <br>  It's nice because it is very, very silent, and not as many dogs will freak out about it.|`|QV2WQsd8aa	I'd suggest a dremel tool instead - but you need to know how to use it properly.  A long haired dog's fur can get wrapped in it and it can cause the nail to get hot if you grind for too long on one nail.  <br>  <br>  I've talked to people who love them and people who hate them.|`|CuGT5X6eaa	it works for my cat,but I dont think it will work for harder nails,so,if he has soft nails that are easy to clip then it will work,but it does take longer...|`|wUg7iYU1aa	I think if what you are doing now works, then stick to that. I have heard mixed reviews on it, works for some but not all.|`|xz4K7fuMaa	I love Pedi-paws they work great!  We use it on our two labs and Golden. We can round out the toe nails so they are not sharp.|`|AA10283080	Well my 3 shepherds get theirs done at the groomers when they go every 3 months (they're outside dogs and their nails grow but they stay pretty well worn down). My Great Dane's nails are too big to use one of those and my little mutt's nails have to be done with a human fingernail clipper because she will not sit still for something like that and her nails split when I try to use a dog nail clipper. The fingernail clippers actually work really well for her nails because they're so small.|`|F2JEvYX7aa	Hello,<br>  <br>  I bought this for my 1 dog and 2 cats, they will not let me use it on them, the vibration and the noise scares them. If you would like you can have my set. I was really hoping that it would work for them due do them no liking the clippers but of course they didn't.|`|GSf09ALBaa	I have 9 dogs and all of them hate it.  It vibrates the nail and makes noise and it has a smell which they notice.<br>  <br>  Nope, that was a waste of money for me.|`|0JHi6Rxaaa	I have a pit bull type dog and her nails grow so fast. The pedi-paws every couple days is soooo much better than the clippers now and then. No more jagged edges!|`|1itC64nVaa	Unless your dog is scared of the quiet noise then itt'l work!|`|a29qiNkvaa	I have 2 Akita’s and it works great! It is sooo worth the $20 bucks!
9kceDOTraa	Who says you have to do a single species only of Africans?  That's not my working knowledge here.  Not by far at all with a 90 gallon tank.  Of course if you want to do something for other reasons, hey it's your tank, but with a footprint like that, unless you've been getting some crappy answers, and that's not uncommon for a social forum like this, you could easily do several species of African cichlids with a footprint like that.<br>  <br>  I don't really bother with plants nor do I confess to know what an aquascape it, but I'd assume it just arranging like some plants by color and size so it has a visually pleasing effect is all.  I've never had much luck keeping plants in my tanks, so I cannot help much with that.<br>  <br>  Layering your rocks and creating ledges and cliffs and openings will probably create some curiosity in whatever stock you want to get.  Get some energy saving bulbs and I'm sure you could work up some great lighting effects.  Outside of that, I don't venture too much into the decor aspect so sorry again, I don't have much more input.  I can pretty much advise you on African combinations if I have a feel for what types and colors you like though.|`|M3pjhIecaa	I'm with legend here, although i predominently keep amazon fish, ive a rift valley set up of 100gallons which with the rock structure and fish it looks pretty good, I started out with 4 different species of 6 fish and of course im removing them at an alarming rate as they seem to have fry every other day. For activity and colour you can't beat it however, the main tank in the living room is amazon with Discus and altum angels as the centre of attraction clown loach for a splash of fun and the rest are all functional fish including bristlenose, SAE's, and platys for any algal problems whiptails and zebra plecs, and cardinals for a shoaling fish. With plants, co2 undergravel heating and 4t5's and 2t8's it looks good not as bright looking as the rifts but a more subdued set up for the living room.
lj3hNR9baa	In the wild, cichlids have a wide variety of foods. Aside from the algae that grow inside their tanks, you can try bloodworms, krill, glassworms, or brineshrimp. Just about any pet shop will have at least of these. If you really want to go the extra mile, you can raise mosquito larvae since most fish prefer live food. You can also try some vegetables every now and then.
TmEoTapDaa	What type of UVB are you using? Compacts and coils blindness. You need a reptisun 10.0 long, this aids in the digestion process and well as helps absorb calcium. To help move things along. Get a needless syringe and give your beardie a small amout of olive oil, only a few drops. Do not shove the syringe down his throat. Pull the side of his lip down and work your way in. Also give 2 warm baths a day for 20 min each. While in the bath, massage his belly starting from his armpits down. He should poop that day.|`|Ja69k7Kvaa	have you changed up there living space?<br>  Maybe they dont feel comfortable.<br>  My iguana didnt poop for over a week and a half but then he went on my husbands bed and felt comfortable and pooped.<br>  Then he got a big box so he could hide in it and now he poops in that.|`|49K9jdX9aa	Start feeding him softer foods...

Dwarf hamsters tend to not fight as much as other hamster species, and are therefore commonly mistaken as the social species of hamster.  While many people believe that dwarf hamsters can be compatible with one another, they are still solitary animals that prefer to live alone, which will result in fighting.  They are just less territorial than Syrian hamsters, so fights are not as common.  But all species of hamsters are solitary and will fight and even kill other hamsters in their territory.|`|AA11902187	Try my website:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.hamsterharbor.co.nr" rel="nofollow">http://www.hamsterharbor.co.nr</a><br>  <br>  Click Pregnancy >> Open >> Click any link you want on the right side =)
6xf1GfbUaa	I think it's better if your cat stays home and you have a friend come over and stays at your house. That way your cat will stay in the comfort of his home. If you take him to a cattery, it could be traumatic being in a different unknown environment and being handled by strangers. Also, he will be exposed to all kinds of possible dangerous things like infections, etc. At least at your home, even if your friend is a stranger to your cat, it will be easier for your cat to deal with it since he'll feel safer being in his environment.|`|8e13291b33ff9fcfc620b014d57ead81aa	For the sake of the cat keep him home.<br>  Cats become overwhelmingly stressed when displaced from their environment.<br>  Stress can lower a cats immune system and trigger an illness.<br>  <br>  Most cats return home from boarding with issues ranging from diarrhea to upper respiratory issues.<br>  <br>  Call on someone you can rely on or hire a pet sitter.<br>  Have them come into your home once or twice a day to play,feed and monitor.|`|DXzI2jrEaa	I prefer to leave mine at home with a trusted friend checking on them daily.  Cats don't always adjust well to change so the cattery could be a traumatic experience, not to mention the exposure to disease, etc. I think it's best to leave them in the comfort of their own home where everything is familiar.  <br>  <br>  If you don't have anyone to help, you could try a pet service.  They not only care for your pet but will also water plants, put trash out, etc. plus open and close drapes to make it appear someone is home.  Pet services are usually cheaper than boarding pets too.<br>  <br>  Also, before I leave for a trip, I always let my vet know that I'll be away so that whoever is checking on the cats can bring them in for any necessary medical attention.  This way I can authorize payment over the telephone before I rush home.|`|DzRLYAAJaa	Personally, I'd leave him at home. If you have a teenage or young adult relative nearby that may be able to just stay at your house while you're gone, that would be the best. Or, if you know someone who could just take him for that time in their home, that would be all right too. Then he can stay out of a cage and just be a cat.<br>  <br>  I wouldn't take them to a cattery.

Bw18seFqaa	there's no such thing as a "Mini Doberman Pincsher"<br>  <br>  There are Mini Pinschers...  but they are not related to the doberman.  They are actually a type of terrier that's been around long before the doberman was created.  They were called Min Pins because they resembled a small version of the German Pinscher.<br>  <br>  From a reputable breeder, I'd expect to pay $800-1200 and up for a pet quality.<br>  <br>  Around $300 or less thru shelter or rescue.|`|C1eHfhrHaa	they are called miniature pinschers (not miniature dobermans).  a well bred one from a reputable breeder can run upwards of $1000.|`|8NSh1D4Maa	There is no such thing as a Miniature Doberman Pinscher.  There are Miniature Pinschers (often called Min Pins for short), which are what I am assuming you are talking about, which are NOT related to the Doberman Pinscher and are actually a much older breed.  For a well-bred puppy from a reputable breeder, expect to spend probably upwards of $1000.  They can be adopted much more inexpensively from shelters and rescues- there are a lot of breed specific rescues for Min Pins out there because they tend to be 'difficult' dogs.  They were originally semi-feral rodent control on farms, so are fiercely independent, very headstrong, extremely high energy, and can be very difficult to train as well as having a tendency to be nippy and vocal.|`|7574e407f210a23942c368cc9c40754eaa	A well-bred purebred will cost somewhere around $800 to $1500.  Make sure a min-pin (NOT a mini doberman, the miniature pinscher is a completely different breed!) is the right breed for the family to avoid disappointment later.  If this family decides to get a min-pin, DON'T bargain shop!  You often get what you pay for in illness, genetic and behavior problems, etc.  Breed rescue groups often have really nice dogs of all ages.  These will have been health-checked, vaccinated, neutered and temperment tested.  The adoption fees are often less than $200.  All my dogs are rescues (as are my cats and reptiles) and "secondhand" doesn't mean "second-rate!"|`|qeR967J7aa	call your shelter or humane society.

2qgg2G8kaa	Corn snakes are wonderful starter pets, good choice. They come in a ton of different colors and they are very docile. They also don't bite people often and they aren't the nippy type of snakes. There's also the ball python, which is also a great starter snake. It does get thick around the middle of it's body, but it makes a great pet. They are also docile and are not nippy.<br>  <br>  Baby corn snakes will range from $20-$90, depending on size and sometimes colors. They are usually $70 at Petsmart, that's how much I bought mine for. Adult corn snakes will be a bit more pricey, ranging from about $60-$100 and possibly over. It's always best to start out with a baby corn snake since this is going to be your first time having a snake as a pet.<br>  <br>  Baby ball pythons will range from $50-$100. That may seem more pricey than the corn snake, but other ball python morphs can be $800 to over $1,000. Baby ball pythons are much larger than the baby corn snakes. They are usually about $80 at Petsmart, as that is how much I bought mine for. Adults will range from $100-$250. They do get large as they grow which they will need at least a 40-55 gallon tank minimum.<br>  <br>  You won't need to buy a whole lot of stuff for your new snake. This is what you will need for your snake:<br>  <br>  1) A hide (they need something to make them feel secure, a half-log hide would do)<br>  <br>  2) Substrate (I use Aspen Bedding as my substrate for all of my snakes, it works great and I've always used it)<br>  <br>  3) Water bowl (buy a large enough water bowl to where the snake can fit it's entire body in when it sheds so it can soak itself)<br>  <br>  4) The tank (for a baby corn or ball, the best is to buy a 10 gallon tank. A large tank with a ton of space will make them stressed out)<br>  <br>  5) Decorative plants/Climbing sticks (you can get this to make the enclosure look attractive and a climbing stick will give the snake something to climb around on)<br>  <br>  6) Heat lamp (you can get a 60 watt for a corn, for a ball you can get 75 watt)<br>  <br>  7) Meters (Have 2 thermometers on both sides of the tank, one cool side<br>  and one basking side/warm side. Also buy a hydrometer to tell humidity in the tank)<br>  <br>  Clean the water bowl daily or every other day to keep the water bowl clean so the snake can drink fresh water, not gross dirty water. Always clean up<br>  after the snake poops. <br>  <br>  Temperatures for the snakes:<br>  <br>  Ball python- Warm/basking side should be beween 85-90+ and the Cool side should be 80-85.<br>  <br>  Corn snake- Warm basking side should be between 85-90 and the Cool side should be 75-85.<br>  <br>  *Also after feeding the snake do not hold it for a day or two so the snake can digest it's food. If you hold it after it eats it could regurgitate/throw up the mouse.<br>  <br>  Good luck on your snake!|`|atxog9hFaa	Well, I used Craig's List. But a corn snake cold be from $50 to $80 depending where you buy them.

They can do blood typing to determine the breed/breeds of a dog and also to verify pedigree and lineage. The tests are expensive, though, and are mainly used by breeders to verify a dog's pedigree.

M3pjhIecaa	Neon tetra's are difficult to breed and raise, they're scatterers for one so she lays the eggs as she swims along and the male follows scattering milt over the area, So while she may be full of eggs the chances of you seeing it happen are slim and even if you separate them chances are the water will not be up to what they need. Feeding the fry if you did succeed is another problem and you'd need to get a culture of inforsia going.|`|86b135e0c5c7fa8152fab546e88b509caa	Neons are not livebearers, they do not give birth.

There is a small chance(especially if the crab came from a crappy store with a tiny amount of substrate), but it's probably just him destressing. Just leave him alone and don't dig him up.

I live along the Tx/Mx border, so it gets brutally hot here. <br>  <br>  Do Not Shave her. The coat acts as protection against mosquitoes which can transmit heartworm, and it will also prevent sunburn. If you cannot groom her everyday until the shedding is over, I suggest you contact a groomer and make it very clear that you want your dog's coat given a puppy cut, where around an inch of coat is left. Then when the coat is short, you can start a habit with your dog to spend at least 15-30 minutes every two days or so brushing the dog. Most dogs love the attention and it is a good way to keep the coat and skin healthy.|`|22yL5wbzaa	purchase a <br>  Furbuster|`|PM23RDycaa	Shaving a double coated dog is a BIG no no.

His bright eyes are intent. His eager body quivers. Suddenly he begins to run from the group, flying over the green grass, his legs carrying him faster and faster.  You have been spotted, and when you and your special friend finally meet, you cling together in joyous reunion, never to be parted again. The happy kisses rain upon your face; your hands again caress the beloved head, and you look once more into the trusting eyes of your pet, so long gone from your life but never absent from your heart.<br>  <br>  Then you cross Rainbow Bridge together....

Now go out and get a new puppy today (tomorrow at the latest) and give that puppy all the love Oddy got when he was alive.  Get a good leash, and be sure the puppy can't get through the fence by itself, ever again ... but you are a good and loving owner, and you need a 'live dog' to become your 'partner' today, to help you through the grief of your dog's murder!|`|oGVWdnHraa	Omg I'm so sorry! :( :( I hope you are feeling ok :(|`|TSQxwlbraa	I'm so sorry :( <br>  Think about a good memory you had with her and how much fun you both had together.<br>  It sounds like she had a fabulous life :)<br>  R.I.P Oddy|`|216d90e6aa749da6fe51585ee054ef87aa	I am so sorry for your loss.

For some reason it was his time. It is sad that the owner of the other dog didn't care enough to keep his dog contained or  even care what happened to him. Time will help you deal with the loss of Oddy. Mourn his death as this is so important but also celebrate his life. Make a scrapbook of memories. Enlarge a pic of him and keep where you can see it. Read the Rainbow Bridge poem as it helps I think. Cherish all the memories of him and maybe one day get another dog in memory of Oddy. I am so sorry as this had to be so traumatic for you to see and go through. I would be heartbroken as well and am just reading this. I have lost 2 dogs to illness and that is hard enough. But at least you were there when he died and he knows he was looked for and loved. Rest in Peace Oddy. :)|`|uC2OAc4Kaa	I am actually crying omg that is soo sad. Pit bulls are so mean :( it attacked my ca once but she got away luckily I wish your did :(. I am sooo soorryyy R.I.P if anything happened to my dog I don't know what I would do :'(. Right now I think you should just charisehed the moments you had with him. Make a little booklet, or a book thingy and put down favourite moments and pictures what he loved to do. And that way you will always have something to remeber him by :'( he will always be in your heart. After a year or o maybe get a dog if you want the responsibility But don't buy it because you want to reaplace him... I am so sorry OMG
AA10288031	There's several things you can use for hedgehog bedding. The first is wood pellets or shavings. You want to use either pine or aspen, NEVER use cedar. Cedar is horrible for small animals, and can cause many health issues, even killing them. If you use aspen or pine shavings or pellets (pellets are better, there are no splintery parts), make sure that they are kiln-dried.<br>  You can also use paper products like Carefresh or Yesterday's News. With these products, you'll want to make sure that the hedgehog isn't eating any of it, as it could cause an impaction in the hedgehog's intestines.<br>  The last option, and the one that I use, is fleece liners. This is the most popular option because they cost less and are neater.  With liners, you can just buy either a fleece blanket or a couple of yards of fleece, then cut it to the size of your hedgehog's cage. You'll want to make sure there is no stitching on the fleece, as hedgehog toes and nails can get caught in loose stitching. You change the liners every couple of days, depending on how quickly your hedgehog gets them dirty. You can shake them over a garbage can in order to get bigger pieces of poop or get food crumbs off, then wash them. They're cheaper since you can reuse the liners for a long time, at least a year, usually. They're also nicer because they won't cause any respiratory issues (allergies in either the hedgehog or yourself). You can also see health problems on light colored liners (blood in pee or poop).|`|jyGTlpzTaa	You can use newspaper but if your hog isnt litter trained it gets very smelly. I use shredded cardboard, its environmentally friendly and great at keeping the smell down, hedgehogs like to dig in leaf litter so it is more natural for them. "Ecobed" is a British brand but I'm sure you can get American ones too. You could also use Carefresh or paper based cat litter, avoid wood shavings.<br>  <br>  By the way, hedgehogs aren't rodents, they're insectivores.
CvbB4qv3aa	Usualy i would say no, but it doesnt seem like its "food" for ferrets more like treats.<br>  So if you mash it small im sure it will be fine..|`|PTmg0dcYaa	no you cant. it wont kill it, but over time the hampster will not get the proper  nutrients it needs and will starve...i fed my guinea pig rabbit food and after a few weeks he lost weight and looked bad. so i got the proper food and he gained weight and his fur looked alot better.|`|C75EsUXRaa	I wouldn't even give them to ferrets, as milk and veg ain't ferret food, take em back if you haven't opened them, I keep rats and they don't like any of the packaged treats, but rats are brainy so they prob know they are crap.|`|nMe35c9Aaa	no you really shouldn't. farret food has meat in it and hamsters do not eat meat. that would be really bad for it.

Give him a slice of strawberry instead, much healthier!|`|wICYvRfdaa	I wouldnt suggest experimenting with it, if u really dont wanna get diff food for ur hammie i suggest u ground it into smaller pieces, otherwise, u can go back to the pet store and ask an employee who really looks like they care and they will tell you
7HEZhx46aa	I have three caiques that are nothing if not loving. They're also one of the most playful, energetic birds you'll ever meet. All three of mine are attached to me to the point where they will get down on the floor and follow me from room to room, like puppies.<br>  I got my first caique about 5 years ago after the death of a bird that was very special to me -- a Quaker I had raised from 8 weeks old until he died at 13.|`|RGQJfaCKaa	Maybe a cockatoo, but only if you have the time for it. They require lots of attention. My umbrella cockatoo loves me to death. She is always kissing me, snuggling with me, or scratching my head or arm with her foot. She follows me all over the house sometimes into the bathroom. Then I have to shoo her out.

Both male and female galahs are great talkers but the male is thought to be the better talker. They're very loving and affectionate birds which form a very strong bond with their owner and like to think of themselves as 'part of the family'. However, they do like their privacy at times and are quite happy to simply be around the family rather than be handled all hours of the day.The galah is also very affectionate
rVv5TC4Uaa	It needs medication, you may even have to put an Collar on him to keep him from scratching at it.<br>  <br>  I would take him in to vet or at least call for treatment recomendations.|`|iasOicRjaa	He needs to go to the vet to make sure he gets the right kind of medicine.

Good luck.|`|cfbc847f69b8c58c2a9f0c1c7fd702c4aa	I'm a 32 y/o man and cried for 2 days when I had to put my dog down last week.  I've never been so emotional in my life, not even when grandparents/friends/family has passed on.  It's different when you are the caretaker of something so precious.  You WILL blame yourself because we hold on to hope and always wonder what we could have done differently.  Know that she will not suffer anymore.  Our pets are like our kids.  Time is the only thing that will cure your heartache.  Try not to beat yourself up.  Try to understand that the decisions you and your family made were out of love for your pet.  The regret comes from knowing that you are the deciding factor for everything dealing with your pet.  Sometimes it is better off for the pet, but not for us.  That is what hurts so much.  We don't always want to do what is right for the animal because it hurts us so much.  I'm sorry for your pain and loss but know that happier days will come....it just takes time.|`|8c297b82172cbe03424f732b861eb653aa	Made me cry reading it.

I was at my farm with my mom and my dad called me from the vets office and told me that she might have to be put to sleep. I couldn't stop crying but the vet ended up giving her medicine which i had to give her for the rest of her life but before she got better i kept blaming myself for making her live through the pain just because i wanted her to survive.She ended up living 6 more months but when she died she was not even 2. I still sometimes blam myself because i had to watch her go through all this pain and even on the medication she still got sicker since it was a very strong pain medication which ended up recking her kidneys. You will be sad know and i am sorry for your loss but remember that she will be well looked after in heaven and that she is out of pain and misery.|`|6ItNK5Tqaa	its ok<br>  weve all lost so many friends that we loved. i know that when we had to put 1 of my dogs to sleep i wouldn't stop crying at night for about a month. i have had to had 3 dogs put to sleep. i normally dont like to talk about them. but after a while i was able to relize that it wasnt my fault. i shouldn't put myself throught all that just because i think its my fault. i relized the vet did it for my dogs own good. it was too hard for me to watch them go through that much pain. i was so sad.<br>  seriously i think that after w hile u will relize its not ur fault. u shouln'd blame ur self for that. trust me<br>  u will relize it one day.|`|a5CEuWDxaa	Hun I had a black labrador called Sam, my mum got him just after my birth, so I'd been with him all my childhood right up to 12 years old...He was getting extremely old and he had a number of allergies, one day he threw up continueously, I stayed with him ALL night hugging him, my mum rushed home and I thought things would be okay, then I woke up the next morning and he couldn't stand up...He was the happiest dog in the world; he had NEVER bit or growled at anyone.<br>  <br>  That afternoon my mum came home and had to break the news, my bestest friend had died, I didn't even get to sit by him and say bye...I cryed and cryed non stop, it bothered me for 2 whole weeks...I thought I'd never get over it but soon enough I did.<br>  We all know no one lasts forever... But she's always watching over you.<br>  Gosh that made me cry! :(|`|ubF6sY1Daa	Im not going to lie to you but you very well could have had her leg amputated and she would have been fine. But the Truth of the matter is that that surgery cost somewear around 1000-2000 dollers and in this economy and being a puppy your family probubly wasn't fully bonded to yet your parents probubly couldn't see paying that kind of money of a dog verses paying the rent or putting food on the table especally if you arn't the only child. You made the right decision and I was not going to sugar coat it if you are indeed 15. You did what had to be done and she is no longer in pain. You did what every pet owner dreads and in time your heart will mend and a new puppy will steal your heart and fill the void this one left. But you will never forget.|`|w9pvYSikaa	I went through the same heartache January 16, 2009.  I thought it was the worst day of my life.  I too am 15 years old, and so far putting my dog down was one of the hardest things I've ever had to do.  He was diagnosed with bone cancer 1 week before, the vet said the same thing to us.  Our only options were 1.) amputation and 2.) Put him down.  Sadly, we put him down he was just too old and we didn't want to put him through more pain of surgery.  Trust me, it gets better.  In time you will not feel the pain as much and just remember him (or her) as the best dog ever.  Have you thought about getting a puppy? We got a puppy 4 weeks ago, and I am so happy we did.  He brought a lot of happiness into our house.  Just remember that they are totally different dogs.  You need to give a new one as much love as your deceased dog.<br>  <br>  I am very sorry about your loss, I know what it feels like.
58410e61549a3fe40d177cf7e71fc875aa	As I said in my answer yesterday...it's not only the stringhalt that worries me when viewing this horse, it's the loss of flexion in the left hind too. It looks generally uncomfortable in the hind quarters, as evidenced by it's crappy hind changes (regardless of the stringhalt).<br>  <br>  If you're really considering buying it, get a qualified equine vet to take a look before you part with your cash...|`|RUxRNsf4aa	According to youtube, "The URL contained a malformed video ID."<br>  <br>  Edit----<br>  <br>  Okay, now it works.<br>  It isnt really all that noticable, infact, if I hadnt been looking for it I may not have noticed it. My guess is that it is her right hindleg. She is a great jumper though, despite the stringhalt. I think 15,000 is asking too much,  for having stringhalt.  Maybe 10,000 or so.|`|AA11498082	Yes, right rear|`|xvEJbqtfaa	The link does not work.<br>  <br>  I answered your question yesterday, but I'm giving a different answer this time. :)<br>  <br>  Though to the older horserider it's noticable, I really don't thing that light of a case of stringhalt would affect her performance, except maybe in higher dressage. The price, however, is outrageous for that disorder. A horse like that even without stringhalt would be pushing 10,000. So I think she's a great horse, with her stringhalt and all. But the price is not worth it. Maybe it went down or something, but that's just my opinion.<br>  <br>  (Back, right)|`|mNDsFR7Baa	it appears to be her right hind.  I agree it is difficult to notice. However, it will worsen with age and you are a little steep on the price. She certainly performs well, though|`|psNR7hDJaa	I totally think it's the right hind leg. Also I don't think she will be worth 15,000 with mild stringhalt. Like others said, maybe about 10,000 or not even.|`|bqbrKFeUaa	I think it is probably her rear right hind leg. I could be wrong but I swore it's one of her hind legs.|`|PEPWFGNGaa	Never saw your other question but I have to agree with the answer above - back right - you can see it.<br>  <br>  As to how it will effect her - how old is she ?  - you can reckon on it getting worse with age.<br>  <br>  Good website with lots of information about EPSM,Shivers and Stringhalt:-<br>  <a href="http://www.ruralheritage.com/vet_clinic/epsm.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.ruralheritage.com/vet_clinic/...</a>

3OFhCEEwaa	If he likes the juice then carry on with that, keep things easy. Also, it will be a good source of vitamins for him (vitamin C is essential for guinea pigs). <br>  You can also give him fruit and veg as they have plenty of natural fluids in to prevent dehydration.<br>  Don't worry though, if he's thirsty he will drink. He wont kill himself just because he's protesting about not having a dash of cranberry in his beverage. lol. It's nice that you spoil him :) He sounds like a very lucky chap. Good luck x|`|AA11902187	Slowly wean him off cranberry juice.<br>  <br>  So let's say right now you have 50% juice, 50% water. Wait three days, then go to 40% juice, 60% water. Wait three more days. 30% juice, 70% water. Wait three more days... etc. etc. until you get all the way to 100% water.<br>  <br>  This way, he really wont know the difference until its water!

It also helps to rattle the bottle a little.  They are curious critters and will usually take a sip or two from a freshly rattled bottle.<br>  <br>  Short of letting him dehydrate, tough love is in order.  As long as you know that the bottle is flowing properly, wait him out.  You can check that all is OK with the bottle by filling it, hanging it on the cage and tapping the sipper tube with your finger.  Your finger should get damp and an air bubble should form in the bottle after a few taps.  Also remember that if you are giving him lots of leafy greens, he may not need much water from his bottle.<br>  <br>  Leaving a bottle with any dilution of juice in it for any length of time isn't a great idea because unrefrigerated juice can spoil (ie grow bacteria and yeast) pretty quickly.<br>  <br>  BTW, the poster who said that rabbits only drink out of bowls, not bottles never met our rabbits!

Those breeding traps are more like death traps and should only be used as nets to hold fry until they're big enough to be eaten if they're used at all.<br>  <br>  Stop moving her and leave her be, let her get on with it.|`|tShDXmgbaa	You can leave her in the net for a maximum of 2 weeks. She may have dropped the fry prematurely as guppies have many more babies than just 3. The egg that dropped is a good indicator she was not ready to give birth and aborted them. I just experienced my guppy giving birth to 10 fry one day and the rest 3 days later so I dunno what is going on with these guys nowadays.|`|P06xsw2taa	if she pushed out and egg she is done birthing at this time.  she can still be pregnant but not ready for more.  it is not uncommon for guppy's to stay pregnant all the time.  you can remove her from birthing tray in-till she starts hiding in the tank.  once she starts that up she is ready again.  the best way to keep her unstressed and keep a lot of the babies is to add floating plants.  fry hid in the plants at the top and when you see them you can net them out with out upsetting the mother.
b7757b0cd0ce0d522933db6876c42200aa	We've adopted two kittens from the pound - both are great.  I think the biggest question is where do you want to begin.  Personally, I liked going to the pound until we found one that we connected with.  Don't get one too young (less than 6-8 weeks), as it's hard to judge their personality.  Remember, that super playful cat may need to be toned down a bit at home (consider your furniture).  As far as health goes, most pounds check them out pretty well.  Stay away from those with a runny nose, soft stools, or if they are sneezing. Look at their eyes, they should be clear (no gunk in the corners).   Ask if the pound does a vet check, and ask if you can return (and get your money back) if a cat is deemed unhealthy by your vet.  Do have your vet check them out - especially for feline leukemia.<br>  <br>    I do think there's something special with having the younger kitten.  But, either way you're saving a cat that may not have a home without you.|`|g92UnU5eaa	It is safer getting one from a pound - here in the UK anyway. Rescue cats are vet checked and treated for any problems, immunised and neutered, if they'[re old enough. Cats from pet shops are rarely given so much care, and may be mistreated or carrying disease.<br>  <br>  Everyone wants tiny kittens, the older ones are harder to find homes for, so I say get an older one. Make sure you get to spend a bit of time with the kittens before you choose, and make sure you pick a good playful one.<br>  <br>  Remember though, kittens may grow out of their playfulness, and the novelty won't last forever for your kids either. Cats live a long time - make sure you want it for the right reasons and are willing to take full responsibility for its care for many years.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|oT71QN8Raa	Honestly, there's no more risk of fleas/ear mites when adopting from a pound verse adopting from someone taking kittens to a pound - I would however opt for the kitten now (from the pound) because at 5 months there's still most of that kitten cuteness and hyperness going on without all the hassle of litter-training :)  And, there's a better chance that you are actually saving a life, considering 90% of people thinking about adopting will want to wait till sping to get a smaller, younger kitten.  And plus, having a kitten now is MUCH more fun than waiting to get a kitten :)|`|VkXQq2y2aa	I don't think it matters either way...you are still saving a kitten.<br>  If you feel like waiting...wait...<br>  if you want one now...just get one now.<br>  <br>  =]|`|zbyd3Eoraa	Every cat you get should be vet checked regardless.I would keep my eyes open and rescue one sometimes you can look around at restaurants and you will find one that needs a good home,or one to give away in classified ads or at a kill shelter for cats.Get one from the most likely candidate that has the worst life or no life.|`|vxyHnqc5aa	All my cats came from friends or family.  When I took the 1st one to the vets for vaccination the vet asked where I had got her from.  I told her from one of my daughters school friends.  She said you could tell she had come from a family home rather than a shelter as she was much more relaxed, calm and friendly.<br>  <br>  If you have kids I would pick a kitten that is used to a busy family home.  Hope this helps your decision.|`|AA10063288	I was just at the pound on Friday and they have tons of kittens now. Of course, I live in Arizona where it is warm all the time. I highly recommend adopting a shelter pet. My pound puppy came with a free vet check and was already spayed. The vet checked her thoroughly and she has been a healthy dog.|`|RN1wGlWWaa	Shelters try to have their kittens vaccinated, dewormed and checked for ear mites/fleas before you adopt, so you should be ok.  But I would still take the kitten to your vet within a day or two of getting them - that is recommend no matter where you get them from.<br>  <br>  I would also recommend an older kitten rather then younger with kids.  Around 5-6 months old and spayed/neutered would be fine.  Depends on the age of the kids - the younger the kids, the older the kitten and vice versa.<br>  <br>  Be aware that shelters are somewhat reluctant to adopt to a family with kids younger then 6 or 7 yrs old, so check first before you even look at the kittens.<br>  <br>  You also might even consider a cat about a year old that is used to kids.  They will still play a lot.  Kittens are only kittens for a short time.  Most cats will play into their teens!|`|AJxl0IvHaa	either way... kittens are more likely to have fleas and ear mites, shelter pets are more thankful i think.<br>  Shelter cats are awsome.<br>  Try craigslist.com<br>  just look at the ads.<br>  Some people had oops litters and are about to take them to the pound because THEY didnt spay.<br>  Good luck with what ever you do!!!!<br>  Its fun but hard to let your kids pick out their perfect pet!<br>  One wants one, the other wants another one and will cry!!

I know an english saddle brand that works (thoroughgood high withered, extra wide saddle), but not western. <br>      If full QH bars pinch his withers, you are going to need a thicker pad, a sway back pad (filled in the middle), or go up to a draft width saddle. Unfortunately, the draft width ones are usually not made for higher withers.|`|503d9ec02105447e5fb64bf3f4d54952aa	19inch seat is the seat size, that is a pretty darn big seat unless you're a very big rider. If you have a horse with high withers and a big barrel you might want to try something with full quarter bars or get one custom for an x-wide tree  <br>  <br>  and from there on you can choose what type of saddle to get, if it for  western pleasure, flat or jumping or trail. <br>  goodluck!<br>  <br>  <br>  sounds like you're going to have to get one custom fit if you want it for a barrel horse with high withers barrel body and such.

I wish You luck though I know how frustrated this can be!
7Tyv6zG7aa	it usually takes about 2 months for a cat to carry her babies. Blood might mean a kitten stuck. Keep an eye on her.

Maybe you can figure out who the dog belongs to & return it to its owners telling them what had happened to you.<br>  <br>  With a paper route you see everything & you should be able to recognize the the dogs when you see it again.

It only triggers their "prey" instinct or possibly their herding instinct, if they're in that group.  Avoid eye contact, ignore, curve in a large semicircle around the dog to get away, lick your lips, yawn...those are ALL, believe it or not, calming signals that dogs use with each other and it DOES work with humans/dogs.

The weekend feeders are not very good, because the uneaten food turns into ammonia, nitrite, then nitrates. Purchasing an autofeeder at your local fish store is better. Check the fish for signs of stress and disease.

7nGhHv3Saa	Watch the mousie for a bit. It's so kind of you to take the time to call the vet. Your awesometastic! you can use gloves for the health issue or pick him/her up with a warm towel. If it is a field mouse then you should really let it back into the wild, that's where they were meant to be. Also just watch him/her for a bit to see how he/she is doing every once in awhile. Good Luck~!|`|6KxBqnstaa	Call a wildlife rehabber in your area who may take the mouse. It is free. Many vets will take injured wildlife as well. He may have been hurt or still in shock. They do tend to play dead if feel they are threatened and he will see you as a predator as well. I would put in a nice aquarium with paper towels and a toilet paper roll (just the cardboard part) and put some cheerios, a little bread with peanut butter, some bird see, and a tiny little soda cap full of water. Put a heating pad under the bottom of container(outside bottom) and cover cage half way. Keep in a dim lit quiet room and let him regain his strength. If he is bleeding anywhere put some cornstarch or flour on wound. But know without medical care infection is likely to set in. Can keep as pet but he will probably always be afraid so I would say if he makes full recovery put back where found him. Does not sound as if he is a baby especially if eyes were open once. Usually when in shock eyes are closed. Try putting a bell on your cats collar to warn all wildlife of his presence. Good of you to help this litter critter. And don't worry I handle them all the time at the wildlife center and just wash your hands well after each encounter with the mouse or wear latex gloves. :)|`|OrvTG44laa	You need to release the mouse back into the wild.  Mice can carry deadly diseases that can be transmitted to humans.  Wild mice are not used to human contact, and therefore will most likely bite.  This is a great opportunity for diseases to spread.  Even if you wash your hands, it can still be transmitted through bites and scratches.  He will most likely die if you keep him.  The stress from the sudden change will be too much for him.  He will be used to wild and will most likely not eat or drink.  If it is a baby, it will need it's mother.  Babies are either pink or have fuzzy hair.  Their eyes are usually closed or only partially opened.  A baby mouse should be a little smaller than your thumb.  An adult is about half the size of your palm. <br>  I suggest just putting it back outside.  If it is an adult, it has a chance to survive.  If it is a baby, it's almost as good as dead.  Many baby mice die with their mothers.  Imagine it's chances with a human caring for it?  You could try raising it, but it is too risky because of disease.

They carry all kinds of diseases and bacteria, including those that cause lyme disease. I do not recommend keeping it as a pet as it could pose a health risk to yourself and your pets. Try taking it to a wildlife rehabilitation center or something. They will know what to do with it.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mus_musculus" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mus_musculu...</a>  <br>  <br>  And also, to save future generations of mice, please keep your cat indoors or have a playpen built for it.|`|AA11902187	Don't keep him. He's a 'wild' animal, even though he's not very wild.<br>  <br>  If he was a baby, he would have opened his eyes by around the 14th day. I don't think he's 14 days old. He's probably older than that. Adult mice are still very small too!<br>  <br>  He could have a bunch of diseases: west nile, rabies, etc. If you wash your hands, you should be fine. Use antibacterial soap. If he BITES you, you're in big trouble, missy.<br>  <br>  The mouse is probably in shock. The vet could be able to save him, but you'd have to spend a lot of money. I don't think you should do that just for a field mouse. Just release him and hope that he gets better. If you're looking for a pet, go to the pet store and buy yourself a pet mouse, hamster, gerbil, rat, dwarf hamster, rabbit, ferret, guinea pig, etc.
AJxl0IvHaa	Since they know where the new ones are, go ahead and take the old ones away, and store them somewhere maybe in a garage.<br>  And see what happends.|`|I5RuJPONaa	Yes, you're already doing it right.<br>  You can take away the old ones if they use the new ones.<br>  You won't have any probs.<br>  An important note: If you baby your cats now, be sure to baby them at least as often when the baby arrives. Also include them when you are spending time with the baby. <br>  Cats get jealous if they feel "replaced" by your baby. It gives them reason to act up such as peeing or pooping somewhere else, etc.<br>  Cats and babies do fine together.|`|lTsDwY9Paa	If your cats are well litter trained and are already using the new boxes I'd take up the old boxes and see how they do.|`|QS7gq7Fzaa	I just wrote the same question ..I got lot of good  answers<br>  Yes you can.|`|ZlfPl6B1aa	They wont even notice..just make sure you pick them up and put them into it..they will know!<br>  <br>  I have to move my litter box ALL the time when we have guests..all i do is pick up the fur ball and show her..(she could really careless..)<br>  <br>  when i got my new litter box--same thing!

But now you can move it faster instead of slowly.  You just don't want to take that one place to potty away all of the sudden or they might be confused.  Once the old box is near the new ones, you can get rid of it, they will have the new ones infused with the scent and be using those all the time.  Good luck!!
LOH6UVh7aa	I am glad spring is coming on the 20th!!  Here are a few examples- Swimming(if able), bike riding, yoga,  satires, walking/running in sand(if able), squats, lunges, hills. These all will help you.|`|03g0WSvZaa	You can get in shape using the Lil Jack workout <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKCGe2Ezris" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKCGe2Ezr...</a>|`|6a221e63714f9d33724ccb40cd162c0aaa	In almost any horse-y magazine (like Practical Horseman), there is usually a little column with good exercises to get you more flexible and stronger for riding. Lots of core work (google "plank exercise", that's a good one, or just "core exercises") and leg work (lunges, etc.) will help get you in shape. But of course, there's no better way than just riding! Even if you're sore the next day - you're stronger!
m0e3a3gWaa	The nipping of fins is only a problem when they are very young.<br>  Once they get to about 5-6  inches it is no longer an issue.<br>  <br>  What you need to do is feed the heavily.<br>  This is what I eluded to regarding your other question about when to move them to the 55 gallon tank.<br>  Its is really important that you feed your baby piranhas a minimum of 3 times a day.<br>  At that age they will certainly canabilize eachother if they are the slighest bit hungry.<br>  At this age I would be feeding them cichlid pellets, flakes, frozen blood worms and mysis shrimp.<br>  Oddly enough, I have never found RB's to really enjoy frozen brine shrimp.<br>  Once they get to 4 inches you can cut them back to twice a day feeding on the foods I have just mentioned.<br>  When they get to about 6 inches, this is where the fun begins!<br>  You can start feeding them whole fish fillets, whole shrimps, scallops, Squid.<br>  This is when feeding time becomes really fun.<br>  At this point you should be feeding them once a day, and not feeding them at all at least one day a week.<br>  Just a word on live food.<br>  I do feed my piranhas live food (comets).<br>  Why deny them a thousand years of instinct?<br>  I do this only on occasion.<br>  I have a 50 gallon set up for my feeders.<br>  When I first purchase them I treat them for EVERYTHING.<br>  Ich, flukes, anchor worm, bacterial and fungal infections, internal parasites.<br>  This process takes 2-3 weeks.<br>  Doing it this way I have never had an issue in 15 years.|`|86b135e0c5c7fa8152fab546e88b509caa	What size tank are they in? Piranhas don't play happy families with each other, I presume you have Red Bellied Piranhas. They are notorious for attacking one another in the confines of an aquarium, often losing eyes, fins and lives to their tank mates. <br>  <br>  Unless you have at least a 6ftx2ftx2ft tank I would suggest returning these fish and getting an alternative such as the solitary Serrasalmus rhombeus (Black Piranha) or the vegetarian Myleus rubripinnis (Red Hook Silver Dollar), these of course also depend on what size tank you can provide.|`|8wsBhQmFaa	you can't, its just what they do
wiAT7gkWaa	I found the best cage for my mice was a wooden one, with mesh squares (less than 1cm squared each square, they can still escape through 1cm squared).<br>  That way you can make your own, and make it as you like..<br>  All the breeders i spoke to highly recommended them, as its the most natural environment for them to be in.|`|xyPpruSjaa	Hello! As an owner of BOTH a hamster and 2 mice (and 2 gerbils) I would have to say the best Best BEST of all cages would be a glass tank with a mesh lid. I have NEVER had any animal escape out of a tank. Mice and dwarf hamsters are very VERY good escape artists so getting a mesh lid is mandatory. They are also very easy to clean, but a bit heavy. You can usually find both a 10-20 gallon glass aquarium and a mesh lid that fits it in the pet store. Believe it or not, they usually are less expensive than those plastic cages! A long long time ago, I had a Habitrail cage with the bars and plastic and 'petting zone' Wellllll it just so happens that one of my mouse's tail got stuck between the bars and the plastic and half of it snapped off! Yuck!!!! I don't even have a clue how this happened but the other half got stuck in the 'petting zone' lid and snapped off! All while I was at school. <br>  <br>  Aquariums are the ONLY cage I can trust with my small animals. (Obviously not to be used with rabbits, rats, or guinea pigs because they're too big)<br>  <br>  If you have any questions or need any help email me at averyrazno@yahoo.com|`|4vrUbRujaa	i use a aquarium tank and a tank topper, it dosen't have any best brand it's just which one u like the best.|`|Lq4LXs7kaa	i would go w/a simple glass tank cage because its the safest and prety big....i have one and its great!!!!also esy to clean andhamster never escaped in my life and i had like 5 :) that what i recommend to everyone!!!!!|`|7SyCZnM9aa	I use to have a CritterTrail X for my mouse.

tPGxPDvBaa	Yes.  I have seen many with kids of all ages & mine loved kids even though I don't have any. They are good lil sturdy dogs so they can be handled without the risks of being injured as easily as other small dogs.  My clients have them with infants to teens w/o any problems but of course the dog & the family has to be trained to respect each other boundaries.|`|uCCteyPpaa	NO.|`|IJr0MR1Aaa	Terriers, especially wire coat terriers, tend be be very active and tend toward dog aggression.  They wil also be intolerant of children's sometimes inappropriate play and or picking on and teasing dog.  They can also get aggressive with children when they run and/or squeal in playing unless closely supervised.<br>  <br>  Better to get a Newfoundland, best with young children; a Boxer, Beagle, Labrador Retriever, AmStaff or APBT (pit bull), for exuberant children to be a playmate; or a Golden Retriever as a companion for less exuberant children.  GSDs (German Shepherd Dogs) are very protective of children and will often complain if children are spanked and are quick to get you to check on any crying child, whether or not they are part of the family.|`|ZGFXBie9aa	I wouldn't reccomend them for small children... they are a terror (oops, I mean terrier...) and get a bit rough and rambunctious... you might have dominance issues with small children, as well.|`|GSf09ALBaa	Raised with children they are fine.  They are TERRIERS, which mean they have high prey drive and can be a challenge when it comes to training.|`|KmC0K59taa	No, they are not.|`|yRrLsRpmaa	The hardy West Highland White Terrier, more commonly known as the "Westie," is known for its friendly, strong-willed personality and a remarkably bright white coat. Said to be "all terrier," this breed possesses a large amount of spunk, determination and devotion stuffed into a compact little body. <br>  <br>  The Westie loves people and makes an affectionate addition to any family. This devoted, happy and faithful dog also makes a wonderful travel companion due to its small size. <br>  <br>  So it can be if trained, socialized and treated right. Generally they're good dogs, but since there's so many variables for families, there's always a possibility that it might not be. You should speak to a reputable breeder about what's best for your family.|`|LMIbyvxWaa	I have one and as long as you train them well they are fine. Mine would never hurt anybody and especially children. If somebody comes in the door that she doesnt know she will bark but if it is a child she will not. The only thing is that they can be very overprotective but it depends on how you train your dog. A dog is only a result of its owner!|`|f6be38fa4f0a14b54a53885b1dcdae82aa	You don't mention your family make up. Children? Ages?  Westies are not great dogs with small children in my experience. I have had Bostons, Scotties and Westies all before I had children. Though I socialized each of them very well, they had little patience with youngsters.
F3FrZ7eAaa	Ask your parents WHY they hate snakes, and clear up any misconceptions. They make really great pets and are very low maintenance. Try persuading them by telling them all their good points. Like, they...<br>  <br>  -eat once a week (less than that when they're adults)<br>  -poop/pee once a week<br>  -become VERY docile depending on species.<br>  -make any noise<br>  -don't smell at all-- only if you don't pick up their poop.<br>  <br>  If you have a Birthday coming up, that's what you can ask for. Good luck,|`|niztxto9aa	Well if you've told them and they know how responsible you are then just tell them all you've said so far about you cleaning and caring for it on your own and that they wont even have to lay eyes on because it will be in your own room(if you have one). Just assure them that it wont get out and they wont have to see it. Good luck.|`|8SKjbMFwaa	Maybe start out with another pet that they DO like and show how responsible you are. Maybe then they will let you get a snake. This is one of those things, though, where there may be nothing you can do. Sorry.|`|FtBqmFDEaa	This is a tough one it might be hard to persuade them. I had a couple of Garter snakes when I was your age but my parents were quite supportive. <br>  <br>  They do live for quite a while, mine were 10 years old when they died. Are you prepared to take them with you to college or when you live in a flat of your own in years to come?
eG7VKXz9aa	The only real way to know is to take the ferret to a vet to get an x-ray. Especially if it cannot walk on it and/or makes noises like its in pain when it does. <br>  <br>  Regardless, the ferret needs to see a vet now.|`|GeNRUzDfaa	if u cant go to the vet i would see if your ferret can walk on it. after that if can't put a wrap on it. but if they can don't mess with it. hope there fine. wish you could go to the vet if it is not walking.|`|dXn8JaZjaa	well, since no one here is a licensed veterinarian, and no one here can take an x-ray, the only way to be sure if the leg is broken is to take it to the vet!|`|jyGTlpzTaa	Vet. Now.|`|d6kekKgeaa	what did you do tho the ferret?
pxqPEm9Aaa	You will need to get soil from a reptile store. I would not trust regular pesticide free potting soil <br>  <br>  Also, I am unsure of the frog species, but most of the captive bred and kept amphibians require an under tank heater. Your American bull frog may not. You may want to google that part. <br>  <br>  But for the most part, a 10 gallon is plent. It will be fine on crickets.
IJr0MR1Aaa	If it was just your 4 mo old, I say it was a rebellious stage they go through about that age.  If you stay calm and work through it, it doesn't last long.  It could be you were still upset over the 4 mo old's behavior that you transmitted your insecurity to the 3 year old.  Dogs always want a pack leader.  If they perceive emotional weakness, they will try to take over that position.  Some breeds are quicker to try to become the leader than others.  Rottweilers come to mind as well as most terriers.<br>  <br>  When they pull and a correction doesn't work; try slowing your pace way down.  The more they get impatient. the more you slow.  As soon as they slow and look at you, even for a moment, say "good heel" or whatever your walking nicely command is and pick up your speed to norma.  If they start to pull again, repeat going slow.  Every time he pulls, go slow.  Every time he walks with you, immediately increase pace and praise by including the name of what he did right.  <br>  <br>  After your dog learns to stop pulling for several minutes.  Reward by running for a ways.<br>  <br>  <br>  If it wasn't you they were reacting to, do you know if anything unusual was happening in your walking area?|`|wUg7iYU1aa	When they start to pull. Make them sit and stay, do not go forward. That will give you time to calm down and then try again if they pull turn around walk the other way and make them sit and stay until YOU are ready to move forward. They'll get the picture, that if they do not behave and walk properly then they do not get to walk at all.|`|NAGiNKFWaa	It was the new moon, well at least that is my excuse when it all goes wrong.  I practice with a puppy in my back yard first and when they can handle the drama in my back yard, we graduate to the street, and if we have a set back we head back to the back yard.  Puppies do better with the leash around 4 to 5-months-old, so you really have a waiting game here.  I don't allow them much leash, and they walk by my side, not enough leash to walk ahead of me.  I have leg issues, and the walk is my walk, so we walk as fast as I can walk, and no faster.  If they pull on the leash, I stop and say "wait" and we wait.  When I am ready to go again, I say "go" and we go.  When they pull on the leash again, I stop and say "wait" and we "wait" again, even if we just went two steps.  It is my walk and maybe I want to look at a flower, or count to ten or change the batteries in my walkman.  When I am ready again, I say "go".  I walk laps in my back yard, and it takes a few laps of "wait" and "go" and praises when they are doing good to get the message.  I talk soothing to my dogs when I walk them and praise them when they do good.  I have had days where I feel like I corrected them a million times, and one day where I just dropped all the leashes and sat in a chair in my yard and cried my eyes out.  Dogs can sometimes sense when the weather is going to snap, or a new of full moon may cause them to act up, and that is the story I am sticking to.  So on days when it all goes south, I give up the walk and we play ball. I like walking in my back yard to stay calm because the street stresses me out, so we just walk laps in the yard.  It is also easier for me to correct behaviors without worrying about traffic coming.  My husband walks them in the street, but I get stressed at how neglected my neighbors dogs are, so I just can't do it here.  I play gospel music in my walkman so I don't get stressed, and I "wait" however long it takes to calm down.  Give it some more time, the puppy is still little.  Remember to make a big fuss when the walk is over, that helps too.|`|lDXh0jRVaa	Yes, there are different puppy stages- one resembling a teenage stage (that they will go through a few times) where they get stubborn, inattentive, and irritating. I'm sure the reason your older dog started misbehaving is either because you walk them together and he started picking up the bad habits of your 4 month old or you were so frazzled from working with the 4 month old that your 3 year old decided to take advantage of you :-P<br>  Good luck, these stages can run anywhere from a couple days to a couple months but they do stop!
QpElKY8Kaa	She could be QH and still gait.  A friend of mine has a QH mare with as smooth a gait as you could wish for.  Two of her last three foals also gait.(by QH sires)  She's Impressive bred, HYPP N/N.  <br>   The Spanish Mustang / TB cross was the origin of the QH.        Many, many Mustangs gait.

She looks too stocky to be a TWH, but hey, some of them are pretty stocky, so she could really be either. She doesn't look Spanish to me, and she's not the right color to be a KMSH, RMH, or a SSH. And she doesn't have the neck to be a Saddlebred. Also, chestnut is the most common color for MFTs.|`|V7Y9ldTUaa	If you can figure out what gait it is she has, it would narrow it down a bit. The pictures make it almost impossible to tell.|`|RUxRNsf4aa	You cant really tell a horses breed from pictures, only make a good guess. You say shes gaited? My guess is Tennessee Walking Horse.|`|meoRbjgCaa	I would guess a Missouri Fox Trotter|`|cbbxV62Uaa	going by looks alone i would think she's a missouri fox trotter or one of the stockier tennessee walking horses, however it's pretty near impossible to guess a horse's breed by a picture alone and no other info. for all we know, it could be a mixed breed.<br>  <br>  edit: off conformation alone it's obvious that she's not even close to being a saddlebred or paso, and is too stocky to be a standardbred.|`|WPGU48Kuaa	I am a real good judge of breed, but these are terrible pictures.

1gDTiPVyaa	Make sure the cage is big enough for him to spread his wings and fly a little bit without bumping into toys or perches.<br>  <br>  Make sure he has toys, a swing, perches (NO sandpaper covered ones) preferably manzanita branches, of a couple of different sizes to help keep his feet exercised. <br>  <br>  Pelleted diet: Harrison's, Lafeberts, ZuPreem, Roudy Bush all have good reps as does T(otally) O(rganic) P(ellets). No bird should be on an all seed diet, but if that's what he's eating at Petsmart, that's what you'll have to start with. Choose a pellet variety and see about gradually introducing it to his diet and getting him switched over--it'll help him live longer and be healthier in the long run. <br>  <br>  Unless he's already hand-tamed, don't expect him to hop right out of the cage and sit on your shoulder. You'll have to work to get there and it may take weeks or even months. It can take a while. I've done using short, frequent training sessions in a small, closed, bird-proof and bird-safe room. I usually use my bathroom because it's easier to clear of hazards and there's fewer places to hide. (Make sure the toilet lid is down, though and there's no water in the bathtub or sink.) <br>  <br>  Go to birdsafe.com for a list of hazards to your bird and some ways of removing or lessening some of the most common hazards. Some of it's obvious stuff like: don't turn on the stove unless the bird is secure in his room or his cage. Other stuff like: don't leave standing water is a little less obvious. Also there's a list of hazardous plants, chemicals and foodstuffs. <br>  <br>  Locate a certified avian veterinarian in your area and make contact as soon as you can. It's a good idea to take the bird for a "well-bird" exam as soon as you get him. Find out if they have an emergency number or if there's a 24 hour vet clinic in the area. You don't want to have to get on Yahoo! Answers at 3am, only to be told you need to just get to vet and not know where that is. Trust me when I say that bird emergencies only happen at 3am--it's nice to have your vets home phone number, just in case. <br>  <br>  Have a fund set up for vet bills or look into pet insurance. My cockatiel cost me $681 for one series of vet trips. It was more than I was prepared for. (She cost me more out of pocket than my 5 day hospital stay did!) Be ready.<br>  <br>  Not trying to be a downer--just that this is stuff you need to be ready for, just in case.<br>  <br>  Parakeets are wonderful, fun, silly little birds and great little buddies. Get yourself a couple of parakeet care books. The "For dummies" book series is usually pretty good--you might start there. Read as much as you can, as often as you can and read about the bigger birds, too. Don't forget that your parakeet is really just a tiny, little parrot. <br>  <br>  Best of luck to you and have fun.|`|K0tpQoHRaa	well at first he will be a little scared of you and less active,unless bought with another.you will just need to let it see your face as much as posible and it would get used to being around you.then you can start to stick your hand in the cage more often so that it would know your hand and when ever near dont mind talking to it.say something when you change food like (are you hungry)get to know your voice as well once the birds starts to interact with you you will know you have created a bond,it start to come up to you whenever you are near.millets are the best treats for them.and love being goffy when enjoying them like nodding its head. they also like spending time with you like watching tv or just out with you for some time.<br>  <br>  Good luck @ it!!<br>  <br>  BEST ANSWER!!|`|7Mc0snS9aa	They eat a lot, and they poop a lot, so that means cleaning his cage a lot, but this isnt so bad if theres newspaper on the bottom.  They need to be let out to fly around a room for excersize about an hour a day.  And if you spend enough time with them they can eventually pick up words.  But don't expect progress right away because when you get them from the pet store they are so young.<br>  <br>  I love my parakeet, his name is Bosworth.|`|kwHIpsTRaa	Well they eat a lot. my parakeets like eating and drinking, and they make lots of noise.. so be prepared. you need to change there water alot and sometimes mine go in the water dish and use it as a bath, so that can make it dirtier.. but i think they sell these bath things they can clean in. mine like perches and things they can swing from, so you can buy those and put them in your cage. make sure its big enough cage. ..And they usually make noise [tweeting] it means there happy, or somethings wrong [ex. one of my parakeets starting making noise when the other one died] but if there not moving around much or being quiet.. its kinda weird. And lastly.. if you put a sheet or blanket or something like that over the cage they will probably quiet down. and you need to clean the cage alot.. [putting paper on the bottom, which we do] and if they run out of food and theres lots on the bottom then they can eat off the bottom if you cant get some soon.

OyNJTWaiaa	Budgies generally dont have the swollen rear end for four days without showing extreme distress and illness if they cannot pass an egg. However, there is a condition which we call internal egg laying, whereby the bird has an issue with her muscle control and she cannot actually form the egg and expel it from her body. In essence the eggs stay soft, a shell is not formed and it stays within the body. If you feel the swelling gently and it feels like an egg with shell then she is taking far too long to deliver her egg. If you feel the swelling and its all soft and mooshy and no shell can be felt, she is laying internally and will not produce the egg you are hoping for. When this happens the egg is reabsorbed back into her system and no amount of pushing will deliver it. If the egg isnt reabsorbed back into her system she can get egg peritonitus and she can die. If you check her over and it seems like she is laying internally then its time to stop her egglaying, remove the nestbox, and give her a long holiday. Birds that do this have lost muscle tone...due to inactivity, loss of flying space or often just old age. <br>  I have brought this issue up because you have said she is taking four days and she has a swelling. If she had a properly formed egg to lay you would see the swelling and then egg over just 2 days. If she was eggbound by now she would be ill, sitting sideways with a leg ****** in the air, and looking very very sick. Four days with a swelling and no egg, tells me internal egg laying. That means stop her breeding for a long long time and maybe never breed from her again.|`|c5anDswjaa	She may be egg bound, which means she cant pass her egg..

A swollen vent is one sure sign.  Birds can't be pregnant, but rather carry eggs and then lay them.  You can help her lay the egg by placing a heating pad under the cage.  Make sure it's secure.  Also, you can apply a little vaseline to the budgie's vent, which may help it pass the egg.   Your budgie needs extra calcium, too, so give her plenty of cuttlebone or mineral block.  Some humidity can also help your bird out.  Turn on the shower in the bathroom and let your caged budgie stay there for awhile.  Sometimes budgies will hide their eggs under the nesting material so, yes, it's possible.|`|5s4IV7RAaa	it sounds like she may be egg bound. You need to seek immediate veterinary help.

FtBqmFDEaa	White cloud mountain minnows prefer a much lower temperature so I wouldn't advise keeping them in a "tropical" set up. Bleeding Heart Tetras are nice in a shoal of 4 or 5. What about Marbled hatchet fish? They quite hardy, I've had my 5 since I set my tank up 4 years ago. <br>  <br>  Cherry barbs are also another good bet, as mentioned above. I have 6, 3 male 3 female. Very colourful.|`|7KxQXHzOaa	clouded minnows are good with the fish you have listed.  I guess if you don't want neon tetras then you don't want glowing zebra danios (come in hot pink, green, and orange)<br>  good luck|`|7erjLpuWaa	You are looking for community fish that are very peaceful?  I have glowlight tetras--they are a schooling fish that max out at 1.3 inches.  Cherry Barbs are also extremely peaceful, but are a bit bigger as they grow to be 2 inches.  The cherrys might be good for your tank, since they occupy every level of it.  They need to be in groups of at least 4 and are a personal favorite of mine!  I've only heard good things about the white clouds as well.  All of these fish are very hardy also.|`|jnzSz3tRaa	white cloud minnows are good for what you have.  how bout some sparkling gouramis, they look cool.  honey gouramis, endler's livebearers, maybe some amano shrimp|`|prU72N2Vaa	Neon tetras.

mwVCFlLTaa	If you need to ask and don't already have a dog, the likely answer is No.  BCs are a huge time commitment.   You can't run a puppy (bad for growing bones) so until he's older, how will he  get exercised?  You didn't mention any training or dog sports, and unless you and your parents are willing to commit to going to training every week and practicing at home- not just for a 6-8 week course, but for most of the pup's life, then  a BC is more likely to train you and end up neurotic than ending up a well behaved pet.<br>  <br>  Sorry, don't mean to sound harsh, but have rescued too many BCs from beautiful homes with big back yards and kids who have seen BCs on TV and in the movies and think that getting a smart dog will make life easier- trust me, it makes life much harder!<br>  <br>  Consider getting a lab or a spaniel or some other hunting type dogs- they are usually very trainable, social, and don't develop as many neuroses as BCs.  Just make sure you find a good breeder!|`|62hGVNhoaa	I got a 2 year old rescue Border Collie a year ago and she is the best thing I've ever brought into the family!<br>  It sounds like we have similar surroundings, we walk for around an hour morning and evening and about 1/2 hour lunchtime. She has free access to the garden when I'm at home. She loves playing with balls, tennis balls, footballs, rugby balls - doesn't matter!<br>  We haven't had a problem with cats (she's very good with them) or any of the destructive behaviour that BCs have a reputation for.<br>  I would say if you are at home a lot and prepared to put the work in you will have a fun and loyal companion.|`|OFpl236faa	Border Collies require a lot more exercise than just a daily run. They also need mental stimulation and need a job. So unless you are willing to participate in something like agility, flyball, herding or something of that nature, a Border Collie probably isn't right for you. They are very busy dogs and require a lot of work on your part. You could go and adopt an older one maybe who isn't quite as high drive, but I would look into other breeds. Border Collies also tend to stare at cats and try to herd them, which most cats don't appreciate :)|`|yRrLsRpmaa	This high-drive breed is extremely energetic and requires exercise beyond just a walk around the block or a romp in the yard. They thrive when they have a job to do and space to run. Due to their tendency to herd objects and people, they do best with mature, well-behaved children. They love their families, but may be somewhat reserved with strangers. They are seasonal shedders, and require regular brushing.<br>  <br>  <br>  So basically it's a dog that NEEDS a job. They are made to work all day to tend their flock. If you don't give them a job they may try to herd you. You might want to look up Border Collie groups in your area. They can give you a better idea of jobs for it.|`|xktfWz5Caa	Border Collies are AWESOME but very very energetic.  If you get one, please be committed to walking him or her every day.  They need lots of exercise.  They are extremely intelligent and very loyal.  I had one that I found as a stray.  She was covered with mange and was literally skin and bone.  She lived 18 years by my side.  I adored her but had to euthanize her a few years ago due to Alzheimer's if you can believe that.|`|AA10500537	border collies are quite a big dog a sheltie would ne nice ,|`|4ZYrnaTxaa	As long as you know your border collie will be exercised sufficiently daily, I think it's an excellent idea.

veDvtYhJaa	Basically puppy mills are commercial dog breeding businesses.  <br>  <br>  The problem with puppy mills is that they keep all the b! tches in crates and some never get any time walking around a yard.  They tend to breed the female every time she goes into heat.  They often keep all those crates stacked inside a building all along the walls so only the dogs on top have noone peeing or pooping on them.  Often these breeding buildings are not air conditioned, and often the dogs are not immunized or given much health care.<br>  <br>  I don't know if there are any reputable commercial dog breeders who breed large volumes of dogs and yet treat the dogs well.  All the ones I've ever heard of didn't give much care to the dogs. -!-|`|18f339d2d88d8a05cc418425220b52e1aa	Did you try Googling it or use the yahoo search engine?<br>  <br>  NO.<br>  <br>  From yahoo Q&A on the same topic<br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/search/search_result;_ylt=Avg5cHZYbH28XAV6Z.PgILQazKIX;_ylv=3?p=What+is+a+puppy+mill">http://answers.yahoo.com/search/search_r...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://search.yahoo.com/search?p=What%20are%20puppy%20mills">http://search.yahoo.com/search?p=What%20...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://search.yahoo.com/search?p=what%20is%20a%20backyard%20breeder">http://search.yahoo.com/search?p=what%20...</a><br>  <br>  Puppy mills are very very bad so are BACK YARD BREEDERS|`|bd071971ac36c92a5d8fe8733f388859aa	The animals there are constantly being bred to produce puppies for money without regard for the health of the mother or the puppies. Poor nutrition, no health care, dirty conditions. Many of the puppies will have health problems for life. Very disgusting.|`|OFpl236faa	It's a place where puppies are mass produced. Usually, they breed more than one type of dog, breed a lot of mixes and only keep dogs that produce. The dogs are kept in horrid living conditions, aren't seen by a vet, don't have proper food, water and shelter. It's really sad and a horrible place for a dog. The dogs aren't socialized and there are usually a lot of them! Some of the busts I've heard about, there are usually 100+ dogs. Most pet stores get their puppies from puppy mills. It's best to really research if you are going to get a puppy from a breeder so you can avoid supporting puppy mills or back yard breeders.|`|fc4NOCp3aa	I'm so glad you asked this question because so many potential dog owners go out there looking to buy a dog & don't even realize these horrible places exist.  <br>  <br>  Puppy mills are basically run by people who care only about making the most money and not about the dogs.  They usually have 2 or 3 females who they keep continually pregnant.  They don't get regular vet care, human interaction, are not fed or watered properly and are often abused verbally & even physically.  Many aren't even let out of their kennels for regular exercise.  Of course, the unsuspecting dog shopper doesn't know any better.  All he or she sees is the cute, adorable puppy that is presented to him or her.  The thing is, people who run these puppy mills could care less about the health of that puppy so 9 times out of 10, the puppy they've just sold you will have more health problems than if you bought from a reputable breeder.  <br>  <br>  If you're going to buy a dog, it's best to do your research and try to buy from a shelter.  If you refuse to buy a shelter dog, then at least research and make sure the breeder you buy from is a good one who actually cares for his or her dogs in a humane way.|`|6SeWCfUfaa	It's a PETA term.  It's a phrase used to get people all upset and supporting their legislation which will take rights away from animal owners.  You see, PETA does not want any of us to own dogs at all.  So they go keep showing footage of a commercial breeder bust that happened in the 70's ... saying they're new "puppy mill" busts.  And then they get you believing that every commercial breeder is a puppy mill.  And then they put forth "anti-puppy mill" bills in states that uneducated people support, because it sounds like a good idea to get rid of puppy mills.  But in reality, most of that legislation is aimed at making it more and more difficult for people to own and breed well bred dogs.<br>  <br>  If you think I'm making this up, I suggest you get out there and find out what's really happening and find out what laws are pushed in different parts of the US.  Find out from hobby breeders (those are the responsible good breeders) what they think of the "anti-puppy mill laws.<br>  <br>  That's not to say there aren't bad commercial breeders out there and that there aren't places that are as bad as the puppy mills sound.  But - puppy mills are not our only problem and they are not the only source of neglected animals.  Even some very well intentioned rescue people have turned into "hoarders" that keep animals in conditions just as bad as any puppy mill you could think of.<br>  <br>  So before you get on the anti-puppy mill bandwagon, please make sure you understand what it is all about ... top to bottom.  Because things are not always as they seem.|`|0C0Dz4b1aa	A puppy mill is a large-scale commercial dog breeding operation where profit is given priority over the well-being of the dogs.

OAzJPUkHaa	Not at all, it's a pretty common and unfortunate misconception, since it usually leads to a crab having a tiny amount of substrate or surface molters being tossed out as dead.  <br>  Changing shells is a relativity simple process that takes only a few seconds for a crab after he picks the best shell and will take place as many times as a particular crab needs(some will change more than others).  As long as they are given a good amount of shells(at least three per crab, preferable more), boil them every so often(I boil once a week), and change them out there's no danger.  <br>  Molting is the process of removing their exoskeleton which will take place a few times a year.  They generally bury into the substrate(not to be confused with a new crab, which may also burrow or a digger) to molt, and take a good one or two months (micros will probably take less time, jumbos more).  When done the crabs and the crabs finish recovering and resurface, they'll be hairier and have a better coloring.  When done feed him foods rich in calcium, protein, and chitin.  There is no real danger in letting a normal molter molt in the main tank.  A crab may also surface molt, which is more dangerous.  Isolate any found.  Crabs may or may not change shells before or after a molt.|`|nlRr07dRaa	traditionally molting would mean releasing it's exoskeleton i'm not too sure if they do that. regular crabs do. however they do change shells!|`|fdNbSn0Vaa	no moulting and changing shells are different...moulting before they change shells....but hermit crabs need a variety of shells to pick from after moulting
OaaJ7o9Haa	They don't have a preferred plant, just live. Any number of plants would work, javas, swords, hairgrass, anubias. If you want to breed, fine leafed plants work best. Think hornwort or javas.
Wn3LGHTvaa	Nail polish or paint will work , unless the scutes of the shell are shed, which happens fairly often in young turtles. Just don't go past the edge of the scute. For long-term studies, we usually notch the edge of the shell, which I suspect you do not want to do. You might try photographing them from the top. Many species of turtles, such as red-eared sliders, have subtly different markings. Print out and label the photos. I wouldn't worry too much about names; the turtles don't care.<br>  <br>  If you have juveniles, you aren't going to tell males from females safely. I wouldn't even trust a vet to sex them. Besides, it doesn't make any difference except to another turtle. Once your turtles mature, ask again, mentioning the kind of turtle you have, Some species are very easy to sex, others not so easy.|`|eceLQUj5aa	Go here to find out the sex of your turtle:<a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Tell-if-a-Turtle-Is-Male-or-Female" rel="nofollow">http://www.wikihow.com/Tell-if-a-Turtle-...</a><br>  <br>  It appears that this group is using white out to mark the turtle shells:<br>  <a href="http://www.wildernesscenter.org/Monitoring/TurtleMonitoring.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.wildernesscenter.org/Monitori...</a>|`|d42b944f378c684058ca58d6bc62810eaa	I don't think a little mark with a pen will hurt them.
cOaD442Iaa	well I had tiger barbs that would eat all the food but then i got sinking food and my other fish catch them while they are sinking.Hope this helps|`|aBhW9YVXaa	maybe feed a little in one corner so all the guppies go for it...then once its almost gone..do some more in the other side.|`|krru14Zlaa	divide them  just for feeding in other bowl while the other fish eat their share and in the bowls the guppies eat their share too and then when there finished eating they can go back in.
6cbce34f6d81808399f7101c75d8526baa	No humidity as they are desert reptiles. You can of course mist them a couple of times a week and keep a water bowl in their viv but other than that no water unless you take them out to bathe them. Your basking temp should be 100-110 degrees too.|`|DHCXeLvvaa	it should be kept at 40-50% humidity|`|sxX3mGP0aa	If your tank is open on the top, you don't have to worry as much about having water in there, because it will evaporate and go out, not hang around and cause humidity. If it's closed (screened, really), be careful about that.|`|atxog9hFaa	These animals are desert animals, so I would suggest getting a humidity gauge to make sure that there is very little or no humidity.|`|DzUxBehhaa	Toilet temprature.  You should kill it.

IFGYXPDbaa	My cat had all but 2 of his teeth pulled.<br>  <br>  They gave me some narcotic to administer orally if he seemed like he needed it.<br>  <br>  However, he didn't seem to be very upset or in very much pain.<br>  <br>  He was eating normally Inormal appetite) the day after I brought him home.|`|b2ZwhOqsaa	my cat had some teeth pulled, 5 teeth in all i think. he didnt seem to be in any pain watsoever when he came home, or the day after. he was just a little bit dopey after the surgery<br>  <br>  good luck|`|oDVx7nSxaa	The vet should send you home with pain drugs for her.  Cats feel the same pain that we do, and if we had teeth pulled we'd at the very least be taking Tylenol.  Cats of course can't do that, but pain management is part of any surgery.  The most commonly prescribed pain drug is called Buprenex (butorphinol) - be sure to ask your vet about it.  It's a very low dose, and only for a day or two.  My 16 year old cat was on it after his last dental complete with extraction of a badly abscessed tooth.  It helps in their recovery very much.  <br>  <br>  Your vet will also probably tell you to feed canned only for a couple of days.|`|Tc23KWgzaa	Is she in pain before the surgery?  Her teeth causing her pain?  The pain of recovering from teeth pulling probably is not greater than the dental pain she's experiencing now.<br>  <br>  I wouldn't want that for my cat, esp if she was getting up there in years, so I would ask the dr. for an analgesic.<br>  <br>  Many more happy cat years!<br>  TX Mom<br>  Booboo's mom|`|0vQsoYIbaa	Yes, although dental work may not be as traumatic for animals as it is for humans.  Dogs seem to lose teeth and not pay much attention to it.|`|iL1tYfJMaa	probably no more than you would be. It will likely be tender for about a week. Make sure you do NOT give your cat people aspirin or advil. The vet will give you a painkiller.|`|I9d68kxWaa	Yes of corse why wouldent it lol But i am sure the doctor will give her some thing to stop it hurting.|`|cj31x3UMaa	I had dentals done on 3 cats in December, a couple had to have teeth pulled. Oldest was almost 12 years.<br>  <br>  I did not bring home any pain meds, simply offered canned food alongside the dry food for a week. It was a good thing I have kittens as the adults went right back to their dry food the next day - not the sign of a cat in pain! Kittens scarfed up all the canned food.<br>  <br>  I assume that much has to do w/ the care taken in pulling the teeth... I got to watch. If broken off or improperly done could lead to infection & a lot of pain.|`|lhxe2XOeaa	yes its just like a human getting teeth pulled and usually u can crush a pain reliver and mix it in with soft food to relieve pain<br>  <br>  vote me best answer|`|iDxoM3X8aa	The cat will feel a bit down the same as us when we go to the dentist im sure if there are any problems after the vet will give you something for the cat hope all goes well.|`|pYtnOnbDaa	no different than the pain you would have.  teeth pulled are teeth pulled... make sure you have canned food for her|`|T024qfKZaa	Yes, she will. The vet should give you something for it.|`|DzUxBehhaa	Will you be in pain if I pull your teeth?|`|DdJnmx7Laa	ask yourself if a dentist pulls my teeth would i be in pain???|`|HULRxii5aa	My cat has recently had all his teeth removed. The vet gave him something for the pain which, yes, was bad but he was okay after a while. Then he was also on a course of medication should the pain return. But don't worry, though. Your cat will be okay.|`|Nr16Kjqgaa	Not if they keep her on drugs. It will be the same as it would be for a human.
S3cD0uxXaa	Hmmm....I've hear many stories of little dogs irritating big dogs by barking, chasing them around yapping, etc.When little dogs do this to bigger dogs sometimes they can be pushed to the limit and bite or attack them. If you can I would have her meet with the Maltese again and watch her reactions, off course being leashed and muzzled. Watch the tail, also watch the Maltese's tail and reactions. Then bring your dog back to the park on a leash and see how she reacts. There are always warning signs, they might show you only a few seconds before the attack, but they are there. Stalking, eyes fixated on the dog, tail held up high and stiff,  etc. Watch how she is around smaller dogs, has she been with many? If not maybe she viewed this little one as prey. While I don't know the reason, I would consulate a trainer, although some might tell you your dog is a threat and should be put down. I've heard stories about this many times, it's unbelievable. Any dog can be rehabilitated, death is not the answer. I would highly recommend Cesar Milan's The Dog Whisperer. He fantastic and deals with all sorts of aggression issues. He has a DVD strictly for dealing with aggression. I've learned some wonderful things from him and I bet you can too. Good luck|`|bIaywrBCaa	Sadie attacked because the maltese was invading her territory or her space, also probably thinking she was protecting you.  You have to expect that this can happen again. I would ask the vets in the area for a reliable trainer in your area. I know someone who had chihuahua mixes and a rottweiler. They were all best buddies, ate tohether, slept together. One day the rottie picked up one of the chihuahuas, shook it until it was dead. It happened so fast no one could do anything about it. So the next time Sadie attacks, it could have a bad ending.
5nni4JRyaa	I'm sure they can. It makes sense.|`|UBS4jIAcaa	theres only one cure for this, hotpot|`|HULRxii5aa	When my rabbit did this it turned out she had an infection on her lungs and the little tube things that they breathe with near the lungs. She had to go on medications fo a while. If I were you I would get it checked out ASAP as if it is what my rabbit has, the vet said the longer it goes undetected the worse it can get.<br>  Even if it isn't this go to the vet anyway as it shouldn't be making this noise.|`|P8RLUKrbaa	Hello!<br>  <br>  No rabbits cannot get hiccups, Bunnies may make purring sounds & growling sounds but never 'hiccups' They may also sneeze. If this carries on I would advise a trip to the vets as it may be a nasal passage or respiratory infection!<br>  <br>  Good Luck =)<br>  <br>  Ava xxx|`|juyA6HUJaa	Yes they can have hiccups and sneeze etc. It's nothing to worry about just like it's not with humans.|`|6nQT5NYlaa	no, thier wind passages are not as wide as ours|`|iOhVWOiGaa	I've had a few house rabbits but haven't known one to have hiccups.<br>  <br>  They can make a purring sound like a cat, so maybe it was that?<br>  <br>  They can sneeze too if they've got a cold :)
H6EhJM2Saa	First get it and you can either keep it as a pet or get rid of it don't let your cat in the room where you saw it last  if your not in there. <br>  Just put your cat in there and see where it goes if it wants he mouse the cat should bring you right to it use gloves and get the mouse and do what ever you'll like but I would keep it so that my cat couldn't kill it and look on google saying like wild mice what do they eat I will look now<br>  <br>  Don't get a trap for the mouse it will kill it <br>  go to like <br>  <a href="http://www.newton.dep.anl.gov/askasci/zoo00/zoo00573.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.newton.dep.anl.gov/askasci/zo...</a><br>  <br>  Give it like carrots and seeds it wasn't atig most likely because it was scared and I don't think they eat much.|`|kRssUlazaa	Well you can't do much with a wild mouse. I think the best thing to do for something like this is to get one of those live traps. Once the mouse is in there set it back free! It's easy as that.|`|4vrUbRujaa	it probably doesn't eat sunflower seed... maybe u should try something else like peanuts, and plus pet rats are not different from wild mouse...<br>  i mean if u know how to take care a pet rat, it won't be hard to take care a wild rat. <br>  it probably just scared or hurt, i don't know. make sure don't let the mouse bite u tho...
fYupEegGaa	To start your tank do 2 capfuls (10ml) per 10 gallons.<br>  <br>  EDIT: Also those are not steps. Those are 3 different instructions on different ways to use aqua plus. So if you just wanted to remove chloromine you would just do 1 capfull per 5 gallons. But just do what I told you to do up top.<br>  <br>  EDIT: A little bit extra wont hurt because it is made out of natural ingredients so if you already put too much that is fine. Putting to much may cause your water to get cloudy.|`|fgonb5OQaa	Three possible interpretations:<br>  <br>  1.<br>  On my bottle it says "treats 470 US gal"  237mL/470 = .5 ml /gal<br>  <br>  2.<br>  if you use 5ml for the chlorine, another 5ml is needed for chloramine, etc.<br>  <br>  add them together:<br>  5+10+10 = 25/10us gal = 2.5 ml per gallon<br>  <br>  3.<br>  no addition method:<br>  1 ml/1 gallon (max of them is the scales and fins)<br>  <br>  conclusion:  <br>  I assume the "treats" refers to the bare minimum, 5ml/10gal.<br>  <br>  I would use the 2.5 ml per gallon one, it's the safest and makes the most sense to me.|`|ytotpqMPaa	You do either #1 or #2 by what they use to treat your water. If you don't know, go with #2 until you find out.  A little bit extra won't hurt your fish. You do that whenever you add new water or change the water.  <br>  <br>  If you already have some in the tank from #1 or # 2 and change your water when your supposed to you shouldn't have to do #3.|`|hQQuqyYcaa	I would recommend doing the 5ml per 5gal....the 10ml per 10gal is the same as the 5ml per 5gal, too.
Oiabe82gaa	Do you have a partner, does he or she have an understanding of horses?<br>  You need someone you trust or feel comfortable with to help you past that initial next few times you sit on a horse!<br>  I would even consider going to a riding school and ask for a lead line lesson. This sounds funny, but all you need is time on a horse to start getting your confidence back.<br>  The fact that you bottled it today is expected, you are going to have good days and bad days on this "road to recovery" to being able to just jump on board and ride away.<br>  Time, time, time!!!<br>  Good luck!|`|TNTFomKeaa	It's completely normal to lose your nerve after a bad accident like you had, so try not to be frustrated with yourself. Go easy on yourself!<br>  Try and take the pressure off yourself as much as possible. Just spend some time going to the barn and having fun with her. Groom her, lunge/free lunge her, whatever you feel comfortable with. Work on getting a good bond with her.<br>  When you feel like riding again, put yourself in the safest situation possible. Wear a helmet and a back protector so you know that if you do fall you will be safe. Ride in an enclosed arena. Have an encouraging friend there to reassure you. Then make it easy for yourself. Take baby steps. If you just feel like getting on and walking around the ring a few times, then that's what you should do. Build it up slowly and always quit on a good note.<br>  There are techniques such as NLP (neuro-linguistic programming) which are supposed to be very useful for nervous riders. I understand that it involves visualizing your ride beforehand, thinking of it going really well and you enjoying yourself and feeling safe and confident. You could google it to find practitioners in your area if you think it might be useful to you.<br>  You might find it beneficial to have some lessons with an instructor you get on with.<br>  Good luck!|`|RloOJ43haa	I think you probably need more than YA can give you. You might be better off working with a therapist that can help you with your fear.|`|RUxRNsf4aa	Im sorry to hear about your coma. Well I have never been in a situation like this so I don't know what will work best for you, but I had the "freezing up" fear with jumping, and what I did that helped solve this is to watch lots of videos (successful with no falls of course) of people jumping their horses with ease. You may want to do this but with videos of people at the w/t/c. Pay attention in the videos at how relaxed and easy it is. Make sure its not a video where someone has an accident though!|`|6a221e63714f9d33724ccb40cd162c0aaa	It can be really hard to bounce back after such a serious accident, but your confidence may increase if you spend more time with the mare. Groom her like a princess, take her out for hand walks and hand graze her, and maybe do games with her on the ground or longing. Once you know her really well, it'll be easier to mount up. As the people said above, a good confidence booster is to ride with someone else (either on a very calm, sane horse or on the ground) or find a good trainer to give you lessons (instructors are good at helping you with confidence.) Even if all you do is walk with the mare, you guys are still building a bond, and that's a success in itself.|`|XJ9oSR2daa	Its hard no doubt and ignore the ppl that say you just have to get on to get over it.  <br>  <br>  Its true to some extent, but you choose your mount wisely.  I took lessons after a 8yr stint of giving up riding when I was in a bad wreck.  I had to do this to get my confidence back.  <br>  <br>  Then I was pummeled by my show mule in 2003 and the trainer I had after that, realized the panic attacks that were happening, *I had no clue what the heck those things were* and we worked through them slowly.  We did alotttt of yoga on horseback that got my mind off what the potential my mule had in my mind of hurting me.<br>  <br>  It isn't an overnight thing and its something you have to realize you have.  Once you realize your fear, then you do things to curve it.  The mule, if the panic would creep in, i would work him to the point that I knew he was focusing on me.  It gave me security in knowing that.  You have to realize what it is causing your fear, bolting, bucking, whatever and then come up with a plan to help prevent it.<br>  <br>  I have also realized that the older I get, the more mortality sets in and you realize you are breakable lol.|`|xzJi0bcSaa	I would do a lot of ground work (this helps her get exercise and lets you control her from the ground)  with her and just groom her. This will help you and her bond and that will lead you to trust her more. It will also help you get to know her more. Then, when you are ready, start riding in a controlled area, like an arena or paddock. Start out slow and do what you feel comfortable with. If this doesnt help, maybe get professional help. I like to do groundwork and groom horses I dont know real well when I start training. :) Hope this helps!|`|YCvgjLdnaa	start riding her the way you do when you first learn completely non complicated and something you know you can do, then gradually build up confidence over time and ride her more professionally or like you did before. its better to take longer then hurting yourself and building up a fear and not being able to ride.<br>  sort of like when you first learn to ride horses, start from the beginning or where you feel at a comfortable stage, then when you can do that, move up a little bit and you'll completely get over your fear.<br>  take it slow and build it up. don't do anything you feel you cant, in time you''ll be able to, good luck..
KILFoc6kaa	Call around to animal rescues  and pet stores to see if someone would be willing to take them as a surrender, and they will find a home that they will be cared for.  And for goodness sakes if you think one is dead you actually need to find out for sure.|`|RA3p25Qoaa	I would suggest rehoming them ideally to someone who has other hermit crabs and has experience caring for them. <br>  <br>  Hermit crabs shouldn't smell unless they are dead or there is something dirty in their cage. <br>  <br>  I would try the Crab street journal. Or a local online classified like Kijiji.  I've adopted a few hermit crabs I've found though online classifieds myself so if you want to rehome them quickly that may be your best bet. Just be sure to ask for experience and maybe photos of their enclosure. Things to ask would be: How many moults have you had, how old are your hermit crabs, do you give them salt and fresh water, what foods do you feed them etc. <br>  <br>  If your pet shop has a notice board post an ad for shoppers to see.|`|PqT6pQAoaa	Give them to a pet store, they will most likely take them for you. Or maybe you have a friend who wants a pet lol|`|D20ue82Iaa	Call a pet store and ask if they will take them.  Also, if there is an Earthbound Trading Co.  around you, I know they sell hermit crabs and might take them.  Not really sure tho.  <br>  <br>  As far as the one you think is dead, try scooping a little water from their bowl or whatever into the shell it's inside of.  this will usually make them come out of the shell if they are still alive.  Otherwise, it's dead I can almost guarantee you.|`|OAzJPUkHaa	It is better to give them up if you know you can't/will not give proper care.  <br>  Do find the crab that's passed and properly dispose of it.  Dead animals carry loads of harmful bacteria and diseases, which could potentially harm your still living boys and make it difficult for the person/store that will get them.  <br>  You could try giving them to a pet shop, but realize they probably won't give much better care than you have.  I'd suggest you try putting setting them up for adoption on either the Hermit Crab Association or Crabstreetjournal adoption board.  It'll be easier to give them a better home.<br>  <a href="http://hermitcrabassociation.com/phpBB/viewforum.php?f=13&sid=8dc373d803a244824c2ebf56f82a7366" rel="nofollow">http://hermitcrabassociation.com/phpBB/v...</a><br>  <a href="http://crabstreetjournaladoptions.com/" rel="nofollow">http://crabstreetjournaladoptions.com/</a><br>  You could also try Craigslist or other websites of that nature.  <br>  <br>  I WOULD NOT recommend a mall pet shop like Earthbound as don't take care of their hermies and will give your crabs worse care than you did(considering all the children poking, prodding, and stressing them out).|`|YVS53aksaa	i know exactly how you feel. when a hermit crab dies, it will either come out of its shell and bury itself in the sand/dirt, or will simply die inside its shell. another way to check is to pick up the shell and turn it upside down. with bottled/filtered water, pour some water into the opening of the shell, where the crab would normally come out of. if it reacts in any way, it is alive. if not, it may be dead. if it does not react, hold the crab by the back of the shell and shake it over a trash can. if the crab is alive it will not fall out, they will hold on very tight. if it is dead, it will simply fall out of the shell. (this part always freaked me out) but then atleast you know if it is dead or not. Yes, most pet stores will accept your crabs. just say that you cannot care for them anymore, and for no charge, they will put them up for adoption. I was able to return my hermit crabs to petco.|`|6BpEjI6Taa	I had a salt water aquarium that became too pricey to keep maintaining.  I donated the fish back to the shop I bought them from.  Maybe call a local pet shop and see if they will take them.
hetZz4c1aa	Keep your cats safely inside and your problem will be solved. Indoor cats are healthier, happier, live longer lives and are better companions. And, you won't have so many worries.<br>  <br>  good luck!|`|VMY7No0eaa	SOUNDS LIKE A PARTYING TEEN TO ME!|`|a094e88abfa530c89b6055e83ffcca55aa	just like when you were young, you and your friends did not want to hang out with the older folks. There really isn't much you can do if the younger one brings them home all you can do for the older one is spend time outside with her so she doesn't feel locked up. You could squirt the other cats with a water gun (not a super soaker just a plain little water gun) till they don't feel so welcome coming into your yard.|`|nQdGGBN4aa	As Spike and Co said - keep the cats inside. It is safer for them and you won't have any more problems with cats dropping in for diner.<br>  <br>  One other thing - I'm curious, do you know about capitalizing the first letters of the first words in sentences and the first letters of proper nouns and pronouns?<br>  <br>  How about punctuation?<br>  <br>  Both of those make matter much, much easier to read!|`|EqTh6LRPaa	You should keep your cats indoors only and this will not happen anymore. Cats are better off inside.|`|e8f83ccff6f82416a29a6f64db62373eaa	I had this same problem. All my cats are neutered and my parents decited they were going to be outside cats (against my wishes). Two of them would bring home "friends", and one of them even brought preg. females home to live. I kept telling him I knew they were not his kittens, but he would look after the mothers and kittens at our house till we found them homes. I guess it's nice that your cats are making friends, but it can be a bit annoying, having other cats eating your cats food can get costly, and if the other cats are not spayed or neutered you have the problem of kittens and the male cats marking your house. The only way to solve this problem though is to keep your cats inside.
97cea69af418b36fa64d887915f51776aa	See your fish exploded because it obviously had a disease called Dropsy, and you thought your fish was just getting fat. This is a serious disease and the worst that can happen is make a fish stomach explode just like your fish did. If there are any fish alive in the tank, be aware that they also have been infected due to the explosion which causes the parasites to free themselves and attack other fish. If there are some fish left i would strongly suggest that you run the the store and buy them a dropsy medicine; if there's no fish, the best thing to do is to start from scratch and clean the whole tank but without soap. Rinse it several times and replace filter pad and let the tank cycle again before adding new fish. Many people do not believe this and just add more fish and then wonder why there fish keep dieing, but others that have listened to my advice really appreciated it. <br>  <br>  Causes of Dropsy: <br>  Dropsy is fairly easy to diagnose non-specifically, however, it is much harder to diagnose the cause. The main cause is bacterial infection. The causative agent may be introduced through food or dirty water. Edema second to kidney failure or ascites due to liver or heart failure are other possible causes.<br>  <br>  The following site provides the exact causes of dropsy as i mentioned above and also has lots of info about the disease.|`|D20ue82Iaa	What kind of fish are they?  I know a lot of fish, like Betas, will kill each other if put in the same tank without a divider or something like that.

I suggest you clean the tank and scrub all the rocks/plants inside to get rid of any germs. it is also a good idea to do this after a fish dies, because whatever it died of could get other fish infected. also try not to overfeed them.|`|6f1MNa01aa	parasite?<br>  spry about you fish|`|PqT6pQAoaa	sorry about your fish<br>  maybe another bigger fish attempted to eat it?|`|27bc701367843ae2833d9bcda8c0f992aa	Possibly Droosy or swim bladder issue.  The fish could have popped because this will make the fish swollen, the Swim bladder basically pops.

However, if I were guessing, I would put colic first and injuries, etc. second based on my 57 years with horses.<br>  <br>  Prevention involves providing a safe living environment, and properly training and conditioning, otherwise managing, and outfitting our horses for the activities they are involved in, and administering correct medical treatment for injuries.|`|f3bb70dee35ef28e84fcc054691669dbaa	My guess,  founder would be #2<br>  <br>  Don't let the horse get fat, to many carbohydrates and starches at one time or the grasses that are too rich.<br>  Also proper shoeing and feet trimming.<br>  <br>  #3 would be toxins<br>  <br>  Botulism, Ionophore toxicity and Yew toxicity are common<br>  All these can be prevent with basic food control.<br>  Don't let horses eat grass clipping, molded hay and ornamental shrubs.<br>  <br>  If you don't count old age, then colic would be number one.<br>  <br>  Galloppal gave an interesting link, but the stats includes horses that were euthanized and we have a habit to euthanize horse because of injuries this MAY include; can't breed, bow tendons, limp with rider, ETC..<br>   <br>  This is the PDF file of the link.<br>  <a href="http://www.aphis.usda.gov/vs/ceah/ncahs/nahms/equine/equine05/equine05_infosheet_mortality.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.aphis.usda.gov/vs/ceah/ncahs/...</a>|`|EqTh6LRPaa	I dont know if there is a stat for this.

Keep feeding her to get the fat back in her.|`|dXn8JaZjaa	good for you for taking it to the vet!<br>  <br>  there could be any number of things that could make a lizard skinny, but the only thing that will cause it is if it isn't eating.|`|BhXwQ2n1aa	vet is the only one that can help right now. something as little as that infection when she's getting thin can kill her. <br>  <br>  please take care of your reptiles better..they're helpless in captivity|`|3IUMh4Igaa	I am glad to hear that you are taking her to the vet.

She needs to have a stole panel ran on her.|`|zTeLhroWaa	Going a week without feeding your gecko couldn't have depleted her fat stores as dramatically as you described.  So either a) you're lying about the amount of time it's been since you fed her or b) she's been steadily getting thinner due to illness and you only just caught on.<br>  <br>  Thank you for taking her to a vet.  That's pretty much the only thing that can help her at this point.<br>  <br>  And for goodness sake, don't forget to feed your pet!  I'll say the same thing to you as I say to my younger sister:  If you were locked in a room and dependent upon your parents to give you food and clean water, clean away your "mess," and keep you warm, you would not be very happy with them if they suddenly stopped doing all those things.  A pet is a responsibility that you can't take lightly.  It's a little life.  And it's in your hands.  Remember that.

You could put a diaper on him at night:  these are sold in pet stores and would absorb his leakage.  Failing that, keep his rear feathers trimmed short.  A good groomer can often do this so you wouldn't notice the dog has been trimmed.

The best thing I have found for removing urine scent is liquid dish soap; Dermassage brand is not as harsh on the skin if you rinse it out completely. You should use a good dog coat conditioner too afterwards.  Definitely continue regular bathing; you do not want to get urine scald or skin breakdown because of the urine on the skin and coat.  <br>  <br>  Another option would be to use a female dog panty with a maxi pad in it for extra absorption at night.  It might catch more of the leakage.  You could also work on teaching him to sleep on his side.|`|SxHu7BJCaa	maybe you should talk to a vet
iasOicRjaa	Yes dog's mouths are dirtier.|`|FnrAw2SQaa	Many people may have heard a myth that dogsdogsdogs' mouths are cleaner than the mouths of human beings. This rumor is likely to stem from the fact that dogsdogsdogs are often seen licking their wounds, which rarely get infected.<br>  <br>  However, people who believe that dogsdogsdogs' mouths are cleaner than humanshumanshumans' mouths are greatly mistaken, according to veterinarians who have spoken on the subject. Most humanshumanshumans have a strong belief in good hygiene, and brush their teeth at least once or twice every day. Human mouths rarely come into contact with external bacteria. DogsDogsDogs' mouths, in contrast, are rarely cleaned in most cases. DogsDogsDogs also have a tendency to sniff around and eat bacteria-filled waste — including rancid food and feces — whenever they are given the opportunity to do so. Contrary to popular belief, dogsdogsdogs' mouths are far dirtierdirtierdirtier than the mouths of the typical human being.<br>  <br>  The reason that dogsdogsdogs' mouths rarely infect the wounds that they lick is that their licking has the effect of clearing away the dead tissue, similar to the work a surgeon would do to clean out a wound. Even though dogsdogsdogs' mouths are full of bacteria, dog bites do not usually cause infections in humanshumanshumans because most bacteria in dogsdogsdogs is particular to their species. Therefore, even if the dog is infected with a disease, the human is unlikely to catch it. For this reason, it is not especially dangerous to share food with a dog or to kiss dogsdogsdogs' mouths, though neither option is exactly the most hygienic of decisions.<br>  <br>  If you are a dog owner, and would like to make your dogsdogsdogs' mouths cleaner, there are special toothbrushes and toothpaste that you can buy to use on your dog, which will help to get rid of some of the bacteria in your dogsdogsdogs' mouths. Though it may be difficult to get your dogsdogsdogs to open their mouths initially, they will calm down once they understand what you are doing. Some of the special toothpastes for dogsdogsdogs' mouths come in flavors like beef or chicken — buy one of these, and your dog will soon look forward to his daily teeth cleaning.|`|0NUj2CNXaa	Heyy im a vet, <br>  scientists have actually proven that the mouth of a dog is cleaner then the mouth of a human.

It can be a poster of your favorite player, of the stadium, (a pic of your stadium would look really cool with the cityscape decor) whatever, you could order a specific size online with a pic you come across on the web, or you can buy a poster from a sporting store & cut it down to size.  If you want, you can get it laminted at Office Depot or some place like that (youre in NYC, you'll find a place), to prevent it from warping if it gets wet. This way you still get the sports theme you want.|`|XAsR6uPvaa	You might be able to order such things online or you could go to a fish store that might have it >_><br>  <br>  Big stores such as Petco or Petsmart rarely have any of these things.

f9fb186e1c82bf7349b1e14dcbb1bcc4aa	The dog certainly sounds like it spends a lot of time in the crate. I wouldn't attack her for being neglectful.. I would approach her on how she can start walking the dog more, maybe signing up for some training classes.. Perhaps if she could train the dog, and tire the dog, it would be able to be out of the crate more often without causing so much chaos.. Maybe she doesn't know this?!|`|QVP8zSuWaa	I would have a talk with her. The dog isn't getting near enough exercise. <br>  Maybe you could suggest the 2 of you could go for long walks several times a day and take the dog with you. Some dogs love their crates but she should leave the door open when she is there so that Lola could come and go.|`|C1eHfhrHaa	It is not neglectful according to the law, as long as the crate is large enough. Her dog would not be as hyper if it got regular long walks each day.|`|6t5kQnSFaa	Yes!<br>  <br>  Sometimes it's hard to stand up to friends - you could try making an anonymous call to animal control. <br>  <br>  But you should really save that poor dog one way or another|`|0nIwKd5Uaa	I personally think this is way over use of the crate. At school and during the night I could understand, but all day long is just wrong. And then to foster and bring other pets in and then make the dog stay even longer that's cruel in my opinion.<br>  <br>   And of course the dog is hyper. No exercise, little contact, and just sitting there? I'd be ready to tare down the walls myself. So much energy and no way to get rid of it.  It's admirable your friend wants to work with animals, but doesn't sound like she is the right home for Lola. <br>  <br>  For me yes it sounds like it's teetering on neglect. Heck prisoner in prison for more than 3 hours out a day.|`|peB3XgiGaa	She sounds like an animal horder. I'm sure she means well, but keeping an animal caged up all day, even when your at home, is like torture to a dog, because dog's need activity and excerse and to keep them caged up when they want to play or go out for a walk is almost cruel. Maybe she's scared of letting Lola out and then getting bit. Try to suggest letting lola out of her cage more often or talking her for walks or to the park. Dog's will be aggresive to other animals and people if they're never exposed to it, becuase then when they are exposed to a new animal or person, it's scary and intimidating.<br>  Maybe you could talk to animal control. Ask them about your friend. If she has a problem, it should be stopped now before it gets worse.|`|5s4IV7RAaa	Hi. Have you asked your friend why the dog spends so much time in the crate? There could be an easy explanation to it. Also you don't mention if the crate is left open or not. Some owners adopt the use of crates if their animal is prone to chew things. They can also be used to allow the dog some space of its own without feeling threatened. I think you should ask your friend why the dog is in the crate to start with and depending on the answer go from there. It seems the dog is being given exercise and the owner takes foster dogs in which means she would have had to be checked out to prove she is a decent person etc. Try talking to her. I hope this helps you.|`|TNPIR66Caa	I am not a psychologist (only a social worker) BUT...your friend may be showing some signs of animal hoarding...taking in animals she can't care for.  Of course, she doesn't have 30 or anything, but some hoarders start out like this.  It is an obsessive-compulsive disorder that can be treated with medication.<br>  <br>  Technically, Lola is not being neglected.  If she receives enough nutrition, water, bathing and vet care, she is being cared for.  And some dogs really like their crates-if Lola isn't crying or whining, she may find her crate soothing.  However, she may be doing long term damage to Lola by not properly socializing her.  Any dog can get aggressive if they are not properly socialized, and the "bully breeds" have a bad reputation anyway.  She should be letting Lola out of her crate when she is home.  The cats and the dog will work it out, eventually.  <br>  <br>  If she can't socialize Lola, she really should rehome her.  There are plenty of people who have experience with bulldogs and would give Lola a great home, and work with her to make her a great dog.  If she decides that this is what is best for Lola, it is your responsibility as a friend to make sure she doesn't get any more pets! Two cats is probably enough for a college student to take care of.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps!<br>  Steph|`|TNhEBl1aaa	yea thats messed up, i cant stand to see dogs and cats in cages at the store. if have a dog, and you care for it . you would not put it in a cage. why have a dog if shes not going to pay attention to it. or maby give it to a friend that will care for it the way its suppose to be cared for. keeping dogs in a cage is like keeping a person in jail... if your worried about it then maby you should have it. your friend could visit it when ever..|`|bRxWkpfBaa	Dogs, like children, need to have some kind of social life. Even just interacting with the owner. Keeping her in a kennel so long is not good for her. If the problem is that she's not trained, have your roommate train her. If she loves her dog as much as she says she does then she should take good care of her. If she just doesn't fit into your roommates lifestyle then she should get rid of her.

Dogs that don't feel safe may act out in various ways - from acting untrusting towards you, not being very loving, acting nervous especially at loud noises, accidents in the house, etc.|`|5s4IV7RAaa	Yes most definitely. Dogs are very sensitive creatures and will react with our emotions. This can scar dogs for life where they will cower in corners and hide away at the slightest noise. It is very damaging for a dog to hear raised voices, not just mentally but emotionally and physically too.|`|JtYNXoRdaa	More so than most people realize.  Dogs pick up on those energies - they practically travel right down the leash.  Some dogs seem to be more sensitive to it than others.  One of my dogs, for example, could care less if people are yelling.  The other one, my already-anxious rescue, picks up on any kind of tension immediately and will start whining and pacing and shaking.|`|AA11840819	yes.  It can make them aggressive or very timid. The person they are closest two will sometimes be protected by the dog which then means the other person hits or hurts the dog.  Dogs are a lot like small children in that they get scared when there is conflict.  Sometimes they will squat and pee which is their way of showing submission. Some may hid and make whimpering noises,|`|ZmUGi9PLaa	Absolutely! I was once in a horribly abusive relationship and my dogs went from well behaved happy pets to trembling in the corner and over protective of me. Please figure out something else instead of the fighting no good will come from it.|`|0e6b0ac6e351be3dc6c7600a53dec6c6aa	Yes it can make them insecure and cause aggression problems. It can cause stomach problems as well. <br>  <br>   They feel just as children do.............|`|Yz981zO6aa	Sure it can. Some dogs dislike loud, contentious tones more than others and it can make them aggressive.|`|GUIdP1ENaa	Absolutely,our dog would literally tremble, and hide.Once when I was crying he sat next to me and howled.
97cea69af418b36fa64d887915f51776aa	The previous people pretty much told you the reason, Poor Water Quality; but they are not quiet right when it comes to the water change and the second person obviously copied the first person. You should change 25% instead of 50% because large about of water change can shock the fish and worsen the conditions, therefor small amounts will help the fish gradually adapt to the water. Always add water conditioner to dechlorinate the water (remove bad chemicals such as chlorine which is fatal to fish), the water change should be done every 5 days for at least two weeks since your fish doesn't sound too well and that will help him adapt to the water, and test the water to make sure everything is normal, if you are not sure you can take a sample of your water to a petstore that sells fish and they will usually test it for free.<br>  <br>   After your fish starts acting normal (which might take some time because oscars are know to sulk). <br>  <br>  Make sure you are not feeding him too much because lots of food causes lots of waste and that causes toxic water, always change 25% of water weekly and vvacuumgravel every 2 weeks for maximum health of your oscar. <br>  <br>  If he is a new oscar (meaning you just recently got him) it's ok for them to sulk (act like that) for a few day because they are getting used to their new  home, but if it's not a newly oscar then ddefinitelydo what i told you to do. Take care i wish you and your oscar the best.<br>  <br>  Also please do not feed him any feeder fish, unless you breed the feeders at home, and even if you breed them at home make sure that they are raised the best way one could raise a fish otherwise you are doing nothing but harm your poor oscar.|`|LhQ8TYoHaa	um. he is probably just scared if he is new... it might be in danger... though they are very melodramatic. i would change ur water and test if for ammonia and nitrite...|`|jnzSz3tRaa	poor water quality|`|86b135e0c5c7fa8152fab546e88b509caa	Poor water quality.<br>  <br>  Test your water chemistry. Perfect conditions are 0 ammonia, 0 nitrite and under 20ppm nitrate, anything deviating from that will cause lethergy and sicknes in fish.<br>  <br>  Do a 50% partial water change with dechlorinated water now and ensure the filter is working correctly.|`|9kceDOTraa	Could be a few different things.  Usually Mickey gives really good experienced answers so I don't want to go against that.  You certainly do no harm keeping good water quality, but you can have many different pathogens strike and have great water.  So diet comes into play here.  I'm curious to know what you're feeding it before just going to water quality only.  As well, your tank size and if there are any other tank mates can factor into this.  Have the best water for the fish, but keep that Oscar say at 10 inches in a 20 gallon tank, since high filtration can keep the water just fine, you will still have health issues.<br>  <br>  Oscars are known for doing things like you listed, sometimes it can be from being sick, sometimes just being "bored" with it's enviroment as well.  It's hard to make that assessment without having any visual information to process too.  Sure run your checks on your water, and your nitrates can even be as high as 40 ppm and do little to no damage at all to a fish, but you should also list your tank size, tank mates if any, the diet and post some pictures.<br>  <br>  Very rarely does a fish ever die off of starvation actually.  If we consider the natural habitat of these fish, food sources can become scarce many times and nothing around for weeks.  Fish do not use food in the same manner people do, so the lack of appetite, isn't something to be deeply distressed about at this point.  An idea of the tank size and your filtration can give some light on the subject again.
LhQ8TYoHaa	you're only supposed to add "cycle" when your tank is first going through it's fishless cycle... what that did was add harmful bacteria to your tank, plus you took out water which reduces your nitrate levels... and that's probably what's stressing them out... do another water change without putting the cycle stuff in.|`|jnzSz3tRaa	u only cycle when you first get your tank!|`|DCITHZyLaa	ur goldfish might be dying because seriously 35 litres? that's way to small one goldfish needs atleast 29 gallons.

vbEkYH2haa	Your hen is exhausted and sick. the poop will render the eggs nonviable so there is no point letting her continue the clutch.<br>  <br>  A budgie is not meant to have more than 2 clutches in a yeah, so i can imagine the extreme toll that six has take on her body. <br>  <br>  Remove the nest box, remove the partner and let the poor hen rest for 12 months. She may lay and egg or two off the perch, don't worry about them. <br>  <br>  Please rest your hen and give her plenty of calcium and nutrient rich foods.|`|6KxBqnstaa	You need give this bird calcium right away. Give cuttle bones, crushed oyster shell and calcium rich foods. laying eggs especially this many depleates the calcium and can lead to health problems and even death. The poop will not hurt the eggs. make sure you do not take out the eggs until she tires of them and stops laying on them or she will keep laying just to replace ones taken and get sick or suffer a prolapse or become egg bound possibly. Also if want to slow down the laying process which I would suggest at this point I would decrease the amount of daylight hours in other words cover cage earlier at night. Hopefully a few eggs will hatch. Good luck.|`|GBwBwH5iaa	You should make sure the budgie has a cuttle  bone because she needs calcium to lay healthy eggs. The poop probably would not affect the eggs. Just make sure you dont move the eggs around.

They are EXTREMELY LOYAL to their owners, and when PORPERLY socialized and trained can be wonderful dogs to strangers alswell. I'm bring my 13 week old rottie pup to obedience training (not because he is bad) because is it a WONDERFUL place to socialize him to other people and dogs! Rottweilers are extremely smart! LOVE to work, and LOVE training and doing ANYTHING for their owners. They do have high energy when puppies, but when older are very calm and can live in an apartment if it has regular, daily exercise. You can teach them to do ANYTHING! Herdng, pulling, protecting/guarding, OR just being a regular wonderful companion. They are also naturally very good with children, I highly recomend a rottweiler for a family with children. I have a 4 month old baby myself with a rottie pup! He is very gentle when around her. They are great with other dogs (when socialized) big or small. If you are getting a pup... you will have no problem with a rottie pup and a pom. If your Pom is good with other dogs, I think they will get along very well. My rottie likes to play with my moms Toy Poodle!|`|S6ie5HwBaa	What breed suits you?<br>  <br>  German shepherd require 5km daily walks & loads of mental stimulation?

(Dou you know what I mean?)On the flier state what animals you will take care of and if you need a key to the person's house or if the animal can stay at your house.

If it's just the basic cats and dogs or whatever. Then if you want to start a pet sitting business, that would be best because people go on vacation. A good fee is $10-$20 a day including bathing, feeding, walking, cleaning up after, and playing with the pets. Although this price may seem high, it is lower than most kennels would pay overnight and you would give the pets a lot more and better attention. Ads such as flyers, emails, and word of mouth can really send your business soaring. Also make sure that you come across to potential clients as responsible and good with animals.<br>  <br>  I pet sit, and along with my sister we charge $20.00 a day, split that's $10 each and the animals are really cute and it's fairly easy.
cY4vg9VAaa	Don't listen to the idiot who said shoot it. No known ear infection in a dog  can cause a woman to become sterile, brucellosis can, but it's seen in livestock, not dogs.<br>  <br>  Yes, he might have an yeast infection or some type of infection. The vet should have give you antibiotics, take him back. This needs to be treated to prevent damage to his auditory system. Dogs with pendolous(hanging) ears are prone to infections and mites because the ears can trap in moisture and provide a breeding haven for bacteria or mites.

Have some patience, and try these methods to help your beagle feel a bit better until the 'script kicks in:<br>  <br>  Mix four ounces (half a cup) each of white vinegar, rubbing alcohol, and water in a very clean squeeze bottle. Let the mixture come to room temperature. <br>  Have a towel handy, kneel on the ground, and place your pup between your knees. Hold up one of his ear-flaps, and gently squeeze in one or two ounces of the mixture. Massage the base of his ear to help distribute the mixture. (Many dogs adore this, some don't care for it much). After a minute or two of massage, let him shake his head to dislodge the liquid - this is where the towel comes in!<br>  Repeat on the other side. Then take a soft, thin cloth or paper towel and gently dry the ears very well. Do this once or twice a day. Even without the mixture, a gentle massage may help the itch, so pamper your pup.<br>  <br>  Beagles and other long-earred doggies are very susceptible to yeast infections, so even after this one clears up, you've got to pay attention to those lovely ears. Keep them very clean and dry, and occasionally use the treatment above. Cut all grains and sugar from the diet, and feed a tablespoon or so of plain whole-milk yoghurt  every day (look at the label for "active cultures).
2F8MGbbqaa	Awww congrats !!! Post some pics up? :D<br>  <br>  You can handle them a little bit today, like just pick them up for a while and cuddle them, but be sure to keep them warm and calm. If they start wheeking it means they want to go back to their mum and are scared. You shouldn't really pick them up that much today, and only do it if the mum is okay with this.

jV7SmnaTaa	I work at a vet clinic.  Our clinic bought a PediPaws in part for us to try and so that we can loan it to clients before they buy their own.  Basically, they're OK.  For a large dog they're junk, but for a small dog (chihuahua) they are OK.  If the nails are long you may have to clip them first to get enough off.

IMPvzBk1aa	Horses can suffer from sleep deprivation and this can be a symptom.  Horses need to lie flat on the ground in order to get deep, REM sleep. So he cannot be in REM sleep in this position.  It sounds like your horse doesn't feel he has enough room in his stall to safely lie down, or something else may be preventing it.  My guess is that if you provide a larger stall, or a place outside with a pasturemate to "guard" while he sleeps, he will begin getting the sleep he needs and the problem may be solved.  I'll find some information and come back to post it.<br>  <br>  Here is a good article....be sure you go to all 4 pages...........<br>  <br>  <a href="http://equisearch.com/horses_care/health/behavior/horse_sleep_deprived_092308/" rel="nofollow">http://equisearch.com/horses_care/health...</a>|`|YtBzRAxMaa	Sounds like your horse is in REM - real deep sleep and for some reason is not able to lie down.<br>   I'd have his back checked out asap - then his hocks checked out - there may be an issue there - his knees seem to be working fine.<br>   One of my mares only went down to her knees when it looked like she was going to roll or sleep (she NEVER had shavings on her in the morning and NEVER rolled) - her top line was horrid -she did not have the muscle to collect herself and her prev. owners just let her plod along all heavy on the forehand. Once I developed her topline she started rolling, collecting and is now covered in shavings.<br>   Check his top line<br>   Good luck!!|`|a0309e3a32a74064ccda5c6a7c7178a0aa	My sister's horse does this and has been diagnosed with narcolepsy.  He only does it in the stall or cross ties.  He doesn't have bald knees, though.<br>  If he isn't doing it while riding him, I would just deal with the stumbling by injecting his knees every six (or 4 months) with a hyluronic acid/steroid mixture, and maybe giving him a joint supplement.  Also, bed him deeper in his stall.
JmD0oq2Naa	she probably didnt like having another mouse in her territory, she may have been better with another female, but ive heard female mice can be very territorial|`|a063525afac8cd769f0358cd6b18ff02aa	Thats just a stupid idea. Either she was defending her territory or they were fighting over who was to be dominant. Trust me one of my hamsters killed the other for that very same reason.|`|Rfj2ULibaa	Mice are not racist - she was responding to the fact that there was another mouse in her territory.
ZYzhBhgJaa	In addition to what alexander said, you might also want to try rearranging the decor, this will make it harder for the angelfish to be territorial. Introducing new decor might help also. Just a plant or two.|`|yyJo3ybBaa	Angels are best introduced in pairs, they are very territorial and the bigger they are, the meaner they are.|`|azvV1tnuaa	Perhaps you could remove it from the tank for roughly an hour before placing it back in the water. Aggression problems should then be solved.
cGRyDCpQaa	If your parents can't afford one then you'll probably have to wait until you grow up and can support yourself.<br>  <br>  If you talk to your parents about it, maybe you could get to an agreement... if you're willing to work. I don't know what average pay is, but it might be possible. You could get a job or you could work in the stables in exchange for board money. Just remember you'll still need to buy tack, apparel, supplies, brushes, etc. You'll also need money for farrier, shots, worming, teeth, medication, supplements, emergency vet bills, etc.<br>  <br>  Leasing might be the best option for you to begin with. If you're willing to work and your parents agree to it, then this should be a good option. You'll be able to see if you're capable of making enough money and if you enjoy 'owning' a horse before actually taking the big step of buying one. Then if you decide you can't do it or can't afford it anymore, you just quit leasing.|`|VyXYcCXtaa	yeah when you move out of your parents house...there is always your birthday christmas ect|`|PWankIUpaa	Hi Emma <br>  <br>      I would say that there is . Try going to  a barn and working to own a horse instead of Wages or work out a payment plan with the owners.  Often times they will know people who like myself because of Health will let their horses go to good homes for a minimal payment as I did with my last Mare! She was a really nice Morgan Mare Sorrel about three and I had schooled her myself from birth . I really miss that mare but the guy who purchased her has taken really good care of her until she died of old age. <br>  <br>  Horse people are among the kindest in the world and they like helping others as I did and as those many who helped me get started.<br>  <br>  Find a bunch of Nice people and barn to work with and of course get your parents permission and have them meet the people before getting started with them. <br>  <br>  Good luck|`|AA11570905	Yes!  Absolutely.  I've been horse crazy since I knew what a horse was.  My mom says since I was less than 2 years old.  My parents could never afford one for me.  They didn't know anything about horses and didn't quite know what to do with me.  I had a horsey friend who let me ride her horses and I was allowed to rent horses on occasion.  We lived in Southern California at the time and it was just too expensive to have a horse, whether to board it or have enough property to keep it at home.  Then, miracle of miracles when I was 32 years old my husband's job transferred him to Georgia where land is CHEAP!!! By California standards anyhow.  I bought my first horse within the year and now 17 years later I have 3 horses and a donkey, 5 dogs, a cat and a pig.  Dreams DO come true. Don't give up because if you can dream it, you can have it.|`|yjsIhHeuaa	Do you have acreage?<br>  Could you support feeding cleaning stall's ect?<br>  Would you be able to provide for the horse even after you move out?<br>  and do you have nessecary funds to buy the horse?<br>  <br>  these are all questions you need to answer to make this question work.<br>  <br>  if you indeed have acreage, and get a job, and dont mind cleaning, then yes there is a chance.|`|1itC64nVaa	If you can find a horse for a good deal, then yea definitely. I would try to prove to them that I deserve a horse, and can take care of it!|`|81XWmx9Uaa	Sweetie,<br>  I really really really think you should keep taking horseback riding lessons, and ask them if they can also teach you about care, and feeding of a horse. Another option is, if you live in an area where there is one, join pony club. I know a lot of people that think that owning and caring for a horse is almost easy, well it's really not that easy, honey. Horses are a huge responsibility, and if you don't understand them, you and/or the horse could get SERIOUSLY injured. With horses you have to take every precaution, and always be aware of your body lanuage, and the horse's body language.<br>       Also you have to consider, that you need to buy safe and sturdy equipment (grooming supplies, saddles, bridles, food, supplements, farrier work). If you dont know your stuff about equipment, then you could be tricked into buying cheap items that could injure you and your horse.<br>     All I really want you to know is that horses are a HUGE responsibility, and take a lot of knowledge. If you take lessons, and actually spend time and work with horses, you will eventually become ready for the responsibility of owning a horse!<br>  Good luck!!!! :D<br>  P.S. I think 7 years of riding should do the trick for riding skills, now work on your other skills like illness and injury treatment, and care of the horse!|`|x787hJbBaa	Perhaps. I have the same problem you do. I am only 13 and I am trying to make $300 by June this year so that I can full lease the horse I half lease/take lessons on. I love him so much, he is the only horse I would ever want, and my dad said if I can make the other $100 a month for the rest of the board I can full lease him for the entire year. Don't give up. I was lucky enough to be born into a family where my relatives have horses that I ride and lucky enough to have parents that are willing to pay for me to ride regularly. If you love it, something will happen. I want to be an equine vet I love horses so much. Spending time with them for my entire life is something I want to do, and if you are lucky enough something will come along for you.|`|Djw56Be2aa	Listen. My Mum and dad are on high pay.

Or do you have riding lesson's?  If so why not check out and see if anyone has a horse for share or part loan a few days a week? You'd be able to do this for free to around ￡30 per week, thats what price range's i've seen. I know it's not the same as owning your own horse but for those three/four days you do this it'll sure feel like you do! Are you a competant rider? If so I do know of a 6yr old gelding for part loan, he's 14.1hh & in Lancashire, it just depends what are your in why not check out these websites - <br>  <br>  www.newrider.com<br>  www.horsemart.com<br>  www.horsequest.com<br>  www.horsestoloan.com<br>  www.horseshares.com<br>  www.stabletalk.com<br>  <br>  I'm currently looking on these for a horse myself, but maybe you could try this before commiting your time & money towards a horse of your own.

Find a barn close to you and get a lease! Its much cheaper. If your parents say no, i would suggest getting a job and paying for it yourself. Thats what I do! Im 17.|`|ZAMhyAQ9aa	There is definitely a chance.  I am 18, and I have been horse crazy since I can remember.  My parents make above average pay, and they got me lessons for four years (when i was 8 - 12), but then they stopped.  I started working in exchange for a lease on a QH gelding, and I volunteered at Lift Me Up therapeutic riding, where I became good friends with the barn manager, and I started riding her 3yr old OTTB.  Eventually, when I was 17 I was given the OTTB, and I worked to support her.  It was/is hard, as I don't have a steady job, and my parents never gave me a cent towards her, but I have found private barns where I can work off part of board. So, it is possible, but if you do it will be hard work.|`|FDMLiDLRaa	having parents that are okay with horses is always a start lol. have you asked for a horse before, and what has their answer been? i really want a horse too, but it is not just the cost of the horse; there is the equiptment, tack, cleaning products, feed, land/livery and vet bills etc. is there somewhere near to keep your horse, or will it involve your parents driving you? <br>  if you like to go away/on holiday, if you got a horse, you might not be able to go, as there would be nobody to look after it<br>  so instead of buying your own horse, have you ever cosidered loaning; it cheaper and you still get all the benefits and more you time :) <br>  if your parents say no to you buying a horse, then loaning may be the answer<br>  i hope you get your horse soon, and that this information was a bit helpfull x|`|2bde4413eb2d92e3071651631a2d58e5aa	Hi Emma, boy do I understand your situation!  I wish there was an easy answer.  There are a lot of horses that need rescuing, but you have to be very careful there; some rescue horses have been abused, and are either hard to handle or dangerous.  In a difficult economic time like this, lots of people are willing to sell "pasture pet" horses for far less than they might otherwise cost... but again, these horses could be unintentionally dangerous because they haven't been handled in a long time.<br>  <br>  My best suggestion is to find a barn/farm/stable nearby, someplace you can get to on your bike until you can get a learner's permit to drive.  Ask if they will let you help with barn chores so you can learn more about handling horses.  See if they have a horse or pony hanging around the place that doesn't get a lot of attention--maybe they breed show horses and have a few that didn't turn out as hoped for?  Or maybe there's just a horse that needs a human.  :)  If you were to start regularly doing things with that horse, it might be possible at some point to buy him or her...<br>  <br>  Another thought: the more you hang out with and make yourself helpful to horse people, the more you'll be able to ask their assistance.  If you hear of a rescue horse, or your local animal shelter ends up with one, you could take your experienced new farm friends with you to help you decide if the horse is right for you.  Or you could ask to assist at an equine vet's office (you might even find you have a knack for vet stuff, and get a job/vocation out of your hobby!) and vets will always be able to give you great advice on a horse to buy or adopt.<br>  <br>  But please keep in mind that safety is very important around horses.  Nothing is more heartbreaking than falling in love with a horse that then turns out to be too powerful for you to handle, or that ends up with medical issues that cost too much for you to deal with.  So guard your heart, kiddo, and pick carefully.  Keep your eyes and ears open, go places where you can learn as much as possible about horses, satisfy your love of them that way--and when the right horse comes along, you will be SO ready.<br>  <br>  Just don't give up on your dream.  It'll happen some day!  Hang in there!|`|u0R455gyaa	Let me tell you, if you want it bad enough...eventually you will find a way.  My parents would not let me have a horse when I was a kid.   However, I had and still have a friend who did have horses.   I rode hers, and wanted my own so badly.   It wasn't the money at all when I was a child.  My parents dreams and their idea of their daughters priorities in life just didn't match my own.    They had no idea just how serious I was.   I never let that dream go.<br>  <br>  You know when I finally got my first horse?   When I was 40 years old!!   My elementary school best friend,  still had horses, and we were still best friends.   I bought my first horse and had her board it for me.  I found myself making that three hour drive nearly every weekend to spend time with my mare.<br>  <br>  Then,  I started missing my mare so badly, that I found a way to move up here to north Florida where my childhood friend lives.  I bought the land right next to hers.  Now we both have 20 acres, and adjoining horse farms.  We raise, train and ride appaloosas, just like we dreamed we would do in elementary school.<br>  <br>  I wish I hadn't of had to wait so long to have my dream fulfilled, but It was fulfilled!   I have eight horses now, and love them all.  The long wait didn't effect my skill in riding.   Like riding a bike, you never forget, it just takes a while to get back to your former skill level.<br>  <br>  I'm a school teacher, and I don't make a lot of money.   My friend makes half of what I do.   If you want something bad enough, and it is your dream, you find a way to make it happen, and you never, ever let that dream go.   I didn't!|`|5kxVNpXmaa	do what i do, i lease my horse. and it works out great, if you get the option too, you only have to pay half of everything for the horse.<br>  i think its a great deal!

That is because they are extremely stressed in their new environment. <br>  <br>  Look at it in this perspective. You have lived in a house for 10 years (this is to scale... with the reptile at a pet store or breeder) and then suddenly you're transported away to a new, unknown location. Would you not be slightly stressed as well?<br>  <br>  Do not bother, or even look at the bearded dragon for a few days. The only day you should look at them is when you are attempting to feed them. If they do not eat, leave them be, and try again until tomorrow.

2fdee6b1fd597a29209ecfad9dc8b598aa	Bananas are high in sugar.  That (along with carbs) can contribute to insulinoma.  Try meat as treats (either raw or blandly cooked), chicken/turkey baby food, olive oil, or egg (raw--once a month, scrambled/hardboiled--one whole egg/week).  If she doesn't take any of those, either, don't feel bad.  Try just giving her a piece of her food out of your hand (ferrets often think of that as a 'treat').<br>  <br>  Fruits and veggies should be given in tiny amounts (we are talking thin slivers), since they are obligate carnivores, and lack a cecum to properly digest any of the nutrients.|`|YpEswTQdaa	I doubt a slice per day is going to hurt!<br>  <br>  I am not a Ferret expert,but most animals can eat banana without ill affects.

8NSh1D4Maa	I am all for Animal Welfare. Not so much 'Animal Rights'. There is a difference. The Animal Rights movement believes animals should not be kept as pets, everyone should be vegans, hunting should be outlawed, animals should not be in zoos, animals should not be exploited or used by humans in any way (no animals on TV, commercials, as service dogs for the disabled, as K9 police, search and rescue, etc). This view extends to any use of animals, including honey bees, milk cows, chickens kept for eggs, etc. Basically they think that all animals should run wild and free with no human interaction. They believe that no distinction should be drawn between animals and humans, and animals should be accorded all rights that humans are. <br>  <br>  The problem with that is domesticated animals do not have the capability to survive without humans. They rely on us for care, food, etc. In addition, humans are not made to be vegans. We're omnivores, and were all animals wild and free and we did not live in modern society, we would still hunt, kill and eat them because of our dietary needs. Vegans supplement their diets heavily with products like amino acids, because it is extremely difficult to have a complete, healthy diet excluding animal proteins. <br>  <br>  I am, however, wholeheartedly in support of Animal Welfare. The concept of animal welfare means that humans have the obligation to provide animals with a comfortable existence, and proper care. That all animals deserve to be well fed, clean, healthy, etc. That animals used for food should live a comfortable existence until slaughter, and that slaughter should be as painless as possible.<br>  <br>  Here is a good, brief article about the differences between the two concepts: <a href="http://www.animalwelfarecouncil.com/html/aw/rights.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.animalwelfarecouncil.com/html...</a>|`|qasOb5Jraa	Hi, im a really big animals lover i have 3 cats, 2 dogs, a tarantula and two bearded dragons to me there like my children no matter how big or small they are.

I don't mean they should be treated as human counterparts, but should not be treated as someones punching bag or kicking post.<br>  We took these animals and made them our pets and our friends and they should be treated so.<br>  <br>  Now cow,pigs, sheep,goats, chickens and so forth were created as food for man and are raised for human consumption, which includes the meat from carcass and also the hide and feathers.<br>  This list also includes wild animals such as deer, rabbits and other types of wild animals.<br>  <br>  But all of the animals as creations of our Lord deserve the right to be used for something if we the Humans take there lives. So Please don't go hunting just for the sport of shooting something, Use what you Kill as a food source.

That will get him to go, then after like a little bit give it to him, then do it over again.|`|TgRLsibGaa	Get her a kong toy they are great for dogs and puppies and very durable.|`|NAGiNKFWaa	Sorry, I have not heard of your dog, is it a dog or a puppy.  I can't tell the age from your post. When my puppies are first little, I practice with the leash. In the house, I drape the leash on them and try to call them to me. Outside, I practice in my fenced back yard for about a month before the puppy graduates to the street. I might drape the leash on the puppy and get him to follow me, or drag the leash on the ground and see if he will follow me and try to catch the leash. There are many things in my back yard that scare a puppy, so it is soooo much easier to address, or correct issues when I am in my back yard and not in the street. We just walk laps in the yard and deal with drama as it comes up. Maybe around 3-months-old I might try to clip the leash to the collar, but if there is too much protesting, I drop the leash. They just get better with the leash around 4 to 5-months-old. So anyway, I use the commands "go" when I want to "go" and if the puppy tugs on the leash, I stop and say "wait". It is my walk and we go as fast as I can walk and no faster. If I want to "wait" and look at a flower, change the batteries in my walkman, count to ten, then I do it, it is my walk. When I am ready I say "go" and we "go" again. When the puppy pulls on the leash, I stop and say "wait" and we stop again, even if we just went two steps. I praise the puppy when he is doing good and talk soothing to him and encourage him when he is doing good, so he keeps doing it. It takes several laps of "go" and "wait" until he settles down, and when the walk is over, I make a big fuss and clap and then they get some play time. They don't like the walk at first, but they like the fuss at the end. I have to address "go" and "wait" again the next day, but it won't take me as long to get him to understand what I want from him. I also housesat a dog, and the owner thought he had leash issues, and that dog just didn't like being in front. He walked just fine with my dogs as long as he could be part of the group, but he didn't want to be in the front. If you have a family member, or a neighbor that has a dog that walks well, see if you can practice with them. I also had one dog that didn't like the maroon leash, or the pink one, but did just fine with the blue leash. Sometimes puppies are just puppies.|`|QVP8zSuWaa	Is she afraid of the leash or the walking?
zTeLhroWaa	A famous Leopard Gecko breeder named Ron Tremper wrote a book called The Herpetoculture of Leopard Geckos.  I strongly recommend buying the book, or at least checking it out from the library.  It has everything you'll need to know about raising healthy geckos and dealing with any issues that may arise.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Herpetoculture-Leopard-Geckos-Philippe-Vosjoli/dp/0974297127" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/Herpetoculture-Leo...</a><br>  <br>  EDIT:<br>  I have to comment on what Brooke said:<br>  Some breeders/hobbyists will tell you to use sand.  Some will tell you not to.  Some will say calcium sand is fine because it can be digested.  The bottom line is this:  loose substrates such as sand, calcium sand, small pebbles, ground walnut shells, etc CAN (not necessarily will) be ingested by the geckos and they CAN cause a fatal blockage in the digestive system.  <br>  <br>  Those that use loose substrates understand the risk and are willing to take it for the sake of "ease of cleanliness" and "beauty."  <br>  <br>  Those that prefer not to use them often use newspaper, paper towels, or tile in the cages as there is absolutely no risk of death with those substrates.  <br>  <br>  Sand users will also tell you that since a Leopard Gecko is a desert animal it lives on sand naturally.  These people have not done their research.  While it's true they live in the middle-eastern deserts, it's far from accurate to assume they live on sand.  <br>  <br>  Leopard Geckos in the wild live on packed clay and rocks.  They have humid caves that they often sleep in and will lie on the warm ground to absorb heat.  <br>  <br>  That being mentioned, please make sure you have all of the heating requirements.  Leopard Geckos absorb heat through their bellies, not their backs, so an overhead light is more of a nuisance than anything.  An under the tank heater should be used (appropriately sized for the tank--the package should tell you how big it needs to be).  If you are going to use an overhead lamp to maintain temperatures (75-78 in the cool side and 85-88 on the hot side of the tank), you should get a nocturnal or infrared heat bulb.  Bright bulbs will hurt the geckos' eyes.  You need no UVA or UVB lighting whatsoever.<br>  <br>  If you have any other questions feel free to contact me via email or instant messenger.  <br>  <br>  Khrysty|`|sUN7TVtzaa	some good sites for you to look at. you really don't need a book for money when you can get free "books" or at least all the knowledge you need online.<br>  <a href="http://leopardgecko.com" rel="nofollow">http://leopardgecko.com</a><br>  <a href="http://leopardgeckopunk.com" rel="nofollow">http://leopardgeckopunk.com</a><br>  <a href="http://drgecko.com" rel="nofollow">http://drgecko.com</a><br>  <a href="http://leopardgeckoect.com" rel="nofollow">http://leopardgeckoect.com</a><br>  <a href="http://thegeckospot.com" rel="nofollow">http://thegeckospot.com</a><br>  and if you want more or not all of these work then my advice is to look up Leopard gecko care sheets on google. some sites have very good Leopard geckos for sale too.<br>   i am glad you are getting her a leopard gecko they are the best reptile ever!!!!!!!|`|thF43SPLaa	Leopard Geckos are a great starter pet in my opinion.  However, they do need some attention.  Impactions are a common problem, so make sure you have carpet as a substrate.  Sand is no good as they will sometimes eat it and become impacted (constipated).  Good luck|`|o80aAQV2aa	AAAAH! There is a lot that goes into a leopard gecko. I have two as well, and first off if you want to hold it and stuff you have to buy it as a baby. They are much cheaper when they are babies too, and they don't have teeth. Mine eat crickets and we coat them in calcium dust. pretty much you keep the crickets in a little plastic cage and catch them in tubes, put the dust in there, and shake it, then put it in the cage. You must make sure they have a little cave or something so they can hide because if they can't then they get stressed. Since you are getting two, hopefully as babies, then you won't know the sex.  <br>  Because of this, you have to put them in seperate tanks. If they are both male they will kill each other. As for bedding, there is special sand that is made of calcium so if they ingest it they won't get sick. With the tank, you should get a heat pad. Put this under the tank. KEEP IT ON AT ALL TIMES! Under their little hide/cave thingy, put a moist napkin or paper towel. They will shed often as babies, but you don't have to worry about taking the skin out. They actually eat it. Do not buy them from a store like PetSmart. Get from a place that sells only reptiles and supplies for them. Ask an employee there also what to do, they will be very helpful. Geckos can live to be 25, so I hope that your and our family enjoy them!
zguucR8yaa	When a cat is in heat, the risks in surgery are higher. One of them is blood loss. The veins are much larger and working harder, making the loss of blood more likely. Sometimes healing is more difficult too. <br>  Some veterinarians will go ahead and spay a cat in heat, but it is more dangerous. The fact your veterinarian wants to wait, is actually a good sign. They don't want to endanger your cat. The vets that would spay while she's in heat are the ones I would wonder about.|`|WqGxGJkbaa	You need a different vet.  A competent one would have spayed your cat at around 5 months old and would absolutely be able to do it whether she was in season or not or even pregnant.  It is totally irresponsible of your vet to suggest waiting as your cat could easily have become pregnant in the meantime, so adding to the ever increasing population of unwanted cats.<br>  <br>  Time to change vet.|`|lDXh0jRVaa	That's ridiculous. You can spay a cat at as young as 6 weeks old though I would recommend waiting until 8 weeks. Anyway, call a different vet and get it done. You also can spay a cat in season for a little bit more money. <br>  <br>  Anyway, thank you SO MUCH for being responsible and keeping your cat un-pregnant and for wanting to get her spayed!!!|`|IRaIxWJKaa	The vets that donate time and their expertise to the humane society can spay a cat in season.  They're taught this in vet school. Just contact a different vet if your doesn't want to do it.  You can also ask about the shot to bring a female cat out of heat.|`|CuGT5X6eaa	go to another vet,they can be spayed while in heat,it costs a little more,but not much,and its better than having an annoying cat in heat...(only annoying cause she is in heat)|`|ZlfPl6B1aa	Get a new vet. You can spay them once their over 5 lbs.<br>  Call the new vet and see when they will do it..<br>  cats go into heat every month..btw|`|9f97f8a980cb5aa7360577720efbdd70aa	Go to another vet..cats ARE old enough to be spayed at 6 months AND can be spayed while in heat although most vets charge extra as there is more blood involved due to the uterus being engorged with blood during heat. You do NOT have to wait a month after the heat..lots of cats go into heat every 2 weeks or less, so by your vets logic you would NEVER be able to spay your cat.  Find a new vet as this one does not seem to know what he/she is talking about.|`|f5a8d99afbb73cd0703df99b87996901aa	Call another vet.  Old school vets are still clinging to the ideas of the past that cats must be 6 months old before being spayed/neutered.  Often that's too late.  Some vets will spay a healthy kitten when it weighs 2 pounds (about 8 weeks).  Cats can be spayed while in heat although it is a tad riskier but any competent vet should be able to do it under normal circumstances.  Any vet should know that as mating season for cats approaches, it will be nearly impossible for her to be out of heat a whole month. This vet is a quack.<br>  <br>  While it is safe to have her spayed while in heat, if you want to wait till she goes out first, when she calms down and stops rubbing against things, howling, and acting distressed all the time, grab her and go. During spring and summer moths her heat cycles will become more or less constant.|`|cj31x3UMaa	1 month after she has been in heat she is likely to be in heat all over again.<br>  <br>  WITH LUCK, your cat's cycle will last approx. one week. Call & make an appointment just as soon as she stops rolling & calling.|`|65e71fbb06f5d33192d9789c626a3e49aa	Many posters have mentioned that it is ok to spay while in heat...much, much more risky which is why most vets will not do the surgery at that time.  However, there is no reason not to spay at 6 months or much younger, so that was poor judgement on the part of your vet.<br>  Cats are not 'constantly' in heat, but they have a brief cycle, so I would go ahead and find another vet, because by the time a month has passed by she will be in heat again.  Call another vet and go ahead and make the appointment about a week from today, and that should be perfect.<br>  Good luck and hang in there, it will be over soon.|`|eL268hETaa	Perhaps you should talk to another vet.  I've never heard of anyone being told to WAIT to get a pet spayed.  The number of times a cat goes into heat without being pregnant directly affects the risk for the cat getting mammary cancer.  MY CAT DIED OF THAT.  She was part Siamese and had several cycles of heat before getting fixed, and was never allowed to get pregnant.<br>  <br>  I don't know what "damage" your vet is talking about, but nothing is worse than watching a beloved cat you've had for 14 years die of cancer. She went through 5 horrendously expensive operations, and I finally had her put to sleep after it spread to her bones and her kidneys failed.  Find yourself a different vet, get rid of the cat's reproductive organs ASAP, stop the howling, and HELP HER LIVE LONGER.|`|DtkLsetkaa	I don't know why the vet said that about waiting 1 month, i haven't heard that before, it might be best to call a different vet and get a second opinion.  Be very careful right now, she is going to try to escape and it won't be fun.  I know that vets usually won't spay WHILE she is in season, but as soon as its over it should be fine.  I would call around.|`|RN1wGlWWaa	Find another vet.  Once cats start going in/out of heat, you cannot time them very well.  Its almost impossible to predict that a cat will not be in heat for a month.<br>  <br>  Some vets don't like to do them when in heat as its more bleeding, but find a vet to do her now.  Its only a matter of time before she does get out and the toms breed her.  Plus you don't want them spraying all around your house either!|`|F2JEvYX7aa	Sounds like you need to call a different vet, there is no reason why a cat can't be spayed at 6 months. Call another vet and they will do it for you.|`|AJxl0IvHaa	Yeah, change vets.<br>  6 months is a GREAT age to spay!!!<br>  EDIT::Even in heat they can do it; With extra charge yeah, but they still will.......|`|Tc23KWgzaa	Find a new vet.  Ours says it's best at 4mo, before they go into season at all.  Maybe that's your animal medicine wherever you are, but here in TX, USA, our unwanted pet population is overwhelming.<br>  <br>  As soon as the boys wander away, take her in and get her surgery.  You are a very good pet owner, taking responsibility for your cat.  <br>  <br>  TX Mom|`|oDVx7nSxaa	You just need to find another  vet.  There is no reason at all that a cat cannot be spayed while in heat.  There is increased flow of blood to the uterus during this time, so the vet needs to show a bit more care when tying off the veins and arteries - but this is something any good vet will do anyway!  <br>  <br>  Your vet sounds as though he graduated from vet school and then never kept up to date.  Kittens are now - safely! - being spayed at 2 1/2 half pounds.  There is no reason at all to make a cat go through heat cycles as yours has been doing.  And if your vet hasn't kept up to date on the latest research on when cats can be safely spayed, then I question what else he has neglected to keep up on? <br>  <br>  Find another vet, get your poor girl spayed, and everyone will be healthier and happier.
BTHY8oZYaa	We had a similar situation...with a Border Collie, Roxy.<br>  <br>  I called the Shelter where I got her.  They had a "dog whisperer" of sorts.  He came down to our house and explained everything.<br>  <br>  He said, <br>  First look at her Breed.  Roxy needed tons exercise and something to keep her busy.  Kids don't cover it, more toys or contact.<br>  Also she was under 1 year and she would mellow out in time.<br>  <br>  *******She/we needed obedience school******  She also thought she was the Alpha and needed to be put in her place. <br>  <br>  He said for the jumping (I know you didn't mention jumping) and chewing, try a mixture of water and vinegar.   Put the mixture in a spray bottle and spray nose when she jumped or chewed.  (Just don't overdo it.)  <br>  <br>  Background:  Roxy chewed up anything she could get inside and outside.  My child's toys, she popped balls, our sprinkler system, our fence, even the wires going into our house.  In addition she would jump on everyone and always give kisses, knocking down my child and friends.<br>  <br>  I spent every spare minute with Roxy.  I tried walking her every day, but with her crazy behavior it was hard.|`|F2JEvYX7aa	How about keeping an eye on her. She is not going to know weather or not to chew on something unless you train her. Keep her on a lead in the house so that you have complete control over her every move until she learns proper house manners.|`|MT0gw2hmaa	sounds like she's got too much energy to burn, and is a tell tale sign of her not getting enough exercise. Are you taking her out on walks? so she will have to use energy and nap when she gets home instead chewing up things. Dogs chew on things out of boredom and lack of exercise, my dachshund was full of energy and chewed on his toys obsessively and his behavior got really bad to the point that he started going through the trash.. until I started him on a daily walk in the morning and at twilight, the behavior was gone, he was just bored and needed to get out.|`|oLVJ9EKAaa	1) Make sure your house is dog proof: i.e nothing is on the floor like books or expensive items that could possibly get chewed.<br>  2) Anything like door handles that are within reach of your dog you can paint with Chili paste or mustard. Unless they're a labrador (they eat everything!) then this should deter you dog from chewing.<br>  3) If you ever see your dog chewing items that it shouldn't be then make sure you give them a firm tap on the nose and a strong NO!<br>  4) Encourage your dog when it is chewing it's own toys.<br>  If your dog's a puppy then it should (hopefully!) grow out of this.

Exercise is usually the answer to most behavioral problems.  How much exercise does she get daily?  I don't know what kind of dog she is so I don't know how much to recommend but large breed dogs require about 3 - 5 miles of walking/running per day and small breeds require about half of that.  Also, depending on the breed, she could require some form of mental stimulation like agility training.  If she is a puppy, this is a normal phase & requires constant supervision.  When you cannot supervise, kennel her somewhere safe and provide her with indestructible chew toys - Kong or other.|`|NKRJQLIXaa	destroy things when your not home or just destroy things when your home or not? first.. catch them doing it, SNATCH it from them, put a frown on your face, look them in the eye, and say "NO! BAD DOG! BAD!".. then drop it right in front of them and say "LEAVE IT!". Its all about your body language, tone of voice (stern but not yelling), and good eye contact. That worked very well for heavy chewing pup. <br>  <br>  Eventually he realize the only thing he can chew on without getting in trouble is his 2 bones,  a sterilized beef bone and a heavy duty galileo nylabone, both very durable. Too many toys will confuse them on whats theres and whats not. <br>  <br>  However, i notice if i dont give him exercise before i leave for school.. he will destroy something of mine (he loves dirty socks and shoes), and he knows what did wrong because he will be hiding in his crate, ears all the way back being submissive, looking guilty when i get back. Sometimes he will try and hide it in his crate. Some people say dont punish them if you dont catch them in the act, but i do anyways. I pick up what he chewed up and do the same thing as above. Its really my faulty tho for not giving him enough exercise before i left him.<br>  <br>  For a hyper breed like mine.. walks arent good enough. I rarely walk him, and i only do so to show him around town and teach him to stay on the sidewalk just incase he gets lost one day. An hour or more of fetch, somewhere big like the dog park with lots of running space, preferrably early in the day will  mellow out a hyper dog for the rest of the day. If your dog doesnt like playing fetch, then jogging or biking will do the job too. You want to see them panting hard and nearly ready to pass out before you bring them in.|`|LCCm6JiIaa	1) Make sure your house is dog proof: i.e nothing is on the floor like books or expensive items that could possibly get chewed.<br>  2) Anything like door handles that are within reach of your dog you can paint with Chili paste or mustard.

We have 2 dogs, a pug and a lab. my pug hardly EVER chewed on anything, he chewed up a pair of my flip flops and that's it. Now my lab on the other hand was HORRIBLE. She seriously chewed up anything she could find. Even the corners of my DRYWALL!!! I just had to cage her while she was unattended...it sucks, but it's not worth coming home and seeing things destroyed. Or get a baby gate and keep her in one certain area. My lab chews through everything I get her too, so I just get her bigger things. Get her real bones, rather than rawhide, it seems to last a lot longer. They also have those "Kong" I think they're called, toys, they are like a real strong rubber material, and you can put treats in them, or even fill it with peanut butter, this will keep her busy. Just make sure you keep everything put away...I even have to put my rugs up at night to this day (and she is over a year old now), because she will destroy my rugs when I leave them down. She does stay outside most of the time now...she is so destructive. It's just so hard to break them...all you can really do is just have PLENTY of things for them to chew on...you may go through a lot of things, but you will find the right stuff. Good luck!|`|IGumeonKaa	Well, you should  train her by making WANT to chew on HER toys. Sounds impossible? well, say you have a shoe that maybe she tends to chew on. you should sprinkle A little bit of pepper on it and then have her smell it. She'll hate it and never want to chew on it again. Then  soak one of her toys in meat juice, anything flavorful, than have her smell her toy. She'll love it:)  This method is priceless and a great help.  Hope it works:)|`|xktfWz5Caa	Aww, sounds like your dog is bored.  Take her for regular walks.  Have your tried chew bones.
