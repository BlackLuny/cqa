20090203095918AA3jfQ7	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	My 22 month old son's urine has a terrible odor. What can cause this and what can i do about it?	I have to immediately take my son's pampers out of the house after he urinates because it will leave the room with an odor. His urine has an odd smell which is very "loud". A lot of people tell me that he needs to drink water because he drinks mostly juice. Is that true and if so is there any other ways I can get rid of the odor?

I can see something under his bottom gums...thinking its a tooth trying to come through.      anyway, he hasn't been sleeping good the last week or so and a lot of the nights he ends up sleeping in the bed with me and my husband sleeps in the other room.  he gets tired of me getting up and down trying to soothe our son (but he won't get up to help soothe him) and he finally decides that the only way any of us are going to get any sleep is if I just put him in the bed with me...which is driving him up the wall.      I don't know what else to do?  I know our son doesn't feel good right now...he's constantly "clawing" at his gums so I know they have to be irritating him and it just seems like he wants to be close to somebody at night (even though both of us - baby and me - don't get much sleep b/c he will wake up cranky and I wake up and try to get him settled back down to go back to sleep).  i just don't know what else to do...my hubby is always irritated about this...

He's constantly comparing himself to his friends, telling them why he's better than them, what they can't do, etc. We are not negative like that at home, and go really far out of our way to show him how he should be treating his friends. Quite frankly, at this point, I'm surprised he has any friends. I thought it might be a stage, but it's been almost a year. I've talked to him about it, pointed out things that his friends are good at, that he's not, and talked about celebrating differences, etc., but I can't seem to stop it. Any suggestions?

We tried to explain the difference between being married and having a wedding (which we might not be having), and she said she didn't want us to get married then because we wouldn't "let" her be the flower girl.         I don't know if she is upset by us getting married, or feels left out.  How do we explain that we just aren't having a wedding like she sees on tv?  Or know if she's just upset by not being a flower girl or by us getting married in general.         My fiancee doesn't think she's upset about us being  together, and that I'm over reacting.

We were really close, bestfriends, the whole "Shabangg"   That happened for over 7 or 8 months [From the middle of the school year, and all summer].      So now, he's in high school [a grade older than me, I'm 8th grade].   And He MUST think he's too cool to even talk to me, because he doesnt answe anything.. And it's been getting to me, [not to mention kind of hurting] but I've just pushed down and tried not to think about it.      Our 8th grade class went to the High school today for a tour and all that good stuff, and he's there, and I try to ignore him, but i cant.      So I go over and talk to him, and we talk for about 5 minutes, and his girlfriend [She's a senior] comes over. [Just shoot me right?].  So he's sitting there, Holding her hand, loveydovey stuff and says "oh this is my girlfriend". While he's still talking to me.      Now, I know he has a right to move on and get a girlfriend or whatever.. But to do all that in front of me? Wow.   He says that he "Still cares for me" and "I'll always be in his heart".   but I don't believe him any more      I mean, maybe I'm making to big a deal out of this...   But How do I just get over him? So that this doesnt bug me anymore, and we can go back to being friends?   Cause I truly miss him, just as my friend.       I know this is long, but Thanks for your help in advance. (:

20090219185108AAD8tWI	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Worries about baby's stool color?	My 6 week old son has been having problems with his stools since he was 3 weeks old and I found jelly/bloody stool in his diaper one morning that lasted two days. We took him to the hospital where they did x rays, blood work and a stool culture which all came back fine. He's been to the doctor a few times already for the stool and a nasty rash that developed a few days after the stool problem started. Yet he's still occaisionally pooping with blood streaks, and never has the typical 'yellow mustardy seedy' stool. It's gone from mustardy yellow to orange/brown, to now typically green and sort of thick/sticky. I can't keep going to the doctor only to be sent home but they're not telling me anything and I can't stop worrying. He's breastfed only and a colicky boy. Does anyone know what the cause of the stool changes could be? I'm at my wit's end feeling like it's a stomach bug or infection but my doctors aren't paying any attention to my concerns.

20090219184748AAK9SEA	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Night time noises = restless sleep?	I was just wondering. They are now 10 mos old. Both my girls make little whiney noises, sometimes cry they'll lift their legs high up and then slam them on the mattress... shift around a lot too. Do you think its because they're restless, does this mean their sleep is not restful? I'm also wondering if while making noise in their sleep, they could accidentally wake themselves up? Do your babies do the same...or do they sleep "like logs" :)
20090219184019AAkTMKJ	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	My girlfriend missed her period.  We had sex and it was only her 2nd time.?	We took a pregnancy test 3 times all came out negative.  She is 8 days late.  We used the EPT HPT.  If she is not pregnant, what else can be causing her to miss her period?  She has never been more than 7 days late according to her.   Can having sex cause her cycle to be off?  Since it was her 2nd time and she has not had sex in a while prior to that.   PS: She was on anti biotics for a throat infection, can that throw off her cycle this much?      Thank you.

20090219183803AAzUQao	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	Stopped taking birth control 3 wks ago, trying for baby but started bleeding again...help?	we decided to try for a baby so 3 weeks ago i took my last pill of that month and haven't taken any more. i got my period as usual and after it was over, we've been having sex every other day pretty much since i'm not sure how long my cycle is (used to be 6 or so weeks but i've been on the pill for years so i don't know anymore).      today i started bleeding (not a lot, very light amount and light colored).      is this normal? what could be the causes of this? should we still have sex (i was planning to tonight before this happened) today?      i'm 31 and we really want to have a baby and the last time i went off the pill (6 years ago or so), i didn't have a period (after the first one coming off the pill) for a whole year so this seems pretty odd to me that i'm bleeding now.      any help would be greatly appreciated. thanks :)

20090219185432AAnEk5t	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Can they be wrong about how far along i am?	I was wondering if the doctor could possibly not predict the correct amount of weeks that I am. Or are they always right?  I went on Nov 24 and she told me that I was  14 weeks which would mean that the baby is only 12 weeks. but when I am looking at the calendar it doesn't make sense to me because that would have meant i was on my period around august 21 right? I am just wondering because I want to make sure that I ask to on maternity leave at the right time.

20090219183207AA6mvgn	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	X hus is claiming son who is now 19...at what age does this change and my son claim himself?	My son turned 18 on Jan 13, 2008 and is now 19.  My ex-husband paid child support on him until he graduated from high school.   All my divorce decree says is that each party has one child for their exemptions.  I was assigned the youngest and my Ex was assigned the oldest.  As already mentioned, my oldest is now 19   and when he went to file his 2008 taxes since he made around $6,000 he found out that his Dad had already claimed him.  This knocked down my son's income tax return down by about $500.   My son lives with me and we support him almost 100%. He pays for his vehicle and insurance.  I paid for his college tuition to a technical school.  The only help my exhusband has given is the court ordered child support which was calculated 13 years ago and never increased.   Who has the right to use my son as an exemption now that he is 19 years old (was 18 during 2008)  My exhusband? My son? Myself?  And what steps should I take.  Do I need legal advise?   Thanks

Okay, so here's the deal -earlier this month my husband has used the withdraw method on me once, and didn't withdraw through anal sex.  The rest of the time we've used a condom.

Symptoms: Nausea (no puking) heart burn, extreme hunger an hour or so after every meal, and I'm much more sleepy, but when I sleep I toss and turn.      I just want your opinion.  I know the answer will come soon, but I want to know what you think?  Pregnant or flu?  It's fun to guess:p  I don't want it to be the flu. :(

20090219190142AAwoaFc	Pregnancy & Parenting;Grade-Schooler	Hugging kids in school? Opinion?	Hey everyone.      I teach a class where kids have no families, they get beat up at home, and they come to school with red eyes.      I generally make hugging a hands off policy and just pat them on the backs or the heads.      I am actually a long term substitute teacher, and these kids and I have gotten to know each other so well.       The problem is, they are so needy and they come and hug me and wrap their arms around my waist and won't let go. I usually pat their heads or backs, then hold my hands out to the side and try to get them to let go.      Today, a kid comes up and does that in the cafeteria. I was talking to the counselor and he had been doing so well in class and had been making progress. He hugged me around the waist and I wasn't thinking and just put my arm on his shoulder, barely touching him.      A kindegartener(sp?) came up and asked if I was his girlfriend. I feel horrible. The counselor was standing there and talking to us the whole time when the kindegartener(sp?) came up and asked that, and I feel horrible that that happened. I just wasn't thinking. My arm was on his shoulder, that's all, nothing else.      Is there a better way to deal with kids that are clingy and won't let go? Thank you !
20090219190225AAdaby9	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	My daughter is very whiny, is this normal?	she's 19 months old and all she does is whine about everything if she doesn't get what she wants and that's almost constantly. if i don't pick her up she gets really upset and its not like i don't ever pick her up i do, but sometimes my back hurts so bad and I just cant. I'll sit down and have her sit on my lap instead but she wants nothing to do with it. is it normal for a 19 month old to be so whiny and clingy? what can i do to help her get over this?
20090219214835AAfrsDj	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Have you ever smacked a kid in the grocery store?	I really hate it when little kids are running around with no discipline or rule and their parents don't care. I got tired of it a year ago and would trip or knock down the kids sometimes and that would usually make me feel better and make them shut up or at least cry. Sometimes the mom's would be mad, but I would just say it was an accident or come on to them and it would all work out. Don't you hate it when parents do this and get defensive when someone does their job for them?

I am now..getting pretty worried. I have some experience more with behavioural and low self esteem than with Epilepsy. There is a girl in my grade who has it, so I know some of the precations she has to take but nothing else. She told me that he hasn't had a siezure in a while and should be fine. I got ideas of what to do from the mother. I am still fairly worried. It's going to be in the afternoon tomorrow to around 8-9pm. they also have an older son who I am not babysitting tis time but may some other time.      ideas on how to relieve being worried?

I recently posted more of a "poll" to get an idea of where mother's stood on stocking up on disposables, and mentioned cloth diapers.  The more research I do, the more I feel cloth diapers are for us.  If you use cloth, could you please give me some advice as far as brands, home laundering, and over all general experience go.  I'd really appreciate it.  I had always been under the assumption it was an environmental "movement" to go back to cloth diapers, but I realize now that that is not the case, and would like to educate myself in the upcoming months.        Thank you for your help!

We waited like j=he wanted to get engaged, we waited like he wanted to get married, and agreed to wait a year to start having children. Well its been 4 years, and I am now almost 26 years old. I have been talking a lot lately about having a baby, and he just kinda smiles and nods.      I told him I was going to get an ovulation test and I asked him why he didn't seem happy, and he said he didn' think it was a good time right now for a baby.      He always says we dont have enough money. If I have to wait for us to have the right amount of money, I am never going to get a baby!!!!      Is it really the money, or does he not want to have a baby with me? I have heath conditions and low fertility so I need to try ASAP and I feel like he is stealing my child bearing years:(

20090219192804AAU0NtT	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	What if your teenager sent?	1012 text messages a month?       This is on a unlimited text package that is $10 a month.       Would you be angry?   Would you not care?   If you were angry would you punish?    Would you take anything away? What? For how long?         I was trying to find a number I have called before and I saw all my text messages I've sent and added them up and got 1012 for this billing cycle so far which the cycle ends today, so this is for the month.       I am the teen and I am 19 and the only reason I am on my mom's cell phone plan is because she renewed with verizon march of last year and the plan isn't up for another year and after that i'll be going on my own plan.
20090219190732AA6ICrI	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Should the Octuplets mom give them up for adoption?	She has no job no income other than SSI for her disabled children and foodstamps, there's no father to help raise them and she lives with her mother and her mothers home is under foreclosure so she will soon be homeless unless a kind hearted american donates 23 grand to help her mother get under the foreclosure. How can this woman even consider raising 14 children? I'm surprised child welfare hasn't stepped in already

I don't care if a girl/woman was sexually abused, it's still her baby and she shouldn't kill it. She should give the precious baby a chance to live, if she doesn't want it, I think adoption would be a better choice. It's so terrible and painful for the unborn babies. ):

20090219191439AA3TPBX	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	My parents hate me...what do I do?	I'm serious for thinking this.    My Mom: She always has something bad to say about me. Every single day, she puts me down and says something like, "If you do that one more time, I'm going to make you go live with your Grandparents' place in Korea." (I'm in the U.S. by the way.) Or, "I can't put up with you anymore. Someday, I might have to put you in the orphanage." It's really annoying, seeing how she says these phrases at least 5 times a day.       She's never once complimented me on my successes. When I got into the AP program in Junior High, she didn't care. When I came home with perfect grades, she ignored them. When I became the concert master of one of the most prestigious youth orchestras in my state and the section leader (viola) for a different orchestra, she never complimented me.       My Dad: Pretty much all he does is stick with my mom.      It's quite annoying and frustrating at times. Even though this sounds selfish, I would like a bit of recognition of my achievements.       What should I do now? What can I do about my mom? What should I do if my "parents" throw me out on the streets? I do have a sum of money in the bank...should I use that to buy an airplane ticket to Korea? Or should I find an orphanage to go to?      Please help.

20090219201024AARN0lE	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	How can my Chinese wife get permission to have our second baby in China?	I am from the USA, and my wife is from China.  We are both in China right now.  My wife is from Ne He, which is in the Heilongjiang Province.  We registered our marriage in Harbin, which is the place we had to so for Chinese Citizens who are from that province.  We had our first child in February, 2008 in Shanghai.  Our daughter, Isabella, is a US Citizen.  Now my wife is pregnant again in the city of Guanzhou, and the population plan office is being very difficult!  They want my wife to go back to Harbin, her home province, to get permission saying that she can have another baby.  But Isabella, our daughter, is a US Citizen, and the people in Harbin, which is very far from where we live, won't issue such a statement.  Therefore, my wife cannot currently give birth anywhere in China.  But our second child would also be a foreigner, so none of this makes any sense.  The one child policy only mostly only applies if the baby is going to be a Chinese Citizen.........If my wife were a foreigner, it would be even easier.....So, how do we go about solving this?  What can we do to make it to where we can finally get the right documents?

20090219214924AAqjN3j	Pregnancy & Parenting;Grade-Schooler	My 13 year old was jumped at school, several kids were involved in setting him up what can we do legally?	Some kids he used to hang out with, thought he was acting to cool for them, they "hired" a big ninth grader to beat him up, they thought there plan out so they had some one eat breakfast with him, then a few of them walked up and asked him how he had been, they said come hang out with us, they waited for him to finish eating, dump his tray and walk out of the lunchroom, he was walking down the hall and some shouted his name when he turned around he was hit so hard he was knocked out one of the kids kept hitting him, he came to in the nurses office, he suffered a mild concussion, needed dremabond to seal up the laceration on his face, he has multiple bruises on his body, two kids were suspended but there are four others who were in on this attack. We filed charges but they are saying simple assult? Is this right, do we have a civil case? I am confused?
20090219215014AAGDu6L	Pregnancy & Parenting;Toddler & Preschooler	PARENTS: Whats your opinion? Is this your pet peeve too?	Is it just me, or does anyone else get really annoyed when a mother posts a question for help and advice about their child's constant hitting, biting, kicking, spitting, slapping balls to the floor tantrums... Or when their kid abuses their family pets & beats on other kids in school etc...   And then they try to defend it by stating their kid is "above average intelligence" ((LoL! That kills me! rotflmao!)) They do this often, some to clarify its not a mental disorder I guess, but others say it just to confirm that their kid is "special" and needs extra stimulation that other kids (the dumb, behaved ones) don't.       And like 90% of the answerer's advise ALL kinds of tried and true methods to stop the behavior. Thus wasting their breath & time because she just takes that as an insult to her failed parenting skills. Or fears admitting she may be doing something wrong.      Then like one or two answerer's will say they are "having the same problem", and tell the mom to basically pray for a sunny day, do nothing OR give the kid MORE attention and hugs & love & kisses & trips to the park etc... (reward the behavior??? hmmm how's that working for ya?)      Then the questioner chooses their answer as "BEST ANSWER" !!!!       I ask, what level of dear sweet denial is this???      WHY is it that when a mother sees another mother going through the same insane BS with their kid, they go into instant denial and tell the mom that they went thru that too and its "normal behavior"??? (I wish the tables were turned and it was your kids at preschool (or wherever) on the receiving end of the abuse to see how you would deal with it then)      PLEASE NOTE: If you are failing as a mother in this particular department, you really shouldn't offer other moms advice! Just hit your back button and move on to the next question.      Furthermore in my opinion (and I am sure many others), is not "normal" and the only reason you are saying that to the poster is because when your kid did it, you were too lazy and did nothing to correct them and basically decided it was "normal" behavior to let yourselves off the hook for not raising your child...properly.      I want to say to all the moms that have kids over 2, that are hitting, biting and abusing other peoples kids that you need to get off your a**** and break a sweat (Godforbid), and DO something about it. At the very least ACKNOWLEDGE THERE'S A PROBLEM! (especially to the other moms and kids that your kid has physically & yes even emotionally hurt)      And if you have a kid that kicks you, smacks you, spits at you, or laughs in your face when you discipline them, that's NOT "normal" either! Your raising & creating a future menace to society. And it (in my opinion) IS your fault, not your kids.       "There are no such things as "bad kids" ONLY bad parenting"      What do you all think? As for me, I am trying to raise my kids as productive members of society and I teach them never to use violence to get their point across. My main goal as a parent is to teach them love, compassion and empathy for their fellow man. Not to make sure they can speak french and master algebra by the age of 3. But now I have to send them out into the world and pray that one of these kids dont beat the crap out of them?

20090219215451AAyMolP	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Sleep Positioner Recommendations?	Hi, our 4-month old son has now learned how to sleep on his side in his crib.  We're worried that he might end up sleeping on his stomach and may not know how to roll over back onto his back (we've read the stories that sleeping on the stomach increases the risk of SIDS).      So the question -- are there any sleep positioners specifically made for cribs that you can recommend?       Thanks,   Roland and Julia

20090219221440AAIDtoU	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Can you get pregnant before IUD is removed?	Okay, I wanted to get my Merina IUD removed, so I scheduled the appointment. However my doctor did not tell me to not have sex before having it removed. We had unprotected sex two days before the removal and then that day and the next day I felt cramping pains like those of when you are ovulating. I had it removed and have not had my period since. Not even one drop or cramp. I was wondering, can you ovulate when you have it in? And if so, could you get pregnant while it is in but the egg just hasn't gotten down to the uterus until a few days after it is removed? I have been feeling very tired and sick off and on for the last three weeks. All tests have been negative, but two turned to postive after sitting a while. Thanks!

20090219192536AAXyyZK	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	I really think something is wrong but I'm embarassed to say anything to anyone?	I am now 21 weeks pregnant & I think I am seriously suffering from prenatal depression. I'm very embarassed and don't know how to ask for help from my obgyn or my boyfriend/family.       I'm feeling detached, not happy & like I don't care about taking care of myself in order to stay healthy for my baby. I find myself hating my body & the way it's changing & watching birthing stories, crying at how happy these women are & wishing I can feel the same. I force myself to eat... I can't sleep properly & have crazy dreams. I've started to hate my life & all those who love me... I know I love them inside but my brain is fighting my heart. I swear. I don't want to leave my house and I fear the public.      Does this sound like prenatal depression? What can I do to cope until my Dr's appointment on Monday & how do I go about bringing up my feelings and concerns to my Dr? Thank you very much for your (hopefully!) caring, non-judgemental responses.

20090219164313AArI4Ce	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	When to start charting?	My son is 14 months old and I still have not had my first post-baby period.  I also have been breastfeeding.  The last few weeks I have nursed about once every 48 hours.     I saw the doctor this week and they assured me that some woman do not ovulate at all even if they are nursing as little as I was (I stopped 2 days ago).  Some woman just have really senestive bodies when it comes to breastfeeding and I am one of those woman.   They told me once I have completely stopped nursing I have to wait 3 months and if I still do not have a period or a BFP then they will do hormonal testing.   My question is how effective is charting when you have not had your first post-baby period?  And should I wait until I get it before I start charting?   Also, does fertility friend costs anything?

It seems like when the contractions got just close enough to go to the hospital, the started to slow and time further apart. I'm truly frustrated by this I have been having contractions for three days! I always seem to get them really strong in the morning though... I went to the doctors two days ago and was told I was 2cm and 80% effaced. I'm probably around 4cm dilated with all the contractions I've been having. This morning I have 10-15 minute apart contractions for three hours then they just died out. I even left work for it because I thought it was "time" I'm truly frustrated with this, is there anything I can do to speed up labor and get it going? I've tried walking and I get too tired before it does much. Also does anyone have a guess as to when I could be going into TRUE labor??

20090219175250AAJwd41	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Baby holding in her poop?	My 7 1/2 month old baby had a few past moments of constipation once she was introduced to solids. She's been breastfed since birth and I plan to do so until she's a year old. Lately these past few days she's been pooping a little bit at a time everyday. I thought nothing of it until today when I watched her and she was holding her legs out straight to hold in her poop. A little came out but she held the rest in. I've read that sometimes baby subconsciously hold in there bowel movements cause they're scared it's going to hurt. Her stools are a lot softer now, to the point that they aren't hard. So what am I suppose to do to keep her from holding it in? Will she stop on her own or is there something I can do? She eats 2-3 servings a day of solids, and breastfeeds 3-5 times a day. I feed her fruits, veggies, oatmeal, yogurt, and she gets applejuice.

20090219164333AABpqjt	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	How to tell his parents about 2nd child?	I am 26, my husband is 29, we are happily married (for 3 years) and we have an 11 month old son. We llive in our own house. My husband just started his own business and is doing well and I quit my teaching job to be a stay at home mom. We just found out we are pregnant with baby #2 and we don't know how to tell my husband's parents.  They love their grandson, but they are very cautious people and a little crazy about planning stuff out- it's almost obsessive. They wanted us to have our son's entire college tuition saved up before we even thought of conceiving him! Anyway, someone asked us the other day when we were planning to have another one in front of my mother in law (I know, rude question). She just busted out laughing trying to make light of the situation. Well, at that point we already knew we were pregnant- so we were like- oh boy! We love them and everything, but we don't know what to say. I know they will think it is too soon and we can't afford it- even though we have never asked them for money or help. For some reason they think they have carte blanche to give their opinion in everything we do. We don't want a lecture and I don't want to see their disappointed faces either because it will make me mad. My husband will likely tell them. Should we tell them by phone? What should we say? We aren't going to say anything rude so please don't suggest it! Thanks!

20090219164343AANqVDe	Pregnancy & Parenting;Grade-Schooler	I want to spank my 8 year old every time she does her homework!!!?	I am so angry at her for being rude and I don't know how to handle this. Help! She will goof off to make me angry. Sometimes I absolutely lose it and yell at her and smack her. Other times I laugh because if I don't, I know I will explode. Sometimes I put her in the corner. I need a solution that is effective that I can be consistent with .       A few examples of her ridiculous behavior... She drops her paper and then picks it up with her teeth while putting her bottom up in the air. She writes with two pencils. She drops her pencil and pretends she can't reach it. She moves very very slowly to reach the pencil. Sometimes she has to go to the bathroom... for 20 minutes. Sometimes she is "hungry" or "thirsty" but she isn't. She whines and suddenly develops a stomach ache. If I leave the room, she starts dancing and singing infront of her mirror. She flops down on the floor as if she fell off her chair.       I know the answer must be simple, but right now I just want to hurt her, or lock her in her room. I am so ANGRY. She likes this game. I hate it.

Ok so last week I went in at 18 weeks for a regular ultrasound and the baby was hiding but he pointed at something and said possible girl. Then Today I went for a 3d ultrasound and the baby lifted its legs up and you could see its behind. There was the 3 lines there. Then the 3 techs told me it was a girl. So could it be that we are having a boy and could not see the boy parts even when the baby lifted its legs? Please help. Thanks!

20090219165135AAoFM7G	Pregnancy & Parenting;Baby Names	What are some ridiculous names? I mean things like Anita Tissue.?	Just the other day my boyfriend, me, and some of our friends were sitting in the woods talking about the torture that some parents put their children through with names.      Like my friend Xes. She now goes by her middle name, which is Lucie.      The conversation started when Hailey said that her cousin Austin e-mailed her saying her just met someone named Hiy-Nia Lu. she was Asian. Anyway, her name is pronounced HI-NEE-UH. Like HI-NEE with another syllable. And Lu as in LOO and isn't that like a British term for bathroom?      Then we all brought up weird names. I talked about my friend Xes's name, pronounced Zez.      My boyfriend said something about how his cousin almost named her daughter Jezebel Satin. Satin pronounced Sai-ten. Like a messed up pronunciation of satan. Like cross beetween redneck and British pronounciation of the name. (No offense. just say it out loud. You'll know what I meean.)    And Jezebel was an idol worshipping queen in the Bible.      Paige brought up the fact that some girl's last name is Hooker. Her first name is Ima. Like her name would be I'm a hooker. It's a pretty first name though.      Cody said that when he was visiting his aunt in Wyoming, he meet twins names: Jelliann and Ididya. Jelly-anne and I-deed-ya. similar to I-did-ya. disgusting right? Poor children. Melvin remembered his friend Joey Cox had an adopted Chinese cousin name Maia Cox. My-Uh-Cox.      Then at my cousin's school, there are twin brother named Peter and Andrew Ness. They are avid track runners. Sports annoucments:      "P. Ness is ahead of A.Ness. Now A.Ness is right beside P.Ness!       Most teachers can't figure out why it's so hilarious.      Willie Stroker. Will he stroke her?      What are some bizzare names such as these that you've heard or that you know?

20090219193206AA9KlD9	Pregnancy & Parenting;Toddler & Preschooler	My 3yr old wants to breastfeed how can I tell him no without hurting his feelings?	I am still nursing my 16 month old son and my 3 year old for the last few months on and off will try and nurse to.       Because I was afraid he would feel left out while I nursed after I had my second I always asked him to lay on me (like with his head on my legs opposite his brothers head) so that he didn't feel left out. It became route in for him to lay with me and eventually he would just sit next to us or rub his brothers head.      Around a year he pretty much stopped caring but now he is all over me every time my breast is out.       I tell him he is not a baby and he starts to cry, I tell him only little boys need Mommy's milk and he says he is still a little boy. I don't know what to say to make him get it. I DON"T want him to feel like he is being left out so what should I do? (breastfeeding him again is not an option :/ )

I am a mom of two beautiful boys and I have been have similar symptoms that I've only experience during pregnancy. I am wondering if my symptoms seem like a classic case of pms or pregnancy. Take a look and tell me what you think.   Headaches (occassionally)    craving salt   extremely emotion/lack of focus   increase appetite   restless   metal taste in mouth (occassionally) began a week ago   constipation (tmi) I know   indegestion (occassionally)   All of these symptoms started a week ago      I know you think since I have kids I should sorta know. But I stopped breastfeeding a month ago and was wondering maybe it was a case of hormonal changes and pms.
20090219191734AAYxupG	Pregnancy & Parenting;Grade-Schooler	How would you feel about this?	My son had a best friend who he hasn't seen since we moved (same area, same school district, just moved about 2 miles) nearly a year ago. He has since tried hanging out w/him but the little boy is grounded nearly all the time. My son had since left school (we tried cyber school) and has just this past week returned. He happens to be in class w/this little boy. Anyway, this little boy says to my son that he is not allowed to hang out w/him because he is a bad influence (I found this tremendously odd since this little boy's parents constantly praised my son for how well behaved and courteous he is AND they have not hung out in nearly a year because the boy was constantly grounded). Now, if they were inseparable and their child was getting in trouble I could respect their thoughts even after praising my son BUT he hasn't even seen him in a year let alone been able to influence  him in anyway. I am quite agitated about this (obviously).

We do everything that best girl friends would do. We are in our late teens and he's having a very hard time finding acceptance. His family has basically ignored and denied him since he came out. Well...ever since he has been openly out, I've noticed that he has a new crush about every other day. He met another gay guy about two days ago and within the first hours of meeting they became boyfriends. Now I support him and everything and I'm not saying this is happening just because he's gay... but I don't understand. They're already saying I love you and making out and other things that I haven't done with anybody I haven't been with for at least a couple of weeks- let alone somebody I've JUST met.       How can I bring this up to him without attacking him or sounding jealous?

20090219164606AACdM0U	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	I'm 15 and pregnant.. How do i tell my mom?	I'm 15. My bf is 17. I'm pregnant and I don't know how to tell my mom. My bf is happy and he wants to be there. Which I'm really really happy about. We want to keep the baby. We both know how hard it will be. But, we had sex. We used a condom. We knew the consequences of having sex and we did it anyway. Now we're willing to accept consequences of our actions. I fully understand that I am young. To young to have a baby, But I'm going to. That doesn't mean I'm quiting school. That doesn't mean I'm not going to collage. I just have to work harder for the better things in life. We're going to do the best we can for us and this baby. Now, I just need your help on how to tell them. I'm not sure. What do you think would be the most possable easy way? If there is one at all. Please and Thank You.
20090219164709AA7IAeK	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Please someone, How can I Tell If I'm pregnant?	We do it with out a condom one to many times for the past two months i've been lucky. But since Valentines just passed our sex has just been so much more frequent. I feel like I'm getting a baby bump and my breasts are more tender but I think I'm over exaggerating. For another reason the subject of Pregnancy has been coming to my attention by other people or just randomly. Maybe it cause I'm so stressed about it that it catches my eye but I'm so worried does anyone know early signs if you're pregnant I know its to early to take the test too

He scheduled for a ultra sound for Monday. He thinks I will most likely need to have a csection. How long does it take to schedule  a csection?

My DH and I have been TTC now for about 3 months, no luck so far but I know it's still early.  Anyways, with all the horrible things happening with the economy, people losing jobs left and right, states on the verge of bankruptcy, a war that seems like it's going to continue on & possibly get bigger (afghanistan, iran, etc) - is anyone a little freaked out about having a little baby in such a chaotic time?  I really can't wait to have a baby but I can't help but wonder what kind of country this child will have to grow up in...it kind of freaks me out!  And I worry about the more immediate concerns as well, like, what if I get pregnant, we both lose our jobs, and we can't get any healthcare for our family because the government can no longer afford to give us assistance?    Anyways, I'm just wondering if any other people who are TTC are having any of the same fears as I do...

20090219192756AAIwRp2	Pregnancy & Parenting;Grade-Schooler	Question: My son's birthday is CHristmas eve, he just turned 6?	Every year we do a family party, this year we decided because he has many school friends that we weould only have a party for his friends.  Being understanding to other familys crazy holiday schedules, I felt a party after the holidays would be best.  So I planned a party for the end of march, (good weather, nothing really going on)  Well one of my sons friends mom had a huge issue with that.  She told me tha because I am giving him a party 3 months than his b day, that my child is spoiled and that I cant pick when to have my childs party, a week before or after his b day is fine, and that i need to have more children and "face reality"  huh???  I was trying to accomidate busy schedules of other familys, I dont see what I am doing as wrong, I also dont feel my child should be peanilized because of his birthdate. Some feedback would be much appreciated, is this wrong for me to celebrate his b day after the fact?  Thanks

20090203104902AASPmnT	Pregnancy & Parenting;Other - Pregnancy & Parenting	Sorry...I know this is probably asked alot...?	I've been doing research on here and on a few nursing websites trying to find info on what kind of nursing bras to get and how the sizing works since your breast size changes so much. I've read everything from buying your pre-pregnancy bra size, to buying one size bigger than what you are at 30 weeks, to not even buying bra's until the week after your milk comes in.      Since I got so many different answers, I went into a Motherhood Maternity store thinking they could be of some help. As it turns out, both sales associates knew nothing about nursing, or even anything maternity related.      So now I'm hoping an experienced mom, or even a lactation consultant will read this and help me out. Out of everything I read...I seemed to see the whole "buy one size up from where you are at the end of pregnancy" a lot. If I did that, it would put me at a 34DDD/F, and I really do not think I will be that big for the entirety of nursing. What would your advice be as far as what size would be best to buy? If it helps, I was 34C pre-pregnancy (I'm doubting I'll get down to that while nursing, but it would definitely be nice to) and now at 31 weeks I'm a 34DD.      Thanks so much for any help.

Some members of my family (not me) used to think my sister picked up her kids too much when they would cry as babies.

20090203103617AATqYEk	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Did I overreact in the OBGYN Office?	Today is my Day off and the only day I can get My things done.   I do have sat and sundays off but my doctors are not open then..      Today I add an OBGYN appt. I showed up at 11:40 for my 12 oclock appt.   I walked in checked in and 20  minutes later they put me in a room.   I sat there for an hour...In the Background I could hear people talking about "Do I look fat". Family, kids etc....Great but no one came in and said anything to me.   Finally after an Hour of waiting, I went into the Wait room and Said,   I am sorry, But today is my only day off and I have been waiting for over an hour...The nurse then said, That will be 10 dollars.   Then she said, would you like to Reschedule..I said no, I will just go see my family Doctor.   Then I walked out of the office upset and then some Nurse asst came running after me and Said there probably was an emergency...   I said well I am really sorry, but I would of at least like to be informed.      I don't mind waiting, I Really don't. But at atleast I would of liked to of been told "sorry the doctor is late" Sorry there is an emergency...Something.       The doctor then called my on My phone and left a Message saying she was sorry..I understand. Doctors are in High demand, and some patients take longer. It's not her fault but the other staff could of said something besides keeping me locked in the room for an hour.      I guess for me, I have been TTC and I was really nervous over what today's results would say.....Waiting for 3 years to Become a Parents..sitting in the room seemed like Hours.      This afternoon, I have another Doc's appt with My family Physician.   Baby Dust to all.

I'm guessing most of the other classes had their doors closed. It was totally quiet in our class. All of a sudden in the hallway, we just hear this sexual moan.Everybody just looked up like "Whoa. What the heck was THAT?" and of course, people made jokes..

We *may* be going to "market" in July (its a home furnishing/gift show for business to meet other businesses and see their merchandise).

I know he won't be interested in much, but what's some fun places to go, that make it easy on families with babies?

My son is now getting into the wearing real clothing, but I hate the pants right against his skin, and the shirts never stay tucked in long enough, do they make a sleeveless type thin onsie? All the onsies I can find are thick which makes him overheat wearing a long sleeve shirt on top, and they all have t-shirt sleeves which keeps bunching up.      Do you mommies know where I can find these types of things? I also live in canada, so the only real stores I have close by are wal-mart, Zellers, children's place and sears.

20090203104759AAvN4jQ	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Fun Vacations to take when you have young children (say ages infant - 7 years old)?	They say when you have a kid your whole life changes....      So I guess that means vacations do too.      That will be the biggest adjustment for me.  Not being able to pick up and go on a trip on short notice or when ever we feel like it.      My favorite place to visit is New York City.  I love to take in the Broadway shows, but you can't really do that with a little kid with you.      We don't go to a lot of places that would be fun for kids.   I mean we love the Caribbean and we are planning on going to Europe soon.         We do like themeparks but you can't really do that with young kids either.  (They can't ride the good rides)         So what does that leave....the beach?      (We aren't the type just to sit around on a beach we like to be exploring the places we travel too)      So what kind of trips do you take when you have a small child.  Infant-7 years old lets say?

I have found out i am having a girl >^.^<   and It seems to me that she is awake from 6 in the afternoon until noon the next day. and by awake I mean she is moving around so much it JOLTS me. NON-STOP moving during that time. You don't even have to put ur hand on my belly to feel/see the movement.    I am in the H.A.N.D.S. program (which is for first time mothers) and she told me that she hasn't heard that, but that mabe the women she meets with just dont mention that.    Also I am super thin (5'8" 128lbs @ 5months)   I don't know if that's related, I'm guessing so. But ADHD Is on my mind. I don't care how my baby girl turns out, I was just concerned (I have a Doctors app. on monday, I WILL bring it up to her)

20090219200851AA1f01V	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	New baby, husband, and housework ...?	We had our first baby a month ago, and obviously since then the housework has gone to hell. Its quite messy. Not disgustingly so (im a clean freak, so i do vacuum a few times a week and do laundry etc) but its no where near as clean as it used to be.      This is causing some problems between me and hubby.      Before anyone jumps in beating down my poor husband, let me explain - he works like 16 hour days. He comes home, and (as he is also a clean freak) starts cleaning up - and i can see his viewpoint. He must think that i just sit around all day with baby... (im EBFing)      But im tired .. and baby is hungry all the time and doing housework really is the last thing on my mind. If i can shower and feed myself its an achievement!

20090203103011AAT2w45	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Should I tell him or keep it a secret?	My husband and I both raised children as single parents. When we decided to have a baby together we agreed to give this baby everything we couldn't provide for our other children. He takes this to the extreme. He refuses to buy anything for her that isn't name brand and if I do, he will go out and buy name brand things and toss out the generic when I am not looking.      Well, we both own our own businesses and while neither have really been effected by the economy yet, I am nervous that eventually they will. I have been trying to cut corners and save a little extra every month.       So, this being said... I recently switched the baby's formula to the generic store brand. She drinks Similac sensitive and we buy two of the large containers per week. They sell for $23 each. But, the other day when I was shopping I compared Similac with the store brand (it said right on the can "Compares to Similac Sensitive). There was absolutely no nutritional value difference. So, I bought the large can for $12. When I got home, I dumped some of it into the Similac jar that was only about 1/4 full. She has been drinking it for 5 days now and I have seen zero change in her.       So, my question is...should I tell my husband or just keep filling the Similac container with the generic formula? Or, should I just not switch formulas?

I've never been really comfortable taking medicine while pregnant, but it seems this cough wont go away! It goes away and comes back worse! Its been on and off for about 3 months. The only reason I called the Dr was because I was getting a sharp pain on my back right under my ribs on the left side everytime I coughed and I was getting worried.       My question is, has anyone on here taken Mucinex D while pregnant and everything was okay with the baby. I know the Dr knows what she is doing, but it still kinda freaks me out to take medicine. I would appreciate your input.

My husband (soon to be) said "No mommy doing a project" and put the baby gate up. Then she started yelling. I came to her and said "mommy is work quite" I put my fingers on her mouth. When i went back up she was jumping around and screaming again. My husband put her is time-out. She bite him! He did not say or do nothing just sat down. Then after time-out I heard them talk about her behavior. After that she started lying. She would say "I have to go potty!" The only bathroom is in the office upstairs where i was. My husband took her up there and she started talking to me. Dad said "go potty." I looked at him and told "she lied to you!" He asked if she really had to potty. The answer was NO! My husband took her back downstairs and spanked her 2 times. He lock her in the kitchen. That is where we put her in the kitchen and put the baby gate there where the door is. She finally started to behave. Did he handle this right?

20090219195554AAJFBd4	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	How would you say no?	I have the next 6 monthes off work (complicated situation). I am watching my sisters daughter (who is 3) a few days a week free of charge because I offered to. I love to spend time with my niece, and I want to get used to the idea of taking care of a child because I might want to me a mommy someday. It also helps my sister with the cost of daycare. I have nothing better to do the majority of the time so I am happy to care for her.      However, my SIL is tight on money right now so my husband (STUPIDLY!) suggested to her that I might be able to watch her 5 yr old son since Im home during the days watching my neice. She asked me if I could and offered to pay like $20 a week. Personally, $20 a week is not sh*t for money anyways, and thats not the real issue. The thing is, her son is not nearly as well behaved as my neice, I'm really not too fond of him to be honest. I love my neice a lot more because she is my real family. But I feel like I have no real good reason to say no, without sounding selfish. What should I do to avoid this?

My longest labor was my first 11hours but since then my labors have been around 2 hours with my last being 45 minutes and a code white meaning I dialated from 3 to 10 in about 20 minutes and surprised everyone when I deliverd while they were trying to put in the first IV and there wasn't a doctor in the room until the head was out which really freaked that young nurse =)       So my question is how soon do you think I'm going to deliver. I think I am having contractions and they seem to be regular around 5 to ten minutes apart but only last less then a minute or two and they are not very painful but they are making me not want to do much. Any guesses. When I deliver I will give the person who is closest to being right the best answer. This should be fun.       Any out there think I'm having a false alarm because the contractions aren't very painful and they are short. This could be too. Well go ahead and guess and let me know if you all have had similar experiences and perhaps what I should expect.

Okay, I'm a 17 year old girl (if that helps at all) and a just noticed this past week that I have been feeling a BURN in my stomach.      It feels like its all around the outside , and it has been off and on ever since last week.      I was told, many times, that I because I drink so many energy drinks ( RedBull, Monster, Jolt etc.) that I may be "ruining" (ulcers etc.) my stomach. So that was my first thought when I started feeling this, but I'm not sure, and I honestly don't want to alarm anyone if it's nothing.      Can anyone tell what this may be?

20090219200618AAuMUy5	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Do you think i'm overreacting?	My 16 year old daughter is planning to visit me and the family and all her friends this summer. She's been living with her dad for the past year in another state.   I feel that her real motive for coming back is to see her friends, because it sounds like she doesn't have many and never goes out where she lives now.    Until 6 months ago, I was a really bad mom - I was an alcoholic and was really neglectful the last few years.    My daughter reacted by doing this "emo" thing - she went to concerts constantly, spent nights with her friends, and experimented with drugs, cigarettes, and sex.    I know she's not using drugs anymore, and I really trust her on that - but when she talks about visiting she talks about how she's so excited to be out and about again. And how good it will be to have friends, be out of the house all the time, and to attend parties.    I told her none of that will be happening. I told her there won't be any concerts, parties, or hanging out with any of her old friends (who i've learned have done some distasteful things like drinking, partying, and experimenting with drugs) She freaked out and started crying, calling me evil and accused me of trying to make up for being a bad mom all those years.    She'll be 17 when she visits, and I don't know what I should do.    Should I be blissfully ignorant to my daughters doings as long as she's not abusing drugs or alcohol - or should I stick with my plan of having her to stay home and spending time with the family?    I don't know what to do.       What are your limits for what you let your kids go out and do at that age?

She's generally sweet and well behaved but she gets easily frustrated especially while doing homework and has an attitude and is nasty. I need an effective way to punish her. If I send her to her room, she reads a book, she likes books more than TV, so this isn't really a good punishment. If I put her in the corner she screams, talks, sings, gets up, kicks the wall, plays with whatever is in her reach. I tell her she needs to be quiet and that I'm adding an extra minute each time she's not. She tells me she'll stay there until her parents get home and when I tell her to come out she says, "I thought I was staying here til Daddy got home?" I'm stumped. Shes too smart. Anybody with similar issues? Any suggestions? I should mention her parents are not very consistent in punishing her, I'm guessing because they haven't found an effective method for time-outs. HELP!

However, the only things I have found on the subject focus on potty training autistic children who are 5 or older, or include methods that I can't use due to the fact that I have another son who isn't quite a year old yet. I have tried getting rid of the diapers and having him sit on the potty every ten minutes for about ten minutes, keeping a record of when he goes to the bathroom so I know the best time to take him to the potty, giving him toys and keeping his attention focused while he is on the potty so he will want to stay there....I am at a loss.

20090219203021AA4YvRK	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Does this sound like Labor?	This is my third baby but it's been 10 years since I was pregnant. I started having contractions earlier today pretty regularly every 45 minutes apart. About an hour ago they started coming every 10 minutes apart now they are coming every 3 or 4 minutes apart though they don't really hurt. Just a dull ache in my back and a headache. I'm 34 weeks. My stomach hurts alittle too like really bad gas pains only with out the gas. They started coming really close together right after my bath tonight. I have a doctors appointment early in the morning and I don't really want to go to the hospital too early but I also don't want to go to bed and wake up to have it be too late to get to the hospital in time. Does this sound like reason for alarm right now ... or does it sound like it can wait until tomorrow morning?
20090219203038AAksL1E	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	How soon does the pregnancy hormone show up on an at home pregnancy test?	Bear with me:       Ok, you may believe Im a slut and shouldn't have slept with two different people around the same time, I already know this, so that wont answer my question and will just waste your time if that's your answer, but those of you that can help that would be nice :)      I had sex on Feb. 2nd and had a missed period Feb. 11th.  I took an at home pregnancy test Feb. 15 that came out positive.  I know it takes a few days to actually conceive, so the conception date was probably at the end of the week.  Could there already be enough of the pregnancy hormone by the 15th to give a positive read?        I went to the doctor and they did an ultrasound, they couldn't see the pregnancy yet, so they said I was still really early.  This makes me think that I possibly did get pregnant fromthe sex I had on Feb. 2nd.        But I also had sex Jan 19th.  If I did get pregnant from the 19th they would probably have been able to see the fetus, right?         Confusing, I know!      (My periods are very irregular so I cant tell from ovulation date)

The situation is my friends daughter was touching another child at her daycare, one ,my son does not attend, and the teacher asked her where did u get this from and she responded my friend (which is my son) did it, so i got a call from my friend last nite about it, i asked my son about it and he promises that he didnt do that , i dont wanna be a naive mom and say oh no my son would never do that because they are 4 and curious and its definetly a possibility, but there is nothing going on at home that he would see or think that its okay, he does not watch sexual movies he is not allowed, and i just dont know how to approach the situatuaion, im also taking into consideration he might have not done anything at all because my friends daughter does not have any other playmates at all at home, maybe she got nervous and just said my sons name out of being scared but i could be wrong about that too!!

My son will be 9 months old on Tuesday and we are going to start introducing whole milk to him.  Before anyone says anything, I was advised by my health nurse that we can do this. And he hasn't had any adverse reactions to dairy as he has had yogurt and cheese for the last month.      My question is how did you go about starting with your baby?  Did you mix it with formula/breast milk, or just give a bottle of straight milk?  I am not replacing his formula with milk yet, just adding it in for an evening bottle until he is a year, or unless my doctor/nurse advises my otherwise.     Your advise and experience is appreciated.
20090219204751AADgamT	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	How many parents have dinner with their kids?	I mean all sit down to a family dinner every night? even if it is take out?      I heard a few years ago that this was a very important part of child growth, and that the effects of it is very rewarding.       We do have all of our meals togethr now, and I have found it to be very rewarding, we talk about our day, they talk about their day, and we get to discuss family issues as well.

20090219204352AAqKTv3	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	Survey for parents or nonparents?	Yes, I know this was already posted but I added some more questions.      How old would you let your daughter be when:   Start wearing make up- Light make up (lip gloss, mascara) 6th grade and gradually add a little each year until 9th then she can have a little bit more freedom as long as it was with in reasoning, i.e. nothing super dark or slutty.         Go to the mall/movies with a friend- 12/13      Have a boyfriend (not just a little see each other at school thing)- Probably 14 she could start going on day time dates to the mall or something, but nothing too serious.      First cell phone- When she was going to be going places without constant adult supervision, probably 12/13 like I said earlier in the survey when she would be allowed to go places with friends. Nothing too fancy though, just a basic one.      Internet privileges- 7/8 for games, but only sometimes. At 11 I would allow her to visit age appropriate websites and talk to her school friends online, but if I had even one problem with her online behavior her internet privilege would be taken away for a good while. At 13 she could sign up for more websites because that is the legal age for it, but I would somewhat supervise online activities.      Not have a set bed time- Well, I would start this when she went into High School, but if she would be staying up ridiculously late or having trouble getting up in the morning it would be back to an 11pm bedtime.      Piercings (anything besides 1 ear piercing)- Well, if she wanted a 2nd ear piercing I'd consider it at 12ish, anything more than that 15 but only within reasoning.      Dye hair- 14, and nothing crazy though.      Shave legs- The summer before she went into middle school.      Go to first sleep over-  6 or 7, or whenever she started asking and wouldn't want to come home in the middle of the night.      Stay home alone- I'd start this around 11 but only for short periods of time during the day, but gradually add more time and in the evening as she got used to staying home and could be responsible.      Go for  a walk or bike ride in the neighborhood- 9 but only with a friend and if she knew basic safety rules, never alone.         I put my answers, now you can put yours. I think it's an interesting survey.

20090219204828AArTUBN	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Do you think that there could be something more serious going on?	I am getting to be a little concerned with my 8 mth old daughter. I finished BFing her at about 6 1/2 months and started to supplement with formula at about 5 so she would make the transition smoothly. I have her on the Enfamil Gentlease which i think is awesome because she never spits up anymore and hardly has gas. But she is frequently constipated... which is starting to concern me. Her doctor doesn't seem to think it is anything to be concerned about but i do. Besides the fact of her being comfortable I am worried about her tearing or anal fissures. She pushes and strains herself so hard that all the veins in her head stick out.      I give her everything that i can think of to help her like Karo Syrup, juice, prunes and nothing helps. Shew pretty much has to work it herself.      What i am getting towards is does anyone think that she could have a problem with her intestines or something along those lines?      Thank you!
20090219204544AAZ3cdK	Pregnancy & Parenting;Toddler & Preschooler	When did your son realize mommy's parts are different from his and daddy's?	My son is 13 months old and seems to look at my part down there oddly, then go to touch it as if he does not understand why there's a missing piece. He typically takes a bath with daddy, so perhaps he is used to seeing that? What do you think?

20090219203843AAOaHfB	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	What should my 6 month old be eating?	I'm never sure if I'm feeding him correctly (Is it enough? Is he getting enough nutrition? Am I overfeeding?)      6am: 7 ounce bottle   10am: 5 ounce bottle, 1/2 jar fruit with rice cereal   1:00pm: 5 ounce bottle, 1/2 jar fruit with rice cereal   4:00pm: 5 ounce bottle, 1/2 jar fruit with rice cereal   7:30pm: 7 ounce bottle   10:00pm: 6 ounce bottle      So that's about 35 ounces of milk a day, plus about 2 jars of fruit (or sometimes veggies) and rice cereal.      He's growing great. His weight, energy level and amount of dirty/wet diapers are all ok too. But, I'm not sure if I'm doing this right! Please give me your thoughts.
20090219204453AA4Eg7Z	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	How many kids do you want?	my mom asked me this the other day, and when i told her she freaked at me! I don't get why...?   I told her I wanted 3 or 4 kids, maybe more, because I've always wanted a big family. No one in my family has had more than 2 kids, so she finds it weird.   What about you?    How many kids do you want, and what will your parents say about it?

Please share your experiences, i'd love to hear them.

20090219203406AAIfhZ5	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	How soon after conception does the pregnancy hormone show up on an at home pregnancy test?	Bear with me:       Ok, you may believe Im a slut and shouldn't have slept with two different people around the same time, I already know this, so that wont answer my question and will just waste your time if that's your answer, but those of you that can help that would be nice :)      I had sex on Feb. 2nd and had a missed period Feb. 11th. I took an at home pregnancy test Feb. 15 that came out positive. I know it takes a few days to actually conceive, so the conception date was probably at the end of the week. Could there already be enough of the pregnancy hormone by the 15th to give a positive read?       I went to the doctor and they did an ultrasound, they couldn't see the pregnancy yet, so they said I was still really early. This makes me think that I possibly did get pregnant from thee sex I had on Feb. 2nd.       But I also had sex Jan 19th. If I did get pregnant from the 19th they would probably have been able to see the fetus, right?         Confusing, I know!

20090219205025AAmQc6F	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	What's the best way to take my infant & 4 year old on long walks?	I'm having a baby in May and like to go on long walks for exercise but I'm not sure what kind of stroller would be best.  I looked at the Sit N Stand strollers but the baby will be too small to put in the front while my four year old will be just getting to the 40 pound max mark for the seat in the back.  My toddler likes to walk but I can't expect her to go for miles!   Anyone have any suggestions so I can get some exercise while the weather is nice??
