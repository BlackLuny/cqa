wODTbUEhaa	I was nominated too! Mine was for medicine too, I just got it in the mail yesterday. Its a good program, I asked my teachers about it and only the top 1% of high scoring high school students get nominated, and they DO have scholarships, but i have no idea how you're supposed to get them. Im gonna try to go to the one in Los Angeles, so maybe we'll meet up! haha but just read through the papers a few times, look at the site, and ask teachers and people about it. A few kids from my school got nominated ( only 2 lol ) so the teachers know a little about the program. Its been around since 1993 and I did a little research. And you don't have to take the PSAT or ACT, because I took something that had nothing to do with this, but I guess I checked a box that said let colleges & other programs see my scores ( which im really glad I did, because at first I was thinking that I didnt want to check the box ) so I guess thats how you get nominated. I dont know if there's a specific test for this though.<br>  But I also dont know if the tests you take that get you nominated depend on your grade.. Im in 9th grade and the only test I can remember taking is something called the EXPLORE test, and I guess they got my scores from there. <br>  <br>  But its a lot of money for 10 days.. My mom is in nursing, so she REALLY wants me to do this lol. So if you have the money, you should really do it. It would look good on college things and for jobs too, because I'm guessing its a really high ranking program, or something like that.. They had me when I saw the gold seal on the letter. lol<br>  <br>  Sooo, all that stuff I just said basically means = GO! ITS GOOD FOR YOU! lol<br>  <br>  And if you don't have it, here's the site : <a href="http://www.nylf.org/med/index.cfm" rel="nofollow">http://www.nylf.org/med/index.cfm</a> <br>  <br>  Hope This Helped!<br>  ~iLoveGaara?|`|ZTumTZ5baa	I got a letter yesterday too! I was almost certain it was a scam but I asked my school dean today about it and she said that her daughter went to it and learned a lot. She said it does look good on college applications, not so sure about resumes. Also, do you remember filling out a paper that asked about college choices and career choices? If you had put anything about medicine in it, that might be what got you chosen. It's weird though because i put 2 music colleges and 1 veterinary school, but whatever.
xrKWtmYmaa	I tried to reconcile your numbers.  If you generate 380 watts = .38 kilowatts, and that is good for only 3.3 hours/day, then you get what you wrote:<br>  1.256 kilowatt-hour (NOT kilowatt/hr) which I'm assuming is the power generated on an average day.<br>  <br>  You can treat dimensions just the way you do any other algebraic expression, so <br>  1.256 kwh/day * 365 days/yr * .1048 dollars/kwh = dollars/yr<br>  <br>  Note that kwh in numerator & denominator cancel each other out.  Similarly with days.  So you are left with dollars per year -- just what you wanted.|`|62d7f6ae9c7c01061f3fa6d679c1f485aa	I would suggest this: Think of a watt as 1 watt-hour divided by 1 hour.<br>  <br>  therefore, 380 watts = 0.38 kilowatts = 0.380 (kilowatt-hour)/hour.<br>  <br>  that is, the watts generated equals 0.38 kilowatt-hour per hour.<br>  <br>  Now, there are 24 x 365 hours in a year. That is, 8760 hours/year.<br>  <br>  Therefore, power generated in a year is 0.38 kW-hour/hour x 8760 hours/year.<br>  That is, 3328.8 kilowatt-hour / year.<br>  <br>  At the rate of 0.1048 $/kilowatt-hour, the savings come to 348.9 $/year.<br>  <br>  Hope that is what you were looking for. I would suggest that you clear up any confusion between watts and watt-hours. Watt is the unit of power, that is, the amount of energy spent/generated per unit time. Watt-hour and kilowatt-hour are just units of energy. Another way to think of this is that, if energy can be compared to the distance a person walks, then power is the speed at which he walks.

Atoms such as sodium will have positive charge on top of the partial positive charge. SO, sodium chloride will have both ionic bonds plus van der waals

zf8BnU6Yaa	You will get a better understanding of the science in engineering college. With a certificate in the tech area you will miss out on some of these things and may have to pick them up later.  The problem is that you may design something which won't work because you didn't understand the fundamentals of how things work.  Also, new forms of transportation are usually modifications of existing designs so don't expect to have a brilliant idea that is not something like an existing design.  Your job prospects will be a little better with a network of other engineers who you have gone to college with, but technicians have similar resources.  How much effort are you willing to put into education versus training?  There are things like model laws relating to thermodynamics, fluid mechanics, aerodynamics, and other fields which you won't learn about in tech school.

AA11085356	It's easier for them to treat you if they personally kno your history.

Just as one person noted, you create a history with the doctor and they learn what treatments work better for you, how you react to certain medicines etc. The doctor is trying to figure out what treatment is best for you and it complicates things when he has to figure out your entire medical history as well.|`|D3agflP1aa	becuz <br>  1.they no everything about ur health history<br>  2. they r usually nicer becuz they no u<br>  3.its easier becuz u dont have to explain everything to them about ur health|`|NIUkYdL2aa	So you can trust him and feel more comfortable with him and so that he knows your health history.|`|499b2674aceaca4224f1e97ffb73d7f7aa	it's important to be registered with a gp so you can access health care when you need to.|`|AA0MuMt3aa	Some people might feel insecure with many doctors, and it's better to have your own doctor because then they know your history better, and you develop a much more confidential and closer relationship with them. Also, doctors tend to care about their patients so if you switch between doctors they can get annoyed.<br>  Any doctor you go to can have access to your history, but it's better to have a single doctor because they will have seen it firsthand and know you better.<br>  However, more than one doctors opinion is always good too, just don't overdo it.|`|v2Awgh9Xaa	It's important to have a family/general practitioner that you are comfortable with and know well for many many reasons. Perhaps the most important reason is that as one person treats you (or just gives you a check-up, well-visit, what ever you want to call it), they get to know you and your body. Putting it that way might sound 'creepy,' but if you have a good patient/Dr. relationship and a good rapport, signs, symptoms, and other things that are abnormal for you as an individual maybe easier to identify for your doctor.<br>  <br>  Think of it this way: You get really sick and go to the emergency room, and you get treated for a stomach virus and dehydration, but you don't have a family Dr., where is that information going to go? Maybe in your hospital record and to your insurance (if you have it). <br>  Then imagine that you end up in the closest ER a hand full of times in the next few months with similar symptoms.Each time you go, you have to reiterate your symptoms, family history, past health problems, medications, etc. to a Dr. you just met who needs to help you in the here and now. If you have a general practitioner/family Dr., your information should be collected in your patient file and your family Dr., who has seen you on a number of occasions, knows your health history and family history, can take the info from your ER visits as well as the info you bring to your office visit to look for patterns over a long period of time and attempt to treat you OR refer you to an appropriate specialist if needed.<br>  <br>  I know that was long... sorry... i was just trying to paint you a good picture.

RxukJqL5aa	Algebraically, an isomorphism is just a function that shows that two structures are "essentially the same".  That is, the only thing that is different is the symbols used.<br>  <br>  If we met some alien race and found they had the following mathematical structure:<br>  <br>  A ^ A = A<br>  A ^ B = B<br>  A ^ C = C<br>  B ^ A = B<br>  B ^ B = C<br>  B ^ C = D<br>  and so on...<br>  <br>  We can note that by replacing ^ with +, A with 0, B with 1, C with 2, D with 3, etc., we get<br>  0 + 0 = 0<br>  0 + 1 = 1<br>  0 + 2 = 2<br>  1 + 0 = 1<br>  1 + 1 = 2<br>  1 + 2 = 3<br>  <br>  so even though we were using all different symbols, the actual structure seems to be the same as simple addition with the natural numbers.<br>  <br>  An isomorphism is the way algebraists prove this type of claim.  By showing that two structures are isomorphic, we can treat them as if they were exactly the same (algebraically, anyway).<br>  <br>  -----------<br>  <br>  For a nontrivial example, consider the positive real numbers with the operation of multiplication and the real numbers with the operation of addition.<br>  Unless you have a really good intuition, these two seem quite different; however, they are exactly the same, in a sense.<br>  <br>  Define f(x) = e^x.  Then the domain of the function is the real numbers and the range is the positive real numbers.  We can also see that f(x) is one-to-one, so it is a bijection.<br>  <br>  Now,<br>  f(x) * f(y) = e^x * e^y = e^(x+y) = f(x+y)<br>  <br>  That is, any sum of two real numbers in the domain corresponds to the product of two positive real numbers in the range.  This shows that, algebraically, multiplication of positive real numbers and addition of real numbers _exhibit the same structure_.  In other words, they are isomorphic.<br>  <br>  The function f(x) above is the actual isomorphism, which shows the structures are isomorphic.|`|BsQsCNoMaa	Well, the prefix iso- means, one or the same, and morphic means form or shape, so if two things are isomorphic, it means that they have identical shape of structure. In Chemistry this means that two compounds have the same structure. This mostly refers to crystalline structures. In math it means that two functions or equations have the same form.|`|o91grX4zaa	Isomorphism means different things in different contexts. For example, you could be talking about isomorphisms between groups (as in group theory), between graphs etc. But the common idea is that an isomorphism is a bijective mapping from a set A to a set B that relates the algebraic structures of A and B.<br>  <br>  For instance, if A is the set of real numbers with the usual + plus operation and B is the set of positive real numbers with the usual * multiply operation, we can define an isomorphism from A to B via the exponential function F(x) = e^x, x in A and F(x) in B such that if a1 and a2 in A then their sum x1+x2 gets mapped to the product e^(a1)*e^(a2) = e^(a1+a2). This shows that summing two elements in A is essentially the same as multiplying their exponential counterparts in B.|`|bN6qFzWpaa	To check out the answer to this problem go to www.math.csusb.edu/notes/advanced/algebr...

Lj2quNrpaa	no, genes are in our chromosomes, which are in our DNA, which never changes throughout our lives. In fact, there is not a certain point in your body where you're genes are held, every single cell in your body holds a copy of all of your genes. when you make a new cell, (which is happening constantly) your genes duplicate. soooo, each of your parents give you a duplicated set of their genes, and they combine to become yours.

b393c2b525c5ce1c73fd14c81fbc2090aa	Antibodies (also known as immunoglobulins)  are gamma globulin proteins that are found in blood or other bodily fluids of vertebrates, and are used by the immune system to identify and neutralize foreign objects, such as bacteria and viruses. They are typically made of basic structural units—each with two large heavy chains and two small light chains—to form, for example, monomers with one unit, dimers with two units or pentamers with five units. Antibodies are produced by a kind of white blood cell called a B cell. There are several different types of antibody heavy chains, and several different kinds of antibodies, which are grouped into different isotypes based on which heavy chain they possess. Five different antibody isotypes are known in mammals, which perform different roles, and help direct the appropriate immune response for each different type of foreign object they encounter.|`|78j8yySpaa	Antibodies are something that your body sends out when your body is being attacked by a sickness and the antibodies are there to destroy the bacteria that's making you sick|`|MRwj40TBaa	Antibodies are like memory cells that your body uses to fight off foreign invaders in your body.

Ftkr9jqYaa	Monoclonal antibodies (mAb or moAb) are monospecific antibodies that are identical because they are produced by one type of immune cell that are all clones of a single parent cell. Given (almost) any substance, it is possible to create monoclonal antibodies that specifically bind to that substance; they can then serve to detect or purify that substance. This has become an important tool in biochemistry, molecular biology and medicine.<br>  <br>  Monoclonal antibody therapy is the use of monoclonal antibodies (or mAb) to specifically target cells. The main objective is stimulating the patient's immune system to attack malignant tumor cells and the prevention of tumor growth by blocking specific cell receptors.<br>  <br>  Immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies are large heterodimeric molecules, approximately 150 kDa, and are composed of two different kinds of polypeptide chain, called the heavy (~50kDa) and the light chain (~25kDa). There are two types of light chains, kappa (κ) and lambda (λ).  There are four known IgG subclasses, all of which are involved in Antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity.<br>  <br>  The immune system responds to the environmental factors it encounters on the basis of discrimination between self and non-self. Tumor cells are not specifically targeted by one's immune system, since tumor cells are the patient's own cells. Tumor cells, however, are highly abnormal, and many display unusual antigens that are either inappropriate for the cell type, its environment, or are only normally present during the organisms' development (e.g. fetal antigens).

Ftkr9jqYaa	According to the Janzen-Connell Hypothesis, maintenance of biodiversity in forest communities is the result of two mechanisms: (1) Mortality of seeds and seedlings increases as seed/seedling density increases, and (2) survival of seeds and seedlings increases as distance from the parent tree increases. These two mechanisms are chiefly driven by the predation of natural enemies, particularly herbivores, insects, and pathogens, on seeds and seedlings. Density-responsive and distance-responsive predation on seeds and seedlings promotes regular spacing of species and creates opportunity for colonization by other species, thus enhancing forest diversity.  Migration, in the form of seed dispersal away from parent communities, is important to speciation and evolution.  For example, <br>  <br>  For example, Janzen's escape hypothesis is supported by the migration of Dipteryx panamensis, a Costa Rican tree, which shows 100% mortality within a 7-20 month period if migration from the parent tree is 8 meters or less.  For Virola nobilis, migration reduces predation by Curculionidae weevils and Nitidulidae bark beetles.  In Chlorocardium rodiei, a Guyan tree, those individuals that are dispersed most distantly from the parent tree tend to be less subject to infestation by beetles.  Thus, migration benefits these tree species, who tend to evolve in whatever ways tend to enhance seed dispersal, such as:  (1) Greater aerodynamic ability of seedlings to sustain longer flight, and (2) ability of seeds to attach to coat hairs of mammals, who inadvertently carry them long distances.<br>  <br>  Since prehistoric times, humans have exploited certain anadromous fishes during their migrations into freshwater streams, when they are more vulnerable to capture. Societies dating to the Millingstone Horizon are known which exploited the anadromous fishery of Morro Creek and other Pacific coast estuaries. In Nevada, the Paiute tribe has harvested migrating Lahontan cutthroat trout along the Truckee River since prehistoric times. This fishing practice continues to current times, and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency? has supported research to assure the water quality in the Truckee can support suitable populations of the Lahontan cutthroat trout.<br>  <br>  Seed dispersal has many consequences for the ecology and evolution of plants. Dispersal is necessary for species migrations, and in recent times dispersal ability is an important factor in whether or not a species transported to a new habitat by humans will become an invasive species. Dispersal is also predicted to play a major role in the maintenance of species diversity. Dispersal of seeds away from the parent organism has a central role in two major theories for how biodiversity is maintained in natural ecosystems, the Janzen-Connell hypothesis and recruitment limitation.

A million times I've seen the doctor scratch his head and say "I don't know", or tell me or one of my family members some outlandish thing that never pans out. Once I started doing my own research, I can almost always figure it out prior to going to the doctor, and they tend to agree with me on the diagnosis. If I can't figure out the answer, the doctor inevitably doesn't know either. I hope I don't sound conceited, it's just what I've noticed having five kids, and keeping them healthy. Finally I found a good doctor, an older man who still has an old-school way of taking care of people. He doesn't prescribe much, and that gives me a lot of respect for him. Five years ago a different doctor told my husband that the chronic open wound on his finger was a flesh eating disease, there was nothing he could do about it, and my husband would have it for the rest of his life.

RxukJqL5aa	First off, the antiderivative of 1/x is actually ln|x|, so we can't merely argue that -1 doesn't work as an input (Sorry, John), nor does Euler's equation apply (Sorry, deighton).<br>  <br>  It does diverge, however.  The issue is that it would actually be equal to:<br>  lim(ln|x|) - lim(ln|x|)<br>  where x->0 on each limit.<br>  <br>  Now, if we were able to combine the limits, then it would of course be zero; however, neither of the limits is finite, so we can't combine them.  We actually end up with something like<br>  infinity minus infinity<br>  which is senseless as an expression.<br>  <br>  The reason we can't combine the limits is shown as follows... first assume that we can combine limits when written like I have them above.  Then we have<br>  0 = lim(ln|x| - ln|x|)<br>   = lim(ln|x|) - lim(ln|x|)<br>   = lim(ln|e*x|) - lim(ln|x|)<br>   = lim(1 + ln|x|) - lim(ln|x|)<br>   = lim(1 + ln|x| - ln|x| )<br>   = lim(1)<br>   = 1<br>  <br>  -----------<br>  <br>  As a much simpler example of the same issue, consider<br>  ∫ 2x dx from negative infinity to positive infinity.<br>   = lim(A->infinity) (A^2) - lim(B-> negative infinity) (B^2).<br>  <br>  Note that the two limits have different "variables" - this is the essence of what is happening in your problem.  We can't just assume that both are approaching their limits "at the same rate" (or whatever that would mean), so we do end up with something similar to an indeterminate form.  <br>  There is a way of analyzing this situation, but to do so, we have to tweak what the integral really means a little.|`|txC0p30daa	It's divergent because the integral of (1/x) is ln(x) and you can't take ln(-1).<br>  <br>  And no, it's like saying that lim x ->1 (1/x) is defined because 1/1 = 1, but lim x-> 0 isn't because 1/0 is an indeterminate form.<br>  <br>  [Edit: The fact that the integral of 1/x is ln(|x|) and not ln(x) really ISN'T the point, since it doesn't make a difference in them problem anyway.  Just by looking at a graph of the function, you should be able to see that it's not 0.]|`|r2gybx5haa	integral of 1/x is ln(x)  . As x goes to zero, ln(x) goes to -infinity.

92f97d29e3d55f3219cc25dfabd347c7aa	The equivalence of mass and energy is actually a consequence of special relativity.<br>  <br>  General relativity is the relativistic theory of gravity.  It starts with the assumption that the force you experience in an accelerating reference frame is equivalent to gravity (and the assumptions of special relativity) and works out the consequences.<br>  <br>  One consequences is that clocks in a gravitational potential well run slow.  Another is that the effects of gravity can be modeled as a curvature of space/time itself.<br>  <br>  Go wiki general relativity for a good read.|`|AA10729271	Well basically, the theory is a description of spacetime.

I never did learn enough to understand General Relativity.<br>  <br>  The difference between Special and General is that Special applies only to measurements made by two observers who are in constant velocity, (not accelerated) motion with respect to each other.<br>  <br>  General theory deals with accelerated motion and says gravity and acceleration cannot be told apart.<br>  As I understand, GR requires Math called "Tensor Analysis" which is way over my head. It uses quantities called "curvature of space".  It assumes that Time and Space are both parts of Space-Time in which the universe is measured.<br>  <br>  (Told you its not easy!)<br>  <br>  In Special Relativity:<br>  Since Observers  are moving the only way they can measure an object outside themselves is with light.  Light has a constant speed "C".<br>  <br>  The really strange thing about the universe is that everybody, no matter how they are moving, measures C having the same value.  That goes against all common sense but Experiments and Theory have shown it to be true.<br>  <br>  Einstein tried to find equations that made C constant, but it required that the values of x,y,z in space, and t in time would vary depending on the observer.<br>  <br>  People who study math and physics (almost) all agree Einstein was right.<br>  <br>  Einstein's E=MC^2 was a conclusion of his Special Relativity, and guess what? Atom Bombs really do explode.<br>  <br>  The Big Bang theory is based on observations of stars by Edwin Hubble, an astronomer in the 1920's who discovered that all the distant galaxies seemed to be moving away from earth,  that meant in the past they were closer.  In the far past (calculated at about 14 Billion years) everything in the universe was packed together in a hot dense mass no bigger than a part of an atom.<br>  Nobody can imagine that, but the equations of physics say it must have been so.  Before that, Time and Space have no meaning.

PkGROcYqaa	Since I do not have a picture of the gel, it is difficult to answer your questions. But I can offer you some answers:<br>  1.) Band intensity is based on how much EtBr interculates itself within the DNA. The more the binding, the more DNA you have.<br>  Also the larger the DNA fragment, the more EtBr wil bind to the DNA molecule and hence a brighter band.<br>  2.) Increase the concentration of the gel. This will allow you to separate closely sized DNA fragments.<br>  good luck.

q1QyM0Kzaa	First, there is the evolutionary part - humans started out in areas where there were spiders that could do you a nasty. Same with snakes - most English people are terrified of snakes, despite the fact that the only venomous snake naturally occurring in england could just about kill a four year old or an OAP's grandfather. <br>  <br>  Humans also naturally want to kill everything unfamiliar. One of the reasons that a heck of a lot of animals that were around at the time of our grandparents aren't around now, from various frogs and pigeons to... um... well, animals that we don't consider pests. Or wouldn't if they weren't already gone. I find that knowing that I am predispositioned not to like something makes me want to overcome that all the more. <br>  <br>  Then, the horror stories. Because there are a lot of poisonous spiders in the world, the media and rumours use them as fuel, often misreporting how dangerous a spider actually is. My uncle stopped me showering for several weeks because he told me, quite truthfully, that the brown button spider is at least as poisonous as the black widow. What he failed to mention was that it can only bite you if it gets up your nose or to the softest parts of your privates, and even then that it can doesn't mean it would, but even when I knew that, I remembered that someone has to be that one in a million. <br>  <br>  Then there's the true stories of real nasties, like an almost microscopic spider that killed several people in south africa from it's hiding place in a toilet seat. With increased air traffic, spiders like these spread easily around the world, and this REALLY isn't helping, is it?<br>  <br>  They also have too many legs. And, like snakes, they're scariest when they panic, and normally that's when they're closest to you, which does neither of you very much good. That said, if a spider that fell on me decided to take a leisurely wander across my face, I'd probably be more scared than when they run in a mad frenzied terror. <br>  <br>  HOWEVER!!! These might help you (and future possible smears on the wall)<br>  <br>  1) not everyone swallows spiders in their sleep. It is a statistic, not a true "fact", and as such, based on averages, so some people swallow more, and some swallow less, and a lucky few swallow none. I sleep with my mouth shut, and hope I'm part of the none. How did they even get results for that, though? did they film people sleeping and watch spiders going into their mouths? <br>  <br>  2) As scary as a lot of spiders may be, I find it helps to take pictures of them, blow those up, and look at them. While you might not find anything particularly amicable about them, if you've got a steady hand, you'll see how truly wierd they are, and get a little more interested. As such, although I scream like a girl and jump onto a chair when I see an unfamiliar spider, or worse a sun-spider (not actually a spider, a solpugid, and thus EVIL), I am now somewhat more interested in them, which means that once they are trapped, I can stare at them and go "ooh, AAAAARGH" rather than just the latter.<br>  <br>  3) Roald Dahl clearly states, in james and the giant peach, that it's bad luck to kill a spider. While you seem to get around that by getting other people to do it, I, being unintenionally superstitious, am now even more terrified to kill them than not.<br>  <br>  4) most spiders across the world are not designed to eat vertebrates. As such, even a lot of the larger spiders, which might hurt if they did bite, do not cause any serious trouble if they did. the ones to look out for are the bird eating spiders, and spiders whose habits make them vulnerable to attack by predators. Most of the second group are more dangerous when freshly squished than when alive, the main thing to avoid is rubbing them into open wounds or eating them.<br>  <br>  This has gone somewhat off topic, so I'll wrap it up now.<br>  <br>  EDIT - person who thinks that spraying to get rid of spiders is responsible:<br>  <br>  Spiders play a VERY important role in ecology, and help to keep more harmful wildlife, such as mosquitoes, to a minimum, so please think twice before embarking on a crusade against them. Also, they're eukaryotic, which means that most chemicals that harm them, harm us, if to a varying degree, no matter what it says on the bottle.|`|ycbkzprjaa	You are not alone. I believe that 90% of humans hate spiders. I think it's from evolution. We hate anything that moves but doesn't make a sound, thus we don't exactly know what it is or what its intentions are. You might say it is the basic fear of the unknown. I must also say that all spiders are venomous. It's the quantity and toxicity of the venom that could kill you or just give you an itchy spider bite, the kind you get during the night. If you have an infestation of spiders (many houses have this problem), try spraying the cracks, seams, window sills, and door frames with the proper "spidercide". That should do the trick.

bBMKMd97aa	IM SAYING TELESCOPICALLY|`|8xBS8w4Baa	Cellular respiration refers to the process of converting the chemical energy of organic molecules into a form immediately usable by organisms. Glucose may be oxidized completely if sufficient oxygen is available:<br>  <br>  C6H12O6 + 6O2(g) ? 6 H2O + 6 CO2(g) + energy<br>  <br>  All organisms, including plants and animals, oxidize glucose for energy.  This energy is used to convert ADP and phosphate into ATP.<br>  There are many ways to measure cellular respiration experimentally using various Vernier probes.  The Respiration Monitor Belt coupled with a pressure sensor can be used measure the rate of respiration in people. Finally, the pressure sensor can be used alone to look at the rate of formation of oxygen gas over time. It is not possible to directly measure pressure changes due to oxygen, since the pressure sensor measures the total pressure change. Carbon dioxide is produced as oxygen is consumed. The pressure due to CO2 might cancel out any change due to the consumption of oxygen. To eliminate this problem, a chemical may be added that will selectively remove CO2. Potassium hydroxide, KO, will  chemically react with CO2:<br>  <br>  2 KO + CO2 ? K2CO3 + H2O<br>  <br>  Organisms you may use are people (using the respiration monitor belt), peas (using the CO2 sensor, O2 sensor, or pressure sensor), or yeast (using the CO2 sensor, O2 sensor.  The pressure sensor will only work if you wait for the yeast to consume all the oxygen and begin respiring anaerobically.).<br>  <br>  You may choose any variable that may affect the rate of cellular respiration.  Remember, all the reactions that make up cellular respiration are mediated by enzymes; therefore, any factor that affects enzyme behavior will affect rate of cellular respiration.  As a class, you will brainstorm to think of at least 3 variables that may be tested.

Since it grows in temperatures approaching boiling, it is considered to be a thermophile. Nanoarchaeum appears to be an obligatory symbiont on the archaeon Ignicoccus; it must be in contact with the host organism to survive. Its cells are only 400 nm in diameter, making it the next smallest known living organism.
Tiph3lQcaa	Albedo is a measure of a planet's brightness based on reflected light. If the earth were totally covered with clouds, its albedo would be higher because it would reflect more light from the white cloud tops than from the surface itself or the oceans. With more light reflecting from the clouds, you might think that the surface would be cooler. But in fact the surface would probably be much warmer. Venus is a good example.

In this case, the titration is a strong base and a weak acid. Since the HOCl is a weak acid, its conjugate base is strong. So, at the equivalence point, the final solution is the same as adding -OCl, which is a strong base. Therefore, pH is above 7. Another way to think of this is at pH 7, the weak acid has not been fully dissociated yet. This will happen only at higher pH.<br>  (iii) The easiest way to do buffer problems is with the Henderson - Hasselbalch equation:<br>  pH = pKa + log (A/AH), where AH and A are concentrations/moles of weak acid and conjugate base, respectively.<br>  AH = (125 mL) (0.160 mmol/mL) = 20 mmole. Substituting,<br>  -log(5x10^-9) = -log(2.3x10^9) + log (A / 20 mmoles). Solving,<br>  A = 9.35 mmoles, or 0.0935 moles of NaOBr.

The AVN node located in the left atrium send signals to the SAN node in the septum (middle muscle area of heart) which keeps sending currents to the bundle of His, and to the purkyne fibres which control the heart beat and how the blood is pumped from one chamber to anothe, so all in all this cannot be possible unless any of these are not functioning properly. but i guess if this was possible, then the heart cycle would come to a hold adn blood would pass, the human wouldnt breathe and soon die as oxygen is not bein passed to its cells<br>  <br>  <br>  hope this helps :)|`|aSvOaAjiaa	it can't be because it has emptied on the previous cycle<br>  <br>  Edit :thinking about it that is what is in effect happening in C.C.F.

lxouDjtqaa	1. If I sold 5 mountain bikes and 3 street, how much profit did I make? When you figured that out, you are used a formula. This is a very simple formula, the number of mountains bikes sold, times the profit on each bike plus the number of street bikes sold times the profit on each street bike.<br>  <br>  2. Well, $100 is better than $70, so what if they bought all the mountain bikes they could and sold them? 4800/300 = 16, a profit of $1600. But Street bikes make 70/200 profit and mountain 100/300. So, on $600, three street bikes would make $210, while two mountain bikes would only make $200. So what if they bought all street bikes, 20 * 200 = 4000 and 20 * 70 = 1400, so only $1400.<br>  <br>  Maybe a combination or both, since the mountain bikes don't use all the slots, but the street bikes don't use all the inventory money.
X0e6p9Ilaa	By "clear", I assume you mean colorless.   But that isn't quite the case.  We call a solution without color "colorless".  We call a solution that you can easily see through (regardless of the color) "clear".<br>  <br>  For instance, water is a clear, colorless solution.<br>  A solution of copper (II) sulfate is clear and blue.<br>  A solution containing solid copper (II) hydroxide is blue, but it's not clear, because you can't see through it.<br>  <br>  And no.  I don't know of any simple, harmless, clear, colorless solutions that will turn blue if mixed.  How about if one is yellow?<br>  <br>  You could combine some acid (to which you've added a few drops of bromthymol blue indicator, which will be yellow),  with an excess of NaOH, which is colorless.  The NaOH will neutralize the acid and the solution will turn blue.  Bromthymol blue indicator is blue in a base.<br>  <br>  It's much easier if you want pink or red.  Put a few drops of phenolphthalein indicator in some acid and then mix it with an excess of NaOH.  The base neutralizes the acid and the resulting solution will turn pink (or red, depending on the amount of indicator) since phenophthalein is pink in a base.<br>  <br>  There are lots of other acid/base indicators that you can play with assuming you've got an acid and a base.  For the acid you can use white vinegar, which is acetic acid, and a little Drano, which is sodium hydroxide, as the base.  Obviously you will want to be very careful with both.
bHPB2CuUaa	It's hotter in the summer because there is more sun. You are right that the earth's orbit is elliptical, but we're actually closer to the sun in the winter in the northern hemisphere. Excellent observation about it being summer in australia when it is winter in the US. The real reason that there is more sun in the summer is because the earth's spin axis is tilted 23 degrees with respect the the plane in which the earth orbits the sun. So during parts of the orbit where the northern hemisphere is pointing towards the sun, there are longer days than nights; in fact, at the north pole the sun never sets, it just goes around in a circle. Opposite case in the southern hemisphere - in the middle of northern hemisphere summer, the southern hemisphere experiences shorter days and has winter; at the south pole the sun never even rises. But as the earth orbits, the situation is reversed six months later and the southern hemisphere has summer, and the northern winter. There are some good animations on the web: if you look, you shall find.|`|aKqvvnoZaa	I assume your not very old. This is something simple they teach in school.<br>  <br>  The earth is tilted, like a top. When it's summer up north, the tilt is towards the sun, so it's closer and thus warmer. The south is then farther away and thus colder.<br>  <br>  When 6 months pass, the earth is on the other side of the sun. The Earth is still facing the same way, but now the south side is closer and it is summer there. <br>  <br>  earth /  Sun  / earth|`|zq494E4Faa	because of the earth's angle on the axis, areas below the equator are farther or closer to the sun compared to areas above the equator at all times. this causes the difference in seasons. i hope this makes sense :)|`|92f97d29e3d55f3219cc25dfabd347c7aa	Yeah, that thing about Australia kind of kills your hypothesis.<br>  <br>  In fact, the seasons are caused by the tipping of the earth's axis of rotation with respect to the axis of its revolution about the sun.<br>  <br>  In December, the South pole is tipped towards the sun, so the southern hemisphere gets more daylight and the sun is more directly overhead.  In June, that's flipped around and the northern hemisphere gets summer.<br>  <br>  As it so happens, the earth's orbit is slightly elliptical, but not enough to have a major effect on the seasons.

XXyHd0AQaa	You are quite right, wavelength is trough to trough or crest to crest (or any consecutive points in the wave), and you do need wavelength to figure this out. The wavelength would be twice the length of the distance between the crest and trough so the wavelength would be 9 m (4.5 m x 2). A trough is half way between two crests so it makes sense that the wavelength would be twice the distance.<br>  <br>  Then you can use the formula<br>  Wave speed (m/s) = Frequency (Hz) x Wavelength (m) <br>  ( V = f λ )<br>  And rearrange it<br>  Frequency = Wave speed / Wavelength<br>  Not really sure why you have "16/2m/s" as the speed though, is it a typo?<br>  Well whatever it is, just plug the numbers into the formula and you will get your answer.|`|8YOE7VvLaa	a crest to a trough is half a wavelength, therefore the full wavelength is twice 4.5m, so that means the wavelength is 9m.

Hr9AfJwYaa	The nucleolus is INSIDE the nucleus. The nucleolus is the part of the nucleus containing most of the genes that code for the synthesis of ribosomal RNA (rRNA: the RNA molecules found in ribosomes). So rRNA is synthesized within the nucleolus. <br>  <br>  While still within the nucleolus, these rRNA molecules are assembled, together with many protein molecules, into two subunits of future ribosomes. The subunits leave the nucleus through pores in the nuclear membrane, and enter the cytoplasm. <br>  <br>  In the cytoplasm, the two ribosome subunits are brought together to form a functional ribosome at an early stage in translation, and separate again when the ribosome has fully translated a molecule of messenger RNA (mRNA).|`|B7086kktaa	the nucleolus is the part of the cell that controls the actions of the other parts of the cell.

cJPOs7Tsaa	Your question is so full of misconceptions that it is unanswerable.<br>  Firstly, the sun will not lose its gravitational pull.

KHSOVxViaa	The direct traces of agriculture are hard to read.  Most places where agriculture developed are still agricultural, and continued human activity tends to destroy traces of the past.<br>  <br>  It's often easier to find and examine sites which are no longer inhabited, such as where a once-fertile area dried up because of a river changing course.  The finds of implements and other traces will give clues, but it may not be easy to determine when agriculture began locally.<br>  <br>  Suppose agriculture began in a site in 1000BC, but the site was in use until 1000AD.  Most finds would be from the later era, and it might be hard to determine the earliest dates.  What traces of the early days would survive 2000 years of ploughing, building, rebuilding and erosion?  If it's that hard for an abandoned site, think how much more difficult for one still inhabited and worked.<br>  <br>  Hence the problem.|`|FLgDn3OTaa	Because crop rotation and ploughing stubble from the previous year's crop into the soil is a continuous process, so the origins would've needed incredibly fertile land. Farming has gone on as long as humans have been around so written and accurate records of it are few and far between.
AA11146651	Some companies pay their employees an hourly wage, like $10 per hour.  No matter how many Xboxes these employees sell, they are guaranteed to make $10 per hour.  <br>  <br>  Other companies pay their employees a commission, which is a percentage of the amount that they sell.  If it's a slow day and nobody comes in to buy, these employees might make very little money on that day.  However, if there are a lot of customers, the employees have a chance to make a lot more money.  <br>  <br>  So, if today an employee sold $80,000 worth of Xboxes and the commission is 4%, then that employee gets 4% of $80,000, which is the same as .04 x $80,000 = $3,200

G5QC5f5baa	A vector or even a sensorless vector VFD should be capable of operating a motor from base speed right down to or very nearly to zero speed at 150% of rated torque as calculated from the nameplate speed and power ratings. The current required to produce 150% of rated torque should not exceed 150% of the motor nameplate current. The minimum speed at which the motor can produce rated torque continuously and the maximum time that rated torque can be maintained at stall depends on the specific motor design, particularly the cooling provisions. Motors equipped with a separately powered cooling fan can typically sustain rated torque at zero speed continuously. Manufacturers of VFD rated motors usually have rating curves that show the motor torque vs. speed continuous and intermittent capability.

Obviously, neutral atoms by definition have the same number of protons as neutrons. But atoms try to obtain a perfect "octet" for their valence electrons. This means their outer energy level has eight electrons.<br>  One step further... The idea of an octet can provide a shortcut to writing out the orbital notation for the electrons. So, say, Potassium. Instead of being: 1s2, 2s2, 2p6, 3s2, 2p6, 4s1. It would be: [Ar] 4s1 for a neutral atom. Or for an ion, I think it would be: [Ar]+1.

In order to do this equation, we need to move all of the 'y' variable terms (the numbers with 'y') to one side of the equal sign, and the non-y's to the other side. <br>  <br>  Now, in order to do this, you must add subtract 4y from both sides of the equation. Why? Because, you need to take away 4y from the right side of the equation, don't you? To do this, you'll have to subtract 4y from that side. But remember, whatever you do to one side of the equation, you have to do to the other. This is why you subtract 4y from both sides.<br>  <br>  So, it'll look something like this:<br>  <br>  5y - 4y = 4y - 4y -1.1<br>  Since 5-4 is one, the answer on the left side will be 1y, or y, cuz you don't need to write the 1 when it's next to a letter.

Ftxnrusraa	What you need to do is say: "Let's assume its true for some number k (i.e. when n = k).

(expand this out and simplify)<br>  = ((k+1)^2(k+2)^2) / 4<br>  = ((k+1)^2((k+1)+1)^2) / 4, which is what we wanted :D<br>  <br>  So what this means, is that if this relationship is true for some number k, then it's also true for k+1 :).<br>  <br>  Now, let's try when n = 1 (this is known as the 'base case'):<br>  <br>  1^3 = 1, (1^2(1+1)^2) / 4 = 1. So the relationship holds when n = 1.<br>  <br>  But this means: if it's true for n = 1, then by what we worked out earlier, it must be true for n = 2, and then that means it's true for n = 3...and so on! So at this point you write "Hence, by mathematical induction, the relationship is true for all n (> 0)."<br>  <br>  Hope this helps :)|`|RrGcZuqyaa	Let the actual sum be S(n).

NIyyDwNVaa	A mutation is an alteration in the sequence of DNA that codes for a protein, or is a promoter region or somehow is a sequence that is very important in regulation of gene expression.<br>  <br>  By which I mean that some sequences ensure that RNA Polymerase binds to the correct spot. While other sequences are responsible for inhibiting RNA Polymerase.<br>  <br>  My guess to why most mutations are recessive is because most mutations are deleterious to the body. And those that are dominant would not survive and pass through to the next generation because the group that develops a mutation that is dominant would not survive.<br>  <br>  But a recessive mutation can pass through because a heterozygous individual (someone who is carrying the allele for the mutation) will live to reproduce and pass the recessive allele to the next generation.

NIyyDwNVaa	I wrote a research paper on the research for DNA.<br>  <br>  She did a lot but the most common answer is that she was able to create an accurate X-Ray structure of DNA which helped corroborate and prove that DNA was a double helix (two strand) structure and her work was instrumental in Watson and Crick in their discovery.<br>  <br>  DNA existed in different forms but at that time people didn't realize that so X ray structures were very unclear and muddled. Franklin was able to separate the different forms of DNA from some very good DNA and able to take clear pictures.<br>  <br>  The pictures were shown to Watson and Crick by Wilkins without her consent. Essentially her work was stolen. Of course the work didn't officially belong to her because she left the lab but still she didn't get the Nobel Prize.

NIyyDwNVaa	Okay so an action potential from a neuron or something will release acetycholine (a neurotransmitter) into the space between the nerve and the muscle cell.<br>  <br>  The acetycholine will bind to the receptors on the skeletal muscle cell membrane (sarcolemma) and this will depolarize the muscle cell. The Endoplasmic Reticulum (which stores calcium ions) will also depolarize opening channels which release Calcium into the cytoplasm (Sarcoplasm).<br>  <br>  Okay so skeletal muscle cells or have functional units called sarcomeres which consist of thick and thin filaments.<br>  <br>  The thin filaments are anchored at the end of the sarcomere to Z lines.<br>  The thick filaments are intertwined among thin filaments. <br>  <br>  (BTW on the side thick filaments produce dark bands that you can see of muscle cells and thin filaments form light bands)<br>  <br>  The thick and thin filaments are made of myosin and actin protein respectively. And both of those proteins when they interact will slide along each other (called sliding filament mechanism).<br>  <br>  However when a muscle is at rest, usually a protein Tropomyosin covers the sites (places) on the actin (thick filaments) where myosin will bind so that the muscle isn't always contracting.<br>  <br>  When calcium is released into the sarcoplasm (cytoplasm) it will bind to troponin (another protein) which will pull the tropomyosin back uncovering the binding sites on the actin filament<br>  <br>  Now myosin can bind to the actin and Using ATP it can slide along the actin filament pull the Z lines together and shorten the sarcomere.<br>  <br>  A bunch of sarcomeres lined end to end form the myofibril and that's so a bunch of these sarcomeres (the functional unit of muscles) can contract an entire muscle.<br>  <br>  Transverse tubules also are important because they help relay the signal deep into muscles and that causes all the sarcomeres to contract together making a stronger muscular contraction.<br>  <br>  Remember calcium is usually NOT found in the cytoplasm in high concentrations.  So tropomyosin will BLOCK myosin from binding to actin. And the muscle won't contract until something causes calcium to release into the cytoplasm
0C7xeiN3aa	The details of what happened there are a bit hazy for me at the moment, but you can be assured that it was fraudulent in its assertion. Cold fusion is not possible, in what we think of as fusion. We think of fusion as the fusion of two light hydrogen nuclei to a helium nucleus. This can be done by one of two methods: extreme pressure or extreme temperature. To date, we have not been able to achieve either here on terra firma. <br>  <br>  I believe the 1989 experiment resulted in the measurement of heat generated as a result of pump agitation of the water. In other words, Fleischmann and Pons measured the work being done on the water by the pump as work done on the water as a result of "fusion". This is why it was unreproducible, and hence why they've been discredited to no end.

Because I actually follow what NASA says.  On all topics.    There are NO (as in zero) real astronomer that said anything that could even be construed as being a hint of what you claim they have said.    We (solar system) are constantly in the Galaxy's magnetic field, which is weak, in flux density, compared to the Sun's magnetic field, as least for us (Earth) deep inside the Sun's magnetosphere and heliopause (they extend well past Neptune's orbit).    [The Galactic field is "big" in that it covers the whole Galaxy]    We (people on Earth's surface) are bathed in Earth's magnetic field which is must stronger (where we are) than the other two, since we are inside Earth's magnetosphere.    It is possible that Earth's field will have weakened sufficiently (by the year 3500) for us to worry.  It is even possible that a magnetic pole shift starts around that time (give or take a few centuries); magnetic reversals occur every 700,000 years on average -- and they have nothing to do with Galactic magnetic fields.      Earth's magnetism results from activity at the interface between the outer core and the inner mantle, more than halfway between our feet and Earth's centre.    A magnetic reversal takes about 5,000 years (on average) so that the "flip" could be over by the year 8500.    During the flip, Earth's magnetic field MAY be low enough that the number of Galactic cosmic particles (accelerated by the Galactic magnetic field) hitting our atmosphere could increase.    But that is obviously not for 2012 and it is not because we are "entering" a Galactic field.|`|OGw6Upv8aa	a new low for nonsense. is there any limit to internet gullibility?|`|ftwGaZ4Uaa	Neither NASA, nor acclaimed astronomers said anything like that.

z7BiMSWmaa	The actual production of ATP in cellular respiration takes place through the process of chemiosmosis. Chemiosmosis involves the pumping of protons through special channels in the membranes of mitochondria from the inner to the outer compartment as a result of electrons flowing along the electron transport chain.<br>  The pumping establishes a proton gradient. After the gradient is established, protons pass down the gradient through particles designated F1 (ATP Synthase). In these particles, the energy of the protons generates ATP, using ADP and phosphate ions as the starting points.

As I have explained many times, all bonds are covalent, it's just that some bonds are very polar.  It is these polar covalent bonds that some people refer to as "ionic".  Of these four, the Na-O bonds in Na2O will have the greatest ionic character (79.2 percent ionic) and the Al-Cl bonds in AlCl3 will have the least ionic character (45 percent ionic).<br>  <br>  In order to have an "ion" there must be a complete transfer of electrons from the anion to the metal.  That simply doesn't happen.  Even with the most ionic of bonds, Cs-F, the electrons are shared to a small degree.<br>  <br>  In MgCl2 the electronegativity difference between Mg and Cl is 1.85.  That translates to a bond that is 57.5 percent ionic (or 42.5 percent covalent).<br>  <br>  You see, bonding is a continuum, rather than an "either-or" proposition.  All bonds exhibit characteristics of covalent bonds and some some degree, ionic bonds.   We can compute where a particular bond is along that continuum and express that as the "percent ionic character".  We interpret that bond as being covalent with x amount of ionic character.  In the case of Mg-Cl bond, it is 57.5 percent ionic character.<br>  <br>  The bottom line is this, in the solid MgCl2 lattice, the two valence electrons of the Mg are being shared with the adjacent chlorine atoms to form a network of atoms.

gjKqBJwKaa	I find this question very  interesting, I have to say I do not know the correct answer but I know biology and medicine, so I am trying to figure out something about this.<br>  <br>  A virus, basically is a series of RNA that enters the cell and tells it to make copies of itself. then when the cell is just doing that normally it "explodes" and releases more RNA , releases more virus. <br>  <br>  now we know that there's cross compatibility of virus, for instance avian virus, have moved to humans, or rat virus, or pig ones ( not gonna count the pig ones because those are basically the same as humans on a biological level ) <br>  <br>  Now, some of those can go from one host to another, unchanged without any mutations, but we are on the same kingdom, the animal kingdom, now we have to think about a virus that could be "intelligent" enough to trick a cell from the "Plants kingdom" to the animal one.<br>  <br>  I do remember that there are bases that are the same on animal and plant cells, for instance the DNA, and RNA are made with the same nitrogenated bases, so in there we can see that they would be compatible. <br>  <br>  however, I would have my doubts on a ribosomal level, this is where the real issue stands, do the injection of foreign RNA to a plant ribosome, or a human ribosome, could make it actually make the virus, I think in theory it might be possible... <br>  <br>  I know that we have altered the DNA, and RNA of other species, to make drugs like insulin, but I have never seen ( not that I remember ) a plant altered to actually produce a human drug ( again lets say insulin) , so there has to be something on the molecular pathways that is different therefore not allowing the synthesis of proteins from one specie to the other.<br>  <br>  I have to say that I have never heard of a virus from a plant entering a human, I can say that parasites do, and other microorganism but a virus no, or not that I remember.<br>  <br>  so after all this I would have to say that it might be possible, but very hard to do, and personally with my limited experience I have never seen it. <br>  <br>  I would like to see if any biologist answer this question better, as I said I find it rather interesting. <br>  <br>  Thank you !|`|B7TFX4wUaa	No.  Viruses are far too specialized to infect such different organisms.

b1b911398e5752977033f736afe9e07caa	There are instances where dolphins have a co-beneficial relationship with humans with regards to fishing. This has been documented in wide ranging and disconnected environments (developed distinctly) such as Brazil, Mauritania and well documented by anthropologists studying the Noonuccal tribe of Minjerribah on Stradbroke Island in Australia. In all cases the dolphins are "called" to help corral fish, which are netted by the fishermen, part of the catch is shared with the dolphins. Of course in those cultures the dolphins are revered and not harmed. <br>  <br>  You may face a difficulty of efficiency though. Whales & dolphins require a lot of food, and as predators, they eat "meat" (fish). One of the most common ways to domesticate is to provide something beneficial to the animal - safety & food are the most common. Humans can't really offer safety as an enticement and if we're requiring work from them during a time when they would be catching their own food, the obligation would be to feed them. However, how would the food be caught? At what energy expense and would we get at least an equal amount of work from them?<br>  <br>  Dolphins & toothed whales are generally social creatures and are often in bonded groups. Baleen whales would be less helpful in this process, they tend to swim at depth (usually 100-500 feet) because it's more efficient, which probably wouldn't work well for a yoke system. <br>  <br>  There are anecdotal tales of dolphins that do and will pull a small boat with a tether, but this is usually at the pleasure of the dolphin. And you have to go where the dolphin wants. <br>  <br>  It is obviously possible, but not likely to be efficient or beneficial. The most likely use of sea mammals would be for search & rescue and for aid in fishing (especially rounding up fish). But humans have a poor track record with many species in many areas and some dolphins may be wary. <br>  <br>  As a side note there is a culture of using cormorants to fish. The birds have long skinny necks. The fisherman keeps the bird on a long tether, fastened around the neck tight enough that it can't swallow. The bird chases down fish underwater, and when it returns to the boat it regurgitates the fish. Every seventh fish, though, is the birds to keep and the rope is loosened. The bird gets sanctuary out of this and transport to good fishing grounds.|`|TSc8OE4vaa	No.  Before the industrial revolution, there was no way to contain them.  Unlike land animals which can be fenced in, you would need a huge aquarium to trap a whale, which did not exist before then.  <br>  <br>  Also whales and dolphins would not take too kindly to being harnessed.  It would be easy for the whale to dive down and then submerge the boat, even by mistake it could happen.<br>  <br>  Bottlenose dolphins can be trained, but to pull a boat would be hard for them.  Dolphins are very social animals and they would hate to be separated from their pod.

ToGslGb3aa	A chemical equation is balanced you have the same number of atoms on both sides of the equation. For example:<br>  <br>  CO + O ---> CO2 (the 2 is supposed to be subscript)<br>  <br>  You have one atom of carbon on each side, and 2 atoms of oxygen on each side, so it is balanced. You can use coefficients in front of them to help balance equations out.<br>  <br>  CO + (2)O ---> CO3<br>  <br>  By putting the 2 in font of the O, it gives you 2 oxygen atoms, plus the other oxygen, which makes three and there are three on the other side. There is 1 carbon atom on each side. Since all the atoms are balanced, the equation is balanced.

If you want to find the strength of Earth's gravitational field *AT* the moon (or the pull of the Earth on the moon), then you want to use the equation<br>  GM/r^2.  <br>  <br>  You, know, however that<br>  GM/(6400)^2 = 9.81m/s^2<br>  And you can look up that the moon is 384,000km away.  So this is what you want your "r" to be.  But, 384,000km = 60*6400... so<br>  g=GM/(384,0000)^2<br>  g=GM/(60*6400)^2<br>  g=GM/(6400)^2 * 1/(3600)<br>  g=9.8 * 1/3600 = 0.0027m/s^2<br>  <br>  IDK what everyone else was doing (except the guy above me), but g should be very very small.  You see that the moon has a gravitational field of 1.6m/s^2 around it due to its own mass.  Detecting this 0.0027m/s^2 pull from Earth would be difficult, so the Earth's gravitational field at the moon is practically zero since the gravitational field near the moon is due to the moon's presence; the Earth is about a 1% perturbation to that moon-only model.|`|3b0083d3c1ba4bf8a6df4abdf7bc532caa	The gravitational field strength of a uniform spherical body varies as the inverse square of the distance from the centre of that body*.

The figues you quote for the moon itself are irrelevant to this question.  You can convert to km if you like and do the arithmetic.<br>  <br>  *This is true outside the earth, whose mass we can assume, for the purposes of this question, to be concentrated in a point at its centre.  Inside a uniform spherical body, the gravitational field strength actually varies linearly with distance from the centre, and is zero at the centre.<br>  <br>  Further - the gravitational field strength of the earth at the distance of the moon may well be very small but it is sufficient to keep the moon in orbit around the earth.  Newton's great leap of intellect was to realise that it was the same gravitational field that made things (like apples) fall to the ground as keeps the moon in orbit around the earth.|`|dNMAMDGDaa	Gravitational acceleration is 9.8Nkg^-1. <br>  Gravitational Field strength is a different thing, it's calculated using <br>  <br>  GM/r^2 (G is the constant of gravitation, M is mass of the earth, and r is the distance between the CENTRE of the earth and the centre of the moon)<br>  <br>  <br>  Note to the guy above: FORCE is Gmm/r^2.

CngwDl6gaa	Double fertilisation is the process in angiosperms (flowering plants) during reproduction, in which two sperm nuclei from each pollen tube fertilise two cells in an ovary. The pollen grain adheres to the stigma of the carpel (female reproductive structure) and grows a pollen tube that penetrates the ovum through a tiny pore called a micropyle. Two sperm cells are released into the ovary through this tube. One of the two sperm cells fertilises the egg cell (at the bottom of the ovule near the micropyle), forming a diploid (2n) zygote. The other sperm cell fuses with two haploid polar nuclei (contained in the central cell) in the centre of the embryo sac (or ovule). The resulting cell is triploid (3n). This triploid cell divides through mitosis and forms the endosperm, a nutrient-rich tissue, inside the seed.

zYQFpJWNaa	First, pitch and frequency are essentially the same thing. Pitch is more related to human perception, and frequency to scientific measurement, but they are not really different.<br>  <br>  Each string has a different diameter, and is set to a different tension. That sets the frequency of the open string. Then, whenever you press the string against a fret, you create a node in the string, and the string will vibrate from the node above the sounding hole to the node at the fret, and the distance between these two nodes will determine the frequency of the primary vibration (the longest standing wave) of the string.  <br>  <br>  Harmonics of any vibrating body are created when there are higher frequencies that share the 'end' nodes of vibration with the primary frequency. So a guitar string can vibrate with just the two ends as nodes, or with the two ends and the center point - between the two ends - as nodes, or with any number of nodes equally spaced between the two ends.

z7BiMSWmaa	Although the exact molecular mechanism is unknown, in vitro studies suggest a model in which the cycle stars with myosin (in the absence of ATP) tightly bound to F actin. ATP binding disassociates myosin from F actin and its hydrolysis induces a conformational chain in myosin that displace the myosin head by about 10 nm. ADP and PI remain bound to myosin, which is said to be in the "******" position. The myosin head then rebinds to a new position on F actin resulting in Pi release. This release triggers the "power stroke", in which ADP is released and the myosin head returns to its initial conformation, thereby sliding the actin filament toward the M line.  = FALSE
NIyyDwNVaa	Yes all hormones interact with a receptor (whether it is on the cell membrane) or whether it is found inside the cell.<br>  <br>  Water solubule hormones (Peptide hormones and some amino acid based hormones) cannot diffuse through the membrane.<br>  <br>  Instead they bind to receptors on the cell membrane which in turn is able to either act as an ion channel increasing permeability of membrane to something<br>  <br>  Or it can activate an intracellular secondary messenger system (cAMP, cGMP, or Calmodulin) and that in turns impacts the cell in many ways.<br>  <br>  Steroid hormones on the other hand are lipid soluble which can diffuse through the membrane and bind to receptors in the cell which then can be transported to the nucleus where they can impact transcription of a gene. Or they could also activate an intracellualar secondary messenger.

Check the websites for the veterinary schools you want to attend to see what their specific requirements are since most veterinary schools have slightly different requirements.<br>  <br>  Generally, you need to take<br>  1 year biology<br>  1 year general chemistry<br>  1 year organic chemistry<br>  1 year biochemistry<br>  1 -2 semesters of physics<br>  cellular biology, microbiology, embryology, anatomy, physiology.<br>  <br>  Veterinary schools also require that you take either the GRE, MCAT, or VCAT.<br>  <br>  You can major in anything as an undergrad as long as you have all of your requirements done, however people usually major in a science like animal science, biology, neuroscience, biochemistry, microbiology etc<br>  <br>  If you want to be a wildlife vet you pretty much have to have wildlife experience before you apply to veterinary school. Tufts has a very good wildlife program.<br>  <br>  <br>  Unfortunately, it is highly unlikely that there are any jobs out there like the one you want. If you were independently wealthy, you could travel around and be a doctor at any park that would take you. Alternatively, you could get a PhD in addition to your DVM and travel around to international national parks helping animals by doing research on something like disease transmission, zoonosis, behavior, or habitat loss.

Various types of coastline.<br>  <br>  The main human niches:<br>  <br>  River valleys - farming and urban centres.  Savannah - originally hunting, and now commercial farmland with irrigation. Also significant amounts of subsistence farming. Cattle farming in semi-arid areas and certain types of scrub forest (mopane). Coastal and sea fishing.

HyUE9ON0aa	The polar bear or the sea/ice bear are the world's largest land predators.  They can be found in the Artic, the U.S. (Alaska), Canada, Russia, Denmark (Greenland), and Norway.  Each of these countries either banned hunting or established rules for how many polar bears could be hunted within its own boundaries. These rules help keep polar bear populations stable. Today, 25,000 to 40,000 polar bears roam the Arctic.<br>  <br>  <br>  Around the age of four or five the female polar bear can start having babies. They usually only have two cubs and they have these babies in a cave they've dug in a large snow drift.  They stay there over winter and come out in spring with the babies.  <br>  <br>  The babies are much smaller than human babies when they're born.  They are the size of a rat and weigh little more than a pound.  They can grow to full man size in a year if they have lots of food.<br>  <br>  Male polar bears may grow 10 feet tall and weigh over 1400 pounds.  Females reach seven feet and weigh 650 pounds.  In the wild polar bears live up to age 25.<br>  <br>  Despite what we think, a polar bear's fur is not white.  Each hair is clear hollow tube.  Polar bears look white because each hollow hair reflects the light. On sunny days, it traps the sun's infrared heat and keeps the bear warm at 98 degrees F (when they're resting). <br>   Polar bear fur is oily and water repellent. The hairs don't mat when wet, allowing the polar bears to easily shake free of water and any ice that may form after swimming. <br>  <br>  Polar bears have wide front paws with slightly webbed toes that help them swim.  They paddle with their front feet and steer with their hind feet.  Paw pads with rough surfaces help prevent polar bears from slipping up on the ice.<br>  <br>  Polar bears have been known to swim 100 miles (161 kilometers) at a stretch.<br>  <br>  Polar bears primarily eat seals. They often rest silently at a seal’s breathing hole in the ice, waiting for a seal in the water to surface. Once the seal comes up, the bear will spring and sink its jagged teeth into the seal’s head.<br>  <br>  Sometimes the polar bear stalks its prey. It may see a seal lying near its breathing hole and slowly move toward it, then charge it, biting its head or grabbing it with its massive claws. A polar bear may also hunt by swimming beneath the ice.<br>  <br>  Humans are the polar bears only predator.  Baby polar bears often starve.  In fact, 70 percent do not live to their third birthday.  Sometimes seals are hard to find, especially in the summer when the ice has melted.  All across the Arctic, man is moving in to mine oil and coal and there is less space for the polar bear to live.  Oil spills can be very dangerous.  A bear with oil on its coat cannot regulate its body temperature properly.  If the bear eats the oil while grooming it could die. <br>  <br>  Man made pollution is also a cause of death.  At each stage of the food chain, pollutants get more concentrated.  By the end when the polar bear eats the seal and it could be lethal.|`|I54FE7iSaa	You can eat any part of them other than their liver, too much vitamin A.|`|FLgDn3OTaa	They are the world's largest carnivore, found in the northern hemisphere. Seals make up an important part of the diet. Polar bears can smell a seal from a mile away, and catch them by waiting for them to surface at breathing holes, or by digging in the ice to find a seal pup in its den. Polar bears in Canada are known for entering human dwellings and feeding on rubbish.|`|aIyvWIJlaa	They eat seals, they're big, they are covered in a thick coat of hollow white hairs, they swim well, they're threatened by global warming because they can't hunt seals unless the sea is frozen over.

The world's largest carnivore found on land, and shares the title of largest land predator with the Kodiak Bear, an adult male weighs around 400–680 kg (880–1,500 lb), while an adult female is about half that size. Although it is closely related to the brown bear, it has evolved to occupy a narrow ecological niche, with many body characteristics adapted for cold temperatures, for moving across snow, ice, and open water, and for hunting the seals which make up most of its diet. Although most polar bears are born on land, it spends most of its time at sea, hence its name meaning "maritime bear", and can hunt consistently only from sea ice, spending much of the year on the frozen sea.<br>  <br>  The polar bear is classified as a vulnerable species, with 5 of the 19 polar bear subpopulations in decline. For decades, unrestricted hunting raised international concern for the future of the species; populations have rebounded after controls and quotas began to take effect. For thousands of years, the polar bear has been a key figure in the material, spiritual, and cultural life of Arctic indigenous peoples, and the hunting of polar bears remains important in their cultures.<br>  <br>  The IUCN now lists global warming as the most significant threat to the polar bear, primarily because the melting of its sea ice habitat reduces its ability to find sufficient food. The IUCN states, "If climatic trends continue polar bears may become extirpated from most of their range within 100 years." On May 14, 2008, the United States Department of the Interior listed the polar bear as a threatened species under the Endangered Species Act.|`|zNm5OHjAaa	2 great facts about polar bears I read somewhere - <br>  <br>  They are not white.

jKvA9jwzaa	Sex-linkage is another common alternative-inheritance pattern. In sex-linked traits, such as color-blindness, the gene for the trait is found on the X chromosome (a sex chromosome). Sex-linked traits affect primarily males, since they have only one copy of the X chromosome (male genotype: XY). Females, who have two copies of the X chromosome, are affected only if they are homozygous for the trait. Females can, however, be carriers for sex-linked traits, passing their X chromosomes on to their sons. Sex-linked inheritance works as follows: if a female carrier and a normal male give birth to a daughter, she has a 1 in 2 chance of being a carrier of the trait (like her mother). If the child is a son, he has a 1 in 2 chance of being affected by the trait (for example, colorblindness). If a female carrier and an affected male give birth to a daughter, she will either be affected or be a carrier. If the child is a son, he will either be affected or be entirely free of the gene. <br>  <br>  sex-linked trait is hemophilia, made famous by the "Queen Victoria pedigree" of the European nobility. Beginning with Queen Victoria of England (in whom it was probably a spontaneous mutation), the hemophilia gene spread quickly throughout the European rulers (who intermarried as a matter of course). The disease, which prevents blood from clotting properly and renders a minor injury a life-threatening event, claimed several young men of the royal line. Especially since male heirs were preferred over female as successors to the thrones of Europe, the spread of such a debilitating disease was a major problem.

zYQFpJWNaa	This is really a good question, even if no one else seemed interested in responding to it. <br>  <br>  Heat dissipates into the 'local' environment, but yes, given enough time, it will radiate into space. This 'enough'  time might be longer than you would expect, since the heat from the time of the creation of our planet - heat that is still in the earth's core, has only dissipated a few hundred degrees since the planet formed, about 4.5 billion years ago. Some of the heat loss has been offset by  nuclear decay, but not much.<br>  <br>  But your question of 'does it stay in space forever' is the interesting part. Yes and no. I mean it does not just stay in space, it spreads to space and planets and everywhere. And it goes on spreading forever. <br>  <br>  You may have heard about 'background radiation' in space. This is the  average temperature of the universe. It is the heat that is still there from the big bang. Its been spreading around for 15 billion years, with no prospect of ending. Of course, if the universe is expanding, then it will continue to expand, and its temperature (now about 2.7 degrees Kelvin) will drop - but the heat is all still there - just spread more or less thinly.<br>  <br>  This is a bit technical, but you may be interested in  looking at <br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_microwave_background_radiation" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_micr...</a>
QPWjtDzcaa	I think you have some misinformation on the definition of "dawrf planet."<br>  <br>  It is not mass, size, or composition related, that seperates the definition between planet and dwarf planet, but the phrase "cleared the neighborhood."<br>  <br>  Pluto and Ceres (note spelling), along with Eris, Humea, and Makemake are called dwarf planets, and not planets, because they do not have gravitational dominance over their orbits.  Ceres lies in the asteroid belt.  The others lie in the Kupier Belt.  There are up to hundreds of thousands of objects in these regions of space.<br>  <br>  No doubt, I have issues with this definition...  if Mercury were located in either of these regions, and had no other differences, it would be classified (under the current definition) as a dwarf planet.  <br>  <br>  If we discovered an object as massive as Earth, Venus, or Mars, in the Kuiper Belt or Asteroid Belt (the astroid belt I can pretty safely say is devoid of anything this massive) such an object would be classified as a dwarf planet.   If we moved it out of that region, it had it's own gravtiy dominated orbit (clear neighborhood), it would not matter what its composition was.  Just as long as it was spherical and orbited the sun, it would qualify as a planet.  The same would be true for Ceres and Pluto...   They do not have to change composition or mass to become planets, they merely need to keep a cleaner backyard.|`|qZWko07Kaa	It would be probably called a mediocre planet or something.|`|MMUGLjsPaa	Justin L,<br>  <br>  Once body is large enough to form assume a spherical shape it's size or mass doesn't change weather we classify it as a planet or dwarf planet.

So your answer should be ion Y has a charge of 2+ seeing as ion X developed a charge of 2-<br>  It cannot be that ion Y formed a charge of 3+ because then the compound would not be balanced, all compounds must have an overall charge of 0.<br>  Looks liks Steve and Matt got confused|`|ToztjpAsaa	The element from which the ion is formed is defined by the number of protons in the nucleus, a value that is known as the "Atomic number".  In this case the atomic number is 26.  From the periodic table, you can see that this element is iron.<br>  <br>  The charge on the iron ion is given by the difference between the number of positively charged protons and the number of negatively charged electrons.  In this case it's 26 -23 = +3.  So the ion is Fe3+ .|`|g0XjuvBfaa	Iron + 3....if you look at the periodic table the number of protons is the atomic number...protons - electrons is the charge...
4BqjVDxaaa	Formulas that are good to know:<br>  <br>  Stotal = Scooled-ice + Swater-to-ice + Sice<br>  <br>  S = Q/T for constant T<br>  <br>  dS = dQ/T for changing T<br>  <br>  Q=mc(Delta T) or dQ = mcdT<br>  <br>  The change in entropy of the "great deal of ice" is simple to calculate, as the temperature is constant. The total Q into the ice is 7.09 * 10^8 J. Thus, the change in entropy for the ice is (7.09 * 10^8 J)/(263 K) = <br>  <br>  Sice = 2.7 * 10^6 J/K. <br>  <br>  The change in entropy of the water when it's turning into ice happens at a constant temperature, thus it's just the latent heat of fusion * mass / T. Notice however, that the water is LOSING heat, so Q is negative. (-6.66 * 10^8 J) / 273 K = <br>  <br>  Swater-to-ice = -2.439 * 10^6 J/K.<br>  <br>  Since the temperature of the ice is not constant as it is being cooled, we will have to integrate dQ/T. By using the specific heat formula, we can substitute mcdT in for dQ. Integrating mcdT/T gives m*c*ln(Tf/Ti). Tf is the final temperature 263 K and Ti is the initial temperature 273 K. <br>  <br>  Scooled-ice = 2000 * 2.1 * ln(263/273) = -156.735 kJ/K or -156735 J/K<br>  <br>  Adding all the individual changes in entropy will give the total change in entropy for the whole process:<br>  <br>  2.7 * 10^6 J/K + (-2.439 * 10^6 J/K) + (-156735 J/K) = 104265 J/K|`|uOqk7PzGaa	The heat released from the liquid water into the ice is given by<br>  <br>  Q = m cv (T2-T1) + m q_latent_fusion<br>  <br>  Q = (2000 kg) (2.05 kJ/KgK)(10) + (2000 kg) (334 kJ/kg)<br>  <br>  Q = 709000 kJ<br>  <br>  Entropy Change <br>  <br>  S = Q / To = 709000 / 263 = 2695 kJ / K

SvmZlLdaaa	Tigers are the largest species of cat, with the Siberian subspecies being the largest. Ligers (the offspring of a male lion and female tiger) tend towards gigantism and are generally larger than either of their parents - they grow larger than Siberian tigers, but they are hybrids, not a species in their own right. Tigons (the offspring of a male tiger and female lion) are generally smaller or at least no larger than their parents.<br>  <br>  Like most hybrids, ligers and tigons are usually sterile, but occasionally a female will be fertile and can be bred back to a male lion or tiger, producing:<br>  <br>  Lion + liger = li-liger<br>  Lion + tigon = li-tigon<br>  Tiger + liger = ti-liger<br>  Tiger + tigon = ti-tigon<br>  <br>  There is no record of fertile males, so you could never breed two ligers or two tigons together, or a liger with a tigon.<br>  <br>  Respectable zoos frown on the breeding of hybrids such as ligers and tigons, as they have no value from a conservation point of view and are taking up space and resources that could be used to breed endangered species. They are basically freaks bred by unscrupulous zoos in order to make money out of people willing to pay to see them. Today, there is very little chance of them occurring in the wild - tigers are found only in Asia, lions in Africa and the Gir Forest of India, where there are no tigers. Historically, the Asiatic subspecies of lion had a much greater range which overlapped with that of the tiger, so it is possible, though unlikely, that they may once have sometimes occurred in the wild.<br>  <br>  Liger:<br>  <a href="http://www.liger.org/images/liger-pic.jp..." rel="nofollow">http://www.liger.org/images/liger-pic.jp...</a><br>  <br>  Tigon:<br>  <a href="http://www.tiger-online.org/tigbib/bigca..." rel="nofollow">http://www.tiger-online.org/tigbib/bigca...</a>|`|HyUE9ON0aa	Among wild tigers Siberian tiger is the biggest.<br>  <br>  But among zoo tigers/lions  the liger is bigger.<br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.africapoint.net/wp-content/uploads/2007/07/liger-tiger-compare.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.africapoint.net/wp-content/up...</a><br>  <br>  @@@@@|`|eiim3tJuaa	Ligers are bigger.<br>  <br>  However, ligers are a hybrid animal and man made.

9lzNDwhZaa	No, because it is a mono substance rock formed in either metamorphic conditions or near metamorphic conditions. Neither pure quartzites or pure marbles carry foliation either.<br>  <br>  "Non-foliated textures are identified by their lack of planar character. Further identification of non-foliated rocks is dependent on the composition of the minerals or components in the rock. Anthracite coal is similar to bituminous coal. Both are black in colour, and is composed of carbon. Anthracite coal is generally shiny in appearance and breaks with a conchoidal fracture (broken glass also shows this type of fracture). Metaconglomerate is composed of pebbles and gravel that have been flattened due to directed pressure. Quartzite is composed of quartz sand grains. Quartz has a hardness of 7, which makes it difficult to scratch. Marble is composed of calcite and will readily react to a small drop of HCl."

Take the equation for heat flow through an object:<br>  <br>  Q=m*Cp*dT  Where Q is heat flow, m is mass, Cp is heat capacity, and dT is the temperature difference on both sides of the material.  For the wax problem, the metal will have different temperatures on the surface of both sides.  Assume the higher temperature is the side not contacting the wax.  If the metal has a high heat capacity, the energy will flow quickly through the metal and melt the wax.  If it has a low heat capacity, energy will travel much slower and melt the wax slower.|`|8d3ad8d328549f8800f8868ec2eb91b3aa	Each material has a calories per gram constant.

AA11432707	It's a closely guarded secret, how we do things, and if I told you, I'd have to kill you.  LOL<br>  <br>  Anaesthesia is as much art as it is science.  We start out learning formulas and weight based dosages, and all sorts of cookbook ways to do things, but with experience comes clinical judgment, and we use that as much as anything in determining what to give and how much of it.  We have drugs we like, and those we don't, and years of experience guide us.  That wasn't too helpful, was it?<br>  <br>  Turning off life support can be a kindness.  It's cruel to let a loved one languish in an ICU with tubes everywhere as they waste away and wait for death, if there is no hope of meaningful recovery.  So, yes, I'd turn off life support out of love, even before brain death.  (Braindead = dead, you know.  Gone.)<br>  <br>  I hope your week gets better.|`|a4kTbjfeaa	If you are really a doctor you should know better than to come here for info. You need to discuss these issues with your supervisors so you have a clear understanding of this issue. With regard to the anesthesia you should ask the anesthesiologist. Most of the meds are weight based or standard doses. By glancing at the patients body habitus they can estimate their weight and the dose needed. Maybe Pangolin can jump in and give some more info on this part.  <br>  Declaring brain death is different in every hospital as they each have their own protocols. If the patient has no brainstem reflexes it is safe to say they are brain dead. Apnea testing is required. If the patient is not stable for apnea testing they can undergo MRI or angiography to demonstrate no blood flow to the brain. Deciding to take a family member off life support is a personal decision. If the patient has made their wishes known (through a legal document) this can help the process.|`|3jSVmpV4aa	umm...I always thought it was estimated body weight for anesthesia???|`|ZDMjuf4Taa	oh dear, i remember being so very worried when i was a junior nurse i used to go home after a shift and go over and over everything i had done for patients checking in my head that it was the right thing to do and being so happy when i went on shift the next day and then saw them alive.  you have asked two different questions.  how much does the aneathttist know how to give, this is partly calculated by the body weight, other health issues, what medications if any the patient is on, perhaps other things i have missed out.  the second question, when to turn of a live support is a big one, the patient has to be pronounced chemically brain dead no functioning brain activity, no one will know whether it is the right or wrong thing to turn of a machine which is holding the life of your loved one until you were actually in that position, it was unkind and unfeeling of your superiors to order you to turn of the machine. do not be disheartened carry on doing the job and be as sensitive as you are now throughout your career

Hr9AfJwYaa	Electronegativity is a measure of how "attracted" an element is to its electrons. The more electronegative something is, the harder it is pull away electrons, and the easier to "add" electrons. That's why non metals are more electronegative than most metals. In general, the trend is that electronegativity increases as you move towards Flourine (which has a 4, the highest possible). Therefore, Francium, which is at the bottom left of the PT, has the lowest EN. As you move "up" and "right," EN increases, so the easy answer is because  Ca is higher up than K. A better answers requires the understanding of how things react:<br>  <br>  Becasue K is an alkali metal, it really wants to lose that last electron so that it can form a full and stable outer shell. It hates that last electron so much that its willing to give it away with explosive force which is why potassium explodes if you throw it in water. Calcium has 2 outer electrons (valence electrons). It still wants to lose the electrons, but just not as badly as potassium because potassium is closer to having a full electron shell than it is. So while calcium doesn't like its last 2 electrons, it still likes it better than potassium does.|`|DTbrNPsvaa	Calcium has a greater ability to attract electrons from other elements|`|AFJtFhEOaa	As you move across the periodic table horizontally along a period, electronegativity increases.  This is because you are getting closer to fluoride, which has the highest electronegativty.  You can always figure how electronegative something is by moving diagonally from francium to fluoride.  It increases as you move up.  <br>  <br>  So, calcium would have higher electronegativity than potassium|`|lTLRQRK7aa	The reason that the electronegativity increases is that while the distance from the nucleus remains fairly consistent along a period (as the electrons are in the same shell) the attraction between the nucleus and the outer shell (and so any electrons going into that shell) is higher, because the number of protons in the nucleus has increased.<br>  <br>  Electronegativity decreases down a group because each new shell is further from the nucleus than the last.<br>  <br>  Some slight simplifications in there, as the electrons don't sit at precisely defined positions, but it should give the right idea.|`|4ca00641a929ededddbf3cdd91a663b0aa	In general electronegativity is the measure of an atom's ability to attract electrons to itself in a covalent bond. Because fluorine is the most electronegative element, the electrons tend to "hang out" more toward the fluorine atom when fluorine is covalently bonded to other atoms.

HwPa2frOaa	Cu and Cr are able to obtain a more stable electron configuration when they take an electron from the 4s and add it to 3d. When it does this it becomes either a half full shell (Cr) or a full one (Cu) this results in a more stable compound with lower energy. It only works if by removing and one electron from the s subshell an a half full or full subshell results. Half full or full is ideal in electron configuration. 3s will not have an electron removed from it, only the s subshell directly before a d subshell will result in an electron being taken from it.

That means they do not perform cardiac catheterizations or other invasive procedures requiring steady hands and dexterity.<br>  <br>  Cardiologists are internists. Most internal medicine is cerebral. They analyse, diagnose and treat cardiovascular conditions through non-invasive means. Cardiologists will refer to a cardiothoracic surgeon, interventional cardiologist if medical therapy fails.<br>  <br>  Now the down side: every cardiology fellow must perform a certain number of interventional procedures during their training in order to complete the fellowship. It does not matter if they intend to do interventions later in their career.<br>  <br>  If you have debilitating tremors it would be a challenge to become a cardiologist but not impossible.<br>  <br>  Consider other medical specialties such as nephrology which require little or no manual dexterity.<br>  <br>  EDIT:<br>  If you are passionate about the study of the cardiovascular system why not become a medical scientist.

E563RzW2aa	Well, my chem teacher taught us a way to do this for some simple polyatomic ions with oxygen in them.<br>  <br>  It goes: "Nick the camel served a clam in Phoenix."<br>  <br>  All words in there except for "the", "a", and "in" represent a polyatomic ion.  <br>  <br>  To get your compound get the starting letter of the word (eg. nitrogen starts with N) and add an O to it.  The amount of vowels in the word determine the amount of oxygen atoms and the amount of consonants determine the charge (always negative since these are "trates")<br>  <br>  Therefore you would get NO3^ - from Nick (3 consonants, 1 vowel) , and SO4^2- for served (4 consonants, 2 vowels).

LVOPlHquaa	Aluminum is the most common 'light metal', as many have listed it with some product examples.  It is not very strong by itself; aluminum foil is basically pure aluminum, and is very soft and weak (that's the point of using it as a formable foil).  By mixing other metals with aluminum, it can be made much stronger for things like aircraft structures.  When strength is needed, pure metals are rarely used.  <br>  <br>  Precious metals like silver may seem light, but are actually fairly heavy for a given volume (dense).  The reason we may think of them as light is because most people (myself included) have only seen relatively small parts of them in one place, and can't make accurate comparisons.  If you had a block of silver, it would be much heavier than a block of steel  of the same size.|`|NIbJxTKpaa	Aluminum and titanium are both light, but titanium is a lot stronger.

PwfS4T74aa	There is a variety of methods that can be used to find extrasolar planets, such as the  Doppler Method, Pulsar timing, and the Transit method. The accuracy of most methods isn't very high, but some extrasolar planets have been confirmed|`|MMUGLjsPaa	1) Direct observation<br>  Using Hubble and other earth based telescopes, astronomers have been able to visually detect planets orbiting other stars.<br>  <br>  2) Transit Method<br>  When a planet crosses in front of a star, light from the star is diminished.  The body might not be visually perceived but the loss of light is. Try looking at a far away crosswalk during the night.  As people pass in front of the lights of stopped cars the lights of those cars are dimmed you may not know what has passed in front of the car but you know that dark has passed in front of it.  In the case of a star, if the light dims on a periodic basis then it is a clear indicator that a darker body is passing in front of it and hence a planet.<br>  <br>  3) Alteration of Stellar Proper Motion<br>  Stars like planets have and orbits (within their respective galaxies).  This is known as the "proper motion of a star". If the proper motion of a star is known and the star is at point A in the sky then as time T passes is is expected to be at point B.  If it is not then this raises two questions a) the proper motion may have not be accurately know of b) a B) a planet may have caused it to "wobble"off course.  You can test the wobble theory yourself by tying a string to a light weight and carefully spinning it around your head.  Even though the weigh is much lighter that you, you'll be able to feel it's tug on your body.  This is what happens to a star when it supports an orbital system of planets.  The planets "tug"or "wobble"the star away from it's intended path (proper motion).|`|6GJnprHuaa	To detect an extrasolar planet, a scientist looks at the planets spectrum using a spectroscope. If it detects a disturbance in the stars spectrum, it means that a planet is orbiting the star because the planets gravity is creating a wobble in a stars motion.
f18e617fe0754473c97b4f67d099bfcdaa	For satellites, storms of charged particles can penetrate computer chips, causing false commands that could among other things, shut them down. They can also permanently damage electronics, and induce destructive surges of electricity within a satellite's electrical circuitry, destroying them. The charged particles from solar flares also can damage solar cells as well. For those of us on the ground, aside from the problems damaged or disabled satellites can cause such as loss of internet and telephone service, solar flares can induce massive surges of current in power lines. The end result of this can be widespread blackouts because transformers do not tolerate power surges and are easily destroyed by them. The transformers that are part of the Earth's power grids are not off the shelf items, and must be custom made with a manufacturing lead time of up to two whole years. That is why power plants have spare transformers on site in case one fails. In that event, a failed transformer can be replaced quickly but a massive solar flare induces black out can destroy dozens or hundreds of them. That would mean millions without electricity, with food shortages, water shortages and riots being the problems faced by authorities attempting to get life back to normal. However, we do have satellites watching the Sun's every move. If a major flare is underway, the charged particle storms will take up to several days to reach us, and in that time power grid and satellite operators can reduce the amperage on the power lines or put their satellites into hibernation to save them from damage or destruction.
QPWjtDzcaa	Use a projection method<br>  (Pinhole, or  a projection through a lens)<br>  <br>  Use #14 welder's goggles.<br>  <br>  Use a filter specifically designed for solar observation.|`|zQiwHJV6aa	Look up in the sky when it's daytime with some special sunglasses.|`|ZN5iGL4waa	There are generally two different types of telescopic observation of the sun. One is white light, and the other is hydrogen-alpha.<br>  <br>  White light observing can be done with just about any telescope. You need to acquire an aperture solar filter. This type of filter attaches to the front of the scope. Some people have made filters that attach to the eyepiece but you *do not* want to use these. They are very unsafe. The light from the sun is already very concentrated by the time it reaches an eyepiece filter. It has to filter the light by preventing most of it from getting through, which means a combination of absorption and reflection. The absorption means it will get very hot and could get damaged, and the reflected light will heat the interior of your scope. It is not safe.<br>  <br>  Aperture filters on the other hand filter the light before it gets focussed at all, mostly through reflection. As long as they are attached firmly and contain no holes, they provide for safe white light viewing.<br>  <br>  The person who had a concern about glass filters "shattering" suddenly... well how often does glass shatter spontaneously? Besides, I prefer to use mylar or similar plastic based filters, which can't shatter.<br>  <br>  Hydrogen-alpha solar viewing can be more interesting than white light viewing. It essentially filters out all the light from the sun except for a particular wavelength of red light, which comes mostly from the sun's chromosphere. When viewing in this type of light you can see more interesting details like filaments and prominences along the edges. In white light, the only thing you'll see are sunspots and some of the granularity, as this type of filter shows you the photosphere.<br>  <br>  H-a filters are very expensive compared to white light. They typically require some complex optical filtering to eliminate much of the extra energy from the sunlight and then filter it down to pass only a very specific wavelength of light. Coronado (a division of Meade) makes a number of solar telescopes. They have an entry-level version called the PST (Personal Solar Telescope) which is I think around $600 that can give pretty decent H-a views of the sun.<br>  <br>  The white-light filter I bought for my 8" telescope cost about $100 so it's more affordable. Remember, solar viewing is potentially dangerous. Without appropriate filtration you can cause damage to your equipment, or at the worst, cause permanent eye damage. You should never look directly at the sun, and definitely never point any kind of optical device at the sun without first securing appropriate and sufficient filtration and learning how to install and use it properly.|`|KHSOVxViaa	Don't ever look at the sun through a telescope; even with a filter it's a bad idea.  What if it were to shatter suddenly?<br>  <br>  The normal way to do it is to project the image from the eyepiece onto a flat surface, like card.|`|qKvnpwL6aa	Well if you take off the lense of a pair of sunglasses and put it over your telescopes lense.
cqLYkuz8aa	When you say "taking goats", I assume you mean taking it to fairs and shows. <br>  <br>  What kind of goat you want really depends on what you want to do with it. Do you want to sell it at the end of the fair? Do you want to keep it as a pet? Do you want to shear it and sell its fiber? Do you want to breed it and sell the kids?<br>  <br>  There are 6 different breeds of diary goats: <br>  Nubians, LaManchas, Alpines, Oberhaslis, Togenburgs, and Saanan<br>  If you don't want to milk, don't get one of these goats. In order for a goat (or cow) to come into milk, she must give birth, so you will have to have the ability to breed her, house her and her young, and care for the kids. Because of this, most people who have dairy goats have them year round and don't sell them at the fairs.  <br>  <br>  Fiber goats include angora goats. You don't have to breed them to show them, and you can show either a doe, buck or whether. Generally people keep fiber goats year round as well.<br>  <br>  The most common meat goats are Boer goats and again, you don't have to breed them to show them, and you can show either a doe, buck or whether. Many people who show Boer goats sell them at the fair or auctions after the show.<br>  <br>  Pygmy goats and Nigerian Dwarf goats are smaller goats that are generally kept as pets. You don't have to breed them to show them, and you can show either a doe, buck or whether.

yTkNT3OSaa	First of all, if you've managed to break some 440 blades, you were abusing them (prying or twisting rather than cutting). No matter what steel you get, using a knife in this way will at the very least ruin the edge, and possibly break the knife.<br>  <br>  The best knife for you would be a simple swiss army knife with screwdriver blades which could also be used for light prying.<br>  <br>  As for the steel question, Chris Reeve worked with Crucible to develop CPM S30V; the first steel alloy specifically designed for making knife blades from. In terms of cost:benefit ratio, I'd say it's still the best all-round performance steel (and the one I carry every day). There are harder steels, tougher steels, more stain resistant steels, steels that are easier to sharpen... but they all also have drawbacks. Like you said; a lot of the choice is down to the role of the knife... but as a general high quality pocket knife, you don't need anything more than S30V, and as most people do (including everyone for the thousands of years pre-dating S30V), could certainly get by on something not as good.|`|NsLtN7oLaa	I'd just buy from a quality maker and not think<br>  too much about what kind of steel it is... but<br>  then I'm more into the esthetics than function.|`|HTmj2BXDaa	Not familiar with Chris Reeve but be careful of pattern welded Damascus vs "real" Damascus.

These waves move away from the object as sound. There are many forms of the vibration, some not so obvious.<br>  <br>  The back and forth movement of a loudspeaker cone, guitar string or drum head result in compression waves of sound. When you speak, your vocal cords also vibrate, creating sound.<br>  <br>  Blowing across a bottle top can also create sound. In this case, the air inside the bottle goes in a circular motion, resulting in sound waves being formed. Wind blowing through trees can also create sound this indirect way.<br>  <br>  Sound can also be created by vibrating an object in a liquid such as water or in a solid such as iron. A train rolling on a steel railroad track will create a sound wave that travels through the tracks. They will then vibrate, creating sound in air that you can hear, while the train may be a great distance away.<br>  Sound is waveform in matter<br>  Sound is a waveform that travels through matter. Although it is commonly associated in air, sound will readily travel through many materials such as water and steel. Some insulating materials absorb much of the sound waves, preventing the waves from penetrating the material.<br>  <br>  Does not travel in vacuum<br>  Because sound is the vibration of matter, it does not travel through a vacuum or in outer space. When you see movies or TV shows about battles in outer space, you should only be able to see an explosion but not hear it. The sounds are added for dramatic effect.<br>  <br>  Some atoms in space<br>  Note that in outer space, there are actually some widely-spaced atoms and molecules floating around. But since they are so far apart, regular wave motion would not be great enough to detect.<br>  <br>  Sound waves different than light waves<br>  Also note that light and radio waves are electromagnetic waves. They are completely different than sound, which is vibration of matter. Electromagnetic waves are related to electrical and magnetic fields and readily travel through space.<br>  <br>  Sound is a compression wave<br>  The back-and-forth vibration of an object creates the compression waves of sound. The motions of a loudspeaker cone, drumhead and guitar string are good examples of vibration that cause compression waves. This is different than the up and down or transverse motion of a water wave.<br>  <br>  Transverse Wave (water wave)<br>  <br>  Compression Wave (sound)<br>  <br>  The illustration above shows a comparison of a transverse wave such as a water wave and the compression wave sound wave.<br>  <br>  Characteristics of sound<br>  A sound wave has characteristics just like any other type of wave, including amplitude, velocity, wavelength and frequency.<br>  <br>  Amplitude<br>  The amplitude of a sound wave is the same thing as its loudness. Since sound is a compression wave, its loudness or amplitude would correspond to how much the wave is compressed. It is sometimes called pressure amplitude.<br>  <br>  Decibel<br>  A common measurement of loudness is the decibel (dB). It is really 1/10 of a bel, which was named after the inventor of the telephone, Alexander Graham Bell. It is a complex unit that varies as the ratio of the logarithms of loudness.<br>  <br>  Decrease in loudness<br>  A sound wave will spread out after it leaves its source, decreasing its amplitude or loudness. The amplitude decreases as the square of the distance from the source. Also, if there is some absorption in the material, the loudness of the sound will decrease as it moves through the substance.<br>  <br>  Speed or velocity of sound<br>  The speed or velocity of sound in air is approximately 344 meters/second, 1130 feet/sec. or 770 miles per hour at room temperature of 20oC (70oF). The speed varies with the temperature of air, such that sound travels slower at higher altitudes or on cold days.<br>  <br>  Note: The difference between speed and velocity is that velocity usually includes direction the of travel. We'll interchange them here, but in some cases the distinction is important.<br>  <br>  A jet plane traveling at the speed of sound would be moving at about 680 mph at sea level. At very high altitudes, the speed required would be much lower.<br>  <br>  (See Speed of Sound in a Gas for more information.)<br>  <br>  Wavelength<br>  Wavelength is the distance from one crest to another of a wave. Since sound is a compression wave, the wavelength is the distance between maximum compressions.<br>  <br>  Frequency<br>  The frequency of sound is the rate at which the waves pass a given point. It is also the rate at which a guitar string or a loud speaker vibrates. Frequency is also called the pitch of a sound. It is called the note in musical sounds.<br>  <br>  Relationship<br>  The relationship between velocity, wavelength and frequency is:<br>  <br>   velocity = wavelength x frequency<br>  <br>  Since the velocity of sound is approximately the same for all wavelengths, frequency is often used to better describe the effects of the different wavelengths.<br>  <br>  Pitch<br>  The pitch or note of a sound that we experience is determined by its wavelength or its frequency. The shorter the wavelength, the higher|`|2vRXS29iaa	Vibration of an object is what produces sound waves. The vibrating object moves in one direction and compresses the air directly in front of it. As the vibrating object moves in the opposite direction, the pressure on the air is lessened so that an expansion, or rarefaction, of air molecules occurs. One compression and one rarefaction make up one longitudinal wave. The vibrating air molecules move back and forth parallel to the direction of motion of the wave receiving energy from adjacent molecules nearer the source and passing the energy to adjacent molecules farther from the source.

Ftkr9jqYaa	Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is a nucleic acid that contains the genetic instructions used in the development and functioning of all known living organisms and some viruses. The main role of DNA molecules is the long-term storage of information. DNA is often compared to a set of blueprints or a recipe, or a code, since it contains the instructions needed to construct other components of cells, such as proteins and RNA molecules. The DNA segments that carry this genetic information are called genes, but other DNA sequences have structural purposes, or are involved in regulating the use of this genetic information.<br>  <br>  Chemically, DNA consists of two long polymers of simple units called nucleotides, with backbones made of sugars and phosphate groups joined by ester bonds. These two strands run in opposite directions to each other and are therefore anti-parallel. Attached to each sugar is one of four types of molecules called bases. It is the sequence of these four bases along the backbone that encodes information. This information is read using the genetic code, which specifies the sequence of the amino acids within proteins. The code is read by copying stretches of DNA into the related nucleic acid RNA, in a process called transcription.<br>  <br>  Within cells, DNA is organized into structures called chromosomes. These chromosomes are duplicated before cells divide, in a process called DNA replication. Eukaryotic organisms (animals, plants, fungi, and protists) store their DNA inside the cell nucleus, while in prokaryotes (bacteria and archae) it is found in the cell's cytoplasm. Within the chromosomes, chromatin proteins such as histones compact and organize DNA. These compact structures guide the interactions between DNA and other proteins, helping control which parts of the DNA are transcribed.<br>  <br>  DNA is a long polymer made from repeating units called nucleotides.[1][2] The DNA chain is 22 to 26 ?ngstr?ms wide (2.2 to 2.6 nanometres), and one nucleotide unit is 3.3 ? (0.33 nm) long.[3] Although each individual repeating unit is very small, DNA polymers can be very large molecules containing millions of nucleotides. For instance, the largest human chromosome, chromosome number 1, is approximately 220 million base pairs long.[4]<br>  <br>  In living organisms, DNA does not usually exist as a single molecule, but instead as a tightly-associated pair of molecules.[5][6] These two long strands entwine like vines, in the shape of a double helix. The nucleotide repeats contain both the segment of the backbone of the molecule, which holds the chain together, and a base, which interacts with the other DNA strand in the helix. In general, a base linked to a sugar is called a nucleoside and a base linked to a sugar and one or more phosphate groups is called a nucleotide. If multiple nucleotides are linked together, as in DNA, this polymer is called a polynucleotide.[7]<br>  <br>  The backbone of the DNA strand is made from alternating phosphate and sugar residues.[8] The sugar in DNA is 2-deoxyribose, which is a pentose (five-carbon) sugar. The sugars are joined together by phosphate groups that form phosphodiester bonds between the third and fifth carbon atoms of adjacent sugar rings. These asymmetric bonds mean a strand of DNA has a direction. In a double helix the direction of the nucleotides in one strand is opposite to their direction in the other strand. This arrangement of DNA strands is called antiparallel. The asymmetric ends of DNA strands are referred to as the 5′ (five prime) and 3′ (three prime) ends, with the 5' end being that with a terminal phosphate group and the 3' end that with a terminal hydroxyl group. One of the major differences between DNA and RNA is the sugar, with 2-deoxyribose being replaced by the alternative pentose sugar ribose in RNA.[6]<br>  <br>  The DNA double helix is stabilized by hydrogen bonds between the bases attached to the two strands. The four bases found in DNA are adenine (abbreviated A), cytosine (C), guanine (G) and thymine (T). These four bases are attached to the sugar/phosphate to form the complete nucleotide, as shown for adenosine monophosphate.<br>  <br>  These bases are classified into two types; adenine and guanine are fused five- and six-membered heterocyclic compounds called purines, while cytosine and thymine are six-membered rings called pyrimidines.[6] A fifth pyrimidine base, called uracil (U), usually takes the place of thymine in RNA and differs from thymine by lacking a methyl group on its ring. Uracil is not usually found in DNA, occurring only as a breakdown product of cytosine.

vVfH8yBYaa	Is it rigorous? Yes. Is it time consuming? Yes. But the time it consumes is limited. You work shifts. Different institutions have developed a variety of schedules, but they are all based on a 36-40 hour work week. Yes, nurses sometimes end up working longer hours, either because there are just not enough hours in a day to get all the work done that you need to do, or because you are "mandatoried."<br>  To be "mandatoried" means that there is an acute nursing shortage in your hospital. If you leave, there won't be enough nurses to work the next shift, and they (for lack of a better word) "force" you to stay and work the extra shift. Yes, it sucks. No, it's not the end of the world. And usually they will pay you time-and-a-half to do it.<br>  <br>  I love being a nurse. It pays well, though we will always argue that we're not payed what we're worth because we work our a**es off. But the work is incredibly rewarding, and you'll never find another career like it. It is your opportunity to enter into the lives of other people at their most vulnerable moments. For me, those connections are sacred moments. It is incredibly humbling.<br>  <br>  Also, remember that a lot of what you hear about the rigors of nursing come from people in hospitals, long term acute care, and nursing homes. There are definitely loads of opportunities for nurses outside of these institutions. I work in an outpatient oncology clinic. I have regular hours, leave on time, and get paid quite a bit more than I ever did in the hospital.|`|ZDMjuf4Taa	the law states that you can only work a certain amount of hours per week no matter what career you are in, in the uk we do a 37and half hours per week  on a shift basis, our shifts are early shift 7.30 - 3pm  afternoon shift 1.30 -9 pm night shift 8.45 pm - 7.45 am . i did this whilst raising two young children, so if you really want this career go for it

All of the remaining radioactive isotopes have half-lives that are shorter than 8.6 ms. The shortest-lived isotope of lithium is 4Li which decays through proton emission and has a half-life of 7.58043x10-23 s.<br>  <br>  7Li is one of the primordial elements or, more properly, primordial isotopes, produced in Big Bang nucleosynthesis (a small amount of 6Li is also produced in stars).[11] Lithium isotopes fractionate substantially during a wide variety of natural processes, including mineral formation (chemical precipitation), metabolism, and ion exchange. Lithium ion substitutes for magnesium and iron in octahedral sites in clay minerals, where 6Li is preferred to 7Li, resulting in enrichment of the light isotope in processes of hyperfiltration and rock alteration. The exotic 11Li is known to exhibit a nuclear halo.|`|nXSpS3Axaa	2 stable isotopes- Li-6 (7.5% abundance) and Li-7 (92.5% abundance).<br>  <br>  <br>  7 radioisotopes<br>  <br>  <br>  Naturally lithium contains two stable isotopes 6Li and 7Li. 7Li is the most abundantly in the nature taking up about 92.5% of the natural abundance. There are seven radioisotopes , with 8Li being the most stable with a half-life’s that is less the 8.6ms. The isotope with the shortest life time is the isotope 4Li, because it decays very rapidly and has a life time of 7.58043x10-23 s. The most unstable isotope is the 11Li. This is so unstable that it has a nuclear halo of two neutrons.<br>  <br>  Lithium is used in the making of batteries. The reason why lithium is used in batteries is because of its lightweight and being capable of creation twice as much power then a standard dry cell battier of 1.5v. <br>  <br>  Lithium plays a big role in medical field. Lithium carbonate, lithium citrate, and lithium orotate are used in the treatment of bipolar disorder. The benefit of using lithium salt is that they treat both mania and depression unlike the traditional treatments. Lithium also has the capability to use as a treatment in migraine disease and cluster headaches. <br>  <br>  Lithium is also use in 7up, and hundreds of other soft drinks and in a few beers.|`|AFJtFhEOaa	There are two that are stable, Li-6 and Li-7.

EbxMItf8aa	There is not a simple way of explaining this without knowing how much you already understand, so I will try to do it from the very beginning, and I apologise if I appear to insult your intelligence.<br>  <br>  I don't know what you mean by '1' table, but  I presume that you have got a table of some kind.<br>  <br>  You presumably know that the Normal Distribution refers to a 'bell-shaped' curve, and that probabilities are given by the area underneath the curve up to a vertical line which is called a z-value.  The zero point (z = 0) is the mid-point of the horizontal scale, which corresponds to the highest point of the curve.<br>  <br>  It is these areas which are listed in the table, and because the curve is perfectly symmetrical, the table often lists only the areas of one half of the curve;  the figures are exactly the same in the other half, but you have to deduce the figure you want from a knowledge of the distribution.<br>  <br>  Somewhere in the margin of the table, or at the top or bottom of the table, there should be a small diagram which shows a shaded portion of the curve, showing you exactly what the figures refer to.<br>  <br>  From your question, I think that the table to which you refer shows only the right-hand half of the curve, with positive z-values only, which start at 0 and go up to about 5 or 6.<br>  <br>  The area under the complete curve is 1, therefore the area of one-half is 0.5, so for a z-value of 0 your table will show an area (or probability) of 0.5; this is because the area of the left-hand half of the curve, from a z-value of -6 up to 0, accounts for 0.5 of the area, so when you go upwards from 0 you are adding to the 0.5 which is in the lower half of the curve.<br>  <br>  If you look at the tabulated value corresponding to a z-value of 1.0 (which is obviously what the figures in your question refer to) you find the value 0.84.  This is the area under the curve from the left-hand tail of the curve (z = -6 or so) up to the value z = 1.<br>  <br>  Since the area from -6 up to 0 is 0.5, then the area between the z-values 0 and 1 must be 0.84 - 0.5 = 0.34.<br>  <br>  And since the curve is symmetrical about the value z = 0, the area between the values z = -1 and z = 0 is also 0.34.<br>  <br>  And if you wanted to find the area (or the probability) from z = -6 up to z = -1, you can do it in one of two ways.  We have just seen that the area from -1 to 0 is 0.34;  since the area from -6 up to 0 is 0.5, then the area less than z = -1 is just 0.5 - 0.34  = 0.16.<br>  <br>  Alternatively, looking at the figures in the table, you want the value for z less than -1, but you are compelled to look at the value for z = 1 (which is 0.84), which gives you the area right from -6 up to +1.<br>  <br>  And since the area of the whole curve is 1, then the area beyond z = 1, and up to z = 6 must be 1 - 0.84  = 0.16.  This, then is the area of the right-hand tail of the curve.  And since it is symmetrical, then it is also the area of the left-hand tail of the curve, from -6 up to -1.<br>  <br>  So if you wanted to find the area corresponding to a z-value of -1, you would look up the value for z = 1, and then do the subtraction, and that is what the rather curt (and, I agree, very confusing) sentence in your question is trying to say.|`|3h1D6Jkcaa	Okay, here's the most mathematically correct explanation I can give...<br>  <br>  The probability listed is the probability that a z-score is less than 1 (or in other words, that a normally-distributed variable is lower than 1 standard deviation above the mean). That is, the probability that any score is lower than 1 standard deviation above the mean is 0.840.<br>  <br>  This means that the probability of being higher than one standard deviation ABOVE the mean is 1 - 0.840 = 0.160, right? (Since the probability that it is SOMEWHERE is 1!)<br>  <br>  Now, by the symmetry of the normal curve, the probability of being higher than one standard deviation above the mean is exactly the same as the probability of being lower than one standard deviation below the mean. (In each case, we're taking the tail that goes from one SD away from the mean out to infinity.)<br>  <br>  Therefore, the probability of having a score lower than one standard deviation below the mean is 0.160. And that is what it means to say that the number listed under -1 in a z-score (or standard normal) table is 0.160.<br>  <br>  §

B8IPlF8Baa	Like all triangles, a right triangle has three sides.  The two that aren't the hypoteneuse may be called "legs".  If a leg touches -- i.e., shares a vertex with -- and angle, it is called "adjacent". If it doesn't, then it's sort of on the other end of the triangle, and it's called "opposite".<br>  <br>  As for your question, the tangent of theta is (35,000 feet/150 miles). Taking that ratio is easy if you remember there are 5,280 feet/mile.  And if you know the tan of an angle, you can figure out the angle itself on your calculator.<br>  <br>  The only tricky part is figuring out whether theta is the tangent or cotangent. To see that, figure out which of the angles in the triangle itself equals theta, and which equals 90 degrees minus theta.

X0e6p9Ilaa	This chemistryis used to test for the presence of silver ion in a mixture of cations.  Particularly it is referred to as the "Group 1 analysis."<br>  <br>  Group 1 consists of Ag+, Pb2+ and Hg2^2+ ions.  All of these form insoluble chlorides and can be separated from other metals ions this way.<br>  <br>  Silver chloride is insoluble in water.  Silver chloride is soluble in a solution of ammonia, which is slightly basic, and it forms the silver diamine complex ion, Ag(NH3)2^+.   At this point in the qualitative analysis steps, the silver is separated from mercury which is solid by pouring off the solution containing the silver diamine ions.<br>  <br>  To confirm the presence of silver, the solution is acidified with an acid (not HCl), and the ammonia goes into solution as ammonium ion and the silver ion recombines with chloride ion to make solid AgCl.<br>  <br>  Ag+ + Cl-  --> AgCl(s)<br>  AgCl(s) + 2NH3 --> Ag(NH3)2+ + Cl-<br>  Ag(NH3)2+ + 2H+ --> Ag+ + 2NH4+<br>  Ag+ + Cl- --> AgCl(s)<br>  <br>  AgCl dissolves in ammonia because the NH3 separates the AgCl into ions better than do water molecules.<br>  <br>  When acid is added, the H+ combine with NH3 to make NH4+ and go into solution, leaving the Ag+ as an "exposed" ion.  Since chloride ion is still present, the Ag+ recombines with Cl- to make AgCl.  This is the confirming test for silver.

dKZmxct3aa	Well you take the number of degrees and divide by 360 since there are 360 degrees in a circle. So, if one section of the pie graph is 72 degrees then 72/360 = 0.2<br>  Now, to convert the decimal to a percent, you times the decimal by 100%. So, 0.2 x 100% = 20% <br>  <br>  Therefore, 72 degrees is 20% of the total pie graph.<br>  <br>  Hope this Helps!!!|`|KdxyjD5Oaa	Well just equal 100% to 360 Deg.<br>  Soo like 50% would be 180 Deg<br>  25% would be 90 Deg<br>  1% = 3.6 Deg<br>  Hope it helps!|`|jtvwdga8aa	You just use the fact that there are 360 degrees in a circle.  So the angle of a one wedge of the pie divided by 360 gives the percentage.
q1QyM0Kzaa	What do you mean in relation to science fiction creatures?<br>  <br>  They're a lot like an occasionally colonial minute freshwater sea anemone. They're cnidarians, same group as jellyfish, corals and sea anemones. "primitive" animals - have undergone blastulation but not gastrulation, so they quite eating and pooing both happen through the same hole. <br>  <br>  If you were looking for a many-headed monster, try the planarian worms. they're the ones that if you cut down the middle of their head, both halves regenerate, and you get two heads. The record stands at one with seventeen heads, I think.
