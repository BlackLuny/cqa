6V8QH9sHaa	First of all, dont say your MIL doesnt like dogs. She obviously wouldnt let the dogs live there if she didnt. However, as a mature adult, try talking to her to see if there is a way you can resolve the issue you feel you are having. She may surprise you with what she has to say. She has opened her home and her family up to you. Remember its only a TEMPORARY SITUATION. try to make the best of it :)|`|pKzH1cFHaa	Here is a problem solver. MOVE OUT! Until then, it is her house, her rules. If you need to leave without your husband, then do it. Don't say you can't do it, because if you sell things and give up some comforts, you can.|`|u4liwDhAaa	Unfortunately, everybody is right.  This is her house and you need to obey house rules as long as you live there.    Move!      This is coming from a dog person.|`|Vp1Wzu07aa	You are living at her house. She is right. It is your responsibility to make sure this woman isn't near your dogs. Do whatever is necessary to keep your dogs away. If that means keep them inside, or tie them up, then do it. It is your fault that you are allowing your dogs to be mistreated by her.|`|0HUHHzIQaa	It's her house. She's letting you live there. TIE UP YOUR DOGS.
onAEy5jTaa	Ignore him for a week! He'll realize that he misses you and he'll probably apologize. It's happened with my mother. In the end, she begged me to speak to her. Picking on the younger sibling is kind of the way to show love... a weird way..... But try the silent treatment, even though it's a bit childish. It works! Hope I helped!|`|SLeX0gGaaa	Haha. I have almost that same situation. But the things he tells me to do only benfit him. Like cleaning his room and stuff. So I just keep my distance now. It seems to be helping somewhat.|`|YZez6mheaa	Ignore him. Pretend like you don't have a brother. Dont even breathe a word ot him. Or say ok i will later. But try to keep your distance. Like if you two are home alone together, go and do stuff in your room.
afcLu9YMaa	So the exchange rate would give you 3,500.     Twin room in a hotel with breakfast for two of you for two weeks in Manchester City would be upwards of 800.    Meals in pubs, cafes and restaurants from about 7.50, fast food: Fish and chips 5.00, McDonald's basic burger 1.00, Kebab 3.30, Pizza 5.00    Great night clubs and pubs    You should have a good time!    www.visitmanchester.com     www.tripadvisor.com/Attractions-g18706...    www.worldtravelguide.net/city/74/night...    www.whathappenedlastnight.net/|`|bznQW3QYaa	5 THOUSAND!  yes that enough for 2 weeks lol x]  have a nice holiday|`|wNSI1wdCaa	$5000 is about  3493. I would say that's enough!!
afcLu9YMaa	People grow up , change, grow apart!    The vast majority of friends have a 'shelf' life like most other things.    I have several friends, Bronze, Silver and Gold friends, all are valuable, some more valuable than others and sometimes they change.....or I do!    Just value the friends for who they are, as you would hope they would do for you (or your friends girl friends, friends)
lFQiiR0Baa	Lack of respect. Nosey people. They really make me lose my temper.|`|4ZGriYvGaa	friends who lie and get mad if you dont believe them. and then later on when you find out the truth they act like it was no big deal that they lied and dont care how they made you feel    friends who play with your emotions and dont really act like friends at all after a while. and dont even care how you feel. after a 6 year friendship!
Q0HxSMafaa	he could just be metro sexual, which means that he has the characteristics of a gay guy, but he's straight.|`|wYTDwWnEaa	If they ask questions like this|`|eQPy6KP2aa	No, it's not mean to think it. If he acts it he probably is.|`|EAYv4SCXaa	You know what>> I couldnt say.... but i have had my suspicions of some people too. And of course i am not against gay people. I think they are the nicest honest people you can talk too. And thats when I start thinking of the nicest person in the world being really gay.. So I couldnt tell ya if the person was gay or not. What does it really matter if the guy is gay anyway..............|`|mZklJSfqaa	i would have to say that you are .. i kno many straight men who act girly at times.
v5ndavEqaa	Wow! I think that wedding gown is very pretty. It is very simple too. It gives people a look that says, I can be beautiful without all this gaudy design. You know? I love it!! It's amazing!|`|tvUAO4ioaa	This dress is very pretty, and although I don't have one to suggest, please know that we had one like this in my shop and my seamstress and I spent 3 days trying to figure out a way to make it bustle without destroying any fabric and we never were able to find a solution. That tulle is actually a silk netting and gives the illusion of light and flowy, but is very heavy. Just be careful to find something without a train if you choose that material.|`|CI4oAV0oaa	Beautiful  I like simple wedding dresses that still look elegant and special.  I like this one too, if you want to look for fun|`|5d9211d38d6935bc0d08850b222ec434aa	That is a Christos gown...I'm sure of it. Course, you probably don't want to be paying Christos prices, right?     It is lovely though...if you can pull off a strapless. I am sure the fabric feels like an angel's robe, though...when you have something that coutre, you would have the most delicious fabric. :)|`|66tpufsgaa	i like it|`|ccb7dfcb93436cc2dc1e0b5f23a146e3aa	It is beautiful! Congratulations.|`|afkygHMgaa	It is pretty.....it is "taffetta and tulle"|`|d62310b3e25bb263db275c523c9cfe86aa	This material looks like organza. Organza basically looks/feels just like you described- a cross between silk/satin and tulle. Try searching for organza dresses, it is a popular wedding dress material. You will find silk organza, satin organza, and sometimes an organza overlay (usually over satin). It also comes in "sparkle" which makes the material shimmery.  http://www.amykuschel.com/gowns/gowns_ma...  http://www.bridalonlinestore.com/Collect...|`|NmtgziADaa	I do like it a lot even tho I am anti-strapless. but it will look gorgeous.|`|a8uM21jyaa	One word. GEORGOUS! Hope you have the wedding you've dreamt of =]|`|5f128396df7759d37e252f9ad5e76f75aa	Beautiful.
MOCpSQkVaa	I think we should confront to her and tell her how we felt and tell that she doesn't have to be so mean and save spots and tell her that she can make new friends also!!  hope i helped! -lee la|`|YqoxcTN9aa	just ignore it & sit there anyways, eventually she will get over it
h0oceAwAaa	umm i would get a glove, and finger her i guess if i was you. cuz put something in a condom to make more like a penis and stick it in her lol. or use like a hand massager and put it by her vagina. thats all i can think of|`|kC6iAMDJaa	me and a friend tried that a few times, we were both virgins so we never stuck anything in. We did touch and had oral sex. We watched movies.
ELSKfMpxaa	Long distance relationships can work out. But you have to work at them. It's all about communication as there's nothing physical to stand on. So if you have air between your ears (I believe the word you were looking for was interested not instructed by the way) the likelihood of a long distance relationship working is pretty slim. But if you have two intelligent people its possible.|`|toLCaFc9aa	I tried one once and I knew the guy from before, I mean personally, but them I moved out of the country. Believe me, they don't work. Plus you are young and should be seeing the girls in your school.|`|fyyfPEemaa	LDR's work =D<br>  <br>  i'm fifteen ;)<br>  <br>  e-mail mee.?|`|74gPuaXMaa	They don't work. And you don't have satisfaction from seeing them physically. Can't kiss, hug, touch, sleep with, cuddle, etc... Don't do it man. It's a waste of time and emotions.|`|f75x8aI3aa	Why don't you just find a girl in your own hometown? =/|`|XlhBBZPxaa	they take a LOT OF trust|`|gtINkA19aa	i'm 15 and have a myspace too, email me if you wanna chat|`|EDYETUNCaa	Long distance relationships normally work if you know the person well and/or dated them previous to long distance. Such as my bf and I dated in person for five months before he left for school, my roommate dated 3 mos in person, and my friend's brother dated a year before they dated long distance (my roommate is now engaged and my friend's brother is now married to the girl). <br>  <br>  Besides you're little young to want to do the whole long distance bit. Especially on here. You never know what kinds of people you could be, who could be lying to you about themselves because you know know nothing really about them. <br>  <br>  Play it safe ... why don't you try to date a girl in person instead. Like at school or from church or other activities you're involved in.|`|e2eabfcbd8bf3fdebe6d842f47ed3764aa	long distance relationships work for long-term only if it involves real love. short term relationships that work at long distance, are simply booty calls. lol, However, if you truly love someone, you will find that distance and time only bring u and whoever it is, closer and more in love.|`|tRMwKXQdaa	dude don't try to find girls online that's dangerous you don't know who your really talking to you could think your talking to some girl and it could end up being some 40 year old creepy guy|`|xCfHnQBbaa	If you are so good looking than why don't you date local girls?|`|0eNowNixaa	im 15. email me.|`|642d31f48073a651ec790aef08754fe9aa	dont work|`|QhNI9ZIwaa	not worth it...ur too young to be doing long distance...remain friends and see how it is between u when ur together again|`|YlAPLmvcaa	hey :)<br>  if u are good looking & young i say don't consider a long distance relationship<br>  they don't work out due to the single fact that you two don't spend any time together (obviously!!)<br>  <br>  and you can put your life in danger because there are bad people out there who can track you down and do bad things to you (there are countless of cases)<br>  <br>  you can have an extra myspace account but they get information from you, and even hack into your computer..<br>  i say you forget about that, and since your young, nice and good looking, just have REAL friends and love will come to you eventuallyy:)<br>  <br>  good luck :D|`|lhmdSgqtaa	they can work!<br>  don't listen to all these people talking about how they don't work out.<br>  it'll be hard, and you'll both have to work at it -but it CAN work if you really want it too!<br>  <br>  but don't get into a long-distance relationship if your not willing to really put in the effort. its not fair to the other person.<br>  and definitely don't do one just to try it.  we don't want anyone to get hurt -right?|`|F9Uz05FXaa	It probably wouldn't work out unless you could be together at least once a week or so.|`|RN7NzeCsaa	they don't workout|`|J79ecFcPaa	oh dat **** dnt work trust me...its a waste of time haha|`|bC8r2YTCaa	they don't work and its kinda creppy
VDKVy4A3aa	That just means that you would be a good gf for any other guy, but that you just wouldn't work out with him.|`|UtrgRjTeaa	It means he sees your worth and that you're a great person, attractive and all, and that you just don't "fit" him.    This happens, and it sucks. But the point is that just because you and he aren't working out doesn't mean that you're unattractive or that you're "broken" somehow.|`|rgX3fhjlaa	If he is getting away from you than he is trying to let you down easy            Sorry:(|`|xFk5DVUEaa	It dose mean that yr not for him but any other guy would be lucky to have you.....|`|YI7xsvGYaa	he's not into you, but doesn't want to hurt your feelings. sounds like a sensitive type.|`|3KDj8v6Paa	Several possibilities:    1)  He could be trying to protect you from some aspect of his personality that he considers to be malicious or dangerous.  To be able to break up with you for this reason, he must like you a lot.  Not extremely likely, but possible.    2)  He doesn't like you(like that) and does not want to be with you, but he doesn't want you to feel offended.    3)  He doesn't want t be with you and is trying to tell you that you do not need him, that there are more fish in the sea.    4)  He does not like you, but he also does not think you are worthless.  Quite possible.    5)  He likes you, but not enough to go out with you.    6)  He likes you, but thinks that you may be happier with someone else.    Hope this helps!|`|FUQ0sJNaaa	it means like "watsup bro"|`|IaX9xTcIaa	its a better way of saying "its not you its me" but by saying any guy would love to be with you he's hoping to not hurt you too bad . He wants you to still feel confident in who you are even though he broke up with you.|`|3JfADTIDaa	It means "You're not for me, but I don't want you to think you're worthless."|`|JGxemN3waa	he is trying to spare your feelings.    He's just not that into you
jRSzIzYqaa	It's courtship. Plain and simple. They do it to impress though going dutch is becoming more and more trendy I actually prefer the guy to at least offer to pay. Picking up your half of the tab, though old fashion, seems like you are rebuking a guy's advances. It's just one of those things, like opening doors and killing bugs that guys do.|`|tCiVuFK9aa	If a guy can't afford to take me out, he shouldn't ask.  If I ask him that would be different.  But then again I've never had to ask a man out. Nor have I ever went out with a man who had to worry about who pays.<br>  Red|`|ja7J2cE2aa	Tradition, I guess.  Besides, aren't we all trying to impress the ladies by saying we've got loads of the m4d c4$h anyway?  What better way to show it than paying for dinner?|`|yv3unx5Eaa	Double standards go both ways.|`|944e2748d03e1efff042dce931e63f28aa	You are clearly not my ex-boyfriend.|`|Is3pmbbKaa	Cuz women do all the work around the house while their lazyass husbands are sitting around doing nothing except maybe sit in an office in front of a computer for only 7 hours a day.|`|oojO4WAraa	I insist on paying half the time with my bf, with my brother, with who ever I go out with.   Guess you are picking the wrong women.|`|UADLdXBtaa	Tradition I guess. Whenever we go out to a restaurant, my boyfriend usually foots the bill, but whenever I make dinner for us at his place, I always buy the groceries and everything for the meal. Since we don't really go out that much, I'd say I probably spend more money on our relationship than he does! If we go to a movie or something we each pay our own way or take turns paying each time we go.|`|8vfCRg7Caa	no my friends are all women and we dont care about bills. In real life somebody might be broke or may not get payed at time, waiting on taxes, had to pay some bills that just showed up or simply just spent too much last night. I will pay for the bill or we both will or they might just cover me for the time being. We dont play all that deal coverage over money. Money is a big deal but its not bigger than our friendship. I would spend my last dollar on my friend. Sorry i was raised that way. And i dont expect the same favor back.|`|ADP9swbMaa	I always offer to pay half, or everything if it's a special occasion for him (his birthday, a new job, etc). <br>  However, many men still feel like they should pay the entire bill out of courtesy, etiquette, tradition, etc.|`|R46f2nn9aa	To be a gentleman!!!|`|OsuvvU68aa	not always.|`|AA12107238	Because normally it is the man asking, if the woman were to ask the man out then she should pay.|`|czzDYbI4aa	uh oh, they are gonna tear you to shreads man! Never question women!! It is equal when it suits!! But dont expect them to open any pickle jars on their own anytime soon!|`|bXGwTQy6aa	to treat a girl special and make her feel wanted,protected and loved...its not about the money,its the gesture|`|74gPuaXMaa	It's not a dependency issue.

They dont.|`|f7f0fd5f021b5d1e4672cdbda2a11ffeaa	Hmmm nope, that is a huge incorrect generalization! <br>  If men are so enlightened these days how come most of them still don't know how to operate a washing machine? Or change a diaper? See, it goes both ways.... when my bf and i go out sometimes I pay sometimes he pays.. and it's not a big issue for us.|`|0fVtHNtmaa	I think the woman should pay every other date|`|00390bee0bdfb56e0334bd2845fadd9aaa	the disparity of pay, men still make more|`|jrWpHYAPaa	if you like the girl, it's called being a gentleman and then maybe you'll hit the jackpot later that night ;)<br>  Otherwise if you're friends you should pay seperate bills right?|`|XlhBBZPxaa	well its tradition but I handle and pay all the bills at my house|`|rJgrwIodaa	Because guys date women who look pretty, but have no sense of self.  A woman with sense of self has self worth, meaning she will offer to pay at least half the time.|`|D9AUzmZRaa	Probably the same reason that .000004 percent of men help with the running of the home, even when both spouses have fulltime jobs.|`|NAqfPvmHaa	its always 50/50, the only time i think a guy should ever pay is on the first date thats just kinda whats expected, but i think after that take it in turns or go 50/50|`|vhlORK4Waa	Not when they're out with me they don't  - strictly 50/50 or if we're friends and we eat out or go out a lot, we take turn about.<br>  <br>  Red|`|RuOTJLyvaa	It's traditionally more polite|`|u7Vp848Oaa	Because its polite and they are acting like gentlemen!|`|gtINkA19aa	It's more polite for them to do so, and it's just understood that way to most people...|`|jpiVHAN5aa	to answer that question you would have to be sexist, but yet everything these days is sexist to men, with very few daring to say so. for example men cannot hit women but if women are equal then why can we not hit them back. but on the woman's side, if men and women are "equal" which physically they quite clearly are not (on average) why cant they play AFL??? We foot the bill to show our dominance, if a women undermined that you would not feel the woman as a suitable "mate" for lack of a better word.|`|LdRAsccPaa	because it common courtesy|`|tZG4tntRaa	I'm 50/50 with guys I always offer to pay like even for the whole thing but for some reason if the guy doesn't pay for me it is like a real big turn off, not a gold digger its just sexy that the guy can afford to take you out and I have been told by some guys that they don't feel like the man when the girl pays.|`|lhmdSgqtaa	a lot of guys out there haven't excepted women being so independent and don't WANT the girl to pay the bill.<br>  <br>  and sometimes- its just being polite! I'm a girl- and when I go out places with people I'm always willing and prepared to pay my own way but seriously? if someone WANTS to pay for you just because- why wouldn't we let them?! lol|`|AJIbmIDaaa	Women appreciate the gesture. It shows that you are a gentlemen. In a woman's eyes that shows that you are able and willing to take care of her. I do believe however that women should pick up the tab sometimes too. It shows that she just doesn't like you because you can give her what she wants.|`|92HoC2OWaa	hospitalty and they dont want 2 or he never asked|`|b7jWXN4Vaa	I KNOW! I'M A GIRL AND I WAS TALKING TO MY GUY FRIENDS ABOUT HOW STUPID GIRLS ARE. they think that they are too special to have to pay because the men have been doing it for years. but, whatever. i'm not complaining. haha|`|HpwevWYlaa	Listen, women these days are NOT independent. Women were independent in the 1930s, 40s, and the like. Today, women are just spoiled brats.|`|lqG3SQ40aa	It shows that they are gentlemen,it shows that u care! Some things just never go away!|`|g09x06Zpaa	mostly because guys are stupid enough to pay the bill..<br>  <br>  call it a case of 'A Class Suckers'<br>  <br>  I mean hey, if you're going to pay the bill, who am I to argue?|`|XdUL0PXmaa	Because then it's a win-win situation.|`|NvQETTJKaa	my best guess is its just tradition<br>  but dont stereotype, not all girls expect that from a guy<br>  i ALWAYS offer to pay (even just for me) when i go out with my boyfriend|`|bC8r2YTCaa	it traditionally that way.. also it gentlemen like|`|5UEugyzvaa	The guy has to be nice to the girl, because then it wont work out, guys CANT be cheap
wJ1v0cX0aa	find the job. Your kids are grown enough to stay on their own for a couple of hours. You can then enjoy them at night and on week-ends. If they were 2, 3 or 8 years old i would understand but now they are almost independent and are surely able to cope. At worst, you can give an allowance to the 19 year old to watch over them if you worry so much.|`|C2olZsNiaa	Get a second job.  I know it will be hard not having as much time for your boys as usual but sometimes you have to sacrifice to survive.  They are pretty much old enough to handle it and will undertand.

I'm sure it will go a lot smoother and she will feel more inclined to go on a date with you if her friends recommend you. This is how my parents got married! They were set up by friends.

Tell her you want to get to know her and ask her our for a movie or dinner, your choice.

Go with your instincts bro. it you feel something is too stalkerish or something, don't do it.|`|vLEZ6fFLaa	well, go to her work place, the first time, just pass her and give her a smile(: <br>  then next time, go up to her and ask for her name.<br>  then after that ask her if she's busy on the weekend if she fancies goin' to town or a walk or summin [;<br>  good luck bab.<br>  xo.
BNNzCqhIaa	Don't worry about sounding like a 'kid that complains' you have every reason in the world to. You are 15- you shouldn't be responsible for your family. I know that you probably care a lot about your siblings and your parents in some sense but it is healthy that you are realizing they are not your responsibility. The problem with getting out is your age. I was in similar shoes as you at your age and I lined everything up and was out of the house at 17. Legally, you can't move out until you prove financial independence and stability. I would recommend busying yourself with activities that will keep you out of the house as much as possible. Work on getting a job and if you are not allowed to because of State laws or what not, volunteer somewhere. I started volunteering everywhere a ranch, an animal shelter, a domestic violence shelter, anywhere I could get away. Believe me, in jobs you find/ volunteer work, you will find more support than you can imagine. Connect with the school and they can offer resources to help you and your siblings. I'm weary of the Child Protective Services system so I wouldn't turn to them unless it started getting really abusive. Your family is in a mess and you are the only one with a solid head. If you just go until you are out of high school you will be free to get out of there and be your own person- probably much more mature than anyone your age. I hope this helps. If you need more support always feel free to email me. Best of luck.|`|UADLdXBtaa	If you have a friend whose family you feel will accept you and you can trust, see about living with them. You could get an after school job to help them out with bills and groceries and you could also carry over your mad yard work skills. I'm sure they would appreciate that. The other thing you have to think about is your little sisters. How would they be affected if you weren't around?|`|NDFN04sqaa	Your a kid - not much you can do.  You will get through it just fine.  Just concentrate on how your life will be different and setting goals for yourself.  If you focus on your future it could be enough of a distraction to get you through the times you are frustrated.|`|Plu6OVoGaa	Just stay and deal (that's what I'm doing). Eventually, you'll have the means to move out. Get a job as soon as you can so you'll have money when the time comes. Or you could do great in school and go away for college in 3 years.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|mx7FINY8aa	Move Out ... Duhhhh|`|7gH7sgi6aa	Try your best to make the best of it with the family you have been given.  Trust me, there is NO perfect family, and even the ones you think are happy really aren't.  You only have a couple more years and then you can move out on your own.<br>  Get more involved with a hobby you like, or perhaps music.  Throw and immerse yourself into it.  Ignore the people around you who bother you the most. Find things to do within your school that have after school activities likes groups that will take up even more time.  Anything that just takes you away from what pains you the most and gives you some "you" time to develop.<br>  Before you know it you'll be old enough to hold a job and legally move out. Then you can decide on how you want to handle the relationships of those in your family.  Good luck!!<br>  Peace, Love & Happiness|`|CuWjsHM2aa	well if you are living in an unsafe environment then call the proper authorities and if the find that your parents are unfit then you and your siblings will be removed. <br>  <br>  if that is not an option, are there any other relatives that you can live with? an aunt or uncle or cousin?<br>  <br>  if my 1st two suggestions don't work then you will have to suck it up until you are 18. at that point you will be an adult and you can be on  your own. just make sure you have a job and a place to stay before you move out.
YiGSPWHRaa	Well my dear, your BF has a curiousity that he wants to follow...let him go for it.  And if he likes it enough to leave you, then so be it.

Kycb8YH0aa	Okayyy. This has never happened to me but I believe you are suppose to tell him, "Silly rabbit Trix's are for kids!!!"Then he should start to disintegrate but to speed this up tell him that Dorothy is drowning and she is dying.

odQewFgvaa	bad news.. you are asking for trouble.|`|F3VjJAdiaa	is it a sports or all guys hang out party? or a hey look at me i'm married and want to find a girl anyway party? it all depends. married people go out with their friends all the time though, so it shouldn't be an issue unless you are up to no good|`|WAEDIWz8aa	r u a grown up man with a kids mind?|`|7BkbvD7Zaa	JUST TELL HER.    If she doesn't accept that, than go other wise. She is your wife but she doesn't own/control you.    That's all I can really say.    Good Luck!|`|iXSoX6Rnaa	Whats the reason behind you not wanting your women to go with you? Maybe an ex girlfriend would be there? wrong of you to not want you life partner to be there with you. i'd understand if it was a guys night out or something. Maybe you really need to question if you want to be married or be living the single life.|`|t0uIgY08aa	um..... seriously>? WTF are you thinking... ask her to go. if she doesn't say ok. if you don't wanna go then i'm going... but still you should have invited her.|`|YiGSPWHRaa	Question to you is..why on earth would you not want to go with your wife?|`|AA12164378	Don't give an excuse. She's going to find out eventually. Tell her and maybe she'll let you go. Or maybe just invite her along.|`|Slr6jtMGaa	You're a loser.....why don't you take your wife......it's not like she's your crazy girlfriend or something......GET REAL|`|02d1d745da295236aab562739655324daa	how about taking her with you, and then you wont cheat on her like it sounds u are planning to do, or just dont go at all|`|mnowZhZYaa	WHY NOT TAKE UR WIFE WITH U?

pnxEgqQuaa	Ask him. You have to confront him about this if its really bothering you. Maybe he just is going through a tough time. Or maybe he  could feeling something about you. Good Luck|`|AA10471659	You could ask one of his friends that you know too. There are times when something we do, hurts someone with no intention of hurting them. You should find the basis of why he is mad, through a friend as the boy in question will probably give you a load of crap instead of telling you. It is so strange at times that you get somebody mad at you. And there are no clues why.  Good luck|`|420b488758fd919f03fd6da33dbabf9baa	Just talk to him and see what the deal is, he may not hate you lol|`|MYbRICxqaa	Think you do know what you did or what he did wrong?|`|KW77oNWraa	maybe he heard a rumor? i would say if you really are interested in him ask him what he thinks about you. and dont be worried if he tells you he'll think about it first and tell you later thats probably a good thing|`|kQA7SbY9aa	Did you ask him what happened? Did he actually say he hates you?     You need to talk to him or write him a letter. If he won't explain, he's not worth your time. Then you leave him alone.|`|U1e7wJgYaa	find out what  did to hurt his feelings and try to make things right or maybe he is just not into u|`|9uI3hvGdaa	move on.|`|yktlEbZeaa	well try to talk to him because he may be mad if he saw u flirting with another boy or if he became really popular and he may just be trying to make a scene.|`|aoaqVMKAaa	ask him if somethings wrong if there issay im sorry hope we can be atleast friends again and wait 4 an ansewr walk away and say k im sorry 4 wat i did|`|FLZaCrF9aa	first you could try talking to him and find out why he hates you if that doesn't work you could buy him a hammock of cake if that doesn't work hate him back and if that doesn't work kiss him|`|4cd6c2676e153ff5f86ecd5293cdd12caa	From experience... he has either 1.) heard something awful about you 2.)   is possibly playing hard to get or 3.) just plain mean. If he heard something awful about you, and he believed it without asking you first, then don't even bother with him. He could possibly like you more than a friend and can't cope just yet. Or he's just plain dumb, and being immature...|`|lXgCj1RJaa	Without knowing more this is only a wild guess but...You were "friends", so presumably you weren't an item. Chances are the guy fancies you and doesn't think you fancy him, so he "hates" you as an act of self defence. (This is known technically among grown ups as "stupid", grown ups in this context meaning adult women; guys never grow up I'm afraid.)|`|rAGXa6Iraa	i think you should talk to him, you never know !! he might like you back!!! he is probably shy or something!!    never give up on someome :( i did it and i regret it!!|`|GbF7pqQDaa	Ask him if u did anything worng and if so wat did u do? Try 2 straighten things out.|`|3L4fPlpmaa	tell one of ur friends to ask him what he thinks of u.|`|AA11600596	honestly show him what he is missing out on.. sometimes that really does work... what was your relationship status when he didnt "hate" you???|`|du69aF03aa	How do you know he hates you...maybe you just think he does

Sorry.|`|ZpR57jbBaa	alright this is what i do. you have to think ahead of her. just hide your stuff where she wouldnt look.  and like if you have a bad grade throw it away. if you reads your text messages. have them auto deleted. y'know stuff like that and that will burn her up!|`|lc51V6EAaa	tell her to give u space|`|OD3hxWxvaa	oh god, you're not alone.    be like stop its none of your business    or go through her stuff.. lol that would b awesome|`|dcd11iUwaa	yea are right and you need to talk to her about it.

Do you have a door on your room?  If you do you are lucky, life aint that bad, get over it.|`|pUUyYz4gaa	Move out!!!      Oh...you're not old enough and you have no job.  Get over it and get better grades.    It's a cruel world outside of your mother's door.|`|qVRmpGlEaa	Invade her privacy. Next time your parents are having sex walk in and and go through their stuff like nothings up. Then find something of hers you don't like, throw it on the floor and yell at her about it later. She will think twice about invading your privacy again.|`|UbSJPBuNaa	its just maternal instinct.|`|XKhNw221aa	You shouldn't hide stuff from your parents to begin with, especially if your mom does your laundry. But if it really annoys you, you have two options.  1.) hide something really bad somewhere she's bound to look, nothing illegal but something bad that's she's not going to want to find.  2.) Your best option is to tell her politely that you don't have anything to hide and that it hurts your feelings when she goes through your stuff assuming that you do. It'll catch her off guard and she won't do it anymore, hopefully.|`|2tCbCvzXaa	ask for a lock on your door w a key, hide your stuff better, talk to you mother about privacy....asked how she would like it (not in a snotty way)|`|CJvHQl5vaa	I am sorry your mother is not respectful of your stuff.  I assume that you have sat down with her and told her how you feel about it.  If not, sit down and talk with her.  Tell her how it makes you feel.  Ask for some respect, and ask her how she would have felt at your age if her mother did that to her...maybe her mother DID do that to her.    Otherwise, if you have a locker at school, it may be best to keep things you want privacy about in that locker.  Obviously illegal things are best not brought to school, but things like tests you didn't do your best on or private notes should be kept where your mother can't find them.  You are entitled to having a bit of a private life.    Before you leave your room, every time, take a quick look around and make sure that everything is nice and neat, and all dishes and objectionable things are put away.  Maybe if your room never had a bad grade, private thing or dirty dish in it she would get bored and stop going through your stuff.    One thing though...don't leave dishes around your room.  They attract bugs and that is pretty nasty.  I know you are only human, but that would make me a pretty angry too.    I know that it feels like a total violation to have your mother go through your stuff, but remember that High School years really will end soon, and you will be out of the house and have your freedom as an adult, I swear!|`|e7qwfj55aa	shut the hell up, u live under her roof so deal with it, or get your own house|`|ETQ3nIOeaa	stop being sirty, and get good grades. easy as that.|`|9MO6Iu1laa	Tell her that yshe needs to leave you alone or pick everything up before she does it so she has nothing to yell at you for or talk to your dad to tell her to stop. Don't worry Matt ur not alone happens to me a lot too, but I'm a girl so its worse|`|YBSfSOvOaa	yeah... it totalee happens to me also....  well, there is nothing you can do about it right?  am i right?  well, the only thing you can ever do about it is to run away.........  which is what I plan on doing.....but thats me, not you.....  sometimes moms can be a ***** to have to put up with...erm....|`|fh21w5euaa	how annoying maybe you shouldn't leave stuff like that in your room then she will have nothing too take.......try keeping your room VERY clean and then see what she has too say!    GOOD LUCK!|`|4YE83w6Maa	tell her to stop going through your private stuff or going in your room tell a friend or an adult to tell your mum to stop =]|`|Gx14PIvxaa	You could talk to her about how this makes you feel, as the right way to go about convincing you to get better grades is not going into your room and then embarrassing you by leaving your papers on the floor.    However, it is ultimately her decision to decide how to react, as it's her house!    Good luck!|`|fsHgUrcAaa	I'm assuming you're still in high school and if this is the case, your mom's gonna do that.  It's what moms do.  To avoid it, talk to her more, let her know how you're doing in school and put your dishes in the sink when you're done with them.    If you're out of high school, however, it's really time to move out.|`|c5c157de44722b3201c46ab6e2a00078aa	parents... they haven't changed much. well she's just worrying about you and you may have done something in the past that could've ruined her trust in you. well tell her that you need to come to some agreement because you feel you have your own rights and they should not be violated. come to some terms with her. but she is your mom though, if she feels something seems suspicious or whatever, she can snoop! you'll miss that when you move out.|`|qpv8H3suaa	Ugh I HATE that you aren't alone I feel your pain, unfortunately there's not really anything we can do without just making the whole situation even worse  =(  Gotta hate those tyranny authority figures eh?|`|a46be6b854cf1fb903b113b530f0029caa	Tell that's it's an invasion of your privacy and make yourself very clear. She won't understand unless you make sure she knows how much it bothers you. Try asking nicely for her to stop and if she gets upset at you then just say that you're doing your best and hopefully she'll stop.|`|4d8599b2db77f79491b8c8d0aa094488aa	I am almost 40 now but when I was a teen, my mom did the same thing.  For some parents it is the best way they know how to parent.  Don't leave stuff laying around that you don't want to get yelled at for or just have to deal with it until you are old enough to get your own place then you can leave whatever you would like laying around.|`|2PTzgYuvaa	first of all if you want respect from your parent you need to treat her with respect. [watch the cursing it makes you seem like spoiled jerk]  sit down with your mom, explain that she has no reason to not trust you, because you have no intention of spoiling your life with stupid actions or deeds.  Explain to her that you would appreciate some privacy unless you give her any reason not to trust and respect your privacy.  Then behave in a mature and responsible fashion and your mom will back off.|`|ToYmTw8gaa	first of all..try locking ur door. try putting plates away(ino it sux!) and as for grades..keep those hidden somewhere. like if thers stuff u dont wnt ur mom to c, keep it in like a secret place somewhere where ur mom wont find it. also try talking to her about it. tell her it botheres you and that it makes u feel invaded and stuff, hopefully she'l listen.|`|5LrrwvQuaa	I know what your talking about...  I had to deal with it too when i was younger.  but you know what, it made me a lot smarter once i hit college and was living on my own.  my dorm was then always clean, just because it felt it had to.  i never did bad in school.  and i was sure to stay away from the bad stuff.       im not saying to go and be a complete freak and be scared.  your young, you go thru the good and bad, and you learn from them... but part of it is from your rents going thru ur things.      if your really unhappy with what she is doing, tell her.  but talk to her, don't yell and scream because then she will think your hiding something (believe me, did it.)   Tell her that if anything was really wrong, that you would talk to her about it, but that you are older now, and you can deal with the little things that come your way.    act mature about it in-front of her, and maybe she will give you that privacy your looking for... :)|`|wscyjkPAaa	Its the parents job to know whats going on with their kid's life.  Maybe you should talk to her more and tell her what's going on.  If you get a bad grade, tell her,  if you get a good grade, tell her.  The point is you have to talk to your mom more often.  Also, how hard is it to put a plate back in the sink and rinse it out.  It takes less than 5 minutes.  If you communicate with your mom more often, she'll see you as responsible and you'll earn her trust.  I don't think she will not have to sneak into your room anymore if you act more responsible.|`|0L5qFnIJaa	parents will be parents. dont get bad grades no more. maybe shes teaching you a lesson so you wont f up anymore.|`|0dL28j4Faa	same i hate when she does that irts so stuipid|`|Rnaub4P6aa	my mom used to do that too but hide it where she can't find it like put it in the bathroom that's where i put mine always|`|KZPXXXSJaa	Put that stuff in someone elses room and even if she finds it u wont get in trouble.|`|99NoXDMGaa	im 12 and intend to keep the way i am whether my mum dose or not best bet just tell her straight with a gentle approach please give me just A bit more privacy
AA11955868	When you and he feel comfortable and want to. I wouldn't be incredibly pushy about it, but maybe bring up the topic, or be suggestive in more physical ways. I wouldn't strip down and jump on the bed and be like "lets rock" (though come to think of it, I know of several men who would probably enjoy that...)    Kissing him would probably be the best 'suggestion'.    I'm 99.1% sure he's not going to be like. "Woah woah woah!

jJZz2U8Gaa	You are infatuated with her, not in love. If you are meant to be with her, somewhere down the road it will happen. For now, move on and date a girl your age. She was meant to be just a good teacher and friend. It's a common crush. I had one on my teach, too. I thought it was meant to be. Was it? No.|`|f7f0fd5f021b5d1e4672cdbda2a11ffeaa	No don't tell her. Trust me on this one, she doesn't want to hear it! You will just embarass yourself and make things uncomfortable.|`|adcCJrNxaa	Don't tell her, I think you are only setting yourself up for heartbreak!
jgU4g6kGaa	No you are not wrong at all!! You are only 20 years old!! You have your whole life ahead of you!  It's better that you saw this now and didn't stay with her any longer.  You definitely did the right thing and yes you don't need to be tied down to a girl with kids at such a young age you have so much life to experience. She chose her life and she chose to have children so early that wasn't your choice and you have a right to do what you want with your life these aren't your kids.  You were right to get out of that relationship and be honest with her about what you wanted.|`|875b9562d8defd3804154e34c3bf5ea4aa	Well, at least you are mature enough to realize you are too young to settle down. You are right you have the whole world in front of you. You shouldn't feel badly about her child. She is the one responsible for her own kid. She is the one that put the child in the situation. And believe me the kid will be ok. If she is trying to use that against you, than she has issues.<br>  Dating is about figuring out who you are as a person, who is right for you and who is not. You also learn a lot about yourself as a person. Dating is a experience not a commitment. You shouldn't feel bad at all. <br>  Have fun while your young. You are doing the right thing.|`|87WOSjwgaa	I think you know what is best for you! If it is not best for you to be with her, then dont do it. Will the kids miss you, oh yeah, will they ask about you, of course.

Before those kids got more attached.|`|YoyGzi2Aaa	I think you're asking this for the sake of asking a question. You know the answer because you already did it. She sounds selfish and pathetic.

And hopefully you had a nicer body than her boyfriend...if not...you will look really stupid bro!|`|XdUL0PXmaa	Really, you should leave her alone if she's got a boyfriend (though it might just be a friend) but if she's checking you out whilst her boyfriend is there, then you're made for each other!!<br>  Seriously, chiseled abs??|`|EyaqiWPwaa	i think that she wants to make you a sandwich ....and then have a 3some|`|x3TR3nj0aa	conceited? <br>  goodness "chiseled abbs"  " F ING ripped " <br>  like really? <br>  come on now hunny.|`|K1Lk7BXhaa	It sounds like you're too into yourself|`|K9bKC07kaa	your a wanker|`|gbUKzTyVaa	Ummm.... notice how YOU were the one doing the checking out, YOU were the one who gave her a smile/eye contact, and YOU were the one that "showed her your chiseled abs"??<br>  <br>  YOU are the only one doing anything.  She probably didnt know WHAT to do, was really awkward, weirded out, and embarrassed... and she's probly annoyed by you/thinks you're a freak.<br>  ==================<br>  Her boyfriend probably didn't want to start a fight, because anybody who has a really hot girlfriend knows girls hate fights over them......<br>  <br>  and he also probably knows that most people who not only have chiseled abs, but show them to guys' girlfriends... A) dont get any p*ssy, and B) are probably angry at letter A so they kick people's a*ses on a regular basis, to make up for it.<br>  <br>  So he left you alone, except for a glare to stop making a fool of yourself.  ya dig?|`|UEXhKr60aa	Well I dont really think she was checking you out. Likw you know when theres something like unusual that you just can't look away? It could have been like that.  I mean I don't want to sond weird but if there was a guy doing that to me, I'd probably look cause its...weird. But i'm not her. she might think your cute. But if she were to dump her boyfriend for you, why would you want her? She could just do the same to you for the next guy she thinks is hot. But ya...so hope that helped :) bye|`|jdLbgBQGaa	your SUCH a douche nozzel|`|92HoC2OWaa	leave her alone|`|8vfCRg7Caa	wow you are kind of disrespectful to her boyfriend.|`|NAqfPvmHaa	hmmm id think none of it, nobody goes to the gym to pick up guys...why do you think she brought her boyfriend to the gym with her, she probably just smiled at you to be polite since you smiled at her first.

But that happens, happens.|`|34LCJyLBaa	dude first of all i honestly say u shouldnt be fighting over a girl..<br>  girls like that are not worth it..<br>  both ur friend betrayed u n so did ur gf..there both were involved..<br>  just leave ur gf if u havent because once they do it once there going to keep doing it over n over again..<br>  n ur so called friend...hes definitly not ur friend because a true friend wouldnt play u like that|`|ub2Dtzn0aa	Realize your a better person for finding out they weren't really your friends.

Chib4b8saa	I wouldn't necessarily ask for a whole new wedding, but maybe you could suggest having a nice ceremony to renew your vows and plan it the way you would like it. The day should be about you and him and taking your vows, not about impressing people or any of the material things about weddings. Also, I'm not sure how old your son is, but if he's old enough, you could make him included somehow and make it special for him also.|`|LxvA4vGpaa	There is a better way to have a second wedding.....maybe for a mile-stone anniversary, renew your vows.  You can have an intimate affair and you can go do what you want for this and that.  I wouldn't necessarily have an all out wedding, but just have it be an event that you plan and that you can be proud of.|`|a3422bad6666b60894e80bace0f14387aa	You're already married, why do you need/want another wedding? Sorry, what's done is done, you only get married once. However, you could renew your vows with a really stylish party on a milestone anniversary (5, 10, 15, 25 years etc). <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|pfjxEZBmaa	You can't have a second wedding. The marriage is done and over. Shouldn't of let people push you around. It was your day to take care of, not his mothers. Sorry. Do a vow renewal at your 5 or 10 year anniversary.|`|sGP6s7uraa	I didn't even need to read the explanation so to answer your question, yes it would be wrong.  It would crass and selfish.  Be happy with what you've got, honey.|`|AAgX0SDcaa	a bit of trouble for all parties concerned, what is done is done. Put your energy into your marriage now.|`|GvamTVqAaa	yes it would be wrong.|`|lJhl3wLAaa	Hi honey. The wedding your mother planned was terrible. I hated it and was embarrassed by it. Your mother was ashamed of having a grandchild out of marriage that she wanted us to get married fast. I would have rather waited until our son was a year old to get married so I had time to get in better shape. So can we do it all over again so I can do what I want instead of what your mother wants?<br>  <br>  Seriously though. There is not an easy way to bring it up. Either way you slice it you are slapping his mother in the face. Not sure why you didn't stand up for yourself and postpone it for later. Not sure why you didn't demand bridesmaids. Not sure why you didn't have more input into your own wedding. <br>  <br>  I wouldn't worry about it really. Most people plan their wedding in detail but don't plan the marriage. As long as your marriage is happy and healthy then you don't need a goofy ceremony to validate your love. Just plan a nice vacation for you and your husband and take wedding type pictures on the beach. Save those for your wedding album. I got married in 1997. Digital photography was not around. I see everyones photos now and I want to get married all over again so I can have better "memories" . No matter what you do, you will not be happy. Just my 2 cents.:)|`|yTirNVXyaa	Save and go on vacation someplace you have always dreamed of going and have a vow renewal. Just plan it as a destination wedding. I would plan it on your year anniversary that way its a big day anyway and everyone will see it as a renewal rather than a whole other wedding.|`|wADnvKGFaa	OMG!!  People on here are dramatic!  Do what you want with your money!  If his mom has a problem with it, perhaps she should have included you in the first wedding instead of trying to punish you for have a baby before marriage!  My only caution would be to not call it a wedding but a vow renewal.  Sounds better.....<br>  <br>  Geeeeeez Good Luck!!|`|239548019a89f1b3358d72761eef3170aa	You can renew your vows but the thing is paying for it all so do it in 5 or 10 years, start saving now and it will be great.|`|ZDMUW1YRaa	You can do a vow renewal for a milestone anniversary but what you want to do and the reasons for doing it are tacky and just plain rude.  I repeat this sentence to my brides over and over like a broken record.  <br>  <br>  YOU GET MARRIED TO BE MARRIED TO THE MAN THAT YOU LOVE, YOU DO NOT GET MARRIED FOR THE "DAY" <br>  <br>  GET OVER IT AND BE HAPPY YOUR MARRIED AND THAT IRREGARDLESS OF IF YOU LIKED IT THAT YOU WERE LUCKY ENOUGH TO HAVE SOMEONE HOST A WEDDING FOR YOU. <br>  <br>  in my opinion your a spoiled brat.|`|76f80c73e4bfcb1026dd5ae2d1da3f18aa	if you want to have a wedding, go ahead but  you have to pay for it.  if you're mature enough to be married you're mature enough to know that no one owes you a paid wedding.  you should have had the balls last time around to stand up to his mom and tell her you want things done your way.  what's going to keep her from screwing up your 2nd wedding?  nothing unless you tell her where to stuff it.|`|lgxE5nUoaa	I would suggest go somewhere nice for a second honeymoon or renew your vows - that's about all you can do.|`|47af2fda89839c0ec02e273cff59d82daa	who exactly do you plan on asking? if its the mother who did all this for you, then yeah, asking her would be wrong cause it would pretty much be flat out telling her that what she did do for you guys wasnt good enough.  the only person left to ask is your husband, and at this point it would be more of a vow renewal than anything, and you guys would probably be bearing most of the financial load yourselves|`|26cae2932c19d290ec2e4570f9542e0baa	Yes it is wrong. A mature person would accept what happened and move on with life. Do you think you get to do-over giving birth to your children if you don't like what happened? Of course not. Life does not offer do-overs, weddings included.|`|88234fa7f47e6fd5bb301672de45093eaa	Personally, I think do-over weddings are crass, and well, a bit pitiful.  Your wedding was what your wedding was.  Life doesn't allow us to do-over events.  I agree that a vow renewal on a milestone anniversary is probably the best solution to your problem.  However, if you do decide to have a do-over wedding, don't expect any showers or bachelorette parties, don't expect big, expensive gifts, and do expect that a lot of invitees will choose not to participate.  In the end, you may be more disappointed, and be out a lot more money, to attempt a re-do than waiting for a vow renewal.|`|AA11312653	Yes. It demeans and trivializes the solemnity of marriage to have a pretend wedding when there is not actually a marriage taking place. That said, I love parties and I think it is wonderful when couples reaffirm their marriage vows. By all means have a wonderful party with a stretch limo, live band, catered dinner, fancy cake, oceans of champagne, and a new dress to die for -- but not a wedding. <br>  <br>  Sorry, but we have all had "special days" such as birthdays, graduations, new baby, and other celebrations that have turned out badly. We strive to be thankful that it was only one day and move on.

9temsB8haa	Maybe she doesnt want you to look like her and maybe she knows it is easier to keep the weight off than it is to try and lose it after its been put on. She could just be mean but I bet she is actually caring enough to try and help you from becoming her-<br>  I look great at my current 195 but I wish people close to me would have said something to me when I was climbing to 235- I got up one day and realized I was fat and that women who used to flirt with me hadn't in a long time- now many others do again- trust me- paying attention to your weight will make you feel better but also you will look better and healthier.|`|DxohE884aa	Gosh, how annoying. Just ignore it - you're great just the way you are.|`|P8dIznazaa	That's no way for a parent to behave.  I would never act like that with either of my kids.  Your mom has some serious issues.  I don't think you need to tell her that, but you DO need to get in the habit of ignoring what she tells you, and reminding yourself that what she's telling you isn't reality.  She's putting you down to make herself feel better.  And you may want to start taking everything she tells you with a grain of salt.  If she says this kind of thing about you for no reason, I wouldn't trust that any advice she gives you isn't self-serving.|`|dd359cc64852ff6e00d407ac09db7261aa	Hi,<br>  <br>  Hmm... I don't think your Mum's jealous of you. Just because she may be overweight, that doesn't mean that she has no right to say something if she thinks you're getting 'larger'. Have you ever thought though that she may feel insecure about her weight and not want you to look the same?<br>  <br>  If you're 5 foot 5 or more then your weight is perfectly fine. If she's upsetting you, then the best way to resolve the problem is talk to her about it, not snap at her or accuse her of being jealous.<br>  <br>  As long as you're happy with your body weight, don't worry.<br>  ~Mystic.|`|QwHLZaS6aa	either she is jealous like u said but maybe she just wants u to be healthy. or maybe she wants u to be attractive.  i know its sad but some parents just want to push their kids to be the best..not just in school. tell her u dont like it when she does that and that it makes u feel bad about youself.|`|mB2dDIFAaa	im sorry, but that is terrable. tell your dad
RIO8DEthaa	I have been placed in this situation before. Trust me, jealousy is something that he will always have, and a little bit a jealousy is healthy in a relationship. Perhaps, he is just insecure about himself. Make sure that when you talk to a guy, you specify that you are friends and nothing more, although he should already be aware of this factor. If it is still early on in the relationship, you should talk to him about it because if you do not it will just get worse as time progresses. He can be jealous but not in a controlling way ..|`|uFONqntEaa	lemme guess your like 13?<br>  So immature.<br>  Your doing it on purpose<br>  So if he gets too worked up<br>  dump him<br>  its not worth it|`|AA11136246	Dont feel bad but i didn't understand what you are trying to say
w8Fdk02maa	Sierra... if he would dump you just to make the "cool" kids happy you don't need him. Why do you like someone who is fake and acts like a different person around others? Why do you like someone who puts you down?<br>  <br>  Come on Sierra, you like being made fun of? I don't believe that. I'm sure the things he does hurts your feelings. I would say you break up with him first and then tell him that you are breaking up with him because you deserve to be treated with respect and walk off all cool and confident. <br>  <br>  Not that it matters but, that will make him like you more and the cool kids will then think your cool. But that isn't the reason you should do this... but because you don't need that and there are many other guys who will like you for who you are.|`|f7f0fd5f021b5d1e4672cdbda2a11ffeaa	Well I'm sorry hun, if he plans on dumping you there isn't much you can do to stop it.  On the plus side, you will be getting rid of a guy who is too stupid to think for himself and lets others make decisions for him so good riddance.  You don't need a boyfriend who makes fun of you and pushes you around.   I say ignore him and his loser friends because you are better than them.|`|9Ni21lHpaa	sweetie,how good a guy is this if he's dumping you just so that he can be in the poplular crowd?he's pushing you around,and making fun of you cuz ure short??he doesnt seem to have any respect for u at all!! and ure his gf!!he's suppose to be on ure side,Y do u want this guy when he treats you that bad??There's nothing cool about pushing and making fun of one's gf just so that cool kids will like him,what a jerk!!!U'll end up being dumped by him and feeling really insecure.Do ureself a favour,tell him that he's lost ure respect cuz he's pushing you around and making fun of you,dump him before he dumps you.|`|gJPlY1ADaa	first off you can't stop someone from breaking up with someone else, if they want to do it then they will....<br>  second off why would you want to be with someone who fronts in front of other people and who lets people influence him....so if they tell him to jump off a bridge he will do it. He needs to learn to think for himself...<br>  third off why stay with him if he's treating you like crap....my guess is that he has been wanting to break up with you for awhile now but he's using his friends as an excuse. i say you break it off with him because he's being an asshole and when he gets his act together take him back if you want to. ( i wouldn't because he should not have been treating you like crap just cause he got new friends.)|`|g6K2FO45aa	If he or you REALLY? loved each other, you would have been committed and married one another when you first started dating. Now, that would have proven your love. Right now, I guess you don't love each other, and in todays world that means "O well, moving on." (Yeah, I know, its a sick world we live in.)<br>  <br>  I'm sorry, but the way I see it, its either Marriage, or date some random person for a while, and expect never to hear from one another again.<br>  <br>  Blah, today's Society I guess huh?|`|SSfXwkpnaa	seems like he doesnt like you as much as you like him .and he sounds like a jerk .you can do better than someone who treats you like this so break up with him first then if he really likes you he'll do something to get you back|`|i0DEBCUTaa	break up with himin front of all his cool friends. he doesnt like you so why stay with him<br>  /|`|HMW3EoTWaa	break up with him first|`|ZpR57jbBaa	No girl think ahead of him okay. break up with before he does it to you.

I really don't know|`|DsgNMpEsaa	He sounds like a total asshole. You deserve way better, dump him. :]|`|0R8g7K2uaa	If he is willing to break up with someone for no apparent reason, just to be cool.<br>  You dump him.<br>  He's acting like a ding dong! <br>  Don't let him push you around just so he can fit in. He's acting like a jerk. And you seem better than that.<br>  <br>  =]] Good luck|`|ZSEgGaWoaa	all i can say is that if he is gunna break up with you for them...he isn't worth your time.  i know it feels like you love him and you will practically die without him. but you won't you will find someone better!|`|T4N6a7MQaa	If he's that influenced that easily then he most likely isn't worth having anyway.

f58610d9e7b39bfd723abba5e7f95cc6aa	It sounds like he wants a "friend with benefits" relationship.  I personally know that "friend with benefits" don't usually work out in the long term.  One of them (almost always the female) wants the relationship to change to one on a more personal level.   Oh...and I'm 46 and 'been there done that' so I think I am qualified to say that.  <br>  <br>  Men have 2 brains.  The one between their ears and the one between their legs.  Unfortunately for women, it is the brain between men's legs that does most of the thinking for them.<br>  <br>  women also have 2 brains.  just like men they have one between their ears and the other is located just a short distance below this in their heart.  And unfortunately this is the one women use to think with.  If you were using the brain that God gave you..the one between your ears, you would know when he says "all I want is to be friends"...is exactly what he means.<br>  <br>  Do not confuse him playing house with you as him being in love with you.  for him..all it is, is friendship and since you allow it...he can also have sex with all that housework. (yes I know, you cut him off already)<br>  <br>  If you are wanting a long term relationship and he is not then you need to stop hanging out with someone who has stolen your heart but is unable to reciprocate.  You need to start looking for a person who can fill that void in your life.  and you are not going to find it if you constantly have him calling and texting you.  It kind of sounds like you are wanting to find the right person to be with and settle down.  It would be nice if it were your friend but...that's not usually how lasting relationships start.  Yes, it does happen that friends fall in love but not usually.  usually people find someone they think is cute or smart or buff or sexy or whatever reason they have for being interested in someone, they get together, date, hang out, get to know each other and then fall in love.  <br>  <br>  And then on another note...maybe he feels awkward about having a b/f-g/f relationship with someone he's been friends with.  Some people just can't handle a change in relationship like that.<br>  <br>  You've already told him that you want more out of the relationship and he still insists that he only wants to be friends,There's nothing more you can do but move on.  Just because you've only dated people who didn't measure up...it doesn't mean he's not out there.  It took 36 yrs of single life before i found the man I finally ended up marrying.  and believe me...I kissed a lot of bad frogs before I found him.  In fact..the last 10 yrs before we met, I had swore off men and had been totally single.  At that point I only used men for free dates and a one night stand.  women have an itch they need scratched every once in a while too, LOL.<br>  <br>  anyways...good luck and I hope everything turns out the way you want it to.  If not..well, it wasn't from lack of trying on your part.<br>  <br>  oh, and one more thing.  It may have been your idea to have a 'friend with benefits' relationship but I guarantee he had already been thinking about it but was just too chicken (or insecure) to act on it.  and personally...I don't think he is much of a friend if he knows how you feel about him but continues to lead you on by flirting with you and him sending you mixed messages.  and yes, flirting with you, texting you and calling you all day, playing house with you, going out to eat, fixing meals together..all that is "playing house.  so he is getting something out of the relationship while your heart is breaking in the mean time.  No, not much of a friend in my books.|`|9temsB8haa	It isnt men, it is him. He is playing you and trying to have the best of both worlds- sex and companionship when HE wants it and freedom when HE wants it. Cut him loose- tell him that you love him but that isn't how your life is going to be.|`|wna5OGiYaa	he obviously enjoys your friendship and your sex,<br>  but he isnt ready to slow down yet, he's been married already<br>  and is still basking in being free<br>  <br>  but he likes you, probabaly love,<br>  because he is still around|`|de98ae9f767cca0cbce05bd146ac0d7daa	He wants sex without making a big commitment.|`|CPZA5qrGaa	You said it already. You are totally stop having sex with him.<br>  That's what you said.....Practice what you preach.<br>  You are sending mixed messages.<br>  And he also is sending you mixed messages.<br>  So who is leading whom?<br>  You are being used for sex as he is being used by you for the same.<br>  Except when he fails he knows you're an easy lay. That's taking advantage of a situation that you could have avoided somtime ago.<br>  It's not to late to stop having sex with him.<br>  Unless you want to catch something now or later. Keep it as friends.<br>  It's apparent that you and he are f_king buddies.
4crqyM2laa	What made you fall in love with your husband?  Did he make you feel special?  Why this other guy be any different.  Your a princess for awhile, then it becomes common.  You need to find a way to make your marriage special again.  Try standing at sink doing dishes in the nude when your husband comes home.|`|jgU4g6kGaa	Make a decision. There is something missing in the marriage if you are talking to this other guy. Either try and make the marriage work or get out of it.  Maybe you and your husband just need a little spark back in the relationship.  Talk to him and tell him how you feel see if he makes an effort to make it work if not get out and follow your heart.|`|ub2Dtzn0aa	Take a vacation to Oklahoma.

Trust me that is not a good idea. <br>  You should talk to your husband about what is going on.<br>  You don't have to tell him about the other guy. Of course!<br>  But tell him you feel ignored and that you really need him to show you some attention. <br>  Or else things will really go soar and connections will be lost.|`|875b9562d8defd3804154e34c3bf5ea4aa	oh, how refreshing.

AA12198711	My sister always put herself on a pedestal and thought she was better than thou. She belittled people, lied and stole to make herself look better in her own eyes.<br>  <br>  She was never a true sister. I tried for 50 years and then decided I did not have to subject myself to anything that was not good for me and she wasn't.<br>  <br>  Just because they are family does not make them good for you. Just because they are family does not mean you have to keep putting up with the bad.<br>  <br>  Speak from your heart.|`|cB2VGhLgaa	Good question. My siblings seem to do the same thing, they say the rudest things and I feel really bad but they don't seem to care. Its almost like they enjoy making their own family feel bad. I have had to learn to deal w/ it and avoid the family members who do that. My family lacks communication so talking about it wouldn't work, but I don't know what your situation is. If you are close to your family try talking it out.|`|i15KoiJhaa	Funny you should ask this...<br>  <br>  As I also have an Older Sister that felt the need to call and let my Hubby know she wasn't happy with his mood this last weekend...<br>  <br>  NOT because I asked her too, NOT because I wanted her too... <br>  <br>  BUT<br>  <br>  Because, she loves me and has good intentions! Crap! LOL<br>  <br>  Lucky we are very close and although she didn't like it, I did call her out on this and told her while I can appreciate her concern and care for me and my Hubby... that our Marriage is not her concern or business to intervene in... I don't need to be "Saved" and to knock it off.
20c96a5e1e1d8742c7835d3700704d38aa	Ok you've been with him four years and he's hit you at least 4 times-So what if after 5 years he decided to make it 2x a year or  3 hell why not you let him get away with it now! Or wait what about when you have kids then he can beat all of you! There is a reason they ( your family) never liked him to begin with! He's a violent man, if he is willing to get help then maybe you can try to work it out, but if he isn't willing you have to leave before he gets worse!|`|80e9b302f1ee300cac6fea79c460458faa	There is physical abuse (hitting) and mental abuse.<br>  <br>  Since he has hit you - you did have physical abuse.  The problem is - after 4 years of married and it has occurred about every 9 months - this is a pattern that is repeating itself.  He is unlikely to stop.  And it may become more violent and more frequent.  Especially as you get blames for having cause more and more things.  And if he goes thru bad stress at work, he will probably take it out on you.<br>  <br>  He should either get counseling or you should leave.<br>  <br>  Crying after he hits you - doesn't prevent him for hitting you again.<br>  People in these types of relationship - when they have kids - the kids learn to do abuse also.|`|4crqyM2laa	Depending on what the arguments are about, Its time to leave if it's because you did not do something he likes or something he thought you must do and did not. Or is it because you paid attention to another man with him present or without him present and stories got back to him true or not.  Remember if it looks bad it is bad.  If it is the latter, it is time for a divorce or counseling but the question is do you really love him if you flirt.  If it is the first one then one day the abuse will escalate tomorrow or nine months from now, and it will be too late.  You need to leave.  Get an order of protection, find a female friend you can trust or better yet move back in with a family member.  then you can seek counseling.  There is no excuse for abuse on either part and should not be put up with.  <br>  There are ways for it to change, but it will be on both parts one way or the other.|`|da3764770f9d97db5463f7e509eac31caa	OMG hon ... No wonder people you know don't like him.  This guy is a first class loser !!! Get the hell AWAY from him now !!! You don't deserve to be treated like this !!  There are plenty of people out there who are NOT going to hit you or slam you into things or hold you down or take away your stuff.  Better yet, just be on your own for awhile and get your head together and decide what YOU want.  Don't listen to this idiot when he cries and says he's sorry.  He's not.  He's an idiot and he's a psychopath and he's going to either put you in the hospital or he's going to kill you and like I said, you don't deserve to be treated like that.  You know you don't !!|`|tG1vTi0Daa	Its not only abuse, but hes extremely controlling. Its not your fault. It sounds like he has a mental illness, like a stress disorder or something. Depending on his age, certain disorders can appear coinsedently out of no where, and stay there until he gets help. Also, he could be on drugs. You need to talk to someone about this, a professional or a therapist, or even a close friend that can keep a secret.|`|DAU9lIO7aa	My first love was a girl who married another guy... He was more wealthy, better status and looked better than me.<br>  <br>  They got married and I was out of the picture I thought.<br>  <br>  A couple of years later I was called by someone telling me that my girl had jumped from the top level of a tall building. - She did not survived the jump.<br>  <br>  The reason was simply that her husband had used violence towards her.<br>  <br>  You have a hubby that loves you and, I sense, you love too.<br>  <br>  I beg you to at least contact someone (therapist or someone) who can listen and support you first of all for then, when you two together have made up strategy, perhaps involve something for both you and your hubby.<br>  <br>  What ever happens please make sure to not follow the path my first love took.|`|NGKwsawdaa	NOBODY should put their hands on you. This is abuse and you are just making excuses for him. He will not change, they never will, unless they get serious help. What is best for you is to leave him and let him get help with his anger issues.|`|m8QfHC7uaa	GET OUTTA THERE AND QUICK!  His action's will not stop and you are the one being hurt. Just leave before you can't walk out of there.|`|chENztVEaa	Your husband has anger management issues and he needs counseling.  If he isn't willing to get the help he needs than you need to file for a divorce and stay away from him.  Just because he doesn't do it very often or he is sorry for what he has done does not change what he is doing to you.  Let me guess, you are probably a good person who sees the good in him and you try to do everything possible to keep him happy and things right between the two of you.  That is not going to change his actions, in fact over time it will probably become more frequent and worse.  I understand that you love him, and he probably is sorry for treating you that way but you need to face the fact that he needs help.  If he is not willing to talk to his doctor or seek counseling for his abusive behavior than doesn't it make you question  just how much he really cares for you?  You need to think about that. I wish you the very best of luck because I think you are going to need it.|`|UpRdvpmXaa	This is definetly abuse and just because he cries doesn't mean he won't do it again. He can't control his anger and its not a safe situation for you to be in. There may be good times in between the bad times but you shouldn't have to wait for those times to come around to think everything is ok. I don't know if you have children yet but imagine what they'll go through in that situation. They would really grow up with resentment at watching their father abuse their mother for so long. Who knows what he will do to them, even if he doesn't hit them, he can still damage their self esteem and they'll grow up angry and resent you also for not getting you and them out of there. <br>  <br>  Find happiness in life. You don't have to stay. You can make it out there on your own and don't deserve having someone control you or snap at you for no good reason. Please get out of there. You may not think its bad but it is. My fiance grew up in a similar household and its taken her so long to get past her childhood and she still is dealing with it. Don't stay just because you're afraid of what you'll do when you leave....Leave because you don't know how much worst it can get and why live withsomeone who gets so angry and hurts you like that. He may say sorry but it isn't sincere if it happens agin.|`|wuR48sKsaa	Yes, it is abuse and I'm sorry to say that it's only going to get worse.  If you really wanted to work it out you tell him he has to get some sort of counseling but even that ins't fullproof.  <br>  <br>  Without any kind of intervention, his behavior is not going to improve.  It's just a matter of how far he's going to take it.  If he can slam you against something now when something goes wrong, what is going to happen when he gets REALLY mad?  Eventually, you are going to end up injured or worse.  It's not an excuse to say it only happens once every 9 months because it only takes a few seconds to get killed.  Get out while you can.|`|kNT7fzY7aa	If he cries about it and he is truly sorry, then he will agree to go to a counselor for help with his angry temper problem. No one, husband or wife in a marriage should be hitting their spouse. It is a sign that there is something very wrong with the person that would do such a thing. Ask your husband if he wants your relationship to be better and if he answers 'yes' then ask him if he would go to counseling with you. That way your not laying all the blame on him. Then he will be more likely to participate. Good luck, hope this helps you in some way.|`|uTNKfpV6aa	Most friends are pretty good at judging character. He is abusive. That is abuse. And it probably started as being controlling. Taking things from you, asking you to stop talking to your friends and family.<br>  <br>  But I believe you should leave him. There are so many other people out there, and you deserve better. Everyone does. And think about the fact that if you have a child with this guy, he may turn out abusive to the child. And that would screw the child up for life.|`|j4U36iNYaa	No matter how many times he says he's sorry, or whatever excuse he comes up with...THERE IS NO REASON for physical or verbal abuse.  Do you have children, or ever want children with this man?  Do you want him to do the same to them?  Find somewhere else you can live  for now and leave him immediately.|`|XupgzULeaa	The fact that he continues to hit you and is always sorry is an indication that he has some serious issues in his life which he needs to deal with. He needs help and you need to remove yourself from this abusive relationship before he does something drastic. Love yourself and protect yourself.|`|Le76lox2aa	Run as fast as you can out of that relationship.  The violence will get more and more abusive and will happen more often.   Call a domestic violence victims line if you can't do it on your own.   Good Luck!|`|wia9SXCPaa	Absolutely it is abuse!  You know that it doesn't happen very often so you let it go.  Well, let me tell you. . . no one has the right to do that to you.  <br>  <br>  Send him to anger management and if it ever happens again send him packing!|`|21c10ff4b98da8bd7f4718177f614888aa	what everyone is telling you is right. its ABUSE and you need to get out right away.  hes not sorry if it happens again.  leave before you get seriously hurt.|`|HL8PEDFLaa	Violence is violence. I don't think I would place him in the abusive category, however you need to make sure that it could get worse.|`|VsqHIoJYaa	okay you won't listen to your friends then listen to a stranger leave him now next time he could kill you saying he is sorry isn't enough please leave him there are plenty of men out there that treat a women right|`|Q3qcnzHAaa	You have very little respect for yourself if you stay with this loser.  Go find a real man that will treat you the way you deserve.|`|ph8IcueRaa	You probably do something to deserve it though, so there are faults on both sides.|`|AXbdNdPzaa	He is mean.  You should leave before he gets worse.|`|w1necKzYaa	Yes it is abuse! Leave before he really hurts you!|`|gmaCvh00aa	What do you mean is it abuse?  If you can't see that you've got worse problems than he does.<br>  <br>  You are lying to yourself if you really think it doesn't bother you that much.  You are volunteering to be a victim for some ungodly reason.<br>  <br>  Books and books and tons of TV shows are done on this subject, and you still don't know you are in an abusive relationship?  Come out from under the rock before he kills you.|`|qVL5R8nuaa	Of course it's abuse. What you are doing is minimizing. Once is too many times. Listen to the people who obviously love you and either get counseling or get out.|`|GvamTVqAaa	yes it is, but it's your choice if you want to put up with it.  If you choose to you really have no right to whine about it when it happens.  Either get out or deal with it.|`|T4N6a7MQaa	He's an abuser. One day he'll do something that won't let you walk away. If you're wise you'll get out now.
CzdxFiRLaa	He is grieving and taking out his angst on the person closest to him, you.  We all grieve in different ways and he may not know how to handle what he is feeling and finds it difficult to explain his feelings and loss to someone else.  <br>  <br>  Google death, grieving and have a look at some of the suggestions there.  Being there for him is important, when things get difficult, and an argument is brewing, you will need to take a 'leadership' role and play the piece maker and defuse any conflict.  Don't look to score points or win an argument, given time he will come around and your relationship will be stronger.<br>  <br>  Good luck<br>  <br>  David

I mean, be nice, but don't spend unnecessary time with them and such.|`|DV39yHz4aa	Ok, is the stalker someone you know? If yes, then you should go up to them and talk to them about why they been following you around. If it's not someone you know then you should call the cops.|`|v8E68R0maa	Do something really stupid.

tyvFUPOxaa	She reads like a female version of Adolph, to some extent; although, Hitler did most of his murdering in the name of the Third Reich. Eight abortions? Who fathered the aborted fetuses? If more than one are by the same man, dump your aunt on his front doorsteps... Otherwise, each abortion your aunt has experienced after one is first degree murder on her part not abortion. I would struggle with my pity for her, but I would boot her out like Hitler's family systematically booted him out. And I would pray that she does not live to do as much harm to more fetuses or people as Hitler did: because the devil has possessed her.|`|jvvDbAl5aa	well maybe you should take her to the therapist.  if that doesnt work just kick her out of the house.|`|WOHc22Xiaa	I know your worried about your aunt but if you've tried everything and shes still lazy your just gonna have to let her see for herself when there's no one to take care of her anymore.|`|AA11596133	SHE IS 42.  I seriously DOUBT she even is going to change, because SHE sees no real reason to.  Just make SURE that when your Grandmother passes on, that your aunt will NOT be legally able to stay there and claim everything is hers.  You need to get your Grandmother to do this all NOW.  As far as what will happen to miss lazy after that, WHO CARES?  If she is not willing to help herself, none of you should care either.  Wash your hands of it and live your own lives.
Q3hYBPJwaa	I think it varies from person to person, situation to situation and how long the relationship lasted. If the two people decided that they needed different things in life, but they loved each other, I would say that will take some time. It happened with me and my ex-girl friend. We broke up when I was a Senior, and I just now started flirting again, teasing women and trying to find another partner. If you guys broke up out of dislike, lack of happiness, then it probably won't take long because you never loved each other. As harsh as this may sound, love doesn't exist when two people are unhappy and not satisfied. Love brings happiness, content and meaning to life etc. You may have cared for the person, but love doesn't exist when two people are genuinely unhappy. You have to understand that love is something you will feel, and when you feel it, you will know it. The problem with things these days is not many people know what real true love is which is why so many break ups happen. Most people think they know what love is, but they are really just misguided and are misunderstanding love for another emotion such as, but not limited to, infatuation. Hope I helped!|`|JCdBSULraa	The maximum is 2 years to fully mourn the loss.   Most guys will be ready to move on after a few weeks if they've had closure, but that's not to say they're completely over the person.|`|w8Fdk02maa	Some people say it takes twice as long as you were with them to get over someone <br>  <br>  For me I was with a Girl for 16 months. Then 1 year and a half after she broke my heart I finally was able to date again without wishing it was my ex.<br>  <br>  hope tha thelps.|`|JPzi1Pfbaa	depends on what the next girl could give me|`|wuR48sKsaa	For me it really depends a lot on two things:<br>  <br>  1) How great was the past relationship?-  If I spent a lot of time being angry with an ex or I find out later on that the relationship isn't really all that I will get over it easier.  It also depends on the terms of how we broke up.  I was a freshman in college and had a girl leave me for a high school dude.  I was pretty pissed so it wasn't that hard to get over once I talked to a couple of other girls.<br>  <br>  2) How much do I like the new girl?  It's easy to wish you still had your ex while you are still single (or just not dating at all).  After the story I was telling you, I started hanging out with a girl that seemed really perfect for me.  I didn't really think about the ex even though I had been with her for 2 1/2 years.|`|cn49BbRiaa	It depends how much you loved your ex, sometimes it take a whole year to get over someone you were madly inlove with. Sometimes you never get over it but you still move on with someone else who treat you good and love you.|`|9Ni21lHpaa	It would depend on how close he was with this other girl,and how intense their relationship was.There really isnt some kind of standard time period...:D that's the same for everybody now is there?|`|AA10809580	I always heard that it takes 1/2 as long as they were going out.<br>  For instance, if they were going out 1 year, it would take 6 months.<br>  <br>  That seems about right to me.|`|6rExYBxoaa	get over it pretty fast. if theyr not back ina few days you can do better|`|ckjZnqHRaa	..if I really love a woman blushes?.....I never really get over them honestly.....I just leave them alone so I don't get arrested for stalking them seemingly.|`|gtINkA19aa	it all depends idiot|`|p5VKqKU7aa	i nver get over the fact when i am rejected or i reject them, it hurts like a *****|`|y7uuuuOuaa	I guess as soon as I realized I didn't want to be with her anymore.

If its one of those run of the mill skanky hoes that are around today, about 5 min.<br>  <br>  But if you truly loved this other girl you might never get over losing her....|`|gbUKzTyVaa	awhile|`|IFxOLiuKaa	thats a good question im going throught the same thing=/|`|cuMF1y51aa	two weeks...if the other girl likes you.. then she would understand and wate|`|cx2QgWTFaa	i could care less if i dump a ***** i am over them the minute we break up|`|AA10743159	For me as a rule, about six months. But it all depends, on how close you were with her, and how you broke up. If you broke up, because she was cheating on you, that time would be much less.<br>  It's never a good idea, to jump into a new relationship, until you are ready to commit to it. It usually doesn't work.
WOHc22Xiaa	I feel bad for you but there's not much you can do. Just tell them how you feel and make sure you make your point. You can get Emancipated.Emancipation of minors i think i think that's how you spell it. Either that or just wait til your 18 and moved out.|`|IQxdBt9Eaa	Try talking to someone at school, like a teacher that you get on well with, and explain everything that has happened to you at your grandparent's house and what your mum has done to you. The teacher may then know what to do then to help.     If you dont want to do that, how about sitting with your dad and clamly telling him everything that has happened with your mum and why you dont want to go back to your grandparents.       Or tell a friend, that could help.      Or you could just refuse to move! but then that could cause many arguments and ur mum mite do something to u, so mabye not.  ohhh, so hard! Good luck though!  x|`|R29QkoQDaa	that sucks. welcome to my world.|`|JpuWdGLRaa	Next time someone hurts you:    1. get out of there    2. go to a neighbor    3. explain the problem    4. call the cops    5. probably go to court or something    6. win case    7. get rid of rude relatives    8. go to live with kinder relatives or orphange (which isnt that bad i was at one for 2 years and actually loved it but i love my new family)    9. never see those people again    10. HAPPINESS!!!!!!!
IvMPh09baa	they are and always will be true until more men start fighting back and demanding more equality in these types of cases.  <br>  How do you think women got equality to ever vote?  It took one woman standing up and fighting for all the women in order for it to happen.<br>  <br>  So as long as no men are fighting back against these cases and just "accepting" the outcome, then things will never change.<br>  <br>  You need a leader and someone that will fight for this if you want it to happen.|`|bqkfu6Diaa	You are right. Most people fighting for equality are actually wanting special treatment. That's the way things are. We call it equality, but we know it's not really that. The sad part is that most of us know about it but do not really try to do anything about it or even care enough about it until it happens to us. Then it becomes an important issue.|`|Q3qcnzHAaa	I completely agree!  everything is for the women, but the men always get shafted.  Grant it, most deserve it, but there is some that don't either.  Just like Ebony magazine.  If there was a White man magazine, all hell would break loose.  Or Black entertainment television.  Who is prejudice?  you tell me.|`|62cdabc33de92fc0cab4f5016db9f9bcaa	very good question, we (men) and some women as well will have to live with it i guess. crazy, upside-down world. wish i had the answer on how to help make it a more even playing field.|`|aeLyiRczaa	Because most of the people who say they want equality are liars.  They do not want equality.  They want to be considered equal, they want the same pay or privilege, without having to earn it or meet the same standards.  That is the truth of the matter.<br>  <br>  Minorities want to be called equal and paid the same and to be viewed as equal, without having to score what non minorities must score on tests.<br>  <br>  A woman who wishes to be a firefighter thinks she should only have to drag a 100 pound weighted dummy in training, vs. a man having to drag a 200 pound dummy.<br>  <br>  When you disagree or tell these people they are scammers or slackers, they wish to call you names or accuse you of being a bigot.<br>  <br>  When these people say they want equality, laugh in their face and call them a liar, for that is just what they are.  Then smile and tell them that when they are willing to have to make the same grade and pass the same tests and shoulder responsibility as you must, they have the right to be considered your equal.  Until then, they are merely posers.|`|89UOqaVNaa	The world is messed up because of SIN and selfishness.<br>  <br>  If people would keep their pants on til marriage and then commit for life and teach their kids right from wrong, you wouldn't need to ask that question.<br>  <br>  The best thing you can do is don't have sex before marriage, and if you already did, then don't do it anymore. Find the one woman you love and stick to that one for life.|`|AA10389562	What in the world gave you the idea that any society in the world of today or of the past has the least bit of interest in achieving equality?<br>  <br>  Because equality is perceived as giving something up or losing control, it will never be seriously pursued no matter what the powers that be says.
7gH7sgi6aa	I also was molested and trust me that your Mother may never "admit" it because it hurts her too much.  I am 48, and got help and now have even forgiven the person who hurt me.  My Mother singled me out and was mean and hurtful to me.  After I talked about my abuse she told me to never discuss it again.  She did see that I got proper therapy though but still won't "admit" it happened.<br>  I have moved on and have found a place in my heart to put the abuse and everything that went with it.  Unfortunately my Sister that my Mother favors is still alive and they are "best friends".  Recently my Mother and Step-Father were on the antiques roadshow for a showing of a collection of their antique artwork and she only spoke about her daughter who is her best friend.  My Mother has 5 other children.  I did not feel slighted because actually I feel sorry for my Sister because she has to deal with all my Mother's craziness.<br>  I have a family of my own and have learned to set proper boundaries with people which you will need to do.<br>  Get therapy, let your Mother be herself.  She is going to regardless what you do.  Good luck and God Bless you.<br>  Peace. Love & Happiness

quQYvO9Maa	You need to prioritize and deal with your problems in order of fixability.   Some of your problems cannot be fixed. Take your mom's skin cancer. However, the problems with your friend and school probably can.    Sorry have to go  Good luck|`|6qhvnWWTaa	aww i feel really bad :(  do you have any really close friends you can go to, to talk to? Make sure it's a really close friend that you can really trust. Or, maybe try getting therapy? they can most of the time help analyze the problem better than anyone can.
e20e778807f334f6575085b3abdf95fcaa	Having a father walk his daughter down the aisle stems from the ancient cultures when daughters were considered property of the father until she was given over as property to her husband. <br>  Since my husband and I found that old tradition an abomination to humanity, we instead walked each other down the aisle as a symbol of starting our new lives together.|`|76f80c73e4bfcb1026dd5ae2d1da3f18aa	have your brother walk you down the aisle.  it's nice to have a male give you away.  when the minister asks who is giving you away during the ceremony, your brother can still answer 'her mother and I do'.  I say that while your fiance dances with his mom, you can dance with his dad.  your mom can dance with your brother.|`|MvC6n3DWaa	I've seen it done both ways. The person walking you down the isle 'gives you away'. Sounds like mom. That's my story and I'm sticking to it!|`|Chib4b8saa	Do you have an uncle or a grandfather that you think a lot of? Maybe one of them could walk you down the aisle. It really doesn't matter who the person is; in fact, you could go it alone. As for the dance, maybe you could dance with your new father-in-law; it may make him feel accepted and appreciated. But it's your wedding, so you have to decide what feels right to you.|`|5270639c059ab08c1b3431555f150db7aa	I had no dad at my wedding, either. My husband and I walked up the aisle together. <br>  I did the family dance with my older brother. I did have a dance with my mom later in the evening.<br>  Choose what makes you feel right...|`|AA12204435	For the walking down the aisle any one of them could do it its your choice and for the dance I would dance with your bro|`|a3422bad6666b60894e80bace0f14387aa	Anyone who has made an impact on your life can walk you down the aisle. You could even have your bro and your mom do it. As for the dances, again, you can dance with whomever you'd like, even both of them. <br>  <br>  I am walking down the aisle alone. My stepfather is deceased and my father was never a big part of my life. I am fiercely independent and always have been and I think this shows that side of me.<br>  <br>  You do what works for you, you can walk with both of them or choose one, it is up to you.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|239548019a89f1b3358d72761eef3170aa	it is up to you, have both if you like walk you down the isle, or have your Mom walk you down the isle and your brother do the Father daughter dance. the DJ can announce it as such. Good luck|`|44Sj3bsZaa	I know someone who actually had their mom and brother walk her down the aisle!
d0fa25b284e1f0b5318568250948279baa	Maybe take her on surprise trip somewhere.

Say her hobbies are books or movies something like that. Get her something she has always wanted or something you can buy to make her feel like you understand her and things that she likes. That way she knows that 6 months of dating and talking has actually made her feel like she is being understanding by someone she loves.Hope this helps!|`|pcCfHYeSaa	If you live near the coast take her to the beach and write I love you in the sand.

YbwDFvEaaa	He probably just wants to ensure that you guys are actually still friends, and thinks that if you ask him for the muffler yourself, that it will give him the chance to see where he stands with you. Asking your friends to pass messages back and forth is not a good sign for a friendship.<br>  <br>  You said yourself that he never showed as much interest as you did, so why are you trying to punish him for that fact? He's just not into you in a romantic way, plain and simple. To completely stop talking to him just because he isn't interested in a relationship with you is rather immature.|`|vxEWguqqaa	he wants you to tell him because he wants to talk to you and wants to here your voice|`|fjvgaNydaa	Maybe he is serious about wanting to be friends. And if you haven't talked to him in months, then he's probably hanging on to your scarf in hopes that you may talk to him again, even if it's just as a friend.<br>  <br>  I know it's hard if you have feelings for him, but you can still be his friend.|`|WtTUNC8Naa	Go ask him for it then. He might have realized that he made a mistake in telling his friend to tell you he has/had a girlfriend. Maybe he is intereted in you. But you'll never know unless you go and ask for your scarf back yourself. <br>  I mean what's the worst that could happen? He just wants to still be friends thats it... Don't read too much into it. But go get your scarf girl :-)|`|IW592N5Zaa	he wants you to act mature. you don't just ignore someone, you need to confront him.|`|V6dz395kaa	maybe he still likes u!|`|7TGDPiZaaa	you know, he is probably wanting to go out with you. and guys do that all the time when they like someone or when they want to flirt.|`|A73ForyRaa	he just being a ***** i cant stand it when guys do that just cause they know you like them just ask him for it back like you don't give a damn|`|jqXV8y3Laa	well go up to him<br>  and ask him for<br>  your scarf back then!<br>  obvioulsy he likes you <br>  if he wears it everyday!
xdLLid3eaa	You can't change her being your younger sister. I haven't had this happen to me before, because I'm an only child, but this does suck. I think that this is a terrible situation for you and your sister should probably think about how you feel about it. The guy, well, he sounds like a loser!|`|60ApQsGOaa	lol yeah, my sister dated this guy she knew I liked for 2 days then he called it quits with her and went with me.|`|cwQ4lbd5aa	My mom dated my uncle before marrying my dad. Everyone gets along fine now, but I know there was bad feelings for sometime.|`|1jAZfpODaa	No that would be really awkward|`|59fdLKz0aa	It was against the 'rules' in our house growing up, and it is against the rules in my home now. Also it is a bad idea to go out with your sibling's best friend, or the sibling of your sibling's bf/gf. It is Family etiquette that dictates this. Of course, some people date their own cousins! lol|`|0HUHHzIQaa	My brother went out with a girl for a while... she introduced him to her older sister... and went after his best friend (weird eh?)... My brother and the older sister are still together, have two beautiful boys, and are getting married soon... so it all turned out for the best. No akwardness, the younger sister is the one that thought they'd make a great couple!!!|`|8AaPQONGaa	lmao. i hooked up with my exes lil sis. (my ex was 4 years older her sis was my age)  but i didn't know they where sisters until afterwords  then i barfed.|`|N0VI2D59aa	Yes, my cousin dated this girl for a while and then they broke up. Later, my older cousin (his brother) saw her and was like, WOW she grew up! and then they started dating and now they are happily married with twins coming! My other cousin seems fine with it, but still... weird.

My school's too stereotypical... I admittedly play into the prep/jock stereotype, cuz im an athlete, and i end up dating hot girls...<br>  <br>  but honestly, they're usually not that fun, and there's alot of things I have to do and say that I really don't like doing, to fit in. It's retarded.  Like all the phrases you say... and wearing whatever type of shoes is tight that month... etc<br>  <br>  also, there's not enough girl fights these days, and MOST girls dont have that good of a sense of humor... its usually the institutionalized, sarcastic kind, but few girls I know are actually genuinely funny. only a few
jrWpHYAPaa	If the legal age in your country to be recognized as an adult is 18 then yes.|`|38432188076da24bd2e484fa5d428e24aa	yeah|`|uTNKfpV6aa	In Canada, as long as you're older then sixteen, your parents can't request you come home.|`|pRxzPiSbaa	you should definitely stay in school until you learn to spell. moving out won't help you at this point. can't spot the typo? exactly...|`|efe89983888e3685bd737f19ee631bd4aa	if your parents emancipate you, then you'd be an adult|`|bhjUGKDlaa	yes and perhaps by then you will learn proper grammar

GAHHH I HAVE NO CLUE|`|PJZRGsc3aa	yuck emos and scene people give me the creeps|`|CGKzXHBaaa	She probably knew him already. That's my guess. <br>  <br>  But "being shy" isn't a good excuse, i mean, you can blame it, and i know its hard, even if you're not shy, but that's not a legitimate reason for anything. <br>  <br>  Just say hi to him or smile at him in the hallway. <br>  <br>  or. hahahaha, drop your books right in front of him and hope he helps you pick them up, hahaha. :] but don't look too obvious! that'd be really embarassing..|`|YG4VMafEaa	Okay tomorrow aat lunch sit somewhere where it's easy for him to see you. Then turn around and stare straight at him. When he looks up to meet your stare, quickly look down. When he shrugs it off and stop looking, stare again and this time when he looks at you, keep staring and smile. He'll get the hint!|`|3y0w1qIBaa	When you see him, introduce yourself.  Guys love girls who have confidence.  Just say hi and hopefully it will engage the conversations.|`|SJIZ7j2xaa	walk up to him and talk about Music to break the ice the rest will come on its own
kQgSi1MEaa	Unless your 10 years old dont get a friend to do that, go up to him and tell him, i know it sounds simple and dumb, but it really is your best bet.  It will show him that you have confidence. dont do the little 3rd grade"omg pss hey do you liek lizzie" bullsh*t|`|oPVO9GOzaa	Don't tell him you like him! A guy likes a girl who is a challenge, trust me. Keep him wondering and let him chase you. Get the word out that you don't like that other guy.

You have to say it very firmly. Also why do you drive that far if your baby's father gropes you? Is itt because you like it? You could stop it if you really wanted it to.|`|T4N6a7MQaa	Are you serious? Why haven't you called the police? This isn't something that's allowed at all.

AHZ7fgQHaa	I am a spouse who doesn't like to talk much. My wife is a chatter box and we get along just fine. She knows if its something important, then I will speak up. Often I just pretend to listen to her rambling, all I need to do is nod my head once in a while. We have been happily married for years, although sometimes I wish she would shut up for awhile, but I would never say that.|`|875b9562d8defd3804154e34c3bf5ea4aa	Talk in general? My husband doesn't really talk in public. He is shy. He used to be that way with me. He wasn't used to telling people how he felt. But, gradually I'm getting him to open up more. Does he talk to me about everything? Not really, but he does let me in a lot more than he used to. It just takes time.|`|lgxE5nUoaa	This is going to sound funny - my husband isn't much of a talker but he always has a lot to say.  What I mean is, if the floor is open for him to talk, he will go nonstop for long periods of time.  But in general, no, he's not really much of a talker - meaning if we go out to eat, he watches people, he watches the staff (he works in the restaurant business so it kind of comes with the territory).  He's not about small talk or gossip - if I bring up something he doesn't care about or doesn't concern him, he has no interest.|`|lJhl3wLAaa	My husband isn't much of a talker. Unless we are talking about him. LOL<br>  <br>  Seriously though. He is not much of a talker. I'm the talker. If I am quiet for too long he will ask me what is wrong. Aparently I have to be talking to appear normal. <br>  <br>  How do we make it work? I do all of the talking and he listens. We get along just fine.

jrWpHYAPaa	I think she was trying to make you jealous with that other guy because you blew her off during thanksgiving, you chose another girl instead of her, and you barely hung out with her in summer.<br>  <br>  Or maybe she thinks your not serious, a flake with relationships? Or maybe she's playing hard to get using jealousy?<br>  <br>  But now from what i understood, she's not really doing those things anymore right? so maybe she's waiting for you to be a man and make the move.

YW74O9aNaa	oh.. thats so sad :( i had tears in my eyes just imagining what you mgiht have seen.<br>  But there is only one thing you can do... carry on your routine.. only time will help you get over this. Try to engage in things that will take your mind off this. <br>  When you get a pet again , just remember to honk a little when you  take your car out! <br>  <br>  And just remember it was not something you purposely did! It was an accident thats it.|`|KEUuLH3zaa	Thats pretty disturbing, take you sons example and forget it about it, disturbing...but over.|`|oojO4WAraa	Oh - that is so sad.  I am sorry this happened to you.  Recognize that you did not do this on purpose.  It must have been awful to see your cat injured and not be able to do anything about it. <br>  <br>  Don't be to hard on yourself - you didn't do this on purpose.  It was an accident. You would have avoided this if you could have.  <br>  <br>  It may take a while, but think of something else when this pops in your head.  Do not allow yourself to replay it and replay it.|`|p5cYEPASaa	No more cats, get him a puppy, keep it inside, and make sure it's big enough so when backing out you can see her. INSIDE< NO OUTSIDE WITH NO SUPERVISION!|`|Tc23KWgzaa	That happened to us, too, but ours was just a kitty.<br>  I'm sorry.  That must have been so traumatic.  <br>  <br>  Who is blaming you, honey?  It was an accident.  Accidents happen.  Your son isn't blaming you, not him, nor the family.  Do you think Stella won't forgive you?  I'm sure she does.  She loves you.  God loves you.  Everyone but yourself has forgiven you.<br>  <br>  Take the film in your head, and tuck it into a little box.  You can take it out in a few weeks when you feel better, when it's not so painful.  <br>  <br>  I honestly believe grandma's explanation.  Stella is not gone forever.<br>  <br>  Be nice to yourself, allow yourself some comfort.<br>  TX Mom|`|vlCWp7sSaa	Wow, that is a very sad and yet gruesome story. I am sorry for your loose. I do suggest you sit down with your son and tell him how truly sorry you are that he had to see that. It is also a good time to explain life and death to him. <br>  <br>  I can't say I have ran over my own pet before, but when I was younger my first dog name Daisey dog passed away and my parents had trouble explaining to me and my brothers about death. It's complicated and mysterious. My family grew up Catholic so my mom of course told us that the pain she felt is gone and that god is taking care of her now. It depends on your religion on how would explain that to him.<br>  <br>  Being able to talk  with your child will relieve a lot of pressure on you because now you both will be aware each others feelings. <br>  Its hard to forget events like this. So maybe try and take him somewhere to get it off your mind. <br>  <br>  Escape a little, maybe take a road trip, see a movie, and some states have a sports museum since you said he likes to play baseball. I don't think there are any pro baseball games going on but you can do some research on the internet. <br>  <br>  Again, I'm sorry you had to witness that scene.|`|NcPNMAhzaa	try getting a new cat or a new pet. it'll take your mind off of stella. think of things that make you happy, like chocolate. chocolate definitely makes people happy.|`|pyBHdJ90aa	That's a horrible thing to have to see.  I am so sorry.  Go to your doctor and get a tranquilizer, then try to get some rest.|`|d2FJBJ8baa	it's cat stop worrying so much, calm down|`|cahyQG9Gaa	ask forgiveness from god, he will take that emotion away and deal with it! just try it please!|`|75btdWJkaa	I think you should call up a good friend of yours who will understand, and talk about how you feel with him/her. It'll really help. I promise. And if you still can't get that scene out of your head, try thinking about something else, like a new song you just heard. Maybe you can get another cat too. Like a kitten that you could keep inside. I'm so sorry about what happened. Stuff like that can sometimes scar people for life. I'm so sorry! <br>  <br>  Answer mine please? <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090225122445AAm2yie">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a>|`|Deb4iqbvaa	Obviously, this was an accident. I worked in the animal field for a decade, so I know what you're going through. <br>  <br>  I would suggest burying the cat, saying some prayers; whatever makes you feel better. If you feel guilty, you can try volunteering at your local animal shelter--this way you'd know that you're helping other animals.<br>  <br>  I do feel obligated to suggest that you keep your future cats indoors so this doesn't happen again. It doesn't matter where you live; cats that are allowed outdoors have a life expectancy of 3 years, tops. Indoor cats can live to 19 or older.|`|VJqDtuoPaa	OMG. I'm so sorry to hear that. I had a dog get ran over cause my parents didnt put her on a leash when they walked her. We had 2 dogs at the time and she was the oldest and knew the neighborhood.  Well when my dad came to the door carrying her. I was so upset with him. It took me about a day or 2 to get over it. LOL the younger dog, she made her presence known every chance she got and turned into one of my favorite pets I've ever had. Just like everything else it will take time. I like you grandmothers way of explaining it. It should help.  <br>  <br>  On another note, thanks to your reply to my Q. It really opened my eyes. Wider than they already were. Thanks and Good Luck.|`|VwnLufUAaa	You have every right to feel horrified and upset. This was a really traumatic event. Allow yourself as much time as you need to get over it. Remind yourself that it was an accident and you are in no way to blame. These things happen.<br>  <br>  Allow yourself to cry about it if you need to, and talk to a friend about it. Talking about the event and your feelings will help.<br>  <br>  As for your son, don't rely on a school counselor to heal him. You should talk to him about it too. Ask him about his feelings; even though he seems fine, he almost certainly is very upset inside and he needs to express it too. Let him know it's okay for him to be upset about this. You don't want him to keep his feelings bottled up where they can do damage. Give him your shoulder to cry on.<br>  <br>  I'm sorry this happened to you. I hope you and your son feel better soon.|`|190d2cad96c8078068b38b79aae93751aa	This is a horrible thing to have to witness, the best advice I can give is for you to try your best to replace the ugly last images of her with the GOOD ones you have of her. When you think about that event, try to consider her as dead as SOON as you felt the car hit her. When you saw her it was just her body shutting down and she didn't suffer. I'm sure she was a great part of your family as well. It'll take a few tries to be able to replace those thoughts, but you can do it.<br>  <br>  I think you should be the one to have a serious talk to your son about what happened...when he is relaxed & comfortable. Talk to him before goes to a counselor.
UpRdvpmXaa	I'm really sorry about what you're going through Dee. First of all, know that you're not what he thinks you are. You're a hard working mother of three children and one on the way. He has no right to treat you the way he does and expect that you'll do as he pleases sexually. If this is all he wants you around for and is not going to be there to support you throughout this pregnancy and with your children at home, then why stay. He'll have to provide you with child support for your children, which will help you raise them. The swinging can be part of the reason you ask for the divorce when filing as well as lack of support with the children and pregnancy. <br>  You don't need someone around who is going to make you feel bad about yourself and just stress you out even more during this difficult time. You deserve a strong support system and I don't know if you have a family that can help you, maybe mom, dad, sisters but turn to them for support. Find yourself a small apartment to start off with and take it from there. He will have to help you support the children financially by law. <br>  <br>  Actually now that I think of it...he's the one that has to move out. That house belongs to you and your children.<br>  <br>  If you're worried about the children being angry about a divorce, think about how they'd feel if you stick around and the situation gets worst and they have to live with parents that fight all the time. If they can get the best of their parents but separately, then thats good enough. <br>  <br>  Please take care of yourself and this little baby you're carrying, who knows...she/he may be a world full of laughter and smiles for your future with your other children too. I think you're just in a rough situation and its hard to see any good when you have someone being the way he is to you. You're stressed and he's not helping you out...then why stick around with him. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck to you...and God Bless you and your children.|`|AXbdNdPzaa	Is swinging new to him?  Have you both done it?  Why did you allow yourself to get pregnant?  You have a lot of issues that need to be dealt with.  Does he want to stay married?|`|m8QfHC7uaa	Swinging....hummmm, that's a sign he's bored. The swinging is only fun for him when he has his wife to come home to.  <br>  The baby is extreamly important, don't loose faith in yourself you can handle this part.  However you cannot control him, and do you really want to use your energy trying to.  Let him know what you expect and can accept.  Don't live your life wondering when he'll come around, you need to make some serious decisions and make them now.<br>  What he's loosing is worth more than him trying to feed his sexual desires....You deserve more respect.  Get out of this unhealthy situation.|`|HL8PEDFLaa	Getting into the swinging lifestyle when you have hated it from the beginning has opened a huge can of worms. Your husband probably obsesses over all the other women that he could be sleeping with. This basically is justified cheating, but if you feel like you have too many issues then yes, get a divorce. He's not at all supportive and just imagine how alone you will be after you have it. Divorce would be best.|`|Q3qcnzHAaa	I'm not sure why ppl let their husband/wife have sex with other ppl and think they are going to be together for ever.  I wonder if there is any kind of study on how many ppl stay together once they have done the swinger thing?!  I have friends that are swingers, and I don't think they are going to make it either.  Interesting.|`|875b9562d8defd3804154e34c3bf5ea4aa	First take a breath. Yes you have lots of issues. Deal with one at a time.<br>  You both need to sit down and talk. Preferably with a 3rd person. Counselor. He needs to know how resentful you feel towards him. And you need to understand why he is so mean about the baby. <br>  Swinging only causes problems in a relationship. Yeah it may be exciting at first but it's never a good idea. <br>  Talk talk talk Communicate and compromise. That's about all you can do.|`|jgU4g6kGaa	Do you participate in this swinging activity?  I don't think that shows much respect in the marriage in the first place that was just a formula for disaster in the marriage.  If he is not dedicated to the marriage and the swinging and sex with other people is more important than his children then I would seriously begin to question if you should stay married to him.  Who wants a partner like that in life? You only know how much you can take and what you want to subject yourself and your children to don't let him demean you and make you feel like less of a person cuz it's him that is the scum if he can't even accept that you are going to have his child again.  I say dump him.|`|AA10686537	let him go. that kind of t is not good for your kids and not good for the baby your carrying. it will be hard but will be for the best.|`|4ZJhve83aa	I have been through the same crap as you. shoot me an email and  I can help ya out.<br>  dallastexastornado@yahoo.com|`|JVYs2TCpaa	If he is interested in swinging you are messing things up with your pregnancy. Being that he has made you a co conspirator in his cheating, by doing the couples thing, that now will come to a stop. He knew you had reservations anyway. Now he knows you will be very reluctant to swing, which in a nut shell, mean no extramarital coochie for him. Leave him and honestly consider if adding another child to your household as a single mom is a good idea. Just because your pregnant does not mean you have to have the baby. If you and your husband can swing Im sure abortion should not be that much of a moral dilemma
3CWaHiR1aa	Talk to God.|`|utGddhnVaa	being on an off can't help. but i broke up with my girlfriend 6 months ago and she moved to another continent so we haven't talk much but i still feel like you. I think you just have concenrate on doing things for yourself more and enjoy being with your other friends and family. that's more insight than answer but everyone heals in different ways and in different amounts of time.|`|trZ1NRLbaa	They time heals all wounds, you need to take one day at a time.    The worst thing you can do is spending time alone. So get out there and do things with friends!!|`|KW77oNWraa	im guessing you had a reason for the break up so uhm    its hard i just got broken up with to but its slowly healing it helps to hang out with friends and to listen to music     otherwise if you didnt have a reason then why'd you break up in the first place?|`|D27mJKmWaa	Horrible isn't it?    If I'm been honest... I don't think it ever completely goes away. Unless you find someone else you fall in love with. But true love is pretty rare IMO.    Sorry :(|`|7BkbvD7Zaa	I am in the same situation as you.    Only time will tell.|`|fZjBVUE2aa	i just went through this.  i took a break from her.  deleted her number. you should too.  that way you wont be tempted to call him or text him.  go out & have fun.  do something that will distract you.  meet other guys.  go out with them    & soon you wont miss him anymore.  i did all that & it took me 2 weeks to stop thinking over my ex.|`|Jd6FCVr3aa	omg i had the same problem. just tell yourself that he's not worth it. remind yourself that you ended it for a reason and that you are better than that. try to focus on friends and work and anything else. don't try to focus on guys till you think you're ready though cuz if you do it too soon you'll just remind yourself of him and get depressed.|`|IN1wPKwoaa	it would take half the time you spent with him.|`|E6kJE2x2aa	It took me about 4months I dated the guy for about a yr also. It really depends how much feeling you have for them. Its better if you go out alot and not be stuck inside cuz you will keep thinkin about him|`|994bad87c92a81fc299436a8b5ac1453aa	I'm sorry to hear that. Just keep yourself active by hanging out with friends and doing all the stuff you enjoy doing to distract yourself from thinking about him. It might take a few days or many even longer until you feel normal again but if you just distract yourself from him it helps a lot.|`|5vT3UDYaaa	Your going to hurt for a while, its natural. But you need to let yourself be hurt and then let yourself get out there and move on too. I'd honestly give it about 2 weeks until you dont hurt so bad to where you want to burst into tears at the sound of his name. Then after about a month you'll get even better and by that time will probably be looking at other guys with interest, maybe even sooner! :). But you have to realize that everyone heals from a breakup differently. When my boyfriend and I broke up I was still devastated after a week but it got better. You just have to go through those tear filled nights of crying and eating ice cream and watching sappy movies then the next weekend you let your girls take you out and have some fun to get him off your mind. This is going to happen more and more as you get older and trust me it doesnt  get any easier, but as you do get older you'll realize that he's not the only one meant for you, theres lots and lots of amazing guys out there that would love to get the chance to be with you. And I know you cant see being with anyone else right at this moment, but eventually you will :) and it will feel great and you'll be so happy yet again. This might help, think of the things you didnt like about him and the reason you arent together. Dont focus on the good lovey dovey times, think "he did ........... to me and ........ that one time" I dont need that jerk! And whatever you do-DO NOT let him come crawling back when you've finally gotten over him, that will only hurt 10x worse when this happends again..You'll be fine girl :) SMILE
aa29d6a547ed20a22d9f0cb13ee426f5aa	I think if your a guy and you like a girl you should ignore her so you dont look desperate, so he figures if the more he ignores you maybe you'll think he has some confidence in himself. When he was constantly staring at you, he didnt seem that attractive to you, but now that hes ignoring you I think now you might be interested in him. I think its good strategy on his part. Hope this helps.|`|VtZN0ov0aa	Maybe he's got the wrong idea and thinks you like Frank.  I think you should talk to him and get to know him, he's obviously interested if he keeps looking (:|`|KcR829Edaa	He probally still likes you but is shy confront him and tell him that you like him and see if he really does feel the same way. and remember those who reject you just arent good enough for you =]|`|Q0DfC12xaa	he likes you cuz that wat i do when i like someone|`|P6ulwhT7aa	Sounds like Edward cullen    interested in bella one day and not interested the nextt    hmm ask if hes a vampire?|`|x57o6wOoaa	well i think that at first when you said that he saw you with your  friend playing ping pong he might have tought there was something else going on...or he might have just been to shy to talk to you with another guy being there,,,you should try talking to him and see how he responds! Good Luck!|`|es9EgQIiaa	BY READING THIS I THINK YOU ARE CRAZY ABOUT THIS GUY AND I THINK YOU SHOULD TELL HIM   IF YOU KEEP JUST LEAVING HIM TO LOOK AT YOU ALWAYS AND NOT DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT HE WILL THINK YOUR NOT INTERESTED IN HIM AND MOVE ON   JUST TELL HIM DOSE HE FANCY GOING OUT WITH YOU SOMETIME ON A DATE AND TELL HIM YOU HAVE SEEN HIM LOOKING AT YOU BUT DID NOT KNOW HOW TO APPROACH HIM   JUST TELL HIM AND MAKE A MOVE BE-FOR ITS TO LATE AND HE THINKS YOUR NOT INTERESTED GOOD LUCK AND TAKE A CHANCE YOU NEVER KNOW WHATS HAPPENS XX|`|F4KrClClaa	this happened to me too. he would always look at me, but then he stopped all of a sudden. i think he either likes yuu or thinks ure weird. but i think its because he likes yuu, cuz if he flirted with yuu, he wouldn't think ure weird.|`|6120b4c0e14e03017c40ad3ceaa54fe7aa	I think he likes you!     I also think you like him, you seem to notice him a awful lot yourself.|`|sjMs7hN9aa	How come when I use to stare at girls they never seemed to notice?  Well, it is obvious that he likes you but there are times when you are not the first thing on his mind.  He could have other things that are bothering him or that he is thinking about and for that moment in time you are not the first thing on his mind.  He sounds a bit like me in that he stares and talks, even sometimes flirts, but never seems to make the move to anything serious.  Its nothing bad, just means he doesn't know how you feel and that he is shy.  At least, that's how I was.  Bottom line, you gotta talk to him and see whats up.  If you like him, you might have to be the one to let him know.  Get him to come out of his shell.  If you don't like him, then don't let it get to you if he's not giving you 110% of his attention, we guys get distracted from distractions at times too.|`|3y0w1qIBaa	He definitely likes you.|`|7BkbvD7Zaa	Talk to him.    Good Luck|`|Tc1BO5kkaa	kinda creepy stalker-ish... try talking to him?|`|80d1d6fe2144b194ba682f4f40b2aed6aa	Don't worry, guys will have on/off days just like you do. I suggest if you like this guy, just go up there and talk to him yourself or include him in some activity you are doing. Once you are talking and friendly you will be better at guaging what he is thinking. Right now you are only don't have the full story.|`|r4CJ0NbHaa	well maybe when you were playing ping pong and laughing with with your friend he thought you were interested in your friend. I think you should try talking to him and really see whats going on.
SjD1aKT5aa	Her parents obviously don't want her dating probably at this age so you either tell her how you feel and then talk to her parents about it or you'll have to move on.<br>  <br>  <br>  :] Kiki|`|jrWpHYAPaa	Maybe her parents are the type of over protective ones.<br>  <br>  And it's sweet that you wrote those letters! But I think that love should be personal. I thought it was kind of weird that you asked her to show them to her parents.  Maybe she thought the same too.  Or maybe she thought you were moving way too fast? (introducing her parents to  this guy thats not even her bf yet)<br>  <br>  Maybe the next thing you could do is ask her what she meant by that? was it a joke? because you really don't understand.|`|wpbN9ynEaa	what did you write in the letters!?! it must have been bad if that is what her parents would say! sorry if I wasn't any help but I'm being honest..|`|b7jWXN4Vaa	ask her if she was being fo rizzle.|`|WD94WyICaa	I usually tell boys all kinds of crap because I don't want to date until after school.  I mean after high school.  Get's lonely but my grades stay up.|`|GYky9nzGaa	it kinda sounds stalkerish from this point of view. sorry, but it all depends on what you put in those letters.|`|LQJJIANiaa	She likes you! Normally if someone makes a joke like that they are interested in you. Ask her out!|`|92HoC2OWaa	awwwwwwww ur cute<br>  ok um ask her out u seem really nice if she sayz no i'll date u lol|`|toLCaFc9aa	First, is she in love with you?<br>  <br>  Second, that police thing I think was a joke.<br>  <br>  And, if you are girlfriend and boyfriend, the normal thing would be to take care of that together, it sound like you are doing all the work.|`|V6dz395kaa	just ask her before its too late!
hkl6Zz2zaa	well try to do things right and and this guy that call you a name just dont listen to him walk away and with your parents just talk to them and tell them what your doing wrong|`|IcH5gMICaa	Yeah, you're not bad.  Compared to my sister, I was an angel and she was like the popular girl in school.  She was doing things my parents still don't know to this day and I was supposed to be the bad one.  I was the 4.0 that hung out with the really rough crowd and that's how I got labeled -even from my parents.  That's just where I fit in.<br>  <br>  I think it's good you recogize that some things are your fault and by making an effort just to recognize it, you are already on your way to stopping your behavoir.  It takes some people until adulthood to make a relationship with their parents.  Hell, I'm 25 and I still don't really have one, but that's not to say I won't.
bVROvLNSaa	I think your sister has the wrong friends - but you and your parents probably know that already.|`|JpuWdGLRaa	No no no don't apoligize. I'm sorry for your dad.

She'll be ok as long as she doesnt come back pregnant.  She's considered an adult now and if she wants to act stupid, she can do it on her time now.  It is time for dad to let her go and let her make mistake on her own to learn from. As for you, its a good thing one of his daughters got some sense!  Keep an eye on your big sis and dont repeat history! make the right choices in life by doing the opposite of what she's doing. At 18 I remember that i only thought about what "I" wanted and didnt care about what others wanted for me. Just let her go...It's about that time!|`|VmPkgVPXaa	I have a sister who has done the same thing. I think she is being stupid. She just wants to do whatever she wants. She doesnt care about anyone and just wants to have a good time like a kid. Well she isnt a kid anymore she is an adult.|`|2Cw0DfaSaa	if she's the bad one then you can never get in trouble... isnt that how it works?   (sorry im an only child so i kinda dont know what your asking and dont really get your question)|`|JuqxbJ3Daa	There is not much your father can do now since she's 18. It's sad though because from what you have written she seems like she's going to be on the road to nowhere. She doesn't realize it now but she will in time. Sounds like she might have got caught up into some drugs and alcohol. It happened to my nephew also, he got caught up in running with the wrong crowd of people to. Now he is a recovering heroin addict. And been in and out of jail and rehab. He came from a good family background. We love him very much and we have tried everything just about to get him on the straight and narrow. But we have come to find out that he has to want it for himself to straighten out and that might even take him hitting rock bottom before he does. I hope it works out for you and your father and she comes back home. It's going to be a long road. If she doesn't you should keep on loving her, she going to need you.|`|R29QkoQDaa	your sister sounds like a *****.|`|aHkDkWMVaa	ure sista had wrong frenz|`|uJ9waJDYaa	Seems she has been lead far too long astray and that if she has managed to pack up and move out to your mother then every ones Just going to have to wait for her to grow up and then mend things herself.  You or your dad shouldn't feel bad for what has happened. Just try comfort your dad and say that you will always be here for him and that at least you have eachother and you will never have anything less than that.  Hopefully if not in a couple of years at least in 6 years she will have grown up, gotten a job, become a stable honest person who cares about her family. Good luck and dont dwell on the past and what she is doing

Just watch him, look on from a far. In specific situations various personality traits may be evoked. <br>  <br>  If a guy is interested in you.

They'll be quiet and kept to themselves because they don't want you to get the impression about them that they want to use you like all the other guys who approach you.  They do this to set themselves apart.  <br>  <br>  The downside is that nice guys generally don't have a lot of confidence until you date them for a while.  Most of the time this lack of confidence is rooted in nothing other than not having a girl, but with you there, they grow into being much stronger people.    They'll also be fairly ugly or otherwise unattractive.  The more girls a guy is with during his lifetime, the more spoiled he becomes, so the less attractive guys who never have those girls available to them are much nicer people.   <br>  <br>  The same can be said for girls, usually the uglier ones that guys don't want have the great character and genuine goodness and generosity in their hearts, even though sometimes their personality (confidence, self-esteem, etc) is not so beautiful.|`|q1EDNQhBaa	1.

I am also very romantic and kind to girls, not to mention passionate....see how looks can be deceiving lol!?<br>  <br>  I even hold girls while they cry in my arms, and kiss them on the forehead|`|vTra7n5baa	The genuine nice guys that women really want aren't necessarily sweet or super generous.  They're generally pretty hard to get!  Guys can play that way too.  Many women give up on this as they think the guy should do all the work.  They often settle for men who call them b----s, s---s, etc.|`|OIOebJyIaa	observation, conversation, experience.

3BwPtNi2aa	Too much...|`|ECe1rgsdaa	Average is technically around $28,000. Way too high! Mine will be about $6,000. But then again, some people pay $100,000! Craziness!|`|s6stLtvLaa	I believe my wedding cost about $15,000.  Some have a nice wedding on less (my friend has a $10,000 wedding but she cut out ALLOT of stuff) and some do a little more.  I had a very inexpensive wedding compared to my older brother (his wife's parents had to take out a second mortgage on their house).  I had my ceremony in a Catholic Church, then I had the reception at a country club.  I had a great DJ for $500 (we almost ended up spending $3,000), my flowers were about $1500 (if you want a relatively cheap florist cost then go with seasonal flowers, they are less expensive.  We went all out on the bouquets, but all seasonal flowers for the centerpieces).  My dress and Accessories came to about $1500.  The photographer was the most expensive at $2500 (but way worth it).  I was kept in the dark on other costs, since my dad paid for the wedding.|`|kRh3slhdaa	Around $28,000 nationwide..but varies differently from city to city|`|Ism92isCaa	I hear it's about $10,000 to $15,000 (average), but we paid about $6,000 ---a small family and familiar friends invite. Adults only.|`|VpCtXEMGaa	The average is about $28,000. I spent less then $1,000. Most people are spending a lot less, because of money issues
af644b7256e7bf5a53974bb99a32d482aa	You wear too much make-up and your hair looks kind of...over-dyed. Try less make-up and a more natural color, and you're lovely.|`|RjpPzbBJaa	How many times are you going to ask this question?    I cannot give you my opinion...honestly, it would not be what you're wanting to hear, I'm sorry...|`|rcut6bhoaa	I agree on the lipstick,  tone it down some.      Other than that, DONT CHANGE A THING !    You are Beautiful !    When I am looking for a woman,  I look at the looks first.  Then I get to know her and find out what is on the inside, personality, morals, etc.  Its is what is on the inside that counts the most.  Good Luck|`|6fLxNyVpaa	i think you are very pretty BUT you might wanna tuck those in... lol|`|FBhjhjR0aa	you are pretty. somewhat average, But I wouldn't make fun of you or call you ugly. I would suggest that you don't use that bright of a lipstick, cause it takes away from your eyes. Instead try a light soft pink color, more of a natural tone. and don't show some much booby, that makes you come off a little s-l-u-t-t-y|`|CCFhjtNBaa	Pretty but remember, it's not just looks that help you get a man. And your not in competition with other women|`|byWl2fw0aa	You're decent looking.   But in my opinion, you're wearing too much make up - thus making you less appealing.     Less jewelry will also increase your chances. We men don't like to look at a woman who wears too many expensive items, as we think that is what it takes to make you happy...aka Gold Digger. (Not an appealing image).    If you want a new man...personality is more important than appearance.|`|ZpltzTIfaa	I think you need some confidence...you wear too much make-up and you are worried about what people on yahoo answers think?|`|AA12127714	it's not about how hot you think you look,it's about how you feel about yourself and how confident you are about the way your life is going...    yes,you can find a man to pay attention to you but can you keep him if he looks past your outward appearance?|`|dcb024b5e2b5c65f694bdddd3199db68aa	I'd get a hair to better frame your face.  Long hair is sexy, but shorter hair can be more playful and confident.  The red lips are a bit strong.  I would tone is down a little.  Make up is to compliment your appearance not mask it.  If you go for a more natural beauty look you would be more approachable.  At a glance I would guess you are on the high maintance side, but the more natural beauty look could it to a low maintance side.  Think Catherine Zeta Jones.  Beautiful, but not overly done.|`|P1KbWHImaa	agree w/ mrs g completly.|`|AA12202402	lol my sister-in-law had that surgery....You are cute normal and clean up well.....But that doesn't mean you will even get a good start towards a GOOD MAN. Looks are something in the bedroom but we all must leave there and deal with life. So I can not tell you if you are going to get with a GOOD MAN. Men are born to breed.....ROFL that part I feel you will do ok in but finding a lasting love partner has more to do with the inside not just the outside  PS. I am tall slender and clean up well too if that helps with understanding my answer...|`|zHwlGhIAaa	i'm going to answer the question you asked and not give you advice that you already know.  You are a pretty woman. You could lighten your hair a little as it seems too dark on you and maybe wear a more even toned lipstick.  Try not to line your bottom brow.  Wear some earth toned eye shadow.  And I like black too but try to lighten the colors up.|`|K6vEbdqxaa	nice new knockers|`|niSRQw53aa	You're gorgeous!  You shouldn't have any problem finding a new man.  Just make sure he wants more than just your body!
yQFlAZIMaa	if you don't feel love and don't want to say it then don't. people throw that word around too much without anything behind it. I say stay how you are and don't just fall into the "norm". i would just be like "aww thanks" or "how sweet" or something when someone says they "love" you unless you love them back. but those feelings are okay and and people should respect that.|`|OG6Q3Athaa	Only say it if you mean it, if you question yourself if you should say it then you might. Yea some ppl use it after a week of going out, I think it's a useless word if you don't mean. But if you are nervous ask yourself why, how much does he/she mean to me, etc|`|zr7w5pDbaa	That's a good thing. Hey, we know you're not a whore! lol.     -Shanna|`|ddaK9gWcaa	Don't worry, I'm the same. It's normal|`|sqisRXxxaa	It's much easier to say the phrase "I love that song" than "I love you." I don't know why.|`|pKzH1cFHaa	You shouldn't say I love you if you don't mean it.|`|axylPYftaa	yeah, me too. the word love is cliche and so overused, it has lost its meaning    you love me, trick? you just love my money|`|ZtFEQwiPaa	na ur fine im the same way. if a girl says i love u to me i cant say i love u back unless i mean it. my girlfriend at this time is the only girl ive ever said i love u too and i really do mean it lol|`|joem8hQeaa	Me too. I've only been able to say it to my family and my best friend. I have had like 2 boyfriends and they both said it to me and I'm like "Me too". I couldn't say it. I'm actually pretty sure I said "Thankyou" once. LOL.
W76VDFKCaa	Because they love you!!!  You may not understand now but one day when you have children and look back then you will realize why.|`|WOHc22Xiaa	Because if they are not you'll run around acting like a damn fool!
WJjfrf0Caa	Is your boyfriend Drew Peterson? j/k    I was going to talk about how the entire relationship is weird because you probably didn't have a good father and now you've found one, but you would never understand the psychology of it.  So I'll take a different route.    Anyways, they can't accept it because it violates the creepy old guy rule.    everyone always asks, "how much of an age difference is okay?"    Here is the math for the Creepy Old Guy Rule:    take the guy's age = 48  divide by 2 = 24  add 5 = 29    So a male that is 48 can date a 29 year old girl and it would be okay. if the girl is any younger, then the guy looks like a creepy old guy.    sorry, but i think you are going out with a creepy old guy.    but the real issue is that his technically adopted daughters still see him as a father and a girl their same age is nailing a girl their same age. that's just weird. it doesn't matter that he is their uncle cause they still see him as a father figure.|`|3IfBUUH0aa	Tell them to mind their own business, otherwise when they get boyfriends you'll wreck it for them.|`|pvJH5HQ5aa	Okay...  What if you were the necices, and your mother figure died, then your father figure was dating someone your age? How would that make you feel? Honestly. Well thats what they are feeling.   Maybe they will get a little easyer about it?  But its really there choice.|`|WOHc22Xiaa	It's your Business and if you love each other then they just need to leave you guys alone and accept it because it's your lives. If you two are happy then they should be happy for you. If I was in their shoes though I think I would probably be upset though a little but like I said it's not my life so I'd get over it.|`|wzXJOSIeaa	If they really love your boyfriend then they will accept that he is happy with you. And maybe you need to sit down and talk with his nieces   Because a lot of times young woman just go after older men for their money. And if that's not the case with you then let them know that. If they are still acting childish then just forget them and go on living your life happily and if they come around then good if not then that's fine too.|`|c43c4f873b96d5b8ae08c90457ffed18aa	Your bf needs to man-up and let his nieces know that if they want to see him, they must at least act respectfully towards you. They don't have to love you, but if you are going to be part of the family then they must accept that.    He's got to set some boundaries that include protecting you against unnecessary rudeness. If he doesn't - hmmmm. . . . perhaps he's not as much of a man as you thought.    Good luck.|`|blVOODknaa	A lot of people have similar reactions when they encounter couples with huge gap between them. The best thing you can do is to talk about your boyfriend and explain to him how tense the situation is for you. After all, if he has dedicated his life to raise his nieces, the least they can do is be happy for him. Maybe you need a family reunion or something because if this doesn't solve soon, your boyfriend might be put in a position where he has to choose between his nieces and you and that would be sad and unnecessary. Best of luck.|`|nh2ZfvZMaa	I hate to say it but age does matter.  Not because his nieces say so, but because nature says so.  He is getting close to his sexual peak according to experts and you have a while before you hit yours.  you think it doesn't matter now but by the time you find out for yourself it will be to late.  not that sex is all there is to a relationship.  he's probably more like a father figure than a boy friend if you really think about your relationship with him.|`|AA11970801	why cant you get someone ur own age it doesnt hurt, i mean his nieces think its nasty, i do too, no offence thats just my opinion. I mean its a 27 years different, you get a guy thats like 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 years older than you. It probably looks like hes dating a teenager cause ur young, and the nieces dont want it to look like their uncles got problems, they just want somebody more older.like if u ever have kids, the kid might have down syndrome because one parent is too old, sometimes because parents are too old you have to have kids before 39, well the topic isnt about kids, but the nieces can only change by themselves.|`|pBpl3Bgaaa	Tell them to kiss your azz, for your not marrying them, your marrying your boyfriend.  They need to cowboy up and except the fact you are who you are, and if anyone else has a problem with it, they can stay away too.  Your not going to like that answer because it's not what you want to hear, you think it's mean, but if you do not stand your ground now, that whole family will push you out of the way.  Those two gals are adults and need to find respect for you, and if they do not respect you, then they do not come into your house.  As for sniping you when you are with your boyfriend, I would remind them they are adults not children, and if they continue acting like brats, then you will treat them like brats.  Oh and have a couple of diapers with you to give them so everyone will see you will not put up with a couple of babies.
WOHc22Xiaa	All you can do is talk to your mom. It's kinda her decision. Or you can call child services or whatever but that won't do much accept cause more problems. If your old enough to move out then do that. or if your already moved out then like I said it's your moms life there's nothing you can do but talk to her.|`|BjtqWNt8aa	Tell your Mom how you feel, especially if you feel the situation is not safe for you and for her.     If talking to her has no effect, talk to your Dad, tell him what the problem is and ask if you can live with him...He'll have to take it to court to get custody unless your Mom is willing to let you live with him without having the court involved.     You had better follow his rules though or you'll have another problem. Does he have a girlfriend? If he does, you better get along with her or that will be yet another problem.      If your Dad is not available, talk to your Grandparents or aunts or uncles...etc...if none of them are available, talk to the Police or the Department of Human Services....|`|Kopwh91paa	Kick him in the balls
180db111cb7c264e5bd192d677bd9c1faa	Hey Princess,  it's a bummer when the people you love and care for the most will not support you and your dreams.  For God's sakes, that's what we parents are here to d, to guide and support and encourage you to be do and have everything your heart desires.  I'm really sorry that they are not being supportive in your goals.      But it sounds as if your teachers at the college are in your corner.  Those are the people I would listen to.  And I would seek out more people who support and encourage me.      I know that Mom and Dad are the ones you seek approval from but sometimes, as adults we cannot get them to see us as they should.  This is the time when we are allowed to venture out and seek the advise and encouragement of those who see us in a different light.      There is always therapy for the three of you, because there is something there that is broken in your relationship.  Any mother that would call her child stupid definitely has issues that are beyond normal talking to.  But that will take time, if you could get them to even agree to counseling.    Right now you need a shot of okay-ness and the support of people who want to see you do well.  So, continue with your plans and with school, listen to the teachers who encourage you and to anyone who takes a positive shine to what you're doing and learn to internalize their words instead of those of your parents.      Good luck to you.
WOHc22Xiaa	You accidentally did what to her box of tampons? Anyway just let her cool down.|`|EsnFmcMFaa	that sentence doesnt make sense    i accidentally her whole box of tampons    just say sorry
AA10065812	Yes, that is what the child support is for.  You might consider leaving a few things there to reduce what needs to be taken.|`|48846255239e6cfd4e8b805cbae9c844aa	if you send clothing, it should come back washed.  as far as food and diapers, he should have some stuff at home for visits, just my opinion...    *** Times are really tight for some people these days,  just how strapped is this guy? is he financially hurting because of the child support?  if so he may need you to send some supplies.|`|WOHc22Xiaa	He pays child support to you so you can buy the thing the baby needs. That should stop him from still buying his child things anyway it's still his child and it would be nice for him to have thing at his house but like I said You get the money you buy the stuff. Try to work out any agreement with him.|`|3GG5Lx7zaa	ok, I say that he shouldnt be complaining about what should be brought with the child and have stuff at his house.  My ex would have a whole set of clothes/diapers/drinks...for my son for when he went to dads.  My mom says she thinks you should provide, but i say put a diaper and a sippy cup and a snack or two. You know, enough to get him to dad's house comfortably. Its up to you to give him what he needs, i say.  He would have to take you to court to put it in the paperwork to specifically say what needs to be in his bag.  He needs to stop being a tightt azz.    The way me and my ex do it and my son is 13 now, is he has dads clothes at dads house and moms clothes at moms house. He goes in my outfit, dad changes him asap and sends him back with the outfit he had on. or dad would put my dirty clothes in a back and when he went back, i would send back dads clothes that he had on when i received him.  Get this straight now cause i dealt with the same type guy and it doesnt stop till you say no! (and stick with your word)|`|vJphK7cwaa	it is his son too! just because you get child support does not mean you have to provide him with necessities. let him know that your son is with you the majority of the time, and that money pays for food, electricity, gas, and other everyday things that every person needs. unless he wants him to live in the dark and starve, and unless he wants to pay more so you can sit home all day and not spend any money on gas to bring him to and from daycare, and to and from the doctor. i wouldn't even bring my son to him. it shows how much he cares about his child and how much he cares about the money. which one is more important buddy? sorry to be so blunt but it really bothers me when fathers say that.|`|49d74bd8b100117274d25e31b1942932aa	WHY wouldn't you send clothes? Unless he is not sending them back, but, of course you send clothes. that IS what the child support is for.   clothes/diapers/formula   and whatever else.       I'm sorry-but, i'm TOTALLY with the dad on this one.    Unless the dad is not sending the clothes back to you-   you should be sending them.    otherwise if I was the dad,  I would put the UGLIEST clothes on the child and walk around with the child in the town that you live in.|`|sIL7H8RBaa	If the child is with you all but every other weekend or every weekend, then I do think that he is within his rights to ask that you send clothes and such with your son.  Would you want to have to buy a wardrobe for a child that only spent 4 days a month with you?      It may be easier for everyone (and more comfortable for the child) to have his own things in each home, though.  I think that he sounds like a jerk, but he is at least not being an unreasonable jerk.    Good Luck!

vUypopU8aa	thats how my life was for a while, you can change a person, but you can tolerate them,  why dont you try getting closer to your other friends, and leave those 2 b*tches alone until you absolutely HAVE to talk to them.
MYPMoVg4aa	Its totally understandable that you cant stop thinking about it,<br>  that your stressing your mind wondering if it could be you.<br>  The chances are it might be i mean he went out with you for a reason remember he was attracted to you looks and personality. Of course ex's are ex's for a reason but there was also a reason why they went out in the first place. If your still good friends he obviously thinks about you a lot and if his best friend says its you then it sounds like it is.<br>  Personally i think it's about you.|`|MB1Er06Jaa	I'm assuming he still has feelings for yooh.|`|yiLHPpZEaa	You should ask him who he was talking about.

I wonder if you really did want to end your relationship with him, after all? If you're hoping he still has romantic feelings towards you, then my guess is no...<br>  <br>  If it's bothering you that much just ask him about it. If he still has feelings for you and you want to give it another go, you might as well see where he stands with you.

v64IwD5xaa	I think u fear rejection. U r scared of relationships because of ur parents bad one. U need to open urself up to more people. It may feel uncomfortable at first, but being with friends is one of the true joys of life. Don't think that u are the only one out there with this problem. First u have to open urself up to friendships, and then once u develop certain social skills, a romantic relationship. Don't be stupid, everyone wants to have sex, its part of being human. You need to develop self-esteem, and realize that u are good enuf. You CAN make friends, you CAN get guys to like you. It's all a matter of confidance.
OvX1u8Suaa	wow! u really are having some bad luck. my mom died of cancer also,although it was long time ago i still miss her like crazy. sorry too hear about the epilepsy and its a shame we cant choose our familys cos ur sister sounds somewhat cruel if she keeps trying too hurt you.have u asked her why? same with your dad have u asked him why he wont go too ur wedding?   you say u have nothing going for you? wot about ur fiance (soon too be ur wife), and ur babies.    i myself was an identical twin but she unfortunately died,   u have EVERYTHING going for you, concentrate on ur immediate family then sort out ur differances with your sister and ur dad,if they wont do the same then at least you tried.  best of luck
jRSzIzYqaa	There are, but typically they can control it unless they are flustered or nervous. It's a fairly sure sign that you make her nervous.|`|aIQ77UnTaa	Whats your question? <br>  If a girl blushes around you, do they like you?<br>  <br>  I blush ALL the time around people i don't even know, so i guess it depends on if she's shy. Observe her and see how often she blushes, if she doesn't she blush often, she might like you.|`|XL1qZboKaa	Not a sign. They could just be embaressed. Girls blush very easily. If that was true, I wouls be the most liked in the whole US.|`|b7jWXN4Vaa	hah i blush whenever something embarassing happens, or i recieve a complement.|`|9jFmNbIxaa	OHM IGOD<br>  i always blushhhh<br>  i cant control itt<br>  its so annoyinggg:$<br>  buh im not shyyy|`|4QfbqQHIaa	What Are You Asking?|`|t7LlAmZnaa	A sign of what?|`|C44Ux50paa	i get red all of the time. i wouldn't take it as an indicator of anything necessarily. could be hormones/hot flash
GhZQGu9Maa	Sometimes when people don't have much to offer, they'll offer their sorrow in an effort to connect.  Sharing intimate details of life usually comes later in a relationship and certainly after you've become unattached to the one you WERE dating.  The healthy thing to do would be to thank him for trusting you but let him know that so much information at once, and so early in your "relationship" had you confused.  Tell him to break up with his girlfriend and move out before he continues with you.  If his girlfriend is indeed controlling and possessive, maybe it's because he's the kind of guy who would share intimate details of his life with another girl and try to have sex with her.  This guy sounds like a real loser who isn't ready for a real relationship with anyone until he matures and evolves.  You deserve a man who despite his past, can have a healthy life and isn't involved with ANYONE.  You also should have a man who doesn't cheat.  Sounds like you need to evolve too.  You need to learn how to spot a good man and make sure he gets a lady who wouldn't help him cheat!|`|Q3qcnzHAaa	Unfortunately, there is ppl out there who do play on other's emotions.  Looks like that's gonna be up to your best judgement.  Just take things slowly.|`|MuVKeK8faa	He's trying to get into your pants.|`|chENztVEaa	You don't have much self esteem do you?  Can't you see the red flags this guy is giving you?  Do you really believe he is moving from his girlfriends?  I can't imagine that you would even consider being sexually active with this guy.  You need to start putting somne space between the two of you and go on with your life.  He is obviously trying to get you to feel sorry for him in hopes that he can take advantage of you in some form or another.  If you dump him he will dish out the same sad song to the next victim until he finds a sucker to mooch off of.  RUN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!...|`|bO2rzfISaa	Make him a therapy appt. God, what a turnoff.|`|jgU4g6kGaa	I would take it as a sign for you to run!!! He sounds like he has way too many issues that will not make anything you have to do with him enjoyable.  If all these things happened to him he needs to seek help for himself or do something about it to make it better not unload it on you!  He sounds like a very needy person too and that's never a good thing in a man. It will eventually drive you nuts it would be better to get out now and find a more emotionally stable man.
3K1QW7Oeaa	Be reasonable.    Maybe they can't afford it because of the way the economy is.    Annie1991 - It's 13 for boys and 12 for girls.|`|UG1wEbBJaa	No boys can have their bar-mitzvah at 12. My cousin had his at 12. Sometimes parents can be short on money which may be why they cannot throw a big party. My father didn't have a lot of money, but we put together whatever we could get and had a party at a hotel. See if your parents or friends have any connections to places that you can make reservations with. I'm sure something will work out. Tell them it would mean an awful lot to celebrate with the people you care about. Good luck, and congratulations.|`|R29QkoQDaa	say that that is what u want and it is your birthday so thay should do it for you|`|BjtqWNt8aa	Are you Jewish?...'cause if you are not Jewish you don't need the party, right?...If you are...do what your parents think is enough for you...Party's cost big money...maybe they don't have the money to spend?|`|Jolz0CVvaa	correct me if i'm wrong...but don't you have a bat mitzvah when you're 13, not 12?|`|pOsV0Tu2aa	Umm...

RWvPhYgyaa	Personally, I think you should inform somebody you can trust. It seems to me you are carrying a lot on your shoulders. Maybe a teacher or friend? You should make someobody aware.  You should most deffinatly keep your phone handy at ALL times.  Have you tried speaking to both or one of your parents about it, express your concerns/worries about your mum to her, or even another relative, if you can't make them see sense, maybe somebody else can.   Always remember you are not to blame. Being caught in family arguments is awful, try to steer clear, a friends house nearby, a relative?    I hope things get better for you and your family.  Best wishes    HLK x|`|RjpGomsyaa	Sounds like you need to keep the phone handy & ring the police if you think you are at risk|`|pKzH1cFHaa	If they do it again, call the cops and keep calling until something is done about it.|`|meLGAZLcaa	That's terrible.  You should go and see your doctor, they can advise you on psychological issues. They will phone your parents and tell them what affect its having on your lifestyle and health.|`|NX9Dj2qraa	Tell them how it makes you feel - say it from the heart (not some practiced mumbo jumbo), because if they can tell its really coming from you, then they should see that you are serious. Mention that it makes you distressed, restless... just however it makes you feel.  Ive been through the exact same thing, my dads an alcoholic and he used to get kinda violent and i would struggle to sleep because i was scared that one day he would take it too far and kill her. I told my parents, they sorted out their differences (although my mum now sleeps in the guest bedroom) they get on alot better (but as 'friends'), and even though my dad is still an alchi hes more of a pleasent one!    Remember your not alone, its scarily common, even though the majority of peoples familys appear 'perfect' - its not always the case.  Good lucky hun, things will get better xx|`|GueeOvbOaa	sorry for ur fear with all the trouble. mind me ask u how old are u? and i could can help u a bit.|`|AA11970801	THEY NEED A DIVORCE! call the police, keep the phone ready to dial when they argue, and stay close by both of them|`|AA10996874	This sounds terrible for you, how old are you?    Don't get in the middle of a fight between the two of them, you could get hurt.  Have you got an adult you can talk to about this, maybe an older relative or someone at school?    If you need to talk to someone then you can always phone childline  the number is 08001111, or talk to someone online, click on this link    http://www.childline.org.uk/pages/defaul...|`|4QoHrLfqaa	So horrible!|`|zHtV6UO4aa	I can't say much, but my parents argue A LOT and all I know is that interfering isn't the answer, they just get more mad :O(
7gH7sgi6aa	Your Mother is always going to be herself, even after you have gone to University and gotten a job and moved away.<br>  Do whatever you can to "brush up" your housework skills just enough to shut her up,  I agree that studies are very important.  I too am a bookworm and quite antisocial...but let me tell you that at age 48 I own my own corporation.<br>  Yes, I like to read, enjoy my computer, but do have business partners and meetings and some friends, but still am a bit anti social.<br>  I am married, have two grown Sons, and am a Grandmother of a two year old.  My Mother still plays favorites with my Sister and I've accepted that if I was President of the US I couldn't do enough to please her.<br>  Do your best,  keep up with your studies..<br>  Do you, be you, love you.  You will go far.<br>  Peace, Love & Happiness
AAexkTAKaa	that hapens to me, when i was a child they were nice to me, but now im a teenager, they stereotype me. if im tired its 'becuase im a teenager', if im in a bad mood its 'because im a teenager', if i cry and i dont know why its ' becuase im a teenager', if i do anything naughty its 'because im a teenager'. i could go on for hours. i keep telling them, 'all teenagers are different, they have personalities, like anyone else. i dont like being stereotyped.' but they just roll their eyes! its so annoying!|`|8TmK8Qklaa	Could it be that you act differently now and they haven't changed?|`|AA12155452	It's simply that you are maturing into an independent person and as such their lives take precedence as 'they simply have to get on with it' .... it's tough surviving nowadays and while you are not forgotten, it's easier to let you do your own thing while they do theirs ..... that's the way it is as we grow up, we are accepted more into the adult world and need less attention, or at least that's the perception.|`|ae3e1d351362ce2aa8644626c2d77f9caa	When you are little, you are dependent on them, now you are somewhat independent, they are probably leaving you to your own devices because you are that awkward age, talk to them and tell them how you feel, they probably do not even realise.Tell them that you would like to be considered and not to be made to feel invisible, they will probably be pleased that you want to interact with them, many teenagers, separate themselves from their parents as if they know nothing, they are aliens lol<br>  It is all part of growing up, you are at a very awkward age, when you are neither child nor adult. So many people get stressed because of lack of communication, talk to your parents, you may be pleasantly surprised. Take care!|`|BgClmJb8aa	your question is a bit confusing<br>  <br>  You've probably changed not your family, because you change the most during puberty|`|9lmTVu20aa	Not quite sure exactly what you mean here, but it's possible it's beacuse of your age.|`|xNjtfXcuaa	I believe this is a question that is too complicated for yahoo answers. You sound like you are having a hard time. Are you at school? Could you talk to your counselor? They may have better advice.
4Pe8yZnuaa	Only to the police.......|`|KLFVEUtGaa	No.... don't let age get in the way with your feelings.|`|5031cb559a6c3c75778b421b4a8a73e5aa	Yes it does matter if you want to stay out of jail. But it happens all the time.|`|AA11582400	nope..it doesnt dear...unless it's truly love and not lust ..|`|uFbytsw5aa	Well love is love... but that is a four year difference. Me and my boyfriend are three years apart. but it's legal to be with anyone five years older then you and five years younger then you. so you are in the clear... but hopefully you aren't having sex because that is illegal because the legal age is 16.|`|ygGr1nX7aa	The short answer is yes- while none of them are necessarily insurmountable, such a relationship is going to present a lot of difficulties.    Intimacy is obviously going to be a big issue.  It depends where you are, but it will most likely be at least two, quite likely four years before it's legal to do *anything*.  You can get in serious trouble for crossing that line- but when you have strong feelings, it will be unbelievably hard at times, and perhaps put a lot of strain on the relationship, not to do so.  I'm neither condoning nor condemning, but observing that it's a very narrow and difficult line to walk.  Depending on who is which, the risk of teen pregnancy is extremely serious; in an impulsive and unguarded moment (and you WILL have them), it would be all too easy to potentially ruin both your lives.    Your parents will probably factor into this heavily.  If you're lucky, they will give you a chance to earn their trust if you are honest, respectful and careful about the relationship.  No truly caring parents would turn a blind eye to such a situation.  If you are unlucky, or try to keep it a secret and are discovered, you could quickly find yourself  in a situation which is completely untenable.    You are also both going through many changes, and in six months or a year may be very different people than you are now, and different all over again a year after that.  Chances are at least one of you has little experience with relationships, and don't necessarily know what you want or need from a partner.  Neither of these things mean you won't stay together, but it does mean that it is impossible to guarantee, no matter how strongly and passionately you feel now, that the relationship will last.  At 18, you will quite like start college or work soon (if you have not already)- your horizons will be expanding, your perspectives changing, kind of like when you were 12 and suddenly seemed so much older and bigger than the little kids.  You will also meet a lot more people your age, with your interests, and my find yourself tempted or losing interest.    I'm only scratching the surface here.  Objectively, it might make both your lives much, much easier to separate now, and look each other up in four years.  But I've been in a similar situation, and I understand how intoxicating and irresistable first love can be.  You both have a lot of hard decisions to make, and I guarantee that no matter what you do, or choose, sooner or later this is going to hurt like hell.  Think carefully, be honest, and good luck.|`|iMiXGGxQaa	Not it's not right.  A 14yr old girl is still considered a child, where as 18 is considered young adult.    There would be a power indifference between an 18yr old man and 14 yr old girl as in 14 yr old girl will think the sun shines out your ***!    Jail bait!
GfCRiueRaa	Heya, I'm Filipino/Chinese/Spanish and 5'6", grew up in the Philippines and am now in a school with a more than a 50% Asian population (more or less). <br>  <br>  5'10" is tall, compared to the average Asian girl, but it's not something to be bothered by.

eSx065Jhaa	silence means an afraid thoughts . there something you need to start .|`|igX9n3dyaa	See I think what you need to ask yourself is 'Is the silence actually awkward?' cause im kinda in the same predicament as you at the moment and we have little silent moments but i don't feel awkward about them and as far as im aware neither does he. I think if you do actually feel awkward then maybe that's telling you something but saying that at the same time if you've only been talking to him for a week and a half then its bound to happen, but like i said at the start you need to evaluate whether you do actually feel awkward about it or not.|`|C8C7eIBbaa	thats how i felt when i started talking to my current boyfriend, like it was akward all the time and i needed to keep it going but i couldnt. but the truth is that we definitley didnt have the comfort level and we needed it to grow for longer than a week, it took about two months, and now he is my best friend, my boyfriend, and my fiance and i couldn't be happier. it all just takes time.|`|QYNmekPfaa	I usually just bring up anything when an awkward silence happens, especially when I am with a girl I like.

It is never ok for a parent to abuse you.  Your mom needs help and that is how you can help her.  I teach parenting classes and as a professional can tell you that for your physical safety as well as your mental stability you need to stop the abuse.  With help your mom can stop the abuse and you can build a healthy relationship with her.  You need to protect yourself and get help. You must tell someone you trust to get you the help you need.|`|71JJ9GRVaa	This sounds really familiar. My mom is abusive and controlling too. I moved out 4 years ago, but she still tries to control my life.  U need to stand up for yourself, and stop it. I don't know how u r, but if u have the opportunity, leave, move out. Cause it's gonna scar u for life.   I'm 27 years old, live with her physical and verbal abuse for 24 years, I'm working through this now, it's very hard. U can't live your life like that. I'm stupid enough that I still feel bad for my mom sometimes, even though I shouldn't, I didn't do anything wrong, she just put it all in my head. I tried to stop a fight between her and brother once, while I was still living with her, and she turned to me, grabbed the broom, and hit me in the head with it. Then she went totally out of control and started yelling at us bad things, and said she wished we were never born. The next day she was pissed off cause I did not apologize to her. For what? I didn't do anything wrong.  U need to get away from that abuse, or else it will stay with you forever. Move to another family member or friend. My 18 year old sister ran away from home too, cause of my mother, now she lives with her bf and his family. I'm just happy she's away from that monster. Trust me, u need to get out of there fast. If u need to talk more let me know, u can email me. I know what u going through, it feels good to talk about it. Don't be afraid to email me.  Don't forget, it's your life, don't let anyone take it away from you, even if it's your mom.

U need to tell a school official, or neighbor etc ( basically anyone who can be objective) what is happening. I understand u don't want ur mother to get in trouble, but this may be wat needs to happen in order for things to get better. Ur mother may act irrationally when she finds out u told someone, but u need to do this. U need to talk to people and get urself out of this situation as quickly as possible. It doesn't sound like ur living in a healthy environment. Chances are this is affecting other aspects of ur life, including school, friendships etc. U need to deal with the fact that u may be removed from ur home, or ur mother may be subject to punishment. This process can take a while. Things may become worse before they get better. Please understand that u are not at fault here. Ur mother isn't doing this becasue of something u did, she is doing it because she needs help. U are one of the only people who can give her help. The only way u can give her help is by telling someone. Abuse is known to run in families. If u don't talk to people about it, then u won't stop the cycle.|`|u4liwDhAaa	Well, it's time to talk to a school counselor or an adult friend of the family that you can trust.      It's sounds like you and your folks need group counseling / family counseling before the situation escalates any further than it has!|`|bRi3ShlZaa	I'm sorry but if you want it to stop she's going to be in trouble. You need to talk to someone you trust about what is happening. A school counselor or a close family friend. It won't get better. You're going to have to get some help hun.
yiLHPpZEaa	You're worrying because you like her. And she won't blow you off cuz if she texted you back and answered it means she liked you too. Usually when a guys says they want to go out again girls cant wait for them to call. So if I were you I would forget about bad eperiences and have fun! Hope i helped|`|7z9eKO2maa	it's perfectly rational, you just had your heart broken, and i don't blame you in the slightest for being cautious about it... i think she likes you though, you say it as if she acts sincerly polite around you, so she most likely isn't trying to use you, and you say she had a great time one date number 1, she'll most definately meet you again, just be yourself and she'll go for you no problem (:<br>  good luck :D|`|69a7c9948e27297991c3af178e500e4daa	you shoulnt even worry about it if she does then let her. it just means that shes not the one for you. dont let it bother you and move on. yes your ex was terrible and you deserve better so why not look at all the fish in the sea. theres a lot of good girls out there for you not just her. I mean why cry over someone who doesnt love you enough to be happy with you.. its not worth it. but it worth looking for the right one for you...|`|tqdZmRCyaa	you're only worrying because you've had a tough time with women... i don't blame you, but with what you said, i'm pretty certain she won't blow you off. give her the benefit of the doubt, not all girls are the same.|`|e7lLnyGQaa	she might have texted back and answered just because she felt badly, but i doubt it. if she didn't want to go out with you again, then she probably wouldn't have answered your call.|`|i0uDt7H9aa	it sounds like she liked you. don't sweat it, see what happens on this second date. hang in there buddy, you can do it!|`|6dMrP7pkaa	If I had a horrible date I would not answer the call.  It sounds like she is interested.|`|Sy0HXSt5aa	Well when I text back, say I had a good time, and say yes to a second guy if that means I definitely am interested in a guy. Don't worry! If the girl is normal then she definitely likes you. You're ex-wife was really not normal  at all. I just want you to know that not every girl is like that. Good luck on the second date! It sounds like she's digging you so far.|`|gfksposqaa	She could still be interested, but you are nowhere near reeling her in yet, she's still feeling you out, as are you.  Take it easy and don't force anything.|`|vEVtXftTaa	If I didn't have a good time on the first date, there's no way I would even make a second date, let alone try to come up with an excuse to blow it off.  It sounds like she really likes you and your insecurity because of your other dysfunctional relationship is getting in the way of you accepting that.<br>  Remember: confidence is key!  She will never see anything in you if you don't see something in yourself. :)|`|SP3a6fGiaa	Don't worry, it seems she is interested because it is very easy to just no answer your calls and pretend nothing happened if she didn't like you so don't panic. Remember that everyone learns from their mistakes or misfortunes so if something "bad" were to happen learn from them but don't judge the world for it. People ARE DIFFERENT|`|JQZzI49Paa	Get it|`|tVBWoaJ4aa	No she'll go out with you again|`|zw323Zbyaa	I'm pretty sure she won't blow you off.  If she wasn't interested she probably would have made up some excuse not to go or wouldn't have answered her phone.  And I think the reason that you're so worried is because of what happened in your previous marriage.  So don't worry, maybe this girl will be the one. :)|`|lpyIKYUXaa	Your nervous :)<br>  Relax, she sounds interested.<br>  Think back at her body language on the first date, was there a posative vibe?<br>  What about when she was speaking to you on the phone, did she sound keen?<br>  I'm sure she won't blow you off without good reason.<br>  Unless she did something to make you think this.<br>  If she wanted to blow you off, she wouldn't have answered her phone and she would have avoided you..<br>  I hope i put your mind at rest a bit<br>  x|`|xNjtfXcuaa	Sorry about your past, but as a women I can tell you the most annoying thing is when a guy brings a past relationship into your new relationship. (Girls do it too). It sounds like she is doing everything she is suppose to. If she blows it off, big deal? Only one wasted night. Better to find out now. Never follow a first impression. Oh...And yes it sounds like she is in to you.|`|NxtC4p77aa	well i don't know if this is a joke but if it isn't wow you have been through a lot!<br>  <br>  are you sure your ready to date again? as you seem VERY worried about if she doesn't like you<br>  <br>  if she accepts a 2nd date you shouldnt be so worried be happy no girl is evil|`|ISreEChsaa	Unless your hiding the truth... By not saying when she said things sarcastically like "I had a great time" then she rolls her eyes... Then yes go ahead.|`|Or6RoRWDaa	If she replied to your text and even answered your phone call, she definitely likes you. Good luck!|`|hwKFm7H8aa	dude she wont blow u off...when a girl calls me or txts me and I dont want her...I just dont text back or answer the phone...she obviously likes you.|`|IYevTWlDaa	Iam sorry to hear all does things your X's did but it's time to move on!! If she picks up your call and texts you back their is a possibility she is into you. But you want a piece of  advice don't text her onless she want's you too!!! We prefer to talk to a guy than being text especially if your into her. I don't think you should worry about her blowing you off, you should start worrying when she doesn't your phone calls or texts... I don't blame you for worrying but it's time to give yourself a second chance at Love.
lOGHxtoUaa	he was probably joking around with u but the fact that u ask this means you like him so stop playing talk in person and ask him out theworst thing that can happen i she says "no" then u kick his butt in the game over and over and over again.  the chances i think that he doesn't like u is about 28% he does not like u. i would have responded "lol" as i stated earlier ask him out. (maybe u will see underneath the bubbles)lol|`|U4V6TkZEaa	If he is a (young) guy, then he thinks about sex ever so often.<br>  <br>  <br>  In other words, he is simply being heterosexual.

Sex is always on our minds, and sometimes, it just pops out, without thinking. So don't put too much into it. <br>  If it offends you, let him know, or just ignore his cheeky sexual remarks.
xNkmK0SHaa	1. Trustworthy:  (he/she does not tell others what I said)  2. Loyal: does not join in if/when someone talks negatively about me.        If he/she walks away from those doing that, WOW!! Special.  3. Helpful but not judgmental.  4. Seems as comfortable as a three year old pair of shoes.      Years ago, I read (somewhere):  "A friend is someone who knows who and what you are, where you have been, and still cares and lovingly invites you to grow."|`|VBtzeVlKaa	Loyalty, great communication, reliability, openness, and kindness... and of course, being able to laugh and have fun together as well  :)|`|C2olZsNiaa	Common interests  Loyalty  Trustworthy  Sense of humor  Good listener  I can borrow money (lol, just kidding)
jRSzIzYqaa	It'll happen. You just have to go out with girls. Talk to them and such. Usually actually being around a girl is a great first step to losing you're virginity.|`|AcARmgG1aa	ask one of your friends to do you a favor...<br>  <br>  im 18 and im a virgin... and i feel like a douche..|`|hH2XYpetaa	Oh wow, I spit out my drink when I read your question.

When you finally meet the right person it will all just feel right, trust and understanding from both sides. Get out and socialise, dont even think about it just enjoy your life and believe me, it will just happen. respect yourself, you are still young and carefree. I had a friend who was still a virgin in his 30's now he is married and two lovely kids, confidence in yourself plays a big part in how people react to you. personality and friendship are more important, so many times do people jump in to bed with anyone,but are they happy when the booze has worn off? respect goes a long way, . you will meet someone, you will experiience all the emotions and passion i guarantee it. good luck hope this helps|`|MYPMoVg4aa	Just relax<br>  Who said there's a time and place you have to lose your virginity is silly.<br>  People are different and i assure you there's probably people older than yourself that are in the same situation.<br>  Just get out there more and have confident go to clubs and bars<br>  and mix with new people, you might meet the girl of your dreams.<br>  When the time comes im sure it will be very special.<br>  Try not to worry good luck.|`|4QfbqQHIaa	You Can Relax And Just Go With The Flow|`|KRJNjxJzaa	just relax.. maybe start looking though.. go clubbin....<br>  M<br>  I<br>  N<br>  G<br>  L<br>  E<br>  !!!!<br>  hehe<br>  <br>  ans plz:<br>  <a href="http://uk.answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090225132025AAhteyj">http://uk.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...</a>|`|SlftCIyeaa	i would find a girl be very nice to her get into a great relaship then marry her and do ur stuff and dont worry 21 is a young age to get married i would wait till ur 30|`|rVFuRc6Vaa	your still young the right man will come along just make sure he loves you for yourself not what he can get and he respects you get to know some one first|`|b7jWXN4Vaa	go see a hooker.|`|jBZJkSjWaa	best u can do when it happens is to loose ur viginity|`|4924211ddf4a19e0b7843e0ffc42dba9aa	Relax and take a cold shower!

No one every said it would be easy. You made a commitment, so keep it.<br>  <br>  Stand up to the plate and take action. When you "tried the romantic stuff", what was your motivation? Were you going through the motions to get laid? Women can tell, you know.<br>  <br>  You are loving her conditionally, based on how much you feel she deserves to be loved. Unconditional, real love puts the needs of the other before one's own. And you are a father! Your children need both parents. You can't just think of yourself and your needs and wants. You have a family that depends on you to lead, to take action, to be there, to be a husband and father. There is no greater calling.<br>  <br>  We as sinful, selfish human beings can't love selflessly (like God does). Only when we are filled with God's love can we pour it out on others.<br>  <br>  You are a sinner who has deeply hurt your family, yourself, and the God who created you and loves you despite your rejection of Him. Apathy, indifference, lust, hatred, envy, gossip...all sins against God that we can't make right no matter what we do. There is only one cure for sin.<br>  <br>  That's Jesus, the Son of God, who died on the cross in our place. Trust that His death paid for your sins. Seek Him, learn about Him in the Bible...start living a new life in Christ, freed from the guilt and shame of sin and the power of Satan ruling over your life.<br>  <br>  It will make all the difference.
KRZ8JsbUaa	Everyone makes mistakes and does something that we regret to our friends/family. Honest and sincere apologies are often accepted and very necessary. Apologize to your friend explaining that it was unintentional and that next time you will try harder to respect their feelings. If they accept your apology that is great. Be optimistic, it may take them a while to get over what happened. If they choose not to accept it, you have done all you can. Learn from the experience and move forward.|`|YEjgJmjuaa	Darling' I must say everybody does make mistakes also everybody in the world does deserve a second chance well that is what i get told, so everyone i fall out with gets another chance just go for it :)
Bn6NXTKAaa	I think before you make any moves, you need to start talking to her again. I know you said it seems tacky to go through facebook or myspace or aim--anything. just small talk, short conversations since you're shy so talking her through those venues might help. Once you get some conversation flowing, just casually ask if she would like to hang out with you sometime. I wouldn't recommend getting her number right away though; it might scare her off if you're not sure how she feels about you.|`|jrWpHYAPaa	Aww that's cute.

Now I'm not saying just talk about random things tell her how you feel.  I would love to hear someone tell me things about me.  My friend likes me a whole lot and he gives me compliments everyday.  Tell her she's the most beautiful woman you have ever seen.  Tell her that her eyes are amazing.  This so called "mushy stuff" still works with a gentelman.  You must treat her with the upmost respect.  Tell her she is your everything and nothing else could have torn her off your mind.  She is the essence of your being.  I know it sounds mushy because it is.  Trust me it works.  (Worked on me anyway!)  We aren't going out or anything but he still tries by telling me every compliment.  Keep at it.  Your friends can make fun of you all they want but if this is truly how you feel don't listen to them.  They shouldn't even be a factor in your feelings for this girl.
DxYKxamyaa	I think that if you do actually like this person YOU should be the one to ask NOT you parents. If you really want to know , just ask him. if its a no, move on but don't ruin the friendship. make sure you get right to the point don't pace yourself.
34b40Vu3aa	He didn't care or love you as much as you did him.  That will be hard to accept.  But you did the right thing in getting rid of him.  Move on with your life and do the best you can.  Don't contact him at all and find things to occupy yourself.  One day, he will wake up and realize what he lost and by then you will be over it and happier than ever.  Let him go, he's a waste.|`|Q3qcnzHAaa	He's absolutely interested in someone else.|`|875b9562d8defd3804154e34c3bf5ea4aa	Move on, he's over it why shouldn't you be.|`|VVtr54Myaa	Move on!! Sounds like he is over you and is moving on with his life.|`|40cef57d8cbeb3d292923003ab0fb8edaa	Babe, I think you're on the money. You know deep down that this isn't by any means a dream relationship. IHe doesn't feel very romantic towards you, and dare I say that he isn't in love with you. He most likely never will be. Cut your losses now, and move on to a better, happier relationship. If you spend most of your time complaining about/ to him, and he spends most of his time not appreciating you and ignoring the your needs, then you are in a dead end relationship. Again, please, cut your losses now before you feel like you can't ever leave.|`|chENztVEaa	He sounds self centered to me.  I am sure you have probably already told him the same things you have said on here so maybe he is just not as into the relationship as you were.  All you can do at this point is tell him the truth.  Tell him that you realize now what you did wrong in the relationship and that if he is willing to give it another try than you will do your best to not repeat your mistakes.  Explain the part to him that the simple things you asked for were importatant to you and you wanted to feel good about the relationship you had together.  You need to realize though that if he is a complete butt head to you and never willing to compromise than he may not be as compatible with you as you think he is.  People are raised differently and sometimes it has an effect on how they deal with birthdays, holidays and the things you mentioned that he didn't do that hurt your feelings.  Once you have explained to him that you were hurt than he should have listened and tried to do better the next time once he realized that it was important to you.  He sounds to me like he is cool with the break-up and you are the one who is willing to bend for him.  A good relationship takes two people working together.  One can not do it and remain happy no matter how hard you try.  Good luck to you.  Once you lay it all out ot him if he isn't willing to try than I would say he is gone for good.  It may hurt now but iin the future once you find your true soul mate you might be glad you did not compromise on the things you enjoy in life.|`|f6ab3ae3fee781c3975ea305670f972faa	how can someone be your "other half" and yet you still want them to be someone else?  <br>  <br>  You spent a great deal of your relationship with him fighting about things that were important to you but not him and trying to compromise on those issues but he was not willing to budge from his point of view.  That doesn't sound like someone who met her other half.  That sounds like someone who likes the idea of the guy she's with but is trying to make him over into someone she would actually want to be with.  That sounds like 2 people who aren't compatible.<br>  <br>  Let him go.  He was NOT your other half.  Don't worry about whether or not he has someone else lined up to replace you.  That's so far from being an issue here that it's unimportant.<br>  <br>  When you finally do meet your "other half" you aren't going to have to work so hard to like who he already is.|`|JkvlAVX2aa	Yes.

I assume you must know what it is by now, so you just have to address it. I agree with Entropy, that a couple drinks tends to solve the problem if it's just shyness (and like he says, _just a couple_ - don't rape drunk girls), but 16 months in, it's probably the usual holding-out-for-a-ring thing, and there's not really much else you can do about that ethically.|`|A8k9NHigaa	if you try to push her into sex and she is not ready, you will just push her away.

When you ask her to marry you, she will probably warm up to it.|`|FWsv3Schaa	jerk<br>  you dont "get" her to have sex with you, you WAIT UNTIL SHE IS READY|`|vTra7n5baa	1)  Really ask her why she's waiting.  It could be biological.<br>  2) Give her your side and tell her how patient you've been.<br>  3) Reassure her that everything will be fine, especially since she knows you well enough.<br>  4) Hope it happens.|`|gtINkA19aa	some girls really stick to their morals..if she's one of them then you won't be having sex with her, and if you really cared then you should respect that..if you can't deal with that then leave her and go get an std from some other girl|`|hH2XYpetaa	First off there aren't any steps to having sex you wither want or you don't.

Its a yes or no question.|`|aMGfRum0aa	If she is a sensible girl she is waiting for marriage.|`|2Dmd1f8Laa	umm well the next time u guys start doing hj?fingering.. ask her "can we go further?" lol if u dont ask her ull never get it|`|oYGtkVwOaa	then respect her for respecting herself.  maybe she doesnt trust u enough.but i guess if u just want her for sex then get her drunk or something|`|mGgesPRCaa	how bout just take it a step further with the handjob or fingering lol|`|kxAMOZAuaa	Chill out guy..|`|M1Lc6tlAaa	simple answer: ASK HER.<br>  xD<br>  or discuss it with her... see if she's ready.<br>  because sex is a really big step; it can either help a relationship or break a relationship.. and I've seen the latter happen way more.<br>  If you really care, and she doesn't want to have sex, the thought of sex shouldn't bother you because you love her.<br>  And if she does, well congrats! lol|`|kfM7ppWpaa	First off: lose the clown hair. That is probably why she only lets you use your hands. lol<br>  <br>  Seriously though, DO NOT rush her into anything she isn't ready for. She will let you know when she is ready. You still have a couple more steps to accomplish...like going down on eachother.|`|cn49BbRiaa	16 months thats a long time for you to be dating a woman who dosent want sex.

BufaOu1jaa	I'm not going to lie to you, I wouldn't completely trust her again.<br>  Chances can be that she could possibly do it again, it sucks to think of it that way, but the thing I've found out after 4 years of high school, is that you constantly have to watch your back.|`|gL5jy3Sqaa	put some distance on her for a little while...even when you are friends again!|`|ChmuSKpVaa	Don't let her in completely til you fully trust her, then let her in, but just make sure it is the right time.|`|21087505291a72143d1a801532d3bb7faa	honestly if you do become friends again thats fine but dont trust her fully cause chances are that she may hurt you again. it sucks losing friends but she prefered the guy over you, how fair is that? just becareful what you do and say around her
toLCaFc9aa	That is very sad. My parents are divorced too and I am 21 too, but I talk with my mom almost every day, but we are really really different too. Sometimes it gives me the impression that if she marries again she will probably call just once a month, but I don't really care as long as she is happy. But in your case you need to sit her down and talk to her from daughter to mother. You need her and if you don't have your parents then who to trust. Talk to her and tell her how you feel, you are her daughter and the oldest (maybe) so sit her down and open up to her. I dod that once with mine (because of different things) and it worked out. Hope everything works out for you. Good luck.  <br>  <br>  Edit: I just read you other details, in that case, if she doesn't want to talk, then (I am sorry) but you have to move on with your life. You are young and sometimes parents don't make the right decisions. Maybe she sees in you that nasty divorce or your father. Sorry, but that is what I think.|`|2KC467tFaa	I would write a letter. Tell her how you feel and what kind of relationship you wish you had together. Try not to put anything hurtful, but still be honest. That should open a door for communication. Once you can talk to each other about issues, you'll be able to resolve things together. That will start to build your relationship. Start small, and good luck.|`|CdTe8MO4aa	she maybe "religious" but she sounds more like a hypocrite because she won't talk to her own daughter<br>  i|`|b6NYAO3paa	I know maybe it's not something about you but about your dad, maybe something happned, but stil she should be there for you.  You can up front ask her why she doesn't pay attention to you and see what her reaction is, but don't snap it at her, calmly do it.<br>  <br>  <br>  GOOD LUCK!<br>  Ok I saw your edit, well maybe you should stop talking to her for a cuple weeks, I know it sounds harsh but go THE LONG MILE for the silent treatment, and when...or if she calls you tell her that you just don't feel she pays attention to you and once again tell her how you feel.<br>  <br>  And don't answer calls from people you think your mom would ask to check up on you, you need your mom to call.|`|LRHjirzhaa	I would talk to her about you feel. She may not even realize that she's behaving that way toward you. Just let her know that you feel like she doesn't really care anymore and I'm pretty sure she'll tell you that it isn't true, and probably have some kind of reason for the way that things have been going.<br>  <br>  If you've already told her how you feel then there's nothing you can do. If she isn't interested in fixing things you can't force her. That's the only thing I can tell you besides to talk to her.|`|gtINkA19aa	confront her with how you feel about this.|`|mH4cQvOMaa	is your mom hot?|`|7gH7sgi6aa	You are an adult and you need to sit down with your Mom in private and tell her honestly and openly everything you said here.<br>  Let your Mom know how neglected you feel and that you could use an occasional call to the school.  Tell her you would like to form a better relationship with her and get to know her better now that you don't live at home and don't get to see her much.<br>  Tell her how much you MISS your Mother and that you NEED her.  Reach out and touch her.  Then listen to her and give her a chance to talk.  Hug her, love her.  I think she needs some love too.  Good luck!!!<br>  Peace, Love & Happiness|`|VygBNA0Waa	my mum is the same and its like they only worry about how there feeling and what they are doing they dont think to ask us about our lives and what we are up to <br>  ring her leave a message and say mum its like you dont want to talk to me you dont ring or visit me i love you and need you in my life and i feel lost with out you can you ring me back please<br>  if she doesnt change after that then dont ring her until she rings you let her worry about you|`|f12MT3Rwaa	just say mom, i havent seen u in so long, we never talk anymore" or maybe plan to all as a family go together like to a resteraunt or movie's or something like that and just start a conversation she would be interested in.<br>  <br>  OH! i just thought of this. you said your mom is on the phone alot right? listen in to her conversations with other people, then start a similar conversation with her about the same interesting topic, and she'l be interested and want to talk to you more often, then you guys will get closer together and talk all the time!<br>  <br>  It's GENIUS!|`|nlmkQeinaa	First, I'd like to say I'm so sorry your sad about your relationship with her. I think if you tell her how you feel in writing, that would be a good thing. I think though that sometimes when you go to someone and tell them how you feel or what is wrong with a relatinship, they can get defensive, so you need to be careful. I'd go into it by saying how you really thought about what she said when she said you only spend time with your siblings and you want to work on things with her. Say that you too want to be closer and would love it if she would call on Monday nights and that you'll make sure your by the phone or you'll call her. Then tell her that you'd like it if she can find one day a month where it can be just the two of you. Maybe you can meet halfway between where you are and she is for lunch and an hour or two shopping or walking around town. Just don't make it like you have problems with her..make it like you miss her and want to make things better with you both and if you can put it on her...that she opened your eyes...it will make her feel good. I think people really need to find things in common to want to talk to each other. Is there anything your mom is into that you can find your interested in? Gardening? Arts? business? history? Movies? Maybe you can take a class together, join a meetup.com group....see a movie together? Join a book club together. I think your a pretty great daughter to want what you want. Any mother would be lucky to have a daughter like you too!  HUGS!|`|pAwa23hEaa	Some people need a slap on the face to get it!! Just tell her everything you just told us and let her know this really hurts you.. :(<br>  Maybe she has a different picture painted in her head.. Like.. you go to college and you pay for it yourself.. and that you don't need them.. or.. she could think and feel many other things.. If after this, she doesn't change, just pretend to not care anymore.. but still show her that you love her and despite her actions you still care!<br>  i wish you guys can be friends soon. I miss my mom :(|`|HinSwo97aa	talk to her and tell her your view.<br>  maybe she has something else going on that she doesn't want you to know<br>  open relationships are better than hiding your feelings.<br>  i'd ask her to go out to lunch, and discuss face to face how you feel.<br>  she can see your emotions, and not run away from the discussion.|`|JhPhYdvZaa	Just tell her how you feel, she's your mother. Mothers were made to listen to their daughters. They have special bonds for that. :P Good luck|`|unHzAIXtaa	Tell your mom how you feel.|`|CVdpH2O6aa	buy her a new house.|`|3RfHq80Naa	That's rough.  A mother is a very important person in most of our lives, but that does not have to be the case for you.  I hate to get early 90's on you, but the greatest love of all is happening to you and you will find the greatest love of all inside of you.<br>  It is perfectly normal to not like other members of your family, including your mother, even though you love them.  Also, it's normal to love from a distance.<br>  You may find that you are very close to your mother-in-law one day or a friend. <br>   Just don't let it get you down.  If you have to watch ten comedy films a week, it's essential to keep your own morale high.|`|5FMAwi1xaa	So, i have been in i similar situation as the one you are currently in. I understand how hard it must be for you to not be able to communicate the way you would want to with your mother. I had a similar relationship with my mother and one day i forced her to talk to me. I sat her down and explained how the way she had been treating me and mentally screwed me up. I told her how it hurts me when she makes me feel invisible. It's going to be really hard, and i understand that you have tryed before, but try again. But this time be forceful and dont back down. Make her realize you love her and care about her and want to be part of her life.|`|AA10332982	Let me start with :" When some one voluntarily helps everyone, it shows that he is really looking for such help". This is how he looks at the world. <br>  <br>  Similary, you are looking for love. I request you to start giving love to others, may be kids younger than you and see the joy of giving love.  Ofcourse, keep in touch with your mother, one day she would realise and would be with you. So, my heart says.|`|JnpZESNHaa	This is an extremely hurtful situation for you, and must be very difficult to deal with.  It's particularly hard because the way society conceptualizes families tends to place a lot of emphasis on the mother-child bond, so it's easy to feel excluded and even rejected when other people have closer relationships with parents than you do.  <br>  <br>  Your mother is probably so busy with two children under five that she doesn't even realize what effect her behaviour is having on her older child.  She probably thinks of you as quite grown up and able to take care of yourself - which is a compliment in a lot of ways!  However, she needs to understand that even though you are technically 'grown' you still crave affection and attention from her sometimes (this is completely understandable and normal).<br>  <br>  I would suggest that you tell her how you feel, without being accusatory.  Tell her that you feel a bit hurt at being marginalized,  Explain to her, in as gentle a way as you can, that even though you are an adult, you love her very much and would like a slice of her time occasionally.  Try to tell her exactly what activities you'd like to do together: don't be general about it, but try to be as specific as possible ('I would like to come stay with you X number of days'/'I would really like us to have dinner on this day').  <br>  <br>  However, my advice to you is not to pin your hopes on establishing a completely close bond, but to accept that sometimes these things just aren't perfect and that you can't 'fix' them so that they are.  At times, you have to enjoy what you do have, and capitalize upon it, rather than constantly expecting it to turn into something you don't have and then being disappointed when the reality falls short.  This doesn't mean that you can't try for improvement, just that you need to be realistic about what kinds of improvement are possible.  In other words: be thankful for small mercies sometimes!  That said, I suspect that you will find it easier to get along when you are just a little bit older: parents often struggle to relate to their kids between the ages of about 16 and 25, when they're not quite kids and not quite adults either!|`|c041cf42cbef03916007536215ce6e9faa	There seems to be a great many issues at hand with your Mother. I had a volatile relationship w/ my Mother as well. She was a quote, Very Religious Person. Might I suggest writing her a letter and expressing your feelings through Pen and Paper. Sometimes w/ a letter a Person can read this and it will soak in. I wish you the best of luck. You have a lot to be proud of being in College and doing so well. You keep up the good work.|`|xkbsVCiVaa	Maybe she stressed with the little ones, and she is being kinda selfish right now.  I'd let her know how you feel, if she acts negatively give her some space. In my opinion I'd wish my mother wouldn't bother me so much, but I'm a bit older and like my space and time with my boyfreind. Most parents suck to some extent, and can be inconsiderate of there kids feeling. I keep my distance some, which makes them appreciate you more.|`|yiLHPpZEaa	She wants to get away from her old life and only consentrate on her new life. I would ask her what would god think of all the pain she's making? Or ask her why she's treating you like this? And if she answers well tell her that god still loves his children no matter what why cant she? PS: if she says she's not god well tell her she is a christian. I hope i helped|`|8TmK8Qklaa	You need to force your mother into a one on one confrontation where nobody is around and bluntly ask her what the deal is, explain your feelings and ask for an explanation.|`|zdu3gh8jaa	Try writing her a letter saying all the things that you feel you need to say. Tell her that you are sad that you have to write but as you know that she is busy you felt it better this way. Ask to make an appointment with her for a coffee and a sandwich one afternoon or a pizza one evening, just you and her. If she agrees use this time to find out some of the answers to your questions. I hope things improve for you very soon, good luck.<br>  (((((hugs)))))   :-)

Unless you can't see your feet, you're plenty skinny enough.|`|M1Lc6tlAaa	I honestly believe that you need to like not judge yourself with these skinny friends you have.

Your friends have a serious eating disorder and if they cannot accept for who you are, then I don't think you should be friends with them.|`|jzdDF3Ljaa	oh please, you people don't know they're anorexic.  Anorexic is a serious eating disorder, different from being underweight.  Hell, they might not even be underweight, it depends on how old + tall they are and all that crap.<br>  <br>  You-  Dont feel fat, if you eat fruits and veggies and stuff and not to many treats your fine.  Being healthy is better than being underweight.

When your high you think you have a very complex way of thinking and a lot of people get paranoid over whatevers on your mind, wether it would be getting caught or a doubt you have about yoru girlfriend, i would wait till you talk to him sober, and ask if he ment it if he said know feel free to talk to him about it, but dont badger him about it or hold it against him, jsut take it for what it is he was high and paranoid.|`|cc60f4f1d4566c6c7c8ccf86e13ab348aa	It might be that he was just high.

Love isn't what you want it to be until you're older.  I'm a teen myself and have been single my entire life.  I've known love but I turned it away.  Think what you like but that is that.|`|LTbLfl9Qaa	Then not than...<br>  <br>  Leave him be. You don't want to have a boyfriend who gets high all the time and tells you things like this.

TShsb3EXaa	You have somewhere to go, somewhere to turn to in hard times, someone to tell and to listen to your problems, somewhere you can go where people enjoy the same things or care for you, knowing that you have people there to help you and just to live.  A family and a gang can be just two people. You and your best friend are a gang.. There just there to be with and that is the importance. It keeps you from harms way but it can put you in harms way too make sure you stay in the right friendship gang ;)    Best of Luck, Q&A.|`|lFQiiR0Baa	Everyone needs to belong somewhere.

She is your possession not your mate.  She is only 40. She should have a job and use the money for what ever she wants. She wants to get out of the house and be with other people. I don't blame her. A health club is a good investment and something she can do all by herself. She is your mate not your maid or your daughter. Let her do what she wants.

9WIbZUH0aa	Breathe in.  Breathe out.  Good.  Now listen.<br>  <br>  First of all, let's establish who these people are, because it's really confusing the way you put it (it took me ten freaking minutes just to figure out what you were trying to say) .  Let's call the girl you like Jane and your other good friend Mary.  So, you like Jane, but you didn't want to tell her because of your friendship.  Then, Mary, another good friend of yours, goes and tells Jane that SHE likes you.  Then, this morning you asked one of your OTHER friends, Laura, if she knows about who likes you (??), and she said that Jane does.  Then Jane found out that you know that she likes you and wont talk to you now.  Also, because Mary likes you, Mary is going to break up with her boyfriend for you, but you don't even like her!  Uhm....is that right?  Oh well.  Close enough.<br>  <br>  First of all, put this into prospective.  You.  Are.  In.  Eighth.  Grade.  Do you plan on making life-long friends or wives out of any of these girls?  Probably not.  Even though you can have some of the best relationships of your life in your teenage years,  you're hardly 14, bucko.  Wait a little, mature more.  But, if you must finish this soap opera, you have four solutions. (make sure all of these are communicated in person.  Texting can, no matter what anybody says, seem insensitive and make things worse.  If you can't possibly get them in person, call them on the phone.)<br>  <br>  1.  Ask Jane out.  Make sure YOU tell Mary about this, and say you still want to be friends, because hearing it from somebody else might make her angrier.  You may turn Mary into your worst nightmare, but it wont be long until she finds a new flick and you can ask her if you two can patch things up.  Patience is the key.  In the mean time, you can go frolic through the daisies with Jane, to keep up your spirits.<br>  <br>  2. Tell both of them that you would rather be friends.  This may make you a little sad about Jane, but maybe you could ask her out a little later, once everything has cooled off, in a very polite and clear way. <br>  <br>  3. Drop everything.  Tell them, especially Mary, that they need to cut the drama or walk out of your life.  This is ONLY a good option if your friends are the gossipy, drama queen types.<br>  <br>  4. Tell them both that you just want to stay friends because you don't want to hurt anybody's feelings.  Maybe you could work out a friends with benefits system.<br>  <br>  Good luck!

Tledw3eAaa	You really should tell your parents, or (if you go to the same school) tell the counselor there so that they can handle it. The cutting itself may not be physically dangerous to him, but the cause of that cutting means he is already in need of help. I'm sorry to say that it is unlikely you can help him yourself.    Him getting the help he needs is far more important than worrying about what he will think of you for "telling on him." Cutting is often a cry for help. People who cut sometimes don't even realize this themselves. They will adamantly deny that they want people to find out, but deep down they are looking for the attention. I don't say this in a bad way though. They look for the attention because they need someone to see the pain they are in. If he told you about his problem, the truth is he might secretly or subconsciously hope you go tell someone.     So you do really need to let an adult know what he is doing. All you yourself can do for him is to be there if he wants to talk about it. You can be supportive of him, and encourage him to find other ways to deal with the depression... just realize you can't force him to change. Your role is just to support him as a person, not change his bad behaviors. Let an adult find a professional to help him when it comes to the cutting.    I'm not going to lie. If you tell someone, he may seem angry with you or seem to become more depressed. He may say that he blames you if he is taken somewhere to get help. If this happens though, take it as you would the words of someone who doesn't know what they are saying. Him pretending he doesn't need anyone else, and becoming angry with those who try to help, is his way of defending himself against the hurt. It is not personal.     So if he gets upset, tell him you're sorry if it made him angry, but you care about him and you'll do whatever you need to do to make sure he's ok. He'll just have to deal with it, and hopefully down the road things will get better, and you will find he is thankful you cared enough to do something.|`|2c89cd9f9d087548a3d65a53e0d5756baa	Okay, tough situation for you. If you are scared to tell your Mum or your step Dad is their another adult you trust? Aunt, uncle, teacher, parent of a friend?  Your family member would benefit from talking to a school/college counselor to explore why he self harms and how he can better cope. His doctor, if he would go see them, might be prescribed anti-depressants as well as regular counseling sessions.  Self harming is usually a way used to 'feel' and vent what the person can not express in words until they get help.|`|y7lUgd3aaa	Tell him that you will have to tell his parents if he doesn't stop.  Try to help him out as much as possible yourself but if he doesn't stop you gotta go for help.  He will be mad at you but that's much better than him being dead at such a young age.  One day things will go way too far and he will die.  You gotta speak up|`|30df9097f03d1c8888f9bbc610068367aa	You need to talk to a school counselor, it would be helpful if it was one in this family member's school.  Explain your concerns, and also the concerns about the father.  They will know how to handle it better.
AA11970801	tell the school counselor privately, your friend is in alot of help right now and either you have to act or he does. You dont want his dad to beat him up until he dies. Thats really bad abuse and you cant just sit there and be like it'll be fine when its not. You have to do something that will help him, you have to tell someone. I would have called the police if my dad beat me up. And living alone in that house with a crazy-abusive father, i would be scared for my friend every night. Help him call the police for him, before its too late.    And your friend could become abusive like his dad when hes older, and you dont want him beating up his son! just cause his dad did that to him. call the police, or tell ur parents. Ask them if he can sleepover and then that night call the police and tell them the situations. Sometimes if those secrets are really important you have to spread that secret.                                            Best of luck and i hope this helps :~)  Hope you do the right thing|`|Vp1Wzu07aa	You are the one that this boy needs to rely on now. You need to convince him that he needs to get out of his house. Tell your parents and ask that they help you come up with a solution. Someone needs to help this boy.|`|y7lUgd3aaa	You gotta speak up and tell your mom or dad..they will know what to do.  They will tell the authorities which should have been done a long time ago.  If you don't speak up, his dad might kill him and it would be your fault.  He may think that living with his dad is better but he will be much happier in a loving family.  Pretty soon he will turn 18 anyway and be free to do what he wants.  Be a good friend and get him help before it's too late.|`|MIhYfBf5aa	make an anonymus phone call, you cant ignore what happened. it could get worse in the future. trust me your friend wants you to help otherwise you wouldnt have been at his house.|`|B4kf9jDGaa	I know you promised not to tell anyone, but someone needs to be told. A school authority, or the police. That man has no right to beat up his son, no matter why. Your friend needs to be moved to another house, where he is safe. Being beat, he could become depressed and horrible things could come from that(believe me, I know)and so someone needs to be told. He might be mad at you for telling, and breaking your promise, but someone other then you, someone who can help more then you can(not that you can't but you can't do anything to stop his dad, authorities can)and he needs love and help, Tell someone, that will be the best thing you can do for him.|`|k3uh0oTAaa	You should someone, but only someone who you know will really do something to help him quickly before his Dad finds out about you telling, and will probably beat him up again.    And just be there for him as much as you can.  Good luck.|`|xiBaB7vEaa	If you go to school together, have him go with you to a counselor or teacher. It is their responsibility to go to the proper authorities and put a stop to this abuse. Don't do nothing. You could be saving your friend's life!  If he won't go with you - then go yourself. I know you promised but this promise is not helping him. Talk to your parents also. Can they intervene somehow?|`|xcfGF1fiaa	You should talk to your parents about it. They will know what to do. I don't think that he will be mad at you. He doesn't deserve to live in a situation like that and he does need help. So by telling your parents you are doing the right thing.
VlIL3G0saa	the easiest way is to ask your biological mother. if are still in touch with her go ahead and ask. if i were you i'd get ready to hear something i might not like. not to burst your bubble or anything, but have you considered the possibility of your biological mother not knowing the identity of your father?|`|HjPt0V8Eaa	Ahmmm, why don't you try searching for your dad's friend, they may also be a friend of your mom somehow.. Just don't ask. Just feel and know the circle of friends of your mom, maybe you'll got some hint there.
lc2WYfeTaa	I say just wear a pair of jeans and a really cute top with heels or something and for him jeans and a polo shirt unless it's a dressy type of club I don't live out there so i don't know..but whatever you do don't wear extremely tight pants!!! And just go and be yourself but don't show off because then people will point and make fun of you. Hope this helps

1tdOW2Pfaa	Ha!    This is funny.    You give them a finger, they want the whole damn hand.|`|G0pDFMSPaa	No.  Because a big part of sex is mental.  A woman cleaning and cooking is showing her love and devotion, now that is sexy.    If as a girl you'll do anything sexy, start with the dishes and carpets, you can hoover me later.|`|AA10377289	no. its part of the whole deal.|`|Ki1gWTzzaa	yep! I will.s that us?|`|NrwJyffxaa	Yes it does it is what makes the difference between a Hooker and a wife.  If all you have to offer is unrestrained sexual fulfillment in exchange for what ever his is giving you aren't you just a hooker.    Sex isn't the answer to a mans needs and shouldn't be the only thing a woman has to offer.  Most men  prefer a woman with standards.  That goes for sex, cleaning, cooking, finances, driving, and whatever aspect of life you can think of.     Hope that doesn't offend you but I think most women would agree.|`|AA12187979	Why have half a slice of bread.  A woman is suppose to treat you good in bed just like you are suppose to treat her.  A woman is suppose to take care of her fhome and family just like a man is suppose to care of his home and family.    So why just half, that's just getting a prostitute or a spoiled brat that doesn't want to work.  Utimatly that type of lazy will work it's way into the bedroom anyway.|`|SHARt1k3aa	If you have to ask, then it must bother you, but you feel bad wanting more when she pleases you perfectly in the bedroom.  Part of being a couple is sharing and taking care of each other.  Cleaning, is pretty important in my relationship.  Who wants to live with a slob, that can't cook or clean, but is good in bed... that really only makes them good for one thing.  Not to say it's solely the woman's job to do those things, but it's nice when both spouses do their share of them.|`|Y8byax2paa	it wouldn't matter cause i would work, clean , wash, cook  and fold............    male's are very easy to please and to very easy to distract.    Viva trophy husbands|`|WOJAFQSOaa	That shouldn't have any factor in doing the chores. Relationships should be 50/50 he should be a God just as you are and help around the house too.|`|VSVQHKwKaa	That won't fly.    You're assuming that sex is not mutually satisfying.    Sex is something you two do together. It's not something you do for him. It's fun for the both of you. If it's not, then you're not doing it correctly.    But it's not something that you trade him, in order to get out of housework. If you could do that, you'd have to hate sex as much as he hates doing dishes and laundry (which I'm sure is not so).    Now...a good sex life brings a happy husband and a happy home.    But if you want special help with your household chores, you're going to have to come up with something equally unpleasant that you're going to do for him.    And by the way....a woman how keeps a clean house and cooks tasty food.....    ...is sexy. And she remains sexy long after the tight but and the perky boobs are gone.    Something to think about in the future.    Good Luck!|`|C4bxnKDXaa	Id rather have a cleaner...cooker. : ) I cook and clean too though.|`|NWH3MnE9aa	GREAT QUESTION SAMI! Truth: If a woman treats a man like a "sexual god" and f**ks him like a wh*re; we don't care if she never picks up a dish or washes a damned piece of clothing. We can hire a maid. Keep that sweet groove up, baby!|`|tsBL19qzaa	Who says that it's a women's job to cook and clean? Limited thinking produces limited people.|`|OG4410bdaa	I had a friend who thought that way  her husband was one of the most sad men I ever knew    she thought just because she was good in bed and always ready to go that she didn't need to help the house    well eventually he was so exhausted from cleaning and cooking, and the constant sex became boring to him because he didn't feel loved by her, just wanted  so he started turning her down for sex, and even asked her to go to marital counseling with him    she went but she refused to believe that she was doing anything wrong...she didn't realize that sex isn't enough to float a relationship    lust gets old fast  if you love a person then you'll do your fair share to help around the house and in the marriage    she learned that one the hard way when he finally divorced her, and two years later married an obese woman who not only had sex with him daily, but also cooked him dinner daily too  (and he still helps with the vaccuming and laundry! now that's 50/50!)|`|S6FLJ64Qaa	so you mean to tell us that you are spending so much time having sex, that you don't need food?  I guess this also means that you providing all of this sexual worship on the same old sheets?  Or is he so good sexually, that you are just too tired?    Most chores around a house are not labeled as men or women's work.  They are part of responsibility of living in the house.  If the trash is spilling from the can all over the floor, then anyone who notice's it is obligated to taking it out.  You do this with either estrogen or testosterone.

MkErhX7Haa	Oh wow.  She is clueless.  The bride isn't going to know, care, or appreciate you all spending $65 on shoes.  Ditto PP.  Politely decline and say you are wearing shoes you already have or something.|`|0056ba0f2ca4852a4f7b389766f314d4aa	Tell the MOHs that you'd be happy to wear the shoes if they would like to purchase them for you. While you think it's a nice "surprise" also, as a stay at home mom, it's simply not in your budget and as the bride didn't request it, it's not something that you can add to your budget. Good luck.|`|auUeI2Vnaa	Well, she can suggest anything she wants, but as the bride already stated, not everyone can afford the same amount and she was rude in not considering that before picking out matching shoes.  I'd have sent her an email saying that it's a great idea so long as she pays half of your shoe bill.|`|PmC0e6e1aa	I agree with you. It's a nice idea to surprise the bride, but I'm sure she wouldn't appreciate it as much as she would having you as a bridesmaid. It's all that she asked for. If they want to match shoes then let them, but you should be able to do what you feel is right and what your brother and his fiance have agreed. I'm not particularly fond of having everyone wear the same shoes either.    As for what to do about it, politely decline and let them know you are going to wear shoes you already have. If you don't feel comfortable giving an explanation, then that's fine there is no need for one. The bride won't care anyways... she'll be happy about it for 2 seconds but it's her wedding day. She doesn't care about what is on anybody's feet! It was not right of the maids of honor, it's was unnecessary and a bit foolish.  $160 for a one time dress is a big splurge already!|`|47af2fda89839c0ec02e273cff59d82daa	i think that no matter what, you do what the bride says.  the maid of honor isnt the one getting married, the bride is, so you do what makes the BRIDE happy.  and if the bride is cool with you buying any ol pair of black shoes that look good with your dress, then to hell with what the moh says.      like, im totally not a  bridezilla here, but you already got your orders from the bride herself.  so why did the moh even think she needed to delegate the matching shoes when the bride already said it wasnt needed because of price issues?|`|f6ab3ae3fee781c3975ea305670f972faa	they were trying to do something to surprise the bride.  what they asked was not out of line.    FWIW:  If money were an issue for me then I would have responded as you did.  I would have said something along the line of  "I appreciate what you are trying to do for her, however she's aware of my financial situation and that's why she said what she did about the shoes.  I'm sorry I'm not to go along with this as funds are tight for my family at the moment."  and then I would have left it at that.    What is bad form is if they refuse to take your "sorry no" response and try to pressure you into going along with them.  Continue to tell them "sorry no" without any animosity or resentment.|`|tvUAO4ioaa	The bride is taking into account your situation versus theirs. They obviously don't know you or don't care, so they probably didn't think of that. Just decline and if they make a big fuss, speak with the bride.
da43dabf7871960d74ed399773611dfaaa	That depends on how severe the situation is.    Ultimately, if it doesn't involve them, then it isn't really their place to be unhappy about your choices anyway.    Compromising would be your best option - do whatever it is you want to do - to an extent that will not upset the person too much.    Good luck!|`|TJiGs8S4aa	Listen, mature people can come to some kind of compromise - they consider what is truly important to each person, and make adjustments out of respect for someone else's feelings.  But ultimately, if the other one doesn't like it, they can go. Last time I checked, the other person has free will, and can choose to stay or go.
8ac2e5cbdd946ee60c803052559873c5aa	You're not supposed to be able to get over an affair.  It's perfectly legitimate grounds for divorce.  Even God said so.|`|gfHutvEFaa	Cheating is a deal breaker for me. Once the trust is gone, the relationship is dead.|`|NWH3MnE9aa	Loving you has NOTHING to do with having an affair. She's a sexual being and wanted to have sex with another man. Whether or not she's married, who she has sex with is her business and no one elses. The same holds true for you. Hope that she enjoyed it, be glad she was woman enough to act on it; be thankful you have someone you love ...oh, and by the way, you know that hot chick you've had your eye on? Fine a private place and let her wrap her legs around you. It'll make you feel all better.|`|8F33NnyYaa	you feel disrespected and you are allowed!! this is the most hurtful thing that can happen in any marriage, but i think its going to take a long time for you to forgive, let alone forget, you both need Professional help to get through this, you are allowed to be angry you know, this isn't a weakness, and last thing your wife has a better husband than most because most men would have walked. good luck|`|tsBL19qzaa	Leave. The marriage is already over.|`|MYbRICxqaa	You need to talk to your wife and maybe see a marriage counselor. Why want you leave her?

Affairs are big deal emotionally, don't expect yourself to handle it with ease like it's not a big deal. I recommend http://www.marriagebuilders.com it has a lot of good advise on how to get past an affair.|`|BC1XNijIaa	You are dealing with a lot of emotions that I experienced when I found out about my partner's affairs. We are still together and what he did haunts me daily. Sometimes people have affairs and it's nothing to do with the person they cheat on. It can be insecurity and selfishness.     The main issue that will make or break your marriage is how your wife acts now.  Is she genuinely sorry? Can you see changes? Has she addressed the reason she did it?  Counseling is the only solution so that you'll both understand where you're headed.|`|5NKa5Y8laa	Women usually have an affair for an emotional reason, not just sex. She must feel that there is something missing in your relationship, some emotional need that is not being fulfilled, and so she found it with somebody else.  I'm not excusing her behaviour, an affair is the worst sin to committ in a relationship.  She really needs counselling to work out what the problem is, or chances are, she may cheat again.    You need to make up your mind.  Either stay and listen and work it out, as your refusal to face it and listen to her emotions may be whats lacking in your marriage.  If you stonewall her and are unemotional, this may be why she felt the affair was necessary in the first place.  Or, if you cannot face it, then tell her that and leave her.  But you cannot sit on the fence and say "I accept you had an affair, but I dont want to talk about it".  Thats just brushing the dirt under the rug and pretending it isnt there, but it will remain there until someone cleans up the mess.    I understand your hurt, I've been cheated on.  You obviously love her, thats why you are staying.  You both need to attend counselling together to get over it.  An affair is a big deal.  Treat the problem with respect it needs - your marriage is on the line.|`|dcb024b5e2b5c65f694bdddd3199db68aa	My advise is stop being such a nice guy.  By accepting so well you are telling her it is okay to do it again.  Understand that her affair broke any trust you have with her and you both need to start new.  So if you have been together 5 years it will take 5 years to get back to where you were.  I think its time you started to do things for yourself.  First is stop sharing your paycheck.  Only contribute what is fair to cover half of what you actually use.  Cable bill you pay half.  Her car bill is completely her's.  Food you pay half.  With the rest of the money start saving it up so that if she ever steps out of line again you can afford a good lawyer.    I promise you that if you take this crap like a "good husband" she will be  banging some other guy within the year.    When people do stupid stuff they need to make up for it.  So what the heck has she done to make up for it?|`|2keIEMFUaa	Sorry! But I think if you want to forgive her and make your marriage work more power to you buddy.  But if you have forgiven her than it's like it's never happen and you don't bring it up to her face ever again it's the pass and it behind the two and now you must move onwards and forwards together as one, but that doesn't mean for her to keep cheating either.  You both need to sit down and put a final end to what happened, a closure on it write it down on a piece of paper put it in an envelope seal it and then rip it into tiny little pieces and at the same time saying it done your are forgiven and we a start a fresh new beginning together as a husband and wife.  I hope that will help you both put a end to the pass what happened.  Best to you both and I pray everything works out for the two of you as well.|`|AA12187979	An afffair gives you the moral right to end the relationship.  But once you know you have to make a decison to end the marriage or put it behind you.  She can do nothing more to make what amends she can.  Her redemption is up to you and quit honestly you need to consider the possibility that she does not deserve it.     If she was just being a whore dump her -- I'm 48 and Widowed, I had a happy marriage -- but I don't date, todays average women has put thinking between her legs and will just pick a good man's pocket.|`|MvxkNQg7aa	I feel your pain, all too well.  My hubby cheated with an ex ( a teenage fling)  he compares our relationship to.  I am pissed, depressed, scared.  I don't know why they don't talk to us if there is a problem.  No one understands, unless you've lived it, what an affair does to your emotions.  I told him, it's hurt less had he shot me in the face.  My only advise, as i am looking for some myself, is time, time, time.  I do believe if love can overcome, i just hope it happens soon.  Sorry i am not much help, however if you find any peace, please tell me how.  Best of luck to you.|`|q595MhH8aa	God bless you! My husband had an affair on me...drunken...but still an affair.

Just know that things can get better.  My husband and I are happier now than ever.  I really do wish you all the luck in the world.  I know its hard, but keep your head up, and try to fight the thoughts!|`|1epjqrflaa	I hate when people bring God into things, whatever Ruth. Keep your religious beliefs to yourself, this is a different subject. You need to leave your wife, she pulled the ultimate  no no out in any relationship. Now you dont have trust, and that means, you have no relationship. Move on and find a women you can trust who respects and loves you just as much. This one does not deserve you, and the fact that you are staying,  she will never respect you again.|`|2PTzgYuvaa	I understand how you feel.  But if you want to stay married you have to forget it and  move forward with her.  Good Luck!|`|Ki1gWTzzaa	It is an extremely hard fact to deal with, but if you do want your marriage to survive you need to deal with it, and as hard as it will be you do need to know and accept and find out "WHY" the affair took place!    And you both will need to work together tomake each other satisfied in your marriage!|`|XD5WfExHaa	And the best part is that if you get divorced she'll still get the kids and everything!!!

Don't listen to her excuses why this happened SHE SHOULD HAVE BEEN FAITH FULL TO YOU the man that she married and pledged herself to be together for better or worse, FORSAKING ALL OTHERS there is no excuses she is a whore get rid of her ,there are better women out there who will love and appreciate you KICK HER TO THE GUTTER WHERE SHE belongs Don't worry about being 50 thats not too old to meet someone, I am so sorry you can't celebrate your 25th but personally thats when i would organize a party and in public give her the divorce papers IN FRONT OF EVERYONE !!!! WHAT EVER YOU DECIDE TO DO GOOD LUCK WITH IT, I'VE BEEN THERE AND KNOW HOW HARD THIS IS AND HOW HURT YOU FEEL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|eyOb1yLuaa	Rationalizing the pain by saying things like " I was not enough for her" interferes with the healing process and your ability to forgive. Making excuses for the other person sends the message that their behaviour is acceptable. Trying to bury the painful memories can short-circuit the healing process. If you don't face the past head-on, you'll only bring unfinished business into your relationship.  Forgiveness opens the way to reconciliation and halts the cycle of blame and pain. It is a process that requires patience, time and understanding. By holding on to resentment we remain emotional prisoners.Forgiveness frees you from being controlled by what someone else has done to you. Good Luck my friend.|`|d20mM90uaa	honestly, I DONT THINK YOUR MARRAIGE WILL LAST without counseling and her sincerely going with you to counseling  you know the old saying ONCE a cheat Always a cheat  good luck with that
4q3tCyVeaa	I'm going to assume that you mean your friend wants to take illicit drugs...    If so, you have an obligation to your friend to tell them that you don't want them to do this. Maybe because it scares you that they might get hurt, or something. If they scoff, you have an obligation as a friend to tell an adult, like a parent (yours or theirs) or a teacher. If something does happen and you knew about it and said nothing to no one, then I would be immensely surprised if you did not feel guilty...however, if you did not know it becomes an entirely different story...
kaq32uJ2aa	Honestly- It's not worth the headache...You just can't let things like this get to you as aggravating as they are.

m8A8rj2Qaa	oh no that's horrible. i would suggest using olive oil or sometype of cooking oil and drench your finger in it...then take something thin..like a metal nail file or anything you can push between your ring and the finger..while doing this try and push some oil down with it. continue that around the rest of your finger and hopefully this will get it to come of with some elbow grease.|`|EENUWAP7aa	Stop drinking water and go on a crash diet for 48 hours and use soap and the ring will come off.|`|6fLxNyVpaa	try taking water pills... some times your body will always retain water. also try olive oil...|`|AA12202402	sounds way strange ok...But go outside and hold your hand way high above your heart when it is like freezing outside.

Perhaps you hands are simply swollen right now.  Decrease your salt intake.  Use water, and lubricant, body oils, etc on your hand/finger.  It should twist off with some effort.|`|T2isnQNKaa	pull it out|`|CfXLUEn8aa	I would say you're best guess is usually a lot of lotion, or cooking butter.

Make sure you laugh out of nowhere a little, but don't make it sound like your laughing AT her.    You: Do you have a myspace?  Her: Yeah.  You: Oh cool maybe you can text it to me.    Now you have her number, and permission to text her.    Now your texting her.    Her: blah blah blah, *her myspace link*  You: Oh cool thanks. Can I call you? It cost money for me to text.  Her: okay.    Now your talking on the phone =]]    You: Hey, it's better to hear your voice.  Her: *Laughing*    Now she likes you. Hooray!   It'll all be good from there.

3JfADTIDaa	Hi. You having a good time? ...blah blah blah... I like your smile.|`|oOqSpBmbaa	My word of the day is "legs". Wanna come back to mine and spread the word?|`|6mVpfmR6aa	I do not think it is a good idea to work up an opening before the time.  It is better to observe the woman you approach.  You should say something to her that shows you observed something about her that maybe you like, perhaps something she wants people to notice, e. g. her hair, her eyes, her legs, her waist, her perfume, her smile, her dress or cloths or her tan, her lips, her laugh, her taste in Friends, her dancing, her taste in alcohol, etc.  After that you might immediately  try to get her to laugh at something funny.        Of course at this point "Mystery" of "The Pick Up Artist" would say that you should "throw negs" which means to say something to her that demonstrates why you two would not make a good couple.  According to the "Mystery Method" this will force her to think she has now got to win you over.  I do not think you need to do that, because at this point it is early in your relationship and it is probably false that she will have to win you over.        Good luck.|`|8YDQnUZPaa	your cuteness got me to come here and talk to you lmfao i dunno|`|AA10214276	"What's up".|`|kpW7Jyb2aa	The one that worked best for me in my club days was:    Walk up smiling, "Hi. I'm ____." Give her a chance to give her name. "Pleasure to meet you _____. Can I get you a drink or something?"    If you smile and act like a gentleman, I guarantee you at least 2 numbers in a night. Now don't get discouraged if you get turned down, it's going to happen but keep going and put some space between each girl you try to pick up at least 30 feet. You really don't want a girl to overhear you trying to pick up another girl before you try to talk to her, that will just get you slapped.|`|SyUeecsBaa	"hi , my name is ( inset name here ) and i happened to notice you were the most beautiful woman in this room" lmao that's the best i can come up w| or the best way to do it is "hi , my name is ( insert name ) . what's yours ?"|`|bSUipR3uaa	Hi.|`|AsFiWxhUaa	hi i am (your name) and you are?|`|f9f4407b08469472a7b821eb01936d16aa	Don't be a d*ck.

Just keep talking with her then. ask her a few questions. let her talk too. don't be intrusive.|`|KDyG2vCoaa	call her sweet cheeks or tots and she'll be sukin your dong in seconds trust me brah works fine|`|e28P8gWraa	The first thing you say doesnt really matter as long as it gets there attention. Its how you act that matters. But saying something funny thats a good conversation starter works really well if you can break the ice.    How about asking them if they got swag? And then playfully argue with them about there answer.    Example: Hey I need to ask you something super important    Girl: uhh ok what?    Do you got swag?    Girl: Do I got what?    Ya know swag, gangsta gangsta top of the list kinda shiz.    Girl: uhh no thats stupid    Well Im not one to judge.

He's probably just as insecure about moving that little bit closer to make it an official kiss.

QTiTDz4yaa	If he is wanting AWAY from you. The flame hasn't just burned out..there is a major issue between you.  So you didn't notice anything going wrong until he started avoiding you all together?    Good luck patching this up.  I'll never understand why women wait until the guy is fed up and walks out before even NOTICING anything is missing!  Sorry for the rant..    IF you can get him to talk about improving the relationship, I recommend a book that might help.  You guys read it together and discuss each chapter each night.

I would try to focus on something that you like to do and talk about together.  You must know what he enjoys after five years.  Try to get involved in it.  Does he like golf?  Go golfing with him.  Does he like video games, play some with him.  Find one that you both like.  That is what I suggest.  Maybe he'd like to be involved in what you do too.  Ask him.|`|O2xwMwHYaa	men want sex. they need sex. women need relationship. we need emotional connection. its each of your jobs to fulfill the other ones needs. thats why when you get married people always tell you to have plenty of sex. its a stress reliever too. make some love and see how that works. if it doesnt then you need to talk to him about fulfilling your needs too...but sometimes sex will do the trick...|`|k8er7fo2aa	Make time alone, and get out of the house, Do something different!

So, having friends that you go out with helps.

Maybe she just keeps saying that so that she can embarass you into paying for hers. Have lunch or drinks with all the bm's and lead into conversation with something such as:  "I spoke to the dress shop and you guys need to be measured and pay for your dress by XXXX date."    "I saw these shoes in a magazine. I think you guys could get them at DSW for a really good price."   Surely then she'll pick up on it.

Brides traditionally don't contribute. But you've been hinting that you think I'm going to pay for it all. I don't mind if you didn't understand at the time you accepted that this was part of being a bridesmaid, but if you really can't afford to pay for this all out of your own pocket you need to tell me outright, not constantly hint at it."    And then go from there.    We've all been socialized to think that speaking up about something directly and clearly is not what nice girls do. But it's actually the opposite: hinting and expecting people to just know is not nice, because we only do it to avoid being hurt ourselves (if you don't tell her, she won't get mad at you).

UtrgRjTeaa	It totally depends on the girl. I know some girls who go for tall, skinny guys. I know a few girls who like their guys a little chunky (one says it makes them more cuddly).     One other thing. You mention that some of these guys are loud and obnoxious. Depending upon the age of the girl and guy, it may be that she's still figuring out what sort of guy she's attracted too. Lots of girls "get over" the phase of liking obnoxious morons about the age of 19 or so. So, if you guys are still in high school, give it a couple of years and wait for the girls to mellow out.|`|8vfCRg7Caa	women dont focus on things men focus on. Hot to them can mean much more than looks. Women think of men like their "worth" overall. And how you important you are to "women" in general. Thats why alot of women go after the same guy. Cause what they guy has relates to what a lot of women like. And it doesnt have to be look. Could mean, hes funny, dresses nice and such and such. What you dont see, is "how long those guys have known that girl", "how that guy treats her behind doors", and "how that guy handles his business, bills, car notes and things that shows hes responsible". Women are much more complicated than 'this guys hot, i want to date him". Now i dont know about fat, i see a lot of women 10's with some buff guys, and people that look more fit than me.

You've got to be hot to get a hot girl.|`|JuXb4u4gaa	cause with fat guys and ugly guys want to stay with the chicks so they make the girls feel really happy  and ****|`|zr2W7mEWaa	I don't get why they like the ugly ones :( its just so confusing in my situation they seem to like the older ones >:O this sucks!|`|1Gb4Acbjaa	Because women don't have as much confidence as men and feel like there more in with a chance with the ugly ones. And most women seriously don't care about looks.|`|rgX3fhjlaa	So they can fix them|`|fpPhjNP2aa	we dont were just scared that you hot guys wont like us so we go for the okay people to jus get a bf... it kinda has a cycle|`|HjxwlFGLaa	not true! it depends on your personality, not your looks dude! i would hate to date all the fat guys, but if all the hot guys are mean and have a horrible personality then i would go with the ugly guys. just remember, it not about the looks, its your personality.|`|3JfADTIDaa	I think you've convinced yourself that women prefer fat or ugly guys simply because they don't want YOU!|`|BxCerdxlaa	i like hot thin guys with a sixpack so hard it makes ur finger bend back|`|QGT2IQdhaa	The reason is b/c they think those guys wont hurt them.  i date guys most of my friends wouldnt b/c i know my friends wont steal them!|`|DLWmtpvSaa	me i like thick guys not fat but i have to have meat when i hug him i don't want to feel bane and i want to feel protected. beside ugly guys will treat a girl right and good looking ones know they are good looking and try to do allot of things behind a girls back so maybe that's why girls prefer fat and ugly guys....not just cuz their ugly but cuz of the way they are.|`|Bk1t83pFaa	Several possibilities:    1. More attractive men typically know they are more attractive, thus feel they can have whatever girl they wish, and don't necessarily appreciate the one they've got.  (Have their cake and eat it too, in other words).  Many beautiful women who have been hurt by men like this learn early to stay far away from them, as they seemingly can't be trusted or taken seriously long-term.      2. Men that are less attractive may feel a greater need to fulfill a woman's wants in other areas of life than the physical, or may be more affectionate and attentive in general, because they feel they have more ground to cover than an attractive man when it comes to relationships.    3. Maybe the down to earth, attractive women just do what I do...which is ignore the superficial...and pay attention to the chemical attraction that wordlessly exists between you.  The guy I'm seeing is just an average joe, and I literally can't get enough of him.  He doesn't do anything special...I just have a strong connection with him.  Idk why or how, but I'm open to see where it takes us.      So.  Consider those.  I think all of them are pretty accurate.  Don't worry so much about the way you look.  Seriously...the right woman won't care...she'll be too busy trying to keep herself off of you.|`|e15607a8c66590d715420cbfe5d2db7faa	security. they'll never worry about their man cheating. they will always be the queen, their baby.    There's an oldie song that suggests:    "If you wanna be happy for the rest of your life  Never make a pretty woman your wife  so for my personal point of view  Get an ugly girl to marry you."|`|1Z0Lmrk1aa	Trust me, it's not so much that women prefer that type of man, they just love a man who is confident and has good self esteem. Those two atrributes can and come in all shapes and sizes.|`|FUQ0sJNaaa	hey who u think gon win tha supabowl?       i got my money on the bears|`|01pY6dW9aa	Dunno, everyone is different..  I like this one guy i guess he's a lil chubby, but has a great personality.|`|rZhUcLFmaa	They prefer guys who are fun to be around.     And being skinny isn't necessarily an attractive trait for a guy. Being outright fat isn't either. A medium build is better.|`|RBGc1Hytaa	Maybe the guys you see... you dont think as attractive, but other women might. We're not all superficial- some really DON'T care about how guys look. All women like different men just like men like different things about women.|`|CDBRXtnLaa	bleck i hate fat ugly guys i mean i wouldnt say that to them i would say well i dont want to go out with you because i dont think its gonna work out but if its a cute skinny guy then hell ya i would go out with him|`|KW77oNWraa	some girls (particularly when they get older) start getting fed up with guys that "break their hearts" so they just go for personality.|`|hzZPlYYyaa	Confidence is key. Also some girls think that they can't get a good looking guy [or they think the guy is gay]. Next time you see a pretty girl you like ask her out and see what happens. Just smile and be confident. Also, be happy. If your depressed she'll most likely say no.|`|FROfw46Yaa	It's probably because they have better personalities. Men who are really "attractive" by today's standards tend to be rather arrogant, and that's a huge turn-off to many women.     Now if only men could see that fat/ugly women had good qualities, as well...|`|s4FEJiNHaa	they don't actually!  Whenever u see that, it means one of two things: he's got money (90% approx.) or it's a function of pheremones (10% approx).|`|3ZhwIAn1aa	everyone have a different prospective as to who they want to date so you can't assume that everyone is dating a fat or unattractive guy maybe the people you want are taken find someone with your interest and single

x51SQHxDaa	they r just jealous ur probably way prettier and smarter then they will ever be|`|1yUrfAvgaa	well if they put you down they aren't your friends, and they probably aren't confident in themselves so they put you down|`|AzGcXCIbaa	wow who would say that sounds like they are arrogant there hating dont care what they say|`|uOVepBl8aa	Wow.     Your friends seem a little harsh, but it depends on whether you guys just joke around like that- like, thats how my friends and I are sometimes, but we all know  that its a big joke and we're so comfortable with each other that it doesnt matter.    If you dont normally joke around like that, then maybe your friends actually dont mean you any harm, but dont take you seriously/respect enough so they dont really care what you think (as in, they consider you a pushover with an irrelevant opinion.)    But if you guys joke around like that then maybe they dont see it as a big deal to says things like that, and dont really mean anything by it.    However, as shallow as this may seem, if more guys find them more attractive than you are, then they probably feel that they're prettier/that you're ugly. If they arent very nice to you otherwise, or if they arent super close to you and tell you their secrets and that they care about you and they're happy your friends and alll that (showing that they're close to you) then they probably think you suck (sorry but I can't put it any other way :( ) and dont take you seriously (ditch them if its the case.)    Also, lots of times people pick on others to make themselves feel better, I'm sure you always hear this right? like, in psycology and stuff. So they might just be insecure and in telling you that they're prettier they're just trying to convince themselves, dont sweat it.    (sorry this was so long!! :( )
da43dabf7871960d74ed399773611dfaaa	Ahah i'm no relationship expert but i'll try my best.    To begin with: realise that every argument or disagreement is not a reason to 'call it off' for a while, because chances are you would both be over your argument in a few hours, letalone days or weeks.    Reassure her that they are from your far far past, and that she's the one you really truly completely want - Valentines Day is coming up so that is a brilliant chance for you.    Remind her that you only went to them because you couldn't have her;- not making it her fault, just saying that these other girls are nowhere near "on par" with her.    If you choose to, move suburbs even! A new area, a new stable beginning, and a distinctive memory that the past is literally the past and won't catch up with you.    Good luck.|`|AA11663530	Honestly, these girls feel hurt and used because you would hook up with them for intimacy, not relationships. Can you blame them for feeling that way? It's really, really sad for those girls, as well as your current girlfriend, because they're the ones that are getting their feelings hurt. There's nothing you can do to make your past better, except learning from your past by NOT repeating it again! Also, take full responsibility for your actions, so hopefully, you will learn your lesson.|`|EDXh0tk9aa	The other girls feel hurt and used because you were only hooking up with them for sex, not for a real relationship as you prove over and over by going back to your ex (whose now your current gf).  How sad for those girls. And your girlfriend. Does your gf know you hooked up with a bunch of different girls?

Bless her heart!  It would be tough on an adult, not to mention a child.  Very tragic.  I am not a Psychiatrist, but a mother of three, small children, so all I can advise is based on what I would've done.  This is just an advise which will hopefully help or at least ease the pain.  Your niece seems to be obsessed with death, because this is how her way of mourning.  She is dealing with the loss of her "friend".  Adults can talk about it and get it eventually out of their chest.  Kids on the other hand close themselves.  I would recommend sitting down at the table with paper and crayons and asking her where she thinks her little puppy is.  To adults that would be just digging in the wound, but for kids it is a kind of acknowledgment that the puppy is gone and everyone hurts for her as well.  She needs to know she is not alone in this situation and that death is part of life.  I would explain that puppies are born, and some of them live long lives like her granny and some die early like her little angel.  I would try drawing a puppy with wings and little halo on a kite.  This could be done in front of her or before-hand.  It'd be nice if she was encouraged to finish the drawing.  Then you could show her that the puppy is flying high with the angels and that he is happy because he can always look down and see his little master wherever she goes.  I suspect that your niece may not want to participate, but I think if you treat her like a "grownup" by telling her that this is part of life and feeling sad or hurt is ok, she will eventually respond.  I know that the kite thing is a bit out there, but I would definitely invest the time and money in doing that.  Kids are very imaginative  and for a 4 year old it was a hard lesson to learn so early in her life.  I wish you good luck and I can only pray that this little girl manages to come to terms with her loss.|`|AA12285401	ohhh nooo poor little girl try talking to her about it and tell her that the puppy is in heaven and its ok now|`|f7cc283c939605ccd3cbb6921cc61563aa	I agree with davehuckleberry. Either you or her parents should sit her down and explain to her what the cycle of life and death is. Dont ignore this; make it into a learning experience. If you use it as a teaching tool, you can get her talking about how it upset her. Make sure she understands that it isnt her fault, that her puppy wasnt bad, and that it wasnt a punishment. Just getting her a new puppy will not help. If after she is spoken to, she continues the behavior, take her to see a doctor. She is young enough that this could either leave a lifelong mark on her so addressing the issue is important. Try looking for books on the subject. There are childrens books that help a child cope with death.
AA11866060	I believe that a "perfect fit" doesn't always mean a 100% smooth ride...there are too many things each of us need to practice, learn, grow through and a whole lot of other progresses.  And some of the times (my case) the most intense match, he died off at age 42 and I still go at 55.  Now I have a man in my life who isn't as intense but is a wonderful match and a great fit.  Is there only one?  Can't be with life spans what they are today.  For some individuals, there comes early a one who is such a match there is no question that this was who to wait for and is who to spend a lifetime with.  The answer to your question would be: it depends...|`|AA11656632	One.

I think a lot in this life is determined by chance, along with your decisions.  For some people their relationships may be like a fairytale, for others it's a case of making do with what they've got.  But no, I do not think there is one pre-determinded person who is put on this Earth to be your soul mate.  It comes down to running into someone who makes you happy, that's it.  Highly unromantic, but realistic I do believe.|`|AA11770346	You could probably have more than one person to be your perfect fit.

AA11496527	The problem with most drugs, ecstasy included, it can and will lead to trying or experimenting with other drugs. Also, ecstasy is under rated in it's ability to damage the brain and can cause damage to the body. You don't hear much about some of the side effects, but do some research, I did and learned what most users try to not understand.    The second part of your answer is; get your education on the drug and how a gateway drug works. Approach your friend from the stand point of knowledge. Give her your newly learned wisdom and let her know she has a choice or you will be unable to have a friendship.    Continuing to associate with her makes you guilty by association. One horrible example: What if she decided she could fly while she was on ecstasy as jumped off a building. Do you want to be known as the one who could have stopped the insanity, as her friend for not speaking up to her other friends and family.... Something to think about as a friend.|`|uVkMdIJNaa	what...i would have slaped him and them told him to go screw himself...and told her to dupm him|`|1DYMl9mPaa	slap her bf|`|d1SdRRIaaa	What kind of boyfriend does she have? Its like telling her he wants her for sex. You should really have a conversation with your friend. Thats not right for a stupid ediot to do that.

Dont you want her to be safe?|`|WI1JEQh4aa	umm yea i would kill him bc he could have raped her but didnt tell there tell there to get a test and make sure that shes not pregnet and that she doesnt have well u get the point just have her get tested (i would kill him and then let him airdry on top of an airplane) jk not really but we would be soooooooooooooo done|`|CemYvGRoaa	There is a big problem with that picture for all she knows he could of raped her. Does she remember the WHOLE night or just part of it? He gave her drugs and she is ok with that? I don't mean to be offensive but your friend needs some help. You should talk to a counselor  about what you should do, or better yet you can talk to your mom. I don't want to be harsh but if she got addicted then you would feel bad for not doing anything sooner. Also i would suggest you talk to your friend, but from the looks of it she will just get mad at you for it, and don't go after her bf he is the problem and going to him will not be much help because he will most likely twist up whatever you say to him.    Just go to an adult who you can trust and who can help you help your friend. Good Luck and i hope your friend starts to see straite.    Do some research on ectasy and if you write her a letter tell her all of the side afects that can damage her body and brain, or worse kill her. Your her friend and it is part of your job to sometimes protect her from herself, if your letter doesn't work it is time to tell your parents so that they can talk to her parents about getting her away from that boy and getting her help before she becomes addicted. Sadly with you living so far away the best you can do is tell her the dangers and if that doesn't work tell her parents, like another poster said, you don't want to be the one that could of stopped it and she ended up dying while she was high.|`|WMPv25Jhaa	omg!  she's ok with it?!  you need to tell her that he's probably upset because he wanted her to get completely wasted so he could take her somewhere and rape her  and i wouldn't think anyone would feel alright if someone raped them

(and dissing your boyfriend, too!) First off, he is being a jerk - he doesn't love you, he doesn't even KNOW you, and there is something SERIOUSLY wrong with anyone who doesn't accept "no" for an answer.      YOU are not disrespecting HIM to say "NO" in an assertive way.  You don't have to be disrespectful about it - just tell him, "I've told you before, I have a boyfriend; I have absolutely no interest in you, and I am not talking to you again - you are disrespecting ME, and you are disrespecting my boyfriend."  Then hang up, and don't ever take his calls again - block his number if you need to.  The friend that gave him your number must have mush for brains, anyway - that was just plain wrong.|`|9alN3sCTaa	tell him straight up that you are disrespecting him.. u dont disrespect someone u love.  u are a challenge if u have a man. they like u more if have a man.  it insults them more if u dont have a man AND you're not interested in them.  next time just say you dont have a man AND ur not intrested.|`|C2olZsNiaa	i would just tell him straight up.  Dudes like that you just gotta give it to him raw.  It's obvious that he doesn't care about your wants and feelings or he would respect the fact that you have a man and have told him your not interested.  Who cares if you see him around, he should be the one ashamed because he is blowing up your phone and calling you private.  Matter of fact...next time he calls put your brother or male cousin on the phone and have them pretend to be your boyfriend and tell him to quit calling his girl.

b600ad076fb3629871be8e7bdd726a5aaa	OOO PICK ME PICK ME! I think I finally realized why internet relationships are becoming so common - and EVEN acceptable! as if we care..    You can talk about your deepest feelings, and fears, and everything! In face to face dating, that doesn't happen much, and if it does, it's a long way down the road.  Seems to be a little competition on in the face to face.  But, go for the internet thing.  I am in LOVE with Will.  And even though you all might realize this by now, hehe, you may not know.. YOU ARE ALL INVITED TO THE WEDDING IN NOVEMBER!!!  No dressing necessary, as Will is gonna wear his kilt thing and play bagpipes! YAY WILLETH!|`|lkN2mQWTaa	i think its great because it give you a chance to get everthing out of your head, you can tell someone you dont everything about you but you can't tell your closest friend most of the things your thinking. i think its good to have someone to talk to but don't push it|`|435390163a4e541b09d69e6930758316aa	you just don't do it if you are young|`|oHcF2u28aa	Internet dating?  I think you mean trying to find a date on the internet.  It is a method to meet someone, just like paying a match making company, having a friend set you up, blind dates, etc.  It is a tool to meet someone.  It gives you a chance to learn something about one another in advance of a face to face meeting.  Do not give too much personal information and try not to get too deep till you actually meet someone.  If you meet someone do so in a public place, during the day.  I suggest meeting for coffee and then no one is out or stuck for a long period of time if you don't click.  Good luck.|`|71921d2d1fa46204a573f51a100b63afaa	well, if you wanna date online, that's your thing.  the only REAL difference between that and real dating is the physical aspect...at least you can't get pregnant, right?|`|mY0CvaaQaa	no problem as long as you are not lying with them.|`|l4vP0CQyaa	I think it's a bit unpersonal

She know's what she wants to do with her life, and even if she doesn't she is still looking for the answer.  3.Long dark hair Either past her shoulders or longer than that. Whether her hair color be black, brown, or a dark blonde.  4.Non Passive Aggressive I've already had the frustration of being fooled by a passive aggressive woman that wasn't interested.   5.Excellent Body She doesn't have to be the super model skinny type just a healthy thin.  Examples Sofia Vergara, Salma Hayek, Mellisa Joan Heart, Penelope Cruz, Shannen Doherty. So they would be like that thin but so thin it looks like they are unhealthy, and starving themselves.

It's up to you to be the bigger person. Accept people for whom they are, and make sure you aren't out there spreading rumors too.|`|zQ0mUDBUaa	some people just don't have common sense. Sometimes when people are jealous or feel intimidated they will do and say hurtful things to mask their own insecurities. People who don't know you talk crap because they hear things about you through the grape vine and have a negative impression of you from the start. Those people are just ignorant. But we are human and well all do it at one point or another. I think if it bothers you so much then ignore them don't go and retaliate and dont even think of pointing out their flaws to them cause i wont make a world of difference it will just give them something more to fight with you about. so dont try to fight fire with fire. Even if it hurts you and pisses you of the best way to combat a bully is to just smile at them and laugh at their stupidity even in their face and when they talk as you walk by just turn and smile or say "you need jesus i'll pray for you" that gets them thinking... OK, what did she just say? so leave it alone be the bigger person|`|RpfOKba8aa	They accuse you because they are to smug to admit they do these things themselves, they point out your flaws and act as if they have none so they seem like better people.  People like this re unconfident and mean.  they want other people to feel bad so they feel better.

df39317c2019a12a20be6252e0ceb86caa	It doesn't necessarily have to be the person you dreamed of it could be someone else but, the situation could be the same. If you tell that person about your dream you might freak them out. I would tell them about the dream but not that they were in it and watch their reaction. Good reaction, tell. Bad reaction, laugh about it. Trust me, I have "Steven King" nightmares every night just about and when I tell people the details of the dream they look at me in a different way like, dude is crazy! Now who I tell know what to expect from me but hey, I am what I am.|`|1eba83cae511a24f852920a7d8f2577aaa	yes, at least share the dream with him. let him know your concerns.|`|e9be038ee1aa464073677c3e4d10060faa	Depends on whether or not you have had dreams like this come to be true in the past.

No matter what the turn out is, at least, u cleared your conscience by warning them ;)|`|eb130cad41858cd190f62deed77b6495aa	yes!of course!

But (very) carefully, it can still be nothing.   anyway, if you had a bad dream, try to laugh over it.It may help.  And take care of that person. We do NOT get permissions, if we can't change the future they show.  Good luck to you.|`|311b9e3cef72a321f2d516a7ea1a04c1aa	No, it's just a dream, my friend. You watch too much TV, methinks.

However English and Urdu are also widely spoken due to the large number of expatriate workers living and working there.  About family ties it all depends on what kind of family you will be interacting with. The extremly traditional ones are very large with extended relations living together but these are not the trend. Usually families include the husband, wife , kids, parents of the husband and any unmarried siblings of the husband living in the same house. The elder relations are accorded extreme veneration although not to the extent accorded in the Japanese culture. But again this is subjective. Nuclear families are also found and is not an alien concept but these usually are more common within the expat populations.Paternal aunts and uncles are called "Ammati" and "Amm" and Maternal ones are called "Qalti" and "Qaal" respectively.

That is the single biggest reason guys fail to ask, and when you don't ask, you dont get.

Don't bring it up. If he brings it up, tell him you both are too young and for now you should just stay friends. When the two of you are older and more mature..... we'll see what happens.  2. You are both WAY TOO YOUNG
a1fb17d8d466c12eeed48a99ab4957c5aa	How old are you?  Does she like Kimberley?  Were her parents home?  Can you have friends at your house?|`|623934c31086693092ea968550fb1d23aa	Ask her but in a non combative way. Tell her you want to understand that you are not just trying to change her mind. Communication is the best way to develop strong trust for each other. Her rules may suck, but some parents don't care (it's much, much easier to be your kids buddy and let them do anything they want) Really loving your child is to care enough to bear the pain of having them hate you if it's best for the child. Remember- your mom  would literally die to protect you- awesome thought , isn't it?|`|68ef25ce515cf8edbaef9415879d8723aa	Gurl my mom be trippin too!  Just have at least one friend or a couple group of friends that your mom can get to know and trust you around. Once you've accomplished that, if you're going out just let her know that they're going to and she might..... just might... let you go.|`|AA10702820	That's what I went through a year or two ago. So I talked to my Mom and convinced her I'd be OK. I introduced her to my friend and their family. 'Let her get to know them, you know. I showed her where the house was and told her that I'd have my cell phone w/ me at all times and it would be on just in case she needed to call me or I needed to call her.   You should try my idea. If you don't have a cell phone, see if you get one or borrow your Mom's. If that doesn't work, stay at the friend's house at all times and give your mom the house number just in case she needs to call.    Good luck. You sound like a good kid 'n' I'm sure soon you're Mom will give you more freedom. 'Just wait a little longer-you're almost there.|`|643ee1269def6ad84a2ad8450e860581aa	A lot of this depends on your age.  Maybe your mom wasn't allowed to do things like that when she was your age.    Your mom could be afraid of what the other kids may do.  She doesn't know all of them and their parents.  She may think they drink or do drugs.  The only way to get her over this fear is to have the kids come to your house and let her see what you do in your spare time for fun.|`|8921821a248a6e49e23ea35fcb93324caa	maybe ur mom loves u so much!! thats a good thing..|`|2bfde9659efa5b0ae5d12aab6a92051eaa	Most parents are like that.

S9U2FtZdaa	wow, that is going to be really ruff on him, i would first talk to a school counselor and get him help as soon as possible, sit him down now and tell him the truth, he might get upset at you for waiting as a way of dealing with it and you want him to turn to you not away.  Let him know that you love him and that nothing will ever change that and your sorry about his brother and let him know that you will help him in anyway possible, maybe take him to the funeral, if the mother is a druggie, then she might not put a headstone on his grave and let your son know that you will do what you can because you know your son loved his brother.  it might keep his mind occupied on doing something good for his brother.  He might feel like he got the better deal and his brother didnt, so make sure hes not feeling guilty about his brothers death.|`|VsqHIoJYaa	since he didnt talk to him i dont think i would tell him kids have so much to deal with at that age

Its very annoying though.|`|WAEDIWz8aa	its when u show a lot of feelings, its not good!!!|`|7b1f8172d4a9ac10c23b5f3870728bb8aa	for me, if they dont apear interested then i leave them alone and move on to some one who winks back accrossed the room.    but im sure it works for some people|`|RA7WIdNIaa	No, I find women who play stupid games like that to be a real turn off.|`|MTwfByWVaa	Yes, in a way, it does. But the backdrop of playing hard to get is destructive. You have to know how to do it, and who to do it to. If you do it wrong to a guy you like, and who may like you, it will cause him to think that you are just a flirty girl and not so interested. If you do it anyways to a guy that doesn't like you, you'll just be wasting your time... so make sure there are mutual feelings between you and a guy before attempting.   How To Play Hard To Get:  1) Flirt around with him... A LOT! Look at him, smile, lightly touch him, laugh at his jokes, compliment him, mention a movie/sport/event you want to go to, etc.   2) The next day, limit all of this. Glance at him a few times, talk to him, laugh with him... but don't act like you are completely in love with him. Make yourself a challenge to him... a mystery.   3) Repeat  1 and then  2 until he either gives in, or you lose interest (he may not catch you playing this game, so make sure you are doing it right!)    I really don't suggest doing this, but there's how a girl who I like seems to be doing it, and it works on me. Make sure you're obvious about it the first day, indirectly tell him you like him, and then wait for him to make the first move.|`|lgXSmCQRaa	It only works depending on how interested the person is in you.|`|XdHEt6anaa	No.. I don't think it does.|`|dac26bdff4c1ae6e6c1c4dbb89df4ac1aa	no|`|NcufdPaAaa	Usually does with me.  Have a nice day :)|`|7BkbvD7Zaa	Yes.    Trust me.    It does.|`|ErNNjUdjaa	I really depends on the person, but most of the time it does.  Because no guy wants a cheap woman hanging all over them and even if they do "seem" to like the cheap girl, he is just wanting some.  I say that if you play hard to get then that shows a challenge and men love a challenge.|`|UbXp2K26aa	It depends who you're playing it with. If you like someone but they don't like you that way, playing hard to get won't do anything. But if you are dating, the right kind of playing hard to get can be successful. Don't be cruel, just don't be overly available. with my boyfriend I was kind of aloof with calling and making plans, I let him do most of the initiating until we were a couple and then i did more, and now we're 100% equal with everything, and it's been 2 years. I call him like a million times a day and so does he, he complains I don't call enough actually lol. But yes playing a little hard to get doesn't hurt in the beginning.|`|SyUeecsBaa	if you play it qood and riqht then yes it would work . be forewarned , you lose the risk of losinq the person . it's not qood to play w| people's emotions . like sayinq you're qonna call but never do , they text you and you never text back . it's just that you're strinqinq them alonq . you should be honest to the person because in the end someone always qets heartbroken or hurt .|`|TxvWkK1Zaa	I find it works for me only if I'm playing hard to get with someone who is naturally a flirt.

If so, then yes, he will enjoy the "chase" but if he's a shy or nice guy he might get discouraged into thinking you don't like him. It doesn't work for me 90 % of the time. So I wouldn't try it. :]|`|L0is0mCSaa	No! Don't try this please. You either like a guy or you don't. I really see no purpose to the playing hard to get thing but whatever, that's my opinion.

KIXlDnCIaa	Hell yeah!! Me and my best friend are ALWAYS going on about how much we love emo guys! We think their fashion is soo cool and they have fantastic taste in music and everything. When I first heard about emos I was all like 'well taht's stupid!' but now, I pretty much am one!!! Hair covering one of my eyes and all that! ^^   But anyway, don't listen to anyone who says anything mean about emos because 1. They don't know what they're on about and 2. They're probably just jealous because they can't get their hair to do that flippy thing! =P    So, basically what I'm saying is as long as you have a good personality you'll get a girlfriend sooner or later because the thing is...emo guys are downright fine as ****!!! =D  Sorry, got a lil carried away there...|`|hH6LTbEtaa	Im an Emo girl so i would be interested in you ;)|`|QiAb31bVaa	please do not change!!!!  obviously girls have a taste in boys  and maybe the girls you know, you arent their type  you will be silly if you change   and if your a nice person then the girls shallow to to like you  you will find a nice girl soon  i love emo boys:)  hope i helped|`|nI8G21y8aa	dont change for anyone. thats what i do. if i have a boyfriend but he dosent liek the way I dress I say that I'm not going to change for anyone.

Preps are known for their clothes, good grades, playing sports and having a lot of friends. Throw a party for no reason every so often. Try to keep the party drug and sex free. If you see someone getting drunk, don't let them drive or hurt themselves or others. Don't get drunk yourself-you will look like an idiot!   If you throw a party, try doing something classy like an oyster roast or just a plain old barbecue. If you plan on drinking, again do so only in moderation and if you're of the legal drinking age, but make sure and avoid 'trashy' drinks. Besides (bottled) wine (of good origin) and beer, go for drinks involving stylish liquors, like bourbon and brandy. Martinis are always good, along with margaritas, daquiris, pina coladas, etc. Avoid things like wine coolers and '***** beers.' These are definitely not classy.   Playing sports is a good and natural way to be one of the guys.   Walk into any 'preppy' labeled store [Polo Ralph Lauren, Lacoste, Brooks Brothers, etc.] and check out the clothing. Note patterns in the style, cut, and colors. That's what you want to be wearing.   Apply to Country clubs and Tennis/Golf resorts as well for work/membership as a teen or as an adult. There are many benefits to having those jobs and you can learn by observing.   Apply to a good fraternity, based on what your male predecessors may have been in (having a legacy is always a positive) or based on where you're from (Northern or Southern, basically.)   Take advantage to what your school has to offer. There are plenty of opportunities to meet people. For example, you can work on the school newspaper or join your local Future Business Leaders of America (FBLA) club, a business or marketing club is always a great preppy association choice. If you want to get into a good school after High School, it helps to be involved with outside interests. Be a "Big Brother" or look around your community-what can you do to help it?   If you are a Senior be very focused on college applications, scholarships, sports and classes.   Be at least somewhat cultured in the arts and go to these events. Obviously, you don't want to sound stupid when discussing Brahms. Some typical preps might have a musical background like private piano lessons growing up.   Be prepared to lose sleep. Between sports and studying, there is not enough time to do it. Get at least 6 hours a night.   Do your best because the only one you are doing it for is YOU!   No matter what, never have your underwear showing. EVER!!!!   If you have a tattoo you can cover it up with make-up or remove it with a laser.   You can "cover up" a piercing with a special type of wax.         [edit] WarningsThere are people who don't like preps. Beware of haters. They'll try and prank on you or embarrass you.   Just keep cool with people and you're all right. Sometimes preps do become friends with other social groups.   Don't be a snob or rude. Remember that while you act preppy, and dress preppy, not everyone wants to or can afford to. Be preppy and proud, but tolerant, welcoming, and nonjudgmental towards other types of people. Acting snobby just gives preps a bad name and is a sign of poor upbringing. Do not boast or brag about your things. Do not talk about family money EVER. Also learn how to properly introduce yourself and greet people.   Don't be loud and obnoxious.Be courteous towards everyone. Remember that being a prep is gearing to be a gentleman from an upper class. You can wear the "right" clothes but the behavior has to change as well too.   Don't let stress and pressure get to you. You don't have to be  1 in sports and grades. Don't start drinking because your life is too hard. Stay focused.   Don't hook up with trashy girls. They can mess up your life big time. Always play it safe.   that's how to be a prep.|`|b7gUW0CRaa	go for the emo/goth girls.dont go for the other types|`|VZPtCkweaa	don't change yourself for a girl! that's SOOO stupid! if you have to pretend to be someone you're not around your girl, you won't like being around her.|`|cdXMQai8aa	EMO?

That's how it is with you, girls probably see you and just assume your dark and depressed by the way you dress, they don't like that. Maybe just tone down the emo-ness.|`|gea2XyUwaa	most emo guys are hot lol :]  you shouldn't have to change just because you want to go out with a girl.  maybe the girl who said that is embarassed to go out with someone like you... or maybe it was just an excuse because you're not her type??  Well, anyway, there are plenty of people out there who would like you for who you are, and probably do like you already :]    so really, just be yourself because the girl who falls for you should like you for who you are. (i know you have probably heard this a lot but it's true).

WeCGbfMQaa	he pays a lot of attention to you, and what you do...  just pay a little of it back, he'd be head over feet for you...  he'd probably want opportunities to talk to you,  gift you stuff,  ask you out for lunches or something like movie,  talk about you,  look your way a lot in class,  want to be close, like in recess or something,  want to befriend your friends|`|GXEEvyflaa	he flirts with you:  eye contact, casual touching, pushing/shoving,smiling, giving compliments, or shyness towards only you, always trying to talk to you, talking to you about who you like...  Since he's immature a common thing that would happen if he liked you is if his friends push him into you or make it embarrisingly obvious that he has a crush on you.  Most of the time, you get a feeling a guy likes you.|`|jF0l4ghraa	he goes out of his way for you.  even just to talk to you.|`|0XvImpdFaa	he stares at u  he smiles at u  he mumbles when he talks to u|`|KpWfkp7faa	Most guys are NOT at all open about how they feel. They are so shy that they will sit like a desk away from you a whole year and say nothing about how much they really like you. It really depends on the guy. If he's really 'popular', he usually will come right out and ask you out. But usually, they won't give out any signs. They dont insult you if they really like you though, despite what people say...|`|T2isnQNKaa	he cares about you alot and your needs are more important than his|`|3lssqacfaa	you really cant. sometimes he will tell his friends, so just walk up to his friends and be like "your friend is kinda cute, i wish he would ask me out." that might work. but there is no way really. all dudes are different.|`|WPipgT9vaa	tease and aggravate you|`|U1e7wJgYaa	your 13 u should be consentrating on school not guys now get your head straight|`|hlq3Eo0haa	13yr old boys usually pull hair,flick bra straps,and get real loud with his friends around u.|`|eWTjH5U9aa	He can't stand being without you!|`|cfJywdN2aa	Hmm, I guess the way he Is around you. Flirts and talks to you. But if a guy is mean to you It may mean he likes you.  But anyways ur 13 to young,|`|0sPQnq7oaa	Uh, I'm going to say that guys are the same all the time. Theyre big *******, and if they DONT like you theyll proabbly be scared to tell you.  Well maybe you're lucky- 13 year olds are still immature for the most part (No offence :)) and he might be all "Oh ew, girls whateva."  If a 13 year old guy likes another 13 year old girl he will probably tell her. Or msn her. Or text her. Or ask her  to be his girlfriend.  Guys are the same for their entire lives- if they like you, you will know.
YqoxcTN9aa	i would say she was not, & if she was aware of what was happening she was leading him on|`|sR7jM0UCaa	What's wrong with her?   Drunk and leading the person on the whole time she was aware of the whole thing but didn't say no?  Sorry but...I don't think she was raped.    Rape is actually a sexual act(intercourse) *forced* on a person without his/her *consent*. It's more of act of *control*.    But this...she was practically leading him on! As you said, there was no sexual intercourse.  She was fully "aware". Why did she not defend herself instead of pretending to be sleeping to see how far this person would go?       Is this exactly what she told you?|`|uVkMdIJNaa	well it's not rape if she is willing...and bye the sounds of things she wasn't raped she just eather wants you back or she want attition|`|A6ej3lQWaa	opinion 1:i dont think that is call rape cuz she dint refuse ,if she said no that means she was raped but since she dint say no i dont consider that as rape.she dint say no that means she wanted it. opinion 2:maybe she was just affraid to say no..|`|AaWSU711aa	This pisses me off. Rape is NOTHING to joke around about. It is extremely serious and for someone to throw that word around is absolutely ridiculous. She said it herself. "She was fully aware of what was going on, and she didn't tell him to stop"     Not rape.    Stupid, stupid, stupid girl.    If she goes to the police to tell them, if I were you, I would call them, or go in anonymously and explain to them exactly what you just explained. She could ruin a guys life for this. Yes, what he did was not right... even if she was pretending to sleep, but he did not *rape* her. She allowed this to happen.

oHcF2u28aa	It is hard to know his intentions without asking him...most of us are not mind readers anyway.  If you like him and want to see where things may go, then call him.  Taking no action gets you no where at any rate.  Like the old saying says: nothing ventured, nothing gained.|`|AA11391274	He, ah, likes you. Aask him if he wants to hang out.|`|tnerjfswaa	he'd like to get to know you. where it goes from there is up to you.|`|TNronWfjaa	depends on the guy. do a little background research on him to at least get a better idea either wants to get laid or was too shy to talk to you before|`|AA10784570	He gave you his number to call him to hang out.  So, call him and hang out. Just have fun! If he starts to do other things while your hanging out then you know that he had other intentions.|`|nEoC2Gz3aa	well obviously his intentions are to try and get to know you better. Why would he ask if you'de like to hang out sometime together if he didnt? I dont understand why you would be confused; he seemed pretty straight foward. And as for calling him; just find something coming up you like to do on the weekends and ask him if hes free to join you for a casual dutch treat night out. not in those words of course. lol. just go for it.|`|66438aba840775dc2ad3061122acce74aa	play a little hard to get, see where it gets you.|`|mQRXDkBLaa	he is interested in you and he is just breaking the ice.

But try using a planner or  a method to keep track of your time. In a planner, you can write down everything that you need to. If anything comes up to block your schedule times that you didn't have originally planned (like shopping or talking to your friends on the phone) then you could simply refuse and continue on with what was scheduled.
6d5fc7ff8223982199ead46f0c03272faa	He has moved on and it is time for you to do the same. You have a man in your life and you need to put all of you attention into raising him. He did not ask to be put in this situation with a dad who doesn't want him so it's your responsibility to make up for that by being the strong force in his life.    Next you need to make this guy pay for support. He is responsible for this as much as you are and just because he didn't want you to have the baby HE STILL NEED TO PAY SUPPORT!|`|37e91c04e2b64532ce3711fd801b4064aa	I had a similar situation.  Just press the child support issue with the enforcement agency.  As for u forgetting him, you just need to worry about taking care of your baby boy.  It is your ex's loss.

If he doesn't want 2 acknowledge, pay and even take the baby so u can get a breather, his loss.  Don't call him &beg him 2 go to Dr's appointments with you & baby , or calling him 2 make him feel guilty if he doesn't do 4 the child. He needs 2 be checking & calling u at times 2 see how is son is doing. Your main focus is giving the baby all the love he needs & deserves. Take it slow, don't rush into another relationship right now.  When the time comes & ur ready 2 start dating, "Do You 2 the nth Degree"!  Involve yourself in things that make u happy &you'll see him fade right b4 ur eyes. You'ill still luv him "just" because he's the baby father.

EENUWAP7aa	I'm glad you asked this question. Let me tell you how I handled my wife of 25 years when she told me the baby might not be mine cause she had an affair.    I looked at her and she starts to cry and I put my head down and walked away. I walked outside got in my truck and went to the bar and  got drunk. Not one time and still today not one time have I raised my voice to my wife.    I am more proud of myself for handling this with aprofessional attitude then blowing up which solves nothing.|`|4B93B5H9aa	Insanity|`|42910e399cf1ff7bf1eb16843000fb5eaa	He's got anger issues.... with a baby on the way you'd better get working on that in counseling.|`|C2olZsNiaa	I'd get crunk with him and be like "why the fu*k you always gotta blow a simple conversation into an argument?  why Can't we just have normal conversations without you getting all hyphy wit me?"

Tell him that you are his wife and not his muthfu*kin bit*h.  He too comfortable and you been letting him get away with it way too much and too long.|`|GfYUvnudaa	Mildred sent me.Divorce sounds good hun x|`|AXbdNdPzaa	My ex was like that.

Does your Mom know, assuming they are still married? Also how can your sister be "with them" there is nothing to support.   Talking to the sister-in laws husband could make things worst. I would not do that since they have a child and you do not know how he would react.   If your sister-in law was not married and your step-dad was also single it would be a different (still uncomfortable) situation.|`|vJphK7cwaa	i would tell my sister to just stay out of it. if it's not happening in her marriage then don't worry about it. i know it will probably be hard for her since it's her stepdad, but he's a grown man and makes his own choices. it will only cause problems for your sister if she gets involved. if i were her i wouldn't even talk about it with anybody. if people start talking about i would just leave the room, or ignore it.|`|e7qwfj55aa	i cant be bothered to read that  but id jst smile

BUT MY QUESTION IS.... you wouldnt want your child to live better? nope, you'd just rather play a game... thats f-d up.

Child support calculation is created poorly. It's supposed to bring the economy gap closer. However, if you make less than her, by paying child support, your living stand gap widens. As a result, it's harder for you to spend time with your kids. You will have to survive first.  She can do anything, but it's the best to have some sort of agreement on the side. So, you guys can work things out without getting nasty to each other which can be very harmful to kids.|`|AA10892902	First of all it depends on your state and their rules.  You could call your local child support agency and ask how reviews are conducted.  See if it has to be initiated or if they are done every three years regardless of anyones request.|`|oHcF2u28aa	Child support is normally reviewed by the Child Support Enforcement Agency every 2 1/2 to 3 years.  The child's mother could seek a review as it is called if she suspects a change of income.  When the support is recalculated you may qualify for a different worksheet if you have the child a certain number of overnights per week.  You can go online and look up your state's worksheets and laws at your child support enforcement agency site.|`|zs0kUusfaa	Yes your child support payments will go up, when you get a new job, at least where i grew up, you will have to report that to the court, and they will know how much you make. So either way you are going to pay more for baby.|`|c4f140aed8465b753d1b75285ad5494aaa	It should stay the same, if you have joint custody..but it also depends on where you live.  I think matters like these happen in a state to state basis...I don't think that there is a general rule.  But why wouldn't you want to pay more..you have a child, and since IM guessing she has primary care of the child, and you will be making more money...I would pay up just a little bit more.|`|AA12142953	It could.  By federal statute, states must allow for a review of child support periodically no less than once every four years.  Check your own state for the period of review.  The question, however, becomes will they?  If you have a disinterested party, you may coast.  But if your ex happens to spot some increased changes in your lifestyle, she may decide to file on her own.  At that point, she may try to go for retroactive child support to match.  Also, if the state is involved in any reason (welfare, etc), they may have a computer do a scan of your filings and change that way.  And finally, you have a big could.  You COULD start by making 40,000, but that doesn't mean you would.  So I would say worry about that bridge when you cross it.  If it does happen, at the very least I would be putting aside the difference between what you owe and what you would owe under your new income in a bank account.  That way, you safeguard yourself in case that does happen.  Whatever happens, do not try to cut a secret deal outside of the court with the ex.  It's a one-sided game: they get the extra income, and when they finally do file, they can say that you haven't been paying your share.  Those extra payments would be considered "gifts".  If she does try, go to court and file on yourself.  It sounds stupid, but you at least guarantee the payments won't keep ratcheting up just to shut her up.  One other thing: if those three to four times don't include overnights, they don't count.  That sucks, but when you got an entrenched entitlement, they will do everything to increase the child support payments.
U00iZcvVaa	The same happened to me with a friend, , people change.  Do not worry about other friends will come, the real ones. Good luck.|`|xvCvd5xhaa	Either that they don't have your new cell number or lost your home number, or they simply don't have time to make plans with ya anymore, or, they called it quits and lead ya on. If I were you I'd call them and say hey man what gives, you kept calling me before, and we were making plans and sh it, and then you just stopped calling me. I need to know up front if you're ending our relationship as friends of course, cause I don't tolerate this sh it. At all. If they hesitate and make up some sh it, then you know that they are trying to end it with ya, so then I would just say you know what, I don't need ya, don't call me ever again, and see what happens. I guarantee that if you do this, one way or the other you'll find out the answer you're looking for. Good luck, and I'm sorry this happened to ya, I know how it feels, I had a friend that did the same thing to me, and she made me mad. She ended our relationship over the phone and I don't even know what I did. Even till this day I still don't, and that was sixteen years ago. LOL. Good luck.|`|gxczXgvXaa	They might just be busy.

One he/she mad at you for reasons only known to them. Best thing to do is wait a while so to give things to cool off. After a while try to talk to the person again and ask why he/she did not talk to you. two your freind did not get your new number!
n6ByZWrSaa	Well, I would say if you like him and he might like you then go for it. Your friend will get over it and plus you can see if your guy friend has any other friends for your girl friend. Things to do; be up front. Talk and have fun and let him know that you think he's cute. You can always insinuate things if you don't want to be too up front. Compliment his clothes in a way that doesn't sound like you think he's just wearing a nice shirt. Wear something nice but not seductive because you'll be at a boy scout event. That's all I can think of for now but do let him know that you think he's cute and then if it comes down to it, simply ask him if he likes you, but remain confident. Confidence is the key.|`|3786e0105c6580c1f6faae815037a834aa	shows in ur av. that u hav blond hair??? wear- pink or something light colored  say he looks awesome in whatever he is wearing  ask if he wants to come to movies w/ u afterward  say ur friends coming 2, but the friend cancells last minute and it will only b u 2  maybe scary movie??|`|AA11626129	Talk to him and try to get a date out of it

I was a big girl, and a very slim, fit, goodlooking man fell in love with me. He was not the least bit worried about my size and genuinely loved me for me. but since we had a child i have realised that losing weight is the best thing for my health and my childs welbeing. Now that im slim, its hard to imagine he could have loved that fat me, but he did. Asking this question is only going to make you feel bad, especially knowing that majority will more than likely say they go by looks. Dont be discouraged by them, because looks fade in time, wrinkles cant be covered up and boobs well they sag .. but inner beauty stays with you forever. If you have a look you will actually see that some very large women actually have stunning husbands/bf vise versa.

They let themselves go and are always eating and not working out. It is unfortunate that most plus size girls are being fed that way when they are young. I suggest you to change your lifestyle by taking up a sport and change your diet, not go on a diet. But I dont have the right to generalize plus size women because there are so many different reasons for it.     But if you want to change, there is my suggestion. It will change your life, and you will gain confidence in yourself. Start off slow in your workouts, and go from there.|`|AA12306254	im not a guy, but all guys are different, some guys like twigs and some like more to love! its all in the intrests of the guy

zQ0mUDBUaa	i have a friend like this....    sometimes i think she is just selfish and doesn't want to hear my problems but has no issue with telling me her liefs drama. i get it and yeah it is annoying. the best thing to do is trying to talk to her about it and tell her that it bothers you.

You need to say this affirmation over, and over again until it automatically comes to your mind.     Our future will take on the thoughts that we think today.  If we want our future to improve we need to start today changing our thoughts.

Elas costumam falar que preferem os bonzinhos, romanticos, honestos, trabalhadores, etc. Mas a maioria n?o sabe o que est dizendo ou dizem isto porque a sociedade espera que elas falem isto.    A na prtica voc vai constatar que o que manda na maioria das vezes  o baixo instinto animal delas, que  inconsciente. Assim, a maioria at sabe que o bonzinho, o cara trabalhador, honesto, sincero e que ama elas  o cara certo para se casar e ser feliz, mas elas n?o se sentem atradas por ele. A maioria s se sente atrada por quem n?o as ama e por quem as despreza. Da que a maioria delas assediam e correm atrs do cafajeste  semelhan?a da gua selvagem que se oferece espontaneamente para o garanh?o dono do harm, e que est prximo das melhores fontes de recursos (bens materiais).    Tambm n?o perca seu tempo com "mulher de cafajeste". Mulher de cafajeste s se apaixona por cafajeste. E  muito fcil identificar elas: em geral s?o aquelas que falam mal dos homens, que todo homem n?o presta, que n?o existem homem bom, que homem n?o ama, etc. Sabe por qu que elas resmungam tanto assim? Por que essas que falam assim s se apaixonam por cafajeste e querem que ele as ame. Ou seja, s?o contraditrias, histricas, psicticas e patticas por natureza: s amam quem n?o as ama. Depois vivem reclamando que nenhum homem  capaz de amar.    Com esta denncia que fa?o da natureza intrinsicamente ftil e maligna da maioria delas, muitas v?o mudar o tom e dizer que preferem os bonzinhos. Mas isto n?o muda o que eu disse. N?o se guie pelo que elas falam, mas pelas atitudes delas. As atitudes e as escolhas delas revelam quem elas s?o de fato e qual o perfil e voca??o delas. Por exemplo, observe com quem elas se relacionam. Isto ir lhe revelar muita coisa. Mas nunca se guie pelo que elas falam.  perda de tempo.    Mas n?o se desespere: escrevi isto a fim de alertar voc para que voc n?o seja vtima na m?o de uma mulher que n?o ama. E dessas existem aos mont?es por a.    A mulher que ama, essa sim  a mulher superior.  uma mulher diferente da maioria porque tem alma, tem esprito. Ela venceu os baixos instintos animais.  uma fonte de muita alegria para o homem que se casa com ela, fazendo-o muito feliz.  uma mulher de atitude, inteligente, e n?o de palavras fazias e falsas.  uma bn??o enfim.    Mas para encontr-la, especialmente nos tempos t?o degenerados em que estamos vivendo, voc precisar da providncia e bn??o divinas. Que Deus lhe d a gra?a e a bn??o de uma boa esposa!|`|i2OFqYt9aa	Acho que prefiro um pouco de cada mas a verdade  que na hora que bate a paix?o a gente n pensa se o cara  bonzinho ou cafajeste, acontece..|`|6f85ea392596e220118f160bd6910a87aa	O bom  o cafajeste na cama, e bonzinho para sociedade, esse  o ideal...|`|iEAlURkIaa	 sempre bom vc ter um homem carinhoso, amoroso e que te d toda estabilidade e prote??o que vc precisa e deseja.

Que desperte em vc aquele sentimento de aventura?  De proibido?    Esse  o tpico cafageste.    A verdade  que depende do que a mulher procura.

His compliments can bring you happiness like no one else yet his down talk or insensitivity towards you can make your heart break almost instantly.

ae3ecab489f9cbbdd2b51fb0492f64d3aa	You are so right. I can't believe this. If I were your wife I would be so proud of you. Who ever raised you did an excellent job. It is rare these days to see any display of good manners. My husband always helps those who need it. He will help a man or a woman get their coat on if he should see them struggling. He opens doors for both, he allows a lady to go ahead of him in line. I have always admired him for this quality. I always help the elderly and give my seat up to a much older person. Please continue to be the chivalrous man you are. Maybe your wife will realize that it is the right way to be. She might be a little jealous of other people getting a moment of your time. Maybe she is a lacking good self esteem? Well, any way keep up the good manners. It's refreshing. Your a dying breed.|`|AA11190264	just tell her that you're doing it for yourself. not matter how society have a set-plan of how to behave. you the one who feels that good manners are appropriate. just do what feels right to you.|`|AA11707323	Good manners and being there to do everything for everybody are two different things.  Nobody said dont have good manners but I think doing all the things you do for everybody is probably too much.  I also wouldn't like if my man constantly did things for other women.  Would you want your wife to do things for all other men that she does for you ? There has to be a line.|`|AA10633097	There is a difference between chivalry and good manners.  Your definition of chivalry is an apt one; whereas, good manners serve to enable all of us to live together amicably.  My Mom described good manners as "the grease which lubricates the wheels of humanity", a phrase I really like.    Using good manners because they show respect and consideration for everyone may make it  easier for your wife and others to agree with you.  On the other hand, I'm not sure even I would accept help from someone who feels they are stronger than I and need to protect me, and I've been that "chemo" person.  Perhaps just changing your attitude may make it easier for others to accept and appreciate your good manners.|`|89f7d60a12351a95b748818d03f8be2baa	WELL I GUESS I,M LIKE YOU I DO IT FOR EVERYONE BUT WHEN MY OTHER HALF STARTS TO FEEL LEFT OUT I SHOW HER MUCH MORE ATT. AND LET THE OTHERS OPEN THERE OWN DOOR UNLESS ITS AN ELDERY PERSON|`|7b95d756241ca06888e7790cd86bbdf4aa	Hope this helps:  Chivalry isn't just about "a knight in shining armor, who is rescuing a damsel in distress."   Chivalry means to "respect"; to value (people) as worthy of being helped; common courtesy, being considerate of others, caring about others.  Common courtesy is rarely seen these days>> Many people don't use a turn-signal when they're changing lanes, or when they turn off the road right in front of you these days, and that's so dangerous!  If more people (like yourself) would use more chivalry (common courtesy), there would be a lot less wrecks on the highways.   When my husband was a route-man, he had a hard time carrying the bulky load of products through the doorways of the stores.   It certainly would have helped if other people would have held the door open for him, by being chivalrous (using common courtesy, decency, politeness, manners).  My hard-working husband certainly does deserve to be treated with kindness (considerately, in a courteous manner).  Good manners shows good character (attitude, behavior), and there's nothing wrong with that.  The following is not an attack, not criticism, but is just a fact:   Chivalry itself (caring about others) isn't prejudice (isn't against) helping others. Prejudices come from within the heart of the self-centered individual>> who is unwilling to care about others.  **************************************...  The problem may possibly stem from her having been starved for love and attention in the past, and now she's wanting and/or needing you to be her knight-in-shining armor (only hers); to devote all of your love and attention to her, to save her from distress (suffering, misery).|`|5e5acf4aca8c86e08ec31a05e990ae89aa	That's true. Good manners are hard to find these days. I try my very best to treat people with respect and show others that I have very good manners. So that's a very good habit that you have.|`|0fda6e329818263201982a250b7d1b20aa	yr wife might just be feeling insecured. why not give her the pleasure of being the one and only and save the squabbles, it wouldn't hurt would it?|`|e9be038ee1aa464073677c3e4d10060faa	I don't know how you can convince her. I would say tell her to read the Bible and she'll see that Jesus treated EVERYONE with kindness. But from what you have said I assume she doesn't believe in Him. Anyway, I agree with you 100%.|`|61b91c748b9e512849e4c869f7c6fc8faa	OK, Gary. Say it with me. . . PRINCIPLE.        That is what you are acting with.    RE:  1:     Courtesy, respect, kindness, and decency should be accorded to all people, regardless of race, religion, social status, or gender.      Picking and choosing who to treat with courtesy based on the any of the above criteria is the height of bad manners and discrimination.    If everyone applied this principle, how many fewer wars would be raging right now?    RE:  2:      Remind that her ONLY she gets flowers, back rubs, taken away on romantic getaways, and other things husbands do for wives only.  Those are romantic gestures reserved for her alone.    The rest are are common courtesies that EVERYONE should perform for ANYONE, not just a spouse. Thus, you don't do them only for women. Men are accorded the exact same courtesies.    Finally, remind her that it is a good thing to be married to a man that does what he believes to be right, even if others (including her) disagree.
pVnUhYLQaa	Don't think many would agree with me, but I don't think there is a "right time". If you like having sex and he likes having sex, and you're old enough, then have sex. I had sex with my ex wife on our first date. We were married for 7 years. I had sex with my current girlfriend on the night we met. We're madly in love. But I don't judge girls for being sexual like a lot of guys (and other girls) do. I don't by into the double standard that society puts on woman. Whats good for the goose... you know the rest.    I like it wild always. Oral is optional but always a plus.    NOTE: I understand that a lot of people, both guys and girls, like to wait for the "right time" and I respect that view too. And I would respect a girl that I was with that wanted to wait. I just don't think less of her or think she's a "****" if she doesn't.    EDIT: Notice I said "if you're old enough" I don't know your age. I am an adult and my views are that of an adult. If you are a teenager then I would say to wait until you feel ready. Don't rush into something that you might regret. That being said; what the right age is depends on the maturity and feelings of the people involved.|`|G0pDFMSPaa	Wild and oral and anal and just have a great time.

You can get some white ones. I have seen this, and it looks awesome. I like the black and it is very acceptable these days for weddings. Maybe choose one color to go with, like hot pink, or lime green instead of all the rainbow.    Have your hair down in a sleek and smooth style with some pomade in the ends to give the edges a little spike. Add in a funky clip in a bright color to match your theme.
iqZUd5Fdaa	The first step is try not to think about them, which is easier said than done i know, sometimes its unavoidable especially if you still see them and you stumble across loads of things that reminds you of them.

HBKvQBaqaa	Hhaha. I am having the same problem! Anyways, the fact that he stares at you is a biiig hint. There is a chance he might like you. If he is in your class, you can try to start a convo with him. I know it sounds really hard (I know... I'va had experience) but just talk to him like he is a normal friendd! Another way to tell if he likes you is if he trys to talk to you! He wants to! Just keep in mind that boys will not always try to talk to you, more likely, they will try not to talk to you. That isnt because they dont like you, its only because they are shy and they probably dont know what to say! How cute! When you see him looking at you, try to keep his attention... look back at him. Its the cutest thing ever when boys will look at you and see that you are looking at them and they will smile. A smile is very very good! Well... there are about only two more things I can give you to figure it out: Pretend to forget a pencil. Then ask him if you can use his! Out of niceness... he will lend it to you. But if he really has feelings for you, he will tell you to keep it when you try to give it back to him. I know it sound like it would never happen... but it just might. But, keep in mid that boys wont always do that to catch your attention. Alot of them will stare at you, smile at you or purposely bump into you in the halls. Aww! Some of the, though, if they arent shy, will talk to you... ALOT!! Good luck! I hope (and think) he likes you back!|`|5nlqFbmtaa	i cant relly help you with these because i have the same problem right know

Then just be honest.  I guarantee you that if you tell them before they hear it from a teacher or see it in a grade report, they will be less upset and more likely to help you get back on track.

u7f0QB37aa	Proper is to put family and since you are no longer part of the family and was only at one time by marriage they did the right thing.|`|RjpPzbBJaa	No, I have to say they were in the right. You are no longer a part of their family since you are legally divorced from your husband. The obit's only include the surviving family members. If you were legally separated, then "ettiquite" wise I would say they should include you because . Even if you're still close to the family, you are now a family friend at most.|`|af644b7256e7bf5a53974bb99a32d482aa	No. But if you have children, they should have been included.  My mom died last May, and I did not include the ex. We were married 24 yrs.|`|qpAYU8Knaa	No. Exs are not included.|`|f6ab3ae3fee781c3975ea305670f972faa	you are no longer the daughter in law but really I rarely see daughters in-law or sons in-law mentioned in the obit even when they are married--only children and grandchildren.    so no, no reason to mention you in your ex FILs obit.|`|50b371e8637dae2470606af52c269bacaa	No, you should not have been listed since you were no longer a member of the family.  My ex husband passed away 6 years ago and I wasn't listed in the obit.  Our kids were, but not me.|`|e0ba0109fe4dec17f5724e5ab4f7544baa	not,  you are legally not a family member any longer    He was your FIL for 25 years, hopefully you were allow to pay respects|`|GcsUwIAaaa	personally   i would not have|`|SAgCy83Oaa	Sorry, but since you're not married to him anymore, there was no need to list you.  I don't doubt that you had some feelings for the father-in-law.  And maybe he even reciprocated those emotions.  But you are NOT part of that family anymore.|`|AA11334070	i would think that if you were on good terms with the father in law that it would have been nice for you to be acknowledged as a longtime member of that family.  25 years is a long time, and if they didn't want to put daughter in law, they could have put mother of.... if you have children|`|f6YsGOynaa	I know it hurts, but they did the "proper" thing.  Legally, you're not a part of the family anymore, but I'm sure it feels like you were slighted.  I'm sorry for your loss.|`|tmeo3diUaa	What they did was proper    Are you mad because they listed your ex new love?|`|4B93B5H9aa	No|`|SHARt1k3aa	No, you aren't the daughter in law, so why would they.  I understand you probably have an emotional attachment to the family after 25 years, but you are no longer their family.  It's hard probably, but .. no I don't think they should of.|`|WOHUFkJEaa	What the obituary could and couldn't have said really is of no consequence.  Remember your father in law fondly and appreciate the time you had with him.  A man has died, this is not a good time to be thinking about whether or not you are recognized.  No offense it meant to you, I'm sure you are really grieving and you just wanted it to be acknowledged that you loved him too, but most importantly I'm sure he knew that himself.  God Bless.
7f1e62b4efd02717cdcb62613b166ab6aa	that's scary.And his only 21.Im 21 and only had two partners my ex and my boyfriend.So just ask him because he seems pretty open with numbers were those other girls hook ups or past girlfriends.Either way that's way to much.|`|AA12372161	youll be just another notch on his belt|`|a6j0cwgqaa	Don't throw your virginity to someone that clearly doesn't think its that important... (15?) If you have waited to be 19 don't throw it away! Save it for marriage where you know its something really special! I am 19 and also a Virgin!|`|C2olZsNiaa	I don't think there is a number that is right but Ican tell you that for him to be 21 and tell you that he has slept with 15 people...that's too much.  Not the actual number but because he told you.  Seems like he is proud of his number and wants that number to grow.  Don't allow him to be your first...save it for somebody who is worth it.|`|LJxKNAdVaa	thats a lot     maybe he just wants you to have sex too  and thats it|`|tc0gU2o0aa	Be careful, dear sister, just as he is an expert in manipulating you, he has just as much experience in dumping people in the trash.    Be careful. have sex to have kids, and then you will have a very happy marriage, and a happy life.|`|pDNP7YyRaa	dude with that many others before you i would be careful...he could have picked something up from one of them and not know about it...if you do decide to be with him make sure he gets tested first, STD'S are forever!!!|`|eorrIBFuaa	OM__G!! dnt im beggn yew.!! 15 thats tooooooooooooo much..2 is fine 4 me|`|YiGSPWHRaa	Wow, that seems like a lot but now a days, people are having sex alot earlier than I ever did.  I applaude you for keeping your virginity and I would suggest keeping it for someone who would appreciate it more.

Don't look at me, don't leave the milk out, don't leave your bookbag in the floor or anything.    Short answer:  yes, most definitely|`|jdVxsK4yaa	i dont thnk dats y grls get emotonal  we just want an excuse 2 complain bout thngs n b emotonal...not all of us r lke dat thou =)|`|sKmpVHZZaa	Hell yes haha..and snappy and angry|`|VygBNA0Waa	yes its like i cant help it but i know that im like that so i watch a girlie movie by myself have a cry get it over and done with it and it doesn't effect anyone else|`|C2olZsNiaa	Heck Yes!  It doesn't happen every month though.  So months are worse than others.    I cry, get angry, get depressed, etc...the pains of being a woman...men will never understand|`|y5957sd2aa	Actually i get like that during my period. A lot of women I know get aggressive and bitchy. I dont! I just cry and whine a lot.. i get easily depressed lol.

YqoxcTN9aa	am totally confused over your question
AA10743159	This is a no brainer, sure you did a stupid thing, he did to, so why aggravate the situation. As the old saying goes '" Let sleeping dogs lie"  What he doesn't know won't hurt him. If your relationship was rocky to begin with, this information, won't help either of you.  He is going to be gone for a year, that's a long time, to be without anyone in your lives. If he has played around, before, he's likely to do it again.   You are putting a lot of trust in this guy to change, While you stay lonely and innocent.   I think, you need to rethink this whole thing. Keep in touch, but allow each other to see other people. Otherwise, both of you, will be set up for failure. If your relationship is open and honest. while you are apart. you may stand a chance, to build your relationship back up when he returns.   don't base your whole life, or at least a year of it, on what happened during that one month.|`|xWdBGitfaa	the right thing to do would be to tell him but if he wont forgive you then HELLLLL NO! dont tell him!|`|G0pDFMSPaa	No.  You are trying to build a relationship just let it go and focus on him.    Sounds like you both have some growing up to do.|`|TRvAhhNKaa	Telling him you cheated only makes you feel better, although since he's a cheater too it might not matter. Sounds like you guys need to really rethink this long distance relationship. How do you know he's not cheating on you again while you're cheating on him at home?|`|YIvIVvWFaa	HE has slept around and cheated on you more than once, and now you think HE may not forgive YOU for ONE slip-up? (Sorry for all the caps. They are my outrage showing.) That isn't a reasonable person, and if you marry him, you may well find yourself having to forgive him over and over, while he jealously guards you and makes hideous scenes if you so much as speak to or laugh with another male.     IMHO, you are foolish to wait for him. He will probably be sleeping around while he is away, too, unless he has made a serious commitment not to. But do you really think he would keep that sort of promise? Has he even made one? I'll bet he hasn't.     I rest my case, as trial lawyers say.|`|SLyLhS1Iaa	DONT TELL HIM.  seriously, think about it, no good can come from telling him.|`|RLEUq0Pnaa	hell yeah and be prepared to get dumped|`|h0oceAwAaa	well.. karmas a bitchh.|`|Za7RV4Kqaa	do what feels right to you|`|AA11852242	tell him for what. all men are dogs. relationships are rocky but it doesnt have to fall to pieces into pebbles. and forget what everyone eles is saying. at the end of the day its just you and him. thats all that matters.|`|5FVyVS9vaa	Why is it alright for him to sleep around and not you? Don't mean to say you sleep around, but I think you know what I mean. I would move on, do you think that he will remain true to you while he is away? Ha Ha, I don't think so.
7THgBSvfaa	I won't..|`|bC5XeVEIaa	Glad to see so many girls that appreciate the fact that it's a good thing. lol|`|keEfXfg8aa	i'm sorry. i'm happy with a normal sized @$$ cuz have you seen the "big booty girls" naked? looks like there are waves in her booty.|`|7BkbvD7Zaa	I love it.

dalNxu8zaa	if its way out there then i will remmeber it but usually when i am on myspace or texting i am doing 4 other things at the same time so i dont always remember it|`|hTQPF2xBaa	I thought it was guys who were more forgetful, birthdays, anniversaries etc   :/|`|7b1f8172d4a9ac10c23b5f3870728bb8aa	you know how old people say teenagers have selective hearing?  well most girls have selective memory|`|OD3hxWxvaa	i notice that about guys mostly|`|TgU9P6pdaa	In my relationship, I have the better memory.  I remember things my boyfriend told me 2 years ago.  I don't think you can say that all girls have bad memories, or that guys do.|`|7nGwou8uaa	i think the things that embarrass you or are awkard they dont think are embarrassing or awkward, so they pay less attention to it than you.|`|KEWbsDTIaa	I thought that was just me. I've always had a huge problem with remembering things that guys say.It's not because I dont care I just can't seem to remember alot of things. It use to drive my ex crazy but I couldn't help it. It might be because we get approached so frequently and are so social. I've also found that I only forget stuff when I'm really attached to the guy and comfortable with him. I remember things when it comes to friends and "flings".|`|TJiGs8S4aa	What's that you say?  I'm sorry, I didn't catch what you said.     LOL.    Girls dish so much to each other, anything you have to say will seem like small potatoes.
AA12204752	So you want to move into someone else's home? They will have rules too. It's not the same living in someones home. You think you don't have privacy now, it will be worse after you move out. Being completely on your own is when you're able to " live on your own". Being able to pay your own way on everything, from rent, food, utilities, transportation..etc. You have it made right now. Sit down with your folks and ask why they want you home so early. There must be a reason. Be mature about it.|`|0vCWTn1yaa	depends on what stateyou live in some states you need a court order to do so.yes, five is a bet early|`|AA12202402	go to your states website....search emancipation laws  if they say 17 you are alright if they say 18 you can not move  example: www.mississippi.gov|`|DeMcghkoaa	i know parents are, well, parents and this kinda stuff will drive you up the wall.  just a bit of advice though.  i know your tired of them and their rules.  will they allow you to get a job?   you need to milk this as long as you can before you move out.  work your butt off and save save save.  being independent is hard esp if your planning on going to college.  you want to be financially stable when you move out on your own.  just really THINK about it before you go huffing puffing and moving out.
JGxemN3waa	Oh man girl that is a toughy,    at least you're still young though.  Try going through that at 30!  I broke up from a failed marriage (he was abusive) at 23, then lived with my now ex-boyfriend for 4yrs and we broke up almost a year ago.  Its tough, no one can really tell you how to make "YOU" feel better, but I've found that the best thing to do is remove yourself from things that remind you of it and start fresh.    There are plenty of men out there who will appreciate and love you for you, don't dwell and waste time with someone who doesn't see how great you are.  The older you get the more you will realize just how important and valuable your time is.    Invest more time in other relationships, like friends and family, start having a regular girls night, get a pet, focus on your career.  Men should be secondary ...    YOU SHOULD BE FIRST|`|AA12226240	awwwwwwwwwwwwwww!  i felt like crying when i read this!  omgosh  im really sorry  this is hardd!!!  find another guy...get out there again!|`|Tq8eAIZ3aa	heyy im sorry!!        girl go have a girls night out and have some fun and get over that a**hole have funnnn and im sorry. dont forget to eat cookie dough and if u dont like cookie dough then eat ice cream lol|`|h0oceAwAaa	that is hard to go thru. i can feel your pain. i feel like crying for you. i mean, better friends than nothing you know?|`|P9oduCUgaa	oh babe im sorry to hear that.  that's pretty messed up.  you can just wait & let him miss you.  he is definatley going to come back to you.    keep your head up high babe.  try one month if nothing then move on babe.  good luck.|`|v1tHjJ3haa	Probably talk w/him and see if you both are willing to work it out together. Try some marriage counseling. :)|`|OuQJYm4zaa	I've never experienced a break up like so  but I'll try my best to help.  It's going to be very very painful obviously  but the thing to remember is that it will fade.  It will always go away.  it may take time but it will go away and you will end up  with the person you're meant to be with.  I mean you're only 22, that's still really young.  So keep yourself super busy with girl friends and  do exactly what makes you happy in the time being.  It'll help pass the time and before you know it,  you'll be moved on and realize that it wasn't meant to be.|`|6edczUEBaa	Honey you are going to be just fine. You are young and you WILL find someone else one day. I know its hard and you feel like you are never going to get over this but you will. It may take some time but trust me the sadness will go away and it might be sooner then later. It is hard to get over someone you love but keep busy and hang out with your girlfriends and you will be just fine.|`|Mu6E3SF2aa	look obvioulsy he's making a huge mistake  he's not good enough for you  just move on there is someone out there for you  Lots of Luck
UNXf7lZZaa	I met my fiance when I was thirteen years old. We've been together for six happy years.
s6stLtvLaa	What do you mean by cruel?  Like tie you up and hit you type of cruel?  I had two older brothers and a younger sister.  We are all close in age.  When we were younger we all took turns picking on each other (with he exception of my sister).  We were all horrible to each other.  I ended up in the ER once because of a dirt clod fight.  My brother picked up what he thought was a dirt clod and it was a rock.  I got pegged (I was the target in this game) in the back of the head.  Then, we were playing blind man's bluff and I got shoved off of the top bed in my brother's bunk bed and hit my head on the corner of a table.  I can't tell you how many golf ball, baseballs, basketballs and foot balls have been thrown at my older brother.  And I can never forget the day I stapled my older brother's hand....    You will find that as you get older you will be able to fend for yourself and come up with ideas that will get them good.  Until then, if they are not being horrible then you need to just go along with it.|`|UACIUmwtaa	thats a hard question. i have 2 older brothers who are much stronger than me and i try to do pranks and stuff to them but i end up getting punched! i dont know what to tell you....unless you want to get hurt...lol. just go into their room and get all their underwear and hang it on the fan and stuff i did that to mine........lol|`|wy7GYq8faa	story of my life. I am the youngest of 5 sisters and 2 brothers.  They are always picking on me. I usually ignore them but lately its gotten so much worse, so I kinda got mad and punched my sister in the face. she is 20 years old, im almost 14. anyways, and we got into a fist fight, but now she respects me, and thinks of me a lot, esp when she looks into the mirror, cuz her eyes is bruised, anyways, so she doesnt make fun of me anymore. =) but I think what you should do is talk to them about it, tell them that you don't like it and that it really hurts you, and if they dont listen, punch them haha.
YqoxcTN9aa	always keep your distance & dont associate of school, even if nothing ever happens accusations might & even if innocent people will still look at you like you are guilty|`|phAqOpzZaa	you should tell the principle! thats sick...what r you going to do when he hits on someone else...will you be jealous!

XdqvvLaiaa	This happend to me! Only that i was going out with the guy for a year.  MOVE ON, as much as it hurts and as much as u like him dont fall for his B.S.  believe me, you do not want to get hurt again.!  Move on && explore the world! :)|`|brKp7aF6aa	hmm boo boo if he did it to you once, what makes you think he wont do it again? and CLEARLY he had been talking to this other girl while yall were still dating, so therefore he is no good. stay away. DO NOT go back with him. you will only end up heartbroken again. It goes back to the saying "Once a cheater, ALWAYS a cheater"|`|JGxemN3waa	HE IS NOT WORTH YOUR TIME            as soon as you two get back together what is to stop him from doing the same thing all over again.  He does not value you as a person or respect you.    Stay away, go out with his best friend for revenge|`|Gx14PIvxaa	Really? Because in another question you said that you had sex with your step-brother. So are you a virgin or not?  Trolls annoy me.|`|AA8k0zPSaa	=[|`|DLWmtpvSaa	1st of all you have to tell him no and 2nd of all he cant just pick u up nd drop you whenever the hell he feels like it and let you live with the pain and for him to some back and probably do it all over... he knows that he can get to you that's y he came back its cuz the other girl probably left him and he just wants some one to have him now and hes probably going to find someone wile he is with you.. so the best thing to do is just to tell him no because if you go back your going to regret the choice you made to go back so just let it go as being friends now and if it was meant to be maybe if y'all are still friends in a couple of years try again ..(maybe he will mature allot more)|`|fusIwst4aa	It is up to you, but if it was me i would give him one more chance , and hope for the best... good luck!    xox, skullprincess|`|odQewFgvaa	Don't do it. You're too young to get into bad dating habits.     He broke up with you to go out with her. What happens when he meets another girl??

But it doesn't completely make a differrence. I have lost like 60 lbs... I set a goal for myself when i first started to lose weight and i have achieved that goal and exeeded it but i am still not happy with the way i look and i still think that i am not the way i want to be and i think half of that reason is because i never came to terms with my body. So i definatly think that it makes a big different to make change the way you look at yourself. Now i'm not going to tell you that it doesn't helo at all cause i really think that i does. Know that i am alot thinner i am more outgoing and outspoken, I have alot more friends and i am comfortable most of the time. Not all the time and sometimes i really do have a hard time but now i am working on my last 20 lbs and after this im just going to work on going to the gym alot and trying to boost my self image by thinking positive things about myself. Good luck to you!|`|212073dbf257b76fa402a436cfa16cc8aa	well do exercise and eat healthy go to Weight watchers.com and they give some recipes that you can cook  and try slim fast and buy the powder ones so you can make some smoothies for your self
ZAPWDFKxaa	During a hug or while making out might be a good opportunity to do it.  If you have been together for a few weeks it should be alright.  Just start rubbing her back while hugging and slowly move your hands down south.  If she has a problem with it, she will stop you or pull them back up.  Just make sure you stop when she says no.  NO means NO and you don't want to ruin that trust or it will be over.|`|7kga2aRBaa	lolll yea dont worry about it so much.  you can touch her but while your dancing at the dance.  dont ask her first, have confidencee|`|uVkMdIJNaa	well i don't think u should tuch her but...but if u were to tuch her butt ask her in a sexxy voice...and if she says no don't look upset...play it cool|`|6120b4c0e14e03017c40ad3ceaa54fe7aa	Don't put her booty on a pedestal it will not be a deal breaker for you she probably wont even acknowledge you did it, she is probably just as nervous.   I take it from your comment on hugging and kissing, that you have already done that. I would think this is a much smaller step than kissing.   Back in the day when I was your age, I found it easiest to make advances at dances. LOL This allows you to hold her close and get more comfortable with each other and start with your hands on her lower back/upper butt. If she is not comfortable, you will be able to tell.    During all my days of dating, I always started easy pay attention to other parts of her body like her ears and back. Get her comfortable with your hands on her body.|`|25956debe11bb65c998cbd3ded681c23aa	i don't exactly know, but i don't think you should touch her butt yet. i think you should wait a little longer. not long but wait like till you guys are about 1 month together. ***** whispering****** most girls don't really like boys touching their butt.|`|twortDpyaa	Just spank her, as a joke.   Then it'll catch on and be less awkward.  but dude, dont over think things like this. Touching your girls butt isn't a priority. Kissing her, or meeting her parents is.   Better yet, just don't grab her ***.|`|AzGcXCIbaa	i would not do it with a big crowd for the first time cause u dont no if she likes that  i think when ur  giving her a hug or somthing jus let ur hands drop a bit and squezee a bit well this is how id do it|`|Slr6jtMGaa	ask her in a sexy funny way.....like my fiance does lol
aHWGRNbDaa	First, breathe tell your mind that everything will be okay and no matter what you're going to live through. He may be going through some problems or he might just be a little quiet. Take a breath and ask him why. I'm in love with my boyfriend and he stops talking to me everytime I can't see him, this whole day he hasn't been talking to me. Talk to him, if he doesn't respond tell him your scared, people in a relationship rely on being open, if he is not telling you everything hug him and tell him you love him, tell him you care and that you want to know whats going on. Taking an agressive coarse can put him back on explaining even more, you dont want to scare him. It's like trying to get a scared dog out of a cage, throw him a bone! =] good luck and dont worry stay calm if he loves you he'll come back.|`|4hJgn2e5aa	talk to him.|`|YTpizvPeaa	dump em?|`|wnME0d4uaa	is this a long distance thing?? maybe something is wrong a lot of guys get quiet and dont say anything because they did something that might hurt you..     talk to him maybe it would help if it were in person or something cause if all yall do is talk online maybe he is just sick of talking over the computer.

Good Luck!  x|`|PosThPHUaa	well, if you didn't cheat on him then you should try cornering him and explaining how there was misunderstanding. if you did happen to cheat on him, then good luck, just try telling him how it was all a mistake and nothing like that will ever happen again|`|NEiA9pw2aa	Hi Dear !    Your situation is not very complicated. You just  go to him & told the right thing. And if you are not   able to meet him just SMS him or make a call & tell  all the things very clearly & confidenditely. If  you will do it, he will identify your truthfullness  and there are high chances that he will get back to you.    I also faced some situation like this...& i would like to  tell you that i got a very good book on it that helped me get him back.    Get Back Your Ex- The Magic Of Love    www.infoindia.co.in/getex/
qAgF5R3Yaa	You want her back because you feel that she completes you.  In which maybe she does.  If you got tired of the relationship it means you've gotten tired of her.  It's time to let it go and let her go you just miss her company.  That's ok, honestly she says that she is happy and she has moved on so I think that you should do the same.|`|2c89cd9f9d087548a3d65a53e0d5756baa	Yes.....perfectly natural. All part of the process|`|EDXh0tk9aa	Yes, regret is normal. Especially when you feel down and/or grief at the end of the relationship (which most do). It will pass eventually.

YqoxcTN9aa	hang with other friends|`|VH98AKVgaa	he sounds like a stalker (towards her i mean)|`|1DYMl9mPaa	two words screw him|`|uVkMdIJNaa	you have other close friend hang out with them|`|2tCbCvzXaa	That is what is hard w co-ed relationships. It should be expected when he has a gf he will spend less time w you. If you want to hangout w him and the only available time is when she is around then you have to accept that. Whether you like her or not she is in his life and she is going to remain there until other wise. I would just try to get along with her, If he says he doesnt have time then believe him. It could be worse. The gf could feel threatened by you and not want him hanging out with you at all. Be happy she is ok with all three of you together. Good luck hun

I was walking down the street and heard this buzzing sound, I looked up and saw something in the sky.. I tried to get a clearer view but it disappeared behind some clouds.    I continued walking to see if it would come back into view, As the clouds began to move i noticed that this strange "Craft" was hovering! It wasn't moving at all, I stood there staring in awe for about 15 Min's until it just whooshed off into the distance.    I was puzzled by this and went home to tell my family what i had seen and to ask them if anyone else had seen it or if it was on the news or anything, As i neared my house i noticed a police car outside, I thought to myself "What the...?" I called to one of them, "What's happened?" The officer standing at my door jotting down details in his notepad asked me "Do you live here son?"  I replied, "well yes, I do?.. Can you tell me why you are here?" Just then, My mother burst out of the door.    "Omg your home! My mother said as she scooped me up into her arms, You have been gone all night! I've been worried sick, We all have!"  At that point, I was thinking this was rather strange as i had only been gone 30 Min's max!     Spooked by the whole thing i decided to get a drink for my dry throat, I was totally confused and started asking questions, Everyone said that i had been missing since 10am yesterday morning, Saturday to be precise, i looked at my watch and said "erm, But it's only 10:36am.. " My mother then said "Yes! Exactly, You have been missing more than 24 hours, It's Sunday, Don't you know what happened? You don't even know where you were?" ...    i desperately needed a shower at this point, A cold one! "Be right back mum, I need a shower, Tell those cops to go away, I'm fine.. I don't feel like answering any questions right now" Off upstairs i went, As i neared the top of the stairs i tripped over my cat, Who was sleeping right at the top of the stairs.. Dumb cat! I fell and hit my face off the door handle of the bathroom and that's how i got this black eye!    Just something simple like that, Everyone will believe you :)|`|DUgo8Edjaa	you fought someone hurting a dog/ cat and they punched you which you couldn't defend yourself to as you were holding the animal, which you took to RSPCA etc.    Kat xxx|`|jrQsM8vwaa	walked in to a lamp post or that you was saving a cat from a tree and hit your self on the tree but you got the cat safe lol|`|DPg4pixWaa	I ran into an open cupboard door.

X6I49NUZaa	Ok I know this sucks to hear and you are obviously aware you do not want this girl as your friend!  I know it is hard esp. if she has been your best friend for so long but trust me you will be so much happier without her.  I am in a very similar situation......the girl i considered my "best friend" for the longest time absolutely despised my boyfriend...she would be jealous when I hung out with him. She only called me when she had nothing better to do, or needed something from me.  It sucks but really you will be better off. You need to tell her you don;t like the way she treats you and don't want to be as close as friends as you may have been in the past.  I wouldn't say to break off the friendship completely because in all honesty that just calls for a load of awkwardness..but she needs to be aware you don't want to put up with how she treats you...it's not ok!|`|7f1NrNh6aa	Just tell her that since she treats you like crap you don't want to be friends with her. It is a good reason and she should just leave you alone.|`|ymK1hg2Raa	make her listen to you. tell her that if she doesn't quit treating you like crap, she's gonna lose you.    if she keeps doing it, avoid her at all costs and just stop being friends with her.    good luck!|`|kzjclCaeaa	I agree with everything they said.|`|JERUmEFzaa	She doesn`t sound very nice. Tell her that is bothering you and that she needs to stop. If she doesn`t than dump her.|`|Y5nrrPO8aa	well you should just talk to her, she's not going to randomly know whats wrong with you.  ask her why she's being a B*tc* and see if you guys could work things out first. you shouldn't let them 5 years of knowing her go to the trash. but if you really see that she's not changing, just stop talking to her for a while and see what that does.|`|I4uIOp1maa	u shouldnt have to put up with bitchy friends.  tell her how she makes u feel and get every1 else against her  sorry if that dnt help much|`|BTEUx4a4aa	i just went through this same thingg my friend and me would have the best time when we were together and then if we were with other people or if she was even on the phone with someone else she would treat me like crap so i wud just act pissed and ignore her and see what happned but i jsut went up to her and said i need to talk to you and make her talk to you alone and if youre not brave enough have one of your good friends who you know will defend you come up too.  it worked but then we ended up not being friends because she thinks boys are more important soo i cut her out of my life  but definitely dont put up with it   you can do it   tell her that it hurts  :D|`|xvCvd5xhaa	Just tell her flat out the truth on how you feel right down to the penny. Listen, even though we've been best friends for five years, I just can't take anymore of your bull sh it. I can't take it. You treat me like crap, and I'm always nice to you, and inviting you everywhere and I am tired of being treated like it doesn't matter to you how I feel. I think it's best that we stop hanging out. I am sorry. I hope you understand. Now she will be upset, and try to beg ya not to end the relationship, but if you're flat out desperate to end it, and to move on with out her, then yea, don't cave in, just be strong and say, I am sorry, but I can't take any of your bull sh it anymore. Good luck.
RgAVm7zCaa	So you basically want to leave her in her time of need and make it worse. Wow, what a jerk. Um, but anyways, just tell her you just don't feel the same anymore, and you just want to be friends.    xx-Cody|`|f6VhiYJeaa	dude like, if i know the answer to this question i would write a book its like the hardest question ever so i say try to get to know her and like help her|`|oBk1bD1yaa	if you leave her it might make her kill herself.. dont do that.. tell her things will get better. and something good always comes from the bad. and god loves her. please dont leave her in a time like this. it will only make it worse.|`|VZPtCkweaa	don't dump her! that could make her MORE suicidal if she really likes you!|`|hCJzZ5rnaa	It's a difficult situation, I know myself.    You have to do what makes you happy, and if you're not happy with her, then it is time to end it.    I know, easier said than done. I've been there. You would feel awful if she committed self-harm upon herself, or worse. That's why you must inform her parents/guardians or other family members.    Tears and upset is inevitable, I'm really sorry to tell you that.  Ultimately however, you will end up happier in the long run, and I hope and believe that she will as well.    Kindest regards and best wishes.|`|29maScwJaa	Your Answer:  I understand the pain of this. I've had a suicidal girlfriend, one of my best friends right now is stuck with one too. They're a nightmare. No offence to your girlfriend or anything dude, but I know you deep down agree... Im assuming she is between the age of 14 and 17, right? It's a phase, so you can either ride it out, or get her to hate you. It's really sad, its like something out of a movie or something, but you basically can't break up with her, all you can do is make her hate you until she breaks up with you. Usually the person being dumped is the one who gets more upset, so you just have to keep it a secret that you are trying to get her to hate you, and keep on going until she doesn't want you around anymore, then it's like a win-win situation, and she might even get happier by it somehow because the one who dumps is usually the one who gets a lot off their chest and feels better after breaking it off. I hope you get what I mean, but Im being totally serious with my answer to you, get her to break up with you, because that's the only way you can have a better chance of her not hurting herself.     Suicidal people are so complicated, and nothing you can say will ever make things better! If she starts complaining to you, pay attention, but don't suggest options for solutions because that just drives them even more wacky until before you know it they're going nuts. So keep that in mind. As much as you want to help, don't, because usually all people need is to talk it out and vent it and then they feel much better afterwards. Hey, it's worth a try, worked for me! If it comes down to it, really just stop caring alltogether, take her **** but don't let it affect you, it is very possible. Good luck brother.|`|cxVmq2kraa	Honestly, right now you don't.|`|L2pkns9maa	Theres no nice way of doing it.

And if she kills herself; oh well.|`|Q5KFND17aa	a lot of teenagers threaten suicide to their bfs/gfs because they dont wanna get dumped, but just think about it, how many kids actually do it? Maybe you know one or maybe even two who have but thats REALLY rare and most people dont end up commiting suicide. If you're sure she's serious, maybe you could get her to break up with you, but you shouldnt have to feel stuck with someone you dont care to be with. Just let her go easy and maybe even help her find someone new. Do it in person as well so she cant do anything stupid right then and there.|`|KW77oNWraa	you can break up with her. just make sure you let her know how you feel that you really do want to be friends(MAKE THIS CLEAR) and you probably want to still hang out with her tell her you really care about her and you don't want to see her hurt     if and when you break up with her do it in person. and make sure you stay with her till she knows everything is alright make it very clear to her that youll be willing to talk to her when she isn't feeling good.     best wishes                   , Jdeezy|`|YyFexhd3aa	KILL HER >>>>>YAHHHHHHHHHHHHH{evil lough }|`|UtrgRjTeaa	It depends a little bit on whether she's suicidal because she thinks you're gonna leave, or if she's suicidal for other reasons (family issues, school, etc. etc.) I have dated a couple of women where me breaking up with them made them suicidal, and it sucks. You feel like an ***. But no matter what happens, remember, it is not your fault that she's depressed, and it is not your fault that she's suicidal.    Clearly you care about this girl. A lot. And even though you don't want to go on with her, you don't want to lose her as a friend. So, at least for now, be her friend. Support her, and help her get help. Get her to go to a therapist. Go with her if she's afraid. Talk to her parents if you feel comfortable doing so.    When the time is right, have a calm discussion about the way your feelings have changed.    It will be horribly hard on both of you, but it's the best thing you can do for her.|`|MHQVnqaXaa	yeah DUMBASS she's really sad so you're going to LEAVE HER.|`|7LjzmNzRaa	talk to her about it say that you hate seeing her depressed and maybe that you should just be friends, and if she becomes all sad and cry say no matter what im hear for you|`|eydwwJjDaa	If she's suicidal, you need to find a way to get her helped.

GOOD LUCK!!|`|yNMaCzmqaa	If she is contemplating suicide you need to tell someone-ASAP. If she does, then you will get in trouble- Tell her parents. You can go to the  school counselor- as well.  She need professional help- right away and maybe some medication. At this point you need to be her friend- Tell her she needs help. If she says she does not need help - then reassess the relationship. Tell her you care about her but you cannot be there watching her destroy life and not do anything about it.  If she wants to be with you she needs to get help. Do not take no for an answer. If she is a minor- her parents need to get involved-|`|M5zFc5VXaa	I suggest talking with a close friend of hers, someone she goes to if she can't talk to you about something. Let them know how you feel. Maybe they can help with breaking the news [not doing it for you], and keep an eye on her at the same time. If she[girlfriend] truely has feelings for you, she's only going to want you as a boyfriend.  SO the "still friends" thing might not work out. It's a tough situation, but do what's best for you.

I really do understand how hard this is for you, but it really isnt fair on her, if shes so upset, you may be the best thing in her life, and one day when she realises you didn't love her that way it will really hurt her.    im sorry ): i really hope it works out ok     xxx

kIU3iGwNaa	Wow. I know how you feel. Not so long ago, when I was around 11 to 14 I really liked my english teacher. And when I mean liked, I mean I was totally obsessed. I thought I loved him too but knew deep down that it was ridiculous and that it would never happen. But I remember how it felt then, and that feeling can fool you thinking its a real possibility.    Looking back (I am 16 now) I find it quite funny how I used to think that he was my entire world back then. It's just a phase that some teenage kids go through, esp. girls crushing on older men and people like teachers are ideal because they are caring, smart etc.    It's not nasty or disgusting liking a teacher, in fact it's quite common, you'd be surprised.    It will pass, I assure you. Try to think of things in the long term. You'll be off into college, doing a whole bunch of new stuff and enjoying life.    Give it time, that's all.    :)|`|t0uIgY08aa	your too young to know what love is|`|66tpufsgaa	its just a phase.  a really LONG phase|`|eqLFfXfyaa	This may not be the best way to put this, but how is your relationship with your father? Sounds like you are missing something with him and that this teacher may have represented what was missing in the relationship you either do or don't have with your father, and you're mistaking it for emotional love.    I am just thinking of this because my dad and I don't have a great relationship, and I know I am missing something. It was just a thought so please don't be offended.|`|gxczXgvXaa	Yikes, that's rough...and disgusting.    Um, I suggest staying away from him?|`|fEcNMm05aa	That's highly freekish.

If you havent, you need to.  Try your hardest not to think of him, like try to think of your homework, shopping, whatever works, instead!  Also, like the one person said, try to get interested in other guys your age.  Who do you think is cute? who do you think might like you? Hope this helps!|`|SyUeecsBaa	well find boys you're own aqe . hunn , it's not love , but it's still a feelinq . i've been there and done that but w| my friend's older bro ( he's 21 ) and i eventually qot over it and so can you . i'm 13 about to be 14 so i know where you're cominq from .|`|UP33GlBwaa	I will say two words to you......VERY BAD!  You are just infatuated with him.  We all go through it.  The guy is married with two kids, so get over it.  And why would you think that he would want a young girl like you?   He would only screw up his life completely, so just get over it quick.  Find a nice boy your age to go to dances with and football games.  Just get this idea out of your head because it's never going to happen with him.  And legally, if it did, it's rape for him because you are underage.  Hope this tells you immediately to back off.  Keep repeating this all in your head and believe me, you will get over him.  Stay away from him, too.|`|AA11955868	I doubt just a little that what you're feeling is love, I could see having a big crush on him. Are you at a jr high? You should be heading to high school pretty soon and you'll have little to no contact with him at that point and it will make it much easier to forget about him.    I would focus on boys your own age, yes they're dumb, but ah well, it never really changes. It might be fun to develop a crush on a celebrity? They're always completely unrealistic guilty pleasures, and provided you're mildly sane, they're harmless. I've told my boyfriend on several occasions that if Christian Bale ever offers, I'll tumble him in a second.    If you were to approach your teacher (which would be bad bad bad) you'd be incredibly uncomfortable around him forever since he shot you down (hopefully) and you'd gain nothing. Just imagine your dad as the focus of your crush, and then transfer it onto your teacher. Nothing like a healthy dose of 'ewwwww' to kill a bad case of the crushes.|`|4CM2lylMaa	thats freeakky & nasty|`|a46be6b854cf1fb903b113b530f0029caa	Try to find boys your age.

Make it like a fun vacation and if you like to tag along one of your best or a good friend of yours so you won't get too uncomfortable why not. In case your meeting didn't came out right, at least you still have your other friend to enjoy the rest of the vacation.

zNuZm4K6aa	If you are really this upset by it (which is valid, by the way), then I would not only consider the reception, but also the wedding.  I mean, if you feel you can't enjoy and celebrate what is supposed to the happiest day in your life, you might need to rethink actually marrying this guy.  Ya know, he could have said no to his friends after all.      Talk to him about your feelings & see if you can work it out.  If you can't work it out to where you will be able to enjoy, you might want to postpone til you can get some counseling together.|`|76nTvO4iaa	I'm not going to tell you not to feel hurt over a bunch of strippers.  I don't know what went on, but apparently enough that you feel your relationship has been violated.    Forget skipping the reception - you need to postpone or cancel the wedding until this matter can be worked out with a counselor or clergyperson.    ((hugs))|`|577ba10a2319b430720b5a913b74b862aa	if you're that upset, maybe you should delay the wedding itself.  what's the point in getting married if you don't even want to go to your own reception?  believe me, if he does it now, he'll continue to do it, and it may get worse.  think about it before taking the plunge at this time.|`|f6ab3ae3fee781c3975ea305670f972faa	if this is such a big issue to you then why are you even marrying him?    the fact is you DON'T respect his right to do so because you are punishing him for doing it and making a big show of it by not going to your reception.    It is perfectly fine that you are not happy about him going.  It is perfectly fine if you don't want a man who engages in this sort of behavior.    what is not fine is talking out of both sides of your mouth.      This is either a big issue that shows you have conflicting core values that make you incompatible for the long term and will destroy your marriage  or it's a difference of opinion in how to spend time and you agree to disagree and get on with your lives together.|`|FXCoGD44aa	If you are this upset and don't even want to enjoy your own wedding, then you shouldn't even be having it! Do you really think this is the way to start off your marriage?    Either get over it, or don't go through with the wedding. Post-pone it to another date. Yes, it's possible.|`|26cae2932c19d290ec2e4570f9542e0baa	You can't. It's considered rude to only attend the ceremony. Since you feel this strongly about it and you aren't willing to let anything go, your best bet is to call off the wedding.|`|47af2fda89839c0ec02e273cff59d82daa	wow...call off the wedding.  seriously?      why do you  assume everyone knows he even went to a strip club?  maybe its just the other guys in the bridal party and you that know?      if you cant handle this then why even bother having a wedding?      you say you respect his right to go, but your holding a grudge, which CLEARLY shows you DONT respect it, or any of his decisions....so you need to mature up a bit before you get married    its a reception for YOUR wedding. your one of the guests of honor, you pretty much NEED to go|`|SAgCy83Oaa	If you feel that strongly, you need to stop the wedding right now, let alone the reception.    You invited people to help celebrate what is ostensibly a happy time.  They will be bringing gifts and expecting to see a happy bride.  If you're not going to be happy and you think it's serious enough to insult all those people over some minor piont like this, then you are headed for some real problems in the marriage, when REALLY important issues come up.    If you don't want to go to the reception, why do you want to go to the wedding?  There is something seriously wrong with you, girl.|`|13bf9874413959dbd425a6a84c9b9159aa	dont have a reception thats easy  since everyone who comes wants to CELEBRATE the same thing you should be  or   dont get married  saves divorcing him later|`|8bTder08aa	Cupcake, if you and your fiance are this much on the outs that you're ready to bail on the reception, I think you really need to consider calling the whole thing off.    You say you "respect his right" to do the strip club bachelor party, but you're bearing a grudge about it and are ready to punish him by ditching the reception, presumably leaving him to explain to all and sundry why you aren't there, and to suffer the embarrassment that results.  Wow.  In my book, that's cause for pause:  put the nuptials on hold while you two work this issue, among others, out.  (For reference, a cancelled wedding costs a lot less than a divorce.)    The issue of the bachelor party is something you and your intended should have had worked out months ago.  That you didn't indicates to me that there are probably a whole lot of issues just as important that you two need to talk over before you tie the knot.    Cancel the wedding and clear the air between the two of you, because at this point with this kind of start to your married life, I wouldn't give two cents for the chances of you and your fiance making it to your fifth anniversary.|`|w1necKzYaa	there is not much you can do about feeling not in the mood I would be hurt too! but you cannot excuse yourself without being rude!|`|0056ba0f2ca4852a4f7b389766f314d4aa	Wow, this is so screwed up, I don't even know where to begin.     Don't say that you "respect" his right and know it's "tradition". You are so p*ssed off, you won't even go to your own reception where people are coming to honor YOU! If you felt this way, then you should have made your point clear before the bachelor party. You are punishing him (and everyone else) for his going to a strip club by not showing up to your own reception following your wedding! You want to embarass him by leaving him to explain your absence due to his horrible deed. The only people who should be embarassed at this point are your parents for having a kid who would act this way.     Now you are still planning on not being in a "festive" mood by the time the wedding rolls around? Do you think your fiance is the going to be the only one in the room that actually ever went to a strip club for his bachelor party? You're willing to go through with the wedding but not the reception because you're embarassed?     You need to call this wedding off now. If you are this upset to the point that you cannot bring yourself to your own reception because you're embarassed and hurt, you have no business getting married to the man that you claim made you feel this way. If he's not good enough for you to go to the reception, he's not good enough to marry.     I won't tell you not to feel hurt, but I will tell you that you're making a mountain out of a molehill. From experience (with male family member, a ton of guy friends, and even though female, been to a couple of bachelor parties myself), I can tell you that a majority of the time, the bachelor party is actually more for the best man and the groomsmen than the groom. The best man wants the bragging rights that he threw the most awesome bach party ever, even though the guys went in, had a few drinks, and left. My bf just just went to one and was home by 10:30pm. He said the groom would have loved to have left but felt obligated because his friends were there.     Sorry to be so harsh, but you are way too immature to be getting married. Your way to handle conflict is to not address it in advance,  get mad when something happens you don't agree with, puff up life a big toad and sulk, and let everyone around you know that you're miserable. What's going to happen in your marriage when a REAL crisis happens?    Do yourself and your fiance a favor and drop this wedding. You'll be saving both of you your first divorce.|`|0e0a0f1828f99f87ea3d5e5bc8cbd46daa	I don't get how you would feel "Embarassed" in front of everyone, as anybody who is anybody knows that that's what the grooms do at their bachelor party. They won't even mention it! And no, you don't respect him because you feel mocked. It isn't the best time for you to get married. You need to learn how to trust him first. Sorry but the wedding should be canceled. Save him the pain of a divorce over such nonsense as a silly stripper.|`|RuKK1LYiaa	your being rediculous, he has every right to go out to a strip club just as much as you do since it is tradition if you feel that way about it dont marry him cause all its going to do is cause you and him some drama and you would be showing poor charachter not going to your own reception.|`|3secB3Smaa	go  to your reception. grow up or do not get married and then you don't have to worry about the reception.|`|IbhX8kHxaa	I'm sorry this happened to you. Yes, it's a tradition but I would feel hurt too if my fiance did that. Talk to him and express your feelings and let him know that he needs to respect you, but please don't let that keep you from enjoying the happiest day of your life! You only get married once, so don't miss it for the world. Hope things work out for you!|`|CI4oAV0oaa	It is your wedding reception, you should feel hurt but if anyone should feel embarrassed, it is your soon-to-be husband.

Pretty lousy way to start out a new life.|`|by9KuBizaa	If you are not in a festive mood about your wedding, then consider the wedding should be cancelled.      You said you respect his right to go to a strip club.  Obviously you have problems with it and are now letting it ruin your wedding day.      Perhaps you should lighten up a bit, hold your head up high and remind yourself that your fiance went to a strip club ONE LAST TIME BEFORE he gets married to you!!!    I don't understand how that embarasses you?|`|UUQXNhMtaa	Then maybe you should rethink getting married at all, sounds like you might not be mature enough yet. Wake up a strip club is better than a hooker. How silly.|`|GzvLG6x5aa	You can feel hurt over the strippers of course, but it's pretty childish to not turn up to the reception. If you feel so strongly about it, should you be getting married at all?  Going through with the ceremony & then not going to the reception because you are sulking over the strip club thing is an appalling way to start a marriage.   You need to make a tough decision - whether to marry the guy or not; or to behave like a child - and then stick with that decision.
zQ0mUDBUaa	the best way to deal with a bully and to PISS THEN THE HELL OFF is by saying and doing nothing.

nujen4dmaa	I must admit, that diamonds are and always will be my first love.  But if you are looking for gemstones please consider the following vendors.  They are well known in their field and are reputable.    http://www.palagems.com  (you will need a jeweller to complete the transaction).  http://cherrypicked.com  http://thenaturalsapphirecompany.com  http://www.ajsgems.com  http://www.preciousgemstones.com  http://www.whitesgems  http://www.winkjones.com    Buying gemstones is a little more tricky than buying diamonds. You will have to decide whether you want a certified or uncertified stone. Whether you are willing to accept a stone that has had any enhancements.  In particular heat treatment.    What mine the gemstone comes from will also affect the price.    Please be careful as there are many less than morally upright vendors out there.  It is very easy to be cheated.  There are now so many known non-accepted treatments that are not obvious to the novice.|`|47af2fda89839c0ec02e273cff59d82daa	anywhere! seriously, if they sell jewelery, go there and check it out    tell them that you are looking for an engagement ring, but your not into diamonds, and see what they have to offer.     my friends brother's fiance is into pearls, and he got her THE most georgous ring with a pearl where you would ordinarly expect a diamond.  i dont even like pearls and i think this ring is pretty,  they got it at rogars and hollands.        but yeah, seriously, go scope out any store that sells jewlery, it can have any stones you want.  all that matters about engagment rings is that you two know what it means and are excited about your future together|`|OIJ3JBkSaa	ah - people after my own heart - i don't care for diamonds - they are sterile and cold looking with no life to them but give me a gemstone with color and i'm in heaven!  every jewelery counter in every dept. store will have beautiful gemstone rings.  sapphires, emeralds, garnets, opals, amethysts, rubies, pearls. consider looking at your birthstone for your engagement ring or perhaps both your birthstone and your fiance's birthstone - that would make a beautiful ring that is uniquely yours - different from anyone elses!  congrats on your engagement and happy wedding!|`|26cae2932c19d290ec2e4570f9542e0baa	Most jewelry stores sell colored gemstone rings.|`|AW1dCzH0aa	www.angara.com    You can design your own non diamond ring.

Geez...just end it your marriege...THEN think about finding someone else...Do things the right way!|`|c2dfad4dc1f663f9f98d8667a84e7f6daa	Sorry but your justification " My marriage is not good or I wouldn't have cheated in the first place" doesn't cut it. You should have left before you cheated. I think your friends will think you're a skank.|`|AXbdNdPzaa	Hello!!!  He told you he is going to ask his gf to marry him.  Doesn't that tell you something?  It should.|`|CCFhjtNBaa	What makes you think this friend won't cheat on you if you got together? you and your husband have problems, this friend and his g/f dont.|`|c5UAa65qaa	I think he's understandably having a hard time moving past the connection you two built up, but I don't think it's productive for you to speculate how difficult.  For your friend's sake and the sake of his resolution to repair his own relationship, distance yourself and focus on doing what you need to do to in terms of your marriage.|`|an1EMiFkaa	I have kinda been in this situation. Except we never crossed that line. Close but stopped it before it happened. He actually told me that he had been in love with me since we were 15 and now he sees how unhappy I am and decided to do something. It felt nice, a little weird, but nice. He would even do things in front of hubby that I considered risky but because he knew nothing about it didnt even seem to care.     My advice to you is, move on. Your friend obviously wants to try and make this relationship he has works and was just feeling like he needed to get something out of his system before he decided to settle down for good. But if you truly have feelings for him, wait it out...divorce rates are 50% now a days and if he cheated once...he will do it again.|`|2keIEMFUaa	You should feel real dirty because he just wanted to how you were in bed and that's it.  He just used you good.  Just that simple|`|GfYUvnudaa	sorry hun,you really don`t love your husband like that.  Mildred sent me|`|EJtIb3fCaa	He's interested but that doesn't mean in love of you or any other kind of RESPECTFUL interest in you, he knows your are available, weak and probably desperate. Whether he sees you in this way consciously or not, those are the only motives that make him call you or text you.  You know he is interested (human!) the question would be if you are interested on hurting your husband and your friend's girlfriend and of course, end up really bad to everyone's eyes.  Good luck.|`|zHwlGhIAaa	he just scored his best firiend's wife- the stuff that Jerry Springer shows are made of.

He says no and pushes you away, but keep talking to you.  What happens is you are placed off center emotionally and so experience all these emotions.  He looks like the good guy trying to do the right thing, but if he fails he has you between the sheets whenever he wants you.  You are his sexual back up.|`|3iNobwVraa	Why would you think our words would be more relevant to the situation than his?!  He already told you what he felt/thought/wanted.  If you can't deal with it, tell him that and start getting some distance.  You should have known this was a possibility, so deal with it without playing victim, or blaming.  It may be sad because it sounds like you might lose your friend, but, apparently sometimes that is necessary.

I guess you'll have to hope he believes you. DID you cheat?|`|NMihu3kgaa	It could be that he might be feeling guilty for something and he is trying to turn the table on you.... Or someone could have lied to him. Ask him where he gets this info from and if he hesitates or gives you a ridiculous answer you know that something is up. If i were you i would confront him and ask him what his deal is. Does he have any reason to believe that you could have done something with the other guy? And if that was the case than why didnt he want to go with you?! i would think if he feels like you might have something going on with another guy that he might be after you 24-7 spying on you. Something smells fishy... Best of wishes!|`|e7f7b9508f28f00c8e34cd692587ca8caa	maybe he was with someone while u was gone on the trip|`|iZbgUtxcaa	He cheated when you were gone.

A guy SHOULD NOT come between you and your friends .. EVER.    simply see where things go for you and the guy and make a pact with your friend saying something like " from now on tell me who you like and we will not date who the other likes"  or something like that.     She may have her feelings hurt now, but reassure her you meant nothing on your friendship by seeing the fellow she likes.  Simply explain to her you did not know.  She'll either believe you and get over it or hold it over your head... in that  case, maybe she isn't worth your friendship.

We dated for 16 months and were engaged for 13 months, so all together, 29 months (2 years, 5 months).

kdSuwt8paa	It would be very difficult to change the behaviour patterns of a whole family.   I think your idea of moving is possibly the best option.   You do not have to stay around for all that abuse.   Mind you I think it would be a much better idea if you could defuse the situation by having nothing to do with them.   If your mother could just say NO to the command to visit and while I don't want to join the band of people accusing her, she should have done so long ago.    I am not hopeful that she will be able to do it now.   So go away and make a peaceful life for yourself.|`|q0A4enABaa	I started by ignoring my family. and when asked why I was an asshole, I just simply replied that I am not getting caught up in everyones business and they should stay the hell out of mine!|`|cGbTJobeaa	The way you get around it is you give your extended family 2 choices...either they stop insulting you, or you leave whatever function that you are at with them.  You have control in how you allow yourself to be treated. I am giving you permission to set limits.  (Isn't that so nice of me).    Here's a little example:    Gma:  Sally's an idiot freeloader.  Sally:  Grandma, you have to stop using derogatory terms to describe me.  I don't like it.  You can either stop insulting me, or I will leave. (and then you stare her down)  Gma:  It's the truth.  You are a freeloading moocher.  Sally:  Bye!  *packs up purse and jacket and starts to leave the house*  Gma: *jaw drops* Wait! Come back.  Sally:  I'll stay only if you stop insulting me.  Gma: *long pause*  OK.    Sally:  How about them Cubs?    For people who are like this, I usually only have to do this once or twice before they realize that I am not going to be some patsy who takes their abuse. And if they want to insult me....I don't have to be around to hear it. I'll leave!    The next time they attempt to choke or slap you, just go out to the car or somewhere nearby and call 911.  Have the police send over a cop.  Unless your family are complete morons, do you know how many times you have to do that for them to get the message to quit physicaly attacking you?  Once.      And if they try throwing that in your face subsequently, all you have to do is calmly say "so you're mad at me because So-and-So was physically assaulting me??? Are you justifying violence? Seriously??? So-and-So is the one you should be angry with."  And if they keep it up; walk away. I'm still giving you permission not to have to listen to their crap.    As for grandma going through your room; put a lock on your door.  A new door knob is fairly inexpensive to buy at Home Depot.  They're easy to install too. If I can put on a new door knob, you can too.

AA11088653	All in all you need to talk to both of them.  You know them better than I do - so you need to be the judge of whether talking to them individually or together.  I understand how frusterating this can be for you - but the key to handling this is patience.  If you cant handle being around them until you talk to them and tell them exactly how you feel - then remove yourself from the situation, if you can.  You have the power to handle this and you are more than capable to talk with both of them.      You need to inform them of how you feel about them and their behavior.  Emphasize that you want to remain friends with both of them (if you do) but that you cannot handle being around them if they act the way they do.  I don't want to sound like you HAVE to do any of this...because in reality you don't have to do any of what I suggest if you don't want.      You don't want to get in the middle by telling her about all of his wrongdoings because then you become the bad person to him - but you don't want to necessarily let them fly.  Talk to him and reinforce the fact that he should direct his attention towards her if he is truely wanting to be with her.  Otherwise he needs to sit down with her and have a really big discussion.      As a last resort (because this is the hardest and usually hurts the most), you have the option of completely cutting both of them out of your life.  It hurts because you know them really well and don't want to let go, but you can't handle getting hurt much more by this.  It isn't fair for you to be hurt by their behavior and it certainly isn't your position to need to have to deal with this.  You have the ability to deal with this - and you can do it.  It might sting a little, but in the end it will be the best way to handle this.|`|5f567556e3a40a553c972c5c2f0bdbf4aa	Just tell him how you feel about him, and hopfuly he like you back and he'll dump his fg|`|0ee4f2f0d632d2585950da9db6ba7d74aa	First, be alone and then give him a dazzling kiss.

Surfing the net is the best pastime one can ever develop, as internet has the most knowledge, a surfer will never have to wait for a answer. The vast knowledge of cyber world is nothing as compared to the cyber society that it gives. Internet is a community but so vast that we need a place to make conversation easy. What more can be better than a chat room for this purpose, well a chat room and a message board along with a forum is the best combination really. I was actually looking for a place where we can find all these things with a profile and photo brouse option. Finally I got this site, this place is a very nice community where we can share every thing online. And also about the leader board, I must tell it is great. The thought of the leader board is unique, as not to many people has thought about this thing. And the method of getting the leader is very different and one must check out this site once. The cyber culture is growing, and it is about time that we find our club and that to a very different club, which is not a part of any big website house like the yahoo and google. This site am talking about has every thing that a cyber surfer ever wants. This is the website address, http://www.friendscyberclub.com/ Features of this site is: 1) chatting 2) view profiles and photos 3) upload your photos and make a cool profile. 4) your message board 5) forum 6) See your name on the leader board. There are also many more features available in the site, free to join.

You have to look in a different spot and look for different kinds of people.  There are a lot of great guys out there!  I have met many of them here at answers.  They are caring and wonderful people, just not into the bars and dance clubs.  They are also looking for a woman who will see the inner beauty in each person and not get caught up in the physical beauty things.  Look inside the people you meet.  See the honorable men in there.  They are all around us.|`|0378a09821c9e9134aca7d02051c8e43aa	**** YOU.|`|906ba0a05dd822f6f50936abe5707ecaaa	yea its call your dreams lol jp, idk|`|0ee4f2f0d632d2585950da9db6ba7d74aa	... i dunno... oh I know! tell her to go to the Good Guys.

8a52951afc75a13a05b9e37bcf73dd51aa	Well, every race will have taller people than others but I do think it's the Northern Chinese who are taller than the Southern. I don't quite know why this would have become this way but in Northern China, it has harsher winters and milder summers than the south so they are not big farmers, mostly herders, I believe. As for the South, they grow a lot of rice because it's ideal weather for it there. The kinds of physical activity depending on the region could possibly have affected the height. I find that a lot of my Mandarin friends(the dominant language of the North) are 5'6"-6'0" while my Cantonese friends (the dominant language of the South) are 5'0"-5'5". I myself am Southern Chinese and stand at 5'2 1/2". This is not to be taken as a racist statement but the reason why Westerners often view the Chinese as short is probably because most of the Chinese immigrants to the West were from the Southern provinces of China.|`|c2b02e9ecd23f132f51e1510e98b8b8faa	its nature|`|1e76d477419381a91e98905355cab8dfaa	i noticed the same thing. they are such a beautiful race.|`|40118fb4ac7a3bab2255b3a5541b8a9baa	Same thing for other races.

O anus  composto por msculos muito potentes que tm a capacidade de realizar movimentos de contra??o fortssimos, isso lhe proporciona a capacidade de estar sempre bem apertadinho, a produ??o desses movimentos  que proporciona o prazer tanto no homem quanto na mulher. N?o se pode esquecer que essa prtica provoca o rompimento de muitos capilares, fato este que provoca sangramentos e muito deconforto pra a mulher.  Alguns homens gostam de ter a sensa??o de domina??o, de poder, outros acham que  uma forma que a mulher tem de demonstrar amor, cumplicidade, confian?a, em fim. Outros adoram ver as mulheres sentindo muitas dores, gostam de ter a sensa??o de que realmente deixaram sua marca, s?o realmente animais, fato este que ao meu ver n?o  legal, pois o sexo tem como objetivo proporcionmar prazer, ser agradve, gostoso, n?o doloroso, sacrificante, irritante, apesar de algumas mulhres tambm sentirem muito prazer ao serem penetradas com violncia. Tm mulheres que adoram sentir dor.  Eu tive uma namorada h 6 anos atrs que tinha o maior prazer em sentir dores, amava ser comida de forma animal, pedia pra ser penetrada de forma brusca, gostava de receber uns tapinhas n?o muito comuns na hora "H", ah, s se sentia realmente saciada quando estava totalmente ardida, ela me dizia que somente assim ela tinha a real sensa??o de ter sido comida. Era uma loucura!  Como te falei, eu particularmente acho que  possvel dar prazer  minha parceira praticando sexo anal, gosto de v-la se deliciando, mas para isso usa-se lubrificante, a penetra??o tem que ser de forma lenta e carinhosa, ela tem que estar bastante excitada realmente afim. Gosto de dar prazer, e as mulheres que realmente gostam de fazer sexo anal bem gostoso.  Digam a se con carinho n?o  mais delicdioso pra ambos?  Voc deveria experimentar,  muito bom, pra quem sabe fazer  claro. Tente, mas fa?a com jeitinho e se sentir uma mulher feliz e realizada.  Um timo dia e um beijo minha linda!|`|d92234a45c711d2459884038576270e5aa	acho que o anus deve ser mais apertadinho, e os homens adoram coisas apertadinho, ;)|`|c18ae673d24150194495df3e53a53e58aa	porque  mais apertado, sendo assim mais gostoso.|`|fcc466eb7a2bd9c36e8c13b88da3960aaa	Bem, porque o homem sente-se como dominador e pelo fato de que fazer sexo anal  um pouco difcil, j que para muitas mulheres  um sexo dolorido ou incomodo, da quando ele est fazendo sexo com alguma mulher ele sempre pedir para ter sexo anal e se ela consentir estar levando o homem a loucura, j que tambm o brasileiro  doido por bundas.OK!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|553e64a615dbbaf823a7f15801b9e285aa	Ele imagina que a mulher quer e tem vergonha de pedir, ent?o ele toma a iniciativa.

Love is what endures.|`|01a44aa226b9f29630d12b882cd3b425aa	sex is important in a marriage, but not everything. i'd suggest talking to your spouse about the lackluster and maybe even go to a marriage counselor.  being open and willing to talk about it is the first step. and you have to be very careful/tactful because if you say the wrong thing it could cause more harm than good. perhaps get a book on different positions you could try or on "how to have better sex." it's a start...|`|a4cf1b0a9f8be96da2b38908ddbed266aa	Yes if you both love and care each other.

Os ltimos estudos dizem que o gene para isso  semelhante ao do gene para definir se algum  destro ou canhoto. Ou seja, se vc for canhoto e tentar escrever com a m?o direita, sentir dificuldade e n?o ficar confortvel, mesmo que "aprenda" a escrever com a m?o com a qual vc tem menos habilidade. Resumindo, vc ser infeliz se agir contra a sua natureza.  Quanto a casar e ter filhos, vc pode fazer isso, existem vrios modelos de famlia hoje em dia, m?es solteiras, pais solteiros, filhos de pais separados que se juntam a outras famlias dos novos namorados dos pais, pais estreis que adotam crian?as ou fazem insemina??o, e famlias homossexuais. Vc e o seu futuro namorado podem provar na justi?a que s?o companheiros e receberem quase todos os direitos legais de um casal hetero normal. Depois podem alugar uma barriga com um vulo fecundado por um de vcs, podem adotar uma crian?a, podem combinar algo com algum casal de mulheres, etc.  Para tudo nessa vida tem jeito, s n?o tente mudar sua essncia, porque a vida  sua e ningum tem nada a ver com isso, nem vc precisa desposar uma mulher para provar algo para a sociedade e depois tornar essa mulher e seus filhos pessoas infelizes porque vc tambm estar infeliz e n?o sentir tes?o por ela nem passar uma imagem de satisfa??o para seus filhos.

cd4facfabbe9f3181d3eb2aba5693595aa	Arrogance comes from a "need" to feel superior to others. Arrogant people have an inner low self esteem in them selves and have to use the lowering of others as a crutch to raise themselves.    The intellectually arrogant (example professors) though having lots of education feel in them selves that they are not really that smart. They have just read more books and their IQ is ordinary. They then must go out to prove to others that they are superior. Surrounding  themselves with people they have fooled and the ignorant (students in the case of Professors).  The arrogant sports figure knows he is there only because of some accidental gene so he could hit a ball or knock down things. Everyone tells him he is the greatest but he knows its not true and any injury can bring him down. During cave man times this would be real important but in real life, today, this is meaningless. Thus he must inflate his importance by putting others beneath him.  The arrogant movie star is surrounded by people who tell them they are the greatest. Truth be known they know in them selves that it was only by accident that they are where they are. They saw around them so many others just like them struggling to make it. People they considered more talented than they were yet they succeeded and the others didn`t. In order to quiet that inner voice telling them they don`t deserve it, they must become arrogant.    The rich arrogant, again, knows they don`t deserve it. Thus must protect themself by taking a position above criticism.    They live in fear that some day someone will come along and say, "Hey! you are just ordinary, there is nothing special about YOU."    Hope that helped.

kcolnJaVaa	Well one thing get over him and go on with your life . And yes give him photos of the kids . No don't. Sorry i should say sale the photos to him and triple the price if he wont's photos that bad he will pay for them . But you have to remember he is still the kids father no matter how much of your life he took away . Also if the kids are the special part of your life it took the two of you to create that unless you got pregnant by another but all in all don't be the bad guy in front of your kids|`|68be9523a93b37cc41e28bb15f9ab833aa	YOU do not have to give him any photos, if he still talks to your kids and he asks them for photos, let THEM give him the photos. dont worry yourself about it.|`|66fc23a729accc45212c6a41009b6b2daa	i think you schold have picture for the kids because than schold know there father  i think is good thing|`|a38edbb20181a12c514b582a105edbbfaa	If these are recent photos, they're your keepsakes. He can take his own photos.     If older photos, when you two were together, then you should give him copies.    This is just my opinion. Someone will follow saying I'm flat wrong. I usually am wrong.|`|e9be038ee1aa464073677c3e4d10060faa	They are his children too. If it were not for him you would not have them. Give him some photos.|`|44b146f8ce81042675c198778b0a4dcdaa	Yes, they are his kids too,  my husband was heart broken when his ex never send pictures to him.  That's just down right mean,|`|E0Ib8dv7aa	He should get his childrens' photos, however if they are school pictures, he should pay for half!|`|o8Fqyqpfaa	You should give him pics and maybe a little time with your kids because stats say that kids that are likely to drop out of school, join gangs, or even do drugs never spend time with there fathers.
0370fd46af40ff0a67a8182e1d0051a2aa	Yes, the rise in power for women as changed the family life greatly and I think for the better.  The rise is psychology has also changed much of the way children are raised, there is much less insecurity and abnormality in how we exist.|`|AA12084908	I think modernization has brought people apart.

AA11284736	First of all, YOU need to take charge because it seems like you're waiting for him to do so.  Secondly, you 2 haven't been together long enough to start talking about a family! He (your boyfriend) sounds really immature and lazy. He is not going to listen or provide any kind of support for the possible child you're carrying. He'll probably just jump from job to job or remain unemployed, expecting YOU to do everything. I say dump his ***, if you are pregnant with his kid raise him on your own (yes, it is possible). You don't need to raise the kid in that kind of deceitful environment. You sound smart enough, so follow through on your goals. As for the hickeys, next time he does it, make him a bigger one-see how HE likes it. It looks skanky.|`|e6e8c013e0bcb16848fa8f618530a07daa	You've been dating him for less than a month and you're talking about having kids & a future AND YOU MAY BE PREGNANT!!!!!   Do you live in a trailor park?  Is your goal in life to be on the Jerry Springer show?    Date for a year before making any life decisions together and for the love of God don't get pregnant (you know that can be avoided right?).|`|AA10749419	Girl...pray. Pray that you are not pregnant...then dump him. Sounds like he is no good. Actually, even if you are pregnant, dump him anyway. You don't need to keep a unstable relationship just because of a child. It never works out. Good Luck with everything.|`|BPJLHKRJaa	yes you should get out of that relationship. that is bad. I mean I just turned 18 yesterday but I was kicked outa my dads this past summer. ben living with my BF.. well my past growing up really sucked.and we could never afford stuff or pay bills and stuff... and I dont wanna ever be stuck like that again. I work at Subway but I make ends meet.. but I think you should honestly get rid of this guy.. it would be bad if you was pregnant and couldnt have the daddy around but you gotta do whats best for you and possibly that baby.. he SHOULD respect you but doesnt.. that is a BIG sign you should get rid of that Bas tard.. I wish u good luck, and be careful.. Just get away from him please. You dont wanna end up on welfare or anything|`|7b35c4f866e669c917ad1a0f830b5c86aa	He's immature...  It's really your decision..  I mean, it seems like he really doesnt know  what he's getting himself into, and probably  is planning on not doing that much to help you.    Really sorry, good luck!|`|1FpxPiWpaa	your man is wayyy to into you.. i dont think you should be in that kind of environment, he doesnt sound mature enough to even have a kid and getting a career should be the first thing on his mind to help support a child. you need to tell him how its gonna be and tell him how you feel. and about the hickey thing.. i dont know what to tell you.. i dont know if you should be leaving him for all those reasons if you are pregnant with his baby, it takes alot to take care of a child.. but if you have your support and the ability leave him. you dont want you children turning out like a low-life like him.|`|AA10213523	I knew a guy like that. His name isn't Kevin, is it? Anyways, get rid of him. I was in the same situation where I thought I was prego after the first time of having sex. After I made him put a condom on, he later took it off during sex (I didn't know). I thought i was prego. I also told him no hickeys he also did.    What you should do is take a pregnancy test. Sometimes they are free at clinics. Leave him either way if you are pregnant or not. If you are pregnant and want to have the child, then get his *** for child support. Maybe that will teach him a lesson.|`|6cHKFvctaa	i would dump him|`|nbLGEeC4aa	seems like you are very unhappy with that guy, maybe you should just leave him and find another man who cares about you and listen to things that you said|`|79d7e927c8e51767be9c0f3a4a059085aa	Dump his *** !! Turn in his family to SSI while you're at it,  think about an abortion too !|`|do6MOo4Kaa	1) stop having sex with people you just met, 2)hope that you are not prego, 3)run run run far away from this loser.|`|3U6Wdg9Laa	dump him

Excusez moi, mais il y a un passage dnas votre texte qui me choque : "il refuse de se convertir". Pourquoi voudriez-vous qu'il le fasse ? lorsque vous l'avez connu, que vous l'avez aim, peu importait les religions. Alors pourquoi y penser maintenant ? il me semble qu'il aurait fallu vous poser ce type de question au dbut, surtout si pour vous cel est plus important que vos sentiments. Pourquoi un tel gachis ? et pourquoi ne serait-ce pas vous qui changeriez de religion ? pourquoi devrait-il obligatoirement suivre la v?tre ?  Vous ne voulez pas changer pour ne pas vous mettre votre famille  dos ? il a peut-tre les mmes raisons que vous pour ne pas vouloir changer. Alors, vous avez deux solutions : soit vous sparer et rester amis. Soit, vous conservez chacun votre religion, mais alors l, bonjour les problmes, surtout si vous avez un enfant (prnom, baptme, etc...). Que faire ? en effet, c'est un vritable dilme. Il faut absolument en parler tous les 2. Qu'il en parle  un prtre et vous  un imam. Qu'est ce que la religion ? si ce n'est qu'une interprtation diffrente de la part des hommes ? et qui plus est crite par les hommes...Je vous souhaite bien du courage pour affronter vos familles, car je pense que le plus gros problme sera l. Bon courage|`|f726483d381aff278ebb860e895ae763aa	slt  vraiment t'as de la chance comme mme c'est un chretient ca veut dire il est croyant peut etre avec le temps un de vous deux va changer ses ides (pas toi bien sur tu sais moi ausi je suis mosulmane). j'ai la mme situation que toi sauf que moi c'est un ath et on plus il veux m'epouser et je sais pas koi faire c'est mon premier amour et le dernier , et si je pouvais pas me marier avec ce mec je crois que je vais laisser tomb tout ?a et de penser juste  ma carriere et ne jamais penser au mariage car je pense pas que je pourrais trouver qqun comme lui.  si tu l'aime vraiment et lui aussi t'aime vous allez trouver une solution pour eviter la sparation car vraiment c'est trop dure.|`|669982e16683fd1a6a4e3ecfb2bcadf9aa	Ben il a bien raison !

Je crois que c'est important que tu rflchisses  ce qui compte le plus pour toi : l'homme que tu aimes ou ta religion (ou foi)???    Je pense perso que lui ne peut pas te demander de te convertir  sa religion et que de ton cot, tu ne peux pas non plus le lui demander!!     Attention je ne te dis pas que quand on na?t dans une famille croyante/pratiquante on ne doit pas abandonner sa religion.  Mais je trouve que la religion a souvent mis  mal des relations amoureuses comme la tienne.   Alors si tu es sure que pour toi ta religion est plus qu'une religion, je veux dire si c une vrai foi une vrai conviction personnelle alors garde la mais dis toi que ton ami c certainement pareil...  Respecte ses choix ! Mais c'est hyper important que vous en discussiez ensemble!!!!!!!!    Rflchis  ne pas tourner le dos  ce qui compte pour toi !  Et peut tre que tu n'auras pas de choix a faire, parce que tu pourras vivre pleinement les deux, mme si je pense que ?a peut tre compliqu.  Bon courage|`|a3bfb3b2d94db8b848308e17c3845f7baa	Lilisky,    Ton histoire n'est pas la premire et pas la dernire ! Je n'ai jamais connu cette situation donc je ne vais pas pouvoir te conseiller avec mon exprience.    Mais je ne te dirais qu'une seule chose : l'amour est plus fort que tout. L'amour est plus fort que les religions, les nationalits, les races, les diffrences...    Donc si tu crois vraiment que c le bon, franchit la barrire des diffrences ! Et dans ce cas l, si les deux familles sont tolrantes alors tout se passera bien. Dans le cas contraire, et bien, aimez vous le plus longtemps possible !  Surtout, fais avec cette diffrence, n'essaie pas de l'obliger  se convertir et ne te convertie pas. Tu risquerai je pense, de perdre un peu de ton identit quelque part...  Vous pouvez vivre comme ?a, avec 2 religions diffrentes, pourquoi pas ?    Donc pour rpondre  ta question, continue  rester avec l'homme que tu aimes. Le plus longtemps possible.  Et soyez heureux !! Bon courage et bonne continuation !  Byebye !! ;-D|`|334a82d2273643336b1ccea4b1e1a94daa	Honnetement, pense tu que ca vaille la peine que tu poses une question pareille ?    Tu sembles borne sur les concepts de religion et tout ca, libre a toi, chacun ses preferences et ses croyances, mais sincerement pose toi ces questions:     Si je l'aime vraiment, ai-je le droit de vouloir qu'il change se religion (religion de tous ses ancetres tout comme pour toi, je precise)      ou encore: Si les roles etaient inverss, aurait-il lui le droit d'oser me demander de changer ma religion ?    Et puis sincerement, pense tu que ca soit si important que ca. Les couples ne doivent pas se former d'apres la race, la couleur, la langue ou la religion des deux partenaires. Une seule chose les unit: l'amour    Et l'amour n'a jamais empech de pratiquer chacun sa religion de maniere autonome.    N'aurait-tu pas plutot peur des reactions de ton entourage quand ils apprendront que ton ami est chrtien ?    Je me poserais des questions si j'etais toi.

When i was in my late teens, i met a terrific guy who said to look him up when I aged 15 years, that way we would have something to talk about.    My husband and I started dating when i turned 21.  For about six months, I felt like a show dog on the circuit.  He is 10 years older than I am and he LOVED it that I was 10-25 years younger than his friends wives.  He loved the attention that I brought him.  Shallow yes.  He soon realized that I had a brain in my head and he LOVED it that these women 10-25 years older than I got along just fine and that I could handle my own in conversations, even though I had nowhere near the life experiences that they had.  Now that I am 30, some of these women have become my best friends and i have learned from their mistakes........and he still has a hot wife, while he is middle aged.

J'y ai souvent rflchi car pour ma part j'ai pas mal d'exprience. Et je me rend compte que plus une femme connait l'amour mieux c'est et que souvent la premire exprience d'une femme est douloureuse et rate. Je crois que c'est souhaitable pour tout le monde d'avoir connu l'amour et le sexe, au moins un peu avant de rencontrer son grand amour.    Perso je crois que plus on a aim, plus c'est russi. Alors aujourd'hui mon exprience me permet de dire si j'aime plus ou moins la personne avec laquelle je suis.    Je ne vois qu'un exemple, trouver la bonne, celle qui fait battre son coeur et tre vierge tous les deux alors dans ce cas ce serait peut etre sympa de pouvoir tout dcouvrir ensemble. J'y ai pens parfois avec la fille que j'aime aujourd'hui.     L'amour, le sexe c'est l'une des plus belles choses que nous a donn la vie. Je suis  fond dans le grand amour et dans la fidlit mais je ne trouve rien de plus stupide que de vouloir se prserver pour quelqu'un.  Le sexe c'est le rvlateur de l'amour et attendre le mariage pour se rendre compte que son mari ou sa femme ne vous fait rien ressentir c'est dbile.   Beaucoup de filles font d'normes erreurs  cause de leur romantisme et de leur cot fleur bleue mais  toutes celles qui me liront, exprimentez l'amour, jaugez le, faites en le tour ! Il n'y a que comme cel qu'on trouve le grand amour.|`|273c7ea8a8dceb4b547ca58bc29943c2aa	il y a des hommes qui sont capables de quitter une femme qu'ils aimes si elle n'est pas vierge !|`|58d391b25d9a867566b445a64218e843aa	juste une question, pour repondre a ta question  si les femmes doivent rester vierges, avec qui les hommes couchent ils avant?|`|iYVh72Nuaa	Peut importe je ne regarde pas cela , mais son coeur avant , le reste est anodin|`|f4d7634a21d918f4faf321f206c4fd0daa	J'ai pas compris toute ta question, mais moi perso ?a me fouterait un peu le jetons...je peux comprendre que ce soit excitant ou bon pour l'go d'un mec mais moi j'aurais du mal  prendre cette responsabilit.

Donc moi moyennement|`|19c9a655639ba01878790a88ac540e36aa	je pense qu'il s'agit d'une sorte d'emprise que les hommes aiment avoir sur les femmes, du genre "je suis le premier, elle est  moi".  mais je ne pense pas qu'ils soient tous comme cela, beaucoup ont d'autres choses plus seine en tte, comme de pouvoir vraiment partager du plaisir et ce n'est pas avec une vierge qu'ils y arriveront tout de suite.|`|DONZCxtVaa	oui on trouve des gens de ce genre, mais franchement est ce que tu pense que ses gens sont eux mmes vierges? je pense pa, alors pourquoi on demende ce qu'on a perdu dja? je souhaite que cet question ne te procup pa trop car c'est banal de penser a ?a, moi, je pense pa a ca, ce que l'homme cherche c'est de l'amour et point final( biensur c mon point d vue), c'est pa bcp important les aparances , le plus important c'est l'intrieur, alors regard toi bien et je pense que lorsqu tu trouvera klk'1 qui t'aime , il va pa penser a ca.|`|gwf9ngD4aa	c'est un grand problme pour la jeunesse dans les pays arabes .

D'autre part, mme si on n'est plus vierge, on a toujours une premire fois avec un homme et dans la relation actuelle c'est cette premire fois qui prime et pas la toute premire fois de ta vie...    Enfin et pour rpondre clairement a la question, je crois que ce qui gne le plus les hommes avec une femme non vierge c'est qu'ils ont peur d'tre compare, qu'on est connu mieux avant eux... Mais si l'amour est au rendez-vous du sexe alors de toute fa?on ?a ne peut tre qu'un moment unique.|`|si6svaReaa	je vois pas l'intrt de la virginit|`|645da791a07e16987148c95ba7ac99f7aa	qu'elle soit vierge ou pas c pas un probleme ...l'essentiel c qu'on s'aime et/ou qu'on s'entende|`|a22d141a44ca6cb983fca3ef41082890aa	et les femmes peuvent elles aussi exiger des hommes vierges?|`|oCBjX32taa	moi j'aime bien.; pourquoi ca ?|`|d1bd64ee9241f80a04e3c98758d6b583aa	Pas  forcment|`|e3c23667a21d29145c1e7e19f4091a28aa	Personnellement, je m'en branle (si j'ose dire).

oHcF2u28aa	I think they both should go to counseling.  The first time someone hits you may not be the last.  This could be the beginning of a cycle of abuse.  Your friend should at least go to the local Domestic Violence office and talk with them about this and learn all she can about the domestic abuse cycles.|`|0f25d61013d6ca4f683d2efb01edec8daa	How long have they been married? He needs to go to counseling or anger management immediately. I think that marriage is forever, and people are capable of changing if they really want to. But that is key. He should be devastated by what he did. If he thinks its over with an apology - she needs to throw down the ultimatum. Counseling or I'm gone. Period. She doesn't deserve that and her children DEFINTELY don't need to see or experience abuse of any sort... it will affect them for the rest of their lives.

Just say, your sexuality is your business, I'm glad you're exploring it, but I'm tired of hearing about it. Can we talk about other things?    I say that to my straight friends who sleep around constantly and then complain to me later about how they dont' have serious relationships. :-) It's not a gay/straight/bi issue, it's a using-other-people-and-you're-sick-of-he... issue.    You're allowed to tell someone that you just don't care to hear kiss and tell details.    It's possible he thinks all of this talk is flirting with you. Nip it in the bud, now.|`|5Xx8Cumjaa	What part are you upset about? The fact he wish you had a penis or the fact that you think he uses people.

If they open their legs and have sex with him and he is not raping them, he is not using them, they have let him.  Its none of his business either if you are not a sexual person, tell him to stop watching Sex in the City and dont go to any sex shops with him. Careful he doesnt put any moves on you, he just might eventually. You dont want to catch anything because he is going to if he hasnt already.|`|vLeyZwn2aa	I dont think he really did anything to u.

My only problem is that he should use condoms....abortions aren't contraception, and don't guard against std's.  You should be honoured that he loves you enough to talk openly and honestly  with you.  if it's too  much for you to cope with, then let him know, but you may be erceived as being judgemental, and lose a good friend in the process......

Pero te aseguro que para mi todos son iguales, incluso a todos les doy el mismo trato y mas de un@ se queda parado,porque normal  para algunas personas no lo es, pero para mi SI, soy as y as funciono incluso me ha ido muy bien, para mi son personas y tienen derecho al mismo trato sea quien sea a mi en este aspecto me la da, NO CAMBIO!!!

Muy por el contrario sabes que el que adquiere determinado nivel se olvida de peque?os detalles. Yo conozco muchas personas y la verdad por menos cosas que tengan, son muy buenas personas, sus historias de vidas son muy ricas, las situaciones que han vivido son nicas. Yo lo que pienso amigo, es que cuando llegas a determinado nivel intelectual o econmico las personas se olvidan de peque?os detalles. La verdad no entiendo bien an como las personas se fijan tanto en ciertas cosas como en la persona en s. Pero bue... un abrazo y suerte, sabes que me caus gracia tu pregunta amigo. Valora a las personas por sus personalidades y lo que son, no por lo econmico y lo intelectual o los estudios que hayan hecho. Vas a encontrar lo que se define como "amigo" y no como compa?eros.|`|3j58WlKgaa	Y TU ERES QUE???????EL DIOS!!!!!!!|`|YkMJPxBXaa	Yo siiiiiiiiiiiiiii|`|mOpp82NOaa	Porque el corazon es el mismo y solo eso cuenta .

Te dir una frase qeu mi padre siempre me repeta y tengo siempre presente:  "Nunca mires a nadie como si fuera mas que t, porque t no eres menos y nunca mires a nadie como si fuera menos porque la grandeza del hombre consiste en hacer que todos se sientan grandes y a la vez saber reconocer su propia peque?ez."

Pues en mi opinin, los padres deben orientar la vida de sus hijos, aprender a aconsejarles y saberles guiar en su camino, pero sin sobrepasarse.    Es decir, los padres pueden ORIENTAR pero no IMPONER. Un hijo tiene derecho a hacer aquello que vaya ms adecuado conforme a sus principios y modos de pensar (siempre dentro de los mbitos de la normalidad, claro).    El camino lo deciden los hijos, porque tarde o temprano, se har adulto y el nico responsable de sus actos sern ellos.

Los padres podes orientar el camino a seguir de vuestros hijos, dar vuestra opinin y consejo, pero nunca decidir por ellos. An sabiendo que se van a equivocar, es justo dejarles vivir, equivocarse, pasarlo mal, levantarse de nuevo y alzar el vuelo.    ?Algn da os devolvern el favor? ?Algn da sentirn lo que vosotros sents por ellos? si, sin duda, pero por sus hijos.     Por si te apetece leer el poema completo, aqu te lo adjunto. Espero haber servido de ayuda.    Un saludo!    Tus Hijos    Tus hijos no son tus hijos, son hijos  e hijas de la vida, deseosa de s misma.  No vienen de ti, sino a travs de ti,  y aunque estn contigo, no te pertenecen.  Puedes darles tu amor, pero no tus pensamientos  pues ellos tienen sus propios pensamientos.  Puedes abrigar sus cuerpos, pero no sus almas,  porque ellas viven en la casa del ma?ana,  que no puedes visitar, ni siquiera en sue?os.  Puedes esforzarte en ser como ellos, pero  no procures hacerlos semejantes a ti,  porque la vida no retrocede, ni se detiene en el ayer.

The very qualities of being just slightly ?ut there"when compared to the vulgarity of modern life. And the ability to say I love you without speaking.
OpPrYE9raa	First off Im a guy, and I know how you feel, it took my fiance a long time to get used to me in public.  So all I can say is give him time, talk with him, tell him u understand and you can be patient, explain that u need him to show you he loves u, by actions not by words, tell him it is ok to express himself.

xzjUMP4Maa	Esa palabra conlleva un sinfn de actitudes, algunas positivas y otras negativas.  Por lo menos en mi pas se puede tomar como "la que no se deja de nadie", la "que dice las cosas claras", la que "todos y todas admiran porque tiene actitudes positivas"...o sea una mujer que a cualquiera le gustara tener como amiga, pero que como novia lo pensara porque podra ponerle en situaciones complicadas.  En otros lugares quizs las tachen de "fciles", "regaladas", lo que definitivamente a ningn hombre le gustara tener como pareja seria.  Lo importante es tener un equilibrio en la manera de ser en una mujer, pues el ser demasiado dcil tampoco es bueno al momento de querer tener pareja.|`|51bb6e6ad08b00c6631e5a39c2b828abaa	si, no se porke pero tiene un plus ke las hace mas sexies.  bye|`|LWUeR5t2aa	Eso no es sierto YO TE AMO A TI.|`|SbBz509Caa	no. les gustan las tontitas son mas faciles de enga?ar|`|Y2j11GA0aa	A que tipo de Kbronas te refieres?

La crise d'pilepsie rsulte d'un drglement passager de certaines fonctions crbrales. II existe normalement un quilibre entre les milliards de neurones excitateurs et inhibiteurs qui peuplent le cerveau. Or, la rupture de cet quilibre a pour effet de dclencher la dcharge simultane de toute une population de neurones. Et surtout ce n'est pas une maladie contagieuse!   La crise dure le plus souvent 1  2 minutes.  Ce qu'il faut faire        * Rester calme.      * Glisser un coussin sous la tte du malade.-      * Desserrer les vtements autour du cou.      * Faire de la place autour du malade.      * Noter la dure de la crise.      * Aprs la crise, proposer au malade de l'aider ou de le raccompagner chez lui. (Les pileptiques portent souvent sur eux une carte SOS qui contient des recommandations appropries.  Aprs la disparition des convulsions        * Allonger le malade confortablement.      * Veiller  ce que le malade puisse respirer librement.      * Proposer de l'emmener dans un endroit o il peut se reposer.  Et surtout continuer  voir votre proche comme une "personne normale" comme vous dites. Rien ne lui ferait plus plaisir que cela!|`|oO3GIoYtaa	je ne voie pas pourquoi se tenir loigner ce n'est pas contagieux  j'ai une amie qui est pileptique et cela ne m'empche pas de la frquenter|`|3Q1mFXyaaa	Difficile  dire sans le vivre vraiment.

Pero ponte a pensar q as como tu lo amas a el tu jams le pondras los cuernos por el simple hecho de que LO AMAS, entonces si el de verdad te amara no tendra pq fijarse en otra persona y no tendra pq montarte cachos con esa otra persona si de verdad te amara...    Por lo tanto te aconsejo q por doloroso q sea entonces mejor dejalo ir y trata de dejar de pensar en el y sal mas seguido y haz algo q te distraiga para q no pienses mucho en el pq de lo contrario si te quedas metida todo el da en tu casa va ser muy dificil sino esque casi imposible de olvidarlo.

qD6um98Waa	I'm white and my son's father is puerto rican,  Tell your grandparents that you love them but will not tolerate any negative comments, gestures or anything of that nature whatsoever. Tell them that to you a person's skin color doesn't matter and that since they do love you, they would want you to be with someone who treats you the way that they would want you to be treated. ( If they say you can find someone of your own race, tell them something like , he is part of my race, the human race or something like Americas a big mixing pot, I would be glad to research as much as our family tree that I can to see if we are and were only white. They might not like it but,it might get their attention.)   If they can't accept him then they are telling you you can't be the person that you are. It sounds like you accept people for who they are, not by skin color/what they are. Your grandparents have to get over it. Your man must love you to put up with that garbage, hold on to him.|`|AA11906024	when you introduce your BF to them just say "hi granddad, grandma, this is my BF (insert name here)" and that's all, i don think people now a days have an issue with the race itself but how people portray it.  If he dresses and acts like he is straight out the hood then I could understand why your grand parents would have a problem with him. As long as he looks and speaks and acts like a respectable citizen and shows them respect and respects you, they may possibly change their way of thinking, if not of the whole puerto rican race then they will say that he is an exception (and that's all that matters!)    if they still dont like him, then oh well, you only see them once in awhile anyway...|`|TbBmgJ2eaa	Hmm. as far as my experience with racists go, they dont usually dare say racist remarks in front of whoever they are attacking when they are on the losing end. In fact alot of racists I know are in fact xenophobic, and just too dam afriad to face other races. They only talk big amongst their own crowd.     I suppose I dont really know your grandparents, but from what I can guess, there wont be a real need to fear them saying anything demeaning.|`|3702dbd3a2e26a222532ed4cf709d806aa	I wouldnt take my boyfriend to meet any racist people in my family because I wouldnt want people to hurt him.    Maybe they wouldnt say anything to him BUT he might be uncomfortable. If you see your grandparents once in a while, they dont need to meet him. Just tell them one day about your boyfriend and see what they will say.|`|B4wKhkwKaa	.FIRST  I   would   talk  to them before  I  put  someone   I love  in   a   situation  like  that .You   can   get  a  feel  for  how  their going  to  react  to the news about  your  relationship.THEN  you   decide how  to bring the  two together.|`|qL5ROeLeaa	well I'm puerto rican and my husband is jamaican my family are not racist but they think you should not be out of your race.  when i introduced him my parents accepted him as he was. even though sometimes they say things behind our backs. but if your grandparents love you they will accept him.  and if they don't who cares?  if they say something racist to your boyfriend don't worry if he loves you or cares about you he wont leave you.    good luck!|`|FNSVujOLaa	There's racist and ingorance...and the generation your working with it's a combination.   I would suggest that your best move if you want to introduce him is first to have one of your family get to gethers as you say it's once a month. Well the next time you go to see them. Take a picture or two of him and one with the two of you. Now I hope this guy has got something on the ball. IF he's going to college and is attending college that's a big point in his favore. Tell them the truth about him. Don't leave anything out that is important. And then you say.. grandma and grandpa...I know you might not like him because he's puerto rican...but he's more than that, he's the guy that opens the door for me. And he better start if he isn't already!...  Back to my finsh..He's the guy that opens the door for me, he walks me to the door at the end of our date. He always makes sure I had a good time. He never says a harsh word or speaks badly of me. He always says yes and thank you and please.  What you are doing is "and this has got to be true or it wont work" showing them the code they grew up with..and to be honest needs to be brought back...and that is to be always respectful and a well mannered gentleman..then when they hear this they will give you because you are there grand daughter the bennifiet of the doubt, and that's when you say I want you to meet him, and see how good he is to me. And they will if you phrase it that way.   If they shoot this down then it might not be worth the trouble untill this becomes an engagement, other wise it's to much trouble for a negative result no matter what.

Yo soy mexicana y ahora vivo en Holanda, aqu en Holanda, en Blgica, Alemania y en EUA, entre muchos otros pases, se celebra el 2o domingo de mayo.    Yo igual me pregunto por qu se celebrar en Argentina en octubre! No lo saba!    "En Mxico... correspondi al diario Excelsior tomar la iniciativa para celebrar a las madrecitas a nivel nacional de acuerdo con la siguiente crnica:     Corra un 10 de mayo del a?o de 1922, cuando el diario de la vida nacional Excelsior lanz la iniciativa de instituir a este da para celebrar en todo Mxico como Da de la Madre y la inciativa fue aceptada y aprobada.     Desde esta fecha el pueblo mexicano se volca en agasajos y homenajes para otorgar un justo reconocimiento a todas las madres mexicanas, sean estas jvenes, adultas, ancianas, ricas o pobres y tambin a las madres que han emprendido el viaje sin retorno, se les homenajea ofrecindoles misas, rosarios o depositando ramos de flores en sus tumbas."

Mas no obstante, me conduzco con  cuidado, pues no puedo perder de vista que existe el celo profesional, es decir, la rivalidad que se da en los trabajos en los cuales cada quien quiere llegar a ciertas posiciones y algunos no les importa si tienen que llevarse a medio mundo por delante para lograr subir.

No estoy en contra de la amistad aqu mismo he encontrado buenas personas que te ofrecen su cari?o  sincero.

Hay que abrir los ojos y la mente, y darse cuenta de lo que hay mas all de lo que nuestros corazones nos dictan.    El corazn y los sentimientos humanos conforman la mayora absoluta de nuestra percepcin del mundo y de nuestra propia vida y existencia, por lo que hay que sanear esa parte de nuestra alma.    Hay que darse cuenta de nuestros defectos, y los defectos de esa persona que necesitamos, y aprender a ver "el lado positivo" de ese problema.

Segn los datos del mencionado estudio, el 36% de los estadounidenses prenden el televisor dentro de los primeros quince minutos de haber llegado a su casa. El 52% de los televidentes abandonan la habitacin cuando llegan los comericiales mientras que el 53% de los que se quedan en el recinto empiezan a cambiar de canal ni bien empiezan los avisos.    En cuanto a la vestimenta de los televidentes, el estudio de DirecTV sostiene que el 12% mira TV en su ropa de trabajo, el 7% en bata de ba?o y el 1% se echa en el sof frente a la tele completamente desnudo.    asi es que con estos datos pues no nos pelan aveces y su mujer suele ser la tele o el auto=( |`|GB6gd77Maa	QUE BUENO , PERO PARA ESO EXISTEN LOS AMANTES|`|7a0Wb4Z0aa	Mi esposo es Ingeniero de Minas, siempre prefiri ms a sus piedras, rocas, a sus vetas...qu se yo... hasta el da de hoy.

En se mariant, on passe  l'etape suivante: on s'engage, ce n'est plus du jusqu' ce que mais du sauf si vraiment... dans un cas la rupture est bel et bien presente, dans l'autre cas elle est rejete.  Ensuite, il y a tout l'aspect financier et de protection de soi et de l'autre. En cas de deces de l'un ou de l'autre, il vaut mieux tre mari si on a des biens achets en commun, comme un appartement... pareil si l'un ou l'autre vient  avoir un grave accident et qu'il y a des decisions importantes  prendre, si le couple n'est pas maris, c'est aux ascendants et descendants de prendre la decision, le concubin n'a pas son mot  dire. Pareil en cas de mutation... mieux vaut tre maris pour pouvoir beneficer du rapprochement de conjoints.

7noiAH63aa	me and my ex are the same. we were eachothers firsts too.      I really feel like theres still something between us so im fighting it... but not really fighting it... im just moving my way back in slowly but steadily.    me and my ex broke up 4 months ago... but I miss him SO much. I know he misses me... he just wont admit it. So lately I've just been texting him maybe once a week and I've been getting replies, i didn't used to get replies. And now we're talking like we did right before we started dating.     Idk, maybe you could try that?|`|tLMKB5lUaa	I think you should move on.

If you think you do, go to him, hold his face and make him lesten to you, tell him that you want him !! He will listen. But don't do that unless you are sure you won't break up again. If you are unsure, let him move on. Girls can be confusing, but for guys either love or not at all.

My advice move on find another girl, you have a long life ahead of you, and there plenty of other "Loser's" out there for you. Don't try stealing, that isn't cool, and it wouldn't work as much as you think. Trust me on this move on, and in the future if she single and your single then go for her, but now just date around, you may never know what you might find.  BD

Hay muchos solteros que han tenido muy mala suerte, y cuando ven a una pareja de casados feliz, comienzan a hacer "cerebritos".      No digo que suceda el 100% de las veces, pero s un 80% de las veces.  En otros casos tambin pasa que son los casados los que comienzan a a?orar sus a?os de soltero(a), y no se sienten a gusto estando casadas(os).      Ambas situaciones pasan cuando una de las partes no tiene muy buena autoestima, por supuesto, y no sabe lo que quiere en la vida.  Yo entiendo que se puede compartir, pero no estar juntos y revueltos las 24 horas del da, los 7 das de la semana.  Mi humilde opinin.  Buen da para ti.|`|2mqxKwPtaa	Pueden ir todos juntos, el problema son las actividades de cada grpo, recuerda que el soltero es totalmente libre y el casado ya ha perdido el 50% de su libertad, si es que no el 100% como en muchos casos (Caso pattico de los mandilones) adems de que los intereses son totalmente diferentes, los solteros viven a plenitud la vida, el casado ya esta cargado de responsabilidades, por lo que de cualquier manera es mas serio o amargadito.  Saludos.|`|Jb8i2sMzaa	No necesariamente, pero los casados tienen mas cosas en comun entre ellos  Tambin puede pasar que un soltero llegue a estar de mas en algn momento cuando est junto a una pareja de casados  Los casados ocuparn mas tiempo a su conyuge y las cosas de su casa  los solteros pues tienen otras ocupaciones...    saludo?|`|gRh9mSppaa	No necesariamente, se puede compartir en grupo, siempre y cuando nadie cruce esa linea y  falte el respeto.

Z4Z0IO7aaa	Repeat after me: "It's not love unless there are two people who agree on it."    This is what I would tell my own daughter or sister:     It's hormones. If he's a player, you are his toy, and when he is finished playing with you, he will throw you away. You will be heartbroken, damaged, maybe hurt physically, maybe pregnant. It is not the sort of feeling that will last, it is not the sort of feeling that you can build a relationship on. It's like being drunk, or like a cat in heat.     I know it's a roller-coaster ride, but if you can understand what is happening, it might help you from making big mistakes.    As a primary sort, some women need to be excited to be receptive, others need to be relaxed. Apparently you are susceptible to being excited. Just try to keep your eyes open about who is exciting you.|`|116206dba14d2e5042f6c2fef652190faa	When I wuz in high school, ages ago. If I knew another guy was dating a girl I liked or if even a friend of mine and I liked the same girl, I'd drop her like a burnt potato. I don't do competition. I took a friend's grrl in jr. hi now none of us talk anymore.    Now you say this cat's a player. Does someone need to hit you in the head like you need a V8? If he's a player and you know this, what makes you think he won't play you too. You think you got that Robin Givens touch to out play Eddie Murphy in the movie Boomerang, then you go grrl! You melt whenever you see this guy, even when he's with other grrls, is there any coffee brewing? Someone has gotta wake up and smell this, quick.    I'm a guy, never been a player, hate to admit it but I have been played. Unless your a magician, pull your rabbit out of your hat and turn that guy around, otherwise, there's other fish in the sea, unless you don't like fish, you get my point, don't cha?|`|f3bN7nw2aa	forget about him.. it may be hard, i know, but just forget him. he's not worth your time of day.|`|551d6f3460d1fe605ec4b3484bf76ff7aa	If he's a player why do you want to be with him? All he will do will date you for 2 weeks, see if you put out, if you don't he'll find another girl.....he just knows his way with the ladies, not worth it.|`|gHxCVVqKaa	Yep. Lust.  I had a similar situation.  The guy is not good for you, and you have to realize this.  You are just impressed with his confidence in himself, and the possiblility that he really likes you.  Shy guys won't do overt things like bending over in front of us, or catching our eyes, which is why we become attracted to the bad guys.  Just remember, it won't work.  Start looking for nicer guys who might be a little bit shy, and start giving them some much needed incouragement to respond to you the same way this player did.|`|KdMGFrDlaa	Looks like he's caught your heart  Like he's probably done to bunches of other   girls since he's a player it may be hard but get   over him if you don't you'll go crazy and he'll move  on but you won't   best if luck!|`|vOUr1AOyaa	use your brain|`|k92TRIeKaa	you knowingly go for a player and you'll knowingly get hurt..then that's knowingly you're problem!|`|oSuLeDk8aa	He would hurt you...

Just move on...|`|CUCG071Maa	You know he's a player and that he's with other girls, so you must know that he's going to hurt you in the long run. That's a bad trait as it is so try thinking about all the negative things about him and how much pain they'll bring you if you were to get with this guy. I know that may sound kind of harsh, but from my experiences, always looking and focusing on someone's negative traits always helps in getting over them.|`|IUeBv54Vaa	ok first of all. thats how my ex boy friend/boyfriend is. but give him a chamce and show him u aint playin games with your heart and maybe he will straightn up. thats what my boyfriend did. and gurl he bent over for u! he's definately feeling u! but um yeah hunn...it ain't love. trust i know how it feels and u just have a HUGE crush. u actually have to talk to the guy to be inlove. and sweetums you dont...soory. talk to him and get to know him first and then see if its true love mkay? kay. do your thang girl|`|AA11458063	For some reason girls fall for he dangerous guys. Some go with them and they either are miserable or get really hurt. then some girls realize that the dangerous guy could hurt them and go for a not so dangerous guy.

I'm just going to tell you to be careful because you're most likely just going to get hurt... there's nothing you can do to stop thinking about him...so in time you will get over him...it took me like 2 years to get over my crush for a player...and it took him to start dating my best friend to really get over him...Im not even emotely attracted to him anymore... i feel for you because i know that you are going to get hurt..so good luck...|`|8NDVdlUeaa	Yep, use your brain...so, players are not to be taken seriously so, if ever... just have fun and enjoy the game... just be sure it don't backfire on ya...
AA10218410	Plenty of guys like that girl next door image, (not the movie.) There are alot of guys who prefer a sweet girl like yourself, you just haven't met him yet.

I mean if you're extremely shy, no guy will be able to see what you're really like, and therefore won't ask you on any dates and go out with you.|`|KoB1gnQraa	no, if the girl is aggresive that means she's easy and a *****!!!!!I      I dont' like aggresive girls....  i like shy but caring girls.....  so don't worry about it, a lot of girls like shy girls too|`|2C6xvTagaa	im like that...   and yea, guys like that    guys like all type of girls, depending on the type of guy    but if you're sensitive, u'll get hurt easily..    at least I do|`|5hqHsa8daa	girl im still trying to figure that out as well. just try to be more on the "sweet" side and just be yourself while you are with a guy. i think i need to take my own advice.lol.|`|3yTM2fPPaa	yesnot sure becuz guys in a relationships  dont like when the gurl is slow  that dont kiss or huge then or hardly talk to them but i am not sure if guys like shy gurls|`|4949e95324f254e4cb254812f60680bdaa	no. my girl was very shy at first and i feel in love with her and know we are about to get married. some times its better to be shy because a man knows you wont cheat on him. the best way to stay shy and to let a guy know you like him is to look at him and turn away when he looks. it worked for my girl.

2L8Lbn0Aaa	It kinda depends on how he tried to get you in the sack. If he was bugging you about it or got upset when you wouldn't, I would say he's not in it for the long haul, but if he was just testing his boundaries, then you'll need to tell him where you stand and what you're looking forin a partner.|`|5Acf7Fmbaa	I believe you should defiantly be up front with him and tell him that you want a relationship--not just sex. Besides if he is still with his girlfriend, he is not showing true commitment to you. But be careful because if you get in a relationship with this guy who apparently does not care about his girlfriend's feelings, he might just do the same to me.

p0ZrElDSaa	Me encant! que video fantstico, con un ritmo de salsa inigualable, la letra me pareci maravillosa.  Ahora con respecto a tu pregunta, esta es mi respuesta.  Puedes desnudar un cuerpo, como quien quita las capas de una cebolla,   puede quitar prenda por prenda o arrancarlas pero si tu corazn no tiene amor, pues nada significa.  Lo importante es el quitar lo que sea cuando el alma siente, el corazn palpita, la piel se eriza, el deseo se enciende, y el alma sonre felz.  El amor es mucho ms que quitar un vestido, explicaselo enamorandote.  Mi abrazo.|`|e57af0619b3cc168a6a27e634a3c8782aa	dificil marinero..el alma no entiende razones q el corazon quiera mandar..pero nada es imposible...intenta ser coerente y decirle q con calma todo camino pueda ser recorrido y pasar cualquier obstaculo x grande q sea,suerte|`|UZzSlUwEaa	No tengo tiempo de entrar a You Tube, aclara ms las preguntas.

Just get him one good gift. Remember if you do too much it might freak him out a bit. I know it sounds weird, but he can start thinking..."Do I have to get her multiple gifts too"...or..."is she more into me then I am in her"? Figure out what he's into. Sports...movies...music...cars...Then go from there. If he's into music you can get him a couple of tickets to a band he likes. Or if he's into sports you can get him memorabilia. Just get him one gift, but put a lot of thought into. good luck.

El amor es vivir, es compartir, el amor es pedir perdn si haz fallado.     DAR UN ABRAZO ESPERANDO EL CALOR DE LOS SENTIMIENTOS AJENOS... ES LA ESPERA DE UN SENTIMIENTO QUE PUEDE SER PROHIBIDO.    Es poder mostrar nuestro corazn de ni?o sin tener que esperar nada a cambio, es poder expresar nuestros sentimientos con el alma sin tener que perder el cuerpo  .  Amor es simplemente dar todo lo que uno puede dar.    El amor es la experiencia mas hermosa que puede tener un ser humano, es querer dar sin recibir.    Este sentimiento es la energa de la vida es lo que nos impulsa a hacer algo por nosotros mismo y por los dems.    Es una sensacin bella pero que desespera a la vez. Res por ninguna razn, saludas a todos sin motivo. Los das estn llenos de motivacin. Quieres gritarle al mundo lo que sientes.    Como el viento que sopla y se siente al pasar...

El amor se puede manifestar de manera natural a travs de actitudes donde a pesar puedan tratarte mal, buscas el bien en esa persona porque sabes que es la nica manera que pueda cambiar y mejorar, no buscas el hacer algo indebido o impropio donde quieras sacar un provecho oculto o un beneficio secreto, sino buscas el crecimiento tuyo y de la otra persona al cual amas, no buscas lo tuyo de manera egosta sino que compartes, no te irritas ni guardas rencor vengativo porque entiendes que la otra persona tiene tantos talentos como defectos igual que tu entonces aprendes a tener paciencia, esperas y soportas pacientemente pero con una actitud activa (no de brazos cruzados o so?ador improductivo) para as ayudar a que otros tambin mejoren. El amor nunca dejar de ser porque no busca tu beneficio personal sino que deseas que los dems tambin aprendan a ser mejores y valorarse. Y es una eleccin, porque nosotros elegimos a quien amar y es ah donde abrimos nuestros corazones para compartirlo, no se basa en las emociones porque estas son circunstanciales y dependen del contexto en que te desenvuelves, sino en eleccin y actitud, que a pesar las cosas puedan ser difciles, el compromiso y la responsabilidad es que de juntos la luchen por seguir adelante mirando al frente esperando vuelvan los mejores tiempos.|`|ZH0oJPf3aa	mi esposo|`|Bebz8Vvaaa	es un todo.. vida..placer,,,tranquilidad,, vejez....gozo...procrear....sexual....es...|`|6NYCJln6aa	mi familia, mi esposa, mis hijos, amor es felicidad, mas o menos.|`|ji4ZQO7Naa	para mi esta palabra es muy dificil describir... eso es un sentimiento muy bonito...q no se sabe sino cuando lo sientes...  http://mx.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...|`|sxPQAzyFaa	a) cuatro letras    b) mi marido y mis hijos|`|baac98e1b34a57cbb1b12cd8a6ae0d91aa	A lgo  M uy  O rrible como para  R epetir|`|D0odSLjIaa	La primera persona que me viene a la mente al oir amor es mi pareja.

Tambien es el privilegio de ser incluido de manera total y nica, en el amor interpersonal es una cloncusin de dos.  Cuando una persona est enamorada lo sabe, lo siente, lo vive en cada pulsacin, porque el organismo se encarga de avisarle. El amor llega como un huracn que rompe todo a su paso.  No pueden obligarte a amar, ni t puedes exigirlo. El amor llega cuando quiere y se va cuando quiere.  Cuando el amor toque la puerta, entrar como una tromba: no podrs dejar afuera lo malo y recibir slo lo bueno. Si piensas que amar es igual a la felicidad, te equivocaste de camino.  El amor tiene dos enemigos principales: la indiferencia, que lo mata lentamente, y la desilusin, que lo elimina de una vez.  Nadie puede vivir sin amor, porque el es la fuerza que garantiza la unin de todo el cosmos. Si no amramos, nos desintegraramos y no podramos pertenecer a este todo orgnico llamado "Vida".   Definitivamente. es ms fcil amar a Dios que a las personas, porque no tenemos que convivir con Dios, al menos, en un sentido humano.  El amor es lo mas maravilloso que Dios le a ense?ado a la humanidad, es comprencion, confianza, comunicacion, respeto, sacrificio, cari?o, ternura, paz, alegria, apoyo, ect...  Es lo mas lindo que puede suceder, pero para amar debes primero amarte a ti mismo   Mucha suerte y un Beso Mayita Maus!!!

Mira...tu esposo seguramente te ama, pero...

oHcF2u28aa	Termination of parental rights needs to be done a specific way for it to be deemed legitimate.  Normally someone needs to be ready to adopt the child in this situation.  She cannot just decide to do this to avoid paying.  If you are seeking to do this, use a lawyer and see that it is done legally.|`|cabHEoEYaa	I can tell you that in Arkansas even if one parent signs away rights they still pay child support until the child is adopted.  The last person that answered said that in every state you can sign away your rights and not pay, but that is absolutely not true for every state.  I think the only sure way to find out is to contact a lawyer in your area.  I know here laws are changing all the time in regards to child visitation and child support.|`|80d9ef597fd265580689e46dab3de1d0aa	Yes, she can sign her rights over. She doesn't have to pay child's support than. But when you sign your rights over your not aloud she see the kids any more. She doesn't want to be a mother any more. When parents sign there rights away they don't have to pay child's support but it goes like that in every state.

L1OYfP2Oaa	Whatever maybe the truth or whatever maybe the situation, always don't forget that you should first love yourself in spite of anything, you did the right thing of course & do remember true friends can be obtained only when we are true. And so what you have done is also a kind of tracing good friends. So my friend friends are the persons who wants us to feel happy, and in that sense you had been a very wise person to share your friends only happiness.     I say that what you have done is the right thing to do.Take care.  Please tell what was the result if you wish to.|`|OeBPlvoNaa	The truth shall set you free! If they are your real friends they will love you no matter what! If they start to fade away now you can find the friends you've been waiting for! Only you can say when your ready to reveal something about yourself so the timing was perfect, you did it when you had the courage to tell! Good Luck!|`|J6C7zr7Raa	it was good to tell them truth. i always find that by hiding something it always ends up getting me in trouble. you did do the right thing you should feel some relief soon|`|IJZ09cWXaa	It sounds like something very personal to you...  You needed to be sure you were ready to tell them... It's your secret to keep and if that's what you wanted to do it perfectly fine! Nobody can tell you if telling them was the right thing to do but if you felt like it was bothering you to keep it to yourself then it WAS the right thing to do! As for your friends... True friends will support you... It might take sometime but things will come together. Don't worry....|`|wXNn5qDnaa	I have no idea what you were hiding, but you did the right thing by telling them. If you want true friends and be a real one yourself, you will have to do that even if it means losing a few. If it were really that bad, then I suppose they can understand why you waited. However, I believe that you should learn how to get over this problem that you have because you can't live your whole life in fear of rejection. You have to learn to deal with it properly and accept that even if there are a lot who cannot understand, some will. We are only human.|`|2b6b619eada4b810cc771669ab714bd3aa	Why should you hide at all?  If they were your friends they should've accepted you for who you are and not what your style was.  You did the right thing by telling them but you should've told them sooner.  I know that you were scared but you shouldn't do things to please others, just yourself.  Because it will destroy you for acting like something your not.|`|kfmcs5hnaa	What you did was right. Real friends accept you for who you are. They will be with you through thick and thin and whatever you want to be, they should be encouraging you, not tearing you down. If they can't accept you for who you are, it's their choice...

If he wants to dump you, or you feel like the love is gone in the relationship, end it first. You need to be the one on top, not him.    He will get plenty of chances to be the one to dump a girl. Also, don't stay together if there is no love...it may be hard for you to give him up, but it sounds like he is immature and it needs to be done.|`|AA10867776	girl i would be really poed i think he thinks of it as a game, and to me it seems like he is playing with your head!!!|`|x0jbfxl3aa	Tell him you think its a bit too much and that your relationship means more to you, and should to him, than some game.|`|UtrnUwetaa	Well, it sounds like he's got some peer pressure going on from his friends.  They probably think he's puttycat whipped and are implementing a unofficial intervention to save him from utter doom.      However, he will at some point, need to decide between them or you.  Then you will know.  In my experience the friends team will always win up until the early 30's.  So depending on your age, you can get a ballpark figure of success.|`|7fYlL8tUaa	he probably was playing around but that was too far just try to talk to him and find out why he said and don't take that truth or dare crap..|`|AA10796624	Tell him to quit playin games like that that involve u if hes not serious about the break up becuz the playing is annoying and hurts your feelings and confuses u.|`|71DOeFJ9aa	Its kind of immature for your boyfriend of 6 months to joke around like that.

I think that was very inmature of him. Love should'nt hurt like that. What he did was innapropriate and very inconsiderate.    Please , take your time in deciding what you are going to do next. If you know he will do things like this again or wont be considerate of your feelings, it is best to leave him so he wont ever cause you any more pain    If you think this was a one time slip, then sit down with him and let him know exactly how you feel.    Good luck!!!|`|ivIVAAEyaa	i'd be pissed with him if i were you... even if he said it was for truth or dare it was a stupid thing to do and it can be very hurtful and make you doubt him.... call him and give him a piece of your mind.... he shouldn't do something like this... if he does still like you he shouldn't have done that, if he wants to break up with you he should be a man and tell you directly and not act like a coward....|`|NTBIhfRtaa	I think you need to make it clear to him that that kind of behavior is unacceptable. Seriously do you want to be with someone that plays "Truth or Dare" at the expense of your feelings. Dont reward him with attention if he can't treat you with respect|`|w8NuyQMfaa	ok i just have to say hes a jerk...what person would do that as a dare??? thats just messed up...big time....tell him to stop being immature n rude. tell him he cant toy with your emotions like that. you deserve better. make sure he understands that he shouldnt do that, dare or no dare thats just mean. hope everything works out for you. best wishes    Steph!!

Pk8Q7OG0aa	Achoi que depende da pessoa, algumas pessoas tem mais necessidade e outras nem tanto, eu por ex me masturbo todo dia mesmo depois que comecei a namorar , pq pra mulher a masturba??o tem haver com ela querer sentir prazer , querer a sensa??o do orgasmo , e nao por que ela esta querendo fazer sexo com um homem, eu tenho rela??o com meu namorado ta, mas e quando estou sozinha e nao transei com ele eu sinto vontade de sentir essa sensa??o sozinha nem preciso pensar nele, e nem em nenhuma figura masculina, se eu assitir um filme erotico sim talvez me ajude mais, mas so de me tocar sem pensar em homem ja sente o prazer chegar e relaxa a mulher fica menos estressada, eu acho que ambos fazem, mas o homem divulga mais por ser homem e homem nao preciso falar mais nada, sempre tiveram mais liberdade pra dizer EU ADORO SEXO. Mulher so come?ou a ser sincera com ela mesmo a pouco tempo antigamente e eu aidna conheco muitas ate hj que so dizem que so fazem amor. fala serio, isso e culpa da sociedade machista de antigamente que achava que a palavra sexo para mulheres direita nao caia bem, esta ai hj a conseguencia um monte de coroa que so foi conhecer o orgasmo depois do 40, mas gra?as a Deus que eu sou de outra gera??o fui eduicada com muito mais dialogo e liberdade e meu primeiro orgasmo foi aos 15 e hj com 21 ele so aumenta cada vez maaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaais|`|d2d3917fd55db27b3d8cb47602af21f4aa	nao posso te dizer com muita certeza mais acho q eh o homem!!!|`|4P482uxLaa	Nusss..q pergunta em!!

Na minha opini?o isso independe se  homem ou mulher, depende de cada um, da vontade que cada um tem. E outra, o homem fala at sem fazer, ja a mulher "a maioria", at faz, mas n?o fala.

oHcF2u28aa	Go to your states child support enforcement site.  They should have your states guidelines and forms there for you to calculate the support amount.  You can also apply with the local child support enforcement office for services in establishing and enforcing a court order at little or no cost.|`|9f2391ebf6a1c505bb9421899963d771aa	Normally the government or judge will decide that. Look at the amounts that the court orders people to pay. You could call the courthouse and ask for some advice on the percent. Really, if you are trying to do this yourselves without the judge being involved as a part of the divorce, you might get more since there won't be govt fees taken out of it, but it depends on how well you two get along and if he isn't going to play hardball and be a jacka.ss about it after the divorce is finalized.|`|jOrK7ZX0aa	Get a lawyer today. Do not let him tell you that it will save money if you both use HIS lawyer. Remember that lawyer will be working for your husband and NOT you.  Get your own lawyer. He will know how much child support you would have in your state. Also, get all the information you can on bank accounts, credit cards, savings, checking, 401K accounts. The laws are different for every state. Some states are community property and everything must be divided 50%. If that is your state, don't let your almost ex talk you into taking less. Get your own lawyer. It will be the best money that ever came out of a joint checking account.|`|AA10789336	Thank you for correctly stating "we" have one child.  Now lets keep it like that.  Tell him you want shared custody 50/50 and no child support.  He has to take responsibility for the child the full 50% of the time.  This should keep him busy and keep the child in his life and other women out of it and his bed.  Stay within a 10-15 minute drive of each other and in the same school district.  Don't let him off the hook.|`|ba18f107c5eb5f119b711f13a846ecd4aa	You need to go to the Attorney Generals Office.And they will determine the amount of child support he has to pay,by his gross income.|`|435390163a4e541b09d69e6930758316aa	that's up to the judge
sSlxwrSLaa	Over eight years.  We live together and spend most of our free time together.  We both "do our own thing" sometimes.  We both hang out with pretty much the same people-no "my friends"  "your friends".  We are both over 40-pushing 50 if that helps|`|JJDQPaDBaa	I am going to be twenty soon and she is 18.

277a59eeb63a4a7bfd537edd35bbea45aa	They have this amount that they go by.  I have been there, so I know the feeling.  They only figure in so much of the rent and utilities.  And if you pay childcare, they only use $125 as the amount.  If you are like I was, you probably spend about $500/mth alone on childcare.  From the sound of it, you make "enough" to support a household of 3 people.  You still qualify for WIC, so go for that.  Food stamps are basically for the illegals, the foreigners, and the people who refuse to work.  If you try to help yourself, they could care less about you.  Go to http://65.216.150.143/fns/ to check to see how many people would have to be in your household to qualify and use family members to get some.  If you have to and has his social, use the baby daddy.  I used both my grandmother and bd, to qualify.  But both times I was making way less then I am now.  Yup, I had to have someone else on mine to qualify at 6.50 an hour.|`|AA11657549	Yes, honey you make enough money to support you and one child.  It's only two of you, and he is only 3 1/2 so he doesn't eat that much food.  You make well over minimum wage.  If you want stamps that bad, go for $10 per hour to $6.75...you'll definately get food stamps then!|`|U0109lQBaa	You dont want nothing from the system then you become dependent on it.  Just keep striving and try to find bargains thats all I can say.  Once you hook up with the government it is hard to shake them.|`|LKKFsuEDaa	Cinnatig, that was rude! I am an only chid living with my parents and we get food stamps because they are disabled and can't work. So, some people need food stamps.    I understand your predicament, sometimes I steal food from school or something to get by on. Too bad summer is coming up though. Try local food banks. Oh yeah, and about the pride thing...either ask for some help, steal, or starve. Don't like that? Well, if that's the problem, than you just need to be a woman and swallow it so you can get what you need. The other options do not seem much better.|`|ce9406e5795af2b3b0d0755496163560aa	Being raised by a single parent (my mother) I know that it is not easy.  She never applied for food stamps but it does not mean she did not struggle.  I am not sure what Atavacro.. meant but 10/hr is not a lot of $$$$.  By the time you pay for rent, day care, utilities and clothing for your child there is no more $$ left.  I know that is an antiquated system and it has been abused profusely but its the only on we have.  I really feel for you.    You may want to try local churches and see if they have food banks that would help you.  Churches are more compassionate to the point where they will help you financially.  My mother was given money to help her with her bills.  It was not alot of money but it came in right on time when she needed it the most.  Also, go back to social services and see if they are aware of any programs that may help you.  Good Luck and Hang in there!!!    Try this website and hopefully it helps.  http://www.secondharvest.org/|`|vGu6bcR9aa	You're making almost double minimum wage and you wonder how you make too much???    Now, I'm not saying that to minimize what you do and that it's not hard. I am just saying that you are in a better position than a lot of other people who are getting food stamps. You should have enough money for food.|`|2nZSjgHMaa	Hi hon....    i'm sorry to hear you're struggling, and i hope you will continue to avoid the child's father forever.. not good for your emotional health or that of your son.    i do know that in some states, you can get into a state funded child wellness program, and on medicaid for you and your child if you don't make enough money.. have you checked into that benefit?    another thing you could do, is check your community and surrounding communities for food pantries.  some churches give out food once a week to people who just come in off the streets and who are in need...my daughter in law did this when she was having financial problems, and once a week,  a local church gave her a couple of bags of food.  it's worth looking into.      also, some communities have a Community Action service, which might help with electric or other utilities.    you could also contact social services to find out about programs available... sometimes we just have to do a little legwork.    take care, and i hope you can find some good assistance out there... hugs

U5xm23h2aa	Certo che  vero. Semplciemente perch il fatto che lui sia com'  il motivo per cui ti  piaciuto; hai notato che a tradire le donen sono sempre uomini con donne stupende??? Il problema  che la donna vorrebbe il dongiovanni nato, ma lo vorrebbe fedele. Il che non  possibile.  Quindi, ci sono due scelte:  -prendersi un uomo "non " seduttore, ma  a nessuna piace (se non come ripiego)  -accettare le infedelt, anzi non porsi neanche il problema.  Se non vanno bene queste opzioni, si suggerisce di elevare un reclamo al Cretore che ci ha fatto differenti.  Purtroppo ,d a che mondo  mondo, questo contrasto maschi-femmine esiste, e quindi evidentemente  incancellabile.  Tra l'altro, hai notato che per ogni uomo che tradisce una donna c' una donna che va con un uomo gi impegnato?  Come la mettiamo?  Forse il problema non sono gili uomini, n le donne, ma semplciemente alcune donne che vorrebbero che tutto fosse come loro desiderano.

Sono convinta che se stai bene con una persona non la tradisci. L'unico fattore oltre l'insoddisfazione chepu portare a tradire secondo me  la curiosit unica a mancanza di esperienze. Non riguarda tutti, ma effettivamente credo che certe persone abbiano bisogno di capire cosa ci offre il mondo prima di scegliere. Ma alla fine scelgono anche loro!|`|oxph3LWkaa	innanzitutto io non mi considero affatto traditrice fortunatamente non ho questa malattia!!!!!! e sono completamente contro al tradimento, e secondo me non esiste perdono per chi tradisce, almeno per quanto mi riguarda io la penso cos!!! sono d'accordordissimo con te su questo e cio che il lupo perde il pelo ma non il vizio!!!! se uno ha l'abitudine a tradire difficilmente cambia... anzi  quasi impossibile!!! ecco perch secondo me non ha senso perdonare un tradimento, tanto poi chi il vizzietto ce l'ha sicuramente non lo perde!!! forse la donna pu cambiare e migliorare ma l'uomo no!!! la donna sa dire di no all'uomo... invece l'uomo non s rifiutare una donna!!!|`|UfoHMGovaa	s  vero.  sar anche una risp banale, ma  verissimo.  io sono una "traditrice".. ma forse prima di essere sommersa dai polliciotti versi,  meglio che mi spieghi. Quello che intendo dire,  che in passato l'ho fatto, pi di una volta, ci nn significa che nel momento in cui incontri la persona che consideri giusta tu debba tradire di nuovo, x forza, xch lo hai fatto in passato.  In realt, nn ti interessa veramente pi per niente tradire. Ho una relazione che dura da tanti anni e giuro di nn aver MAI tradito qst uomo meraviglioso. Ci nn toglie che se dovesse finire con lui, nn  detto che nn mi ricapiti in futuro.  Spero di essermi spiegata..|`|4jV5PU2Faa	voglio credere che il lupo perde anche il vizio.... bello crederci.....ma non so quanto fa bene al nostro cuore! io personalmente non ho mai tradito ma sono stata testimone di situazioni e credo che il detto abbia motivo di esistere....un fondo di verit c'!perch esistono queste persone al mondo?che si divertono o non so ci provano gusto a vedere le persone che le amano soffrire di un dolore che non  da poco.....non lo capir mai!e soprattutto non credo che mi trover mai dalla perte dei traditori....e se cos capitasse vorrei essere un lupo che perde subito il vizio!|`|2Fhm8NZoaa	secondo me tutto dipende dal motivo x il quale si tradisce
72BI5Imxaa	My family never misses a chance to tell embarrassing stories about me in front of others.  Usually this is at birthday parties or Christmas.    Anyway, leaving the room, or a very firm "No" has really gotten the message across.  I simply do not let them make fun of me for their own entertainment.   Of course, at 23, I'm the baby, the smallest, youngest, and shortest in the family, so I hear it all the time.|`|XGF8sGyTaa	go ahead then and break their jaws, or the sensible thing to do is ask them what the f**k is your problem, and why do you insist on me being the butt of you jokes, go and get a life or i will break your jaw.   good luck.|`|5mZp8R9maa	my brothers do this to me to an everytime i ask them to stop they nevre do!|`|52ytQQ2Raa	Learn to laugh with them.  sometimes it may be hard but it will make you feel better.|`|e9be038ee1aa464073677c3e4d10060faa	Just ignore them.

52a7926763692c156116ddc768c670bcaa	You sound like a really good friend.  Of course you aren't going to stop wanting to be friends because of cigarettes.    What you should do is explain to both of your friends that being around the smoke bothers you.  Ask them if they would stop when all of you are together.    You can get tons of smoking facts for when you talk, but express yourself in a way that assures them that it's only the habit that you're uncomfortable with and that you still care about them.|`|AA11097013	If your best friend (is a true friend) then she won't care if you are smoking. If you don't like it, just let them know... that you don't like it and maybe they could possibly keep the smoke away from you when you are with them.|`|9syZOhTgaa	There's no reason you have to dump your friends because they smoke.  But you have the right not to be subjected to their 2nd-hand smoke.  If you're in a car, for instance, they don't have the right to fill up the car with smoke.    You should make it clear to your friends how you feel about their smoking.  But once you have made it clear, once they know how you feel, you should shut up.  Their lives are their own to ruin.|`|5c571c4f67e0847c52fdcad82da07aa2aa	I don't see the problem. She smokes and you have to respect that. You don't smoke and SHE has to respect that. Let her know how you feel. If you're best friends you will work something out and still be buddies.

If you do not have a case open with your local child support enforcement agency, apply with them for assistance in enforcing the order at little or no cost.  She will have to hire an attorney and take you to court for visitation or custody.  If she files papers, retain counsel and line up as many character witnesses as you can.  Her not paying support will not help her case.|`|MxNFH4iraa	I don't think she will lose her parental rights now if you went to court, They would probley ask her where have you been. and they will probley enforce her child support, I know its not fair you are raising this child right and then comes along the deadbeat . my ex went to Florida didn't see kids a couple of yrs, I took him to court to enforce support order, he said I cant work I need my support lowered he only was maid to pay 30 dollars a week for 2 children. he is in arrears 51,000 dollars . I feel when 1 parent is absent for a long time they shouldn't have rights, but there are laws. I hope everything works out for you, consult a lawyer good luck.|`|yaXSDUBjaa	Go to family court.

KcPmFnNraa	Depends how you take it. Whore is generally an insult or deragatory remark towards another of which ever sex, usually referred to women. To me, as a female, it's an insult but shouldn't be used around children. So, the word is used and spoken depending on the person using it. Can be used as a curse word or insult.|`|vGu6bcR9aa	Like all words it depends on context.    Aiming the word at someone (i.e. calling a girl or your gf that) is a cuss word because you're using it to demean another. Using the word when perhaps abstractly discussing things that were done or occupations people had in the old west may not be the most appropriate language, but it isn't "cussing."|`|YVn7KRCmaa	its another word for a prostitute, a hooker, a loose woman, id say it was a cuss word|`|cf317f9aa6cf3aa76f007feb51e1d445aa	it isn't a "bad" word...as in it's not like saying "****" or something, however it can have a bad context.|`|C9LCSmVjaa	its a naughty word, yes.    shes soo stupid....|`|AkPQjuteaa	Well, maybe or maybe not, but lady of the night is much nicer.|`|5c20543ef14d2a3e6612b1b69c6f2b2eaa	I don't think it is nice, I don't think it is respectful, but it is not a cuss word.   You should not be calling anyone a whore, it is distasteful and derogatory to a woman.
zR8bhkOxaa	NO all men are not Players,first things first,form a friendship with the man,see how he treats women,you can find that out through his conversation,then tell him how you feel about him.If his feeling doesn't coinside with your feeling,keep looking,you'll find someone like me someday."SMILE"|`|AA12095484	Not all guys are players.|`|74dfe88a8f1e71d7a25d52b249b4cf5eaa	Most guys don't do anything because they are afraid of rejection.You have to be "available",in other words ,let a guy feel it's OK to say something to you.The other side is that you don't want to look desperate.That will really attract the wrong kinda guy and repel the Mr. Right.          No not all guys are Don Juan's or Romeos,somewhere in between.But if a guy feels he's important to a lady,his natural tendency is to take good care of her.If she lets him think he's not especially the best thing for her , he'll be gone.Guys are only human but they like to think they are more than that to some one.If that some one thinks less , they will seek out approval elsewhere.|`|Xm1tbzmPaa	if he attempts to fornicate with u then he mostly does not (yes does not) like u because he has no shame in touching u if not then he is prolly just shy but still wants some poon tang as it is only natural

IGkuqwFXaa	Sort of , men and women are biologically different and we have different goals.|`|7cc42CSZaa	I would have to disagree.

We want it as much as men do - sometimes more.|`|DTHEzn6Naa	I don't know about all of that but I do know that more men think of sex than a woman.  Our desire to sex depends on alot of factors and we have more higher priority than a man does.  For me, I can turn on and off my desire to have sex just by thinking of other things but if the sex is good enough and with one person; I can have a full desire that can last for a long time.  So I hope this helps.|`|ehJIgvnsaa	NO! I have a sex drive way better than my man and most my friends and I'm a chick... Get real!|`|WhtjVvzUaa	Yes. For the urge to sex is more in men than women.

This song is about a girl who is with someone else, yet she always has "that guy" to fall back on (being you).  I think you guys need to be single. You both are obviously not happy with who you both are with. So maybe you guys should break up with your partners, be single, then she can dedicate this song to another guy.  Dude!!!!

i9PfjsoHaa	Mira, en principio estoy de acuerdo con la repsuesta anterior... verse tanto puede crear una (co)dependencia muy ca?ona, sin embargo si tal cosa pasara no sera necesariamente slo por el hecho de verse seguido, sino por el hecho de llegar a olvidar que una pareja, por mas unida que sea, consta de dos individuos que piensan y sientes precisamente "individualmente".

7mtkEv6baa	I don't want to rain on your parade, but if you have to go to all those lengths to reassure yourself she's not going to cheat, it's not going to be worth your time. You're young, enjoy yourself and don't look at this as an end-of-the-world event. Long distance relationships rarely work for anyone, and when you are your age, you are less likely to know what you really want or need from a relationship like that, making it more likely that you'll find something else, or that she will. None of this means it is entirely impossible for your relationship to work, it's just not likely.|`|yqNMzGQhaa	If you're already planning on spying on her there is no trust. So Why bother?    You sound like a jealous control freak.|`|AA11314755	Wow. Last year in June me and my boyfriend lived in VA. He moved to TX....and I was sooooo sad. We spoke on the phone everyday and we trust eachother to the fullest so it was no problem. I actually moved down here with him in October! So I kinda now how you feel. Im sure its gonna work it out as long as you guys are faithful to eachother and trust eachother. Hey, maybe you can talk to your parents about visiting her for Winter Break or something? Just keep in contact... and like I said if you two really love eachother it will work out.|`|cl9LlJZFaa	I was almost hopeful until I read this:  "I've asked her for all of her passwords to everything she uses on the internet, as so she has been given mine, and I'm going to be talking to her mother once a week to see what she's been up to (to reassure myself on the factor of cheating) "    If you're worried about checking up on each other for the "cheating factor" then, no, it probably will not work out.  If you can't expect her to be honest about her activities without calling her mother (?), then no, it probably won't work out.  A long distance relationship requires a tremendous amount of patience, commitment and resilience to endure the long periods of separation.  Above all it requires honesty and TRUST...as any meaningful relationship does.

Imitarlo es acarrearnos la amistad de Jehova, y libres de disturbio estaremos, pues si leemos la biblia y meditamos, analizaremos como aplicarla en la vida. = Sabios.   El inters espiritual y las diferencias de personalidad    4 Nuestro inters espiritual en los dems aumenta cuando aplicamos personalmente el conocimiento de la verdad bblica y aprendemos a seguir el ejemplo de Jesucristo. (1?Pedro 2:21.) Como cristianos verdaderos, desechamos la vieja personalidad que se conforma a nuestra manera de proceder anterior y nos esforzamos por reemplazarla con la nueva personalidad que fue creada conforme a la voluntad de Dios en verdadera justicia y lealtad. (Efesios 4:22-24.) As, el volvernos con bondad y consideracin hacia los dems va reemplazando poco a poco nuestras actitudes egostas. (Isaas 65:25.)    5 Aunque entre el pueblo de Jehov hay quienes han hecho sobresalientes cambios en su personalidad, todava quedan tendencias pecaminosas. Hasta Pablo reconoci: Cuando deseo hacer lo que es correcto, lo que es malo est presente conmigo. (Romanos 7:21.) Por supuesto, existen otras caractersticas heredadas o adquiridas, y estas nos identifican. Algunos tienen talento artstico; otros, un enfoque analtico. Mientras que unos son callados y reservados, otros son sociables y comunicativos. Entonces, ?cmo se puede mantener la unidad de la congregacin cristiana aunque existan esas diferencias de personalidad?|`|454c4f7a7117d2098d6ab001c8ac5c55aa	mi mejor ejemplo  es mi patrn  y amigo tamvien yo lo almiro mucho y me  gustara ser como el al gun dia  es muy inteligente|`|shKBfJbJaa	Todo depende de la edad que tengas para poder hacer una eleccin ya que en el transcurso de la vida la admiracin o el ejemplo a seguir es multifactorial ya que puedes admirar cosas ambiguas.

Pero Jack no se qued as, l quiso mejorar y obtuvo la Licenciatura en Drama en la Universidad de Stanford (una de las ms exitosas de E. U.). Con mucho esfuerzo obtuvo su primer papel y as vinieron los otros, hasta que personific al villano en la pelcula legendaria del oeste Shane. Fue nominado para el oscar al mejor actor de reparto. Jack hizo muchas pelculas no slo en su pas sino tambin en el extranjero. EN 1958 hizo en Mxico la pelcula "Flor de Mayo" al lado de Mara Flix, en la cual habla un perfecto espa?ol. Jack hablaba 6 idiomas: ingles, espa?ol, ruso, ucraniano, italiano y francs. Enlos a?os 70 grab su nico disco en el que inclua 12 canciones estilo country, una voz linda y original. En los 90's recibi por fin el oscar al mejor actor de reparto por City Slickers, un oscar muy merecido, asombrosamente, a la edad de 73 a?os Jack hizo gala de sus habilidades fsicas e hizo una serie de lagartijas con una sola mano, dejando boquiabiertos a todos los presentes. En 1996, Jack publica el libro de su vida escrito en poemas, "The forest of love" narra la historia de un hombre que nace, se enamora de una mujer y de la naturaleza, de desilusiona pero luego vuelve a renacer. Es un hermoso libro que est adornado de bellas pinturas hechas por Jack.   Pero no todo era felicidad para Jack, soport la muerte de su hijo Cody, quin muri de cncer.   Jack hizo todo lo que quiso hacer, fue una persona llena de talento, extraordinaria, valiente, increble. ?Quin no recuerda a Jack en la serie Aunque usted no lo crea? con esa voz tan profunda, esa personalidad arrolladora, esa sonrisa pcara y ese 1.93 de estatura, creo que nadie que haya sabido de l lo podra olvidar. Yo quisiera ser as, con tantos talentos, tan luchador, tan fuerte y tener un espritu que trasciende ms all de la muerte.|`|bKD2oemqaa	mis padres,Dios y los ni?os|`|2KgIWv4qaa	a jesus|`|k7PLCr7Zaa	INDISCUTIBLE MENTE A MIS PADRES, PERO TAMBIN HAY PERSONAS CON UNA CONDUCTA EJEMPLAR DIGNOS DE CONSIDERARLAS COMO UN EJEMPLO PARA NOSOTROS, PERO HAY UNA PERSONA EN ESPECIAL Y MUY IMPORTANTE PARA MI QUE ES EL SE?OR JESUCRISTO LA MANERA COMO LLEVO SU VIDA, LA HUMILDAD QUE MOSTR PARA CON SU PADRE LA OBEDIENCIA Y LA SABIDURA QUE TUVO PARA PODER DESEMPE?AR EL TRABAJO QUE LE ENCOMEND SU PADRE ES DE ELOGIAR Y ES EL MEJOR EJEMPLO A SEGUIR.|`|pKBDzt7Naa	AVRIL LAVINGE|`|4d9fd309912590530f696c3e482012f7aa	Definitivo!!! yo soy mi mejor ejemplo a seguir... entre mejor me sienta conmigo mismo, y con los dems podr demostrarme  que puedo salir adelante sin problemas, que puedo ser mejor persona, que amo lo que tengo es suficiente.

Instead, open yourself up to new relationships with new people.  Don't obsess over this one friendship.  Plus, it will be healthy if you get a girlfriend.  Just make sure you can think of your girlfriend as a friend too.|`|Ao6bRRWUaa	Honestly girls dont realize what we have til we lose it and the day you act all hard on her thats when she will think and question herself.She has a good friend already which is you and it seems to be that you are falling in love with this girl and you ,yourself may not have realized yet.If I were you ,I just back up a little and make sure you play sort of the bad guy instead of the nice guy alot.Instead of saying to her when she gets hurt by other guys,stuff like oh Im sorry,be more like it seems like your attracted to jerks because a nice guy would fall for you instantly.....Also keep it real and stop telling her that where does it leave you becausse shes only going to think your a weirdo and make her feel uncomfortable towards you,I know I would especially because of all the stuff you see on t.v towards jeolous men so you dont wanna show her you're the jelous type.Let her decide on her own who she wants without you trying to make her feel like you are butthurt,just be the friend you are and listen to her.

It is best for you to just forget about those two and do not let it stress you. When you meet people, do not think of them in a shallow sense. Try to find nice people. Find people that are smart, and funny. It shows strong character (usually) if someone has a good sense of humor at a young age. You will see all kinds of boys like them growing up, and eventually you will be keen enough to spot them a mile away. You will find a lot of people that are more worthy of your time also. Trust me, it gets better.

d8b8e867453af896356fee188419c979aa	You should feel good about yourself then just dieting to lose 22 pounds. Look I am a +size girl and I love what I look like. Its fine to grow with a little weight. Just do not diet because you may never know what they put into these things.     Okay I will tell you this you can eat salads, bake things, & exercise about 30 min to 1 hour. You should not try to impress people for them to like you. Be confendence about yourself to talk to people. I think that they just want to see you look bad about yourself to make them look good. Do what you really think its right but I just say eat salads, baking goods and exercisefor about 30 mintues to an hour everyday. Eat less sugar and tryed fat free food and maybe sugarless food, its good.    People is just looking for someone to make them popular not yourself. I think that you should worry about school and getting yourself in a good college in the near future. Go for an honor student, try activities after school or help people when they need help on homework that will make yourself popular on things that you are good at not the way you look, you look fine the way you are. I do not think that God will like what you are doing to yourself to make you look like you are popular in school.|`|i7PHbzj6aa	you are 13 and should not be dieting. I am slightly older than you. I am 5'2 and 128 pounds. If you don't feel comfortable in the skin that you are in, then change it in a positive way by picking up a sport and not spending a lot of time indoors. Dieting can cause MAJOR health problems so be careful. And becoming more popular isn't always what it is cracked up to be all the time. It can be very stressful and dramatic and you don't really need more pressure when you are in middle or high school. But you do what you think is best for you. Losing 22 pounds will make you way to skinny and at the very most you should lose 5-10 pounds. But you should do this in a healthy manner. Please.
gEDhYDCdaa	well get to know her first. Because a lot has changed since grade school. and don't worry about what other ppl think because i did that in middle school and i regret it. because this really nice guy that  had a crush on me is really nice and i turned him down and now when i look at him i wonder what it would've been like. and i asked him out and he said no because he only thought that i felt sorry for him...so go for it!|`|HgK0HN4aaa	if you're that young i dont know really if it matters!

C8k1NIQXaa	a woman is like a flower, if you don't water it and look after it, it won't blossom.

With a bit of encouragement, you and her can work through losing weight, sensibly of course. Excercise, healthy, low-fat diet, the usual. The sudden weight gain seems a bit suspicious to me though, maybe you two should go to a GP to see if there's anything particular that has triggered the weight gain. Otherwise, if all fails, just love her for who she is.  Good luck!|`|da22441c7a71c4502d56f45a4c64f3ccaa	hey talk to her some times girls gain wieght as some thing is bothering them or it could also be a pain thing its hard i know but guys through that to but dont worrie just talk to her be there for her and if you can get her to go to the counceller ok just try it bye and good luck just stick bye her|`|rhr9wt6Baa	exercise WITH her?    when you go out to eat order healthy dishes?     encourage her to eat well also?    there are lot of things you can do without being harsh    ...that's tough though... good luck!|`|52a7926763692c156116ddc768c670bcaa	Something happened to her.

gBRJ0bq3aa	Obviously you are on drugs . That is one dumb F****** question|`|691aa7505ee49411cc338b43264b06e5aa	Depends on who you ask.  The pharmaceutical industry is one of the largest classes of manufacturers ($600 billion in 2006).  The United States still accounts for most, with $252 billion in annual sales. U.S. Sales grew 5.7 percent.  There are about 100,000 sales reps contacting prescribers and drug companies spent about $5 billion dollars on sales.    The thing is, big pharma only wants you to take the drugs they can make a profit from.  So they persuaded the government to make all other self-prescribed substances illegal.  So the "War on Drugs" was undertaken.  In 2005, more than $45 billion was spent on arresting, trying and incarcerating offenders of drug laws.  Because of the "war on drugs", 1 out of 35 Americans is under the control of the Criminal Justice System.  The average sentence for a first time, non-violent drug offender is longer than the average sentence for rape, child molestation, bank robbery or manslaughter.     Every year, 8,000 to 14,000 people die from illegal drugs in this country. Every year, over 500,000 people die from legal drugs (Tobacco, liquor and prescriptions).    Like the "war on terror" the "war on drugs" is a war that the US government wages against its own citizens.|`|fKltcE4Kaa	which drug?

You may have or think you are having fun the first time that you try them if you live thru the trip.  But as time goes on with continual usage, just keep looking in the mirror and check out how your face starts to look.  Best thing is , take a picture when you start, and take another when you know you've been beat by the drugs. Prescription drugs should always be assigned to you by a Dr.|`|hnItHP6yaa	Everyone needs to chill out.  Maybe this person wasn't taught properly about drugs.  Chill.  It's better for them to ask, then for them to not know what's wrong about it and do drugs.  The least you could do is help out and not be jerks about it.      Yes. Drugs impair your thoughts and judgements. They are also illegal.  You don't want to get involved with drugs.  If you do, you will be hurting the rest of your life.  If you have ANY dream of going to college or having a good life, don't do drugs.  If you are caught with drugs, it goes on your record.  Job employers will see it and not want to hire you.  You could die from using drugs.  Your life and the lives of people who care about you will be ruined.  So if you are thinking about doing drugs at all, DON'T.  You are just ruining your life.  And if you or someone you know is doing drugs, help them.  Even thought you might not want to admit it, you have a problem and people really do want to help you. Talk to someone.  Even though they will be mad at you for telling on them, in the long run, you are really saving them and helping them out.  :)|`|miCUR6uAaa	I agree! If you never ask, you will never know. Yeah, drugs are bad, and they can really ruin your life. Drugs impairs your judgement, screws up your relationships, and lowers your health. Drugs can kill you, and it they make you addicted forever. It is really hard to get off of drugs. However, there are support groups for drug addicts that helps them get off of drugs. I know a couple of recovered drug addicts, and they are really good friends of mine. Drugs are bad, and they will ruin you.|`|lNRdmEcfaa	Depending on the drug and how well you control yourself.

Yo creo que no debes ser tan dura, todos cometemos un error y no es una mentira de wow, me minti, fue una mentira que en nada afecta a la relacin en s, una mentira grande hubiera sido que te dijera que se iba a X y se fuera con otra....amiga deja esa actitud de generala, de controladora (porque lo noto en eso de haberlo ESPIADO y aparte controlarle en eso de fumar porque por algo te minti) que puedes perderlo.|`|znjbgyhCaa	mira mamita lo que tienes que hacer es que si el te esta mintiendo pues diiiicelo en la cara ponle las cartas sobre la mesa los hombres de por siii son embusteros si te dijo esa mentirita me imagino lo que no te ha dicho. asi que enfrentalo habla con el y si no funciona pues mandalo para el mas alla. cuidate.|`|557z8BCxaa	te voy a dar un consejo bien sabio , puede que tu novio te haya mentido pero no es para que te enojes porque si lo pensas bien es  una cosa sin imprtancia que haya fumado y te haya dicho que no , ( o fuma porro?? ahi la cosa sies peor ..) yo te diria que no te enojes , mejor no digas nada porque si te pones pesada por el hecho de que fume no te va a durar mnucho el noviazgo , mejor preocupate o enojate por cosas que en verdad valgan la pena y sean  importantes para su relacion , no lo canses con tonteras porque las personas nos cansamos cuando nuestras parejas nos hacen problemas por estupideces , es un consejo de mujer a mujer ok ? espero que te sirva porque va con la mejor de las ondas , beso.|`|plkTYTVZaa	Es algo que tenes que lidiar, preocupate mas bien en acercarte mas a el y tu tienes todas las armas para hacerlo no estoy muy convencido de que ya con dos anios de estar juntos no hayas logrado ser su confidente, realmente estas dandole confianza y libertad de opinion? digo aqui tiene que haber una "democracia" porque asi como esperas que el sea sincero debe de haber igualdad en ambas partes, me parece que te estas concentrando en algo muy pequenio, te digo que en este mundo siempre existiran "mentiras piadosas" porque aunque la persona intente dejar de hacer algo siempre tendra sus recaidas y es bochornoso estarle diciendo a su pareja que no puede dejar de fumar, tomar, etc.. asi que tienes que comprender esto, deber lidiar con los problemas y no escabullirte lo siento pero asi es la vida.  Animo !!    Saludos.|`|TsOFCIPMaa	Yo en tu lugar hablaria con el y le diria que no quieres una mentira mas, y que si va a seguir siendo asi contigo, ocultandote tonterias y no teniendo plena confianza que no te interesa seguir con el, ahi, si tu realmente le interesas te dira que por favor no le dejes que va a cambiar, entonces tu sigue con el y como veas una mas, le dejas y no des mas opcion a seguir, explicale que no es normal que con el tiempo que llevais juntos no confie en ti lo que deberia y que tu no te sientes segura porque si te miente por tonterias, imaginate las cosas importantes.. hazle entender eso.. espero que salga bien la cosa.. te deseo suerte y sobre todo ten las cosas claras, mira como sera estar con una persona asi siempre.. tu y todo el mundo se merece estar con alguien en quien pueda confiar y haya sinceridad que es de las cosas basicas para mantener una relacion|`|3qKCVs5Oaa	mientele vos,..|`|8pmyP8zXaa	Si odias la mentira, porqu te estas mintiendo a t misma saliendo con alguin que no va con tu forma de ser y corrompe tus principios?|`|467bf7d600739d3cbbb198b5f8aa4ff3aa	?Odias la mentira y, sin embargo, te metes en el correo de tu novio, lo expones en internet, y an encima te haces la victima?

Pero no vuelvas hacer lo que hiciste de entrar donde no puedes entrar. Cuando tienes tus cosas significa que nadie puede invadir tu privacidad as yo comunique, comente, diga lo que no te digo a ti de forma directa, ya que te conozco bien y te va a molestar que fume. Por lo tanto analiza adecuadamente cada paso antes de dar el primero, en ocasiones nos equivocamos en nuestras apreciaciones y procedemos por instinto afectando nuestras relaciones que parecen ya son lo suficientemente maduras. Hazlo con tacto, logrars el xito.

af05e79a32105d192831efe2e95bc13daa	Since this girl is so out of hand, if I were you, I would go on with my life.  Get involved with things you are interested in.  Maybe after school activities.  Talk to your mom about this situation.  You could start doing more things with her if you like.  It is impossible to change other people.  So don't waste your time.  She has chosen her path.  Time for you to choose your own path.  I know you can do it.  You sound like a caring, smart young lady.|`|5ZajLSyWaa	Just give her friendly advice either she accepts it or not what's important you did your best to help her so that you don't have any guilt feelings that you didn't help her somehow since she's your co-girl scouts and seat mate at the bus.|`|GhTkAWERaa	honesty is the best way to solve things.. take it easy and tell her the way you like it to be . dont worry how her feelings will be after you tell her  coz at the end ur the right 1

Y si, tienes razon, el cliche es que el hombre, si comete un error hay que crucificarlo pero si es una mujer la infiel, entonces se dice que esta "liberada" o es una mujer actual. Para mi, si una mujer no sabe admitir sus errores, no vale la pena.|`|Ggo8dGRpaa	Esto pasa porque muchas de las razones que usan no son validas y por eso se ven como machistas. Es mejor decir porque si lo quise hacer que venir con un cuento. Son muy malos explicando. No todos apoyan las mujeres.pero si creo en las disculpas si se hace algo equivocado y no premeditado.

Suerte!!!!|`|TGAfl8wFaa	Pues porque a los hombres la sociedad les ense?a a ser correctos y caballerosos, asi sea el mas bago y maquil hasta el mas pudiente, casi siempre se respeta a la lmujer, en cambio ella, solo piensa, hasta estas fechas en mantener a los hijos y tener sexo, aunque digan las feministas y las que apoyaneesos movimientos que no, eso sigue en el mundo y por mucho tiempo mas.  Ademas no creas todo lo que leas.  Y lo de las mujeres, pues porque se supone que son debiles e insignificantes y nececitan del cuidado de otro. Aunque nada de esto es cierto, solo es invento de la sociedad, para mantenernos en control, si no, que seria del mundo...  Por lo general, los hombres se disculpan y se justifican, porque son los que quieren llevar el poder, y las mujeres "dicen" son mas egoistas, para mi que si-  Mi novia me ha hecho un chingo de jaladas y nunca me ha dado una disculpa...es muy orgullosa, al igual que muchas de mis amigas, mi mama, y hermanas, familia...  creo que las mujeres solo reciben discupas, ademas porque segun las odemos lastimar mas facilmente, aunque aveces los hombre son tan fragiles que se rompen, pero nadie se da cuenta, porque lo saben ocultar, pues el hombre debe ser valiente, fuerte y guapo...|`|9adc403fbc39c9d002c8d66d82099f1baa	HOLA RAYITO !!!        creo que esmas difiocil para los hombres y mas cuando estan cerks de sus amigos o aun ma si estan frente a los chavos que se creen la gran cosa y no dan nanais de paraguay y pues las mujeres es como que tenemos como que mas corazon ocea mas sencilles
4AEpZOLBaa	It means he's a jerk.  A sick jerk and it worries me that he is hanging around your brothers.      A six year age difference is not a big deal - if one person is 24 and the other is 30.  But 19 and 13.  No!  That is just bad, bad news.    I would not allow yourself to be alone with this guy.  He sounds like he is going to try to get you by yourself at some time, and hit on you.      If he keeps it up, talk to your brothers and your parents.  Let them know that it isn't right and you aren't comfortable with him around.      It doesn't matter if he is just 'Teasing' you or not... he's bad news.|`|5onxl5dHaa	He is just kidding around with you.

AA10276301	tell your friend how you feel. they should understand. if they are your friend.|`|52a7926763692c156116ddc768c670bcaa	Your friend is worried about you.  He's expressing his love.  When people do that, sometimes we can be a little bit pushy.  It may be that being pushed is making you resist social settings even more.    If you moved to where your friend is, you might want to try agreeing to go out and do something with him in a setting that provides opportunities to meet people.  What I mean is, if you go out, you don't have to meet people, and if you meet people, you don't have to try to date.  You could be his wingman.    If you didn't move to where your friend is, you might want to try opening up to him about your feelings.  Let him know that you want to move on, but that you want to move on in the right direction.  If you know of any other ways that he can help besides encouraging you to start dating again, let him know about those at the same time.

hnItHP6yaa	You don't want to dump your boyfriend for this guy because your current boyfriend is going to trash talk you behind your back for dumping him to go out with another guy.  If you love your boyfriend, don't dump him for another guy.

Think of it that way.|`|xrqHG6Veaa	Just keep your current boyfriend.     If you and Jack already broke up, there is not really a guarrentee that it will work out the second time around.|`|blvZkEjUaa	if you loved him, you wouldnt think of dumping him for your ex.
IxKbA67Jaa	Um mayb, if you liked her you should have gone! Well as you can tell i'm a girl and i dont usually sign love Nikki at the end of my emails if i dont like him, and i also dont freak out on a guy when they dont come to my party if i dont like like them. I'd say there's a 60% chance she likes you. then again she might have just been geing friendly. But i'd still say 60% chance... that help?|`|jFS6OQgAaa	i donot know about her .but u love her|`|ZFec5zhRaa	seems like she wanted you to be there...  try getting to know her better. Ask her out on a date|`|hnItHP6yaa	To be honest, she was probably just being friendly.  Sorry to burst any hopes you have, but it doesn't really seem like she's flirting with you.  Just being nice.   If you like her, talk to her more often.  Message online, hang out with her, talk on the phone.  That way you two can get to know her better.

Px8Vrjgsaa	well my boyfriend is in the army and has been since he was 18 .. he's gone to afganistan and come home safely .. he has never even come close to dying .. it is a good career choice because it's guarenteed pay even if you're sick or on vacation and they pay for one trip home a year.  If this is what really interests him he's going to do it regardless .. there are hundreds of trades in the army it's not just a bunch of soldiers on the front line .. you can be a fire fighter, a refueler, truck driver, mechanic .. lots of things and it will teach him some organization and discipline and they also have to do physical training on a regular basis so he'll be healthy.  P.S. They will also pay for any schooling he wants to do ..|`|52a7926763692c156116ddc768c670bcaa	Is he right about not having a future in your town?

Try as much as possible that your appearance is attractive...      2)The way of treatment  you must deal with her very softly...you must make her feel that she is Queen   you must make her to feel that you don't see any girls even her and that you can do anything for her  and that by telling her sweety words(but it must be really from your heart to reach to her heart)...and to phone her contiously that will make her to feel that you want her and don't want to stay without her.      3)loyalty  you must be very loyal to her and to be honiste with her and never lie to her because if you lie and your lover know that you lie it will be very big thing that will make her not believe you in all things  Good luck,..

wnV3klNxaa	Primeiramente, como assim pessoa de cor? Pelo o que vc est nos contando amiga, vc  racista. Desculpe estar te julgando,mas vc  racista e vou te explicar porque:    Pq vc n?o falou diretamente que a pessoa que vc est gostando  um *****? E falou pessoa "DE COR"    E pq vc n?o tem coragem de contar as suas amigas que vc est a fim de um *****? Naturalmente elas s?o t?o ou mAIS preconceituosas do que vc.    Por favor,n?o estou aqui pra te dar li??o de moral ou querer te esculachar, mas como NEGRA, SER HUMANO (como vc), posso te dar uns toques:    Gostar de algum sendo preta,branca,amarelo,vermelho,verde,etc n?o faz mal a ng, afinal somos todos iguais! Por acaso ser ***** faz mal?  Vou te colocar aqui 2 situa??es e qro que me responda:  Vc prefere namorar um ***** que corresponda s suas expectativas e que est numa faculdade,tem um futuro brilhante e que tem a te oferecer, principalmente INTELIGENCIA,CULTURA e EDUCA??O ou vc prefere namorar a cpia do Brad Pitt mas que  no fundo  um ladr?o,drogado, que pode meter a m?o na sua cara na frente de qualquer pessoa e o pior,n?o quer nada com estudos?  Me responda!  Ent?o minha amiga, seja INTELIGENTE e diga N?O AO PRECONCEITO RACIAL!!!!  N?o ligue pra o que suas amigas v?o pensar (elas s?o umas idiotas,patricinhas,burras e n?o sabem o que  e como  MARAVILHOSO namorar um neg?o minha filha!!!!), o importante  que vc gosta dele!!!  E c entre ns, vc branquinha,bonitinha ao lado de um neg?o vc vai fazer a diferen?a por ser inteligente, ser contra o preconceito e vai ser feliz pq os ****** s?o timos amantes!!!

f4061abd5bc8d6c519f8aa9ffd26e55baa	My first suggestion is don't leave because of that. I went away to school a few years ago and i had felt the way you are right now my first couple of weeks. I didn't know the area, i didn't have a car, no one was talking to me, i did everything on my own. Then, i started to take advantage of diff activities for school and just forced myself to talk to people more before or after class. One girl that i decided to sit next to one day i am still friends with now, three years later. Just be patient, you'll make friends there when you least expect it.

Tienes que estar conciente que mujeres hay muchas, unas ms bonitas, jvenes, llamativas y sexis si quieres, pero solo hay UNA MUJER, la tuya. la que no es de nadie ms, la que escogiste para vivir la vida a su lado, la madre de tus hijos, te pregunto qu tanto estas dispuesto a perder, mejor dedcate a la conquista diaria de tu mujer, eso es mas emocionante, a veces damos por sentado lo que tenemos, pero eso se puede perder tambin, una vez perdida la confianza todo cambia.|`|GELTDUAuaa	No podia faltar.

Hay un momento en la vida, en que comprendes que ha llegado el tiempo de cambiar, y si no lo haces, nada jams podr cambiar.  Comprendes que si al fracasar, no tienes el coraje de comenzar de nuevo, la vida seguir sin ti.  La dicha no nos acompa?a siempre y nuestra vida a veces se torna diferente de lo que nos imaginamos.  No siempre nuestros das brindan lo que esperamos.  Sin comprender por qu, a veces toman rumbos tan imprevisibles que ni en tus sue?os se hubieran asomado. Pero igual, si no te animas a escoger un camino, o a realizar un sue?o, ests en gran peligro de vagar sin rumbo y perderte. Ms bien que preguntarte con mil ansias por qu tu vida se ha tornado como es ahora, acepta el camino abierto que te espera.    Olvdate de lo que fue, no te confundas. Eso ya pas. Slo el presente importa. El pasado es ya una ilusin, y el futuro todava no existe. Pero vivimos hoy. Mide tus pasos uno a uno, sin perder la fe, guardando tu valor y confianza.  Con tu frente alta, no temas so?ar, ni mirar las estrellas.  Un poco ms de paciencia, tu vigor volver y encontrars tu va.

Si nos dieramos cuenta que existe un Dios que siempre esta de nuestro lado entonces llegaramos a superar eso que sentimos. En realidad nunca estamos solas, siempre hay familiares y amigos que estn all para ayudarnos cuando lo nesecitamos, la soledad la construye uno mismo, ese aislamiento es algo que cada persona crea. Pero lo ms importante es darnos cuanta que si sentimos estar solas, es porque as lo hemos predeterminado nosotras mismas. La verdad, la plata no nos hace felices, eso es un mito. La felicidad no viene con uno, sino, uno es quin toma la decisin de construirla. Amiga, date cuenta que s tienes quin te ame, y si ests en este mundo es no solo porque fue una coincidencia, sino porque as le placi a Dios que fuera.  Eres una perla preciada ante sus ojos, y talvez aunque no lo creas eres nica y sobresaliente.

Tell him you want to move back out and that he can call when he wants to see you and you will come over, but that you arent ready to live with somone who is goign to ignore you for long periods of time.  the least he could do is offer for you to tag along even if you arent goign to smoke...|`|kXhAERt3aa	No way!  He is a total jerk.  His flat-mate is not man enough to be left alone in the evening?  He is just shoving it in your face that he could care less about how you feel - he is really being rude!  What kind of man needs "alone" time with his flat-mate while his woman is in another room?  That is just not realistic - he is playing you emotionally.  You are not some blow-up doll!  You are a woman, and if he wants something from you, he better treat you like one.  Find a man who will be overjoyed to have you with him, not this loser.|`|CrgCfQ8Qaa	let him go obviously he cares more about his frtiedn than u and thats rong that he ekft u there....|`|gEyB7BJdaa	you need to find someone eals|`|SQIulOVwaa	LEAVEEE!!! leave leave leave.

I had a bf who i use to sleep the night at, he has a friend too, but the only difference, i was in there like a dirty shirt, drinking and smoking dope, his friend actually became mine because i was there so much, I use to go to bed before him and he would come later on. He probably wonders why you are just sitting in the room by yourself as well? go see him, or leave. I agree, he should be somewhat more hospitable......but he is a man, so dont be surprised.....|`|FISFvqqVaa	thats not fair at all you better go have a talk|`|AA10839619	He's using you. Leave. Now.

En la cama todo vale, asi como el te pide cosas, tu tambien puedes pedirselas, tal vez solo por diversion pidele que baile para ti y tu le das un premio o cosas asi... el sexo no es solo hacerlo por todos los agujeros posibles, es disfrutar un gran momento con tu pareja.

7IfDCQilaa	If someone cheats dat means der not happy w/ who der w/. Jus cuz u say or act like ur happy doesnt mean dat u r happy. It's a addiction wen ur not happy u try to look 4 happiness sum were else. Ppl dnt break up w/ der partners cuz dey dont want to hurt em so dey jus cheat which makes it more hurtful for da 1 dat got cheated on. But actually dey should've so dey wouldnt hurt der partner worser den dey did.|`|74dfe88a8f1e71d7a25d52b249b4cf5eaa	You are really trying to make this complicated.Cheating is LUST.I don't mean to make it sound like a bad thing but it is centered on the person that is cheating and is totally excluding the other person in the relationship.If you can't keep you sex exclusive, then you are not ready for a monogamous relationship.If you regret what has happened and you intend to stop screwing about then stop , but don't tell the other person just to make yourself feel better.You will be only adding to your own mess and making a bigger mess for some one that is Innocent.Suffer on your own,you did it ,you live with it.|`|qGKnHbtzaa	You know it really depends on the situation... I mean example, youre in a relationship and you love your bf/gf but he/she doesnt exactly feel the same way... then you have the tendency to cheat and find someone whos gonna make you feel loved...    but in most usual situations, it is simply because NOBODY IS PERFECT. We all have this sort of requirement in finding someone to be attractive however we find ourselves to be in loved with someone who doesnt possess all those requirements or just completely opposite to what we expected. So, SOMETIMES eventually we find ourselves to be not contended and look for someone who has some of those requirements. To be more specific, lets say your an anime lover and your bf is not... you might find yourself attracted to someone who is also an anime lover. Or lets say your sexually active and no matter how much effort you gave in trying to pass some lust to your loved one he is still not interested, so you might look to someone who can satisfy you sexually...    However, I still believe that cheating is never a possibility if the love is genuine. but still, nobodys perfect!.. well never know...    whew!.. thats pretty long. LOL.

It's not in my character, I'm a one man woman if I'm with someone then I'm only with them. I despise cheaters; I feel like why try to be in a relationship with someone if you want to do your thing.

D47AOjVSaa	You can't exactly have a relationship last FOREVER, my friend... unless you're married.    But I'm sure you can have tips on being in a healthy, committed relationship. So here you go!      -You should be HONEST and OPEN with your significant other... that pretty much takes out of the question of the both of you cheating and lying in your relationship.    -Have a physical AND emotional connection with your significant other... not all relationships are about hugging, kissing, making out, having sex, etc. With a relationship comes the bond and emotional attachment you have with that other person.    -Do nice things for each other once in a while... even if your gifts might not exactly be the best, it's always "the thought that counts". Everyone likes getting things.    -See each other, of course...! This one is pretty much self-explanitory, but you don't want to make seeing this person excessive. People are busy sometimes, so don't assume he/she doesn't care for you anymore if they can't see you as much as you would like. It's called building anticipation; you don't see each other as much so when you finally do, the experience is magical.    I'm not exactly the expert on relationships, but this is all I could come up with. Good luck!|`|kyTDQEWaaa	Don't be jealous, controlling, nosy about where your partner is every minute, don't be brutally honest, don't criticize, compliment once a day, no more, no less, remember birthdays and anniversaries, an occasional nice surprise of some kind is always good, don't lie, don't cheat, don't be selfish, don't be needy and high maintenance.   On the fllip side, don't enable them to be needy, selfish or treat you badly in any way.  Expect to be treated the same way you treat them.        and most important....don't hog the remote.|`|0Pf6yvhwaa	trust, honesty, communication!!! be LOYALLLLLLL|`|AA10198825	Don't Cheat.|`|dvevk1qbaa	Dont try and waste time with someone who is not right for you, first off.    2nd- everyone is different.

SOme people need space and that freaks them out and makes them feel trapped    3rd...make sure your sexual relationship is good, and you both are happy.    and last but not least DONT feel the need to always talk. Seriously. I have heard people say that , that are married 40 years and I agree    Girls ramble....a lot. Call your friend and go blah blah blah to her instead.    ***If you are with the right person a lie or a cheat can be worked through. I know. I have been with someone 8 years and he has cheated and I did as well in the beginning, when we were teens. we worked through it and are better than ever|`|lo2EZR3Qaa	dont lie or cheat!|`|AyP3KlKdaa	You both have to agree that you will be committed to each other no matter what.  This is usually what people say when they get married, but I guess they don't really mean it.  I think people have a very low threshold of pain, or they don't understand that the other person is just as human as themselves.  If they get hurt a few times that they quit.  You've got to go into the relationship understanding that things will not always be easy, but be committed to sticking it out, NO MATTER WHAT.
W7Lmwl0Maa	You might be a redneck if you pee outside on your first date.|`|AA11280073	Was he raised by ignorant people? I would be totally turned off by such gross public behavior. How can you stand to be around him?|`|vKrWrhQeaa	for only 2 dates...i'd say it's pretty rude|`|vj2pWs9Maa	Well, 2 dates is a bit soon for him to be peeing in front of you.  I'd think that was a little rude myself!|`|b8LM28bVaa	LOL...it seems that he just does anything he feels like doing,be care ful with this one.|`|FarsCSY1aa	I think it's just a guy thing. Maybe there wasn't a bathroom around and he just had to go. If there was one nearby, though, I do think it's kind of rude. But I'm still going to assume that the nearest restroom was too far for him to make it, in which case, it's fine.|`|jVOapeKVaa	Wow your first boyfriend...seriously?? Ok ok I guess i can buy that. Usually when a guy does that he just feels comfortable around you. Only problem is, this is not suppose to come until much later in the relationship (like 6 or 7 months down the relationship, or at least until you feel comfortable with everything in front of him, whichever comes first). The fact that he's doing this so early may just be his way or just who he is. It is kind of unruly to do this early though, and very unsanitary. I mean c'mon, tell the guy to find a bathroom.|`|8bISKi4maa	ahahaahah,. no its just a guy thing|`|Ol2S1ZiMaa	No, that's showing he's comfortable in front of you. But if it bothers you tell him not to pee in front of you. If he likes you he'll understand.|`|iKJycf6Zaa	It's just a guy thing.   No big deal.|`|Iws6kykqaa	I personally think it's rude.. and unclassy.  If you feel uncomfortable with it, I would tell him now before he turns into a complete slob.|`|hGFVyMCzaa	As a guy, peeing outside is such a freedom. You don't have to worry about aiming. Just peeing. That's it. He's probably in the zone like most guys when he pees outside.|`|TR69skqaaa	well..yes it is a man's thing..but if he at least said "excuse me"..I'll be back....is ok...but if he did it..without saying a word....I find it disrespectful  to you!!..so tell him ..to mind his manners.|`|X86pV6whaa	um....that's gross. really, and it sounds like he doesn't care if you see anything so he is gunna want sex sometime in the relationship. that really is the god honest truth, sorry.|`|KfX1z8hOaa	If you gotta go you gotta go. And yes men do this all the time|`|AA10198825	What he did was a "Bum" thing.|`|SQFLShvhaa	Are you dating a dog? Like who does that it's not normal and is grounds for dismissal.|`|yINAiYDDaa	Haha...yes, that's gross. |`|fyQzcQmUaa	uh thats pretty nasty. i'd say rude. come on you're on a date. -_-|`|XQiEWIEuaa	I don't think it's rude or disrespectful, but it is kind of weird that he is not at all bothered by peeing in public (I'm assuming he's not drunk). Just try to go on dates that you are inside I guess.|`|DHuYuzQ1aa	It's not a guy thing. He's crude and rude and a thoughtless dude.|`|0tDMAigJaa	That's disgusting...if he's being that disrespectful after 2 dates, imagine what he'll be like later.....|`|TdtswfEhaa	It's a guy thing... Once you are together for awhile he will openly talk about pooping and then eventually leave the door open like you want to join him there or something.      Been with my hubby for 5 years... He does it, not a big deal, Gross, but a guy thing. I don't really care anymore... If it bothers you, you can ask him to stop. I'm sure he will. :)|`|2Gn62iq4aa	I don't think it's rude, he must have had to pee really bad haha so bad that he could not run far enough so you would not have to see him pee. |`|a5SIZIOZaa	Even if it is a "man thing", that is something one might do infront of guys, NOT INFRONT OF GIRLS, espc. a girlfriend.  Look, I can tell by your posting this that you don't think he was right indoing so, so please, for yourself, just talk to him and say " I didn't like that", "can you please change"|`|h5zI7Y1qaa	Well first off, I could consider you "dating" not him being your boyfriend, but thats just me. It is up to you, do you consider it rude? If so it is... If we were outside for a long time and there were no bathrooms anywhere near... I wouldn't care.|`|60893567bc9f752607bdc130593050a7aa	After 2 dates it seems kind of rude, but if you gotta go then you gotta go!   Next time you feel the urge just drop trow and see what he says.|`|haWw3B8aaa	Its not wrong, its just different. Its all about how YOU feel about it. The girls I party with do this all the time. Well  some of the girls do anyways.|`|NxN6V1Qvaa	aha.  im only 14   and guys pee when im around all the time. but friends.  but i dont see anything:)  ha.  but i would say its a guy thing..  haha....          help me please:)  http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...|`|06c2b2bf8d25233ed0327b25ec9921e0aa	well it makes me feel better that you got your first boyfriend at age 23, and yet I am 20, never had a girlfriend yet.|`|6LPKBA4Oaa	ever wonder why stairwells always smell like piss?    I believe this is why.|`|hHdLUhSlaa	i think hes gonna rape u if hes 22 and ur 13   thats just wrong    srry 4 butting into ur love life|`|C14wHIhOaa	if he was drunk.... no not rude at all    if there was a bathroom very close by maybe     there are far more rude things he could do|`|YNnERhWmaa	Don't make it bigger than it needs to be..he's a guy and he's comfortable enough around you to take a piss|`|TYKgtNSsaa	Its a guy thing, don't worry about it.|`|n7paZ60Eaa	YIKES! thats rude!!!  Come on.. more respect for a lady!   if u have been only on 2 dates with him.. pls later tell me what he does on the 10th!!|`|5thoIUAhaa	WELL...  AND THIS MAY BE COMPLETELY WRONG  BUT MAYBE HE IS TRYING TO SHOW YOU WHAT HE IS WORKING WITH WITHOUT REALLY SHOWING YOU.....    IDK...  GOOD LUCK THO!! |`|qlOLgSVsaa	well personally i think it all depends on how he was raised.. If he was raised in that fashion you cant blame him for doing it. right?
tppgTqj3aa	Me are good friend but no Indian is of my blood. |`|AYNhZJxyaa	i know your new, but..ah..this isn't a dating site, and how do we know that your not a creeper? Like, you could be asking for our details, and then come like stalk/rape us!  I suggest to go to a public place (like a library or the mall) and meet some new people there.. so yeah! |`|eSH0lHdkaa	I'm not a virgin|`|rMaTC1bpaa	here's an idea.... GO MAKE YOUR OWN FRIENDS!!! Frakly, i think its kinda pathetic that you come online where there are child meleters and all that sh*t and you come asking for friends.. not to mention a girlfriend. Dude, if your that fu**ing deperate then go on eharmony.

X3MVUemWaa	A few things comes to mind because she told about it is she is proud of you for doing it so she is bragging. It was a smart move, something to be proud about, a accomplishment. You did not tell her about it so it also looks like a surprise.<br>    There are a few ways to view it. Why not just ask her, you may be pleasantly surprised by her answer. Don't think the worse right away The breakfast could have been a pat on the back.|`|ea2c09a93f92d7f85f71f746000cb318aa	It might not be the fact that you have money saved, she might be acting extra nice because you were doing something to plan for your future together, which is a huge deal to girls.  If I were you, I wouldn't lend out any of the money unless you intend on doing it for everyone, resentment can rear its ugly little head especially in a family.  Good luck with everything.|`|mldo1vxYaa	Your wife really shouldnt have told other people how much money you have, but at the same time, you have had this money for 25 years and she never knew about it, thats seems very odd to me. My partner knows details of every penny I have and vice versa. I understand some couples keep their money seperate but not knowing about it at all is a little strange to me.|`|aSoCKVJ3aa	Money is the "root" that people use to control another.<br>  Why didn't she know of this before? Have you influenced her to be the needy person she is now? Money can be a tool to control someone, and you've obviously used this. It amazes me that she is not mad about this, I know I would be if my spouse had withheld anything about our finances from me. Just saying.  Good Luck. :)|`|cu67LPb0aa	It's obvious that she's interested in you now for the money rather than your marriage. It's a shame that it had to be that way. Good luck and keep a close eye on her and her spending, or your spending.|`|UY2MJtfGaa	Don't worry about it.  She'll soon grow used to the idea and will revert back to her harpy ways.<br>  <br>  That or figure out how to get your money.|`|kOoCya9Oaa	Sounds like everyone wants to help you hatch that egg.|`|ELSKfMpxaa	It isn't always. Just to some people.|`|OaOf4oxQaa	She is showing you how much she values you. I think she realized that if you were committed to put money in savings for such a long time, well, she can count on your marriage to which I think you committed too. I don't know if I am right, but it may also be that she can relax and know that she can count on you. I mean a man that saves money and is with me for such a long time, wow what wouldn't I do for him. I will just appreciate him and take it easy, we won't have to struggle or stress out for money but just work the normal with confidence and security. I would just enjoy being pampered, let yourself be loved. Good luck. I admire man like you. Wow.|`|cmvum8YDaa	well cause money can solve a lot of problems...and when a person feels safe and secure they become happier...just be thankful you have a wife that can fix you breakfast...|`|w2pxYjJVaa	She wants your money, don't let her buy cloths with it bro.|`|bQfwwUYhaa	shes cheating on you kick her to the curb noe|`|AA12316366	a while back i came into some money. i decided to help a few people thinking to do some good. what a big mistake! suddenly i was getting phone calls; visits, letterers etc. from relatives i hadn't heard from for years and became the focal point for every scheme, scam and rip off imaginable. i likened to cockroach's crawling from the walls. even the folks i helped tried to scam me for more. finally, i decided to just give it all away and NOT to any of these greedy, conniving jerks. now things are finally back to normal and i don't see any of them anymore. just recently i found that the person i had listed as an emergency contact and my beneficiary has been tapping my bank account and behind my back trying to gain Control of my affairs.<br>  i could go on forever but i think you get my drift. <br>  <br>  p.s. all of these people profess to be christians two are actually ministers and they all run around pretending to be so damned wonderful and and above board.<br>  <br>  sick of them all!!!!!|`|D4XWrwuaaa	Your mistake was letting her find out about it.<br>  You're screwed now man. Might as well give it away or she'll get 1/2 of it once she reverts to her old ways and decides to leave you when you won't give it to her.|`|kTZevQNHaa	Money doesn't HAVE to be and should not be the main incentive to be NICE to you.<br>  They're disingenuous money  grubbers!<br>  Invest it so they know the money's BUSY...thus you can't hand it out.<br>  Then sit back and see if their behavior changes...that and buy yourself a nice new car and set of golf clubs.|`|d5368f798fac0323fe025ec0d32f5be6aa	- i would be very pissed at your wife. cant trust her with info.<br>  - just tell them its all locked up in a fund or retirement or something and you cant take it out.<br>  - Just deny them of money, plain and simple.<br>  - its rude for your family to ask for money, and react and show how unpleased you are.|`|oIY7UlmZaa	Greed! People who is smart like you should have known after 25 years of "investing" you had express in some way to your family what you were doing. If they knew that I think it could've been a better chance of your family not asking for that hard earned cash.|`|aJEsKQHNaa	Well she is probably just happy now that you dont have to worry about financial problems. You brother and son are probably asking for money because well they need it. But, they might want material things too, so that may be the problem.
a05818703edf627a70c2368c5b12f69daa	i think when a child turns 12 yrs old they can decide where they want to live. the child or children need to report all this to their school councilor, sounds like the child protective people are not doing their job, u could ask for custody but going through a court thing will cost u big bucks. the girl needs to talk to her school councilor and that should do it.|`|NqbBjS0raa	Time to re open the court as to custody if the drugs are true. This is for the three who definitely need better supervision and care than the mother is providing. Do what you can to make this happen before something worse occurs......|`|v2a220YWaa	In most states it is 14, but if these children are living like this a judge will talk to them and if it is that bad he will let them decide.  This happened to my neighbor, and him and his wife have the teenagers now.|`|NnN4drsbaa	ok... Number one....What's the father doing??? In all that you have said not once did you mention the dad. Why has he not gone to his kids? Why has he not investigated this? WTF is he waiting for? I feel you, but the dad really needs to take charge. He can go, get a room, and just hang low, just to see what the hell them girls are going thru. This don't make sense!!!!! This living situation didn't just start, why has he allowed it to go on for so long???|`|groIDUPJaa	File court documents for full custody.  Get a lawyer.|`|eu1q5f8waa	i think its 13 because we were talking about this in school a couple months ago.<br>  Good luck:)|`|RcVM06T3aa	first you will have to get a really good lawyer. then if you can get custody of the 16 & 14 year old you will OFFICIALLY have the custody of the 12 year old reson being that they will not seperate 1 child from the rest. and fight for all you want because you can not go to court and fight for the same things twice.
43D89edDaa	How true this is. <br>  <br>  In my short marriage of 6 months so far I have had to own up to a lot of selfishness. Not only has she helped me see this, God has helped me be humble enough to swallow my pride and allow me evaluate myself and change long before I retort and try to point out the wrong in her.<br>  <br>  In so doing I am able to love her regardless of how she treats me... When life gets tough and its stressful, sometimes we say things we don't mean, sometimes we take out our frustration on those closest to us. Sometimes we go to other sources to find happiness and nurture our love for things other than our loved ones. <br>  <br>  But what christ did was the perfect example of love. He can help us receive and give this love. We can't just make the change once though.<br>  <br>  Our testimony of Christ is not something we gain today and will have tomorrow. It is as fragile as a moonbeam. Just as our love of our spouses... It is something that has to be recaptured every day of our lives. <br>  <br>  Thank you for sharing this. I felt the spirit testify that Christ lives through that video. Thank you thank you.|`|NDRiSTfUaa	we watched this and he still left me. a day later i lost a baby i told him and he just emailed back didn't want to see me or anything. it just depends on the guy if hes an *** hole or not. and if he really knows what love is. i thought i knew but i was wrong.|`|ENSGrZAqaa	Im glad I didnt rent this one...thanks for the heads up.|`|CnqGu1Taaa	I was married once but now divorced for 14 years now...I have not found Love yet....to me finding True Love is liken to the Holy Grail|`|8cuPVvYnaa	Thank you for sharing this. I'm not married, but I am so glad that I've found true love. :-)|`|tvK1xjzkaa	Oh I know what love is but the thing is sometimes you can't force someone to love you the way you should be loved. No matter how many steps you take may it be 40 days or 1000 days you can't make the heart love when the love is gone. You can only save the love in a marriage if you caught the fire just before the fire goes out. If it has ran its course and burnt out there's nothing that can be done. Once its out its out nothing will ever bring it back, even with all gods power.<br>  <br>  Sometimes divorce is the only option...Movie is great but doesn't always work...|`|hjc2y3TMaa	God has nothing to do with love. Neither does the Easter bunny.<br>  Yes, I know what love is and it has nothing to do with what's going on here...Don't get me wrong, I respect that religious people are trying to be better and do good in the world but I don't believe in God or his love.|`|rAXkpuzIaa	Thank you for taking the time to share this. With God, all things are possible.|`|KlXUrxBfaa	True love is never ending
64c5645270cc177785c1afd741be7ce2aa	Hay personas que, al conocerlas, te brindan una loca simpata llena de risas, pero cuando los conoces a fondo resultan ser unos payasos tristes.  A veces, esas personas que guardan tanta tristeza por tanto tiempo, te sorprenden con un cambio de personalidad el da menos pensado...  por ejemplo:  violencia domstica, bipolaridad, adicciones, etctera.    Tal vez es mejor el trmino medio (la tranquila simpata).   Los extremos siempre son malos... no se debe idealizar a nadie.

GGSSxFsUaa	No! are you reading your post! <br>  <br>  You mention nothing about him ending the affair! It's your husband and you sound reluctant! I'm not married to "her" so I could careless about his side piece of ***!  I would focus on where "WE" went wrong. <br>  <br>  You can't fight for a marriage when your husband is "still" cheating! He has to be more willing than you since he is the one that betrayed you and have forsaken your vows.<br>  <br>  I would confront him something like this - "if you want to save this marriage you will cut off all contact with mistress (change #'s & email), go to counseling, constant communication until some form of trust has been restored & if it happens again (it's likely) we will divorce!<br>  <br>  Get some strength, pride and self esteem and don't let him get another chance after this ESPECIALLY IF KIDS ARE INVOLVED!<br>  <br>  Kids are not an excuse to stay with your cheating husband. Would you want this for your daughter? No|`|7foornMVaa	He cheated on me with his former long time girl friend for the first year we were together.I called her and she didnt really know of me, only as a friend. I was pregnant when I found out. I left him for a while and he begged me back. Promises were made. We got back together and it has been good since. It took a long time for us to be "ok".<br>  If I were not pregnant, I would have left and never looked back.|`|vyNlyfczaa	I felt that he was cheating! I tried to catch him on that... he was smart! One day some girl came to my work and started to scream at me to leave her boyfriend alone! I said that this is funny because I am his wife! I asked her to come to our place this same day... she came, we talked, we called one more girl - I learned how such scum bag he is (he had no idea that we talked - he was not home)... next day after he left to work she came to my house, we changed the locks and gave away all his clothes to salvation army! Also I told her that she can keep him, but she said that she's good:D this what I know he moved in to his another girl! I divorced him, her and I stayed friends:D <br>  I don't fight for cheater! Even when the kids are involved (my parents stayed together for my and my sis - so I know for fact that this is not too good idea! we always knew that something was wrong! the love was just not there! they tried - I can't say that they did not...)|`|CWgJ7Yyxaa	I am very sorry to hear about your predicament.<br>  <br>  Nobody is perfect.....we all make mistakes. But I feel very strongly about cheating... and do not think it is ever right.<br>  <br>  Listen...Everybody is different. Some people have more forgiving natures than others; some people can "forgive and forget"; but some cannot...no matter how hard they try! This does not mean they are bad or mean people; it just means they cannot handle this kind of betrayal.<br>  <br>  You are perfectly entitled to feeling the way you do. <br>  <br>  What your husband did is wrong in many levels---he disrespected you, your marriage, your home. Everything we do in life has consequences; and the consequences of his actions have caused you to lose your trust in him. You don't have to be a nuclear physicist to understand this.<br>  <br>  I guess what I'd ask you to do is go to therapy or counseling by yourself. You need to vent and address your feelings. If you don't, sooner or later you will blow up...and you might easily have a serious depression that could literally put you in the hospital, so be careful and take care of yourself. I'm not kidding here. <br>  <br>  You must evaluate your life and make a decision. <br>  <br>  You cannot keep postponing it or living like this- it's just not healthy! While I believe that people should fight for their marriage, I feel that in cases of abuse or cheating, we shouldn't feel guilty for bailing out. <br>  <br>  After all, God knows our intentions and He can read our heart. He knows you love your husband; and that you have tried to be a good wife and mom. But ....since we cannot change other people, you will have to either accept what happened and work on overcoming it...or calling it quits.<br>  There is no gray area here- it's a black-or-white issue.<br>  Either you really forgive and forget.....or you end it.<br>  <br>  You should talk to your husband and explain how you feel. Men and women think and act differently: so he needs to really understand to what extent he hurt and damaged your relationship. Chances are, he feels bad about it and wishes he hadn't done it; but he needs to fully GET IT...! <br>  <br>  I wouldn't contact the other person involved. After all, she is not the one married to you or breaking vows...your husband is.<br>  <br>  Explain it to him like this: Imagine you have a beautiful crystal vase you cherish. You enjoy looking at it, and feel happy when you do. But one day it falls and breaks.<br>  Even if you manage to find all the pieces and put it back together again, you will always feel sad when you look at it. Why? Because it is no longer "perfect", as it once was. Every time you see it, you will remember how it WAS, and you will feel both sad and angry that it is NOT the same way NOW.<br>  <br>  So...What are you going to do about it?<br>  Are you going to toss it away? Or are you going to hold on to it, because you still like it, although it makes you sad?<br>  <br>  The same thing happens to your marriage. Maybe this will help him to see your point of view.<br>  .........................................<br>  <br>  Please consider scheduling an appointment with your pastor or priest so you can vent. Keeping things inside is a bad idea.<br>  Also, see if your church has a support group you can join. (Listening to other people's stories may help you when you see you are not the only one going through this.)<br>  <br>  Good luck. Only you know how you feel and if you are willing to try to continue trying to make things work out. Ask God to help you, heal you and guide you.<br>  <br>  And remember..Life is too short to waste it on being miserable. God wants us to be happy. <br>  <br>  And IMO, liars, cheaters and abusive men never change. <br>  You will be in my prayers.|`|gfHutvEFaa	I really want to say that I would leave. But....I can't say that because it has never happened to me. I don't know if I could ever look at him and not see him in bed with someone other than me. I think that alone would destroy our marriage.<br>  <br>  If you think there may be a chance, grab it. Get marriage counseling, talk to your paster, anything! When you have exhausted everything and still can't let it go then you will know it is time to move on.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|f572cd9e5284c6c84045096ffbd2aeb8aa	I would probably divorce.|`|bMDaPFgmaa	do u still love him? does he still love u? can u trust him after what he's done to u? if all the answer maybe or yes, then maybe u forgive him & give him another chance. However, if one of the answer is no, then u r only wasting your time, coz in the end it'll break too. Don't confront him even if u have proof, but u can ask him for the truth, from this u really can see how he responds. & never confront the other woman! First of all it takes 2 to tango, & it's your husband that u should ask not her. We have to have respect & dignity as the real wife. So, put your chin up whichever u choose, pray to God to change your hurt heart to a brand new better heart, correct yourself (maybe it's part of your fault too that he ever cheated in the first place), & move on. Think positif. Life is too short to be wasted on someone's mistakes that we are not even be responsible to. we only live once so live to your fullest, have peace within yourself, u'll be fine. Be strong, be brave, I know it's hard, only time can heal u. & don't forget everybody has problems, so it's not only u....|`|xarKlp0Oaa	I would just sit down and talk to him. You can't let him have his cake and eat it too. If you put effort in to making it better and it still doesn't change then I would leave him. The kids will adjust and if you continue to let him do this to you it could end up hurting the kids more.|`|AP2e90cCaa	I would confront him and ask him to answer alllll of the questions I have.<br>  <br>  It really would depend on the situation.
I2NnRUK0aa	I guess  you should give him some time to decide who he wants? Be nice and caring( because if you try to be rude you will lose him) show him you like him. Don't talk about his ex. See if he gets his acts right. Else you know he is not worth for you.|`|uhN7WmXhaa	Hire a detective?Perhaps,there would be a probability about it because they are childhood best friends and have a former romantic relationship.They have a chemistry perhaps,buts its you who know him well.However,if you are still in doubt,set up a date with three of you and investigate or observe their actions toward each other.|`|B7kPUmUWaa	If they are just friends, why would he lie to you and take your car to go see her? Why would he need to have a conversation with her that you can't hear? People who don't have anything to hide, don't hide anything. He may not have done it yet. But, like I said, there is a reason he is lying and hiding conversations. Trust your instincts.|`|nmiXLhwCaa	Yeah, sounds a little shady.  Call the show Cheaters!  <br>  <br>  If there is nothing going on he wouldn't have to leave the room to talk to her.
3QAml5oPaa	i'd rather 4give a criminal dan a guy who's cheated on a girl...dat's da worst crime.But it doesn't matter wot i say.ok let's give both da guys an equal standing..ok? so ur new guy is nice & u MAY wanna keep him .But if ur old guy has come back 2 u, ur sure he means wot he says now and ur heart is still with him,then follow ur heart.but only after making sure dat he wont cheat again, but if u feel more strongly 4 da new guy, keep him..as 4 dis best frndz situation, dont think of it at all. Just make sure dat whichever guy u reject, u aren't rude to him.tell him he can find other gals . u weren't meant 2 be his and dat u can b frndz..or if u wanna go 4 a completely new guy, u can very well do dat <br>  2. uhh! i've written so long...just do wotever u wanna do babe!!|`|qroOTyrGaa	If he cheated on you then he's not worth your time, but if you're not 100% in love with the other guy then it's unfair to stay with him. And you're probably not 100% in love with him if you question whether you should be with your ex. You probably shouldn't be with either one.|`|KsPbIxq1aa	honestly... don't get back with the cheater. he cheated on you for a year and that's not forgivable in my eyes. if it were just a one time fling then i would say forgive him but it was a year fling so i would say stay with the nice guy. as far as them being best friends.. you didn't know when you met the guy and if you really like him and he's the one you want to try and make things work with then you should. hope this helps-|`|37ana68Haa	both lol jk i would choose the new one the ex had his chance already and once a cheater always a cheater dont believe that i can change bullsh*it its all a lie|`|nmiXLhwCaa	Keep the nice guy, the other guy cheated on you.|`|J1Frx83haa	sorry|`|AA10378030	Follow your heart. ?|`|MA3KcLUJaa	uhm.<br>  Learn how to make sentences that possibly make sense first,<br>  Then move on to a new guy.<br>  Anyone that cheats is ****, and doesn't deserve another chance.<br>  Period.|`|Cwqkbp49aa	Just because he's nice doesn't mean you are meant to be with him or fall in love with him.  If your heart lies with someone else, you should explore that option.  If it can't work out, then start with a clean slate.|`|dtHjJah5aa	Your boyfriend CHEATED on you for a year.  He didn't break up with her FOR you.....he broke up with her because YOU found out about her and he thought he could keep you if he broke it off with her.  Obviously it didn't bother him to be sleeping with her and lying to you.  I personally would stay with the guy who didn't cheat on you and has treated you great.  You have no reason to break up with him except to give a guy who already disrespected and hurt you another chance to do the exact same thing again.  Good luck.  I hope this helps.|`|yyIVrngcaa	dating best friends never turns out nicely....<br>  just see them both as friends...im sure you'll meet someone outside this friend-related circle. you don't want the drama don't look for it.|`|POZvhqj4aa	you've moved on going back to your ex will make you cheat on your current boyfriend.|`|bgk2y17Maa	pray about it. you'll get what your looking for

2kl0vQjVaa	Wal-Mart will not do custom designs.  Brookshires will only customize flowers/colors.  You still have to get one of their designs.  I would suggest looking at your local culinary school for a pastry student near graduation that would like a design to put in their portfolio.|`|tvUAO4ioaa	Wal-mart doesn't custom design wedding cakes - they actually come to the store already made (frozen.) <br>  <br>  Depending on how many guests you have, you can get a custom made cake for a reasonable price if you shop around. It depends on your area, but I got a 3 layer, hexagon, buttercream frosting cake made for 50 people for $240.

Tuve un novio con el que dur como un a?o, terminanos (ya hace 5 a?os) y hasta la fecha no lo he vuelto a ver. Hace 2 a?os so? con l durante una semana y lo nico que me atrev a hacer fue llamar a su casa en un horario en el que seguramente no lo encontrara, habl con su hermano y slo le pregunt si estaba bien de salud, me contest que s, un poco extra?ado por mi llamada, d las gracias y colgu. l nunca devolvi la llamada ni nada por el estilo.    En esta temporada es un pretexto ideal para llamar (claro, slo dices que le deseas un feliz a?o, que se cumplan sus deseos, etc.) y le llam a otro de mis exnovios, lo felicit y dems. De l sali la idea de vernos y tomar un caf para conversar, la verdad no me esper eso  porque s que se cas hace un a?o y va a ser pap.    Claro que no intento reanudar nuestra relacin, slo le llam por esa curiosidad que t tambin sientes. Y hasta ahora no nos hemos visto, espero que la cita sea la prxima semana y ya te contar...     De cualquier modo, siempre es agradable reencontrarte con una persona con la que compartiste momentos hermosos, vivencias inolvidables y amor, en algn momento de sus vidas. Porque cuando ha pasado el tiempo esas experiencias te hacen ser la persona que eres ahora.    Suerte!
5d5guRFMaa	Ok, here’s the thing: you’re 15 and you don’t need a girlfriend.  Why would you want to tie yourself down to something right now in your life?  Have fun – go out with friends – no need to be “in a relationship” at this point in your life…you have plenty of time. Maybe you and a group of friends-including her- can go do some fun activity together.  Hang out, but don’t tie yourself down.  Trust me, it’s not worth it.  You miss out on too much when you are worrying about what someone else wants.  Wait, be patient, even in college you probably will find yourself wanting to be groups rather than just one person.  <br>  <br>  Now, does she like you?  She might.  Ask her.  But let me be clear, you are very young and even in this day and age where dating at 2 might be appropriate, it’s really not.  She probably doesn’t know what she wants…yet.  And honestly, you probably aren’t even sure that you want her.  Hang out with a lot of people and have a bunch of great experiences rather than tying yourself down to just one.<br>  <br>  Also, it doesn’t matter WHAT you look like.  You sound like a good looking kid.  You are worth a lot more than worrying about if some girl likes you.  Be 15.  When you’re 40, you’ll wonder why you wanted her in the first place.|`|7ObD9tNbaa	looks are not everything, act like she does not phase you and dont let her make you feel not good enough, just talk to as many girls as possible and keep your head up, you sound like my boyfriend when we were your age and i was just like your girlfriend, 4 years later, i no longer think im better and we share a mutal love, tell her how you feel like she makes you feel like your not good enough, she will tell you exactly why she does what she does, trust me, just tell her!|`|EKHvRJPcaa	She could be teasing you, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. She may be unsure if you like her back so she is just trying to give hints without totally wearing her heart on her sleeve. She is probably afraid of being denied by you. So try putting yourself out there. The worst she could say is no. And if she doesn't think you are attractive, who cares? there IS someone out there that thinks you are completely gorgeous so no worries!!|`|Sp1FNZa6aa	man every girl loves to make a relationship with a foreigner.. they like foreigners like its something new .. but in ur case she may like u .. but apparently shes a controller .. so if its ok for u to let her control you lol .. then u got a gf .. unless ull have many problems everyday and this will be a miss match .. shes the type that if she like some one (feeling weak to tell that she love's that person and will do anything for him) she doesnt show it up to u.. she want the other person to die for her to see that in him.. so if she really like this type and can handle her .. u r a couple.. =)|`|kDUkz5Ppaa	well maybe you should talk to her and see whats going on. thats what iu always do. dont be shy. you need to go get your girl|`|hgmexwtEaa	if you like her, ask her out. she seems like shes interested in you.<br>  <br>  a girl can act pretty crazy arouns a person when they like that someone.|`|028xaZCeaa	she is obviously just teasing you because she knows you like her and she likes the attention she is getting from you... completely ignore her and act interested in someone else and i bet she acts totally different then!

You're not in the wrong at all.|`|AA11899313	Maybe they were mad with you because the 'number of people going' was fixed and they needed this number to get a discount on the cost!<br>  <br>  It's the only explanation I can think of.<br>  <br>  Maybe they were not right to feel mad at you, but likely they had a right to feel upset at possibly being let down in the circumstances ~ although no 'right to be rude' to anyone.<br>  <br>  Sash.|`|ecfdaa0025f15f95c0f55c59a87b000aaa	First, if you are the only one over 18 then they will not get far with the holiday company. <br>  Apart from that, they do not sound a very nice set of people to go on holiday with. Have you been with them before? If not, I should be very careful, as to spend 7 or 14 days with the same people could end with disagreements and falling out.<br>  Finally, when you next answer a question, perhaps you could use capital letters where necessary|`|f4WVWNxuaa	I wouldnt want to go away with people who get this uptight about something that cant be helped, if you were ill then you were ill, tough! Would they jump at your command if you wanted them to do something when they weren't well?|`|851c6ba054fa621b9fc32855c092c444aa	Those are the kind of people you DON'T want to go on a vacation with. You might as well go vacationing solo. They don't care about you.|`|SxzExRw2aa	true friends are there to the end. and if you were sick  and couldnt' do what they wanted you to do . i think that they was  really rude, what if the shoe was on the other foot ? you should think about the kind of friends that you have . and  ask yourself are they really my friends? real friends will stick and stay the others ones will blow away. you were not wrong girlfriend.|`|7fh3JCVxaa	no they dont! and i reckon the reason they were so cheeky and rude and mean was because they were desperate.<br>  call them and let them know youre going tomorrow, and once its booked and sorted everythig should be fine.<br>  <br>  but youve done nothing wrong.x|`|QIkAqFsbaa	you are obviously not their friend, they only want yo use you. You may want to rethink if you want to go on a holiday with them and make  you responsible because you are the only one over 18 years.
aSoCKVJ3aa	Why don't you ask him to go to Wal-Mart with you for something that's needed for the house. Tell him you need his advice.  Then steer him over to the jewelry counter to have your fingers sized 'cause you're curious now that your fingers are swollen.  After you have yours sized ask him if he would have his sized too, just for the fun of it. Good Luck  :)|`|POHWTDPRaa	Does he have a ring? Not a wedding ring, just a plain old ring. Because there are ring sizers you can print out to see what size he is:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.ajediam.com/finger_sizes_rings.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.ajediam.com/finger_sizes_ring...</a><br>  <br>  And if he doesn't have anything, you must know someone who's built like your husband. Just find out what ring size he wears and you will at least get close to the right one. You can always get the ring sized later.|`|AdeD0xMuaa	I'm not sure about the ring size...but be careful about giving someone a gift with the hopes of receiving one in return. That's not usually a good idea.|`|3YzXWHwbaa	I have wanted a new wedding ring for a long time.  When we were married, we didn't have any money.  We went to jeweler and I took 300$ from my savings account of 500$ and bought a little wedding set that lasted about 7 years.  <br>  My husband has bought me an anniversary band for $500 but has never ponyed up for the real thing.<br>  I've even come so far as to mention it in the last few years.<br>  But his nickname is Mr Rusty-hinged Wallet and he has earned it.<br>  We've been married 27 years.<br>  I have wondered the same thing as you-how do you get the man to try on rings to get his size?  Go just mess around at a jewelers one day when they are having a sale-|`|6dhEB2nBaa	The way I found out what my husbands ring size was, was by asking his dad. His dads were the exact same size so i got really lucky. I dont know if thats close on everybody. A friend of mine was buying her boyfriend a ring a got one out of the candy machine as a joke and put it on him and it was a little tight so she took it to the jewelry store and had it measured and then made it a little bigger adn it fit! Use a twist tie and make it a joke and then take the twist tie to the jewelry store ive heard of ppl doing that too! Good luck!|`|jBigEy0Caa	Don't do anything in hopes that he will do the same for you in return.  You only set yourself up for disappointment.  Some guys need for you to tell them what you want and ESP doesn't work too well with them.  My husband happens to be one of those guys, so trust me I know what I am talking about.  You can take one of his old rings or have a friend have him try theirs on.  You always have the option to have it sized after you get it.|`|PuQyYMM8aa	Yeah why not! I think its a great idea!<br>  <br>  Oh yeah and you tell by his shoe size. If he wears a size 11 shoe, then his ring size should be an 11 also. But, don't forget you can always have it sized later if it doesn't fit perfectly.|`|AP2e90cCaa	That's a nice idea, but I agree that you shouldn't give a gift because you hope to receive one. That will be disappointing.<br>  <br>  In any case, buy him the 11. If it doesn't fit then you can get it altered.|`|v2a220YWaa	you should just get the size 11, if it doesn't fit any jeweler can size it (within 2 sizes) for just a few bucks.  <br>  <br>  It is a great idea, go for it!|`|0403019361fccbd9826c8fd048f00618aa	I would do this as more of a "fun thing." Like, if you go to a store, you could try on ugly rings and get him to do the same thing. My husband is funny and he likes to make me laugh. In a store that sells lots of men and women's rings (or a flea market), it wouldn't be hard to get him to try on crazy rings to be funny. Its a thought. Like, "Hey, honey I bet THAT ring would look great on you!" and it'd be a really ugly one etc. <br>  <br>  Another plan would be to buy a size 11 and have it sized later. It is usually just $20 or so to size one. My husband wears a size 10 and he is 180-200 pounds (varies). Size 10 is the most common male ring size from my experience. <br>  <br>  one more point-- The jewelry stores often have good sales on wedding bands (which aren't usually expensive) and if you have insurance put on it (goes by price of ring), you will get it sized for FREE for life.<br>  <br>  Just some ideas. Good luck. But, it will hurt your feelings if you buy this for him and he: A) Doesn't want it B) Doesn't wear it C) STILL doesn't buy you one. I think it would be great for you ask for it as a special gift/gesture. You could go together and pick out a matching pair or set (his and hers). Don't hope for romantic gestures, make a friendly experience out of it and you will get what you want and it will not be hard to figure out.  Its fun to shop for the rings together.|`|d0brzTt2aa	I know there are some guys who don't care for rings, wedding/sentimental value or not. <br>  <br>  What's special to us might not be special to them. However, you know your husband so if you think he will appreciate, then go for it. A unique idea, for sure.<br>  <br>  As to finding out his ring size... I'm not sure about comparing fingers, but what I would do is ask someone else to find out for me, someone I know who can do it discreetly. <br>  <br>  "I'm doing a survey for my daughter's/friend's class. What's your ring finger?"<br>  <br>  Best of luck.
OCMSTxYfaa	sorry...gotta let her live her own life..whether you like it or not...nice though that you want to protect your sister. I don't blame you a bit, I too, would have a hard time not kicking his ***|`|DtGFWUP5aa	Let your sister make her own decisions or she will hate you forever for ruining what is supposed to be the best day of her life. You deciding to beat this guy up and make the decision for her is as bad as the guy thinking he is allowed to tell her what to do. In both cases a man is taking over for her decisions. <br>  <br>  If she happens to get into trouble with this guy or if he lays a hand on her, then you can beat his ***. Right now all you can do is wish her the best of luck.|`|7fh3JCVxaa	if you do that your sister would only stick up for him more, and not listen to anything you have to say.<br>  you should speak to him, and tell him that he better treat you right.<br>  and that way he knows not to treat her bad, because she has a really supportive family who will all go against him<br>  <br>  and even if he tells her about you warning him to be nice, she wont get mad over that.x|`|mldo1vxYaa	Butt out if she is happy which she obviously is then its her decision, if he was going to treat her bad he would be showing signs of it by now and she would have mentioned it.<br>  <br>  If in the future he treats her bad then be there for her and listen but dont kick his a## she wont appreciate that.|`|AbtCfY1caa	just because you don't agree with his ideology ( i don't) does not mean it is wrong.  if that is the approach to life they choose, then let them.  wanting to kick *** is also an antiquated way of dealing with situations that do not meet your view of the world.|`|BKr3y30maa	First of all, I think it is super sweet of you to be concerned about your sister's happiness.  But I would honestly just let it go.  Hopefully he does and always will make her happy.  Just be supportive and if by some chance, things do not work out for them.....then you can kick his butt :)|`|71ZX8wUbaa	your true love is to support yr sis at this time..and fight back later if you find any problems in her lift....gud luk|`|fAdh5BAkaa	buy him flowers|`|LoLwBDnIaa	Talk to your sister about it before you do anything to the guy. tell her what you think and also maybe tell him what you think about him.|`|9ae919aecab255ec4dd5fb19b5c555e8aa	To late the plans are made unless you can do a background check and find some dirt on him otherwise you can do nothing and who's knows it might work out!!|`|Vjsc0P0kaa	its really never too late to call off a wedding, except maybe afterward, but you can still have it annulled. talk to your sister. tell her how much you love her and why you're uncomfortable with it. let her know that if things end up not working out, not to stick around if she's not happy and that you'll help her if that happens. and just wish her the best of luck.<br>  <br>  trust me. things with my parents didn't work out and my mom stuck around for fifteen years longer than she should have. she is the youngest of 11 and was too embarrassed to ever go to any of them for help throughout her marriage and even after the separation. so we pretty much didn't have a place to live for about a year and a half.<br>  <br>  <br>  that's really all you can do.|`|ZMmlMRG3aa	I love you Grog!<br>  <br>  You are simply awesome for caring this much about your sister!!<br>  I wish my brothers had spoken to me about their concerns before I got married! I may not have listened, but I still wish they had.<br>  <br>  Please try to share your concerns with your sister, tell her you care about her and that you see that her fiance has a few qualities (good or bad) that your father did, and that this is worrying you. <br>  She will realise that you want the best for her and that you care for her. It will be up to her on what she makes of your concerns, but remember to tell her that you will support her no matter what, and that you will always be there for her. <br>  It is up to her what she chooses for her life, I am sure you know that already. So respect her decisions either way, and continue to love her unconditionally.<br>  Remember also that maybe you have not seen the side to this fiance that she has seen, but that maybe soon you will see him and enjoy his company! You just never know what will happen in life. <br>  Good luck to you Grog, you are a great brother!|`|HjZZGkZVaa	don't fight him! if anything talk to your sister<br>  but its kinda too late, just hope that they will be happy together|`|zeTGmB3faa	Some would say to leave it alone, but not me. Meet your sister for lunch and explain your concerns. Let her know that you love her and point out that this guy seems a lot like your father, which worries you. Also tell her the the obey thing should not be part of a marriage but equal respect and promises to treat each other equally and love are the vows that should be repeated. Be nice, and don't attack this guy verbally to your sister. The idea is is make her think and not get angry and defend him. She will do as she wants, but as a loving brother, I think it is ok to say what you feel.|`|YQ1Q7XeEaa	You shut up and support and love your sister.  Your beating up the groom will only separate her from you then what good can you be to her.<br>  <br>  You don't have to love or even like the guy.  Just know that right now she does love him and you will lose any battle over her.<br>  <br>  Bide your time and be there for her should she ever need you.|`|gDuDNeRcaa	make sure he knows crystal clear and fully understands that you have zero tolerance for your sister being treated badly. be intimidating. do it in a very confident and intelligent way. then, if he breaks the rules, follow through with busting his head open. :o]|`|ZKVlF2pKaa	Talk to the guy but don't kick his butt, let him know if ever lays a hand on your sister, you won't tolerate it. But other than that, leave things alone along as she is happy.|`|Awv7stIJaa	Well, if she's happy with him, let her be happy. If it doesn't end well, she can learn from the experience.
B36hpSCsaa	i know lil one that you will not like this answer.  yet if you are 21 living at your parents house, then maybe you and your boyfriend should respect your mothers wishes...pass the respect on to your brother...  best of luck|`|w29tsXLUaa	There always was one rule for the male and one for the female.<br>  <br>  They worry more about the female if she is their female. <br>  <br>  At 21 you are adult and can make your own decisions but this is their house and they make the rules which unfortunately you have to bide by.<br>  <br>  Nothing in life is fair.|`|htSZsds7aa	No its not fair, BUT your brother is not the one that can end up pregnant. If this were my house, I would have the same rules for you and your brother..no boy/girlfriends sleep over in same room.|`|71ZX8wUbaa	you are on a legal age and if you are serious getting married then carry on and no one will ever bother yourself, leaving apart from your brothers story...|`|20c96a5e1e1d8742c7835d3700704d38aa	No its not really fair but their house their rules. Stay at your boyfriends house if you need to stay the night with him.
8Zk3t6yAaa	Well, Sounds like he is eaching you a lesson. I did this to my boyfriend because although I knew I was his world...he didnt always treat me right. You need to show him love by giving him little things to show you love him. Like cards or notes or poems...then you should talk to him and pour out all of your feelings to him. Let him know you know you were wrong. Most importantly when you feel you are going to get overbaurd and get into his business...which inst always yours too....take a step back and relize...ask him if he wants your advice and if he doesnt then dont pressure him/
8YZoW8K7aa	If he is clueless as to what to say...yes.<br>  <br>  If he really likes her then sometimes he'll be too worried of saying the wrong thing and messing up, though it is only sometimes the case, when he REALLY likes her. I was in that boat once. I'm out of it and things are great, nothing to be worried about.|`|BPqK0c5taa	Yes mainly because you can't think of something to say, or you don't want to sound desperate. I know it goes beyond yes or no but this is not a yes or no answer in my opinion although I tried!|`|ffG6Wk4waa	hell yes|`|H7cNZYIYaa	yes

0CX9a9wyaa	first and foremost you need to focus on what you want..... you need to take care of yourself and get back on track. no one will take care of you like yourself . I understand how parents can be to much involved, i am a mother of 4. and a new grandma of 1. just listen to what they have to say. one day it will all make sense..... and most of all do not<br>  let anyone bring or put you down.... focus is the main key.... know what you want and need.... do for yourself. don't depend on anyone... <br>  keep trying and don't give up... if you don't try you will never know. <br>  and last of all don't have any regrets. . don't say well i should of, or i could or i would of....  just do it. if you fall get right back up....best wishes and good luck......|`|9ro8fiKvaa	I totally get it! Try and get anything for work. Get a couple of part time jobs if you have to. Get out of that house and get into an apt with a roommate or several. It's always easier to find a job when you are already employed. Good luck.|`|nUq4A3Xcaa	If you get a full time job, then that will be at least 9 hours out of the day that you can be away from your parents.  Pay your parents some rent, save the rest until you can afford to move out on your own or get a roommate.  Check the ads you may find someone looking for a roommate that is willing to work with you now.|`|AA11803994	Parents have a hard time not putting their two-cents in about how you should live your life. That's just the way they are and unfortunately, bless their hearts!...they can't help it. :) I suggest getting a full-time job as quickly as you can. The time you are at your job will mean time away from your parents. That also means money in the bank and when you start earning enough to move out, you'll feel like you really accomplished something on your own. What you do with your life is your choice, not anyone else's.
6UyDKkj9aa	To me summer fling start with me liking the person, then I realize I don't like him. When That happen, i don't mess around, I tell them as soon as possible, nicely of course!|`|POHWTDPRaa	If it's so abnormal, why did you ask why girls have summer flings, like it is something that happens all the time? And how do you know she was just pretending to like you? Must puzzingly, why are you asking about it all this time later? It is now the end of February. Get over it.|`|VFdC2wPlaa	They go into the relationship thinking it will be over at the end of summer. When summer really ends they do what they always planned.... break up with their summer fling. It doesn't mean that the feelings they had for that person weren't real... sometimes they just don't think it through. That's the only explanation i can think of, personally i don't get it either.|`|AA11773731	There is no pretending if you say it's a summer fling up front. Summer is a time to be carefree and as long as you don't lead the other person on thinking there may be a relationship, you should be good.|`|8YZoW8K7aa	Something about hormones. In summer, people are happier (proved) so it would be no surprise if girls get something out of the time of year.|`|RyYV3aXlaa	yeah it really sucks, but guys do the same thing.<br>  be glad for what you did have and move on.|`|qnu6zwd4aa	I honestly dont have a perfect answer for that but, in the summer since its vacation girls want to have that guy they can count on and cuddle with. I dont know, maybe their boyfriends an asshole or maybe they dont spend as much time together as she would want to. Also maybe the girl wants to experience something or someone new during the summer, its just a phase. When vacations over everyone goes back to how it used to be and girls tend to get back to their old bfs.
6UyDKkj9aa	I'm sorry to tell you that I don't believe your friend. Women who date or live or marry violent persons or substance abuser have a real problem of not being able to get out of the relationship. (It's psychological thing, we studied it in my psychology class). Even if they get out of the relationship, the likelyhood of those women returning with an abuser is very high. <br>  <br>  If she does not want to press charge against her ex or stay away from him, then tell her "if you feel unsafe call the cops". You cannot waste your time on someone who do not want to help themselves.|`|nBGjPwViaa	Yes, I agree w/your guy friends, but that does not mean you have to accept her behavior...If she does contact you, I'd reject her.<br>  You need to move on -- she is not treating you right...<br>  Period!!!|`|yB6Vg65Daa	I believe what your guy friends have said because a friend of a friend was in this situation. She eloped with a guy that now beats her and treats her awfully. She even contacted the guy that treat her good (who's booked now) and says that she wants him back in her life.|`|B7sDJvZLaa	yep...<br>  i beleive this=]<br>  maybe shes been so hurt by her ex thats she needs ur love and care if she acts rude like u say just give her time,she has suffered u should understand her!<br>  <br>  Good Luck  2 ya!=]|`|028xaZCeaa	is she told you that she loved another guy, is rude to you, and blocked you from the only contact you had with her WHY would you want to talk to her or CARE for that matter if she ever contacted you again. this is a lil pathetic kid! find someone else for god sakes! you are an idiot if you give her the chance to talk to you again. and getting on her facebook is a little stalkerish|`|Imn5oOWiaa	Most girls are attracted to hard *** jerks. Seriously.. It's sad but it's very true. <br>  <br>  If she blocked you, maybe her ex told her to. <br>  <br>  I understand you really like(d) her.  but living so close and talking for so long and never meeting? Maybe she just gave up.|`|kDUkz5Ppaa	i dont know. did you do something to upset her. because if she is blocking you out of her life. she might have found someone else. Did you mess with another girl. and you think she saw annd got upset. you have to call her and talk to her and see whats going on.|`|3ZBtDEHwaa	yes, i mean one day she will realize that she had someone who really cared for her but she messed up a good thing
v2a220YWaa	your husbands ex sounds like a real winner!! why doesn't she find the real baby daddy to foot the bills, or else lye to some other unsuspecting guy. Now that she is busted, she should let you and your husband live in peace, (without her)|`|AcgDcQG0aa	Yes, the law and the judges can often decide in favor of the child at the expense of someone else.  And whose expense this is they often don't care, as long as it's not the government's expense.<br>  <br>  Just because it's called the justice system doesn't necessarily mean that it's always fair and just.|`|3ee8101ef611dcb2fe20c82dfe728d6caa	It's hard to tell. Nothing will happen to her no matter how this works out. She can always say she really thought he was the father. I have heard of cases where the "father" was still obligated to pay even though it was proven by DNA he wasn't the biological father. They site the best interest of the child. It depends on how long he has been paying. They may figure if he's been paying the last ten years, then it's unfair to the child for him to not pay now. Even though he was deceived their main concern is the child caught in the middle. They figure the adults had options. He could have had a paternity test, even though she said he was the father, he didn't have to go by her word, but he did. That's his bad and they may not stop support for that reason.<br>  Then again, I have heard of cases where when it was proven by DNA that a man was not the father, support stopped. What does your attorney say?|`|FBhjhjR0aa	If the child is prooved by DNA to not be his, then he will no longer have to pay anything for the child.<br>  <br>  Taking her to court for fraud, might be more of a hassle than it's worth. Because you would have to proove that she knew he wasn't the father. And that can be very hard to proove. At the most, he may be able to sue her for what he has paid her already. But again, there has to be proof of what he has paid. Like cancelled checks, or reciepts. All in all, it may be better for you to just turn your back and let it go. <br>  <br>  Best wishes|`|IKXZZDH9aa	There have been hallmark cases in GA citing these exact situations. Judges are no longer playing with women who swear a man is the father of a child, all the while knowing that he is not the only candidate.<br>  <br>  Judges are ordering these women to pay the total amount of support back to the victim, and in Virginia, a woman will serve time in jail for doing such a thing.<br>  <br>  Your attorney is right however, it all depends on the judge.
7RFRGDL6aa	erm sorry but i really dont agree that he has another girl<br>  not everything is about another girl you know <br>  dont worry about there being anyone else|`|t3Mq9Tooaa	Sorry to tell you this, but he has another girl. Maybe a co-worker or friend. That's the scoop, and chances are you probably knew about her and he just played it off as friends, or may have even told you he hated her. Either way, he's hooked up with her now. I guarantee it. Ask around, call him at midnight, ride by his house at odd hours. Do what girls do, and I bet you'll catch him. Because he'll do what guys do and not expect it.<br>  <br>  And yeah it is always about another girl, unless he's gay, then it's a dude, And chicks are the same way. From one to the next. That is basic human nature.|`|2PDhpyuGaa	wow!!!! wow!!!omg wow!! im kinda in the same boat as you.. except im the type of girl that crys begs and everythin but it stoll dont work. i wish i could giv eyou a answer but im stuck with kinda the same situation actually. it hurts more then anythin when the love of ur life walks away. if he really loves u n cares hell come back. i promise that. my bf after a year we broke up. yesterday. but before we broke up in sep and there was another girl but during the 3 mon he kept comin back to me. i guess i scared him cause we are only 19 and i was wantin to marry him and have a fam. he wanted it to but hes sscared. maybe ur bf is scared to i really wishi had the anwser and i knew the future cause it would be so much easyer to let go.. like ever one tells me if its ment to be then hell come back. but i want it right then. i hope i have helped u a lil bit. but if u wanna talk n know more.. email me at camogurl_08@yahoo.com    n i have a myspace to.|`|86hEn6mgaa	you need to fight for the one you love...no matter what...you need to fight...giving space portrays that you're okay with it when you're not...|`|RJeucPf9aa	Sounds like he has mixed emotions and doesn't want a serious relationship.

yZ7vjv86aa	What a cute idea!<br>  <br>  I agree one per couple would be enough.  You could present your guests with this favor one of two ways.  You could use it as the place cards if you have assigned seating with their table number indicated.  You could also have them on a table so guests can take them as they leave.  Both would have cards attached with their names on it.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|ifgzHzA3aa	Those are really cute.<br>  <br>  The easiest and most effective way I have seen this is to use the favors as the placecards.  You would attach the place card to the favor and put it all on a table for the guests to find to know what table they are seated at.  That way the couple picks up their card and one favor and then goes to their table to pick their seats.|`|76f80c73e4bfcb1026dd5ae2d1da3f18aa	why don't you use them as place cards?  on the table by the door to the reception area, set them out with tags for couples or individual guests with their table # on the tag.  that way they get their seat assignment and their favor at the same time.|`|7CKipTZOaa	Those are so cute, I agree with above that using them as place-card holders would be really unique and efficient

43D89edDaa	There are no pro's to physical abuse. Only con's<br>  <br>  Con's:<br>  <br>  1. creating fear, hate, and disgust toward the only people you should be able to trust 100% as their child (your parents)<br>  2. traumatizing them and possibly turning them into abusive people themselves.<br>  3. They do what you demand they do but resent you for every bad thing in their life.<br>  4. They will blame you for all the crappy relationships that end because they can't hold it together.<br>  5.

5yUgMWAsaa	We girls are of jealous nature. Even if we break you with a guy, in our eyes he will still be a guy that we had a relationship with. To see this guy making a move on a girl (or the other way around) is always nostalgic becuase we remember how he was with us. We shouldn't but we tend to react in a jealous way becuase we feel that the guy belongs to us, even when we broke up with him.<br>  <br>  It's complicated dude, don't try to understand, just accept and go along...|`|ntwaOCpFaa	Most girls want to be "that girl" the one you don't get over and always love and we don't want guys to find anyone better than us!|`|zmdTc3DLaa	i think it has to do with the whole"he was yours" thing<br>  or maybe they just realize that they missed out on a great thing and dont wanna see them happy that fast?|`|mqjZtssGaa	Because you never truly realize who you cares about about until someone else is with them. i have done it|`|8e373a7bc6b3c784f2bae9cc02a6cf20aa	They do it because even though they don't want the guy any more, they don't want anyone else to have him either.  It's selfish and immature.  They still want to be number one with him.|`|BO28Mn8haa	because we don't like the thought of them finding something better. or someone else "winning over what was ours" so we just want to reassure ourselves that we still "got it"|`|20c96a5e1e1d8742c7835d3700704d38aa	Because boys are supposed to spend the rest of their lives pining over us and wishing that they still had a chance to be with us. And when they stop all that pining it makes us insecure-stupid I KNOW, but when I was young that's basically what it boiled down to.|`|im9pEXkGaa	I think it has to do with the fact that we don't like to see how easily you got over us. Maybe. I dont know? The more I think about it, the harder it is now to think of why we really do.|`|XkPgw7ZRaa	It is an ownership issue. They feel that they still have a vested interest due to past involvement.  It eventually fades away through time.<br>  <br>  Anthony|`|JDRj44xMaa	I think it has something to do with attachment.. If people are still emotionally attracted to their ex's, they get a tad jealous?
a05818703edf627a70c2368c5b12f69daa	she is calm because she is not the one who got hurt, if u can avoid this girl i would do it. but him working with her would be another problem, because i would always be wondering in the back of my mind if he were cheating on me. whenever he was late or i did not know where he was i would be upset. but u know this is not the way love is suppose to feel, and if a man cheats on you he did make the choice, this woman did not force him. so u have to decide if this is the man u want to marry. personally from all i know now, from gaining wisdom through life, from being cheated on by people, i would not be with him, i would end it now before he did it to me again and shattered my trust again. unless a woman has permanent amnesia she is never going to forget being betrayed, and she knows he chose someone over her. it does destroy the ego, and u never again feel the way u did about this person, because u can't un ring a bell, u can't turn back time.|`|VSWl45cKaa	Take the high road. Be cool but civil. Do that for your self-respect. <br>  <br>  Why stay with a guy who would do that? Don't you think it could happen again? He isn't the only guy in the world.|`|7e8be8f471de4c60d8884f52a597ddc2aa	Tell her that you know, she might think that she is getting away with something tell her you know and maybe this will end both of you under the same roof.|`|fe9b89ef9075d826f6d2b372470173b0aa	Why blame her? She didn't make him cheat on you. Why should she feel any guilt around you? You need to look at the situation realistically. Your guy cheated on you. It makes no difference who it was. He had a good deal to do with that. Besides, does she know that he was your boyfriend? Maybe he lied to her. Maybe you should clear up matters in your own backyard before you start worrying about hers.|`|YTasscmKaa	Keep this in your mind when you're around her. Yeah, he cheated with her, but who is he with? You must be better than her. So, just look down on her that way. That should help calm you down.|`|HjZZGkZVaa	*****-slap her!|`|3ee8101ef611dcb2fe20c82dfe728d6caa	You seem to have no problem being around your boyfriend, and HE is the one that messed up, not her. You have decided to blame her for what happened and decided to forgive him because that makes your life easier. He is the one that is supposed to be committed to you, he is the one that decided to cheat. Even if she knew about you, she has no loyalties to you, but he did. Stop putting your rage towards her and put it where it belongs.|`|vyNlyfczaa	you sound that you are this one who did something wrong! Tell her that you know, and you don't like her and it's going to be the best for all of you if she is going to stay away from you! she is the slut not you!|`|aSoCKVJ3aa	I would refuse to go around her if at all possible, if it affects you like this. Your boyfriend should certainly understand this.  If he doesn't try to explain it to him as you've explained it here. good Luck (:|`|Ag8pE3Cyaa	How come she doesn't know that you know? Don't tell me your boyfriend asked you to keep it to yourself! Why don't you confront her? Why don't you let it all out!!! why spare her??|`|AA11773731	Just try not to be around her. But you should confront him. Do you have enough evidence, are you waiting for the right time?|`|8PDzaAJcaa	Why are you still with this guy? How do you act around him knowing what he did?|`|AA12261142	ignore her and if she asks why u are ignoring her tell her u know she is a whore for sleeping around|`|AdeD0xMuaa	Do you have to be around her? I wouldn't be able to stand it...|`|NUSgnkdVaa	Well first its payback on him for cheating. That's first and for most. then you beat the S*** out of her. i would not be able to stand that. <br>  <br>  Or you could go the settle way and tell them both that you know and the slap both of them... that's as settle as i would be.|`|mjd1qjy7aa	That is a normal feeling after you've been betrayed. Try to avoid her as much as you can. When my ex-hub left me for his current wife, I could not stand the sight of her. I blocked her face on my head that to this date, I couldnt even remember what she looks like.|`|OaOf4oxQaa	Stay away from her for your own good, and leave that cheating man. You deserve something better. If he would really love you, he wouldn't be working there anymore.|`|ZEitfScGaa	You shouldn't be around her. And he shouldn't be either.|`|GA8uInKDaa	Dump your boyfriend! you are gonna have trouble trusting him and he is workin with her.|`|AP2e90cCaa	She doesn't know?<br>  <br>  Tell her!!|`|HGK3Fb5aaa	tell her you know and tell her to stay away from you and your bf
CWgJ7Yyxaa	I think you are doing what is best for you...Maintain your distance. <br>  <br>  Your MIL will not change; and you need to be smart and make your husband your ally, not push him towards his mother's side. You need to be on the same page as your husband, and act as a team.<br>  <br>  I understand what you mean, and also think that these people were cruel to your kids. Christmas is for children, after all. I'm not saying they cannot express their love for their grandkids... I just feel that so much "favoritism" is mean and negative. Hopefully your husband was able to see this and could accept it wasn't a nice thing to do!<br>  <br>  Talk to your daughters and explain to them that their grandma and you think differently. And that they should do what you say, not what grandma says. Your husband should be there as well, so they can see he backs you up.<br>  <br>  Good luck. It's hard to deal with negative and toxic people like your MIL. Protect your heart....Set limits and boundaries,  and try to pray for her.|`|0SIhrYCbaa	12 and 8 y/o's are not sexy for heavens sake. The woman sounds like a nut. They don't need make up or skimpy clothes. Does she want them to be hookers at 14? <br>  I think I'd keep her at arms length like you have and enjoy the peace and quiet.|`|haCssg2Laa	you, and your boys should NOT be subjected to this<br>  and your husband should be more supportive<br>  to treat your children the way she has is unforgivable<br>  she SHOULD be an adult about all of this and she clearly isnt<br>  <br>  i know it may rock the boat<br>  but i would stay away, and keep my children away<br>  what a horrible selfish childish woman<br>  <br>  to allow the girls to do the things she does, against your wishes too is awful,<br>  sorry, wouldnt be me|`|vgqMJU3zaa	To start off you and unfortunately your boys are going to have to understand that your in-laws are ignorant and, depending on their ages, set in their ways.  So your sons will have to deal with getting nothing at Christmas, birthdays ETC.  Or at least until your husband stands up to his parents and tells them he expects them to buy at least some small token to make "his" stepsons feel welcome. <br>  Telling a12 yr old and  8yr old they are sexy is disturbing.  This is something that your husband needs to put a stop to their grandmother is giving them wrong signals and leading them down a very bad path.  <br>  You can politely listen to her 2cents advice but you do not have to follow it.  You do not need to be her friend but for your husbands sake and the sake of your stepdaughters be congenial.  Remember this woman is telling your stepdaughters that they are sexy and buying them inapproiate things.  You want to keep a close eye on what she does and you cannot accomplish that if you are not around to watch over the girls and be there to block any tactics your mother in law may try to work on them.  She may try to turn them against you.|`|aSoCKVJ3aa	I think you are right to stay away for awhile and your husband should support you, not criticize you. He should see that his mother is trying to drive a wedge between you.  I think 8 years of marriage is long enough for his mother and him to know how all this is affecting you. Stand your ground and things may change.  :)|`|Cwqkbp49aa	Raising your children with the morals and values you want is a very big deal.  I don't think you should just suck it up.  Even though those two girls are not your biological children doesn't mean you don't play a big role in their life.  It sounds like you are their full time mom.  They need to respect you.  Just like your boys do.  How can this happen if she is pulling them in a different direction?<br>  <br>  If I were you, I would set down the rules and let the grandmother know she needs to abide by them.  If she can't, then she can not take the kids out on special trips or buy them clothes.  As far as treating everyone fairly, that may come over time.  You may and try to get her to spend more time with your boys so she can appreciate them more.  Maybe you can make a rule.  What applies to one child applies to all of them.  If one of them gets a birthday present, they all do.  Otherwise, nobody is getting a present.  Something like that.  You don't want the kids to see a divide on how they are being treated.  There will be jealousy down the road.<br>  <br>  Good luck...in-laws can be a big pain in the a$$ if you let them be!|`|NnN4drsbaa	In certain situation its better to be "stuck up" or " stand-offish", you know why, people don't FK with you. Once you let your guard down around that woman she will try to manipulate the situation. Why do that? She's going to manipulate the situation anyways so it's better to let her hesitate about crossing you. Make her butt work for her ill doings. Dont hand it to her. That way she may get tired and give up|`|cDRXtuJCaa	I think if she can be so cruel to get her grandaughters  a bundle of present and not even given your kids a token gift she showing she real a heartless old witch,as your kids have done nothing to her,( my sister has a step child and are whole familly buy her gifts for christmas easter ect and she doesnt even live with them full time)<br>  I also make sure your husband backs you if your now playing the role as step mum,if your mother in law breaks these rules then i think you both need to limit her acess for a period of time for she trying to divide your home,your husband really needs to wake up to this as many second marriage fail due to situation just like this <br>  I think you should tell her how she makes you feel and your not trying to make thing awkward but you need to parent as you see fit,and she needs to give you space to do it,|`|bO2rzfISaa	I think it's unreasonable to expect your in laws to buy gifts for your boys. You should take a leadership role in making your kids feel ok about it. Blended families are all different, and it's all about expectations. If your kids expect it to be the way it is (facing reality) they will be ok with it.<br>  <br>  Your MIL probably is screwed up in her thinking and believes that women are only good for sex. Pathetic, and not something she should be allowed to pass along to little girls. However, you see it as a violation of your rules instead of a sickness on her part.<br>  <br>  Your husband is right. You are holding grudges. <br>  <br>  Interestingly, you don't blame your FIL for any of this. He could've bought the kids Christmas gifts, but you don't blame him. Women take their MIL's actions so personally. This is all about your thinking, not her actions. If you can't adapt, go to therapy. Your thinking isn't helping anyone.|`|AA10248966	You wrote:<br>  <br>  My mother-in-law...is always telling me "what I need to do ".... She always tells my daughters they are sexy and gets their eyebrows waxed and nails done (really long ones),and buying them skimpy clothes, lets them wear makeup. She knows I don't allow this but she still does it.<br>  <br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  Listen: She is a child abuser, plain and simple. Husband and you must get into marriage counseling about the mother in law. I'd stay far from the mother in law as possible. She is contributing to child abuse and sexual promiscuity...You do not say if you have legally adopted them, but if so, you MUST proptect them. If you are not adopted parent, then therapy for you and hubby ius called for in any case<br>  <br>  Grandma is a pervert nut job, end of discussion. She has also tried top undermine you... and in therapy, you and hubby must get to the bottom of how you will protect the girls... and husband allows it too. I think he's tied to mommy's apron string and he needs a pair of balls and he is no man<br>  <br>  Forget the gifts thing. You and hubby have to tell the kids who get nothing that the other set of grandparents who get all the kids are generous. <br>  <br>  Counseling is mandated here. Also, mother in law pries into others' affair and has no boundaries, a sign of future disturbances. Sounds like grandpa can't stand up to her without fearing for his safety.<br>  <br>  I'd make sure husband agrees to stay away from them with you until all issues are resolved to YOUR joint satisfaction in therapy. <br>  <br>  It could happen that you and your sons might have top split.

YQ1Q7XeEaa	OK it's time to be mature and grow up a bit and understand this from a former kid brother:<br>  <br>  Little brothers are designed to get on your nerves - it stinks but its true.<br>  <br>  Let him have his little macBook.  Yours will still be way cooler because it is yours customized with your stuff.|`|gfHutvEFaa	In the long run, who really cares??? Don't sweat the small stuff.

Macbooks are crazy expensive so maybe you could factor that into the conversation when talking to your parents. Maybe you can talk them into getting it for him at a later time (like a birthday). Maybe you can talk your brother or parents into getting him a different kind of Macbook.<br>  <br>  It really does stink when you just got something new and your younger sibling wants the same thing. I know because my younger brother was always taking my stuff when we were younger. He stopped when he got his own things that were individual from mine.<br>  <br>  Perhaps your brother thinks he wants a Macbook because you have one. Maybe he'd actually be happy with something else? The Apple store has a bunch of neat gadgets (like an iTouch). Maybe your parents can see your side if you present them your position and the alternative calmly and maturely (they'll see you as the more "grown up" one). Good luck!|`|thoMmZAvaa	Wow, having parents that are generous enough to buy you a new laptop (and a mac at that) is a fortunate thing. Maybe you should concentrate on appreciating the nice things that are being done for you instead of starting problems with your brother. Hopefully your parents won't soon regret having done something nice for you.
djUMvICoaa	You don't have to push your family away to push their problems aside.  But you have to tell them that and then you have to stick to it.  Unless you do, as you already know, they will end up pulling you down to  their level.  Tell them it's nice to say hi but if things come up that  you have no part of you will have to end the call.  and then do it.  It is called tough love.  They won't want you on the outside and will want to talk with you when they aren't ticked off at each other but don't get yourself involved in it, it's not your fight.  I did something of the same thing, when I found out how messed up I became because of what my parents were doing I had to pull back completely, not even going for the holidays.  Even then I got a call saying I shouldn't do it, and it was hard not to but I kept my stand, I had to for my own sake.  Now I go back and take it in small doses, understanding I can't change them but I can live a healthier lifestyle.  That's my choice, that's what is important for me.  Even phone calls are shorter when I feel they are going to the old places.  good luck|`|UceTC8wFaa	I've dealt with the same thing and it's caused alot of problems in my life and my relationships. You need to draw some kind of a line for your family so they understand you have your own life and problems you need to deal with and they have theirs. You can't fix anyone. I'm not saying you shouldn't be supportive of your family or push them out of your life completely. Help where you can. You can listen to their problems and give advice but don't take their problems on as your own. I found when I let go and stopped trying to be the "care taker" they seemed to find their own way to deal with things and conversations became less stressful. Just because your family decided to make bad decisions for themselves it doesn't mean you need to be dragged down with them. Your family will find their way and so will you. Good luck to you.|`|xc8bnpCvaa	I have 2 sisters like that. I generally avoid talking to them. I know that sounds bad but if you are trying to keep your life on track you may have to put some distance for a while. <br>  Suggestions:<br>  1. Find and give them information on places that can offer them help<br>  2. try to get them involved in church or something like that <br>  3. Tell them that you love them, but explain what kind of strain their problems are causing YOUR relationship<br>  4. If all else fails, avoid them for a while. Then take an afternoon and do a family meeting. Tell them what you will and will not deal with. <br>  At some point you have to live your life for you.

KWeU8LJtaa	I was actually in the exact same position as you about two years ago. <br>  <br>  He was my closest friend and I trust him, we had dated and I did love him in a way..but I knew I had no future with him, I couldn't picture myself being with him for the rest of my life. He was perfect if you were to write it down on paper (based on our similarities) ..but IT was just not there for me. It's really hard to explain.<br>  <br>  What I did was finally just say NO enough is enough, if we didn't stop dating it was just going to continue to be a circle of me leading him on, us being friends,then dating again..it was endless.<br>  <br>  Tell him you're sorry and you can't control how you feel, and keep telling him as much as you need to. Eventually you'll find someone new and reality will sink in for him. It just takes time.<br>  <br>  You need to take care of you and move on with your life. When I did, I ended up finding the man I'm going to marry :) <br>  <br>  Good luck :)|`|f6ab3ae3fee781c3975ea305670f972faa	Make it clear to him that you love him like a brother.  Tell him he is a great friend and you are very fond of him but you can never feel for him the way that he feels for you and that he deserves to have a woman who loves him in that way.<br>  <br>  then tell him that hanging around you is not healthy for him if he can't see himself with anyone else as long as you are in the picture.  Tell him that the two of you need time and space apart from each other so that you can each seek out the partners you desire and deserve.  <br>  <br>  After that, if he continues to hang around and make a nuisance of himself, then you'll have to get stern and tell him to go away and leave you alone.  Don't be afraid to get a restraining order if he becomes really obnoxious or begins sabotaging your new relationships.<br>  <br>  As long as he feels romantic or sexual love for you, you can never really be true friends.  He has to get past those feelings first.  Some people do and they become your very best friends and some people can never get to that place.  They instead go from loving you to hating you because you broke their heart.|`|JDRj44xMaa	Kelsha, I almost felt like you took my thoughts away.. That's exactly how I feel. It feels kinda crummy that we almost have (had) the 'perfect' man.<br>  <br>  I think it boils down to pheromones. No matter how much I try to look at him in 'that' way, he just seems like a brother, not that he's ugly, just.. Idk.<br>  <br>  I think you did the right thing. That's life I guess?|`|AA10451868	Your better looking than that dude. Im in the same situation. I cant seem to get off with her. I thinks its the cottage cheese on her butt.|`|TrEYixLXaa	You need to tell him that he need's to MOVE ON.|`|NpqAbZqpaa	I have a number of friends that I would have loved to explore a relationship with, however, like you, there's been no attraction to me for them.<br>  <br>  I don't hound them wondering why it isn't so.  I accept that it's better for me (and them) if we are friends rather than my trying to push myself on them and them rejecting me and then we don't talk.<br>  <br>  I would simply say, I love you, I really do, but I'm not in love with you.<br>  <br>  You have a few scenarios.  Would you want to just be my very good friend and that's it, or do you really want to create a situation where I have to decide between your way and the high way (and you will choose the high way)<br>  <br>  You could ask him if the roles were reversed, what would he do.<br>  <br>  If he won't accept your friendship without the relationship, then that's a really good indication of how strong the bond really is.|`|hcFsspczaa	Sometimes physical attraction comes after love...sometimes not.  It sounds like you've done your best to give a relationship with him a shot, and it just didn't work out.  Let him know that he's very important to you as a friend, but that friends is all that you will ever be.  And do it soon because the longer this drags out the higher his hopes will be.  You should never feel pressured into being with someone if you don't want to be.|`|b19JZTtnaa	give it a time, don't rush in anything,no to separate fast, or not to rush in relationship fast, give it time and if u wont feel more for him eventually he will get the massage, but if u fall for him, then it will be ok<br>  <br>  just don't rush|`|EKHvRJPcaa	I've had this same problem.. It seems like you've done all you can do, now unfortunately it will just take time for him to move on. He says he's madly in love with you so obviously he's not going to be okay with you breaking it off right away. Give him time =)|`|Mr9McLtiaa	Kiss him see if sparks fly, if they dont uve got ur answer.<br>  <br>  I had a neighbor who was my bff.  I had always been attracted to blk men never a white guy so.. He kept after me and I was like umm im  not attracted sry lets be friends.  One day he sprung a kiss on me and my knees went weak.  Oh yeah me likey now.<br>  <br>  So take it from me, before u chuck a sweet guy, test the waters first.|`|g8qHXXxtaa	Looks aren't everything.<br>  <br>  Look at yourself. i doubt you in a male appearance would be better looking than him.|`|BL4PEjAWaa	you are so shallow.  You are not the one for him.|`|028xaZCeaa	When you date, you are looking for the one you marry. Just think about it. If this isn't the man you could see yourself marrying then that is your decision and is not wrong. It sounds like you do care about his feelings which is nice of you. I would tell him for the last time your decision and then if he continues that be firm with him. You don't need to be with anyone to make them happy you need to worry about your happiness and he is obviously not it. tell him the truth if you have to and tell him that he is a wonderful person and can find someone he deserves that will appreciate him.|`|AA11944397	You've got it right, you love him-but you're not in love with him.  There's absolutely nothing that you can do to change that either.  If you're not physically attracted to someone, there's little they can do to change that.  If you honestly cannot see yourself marrying him or having kids with him, then it's really not meant to be.  <br>  I've been in a similar situation, and it's hard to be that honest with someone.  But you can't lie to yourself and deny the fact that you don't have feelings for him, it's not fair to either one of you.  <br>  My best advice, is to be honest with him.  And tell him that you're feelings are not going to change.  He may be a great best friend-but that's all he is to you.  <br>  Good luck!|`|ivejg4whaa	Tell him that you don't feel romantically compatible with him. There's no use dragging him or yourself through a relationship that isn't going to work in the end. <br>  It will only get harder with time to let it go.|`|744oiB6saa	He'll eventually figure out you're shallow and he'll move on to the one he's supposed to be with. Sorry.
vbUa5caXaa	not all boys are the same, maybe he does get a little aroused but he won't show it coz he might not know how you feel about it, or maybe he's a little worried about how you'd react<br>  Talk to him about it if your a little concerned, but i doubt there would be a problem with it :)|`|AA10451868	He's just not that in to you.|`|ablriuUVaa	it takes more then kissing to get turned on for some guys like myself.<br>  even more whn ur use to kissing that person<br>  <br>  the other guys have to learn to control there hormones<br>  <br>  i wouldnt worry bout it.<br>  <br>  those other guys are probably one minute men|`|DhbpDYHhaa	well guys have diffrent reactions no offense but maybe your friends boyfriends are only getting more excited because they think they can get a little bit more farther and your boyfriend respects you and he cares about you so hes not stupid like those other guys you have a good boyfriend|`|BL4PEjAWaa	since I don't know your age I will be very general in my  answer.  If you b/f is between the age of 12 and 50 he is excited when you are making out.|`|86hEn6mgaa	show him a little skin...you'll get a rise out of him in no time...
AcgDcQG0aa	It's up to your husband to handle this situation.  And the best you can do is support him.|`|dK2Zv21Daa	Don't you mean His X Wife ?    this problem is non of yours, fact is I don't even see or understand what's your beef.  Like I always say if  you don't want to deal  with the chickens then stay as far as possible from the hen house don't  Let him be the man  and unless he ask  you , be silence
ABEO4XqQaa	first of all u will have to obtain an stay order from session court on the order of maintenance passed by jm. then u can also make an appeal for the cancellation of order on sufficient ground if available. and dude there is no aricle which talks about ur question.|`|AA10684513	You would need to ask the court that question or maybe even post it in the law section.
QIkAqFsbaa	I think you are more to him than just friends. He may also be afraid to take that step with you since you two have been friends for so long and that you have a baby. Give him time to work his feelings out for you. Maybe you should stay away from him for a bit , give him the spcace to think things through. If he comes around then and commits , then I'm sure it will be fine with you. If not, you may have just lost a good best friend. You hang in there and hope for the best. Good luck|`|mMsjb43Iaa	Wow, this is a tricky situation.  Really you should just be honest with yourself and with "Andrew" about what you want.  Do you even know for sure what you want?  Do you think you two could be together successfully and that your relationship would be the same or better?  You clearly care for this man a great deal.  One question I would ask myself if I were in your shoes, is if I truly love him, or if I care deeply for him and I'm infatuated with him.  There is a major difference there.  And really, either way is fine!  Your answer may change how you approach the situation though.  I would first determine how I really feel about him, and don't be afraid to be honest with yourself about good and the bad aspects.  Second, once you determine how you yourself feel, you should go to him and talk to him about it.  Either way, it's still important to talk about what happened the other night and whether your relationship will change because of it.  <br>  <br>  I would say it's important for you both to figure out how strong your feelings are.  You have a wonderful little boy who may end up very confused if you aren't able to tell him who exactly "Andrew" is to him.  Is he a father, a friend, a neighbor?  And if you tell him one now, will it change in the future?  <br>  <br>  As far as how to approach it?  Again, once you know how you feel about him, you'll be better able to answer that question.  The best advice I can give you is to be brave and honest!  If he's really your friend, he'll understand and probably even agree with much of what you're saying to him as you share your confusion and desire to determine what your relationship is with each other.  One tip from woman to woman though, if he seems to be reluctant or again says that he thinks you two should be just "friends" after this, it may be too difficult to be around him as much as you previously were.  Sex does change everything, for better or worse.  He said he wanted to love someone before having sex with them, which implies he didn't feel that way for you previously.  It may be time to ask him if his feelings have changed in that regard.  If not, you may need a little distance to sort out your thoughts and figure out where to go from there.  I expect though, that your friendship will keep you together either way, your relationship may just be a little different from now on.  Remember, honesty is always the best policy!<br>  <br>  This is a difficult situation and I will be thinking about you and wishing you well.  Good luck!
drEfr9waaa	Perhaps he's treading water because now you've shown interest he's wanting to know what really happened.  He might want to know what you are like in a relationship or perhaps with his cuz having a dismal record, he wants to know what you went through.  All just guesses.  The poor guy was probably just asking a curious question.|`|emKXU1QFaa	He's interested in you.  He knows his cousin and knows you so he's curious, was it his cousin's fault?  Did you guys just fall out of love?  He was also testing the waters to make sure you still don't have feeling for your ex.|`|J1Frx83haa	sorry|`|dtHjJah5aa	Sounds like he likes you and maybe wants to get 'involved' with you.  He probably heard his cousin's reason for you two breaking up and now he wants to hear your side, just to decide for himself before anything actually happens between you two.|`|4KDcxFWGaa	Blackmail
