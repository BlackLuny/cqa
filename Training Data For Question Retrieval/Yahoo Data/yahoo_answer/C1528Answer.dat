How's that for coincidence...?!!!|`|CkKlZFVmaa	loved them both, and the flavor did not die within 2 minutes.  It is hard to say which was my favorite, but I am a black licorice lover to this day.

Seriously, The Bible is truth. It's the ONLY prophetic book with a 100% track record That, in most countries, is perfect! True, pure science validates The Bible at every encounter, which, shouldn't surprise anyone since it was written in The Bible before man had a clue. Where do you think all these great men got the ideas to puzzle out??. Man, has never had an original thought, just in case your wondering. Here are just a few facts which have been released, but you never heard them on the news, or anywhere, for that matter. NASA, using the "laws" of planetary motion, discovered several historic facts running the program backwards, that are ONLY written in The Bible. No where else in written history, only there.Another amazing find was the real Mt Sinai, which was photographed, and documented in all places, Saudi Arabia, behind armed guards, dogs, and electrified fence.Hmmm!! In the early 2000's, a team of special CSI agents went to examine the Shroud of Turin, and found it to be authentic, with many new facts which prove it true. If you want to see the real truth, read and study Gods Word for yourself. Eternity in total darkness, extreme heat, continuous torture, and NO hope of escape, well, it is YOUR choice!!
5vqo3XzHaa	Yes, all Christians should be united in standing up against this evil, and we all should be praying for our brothers and sisters in Christ in Connecticut.  Government is overstepping their boundaries by appointing people of their choosing to be members of a board overseeing the collection of monies given to charities/churches.  And, you're right, this won't just affect one denomination if this is passed, it will eventually affect all denominations, because all take in monies in tithes and offerings to support missionaries, feed and clothe the poor, and so forth.  Government has no right overseeing the distribution of these monies.  Thank you for bringing this to our attention.

This is how the Dem's work they change constitutional law to suit them.|`|mdHqr17kaa	Hmm.  <br>  <br>  I actually don't believe that "they" (the authoritarian collectivists) will "start" with the Catholic Church.  "They" include many nominal Catholics in strong, prominent  positions of power in their ranks.<br>  <br>  A notable example is the House Speaker, who was "punished" for her activism on behalf of the present radical change in government, including the aggressive implementation of eugenic policies, with a Papal audience.   <br>  <br>  It must be frustrating for those of the Church who grieve upon seeing see such policies of accommodation.    Again.  <br>  <br>  In any case:  No, "they" don't go after the Church---at first---"they" go after those who are much more vulnerable.  <br>  <br>  "They" already "started" a long time ago upon the much-maligned so-called "fundies."    You know, the "bitter" ones who cling to Bibles, who lack (even forgo) powerful oligarchies, who acknowledge a Judeo-Christian heritage as evidenced upon the Liberty Bell?   <br>  <br>  Where is the Catholic Church when these Americans and their Christian religious beliefs are mocked?  <br>  <br>  How, indeed, does the Church proper regard American Christians who are descendants of the Great Awakening?<br>  <br>  More questions:<br>  <br>  Who did the people of Connecticut support for President?  The DNC is fundamentally antithetical to sanctity of life; statements mean little when contradicted by action taken to empower those whose policies will surely provoke the need for such statements to keep up appearances.<br>  <br>  What did the hosts of the Al Smith Dinner think about Obama's tasteless reference to a manger?   <br>     <br>  A big question:  Why does Georgetown University collaborate with proponents of Wahabbism?  <br>  <br>  Which reminds me of a directly-related question:  What of non-Catholic Christians in places like the former Yugoslavia? <br>  <br>  What of conscientious clergy such as Cardinal Mindszenty who were bartered in the interest of maintaining influence, etc. during *earlier* communist regimes?<br>  <br>  Yes, the Franklin quote by "Future Political Prisoner" is correct indeed.

cIPziIdnaa	You are taking a lot of guff for your question here, but relax - there is such a thing as a gay band.  I can think of one big one right off the bat - the Pet Shop Boys, who had all kinds of 80's hits like "West End Girls", "Go West" (practically a gay anthem all its own) and my personal favorite "Can You Forgive Her?" a really great dance tune about a young man coming to terms with his homosexuality.|`|PNw70xuLaa	I don't know if those bands are considered "gay" or not, but honestly, I think you should just listen to what you want and not care. I didn't listen to any music for a few years because I thought that all of the music I liked would make people think I'm gay, but then I gradually started listening to it in "secret," and now I don't care. Music is awesome and beautiful and wonderful, and I'm glad I realized that or I would feel really alone sometimes.|`|eGvyFeW9aa	You know what's kinda pathetic? :/<br>  Asking if a band would be gay to listen to.

Since you didn't, simply ask him to estimate how much longer it will be. Explain you need this done asap and that he needs to come more often to do so then it would be ok with you. I hope you didn't pay him yet. If you haven't, then do as above and tell him you have X amount of dollars to spend to get the job done by such a date.

We are of our own nations.  I like the term INDIGENOUS.  One, it means we are of the land, this land.  Two, it doesn't contain the name of another country/nation.  Both terms, Indian and Native American, are imposed names.  Not names we called ourselves but names we were called by others and that we, for the most part, have accepted.

When the Europeans came here, there were probably about 10 million Indians populating America north of present-day Mexico. And they had been living in America for quite some time. It is believed that the first Native Americans arrived during the last ice-age, approximately 20,000 - 30,000 years ago through a land-bridge across the Bering Sound, from northeastern Siberia into Alaska. The oldest documented Indian cultures in North America are Sandia (15000 BC), Clovis (12000 BC) and Folsom (8000 BC)<br>  <br>  Although it is believed that the Indians originated in Asia, few if any of them came from India. The name "Indian" was first applied to them by Christopher Columbus, who believed mistakenly that the mainland and islands of America were part of the Indies, in Asia.|`|tliW8jkaaa	native american, they were called indians by accident.<br>  look here.<br>  <a href="http://www.wisegeek.com/why-are-native-americans-called-indians.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.wisegeek.com/why-are-native-a...</a>|`|2jMFurDoaa	The indians are the individuals from india. Christopher Columbus thought he was in India when he saw the natives he referred to them as indians. so history class taught me.<br>  <br>  I am native american or american indian or just indian. it doesnt offend me when im called any of those things. but alot of people now say that they are native american because they were born here and they are right but that by no means makes them american indian. so when i am asked what race i am i usually say american indian because thats most understood.

Christian fundamentalism should be a good thing - it would mean radically following the teachings or Jesus, as outlined n the Bible, more fiercely than others. What would that look like? People loving their enemies, refusing violence, actively loving and caring for the entire world, and not pushng anything on anyone, except for preaching the good news that Jesus actually loves every last human being, and desires them all to live a life of love. The problem with the "Fundies" that you talk about, is taht they are not Fundamental enough (ironically). They would have to push past the rigorous and exhausting process of trying to pass "the right laws" to get the nation to appear more Christian. Ultimately, poitics are not the task of a Christian, because a Christian should just live a life of faithful and loving obedience to Christ, regardless of what the government says he or she can or can not do. If the government made it illegal to be a Christian, and punishable by death, then a Christian would say - alright, fine, but I'm not renouncing my faith. That would be a fundamentalist Christian! <br>  <br>  Now, as for your question. I think Obama's move is a serious one. He is treading a slippery slope.

QhnsPDxfaa	Tool is usually gender-free. Douchebag is (or should be) a feminine thing. To call someone a tool is fairly harmless, to call a guy a doosh is very bad, to call a woman or girl a doosh is extremely harsh. Dangerous word, be careful.|`|dPsaYMOvaa	I would have said the opposite to the first answers, douchebags would be more nerdy and tools would think they are hotsh!t.<br>  I guess it just depends.|`|jd14u32qaa	A tool is someone who gets 'used' (like a tool) or taken advantage of by others.  A douchebag is someone who just acts like an idiot.|`|pMFLqU0Yaa	Similar in one way - both are lacking in the brain sponge area. In other words, well, I *would* say they're both 'tards, but that would be insulting to the people who are actually mentally disabled. They're usually smarter than either a douchebag or a tool.  <br>  <br>  Contrast - a "tool" is someone who isn't smart enough to know they're being used. A "douchebag" is someone who has no idea what they're talking about, period, but usually does not imply they're being used. Douchebags are also notorious for their horrific sense of "fashion". At least one internet meme (that I'm aware of, there could be more) has started that enable you to spot a douchebag by mode of dress so you don't run the risk of having to hear one actually speak. <br>  <br>  Immature to label others that way? Sure. But it's the intertubes. We let just anyone on here, ya know.<br>  <br>  Edit: Forgot to give you a link to the urban dictionary so you can find new, innovative ways to insult people if you so desire. Here ya go! -----><a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.urbandictionary.com/</a>|`|eX2faDejaa	They are similar in nature, only tools tend to be more dorky, while douchebag's think they're hotsh!t.|`|ShhOXGuQaa	when i was in school, we called people who were whimpy a douche,...it was reserved for fairy type males..but that was a long time ago.. i graduated from high school in 1980..|`|ca71864a7589c117d2b87b9453938988aa	The word "Tool" for describing someone would probably mean: "a person who usually gets his way for no apparent reason and would use the person they claim to "love" but in reality they don't and just using them for their own standards.  They usually are very similar to Douche bags because they are."<br>  The word "Douche bag" would mean: Idiotic asshole that only cares about himself in a variety of ways and is willing to be that specific asshole to get his way.

That seems a pretty slim foundation on which to build a friendship.  Also it could be offensive if you are a "*** hag" (only looking for gay male friends) or worse yet, looking for a token gay friend to complete your social circle.<br>  <br>  If on the other hand, you strike up normal friendships with gay men through work, school or mutual acquaintances - I see nothing wrong with it.... as long as it does happen naturally and is not forced or coerced somehow.|`|yDT9k44caa	personally Id rather have someone wanna be friends with me for me rather than how Im labeled but..... hey watever at least you like the minority so thats a good thing|`|Mm7DQWrKaa	i dont really mind. I mean as long as u didnt treat me like crap.|`|PNw70xuLaa	Like, if you just want someone that wouldn't be into you and doesn't have a period then I wouldn't be offended. But if you think and act like that being gay is more than that and effects someone's personality then I would be offended because all being gay is is when you like the same sex. I have friends who don't get that and it's so annoying because they're so stupid and offensive sometimes, but if I told them they'd just laugh and not take it seriously. And now I don't hang out with them much.<br>  <br>  Oh, and what Ethan James said about gay men being a woman in a man's body is TOTALLY WRONG AND IGNORANT. That would be a transsexual male to female or transgender, and they actually feel like they were born in the wrong body. Gay men don't feel that way and like being a man (at least I do). But so little separates the sexes, so I guess I'm just comfortable in my body. I like having a penis, facial hair, leg hair, etc. But it's still offensive to someone if you think and act that way.

The goddesses - including the Muses, Charites (Graces), Horae (Seasons), Aphrodite, Hebe, and Artemis - were especially fond of Apollo, and they sang and danced to welcome his arrival. The god then retired from the company of his fellow Olympians to begin a quest to locate the appropriate site for an oracle. <br>  <br>  After searching far and wide, Apollo finally found a place that pleased him. He informed Telphousa, the resident nature spirit, of his intentions to build a temple at her sacred spring, but the nymph discouraged him from this plan. Telphousa instead suggested that Apollo select Delphi as the site for his shrine, and the god therefore left the spring and continued his journey. Near Delphi, Apollo encountered and killed the enormous serpent Python (the god's priestess was named Pythia to commemorate this event). According to some sources, this in part is the mythological explanation for how the oracle of Apollo was established at Delphi. <br>  <br>  In addition to defeating Python, Apollo also conquered, in various ways, several other notable mythological figures, including the satyr Marsyas, the giant Tityus, and the children of Niobe. Indeed, the god and his sister Artemis together punished both Tityus and Niobe as a form of revenge for the insults these characters had made to their mother Leto. <br>  <br>  Apollo was, however, not just a fighter - like many of the other Olympian gods, he was a lover as well. See the Mythography page about the loves of Apollo (link below) to learn more details about his legendary lovers and his many amorous conquests.

One of his sources was Hecataeus of Abdera, one of a number of ancient authors who drew on the earlier writings of Pytheas of Massalia (Marseilles), an explorer and author of a fragmentary surviving account of the Atlantic fringe of Europe, Ora Maritima (On the Ocean, written c.320 BC).1 Although Diodorus travelled extensively, he is not thought to have visited Britain, and he acknowledges these earlier sources in his account of an island no smaller than Sicily lying beyond the land of the Celts, taken to mean beyond the European (i.e. Gallic) mainland: <br>  <br>  ‘This island …is situated in the north and is inhabited by the Hyperboreans who are so called because they live beyond the point where the north wind blows’. We are told that the inhabitants honour Apollo more than any other deity and that this is because of a legend telling how Leto, the consort of Zeus, and mother of the divine twins Artemis and Apollo, was born on this island where: ‘a sacred enclosure is dedicated to him [Apollo]...as well as a magnificent spherical temple adorned with many rich offerings’. Some intriguing clues which could help locate this mysterious island are also given:<br>  <br>   ‘They also say that the moon, as viewed from this island, appears to be but a little distance above the Earth and to have upon it prominences like those of the Earth, which are visible to the eye. The account is also given that the god visits the island every nineteen years, the period in which the return of the stars to the same place in the heavens is accomplished; … At the time of the appearance of the god he both plays on the cithara [lyre] and dances continuously the night through from the vernal equinox until the rising of the Pleiades…’.2<br>  <br>  Is Diodorus referring to Britain, and could this be the earliest documentary reference to Stonehenge?  ...|`|uANc79HCaa	i need a myth for apollo|`|CWWoISqkaa	just create something, maybe he fell in love with someone<br>  <br>  don't plagiarize ^^^^

Get the children up, dressed and fed, off on the school bus, when they came home from school, each child had a chore to do.  In that<br>  routine we had free time where each child could choose what they<br>  wanted to do for fun. My routine was three meals a day from scratch ,laundry for the 7 of us, house work and getting in the firewood for the wood stove. In the spring and summer all the yard work was my alone time and I loved that. Bed time was 8pm until the children were in the tenth grade then it was 10pm.   Now that I am on my own, I have a tiny routine of personal care and the time three times a day for medication.

Really?|`|hjDB62VGaa	White is a color, the perception which is evoked by light that stimulates all three types of color sensitive cone cells in the human eye in near equal amount and with high brightness compared to the surroundings.<br>  <br>  Since the impression of white is obtained by three summations of light intensity across the visible spectrum, the number of combinations of light wavelengths that produce the sensation of white is practically infinite. There are a number of different white light sources such as the midday Sun, incandescent lamps, fluorescent lamps and white LEDs. The impression of white light can also be created by mixing appropriate intensities of the primary colors of light — red, green and blue (RGB) — a process called additive mixing, as seen in many display technologies.<br>  <br>  White light reflected off objects can be seen when no part of the light spectrum is reflected significantly more than others and the reflecting material has a degree of diffusion. This is seen when transparent fibers, particles, or droplets are in a transparent matrix of a substantially different refractive index. Examples include classic "white" substances such as sugar, foam, pure sand or snow, cotton, clouds, and milk. Crystal boundaries and imperfections can also make otherwise transparent materials white, as in the milky quartz or the microcrystalline structure of a seashell. This is also true for artificial paints and pigments, where white results when finely divided transparent material of a high refractive index is suspended in a contrasting binder. Typically paints contain calcium carbonate and/or synthetic rutile with no other pigments if a white color is desired.<br>  <br>  One Love / People Get Ready<br>  Bob Marley<br>  <br>  One Love!<br>  One Heart!<br>  Let's get together and feel all right.<br>  Hear the children cryin'<br>  (One Love!);<br>  Hear the children cryin'<br>  (One Heart!),<br>  Sayin': give thanks and praise<br>  to the Lord and I will feel all right;<br>  Sayin': let's get together<br>  and feel all right.<br>  Wo wo-wo wo-wo!<br>  <br>  Let them all pass all their dirty<br>  remarks (One Love!);<br>  There is one question<br>  I'd really love to ask (One Heart!):<br>  Is there a place for the hopeless sinner,<br>  Who has hurt all mankind just<br>  to save his own beliefs?<br>  <br>  One Love!

0z5JSi0Qaa	Hello, All that i say i am going to say out of respect and kindness. Well... think about it for a moment you feel bad that you are feeling this way. That is a start, it is not becouse you grew up in a religious home, but because the Lord put it in man that we need him. I think the real question u have to ask yourself is have i acepted the Lord as MY saver and BELIEVE in him no matter what. Your parents may be religious type people but that isn't going to help U. Think about this, have u read the whole bible, study on a daily bases, follow his 10 commandments. <br>    If we do not study the science and life of God then what else is there. I will tell you, the studies of satan will come around about you. This is causing the lack in faith and the feeling that you are having. Remember, Faith is believing is something (God) that can't be seen. If we do not study and interact with God on a daily bases then ANYONE is going to lose faith. We are on a planet with a evil creator that wants to destroy us. Look around, people are not getting the picture. Life is not about video games, parties, education, money and etc. Lets say you get all this and Jesus comes, what good is it. It sounds like you know there is a God but question is really do you or really WILL YOU follow him. People love to bash christians and say that it does not work, but lets look at this. Sin never works on the end. We can't see every ones life ,so has a person gotten away with sin?, No.<br>     You, Me and anyone esle can't live between the two worlds of good and evil. You know the right way, and do it for yourself and not your parents, and follow the bible and Gods 10 commandments and not your parents. It all comes down to you and your soul. Spend time with him like you would with a love one. Jesus life was not as a king, and we can't focus  on if things are not going right with us, but trust in him and look to get the ultiment prize, eternal life. He died thinking of me... and you.... and everyone (left his kingly throne). To give us a chance and a free will to love him or not. Hope this gives you some comfort and i hope u get close, becouse the world is not getting better but worse and he will be coming soon. Now, is not the time to fall away from him, or never, thanks take care. Kenny G<br>  <br>  PS- don't believe the science of this world in school. Most of the people writing you make no since and you know this. Be afraid of eternal death, can you aford not to. Why say "o well"|`|4AJkaIkqaa	I used to be like you.  You're right, God doesn't make much since and if you don't believe then it's fine and if you get you're faith back that's fine to but you have to listen to yourself and make a decision based on what you think.  You shouldn't let the fear of hell make you feel like you have to go against what you think because hell is just a form of the churches peer pressure.  Listen to what's inside of you, you'll find you're answer.|`|hQDapmICaa	1Co 15:33  Be not deceived: evil communications corrupt good manners. <br>  <br>  1Co 15:34  Awake to righteousness, and sin not; for some have not the knowledge of God: I speak this to your shame. <br>  <br>  <br>  Run! Don't look back (remember Lot's wife).<br>  <br>  Peace!|`|FOzN3xwzaa	The truth is that JESUS is God, and Jesus loves you so very much!  :D<br>  <br>  Ask Jesus for faith to believe.  He will give it to you!  :) <br>  <br>  Salvation is a FREE GIFT that happens in a split second when you believe in Jesus! It is impossible to lose or "leave" salvation (John 6:39-40, 1 John 5:13). <br>  <br>  The truth about Jesus is that the only way to be saved and to get into heaven and avoid being sent to eternal hell, is by believing in faith alone that Jesus, who is God, died for our sins on the cross as FULL PAYMENT for all our sins, and then Jesus rose from the dead (1 Corinthians 15:1-4). Believe this and you will be in heaven, no matter what! <br>  <br>  Please pray now: "Jesus, please forgive me of my sins. I believe that You died on the cross for my sins and You rose from the dead. Thank You for eternal life!" You will be in heaven with Him forever when you die. :)|`|TYstsM7Yaa	Ahh you are going through what i went through for a while it sounds like.

Fowler. He says there are 6: Projective, Literal, Conventional, Reflective, Conjunctive, and Universalizing.<br>  <br>  He says in stage 4 (reflective) we tend to become disillusioned, which may be where you are. While lots of people remain there throughout their lives, there is a way to move on. Its interesting reading. <br>  <br>  Here's my personal opinion and it will sound counter-intuitive: God wants us to have faith, to believe in something that we can't see, or logically explain, because it's the only way we grow spiritually. If we're ever to understand God, we have to walk into the darkness (sometimes for a long while), but the light will appear. <br>  <br>  And we place a lot of faith in science as well. I, for one, have never seen an atom, but I trust they're around because all the great scientists say they are. I didn't see the Big Bang.

Most scientists (including me) don't believe in a god because there is no evidence for any god.<br>  <br>  I don't understand why you want your faith back though....is that more important to you than the truth?<br>  <br>  My answer is really lame but I just don't know what to say to you....too many things I want to say all at once and so I am not really saying anything.<br>  <br>  Not believing in a god is no bad thing.

You just ignore facts and evidence???......Scientists don't make it up. You can even do it yourself. If they make it up prove them wrong! That's what science is all about, advancing through evidence and truth and you blindly dismiss is because of your religion. Thats why faith is bad, because it teaches you to accept things against reason and evidence. Wow look in the bible and that will give you answers. Is that the part of the bible that tells parents to stone rebellious sons to death? or that people die because a women listened to a talking snake? I'm so glad the world isn't full of blinded people like yourself because we would be living in the dark ages where the earth was flat and at the centre of the universe.|`|FmazIF6Maa	Just keep reading, learning, thinking it through. <br>  <br>  Some people are able to reconcile a belief in God and an acceptance of Science.|`|mYAbq6fnaa	well, i just try to ignore that kind of stuff that i learn in science class. the whole thing is is that the scientists that did those experiments and have those theories do not believe in god, so they dont know that god's word is truth. if they would just read the bible, they could find stuff that they've been looking for forever that was already predicted in the bible. just trust god and give your life over to him. you have to know that he loves you and will always be there for you, dont doubt that. just pray to god and ask him to help you through this. god tests us and our faith throughout our life to see if we're true christians and to see if we trust him. good luck and god bless!|`|ZoPln7vaaa	PRAY to GOD saying you want to believe in HIM and don't wanted to get lost in this World, HE will surely help you, I'm a former atheist myself who was dead against the existence of GOD but now I have a very intimate relationship with HIM... its a big story.... so ask HIM, and I bet HE will surely help you to find HIM because HE HIMSELF said that "Seek and You Shall Find" <br>  <br>  All the best :-)|`|31cc91292d4acf2ddc9a6d449e86868eaa	God created science!<br>  <br>  You can't disprove God with the same universe, planet, creatures, people and the laws of science and math that God created!<br>  <br>  Just going to Church isn't enough, pray and read the Bible for answers<br>  <br>  Trust in God and you will be clarified|`|Y6odIQgJaa	Congratulations!<br>  <br>  You have just proven that your brain works, unlike a lot of other people.<br>  <br>  Those huge doubts are healthy!<br>  <br>  Perhaps your parent's religion isn't the right one for you....

HOQp0gA7aa	This sounds like homework help, but I will give it a shot.  The Mississippi River in Mark Twain's The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn acts as a few different symbols in the book.  <br>  <br>  The first symbol the river presents is as the path to freedom.  Huck and Tom are riding the raft down the river so that Tom can escape his life of slavery to get to a life of freedom.<br>  <br>  The second symbol presented by the river is the inexorable nature of slavery.  Even though Huck and Tom are trying to escape Tom's slavery, the river keeps drawing them further south and to the lands where slavery is much more harsh than in Hannibal Missouri.<br>  <br>  The third symbol of presented by the river is the flow of the plot.  Huck and Tom follow the river, unable to escape the fact that it is drawing them into deeper and deeper trouble with every mile passed.  <br>  <br>  I hope this helps.

My friends tend to be Christian, Muslim, atheists, and other beliefs.  Some of them think my atheism is cooler than others, but that doesn't really matter to me.<br>  <br>  I became an atheist after looking deeply into my religious beliefs, other religious beliefs, and the natural of belief in general.<br>  <br>  Actually, among people I've known, I find that atheists tend to know more about religion than religious people.  That's because many of them actually deconverted after really looking into their beliefs, unlike most religious people.|`|30da49ce7350d87aa6b90301d5bc7940aa	Since the only reason to accept anything in the Bible that has ever been advanced is that it's the Word of God no one who doesn't believe in God would have any reason to read it, or to believe anything it says if they did.  I have no idea who you think the "leader of the atheists" might be, or why you claim atheism is a religion, but no atheist I've ever met would agree that such a person existed or that they practice any kind of religion.

I didn't turn away from christianity because it was cool. I started to turn away from it when I was roughly 7 years old, sitting in a pew at mass when the preacher kept telling us every wednesday to bow our heads, accept jesus into our hearts and ask for him to save us. You know what? I never felt anything. I kept at it, lying to myself and forcing myself to try and "feel" something until I finally burned myself out. I decided that christianty was not my path. At 13 I became agnostic. At 16 became pagan. I am now a high preistess in 3 diffrent traditions. I am 36 years old. Relating to the universe and knowing that I am connected to it physically, emotionally and spiritually is all I need to feel fulfilled in my life. No deity can do that for me, nor have they ever. You can keep lying to yourself, but you know, YOU KNOW that jesus isn't there. But as soon as you question, you mentally slap yourself back and force yourself to believe again. Its stupid and I hope that some day you will be strong enough to let go of the childhood trama your parents made you endure. <br>  <br>  Oh and before you go on to the "you are a pagan you can't be athiest" Look at the websters defintion of Atheism.

tYqUutidaa	The Theatre of Dionysus was a major open air theatre in ancient Greece, built at the foot of the Athenian Acropolis and forming part of the temenos of "Dionysus Eleuthereus" (or Eleutherios, for "Dionysus, the Liberator"). Dedicated to Dionysus, the god of plays and wine (among other things), the theatre could seat as many as 17,000 people, making it an ideal location for ancient Athens' biggest theatrical celebration, the Dionysia. It became the prototype for all theatres of ancient Greece.

These are His power.<br>  AMOS 3:6  Shall there be evil in a city, and the LORD hath not done it.<br>  JOB 2:10  Shall we not receive evil?<br>  LAMENTATION 3:38  Proceedeth not evil and good?<br>  AMOS 3:6  Shall there be evil in a city, and the LORD hath not done it.<br>  ISAIAH 45:7 I make peace, and create evil:<br>  PSALMS 139:12 Yea, the darkness hideth not from thee.<br>  DEUTRONOMY 32:39  I kill, and I make alive;<br>  1 SAMUEL 2:6-7 The LORD killeth, and maketh alive:<br>  HOSEA 6:1 For he hath torn, and he will heal us.<br>  EZEKIEL 7:9  Ye shall know that I am the LORD that smiteth.<br>  JOB 5:18 For he maketh sore, and bindeth up: he woundeth.<br>  JEREMIAH 32:42  Like as I have brought all this great evil upon this people.<br>  ISAIAH 54:16 And I have created the waster to destroy.<br>  JOB 12:23 He increaseth the nations, and destroyeth them.<br>  AMOS 2:9 Yet destroyed I the Amorite before them,<br>  PSALMS 78:49  Sending evil angels among them.<br>  JUDGES 9:23 Then God sent an evil spirit. <br>  1 SAMUEL 16:14,15 And an evil spirit from the LORD troubled him. <br>      &18:10  The evil spirit from God came upon Saul. <br>  1 KINGS 22:21-23  Lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets.<br>  There are more verses to proved the All mighty power of God.|`|tI1NHwfBaa	What is evil?  I think it's simply the rejection of God's will; it's rebellion against God.<br>  <br>  Clearly Satan rebelled before the creation of man.  In Gen 3:22, God is saying that man has become "like us" and has the ability to be evil, and thus he must be prevented from being an eternal being.<br>  <br>  Isa 45:7 is not talking about evil as in rebellion against God.  The NIV translates this word as "disaster" and the NASB translates it as "calamity."  From the context of the scripture it's apparent that God is not speaking of evil in the rebellion-against-God sense, as this is both contrary to scripture and is illogical -- for how could God rebel against himself?<br>  <br>  In Gen 8:21, God is saying that the problem isn't creation, it's man and man's sinfulness.|`|AQ74jcKEaa	No. What I think you have to get out that verse is that God even gave the angels a free-will. With a free-will, we have the right to make our own decisions without interference from God. If we did not have a free-will, we would be no better than robots with God programming us to love Him.|`|TYstsM7Yaa	Well either way it does not make sense. God is omnipotent couldn't he get rid of evil before creating man? or did he choose not too?|`|FmbwIbtzaa	If you knew the story of the Lucifer rebellion you would know that many turned away from Jesus and God including angles. <a href="http://www.urantia.org/papers/paper53.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.urantia.org/papers/paper53.ht...</a><br>  <br>  We are always bothered with the unthinking question as to why the all-wise Creators permit evil and sin. We fail to comprehend that both are inevitable if we are to be truly free. The free will of evolving human or exquisite angel is not a mere philosophic concept, a symbolic ideal. Man's ability to choose good or evil is a universe reality. This liberty to choose for oneself is an endowment of the Supreme Rulers, and they will not permit any being or group of beings to deprive a single personality in the wide universe of this divinely bestowed liberty--not even to satisfy such misguided and ignorant beings in the enjoyment of this misnamed personal liberty.

Some of your question i didnt really understand though but if your asking that if there is evil then is God evil then the answer is no. Evil is the ABSENCE of God.|`|H8KQh4Jkaa	God isn't evil and that's all I really care about:) <br>  Beings participate in evil because God made that a consequence of Adam and Eve eating the fruit off the tree. Jesus and Angels are in Heaven because they accepted God and Jesus of course isn't evil...but they can do whatever they want. You know Lucifer (the devil) was an angel, and he participated in evil, and look where it got him and all those other angels that are now demons.

19922ecff123841b68f933197d10192baa	It means that sin has brought Death into the world, whereas Christ Brings Life to the world.|`|9YMLsk7Taa	For the wages of sin is death but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord. Sin results in death (of the soul), but God gives us eternal life when we believe in Jesus Christ. Hope that helps, blessings to you....|`|WjRqYf6naa	So, Rom_6:23, The gift of God is eternal life. Heaven is life, consisting in the vision and fruition of God; and it is eternal life, no infirmities attending it, no death to put a period to it. This is the gift of God. The death is the wages of sin, it comes by desert; but the life is a gift, it comes by favour. Sinners merit hell, but saints do not merit heaven. There is no proportion between the glory of heaven and our obedience; we must thank God, and not ourselves, if ever we get to heaven. And this gift is through Jesus Christ our Lord. It is Christ that purchased it, prepared it, prepares us for it, preserves us to it; he is the Alpha and Omega, All in all in our salvation.|`|AQ74jcKEaa	It is almost self explanatory. Verse 3:23 says we all have sinned and fell short of the glory of God. Therefore the wages we have to pay for those sins is death or forever separation from God. However, Jesus paid the price for our sins and we do not have to be separated from God but gain eternal life through the acceptance of the price Jesus paid.|`|6173ede5e3ea0a8b44522ccd89de7fe0aa	"For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord."<br>  <br>  It means that, since we all sin, we receive the "wages" of that, which is death - which is why we all die. But if we have Christ, we receive the gift of eternal life, and will be resurrected from that death when Christ returns, making death null and void.|`|hZjPYyFTaa	Death - Temporal, spiritual, and eternal. Is the due wages of sin; but eternal life is the gift of God . Evil works merit the reward they receive: good works do not. The former demand wages: the latter accept a free gift.|`|daf653722b9a000bcaed6ea65b1dc5e6aa	Running short of time, Paul is trying to express many things in as little words as possible.<br>  <br>  He is trying to explain to the church in Rome, how sin enslaves and how the gift of God, thru faith in Christ frees them. They had to be able to connect that to their reality, they were in Rome, remember? Seeing slaves on the streets on market day, or in their households, or they themselves being so, it was easy for them to make the connection.<br>  <br>  Put simply, the wages (something that you have to earn, work for) of sin is death. But the gift (something you do nothing for, given freely, without paying a price for, maybe undeserved even) of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus.|`|RyhluHk3aa	When you were a sinner, before you had a new identity in Christ, everything you did was sin. But when you placed your faith in Christ, and gained a new identity through Him, you were given the gift of eternal life. You see, once you place your faith in Him, God no longer identifies you with your sins. You are now identified with Christ. You can never lose this gift.|`|98db094f444e5154c3fcacd3e51e23c2aa	It means that sin naturally leads one on the path of destruction. God doesn't send you there, you 'send' yourself there, or better still..... its the natural result of a life without Jesus. However God has given a free gift of eternal life to all those willing to place their trust in Jesus. By opening your heart up to the Lord and repenting from sin you can be saved. Of course this God thing doesn't really exist. So don't worry about it.<br>  The verses before it also explain it, <br>  Roms 6: 20 -23 "When you were slaves to sin, you were free from the control of righteousness. 21What benefit did you reap at that time from the things you are now ashamed of? Those things result in death! 22But now that you have been set free from sin and have become slaves to God, the benefit you reap leads to holiness, and the result is eternal life."<br>  <br>  Atheist.|`|ddea8dbfe02911fd00f96bb107edf2ffaa	For the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord. Go to v20. It speaks of people who do wrong all the time. Theirs is the life of the world. There are people that think about nothing but hate, greed, jealousy and this is just three of the hundreds of thing bad people do. The devil snares people to live without thinking about being good. And the bible ask what kind of advantage do anyone get from being bad. And even bad people sometimes feel ashame when they do wrong. There is nothing to feel ashame of when we trust God. There are many people who are completely done in by sin and are very dangerous indeed. These people will definitely feel the wrath of God that leads to death/total seperation from God. And you know what? is not even death but that is to easy because the real punishment is eternal damnation in the lake of fire and brimstone. Outside the body and inside the spiritual mind. Fortunately, for those drawn by the father who give their life to Jesus, free themselves from sin and become attach to God. Your old ways are pardon and you begin new start. The advantage of this is a personal satisfaction. Before I was a full blown sinner, dangerous to all of mankind but once I listen to that inner voice I found peace in myself and I began to walk and talk truth. I stop smoking(get cancer), drinking(liver damage), partying and fighting(got in trouble with the law), hating(coveting), and everything else I was doing wrong. V23 just says that if a person lives a life of sin/evil doing the wages of their  walk in life is death and as before is both physical and spiritual death. But if we accept the free gift of God grace which is in Christ Jesus then we have eternal life. In accepting Jesus as your personal savior for what He did on the cross, then you are save and you get that free gift of God. By this I mean having faith in Jesus, who left a comforter to show us the way, that when we believe in what we can't see those things we desire the most come alive and become abundant in our life. I mean work and play. That is why there are so many unbelievers in this world because they think this is a lie. Because as an example some have more faith in a magic show to its trickery to pay the price of a ticket of admission. But if anyone says to have faith in Jesus and trust that all the word of God has promise then what makes this less true. At least is free and a good choice. No drawbacks, drawdowns or penalties just acceptance to a God who loves people and want the best for them.|`|0OyKadRyaa	It means that any sinner (which is everyone) is deserving of death, and will receive the penalty of eternal death (the lake of fire) if they do not accept God's gift of eternal life through the belief in what the Lord Jesus did on the cross, when he paid our penalty of death. Hope that makes sense!<br>  <br>  God bless!!!|`|QF4W5aYRaa	At the beginning, God created man in His image, therefore, we were suppose to live forever. Then Eve just couldn't leave the fruit on the tree alone, so we now have man, sinning on earth. At that point, man began to die. As time went on, the ages of men started to decline. When God finally had enough of mans sinful nature, He told Noah to build the ark. At that time God said the age of man will be 120 years. Well, we still didn't learn. Romans 6:23 tells us that "The wages of sin are death". When you sin, you do give place to the devil. The only job he has on the earth is to "steal, kill, and destroy".Sounds like the road to immediate, or subsequent death to me. Next, "but the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord". When you accept Jesus Christ into your heart, and ask for forgiveness, and make Him your Lord and Savior, your sins are forgiven, and you now have eternal salvation, your going to heaven. Then, read and study The Word of God, fill yourself with it, and grow closer, and experience the close, personal, intimate "relationship" which you will find is everything!So much more, it's a constant expansion. The greatest story ever told!|`|YaB5bpv7aa	it means that  the wages of sin are death if u continue to sin and not except jesus into ur heart and life when you die then you dont go to be with jesus in heaven because you did not ecept him into ur life but if u do except jesus into ur heart and life and ask him to forgive u of all ur sins and you live for him u will have eternal life with him in heaven when u die|`|CueEJOVFaa	It means that sin entails death, but the Father has made it so that people who accept Jesus will receive eternal life.

ahFV9rfxaa	Well, the intelligent design argument doesn't have to be the God of the Bible, but it's been those who believe in Biblical creation who are promoting that idea.  Are there others?<br>  <br>  Many Christians like myself have no problem with a big bang, or God working in an evolutionary process. Day is used figuratively for a period of time in many scriptures, and the day/age theory of the creation believes there can be millions to billions of years between the days.<br>  <br>  The order for the creation parallels the same order science gives. First comes the heavens (stars, etc.), then an empty earth without form, then land followed by oceans, then plant life followed by the first intelligent life in the sea, then comes birds (which according to science are descendants of dinosaurs), then mammals, then a more specific wild animal, and finally man. It's actually amazing that it gives an order 3,000 plus years before science confirms that same order.<br>  <br>  Adam is not created until after the seventh day, and the day/age theory believes the man created on the sixth day is not the same as Adam who is first mentioned after the seventh day. That allows for cave men, and explains where Adam and Eve's children found wives, since there were people before them.<br>  <br>  As far as intellegent design, when some Christians latch onto a world that is 6,000 years old, the thought of "not intelligent" comes to my mind. They need to be convinced that science is not the enemy, that science actually corroborates the biblical order. Likewise, non-religionists need to explain how Genesis came up with the same order as science, considering how that might relate to intelligent design.|`|WX1b747Iaa	Let's review some of your 'proofs'.<br>  <br>  "Just in out solar system, the Earth is in a round orbit, instead of an elliptical orbit."<br>  <br>  Fail.

The earth has been hit by celestial bodies of all sizes throughout its 4.5 billion year old history.<br>  <br>  "If the sun was hotter, or the Earth was closer, there would not be water, If the sun was cooler, or the earth was farther, all the water would be ice."<br>  <br>  The earth was molten for a long time, and will be molten again when the sun expands millions of years from now. For most of the earth's 4.5 billion year history, we would have found it to be utterly uninhabitable.<br>  <br>  <br>  "If the moon was not there, the oceans would not have tides, so it would be stagnant."<br>  <br>  It wouldn't be stagnant, the cycles of evaporation and percipitation, cold and warm currents in the ocean would have existed just the same, and kept the oceans churning.<br>  <br>  "If the Earth turned to fast, the wind would strip the surface, if it turned to slow, one side would bake while the other side froze."<br>  <br>  That's exactly what happens with the moon, the same side faces the earth.

I don't know what this has to do with anything anyway.<br>  <br>  B)  Meteors hit the Earth all the time.  Some large ones have hit the planet before.  <br>  <br>  C)  The Earth could, in fact, be almost as near as Venus or almost as far out as Mars and still sustain life.  The habitable zone is actually pretty large.<br>  <br>  The other thing you fail to consider is that it only appears "built" for us because we are here.  We could just as easily have developed on another planet with similar characteristics and we would think THAT planet was built for us.<br>  <br>  There are estimated to be 70 sextillion (that's 70,000,000,000,000,000,000,000) stars in the known universe.  There may be 10, 20, 100, 1000 times that many in the part of the universe beyond what we can see (as the light from those stars has not yet reached us).  To think that this planet is the only one that could sustain life goes beyond reasonable probabilities.<br>  <br>  By the way, Dawkins was just throwing the "alien intelligent design hypothesis" out there as a possibility.  He doesn't believe that hypothesis any more than he believes that a deity created universe.  Dawkins will willingly admit that he cannot 100% rule out the possibility of a deity creating the universe, but he also can't rule out that fairies or the Flying Spaghetti Monster exist.|`|AA10558458	Actually, I held the same position as you before, so I understand what you mean.

That's uber-atheist Richard Dawkins, of "The God Delusion" fame.  How can that be?<br>  <br>  Dawkins has suggested that life was designed by aliens and planted on the earth.  He really says this in the excellent documentary Expelled: No Intelligence Allowed.  Check it out for yourself.<br>  <br>  Dawkins' willingness to credit aliens with life when faced with the overwhelming unlikelihood of the spontaneous generation of life from the primordial soup merely reveals that he's biased against God, and not ID.|`|2TcvDn0yaa	I will answer your question directly. After a court ruled it was unconstitutional to teach biblical creation is public schools, that's when ID was created. It was proven in a court of law that the first ID book, Of Pandas and People, was actually just a biblical creation book. 'God' was replaced with 'intelligent designer' and 'creationists' was replaced by 'intelligent design proponents'. So ID is, and always has been, a thinly disguised version of biblical creationism. Like biblical creationism, it's a fake science. There are no real laboratories, no real studies, and no real scientists working on ID. It's a political and religious tool in order to get creationism back into the school system. This was proved when the 'wedge document' leaked out from the Discovery Institute.|`|IBzbZc94aa	ID points either to Religion or God or to aliens that created us. But when pointed to the aliens, the questions comes to where they came from. Did a God create them or did they evolve. And if there is the possibility that the aliens evolved, then there is the possibility we evolved. That eliminates the ID theory...<br>  <br>  If there is no evolution, then it either points to God/religion or is an endless chain. Then comes the idea that God made the universe and let us evolve, but God still made something, so there is design in it.|`|bVHnNqzBaa	Evolution is a theory.<br>  <br>  No serious scholar studies intelligent design. You get crackpots writing about it, but there are no peer-reviewed journal articles that support the concept as anything closely resembling science.<br>  <br>  Intelligent Design is neither theory nor science. It is a belief system.<br>  <br>  ID is neither theory nor science because it suffers from lack of falsifiability. Did you see the recent Nova episode on the Tennessee court decision that found ID was simply religious instruction dressed in science clothing? The Establishment Clause of our Constitution prohibits recognition of any religion.|`|HEDSOHq1aa	look, if you believe in ID, then why blindly following that false prophet Issac Newton and believing some weird theory called gravity?<br>  <br>  how come all humans follow that gravity religion<br>  clearly, there is no physical proof for gravity and it's ONLY a theory, why are ppl decieved to believe in that stuff when god makse them fall to the ground?|`|QpF6Tjtiaa	evolution is already a proven fact, that is why it has a theory to explain it. Any theory detailing the diversity of life on earth must be a theory of evolution or it must be nonsense.<br>  <br>  if christians want to make up there own theory about evolution at least they would not be denying the fact of evolution, but don't expect this one to be taught in science class either.|`|fH204Oq2aa	By not naming a "designer" be it god, the flying spaghetti monster(Ramen!) or aliens it's not scientific.

vEEeq7kYaa	For many Jewish communities, the non Jewish neighbors were those directly responsible for their deaths and they often volunteered to aide the Nazis...willingly.<br>  I will give the example of two towns in Russia..of a great many..whose entire Jewish population was decimated by the Nazis.  However, these areas had been persecuting Jews horribly for decades BEFORE the Nazis arrived. If it were not for the pre-existing Jew hate across Europe, Hitler would NOT have been as successful at elminating more than half of Europe's Jews.  I  must begin with a bit of familly history and US history, too, that takes place before the Nazis. This is something I wrote for my own child ( with names removed) when he was younger.<br>  My father’s parents both emigrated from Russia. While they were married and already had 5 children living and had lost one in infancy, they did not come over to America at the same time together. They were very poor and could not afford the cost of tickets for the entire family. They wished to escape the persecution of Jews in Eastern Europe that was getting worse with the stirrings of the Bolshevik Revolution.<br>  In 1914, my Grandfather immigrated to the United States alone. He came ashore where thousands of other Russian immigrant Jews landed from the late 1880s until around 1920, at the southern Gulf port of Galveston, Texas. He had to raise enough money to secure passage for the wife and five young children he had left behind in Russia. <br>  <br>  During the six years that my Grandparents were separated by the continent of Europe , Atlantic Ocean and half the continent of North America, they each worked hard to survive and save enough money to unite them again in America. My Grandfather worked at many different jobs to save money and tried to send what he could back to the old country. My Grandmother had been left with an infant child who was still nursing and four other small mouths to feed. Besides caring for them, she worked as a wet-nurse and in a factory rolling cigarettes. The older children tried to bring home money working at odd jobs, too. <br>  <br>  Persecution of Jews was intense in those times and my own Grandmother as a young girl had witnessed her father, my Great-Grandfather Rabbi Matesyahu Yoshpe, beaten to death  at their home by a mob simply because he was a Rabbi.  They knew they had to leave for the safety of their children, even though they loved their land and felt a strong connection to it; for many hundreds of years generations of their ancestors had lived in villages in that part of Europe. It was a hilly and forested area that my grandmother told me resembled the part of Arkansas where I was born and still reside.  They loved the land and raised chickens and grew food on small plots of land.  They could not own the land as Jews were forbidden to own property, but they lived in a form of indentured servitude to the landowner and paid a percentage of produce.  Most generally had another trade as well.  My Grandfather was a cobbler by trade. He made boots and belts and the story goes, even sold some to the family of the last czar of Russia.<br>  <br>  Finally, in 1920, my Grandmother, two aunts, and three of my uncles boarded a ship named the Noordham and came to the United States.<br>  Emigration from many European countries was high and the passengers were usually listed on the ships manifest, or register, by their country of origin. This was not so with the Jewish immigrants from Europe. Instead of listing them as Russian, Polish, Lithuanian or Hungarian for instance, they were listed as Hebrew no matter where they had lived. My Grandmother and her children were listed as Hebrew even though their fellow non-Jewish passengers on the Noordham were listed as either Russian or Polish. They had special quotas, or limits, placed on how many Jews could come into the country. Other immigrants had quotas, but they were listed by country of origin and their religion or ethnic status was not listed on the ships manifest. The quotas began being strictly enforced in 1914 and the quota for Jews was dramatically reduced in 1924. This went on until after World War 2. Many Jews who later tried to flee Nazi Germany for the United States were turned away because of these quotas, and many of them were killed. You can still go view the many different passenger rosters on the Internet at the Ellis Island web site and read the photographed actual ship’s manifests. My Grandmother and her children all had their names changed through no fault of their own on the ships manifest, listing them with a last name of *****.  This is what they were registered with when they came to Ellis Island. They were reunited with my Grandfather after a long hard six years. <br>  <br>  The name given to my Grandfather by an immigration official was ******, a German name that sounded slightly similar to his name that would be better translated to the English as ****** He had established residency and a job with that name so the family simply ignored the Ellis Island given name and adopted the new name of ****** This is the name that my father, born in 1926 in Arizona and the youngest of three more children born to them in the United States was given, and it was my maiden name. So, I have a special connection to Ellis Island that millions of other Americans share with me, that of having a family name changed on arrival to the United States.<br>  <br>  It is a sobering realization that if my grandparents had not come to the United States they and the hundreds of descendents they produced would never have lived. You would not be reading this story now as I would not have been born. Most of their relatives and friends they left behind were killed in the years shortly after they left. I have discovered a very few distant relatives who survived; my Grandfather’s brother went to South Africa when quotas kept him out of the United States, and a small number went to Israel. <br>  <br>  The town of Telechan, where my Grandfather was born, was the site of a horrible Nazi massacre on August 4, 1941. The 2,000 remaining Jewish men, women and children were lined up in the center of town, forced to dig their own mass graves and shot. No Jew lives there to this day, and the only presence of their memory is a small plaque on the side of a building that states such a massacre occurred. It doesn’t even acknowledge that they were Jews. Telechan was one of many small villages populated primarily by Jews in an area of Eastern Europe known as “ The Pale”. Jews who had come up through migrations from southern Europe, the Alps and Northern Italy escaping the ghettos of Italy, and expulsions during the Middle Ages had settled there over a thousand years. Now many of those towns are simply gone. The town of Lahayshin, nearby where my Grandmother was born, suffered a similar such fate by having most of it’s Jews sent to Auschwitz where they were killed or were shot in the woods surrounding the village. The persecution of the Jewish people there did not start with the Nazis, but was a horrible escalation on an almost unimaginable scale of the Jew hate that had been festering for centuries. The Nazis simply exploited the anti-Semitism that had been rising across Europe.<br>  <br>  People still come to the United States to escape persecution and death. Some people come here for a greater opportunity for education or to earn a living, many come here for the freedom we have to worship in the manner we choose. The freedoms we have here in this country are not something we can ever take for granted. Each generation must work hard to ensure that this country remains a place on the earth where one may live and work for a better life in peace. <br>  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^...<br>  I found several stories of former citizens of Telechan who lost their relatives remaining there on that date, which was August 4, 1941. If you might be interested in learning more, here is a link that may interest you <br>  <a href="http://www.jewishgen.org/Yizkor/Telekhan..." rel="nofollow">http://www.jewishgen.org/Yizkor/Telekhan...</a><br>  The following is a brief but graphic excerpt from one of the remembrances at that site:<br>  There was no ghetto in Telekhany, no holding places, crematoria or special "children's aktsias." The date of our tragedy was August 4, 1941. The Nazi murderers herded the entire Jewish community – men, women, children of various parents, and the elderly, and told them to dig three long graves along the broad Glass Factory street. They ordered local gentiles (including those of surrounding villages who committed a pogrom against the Jews six weeks earlier) to shoot them. The ignorant gentiles, poisoned with hatred of Jews, shot them all – to the last Jew, the last child. Some didn't die and were set afire_____<br>  I discovered on studying at that site that around the time my Grandfather was born in Telechan there were twenty thousand Jews there. By the time the Nazis arrived..there were only about 2200. So, this shows the great numbers of Jews who had fled or were already victims of persecution BEFORE the Nazis arrived.<br>  Lastly, I'd like to include a quote or two from Elie Wiesel, a famous Holocaust survivor<br>  I swore never to be silent whenever and wherever human beings endure suffering and humiliation. We must always take sides. Neutrality helps the oppressor, never the victim. Silence encourages the tormentor, never the tormented.****I write to understand as much as to be understood.****Indifference, to me, is the epitome of evil. ****Our obligation is to give meaning to life and in doing so to overcome the passive, indifferent life. ****The opposite of love is not hate, it's indifference.****Just as despair can come to one only from other human beings, hope, too, can be given to one only by other human beings.****An immoral society betrays humanity because it betrays the basis for humanity, which is memory. An immoral society deals with memory as some politicians deal with politics. 'A moral society is committed to memory: I believe in me|`|8Nqq7tkwaa	many have already answered your question in great detail so i can add nothing to that except another question...<br>  <br>  are the people alive today collaborators of all the injustices happening around them in their own countries (and around the world)? i would say..yes if they do nothing. as was stated, to ignore injustices is to allow them to continue and you are responsible. if the goal is to learn from history, then this seems to be a lesson too many never learned.<br>  <br>  there are crimes against humanity occurring in usa and canada this very day, both within your borders and outside in your name. what are you doing about them? <br>  <br>  i know mama_pajama_1 understand this.<br>  <br>  good question.|`|kFpFU97zaa	Bystanders, who were too afraid to stand up because they themselves did not wish to be sent to concentration camps or shot for treason. Yes, in this way, they were collaborators, but if put into that situation, I'm sure a great many of us would keep our heads down just to keep our families alive (if not ourselves);<br>  <br>  It's often forgotten that non-Jews in Europe at that time also had it bad. My grandmother who lived in Frankfurt during that time, still recalls starving to the point that her father stole a neighbour's dog just so that the family could eat. I do not in any way condone anti-semitism, I'm saying yes, I acknowledge that what was done to them was monstrous, but everyone who was there suffered at that time, in one measure or another. The only people who were living well were open supporters and/or sycophants of Hitler.|`|DTog0VZWaa	Both.  Sadly many non-Jewish Germans where very active in turning in their Jewish neighbors, participated in Krystalnacht, even sent their children to SS Guard pre-training camps.<br>  <br>  For example, the Churchs make a big, big fuss about the murder program the Nazis had to kill all disabled people & as a result the program was reduced.  They also fussed & helped protect Christians who were classified as Jews by the Nazis.  HOWEVER, those same Churches did not speak up or fuss about the Jews being killed.  They voices had an  effect before & they didn't use them.<br>  <br>  For 10 years before the Holocaust laws more & more restrictive limited rights of Jews & persecuted them.  There was plenty of time to speak up.  Instead they supported Hitler as he moved into dictatorship.  Without collaboration of the people, it couldn't have happened  (The <a href="http://ushmm.org" rel="nofollow">http://ushmm.org</a> has more.)<br>  <br>  By contrast, there were righteous among the nations who risked their lives to save Jews.  Some Christians, some nothing in particular, some Jewish (who went -back- in).  The non-Jewish ones are honored at the Holocaust Museum in Israel, Yad Vashem in the forest of the righteous.<br>  <br>  =============<br>  In glancing through the answers, people like to believe Germans did nothing except stand by to avoid punishment.  Hardly.  Even the other day on the ushmm.org site I saw it reiterated that neighbors were turning in neighbors, which I'd learned long ago...not just from history books, but from my own family's knowledge.<br>  <br>  The final solution was officially kept secret, but in reality my family ran because they learned what was happening.<br>  <br>  Molly<br>  I hope you check the links.  There's a far cry from bad economics...to mass execution after torture & slave labor in horrendous conditions.<br>  <br>  It's only 60 years later, & so many are so unwilling to acknowledge what it was.  Even knowing it was non-Jews too, doesn't help people buck up & face what we humans are capable of.  It doesn't stop it in the future if you equate every  OTHER type of war or suffering to this particular kind with it's unique horror.  Never before were specific groups of people targeted systematically for mass extermination....and for NO political or other reason, just hate.<br>  <br>  ==============<br>  ADDITION:<br>  It's always been known that in Poland & other countries, those country's peoples went out in advance of the Nazis & mass murdered whole Jewish communities.  Survivors tell these stories like these over & over again.  As new records are released, even more of these events are coming to light.  Sadly, in those countries the people are often not taught this part of their own history - just in their own parent's generation.<br>  <br>  Kaithen<br>  We do need to speak up today.  However, these were crimes commited often by THEM & in not, then literally in front of their eyes on their sidewalks.  It was not some distant policy to speak up about.  It was neighbors calling SS guards to arrest their own former co-worker for being a Jew - so he could be executed on sight.  Ann Frank's family & those who hid them, were turned in by neighbors.|`|OugNf0x6aa	Standers. If they spoke out, they would be heavily punished.

We can't allow ourselves to be intimidated by those blinded by nationalism.  Patriotism is only appropriate when your nation acts in a humane manor.  Before evil becomes completely dominate is the time for people to speak up.  Adult Germans in 1935 are more responsible than German children in 1941.

fmFjdHNjaa	This is the advice I'm giving you because I don't think you really want to give up so early.<br>  <br>  1. <br>  A.Enrol in an adult education course, and finish your highschool education; or seek out other schools in the area who may consider.<br>  B.  If this does not work out, seek out a job, at least part-time ( guitar lessons)<br>  <br>  <br>  2. Apologize to your parents and convince them to let you come back home, for god sakes if they give a crap and you're showing an effort to finish school or at least get a  job, then they should help you out<br>  <br>  3. Your girlfriend probably got sick of you smoking pot all the time, so maybe you should consider at least cutting back, I mean you have no money, so that should be easy.<br>  <br>  4. Again, the reason behind the lack of ambition is probably the pot inhibiting you from wanting to do anything constructive.  Try your hand at other things see what might peak your interest.

65QqZBnjaa	"Why is everything that's identified as 'female' so artificial?"<br>  <br>  Because MEN say so.  Don't listen to them.  Maybe you could get something out of Julia Serano's book "Whipping Girl".  It's mainly about transsexual women, but don't let that stop you.  This book talks about this subject quite a bit.

digPrN5Saa	Peace<br>  <br>  The Islamic and Christian views of Jesus: a comparison<br>  <br>  The person of Jesus or Isa in Arabic (peace be upon him) is of great significance in both Islam and Christianity. However, there are differences in terms of beliefs about the nature and life occurrences of this noble Messenger.<br>  <br>  Source of information about Jesus in Islam<br>  <br>  Most of the Islamic information about Jesus is actually found in the Quran.<br>  <br>  The Quran was revealed by God to Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings be upon him), and memorized and written down in his lifetime. Today, anyone who calls him or herself a Muslim believes in the complete authenticity of the Quran as the original revealed guidance from God.<br>  <br>  Source of information about Jesus in Christianity<br>  <br>  Christians take their information about Jesus from the Bible, which includes the Old and New Testaments.<br>  <br>  These contain four biblical narratives covering the life and death of Jesus. They have been written, according to tradition, respectively by Matthew, Mark, Luke and John. They are placed at the beginning of the New Testament and comprise close to half of it.<br>  <br>  Encyclopedia Britannica notes that none of the sources of his life and work can be traced to Jesus himself; he did not leave a single known written word. Also, there are no contemporary accounts written of his life and death. What can be established about the historical Jesus depends almost without exception on Christian traditions, especially on the material used in the composition of the Gospels of Mark, Matthew, and Luke, which reflect the outlook of the later church and its faith in Jesus.<br>  <br>  Below are the views of Islam and Christianity based on primary source texts and core beliefs.<br>  <br>  ISLAM<br>  <br>  1. Do Muslims believe he was a Messenger of One God? YES<br>  <br>  Belief in all of the Prophets and Messengers of God is a fundamental article of faith in Islam. Thus, believing in Prophets Adam, Jesus, Moses, and Muhammad (peace and blessings be upon them) is a requirement for anyone who calls him or herself a Muslim. A person claiming to be a Muslim who, for instance, denies the Messengership of Jesus, is not considered a Muslim.<br>  <br>  The Quran says in reference to the status of Jesus as a Messenger:<br>  <br>  "The Messiah (Jesus), son of Mary, was no more than a Messenger before whom many Messengers have passed away; and his mother adhered wholly to truthfulness, and they both ate food (as other mortals do). See how We make Our signs clear to them; and see where they are turning away!" (Quran 5:75).<br>  <br>  2. Do Muslims believe he was born of a Virgin Mother? YES<br>  <br>  Like Christians, Muslims believe Mary, Maria in Spanish, or Maryam as she is called in Arabic, was a chaste, virgin woman, who miraculously gave birth to Jesus.<br>  <br>  "Relate in the Book the story of Mary, when she withdrew from her family, to a place in the East. She screened herself from them; then We sent to her Our spirit (angel Gabriel) and he appeared before her as a man in all respects. She said: I seek refuge from you in God Most Gracious (come not near) if you do fear God. He said: Nay, I am only a Messenger from your Lord, to announce to you the gift of a pure son. She said: How shall I have a son, when no man has ever touched me, and I am not unchaste? He said: So it will be, your Lord says: ‘That is easy for Me; and We wish to appoint him as a sign unto men and a Mercy from Us': It was a matter so decreed" (Quran 19:16-21).<br>  <br>  3. Do Muslims believe Jesus had a miraculous birth? YES<br>  <br>  The Quran says:<br>  <br>  "She (Mary) said: ‘O my Lord! How shall I have a son when no man has touched me.' He (God) said: ‘So (it will be) for God creates what He wills. When He has decreed something, He says to it only: ‘Be!'- and it is" (3:47).<br>  <br>  It should also be noted about his birth that:<br>  <br>  "Verily, the likeness of Jesus in God's Sight is the likeness of Adam. He (God) created him from dust, then (He) said to him: ‘Be!'-and he was" (Quran 3:59).<br>  <br>  4. Do Muslims believe Jesus spoke in the cradle? YES<br>  <br>  "Then she (Mary) pointed to him. They said: ‘How can we talk to one who is a child in the cradle?' He (Jesus) said: ‘Verily! I am a slave of God, He has given me the Scripture and made me a Prophet; " (19:29-30).<br>  <br>  5. Do Muslims believe he performed miracles? YES<br>  <br>  Muslims, like Christians believe Jesus performed miracles. But these were performed by the will and permission of God, Who has power and control over all things.<br>  <br>  "Then will God say: ‘O Jesus the son of Mary! recount My favor to you and to your mother. Behold! I strengthened you with the Holy Spirit (the angel Gabriel) so that you did speak to the people in childhood and in maturity. Behold! I taught you the Book and Wisdom, the Law and the Gospel. And behold: you make out of clay, as it were, the figure of a bird, by My leave, and you breathe into it, and it becomes a bird by My leave, and you heal those born blind, and the lepers by My leave. And behold! you bring forth the dead by My leave. And behold! I|`|hiKtjrWNaa	in Islam Jesus is (Eissa) ????<br>  he is a profit just like Moses ad Muhammad.. he was sent to Jews to make them return to God and God only..<br>  he is not son of God in Islam, he is just human, and he didn't die on the christ, God left him in heaven and the one who died on the christ is someone looked like him<br>  "??? ????? ??? ????? ? ??? ??? ???:<br>  a verse in Holy Quraan says: they "the jews" didnt kill him, and didn't christ him,but the one they killed they thought that was him "because he looked like him"..<br>  <br>  God will send him back to earth to guide people again to God and he will break the christ and he will be a Muslim and pray with all Muslims the way they pray, after that it will be Judgment day..|`|zKFSCCWOaa	Jesus (peace be upon him) was one of God's Prophets, born of the Virgin Mary who will return in the Last Days to clear up our disputes. We don't believe that Jesus (pbuh) was God or His son because that is idolatry. The most important thing in Islam is that there is only ONE God. All the Prophets from Adam to Abraham to Moses to Jesus (peace be upon them all) were all sent with the same message: to serve no one but God and that there is only One God. But of course messages become corrupted over time as was the case of the Christians taking Jesus (pbuh) as God. Maybe because they couldn't completely oppose Paganism at the time.|`|kFpFU97zaa	He's right. They acknowledge Jesus, but not as the Son of God. He's considered a prophet.|`|FEAua3dxaa	Yes, Jesus (pbuh) is considered to be a prophet like Moses, etc...  There are many verses in the Bible where Jesus appears to be denying being God such as in Mark 12:29:  "Why do you call me good?" Jesus answered. "No one is good–except God alone."  Muslims also believe that the Bible has been changed (which is true).  In the Bible, there are footnotes about certain verses that were not in the original manuscripts and was added later.  For example: in Matthew 28:19, it says: "Go therefore and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit."  That verse was added later and was not in the original manuscripts.  There are other things that you have to think about to make you question about whether Jesus was God or not.  If he was God, why would he need to pray?  Is he praying to himself?  That was one of the many things that didn't make sense to me when I was a Christian.  And the explanation that he was leading by example is illogical.|`|nPt7hUE8aa	By that definition of a prophet, i could be one too.  Jesus never claimed to be god though.

Source(s) edit<br>  <br>  accepting Jesus as the Son of God is not idolatory.....worshiping idols is idolatory....<br>  <br>  however the other definition of idolatory could be attributed to a faith that is not Christian....one where people threaten death to those who they consider offends it<br>  <br>  idolatry definition<br>  <br>  idola·try (ī d?l′? trē) <br>  <br>  noun pl. -·tries<br>  <br>  worship of idols<br>  excessive devotion to or reverence for some person or thing<br>  <br>  sound familiar?|`|NCRfZRopaa	I believe that person is correct.

But his race was not a issue, so no mention of it is made in the histories of his reign.  He was the Pope who decided to celebrate "Easter" (then called Paschal) on Sunday rather on the date of the Jewish Passover which changes "day of the week" each year.<br>  <br>  Pope Miltiades (311-314) was the pope at the time of Constantin's vision and his conversion to Christianity.  He constructed the original Basilica of St. John Lateran.  Again, whether he was "black" was not listed in the histories, only that he was born in Africa.<br>  <br>  Pope Gelasius I (492-496) was born in Rome, but of African descend.  It is stated that his ancestry was evident by his skin color.  This would seem to indicate that he was "black".|`|d05b366085d8773ec7654e3ad2b991cdaa	How and how could black Catholics be bigoted against a black pope?<br>  <br>  Your "WE" was killing half-black people not too many years ago.

7OWLwoGhaa	The bible does not mention anything about homosexuality as being "impure".  God created this world and all of its inhabitants of which at least approx 10% of his human creations are meant to be either gay, lesbian, bisexual, or transgender (Kinsey Report).  God created his gay children so that is His will - those against homosexuality are struggling against God's will.  Homosexuals are appearing on Earth in larger numbers and that IS a real situation.. Heterosexuals struggling with what IS.. are denying reality because they simply cannot believe that homosexuality can ever be a good thing.  Unfortunately none of the major world religions provide protocol/guidelines on how homosexuals are to live either.. so it feels like that God did not provide that and hence the problem.. we are left to figure it out ourselves and the rest of society struggles while we do that.  <br>  <br>  Promiscuity, be gay or straight, is the only thing I know about that God punishes.  But when there is true, genuine intimate love between two people, gay or straight, how can that ever be a sin? Not possible.. Love is God.|`|QohpI9Kqaa	the older generation took away things they didn't like like homosexuality. to me gay, straight, black, white god loves us. as long as were good people well have a peaceful afterlife. that what i believe in, you can believe in god in any way you want|`|DYmmUSt1aa	I think back when the bible was written, homosexuality was more of a wham bam thank you man kinda thing<br>  it wasn't about love or even any sort of relationship, just sex.<br>  that's why i think its a sin.|`|sy5CgfjDaa	Dont worry<br>  everything's a sin according to the Bible<br>  It's just a reflection of the times.

So is talking back to your parents. So is being blind or physically impaired and talking to god.<br>  <br>  That's all mentioned in Leviticus.<br>  <br>  That's what I'm going to say.<br>  <br>  If gays ought to be stoned to death, so should people who eat selfish, talk to their parents, etc.<br>  <br>  Gays aren't sinners. Everyones a sinner. Being gay isn't a sin, it's impure. God intended for girls to be with guys but the whole point of the earth is to love.<br>  <br>  Love love and lvoe. That's waht god wants.<br>  <br>  Not hate and homophobia.|`|z2xRXM5Laa	Christianity teaches that god is love. The bible seems to be against the sexual acts of homosexuality, but these days, homosexuals have loving relationships that go far beyond just sex.  Gay people love as deeply and with commitment that is just as meaningful as heterosexuals experience.  God loves everyone as his own children and god wants us ALL to love each other without judgment - even our own enemies.   Yet somehow, many bible-beaters forget that or fail to see this!  I hate it when I see so-called christians telling gay people that they want to kill us, we are going to hell and they would turn their backs on a friend who was gay...People like that aren't real christians in my opinion.  They are just haters twisting the word of god and they are the ones who will feel the heat in the dreadful seat of judgment one day.<br>  Sin is a point of view. If they want to say that homosexuality will send you to hell, then so will overeating or having tattoos!|`|1ce0748c0ab23dcbbd0d889d57183122aa	There are too many questions like this, I really wish that people would stop asking and look in resolved questions. <br>  <br>  All in all, god loves everyone, the bible was written 2000 years ago in a patriarchal homophobic society.

1ypdlPWRaa	i had all my teeth removed in one session when i was in my early 30's due to illness under general anesthetic, spent one night in hospital and was home the next day.  i didn't have dentures put in immediately i waited til my gums had healed and then went for fittings.  i would say i went for 3-4 weeks without teeth.  i took the time off work and stayed home.  family and friends were supportive and happy to help out with shopping and errands for me.  <br>  i have to say i have never ever had a problem with my dentures. i have never had to use any of the advertised denture adhesives of any kind - if your dentures feel loose you simply have them relined by your denturist/dentist/dental mechanic. <br>  i haven't missed my own teeth either - my dentures are very natural looking and have served me well.  i recently had to get new dentures and they fit as good as the old ones - no worries - the odd time you will get a burr on your new plate you tell the dentist and he smooths it out and you're good to go!<br>  i'd do it again in a heartbeat!  hubby feels the same way about his dentures!  <br>  good luck with it - you will do fine and you'll be smiling again in no time!  cheers!|`|4fHLDG6Vaa	Yeah! Got mine all pulled a year and a half ago. Dentures the same day.Only had novocaine when getting them pulled, wasn't bad as I thought it would be. Only took one vicadin and over the counter tylenol the whole time.The most painful part was after about a week when the denture rubbed on my gums (like a shoe on a blister with no sock! Yikes)! I had trouble a bit with getting the adhesive figured out but after a few months they were refitted and now stay in good without adhesive. The bottoms are a little trickier because of the tongue. It's kind of a suction thing that holds them in and there is less area to stick to on the bottom. Be careful with adhesives as the first time I glued them in they started aching and I could not get them out. They aren't the same as teeth so if you chew your fingernails...you won't any more!!!! Yeah!  Also, occasionally I get little babylike teeth that grow (wierd) but I scrape them out with my fingernail. Your denturist can do it for you. After years of toothaches, broken teeth and hot/cold sensitivity it is heaven! Not one day since I got them pulled has my mouth hurt like it used to. There are some cons but I'd do it again in a minute. Have lots of soft foods around for a couple of weeks. Mac and cheese, yogurt, soups etc. I think I had ribs within 10 days (cut up tho) and I still miss chewing a steak bone! Good luck! Bet you have hurt a lot worse for a lot less!|`|XEbrGfZuaa	I have six remaining on the bottom to pull. Then I can get a lower<br>  denture. And I dread all of those going at one time. Plus the time for<br>  healing and being able to adapt to a lower set.<br>     I knew a young girl where we used to live, that had all of hers pulled<br>  at once, and they put her false teeth in the same day. Her face was<br>  swollen, along with the gums. It took her about two weeks to see the<br>  swelling down, and she was beginning to chew soft foods. She wasn't<br>  a complainer, other than the first day I saw her. She sounded like<br>  her mouth was glued shut. And hardly opened her mouth. And she<br>  was smoking of all things. That's something you're not supposed to<br>  do just having your teeth pulled. And she knew it also. But it didn't<br>  affect her from what she said. I would get tea bags on hand, to put<br>  wet on the areas to help with the healing and bleeding. I've used them<br>  in the past, and I know they do help. Much more than just gauze<br>  packs. I'm sure you'll have better luck with them.|`|8e7a94a0af2d078a41f902e73bf91f17aa	My understanding is that the best thing to do is at the extraction, make it clear you don't want dentures until you heal; that the healing takes a good two weeks or more, and then to be fitted.  Reason:  because being fitted immediately causes the dentures to need readjustment as your healing progresses.|`|18qLaKnsaa	I also need to get my teeth out...like jaxson I have a family history of bad teeth..If you have a good dentist it will be fine..you will probably alot happier after it's done..I myself need to find a dentist that will take payments and hopefully I can get my teeth done also..good luck to you and lots of smiles..take care|`|0rpN2419aa	I had all the uppers removed at once, under twilight sedation and I woke up with a new set of teeth.  The only bad thing I can say about imediate dentures is that there is so much swelling and when you remove them to clean them, they are very difficult and quite painful to get over the swollen gums, then over time, your gums recede quickly and the dentures have to be refitted.  If you don't mind going without teeth for a few weeks, I would reccomend letting your gums heal before putting in new dentures.  I think they heal faster without the dentures in, my healing took over a month, but I have Addison's disease and don't heal quickly.|`|kvWF1a2Yaa	Well the way they do it now is that when you get your teeth pulled the dentures go in right away. BECAUSE it is possible they wouldnt fit if there is swelling. <br>  <br>  I myself am a 29 year old male with dentures. My family has a history of bad teeth. And of course I caught the trait. Anyway, 2 weeks ago I had my top teeth pulled out and I couldnt be happier! I havent smiled this wide in 10 years.!!!!<br>  <br>  It takes some time to heal but very worth it in the end<br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|ozwLZwXeaa	If you have the right dentist, you won't feel a thing after the first six shots in your mouth. I didn't even know they had them all out when he said he was done. I didn't have mine put right in that day, I have heard stories both ways, good to have them right in and to wait for the healing to put them in.  I waited and let  my gums heal and now after watching my one daughter-in-law get all of hers pulled and her plates put right in that same day, I wish I had tried that. She looks wonderful and her teeth are great and so natural. If you hadn't known she had the bad teeth no one would know she had the false ones.|`|bf4cc388616ba9cb48357f54373c609eaa	No, but my Dad did and they pulled all of them and he got his dentures the same day so his gumms would heal and assume the shape of his new dentures. Dad always looked on the bright side and said he likes to be able to take his teeth out and brush them while he ran water on them in the bathroom sink. After he got used to them he adopted the old trick that his mother had of shoving them out of his mouth and holding them with his lips to scare the little kids. My Granny used to do that and I had bad dreams at night about it. Growing up is hard to do.........Granny had her problems with it too. I still love her.|`|xL6zc0bOaa	I had to get all my teeth out at 18, right after my first baby took all the calcium I had.<br>  I like my falsies, better than my own teeth, I could eat anything with them, toffee apples you name it I could eat it. <br>  <br>  Before I got them whipped out, I couldn't eat very much without getting the toothache, Ice cream had me in agony.<br>  I tell you the truth, getting my teeth out was one of the best things I ever done.<br>  <br>  .|`|AA11296212	No, I still have my own choppers.  But my dentist used to be a lawyer...he will pull the tooth, the whole tooth and nothing but the tooth.
stAeoUeSaa	Winter solstice- December 21, 2012 - is just the revealing of the 'antichrist' or the 'man of perdition' at the mid-point of what Christians call the 7 year Tribulation (just subtract 1260 days to get the start and add 1260 days to get the end). Satanists and many pagan cultures from every corner of the world all throughout history have celebrated this like the Sumerians, Babylonians, Cherokee, Hopi, Chinese I-Ching (confirmed by Terence McKenna), Mayans (Pacal Votan; Chilam Balam of Tizimin, Mani, Chumayel; Jaguar Prophet), Egyptians, Celts, etc. This evil event is called "the abomination that causes desolation" that will be set up in the Jewish Temple's Holy of Holies when the antichrist is imbued with the spirit of satan himself. When will Jesus come? Only God Himself knows exactly, but very soon in "the twinkling of an eye" and like "a thief in the night".

VLxU5112aa	We draw the line where we draw the "rights" line.  The actions that we debate as "rights" someone can have (or probably shouldn't) are actions that should not be imposed on others: religion, free speech, abortion, etc.  When the action passes "rights" and moves to more serious topics that actually affect people's well-being, then it is often necessary to impose ideas on others.|`|hWvvrEphaa	I never impose my beliefs on anyone.

As a christian it makes me sad to see so many people claiming to be Christians acting like fools. <br>  <br>  So no, I don't think its fair to impose your beliefs on anyone.

You are at odds with yourself over the sanctity of life. Killing is okay as long as it is done by the government? God bless.<br>  <br>  If you are against the death penalty except in extreme cases of danger to society, what do you mean when you say Casey should fry? Also, you do know she has not yet been convicted in a court of law, right?|`|PS6Pjtndaa	Atheists are the most confused people on the planet!  They have NO PROBLEM with courts convicting people for perjury or murder.  These are MORAL crimes!  No one says, "Don't charge the murderer with murder!  Don't cram your religion down other people's throats!"  But ... they hand pick "certain" sins (like abortion and homosexuality) and suddenly it's all about Christianity IMPOSING our beliefs on others.  LOL!<br>  <br>  Is there ANYONE who believes that our society is BETTER for abortion and homosexuality?  AT BEST, the arguments are that it's none of our business, yada yada yada.  Laws are designed to keep people in check!  I mean, abortion is legal, but I would never ask my wife or girlfriend to have one.  This law isn't for me!  Neither is the law prohibiting murder!  You make murder legal tomorrow and I won't be murdering people!  Such laws are FOR pagans, to keep them in line.  These are the people who don't want rules of any kind!<br>  <br>  Examples:<br>  <br>  1. No need for marriage<br>  2. No fault divorce<br>  3. Gay rights<br>  4. Abortion<br>  5. They have a "right" to work.  Think about this one!  Employers don't have a right to hire who they choose.  The pagans have a RIGHT to work.  LOL!<br>  <br>  You can add to this list their wish list of ...<br>  <br>  6. Legalized drugs<br>  7. Legalized pedophilia<br>  8. No age of consent/no statutory rape<br>  9. Legalized prostititution<br>  <br>  The list goes on for miles!  OF COURSE they say that we "shouldn't" impose our will on them.  They are petulent children who don't want any rules.  Look at the wonderful society we have today because they've gotten their way so far!<br>  <br>  Consider these two facts:<br>  <br>  1. Guns are harder to get and legally possess today than ever in America's history<br>  <br>  2. God has been all but driven our of our schools<br>  <br>  Now ... IF guns are harder to get and legally possess then one MIGHT think that school house shootings are lower (per capita) than say 40 or 50 years ago.  But you know the answer, don't you!<br>  <br>  The pagans must be stopped!  We do so by imposing our beliefs on them!  Christianity comes straight out of God's word!  These rules aren't just for us!  We as a people will be better off with EVERYONE obeying God's word!<br>  <br>  Or we have chaos and anarchy!<br>  <br>  Lord bless.|`|Sn0CViR7aa	Obviously it is important to impose justice on those who take innocent life.   The case of Casey Anthony is instructive in this regard.  A mother does not hold life or death power over her child, whether that child lives inside or outside the womb.<br>  <br>  In other matters, we cannot impose our beliefs on others.  For example, we cannot force anyone to honor God by Christian worship because that would violate their freedom.  Following God's example, we ordinarily have to allow people to make their own mistakes, as long as they do not harm or endanger others.<br>  <br>  There is a middle case that the people of this world often raise against Christians:  They say that we cannot make laws by normal democratic procedures if we are motivated by Christian values.  This edict is not consistent with American traditions, and it denies Christians the rights that the people of this world extend to themselves.  In short, it is bigoted.<br>  <br>  When Christians vote to allow a display of the Ten Commandments, or to give a place to the teaching of intelligent design, or to restrict abortion, or to affirm actual marriage over the counterfeit of homosexual relationships, we take responsibility as Christian citizens.  No Christian need apologize for doing what is wise and just.<br>  <br>  Cheers,<br>  Bruce|`|1fyZTtnVaa	To play devils advocate further...<br>  <br>  The argument could be made that it is common law not to kill anyone, but not everyone agrees with this law. Some people want to kill but the law prohibits them from doing so (whether or not the law actually stops them is not in question here). So think about it, are we, the majority of people who feel that it is not right to kill forcing our beliefs on those who do want to kill?<br>  <br>  The answer is yes.<br>  <br>  In this statement, I am not saying that abortion is murder, I have no opinion on the issue.|`|BJfBXKAiaa	I would say that a line needs to be drawn at the point where we physically or emotionally inflict pain on another human being. A fetus, at least in my opinion, can't be considered anything other than a ball of cells until it attains viability.|`|2LOa12xEaa	Depends on the situation.<br>  <br>  If someone think's its ok to murder a human, then I would impose my beliefs on them, which is that they should not be allowed to do that.|`|FxjC72QVaa	I don't think you should impose it on them. then they feel like its forced and resist it.

I feel that a woman has the right to do what she wants with her body.  That includes abortion.  Once the child is born then the child is an individual and has rights. That is where I draw the line.  An unborn child to a born child.

Then we would be able to reason our way to a solution.  Morality, after all, is built on truth, right?  It is either true or false that abortion (your example) is immoral.

Now, who was it that talked about that "will to power"?....<br>  <br>  peace|`|lDEGaK7Laa	No one should be telling a woman what she can and cannot do with her body. Period. Killing a child is in no way analogous to abortion, and it's simply and perversely obtuse to suggest that it is.<br>  <br>  Abortion is a right that women must have.<br>  <br>  EDIT: Ma'am, it's disturbing that you see no difference. You have absolutely no right to tell anybody what to do with their body, morally, legally, or otherwise. Only a woman herself should make the choice of what happens to her body. Zygotes, embryos, and fetuses aren't children; they may end up as children, but whether they do or not is not your decision to make; it's the mother's and the mother's alone.<br>  <br>  Here's the line: People should be free to do as they please so long as they don't harm other people or infringe on other people's rights. That means no murder. And it means abortion is legal, as the fetus is not an individual with rights.<br>  <br>  EDIT 2: And this is exactly how I feel. I'm not "blase" about it; I believe to the core of my being that nobody should make personal decisions for other people. It's just blatantly wrong.|`|luwBPdE8aa	I don't "impose" my beliefs on others, but if I have the chance, I will try to explain by the Bible why I believe the way I do.<br>  I do think that in a civilized society, the majority of the people have the right to determine what actions shall be deemed intolerable, and to make laws against those actions.|`|70OClBEQaa	No its wrong but over all its annoying i dont like shoving sh*t down people's throat therefore i would be greateful if people could  stop trying to feed me sh*t i dont like it let me be i let you be so let me be let me live MY life just like i let u live urs i think we should respect one another i dont think Atheist have the right to be telling people that their religion is wrong thats not the way to go i think people should accept one another but for that to work Christians have to stop telling Atheist they will go to hell and all the none sense|`|qbelhflAaa	Depends on the situation.<br>  <br>  Also, there's a rather large difference between a fetus and a child.|`|nXxtBkguaa	What I tell pro-choicers when they try that arguement on me is that making rape illegal is imposing my beliefs on others.

I myself am lower middle class, but went to a really poor school where even I as lower middle class was one better off kids in terms of money, and there really weren't too many kids who were in subcultures.  I graduated in 2006, so emo and scene were just starting back then so there weren't too many at my school anyway, but as far as like goth and other like subcultural types, there weren't too many at my school and actually groups were more split by race than cliques.  But I did go for half a day to a central school in the district where they offered classes the normal high schools didn't and the kids who went to schools with more money seemed to be the ones who latched on to subcultures. There were definitely more goth types there than at my regular high school.|`|FdAfFON1aa	Well I come from a "posh & well off" family (or so I'm told) and I'm a romantic goth.

But my neighbour is a scene, and a few people from my neck of the woods are emo. Romantic goths are described as 'posh goth' sometimes, but I am a gothic lolita aswell.<br>  <br>  To be honest I don't think that anyone has anything to be "emo" about.

r1Vg6djRaa	religion is just a distortion from reality|`|WDVa1R0xaa	Religion is all about faith. There is no scientific proof that any religion is "real." It is a man-made concept, and with all man-made objects, it has flaws. The Bible was written by humans, who were "inspired" by God.<br>  <br>  I dont know alot about other religions, but I am Catholic, and Jesus was believed to be the Son of God who died for our sins, and then rose from the dead.<br>  <br>  You can either believe this or not believe this. All religions have exaggerated beliefs and views, and none of them can be proven. So in then end it is all a matter of faith.|`|GQbH0whQaa	i guess they just watch over us. Who knows really, we dont.

You are not alone in this frustration but it is a sign that is good and one that is sad.  Let me explain.  If my image of God is love and good, then I want to see the results of love and  good.  Well, God, the living God is love and good.  Jesus and God are one and the same, different reflections of the same.  However, Allah was human, and is dead.  A dead person cannot change events.  So let's deal with why God (which includes Jesus but I will only reference them as God).<br>  God is capable of doing all those things you wish he had intervened.  However, due to a very important factor he gave each of us,  he has to apply self-imposed limitations upon himself.  That factor is free will of man.  You have a choice, he cannot or will not ever force you to do something--it is always your choice.  That applies to ever man living today or yesterday or tomorrow.  Where did it start---God, and Jesus before the foundation of the earth/universe or anything living planned this world of ours.  You probably know the story of creation, but the important thing, he created where nothing existed, that is the definition of faith.  He spoke and something happened, he spoke again and another thing happened and so forth.  By his word all things exist.  When he made man and women on the sixth day, he place them in  a garden (Garden of Eden) gave them control over all the known world.  He told them not to eat of one particular tree, but all the rest was theirs to have.  Exercising their free will, and listening to Satan or the devil, Eve ate of the fruit of the forbidden tree, so Adam ate of that same tree----Sin or disobedience was born or introduced by the free will of man.  God kicked them out of the garden.<br>  Zooming ahead---During the next 4000 years, God worked a plan to give man a path back to his good graces.  He could not force them because of the free will, they have to choose to return to his grace.  That period ended when Jesus  as the Son, died on the cross for the sins of all men of all times.  What did that do?  Jesus was sinless, you and I are sinners, as sinners we cannot come into the presence of God for he is righteous.  If we accept the gift of Jesus for his payment for our sins, we then can use his righteousness to be with God.  This is all a spiritual thing, not flesh or physical.<br>  <br>  Okay, when Jesus died on the cross, he finished the plan he and God had prior to the foundations of the world/universe.  God loves us, Jesus loves us and both want the best for us.  However, we as saved sinners or still lost sinners have a free will and still we are the one's who make the mistakes you are concerned about.  All the greed is man's love of money over his love of God.  Katrina, Rita, Tsunami, or any of the major disasters of our world are due to our world operating under conditions of nature.  A kernel of corn planted germinates will always be a corn plant--a law of nature.  A child running out in front of a moving car will nearly always be hurt--law of nature.  Who is to blame, the driver????no, it is the parent who made the wrong choice, the child who made the wrong choice.  Even with the tremendous loss of life in the natural disasters they are not God caused--the law of nature is working.<br>  Let me suggest a thought----If all the world suddenly became saved Christians, do you think natural disasters would cease?  No, it will not happen.  If you took all the greed out of the world, would life for the people as they are today, (not as the all saved Christians) would their lives be better?  In many cases they would be, at least there would not be victims of greed, which is profit at the cost to others in a harmful way.  Profit is not bad, but if it adversely hurts others, it is bad.<br>  <br>  Free will, an individual chooses good or evil in all situations of their life.  To marry or not, to marry a certain person or not, to sin or not.  Every decision, good or bad, either rewards us or cost us, there is no free rides.  A saved Christian has God to consult, he makes his decision and it is the wrong one for him---God refuses to stop him, for if he did, God would cease being God.  You cannot on one hand give someone you love a free will and on the other hand take that will away.  If God does anything, it is always truth.  If he breaks truth, he is no longer God.<br>  One other thing,  If I have the faith of a mustard seed Jesus said I can move a mountain---but all that power comes from my faith in Jesus and what He said.  To have that level of faith, a Christian must work really hard to develop it, gaining proof of its truth each time he exercises faith and it works.  If I had that level of faith asuku t, I could have told the hurricane Katrina to stop in the Gulf of Mexico and die, rather than for it to destroy my home on the coast of Mississippi and the homes|`|5dd8eBDYaa	Rolled over and smoked a cigarette.|`|AA11124121	OH..the whining about human life lost never ends..<br>  <br>  Therefore, I absolutely agree with atheists and others who say that many atrocious things have been done in the name of God, and even in the name of Christianity. <br>  <br>  However, these atrocities were not perpetrated by God, but by evil human beings. <br>  <br>  If we look at the history of democide (which includes genocide, politicide, and mass murder, but not war-dead) prior to the 20th century, we find that millions of people were killed by people groups who wanted the other people groups eliminated. Note that these numbers do not include those killed through wars.<br>  <br>  Yes, "Christians" have committed atrocities against other religious and non-religious people. However, atheists have committed far more atrocities than all religious groups combined. <br>  <br>  Even so, the key factor in these atrocities has been totalitarian power, rather than religion, which has resulted in these hundreds of millions of murders. <br>  <br>  The Bible says that people are evil, but that they can become transformed through the power of the Holy Spirit to live lives of love, joy and peace.|`|zKFSCCWOaa	If there is no God in the end then i am completely happy with the way i've spent my life.

I don;t know where this "omni" nonsense came from, but it's time to educate again..for the 138th time.<br>  <br>  The topic of omnipotence (the ability of God to do anything, i.e., <br>  <br>  God is all-powerful) is frequently cited by atheists as proof that the God of the Bible cannot exist. <br>  <br>  The claim has been made that if there is anything that God cannot do, then God cannot be omnipotent and, therefore, does not exist.<br>  <br>  The atheist distorts the biblical definition of omnipotence in order to "prove" that God cannot exist. <br>  <br>  Contrary to their claims, omnipotence does not include the ability to do things that are, by definition, impossible. Neither does omnipotence include the ability to fail. <br>  <br>  By defining omnipotence as requiring one to have the ability to fail, atheists have defined omnipotence as being impossible. Of course, an omnipotent God would never fail.<br>  <br>  These kinds of arguments are clearly illogical and even silly, although they are commonly used by inexperienced atheists. Most intelligent atheists have dropped these kinds of arguments long ago.<br>  <br>  Now..go get educated then return with something challenging for me.|`|AA10007956	Hi there,<br>  <br>  First of all, <br>  We have to separate logic from superstition and assumption.<br>  We humans would like to brand our name into everything, and even onto God.<br>  I myself have asked the same questions. If a God can be "all powerful" and "all knowing" and "all loving" and "all merciful", how can he create us, know and will what we're going to do and then condemn us to hell/promote us to heaven?!<br>  <br>  Lets now separate logic from human ideology.<br>  I believe that God wills everything. Yes, I do. He can choose to if He so wants to. I can't say that it is true - I don't speak for God. I merely answer you what I believe God works, how my human mind can comprehend all of what He does.<br>  <br>  I also believe that it is a contradiction to say He wills everything but yet we have a "choice". How do we have a "choice" if its His will? Then its not a choice anymore, isn't it? Its been written!<br>  <br>  Well, my explanation is that I believe God allows us to truly make choices, but He has willed our destinies. We have several destinies based on the choices we make. Something like a spider web. Each rung, each thread signifies the "milestone" we have arrived at from the choices we have made, thus bringing us closer and closer to one of many destinies God has willed for us depending on the free will we have chosen, by His Grace, has allowed us.<br>  Does that sound logical?<br>  <br>  <br>  The same logic I apply to God's mercy.<br>  I believe God is a loving God. I don't believe He is a God who would send us to Hell for not "believing". It doesn't make sense to have a Christian be "saved" after being an adulterous, cheating, lying scumbag just murmuring a prayer on his deathbed and be whisked off to Heaven, while a disbeliever or other religion who have sincerely searched for God and Truth, a good man who have done good deeds not to gain "heaven" or "brownie" points but because he really cares - to be condemn to an "eternal hell" simply because he didn't happen to be Christian.<br>  To me, that doesn't seem like a very "all-loving" God, but a discriminating one. That alone seems quite flawed to me. How can God discriminate when He is All-Merciful and All-loving?<br>  The "All" encompasses everything! Its not conditional - "Loving to all Christians". Its really "All-loving"!<br>  <br>  Just as how many have become disillusioned with Christianity, I returned to Christianity after many years as an atheist, then an agnostic.<br>  Why?<br>  Because I realised you don't have to believe in some pastor's, some pope's, some yabbo's interpretation of YOUR relationship with God. Why should I believe some pastor when he says I have to "pray facing the north star" (example, not fact) just because he thought some passage in the Bible (3 wise men following the north star for example) meant that you had to pray to God facing the North star?!<br>  <br>  As long as you are sincere, you seek knowledge and answers, and you ask people for those answers - taking answers from them as a reference (not as the rule) - what makes you any less believing than a Christian who does things 100% by the Bible blindly?<br>  <br>  I believe God is One who judges us not on a 'one sized fits all' ideology but based on the personal relationship we have with Him. He judges us based on our individual, not on a generic mould.<br>  <br>  Once I came to this epiphany I realised how true God is. I prayed. Seek and you shall find. How true these words are.<br>  <br>  My friend, you asking questions is the best thing you could ever do as a human being. As long as you keep asking, you know you're on the right track.<br>  <br>  I hope that you do find God, and disregard the many cookie cutter Christians out there whom I believe, actually do prevent many sincere people from forging a personal relationship with God with their judgmental conditions and declarations.<br>  <br>  Try to pray to God. When I first did so, it was awkward - like I was talking to myself, to nothingness. It felt stupid. *I* felt stupid.<br>  But later as my life continued, things happened when I prayed, I realised God does listen. You just have to look out for Him. :)<br>  <br>  <br>  God Bless,<br>  Jenova.|`|IBzbZc94aa	If God is all powerful, how powerful is Satan? God can't tamper with free will (can he?) and so on. But Satan can mess with people, send them to hell right off, infect people with Demons. Makes him a bit more powerful than God, eh?<br>  <br>  So no, not everything would happen according to God's will.... Or would it? How do we know if God and Satan don't work together? If we recieived no punishment and had no temptation to do bad, why would we do good? Christian morals according to Jesus are to be kind to your neighbor and friends in hope that they will treat you the same. But it has been twisted to "Be nice or go to hell". So God may employ Satan to tempt man, and thus it is God's will. Or Satan may be interfering and thus God's will may not work...<br>  <br>  It also involves a matter of predesitination. If you believe that God knows everything and who is going to hell and not, then everything is according to God's will. But if you don't believe that, then it is open to interpriation...<br>  <br>  There is also the problem that apart from God and Jesus, no one really knows God's true will, as the Lord works in mysterious ways, as they say...<br>  <br>  Hope that helps.

YaMdGqxlaa	Chinese. Because of sheer numbers.<br>  <br>  It is not so useful to learn German as German people generally speak very good English and often very good French. <br>  <br>  French is fine, but not so useful for work. It is worth learning for the sheer beauty of it, but to truly speak and appreciate French would require years of intense study.<br>  <br>  So why not try Mandarin. Not so difficult, quite nice and exciting.|`|w3UPO7koaa	In my personal opinion, it seems that China and many other parts of Asia are having a larger impact on what a lot of professions rely on. At least for me, German hasn't really come up a whole lot in my career, nor anyone I know. If you're up for a bit of a challenge, Chinese is probably the language I would suggest for you. There's also that there are far more Chinese-speaking people than German-speaking.<br>  Hopefully this answers a few of your questions :) Good luck!|`|kqMDzJw0aa	Chinese. A friend of mine (White American) went to Chinese night school since he was 3 yrs. old.

The usefulness of a language depends entirely on where you are. Obviously in Germany, German is more useful.<br>  <br>  Mandarin is popular now - but the same thing happened with Japanese in the 80s.<br>  <br>  Overall I'd say German is more useful - traveling around the world, you're probably more likely to encounter someone who speaks German than someone who speaks Mandarin - but it's really hard to say that one language is more "useful" than another.|`|CtzJvAKaaa	Lots of words in English come from German, so if you're more into etymology, German is the way to go.

bRRNYsK8aa	with myself, as a writer, i'd take it to a meterphorical level ... ya know.? & work your way up from that with ideas based on such. it'll put forth a much better lasting impression, & rly put the reader in awe if it's well-written. if you're writing it for school, then definitely go with that idea ... i mean, it's my own personal style, but teachers love that kinda style anywho. so go for it, & branch up with your own creativity. make it moral-oriented ... like, if you helped to turn someone's life around within the community, & how that prospered ... base it on something literal, but turn it around into a theoretically based thing, if that makes any sense at all. lol. good luck. :]

QF4W5aYRaa	READ and STUDY your BIBLE!! Get The Word of God in you. That is why The Bible tells you to "renew" your mind daily. Then what your telling here, you need to seek out a Christian Bible believing deliverance ministry.. Son, you've got demons. Oppressed, not possessed. The heaviness you feel is them, trying to get you to continue in sin. Remember, the devils only job is to "steal, kill, and destroy".Sound familiar? Pray, read and pray!! God has a great, and mighty plan for your life, and someone doesn't want you to reconnect with your Creator. The Lord has me work and pray with a spiritual warfare team, the spirit world is very real, and dangerous. But greater is He that is in me than he who is of this world! Praise God!<br>    Father God, I thank You for reaching out to this young soul, Lord, give him the strength and guide his feet to the proper people who are able to help him in his time of need. Father, press on his heart that this is his time, You are waiting on him to come forth out of the darkness, and into Your beautiful, loving light. Thank You Father. In Jesus Name Amen.|`|xZ1GD4zbaa	I suggest you find a good church in your area and make some friend in the church that you can relate to.|`|r6JskEtxaa	Remember that god is forgiving and omnipresent.

Your God knows about pornography. Adultery is the tough one. Adultery can hurt another. Getting right with yourself (God) means you can't risk hurting another human. Can you stop the adultery? If not then can you justify it? Very non religious thinking but you go with what you have.|`|OndkYzHdaa	The only way for you to get right with God is for you to confess your sins to Him and repent of them. If you really are repentent and want to stop doing these things then confess and ask God to help you when you're tempted..He will. 1 John 1:9 "If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness." Spend time in prayer and His word. This way you will get to know who He is. He is so amazing and He will always be there for you. Draw near to Him and He will draw near to you. I'll be oraying for you.|`|AsGstuH3aa	read your bible and pray AND REPENT<br>  <br>  only through Jesus Christ can you save yourself from eternal damnation|`|8Hj9oxVDaa	Get a girlfriend.|`|GQbH0whQaa	dude are you christian? cause i am, but i don't take god in such a  serious manner as the way you do. for some reason i like to think of God as how i want him to be, you know. A funny, laughing loving guy. Not that sort of- cold guy in the bible. God is in everyone and everything, so he is a form of everyone and everything. if he is in me, then he must be like me right? He is the image in my head. I don't believe in all the church says, but even if you have done things that the church says is wrong, don't you worry. If you can forgive yourself, and just be like- "God, can you forgive me? Even if what i did isn't wrong, it feels wrong to me, so please for some conformation, forgive me." You'll feel better already. Every night i just tell him in my own words that i am thankful, and to watch over everyone that i love. If you simply tell god what you feel, let him know... i think you'll be okay then :)|`|cmZ5Opmuaa	You sound a lot like me. I accepted the Lord when I was 10 and kind of strayed and re dedicated my life not to long ago....i strayed because of the same thing! ....Just say, "Lord, I give you my life and trust you with it." I said that when I rededicated my life to Him. Sometimes it's really hard. But if you read the Word,  and sometimes when you sin, and don't hear from God, it's because sin is keeping you away from Him. Just ask God to forgive you of your sins, and they will be forgiven. When i strayed and sinned a lot and came back to the Lord, i didnt hear from Him at first because sin was between Him and I. So i said a prayer and He re entered my life, because I was sick of sinning and fulfilling my evil desires. When I looked in the mirror i saw and ugly picture, i got to the point where I hated myself. But God kind of tugged on my heart and said, I'm here,......God bless ya:)...Hey and God will forgive you. Just ask... :).And start reading the bible again! Read romans 10:9-13 for salvation....If you don't have a bible, then go to CBD.com and they have a lot of bibles that are cheap! well some of them are expensive but some of them are cheap. Just remember that no sin is too great for God to forgive. I mean He's God! He can do anything! haha :)|`|ehm3vCYXaa	You have taken the first step by realizing you need God. God made a way so that everyone could connect with God. He sent His only Son 2000 yrs ago to die a brutal death on a cross to pay for the penalty of our sins. To put it in human terms, you're in a court room as a defendent convicted of premeditated murder and they're about to put you on death row, and then someone stands up and says punish me instead, and they do and let you go scot free!! "God demonstrated his own love for us in this:while we were yet sinners, Christ(God) died for us."  Romans 5:8<br>  So in light of that, you need to trust in what Christ has done for you, and tell God that you are doing so. But you can't be good enough to earn what Christ has done. No one can.  Ephesians 2:8-9 "For by grace you have been saved through faith; and that not of yourselves, it is the gift of God ; not as a reult of works, that no one should boast."<br>  So you should talk to God in your own way as though you're talking to a friend, and tell Him you are turning away from your sins and to connect with Him. Then once you've done that tell someone. No matter who. You should find a Church to go on a regular basis, and start reading the Bible and talking to God, which is known as prayer. God bless!!|`|hHtJOeu5aa	God is pleased that you want to return to Him.  Simply confess your sins before Him and He is faithful and just to forgive you of your sins and cleanse  you from all unrighteousness.  I, too, have drifted some from God...still I know that He is with me,.  Remember, a man chooses his path but the Lord guides his steps.  God bless.|`|tihEd6vfaa	The things you are describing are entirely normal. In fact, it would be odd if you didn't. Just calm down and stop feeling guilty for breathing. I would suggest doing honest research about the Bible, if you really want to go down the Christian route. The best advice would really be to calm down. Unless one of those unavoidable sins is that you are a serial killer, you are not doing anything wrong.|`|qYMAebZEaa	By realizing how much you need Him.  That without Him, you would be doomed to spend eternity in Hell because of the sins we commit.  But because He cared/loved us so much, He sent His son to suffer and die.  And He did that for YOU.  He would have done it for you if you were the only person in the world.  By accepting Jesus's death and resurrection, you can reconnect with him.  Do it by just getting on your knees.  Start talking to God.  It doesn't have to sound articulate or anything, just talk to Him about how sorry you are and how much you appreciate what He did for you and how much you want to get to know Him.
Mpl6auhBaa	Nope, we never find out. <br>  <br>  Alice is in jail for the spin-off because she was CONVICTED for the murder of Jennifer Schecter, but that doesn't necessarily mean she did it - personally, I don't think she did. She went into the party with the intention of making up with Jenny, Jenny didn't do anything to upset her while she was there, and the Tasha/Jaimie situation had nothing to do with Jenny. So I don't see why she would.<br>  <br>  Personally, I have two theories. One is that Bette killed Jenny. Bette totally has the guts for something like that, and actually threatened Jenny. She had the most to lose if Jenny lived; others simply wanted revenge. In addition, she was the last person to see Jenny and actually talked to her on the balcony - it would have been really simple simply to push her over the edge and into the pool, then go back downstairs as if nothing had happened. <br>  <br>  My other theory (which I don't think actually happened, but which I like) is that Jenny knew that she was going to be thrown out of their group, and killed herself to screw with their lives one last time. They would remember her forever, and as the killer would never definitively be caught, they would have to live with the knowledge that one of their close friends was a murderer forever, without knowing who it was. <br>  <br>  The point of the ending was SUPPOSED to be that no one would get caught or convicted because they all would protect each other, because their friendships are just that strong. Except that the spin-off totally messes that up. <br>  <br>  Personally, I won't be watching the spin-off, as the entire concept seems very shoddy, and even a brief reading of the ideas and characters seems very badly written. Alice is my favorite character, and I think that the spin-off wouldn't do her or The L Word justice. <br>  <br>  Sorry for the lengthy answer, but I had a lot to say :)
nuCXcLUIaa	Atheism is, gays have always existed and only recently have been confronted with ridiculous dogmas that keep people from thinking clearly.|`|fgxajTiBaa	My dad thinks that gay people are nature's way of keeping our population down. Me? I think infertile people are nature's way of keeping our population down, but since we've gone against nature and people who wouldn't naturally be able to have children are forcing it on their bodies anyways, evolution has essentially stopped in many ways.<br>  <br>  Though your religion point is interesting. I have heard before that humans naturally look to a supernatural force to explain away many things. It is funny that some people can persay 'look the other way' when it comes to religion. I'm gay AND atheist! I am a superbeing! :)|`|EMVT2xjEaa	Atheists: Yes. We are finally getting over religion and throwing away irrational beliefs...<br>  Religion will probably never go away [one could hope it would], but it can definitely be curved to far beyond what it is now! <br>  <br>  Gay people: Gay people have been around forever. This is especially true because thousands of other species have been documented being gay'<br>  <br>  "religion is a part of our genes" - It's not genetic. It passes from from generation to generation by indoctrination of children<br>  <br>  EDIT:<br>  If you want some really good books on evolution or religion, let me know!|`|tVUBqdSzaa	maybe being atheist is a sign of evolution.<br>  it gives you the right to think freely, to raise your children with the freedom of thought and to go on and practice the religion they want, and living without fear of going to hell.|`|AQPmrsVSaa	"I'm wondering how this will develope because religion is a part of our genes"<br>  <br>  ?????|`|AA10214265	Its an interesting concept, but there's a lot of historical evidence against it. First, gay people have been around forever, as evidenced by the Bible, the Koran, the Kama Sutra sculptures in India, tombs in Egypt, Native American Two-Spirits, and the Greco/Roman Empire, so being gay is not a new phenomena. What is new is the changing societal attitudes toward homosexuality, as evidence by the growing acceptance for equality and gay civil rights in employment, housing, and social structures.<br>  <br>  Religion has always been around as well, perhaps as a result of the neocortical expansion. Man has long sought to explain the world around him and, when explanations were not readily available, created myths, gods and legends to explain them. At the same time, as empires rose in the east in Egypt, Greece, Phoenicia and elsewhere, man sought to understand cause and effect and explain or even predict observable conditions. Megalithic structures like Stonehenge accurately account for solar alignments at Winter Solstice. Greece gave us the concept of Zero and expanded mathematics. Phoenicia gave us phonetic writing rather than pictograms. All of these steps toward a greater understanding occurred during times when the social structure involved the worship of multiple gods.<br>  <br>  Then came the Middle Ages. Rome had fallen, there was no central power but the Church, and scientific inquiry was branded as heretic. It didn't stop, as evidenced by the Renaissance thinkers like Galileo and Da Vinci, but there was a long period where free-thinking was frowned upon.<br>  <br>  I don't think that religion is genetic, but rather an awareness of the world around and a desire to explain its many variables. Some folks are content with supernatural explanations while others seek more logical answers.<br>  <br>  As to the economy, it has nothing to do with either religion or homosexuals but plain and simple greed. Greedy banks seeking to make money on super-risky loans, potential homeowners greedily buying more house than they can reasonably afford using loan instruments beyond their ability to pay for them.|`|VH8q5HPaaa	Damn I hope so. Well actually the fact that human was smart enough to even start making up Religions is a sign of evolution. Although I doubt we'll evolve out of Religion the same way we evolved into it. People will always develop philosophies.|`|KDXAJFLhaa	I know what your getting at.. how society is becoming more open to these ideas & what not... yes I do think you are right to a point :)|`|73W7ReR9aa	The world is coming apart at the seams; are u on crack?|`|xUBGRuK7aa	-"Don't Litter!

And if there is suddenly a decline in population because of gay people, it's not like there won't be sperm for artificial insemination or DNA for Cloning (in the future obviously).

AA11048813	You are asking hypothetical philosophical questions similar to the midievil questions such as "How many angels dance on the head of a pin?"  These are rhetorical questions that have no answer.<br>  <br>  Archbishop James Ussher of Dublin (Church of England) calculated Existence to have started Sunday October 23 4004 BC.<br>  <br>  Of course he was f******g insane (he also persecuted Catholics and other minorities) to illustrate his open-mindedness.<br>  <br>  Why don't you just stick to Alfred Russel Wallace and James Darwin with their outstanding treatises on Natural Selection (1858) and let it go as that.  It appears that life started in the heat of volcanoes and proceeded upward after that.  Survivability was dictated by "Natural Law" which, obviously, God created.  God had infinite time to deal with and He could tolerate a zillion blind alleys for evolution to go down before there was a success.  You see, you are making God in man's image and not the other way around.  Just because people cannot imagine evolution does not mean that it didn't exist.<br>  <br>  If you are using Genesis as your source, St. Augustine of Hippo, c. 408 AD shot that down by claiming Christians were not to look to Genesis to explain the Natural World as that would make them to look preposterous.  Even Reverend Billy Graham and Pope John-Paul II claimed that Genesis was allegory and should not replace scientific observation in approach to the Natural Universe.<br>  <br>  It strikes me how Fundamentalist Biblical apologists, in their frenetic attempts to prove the inerrancy of the Bible, have to go outside the Bible to prove their point.  To wit - Cain slew Abel and was banished to the land of Nod whereupon he took a wife.  Where did she come from?  No mention of her before.  So these apologist say "Well, the Bible never said that here weren't other children of Adam and Eve..."<br>  <br>  Hey, if they can go outside the Bible to prove the Bible, so can I and then my conclusions are just as valid as theirs and my conclusions have the weight of brilliant minds giving me my data.<br>  <br>  So, don't rack your brain over meaningless trivia.  If you are a Christain, when you meet the Big One, all you will be asked is "How did you let Jesus influence your life?"  You won't be asked trivial questions about nonsensical allegory.  If you are Jewish, you'll get asked the same question ("How did God's teachings affect you?") and I hope if you are Muslim, you get the same drilling.<br>  <br>  It appears that Buddhists, et al, are already there but they do their rampant killing, rape and mayhem, too.<br>  <br>  Read Richard Dawkins book "The God Delusion" (he is an atheist.)  Well, I am not an atheist but I sure like what he writes other than his so-called "proof" that there is no God.  Trust me, there is one, but He ain't the bullshit picture Fundamentalists paint Him to be.|`|nPSqX7Paaa	Well... a month (approx) in that time was considered a year if you looked at it. To be exact the Aztec Calendar was the one that demonstrated the days, weeks, months and years. <br>  <br>  Adam and Eve were created not perfect, but the perfect reflection of Him (The Lord). As Adam and Eve were created, we all, are created by Him, so all of us are considered perfect and unique. <br>  <br>  The world itself is considered perfect and with wonders that we have not discovered. The world is a wonderful place, in which time is not important, but the experience in time and by the time we use it.<br>  Hope I helped in some way.<br>  Good luck.<br>  Cheers,|`|2RygPGRaaa	A day was a literal day then as it is now. 24 hours.

A year has always been a year. Now, ancient people did have a hard time trying to make it fit in with a lunar cycle calendar, and had to add a month at the end of the year. This has always been an issue and now we have gotten it down to adding one day every four years, but they still understood a year to be a complete revolution based on the seasons. <br>  <br>  People lived longer because we are actually meant to live much longer than we do. I have no direct sources to give you right now, but scientists have found that there are "aging genes" and that the body is actually capable of going on and on. This indicates that death is a planned thing, just as the Bible says. There is also a prophecy that the days of extreme longevity will return before the end, and that a man who dies at 100 will be considered a mere baby. It is a documented fact that the human lifespan is growning at this time. There are more people living past 100 and the practical working age of people is getting older. Now that Obama has cut the stem cell researchers loose, that prophecy may be closer than we think.|`|ZzXK3nAAaa	Once again it's time to cut through the crap. People on this site are the farthest thing from informed on such subjects, much less experts--and that includes me. A mass of prejudice, uninformed opinion, and misinformation will not settle these questions here, and I humbly submit that's all you'll get here. Better minds have devoted centuries of research and thought to these matters, and there's a place you'll find it: "The Interpreter's Bible," which your reference librarian will find for you. There's an entire VOLUME on just Genesis, including the TWO (yes; two) Creation stories, the ages of all the main characters, and all the "begats."  Plus there's the problem of multiple translations. Know all those funny apostrophes in the ancient Hebrew? They're there because   nobody knows what vowels they stood for, much less how to write them. The Aramaic is a second-or maybe even a third-hand translation, which makes the literalists look pretty foolish. Ask them to explain the "camel through the eye of a needle," for instance. It's a perfectly rational translation error, but not one in ten thousand literalists has any idea what it was.|`|gDVQNMR7aa	Good grief. Astronomy goes back several millennium. A year was never 28 or 40 days.|`|AA11124121	whatwhatwhat?  that's a mess! LOL!<br>  <br>  The provable existence of gaps in the biblical genealogies and the use of ab to designate a line of descendents makes it entirely likely that Adam could have been created 10's of thousands of years ago. <br>  <br>  <br>  The Bible itself states that the covenant and laws of God have been proclaimed to a "thousand generations" (Deuteronomy 7:9, 1 Chronicles 16:15, Psalms 105:8). The Bible does not give 1000 genealogies, so one must assume that those given are only highlights of the actual genealogies. <br>  <br>  Since the Bible declares that there have been 1,000 generations, even if a generation is considered to be 20 years, this adds up to at least 20,000 years. <br>  <br>  A biblical generation is often described as being 40 years, which would represent at least 40,000 years. However, since the first dozen or more generations were nearly 1,000 years, this would make humans nearly 50,000 years old, which agrees very well with dates from paleontology and molecular biology (see Descent of Mankind Theory: Disproved by Molecular Biology).<br>  <br>  Please read the charts of all theories presented by this scientist. That should answer some of your ?'s..okay dudette?|`|Ya4jDBhEaa	I am not sure of the questions regarding year measurements.

He used that protective covering of waters above earth's atmosphere in the world-wide flood that he wiped the earth clean with.  After that, the protective layer has remained on the earth, rather than above it.  With the loss of its protection, came a notable lessening of man's life expectancy, from just over 900 years (the Bible gives the record of nine men who lived prior to the global flood of Noah’s day and which record shows an average life-span of 847 years.—Gen. 5:1-31), to less than 100 years:<br>  <br>  "In themselves the days of our years are seventy years; <br>  and if because of special mightiness they are eighty years..." --Psalm 90:10<br>  <br>  This lack of protection has effected all other life forms on our planet.<br>  The loss of the hot-house effect has reportedly resulted in both lessened growth, <br>  & lessened life expectancies.|`|fKQluTgVaa	what you are refering to is the Roman Calandar . it was used for a very long time . and it was incorect . so they began to go back to the Egyptian calandar we still use today . but because of the embarasment of the church . they forced the new calandar to fit there little view of ---well -- everything .... but it is the same ones that say the everything was created in 6 days . as in 24 hr intervals . but they also say we came from mass incest . not once . but twice . so to find what you want you will have to start at the Egyptian calendar

VWtUhan3aa	I have a lot of hispanic friends down here in Texas and I've asked some of them about this before. Basically it's a celebration to announce the girl (now 15) has reached young womanhood and is no longer a nina but instead a senorita. Although they've said officially a girl is not always "really" called senorita until she's 21.<br>  <br>  I've attended several quinceanera services and parties (most of the ones I went to doubled as christenings for babies as well) and noted that typically the god parents are a part of the ritual, along with of course the parents & grandparents. The girls are usually driven by limousine and have a young males escort. It's all very cute. =)<br>  <br>  Afterwards there is always a big party, cookout and dance and often even the families of the babies which were christened congregate with the other families at the festivities even if they're not related to one another. <br>  <br>  So it's like a rite of passage... very similar to the debutante balls that go on here in the south (maybe everywhere, I don't know) where a young lady is "formally introduced to society". It's all a celebration of coming of age. And they spare no expense! lol <br>  <br>  Edit: I don't think I actually answered the question. lol It's not generally so important to the men/father's, per se, as it is to the women. It's such a longstanding tradition (apparently once upon a time actually more to announce that the nina is now a senorita and now available for marriage) that the mothers tend to get excited all over again, only now for their daughters instead, and the closer the time gets the more it's discussed and planned until it culminates into this grand affair.

Jesus becomes the "Sacrificial Lamb" and steps into that place because He came to die for our sins, and the shedding of His blood was what it took to do away with these practices. He did this on His own and freed us once and for all from the clutches of sin.

You made the right choice.<br>  <br>  EDIT:<br>  Of course I will accept you, there are LGBT Christians|`|TWE4AKX5aa	That means a lot. It really does.<br>  And of course we'll accept you...I, personally, have many Christian friends who I love to death.|`|ANOBEJPXaa	Absolutely! <3 If we were to reject you, we'd be total hypocrites. ^^ Who wants that? We'll always welcome support with open arms.

It's really cool to have a little more support. I wish that many more people of every faith could look into their beliefs and see that peace can't be achieved through such discrimination. So high five, and I'll accept you.|`|e0e02336b485c5330b6b15ff4bc7a6d9aa	It's the bigots I have a problem with, but if your a Christian I don't care..I went to a Catholic school for 9 years..I'm use to it|`|tnRO5gB8aa	Of course I will!|`|UbvglIS6aa	I would never ask anyone to stop believing in whatever God you believe in.  My only problem with Christians is that many of them condemn the GLBT folks and treat us like trash.  I know that isn't how Jesus told them to be.  I have actually read most of the Bible.  I was raised in the Church.  I know a lot of what is there and I don't interpret it all the way a lot of Christians do.<br>  <br>  So the answer to this question is - yes, I can accept you if you accept me.|`|r7Vhc9zNaa	sure...<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  I'm a Christian AND I'm gay!|`|aHLnNrOGaa	I am a gay Christian.  Yes, I will accept you; even if you do NOT accept me.  (But I am glad you do).<br>  <br>  You get it.  You see the big picture.  We are all here to learn from each other; help each other.  There is a reason God made some of us gay.  Maybe just for this reason.<br>  <br>  Take care and God bless.|`|nT0w6VIKaa	Being an active Roman Catholic gay male...I already accepted you (though I may not have appreciated your perspectives...especially about gay people)...

A clock fell off the wall in the living room about ten seconds into the game, but it was her cat jumping from the couch. Then a creepy noise came from her room but it was just her brother playing a ring tone. But just after we went to sleep there was a shadow me and my friend Clover saw. No one else was in the house but the party guests, and her brother. We never knew who it was...creepy, huh.

Then I read the rest of what you wrote.  Jeez hon you need to talk to someone and I am sure it feels so lonely and I am sure you don't know which way to go because of your feelings. This is so mixed and I can understand why you write this. I understand your confusion (more than you know).  You were in love with him and those emotions were there when he raped you.  I am sure there are a pile of emotions on top of that as well.  Take it from me you need to go to counseling.  You CAN forgive him but you should not go back to him.  He needs counseling too. Believe it or not there are actually some men that do this and only to that one woman and not to every woman they have been with - I don't understand it completely but it must be the dynamics of these two individuals that come into play.  He might even deny it was rape - even when he continues to do it.  He might even try to put the blame on you like this is what you wanted or we were going to eventually do it anyway. But this is beside the point even if you think he will never do it again and he thinks he never will you both need counseling.  REALLY need it.  Please get it and don't meet up with him. You have to work on this issue that has to do with you first.  You know if you want to email me you can.  I know people are saying all these rotten things about him and maybe it does not measure up with the person you knew him to be before he did what he did.  Is he completely rotten? I am sure you think he is not and that is why you are so confused.  But above all right now is not the time to meet with him.  You are still too vulnerable.  Email me if you need to.  May God bless you sweety. I'm sending prayers.|`|2RygPGRaaa	I am a Christian, I believe in forgiveness. In this case you can forgive but keep your distance. HE RAPED YOU!!! He proved to you that he is dangerous. Maybe he changed his ways, but I doubt it, I wouldn't want to give him another chance to find out if he really did change or not. Protect yourself, leave the criminal alone, and find a man who will love you and protect you and cherish you for what you are.  There is a difference between forgiving and looking for trouble. You don't have to be friends with everyone. People have the misconception that God is all loving all the time. God does love all but there does come a time when God says enough is enough. This is why Hell exists. He punishes those that continue to rebel. Some people never change. Don't be a victim for a second time. God Bless|`|MKWkPH2vaa	I cant give you avise as a christian but I can give you avise as a woman who has been through a similar experiance. Get as far away from that man as possible. Forgiveness can only take you so far... and I nearly got killed because I forgave the wrong man one to many times. Sometimes it can reach a point of beating a dead horse, why even consider continuing in a relationship that you know would never work out. Bottom of the line... if he raped you he did not care about you or what your wants are, that means he did not respect you. And that he did not ever love you. Get him away, call the cops if he wont. But he should eventually move on to someone else and get out of your hair. Start dating someone else, there are always better guys out there... always.

The Bible is the only authoritative word of God because he said it is.  I don't know how to prove it other than that.  I'm not a deity.<br>  <br>  To finish your sentence, God wants you to recognize Jesus is the only begotten son and promised messiah.  He wants you to repent of your sins and live a life holy and pleasing to him, continuing to repent every time sin is revealed in your life, which comes in many ways:<br>  <br>  Sin is word, thought, deed, and motivation that does not honor God.  Saying God doesn't exist is blasphemy and a sin of your words.  Thinking about having sex with a woman is the same as actually having sex with her.  If she isn't your wife it is called adultery.  Thinking it is sin in thought, doing it is sin in deed.  Cleaning your room not because you want to but because you have to because your parents are bigger than you or they will punish you if you don't is sin motivation.  You are not honoring them.  You are merely following orders against your will.<br>  <br>  Additionally, sin omission and commission.  Omission is where you don't do something you should have done.  Commission is you do something you shouldn't have done.  Your brother is in sin and you don't try to help him out of it.  That is a sin of omission.  Like our father Adam your are being lazy and tending to your duties.  If you go out and speed you are sinning.  We are to abide by the laws of the government so far as they do not contradict the bible, and speeding is against the law.  That is a sin of commission.  You did it and you weren't supposed to.<br>  <br>  God wants you to study your bible and know it.  He wants you cry out for salvation and turn to him.  He wants to have mercy on you and show you grace, but he will not do it at the expense of his name or glory.  If you continue to reject him because of what other people say and do you will die in your sins and blame shifting will not save you, just like it didn't save Adam or Eve.  The Bible is full of what God wants you to do.  Just read it and ask the Holy Spirit for wisdom and direction.  Ask Jesus to save you.  Repent.  If you continue to repent all your life and are changed by the word of God, you were saved.  If you don't change, if you don't repent, if you live life according to what you think is right and not according to what God says is right then you weren't saved and when you die you will go to hell.  That's what the Bible teaches.|`|118h96Q8aa	I never presume to know what God thinks. How can I possibly know?

9d60a294b6864b585406ddb61a14d757aa	No.  Some versions of the bible say he went to hell.  This is a problem in translation, though.  The correct terminology should be HADES or SHEOL.  Hades and Sheol are not hell.  Hades/Sheol is the waiting place for the dead.  The fate of those in hades is sealed but judgment has not been passed.  There are two separate parts of hades.  One is called paradise for those who are saved.  It is separated from the area of torment by a great gulf.  We see this in the story of the rich man and Lazarus.  The rich man looks across the gulf and sees Lazarus in the bosom of Abraham in paradise and asks that he be allowed to come over and cool the rich man's tongue.  He is told that is impossible because of the great gulf.  Both Lazarus and the rich man were in Hades/Sheol.  One was in agony and the other in paradise.  So Jesus, just like Lazarus, went to Hades, not hell awaiting his resurrection. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.gotquestions.org/did-Jesus-go-to-hell.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.gotquestions.org/did-Jesus-go...</a>|`|AA11232725	Jesus did not go to Hell if by that you mean that He went to suffer more for our sins. Instead what some scholars have speculated is that Jesus went down and preached the gospel to the Saints who were waiting for the promised Messiah before He rose again.<br>  <br>  Other scholars say that He went to the underworld of Hades to declare His victory over Satan.<br>  <br>  Still other scholars say that Jesus preached by the Spirit through Noah and that's what this passage is talking about.<br>  <br>  1 Peter 3:18  For Christ also suffered once for sins, the just for the unjust, that He might bring us to God, being put to death in the flesh but made alive by the Spirit,  19  by whom also He went and preached to the spirits in prison,  20  who formerly were disobedient, when once the Divine longsuffering waited in the days of Noah, while the ark was being prepared, in which a few, that is, eight souls, were saved through water.<br>  <br>  In either event, Jesus finished His work of salvation on the cross. He didn't get tortured in Hell or have to suffer more for our salvation. Notice that the above passage says "Christ also suffered once for sins".|`|X9rXRNUxaa	Act 2:22  Ye men of Israel, hear these words; Jesus of Nazareth, a man approved of God among you . . . <br>  <br>  Act 2:27  Because thou wilt not leave my soul in hell, neither wilt thou suffer thine Holy One to see corruption. <br>  <br>  Act 2:31  He seeing this before spake of the resurrection of Christ, that his soul was not left in hell, neither his flesh did see corruption. <br>  <br>  The "hell" spoken of here is the tomb ( or the grave ).<br>  <br>  Jesus did NOTHING there, He slept until His resurrection.<br>  <br>  Jesus did NOT go to "hell-fire" it does not exist - YET !<br>  <br>  May God bless you as you study His Word<br>  <br>  <:)))><|`|AA10011095	Yes according to the bible he went to hell.|`|k7FD3rt5aa	He went to paradise. <Luke 23:43>|`|g4AAZRuxaa	No.|`|67EaIAvbaa	be careful,or,see ya!,ohhh..i mean..WON'T SEE YA!!..i pray i won't.|`|GCqmaDfSaa	Not the hell of the damned, but what is commonly called the limbo of the fathers or "the bosom of abraham." Before Christ defeated death, the pious jews who died under the old covenant were not damned, but neither could they enter heaven because Christ had not opened it. So they went to a sort of holding area. After Christ died, He went to the area to bring the pious souls to heaven. So we say "He descended into hell" or "He descended to the dead", but hell in this instance means a place of temporary separation from God, not eternal.|`|yDJiiqcsaa	Not hell as we think about it today. He went to "sheol" meaning the "underworld" since the gates of heaven were not open to anyone (just or not) until Jesus purchased that for all souls by His death and resurrection.

Well, they don't read the bible, so they didn't know that JC didn't "descend into Hell". <br>  <br>  What they mean to say is that JC got crucified, died and then rose again - not "descended into Hell" - but maybe 'descending into Hell" sounded real dramatic.  <br>  <br>  Religions are so full of crap!  And what's funny is the people who are religious don't even seem to notice when they break their own rules or tell lies.|`|kX0T1urdaa	Yes He did. There are different compartments in hell. Paradise was once in the center of the earth which is where the saints who went before Jesus finished the work of salvation were held captive by the devil until Jesus freed them and took them to heaven. Paradise was a pleasant place but very restrictive (my guess) Remember Jesus told the thief on the cross he would be with Him that day in Paradise?<br>  <br>  He also preached to the fallen angels that are chained there. My guess is He showed them He was victorious, not the devil.<br>  <br>  I have a lot more about this subject on my website. <br>  <br>  Hell<br>  <a href="http://armageddonangelsufos.com/new_page_13.htm" rel="nofollow">http://armageddonangelsufos.com/new_page...</a> <br>  <br>  Purgatory, Reincarnation, Ghosts<br>  <a href="http://armageddonangelsufos.com/new_page_15.htm" rel="nofollow">http://armageddonangelsufos.com/new_page...</a><br>  <br>  what we will be doing when in Heaven<br>  <a href="http://armageddonangelsufos.com/literal%20babylon.htm" rel="nofollow">http://armageddonangelsufos.com/literal%...</a>|`|XpZumlkwaa	They were in a type of prison not hell.<br>  No-one is in hell yet, unless we speak of the grave.<br>  <br>  Hell fire is the infamous place for evil.<br>  <br>  Go to I Peter 3: 18-22.<br>  Read for yourself where He went so you can remember it once and for all.<br>  <br>  Bless your understanding.|`|ddea8dbfe02911fd00f96bb107edf2ffaa	Jesus did not go to hell. In this verse it says For God so loved the world that He gave his only begotten Son that whoever beliveth in Him should not perish but have everlasting life. Does this verse say anything about Jesus dying. God did not give Jesus onto death. He gave Jesus as an assurance of faith in Him that whoever believe in Jesus lives forever.  Yes, Jesus died on the cross, Yes He shed his blood for our sin. But what type of death is the death of our Christ if He sits on the right hand of the father. For what this was done. Those other things that are written are to disprove Jesus divinity and His gospel. For example, He was buried but who came and told me this to be true? Did Jesus ascend to heaven? Some say Jesus was a human? Is God human? Is God perfectly Holy? Is Jesus and God one? What does the beginning of John say, Who created hell and if the Word created it, what is the point going there? Was not Jesus born sinless? of a virgin who was overshadowed by the Holy Spirit? Give me a brake and let me say that I have no more faith in the laws of men than those  who are completely liars and not write the truth.|`|btridfokaa	Yes Jesus Christ descended into hell for us and for our salvation.<br>  <br>  Hell IS the English word for "Hades" (Greek) or "Sheol" (Hebrew).<br>  If people misunderstand the word "hell" to mean "the lake of fire" then this is not a problem with the use of the word but a problem with what the people have been lead to believe.<br>  <br>  Christ freed the righteous souls from the part of hell known as "Abraham's Bosom". He took those in Paradise below to Paradise above.<br>  [Note: the Roman Catholic Bishop Challoner notes in regards to Genesis 37:35 that the word hell refers to what they call "limbo" (not purgatory), the place where the souls of the just went prior to the death of Christ. Purgatory is said by the Latins to be a place where Christians who die today go to purge themselves of unconfessed sins. The Orthodox Church does not teach the existence of purgatory.]<br>  <br>  Biblical evidence:<br>  St Luke 16:19-31 is a true story. Early Christian records tell us the rich man was named Dives.<br>  <br>  For as Jonas was three days and three nights in the whale's belly; so shall the Son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth.<br>  (St Matthew 12:40)<br>  <br>  ...He also descended first into the lower parts of the earth... (Ephesians 4:9)<br>  <br>  For Christ also hath once suffered for sins, the just for the unjust, that he might bring us to God, being put to death in the flesh, but quickened by the Spirit: <br>  By which also he went and preached unto the spirits in prison;<br>  (1st Peter 3:18-9)<br>  <br>  After two days will He revive us: in the third day He will raise us up, and we shall live in His sight.<br>  (Hosea 6:2)<br>  <br>  If I ascend up into heaven, Thou art there: if I make my bed in hell, behold, Thou art there.<br>  (Psalm 139:8)<br>  <br>  ~~~<br>  Please also see my answers to similar related questions here:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://au.answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AuUn4RknSkhIxSCYMoSHNbzg5gt.;_ylv=3?qid=20090309104914AAzvrlW&show=7#profile-info-PkyYrdGMaa">http://au.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://au.answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=Anqo75b.8YRAqCV6H4.iMaPg5gt.;_ylv=3?qid=20090309112011AAr32Yr&show=7#profile-info-iMY2fgYdaa">http://au.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...</a>|`|zu9waOZ1aa	look in your bible, in first peter chapter3;19,20  look also in ephesians 4'7-10,|`|sg7qEqZsaa	JESUS WAS IN HELL THE 3 DAYS AFTER HE WAS CRUCIFIED, BUT NOT AFTER HE RESURRECTED.|`|nNDcM7h7aa	Read the book Carolyn and let God answer such Questions.

Such a thing is not mentioned in the Bible.   Jesus also had no reason to go there anyway. The powers of death and Hell were defeated after Christ's crucifixion and resurrection. God going to Hell makes no since anyway because Hell, by definition, is the very absence of God's presence. In Hell there is no hope, joy, peace, thanksgiving, or mercy. These qualities are some of God's attributes.<br>  <br>  Most of this confusion about Jesus going into Hell comes from the Apostles' Creed where it says, "He descended into Hell". The basis for this comes from 1 Peter 3:18-20 which says, "For Christ also hath once suffered for sins, the just for the unjust, that he might bring us to God, being put to death in the flesh, but quickened by the Spirit: By which also he went and preached unto the spirits in prison; Which sometime were disobedient, when once the longsuffering of God waited in the days of Noah, while the ark was a preparing, wherein few, that is, eight souls were saved by water."<br>  <br>  These confusing verses are actually talking about the time of Noah. It is saying that the same Holy Spirit that was in Christ was also the same Spirit that was preaching through Noah. The spirits in prison were sinners. They were dead in their sins and were awaiting judgment from a flood. But the Holy Spirit through Noah was preaching to them, warning them of their impending judgment.<br>  <br>  Only 8 people got on the Ark. The lesson here is that we should be obedient to preach God's Word to everyone we meet. We shouldn't worry about the results or whether or not we are reaping enough fruit.|`|THezIGOiaa	Yes, yes he did. You see. A while back, Jesus lent Satan his copy of Half-life 2.

Usually it was late, if ever. lol But, being good, I didn't make up lies and excuses, rather, I just plainly told my teachers I didn't do it because I already knew the material, so what's the point? "Shall I prove it? Ask me something." lol That actually worked on a lot of occasions, but not always. >:( <br>  <br>  But maybe if I had done my homework early or on time I wouldn't have swiped those Yoohoos from that old lady's shopping cart?? *taps fingers, contemplating* Nah, I would have still done it. I just might have planned it out better and been more timely, rather than how I did it, which on the spur of the moment and merely waiting for her to vanish from sight but taking a risk of her turning back suddenly and catching me. o_O<br>  <br>  But she didn't!

AA10007956	There are different types of fasting practised by different religions including Christianity.<br>  <br>  One is a 'normal fast', where you do not allow water or even food to touch your lips from sun up to sun down. You can check the sun rise and sun set times on your local Yahoo! weather.<br>  Jews, Christians and Muslims practise this fast.<br>  <br>  Then there is a partial fast. This was practised by some biblical figures where you abstained from meat and only had water and vegetables to sustain you.<br>  <br>  Then there is what you describe as a 'radical fast', which a person abstains from food and water or simply food (not water) for an extended period of time.<br>  You do not eat even after sunset or sun rise, and it is a continuous fast with no break in between.<br>  The normal period is 3 days. (Esther 4:15-16), (Ezra 10:6-9; Acts 9:9).<br>  <br>  David went 7 days without food (but probably with liquid) to plea to God to save his child's life. (2 Samuel 12:15-20). <br>  <br>  This was practiced with direct guidance from God by the prophets or a supernatural ability given by God to them.<br>  <br>  If you want, you can go on a partial fast or practise regular fasting weekly to pray for a cause or for your personal spiritual growth with God.<br>  But remember, it is generally agreed that if you are sick, bleeding, menstruating, have any expulsion of sexual fluids (meaning no sex, no wet dreams, no self-pleasure, no porn), indulging in anything harmful to health (cigarettes,etc) or commiting sin (thinking impure thoughts -once by 'accident' is generally acceptable- or sinful thoughts, lying cheating, etc etc) your fast is invalidated, you must repent and return to fast all over again.<br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck.<br>  <br>  <br>  Jenova|`|YPtNr2O6aa	well i think that fasting is pretty much defined as eating bugger all - why on eat would you want to do it anyway. Somehow, i don't think an all powerful deity would be concerned with what you eat.<br>  <br>  also, how in any way does fasting help childhood starvation? - i doubt those who have to suffer it would be very appreciative of that particular effort - why not just gove money to charity?|`|GqUFQmBkaa	there is only one type, the one in which you dont consume calories.(food)|`|tManvxfQaa	Read what trhe BIBLE says about fasting and not man made doctrines<br>  <br>  Isa 58:3 Wherefore have we fasted, [say they], and thou seest not? [wherefore] have we afflicted our soul, and thou takest no knowledge? Behold, in the day of your fast ye find pleasure, and exact all your labours.  <br>  <br>  Isa 58:4 Behold, ye fast for strife and debate, and to smite with the fist of wickedness: ye shall not fast as [ye do this] day, to make your voice to be heard on high.  <br>  <br>  Isa 58:5 Is it such a fast that I have chosen? a day for a man to afflict his soul? [is it] to bow down his head as a bulrush, and to spread sackcloth and ashes [under him]? wilt thou call this a fast, and an acceptable day to the LORD?  <br>  Isa 58:6 [Is] not this the fast that I have chosen? to loose the bands of wickedness, to undo the heavy burdens, and to let the oppressed go free, and that ye break every yoke? <br>  <br>  <br>  IF its not a FAST God has Called.....your fasting for nothing more then yourself desires !!!|`|agk5PFl1aa	You can fast something you really like doing.

1T35X8dEaa	I was born in Germany and moved to the United States before I was three.<br>  <br>  I am of mixed race (American and Korean), I know what it is like to be different. Growing up as a child my parents told me to be strong and ignore what people were saying. I did. I took in every mean and harsh things adults and children would say about Koreans and even about me.<br>  <br>  I have seen the ignorance of people when it comes to dealing with different races. I have almost gotten in fights because people would make fun of my mother or treat her like she was stupid.<br>  <br>  The United States have a different standard than most countries. They do not treat other like they want to be treated. That happens no matter what race or culture you are.<br>  <br>  Not to bash on American, seeing how I am one. When someone ask me what race I am I always tell them I am mixed and proud of it.<br>  <br>  I have been talked with about correcting other people's children too, mostly because those children are the ones that grow up and end up in jail.<br>  <br>  Sometimes it is not easy growing up in a family with two different races. You feel like you get judged by those who are full. (Full American or Full Korean)<br>  I go to a Korean church and I can see how people treat each other, if you are not a full korean, many full korean teens won't respect you, if you are a half korean teen, many half korean teens won't respect full koreans. Kind of odd. <br>  <br>  I have met people from different places around the world. And am eager to learn about their culture. Yet you have the bone heads who always think they will be better.<br>  <br>  Don't get offended when someone walks by and do not say hi. That happens alot in America, unless you make the first move and say hi they will ignore you.<br>  <br>  Now the peeing part I understand but when you got to go you got to go.<br>  <br>  I am suprised you got fined for not picking up after your dog, most parks or even some pet stores (their grass parts) are littered with dog poo. It is gross.<br>  <br>  One thing about adjusting to a culture some cultures are rude and some are not. Just depending on how a person was raised.<br>  <br>  I learned that when dealing with other cultures you need to respect them no matter how rude and impolite they are, because when those people realize they have not offended you or you ignored their rudeness they will start to learn they will get no where with what they are doing.<br>  <br>  Sometimes you need to stop and listen and educate others before you gain their respect.|`|7ED5xvGxaa	LOL, whoa. Yeah its different here. In many places here its all work no play and the customs are way different. In Jamaica, all life is about is pleasure and relaxing.

Passover ( Pesach in Hebrew) is the celebration of the deliverance of the eternal covenant nation Israel, the Hebrews, from the yolk of idolatry, superstition, and physical slavery in Egypt. It was a reaffirmation of their identity as a nation dedicated to God through Torah and our memorial reaffirms this for each generation. . The events we retell at Passover  were demonstration to Egypt that their deities were false and their man/god Pharoah impotent to God's power.<br>  <br>  It is a very important part of Judaism and many central aspects of our identity as an eternal covenant nation are embedded in it's observance. It has absolutely nothing to do with any form of Christian doctrine. Jesus is completely insignificant to it. Inserting Jesus into the Passover in fact INVALIDATES it as honoring the direct commandment in Torah.<br>  <br>  Christians may wish to rethink their claim of Jesus as the Paschal lamb if they read in the Torah what the lamb represents and why the covenant people, Israel is commanded for eternity to remember it.<br>  6:6 'Therefore say to the Israelites [in My name], 'I am God. I will take you away from your forced labor in Egypt and free you from their slavery. I will liberate you with a demonstration of My power, and with great acts of judgment. <br>  <br>  The Israelites had been subjugated to hundreds of years enslaved  in a culture that dwelled on death, false animal and man gods and superstition. God was going to break both the physical and spiritual bonds of enslavement to the Israelites.<br>  <br>  Through each one of the plagues God demonstrated to both the Egyptians and to Israel that the God of Israel was more powerful than the false gods of Egypt. <br>  <br>  After one of the plagues Pharaoh said to Moses:<br>  8:21 Pharaoh summoned Moses and Aaron. 'Go!' he said. '[You have permission to] sacrifice to your God here in [our] land.' <br>  <br>  8:22 'That would hardly be suitable,' replied Moses. 'What we will sacrifice to God our Lord is sacred to the Egyptians. Could we sacrifice the sacred animal of the Egyptians before their very eyes and not have them stone us? <br>  <br>  This is a direct reference to the LAMB representing their false god to the Egyptians. Israel was still enslaved in fear to do something like that in front of the Egyptians!<br>  <br>  8:23 What we must do is make a three day journey into the desert. There we will be able to sacrifice to God our Lord, just as He told us.<br>  8:24 'I will let you leave,' said Pharaoh, 'as long as you do not go too far away. You can sacrifice to God your Lord in the desert. But pray for me!'<br>  <br>  8:25 Moses answered, 'When I leave your presence, I will pray to God. Tomorrow, the creatures will go away from Pharaoh, his servants, and his people. But let Pharaoh never again deceive us, refusing to let the people sacrifice to God.'<br>  <br>  Well, we know Pharaoh went back on his word again so God then killed much of the Egyptian livestock ( representatives of their false gods by the way) and spared those of the Israelites. Then boils and then hail and they were still not convinced of the power of God over their gods.<br>  But God wasn’t done with his demonstration to fully convince the Egyptians and those of Israel who still may have had doubts and fears.<br>  <br>  10:2 You will then be able to confide to your children and grandchildren how I made fools of the Egyptians, and how I performed miraculous signs among them. You will then fully realize that I am God.' <br>  <br>  Pharaoh was still obstinate so locusts and darkness came..and then finally after Pharoah said Moses would see his face no more came the ultimate show of power and strength that also gave Israel the opportunity to demonstrate to Egypt and to God their loyalty. Finally, their bonds of enslavement of both mind and spirit were now shattered.<br>  <br>  11:4 Moses said [to Pharaoh] in God's name, 'Around midnight, I will go out in the midst of Egypt. <br>  <br>  11:5 Every first-born in Egypt will die, from the first-born of Pharaoh sitting on his throne, to the first-born of the slave girl behind the millstones. Every first-born animal [will also die]. <br>  <br>  11:7 But among the Israelites, a dog will not even whine because of man or beast. You will then realize that God is making a miraculous distinction between Egypt and Israel. <br>  <br>  11:8 'All your officials here will come and bow down to me. They will say, 'Leave! You and all your followers!' Only then will I leave.' He left Pharaoh in great anger. <br>  <br>  ONLY when Egypt is convinced of God’s power over their false gods will Israel depart with their freedom intact!<br>  <br>  Now the command to the Passover sacrifice begins and read carefully to understand what the sacrifice represented. I will not type everything here I hope you will read ALL of Exodus yourself to gain a fuller understanding.<br>  12:5 You must have a flawless young animal, a one-year-old male. You can take it from the sheep or from the goats. <br>  <br>  So it could be a sheep or a goat. Egypt had deities as represented from BOTH animals. How convenient…Israel is to kill representatives of Egyptian deities in their presence and to dip hyssop, an herb used to purify the holy Egyptian temples and DIP it in the VERY LIFE ESSENCE (that’s what they believed blood to be) of their deity in their presence as an act of defiance and mark their doors with it in allegiance to the God of Israel who will demonstrate His power over their false gods. Then they were to roast and eat their false Egyptian god representation in the presence of the Egyptians without any recourse done to them, thus demonstrating the impotence of their man/god Pharaoh and their other false gods.  In fact, they were “passed over” by the angel of death who instead punished the Egyptians for their idolatry and enslavement of mind and body.  Pharoah had done this to God’s “first-born” ( You shall tell Pharaoh, 'Thus says the Lord, Israel is my son, my firstborn.  Ex 4:22)<br>  <br>  12:12 I will pass through Egypt on that night, and I will kill every first-born in Egypt, man and beast. I will perform acts of judgment against all the gods of Egypt. I [alone] am God.<br>  That is a very important passage there..NOTE..God will enact judgment against the false gods..plural now..of Egypt. That was the purpose of the Passover sacrifice. <br>  12:13 The blood will be a sign for you on the houses where you are staying. I will see the blood and pass you by (pasach). There will not be any deadly plague among you when I strike Egypt. <br>  <br>  12:27 You must answer, 'It is the Passover service to God. He passed over the houses of the Israelites in Egypt when He struck the Egyptians, sparing our homes.' <br>  The people bent their heads and prostrated themselves. <br>  <br>  The Passover sacrifice, be it a sheep or a goat, was NEVER a sin sacrifice. The sacrifice serves to demonstrate the people’s courage, as they take the Egyptians’ object of worship and slaughter and eat it in the service of the God of Israel. <br>  <br>  Torah is clear that the sacrifice and eating of the lamb at Pesach was the killing and eating of the false god of Egypt to show allegiance to the real God. The continuation of the Paschal lamb sacrifice is an eternal remembrance of that deliverance from idolatry and slavery. This is why no uncircumcised male or Gentile could partake of the Paschal lamb. In the days of the Temple it was also clear it never represented a sin sacrifice to the Jewish people at any time because they are entirely different methods for sacrificing a lamb for a sin sacrifice and the lamb for the Passover. So, it should be clear after reading the Exodus from Torah , Jesus has nothing to do with the Passover lamb.  If you insist on equating Jesus with the Pascal lamb, in truth you would be equating him to a false god of Egypt. I sincerely doubt that is the intent as Christians view Jesus as a sin offering.<br>  Christianity does NOT get to redefine Passover for the Jewish people who still observe it as commanded. Deuteronomy Chapter 4 verse 2. Do not add to the word which I command you, nor diminish from it, to observe the commandments of the Lord your God which I command you.Non Jews are  are welcome to attend any synagogue's open community seder. ( Reform)  Without the Temple we no longer make the sacrifice of the Paschal lamb and eat it so that command (no gentile may eat of it) is not broken. 12:42 There was a night of vigil for God, [preparing] to bring them out of Egypt. This night remains for the Israelites a vigil to God for all generations<br>  12:43 God said to Moses and Aaron, 'This is the law of the Passover sacrifice: <br>  'No outsider may eat it. <br>  12:44 If a man buys a slave for cash and circumcises him, then [the slave] can eat it. <br>  12:45 [But if a gentile is] a temporary resident or a hired hand, he may not eat [the Passover sacrifice]. <br>  12:46 'It must be eaten by a single group. Do not bring any of its meat out of the group. Do not break any of its bones. <br>  12:47 'The entire community of Israel must keep [this ritual]. <br>  12:48 When a proselyte joins you and wants to offer the Passover sacrifice to God, every male [in his household] must be circumcised. He may then join in the observance, and be like a native-born [Israelite]. But no uncircumcised man may eat [the sacrifice]. <br>  12:49 The same law shall apply both for the native-born [Israelite] and for the proselyte who joins you.' <br>  Now, we have a bone representing the lamb on the plate. I have had non-Jewish friends attend many seders at my home in the past and they find that learning the Torah meaning is very powerful in its messages. <br>  Shalom|`|38vza5Gxaa	answer: G-d, that is disgusting.

That is why the world is in the shape it's in.  If they had repented and asked to be forgiven or even one of them had repented, we wouldn't have been born because the earth would have been filled to a comfortable level long before we were born. So, I guess, it was a good thing where we are concerned but bad for the world as a whole.  Soon, God will finish making the world a paradise by destroying the effects of Adam and Eves sin.

Then each of them did another badie and tried to push the blame off on the other one.  I am sure when they realized the full extent of the punishment they were sorry or sorry that they were being punished at least.  Unfortunately the sin corrupted their spirit and inclined them toward sin and it resulted in the corruption of their vehicle of travel: their bodies which then became consigned to corruption too which is death and decay.  These things were caused by their actions and is what they would and did hand down to all of their offspring...but if I know humanbeings, they did not consider the consequences of what would happen and they did not stop and contemplate their punishment a whole lot until they started planting and hoeing and giving birth in pain.  It probably did not even put an arrow in their hearts toward true sorrow (different than remorse) until they realized Cain killed Abel and somewhat fully realized what the world was becoming.  <br>  Would a fig leaf have been sufficient, not by any standard!|`|e98866b085ffa2485ad7691411d0206caa	Well, "sorry" did not do it... they did.

The Genesis account shows the Eve blamed the serpent and Adam blamed God himself by saying "the woman whom You gave me..." (see Genesis 3 & 4). Because they were now to be put outside the garden where hard work would be required to continue living, God made the provision of clothing (not fig leaves)  Genesis 3:21 says?"And Jehovah God proceeded to make long garments of skin for Adam and for his wife and to clothe them."

It is hard to go from sexy ads and dresses that are so low cut that the women need two sided tape to keep from falling out, to seeing a woman naturally feeding her baby. We just need to grow up. It seems as if we can all make it easier on everybody if a woman who wants to breast fed just covers up a bit. <br>  Thirty years ago, I saw how Japanese stores made little comfy corners along the stairways so that mothers could sit and feed the babies in comfort. <br>  People here need a reality check- breasts are for the babies. Regretfully, our puritanical background/sex obsessed society makes breast feeding over bottle feeding more challenging. I understand a man making a comment, but women!!

Babies need to eat, too, and it is far from easy to predict when.<br>  <br>  Am I uncomfortable when I see a woman breastfeeding?  Truthfully a little.  And I breastfed my babies.

I think restrictions on women breastfeeding in public are a horrible thing - they discourage women from breastfeeding by making it more difficult for them and thereby put their children's health at risk. Fortunately, though, lawmakers seem to be getting on the right side of this issue as of late. See: <a href="http://www.boston.com/news/local/rhode_island/articles/2009/02/28/ri_moms_get_right_to_breast_feed_in_public/" rel="nofollow">http://www.boston.com/news/local/rhode_i...</a><br>  <br>  Also, I'm pretty confused by people who say breastfeeding disgusts them.

Should mothers perch upon the toilet and hide in shame because their babies need to eat?  Or maybe they should go out into cold/hot cars? I find far more disgusting acts in restaurants than a mother breastfeeding.  Grow up already.|`|MMF1YmZZaa	I plan on breastfeeding and doing it discreetly in public. I think there is absolutely nothing wrong with it. However, I was at an indoor mall last week and this woman was just sitting there with her breast hanging out and her baby was asleep. It was as if she didn't realize her baby wasn't still attached and I had my eleven year old niece with me and she was a little freaked out and embarrassed I think. Then I saw a young woman sitting on the ground in front of a movie theater smoking a cigarette and smoking. The only thought in my mind was TRASHY. And I smoke and it still baffled me.<br>  <br>  So, I think it really depends on the way you carry yourself and behave while doing it. <br>  <br>  :)<br>  <br>  **EDIT-Excuse me I meant to say smoking a cigarette and breastfeeding.|`|F2wI6NGNaa	to the people who say breastfeeding women should do it in private why dont you go somewhere private obviously your perverts or it would not be an issue get therapy seriously|`|AA11209831	Only when the babies head is in the way and blocking my view.|`|uSmT8O4Gaa	Americans have a hard time with this subject. It is not common to do, yet it is natural, boobs produce milk for the baby.<br>  <br>  The people who like to breast feed, should do so. You don't have to do it openly. A quite place would do, or cover the sucking baby and the breast with a light cloth. <br>  <br>  If done discrete you really need to look twice to know what is going on and yet hardly see anything of the boob. <br>  <br>  To be honest, Saturday nights, on the beach and in tight shirts you see more from the boobs compared to breast feeding.<br>  <br>  And to all the disgusted people, look the other way. Or look at your dog....|`|7MtjF084aa	I find it beautiful. It is a beautiful thing, mother and infant in natures most natural and pure stage, the baby is gaining all its most vital nutrients and it obviously shows the mothers love for the baby and the bond they must share...<br>  <br>  Edit: i do feel that they could use a blanket to cover up for those who feel uncomfortable|`|57LFRfqCaa	I don't find it rude at all. I don't think I have ever seen a woman breastfeed without being discreet.  It is the most natural thing in the world.  It seems rather strange that people have issues with breastfeeding in public but don't seem to worry about women showing their breasts in a sexual way.|`|8ae9CGqcaa	NO.<br>  The only way I would be offended is if she stood up and started waving her breasts in my husbands face. Or in someones face.<br>  That would be rude. And highly unlikely. <br>  I think it's perfectly natural to nurse in public. If your baby is hungry, they're hungry. It would be rude to deny them, just because strange people are getting offended.|`|2E74C4gpaa	It's part of motherhood and it's natural.  Plus, it's nobody's business, and maybe you should mind your own business too. If they are covering up then that's ok.|`|Qc3U9Vquaa	Breastfeeding is the natural way of feeding infants.

I have no problem with public breast feeding as long as it's done discretely.|`|bRLCxmP6aa	I think breastfeeding is the most natural thing in the world, so I'm always amazed by the trouble people have with it. I don't think it's rude at all, and I'm not entirely sure that people are troubled by the "rudeness" as much as they just can't deal with breasts in a non-sexualized way. <br>  <br>  About ten years ago, I remember hearing a news story about a woman in Connecticut who was arrested for public nudity because she was breastfeeding her baby in her car behind a shopping center.<br>  <br>  I nursed my son (who is now 12) for 14 months, in the face of some really unpleasant criticism. My own father was so freaked out by the idea that he couldn't even be in the same house with me if he knew I was feeding the baby. My ex in-laws were so opposed to my nursing that they complained (a lot) to my ex-husband, said that it was creepy, and mocked me about it, calling me a hippie chick, among other, nastier names.<br>  <br>  Their attitudes completely mystified me then...and mystify me to this day. I mean, that's what breasts are for.|`|R2iCzRjsaa	Yes, I admit I do, even though it is natural.  I do not find it rude if they use a blanket and the breast isn't waved publicly around the room.  I have seen both in public,  the very subtle, and the "hey look at me" types.  I go for subtle.|`|kL8BzsBNaa	Not at all if you at least make an effort to cover up. Sometimes if you cant then people shouldnt care anyways. You covering up is just showing that youre trying to be respectful but you dont owe anybody anything from breastfeeding.

Due to the fact that we are free will entities, god can't just MAKE us perfect. We have to choose to walk this path, and need to become what we wish to become. This world has become spiritually deprived, and therefore, many people are spiritually immature and low on morality. This is why so many people are so sinful, and people "shake their fists" at god. They do not understand much of what is going on around them. It is important to remember that everything has it's purpose, and this is all for the greater good. We as individuals just need to focus on what we truly want, and walk this path with a sense of humility, especially if you choose to grow and learn.|`|IzhKZfsMaa	I for one am thankful for the agency God gave me.

But the allure is great!  I am thankful for the sacrifices of Jesus, but I have questioned God many times ... why did He allow sin to enter the world.  WHY?  I'm not sure that rises to the level of shaking my fist at God, but I hate that by doing what comes so natural to me that I disappoint and even anger God.

Now I might never know about where I came from and who my ancestors are. <br>  <br>  So, yeah. That makes me mad.<br>  <br>  <br>  Edit:<br>  It's not racist. At f*cking all. God, it's like only white people can be racist. If I were black I'd wear it with pride and tell you all to shove it. It represents Southerners and the Southern states, not pride that we enforced slavery like, 200 years ago ! Jesus. You'd think people could just move on and get over it by now. Black people have many holidays and even their own month, along with colleges and scholarships and even more things, alright ? I don't really see any other race with that, so be happy, right ? <br>  <br>  <br>  I honestly don't even care if you give me thumbs down either, because I'm not racist.

The caucasian felt that if the African Americans can wear hip hop clothes than they have a right to wear tee shirts with the confederate flag on it.  There is more to this article but i thought you should know a little of what i read.  If wearing a tee shirt with the confederate flag on it is racist then i say do not allow these student to wear it.  If you let African Americans students wear hip hop clothing than you should let caucasian wear  tee shirts with the confederate flag on it.  All of the students should have the same set of rules.  You should ask a friend who you feel more comfortable with to explain the meaning of a southern thing.

The flag itself is a symbol of racism, and it represents a separatist movement.  That movement is based off of the reconstruction period before the civil war took place.  Basically the flag represents a division in the country or a separate union.  It has more recently been used as a symbol of racism in the south.  It has been shunned by most in the nation but there are those in the south that still use it to show their feelings about how they perceive the union to be.  So I think you need to understand the meaning of the flag itself.  Now I feel I have given you some background on the flag itself, but feel free to look up more information.  Once you have done so, you have to decide for yourself if it is a symbol that you will simply pass of or if you will reject it.  The choice is yours.  I would think many who know it to be a racist symbol would reject it, but again its up to you.

It should be a purely religious/cultural institution, and "civil unions" should replace it as the legal equivalent for both heterosexual and homosexual couplings.  If marriage is, at least in part, a religious matter, then government intervention a church's decision about who or who not to wed is a violation of the first amendment of the Constitution.<br>  <br>  However, so long as government is in the marriage business, homosexuals should have the right to marry and call it marriage ... for the same reason minority racial/ethnic groups have all of the rights and privileges of citizenship as whites, and are called "citizens" instead of some other term denoting a "separate but equal" status.|`|G7a2lhvDaa	If a list was produced showing all the legal benefits that 'married' people receive, and all of those benefits were put into 'civil unioned' people, then I would be okay with it.

I don't care what it's called, so long as there are equal rights.<br>  <br>  They have civil unions in most European countries and they're ok with it, so I don't see why we shouldn't be ok with it here in the US (but again, only if it provides the same rights as marriage). I personally believe that a lot of LGBT Americans are so set on ONLY having gay "marriage" is because they have gay "marriage" in Canada, Massachusetts and Connecticut, so because those places are so close to the US (and obviously MA and CT are IN the US) it influences what LGBT people here want. There is also a belief amoung many LGBT Americans that civil unions do not provide the same rights as marriage. Civil unions can provide the same rights as marriage if the government allows for that.|`|72iZuDjeaa	that's like segregation was in the 50's and 60's... separate but equal doesn't cut it... if you have to put a name on it, then put a name on hetero marriage too... i like "same sex marriage" and "non same sex marraige"... ssm and nssm respectively|`|uky2nsh8aa	hell no. i don't want a "domestic partner" i want her to be my wife. <br>  i'm no less than a straight person, hell, i'm more and better than a straight person, so give me equal rights like i'm suppose to be guaranteed.|`|N73oZyY8aa	It depends upon the legalities of the whole thing.

zHmZkMStaa	I starred you!  I never thought of Darwin that way, but I think you're absolutely right.  I can't think of anything more liberating than being freed from a sense of indebtedness to a mythological 'creator'.  :)  It liberates us to spend more time and energy on helping others rather than paying homage to something or a deity that doesn't exist, nor have any purpose FOR existing.|`|3af30c08175e2bc96bcd85540e09d175aa	Einstein's Theory of Relativity?<br>  <br>  It depends on what you are thinking of when talking about "liberation."

This is a more fundamental liberation, in terms of revolutionizing science, but didn't involve any liberation from religion, if that is what you are getting at.|`|wlhMUwKsaa	Galileo was actually the first scientist to go against religions.

cbaed0814556c039d6513bbe51d35768aa	Yes, I have ruminated on the basic concept you are trying to apprehend and I reflected that my Jewish aunt converted to Catholicism, my Lutheran uncle converted to 7th Day Adventist, my Muslim friend to Mormonism-how are those for just a few major changes in people's spirituality?  As I continued to reflect, I assessed that I have read The 7 Doors, The Egyptian Book of the Dead, The Tibetian Book of the Dead, the I-ching, Sepher Zetzerriah, the Quaran, Cosmic Consciousness, and a host of other books including the Bible.  <br>  There are many converts in many religions and countries to religions other than the one they are brought up around.  There are I am sure alot of reasons they convert also.  My purpose was to go to the oldest religious texts which include things like mythrism, and even mystery religions of the Ancients working my way forward to see what any of them have in common and that includes works on Shintoism and alot of other things that do not overlook Native American and Native African beliefs-everything I could get my hands on until I worked myself up to the present day world religions.  I wanted to know if, and if so, how they might be similar and what each held as truth and so forth.   From there I evaluated so that I would not be blindly following any teaching.  Since I did that here in America, I would presume my interest would be the same if I were born anywhere else as well.  So yes, I could very well have been born in another country with another belief tag passed down to me, but we are who we are spiritually and physically as well as psychologically so I tend to believe I would have investigated in that case also.  I investigated, I chose.  I don't say everyone has to do that or that everyone or even anyone has to make the same choice I did, but I did and I am who I am.  I was not cohersed, entreated, or even encouraged, infact I was discouraged or told not to do that.  I did it anyway because it made sense to me to investigate before I turned the heart of my immortal soul to any permanent direction. I hope that answered your question.  It is a very good question.|`|AA11278078	If Pat Robertson had been born in Iran, he would be the Ayatolah.|`|db3c0b60279d332ad6709459688ec650aa	I'd be in Hollywood or Bollywood then, and live an aimless life, become an atheist, get hooked on to drugs, change my sexual orientation, live like an animal...you get the drift. And, after doing all that, I'll still think I'm correct amd that I'm living a "happy" life. That's a scary thought...<br>  <br>  I'm so glad I was born a Muslim, and if I could do it again, I'll still want to be born a Muslim, but the country of birth is immaterial to me. If I was born as anything else, it would take a lot of courage from me to become a Muslim. This is why I admire all those people who embrace Islam even after being born into a nonMuslim family. I think it's very big of them!<br>  <br>  But, I don't think low or bad of anybody else. Just because others don't think the way I do, it doesn't mean that they are inferior or superior to me in any way. This is just my own view. And this is my preferance.

Try being a widow in Africa, Black, no job, no shelter, no money, no food, with HIV/Aids, five hungry children..most with disease and starving...and a wardrobe of one piece of cloth to cover your body...  If you're not getting my point...no matter 'how bad' we think it is right now...it could very well be MUCH WORSE...  Be thankful for what little you have and try to make life a little easier for someone else...that, in the end, is what it's all about...  Happiness is in giving not taking...  Try it, and you'll see...  Volunteer some of your time at your local hospital, hospice, library, church, police station, etc...  Helping others will make your life much richer...|`|g6cUQFuCaa	i talk to people online and listen to their life and problems and if im realy depressed i walk out a block from my house look at the sky and try and figure things out<br>  and if im even more depressed than that i sneak a smoke to make me feel better|`|LURqbzoZaa	Listen to music, hold my dog, think about happy things.

lprYy9RGaa	No the oldest surviving city is in Iraq, the oldest surviving religion would not come from Mesopotamia when the place was entire nation, that existed near Persia. That place doesn't exist anymore, It was taken over by Alexander the Great. Rome ruled the entire area for 450 years.<br>  So, Hinduism was not in that area, nor did it ever exist there. India was in another Continent altogether, far removed from Iraq, Iran, Sudan, Persia, Egypt. Rome eventually took over India for a short time, but that was during the latter part of Roman rule was for about five years or there abouts. Hinduism may claim to be the oldest religion, but there are those that would argue that point.

They are clearly all different from one another. <br>  <br>  Many people assume that Atheists are immoral persons because they do not have any reason to be moral...which is the opposite.  Most Atheists are humanists. The majority of the Atheists that I am affiliated with are excellent, loving, and generous human beings and quiet honestly are some of the best companions because they never brings religion to the table for discussion (unless you get one of the crazies or bring it yourself). They serve the world for a logical, scientific purpose that gives us different point of views and I appreciate all of that. I believe God loves them, regardless if they know that God may exist or not. <br>  <br>  Many Agnostics are confused as Atheists...more or less, an Agnostic needs hard proof that a God(s) exist rather than being told. In most cases they may have not received an enlightening moment in their life where the truth becomes clear to them.  Most Agnostics live inbetween religion, nontheism, and spirituality...trying to find their way on their own. This serves a great purpose because these people may appear to be confused but really just do not want people telling them "what is right and wrong" they choose to discover this on their own. <br>  <br>  Satan was a fallen angel.  The only Satanist I knew was just into Satan as someone was into God.  He didn't plan to harm people, he didn't plan to torture babies or drink blood. He just had a different religion and was a different kind of person.  He too brough an excellent perspective to people around him.  <br>  <br>  All religions, cultures, and societies have their uses.

AA11632370	I don't know why the world is silent on these very unfortunate Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh coming from Burma (Myanmar). My brother was in the Bangladesh Rifles as sector commander of that area (Chittagong) and we came to know about the miserable lives these people are living whom the Burmese Border Guards (NASAKA) would treat like the Gestapo (Nazi secret police). Last month we saw how these people were treated by the Thailand government when they were trying to flee from refugee camps of Chittagong in small engine-driven boats and were caught by the Thai Navy who took away the engines and towed the dumb-boats in the Bay of Bengal and left them at the mercy of the nature. Many perished and some remained to tell the world what cruelty they underwent.<br>  <br>  I got the following (abridged) from internet search:<br>  <br>  Rohingya: Burma’s Forgotten Minority<br>  Thu, 12/18/2008 - 02:00<br>  <br>  The Rohingya are a Muslim population from western Burma.  Numbering almost two million, they are concentrated in just three townships located along the Burmese-Bangladeshi border, known as Northern Rakhine State (NRS).<br>  <br>  Conquered by the Burmese in the early nineteenth century, the Rohingya and their Rakhine Buddhist co-nationals have been treated more like a subjugated minority than as members of Burmese society.  In 1982, the Burmese government stripped the Rohingya of their citizenship, formally codifying an ongoing campaign to encourage them to leave the country.<br>  <br>  Bangladesh: Promote Self-Sufficiency for All Rohingya: While the Bangladeshi government allows UNHCR and implementing partners to assist the 28,000 Rohingya who live in official camps, it prevents the international community from accessing unrecognized refugees. This has led to serious gaps in basic services and protection for some 200,000 people.  Though the first large-scale movement of the Rohingya into Bangladesh dates to 1978, most current refugees moved to Bangladesh in 1991-92 in response to a Burmese offensive in NRS.<br>  <br>  Malaysia:  Stop the Abuse of Refugees: Malaysia does not recognize refugees seeking protection in its country.  As a result the Rohingya, like other refugees in Malaysia, are targeted by immigration authorities and Rela, a volunteer corps charged with arresting illegal migrants.  There has been a sharp increase in arrests, detentions, and deportations of refugees in recent years, including UNHCR registration card holders.  Refugee women and children are also vulnerable to arrest and detention.<br>  <br>  UNHCR continues to have difficulty accessing detention centers to secure the release of registered refugees and asylum seekers. Detention conditions are substandard, and detainee abuses have risen since Rela was given the contract to provide security in these facilities in early 2008.<br>  <br>  --<br>  <br>  Our sympathy are with these people and hope the USA would put pressure on Burmese government to treat their citizen, particularly the Rohingya, without any discrimination for their being Muslims.|`|AA11374158	New Zealand has a refugee quota of about 800 a year.

They cannot receive the certain benefits of marriage as straight people do, and that is technically discrimination. You can research this and get a lot of facts, not just ranting lol.

Blast the ridiculous teeny boppers and their self-centered ridiculous questions to the point that they go off and stomp their itty-bitty foot, and finally give up on playing with the adults here.<br>  <br>  I think most of the Answerers are too gullible, however, to even see through many of these questions!  They take Lord Dork as the real McCoy, they believe outrageous tales of woe, repeated month and month by spinster, half-crazed 37 yr old women using fecal-based nick-names.  In many cases all you have to do is check their history....lots of these dopes don't even make their questions and answers private!!<br>  <br>  And as far as lying....ask what to tell your neighbor, mother, church, etc., about why you don't want to do something, and 1/2 the suggestions are lies.  This site is HALF filled with lies and liars.<br>  <br>  Guess we just have to put on our big boy and girl pants and panties and weed through the crapola, right?<br>  <br>  Additional to Arcanum:   I was also accused of making her ten year old daughter cry, then she said she was using the child's account.  So I copy and pasted, and reported, as they are supposed to be 12 at least.  She did not tell me why the child supposedly cried...probably figured out her mama is a nut.|`|oEfnqmp3aa	There is a lot of honesty on Y!A, certainly outweighing that observation.<br>  <br>  For one, why is your example something that bothers you? The information in the answers in Question A are the answers in Question A. Likewise for Question B. The questions and answers themselves are mutually exclusive. The user herself is not a person to worry about.<br>  <br>  It is done to attain specific information. Lying in questions should be of little concern as there is not any credible human interaction and no relationship or maintained knowledge of the person. Lying in answers on the other hand is not a concern on the account that it doesn't happen, or if it does then there's many other honest answers present to observe.<br>  <br>  On other websites I may ask a question I already know the answer to, so as to make publicly available the information conveyed by that particular Q&A. I would strategically word it to suitably match what someone else would be thinking if they had the question, while wording it to make it easier for the answerer to give the intended reliable information. It is purely for the benefit of others.|`|AA11209831	Some broad named sam or something like that keeps doing that here.  She posted a question in this section about why is proper grammar and spelling so important.

She has since been claiming that that was her 10 year old daughter and that I made her cry, but, she has done this to other people to and she likes to follow to other questions I answer and just insult me in her answer.<br>  <br>  I actually find it more amusing than anything else.

5AbCtkWFaa	Take a deep breath, honey, and relax.  I personally think there is absolutely nothing wrong or immoral with two people having a consensual sexual relationship.  If there is a god, I can imagine many, many more things he would disapprove of more besides your intimacy with your fiance and your not going to church.<br>  <br>  Being in college and having a significant other in the military has got to be stressful, and I think your religion is adding to that by making you afraid and wracked with guilt.  If you are depressed, you might want to contact your university's health services; they may be able to offer you secular counseling.<br>  <br>  Of course, I'm an agnostic, and if you read my answers, you will know I have a very low opinion of organized religion.  Your question is another reason for me to dislike it.<br>  <br>  Nobody knows what happens when we die.  I don't know if there is a heaven or a hell.  Maybe your soul, such as it is, goes into the hearts and minds of those who loved you.  Maybe the soul is just the name we give to what animates us.<br>  <br>  Please try not to worry about heaven or hell--I know it's easier said than done--but hopefully you have many, many more years of life to live, and you should concentrate on living them to the fullest.|`|AA12330575	Go to the library and check out a copy of 'There is a River' by Thomas Sugrue.

Stay close to God, be good to your family and friends, and yes, continually ask for forgiveness for the bad things. God is all forgiving, all loving, and I think with God in your life, you're heart and soul will be saved when your times come. Don't spend your life worrying. Religions are all different, and to be completely honest,  I don't know which religion is closest to the divine truth. I was raised Catholic, but even being Catholic, there are many things about it I don't agree with. But it's not about what the Catholics believe, it's what I believe.

John 14:6 "I am the way, and the truth, and the life. The only way to the Father is through me." <br>  being a good person and doing good works doesn't get you into heaven.

Your his and he wont give up on you, even when you give up on your self. Personally im not about "religion" im about "relationship" and God is too. You dont have to be perfect to get into heaven, because thats impossible. This is a tough question because God does love everyone, but theres a hell because Heaven is a place for those who have committed to God and try everyday to live according to his word and how he asks us too, and yeah, your going to screw up, over and over and over, but the thing is God dosnt only look at our sin. When Jesus died for us ALL of our sins were forgiven, even the sins youll commit 10 years from now. Yesterday i went through Romans 8 with my youth group, you should read it, it really helps put things in perspective.|`|q1NGyaBraa	talk to someone in your church maybe, i personally dont belive but i have a lot of respect for people that do and i think it would be ok in gods eyes if u make love to your fiance you are going to get married its nit like your picking up randoms dont stress so much just relax i dont think god would send someone to hell for the little thngs especially if you care so much about his opinion.|`|rubWH1S1aa	Religion has always been a form of social control. Stop letting people who dont agree with your actions judge you and have control over you with their fiction. You being afraid of going to hell, is no different then a mother telling a child to eat all his vegetables or the jolly green giant is going to beat him.<br>  <br>  Most religions in their teachings hold important lessons about human nature, and how we should treat one another, and look at the world around us. While its all good and great, shouldn't you want to be a good person, be a decent human being, who is proud of herself because you have lived by your believes, as opposed to being afraid of punishment. If you live your life guided by fear of judgement and punishment, what have you learned. It should be your conscience and your values alone that guide you.|`|y2g84roSaa	You say that accepting Jesus alone won't save you, but really that's all it takes. Maybe you will find some answers if your re-prioritize your life and make Him no. 1 over everything else. I am sure there is a church service out there that would work for you. Sin is equal in God's eyes. So it's your thought that if someone dies before having the opportunity to repent, they are going to hell? Christ's death on the cross brought forgiveness. His forgiveness isn't conditional. You will also find more answers in the Bible than on Y!A.|`|xo4iux9gaa	if you are a born again Christian you should not fear hell because you will never be there.|`|UinOWcMUaa	The bible say's draw nearer to Him -- and He will draw nearer to you !

Therefore, the Antichrist will arise from among the geographic and ethnic descendants of the Roman Empire. Barack Obama does not fit this profile.

Not in the sense that you believe him to at least. Religion is nothing more than the corrupt brainwashing you to believe whatever the heck they want you to and to behave in the way that benefits them the most. <br>  <br>  How many people have been killed in the name of god?? At the hands of church officials themselves?? Countless were murdered by Christianity officials for going against what the church was teaching. The world is ROUND, the earth revolves around the SUN, lightening is attracted to METAL. People were viciously murdered for claiming these things to be true, things we KNOW today are indeed real. But did the church care if the things being claimed were true or not? NO, they killed those speaking against 'god' and going against what the church thought was the truth because they are after nothing more than power.<br>  <br>  Organized religion serves to detach the species from the natural world, and likewise, each other. It supports blind submission to authority. It reduces human responsibility to the effect that "God" controls everything, and in turn awful crimes can be justified in the name of Divine Pursuit. And most importantly, it empowers those who know the truth but use the myth to manipulate and control societies. The religious myth is the most powerful device ever created, and serves as the psychological soil upon which other myths can flourish.<br>  <br>  As a species we are bound to question everything. We need to feel as if we are here on earth for a reason, not just to live out our 70-100 years and then turn into fertilizer. Hence we created the religious myth. It goes back hundreds of thousands of years. What makes you think your Christan god is any more real than the ancient Egyptian gods? The Greek gods? Roman? Pagan? etc etc. <br>  <br>  Have a look at this award winning video: Zeitgeist, The Movie; and it will prove to you, in plain English that religion is nothing more than a myth. <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-1817848131611744924" rel="nofollow">http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=...</a><br>  <br>  So no, you have not betrayed 'god' by voting for Obama simply because 'god' does not exist in the first place.|`|2UOpbWqlaa	if you feel you've made a mistake,  learn from it and move on.  if you're a christian or a jew you'll come to understand that God is slow to anger and he loves you more than you can imagine.  besides,  i'll bet he already knew who the president was gonna be.  but if you just can't live with you're decision to vote for B.O.

99C4rNpGaa	Ok I took chinese for about 2 and a half years and now in my first year of japanese so I can understand where your coming from. I think from my opinion, Japanese is much easier to learn than chinese, mostly because it is mostly comprised of hirigana, and you actually have an alphabet to write with. Unlike chinese you actually have to memorize lots and lots of chinese characters. Though, once you get the hang of memorization and the pronounciations of chinese, you start to get the drift and it gets easier for you to learn. So right now after taking chinese and starting japanese, I find it easy because of their similarities. For example how japanese have the same kanji characters as chinese. So if you know both, more power to ya. I think the most difficult part of both language is learning to write the kanji (chinese characters).|`|wGXY1FTkaa	<a href="http://japonais.japanese.free.fr/index.php" rel="nofollow">http://japonais.japanese.free.fr/index.p...</a><br>  <a href="http://chinois.chinese.free.fr/index.php" rel="nofollow">http://chinois.chinese.free.fr/index.php</a>|`|t9ZiEJYfaa	From my personal experience, I find grammar in Japanese hard because it's very counter-intuitive.<br>  <br>  In Chinese, the grammar is the easy part. The hard part are definitely the characters, you have got to familiarize yourself with it. Every character is like a brick, the more you learn the better your foundation. In addition, they are 4 tones in spoken Chinese which is hard for people to get used to.|`|iQ13PoEiaa	it's more like what AREN'T the difficulties of learning Japanese and Chinese.

But even they are not that strong.|`|4LQajleJaa	Okay, here is what I think most likely happened.<br>  <br>   So this guy named... Bob he's walking down the street. suddenly out of nowhere a science chemical carrying truck crashes knocking Bob a couple feet backwards with a wave of green liquid goo. after a couple of hours Bob wakes up but he is surrounded by an egg made of that same goo. Bob rips oped his egg, and is reborn as a town super hero. So a few weeks later Bob is fighting a giant monster, and gets knocked down to your street causing the side walk to burst a little.<br>  <br>  Or it could have been that water got into a crack in the side walk over winter, and froze, and thawed, and froze, and thawed over, and over again until it ripped open that crack into the huge one you saw.

It's not for you to understand the idle chatter of teenagers.|`|B1gHA0MAaa	Well, I'm not the smartest person in the world but my take on it is that many African Americans had a lot of hostility toward the whites and would have preferred to keep things separate.

But what went on in the 1960's and 1970's in West Englewood and Marquette Park in Chicago did not result in integrated neighborhoods. And school busing just made whites who could afford to to send their children to private schools.)|`|ZbzgckTNaa	because they love to scream racism|`|wOA2Mf6Naa	It was forced upon the whites (the unwilling ones).

NWa45ZDIaa	I think if you believe in all the false lies that mainstream religion has spewed off about hell, then yes, your version would make more sense. However, that is NOT the Bibles teaching of what Hell is, not your version or the misleading scare tactics about it being a place of torment for sinners that the Devil rules over torturing souls. Do you know that the Bible spoke of disgusting people who sacrificed children in fire? Do you know God said that doing this was detestable to him? (Jeremiah 32:35 "Furthermore, they built the high places of Ba′al... in order to make their sons and their daughters pass through the fire to Mo′lech, a thing that I did not command them, neither did it come up into my heart to do this detestable thing.") God is a loving father, why would any loving parent want their children to suffer or be tormented, even if they were "bad" or "sinful"? NO mentally stable parent would do this. Neither would God. Its sickening for people to think God would ever do such a thing.|`|wR1XyyrUaa	Thats probably exactly what happened, but lies and rumors were spread about it to make people think it was a horrible place that no one would|`|806025c44dd8e27b6c1d544348b087c0aa	"Most funnest?"<br>  <br>  And, into which of the gods' faces would you be rubbing it?

(I've often wondered why this teaching didn't make homosexuality okay, but I figure most Christians would get pissed off if I asked them that.) Also, Christians in general seem to think they can just ignore whatever bits of the Old Testament they don't like while forcing everyone to obey and believe in the parts they do. For example, most Christians consider homosexuality an abomination, but have no problem with eating shellfish, even though the Old Testament laws imply that those who eat shellfish are just as much an abomination to God as homosexuals. They sometimes argue that this is because homosexuality is forbidden in the epistles of Paul, but Paul also says women should be forbidden from speaking in Church.<br>  <br>  In short, it's because, while every denomination of Christianity claims to obey and believe the Bible in its fullness, not one of them comes anywhere remotely close to doing so.|`|RgceFQ9Caa	The prohibition against pork has never been rescinded for anyone claiming to be a follower of the Creator God.

EBGdlo35aa	1) Bible Question, should we hold certain people in our lives in a higher regard than others,?<br>  <br>  There is no prohibition against it, and there is the command to obey the laws of those who rule over us - by projection, meaning that those who rule over us must be held in higher regard than others (because we do NOT have to obey others).<br>  <br>  <br>  2) Is that the same thing or something totally dofferent?<br>  <br>  It's the same thing - but you are not God.  Sure, God loves her as much as he loves, well, Osama bin Laden.  That doesn't mean that *you* should love Osama bin Laden as much as you love her.  It also doesn't mean that you should love her sister and her mother as much as you love her.  The bible does not tell us to love all equally - and, for example, strongly encourages loving your wife more than other women.<br>  <br>  <br>  Jim, <a href="http://www.bible-reviews.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.bible-reviews.com</a>|`|VRl1jENHaa	She was comparing an apple to an orange.

PiWYjEQ9aa	I grew up in India and immigrated to Chicago few months back with my parents. I had to leave my girlfriend (who lived in the house right across my house) in India and she was heartbroken. She didn't want me to leave and said she would kill herself if I left. I thought she probably isn't serious so I ignored and said we could still be friends and stuff. And I was never in love with her as much as she was and I thought once I left, she would get over me. <br>  <br>  About one month after I came in chicago, I had the most horrible dream  of my life. It starts really spooky as I find myself in my old neighborhood in india but the thing I notice right away is that there is no one around and by some weird instinct, I go into my girlfriend's house.. and there is no one in living room and the whole house seems empty.. i walk up to my gf's bedroom and it's really dark so I turn the light on.. and what I see scares the **** out of me..  I see my gf hanging from the ceiling fan.. I try to scream as hard as I can but I seem to have lost my voice and nothing comes out.. and I try to run out  of room.. but I find that the door that I entered thru has disappeared and  just when I thought it couldn't get any scarier and creepier.. I look back at my dead girlfriend scarily and she opens her eyes and screams at me really loudly.. ( I don't remember what she said tho) and then my dream ends there.. for few seconds, I couldn't even move my hands or legs and I was so scared that I think for the first time in my life, I couldn't go to sleep for next 78 hrs..<br>  <br>  And the creepiest part is that next morning, I call my girlfriend's house in India and found out that she had committed suicide by hangin herself just three hrs before I had the dream and that she had went into severe depression after I left India and had already tried committing suicide two times just in that month but had survived. <br>  <br>  This scared the **** outta me and it still does when I think about it. I've had the exact same dream three times now and you can safely assume that I haven't been able to enjoy my life since then and have been seeing psychiatrist too.<br>  <br>  Wish me luck!.. :(|`|psVbIAF6aa	ok i will tell you wat has happend to me inovolving ghosts. none of this is made up.<br>  <br>  once me my mum, my mums friend and her daughter were sitting a the table talking about stuff. and then i felt that a spirit had come into the room(some times i get that feeling so i just ignored it). mum and her friend started talking about thier friend who had passed away recentaly and then i felt some one start rubbing my left leg. i look under under the table to see if it was my lil' sis but there was no one under the table.so i just pretended it didnt happen (blaming it on my imagination) less then a miniute later i felt some one rubbing my leg again and i look under the table again but there was nothing so by that time i knew it was the spirit. then it started again but it didnt stop even when i crossed my legs sting on the chair. it went on 4 about ten minutes then i got up walt into the kitchen and walked back and sat down and it started again. by this time i was shaking. and then suddnley i had an idea i asked mum and her friend if thier dead friend ever like rubbing peoples legs or getting hers rubbed and then looked at my funny and said she loved getting her legs rubbeb expecualy her left cause it sometimes got sore and as soon as i asked that i stopped! <br>  <br>  once i turned the lights off ready to go to bed ilaydown in bed closed my eyes for a few seconds and the i just knew that there was sumthing in the coner off my room so i opend my eyes and sure enough standing in the coner of my room was a black figure. i stared at it for 10 seconds to see if it was just my imagination but it didnt go away. by this time i was freecking out. so i closed my eyes.reached for my phone on my bedside table and open it and shone the light in the coner and i it was gone<br>  <br>  a nother night i woke up and got up to get a drink (it was about 1:30 at night) and it was pretty much pitch black and i got this really weird feeling that there was something in the hallway connected to the kitchen so i slowly open the fridge door and the light from it passed over a kid in the hallway it was only there for i split Second but i looked like a boy about 9 or 10 years old. i only got a quick look at the face. it wasn't like a white floating figure it look like a normal human just very pale<br>  <br>  hear are some other things that happen to me<br>  <br>  i hear footsteps walking towards my bedroom at night when every1 is asleep. i hear chairs moving when i am the only one home. my dog barks at nothing (that i can see or any one else). i here heavy breathing outside my bed room. i always see shadows moving out the corner of my eyes. i sit in chairs that a warm but nobody sat in them for hours. radios turn on for no reason. i get cold in sum parts of the minutes or a few minutese and them i get warm again. i get the feeling someones watching me.once<br>  <br>  i walked into my bed room and it was dark and i saw a black figure standing up against the back wall but as soon as i turned to the light on it was gone. <br>  <br>  and another time in the middle of the night and got up to go to the toilet and i saw a white figure standing in the hall but as soon as i look at it disappeared.<br>  <br>  <br>  11:33 a nother night i was sitting a a computer desk in a dark room (well there is a little light from the computer) and out the Corner of my eye i saw i white figure walk in the room and i turned towards the door and there was nothing there and whilst i was still watching watching the door a black fog or mist or cloud i dont how to describe it just flooted through the door it was about 1 and a half meters tall and a meter wide it stoped for a second and dissaperd<br>  <br>  i could go on but i better not<br>  <br>  sorry if i wrote to much

3mAgM405aa	Anal sex is quite enjoyable and will take some preprep before engaging in it.<br>  <br>  Begin by:<br>  <br>  1. Pre-stretching the sphincter muscle by insertion of a medium sized well-lubricated dildo. Do this for at least a week or more prior to anal sex;<br>  <br>  2. Self-administering an enema consisting of plain warm water [without any laxative] via a hot water bottle to wash out all fecal matter from within the rectum; stop administering when the expelled water appears clear. Do this about 2-3 hours prior to the act;<br>  <br>  3. Asking your bf to shave along the shaft of his organ in order to remove any hair. No hair allows smoother entry of the organ. <br>  <br>  4. Using a lot of lubricant [K-Y] on the male organ;<br>  <br>  5. Engaging in the doggie position, where you are on your hands and knees and he enter from atop;<br>  <br>  6. Using a condom is optional since you are basically very clean inside your rectum and should you engage in oral sex immediately after he climaxes in your anal passageway; use an antiseptic/alcohol wipe on his organ before continuing oral sex.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|sfHGnvxzaa	ouch, but then again, it did hurt losing it through the front door lol. <br>  <br>  i heard guys like receiving anal more than girls because their prostate gland is closer to the rectum......<br>  <br>  whatever floats your boat. sex is supposed to be fun and WILD! =]|`|AA12006309	Done it, but it's not my thing.

bb309e8ae443e7204ff3491b1af57778aa	God is angry at satan because Satan hurts people and God loves us. Satan thought he could be as powerful as God and rebelled. He is actually jealous of us because we are made in the likeness of God and will be lifted up higher than the angels.<br>  <br>  Psalm 8:4-5: "What is man, that Thou art mindful of him? Or the son of man, that Thou visitest him? Thou hast made him a little lower than the angels; with glory and honour hast Thou crowned him, and Thou hast set him over the works of Thy hands." God created man in a state "a little lower than the angels". However, at the Incarnation, when the pre-eternal Word and Son of God became man, the dignity of humanity was elevated and man is now in a state above that of the angels. I Corinthians 6:2-3, we read: "Do ye not know that the saints shall judge the world? And if the world shall be judged by you, are ye unworthy to judge the smallest matters? Know ye not that we shall judge angels?"<br>  <br>  So Satan is jealous of humans and hurts us by discouraging us or trying to stray us away from God, the One who loves us and will save us from hell. God is angry with Satan and will punish him in the end.<br>  <br>  Hope that helped!|`|dX8qCoJ3aa	That wouldnt make sense.

Have a look at the book of Job where they make a silly bet on "Gods" most devoted followers life and "God" lets Satan kill his family to show how devoted Job is.. lmao<br>  <br>  They're actually the same thing, you just have to read it from the correct perspective which is a gnostic perspective not the junk the churches misled everyone with. In Gnosticism the Abrahamic God is considered what they called the Demiurge... The people that wrote the tales in the bible believed in the Serpent, which represents knowledge through gnosis, the same thing Jesus represents, to become their own Gods.

He became filled with pride, and decided that he wanted to BE God and be worshiped as God (and "a god") instead of simply do his job. SO he tries to throw God out of heaven by leading a revolt (against an omnipotent, omniscient omnipresent being no doubt) and lost and took a third of the angels in heaven with him. Hence, the creation of Hell as his punishment yadda yadda yadda.<br>  <br>  Angels are Free-Will creations also; so they can choose between good and evil.

According to the Bible writers as soon as God created Heaven during the “week of creation” with all the angels, 1/3 of them were not one bit impressed with God’s beauty and holiness. They rebelled against God on the SPOT and became known as Demons along with Lucifer or “Light Bearer” who became known as Satan, the Devil, and so on. This fact alone proves that God did not create Demons! Praise the LORD! Sweet Jesus!  Lucifer is the most beautiful and intelligent angel ever created! IMHO this is a major glitch in God’s Creation story that Christians refuse to discuss! The Bible writers say that God created the Universe that in their culture was known as firmament or Heaven and Earth (the Sun was not a star).  Today we are finding out that this real universe is about 78,000,000,000 light years wide. 1 Light SECOND = 186,000 miles or 300,000 km. Find our how many seconds we have in one year and multiply by 186,000 miles or 300,000 km to get the linear distance of only ONE (1) LIGHT YEAR! Some Christians have an adequate IQ to figure out! There is no room here to accommodate all the zeros! It is an ASTRONOMICAL number that would have blown the mind of the Bible writers. They thought that the stars were hanging from a “firmament!” <br>  <br>  God was busy creating Heaven and Hell to do anything about this angelical rebellion right away so he scheduled to have all the rebellious angels evicted from fairy Heaven and cast down to Earth along with Lucifer during the “Tribulation Period” after the Rapture?. Most Preachers follow this primitive Bible script and claim that this event will take place any time soon! NOWHERE in this humongous UNIVERSE there is going to be a single demon stranded in any planet anywhere, but they will all be here on this microscopic speck of dust that we call Earth before going to Hell to be tormented with “fire and sulfur” for ever and ever along with all sinners and those who never got to hear about “Jesus”! Hallelujah! Praise the LORD! Sweet Jesus! Amen...!? Nowadays, they commute back and forth to Earth…! (Please forgive my Christian hangover...!!! I can't stop “praising the LORD,” yet...)<br>  <br>  Revelation 12:9-10 (KJV) And the great dragon was cast out, that old serpent, called the Devil, and Satan, which DECEIVETH the whole world he was cast out into the earth, and his angels were cast out with him. And I heard a loud voice saying in heaven, Now is come salvation, and strength, and the kingdom of our God, and the power of his Christ: for THE ACCUSER OF OUR BRETHREN IS CAST DOWN, WHICH ACCUSED THEM BEFORE OUR GOD DAY AND NIGHT<br>  <br>  So up to the “End of the World” SATAN and all DEMONS are busy DAY AND NIGHT blowing the whistle before God on the misbehaving Christians, especially on cheating Christian spouses and naughty teenagers! God is eagerly collecting information on their input DAY AND NIGHT!!! And he is never bored to do it to this very day!!! You can tell that Heaven is run by very low IQ aliens!!! Satan is very much respected in Heaven, too! No angel has the power to hurt Satan! Only Christians pretend to exorcise him! (Jude 1:9).<br>  <br>  It is a shame that not even one single “Guardian Angel” was available to watch over and protect Eve from committing an UNKNOWN EVIL like eating from the fruit of the KNOWLEDGE OF GOOD AND EVIL. Considering that God Loves humankind so much and Eve was so innocent going about TOTALLY NAKED and ignorant about any evil issue like eating a forbidden fruit that if left hanging on the tree will eventually fall on its own and rot! God was very negligent not to provide a "Guardian Angel" like we see in so many cartoons trying to wise up the person undergoing the little Devil's temptation. The wanking Bible writers claim that this fruit has the potential of sending the bulk of humanity that God loves so much to Hell “prepared for Satan and his angels” (Mat. 25:41).  So in their Bible script they let the fate of the whole human race at the hands of an ignorant and FULLY INNOCENT woman! It was a set up! Eve learned that it was evil to eat the forbidden fruit of knowledge ONLY when her “eyes were opened and realized that she was naked!” The story has GOD setting up Eve so the bulk of humanity ends up in Hell! The Bible writers say that God planned it to be that way “before the foundation of the world” because God's pleasure was to sacrifice his "only begotten Son Jesus Christ" to fix his own screw ups!<br>  <br>  1 Peter 1:19-20 (KJV) But with the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot:  WHO VERILY WAS FOREORDAINED BEFORE THE FOUNDATION OF THE WORLD!* (*for “God’s sake!” how moron do you need to be to be a Christian?!!! I am sure that the wanking perverts who wrote the Bible never imagined the success that their work was going to have on the bulk of humanity!) <br>  <br>  About 1,000 Bible years after the “Creation Week” more angels banded together to quit Heaven in the days of Noah when they noticed that the girls from around here were "BEAUTIFUL" so they had sex and family with them (Gen 6:1-2) – This is a clue in the Bible that the male angels were created with well hung sexual organs, and that sex in Heaven must be either very lousy or the female angels very ugly and prudish so they had to look elsewhere to satisfy their GOD ENDOWED sexual cravings. GOD is not capable to keep all the angels happy in Heaven hardly 1,000 Bible years after the first angelical rebellion!  So the male angels had to look elsewhere to satisfy their God created sexual cravings… and Christians pretend to be happy for all eternity in Heaven worshipping this same virtual God put together by the Bible writers! The Bible writers even say that without gullibility or rather FAITH (spiritually speaking) it is impossible to please God! (Heb 11:6) They insist that they wrote the Bible “as they were led by God the Holy Ghost”! In fact they claimed that they didn’t know what they were writing until they read what they wrote and were amazed! (2 Pet 1:21)  There ought to be some higher schooling teaching how religions function in real life environment, especially Christianity! I imagine that Islam is easier to explain, but I was not a Muslim! Most Christians hardly read the Bible and stop to think what they are reading! They let their favorite preacher tell them what Christianity is all about like the Muslims expect their mullahs to tell them all about Allah and Mohammed! The classical “When we get to Heaven God will tell us all that we need to know” is what makes Christianity so thriving! As far as learning or finding out where or how we came about to be religious people have it all figured out! I went to Christian College and I honestly read and taught the Bible in my Christian ministry for many years without paying much attention to what I had to discard of the Bible, but I slowly went over the whole Bible again and it got me to the point that I had to shout, “HOLY CRAP!” It is amazing all the human excrement* (*sh*t) that a low IQ Christian, Mormon, JW, Muslim or what have you must believe to go to a place that doesn’t exist outside of the Bible or the Koran!|`|CBrVs8H5aa	i am satanic dude all you need to know will be on this website<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.joyofsatan.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.joyofsatan.org</a>

Even a shitty convenience store job, or as an assembly line worker.

(there is suggested evidence that he existed, other than the bible, but that he was simply a man)  The writers of the bible, and the church, only later stated that she was a prostitute to defy her name.

Just try to carefully bring up the subject and see what he says.|`|MgMsMExPaa	You scared him when you said 'what' . He has "baited " you with that little tid bit of information and he knows that is working on your head and that you will not rest until you clear up this question.<br>  Two possible reasons for this are, and I think that this is most likely  since the two of you are already friendly. He wants you, he is interested in you as a date, partner etc.<br>  The other possibility is that he has figured you out and he thinks he knows what you like. He would do this to have someone that he trusts to confide in.<br>  I think the first one is more likely because You said that he smiled and walked away. I think that he was "baiting or testing you"<br>  So my advice is start dating him, he is waiting to hear from you.|`|jzMM8imyaa	Hmm. Your question reminds me of my friend and I. He hasn't said anything like that. He told me he's straight (even though he's never done anything to tell him he is for sure. Never even masturbated, and he's 16, almost 17). BUt there's still that vibe coming from him that tells me otherwise. It's different that he trusts me with such personal information. So I guess I'm in the same boat as you. I kinda like him, but I'm trying to get over him.|`|4kqvnQtUaa	Next time you see him because he did come out, Just ask what type of guys he likes & just be cool with it all.

I'd rather be aware of what's going on and upset by it than blissfully unaware.|`|279ac5587c0a982b23b03bde3f0bbf91aa	Yes <br>  peace of mind is not found in religion, science or knowledge it is found in ignorance.   One will say look at the stars and say God put them there but they do not know this they just believe it. They find bliss in their dishonest ignorance. <br>  Another may say I do not know  how the stars came to be and he finds bliss in his honestly accepting his ignorance. <br>  There are many paths all lead to I  don't know.|`|PToFyrz5aa	ignorance of a subject, ignorance of a profession, please, we are all ignorant of many things.<br>  Bliss is a state of mind that transforms the unknowing brain to perceive it is well and happy,and all else matters not.<br>  <br>  now my brain hurts.|`|oeO8Tgroaa	And no escuse in the end :)<br>  You all have internet and schools and many examples, there is no escape unless you lived in a jungle with a bone in your nose.|`|J36FKvkHaa	Willful ignorance is the only sin I believe in.|`|BPO6roTOaa	You ever wonder why such a small percentage of the world's population is non-religious?|`|3vmDRCTCaa	It might seem like bliss while we're on earth, but not after we die.

UE2fFzq7aa	Look up the the scriptures where it talks about being a part of a body and how each part has a special function.  Then bring props like a toothbrush, and screwdriver, a spatula, soap, stuff like that.  Then have each person pick one and tell why they picked it... Then say.. would u brush your teeth w/ a spatula, would u cook with screwdriver...etc.  Then read those scriptures about how God has designed each one of us for a specific purpose and that we shouldn't be jealous of others for that reason.  It's a good one for kids.

hJAtgbb8aa	A person becomes weaker as people keep on hurting them consistently. No matter how strong a person is, they may give up and too much offense and hatred is likely to break down a person and take them to a position where they get offended by life.<br>  But that applies to everyone, but the gay guys who take offense for silly things are either dumb or the spoiled brat who got nothing but love, and so can't tolerate slight bit of pain.<br>  But again, people being like that all the time is highly unlikely.<br>  My mom takes offense to silly things and she's not gay.<br>  I'm gay but it takes a LOT to offend me.<br>  <br>  (\_(\<br>  (=' :') --<I ?

You've been doing this for too long, so we aren't fond of what you say.<br>  Of course, you're probably just a Tara J clone.|`|z2xRXM5Laa	Get a JOB.  Get a life. <br>  Everyone sees you coming out here hating on gays.  God loves EVERYONE and we are not to sit in judgment of anyone.  He doesn't want fake christians twisting his words to pollute people's minds by spreading ignorance, hatred and violence.|`|6SwaWSoyaa	because we are human beings and humans get offended when people make asshole comments to them 24/7.|`|lPPgMKibaa	because now 'gay' means bad.<br>  you can go away now.|`|hyYWX82Eaa	WELL you know what they say about having a stick up yer ****.|`|QOHrPeXKaa	This is exactly why tweens shouldn't be allowed on computers.

Different is bad! Everybody should be like me!"<br>  The point? Not everybody can be, or wants to be like that. Society is a system of individuals working to maintain order, not a huge group of clones all screaming "Oppress the different ones!"<br>  I never got the whole "Race" thing in politics and slavery, so what if somebody's of African, or Asian, or Native American, or any other decent? <br>  Is there anything wrong with them?<br>  Different doesn't mean bad =] it means something that we just aren't used to it at the moment. If people try to understand different things, it's amazing what they can learn.<br>  <br>  For example from my case:<br>  When I was 11, I wanted to be straight, white, Christian, and normal. But, when I started thinking about it, Was there anything really wrong with me? <br>  So what? I like guys! So did Michelangelo! Heck, one of the presidents was also thought to be gay! There's nothing wrong with anybody of a different sexual orientation, we're still people, just like you. <br>  Picture having a crush on somebody, or even being in love with them. They mean everything to you, probably more than they'd ever know. And because of your culture, and because you were of the same gender, it was wrong to tell them how you feel. In that world it was wrong to love certain people... Sadly that's the world some of us have to face every day. I, myself, live in a predominantly Catholic village in the middle of nowhere. I'm one of 10 or so kids in my whole school who isn't white, and above being picked on and joked about because of what's on the outside, people would do just the same for who I am on the inside. I can't tell you how long I've loved this guy in my grade, nothing more would I want than to see him happy throughout his life. Even if I couldn't be with him, I want him to be as content with his life as possible. I pray to... who knows what... (I use the name "God" but I'm just hoping for a miracle here... and it just takes more willpower than I can possibly have) every day that maybe he could like me too. I know that there's such a small chance of him actually being gay or bisexual that It's hard to not give up. But, I'm starting to think my hopes might be holding true, and starting this Wednesday I've been euphoric for a week.<br>  I guess all it takes is walking a mile in somebody else's shoes!<br>  I'm not kidding actually, If you really want to, spend the rest of tonight that you're awake really thinking about being a different sexual orientation. Something you couldn't help, but people just try to crush who you are because they don't understand.<br>  Then ask yourself "Why do gays get offended so easily?"<br>  Only you can really answer the question for how you feel about it.<br>  I hope you see things the way we do after tonight!|`|hMNOBYHCaa	If you make a joke about me, or look at me wrong, I won't like it either.  I'm a fat old white grandmother, not gay, but I won't like it one little bit.<br>  <br>  Maybe you're just offensive.  I've read and answered two of your questions in the last few minutes and found them both offensive and really obnoxious.|`|fUK9y3Qkaa	Im not OFFENDED easily I just don't like bullsh*t!! Plain and simple!!!!<br>  <br>  <br>  Lets move on to you. I think your a undercover closet Lesbian! Scared to admit to the fact that you are gay, so you come on here ask these dumb a** questions, and take your frustration out on us. The sooner you stop being scared and admit that you are gay the better off you will be. It's ok your happiness will come when you stop bein so hypercritical!!!<br>  <br>  <br>  UGH..SMH|`|xJVYh2PVaa	They don't. When you go up to anyone and tell them that part of their being is morally wrong, they are going to get offended.|`|BUe6hAK8aa	because everyone messes with them.<br>  noone really qives them respect!<br>  kayy?|`|WeR0E56eaa	it depends upon the joke u make<br>  <br>  and the look u give|`|5a1PpwrWaa	haha your funny.<br>  ignorant people like you.|`|lQR9fYGhaa	cuz your a ****|`|4azCh1aeaa	are you a new homophobe on yahoo answers?????|`|SIFyxFFpaa	why do you say that?<br>  <br>  we like funny jokes, if they are funny.

xjw9ecUDaa	Junon boy contest is a kind of male version of a beauty pageant, hosted by a popular magazine, Junon. I hear it's a very keen competition, and many girls give an eye to the result. (including my girlfriend, grrr!!!)<br>  <br>  There are some awards, and most of the winners make a contract with a talent agency, and go into show business.<br>  <br>  The contestant must be a male, of course, and must also be an amateur at the age of 13 to 22.<br>  <br>  The winners vary in type. Some look feminine, others look wild. Some are not very good-looking, but sing well, others act well. It's really hard to tell what kind of a guy can be the winner.<br>  <br>  Um, I'm a guy, and I don't know much about the contest, actually. To tell the truth, all the information above is from my girlfriend, so if you want to know more, I recommend asking for the details in Japan section. I think there are some native Japanese women, and they will help you more than me.
pFeKIbjkaa	Ahahahahahahaha!!!!!!!<br>  <br>       Are they sumos, or just fake wrestlers?<br>  <br>       I mean, it really just depends on what two cultures you are comparing.<br>  <br>       While it is true that some stereotypes may be true, you have to understand that everyone is an individual. Everyone responds to things differently.<br>  <br>       I at least hope that these dudes know english. If not, then do some web searching and look up some keywords. You have no idea how much someone appreciates it when you make an effort to communicate with them.<br>  <br>       If all else fails, go to the store, and get some beer, or sake. I know they will appreciate that.
myCyhsouaa	You could get some Victorian wallpaper and distress it a little bit so it would look old and weathered. You could place some white candle-sticks around the room, maybe keep some Red, romantic smelling incense burning in a fancy holder. You could throw some cream colored throw blankets around. Basically keep it very formal, sultry and dark. Grab you inspirations from Victorian and anything really old, vintage England. French style could be useful too- for it's detail and romantic tastes. It's a fabulous idea- Good luck! :)|`|5uzHW4CYaa	I agree with the first suggest, also, some black drapes?<br>  Good luck.|`|phxPTfu7aa	well you could go with the colors of time. we vampires think back to the years of being young vampires. i still use velvet in my home.

03vbT9olaa	Financially the hospitals are hurting all over America.<br>  The people that do not have insurance flood the Emergency Rooms because they know you can not be turned away for service at an emergency room because you can not pay.<br>  Some hospitals are closing because of bad debt from people that do not pay their medical bills.<br>  And<br>  The insurance companies only pay a little for services that the hospitals provide.  Take for example an Xray. <br>  An Xray of a back costs about four hundred dollars for someone cominng off the street to pay for the Xray as an outpatient basis.<br>  The Blue Cross and Blue Shield insurance company has a contract with hospitals.  They only reimburse the hospital about twenty five dollars for an Xray.<br>  Medicare and Medicaid would pay only twenty dollars for the same Xray.<br>  This contracting is required in order for the hospitals to receive payment from Blue Cross and Medicare and Medicaid.

How did your parents find out & if they do know what was there reaction? - I told them. Very negative at first for religious reasons. Things have slowly gotten better with them over time.<br>  <br>  3. If you are a lesbian stud, how do you receive pleasure and do you use a strap on? Not really my thing but when I've done it for gfs who wanted that enjoyed doing something for them that they liked. Not really a sexual turn on for me.<br>  <br>  4. If you are a gay male do you only receive or you are the giver or do you do both? NA<br>  <br>  5. If you are lesbian or gay, do you want kids? Yes, we're planning on it.<br>  <br>  6. Do you think gay marriage should be legal in the US? Absolutely. Everyone should have the same rights.<br>  <br>  7. How old when you knew you were gay or what feeling did you have? 12 when I was first aware of being attracted to women. About 20 before I was sure I was gay and not bi.|`|oSSL1wKpaa	1) gay<br>  2) I told my mum when I was 17; she was fine with it.<br>  3) N/A<br>  4) Pass!<br>  5) no<br>  6) yes<br>  7) I noticed that I liked a boy in my class when I was about 11.|`|AA12006309	1. Are you gay, lesbian, or bi?  For the sake of your question, we'll say "bi".  I'm actually pansexual.<br>  <br>  2. How did your parents find out & if they do know what was there reaction?  My parents don't know, they're deceased.  My father died twenty years ago, my mother, nine years ago.<br>  <br>  3. If you are a lesbian stud, how do you receive pleasure and do you use a strap on?  Not applicable.<br>  <br>  4. If you are a gay male do you only receive or you are the giver or do you do both?  Also not applicable.  I'll explain below.<br>  <br>  5. If you are lesbian or gay, do you want kids?  I already have kids, two of them.<br>  <br>  6. Do you think gay marriage should be legal in the US?  Of course.  Equality should be legalized.<br>  <br>  7. How old when you knew you were gay or what feeling did you have?  I knew without a word for it early, but I didn't come to terms with it til College.  I was 17.<br>  <br>  The reason some of your questions don't really apply is that I'm a transgender person, biologically female, in a relationship with a male.|`|hyYWX82Eaa	You're gonna offend some people if you call it a lifestyle. Just fyi. <br>  <br>  1. Are you gay, lesbian, or bi? Lesbian, but I can just go by queer or gay if I feel like it. <<<br>  <br>  2. How did your parents find out & if they do know what was there reaction? Mum just outright asked me when we were talking about rights issues. She hugged me and I told her about me gf. Dad found out by asking mum (I think I intimidate him sometimes XD) they've both been BEYOND supportive--and now dad and I like to check out the hot chicks on Law and Order together. <br>  <br>  3. If you are a lesbian stud, how do you receive pleasure and do you use a strap on? Giving my lover pleasure is the biggest turnon on EARTH. I don't use a strap on as my partner and I are both not into the penetration aspect of sex. You don't need a dick to make an orgasm or three ^~<br>  <br>  4. If you are a gay male do you only receive or you are the giver or do you do both? Sorry I'm not a bloke. <br>  <br>  5. If you are lesbian or gay, do you want kids? Yeah. But after we finish Uni and get settled in. I want to offer them a stable life.<br>  <br>  6. Do you think gay marriage should be legal in the US? Yes. It doesn't hurt anyone's relationships and it gives us tax and other rights that civil unions don't offer. All I wanna do is marry my girlfriend--the fact that I'm a girl doesn't make that somehow taboo <br>  <br>  7. How old when you knew you were gay or what feeling did you have? I've always sort of KNOWN but I never had a name for it. When I met my gf and we started to get physical I wasn't sure what to think, I'd never called myself straight and had actually assumed I was asexual up until that point. After our first real night together, I crawled up next to her onto the pillows, she looked at me and said "Guess that means we're REALLY lesbians now" XD<br>  <br>  Any information would be greatly appreciated. I'm a college student from Berkeley California living in the UK for a year. My parents are liberal, my partner's are conservative. I've never had sex with a man nor do I want to. I hope to get married and carry my partner's child.|`|kmd2lJOIaa	*Sigh*<br>  I hate to sound bitter, but many of these questions are really none of your (or anybody's) business.  I don't see why you would need to know who uses a strap-on and who receives for a social science class.  Also, I hate the term "lifestyle" when referring to homosexuality.  We're not that different from straight people.  The answers you get on Y!A will not be enough to judge all gays and lesbians by.

Do you think gay marriage should be legal in the US? Yes.<br>  <br>  7. How old when you knew you were gay or what feeling did you have? Maybe 7-10 years old.|`|yFGRxygiaa	1. Lesbian or bi, but I definitely lean more towards girls.<br>  <br>  2. My parents have always known and they have never cared either way. Gender in a prospective partner to them is unimportant.<br>  I can remember them asking me once when I came home from school:<br>  Got a boyfriend yet? "No." Got a girlfriend yet? "Nope"<br>  Really? "Yeap."<br>  <br>  3. I'm a virgin.<br>  <br>  4. N/A<br>  <br>  5. I would love children!! I definitely want some!<br>  <br>  6. Heck yes!!<br>  <br>  7. As soon as I was interested in guys I realised I was also interested in girls. Gradually I came to realise that I've always been more attracted to girls and I am unsure how much my attraction to guys was a part of fitting in with my peers when I already stood out. (I'm vegie, have no tv, lived in an eco-village and have hippy parents)<br>  <br>  Hope you get good grades! XD
sn2fuDUGaa	to back jack (hey that rhymes) up, yes there is a god.  and to answer the question u asked, he was always here.  we dont know how or why, but wen we die we will. sorry to disappoint you, but believing in god is all about faith, which not a lot of intelligent people have.|`|AA10011095	Are you worried that Zeus and Apollo maybe exist?|`|iUNMCEvUaa	Well there isn't one.|`|Pvp36CRyaa	personally i'd rather live my whole life believing and having faith in god then finding out later that he is real and its too late.|`|bef202d85afc8aa7378d77f3bc4fd7e8aa	"I could not submit to superstitious fantasies of what you really are, and I'd thank him for a heavenly outcome" He'd understand I was on the right track.|`|AA11336384	Ask him why the eff he hasn't done anything in years.|`|HEDSOHq1aa	then he'd better apologize to me for not showing his face|`|jaoFSXwkaa	Truthfully I believe you are wrong, mostly all intelligent people know God is not make believe. From a religious stand point, Christians, Jews, and Muslims all believe in the same God, they just don't agree on who the messiah is. It's a well known fact that these three groups spread across almost 3/4 the earth, I can't see that many people wrong. If there is no God where did we come from? Sure you could say we're mutants and we evolved from monkeys or bacteria or what ever but where did the bacteria come from. The Big Bang? Ok where did the group of gas come from? It's a scientific fact that nothing can be produced by nothing. I also believe that it's better to believe and be rewarded than not and lose out. If there is no God, oh well then I guess I'll just rot. So when you miss out, sorry but you had your chance.|`|Adf1VF1Laa	I would tell him:<br>  <br>  "You aren't god, because a real god wouldn't be petty enough to care whether or not someone believes in you."|`|6709f9f8b081a814a21bfcf6aade68e3aa	So... you're a lesbian, huh? Interesting...
e08zWhUjaa	ok here's the deal.. i think just you saying "cure" you alienated most gay people out there..  Its not a sickness, its not a choice its something your born with.  Now on a different note.  I think if you asked me If i had a choice in my next life would i try STR8  - and i would say Yes... i think it could be interesting if i found woman as hot and sexy and irresistible as i do men... I do think it could be very interesting.. I mean i find women beautiful and sexy Im just not attracted to them and i think i would enjoy it a bit if i did...  i know this strays from your question but i answered it the best way i could..|`|N73oZyY8aa	No, these things have side effects. I don't need a third ear or chemical celibacy.|`|ecywznKRaa	It's not a disease......|`|cIPziIdnaa	I think maybe at one time long ago I might have been tempted, but now I have become so comfortable with my sexuality and everyone I love has been so accepting, I don't think I would know how to live as a straight man and really don't want to take the time to learn either - so I guess the short answer is no, I wouldn't.|`|qTRzRi8gaa	Nah.<br>  <br>  I'd take something that would make me bisexual or pansexual, that way I'd just have that much more to pick from, but no way I'm giving up my attraction for guys or exchanging it just so I could be straight.  It would be like cutting off my hand.  No thnx.|`|RXS9K18Faa	nah i am happy being gay. i will admit at one time i wished i could take a straight pill but as my life went on i realized that its not that bad. And now i am perfectly happy being gay. =)|`|ErN3pbTeaa	Nope I love my boyfriend too much, and my parents love me regardless.|`|RkjKDh6yaa	I can understand why some people would, but I wouldn't.

Being born homosexual, is just as valid by nature as being born heterosexual. Just as valid as being born a girl or a boy, being born to grow tall or short, or having an adeptness for sports or classical music! To find a cure to people being born gay, would also means finding a cure to people being born straight. And why the bloody hell would anyone want to find a cure to being born gay, how about we work on finding a cure for homophobia!|`|bAUO9Yhdaa	I wouldn't call it a "cure," but to actually answer your question...<br>  <br>  It would be difficult for me to decide. There are definitely downsides of being gay. Dating is difficult. I can't just walk up to someone I think is hot and ask them out. Society in general tends to be homophobic so I have to watch what I say and do. I'm not tied to a relationship so it wouldn't emotionally hurt anyone if I became straight.<br>  <br>  On the other hand modifying such a significant part of me feels just wrong. My sexual orientation is part of who I am.|`|kmd2lJOIaa	Everybody else is saying no, but I just might take it.  Being straight wouldn't be so bad.  It seems like it would make my life easier at least.  I'm probably going to get lots of thumbs downs for this, but if I was straight, dating would be simpler, people would never think twice about my sexual orientation, and I wouldn't have to keep it a secret from my family out of fear that they'd think it was a "phase."|`|jzMM8imyaa	Definitely not. At one point, such as before I came out and was uncomfortable with myself, yes. I probably would have. But now that I've come to terms with who I am, no way. Besides, I think I'm in love with someone far too much for me to give up being what makes me myself.|`|2lim0SHvaa	Are you nuts?<br>  Being gay is the best life possible.<br>  Anyway, no scientist would ever work on anything as evil as a cure for something that needs celebration, not a cure.|`|ZhycVSBRaa	No. Being gay is not a sickness, so there's nothing to cure: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtypELv2jzY&eurl=http://www.truthwinsout.org/what-the-experts-say/" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtypELv2j...</a>|`|gQZZWHHkaa	Nope being me includes being gay and being me is greater than or equal to anything.|`|YVSIje93aa	Why would you make a cure for a wonderful thing.<br>  Being gay is not a disease.<br>  <br>  No I wouldn't take it.|`|4azCh1aeaa	are you really that stupid??? being gay is good just like being straight. you like to be straight we like to be gays soo watch it!!!lol|`|o3SB4H11aa	Never|`|yFGRxygiaa	Never.

0lnamekJaa	I heard on History Channel that lemmings running off the cliff is a myth... Created by a Disney Doc Producer that needed a hook for his show... <br>  <br>  He gathered up the rodents and pushed them off the cliff...<br>  <br>  What, exactly, are you asking? <br>  <br>  I really don't understand...<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lemmings" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lemmings</a><br>  Lemmings are small rodents, usually found in or near the Arctic, in tundra biomes. They are subniveal animals and together with the voles and muskrats, they make up the subfamily Arvicolinae (also known as Microtinae), which forms part of the largest mammal radiation by far, the superfamily Muroidea, which also includes the rats, mice, hamsters, and gerbils.<br>  <br>  Myths and misconceptions<br>  Misconceptions about lemmings go back many centuries. In the 1530s, the geographer Zeigler of Strasbourg proposed the theory that the creatures fell out of the sky during stormy weather (also featured in the folklore of the Inupiat/Yupik at Norton Sound), and then died suddenly when the grass grew in spring.[4] This myth was refuted by the natural historian Ole Worm, who accepted that the lemmings could fall out of the sky but that they had been brought over by the wind rather than created by spontaneous generation. It was Worm who first published dissections of a lemming, which showed that they are anatomically similar to most other rodents, and the work of Carl Linnaeus proved that the animals had a natural origin.[5][6]<br>  <br>  While many people believe that lemmings commit mass suicide when they migrate, this is not the case. Driven by strong biological urges, they will migrate in large groups when population density becomes too great. Lemmings can and do swim and may choose to cross a body of water in search of a new habitat.[7] On occasion, and particularly in the case of the Norway lemmings in Scandinavia, large migrating groups will reach a cliff overlooking the ocean. They will stop until the urge to press on causes them to jump off the cliff and start swimming, sometimes to exhaustion and death. Lemmings are also often pushed into the sea as more and more lemmings arrive at the shore.[8]<br>  <br>  The myth of lemming mass suicide is long-standing and has been popularized by a number of factors. In 1955, Carl Barks drew an Uncle Scrooge adventure comic with the title "The Lemming with the Locket". This comic, which was inspired by a 1954 National Geographic Society article, showed massive numbers of lemmings jumping over Norwegian cliffs.[9] Even more influential was the 1958 Disney film White Wilderness, which won an Academy Award for Documentary Feature, in which footage was shown that seems to show the mass suicide of lemmings.[10] A Canadian Broadcasting Corporation documentary, Cruel Camera, found that the lemmings used for White Wilderness were flown from Hudson Bay to Calgary, Alberta, Canada, where they did not jump off the cliff, but in fact were launched off the cliff using a turntable.[11]<br>  <br>  Due to their association with this odd behavior, lemming suicide is a frequently-used metaphor in reference to people who go along unquestioningly with popular opinion, with potentially dangerous or fatal consequences. This is the theme of the video game Lemmings, where the player attempts to save the mindlessly marching rodents from walking to their deaths.|`|AA11124121	what's a "leming"?|`|x9iv6oBNaa	Lemmings have no fear.<br>  Hence, the lemming population is stabilized, and the owls starve.|`|PBNPWPbVaa	What about it?<br>  Lemmings fear death i'm sure.....

It also indicates your loyalty to your ideals, responsibilities, or beliefs.|`|b8NMvbNFaa	Ring<br>  <br>  To see a ring in your dream, symbolizes emotional wholeness, continuity and commitments. If the ring is on your finger, then it signifies your commitment to a relationship or a successful new endeavor. It also indicates your loyalty to your ideals, responsibilities, or beliefs. <br>  <br>  To see a broken ring in your dream, indicates that your loyalty is called into question. Someone is attacking your sense of loyalty. It is indicative of disappointments and separation. <br>  <br>  To dream that you lose a ring or someone has stolen your ring, represents insecurity. Perhaps you are losing interest in some relationship or issue. <br>  <br>  To dream that you receive a ring, denotes that your suspicions and worries over you lover will end.

e08zWhUjaa	The best thing to do is be perfectly honest.  Deal is if he cannot accept the fact that you need to explore this side on occasion then he has the right of refusal to the marriage.  Since you made a vow to stay monogamous and you now want to change that its only fair that the original agreement is not fair at all.  it would be much better to come to some mutual agreement rather then cheat or play around behind his back.  Perhaps you can come to a list or rules if he is open to it.. If he isn't then you will both be better off to part ways now.. that way each of you can move on to what each of you may want... tough i know but honest and truthful to each of you in the long run...best of luck..|`|30da49ce7350d87aa6b90301d5bc7940aa	You vowed to forsake all others, cheating with a woman wouldn't be any different than cheating with a man.  Since you had already discussed this and agreed to monogamy I would say you should honor your commitment, although if you are willing to lose your husband over it you might discuss it with him and then deal with the consequences good or bad.  It's possible he might be willing to engage in a threesome or allow you seek an outside partner but would you be willing to allow him to seek other sex partners as well?  It would hardly be fair to expect him to be faithful if your are not.|`|E8rPB1CBaa	Key word here is, "play".  Sweetheart, why trade your honor of your husband for a play thing???  Women are not designed to be played with, someone is going to end up getting hurt if you don't stop being selfish and self centered.  Your husband doesn't deserve this coming from you.  It's like betrayal.  Don't mean to sound angry just putting it to you straight.  It seems like you just want to play with people without regard to others emotions.  Stay with your husband, stop entertaining the lustful thoughts and get on with your life.  This way you can put yourself out of your misery.  However, if you choose the other, get a divorce because marriage is not for you.|`|fLpzKulAaa	If you could find a willing party, would he be open to a threesome?<br>  However, just be warned that could backfire.<br>  I have a friend who is bisexual and was happy in her marriage of 3 years until about a year ago.

According to the Bible writers as soon as God created Heaven during the “week of creation” with all the angels, 1/3 of them were not one bit impressed with God’s beauty and holiness. They rebelled against God on the SPOT and became known as Demons along with Lucifer or “Light Bearer” who became known as Satan, the Devil, and so on. This fact alone proves that God did not create Demons! Praise the LORD! Sweet Jesus!  Lucifer is the most beautiful and intelligent angel ever created! IMHO this is a major glitch in God’s Creation story that Christians refuse to discuss! The Bible writers say that God created the Universe that in their culture was known as firmament or Heaven and Earth (the Sun was not a star).  Today we are finding out that this real universe is about 78,000,000,000 light years wide. 1 Light SECOND = 186,000 miles or 300,000 km. Find our how many seconds we have in one year and multiply by 186,000 miles or 300,000 km to get the linear distance of only ONE (1) LIGHT YEAR! Some Christians have an adequate IQ to figure out! There is no room here to accommodate all the zeros! It is an ASTRONOMICAL number that would have blown the mind of the Bible writers. They thought that the stars were hanging from a “firmament!” <br>  <br>  God was busy creating Heaven and Hell to do anything about this angelical rebellion right away so he scheduled to have all the rebellious angels evicted from fairy Heaven and cast down to Earth along with Lucifer during the “Tribulation Period” after the Rapture?. Most Preachers follow this primitive Bible script and claim that this event will take place any time soon! NOWHERE in this humongous UNIVERSE there is going to be a single demon stranded in any planet anywhere, but they will all be here on this microscopic speck of dust that we call Earth before going to Hell to be tormented with “fire and sulfur” for ever and ever along with all sinners and those who never got to hear about “Jesus”! Hallelujah! Praise the LORD! Sweet Jesus! Amen...!? Nowadays, they commute back and forth to Earth…! (Please forgive my Christian hangover...!!! I can't stop “praising the LORD,” yet...)<br>  <br>  Revelation 12:9-10 (KJV) And the great dragon was cast out, that old serpent, called the Devil, and Satan, which DECEIVETH the whole world he was cast out into the earth, and his angels were cast out with him. And I heard a loud voice saying in heaven, Now is come salvation, and strength, and the kingdom of our God, and the power of his Christ: for THE ACCUSER OF OUR BRETHREN IS CAST DOWN, WHICH ACCUSED THEM BEFORE OUR GOD DAY AND NIGHT<br>  <br>  So up to the “End of the World” SATAN and all DEMONS are busy DAY AND NIGHT blowing the whistle before God on the misbehaving Christians, especially on cheating Christian spouses and naughty teenagers! God is eagerly collecting information on their input DAY AND NIGHT!!! And he is never bored to do it to this very day!!! You can tell that Heaven is run by very low IQ aliens!!! Satan is very much respected in Heaven, too! No angel has the power to hurt Satan! Only Christians pretend to exorcise him! (Jude 1:9).<br>  <br>  It is a shame that not even one single “Guardian Angel” was available to watch over and protect Eve from committing an UNKNOWN EVIL like eating from the fruit of the KNOWLEDGE OF GOOD AND EVIL. Considering that God Loves humankind so much and Eve was so innocent going about TOTALLY NAKED and ignorant about any evil issue like eating a forbidden fruit that if left hanging on the tree will eventually fall on its own and rot! God was very negligent not to provide a "Guardian Angel" like we see in so many cartoons trying to wise up the person undergoing the little Devil's temptation. The wanking Bible writers claim that this fruit has the potential of sending the bulk of humanity that God loves so much to Hell “prepared for Satan and his angels” (Mat. 25:41).  So in their Bible script they let the fate of the whole human race at the hands of an ignorant and FULLY INNOCENT woman! It was a set up! Eve learned that it was evil to eat the forbidden fruit of knowledge ONLY when her “eyes were opened and realized that she was naked!” The story has GOD setting up Eve so the bulk of humanity ends up in Hell! The Bible writers say that God planned it to be that way “before the foundation of the world” because God's pleasure was to sacrifice his "only begotten Son Jesus Christ" to fix his own screw ups!<br>  <br>  1 Peter 1:19-20 (KJV) But with the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot:  WHO VERILY WAS FOREORDAINED BEFORE THE FOUNDATION OF THE WORLD!* (*for “God’s sake!” how moron do you need to be to be a Christian?!!! I am sure that the wanking perverts who wrote the Bible never imagined the success that their work was going to have on the bulk of humanity!) <br>  <br>  About 1,000 Bible years after the “Creation Week” more angels banded together to quit Heaven in the days of Noah when they noticed that the girls from around here were "BEAUTIFUL" so they had sex and family with them (Gen 6:1-2) – This is a clue in the Bible that the male angels were created with well hung sexual organs, and that sex in Heaven must be either very lousy or the female angels very ugly and prudish so they had to look elsewhere to satisfy their GOD ENDOWED sexual cravings. GOD is not capable to keep all the angels happy in Heaven hardly 1,000 Bible years after the first angelical rebellion!  So the male angels had to look elsewhere to satisfy their God created sexual cravings… and Christians pretend to be happy for all eternity in Heaven worshipping this same virtual God put together by the Bible writers! The Bible writers even say that without gullibility or rather FAITH (spiritually speaking) it is impossible to please God! (Heb 11:6) They insist that they wrote the Bible “as they were led by God the Holy Ghost”! In fact they claimed that they didn’t know what they were writing until they read what they wrote and were amazed! (2 Pet 1:21)  There ought to be some higher schooling teaching how religions function in real life environment, especially Christianity! I imagine that Islam is easier to explain, but I was not a Muslim! Most Christians hardly read the Bible and stop to think what they are reading! They let their favorite preacher tell them what Christianity is all about like the Muslims expect their mullahs to tell them all about Allah and Mohammed! The classical “When we get to Heaven God will tell us all that we need to know” is what makes Christianity so thriving! As far as learning or finding out where or how we came about to be religious people have it all figured out! I went to Christian College and I honestly read and taught the Bible in my Christian ministry for many years without paying much attention to what I had to discard of the Bible, but I slowly went over the whole Bible again and it got me to the point that I had to shout, “HOLY CRAP!” It is amazing all the human excrement* (*sh*t) that a low IQ Christian, Mormon, JW, Muslim or what have you must believe to go to a place that doesn’t exist outside of the Bible or the Koran!

It's not that unusual, many people pay professional photographers to take photos at funerals, and there's usually a video/D.V.D. recording of the funeral.<br>  <br>  I think it's an understandable way for one to try and find closure. <br>  <br>  <br>  - Pepper.|`|JTjL9eD7aa	I would get in-touch with the funeral director and see if they can maybe even take it for you. If not, I'm sure they can arrange for you to come in and do it unnoticed. If you feel weird asking, just explain what you've explained on here... I'm sure they will know what you're taking about and will understand your need. Just think that even if you don't feel brave enough to ask, it doesn't matter what they think of you. What matters is how you cope with this, not that someone else thinks about you in your time of need... and like I said, they'll surely understand, seeing as they deal with this on a daily basis. Best of luck.

Think of God has blessed me with long life as God has bestowed it.  Inotherwords replace bless with bestow.  <br>  Blessed, without any accent means you were already bestowed upon.  That is, except when it refers TO God, such as Blessed be God.  That is when it means praised be God.<br>  Blessed with the emphysis on the ed at the end of the word, means holy or sacred.<br>  If I recall correctly and I am sure tht I do, the litteral translation of the orignal word means Happy so that if you said well, blessed be, what you are actually saying is happy be.  We use the word bless because it is as close in meaning as our language comes to the meaning of the original texts.  If a man is bestowed upon with special gifts from God you see, then happy is he or blessed is he.  I sure hope that clarified it.

It has become a chronic disease in South India and if you do not have money and properties they will demand or press you to bring it from your father's house. There are lot of dowry harassment cases going on and as a result of this the family courts are jammed with divorce cases. This is the mentality of the people here. <br>  <br>  I myself fight  a case in Chennai for a close relative. <br>  <br>  If you are educated and earn your livelihood or you have sufficient money or parents to take case you can take similar action. But try to settle it amicably as for a lady the life will be lost and your husband can carry on marrying another lady and our society allows this. But never give the money or property till you are satisfied about their behavior. <br>  <br>  Another important thing - If you are married recently and do not have any children, please do not try to have one till you feel you are safe and happy.  I pray for your happy life.<br>  <br>  NB: I have afterwards gone though your question on honeymoon. Take care.

Varda (que significa La Exaltada, La Elevada) es la más importante de las Valar, es una de los Aratar. Su poder y belleza se encuentra en la luz. Es la reina de los Valar, esposa de Manw?. Conocida como la Dama de las Estrellas, la más hermosa de los Valar, porque en ella resplandece todavía la luz de Ilúvatar. Varda hizo las estrellas, y por eso los elfos la llaman Elentári y Elbereth, la Reina de las Estrellas.<br>  <br>  Según el Valaquenta, Varda llegó en el principio de los tiempos a la ayuda de Manw?, ya que conocía bien a Melkor, que deseaba todo el poder de Arda, y siempre lo rechazó. Así mismo, Melkor siempre la odió y temió sobre todos los demás seres creados por Ilúvatar.<br>  <br>  Los elfos aman a Varda más que a ningún otro Vala, porque fueron sus estrellas las que los llamaron al mundo y parte de su primera luz ha quedado en los ojos de los elfos para siempre. Por este hecho los elfos le cantan en poemas y canciones y la llaman Tintall?

Mientras más se investiga, más cuenta se dan de lo estúpida que es. Sin embargo se entiende claramente el por qué muchos de los que aquí han opinado creen ciegamente en ella. Es muy fácil decir “venimos del mono” pero se han puesto a analizar lo ilógico de esa afirmación. Los evolucionistas no han podido comprobar ni siquiera le origen evolutivo de un gusano, ?cuando más con respecto al origen del hombre!<br>  <br>  La revista científica Discover planteó la situación de este modo: “La evolución [...] no se halla solo bajo ataque por cristianos fundamentalistas, sino que también está siendo cuestionada por científicos de reputación. Entre los paleontólogos, científicos que estudian el registro fósil, aumenta el disentimiento respecto al punto de vista general del darvinismo”. Francis Hitching, evolucionista y autor del libro The Neck of the Giraffe (El cuello de la jirafa), declaró: “Después de centuria y cuarto, el darvinismo, a pesar de la aceptación de que es objeto en el mundo científico como el gran principio unificador de la biología, afronta una sorprendente multitud de dificultades”.<br>  <br>  Los científicos han desenterrado millones de huesos y otras indicaciones de vida pasada, y a estos se llama “fósiles”. Si la evolución fuera realidad, de seguro en todo esto debería haber prueba amplia de que una clase de organismo viviente evolucionó en otra clase o género de vida. Pero la publicación Bulletin del Museo Field de Historia Natural, de Chicago, comentó: “La teoría de [evolución] de Darwin siempre ha estado estrechamente relacionada con prueba procedente de los fósiles, y probablemente la mayoría de la gente supone que los fósiles suministran una parte muy importante del argumento general que se presenta a favor de las interpretaciones darvinianas de la historia de la vida. Por desgracia, esto no es rigurosamente verdadero”. ?Por qué no? El Bulletin pasó a decir que Darwin “quedó desconcertado por el registro fósil porque no presentaba la apariencia que él había predicho que presentaría [...] en aquel tiempo, tal como ahora, el registro geológico no presentó una cadena delicadamente graduada de una evolución lenta y progresiva”. De hecho, ahora, después de más de un siglo de recogimiento de fósiles, “tenemos hasta menos ejemplos de transición evolutiva de los que teníamos en el tiempo de Darwin”, explicó el Bulletin. ?Por qué se dice esto? Porque la prueba fósil que hay disponible hoy, que es más abundante, muestra que algunos de los ejemplos que solían emplearse como apoyo para la evolución no le dan tal apoyo de manera alguna<br>  <br>  Lo anterior es con referencia únicamente al registro fósil… pero hay incontables otra pruebas de que la evolución es más ficción que realidad.<br>  <br>  Actualmente se están adoptando criterios aún más inverosímiles, por ejemplo, algunos científicos han llegado a la conclusión de que la vida no pudo haber surgido espontáneamente en la Tierra. En vez de creer eso, teorizan que tiene que haberse originado en el espacio sideral y entonces haber bajado flotando a la Tierra. Pero eso solo empuja más hacia atrás, y hasta un escenario más prohibitivo, el problema del origen de la vida. Los peligros con que se enfrenta la vida en el ambiente hostil del espacio sideral son bien conocidos. Entonces, ?es probable que la vida haya empezado espontáneamente en algún otro lugar en el universo y sobrevivido en medio de tales duras condiciones para llegar a la Tierra, y después haberse desarrollado en la vida como la conocemos?<br>  <br>  ?LA CREACION ES ABSOLUTA!|`|bae2bff6f12c3e1e0c5c8620b6f6eeffaa	LA EVOLUCIóN, por supuesto|`|be2287891b45c034e57bdfc8f11a1312aa	estamos en la era de la evolución  por lo tanto nada de fanatismos tenemos que tener la mente abierta y vivir al día con la evolución suerte|`|d51f4071025290657c0a4082a89d4935aa	Creo en la teoria evolutiva.

Don't tell them. I had to come out of the closet at the very beginning of my awareness of  myself and it was a HEAVY cross to bare. The best thing to do is do it slowly and find out how they feel about it first. Don't rush into telling them unless it is life or death. U could lose a lot. Then again they could be understanding and there for you.  <br>  It is a very tough decision. If you are young find a support group in your area. Parents have been known to kick there kids out because of it.  It is a hard decision to tell. Just be ready for the worst because you never know. Good Luck.|`|70439f4f789775f1e09ca28cf190cc31aa	My advice is to save news that may freak your parents out until you are self-supporting.

It can also depend on whether you live with them or not - if not, you can probably tell them because if they take it badly you don't have to   put up with crap 24/7. If you do live with them, I really wouldn't reccommend telling them unless you KNOW they would react supportively. I have too many friends who have been kicked out or bullied by their parents for being gay - don't let it happen to you.|`|9aadb7c307e5e3d267dbef9a61cd4449aa	Don't bother son.

And somebody said it already but I’ll say it again, tell your mother first. My mom said she always knew, and she was ok with it. Even if your mom isn’t ok with it, she probably will be more understanding then your dad. Dad’s just take it harder, my dad found out 3 days ago, and were still ok, but he doesn’t talk to me as much and he hasn’t spoken to me about me being gay at all. Do any of your friends know? I would tell them if they don’t before your family, chances are they’ll all be totally cool with it and it makes it easier to tell everybody else. But do it when you’re totally ready, and be true to yourself. If it’s who you are the people who love you will accept it, it might be hard, it might take a while but they will all accept it. Remember, “Those who mind don’t matter, and those who matter don’t mind”

<br>  Tú a el igual que mis amigas vas a el medico cada no se cuando pero se que si vas a diversos asuntos medicos no se papanicolao, mamografias, que se yo, bueno esto del aborto se puderia evitar si yo como hombre usaria condon en cada una de mis relaciones sexuales o de plano me operara que no ?? bueno ustedes como mujeres se implantan una gran infinidad de aparatos para no embarazarce y nosotros los hombres ?? yo como hombre no me preucupo por si me tome una pildora o si el diu ya me lo tengo que cambiar ahora el aborto se suma a otro motivo para ir a el medico por parte de las mujeres como si no fuera suficiente, ahora yo soy un machista a el 100 bueno ya para que me pongo condon ?? si la mujer puede abortar o para que me opero eso que lo haga la mujer no crees ??<br>  pero que bueno que no soy machista yo si fuera mujer pediria una penalizacion al no uso del condon o sea darle a la mujer la oportunidad de exijirle a el hombre el simple acto de colocarce un condon, pero esto es asi ?? o exigir que el hombre a determinada edad o numero de hijos se opere para evitarle a las mujeres la incomodiad de ir a un hospital a abortar, pero bueno la mayoria de las mujres como que no saben lo que quieren solo se dejan ir a pesar que son mas inteligentes que nosotros los hombres.<br>  <br>  las mujeres en vez de salir a exigir su "libre" derecho a abortar deberian de salir a pedir que haya igualdad de genero no cres osea que dentro de estas igualdades esten leyes que apoyen el estudio de la forma de elavorar antoconceptivos masculinos ya que para las mujeres hay miles y para el hombre ?? y mira el hombre es el que ocaciona por su machismo los embarazos no deceados mis amigas siempre cargan su pildora o su condon y aparte traen su parche me imagino que la mayoria de las mujeres son mas responsables en ese sentido ya vez el dicho "pobre mujer no se cuido" esto lo dicen cuando se embaraza sin querer, y que el hombre no cuenta en un embarazo ??

Aún así, el buitre continuaba viniendo. Sin saberlo, éste se comía las ratas que abundaban en el edificio.<br>  <br>  El sabio del rey solo observaba.<br>  <br>  Un día, los enemigos lograron llegar hasta la habitación del rey. Afuera, estaba la paloma que los miró sin moverse o hacer cualquier gesto excepto comer. Pero cuando los soldados enemigos se acercaron al peque?o hijo del rey, que ahí se encontraba, el buitre los atacó fuertemente. Asustados, empezaron a gritar y pronto los guardias aparecieron, capturándolos.<br>  <br>  Más tarde, el rey se reunió con su sabio y conversaron sobre lo que había sucedido.<br>  <br>  -Creo que de ahí podemos aprender algo muy importante, majestad.<br>  <br>  -Y ?qué lección podemos extraer de tan insólita situación, sabio?<br>  <br>  -No siempre lo que parece bonito a los ojos es realmente leal. Aunque la paloma haya sido alimentada todo este tiempo, no hizo nada para defender a los que la alimentaron. <br>  <br>  El buitre, sin embargo, sí fue capaz de defenderlo, a pesar de su aspecto desagradable. En realidad, creo que él es más bello que la paloma, pues sus actos así lo fueron.<br>  <br>  -Usted tiene toda la razón. Desde luego, mis guardias ya tienen órdenes expresas de alimentar el buitre, como gratitud por lo que hizo.<br>   <br>  Así, el buitre terminó su vida muy bien alimentado y sin sufrir más persecuciones, mientras la paloma por algo dejó de aparecer en el castillo. <br>  <br>  "No todos lo hombres malos pueden llegar a ser buenos, <br>  pero no hay ningún hombre bueno que no haya sido malo alguna vez."|`|zRljRoCbaa	Nosotros somos los culpables de la maldad, por lo tanto nosotros debemos solucionarla o erradicarla.|`|3a8be8b383b627043e0e011840dccccfaa	Ahora te pregunto ingeniudad hecha gente....<br>  <br>  Porque no lo haces tu???<br>  Que haces para que haya menos maldad???<br>  Haz pensado dejar de criticar y ponerte a hacer algo ???<br>  Menuda chorrada....<br>  <br>  Porque toda la culpa la tiene Dios porque no podemos decir que nosotros somos los culpables...<br>  No busques juzgar a un ser perfecto porque tu no estas en la posicion para hacerlo...|`|40db37568fbb3e96fac455a31371d471aa	si, no existe, y ya, por eso...|`|5148ac1f38ec7754063eb6c55508dbbcaa	????y ke acaso bruce willis y silvester stalone no cuentan?!!!!|`|8e3085634e14d7dfa9992f92dd1891a0aa	Dios existe no lo dudes, pero dejame explicarte simplemente para que entiendas, como funciona mas o menos esto...<br>  Te aseguro que tus padres  a pesar de todo lo malo que puedieras ser (ladrón, asesino, embaucador, egoista, etc) jamas te dejaría solo, nunca te faltaria tu cama, ni comida, siempre tendrás su cari?o, por que a pesar de todo él igual nos ama...ahora bién, tu eres quien decide ser un buen o mal hijo, independiente de los malos consejos, las malas modas, las pesimas amistades o esa vocesita que te dice que hagas algo "indebido".<br>  La tentación no es mala, la virtud es vencerla, cada uno de nosotros podemos hacer un mundo mejor, tan solo corrigiendonos...hay un dicho que dice algo asi : "... para que venzan los hombres malos, solo es necesario que los hombres buenos no hagan nada"<br>  Solo la suma de personas como tu, pueden hacer este mundo mejor<br>  Saludos y un abrazo|`|9167deb2cbdb8aa9be83decf370e03d2aa	Esta de paro,hace mas de 2000 a?os.

Si Dios hubiera ejecutado inmediatamente a Adán y Eva, a raíz de haber pecado ellos, ninguno de nosotros estaría vivo hoy. Seguro que eso no es lo que hubiéramos querido. Además, si en una época posterior Dios hubiera destruido a todos los pecadores, nosotros no habríamos nacido. El que Dios haya permitido que este mundo pecaminoso haya existido hasta ahora nos ha dado la oportunidad de vivir y aprender Sus caminos, hacer los cambios necesarios en nuestra vida y aprovecharnos de Sus provisiones amorosas para la vida eterna. El que Jehová nos haya dado esta oportunidad es prueba de gran amor por parte de él. <br>  <br>  La Biblia muestra que Dios ha fijado un tiempo para destruir a este sistema inicuo, y lo destruirá pronto. (Habacuc 2:3: "Porque la visión es todavía para el tiempo se?alado, y sigue jadeando hasta el fin, y no dirá mentira. Aun si tardara, manténte en expectación de ella; porque sin falta se realizará.

Mira cuando yo veo a Paris ilton disfrutando la vida sin merecerlo ni hacer nada y luego veo gente muriendo de hambre sin haber hecho nada ni merecerlo, pienso: ?Que habrá hecho Paris para estar ahí y que de malo habrán hecho todos los demás para pudrirse de hambre? Y entonces llego a la conclusión de que Dios no existey que como mucho existe la reencarnación o algo superior por ahí suelto. Per no el Dios cristiano. Piensalo bien. ?Le ves sentido? No. Porque no existe y aferrarse a él es absurdo. Simplemente vive que la vida es corta y olviate dereligiones y tonterias. Si quieres cree en el infierno y el cielo pero olvidate de Dios, de virgen maria, espiritu santo y esas tonterias estupidas.|`|1hfSIt0waa	jajaja, Bueno...tu pregunta se la hacen muchas personas que se detiene para ver como esta el mundo desde una perspectiva de juzgar a Dios...sabes que? tu no conoces a Dios, yo le conozco, nunca lo he visto pero el siempre me cuida,lo conozco a medida que leo su palabra y oro sin cesar,  Dios no puede actuar si las personas no le dejan, si el toca tu corazon y tu se lo habres el entrara y estara contigo pero EL MUNDO NI SE ACUERDA DE EL, no porque no sea importante sino porque se ha aumentado el pecado, y este separa al Hombre de Dios...no mires al mundo, mira tu vida, entregasela a el, Estamos en los ultimos Dias y pronto sera el lloro y crujir de dientes para quienes lo hayan negado!!!!!|`|7f4b15b584aea3818a3b8499d660b6aeaa	A ver.

It happened!

7c0b8d463941e2e4efdf88578930d8edaa	volapuk supposedly has hundreds of conjugated forms for any given verb. you can inflect a verb to show person, number, mood, voice, tense, aspect, etc. so there's a lot to remember. but it's all very regular with no exceptions. so i guess you could always figure out a form if you forget it. i don't recall if it has a complex case system or anything like that. i'm pretty sure it's just the verbs that people disliked.<br>  <br>  really though, the real reason for a lot of the dislike back when the language was first invented was the "foreignness" of the words. i'm sure you already know that "volapuk" is based on the words "vol" and "puk", which come from the english words "world" and "speak". they're pretty modified though, and people didn't like that. esperanto is easily recognizable and just looks like another romance language, and that appealed a lot more to the people at the time.|`|2e70f61678e5494169ede4a28e641c3daa	According to Wikipaedia, Esperanto is easier, and for this reason largely displaced Volapuk.

DCP5jXzhaa	You are a 12 year old boy and you were experimenting (sort of forced into it, wouldn′t you say?).  From books on sexuality that I have read, it is commonly accepted that about 25% or 1/4 of the male population has experimented at least once with a same-sex encounter.  Obviously, some of that group is, in fact, homosexual.  But over half of this experimenting group is, in fact, heterosexual.  So... where does that leave you?  <br>  <br>  It happened, you learned something.  That is what life is all about.  Whether you are gay or hetero, you will learn in the future.<br>  <br>  Now, a final thought.  About your friend pulling down your parts and touching you.  NO ONE has the right to "do" things to you unless you want him to.  That means pulling down your pants, touching you, and at some probable future other sexual things.  Respect yourself and define the limits.  This is also part of learning in life.<br>  <br>  Whatever you do and however things turn out, please take care of yourself so you can enjoy a long, happy, and productive life.|`|42c52e567bed68e9b0de173ab6f30a20aa	no it doesn't mean your gay.

AoNRjMQnaa	Il fatto è che Dio è stato creato a immagine e somiglianza dall'uomo (non viceversa) dal momento che l'uomo ha costruito la religione come strumento di regolamentazione morale ma nonsolo della propria vita. Escludo quindi la creazione, il fango, il soffio e la costola.<br>  All'inizio dei tempi c'erano atomi molto semplici sul pianeta terra. Noi sappiamo che una delle basi della vita è il Carbonio, mentre in origine tutto era Idrogeno e poco altro. Eistein ha scoperto l'eistenza della fusione nucleare e grazie ad essa è possibile comprendere come all'interno delle stelle le sostanze più semplici si possano convertire in altre più complesse, anche il Carbonio. Dal momento che i pianeti sono solo pezzetti di stelle "sputate fuori" a causa della rotazione, ci ritroviamo con elementi di vita presenti anche da noi. (Avrai sentito che anche le comete si portano dietro "pezzi di vita" ipotetica) Tuttavia il "mettere insieme" i pezzi non è un gioco da ragazzi. Io che non sono credente propendo a pensare che ci siano stati miliardi di tentativi di combinazioni andanti a male prima della nascita della prima combinazkione "giusta" che ha portato alla vita. Un credente penserà, invece, che Dio abbia semplicmente messo assieme le particelle e detto abra cadabra.<br>  La sola differenza è che nel primo caso l'evoluzione è durata milioni di anni, nel secondo non c'è stata affatto.<br>  PS scusa non avevo letto l'ultima parte: non c'è modo di saperlo anche se si potrebbe ipotizzare un universo a "fisarmonica" che alla fine di una llunga fase di espansione torni indietro collassi e ricominci da capo: la materia sarebbe sempre la stessa l'energia potrebbe essere fornita da quelle quantità enormi accumulate nei buchi neri.<br>  Le comete sono ggetti del sistema solare prorpio come i pianeti, Qualcuno sostiene che ce ne siano molti miliardi a distanze abissali dal Sole e che solo poche, per disavventura (urti con altri oggetti) siano deviate verso l'interno del sistema solare e diventino visibil anche a noi.|`|L98a4HQYaa	Dio ci chiede d aver Fede....<br>  poi ci dice che questo e il Mistero della Fede...<br>  e tu qui..vorresti risolvere il tutto con un domandina??? ahahah<br>  troppo facile amico... <br>  Ciao|`|5816e9a3b8c59abaa0b95cab1526e060aa	Dio è la causa non causata.|`|60b1b7644e9edc499c113566e1e4c7dfaa	Potrebbe essere accaduto che all'inizio dell'universo, vari atomi si siano aggregati casualmente, spinti da forze di attrazione. Da questi aggregati casuali, forse sono nate le prime cellule e quindi la prima vita. Ora ci si potrebbe chiedere come è stato possibile che da elementi non viventi si sia generato un elemento vivente. Noi consideriamo vivente ciò che nasce e che muore, ma consideriamo comunque che il "morire" sia dovuto dall'arresto delle funzioni corporali, le quali si svolgono mediante precise leggi chimiche e fisiche. Noi dunque non siamo altro che macchine governate dalle stesse leggi che muovono il "non vivente". Penso che quindi i nostri pensieri non siano altro che processi chimici. La vita dunque non esiste e perciò tutto ciò che c'è è puramente casuale. Spero di essermi spiegato. Notte|`|Qh3DA27paa	Magari quella che noi chiamiamo vita in realtà è una esperienza extrasensoriale e la realtà è un'altra. Magari a te sembra di essere un umano,quando magari stai solo sognando ed in realtà sei un'altra forma di vita per la quale tutte le risposte già ci sono...<br>  <br>  Ho un pò sonno e svalvolo....|`|QkAYCpIzaa	No funziona questo ABC, per verificare l'otografia.....capirai che non sono italiano.<br>  Vuoi una risposta proprio dei misteri della vita. Purtroppo, non sanno spiegarlo neanche i scientifici, hanno solo teorie. Un conto sono le cose dimostrabilli, un altro la fede. Il primo é ancora in sviluppo nella ricerca de risposte ogni volte piú sodisfacenti e sempre ad essere giudicate secondo nuove scoperte, pensa solo a prima o dopo Newton, Galileo, Einstein, il secondo...é chiusso. Tu parli del Big Bang, dove e nato tutto, questa splossione che ancora oggi ci porta viaggiando a una grandissima velocitá che non riusciamo a percipire, perché nostro  riferimento é il nostro sistema solare, e queste viaggia insieme a tutta la galassia, alaontandossi de altre, generando spazio, che prima non essisteva (questo e duretto da spiegare e capire), ma immagina al universo come un pallone che si gonfia, immagina che le gallassie sono puntini disegnati nel pallone, piú gonfi questo pallone, piú si alaontanano questi puntini....e viaggia anche materia, particelle, ecc. Una teoria é questa che arrivano  orgsnismi alla terra e si trovano con le condizioni ideale di atmosfera, ecc, per svilupare vida. Poi é veramente bello e raro, il fato di questo gia che una volta svilupate qui, la terra doveba avere un giro su se stessa giusto per avere il giorno e la notte che dano la luce e il calore che si bisogna per crescere (fotosintesi, piante, civo), la luna ferma con la sua forza il giro della terra, e cosi il giorno e diverso di una volta, ha piú ore...poi la distanza che abbiamo dal sole, la protezione di Giove come scudo ....sono tantisime le cose che hanno permesso che si possa svilupare la vita in questo pianeta.<br>  Tornando allo studio del big bang, posso dirti che ci saranno delle novitá negli prossimi anni, gia che per capire cosa é sucesso nei primi 100.000 anni dopo il big bang, bisogna fare uno studio su delle particelle che arrivano dello spazio a grandissima velocitá (raggi cosmici) che passano atraverso tutto, e continuano il suo viaggio dopo la terra, queste particelle vengono studiate con laboratori molto precisi, ultima tecnologia e questa informazione ancora non c'é. Manca moltissimo prima di avicinarse ad avere risposte di questo tipo. Poi il mistero di Dio, e la scenza non devono essere per forza due cose oposte. No é che essita uno per la ignoranza del altro, é proprio fede, e questa puó essere stata insegnata a te come una maniera per vivere o trovare spiegazioni, o per propria sperienza, dove alcune cose miracolose ti colpiscono al punto di credere veramente a un essere speciale che ti protegge nei peggiori momenti.

efbc641c6f14b72226afd50f702ce4c2aa	I believe that in order to understand what other religions believe, you must study them first.  I feel that ignorance is far more dangerous than knowledge.

AA11276475	There is nothing wrong with you. You live in denial of your true self, that is fine with me, but unfortunately not so fine with you. You just cannot have it both ways...you are bisexual, not straight..so join the club and big deal. But, it might be nice were you to be honest about this, at least to yourself. The guilt comes from one of two places...your attitude towards gays (get over yourself, dude) or being unfaithful to your wife (no matter what's your excuse, no matter who you have sex with, it is still infidelity). As far as intentions go, who the hell knows what goes on in anyone's mind who sets out to make another like them..and yes, we absolutely DO set out to make friends, and that means we set out to make them like us. Big deal (again). Welcome to the real world.|`|AA11213156	If you're married now, ask your wife if you can have a threesome with another man.  If you're single, go for single men or for married men whose wives are involved.  Don't break up a marriage, it's not cool.|`|6356f7c9b2ffd70eb0e558bc216e9317aa	Nothing is wrong with you your just having a difficult time dealing with your sexual attraction.

You're a homophobe.  Don't worry, so are lots of other homosexuals.<br>  <br>  Leave the married men alone.  You want to be with men, not ruin lives.  Accept this...the sooner, the better.<br>  <br>  Your sexuality isn't there for you to fight, it's for you to enjoy!|`|86446cd24dee636174001e6343d3083aaa	What is is called is repressed homosexuality. or possibility bisexuality. <br>  <br>  YOU ARE NOT SICK. And there is really nothing wrong! MAN has the ability to be a loving careing being and that ability is not restricited to the opposite sex. Being attracted to other men is simply an extension of the persons need to be able to express their care and love for another being. <br>  <br>  Granted that if you are married and the ones you have an attractions for are married. That makes things very difficult. <br>  I am a gay man who happens to be married to a woman. Yes I am by classic definetion Bi sexual but my preference is men. But he's married to a woman. When I was younger I knew I was gay. But when I was younger it was tabboo to have a relationship with a man. As a teen I fooled around. I had a male lover for several years. Our relationship broke up and I went looking for another partner. But I wanted kids too. So when I ran accross a very wonderful woman that understood how I felt, because I did tell her, we formed a wonderful relationship. We have three kids, 10 grand kids and 7 great grand kids. <br>  <br>  But I still perfer men. Go figure. I have come to terms with myself. It sounds like you never had the opportunity to and are just now begining to explore that portion of you psyche.<br>  <br>  How have I managed? I have remainded faithful to my marriage vows and resigned my self to my current fate. I do not recommend being unfaithful to your wife. That will cause you guilt beyond what most people are able to stand and will eventually lead to divorce. Which will be good for no one. <br>  <br>  I would get in touch with PFLAG. It is an organization for families with members who are gay. They have access to coucliors that are friendly to the gay/bi community. <br>  <br>  Good luck you are going to need it. It is a very difficult life in a society that has nothing but hate and intolerance for people who are "different"|`|xNBwVPV7aa	You'll relax once you get into a heavy butt-pounding session.<br>  <br>  Trust me.|`|siunfboPaa	Nothings 'wrong' with you persay, however, it would seem there is something wrong w/ the choices you've made for yourself as you seem confused & unhappy.<br>  <br>  If you're looking to have a relationship outside of your marriage, you probably should re-examine your marriage.<br>  <br>  You ABSOLUTELY should inform your wife of any sexual contact you have outside of your marriage, male or female. She has the right to know if her health is being compromised.<br>  <br>  As for your co-worker, he's chosen to be your friend regardless of your intentions.  You need to decide if you really want to be his friend even though your feelings are not reciprocated....and respect the fact that they're not.<br>  <br>  Your sexuality & your lifestyle are your business, however, it's your responsitility to be honest with those who trust & love you, as well as yourself.<br>  <br>  Best of luck & strength in finding your happiness!

I only moved from Newfoundland to Ontario and I had to change alot of my habbits, and start speaking differently just so I wouldn't have to repeat myself so much. <br>   You should definatly have a working understanding of the language, even though most people speak english in europe. also curtious greetings, or things we do that are rude there have to be taken into consideration. <br>  What the person does at home is their own buisness just as immigrants speak thier native language here, and celebrate their own holidays and customs people moving abroad could easily do the same .<br>  Some things just aren't possible to maintain, the foods your used to might not be availible in the area you live in. and laws differe from country to country<br>  Generally you just have to be respectful to their culture.|`|e345a2da33c7b738910db303b6d6ee31aa	Yes, while it's ok to keep some original culture. Adopting the language and core customs of the new culture is key to having a functioning society.

Year after year after year, I get to watch all the homos hook up with one another, while I get to sleep - and grow old - ALONE!<br>  <br>  Is this FAIR? No, I don't THINK so!

6ec6afa27ccfe7badb1528fec2817bfcaa	online translators don't work really well, they make a lot of mistakes. They are only of some use to translate a single word, but even then they pick a single word, and if you don't know the foreign language too well you get (for instance) for "to park" (as in the verb putting a car some place) a word for "to green spot in a city". I have seen answers here about latin phrases that ended up in complete and utter nonsense... I find them only useful for finding words I can't remember of a language of which I already know a bit more than the basics..<br>  I always use       <a href="http://babelfish.altavista.com/tr" rel="nofollow">http://babelfish.altavista.com/tr</a> , but that does not have latin.

Many teens and parents have major communication breakdown and, with the introduction of all sorts of electronic distraction devices (MySpace, i-pods, cell phones, etc.), the distance between parents and teens is even greater than when i was a teen.  Divorce is also a major issue with teens.  It happens so frequently now...it is not uncommon any more.

w9PbvQNlaa	There are many reasons for errant prophesies some already mentioned are: man's sin, man's flesh, man's bent to glorify himself, man not receiving word from God, man manipulating other people, man giving false hope for his own benefit, Satan's continued endeavor to keep man separated from God, man's desire to hear false prophesy, etc.<br>  God can not be held responsible for the actions or lack of action of men. <br>  When a man or woman becomes a Christian they are then more accountable for what they do or don't do. Yes, we are to test spirit's, we are to judge one another in love, we are not to continue to act as if we are still lost or as if we don't know where to find answers and we need to to stop living as though we are powerless. We are not to be passive any more... we need to be taking action...going with power.<br>  We should be able to learn to be more discerning. This can only come through knowing the will of God. This can only come through knowing God and this comes through knowing his Word and words. For this we need the Power of the Holy Spirit. <br>  There are also ways that man can falsify prophesy that we should be aware of : eg. using the skill of discernment; deep levels of hypnosis are said to be able to look into future and past events (this is real stuff); even basic hypnosis can be used to make a statement then say it is a prophesy by using what is known as the power of sudjestion ;there are people that are very good at being able to know what people think by the subconcious body language they express; there are also people who can use the laws of probability to make edjecated guesses or statements; then there is the accult which is the worse.<br>  Also, If the man is a man of God he may have the wisdom to make a very powerful statement that is based on Biblical principles: eg. 1 Corithians 7 Paul says (ESV)<br>  1 Cor 7:6 Now as a consession, not a command I say this<br>  1 Cor 7:8 To unmarried and the widows I say that...<br>  -compare to-<br>  1 Cor 7:10 To the married I give this charge (not I but the Lord)<br>  -compare to-<br>  1 Cor 7:12 To the rest I say (I, not the Lord)<br>  1 Cor 7:25 Now concerning the brethren, I have no command from the Lord, but as I give my judgement as one who by the Lord's mercy is trustworthy.<br>   There is a clear distinction between what Paul says and what he says comes from the Lord.<br>  We should have the same caution when we say that God says something. Is it really what God says or is it what we say?|`|f8ff1f4ae6939ca181d099d16c1e3c23aa	because the men make it up... God's word is right... but men aren't.  they may think God tells them what is going to happen, but this is for the ego's of these men that prophesy.

The founder of the church made more mistakes than most and it is still not looked upon... makes no sense|`|AA10002921	I have heard the same thing. But what comes out of the mouth of a preacher should never be put on the same level as scripture. Rather, Paul commands us to test the spirits and see whether or not they are of God. Only the Bible has proven to be 100% in regard to prophecy. Everyone I have heard prophesy, I get the same stats as you.<br>  But I also noticed that not ONE said, "Thus saith the Lord." This would then have huge consequences if it were not true.|`|1UZuLF4Iaa	The preacher may be false, or you forgot that our timing is not Gods timing.|`|AA11374244	l&ll John- You need to test the spirits.

In my own life as well as others I know, but on the other hand I have seen some that didn't come to pass. When people prophecy, they can sometimes prophecy out of their own human carnality. The Bible refers to it as the flesh. It is when one is prophesying out of the spirit directed by the Holy Spirit, it comes to pass and is from God. All prophecy should always line up with the word of God and is for exhortation, edification and comfort. If it doesn't do any of these then throw it out.<br>  <br>  I would love to see scripture on the first answer...There isn't any.|`|VvjKOpvcaa	according to the bible, anyone who predicts the future is Satan's servant. Thus, all the prophets in the Bible are Satan's servants.|`|hpP270zOaa	There have been meny people over the centuries who were as Jesus was, a person whom god chose to communicate directly with for the execution of some specific task.  When god communicates with a person, he proves who he is by describing something that is going to happen in the fufture, and when that event happens, the communicant knows that it was indeed god, and not his imagination   Some have told of these experiences and became known as "prophets" (the ability so see the future).  Jesus was one of the more successful of these "prophets" because he was able to organize a very effective anti-slavery movement that plagued the Roman nobility for 300 years until the Emperor Constantine I devised a means of neutralizing it and controlling and managing and retaining their slaves through an organization called christianity that made Jesus it's tyrannical deity.|`|kDzaQC9waa	You may say to yourselves, "How can we know when a message has not been spoken by the LORD?" 22 If what a prophet proclaims in the name of the LORD does not take place or come true, that is a message the LORD has not spoken. That prophet has spoken presumptuously. No one should be alarmed. Deut 18:21-22<br>  False Prophet...it only takes one to be a false prophet|`|lMEnVxLfaa	There are many people who speak false "prophecies".  The Bible says that we are not to believe those men.  God's word is always true but there are guys who speak their own.  We are not to believe in them.  God's word is the Bible and it contains the prophesies.  It's in Revelation.|`|sbPRqXLnaa	In 1 Corinthians 14: 32-33, and this just means that because you think something or a thought comes to you, you can submit that thought BEFORE you say it or speak it out, to the other prophets to see if there is agreement.<br>  God says in verse 29 of this chapter that only two or three shold speak and the let the other JUDGE!  Every word out of a person with the gift of prophecy isn't necessarily God's words. Men miss it sometimes, but then AFTER you get "a word" it is up to us to take it to the Lord and see if it is true for you or not. <br>  Bless the church and bless the Lord and those who are serving as His body. Are YOU infallible? Have you been sure of hearing from the Lord and realized it wasn't quite like that?<br>  The body is growing.

We will be paying honor to the veterans who have served our country.  The age range of the people in our family will be from 9-50.

Slowly the flag took hold, offering a colorful and optimistic alternative to the more common pink triangle symbol. Today it is recognized by the International Congress of Flag Makers, and is flown in lesbian and gay pride marches worldwide. In 1989, the rainbow flag received nationwide attention after John Stout successfully sued his landlords in West Hollywood, when they prohibited him from displaying the flag from his apartment balcony. Meanwhile, Baker is still in San Francisco, and still making more flags. <br>  <br>  The Rainbow Flag by Steven W. Anderson appeared in GAZE Magazine (Minneapolis), #191, on 28 May 1993, p. 25: <br>  <br>  Color has long played an important role in our community's expression of pride. In Victorian England, for example, the color green was associated with homosexuality. The color purple (or, more accurately, lavender) became popularized as a symbol for pride in the late 1960s - a frequent post-Stonewall catchword for the gay community was "Purple Power". And, of course, there's the pink triangle. Although it was first used in Nazi Germany to identify gay males in concentration camps, the pink triangle only received widespread use as a gay pop icon in the early 1980s. But the most colorful of our symbols is the Rainbow Flag, and its rainbow of colors - red, orange, yellow, green, blue, and purple - represents the diversity of our community. <br>  <br>  The first Rainbow Flag was designed in 1978 by Gilbert Baker, a San Francisco artist, who created the flag in response to a local activist's call for the need of a community symbol. (This was before the pink triangle was popularly used as a symbol of pride.) Using the five-striped "Flag of the Race" as his inspiration, Baker designed a flag with eight stripes: pink, red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet. According to Baker, those colors represented, respectively: sexuality, life, healing, sun, nature, art, harmony, and spirit. Baker dyed and sewed the material for the first flag himself - in the true spirit of Betsy Ross. <br>  <br>  Baker soon approached San Francisco's Paramount Flag Company about mass producing and selling his "gay flag". Unfortunately, Baker had hand-dyed all the colors, and since the color "hot pink" was not commercially available, mass production of his eight-striped version became impossible. The flag was thus reduced to seven stripes. <br>  <br>  In November 1978, San Francisco's gay community was stunned when the city's first openly gay supervisor, Harvey Milk, was assassinated, Wishing to demonstrate the gay community's strength and solidarity in the aftermath of this tragedy, the 1979 Pride Parade Committee decided to use Baker's flag. The committee eliminated the indigo stripe so they could divide the colors evenly along the parade route - three colors on one side of the street and three on the other. Soon the six colors were incorporated into a six-striped version that became popularized and that, today, is recognized by the International Congress of Flag Makers. <br>  <br>  In San Francisco, the Rainbow Flag is everywhere: it can be seen hanging from apartment windows throughout the city (most notably in the Castro district), local bars frequently display the flag, and Rainbow Flag banners are hung from lampposts on Market Street (San Francisco's main avenue) throughout Pride Month. Visiting the city, one can not help but feel a tremendous sense of pride at seeing this powerful symbol displayed so prominently. <br>  <br>  Although the Rainbow Flag was initially used as a symbol of pride only in San Francisco, it has received increased visibility in recent years. Today, it is a frequent sight in a number of other cities as well - New York, West Hollywood, and Amsterdam, among them. Even in the Twin Cities, the flag seems to be gaining in popularity. Indeed, the Rainbow Flag reminds us that ours is a diverse community - composed of people with a variety of individual tastes of which we should all be proud. <br>  <br>  Sources used for this article were found at Quatrefoil Library in St. Paul, and include: "Vexed by Rainbows", by Paul Zomcheck, in "Bay Area Reporter" (June 26, 1986); "Rainbow Flag" in "The Alyson Almanac" (1989); and "The Rainbow Flag", in "Parade 90: San Francisco Gay/Lesbian Freedom Day Parade and Celebration" (June 24, 1990)|`|e66c71f0c50e7672789a78265879bdc5aa	The many colorful parts of our community.|`|AA11116434	My straight friends said that they want the rainbow back.

This denotation goes back to the rainbow as a symbol of biblical promise when God gave the sign to Noah that there would never be a flood like the one that happened then ever again. The use of all the colours of the rainbow symbolizes all flags of gay people.Already in the German Peasants' War of the 16th century, the rainbow flag together with the peasants' boot ("Bundschuh") was used as the sign of a new era, of hope and of social change.<br>  <br>  The reformer Thomas Müntzer connected socially revolutionary claims with his preaching of the gospel. He is often portrayed with a rainbow flag in his hand. The Thomas Müntzer statue in the German town of Stolberg also shows him holding a rainbow flag in his hand.<br>  <br>  There are several, unrelated rainbow flags in use today, with the flag of the Rainbow family being an obvious example. The most widely known is perhaps the flag representing gay pride. The peace flag is especially popular in Italy and the cooperative flag symbolizes international cooperation. There are also other, less well known rainbow flags as well as other flags of a similar design but different purpose (such as the European flag "barcode" style).|`|wsNjQwfnaa	That is kind of weird, I mean they took refracted light you can't do that people.

I don't know how his parents don't beat him, the way he talks to them and others - they won't do anything to discipline him (in my opinion).  That's probably why he's such a jerk.<br>  <br>  I'm not one for spanking children, but some kids don't respond to anything else.  I'm a teacher and some of the kids would do so much better in school if there was the threat of spanking hanging over their heads.  Then there's other kids who all you have to do is talk with them and they straighten right up.  Every kid is different.  They shouldn't have taken spanking out of schools, because it is an effective deterrent. Most kids wouldn't actually need to be spanked, just the few causing the majority of problems.

Do you consider that UNIVERSAL???<br>  <br>  I don't, it's a part of their culture as is BLUES, JAZZ ,HIP HOP, R&B, ROCK is a part of BLACK CULTURE, there is nothing wrong with wanting to keep what originated with us within our "field" so to speak.

HELL YES, I enjoy other pple's  music.|`|x0jbfxl3aa	There is a lot more to black music (music generally performed by blacks and dominate in the black culture or making relations to black culture) than rap and r&b.

Wk2E4fmVaa	There are a lot of ludicrous stereotypes of the US in Russia -- including that movie tickets cost $400, that toilets don't flush excrement, and that you must pay a fee in the hundreds of dollars to enter Manhattan.  More than any other people I know, Russians believe what they want to believe.  It's a cultural thing.

7eb1e90849f4b135c41291426e9941d1aa	(1) To clarify... 'belief' in the way we define belief isn't sufficient for salvation... in the gospels, the primary issue for the Jews was 'belief' in the sense of acceptance/signing-on that Jesus was the Messiah. <br>  <br>  (2) Bottom line, God has the latitude to make his own decision about who is saved and who isn't.  Therefore, if all the person has to work with is the scenario you described, and God felt in essence he did what he could, absolutely this person could be saved.  <br>  <br>  It does not invalidate knowing the rest of the Bible.  It's one thing to be unable to access the rest of the Bible, and another thing to be unwilling.  Again, God lays down the parameters of salvation in the Bible, but he makes the final call.  On the flip side, just because someone went through all the outwards steps of salvation doesn't mean that God *has* to accept them... what if they were just doing it to make their spouse happy?  At the end of the day, it's God's call.|`|pfNnuD5saa	No, the Bible is not necessary for salvation. They early Christians didn't have one. They would send around letters etc. There have been times and places where Bibles were banned or unavailable and still people became Christian. In medieval Europe, most people couldn't read and never read one word of the Bible.|`|wY8VyHkyaa	It's called Baptism of Desire.|`|100f3b822d2aae0d4998a7e0134e4d7eaa	Acts 8:26-40<br>  <br>  As Phillip joins the eunuch, he discovers that the Ethiopian was reading from a passage of Isaiah that we call one of the servant songs.  And when Phillip asks him if he understands the passage, the Ethiopian answers “how can I, unless someone guides me.”  What a profoundly intelligent remark – how can I gain understanding unless someone guides me?  It is the realization that on our own we can read all we want, but there must be guidance from someone who has more comprehension of the material in order for us to grown in our understanding.  We need teachers.  It might be self-evident, especially if we think about subject matters such as math or chemistry, but we need teachers of our faith as well, teachers of scripture are vital.  Unfortunately, sometimes there is the perception that Scripture is so easy to understand that there is no need to study, just read it on your own and you will understand.  The Ethiopian reminds us of the great fallacy of that when he states clearly the problem, how can I gain understanding unless someone guides me.  <br>  <br>  |`|GrKiEDb1aa	Reading the Bible does not save you.<br>  Only thing that is necessary for salvation is admitting you're a sinner, asking forgiveness for your sins and trusting Christ as Lord and Savior. One must make a CONSCIOUS decision to do that.  No book will ever save you.  People have trusted Christ as Lord and Savior and have been illiterate.|`|AA10014750	 I will give basically the same answer that I have given to other questions. It is God's call who gets 'heaven or hell' not mine presently!!!

They killed him not, they killed him not.  If you truly, truly love Jesus then worship the God he worshipped.  Pray to the God he prayed to.|`|c25bb4eeb8a23121abdbb64a43909abcaa	I love jesus with all my heart and all my soul. there is nothing better than knowing i have eternal life with him and he is always there for me whenever i need him. i am so lucky i have found jesus and i am so grateful he died for my sins on the cross. I have been so happy in life since i came to know him. Life has not always been a walk in the park but since i have him on my side i can always make it through. God never takes you somewhere he cannot help you through. He doesnt create junk and that is so amazing. I am only 15 but i have so much love and joy in my heart. I am not saying i am perfect or a perfect christian. I still sin and i still mess up but the best thing about it is God always forgives us no matter how badly we messed up or sinned. I am so glad i can share my religion freely and in a country i can do it freely in. I feel that God is calling me to go to a mission trip somewhere else in the world when i get older but i am not sure where or when. if you would just pray with/for me to help me see where i need to go and what i need to do. I am so glad you asked this question and i am so glad to answer. <br>  <br>  I <3 Jesus!

VtrdUooGaa	Yes, it is "kool" among teenagers to misspell many words.  The same tendency exists among young people in Russia, although in Russia it is even more of a problem.

If you type in "bellhop costume" in Google it will bring up a lot to choose from. You may even find one in one of those specialty Halloween stores that pop up this time of year. You can tear it up a bit, get some white makeup for your face, darken your eyes, a bit of blood of course, and there ya go, you're a zombie. |`|4KtPFzz5aa	Maybe something everyone could get in on, like the cast from a movie or t.v. show.<br>  Some ideas:<br>  The Wizard of Oz<br>  The Blues Brothers<br>  Saturday Night Live<br>  <br>  Stay away from politics or anything that people might have a strong opinion about.|`|YKzMEI7kaa	A pirate, ninja, or vampire.

Christ was not a prophet, and neither were any of his disciples.<br>  <br>  Paul, Timothy, etc, were not prophets -- they were teachers that expounded on the teachings of Jesus.

Juli 00:05<br>  also bin ich Krebs, leider ist mein Aszendent Stier, dh. bin ziemlich clever, nicht so ein wischi waschi Krebs.<br>  <br>  es schreibt dir gerade jemand der ca 5 verschiedene sternzeichen gut spueren kann...... :)<br>  <br>  und ja, es gibt unterschiede zw. sternzeichen. <br>  <br>  Meine logische Analyse ist, es sind ja die ersten eindruecke vom leben die sehr sehr am meisten zaehlen, jemand der im winter zur welt kommt ist halt anders, einfach nur ruhig und gelassen.... (ist ja das wetter so, wenig sonnenschein, alles still)<br>  ... *gott* beschuetze mich vor schuetze frauen...... <br>  <br>  Aber jemand der im Sommer zur Welt kommt strahlt nur voller Waerme (ist ja gewohnt ), zb Krebs ist eher stuermisch,...  (gewitter im Juli sind halt oefters ) Aber auch voller waerme <br>  <br>  Zb. Loewe ist auch so, aber doch, August, da ist es noch voll warm, normalerweise weniger gewitter.... <br>  keiner kann loewen schlagen, sie strahlen am waermsten. Ist so witzig aber war.<br>  <br>  Stier. Naja. :) richtung Zwilling. hehe :) Aber wirklich gute Leute. Haben auch Humor. Lustig.<br>  <br>  Fisch. Ah Fischfrauen. einfach suess. Frech frech aber voller sozialer kompetenz. Selbstbewusst, machnmal uebertrieben aber das passt schon. Ich liebe sie.<br>  <br>  Steinboecke, mit die habe ich noch nie zu tun gehabt.<br>  <br>  Skorpion. Huhu. Da kann koennte ich viel erzaehlen. Verdammt, mein Vater ist einer, ein guter  Freund von mir ist einer, die sind hart und hart. Diktatorisch. Frauen ? Hab ich gute Freundinne , sind oke. Aber irgendwie stoert es mich schon dass sie zuu selbstbewusst sind. Sie sind nicht total verspielt. Ich habe lange lange ueberlegt wieso Skorpione so sind wie sie sind. Oktober. Wird gerade Winter..... Sonne verschwindet.... vielleicht diese Angst, das sie so anders und hart macht. Aber im inneren sind sie verletzlich. <br>  <br>  so ca mal........ *gg*|`|0gBOCMTkaa	Die Sternzeichen sind aufgeteilt in:<br>  <br>  Element ERDE: Stier, Jungfrau, Steinbock<br>  Element LUFT: Zwillinge, Waage, Wassermann<br>  Element WASSER: Krebs, Skorpion, Fische<br>  Element FEUER:Widder, L?we, Schütze<br>  <br>  Den Sternzeichen sind auch Planeten zugeordnet.<br>  Auch bestimmt der Aszendent die Charaktere. Ein Stier ist nicht wie der andere Stier. ?hnlich ja, aber nicht identisch.<br>  <br>  Die verschiedenen Charaktere detailiert zu schreiben ist ein halber Roman.(Sorry)<br>  <br>  Lies doch mal "Was Ihr Sternzeichen verr?t".<br>  ISBN 3-632-98907-9<br>  <br>  Ich selber bin eine L?WIN mit Aszendenten Skorpion.<br>  L?wen sind lt.

Schicksalszahl ist die 1. L?wen lieben die Sonne.<br>  L?wen sollen auch optimistisch sein, leider auch Egoisten. L?wen wollen bewundert werden.<br>  Aber L?winnen sind, wie die im Tierreich auch, unerbittliche Verteidiger ihres Nachwuchses. Gro?zügig und  kontaktfreudig.....<br>  <br>  Der Rest sprengt diese Seite und diese Antwort. Kann das Buch empfehlen. <br>  <br>  Ich hab auch immer gedacht, das ist alles Humbuck.

Er erinnert ihn bei seinem Aufstieg in die H?he immer wieder an den Boden, der ihn tr?gt, ?ffnet ihn für die Gaben der Erde, die ihm Kraft, Schutz und Geborgenheit geben. So f?rdert er seine Bescheidenheit und hilft ihm, seine Aufgaben zum Wohl der Allgemeinheit zu erfüllen. <br>  Der Mondstein ist ein wichtiger Erg?nzungsstein für den Steinbock. Er wirkt einer Verh?rtung seines Wesens entgegen, hilft ihm, seine Gefühle anzunehmen und ihren Wert für eine ganzheitliche Entwicklung zu erkennen. Dieser Stein f?rdert das Vertrauen des Steinbocks in die Weisheit seines Herzens. Seine sanften Schwingungen sind in der Lage, gefühlsm??ige Blockaden aufzubrechen und sie helfen ihm, auch nach emotionalen Entt?uschungen offen für neue Erfahrungen zu bleiben. So unterstützt ihn der Mondstein auch dabei, zwischenmenschliche Beziehungen erfüllender zu gestalten. <br>  <br>  Der Obsidian l??t den Steinbock durch alle Schichten des Unterbewu?tseins hindurch das innere Licht finden. Er l?st die emotionalen Strukturen auf, die der Verwirklichung dieses Lichts im Wege stehen und hilft ihm, es auch unter den h?rtesten Anforderungen des Lebens zu bewahren. <br>  <br>  Die schwarze Perle erschlie?t dem Steinbock die Sch?nheit und den tiefen Glanz seines innersten Wesens. Sie l??t ihn erkennen, da? er Vollendung nur erreichen kann, wenn er sich selbst, anderen Menschen wie auch den Ereignissen des Lebens mit Verst?ndnis und einer Haltung des liebevollen Annehmens begegnet. Sie hilft ihm auf diese Weise auch, vor schmerzlichen Erfahrungen nicht auszuweichen, sondern sie in dem Wissen zu durchlaufen, da? ihm daraus gr??ere Vollkommenheit erwachsen kann. <br>  <br>  Grüner und schwarzer Turmalin f?rdern die Zielgerichtetheit des Steinbocks und ?ffnen ihn für spirituelle Energien. Mit ihrer Hilfe kann er die Hindernisse in seinem inneren und ?u?eren Leben aufl?sen, die der Verwirklichung auch seiner h?chsten Ziele im Wege stehen. Der grüne Turmalin verhilft ihm überdies zu Wohlstand und Wohlbefinden, w?hrend der schwarze Turmalin ihn seine Verantwortung, dem Licht zu dienen, erkennen und erfüllen l??t. <br>  <br>  Der Rauchquarz hilft dem Steinbock-Geborenen, bei all seinen T?tigkeiten in der Welt das Licht nicht zu vergessen, das in seinem innersten Wesen wie im Kern aller Dinge strahlt. Er l?st verfestigte Strukturen auf, die die Erkenntnis dieses Lichts behindern und unterstützt den Steinbock bei seiner Aufgabe, dem Licht in seinem pers?nlichen Leben wie auch im Leben anderer Menschen zu einer neuen Geburt zu verhelfen. <br>  <br>  Der Bergkristall, der dem Steinbock auch nach indianischer Tradition zugeordnet wird, l??t das Wesen des Steinbocks zu h?chster Klarheit wachsen. Er f?rdert seine F?higkeit zur Innenschau und Meditation und hilft ihm, selbst zu einem klaren Kristall zu werden, der die universalen Kr?fte des Lichts empf?ngt und weitergibt. Hierbei l?st er alles Dunkle auf und führt ihn zu der Erkenntnis des Einsseins mit dem g?ttlichen Urgrund des Lebens. <br>  <br>  Der Diamant unterstützt die F?higkeit des Steinbocks zur Konzentration auf das Wesentliche. Er hilft ihm, unbeirrbar seinen Weg zu den H?hen des Lebens zu gehen, alles hinter sich zu lassen, was nicht klar und rein ist und die unerl?sten emotionalen Strukturen in ihm selbst aufzuarbeiten. Er kann ihn, sobald er dafür bereit ist, zur h?chsten Vollendung führen, um den ganzen Reichtum und die Fülle des Lebens in einem inneren Einssein mit dem G?ttlichen zu finden und der Verbreitung dieses Wissens zu dienen|`|306c5b9f5a65431e111da977b50b0a7daa	Liebe Sonneblume- darüber gibt es 1001 Bücher- lies einfach nach und nimm nicht alles dabei zu w?rtlich!<br>  Es werden immer nur Neigungen und Aspekte aufgezeigt.

Aber die Charaktere alle aufzuschreiben br?uchte man bestimmt noch 10 Seiten.<br>  Aber wenn′s dich interessiert:<br>  <br>  24 AUGUST - 22 SEPTEMBER<br>      <br>  Sternzeichen  Beweglich<br>  TAG DER WOCHE  Mittwoch<br>  GLüCKSSTEIN  Saphir<br>  Smaragd<br>  Topas<br>  FARBEN  <br>  <br>  Wei?<br>  Gelb<br>  Grün<br>  Olivgrün<br>  BLUMEN  Eisenkraut<br>  Hyazinthe<br>  Metalle  Quecksilber<br>  DUFTESSENZ  <br>  <br>  Lavendel<br>  Tabak<br>  Tiere  <br>  <br>  Hund<br>  Schwalbe<br>  <br>  ALLGEMEINE EIGENSCHAFTEN:<br>  Zeichen der Erde, beherrscht von Merkur. Die Jungfraugeborenen sind pr?zise, kleinlich, leistungsf?hig, ernst und vernünftig. Im Allgemeinen legen sie viel Wert auf Geld, und obwohl sie es vorziehen ohne Einschr?nkungen zu leben, haben sie etwas gegen verschwenderisches Verhalten. Sie lieben ihr Zuhause, legen sehr viel Wert auf Einrichtung, und ihr Ordnungsfimmel grenzt manchmal schon an der Manie. Jungfrauen brauchen viel Lob, weil sie in ihrem Inneren sehr unsicher sind. In ihrem Arbeitsumfeld werden sie für ihre überragende Intelligenz oft sehr gesch?tzt. Die Berufe, die sich am besten für die Jungfrau eignen sind: Technischer Zeichner, Lehrer, Redakteur, Chemiker, Analytiker. Die Jungfraugeborenen haben ein gro?es Liebesbedürfnis und glauben an die Freundschaft, auch wenn es ihnen, aufgrund ihres introvertierten und zurückhaltenden Charakters manchmal schwer f?llt sich auf l?ngere Beziehungen einzulassen.<br>  <br>  WIE MAN DEN JUNGFRAU-MANN VERFüHRT: Der Jungfrau-Mann ist ernsthaft und streng. Er bevorzugt ruhige, stille, einfache und intelligente Partnerinnen. Er wird mit Sanftmut, Witz und Geduld erobert. Geben Sie ihm zu verstehen dass sie ihn brauchen. Tipp: Er hat eine Schw?che für elegante Kleidung und bevorzugt diskrete Farben.<br>  <br>  WIE MAN DIE JUNGFRAU-FRAU VERFüHRT: Die Jungfrau ist elegant, sch?n, vernünftig und ernst. Um sie zu erobern bedarf es Zeit und Best?ndigkeit, aber es lohnt sich auf jeden Fall!! Sie liebt intelligente Gespr?che und ernsthafte, aufrichtige Liebesbeziehungen. Tipp: Laden Sie, sie am ersten Abend zu einem klassischen Konzert ein.

7pJ8S0Liaa	Honey, you are going to find so many different answers with this question.  It really depends on what you really believe to be true. I am going to tell you something. I hope you will understand why I told my children this.<br>  <br>  I was told I had 1 year to live.  That was in 2006.  I told my kids everyday that I loved them so much. That they were going to lose me to death of cancer but I would never leave them completely. I told them that I would visit them in their dream. That I would come every night to them to tell them how much I missed them and how proud I was of them. I would let them know that I would be watching over them thru the day and if they are doing wrong I would let them know after they fall into a deep sleep.  I told them that they didn't have to be sad that I was leaving because of death. I told them that I would never be compleely gone as long as they kept me in their heart. As long as I am there I will come to them in their dreams.  My chidlren to this very day believe this. They where able to except my death. Not that they wanted me to die, but except that it would happen. Now that my cancer is gone, they still know that I wont live forever. Everyone has to die sooner or later. I had my baby which is 11 years old tell me one day. Mommy I know your not going to die now at least not yet, but if you ever do die, I promise I wont be sad because as soon as I fall asleep I know you will be there to hold me and tell me you love me. That you wish you was here with me when I am awake, but you promised you will be here when I sleep.  It brought so many tears to my eyes because I know if something ever does happen to me I know my baby will be okay with it and he won't morn too bad. I wouldn't want that for him. <br>  <br>  Honey all my children beleive this. I would do nothing to change that.

Kann der mensch fassen was grenzenlos ist ? Nein.<br>  <br>  Wer sagt jesus ist Gott unterstellt Gott ein K?rper. Wer sagt Jesus ist Gott der begrenzt Gott in gr?sse.

Gerade deshalb sind sie ja auch so unterschiedlich.|`|S51x5vK3aa	Ich sehe darin nicht etwa diesen biblischen Gott, der mit Menschen kommuniziert, ihne Plagen schickt, Befehle erteilt usw. Das geh?rt mehr zu den Typen die gerne Halluzinogene konsumieren.<br>  <br>  Weil ich mich lange Zeit mit Pantheismus, germanischer Mythologie, asiatischer Philosophie abseits des Mainstreams und Natur im Allgemeinen besch?ftigt habe, bin ich zur Erkenntnis gelangt, Gott ist weder eine Person, noch eine Personifikation usw. Es sind die Kr?fte und physikalischen Gesetzm??igkeiten, die die Natur und den Kosmos beherrschen. Dies entspricht ungef?hr der Vorstellung des Taoismus. Natürlich ist das kein Gott im eigentlichen Sinne, sondern mehr eine Macht, ein Absolutum. Da hilft auch beten nix, denn der Winter kommt bestimmt, ob ich nun dafür oder dagegen bete.<br>  <br>  Wie ich dazu gekommen bin? Das ich mich viel mit der Natur und den Naturkr?ften auseinandersetze liegt wahrscheinlich daran, dass ich in einem sehr naturnahen Land aufgewachsen bin, worin viele Menschen noch traditionell, abseits von St?dten leben und den Launen der Natur unterworfen sind. Auch mein Interesse für japanische Lyrik/Philosophie hat mir die Augen für die Sch?nheit der Naturerscheinungen ge?ffnet; ich sehe das G?ttliche in allem was w?chst, im Gesang des Vogels, im Regen usw.

Schuller (RHS) mit Bronwen Healy (BH):<br>  RHS: Heute ist es mir ein Vergnügen, Bronwen Healy vorzustellen. Sie kommt<br>  aus Brisbane in Australien. Bronwen wuchs in einem Vorort von Melbourne auf.<br>  Sie besuchte eine Schule, eine der besten. Sie hat den Ruf einer Eliteschule.<br>  Nach dem Schulabschlu? entschied sie sich für ein Universit?tsstudium. Nach<br>  anderthalb Studienjahren traf sie einige falsche Entscheidungen. Das führte sie<br>  in ein Leben mit Drogen. Sie wurde schwer drogenabh?ngig. Schlie?lich endete<br>  sie in Armut.<br>  Sie hatte nichts mehr zu verkaufen. Sie besa? nichts mehr, das sie h?tte<br>  verkaufen k?nnen. Sie konnte nur noch ihren K?rper für Geld verkaufen. Sechs<br>  Jahre lang war sie drogenabh?ngig. Ein Jahr lang verkaufte sie ihren K?rper.<br>  Dann geschah etwas. Sie traf Jesus Christus. Sollte jemand hier sein, der das<br>  nicht recht glaubt – h?ren sie ihr zu. Sie erz?hlt die Geschichte. Willkommen aus<br>  Australien, Bronwen Healy. Bronwen. Wow! Hoffentlich bekommen wir eine<br>  Gro?aufnahme von Ihnen – mit dieser Kamera. Dann kann man sehen, da? Sie<br>  Tr?nen in den Augen haben. Es pa?t wirklich alles. Sie sehen wundersch?n aus.<br>  BH: Danke.<br>  RHS: Sie sind mit einem gro?artigen christlichen Mann verheiratet.<br>  BH: Auf jeden Fall.<br>  RHS: Kinder?<br>  BH: Drei T?chter.<br>  RHS: Vier Jahre?<br>  BH: Vier Jahre, drei Jahre und ein Jahr alt.<br>  RHS: Wow! Wer pa?t auf sie auf?<br>  BH: Meine gro?artigen Eltern.<br>  RHS: Wow! Man kann ohne viel Mühe Jesus Christus in Ihnen erkennen. Es<br>  kommt mir fast vor, wenn ich Sie berühre, berühre ich den Geist Jesu. Er<br>  leuchtet aus Ihnen.<br>  BH: Danke.<br>  RHS: Erz?hlen Sie mir doch, wie alles anfing. Sie haben ein wunderbares Buch<br>  geschrieben. Es ist bei uns im Buchgesch?ft erh?ltlich. Man kann es auch bei<br>  hourofpower.org bestellen. Vermutlich bekommt man es auch in anderen<br>  Buchgesch?ften. Ich wünschte, alle k?nnten es lesen. Es ist eine ungemein<br>  packende Geschichte. Es gibt Millionen von Menschen, die drogenabh?ngig<br>  sind, so wie Sie es waren.<br>  BH: Ja.<br>  RHS: Wieviele würden angeregt werden, davon loszukommen, wenn sie die<br>  Liebe in Ihren Augen sehen würden; Ihre gl?nzenden Augen und Ihre<br>  Pers?nlichkeit. Jesus ver?ndert Menschen. Darüber predige ich.<br>  BH: Nein.<br>  RHS: Tu ich das etwa nicht? Nein? Nein. Unser Programm l?uft am l?ngsten in<br>  Australien. Wissen Sie das?<br>  BH: Ich habe es gerade erst erfahren.<br>  RHS: Ja. Seit über 26 oder 27 Jahren. Erz?hlen Sie uns Ihre Geschichte.<br>  BH: Eigentlich wuchs ich als braves Kind auf. Ich hatte gro?artige Eltern. Sie<br>  liebten mich. Mein Leben war angenehm. Ich absolvierte gerade mein letztes<br>  Schuljahr. Da dachte ich mir, ich h?tte mein Leben lang schwer gearbeitet. Jetzt<br>  h?tte ich etwas Gutes verdient. Jemand bot mir Haschisch an. Ich hatte das<br>  immer abgelehnt. Aber an diesem Tag sagte ich ja. Ich hatte nicht geahnt, da?<br>  es mir gefallen würde. Mir war nicht klar, da? ich nach dem Versuch mit<br>  Marihuana als Heroinsüchtige enden würde. Ich h?tte nie gedacht, da? ich, als<br>  ich mit 16 den ersten Joint rauchte, im Alter von 21 eine drogensüchtige<br>  Prostituierte sein würde.<br>  RHS: Wow! Wie kamen Sie denn so weit, Ihren K?rper zu verkaufen? Die Sucht<br>  war st?rker als Ihr menschlicher Stolz.<br>  BH: Ich geh?rte immer zu denen, die 110 Prozent geben. Wenn ich also<br>  anst?ndig lebe und ein braves M?dchen bin – Sie kennen ja die alte Geschichte.<br>  Wenn sie brav ist, dann ist sie wirklich ganz brav.<br>  Wenn sie b?se ist, dann ist sie abscheulich. Mir war nicht klar, wie sehr Drogen<br>  Macht über einen bekommen k?nnen. Ich konnte mir nicht vorstellen, da? mir<br>  Marihuana nicht mehr reichen und ich zu anderen Drogen übergehen würde.<br>  Amphetamine, Speed, Ekstasy. Bald hatte ich auch davon genug. Ich war an<br>  einem Punkt angelangt, wo ich so lebte, wie es mir pa?te. Wenn mir etwas<br>  zusagte, tat ich es. Jetzt verkünde ich etwas anderes. Das hei?t: Ich lebe nach<br>  meinem Glauben, nicht nach meinem Gefühl.<br>  RHS: Wow!<br>  BH: Wenn ich das mit 15 geh?rt h?tte, w?re mein Leben wohl anders verlaufen.<br>  Aber damals lebte ich so, wie es mir pa?te. Wenn mir etwas gefiel, tat ich es. Es<br>  gab Sex, Drogen, Partys. Um mich herum war immer viel los. Dann wurde ich<br>  schwanger. Mein Arzt gab mir folgenden Rat: Ich würde ja t?glich Drogen<br>  nehmen. Der Vater des Kindes ist heroinsüchtig. Daher sollte ich abtreiben<br>  lassen. Ich h?tte mir nie die Depressionen, die Düsternis, die Angst und die<br>  Traurigkeit vorstellen k?nnen, die das ausl?sen würde.<br>  RHS: Sie lie?en also abtreiben.<br>  BH: Ja.<br>  RHS: Wenn Sie das nochmal machen mü?ten?<br>  BH: Danach werde ich st?ndig gefragt. Ich sage dann, zu dieser Zeit h?tte ich<br>  von Jesus nichts gewu?t. Mir war folgendes nicht klar: Noch ehe das Kind in mir<br>  entstand, hatte Gott einen Plan und eine Bestimmung für dieses Kind. Das wu?te<br>  ich nicht. Jetzt wei? ich es. Ich wu?te nicht, da? ich neu anfangen und mich<br>  ?ndern k?nnte. Ich kann nur beten. Ich glaube, durch die Botschaft dieser<br>  Gemeinde werden viele ihre Meinung ?ndern.<br>  RHS: Ja.<br>  HB: Ja, so ist es.<br>  RHS: Sie und ein Freund – wohl Ihr Freund – nahmen zusammen Rauschgift.<br>  Haben Sie nicht Selbstmord ernsthaft in Erw?gung gezogen; Sie beide?<br>  BH: Wir haben tats?chlich versucht, Selbstmord zu begehen. Wir injizierten uns<br>  Heroin im Wert von 800 Dollar. Mein Arzt sagte mir, das h?tte gereicht, um zwei<br>  Pferde umzubringen. Da? ich überlebte, konnte nur ein Wunder und die Hand<br>  Gottes sein. Zwei Stunden nach der Heroininjektion wachte ich auf. Ich war noch<br>  am Leben und fühlte mich entsetzlich elend. Ich dachte, was für eine Versagerin<br>  ich doch w?re. Nicht einmal richtig umbringen k?nnte ich mich.<br>  RHS: Ja, das sagen sich die Leute, wenn der Selbstmord nicht klappt. Wie sind<br>  Sie von dieser entsetzlichen Sucht losgekommen? Was war der erste Schritt?<br>  BH: Ich hatte alles verkauft und mein ganzes Geld ausgegeben. Ich hatte als<br>  Prostituierte angefangen. Die Prostitution war die dunkelste, die einsamste und<br>  zerst?rerischste Phase meines Lebens. Ich habe es 12 Monate lang getan. Ich<br>  kenne viele, die zu mir sagen, 12 Monate w?ren nicht sehr lange. Aber ich sage,<br>  12 Sekunden sind zu viel. Man verkauft den eigenen K?rper und die eigene<br>  Seele an fremde M?nner. Sie bezahlen Geld, um Sex mit einem zu haben. Es ist<br>  entwürdigend und zermürbend und scheu?lich. Ich h?tte nie gedacht, da? das<br>  brave M?dchen, das ich war, so enden würde. Eines Abends machte ich mich für<br>  die Arbeit fertig. Ich war wie eine Prostituierte herausstaffiert. Da klopfte jemand<br>  an die Tür. Es war meine Mutter. Sie hatte mich über ein Jahr lang nicht gesehen<br>  und nichts von mir geh?rt. Sie kam herein und musterte mich. Dann sagte sie:<br>  ?Du bist nicht das M?dchen, zu dem wir dich erzogen haben. Ich habe in den<br>  Todesanzeigen nach deinem Namen gesucht.“ Ich dachte mir st?ndig, ich sei die<br>  verlorene Tochter. Vielleicht sollte ich nach Hause gehen. Ich machte mir<br>  verst?rkt Gedanken über Drogen. Da begriff ich, da? ich in Schwierigkeiten<br>  steckte. Denn diese Mutter, die mich mein ganzes Leben lang geliebt hat, war<br>  mir unwichtig. Bald darauf stieg ich aus. Ich nahm keine Drogen mehr. Aber<br>  innerlich war ich nicht frei. Ich erkannte, da? ich diese Leere mit Sex, Drogen, mit<br>  Schlimmem und Finsternis auszufüllen versuchte. Eines Tages traf ich einen<br>  Arzt. So nebenbei erw?hnte er, er sei Christ. Er sagte mir, ich br?uchte eine<br>  Entziehungskur. Diese Reha-Klinik war zuf?llig eine christliche Anstalt. W?hrend<br>  dieser Entziehung war ich grob, aufs?ssig, widerlich.<br>  Ich sa? vor der Kirche und rauchte Zigaretten. An einem Sonntag regnete es in<br>  Str?men. Ich mu?te hineingehen. Dort drinnen traf ich an diesem Tag Jesus<br>  Christus. Ich begann Ihn zu lieben.<br>  BH: Ja.<br>  RHS: Was war der erste Kontakt mit der Bibel?<br>  BH: Mir ist gerade klar geworden, weshalb Gott mich gerade heute, an diesem<br>  Sonntag, hierhergeführt hat. Eine der ersten Schriftstellen, von der ich je h?rte,<br>  war Psalm 23. Ich mu?te einsehen, da? ich nicht Herr und Gott meines eigenen<br>  Lebens sei. Ich mu?te die Herrschaft Jesus übergeben. Dann würde Er mich<br>  beschützen. Er würde sich meiner annehmen im Tal des Todesschattens. Er<br>  konnte mich aus diesem Sumpf herausholen. Er konnte mein Leben verwandeln.<br>  Er konnte mich zu dem Menschen werden lassen, der ich heute bin. Ich mu?te<br>  es Ihm nur gestatten.<br>  RHS: Das haben Sie tats?chlich getan?<br>  BH: Vollkommen.<br>  RHS: Wie fanden Sie Ihren christlichen Ehemann? War es Glück oder ein<br>  Segen?<br>  BH: Ich lernte ihn der Reha-Klinik kennen. Ja, das ist interessant. Um ehrlich zu<br>  sein, zuerst kamen wir nicht gut miteinander aus. Aber der Plan Gottes war viel<br>  gr??er als meiner. Schlie?lich wurde es uns klar, da? wir uns liebten. Wir<br>  heirateten. Jetzt haben wir drei – wie ich sagen m?chte –, es sind die<br>  gro?artigsten T?chter der Welt, die man sich vorstellen k?nnte. Ich bin vielleicht<br>  ein wenig voreingenommen ... Aber ich glaube, das ist wahr.<br>  RHS: Ihr Mann – ist er hier?<br>  BH: Er ist hier, ja.<br>  RHS: Ist er mit Ihnen hergereist?<br>  BH: Aber natürlich.<br>  RHS: Ist er heute morgen in der Kirche?<br>  BH: Er ist heute morgen in der Kirche.<br>  RHS: Wo ist er?<br>  BH: Jason?<br>  RHS: Wow! Jetzt haben Sie eine Kirchengemeinde. Sie haben dies zu Ihrer<br>  Kirche gemacht, nicht wahr?<br>  BH: Ganz gewi?. Viele Menschen auf der Welt sollen erfahren, da? Gott am<br>  Werk ist. Er bewirkt einen inneren Wandel.<br>  RHS: Das bewegt einen zutiefst. Ich habe mich nie mit jemandem unterhalten,<br>  der eine solche Geschichte zu erz?hlen hatte.

AA10945101	I think you hit the nail on the head in your last sentence...it just proves that you too believe in the superiority of your own beliefs!  <br>  <br>  I think that's basic human nature...think about it a minute...would your beliefs be your beliefs if you didn't think they were true?  Would you choose to believe something that you know is false (not talking about pretending to believe something you know is false because of perceived rewards...though many people do that too)?<br>  <br>  Not all Christians would say you are going to hell...and not all atheists would say you're a fool.  My hypothesis is that the extremes (the Christians and atheists that would reach those extreme conclusions) are largely a result of a lack of certainty in their own beliefs.  A person that is secure in his or her beliefs doesn't have a rational reason for telling another person that he or she is going to burn in hell OR calling him or her a fool.  Those that do might claim that they are trying to "save" the other person (from hell or from ignorance/delusion/whatever) but if that's their true motivation, they are condemning themselves with their words...the Christian is condemning him or herself to judgment for their own sins and the atheist is proving him or herself a fool because he or she seems to think people respond positively to threats/insults!   <br>  <br>  Sounds like your claim not to lie to yourself may be a tad more substantial than most because at least you recognized that you may be doing the same thing you deplore in others...should help you avoid some of those largely unproductive extreme beliefs and associated behaviors!  <br>  <br>  ...and it might make it a little easier to put yourself in the shoes of those that do fall victim to the extremes...it is easy to say that you believe something and it is also easy to lie to yourself (or accept the lies of others we find credible) about what you really believe. When it comes to beliefs, what is really more important...living your life according to those beliefs or professing your beliefs to others.  Personally, I believe the message is far more effective when you live it and my beliefs tell me that I should love people that make themselves my enemy by attacking my beliefs.  That I should look beneath the hateful behavior of people that take extreme positions and see the fear and pain that motivates their behavior.  When you focus on the negative behavior, you just make the problem worse...only when you focus on their pain do you have any chance of helping them!|`|AA12383652	It is not necessarily arrogance to decide what is true and stick to that conviction.  <br>  <br>  We should allow people, however, to believe what they want to believe.  <br>  <br>  There will be a crossover in terms of beliefs and morality and laws, however, in any kind of democratic society where we vote on issues and laws according to our morality and value system.<br>  <br>  Sometimes people claim arrogance for conviction.  I am not arrogant because I already searched for what is true and refused to change my views because someone else tells me I should.  I am arrogant, however, if I feel I am better than someone else because of what I believe.<br>  <br>  That kind of arrogance is found in all walks of life, belief systems and lack of beliefs.|`|q57P8uJbaa	Perhaps it's one thing to read about a person (God) in a book and another to really know him.  How could I be hardcore and not know God personally?  Above all things, I know that God is love, and that God is good.  Many have wondered how God can send someone to hell and still be loving, but to those individuals I say remember also that God is righteous.  I say to everyone, it's not that God is unloving, it is we who are in error and do not understand his ways.  It is not just through my reason, or pride that I say there is no one more wonderful than God.  It is through the experience of my life, and I am sure there are millions of others who KNOW him, and KNOW what I am talking about.|`|AA10674998	Lift Up Your Hands to Heaven, For Behold, Your Redeemer Lives<br>  From Letters From God and His Christ<br>  Jump to: navigation, search<br>  <br>  6/22/05 - From Our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ - A Letter Given to Timothy, For All Those Who Have Ears to Hear<br>  <br>  Behold the Lamb who takes away the sins of the world...He is the Lion. And His countenance is as lightning, and His footsteps quake upon the earth. He is coming upon the clouds in great glory, and every eye shall see Him and weep. He has taken away the sins of those who love Him...they shall be gathered up. Those, who refuse the Gift, shall be judged for all they have done. Woe to those who rebel and shake their fist against He who had made them and offered them love and salvation, for the Father's anger is kindled and shall be poured out...His punishments for the wicked, swift. Even so, every soul who humbles himself and calls on His name, the only name given under Heaven by which you must be saved, shall be saved. Their salvation is assured, but their plight is not yet finished, for long did they deny the Lord God and His Only Begotten, so they shall tarry upon the earth until the works, the mighty works of the Lord, are concluded. Do not mourn...the Helper will be with them.<br>  <br>  Now come and see, and listen and have understanding, oh men and women of intellect and worldly learning. Your knowledge has made you the fool...you have become the lowliest and most wretched souls in all the King's court. You are poor, blind, deaf and naked. Your pride has made you a king and lord unto yourself. Let go of your pride and be like the beggar. For out of his desperate need, he does call for help, and asks all who pass him by for food and money, so he might live just one more day. So I ask you, prideful generation, why does the heathen rage and shake his fist at Heaven?<br>  <br>  Oh beloved, my lost and sick, you need not beg, but only become like the beggar. Cast off all that binds you to this world and ask for help, and the Helper shall come. With Him does He bring manna from Heaven for your nourishment, and new robes that are white to clothe you and protect you from the storm. What I bring is not just to sustain you for just one more day, but a day that never ends. For the beggar is desperate, for he knows he is in grave need and understands not that he shall be given My kingdom. You say you have no need of anything. I say to you in a loud voice, WOE! You are in desperate need. You stand with both of your feet already in the grave, blinded by pride. Reach out with your hands, and feel the headstone whereon is written your name and all your works against God. Now look inside...Is not your heart fashioned after this very same headstone? I gave you a heart like Mine. You have refashioned it in the image of the world and the evil one. From this place inside you, do you conceive and spew all things corrupt from your mouth which defile you continually.<br>  <br>  Now turn to Me...you are not forsaken. Your Redeemer lives! Turn your cheek from this world and behold My glory, for in My left hand, I hold an iron scepter to break that stone placed at your head. Indeed, I shall break it and grind it to dust beneath My feet. With My right hand shall I help you out of your grave and place your feet upon the good ground. Here, My child...take this cup from Me and drink deeply, and be healed.<br>  <br>  Behold the wicked, they shall be refashioned and called the redeemed...<br>       from all stony places shall come rivers of living water.<br>  The grave shall be swallowed up, all headstones shattered, for the Word of God has come...<br>       and His Word, only, shall be written and spoken henceforth and forever. Amen.|`|LM4Qjl5Jaa	There is no grey area with God, however there is compassion towards those who know not the truth and so we try to follow his example by first giving the milk then the meat of the word in such a way that they are wooed to it rather than shove it down their throats. That leaves them room to think about things and make intelligent choices. And as Christians, we shouldn't argue; we should leave God some room to work with that person where we might fail. That's where prayer comes in.|`|wZSwrsuWaa	i agree. Spiritually speaking, life is not a "yes or no" proposition.

5E3WYdNtaa	You may want to have a serious discussion with your husband and decide what is best for your child.|`|oHrqbdydaa	I think it best not to teach her any religion until she is old enough to form her own opinions and beliefs. She can be taught moral behavior without religion.<br>  <br>  Certainly don't fill her mind up with thoughts of Hell and Sin. That would be awful.<br>  |`|c23478f3a6f6ccbb83145c92645bca1aaa	forgive me but this is something that should have been discussed prior to marriage and children.|`|lpgdP3Gdaa	By tradition usually, the child takes the Mothers religion. In this case, Christian! You can raise your child to know both religions theirs nothing wrong with that. Or observe both of the religious holidays, I have a friend who is Jewish and Catholic and observes Both Hannukah & Christmas, but she is much more religious with Christianity. It really doesn't matter which religion you choose, just pick the Religion you can both agree on to raise your child! Good Luck!|`|bxd6hJoQaa	id talk to your husband about the issue since thats where your problems are going to arise. If it was my child i'd let the child know both of your beliefs and let the child decide what he believes for himself. I think it is a terrible thing to do to a child to influence what they should believe.|`|IZWfhF5Saa	Just be fair, give her a good understanding of all major religions and let her decide.|`|q5lreoiWaa	I do agree with tails, by tradition children are their mother's religion.  In your case, though, sadly neither parent is committed to their beliefs.  Children learn by example, and it sounds as if both of your examples are kind of wishywashy.  This is where the rubber hits the road - if you want your daughter to know your beliefs, the very best way is to show her. By the way, respecting other's beliefs  would include respecting her father's beliefs as well. Is it not a little late to consider this ?your child is one.|`|RyEgxODgaa	Actually- from what you have just said- your beliefs are not much different from your husbands. You both will wind up in the same place-if there is no change. The longer you wait to right this fiasco- the more difficult it will be.

1Vih78dZaa	My honest opinion is that what's been going on between you and your pastor sounds like the sort of stuff that goes on between a couple of emotionally immature teens who think they love each other, but are really just trying to sort out how they're supposed to deal with relationships.<br>  <br>  Why don't you say what this "huge fight" was about? That wording alone suggests that neither you nor he are the most emotionally stable of people. Was the fight about something personal? If so, then you're way too close to someone who's supposed to be a spiritual mentor and counsellor. If the "fight" was about some point of religious doctrine, then it appears your pastor is lacking the spiritual and mental poise that someone with a direct line to God should have.<br>  <br>  You seem to be saying that it was only after three apologies and you grovelling and calling him a "great person" that your spiritual leader was willing to talk to you again. This is incredibly emotionally manipulative and not the sort of behaviour one has the right to expect from someone who claims to follow the teachings of a guy who said we should turn the other cheek when insulted.<br>  <br>  As for him lecturing you about how you need to do your best to comply with what JC asks of you, is it possible that your pastor is confusing what he wants you to do with what Jesus wants you to do? Any minister who tells you that he knows what Jesus wants you to do with your life is someone who should be avoided. If you believe in Jesus, only you will be able to understand what it is he wants you to do with your life. A pastor or priest may be able to offer you guidance and help you think through what you need to do, but accepting what they say as the Word Of God is very dangerous.<br>  <br>  Finally, I think you need to consider why you need a father figure. If you're still a teen, then that's a little immature but just about okay. If you're any older than that, then it's pathological and you need to start thinking about making your own decisions without daddy telling you what you should do.|`|Xcri5qeTaa	The argument may have challenged his beliefs and ability to support his own argument. The silent treatment is usually an emotionally manipulative way attempt to control (win) by indirectly threatening to abandon. However, people (men more often than women) will sometimes clam up and crawl into a cave when they're trying to work out something difficult.<br>  <br>  It sounds like you put some challenge up about Jesus or Christianity, and something you said must have hit him pretty hard. But it may have been more that you are a daughter figure, and he had this idea that you would always fill this ideal image in his mind. Which you can't, of course, that's wholly unrealistic as no one person can entirely know another. So, his idea of you may have been shattered.<br>  <br>  Don't be so concerned about his feelings being hurt that you just go along with what you think he wants to hear and see. It is infinitely better to know and be yourself, than to live a lie. Wouldn't be like you'd be fooling him or you, anyway, so you just may as well be honest with your thoughts an feelings.<br>  <br>  Now, as human relationships go, trust is the most important thing. You may feel like you have someone broken trust, but not know exactly how. If  that's the case, then I'll point you back to what I said about him having some unrealistic, idealistic image centered on you. We change, ideals don't.<br>  <br>  EDIT: I have to add that I think this relationship is waaaay too emotionally involved.|`|lJvncha1aa	I think that a pastor who gives you the "silent treatment" is far to immature to be a pastor.  And I think you might be wise to look for a better one, either by changing churches, or by urging yours to not renew his contract, or terminate it, or whatever your church does.  <br>  <br>  I think a pastor should refrain from using such childish tactics to get you to come around to his point of view.  That is NOT what religion is for...it is for finding your own path, and learning to grow.  Pastors should be about helping you get there...not through coercion, but through teaching you. |`|8Pro95Izaa	It means that your pastor needs a lesson in forgiveness. Either that or he is a Scorpio or Picese lol. <br>  <br>  I do not know what you want us to tell you? It sounds to me like you were fighting about soemthing you didnt like, something having to do with the faith and christ. My guess is that you do not want to be another robot. <br>  <br>  He gave you the silent treatment because either you annoyed him, he needed time to think OR he is just childish. I gave them to you in the order that I feel are right. lol <br>  <br>  Blessings and You did well in apologizing. <br>  Shadow|`|AA10233868	well your pastore is learningbut its best to pray. you should let anyone let you down. if theyre being childish let them be and dont bother them. but do congrigate with them and try to keep in touch with them. im a pisces i go threw with this stuff. once someone puts the screws to me  it take a while for the woudns to heal.|`|8q52H8tPaa	Honey find yourself a new church. The role of a pastor is to forgive the sinner and help them not to sin again. By not accepting your apology he failed in his role as the leader of his flock. And his warmest regards is just a polite way of saying go away. |`|8cLR79mgaa	When you take on a position such as a Pastor you need to live up to that role. It was not very good judgement on his part to ignore you when you were truly trying to communicate.<br>  <br>  That being said eveyone is human and he may have needed some time to come to grips about whatever you "big" fight was about.<br>  <br>  At this point I think that you need to recocider this mans position in your life. It seems somewhat manipulative and not in your best intentins. Give it a rest. Try another church.|`|jBJ4fAKiaa	Sometimes silence just makes you listen to the words left unspoken.

I didn't get that memo for one... Bisexuality still existed last time I checked in. To me your question is very much like if someone had asked me if women can love women. Or men can love men. Or men and women can love each other. "Gay" and "lesbian" (well, even "straight", but don't tell them, 'cause it'll freak them out - oh, too late, you're it...) is  nothing but labels we give ourselves and we have to bear in mind that they don't determine our behavior. And love has always been the one sentiment that fools us and plays us and surprises us. Fact is that we just don't decide who we fall in love with. |`|vWn2qG8haa	It's possible for a lesbian to fall in love with a real man.<br>  But it's not possible for a real lesbian to fall in love with a man.|`|2oO6lNSsaa	one question...Wat do u mean by "Real Man", I didn't know there were Imaginary man...lol<br>  <br>  yeah its possible 4 a lesbian 2 fall 4 a MAN...but she wouldn't be a lesbian she would be BI|`|f8hS7V9eaa	anything is possiblllllllllle!|`|UYJgIfLZaa	maybe she's not a real lesbian|`|rI6xYwhcaa	a real man?<br>  you mean, they were falling for<br>  fake ones!?|`|b931753da53fa7c2b1a6ae8598d475b8aa	My father always told me he was a lesbian! ...Hey, you are probably such a sweet guy, that you gave her a new outlook on men...good job, and just go with it...anyone can change x|`|og9XQSLgaa	And this is when labels don't work very well =P<br>  <br>  If someone is 100% sure they are a lesbian but all of a sudden fall in love with a man, they are bisexual.|`|DkNs0QWkaa	yes<br>  |`|3oYtSlnjaa	yeah one day she'll want the co-ck<br>  gowan give me the thumbs down i don't give a toss lol|`|Azdg9KKwaa	Many marriages have failed because either the husband or wife found a lover of the same sex.  When you love someone, you have to accept them exactly as they are.  Could you really remain in a relationship while knowing that your friend or spouse will always desire to be with another woman?  It's not a healthy situation and will lead to jealousy and disappointments in the future.<br>  <br>  A lesbian doesn't look at men and women the way a straight woman does. They may find both you and a woman attractive sexually, but the woman will likely be her lover while you become the accepted person to do "couple" things with outside of the bedroom. Her lady friend will be her lover and you will be her buddy.  It's not that she couldn't have a sexual relationship with you, but that she will eventually feel like she is cheating on her female lover if she is sexual with you.<br>  <br>  I'm sorry.  The truth isn't fair where this issue is concerned.  The mind, hormones, experiences in life all play a part.  You need to accept her for exactly who she is.  This has absolutely nothing to do with what a great lover you are or how very handsome you are.  I hope you don't think less of yourself because of this relationship.  You can't change her mind by being someone else.  She's attracted to women - and you're not a woman. Can you live with being her occassional lover?|`|ebcfaff0504724aa2ad756522576c3b2aa	Are you the lesbian or are you the "real man" trying to win her over?<br>  If you are a straight man and pursuing a lesbian, well, we don't always know why we fall for the folks that we fall for, but could it be because she is unobtainable? Could it be because you don't feel like you're good enough to ask a girl out who actually goes for dudes? <br>  I won't say "it'll never happen" either, although the odds are quite against you. I will say that even if she did fall for you, she's gonna have a lot of baggage that might make the relationship pretty weird.<br>  However, I do know people who've experimented with their sexuality and who are now in stable marriages or relationships. Like I said, I'll never say never. |`|PvySidzHaa	umm idk but i think girls are sexy <br>  but have loved ( not in a romantic way ) a man<br>  <br>  he just had a lot of insight. had a big impact on me with saying little to nothing to me daily ;)|`|jkprjXMDaa	i dont see why not<br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20081006162251AA7YD9b">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a>|`|GUysHoJmaa	Is it possible for me to fall in love with a lesbian?|`|EVS5t31qaa	I think that would make them bisexual.|`|ZPkYSkNVaa	She's just a girl, go for it.|`|95d9fb9f67e7bf13ceaf588f2f98d5d8aa	yea but then it would prove she isnt a lesbian|`|166062537f8266290ed1b5cf931f96a1aa	yes.

fysSudOjaa	I see absolutely no reason why there shouldn't be a pledge(I'm assuming you mean the Pledge of Allegiance.  <br>  <br>  There are some religions who don't believe in saying any kind of oath or performing any type of group ritual to anything other than their God so therefore I don't have a  problem with them or anyone else who doesn't feel the need to recite the pledge because that's what our country is all about FREEDOM. Many people have fought and died for our right to say it and for those who choose not to say it so I don't see any reason that we shouldnt have it.|`|de947568c9e8173e12d8a9930bab48abaa	If you are trying to say Pledge of Allegiance then the answer is no I can't.

A good Amercian is proud to say it.  Our American culture came from those who died setting up our constitution and way of life.  The flag is our symbol of our freedoms.  To deny it is to deny our culture and those who fought for it and continue to do so.  If you don't wish to do so, there are many third world countries with no such freedoms that are open to you for citizenship.  |`|bq60jWEvaa	Alot of religions, it is not the pledge but the part where it says in god we trust.

I mean it teaches them to be kind to one another, to have patience, etc. and therefore people who follow these rules have better time with family, friends, coworkers, bosses, etc. Since most people think that God wrote the Bible then the people who followed the philosophies of the Bible will think that God saved them.

When you join a good Church you become part of the family of God.<br>  <br>  Also, reading scripture brings wisdom and so does good teaching and preaching. There is all kinds of emotional healing that just starts when you accept Jesus into your life, and once you become an integral part of the people of God there is much more emotional healing and health in relating to people in real and open ways. Allowing other Christians to be involved in your life can change you in so many ways, strengthen your abiltiy to commit yourself to others and give you good teaching for family life. <br>  <br>  As you gain confidence that you are a loved person you become a better employee and are more confident in job interviews. <br>  <br>  These are just a few of the things that i have experienced.|`|vAnZIGl6aa	If you wait for "God" to change your life, you will die waiting.

Guru Nanak's Robe (Jubba) is preserved along with a copy of Holy Book Quran.That is what is kept in a sacred Box which is not opened before public. <br>  <br>  Guru Granth Sahib is the Book of His poetry. I have read some of his teachings. He preached Pure Monotheism Oneness (tawheed) of God Almighty Allah.<br>  <br>  Both Muslim Sufis and Sikhs were his followers. It is said that he went to a river (i donot remember the name of it) and took a dip and never ccame back. His followers could only take his clothes as a memory of him from there.<br>  <br>  The Present Sikhism is established by the Gurus after him and their TheirTenth Guru,  GuruGobind Singh has gone to the extreme in enmity with the King Aurangzeb.|`|STGu7JAYaa	Mohammad a is right but Guru Nanak is not a muslim but he was treated as muslim saint and as well hindu saint

I came out to my mom would be the way to say it. And it's 'accept' btw. Okay, the english lesson is over now. Most parents will not be completely satisfied that their children are gay. There are exceptions, and the exceptions are becoming more and more common, but being gay is still GENERALLY a bad thing in parents' eyes. As far as what you can do about that? Nothing. There's nothing you should do differently, or extra. Just prove to them you're still their son, and that you haven't changed, just that you'd rather have a guy at your side. Time heals all. I thought I'd end up parent-less after i first came out. Im out on my own and my mom still calls me once every week or so to ask how i've been and they visit me at work here n there. So don't worry too much. It can seem tuff now, especially when you start having those 'talks' and conversations about life and how bad being gay is. Or at least, i got those.... lol ---good luck to ya, and remember, just be you, as long as you are true to yourself then nothing else should matter, its your life and you only live once|`|mmVvwcP7aa	you should continue to live the way you have. dont worry about what even your parents will say or think. you are your own person and if they dont accept that then thats too bad for them.|`|vo3NbXY6aa	It depends on your age.

NLbbsD8Caa	I feel that spirits can communicate in alot of ways...i believe it depends on how receptive and perceptive you are...for instance...when i was growing up...my great grandmother passed when i was 8 years old. she was 92. we were really close...and my mom has told me just how much she loved me and cared for me...my great grandma had this leather cross that she kept in her Bible and carried w/ her everywhere she went...went i was 22years old i was going through some really rough times...and along w/ Prayer, and my bible...i carried that cross w/ me everywhere i went...well after i gotten thru my ordeal i noticed i had misplaced the cross...i looked everywhere for it...i never found it. well about 9months lata...i was going thru another rough time...and i was distraught and about 2 drive 2 class for an exam...so i was in a rush as i was 15minutes late...b4 i left my house, i went 2 grab my wallet off a table...i had set it there less than 10minutes earlier...on top of my wallet...was the leather cross...i was shocked, awed, and just amazingly touched...as i was driving 2 class...less than 5blocks from my house there is an intersection...the light was green...i was about 2 drive through the intersection...but something told me to slow down...get in the left turning lane...and come 2 a complete stop...(on the green light). i remember thinkin...oookay. as i did this i looked in my rearview...and a car sped past me 2 go thru the same green light...the same intersection...it was struck in the side by a driver who ran the red light...i witnessed the 3 car rollover crash less than 20 feet from me...as sad as i was for those people...i quickly realized it couldve easily been me...and i dont wear my seatbelt often...some1 saved my life...and i believe my great grandma had something 2 do with it...I'm now thinkin if it were a coincidence that the leather cross lay on my drivers licensce...hmm...but yea...thats my communication story...it happened a week ago 2day.|`|CWGkfXzyaa	My brother Scott is a ghost, he killed himself.

When I woke up I was very depressed, suicidal. I decided to take a shower. I went into the bathroom and was drawing the water and saying out loud how I felt. I kept talking to Scott saying "Scott, I wish I was there with you so I don't have to feel this horrible pain" <br>  As soon as I finished this sentence, the phone rings. I'm thinking, great, one of my friends is calling and now I can cheer up a bit...I went to answer the phone and this lady on the other line says: "Is Scott there?"<br>  Holy sh** I got dressed and left the house! I did go to my friend's house and she consoled me.<br>  The very next day, I decided to call my sister and tell her what happened, but I couldn't find her. So I called Frances, Scott's mother (my siblings and I all have the same father but different mothers...another story..)<br>  So I call Frances to say hello and to look for my sister, Nancy.<br>  Frances says first thing "Are you calling me today because of what day it is?" she had just gotten back from church, so I thought she meant like Easter or something...it took me two weeks to realize that I called Scott's mother on April 1st.

Usually it is a small amount of energy, but sometimes alot more then expected energy gets released and it forms into a ghost of the deceased person.<br>  <br>  A ghost cannot physically throw something at you or touch you. Does it make sense that a ghost can walk through a wall one moment and then throw a coffee mug at you the next? It doesnt make sense because if its hand was solid enough to grasp the mug it would never go through a wall.<br>  <br>  As such, ghosts also cannot comminucate with the living either. Why is it possible for a ghost to moan to try to scare people away but cannot form any comprehendable language to be able to say "hello, Im so and so, Ive been dead for X amount of years. This is how I died. I dont know why Im here but here I am."<br>  <br>  Those reasons are why I dont believe in ghosts|`|0JB7VUp5aa	I am a ghost and this is how I communicate.|`|cnLGOAwsaa	I came up with this idea years ago but never saw it through. There are these scientist that find out how to make humans immortal. However, unbeknownst to them, there is an after life where if you were good you go to heaven, etc. Now no one will go because they all live forever. Any ghost running around cannot communicate to tell them. Earth becomes over crowded, then a hell. This happens after Heaven only received one hundred forty four thousand souls. <br>  I through that last part in just now.<br>  Just another note: Ghost do not exist.|`|eCcYzXq1aa	I lke Ghost hunting too.|`|flFmb252aa	They can communicate with sensitive people, but if they are desperate enough I believe the theory that they draw energy to manifest, so things like emf detectors can be useful and also try to get some evp's (Electronic voice Phenomenon).|`|3uCN5jB7aa	When ghosts find out they are dead, they say; "Man, this is boo-sh*t."|`|ccc8cccab563b947d551db91c906fce4aa	Try reading Christmas Carol by Charles Dickens.

09644ZZSaa	Hmm theres a lot that needs to be worked on. I had trouble understanding what you were trying to say in some spots but I'll do my best. The part where you say "Which main service you can get" is most effectively titled "Reasons to choose (company name)" because you then list a bunch of reasons why people should use your services. Replace (company name) with the name of your company. I'd also replace customer service attendants with something that better describes the job (I gather from your ad that your company does advertisement and web design) like advertisement specialists/experts because customer service workers usually only handle customer concerns and hardly ever work hands on in their companies. See below for what I think is the best way to emphasize customer service without trivializing the job.<br>  <br>  Also tell me more about what your company does, are you just an ad company or do you do web pages? The following assumes you are mainly an advertisement company:<br>  <br>  Reasons to choose (company name):<br>  ***Our full-time advertisement experts specialize in customer service. <br>  ***Our advertisement experts will explore the unique selling points of your company together with you.<br>  ***We help you bring traffic to your website with high quality advertisement.<br>  ***We regularly track customer service.<br>  <br>  Advertisement designed around your unique selling point<br>  ***We put strong emphasis on the relevance of the advertisment to your company. We display the unique selling point of your company in its proper form.<br>  <br>  Hopefully this helps. If I misunderstood what the company does and you need me to change something IM me on Yahoo instant messenger: papageno19.|`|MUX6EU2Maa	The following are the main services we offer<br>  ***Full-time customer service attendants - with whom you will explore unique selling points<br>  *Making high quality popular webpages<br>  (Customer Service is tracked regularly)
QlMubgPcaa	Hi MTR. I came out 2 years ago to my very Religious Mother. Actually I was outed and she confronted me. I have come out different ways to different people depending on the relationship with each. You know your Mom where we don't but it sounds like she is at least open to the idea.  Coming out is very personal to each of us. To my siblings it wasn't practical to visit each one in person as were spread out over 1500 miles. With each of them I called all on the same weekend. Starting with who I thought would be the most supportive. I had prepared myself to be completely rejected. Fortunately 3 out of the 5 gave instant support and 1 other has sense accepted it. I am dead to the other. To close Friends, I wrote a letter explaining everything I was going threw and how it affected my life and my relationship with them. When it was possible I hand delivered it. I asked them to read it and I would answer any questions I was able to. To my son 15 at the time I told him I had something very important to talk to him about when he wasn't busy. I didn't push it until he was ready. He still chooses to live with me full time so it went well obviously. It sounds like your Daughter is very young yet and this wont be a issue with her. My Mother and one Sister did use the "think of your son" approach. Wait till he is out of school etc etc. I had come out to my G/F 3 years earlier, we were planing to get married and I felt I owed her the truth about my Gender issues. I was still at the point I thought I could control them. Looking back that is when I really started to transition.  My ex wife, who I had very little contact with in the past had heard rumors and called me thinking it was a joke. I told her it wasn't and that I was indeed in transition. She was a instant supporter as she said it cleared up so many questions about our marrage. Maybe as your Mom has asked you in the past if you wanted to be treated as a Man perhaps the approach  of "remember when you asked me......."  would work. Explain that you were not ready at that time to deal with it but you are now. She may really surprise you and give you the support you want, the acceptence we all need. I was so sure my Mother would damn me to hell but I found just the oppisete. Your idea of a letter may be the best followed by a call and visit. However you decide I wish you the best of luck with this. Its never easy.|`|669150c23f08dc597604048cf4490ee0aa	I'm sorry I can't truely help you out on this, as every family and every situation is differnt. Simply state, that yes, you would like to be treated as a man, called syr, hy, and hys, pick the male form of your name and start going with it.<br>  <br>  I'm not sure where you are, but it might be possible after T and top surgery to have your liscense and birth certificate changed to state male (as well as your name changed).<br>  Goodluck with all that.<br>  <br>  A great website to go to is www.butch-femme.com. It  is full of all kinds of butchs from ftm's to "plain ol' butch dyke".<br>  <br>  Goodluck, and please remember, if you are with someone (and it's a woman) it's not just you that is "coming out" but if you live your life as a man she will essentially be "put back into the closet"  as a queer woman, as you will essentially look like a heterosexual couple. While it is all about you right now, she may have her own issues.<br>  <br>  <br>  been with a FTM for over a year and a half now. if you'd like to chat about what it's like for the other half, let me know, I'd be glad to talk to you.|`|27f4e48f0d0238df982b0a36eb42a9c2aa	For Marhamah: FTM means female-to-male, silly.<br>  <br>  Write her a long, detailed letter explaining why you think you might be happier as a man, and why you weren't able to tell her before.  Wait till the weekend, then take your mom out for coffee (if she drinks coffee) to start a nice mother-and-son day at the beach or the cinema.  Don't focus exclusively on your surgery/new gender role, but don't avoid those topics either.  If she freaks out once, try to calm her down.  If she freaks out again, leave.|`|cVrMpPjsaa	Just tell them brother. It happens all the time in Indonesia.

So ziemlich alle meiner Freundinnen schlafen mit ihren Freunden nur mit Pille... Die Begruendung dafuer ist dann "weil es viel geiler ist ohne Kondom"... Finde ich nicht gerade verantwortungsbewusst... Vor allen Dingen da diese Freundinnen das auch nicht erst gemacht haben, als sie sehr lange zusammen waren, sondern von Anfang an... Nem Aidstest hat sich auch noch keine dieser Freundinnen unterzogen... Selbst kann ich aus Erfahrung sagen, dass es gar nicht so ein grosser Unterschied ist, ob ohne Kondom oder mit... Schliesslich geht es um den Rest meines Lebens, ob wegen einem Kind oder wegen einer Krankheit, man kann es sich wirklich versauen mit sowas... Und wer bei einem One Night Stand ohne Kondom verhuetet, hat einfach selbst schuld.. so doof kann man doch eigentlich gar nich sein.. Bin der meinung, wenn heutzutage jemand ungewollt schwanger wird ist es in fast allen faellen eigene schuld, es gibt genug wege zu verhueten (und auch sicher zu verhueten) doppelt haelt besser ^^|`|3srVBtL1aa	Das ist wohl der naive Glaube, dass man den Menschen vertrauen kann.|`|AA10700076	Meine Partnerin hatte einen negativen HIV-Test, allerdings nicht ganz aktuell. So benutzten wir stets Kondome. Zum Glück, wie sich herausstellte, denn bei einer Bluttransfusion (nicht in Europa) war sie inzwischen angesteckt worden.<br>  <br>  Zu den Teilnehmenden an Talk Shows: da outen sich viele so, dass man sagen muss, die seien zu unreif für Sex gewesen, der ja immer mit Verantwortung verbunden ist. Die erste Verantwortung ist die Benutzung eines Kondoms, und wer darauf verzichtet, kann die Verantwortung für ein Kind tragen müssen/dürfen oder mit der Verantwortung dafür leben müssen, jemanden angesteckt zu haben.<br>  Mit "zu unreif" meine ich nicht unbedingt "zu jung".

Das bewahrt Dich aber nicht davor, dass das Kondom mal reissen kann und die Pille mal vergessen oder wieder ausgeschieden wurde. Kann immer passieren.<br>  <br>  Also, ein gewisses risiko bleibt immer, es sei denn, man übt sich in Enthaltsamkeit, bis man einem Menschen begegnet, dem man wirklch absolut vertrauen kann.<br>  Dann braucht man irgendwann auch kein Kondom und dann auch keine Pille mehr!<br>  <br>  Aber das mit der Enthaltsamkeit ist halt wirklich so eine Sache und ich glaube einfach, es hat nichts mit Intelligenz zu tun, wenn Du in DEM Moment, wo das Kondom ins Gespr?ch kommen MUSS, keinen Rückzieher als Frau machst, weil er es nicht überziehen will. Das ist dann einfach Willensst?rke und die ist bei jedem Menschen unterschiedlich ausgepr?gt.<br>  Irgendwann sollten sich auch bei einer Frau das Hirn aus- und die Hormone anschalten. Sonst ist doof.

M4Ij7Pqtaa	No...It all just really boils down to either you believe or you don't.  I do!|`|wY8jE8HEaa	MATTER: The Other Name for Illusion<br>  <br>  What is explained in this book is an important truth, which has surprised many and changed their perspectives on life. This truth can be summarized as follows: "All events and objects that we encounter in real life-buildings, people, cities, cars, places-in fact, everything we see, hold, touch, smell, taste and hear-come into existence as visions and feelings in our brains".<br>  <br>  We are taught to think that these images and feelings are caused by a solid world outside of our brains, where material things exist. However, in reality we never see real existing materials and we never touch real materials. In other words, every material entity which we believe exists in our lives, is, in fact, only a vision which is created in our brains. <br>  <br>  This is not a philosophical speculation. It is an empirical fact that has been proven by modern science. Today, any scientist who is a specialist in medicine, biology, neurology or any other field related to brain research would say, when asked how and where we see the world, that we see the whole world in the vision center located in our brains. <br>  <br>  This fact has been scientifically proven in the twentieth century, and although it may seem surprising, it necessarily implies answers to two questions; "If our lives are visions created in our brains, then who is it that creates these visions? And who is it that sees these visions in our brains without having eyes and enjoys them, gets excited and happy?" You will find the answers to these two important questions in this book.|`|11d70d4b12abc40a7c25e217544293c2aa	brain chemistry|`|XuRR6Uh9aa	Yes, it's just our brains tricking us again.

200eb03e7dbc1dd453bc5141b81430f1aa	La verdad no se por que existimos pero lo investigare con la ciencia y con logica no con fe...<br>  <br>  Saludos...|`|M3lFFILPaa	Con los nuevos descubrimientos del Universo te faltan aún mas pruebas ?<br>  <br>  La creación aún no ha terminado, estamos rodeados de micros y macros tan perfectos que no pueden atribuirse a la casualidad o a la evolución.<br>  <br>  Algo mas palpable que nos demuestra la existencia de Dios, EL AMOR con este sentimiento no nos cabe la menor duda que somos productos de Dios, que nos hizo a su imagen y semejanza: A su imagen por la capacidad que tenemos de AMAR y a su semejanza, por nuestro libre albedrío, cada quien es libre de creer o no.<br>  <br>  Desafortunadamente todos los humanos traemos adentro la madre de todos los demás pecados, LA SOBERBIA que además de no dejarnos ver ( cuando no queremos ), se nos quitará media hora después de muertos, ráscale el pié a un muerto fresco y verás como encoge la pierna.<br>  <br>  <br>   ?La vida es sue?o?, aseveraba Don Calderón de la Barca, y no sin razón. Con frecuencia identificamos los sue?os con el candor ingenuo de la juventud, pero la verdad es que para un hombre dejar de so?ar es dejar de existir. Todos necesitamos de sue?os que alimenten el alma y den sentido a nuestra vida. El ingeniero sue?a con un lucrativo sistema computacional, el abogado en montarse sobre un BMW, el prisionero en caminar libre por las calles, el policía azotando el crimen al estilo James Bond, y el ciego en contemplar a las personas que ama. Y así todos vamos proyectando una barahúnda de deseos que pincelamos en cuadros de mil colores y formas. Pero en el fondo, todos so?amos en lo mismo: so?amos en ser felices. <br>  <br>  Pero, ?por qué nos huye la felicidad cuando alcanzamos esos sue?os?, ?a qué se debe esa taca?ería y falta de educación?, ?de dónde ese absurdo? <br>  <br>  Quizá acaece, porque hemos despreciado el supuesto de toda felicidad: la humildad. Suena extra?o, pero la experiencia nos habrá ense?ado que el mundo está cuajado de paradojas, y esta, sin duda, es una de ellas. <br>  <br>  Mientras que otras virtudes ensanchan nuestros pechos y nos evocan bellos paisajes, la humildad, por el contrario, tiene un sabor amargo y más bien, nos recuerda el fracaso y la miseria. Por eso no es raro que concibamos la humildad como un artificio medieval, un analgésico del mediocre o el apellido del zonzo del salón. A tal grado nos convencemos de ello, que llegamos a entender que manso y menso son sinónimos, o por lo menos parientes de significado. Pero la realidad es bien distinta. <br>  <br>  La humildad, de suyo, tiene una carga fuertemente positiva. La humildad es la condición necesaria del amor, dimensionado en aquella fórmula radical y revolucionaria: “Amarás al Se?or, tu Dios con todo tu corazón… y a tu prójimo como a ti mismo”. Porque el amor es la fusión con el amado a través de una negación (humildad), que nos autoafirma y enriquece. Negación que no es por otra parte, una pura negación ciega; al contrario, es una negación de una falsa concepción de lo que decimos amar. Y en este sentido, la humildad entra en la esfera de la verdad. Por ello, qué bien dijo la Santa de ávila al engalanar la humildad con la verdad: ?la humildad es la verdad?. He aquí su razón de ser. <br>  <br>  Decimos que un buen televisor es aquel que nos hace protagonistas de la serie, que una buena licuadora es la que cumple con los milagros que garantiza el empaque, y que un buen perro es el que ahuyenta las visitas indeseadas. Pero en el caso del hombre su realización trasciende el tiempo y el espacio, ya que es un ser capaz de conocer, querer y sobre todo de amar. Por ello, escribía San Agustín lo siguiente: ?Nos hiciste Se?or para ti y nuestro corazón está inquieto hasta que descanse en ti?. Y precisamente en esto consiste la primera parte de la humildad, en reconocer a Dios como lo que es para poder amarlo de verdad. Así, la humildad consiste en tener el coraje de romper el cascarón de nuestro egoísmo, en acabar con nuestros esquemas de autosuficiencia, abrir nuestro corazón y dejarnos sorprender por el cari?o de un Dios que supo sacar del polvo, hijos a su imagen y semejanza. No por nada el diablo, cuyo significado etimológico es “el que divide”, tiene como principal empe?o separarnos de Dios, a través de la seductora locución “y seréis como dioses”, que hoy se disfraza con el nombre de “libertad”, “tolerancia”, “igualdad”, “salud”… Sin embargo, la historia que es elocuente, nos ha ense?ado que tener la bendición de Dios es garantía de éxito. El Arca de Noé fue construida por aficionados; el Titanic por profesionales. <br>  <br>  Pero la humildad se cristaliza también en el día a día. Curiosamente los términos humildad y humanidad hunden raíces en el mismo origen: “humus” que significa polvo, tierra, humo. Así que la humildad de cara al prójimo será amarle por lo que es y tal como es. También es alegrarse con las victorias del prójimo y perdonar sus errores naturales, ya que posiblemente el motivo de tantos matrimonios destruidos, familias divididas, conflictos sociales se deben a que nos ha faltado humildad. Pero si miramos un poco el Evangelio, descubriremos que Jesucristo no amó únicamente a “súper-hombres” inmaculados, sino que amó a publicanos, pecadores y hasta sus propios enemigos. Además no perdió nunca la confianza en sus “grandes” apóstoles, de los cuales uno le vendió y los demás pusieron “a todo vapor” sus piernas cuando la sombra de la cruz se presentó. <br>  <br>  Pero, sin duda, la parte más difícil de la humildad, es el justo reconocimiento de nosotros mismos, y en consecuencia el justo amor a nosotros mismos. Y es un reconocernos como somos, sin un más y sin un menos. El hombre humilde es el que acepta sus defectos, ese que sabe decir “no sé”, uno que aprende a fracasar sin desfallecer, aquel que transforma en amor el sufrimiento que lo limita. Pero, sobre todo, el hombre humilde es aquel que reconoce los propios talentos como dones de Dios que van aparejados a una misión Porque sencillez sin humildad es timidez, inteligencia sin humildad es corrupción, caridad sin humildad es hipocresía, docilidad sin humildad es adulación, pobreza sin humildad es resignación, dolor sin humildad es un ridículo. Sin embargo, la fe con humildad es certeza, la oración con humildad es gratitud, la vida con humildad es un milagro, y el hombre humilde es un homenaje a su Creador. <br>  <br>  En definitiva, la humildad es una actitud que nace del y para el amor. Y si nos parece amarga es porque es una buena medicina del alma, en cuanto que nos purifica; nos hace más del amado y menos de nosotros mismos. Así que cuando so?emos en ser felices, recordemos a Aquél que nos dijo: “Aprended de mí que soy manso y humilde de corazón y encontraréis vuestro descanso”. <br>  <br>  La locura, como el chocolate, es una virtud, nos carga de endorfinas, empeque?ese el estres, volvámonos locos y verás un mundo diferente.<br>  <br>  <br>  Sí, locura de Cristo: <br>  <br>  Siendo Dios Omnipotente, fuerte, Majestad...se hace bebé, débil, necesitado, pobre, indefenso, digno de compasión, con ojos para llorar y reír, con manos para trabajar, con cuerpo para sufrir, con corazón para compadecerse de nosotros, los hombres. ?No es esto locura? Si locura es exceso de algo, desconcierto, el salirse uno de sus casillas...aquí en Belén Dios salió de sus casillas divinas para tropezarse con la choza, pobre y necesitada, del hombre. <br>  <br>  Locura precisamente porque cuando el mundo estaba en grave descomposición, en grave crisis moral (libertinaje), en grave degeneración, en un auténtico colapso espiritual (basta leer el inicio de la carta a los romanos para darnos cuenta de cómo estaba el mundo antes de que Cristo viniese por vez primera), es en ese momento cuando aparece en nuestra pobre historia humana el sol naciente que venía a enterrar ese ocaso ya descompuesto y en putrefacción. Y no sólo crisis moral, sino también social (ociosidad: en las ma?anas se dedicaban a recibir visitas, a hablar de todo y de nada), gimnasia, sauna o ba?o y una comida de lujo); crisis económica (auténtica bancarrota, debido al placer y al lujo). <br>  <br>  Locura también porque viniendo como Médico divino a sanar a un gran enfermo, la Humanidad...este enfermo no le abre las puertas, no le acepta en su mesón, no quiere saber nada de El, y prefiere que el cáncer que le carcome por dentro siga galopando hasta matarle el alma. <br>  <br>  Locura porque viniendo el Mesías por tanto tiempo esperado, nadie le reconoce, pues se presentó en ropa de pordiosero. <br>  <br>  Locura porque siendo Rey, viene en plan de mendigo, pidiendo un trozo de tierra para nacer, un latido de mujer, unos brazos que le sostengan, unos labios que le besen...y nace en un pesebre, posada ésta indigna para un Dios, pero al parecer más digna que el corazón de los hombres. <br>  <br>  Locura porque siendo Pastor amoroso, encuentra que sus ovejas no sólo están dispersas, sino que siguen la voz de otros pastores que son ladrones y salteadores que les han manchado y robado el alma, pero que les han prometido paraísos de muerte. <br>  <br>  Locura porque viniendo como Luz verdadera, los hombres prefirieron las tinieblas para seguir haciendo sus perversas obras. <br>  <br>  Locura porque viniendo como Manjar y alimento, los hombres disfrutaron de los alimentos corruptibles que les dejaban más hastiados. <br>  <br>  Locura porque precisamente cuando el hombre vivía en su más atroz egoísmo, personificado en el tirano Herodes y en los ingratos posaderos de Jerusalén y en la inconsciencia de casi todos los humanos...Dios viene a darnos su corazón, pedazo tras pedazo. Pedazo en Belén; el primer latido del Hijo de Dios. Pedazos en Nazaret. Pedazos en la vida pública. Y el último latido en el Calvario. <br>  <br>  El único motivo que movió a Dios a hacerse hombre fue el amor. No, no pudo ser el pecado, porque de una causa tan horrible (el pecado) no podía brotar un efecto tan extraordinario y generoso (la Encarnación del Hijo de Dios). La causa fue el amor; y la ocasión para que Dios manifestara una vez más ese amor que le desbordaba su corazón fue el pecado de los hombres. Quiso, por puro amor, sin estar obligado a nada, salir a la reconquista del hombre, pues El había venido a llamar a los pecadores. <br>  <br>  Y ese amor de Cristo en la Encarnación y durante toda su vida fue: <br>  <br>  1. Incomparable y único porque nos ama con todo su corazón. No ama como hacemos los mortales, "a ratos". Incomparable, porque nada hay que se pueda comparar con este misterio: un Dios que se hace peque?o. único, porque como Dios nadie puede amarnos nunca. <br>  <br>  2. Amor sanante porque viene a cubrir nuestras miserias, a condescender con nuestras fragilidades, a perdonar nuestros más hondos pecados. A pesar de que había una distancia infinita entre Dios y el hombre, entre el ser y la nada, entre la santidad y el pecado...sin embargo, para el amor no hay distancias ni obstáculos invencibles. Tanto se abajó el Hijo de Dios al hacerse hombre que san Pablo no vacila en llamar a este misterio no sólo destrucción sino auténtico aniquilamiento: "exinanivit, formam servi accipiens": tomando la forma de siervo. <br>  <br>  3. Amor elevante porque no sólo limpia, sino que diviniza; no sólo perdona, sino que da la fuerza para auparnos a besar a Dios, a abrazarle, a acunarle. Sabemos por la sana filosofía que el amor cuando nace tiende irresistiblemente hacia la unión espiritual con el amado; y ese amor, cuando se consuma no es otra cosa que esa misma unión. Ahora bien, como el hombre no podía elevarse por sí mismo hacia Dios y abrazarle, entonces tuvo que ser el mismo Dios quien se agachó a nosotros, como contaba el filósofo chino. Pero al agacharse, Dios no perdió nada ("Siendo El de condición divina...", Fp 2,6). <br>  <br>  Navidad: desbordamiento del amor de Dios al hombre. Locura del amor de Dios. Si queremos que haya Navidad en nuestro corazón no tenemos otra cosa que hacer que abrir el corazón y aceptar esa invasión del amor de Dios. Ojalá que también nuestro amor a El y a nuestros hermanos tenga algo de locura, porque nos damos sin medida, sin tasa, sin regateos, sin taca?erías. <br>  <br>  Pidamos la locura del amor. Tenemos que incendiar este mundo y hacer de él un inmenso manicomio espiritual donde sólo tengan visado los apasionados y locos por Cristo y por el Reino. <br>  <br>  El que tenga oidos para oir que oiga, el que tenga ojos para ver que vea.<br>  <br>  Que Dios te bendiga y te ilumine.|`|MHKe8zApaa	no se por que existo... jajajaj<br>  supongo que nunca me deje caer en esa creencia fantastica(no fantastico de maravilloso, fantastica de fantasia, cuento, etc...)|`|rdWzxGFFaa	Coincido contigo.

De hecho, ya con el tiempo cuando Moises escribio los primeros 5 libras de la biblia por inspiracion divina, en genesis hablo de enormes bestias y de mounstruos marinos quizas dando alucion a la epoca en que existieron los dinosaurios. En fin no debemos darle importancia ni tener ningun tipo de controversias con respecto a este tema pues no tiene relevancia, no me importa cuando existieron ni dejaron de existir. debemos darle mucho mas importancia a cosas que realmente lo sean.como por ejemplo : hace mas de 500 a?os de descubrio que la tierra era redonda, cuando ya la biblia se le adelanto diciendo: " que hay alguien que mora por encima del circulo de la tierra" *(Dios) otro ejemplo es que los medicos descubrieron que si se sanitisaban o se dsinfectaban las manos despues de tocar a un muerto, antes de atender un parto por ejemplo ,disminuirian las muertes por infecciones, cuando Dios habia dado leyes de limpieza en ese sentido, y lucas que era medico seguia esta ley......y asi por el estilo....estas son cosas que muchas gentes ignoran por no leer la biblia, libros de historia o cualquier otro libro que pueda instruirnos de manera positiva.|`|FSDMf0BJaa	Eso no lo podemos saber ni conocer nosotros, pero la historia demuetra qeu esos animales si existieron, lo que no sabemos es si fue en tiempo de Adan y Eva.<br>  <br>  No podemos decir qeu fueron los Testigos de Jehova quienes lo dijeron y menos ofenderlos y llamarlos Testiculos de Jehova, es una falta de Respeto no contra ellos sino contra Dios, que dia a dia nos da todo lo necesario para que vivamos y no lo hace para que ofendamos a quienes le sirven.

HLbvUDjGaa	JODERR SI ES ASI, ESPERO VER A HITLER Y A STALIN ALLA!|`|EpfxNhUcaa	La muerte de Jesús es el hecho central del evangelio cristiano. Es descrita en forma mas detallada que el resto de su ministerio y los apóstoles le dan prioridad <br>  1 Corintios 2:2 me propuse no saber entre vosotros cosa alguna sino a Jesucristo, y a éste crucificado. <br>  <br>  La Biblia nos ofrece vida eterna y es porque normalmente la vida humana no es eterna, sino que tiene un término, un punto final: la muerte es muy real, <br>  <br>  ?Por qué existe la muerte? Por causa del pecado. El pecado es el problema esencial, tendemos por naturaleza a concebir y realizar acciones que no concuerdan con la voluntad de Dios. <br>  2. <br>  Génesis 2:16-17, <br>  2:16 Y mandó Jehová Dios al hombre, diciendo: De todo árbol del huerto podrás comer; <br>  2:17 mas del árbol de la ciencia del bien y del mal no comerás; porque el día que de él comieres, ciertamente morirás<br>  <br>  Génesis 3:17-19: 3:17 Y al hombre dijo: Por cuanto obedeciste a la voz de tu mujer, y comiste del árbol de que te mandé diciendo: No comerás de él; maldita será la tierra por tu causa; con dolor comerás de ella todos los días de tu vida. <br>  3:18 Espinos y cardos te producirá,  y comerás plantas del campo. <br>  3:19 Con el sudor de tu rostro comerás el pan hasta que vuelvas a la tierra, porque de ella fuiste tomado <br>  Palabras fatídicas, sentencia inapelable, sin recurso. <br>  El resultado general de la trasgresión de Adán para la humanidad se describe en <br>  Génesis 6:5. Y vio Jehová que la maldad de los hombres era mucha en la tierra, y que todo designio de los pensamientos del corazón de ellos era de continuo solamente el mal<br>  <br>  Dios no dejó al hombre en un estado de total desesperanza, porque desde los primeros libros de la Biblia se vislumbra una solución, el perdón de pecados. éxodo 34:6-9 (la palabra clave es perdonar). <br>  <br>  El Dios de la Biblia es un Dios apartado del mal; no puede tolerar la desobediencia. El no puede perdonar a todo el mundo indiscriminadamente porque sería violar sus propias normas y su santidad, dejando sin efecto la sentencia de muerte que pronunció sobre Adán y sus descendientes, la cual no ha sido dejada sin efecto, puesto que la mayoría de hombres se encaminan hacia una muerte eterna por ignorancia, descuido o rebeldía.<br>  <br>  Dios puede perdonar a los que tienen fe en el pero aun no es suficiente; la fe bíblica no es una fe ciega, una fe ignorante. La idea fundamental es la de volver la espalda al pecado y a la rebelión y volver la cara a Dios para buscarlo y obedecerlo.<br>  <br>  <br>  Marcos 1:4: Bautizaba Juan en el desierto, y predicaba el bautismo de arrepentimiento para perdón de pecados.<br>  <br>  El profeta Juan el Bautista se presentó a Israel predicando el bautismo de arrepentimiento para el perdón de los pecados. Aquí dos palabras: arrepentimiento y perdón,<br>  <br>  Marcos 1:14-15:  Después que Juan fue encarcelado, Jesús vino a Galilea predicando el evangelio del reino de Dios, 15 diciendo: El tiempo se ha cumplido, y el reino de Dios se ha acercado; arrepentíos, y creed en el evangelio<br>  <br>  El Se?or Jesucristo también predicaba el arrepentimiento como requisito del perdón.<br>  <br>  En ambos testamentos, la salvación de la muerte es por medio del perdón de pecados, concedido solamente a las personas que se arrepienten de sus pecados. Esto incluye también la salvación que viene por medio de la muerte del Se?or Jesucristo, porque es la única forma de salvación conocida en la Biblia.<br>  <br>  La confirmación.<br>  <br>  Efesios 1:7. 1:7 en quien tenemos redención por su sangre, el perdón de pecados  según las riquezas de su gracia,  Esta es la confirmación de lo que se ha dicho:<br>   la redención que se consigue por medio de la sangre (es decir, la muerte) de Jesucristo es el perdón de pecados. Colosenses 1:13,14 dice lo mismo. ?Cómo puede la muerte de Jesucristo hace más de 1,900 a?os ayudarnos a obtener el perdón de pecados? <br>  <br>  Gálatas 2:20.. Pablo dice "Con Cristo estoy juntamente crucificado <br>  El llamado que Jesús hizo a sus discípulos en Lucas 9:23: "Si alguno quiere venir en pos de mí, niéguese a sí mismo, tome su cruz cada día y sígame." Jesús repite este mismo llamado en Lucas 14:27. La única razón para tomar una cruz es para ser crucificado en ella. <br>  <br>  Colosenses 2:11-13. <br>   "sepultados con él en el bautismo." Pablo está escribiendo a creyentes bautizados, y si les dice que han sido sepultados con Cristo al bautizarse, obviamente es porque también han sido crucificados con él, no literalmente, por supuesto, pero sí en forma simbólica. Esto es confirmado por Colosenses 2:20. <br>  <br>   En el v. 13: "os dio vida juntamente con él, perdonándoos todos los pecados."<br>  <br>   Pablo desarrolla este concepto en <br>  Romanos 6:3-6: ?O no sabéis que todos los que hemos sido bautizados en Cristo Jesús, hemos sido bautizados en su muerte? 4 Porque somos sepultados juntamente con él para muerte por el bautismo, a fin de que como Cristo resucitó de los muertos por la gloria del Padre, así también nosotros andemos en vida nueva. 5 Porque si fuimos plantados juntamente con él en la semejanza de su muerte, así también lo seremos en la de su resurrección; 6 sabiendo esto, que nuestro viejo hombre fue crucificado juntamente con él, para que el cuerpo del pecado sea destruido, a fin de que no sirvamos más al pecado. <br>  <br>   Entonces, es obvio que el creyente es una persona que considera que ha sido crucificada y sepultada con su Se?or, y por eso ha recibido la salvación, es decir, el perdón de pecados. Pero, ?qué significa o implica el que uno considere que ha sido crucificado con Cristo, y por qué le será otorgado el perdón de pecados por eso?<br>  <br>  La respuesta es que el crucificarse con Cristo es una manera de expresar nuestro arrepentimiento, y eso nos califica o habilita para recibir el perdón divino. Jesús era un ser humano como nosotros, tentado de la misma manera en que nosotros lo somos, altamente consciente de que el pecado moraba en su corazón y que tenía que estar alerta las 24 horas del día para no caer en el pecado. Es esencial que reconozcamos esta verdad acerca del Se?or Jesucristo. El no cometió pecado, pero el pecado moraba en su carne en el sentido de la tendencia innata del corazón humano de desobedecer a Dios. Si no fuera por eso, no habría sido realmente tentado al igual que nosotros, como Hebreos dice que lo fue (Hebreos 4:15, 2:18); y no le habría costado trabajo obedecer a su Padre; pero los evangelistas nos dicen que en el huerto de Getsemaní el deseo de no entregarse a ser crucificado, es decir, de rebelarse contra la voluntad de su Padre, era tan fuerte que el sudor caía de su rostro como grandes gotas de sangre.<br>  <br>   Entonces la tendencia a la desobediencia, es decir, al pecado, moraba en el Se?or Jesucristo, pero cuando él se entregó a ser crucificado, poniendo a muerte su carne, esa tendencia fue definitivamente eliminada. Destruyó al pecado en sí mismo, y su cuerpo quedó colgado en la cruz a la vista pública como una forma de decir "Esto es lo que vale la pecaminosa carne humana; sólo merece ser destruida–sólo merece la muerte"; leamos y meditemos en Romanos 7:14-24; 8:3-4. Jesús destruyó literalmente la pecaminosidad en su carne cuando se entregó a ser crucificado. Cuando nosotros nos crucificamos en sentido figurado con Cristo, esto quiere decir que reconocemos que somos pecaminosos por naturaleza y que por eso merecemos la muerte, y nos comprometemos a poner a muerte esa pecaminosidad que está dentro de nosotros, así como Cristo literalmente lo hizo en la cruz. En términos literales y no figurados, eso significa rechazar el dominio que nuestra mente pecaminosa quiere ejercer sobre nuestros pensamientos y acciones, resistiendo su coacción y dedicándonos a conocer y hacer la voluntad de Dios; leamos pensativamente<br>  <br>  Romanos 6:11-14:  Así también vosotros consideraos muertos al pecado, pero vivos para Dios en Cristo Jesús, Se?or nuestro. 12 No reine, pues, el pecado en vuestro cuerpo mortal, de modo que lo obedezcáis en sus concupiscencias; 13 ni tampoco presentéis vuestros miembros al pecado como instrumentos de iniquidad, sino presentaos vosotros mismos a Dios como vivos de entre los muertos, y vuestros miembros a Dios como instrumentos de justicia. 14 Porque el pecado no se ense?oreará de vosotros; pues no estáis bajo la ley, sino bajo la gracia.<br>  Gálatas 5:24: Pero los que son de Cristo han crucificado la carne con sus pasiones y deseos.<br>  <br>  Colosenses 3:5-8: Haced morir, pues, lo terrenal en vosotros: fornicación, impureza, pasiones desordenadas, malos deseos y avaricia, que es idolatría; 6 cosas por las cuales la ira de Dios viene sobre los hijos de desobediencia, 7 en las cuales vosotros también anduvisteis en otro tiempo cuando vivíais en ellas. 8 Pero ahora dejad también vosotros todas estas cosas: ira, enojo, malicia, blasfemia, palabras deshonestas de vuestra boca.<br>  <br>  De manera que el creyente hace un papel muy activo en su propia salvación; no es algo mágico o misterioso sino algo coherente y comprensible. Requiere nuestro entendimiento, anuencia y participación activa; es el "sacrificio vivo" que Pablo nos manda que ofrezcamos en Romanos 12:1: Así que, hermanos, os ruego por las misericordias de Dios, que presentéis vuestros cuerpos en sacrificio vivo, santo, agradable a Dios, que es vuestro culto racional. Obviamente esto es difícil de realizar en la práctica, pero a la persona que se entrega de lleno a esta tarea Dios se lo reconoce como la más profunda expresión de arrepentimiento y le da el perdón de pecados basado en su crucifixión personal con Cristo. Esta es la forma en que la muerte de Cristo nos beneficia; este es la esencia del evangelio. Su muerte es un modelo a seguir, un patrón a imitar. No es que Cristo haya muerto en nuestro lugar, como algunas veces se afirma; no es que haya "pagado el precio" de nuestros pecados ni que haya apaciguado la ira de Dios por medio de su muerte. Cristo no nos salva muriendo en nuestro lugar, sino solamente si nosotros morimos con él, tomándolo como modelo, lo que es una cosa bien diferente. Dios promete perdonar nuestros pecado en respuesta a esta expresión de nuestro arrepentimiento. El momento en que morimos simbólicamente con Cristo es el momento de nuestro bautismo en él.<br>  <br>  Otros pasajes relevantes son Salmos 32:1-2:  Bienaventurado aquel cuya transgresión ha sido perdonada, y cubierto su pecado. 2 Bienaventurado el hombre a quien Jehová no culpa de iniquidad, Y en cuyo espíritu no hay enga?o.<br>  <br>  el cual Pablo cita en Romanos 4:1-8 para explicar que "justificación" es el término que él utiliza para designar el perdón de pecados. Leamos también<br>  <br>  Salmos 51:1-2: Ten piedad de mí, oh Dios, conforme a tu misericordia; Conforme a la multitud de tus piedades borra mis rebeliones. 2 Lávame más y más de mi maldad, Y límpiame de mi pecado. <br>  <br>  Salmos 51:7-10:  Purifícame con hisopo, y seré limpio; Lávame, y seré más blanco que la nieve. 8 Hazme oír gozo y alegría, Y se recrearán los huesos que has abatido. 9 Esconde tu rostro de mis pecados, Y borra todas mis maldades. 10 Crea en mí, oh Dios, un corazón limpio, Y renueva un espíritu recto dentro de mí. <br>  <br>  que contienen algunas de las muchas metáforas que utilizan los escritores de Antiguo Testamento para expresar la idea del perdón, el cual es un tema extenso en sí.<br>  <br>  Otros pasajes relevantes son:<br>  <br>  2 Corintios 5:14-15: Porque el amor de Cristo nos constri?e, pensando esto: que si uno murió por todos, luego todos murieron; 15 y por todos murió, para que los que viven, ya no vivan para sí, sino para aquel que murió y resucitó por ellos.<br>  <br>  Colosenses 3:5-6: Haced morir, pues, lo terrenal en vosotros: fornicación, impureza, pasiones desordenadas, malos deseos y avaricia, que es idolatría; cosas por las cuales la ira de Dios viene sobre los hijos de desobediencia. . .<br>  <br>  y 1 Pedro 4:1-2: Puesto que Cristo ha padecido por nosotros en la carne, vosotros también armaos del mismo pensamiento; pues quien ha padecido en la carne, terminó con el pecado, 2 para no vivir el tiempo que resta en la carne, conforme a las concupiscencias de los hombres, sino conforme a la voluntad de Dios.|`|Q2PmptbCaa	hola que tal, mira dios no hace eso porque simplemente NO EXISTE, asi que nunca nos llevara a ningun lugar...<br>  tu crees que si existiera y todo lo perdona y es bueno, no nos hubiera llevado desde cuando para el paraiso y  si fuera tan poderoso como dice la gente  ya halla tomado medidas para que no existira el pecado.<br>  <br>  suerte!|`|0dcdf2a0cf495a156fa737cee59885c5aa	porque es un dios criminal , de oriente medio tenia que ser|`|bTrxLVk5aa	Lee detenidamente EFESIOS .Todo el capitulo.<br>  Yo pido a Dios que al hacerlo te dé revelación y sabiduría de lo alto.<br>  Dios te bendiga , y te guarde, te muestre SU ROSTRO y tenga misericordia de tí...|`|d2c732aea14b5f08986d0b8ee8bc49b8aa	Te aseguro que un día se dejará de juegos....es el día en que dejes este mundo y te toque partir al...?que contruiste? ?cielo o infierno?<br>  =)|`|xY5J3wpxaa	No !!, vamos a estar todos en bolas y comiendo manzanas !!!,,|`|443e8ce91d280b2505394714766bea16aa	porque como vos lo dijiste, son nuestros pecados y debemos responder por ellos aparte si no respondemos por ellos y no nos arrepentimos volveremos a hacerlos así estemos en el paraíso|`|B4OmjFUqaa	El sabe cuando lo hará.

(Karin-chan)<br>  "-senpai" someone who is your superior. (Kakashi-senpai)<br>  "-sensei" used for a teacher. (Asuma-sensei)<br>  "-san" is used for someone who is older than you, that you have respect for, or that you have just met. (Yuki-san)<br>  "-kun" is a suffix used at the end of a male's name, either for familiarity or respect. (Sasuke-kun)<br>  "-sama" is a suffix used for great respect like "Lord". (Orochimaru-sama)<br>  "-dono" used to indicate respect and is very polite.

Meaning a VIP. <br>  <br>  It is also common curtesy to address someone in their last name if you do not know them well enough or do not know them at all. Such as if my name was Tomoe, Masako (introductions always begin with last name first, then the first name). You would address me as Tomoe-san.<br>  <br>  If we were friends you could address me as Tomoe-chan, or if perhaps we were close enough friends you could call me Masako-chan.<br>  <br>  lolz It takes some getting used to but if you are going to Japan or planning to knowing these lil tidbits can actually be very helpful.|`|32a91c12e4881f79de9e44ddd590fa9aaa	-san is used when talking to older ppl or when u dont know them very well and -chan when talking to ppl around ur age n are close to u, like friends.|`|w0Ta5kk0aa	San is used to show respect to a person.You are not supposed to say Hamada.Thats is plain disrespect.The name should be Hamada-san or O-Hamada-san for ultimate respect.Generally names without -san -chan -kun etc are only used between familly.<br>  Ps. -Kun is only used for boys of some age (0-15)|`|66601bca8a8d5009a3f920564c1d0032aa	Its a sign of respect,It relation to english it would be MR.

There are perfectly good explanations for how we exist without having to resort to having us created by a deity. For one thing, if we're so complex that we need a deity to create us...then how come that deity is NOT so complex to need another deity to create it? Why do you think it reasonable that we're not at the top, but that the being immediately above us (God) is necessarily at the top?<br>  <br>  >I still say that because of our ability to reason, and rationalize, it shows that it is not possible that we came from nothing.<br>  <br>  I don't think we came from nothing either, at least not in any direct sense. However, unlike you, I am open-minded enough to recognize that 'created from nothing' and 'not created by God' are two entirely different things, and to claim that they are equivalent is to commit a false dilemma fallacy.

23Vxd9Lbaa	Because they don't have an answer for that, they say that he has always existed because he is a timeless being; an existence.

Each of the Jewish festivals have a description, and while Sukkot (Tabernacles) is called Zman simchateinu (the time of rejoicing), Passover is called Zman cheiruteinu - the time of our redemption.  The seders are a time for talking about our freedom from slavery, and rejoicing in that freedom, but at the same time we spill out some of our wine in memory of the plagues, and pray for the coming redemption when we will no longer be victims and will no longer have to live without a Temple.

You and I and everyone else are made up of the same fundemental material: energy, light.. we are all, even in death the same thing. God is you, and me, and everything that exists either in thought, or physically. It is ok to physically manifest god because that is just a manifestation of your hopes for life, humanity and all else. If no one believed in a higher power, then all life would be hopeless and that is a very disconcerting thought. Just know that all the elements of everything exist in you and you truly know how to live you life. rest assured there is an "afterlife", only it's not a kingdom in some utopian place, it is outer space, it is inner space, it is changing from one form to another. consious serves a purpose and I believe it carries on in some form.... so i guess my answer is.. yes god exists!|`|AA12275780	I can no more dis-prove gods existence than I can fairies or trolls or anythng else that could be.

I am Buddhist, but still believe that God Exist.|`|z6pdkgXCaa	Yes, He exists.  You don't have to see Him to believe. Absence of physical manifestation is irrelevant and does not prove inexistence.  <br>  <br>  You don't see the wind, but do you believe it exists? <br>  <br>  Same way believers don't see God: they feel His presence in their life so they know He exists.  Better yet, why don't you ask Him yourself?|`|AA10071409	Yes, God does exist! Here is how I know:<br>  Incidentally I wasn't saved until I was 21 years old. But this experience proved God's existence to me.<br>  <br>  When I was about 12 or 13 years old, my mother asked me to go to the store on a very hot summer day. I had to ride my bike up a very big hill. I hated it. I didn't want to go. But I had to obey my mom so, off I went. As I walked my bike up the big hill, sweat dripping off of me and the sun beating down harshly, I prayed. I prayed and asked God to send my stepfather down the hill in his truck so he would see me and pick me up and take me to the store. I was in tears because it was so hot that day I wanted to die. As I continued up the hill, I kept on praying and crying out to God.<br>  As I reached the end of my road, I saw my dad's truck! He looked over and saw me walking and naturally he picked me up and took me to the store, just like I had prayed for.  <br>  The specific answer to my prayers shook me to my core. Even at that young age, I understood that God existed. And although I didn't come to know Jesus as my Lord and Savior until 9 years later, that day seeds were most definitely planted in my heart. I never forgot God's kindness to me that hot summer day. And I knew, without a doubt, He existed. <br>  |`|ofYWRIwjaa	God probably does exist.  He is an intelligent mind that does not usually reveal itself.

When I was confused about Christianity and the whole concept of hell recently I tried to not believe in God because I really I hated the idea of a hell but his existence became more and more obvious to me, I think because he didn't want me to stop believing.  But I believe in hell now because I know it is real but because of Jesus Christ I need never see hell!  <br>  <br>  Also how can life come from non-life?  How could the whole world and us be so perfectly formed from a bunch of random coincidences? |`|oHrqbdydaa	God probably evolved just like humans did. As man grew in intelligence, he created God out of his dream life. Also as man grew to understand the world more, he had to push God further and further way...first God was in nature, then on the tops of mountains, then in clouds and lightning and now he's in Outer Space.<br>  <br>  |`|7ylYxklsaa	I don't believe in a invisible, dude-looking, old bearded man up in heaven kind of god.

The other disciples therefore said unto him, We have seen the Lord. But he said unto them, Except I shall see in his hands the print of the nails, and put my finger into the print of the nails, and thrust my hand into his side, I will not believe. And after eight days again his disciples were within, and Thomas with them: then came Jesus, the doors being shut, and stood in the midst, and said, Peace be unto you. Then saith he to Thomas, Reach hither thy finger, and behold my hands; and reach hither thy hand, and thrust it into my side: and be not faithless, but believing. And Thomas answered and said unto him, My Lord and my God. Jesus saith unto him, Thomas, because thou hast seen me, thou hast believed: blessed are they that have not seen, and yet have believed. And many other signs truly did Jesus in the presence of his disciples, which are not written in this book: But these are written, that ye might believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God; and that believing ye might have life through his name.<br>  <br>  It takes FAITH in CHRIST...|`|uqMK3rUZaa	People who have had life-changing experiences can attest that there's a God.

In order to do that you would need to have knowledge of everything that ever existed, exists now, or will ever exist. In order to do that you would have to be Immortal, Omniscient and Omnipresent.

It isn't fair to put someone down for being a certain color or for a certain orientation because that is something we can't and never will be able to control, unless if your Michael Jackson..lol. But seriously, they both hear a fair amount of discrimination, but it is due to the rest of us and ourselves to stand up and not be indifferent, because the hate hurts the person but the indifference is what kills.

Meaning you already had your answer.  Meaning you weren't even looking for other viewpoints.<br>  <br>  And you say Christians are demeaning.<br>  <br>  But, to answer your question.   <br>  <br>  C.S. Lewis says it much more eloquently, but, in essence, he says that evil cannot exist without good ... not the other way around.  That "good" is the norm and that all evil is "spoiled goodness".<br>  <br>  In other words, there is no "bad for the sake of badness".  It just doesn't make sense.   Even you say in your question "no reason to do the right thing".  This means there * is * a right thing.<br>  <br>  Therefore, the default is good.<br>  <br>  You see, Christians believe that * all * people are a product of God and, therefore, were imprinted with a moral code; knowing what is "good"  We believe you know right from wrong because, even though you chose not to believe in Him, we believe you * were * created in God's image.<br>  <br>  We all fail to live up to a perfect moral code.  Some to varying degrees, but all fail to follow it perfectly.<br>  <br>  Hence, the whole sacrificial death of Christ, which, judging from the tone of your question,  I am sure does not interest you.<br>  <br>  |`|BZnWmkofaa	WRONG. <br>  <br>  Humans have consciences, and human societies have rules of conduct, known as laws and/or morals, and they all include consequences of for bad behavior.<br>  <br>  It takes a retard to ASSume that the ONLY source for morals is religion.<br>  <br>  In fact, the morals in the bible, if one lived to them now, would swiftly get one arrested for a large list of crimes, from slavery to sex slavery, to murder, to child abuse and neglect.<br>  <br>  Good morals AVOID biblical "values".|`|KclUlBw1aa	Indeed, I agree.

This began to make me think harder about the entire situation.<br>  <br>  Many atheists do volunteer work out of the goodness of their heart.  They are generally concerned about the welfare of their fellow man and work hard to improve the lives of others.<br>  <br>  Christians on the other hand do volunteer work and other deeds because they are afraid of not entering heaven.  Everything they do is based on what they perceive their God wants them to do and not because they feel like it is something that will benefit humanity.  If God wrote in the Bible that Christians should not help their fellow man then they would not but Atheists would consider to have their concern for others around them.  This is the only life you get.|`|cphnVqDnaa	Thats actually a very ignorant question<br>  <br>  Can you be the one to question the ethics of Atheists as a whole?<br>  There are people who do hold a God accountable and are selfish, ignorant, vindictive and vile.

Even if god doesn't exist, shouldn't we trust our own judgment to know that killing people is bad? And also that being "selfish, ignorant, vindictive and vile to your neighbours" is inherently wrong, destructive, behaviour? Relying on a judgmental god-like figure that is there to keep us in check only ultimately undermines our own autonomy and inherent morality.|`|95aab23a65e805646991900347616f66aa	nope I do the right thing because I have logic, and empathy.  I don't steal, murder, or assault others because that's not the way I would want to be treated.  I don't act like a civilized human being because I am afraid of the consequences if I don't.  I don't act civilized because I think there is a reward at the end.  I act civilized because it is the right thing to do.  No matter if my imaginary daddy says so or not.  That is the difference between Atheists and Christians.  You act good because you fear retribution or a want a reward.  Atheists act good, because we are rational and compassionate, (without being terrorized or bribed).

Believing He exists does not mean you are necessarily religious. <br>  Now, there are many up standing folks who do not believe in God, but they are an asset to society. <br>  I do pray that the aforementioned folks end up believing in God and His Son though, because they are lovely people and I would like to see them in heaven.|`|b0iJeOYxaa	First of all, this is one of the retarded threads where the questioner will simply pick the one that he or she agrees with. So with that in mind...<br>  <br>  There are somethings called societal laws, and you should be aware of this if you ever received a decent education. There is something called the second treatise of government by Thomas Paine And yes, when we stop living in nature and exist under the wings of a government, there are some rights we give up, one of them being to receive punishment reflective of our crimes as decided by the processes of the standing government.<br>  <br>  This is the worst argument ever heard? If there was no god... why don't you kill yourself?|`|f7vl7qtJaa	No. Morality is not created by some artificial religion. It can be, but is not limited to, religion. Morality comes out of a sense of community, among other things. Confucius created the original "Golden Rule" (although there have been many other versions throughout history). The idea comes out of the simple sense of doing what is "right," not what is "good."|`|McpKxnYaaa	Just because someone doesn't believe in God doesn't mean they are a sociopath.  They still have a conscience and feelings and can empathize with others making them want to do good in the world.  It seems to me, it's the religious fundamentalists who cause the most evil.|`|UobIgOEZaa	I'm not an atheist, but even if there was no God, there would still be reasons to do right rather than wrong.

Thus, hitler was quite right in exterminating 6 million Jews, because by evolutionary standards, the very fact he could do so proved his superiority.   <br>  <br>  <br>  That's what atheism is at grass roots level.  <br>  <br>  <br>  That's how twisted we become when we throw away the God who created us and gave us absolutes.<br>  <br>  <br>  Think about it.  U cannot escape absolutes.  Either u have to say ''There are absolutes'' ( which is an absolute).  or 'there are no absolutes' (which is an absolute too).  One either believes in total relativism (under which anything is morally acceptable)  or under the auspacies of absolutes.|`|DVSTOJEJaa	before there were religions people still had morals dumb *** and this makes a perfect point any atheist who doesn't believe in god and still does the right thing deserves to go to heaven more than and christian or religious follower they are being moral because they want to end up better off or they are afraid not from there own true desire|`|WhkidlCgaa	this whole thing just totally blows my mind.

5a2969878efc1ea28cb5f1d0e5c13b07aa	Dolphins are also pretty smart, they have their own language and are great problem solvers. Since we evolved into a highly intelligent species, not necasarily because we are the only species capable of high intelligence, other species must also be able to achieve our level of intelligence, if mutation and natural selection drives a species in that direction. We are most definetely not the only species capable of high intelligence, there's nothing special about us. |`|AW9aU9kXaa	Not really. Keep in mind, we evolved from single celled organisms into primates. Every single thing you see living on Earth evolved from single celled organisms. They can't leap from single celled to intelligent, though. As you know, everything evolves through stages. An amoeba can't leap-frog to a human! It has steps it has to go through.<br>  <br>  "Evolved" simply means "changed". It does not mean it gets any more, or less intelligent. It simply means a genetic change. All animals have evolved in some way. Even monkeys are starting to show signs of social tendencies.... they're evolving. They're showing signs of intelligence.|`|yS9HrA2Kaa	No other species has got to our level yet. Neither will it happen in our lifetime. But dolphins in the other hand are VERY intelligent.|`|50ddd9b85c305c8aaa5dec5551648992aa	Your question assumes that evolution is a fact.  There is no proof that anything ever evolved.|`|hoUiq5Cbaa	i dont think any species have evolved to be highly intelligent.. look at half the people that post in Religion and Spirituality!|`|PlxknZV4aa	Probably the latter. Although the opposable thumbs probably helped immensely. |`|VR9Yjvt8aa	The latter, definitely, although having the potential to evolve into more intelligent forms certainly exists in many species. It's a question of brain size and frontal lobe capacity. Dolphins anyone?|`|D8SpQAgLaa	Primates are the only group of animals that walk upright. Walking upright means that the hands are available for using tools and eventually building civilization. Primates can be observed learning to use twigs to pull ants out of an ant nest. The idea of using tools goes back tens of millions of years. Homo Erectus may have advanced tools for example by using rocks to crush nuts, and using logs as weapons. The smarter they got, the more tools they invented. And the more tools they were using, the faster they evolved more intelligence. Next thing you know fire, and wearing animal skins.. and you know how it goes from there.<br>  <br>  This factor just doesn't apply in most other species. For example a cougar is smart enough to know how to stalk its prey and so smart it doesn't ever make any mistakes. So there is no need for it to evolve any more intelligence.<br>  <br>  Apes have hands that function pretty much the same as human hands and walk upright. Even millions of years ago it would have been possible to foresee that they would eventually evolve into an even more intelligent species.|`|H8WqMK1eaa	I could have sworn that whales, dolphins, and porpoises were highly intelligent...they just don't speak "human."<br>  <br>  EDIT: Oh, and parrots.|`|35b5cce42b18603478e2fb3370a123d2aa	sure the intelligence to make bombs, landmines, rockets and nukes.  highly evolved animals, we are.|`|QDFj9JPfaa	...I think the Orca's and Dolphins might have something to say about "Primate" intelligence|`|KclUlBw1aa	We have less physical defense, so we needed the intelligence to compensate. Dolphins are highly intelligent, though not as intelligent as man, but that's because they're more able to defend themselves, either through flight or retaliation (ever seen a bottle nose kill a shark?)<br>  <br>  Other primates are also highly intelligent (as compared to the rest of the animal kingdom), but not so much as man. They are also better suited to "fight or flight" than we are, physically.

I'm not sure why this question is in this category, but for what its worth, the answer is no. Dolphins have already shown a remarkably high level of intelligence.|`|EjCaTfq0aa	No. Some biologist think that cuddle fish could evolve a human like intelligence in a few million years.

It's the cause of a great deal of consternation between Catholics and Protestants, in fact.<br>  <br>  Jesus is calling Simon "Rock" and then saying that he will build his church on this Rock. To Catholics, this means Jesus was giving Peter leadership of the church after Jesus' death. That makes Peter the first pope.<br>  <br>  Protestants give some kind of explanation that makes no sense. Jesus is calling Simon something he was never called before -- "Rock" -- but then they claim Jesus is referring to HIMSELF when he says he will build his church on "this rock." Now ask yourself: Why would Jesus rename Simon just to say he was building the church on himself? There would have been no need for the metaphor in the first place. It's like going up to someone and saying, "From now on, I'm going to call you 'Happy.' And I'm so happy that I'm going to buy you dinner." It doesn't make any sense.<br>  <br>  And yes, "petros," the Greek word for Peter, means "rock" or "stone." Not "pebble," but "rock." <br>  <br>  If you look at the context, you'll also notice that Jesus called Simon by his given name, Simon Bar-Jona, in the previous sentence. Why change his name in the very next sentence if the "rock" metaphor weren't aimed at Peter? Furthermore, Jesus goes on to give Peter the keys to the kingdom, and Jesus tells him that whatever Peter binds and looses on earth will be bound and loosed in heaven. Strange thing to say to a guy if you're NOT giving him leadership of your church, now, isn't it? <br>  <br>  Keep in mind I don't have a dog in this hunt.

XqfH76PMaa	Here is what I found <br>  <br>  Silent Night" ("Stille Nacht") is a popular Christmas carol. The original lyrics of the song Stille Nacht were written in German by the Austrian priest Father Josef Mohr and the melody was composed by the Austrian headmaster Franz Xaver Gruber. The version of the melody that is generally sung today differs slightly (particularly in the final strain) from Gruber's original. Today, the lyrics and melody are in the public domain.

ZDrXFS2daa	Keep standing up for your brother. If she is put off by your brother then she isn't worth having for a friend. Tell her that he is being intolerant and you can not remain friends with an intolerant person. If she doesn't understand that, then she is not much of a friend.|`|AA10032971	You've said your say. Now give her some space. You will know if the two of you can be friends or not. Everyone needs some time to come to 'grips' with their feelings. You can't throw your mindset toward another individual and expect immediate acceptance. What shall we then say to these things? If GOD be for us, WHO can be against us? - Romans 8:31 The Lord daily loadeth us with BENEFITS, even the GOD of our salvation.

If you love her as a friend... talk to her about it and how much it bothers you .. if she doesn't stop offending you then let her know and cut it off if you need to.. sometimes when one person changes there views about a friend because of something they didn't even do.. then its time to cut the rope...<br>  <br>  that must hurt.. but your brother would feel proud you stuck up for him .. <br>  <br>  good luck|`|n7P4B10Haa	I think you should beat her with the pointed end of a stake, honestly.

XxIR4jwWaa	Those pictures are of course real.  Iran is a beautiful country, and the Persian civilization is one of the oldest in the world.  Persian people are very proud of their history and their country.  Their food is excellent, if you've never tried it.  <br>  <br>  By the way, did you know that Persians are not Arabs?  It's a common mistake in the west, and a Persian would get very offended if you called him Arab.  Their language, Farsi, is most closely related to French.  They were not Muslim until the Arabs invaded their country and forced them to convert and use the Arabic alphabet so they could read the Q'uaran.  <br>  <br>  Iranians are wonderful people.  Their country is portrayed very poorly by our media.  But I think it's a matter of our governments fighting - the people for the most part have nothing against Americans.  The largest diaspora of Iranians is living in L.A.|`|Ra4q8880aa	I cannot say they are fake.  I don't have the facts, I've never been to Iran. They seem very nice with very beautiful scenery. What the media shows us is so that we have a mentality of destruction and poverty. But if Iran takes these pictures and shows them as tourism advertising, they would have an increasing tourist industry.|`|UTql7vKkaa	Why would they be fake?<br>  <br>  These pictures don't prove that there are less poor in Iran than in the US, they just show Iran has some good scenery, which pretty much every country has.|`|XqfH76PMaa	I believe that they are real. |`|x0azJZYvaa	Iran, like many other middle-eastern countries, is really not the way you imagine it from just watching the news.<br>  It's funny you're surprised that there is nice scenery there, but guess you'll also be surprised to know that there are many many modern people there who dress a lot like you, go to football games, enjoy life, and don't live in poverty.  Many people there today, especially young ones, have a big problem with the oppressive government they have, so not all films make it there, and girls are still forced to cover their heads etc., but there is still enough modernism there.|`|VWAl3tcnaa	With today's technology pictures do not tell the real true story, but certainly any one can come up with pictures of any kind in any country in the world.|`|UrAb8dNRaa	the government controls the media who control the world.
AyEkA6Flaa	I'd say certainly yes, Alexander was gay.<br>  <br>  Not only was Hephaestion his second in command, but Alexander was more devoted to his beloved friend than to any other human being.  He told the queen of Egypt, speaking of Hephaestion, "He also is Alexander."  Together in a solemn ceremony after they conquered Troy, Alexander and Hephaestion together ran naked around the tombs of ancient gay lovers Achilles and Patroclus: evidently a public demonstration that their relationship was of a similar kind.<br>  <br>  Hephaestion was known to have made comments to the effect that he stayed in Alexander's tent at night, and the two always read letters together.  Alexander's old teacher Diogenes wrote Alexander a letter and in a biting comment urged him not to be ruled by Hephaestion's thighs.<br>  <br>  Although Alexander entered into a political marriage with a woman, he also openly had a sexual affair with a Persian eunuch named Bagoas while Hephaestion was off helping rule other parts of the empire.<br>  <br>  Alexander clung to Hephaestion's body for a whole day and night when Hephaestion died of typhoid, and had to be dragged away.  He was absolutely inconsolable, shaved his head,  and made the richest funeral pyre imaginable for him -- it was a much more impressive funeral than he had given his own father, Philip.<br>  <br>  As he was consumed in grief after his friend's death and died months later still heartbroken, I'd say they were more than just friends.  In the tradition of the Dorian kings, It seems certain they were lovers as well.|`|fB0gmEioaa	Was Alexander The Great gay?<br>  The movie sure painted him that way.<br>  <br>  There's no proof to say if he was or wasn't. I wouldn't trust any movie that was made by Oliver Stone. He is a liar and a revisionist.|`|UhExSL3gaa	There is a lot of evidence pointing that way, yes. I suppose with it being so long ago, it's not really possible to tell, but I think he was.|`|p2pqH3m3aa	I don't put much credence in Hollywood movies, but from historical accounts I've read; it seems he liked young boys !|`|ZPkYSkNVaa	Yes he was, and if that's you, im Alexander and i want to s*c* you Bob!!|`|AA10949601	sure|`|0b8522019203b6bb4a40d4d02c80d76aaa	Yes - 2,300 years ago men in Greece had wives, mistresses, and lovers of either gender. Alexander's father, Philip of Macedon, had male lovers and also many wives, a problem when half-brothers would fight to the death over the throne. Alexander refused to marry and beget an heir when he left Macedon to conquer the world.<br>  Alexander loved his boyhood friend, Hephaestion. Both brilliant boys, they were tutored by Aristotle, with whom Hephaestion kept up a lifelong correspondence. Alexander and Hephaestion felt like the two heroes Achilles and Patroclus, from The Iliad, which was Alexander's favorite book.|`|bS4T0oxhaa	Supposedly, but rumor has it that he was very great at it so he over compensated and conquered 'til he just couldn't conquer any more.|`|xhr2juWGaa	Supposedly he was.<br>  <br>  We'll never know for sure since none of us were around back then.

I had a check of the traditional decks and a few more in my collection with keywords or titles on them and I can't find a conception card, many tarot decks don't have keywords on them anyway. The only one that comes to mind is the Oracle Tarot. If you can remember the art work or anything else about them you can look on www.aeclectic.net. Even if you can't find the old deck you had there are loads of amazing new ones to choose from. The only important thing when you're reading tarot is to choose something that you like the look of and go from there. The meaning of conception would be in one of the aces or maybe the empress or even one of the queens, depending on the art and philosophy of the deck. If you need any more help choosing a deck let me know.<br>  |`|vMFKIc4Jaa	Yes, i know that they're fake. :)|`|UyDkYaXuaa	I don't know.

Men who are great in one aspect of their lives may well be pretty petty in others.  <br>  <br>  "Best" implies a common standard of values, and we do not have that.  For example, since I am a member of the Ethical Culture movement, I might choose Felix Adler, the founder, just because the modern Ethical Society is important to me.  But I know almost nothing about his private life.  <br>  <br>  I greatly admire Barack Obama, but it is in the nature of politicians to have to compromise, to say things not so much from the heart but from what people want or need to hear, and so on.

The church is a complete joke.  If you want to believe in God, at least have the brains to realize that your priest isn't God, he's just some guy.  Does God walk into your church every Sunday in person and tell you that whatever this man says is His word?  No.  So why do Christians think it is?|`|iRKOJhYeaa	Yes, that was very interesting. But what you must understand, is that yes, most atheists do hate what people do in the name of religion, and think that the church is full of hypocracy and hate and intollerance, but that is NOT why we are atheists. We are atheists because we simply do not believe that god exists.|`|hmU2udmRaa	oh i get, so he's saying all the other forms of christianity are wrong and his is right... sounds so denominational.  he's not saying anything new.  every christian wants to believe, just as this guy believes, that they have it right.  the thing is nobody knows.  it's pointless to even speculate.  the most we can do is live a good life, and if there is a god, he can judge us by our actions.  |`|GVcO1dtnaa	Sorry but this video= Epic Fail but it does have some good points about organized religion.|`|k3LbhASGaa	Amen and thank you I agree .And you have given me a lot to think about|`|AA10293793	i tried to listen, i ignored the misconceptions about atheists, i agreed with the bit about organized religion being full of hot air, but when he started with his schizophrenic diatribe about how he's such great friends with god, i had to stop. sorry. sounds to me like he needs to go on some meds.|`|F5lCFvqeaa	It looks like deception is not frowned upon by your denomination and/or set of beliefs.|`|d5obcLdqaa	Wow.

4045eeb32c4ef2d7acd08239fb1eff37aa	It was one of those glorious summer days at the beach like you see in a magazine advertising Florida.  The beach was full of people escaping their everyday lives, and like them my family had come to the beach as well.  My Father, older brother, and my little sister and I had ventured out early that morning to enjoy the day.  My brother and I had been playing out on the shore when out in the distance we saw a peice of driftwood bobbing up and down in the waves.  As soon as he saw it he dared me to swim out there and get it.  I was scared.  However I was always trying to prove myself as a brave kid so I started out towards the wood.  The undertow got me quickly though, and I was swallowed by the ocean like a little minnow.  As fast as he could my brother tried to come to my aide.  He was frantically calling for help.  I could see the fear in his face as he realized he to was going under and out further.  We both clung to each other hoping and praying someone would get to us soon.  On the shore I could see my dad and others running towards us.  They were forming a chain to get to us and pull us out.  Then it was complete darkness.  Hours later I woke up in the hospital next my brother.  We were both safe now, and had a new respect for the power of the ocean.<br>  <br>  <br>  I just wrote this out in like 5 minutes...so it may be a little weak, but just wanted to give it a go.|`|V8O0wffNaa	Hi, Let me try to translate your story, but before we do that I need you to watch ot for run-on sentences!!!

My padre, mi hermano mayor, mi hermana menor, y yo fuímos ala playa.  Despúes de haber empezado a nadar, mi hermano me ordenó a traer un trozo de madera que estaba flotando en la superficie del agua.  Mientras trataba de alcanzarlo me di cuenta que una corriente marina fuerte jalaba de mis pies y perdi el control.  Mi hermano trato de darme una mano, pero el también estaba atontado por las holas grandes del mar.  Mi padre consiguió ayuda y trataron de rescatarnos arduamente.  Despúes de que sucedio el incidente sólo recuedo que desperté en el hospital horas mas tarde.<br>  <br>  That was fun LOL...hey another hint!!! when you use THE PAST TENSE in Spanish in many cases you need use the "acentos."  Example:  Mi padre consiguió ayuda y trataron de rescatarnos arduamente.  Consiguió <<<< to get. <br>  I also added some extra words to your story.  If you have any questions just e-mal I will be glad to help you.  Get a dictionary in Spanish "everthing in Spanish" you will see how you learn faster like that.

It isn't appropriate in school and parents can get schools in a lot of trouble for allowing things like that. It can be offensive to people who are certain religions, and it may not bother most, but the fact remains, it is about sexuality and it is good to express yourself but just like a  dress code at a job, you have to follow the rules at school. Announcing that is a contravorsy and there shouldn't be that in school, it should be learning, not fighting for rights to announce your sexual preference. You friend was wrong and pushing the envelope and then further argued with an authority figure, who may I say, was only enforcing school policy. Enforcing it because if they don't , often times situations can be turned and blamed on the teacher, as you are. You friend was out of line to yell at the teacher and got what he/she deserved for being disrespectful. Tell her to express her sexuality on her clothing, after school hrs or on the weekend, but at school, it is not about gay, bi, sex and advertising it. Mind you, I am open minded and have no issues with gay, etc. I have many friends who are and love them all the same. |`|JpjSGtCnaa	Maybe it wasn't about being prejudice, does your school have a dress code? You should make sure that's what going on first, and if you have reason to believe that it is then you discuss it with the principle and if you don't get a response back then your parents should take it to the school board at the next meeting. I'm not against you wearing what ever you choose outside of school but I do think that in school certain things can cause distractions, and cause problems where there shouldn't be any. I don't care who you are gay, black, white, what ever the case may be, you are all students there to get higher learning and that's what should be the focus, if you have a forum used in your school for debating the issues or standing up for what you believe in, good join , let that be the place where you voice your pride in ??? just leave it out side of classroom.|`|xa4MPajPaa	all bi's, homesexual you etc should create a group.

Like "are u crazy motherf*cker?!" what a freaking sh*thead!|`|xhr2juWGaa	Just report her to the principal, superintendent, school board, or whoever else you'd like.<br>  <br>  There is not much else you could do.|`|KFNu5Wgqaa	You should inform it to the faculty.<br>  If that doesn't work out then maybe you could get a bunch of people (try to get ALOT) to wear "Bi or Gay Pride" to school one day!|`|dcFIq7AKaa	wtf.<br>  that is homophobic. i have gay friends and i like gay people, there's nothing wrong w/ them|`|iJZzGms2aa	uh|`|E2ucOVoTaa	well, first off you need to very carefully read the school's dress and conduct codes to make sure that there wasn't a legitimate excuse for the girl to be writ up (like pants can't have words or something like that). if there is such a legitimate reason you should start showing gay/bisexual pride in the same exact ways that other pride items are shown. write it on notebooks, wear shirts with it. if you can show the administration an example where somebody is written up for showing gay pride, while another person is not for showing asian pride in the exact same way you can get the teacher in some trouble.<br>  <br>  good luck, but if the administration agrees with the teacher you're pretty much screwed. schools can decide what they consider disruptive and inappropriate. if the administration does that you would need a lawyer and that is really much more trouble than its worth.  just waitting till college may be the only real option.|`|VZQSLeYraa	something similar happened at my school.<br>  <br>  a Christian girl was trying to express her belief that being gay is immoral. and the school censored her. she sued, and won. if you care this much, you can sue.<br>  <br>  your "rules" for this answer is just as closed minded- if people think that being gay is immoral, who are you to suppress their freedom of expression?|`|53210b74552a5391b492ae0909442213aa	wow...dats kinda deep...i believe u should b who u want nd wat u want...as long as ur not disrespecting any one else...that teacher was kind of wrong for doing sumthin like dat...if it was really a problem she shoulda just got in contact with the student parents...mayb a meetin or sumthin for da skoo should b held bout wat is acceptable or unacceptable wen it comes to situations of that nature.|`|9yGx00DXaa	look u cant change people and i think ur friend has a lot of courage and being gay my self i now the judgment of Society and i think she shouldnt have to change her style
sOZajizVaa	No there is not, i rung up and asked just now, because im going too. There are fireworks at sefton or walton park tonight.|`|9roHz7ZTaa	Yeah, tonight.
PSzzjf4naa	 They were part of the Puritain revolution in England . So , yes , they were revolutionaries . But their movement had weakened , and the Puritains were being persecuted , and fled England to escape jail and poverty . These humorless religeous wack jobs were the founders of the USA . |`|xhr2juWGaa	Some to practice a more pure form of their religion freely.<br>  <br>  Some wanted land.<br>  <br>  Some had other reasons.|`|uLHCY6Qmaa	Well, you see, they were tossed out of England for being gay... you know the rest of the story!|`|mxZUt1iMaa	Wrong section....|`|LQQAQDkIaa	Because they didn't like the church of England. They thought it was too catholic. So they loaded up on a ship and came over here and began to steal Indian land by the millions of acres. Some of the finest families in America got rich and respected by their peers and they did it by taking our ancestors birthright. It didn't have anything to do with gay marriage.
ccEWxExfaa	LOL----yes,but we all want attention but some seek it in the wrong manner,guys and girls alike. What's kinky to you may not be kinky to the next person.|`|AA12366605	If you can ask if there are then yes their are girls like that |`|ueqLHjheaa	Um wrong section for this question to be asked by a boy.....so my answer for here to you....is No.|`|N028dv7Zaa	duh|`|W8iDn9hhaa	are there girls who aren't like this? is a better question. they're obv not enough like that for u, apparently<br>  <3|`|p9GuYvKFaa	There is every kinda girl you can imagine|`|OWdXxcogaa	Durr. e.e|`|qwEEQHjfaa	obviously their are|`|XFHleRhWaa	Of course! |`|AuRUZII9aa	well of course.|`|e9rQF7xfaa	yes |`|uAtordR4aa	You bet ya!!!

A couple of the episodes are absolutely hilarious. I'd recommend it. Some of your straight male friends might be a little weirded out with it though, or just not get the jokes. Most straight people probably don't know a lot of the gay culture references.|`|HWiXlkf9aa	No but I've heard of the Rick and Bubba show :)|`|l0yP4xIvaa	Nope have you heard of Ricky and Bobby??|`|xhr2juWGaa	Nope.|`|0bVgdyIKaa	The happiest gay couple in all the world?

My grandma made fruitcake that way.|`|MVY8xhXlaa	yessss- but better with alcohol espeically when snowboarding or skiing |`|CJvHQl5vaa	I love eggnog, but it sure doesn't love me back!  I am allergic to soy and dairy, so there is no good eggnog for me! I have a small glass once a year and really savor it!|`|1ZMvqVc5aa	i love eggnog too.<br>  <br>  Every year my grandma makes it around the holidays and she makes the best eggnog i have every had......<br>  <br>  it's amazing........|`|zDrZCr7zaa	OMG YES EGGNOG IS THE $H!T.<br>  <br>  <br>  answer minw <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20081114082638AAFCu2n">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a>|`|wSKLLtryaa	i love it. my bf hates it |`|bfbda678511dcb8c945edebb6d3b20b9aa	yes yes yes!|`|Sk3EFEvNaa	Yummy =]|`|wsLngQ8oaa	I like it but I have to mix it with milk, otherwise it makes me sick|`|zsH4wI0Raa	I LOVE IT 2 =D|`|2DlC4lTAaa	NO I DONT LIKE EGGNOG I THINK THEY NASTYT AND EGGY|`|039TOVhOaa	yessssssss!!!!!!|`|Sk9yGsCfaa	me too, i love how its creamy!
qsuYKa3naa	Many now do in my area, Meijer and Kmart for positive. The malls and specialty stores as a rule are closed. We have one Mall that will be opening at midnight Thanksgiving night. *sheeesh*|`|a1c85fb2fa8cb46f89a4425fb3921555aa	I doubt it, but even if they are....why would you go? Would YOU want to be working on a holiday?? I don't go to any business on any holiday for the plain and simple reason I wouldn't want to work..so i don't make others work...my own little protest...|`|QLthbgULaa	The mall I work at is NOT open...thank goodness!<br>  <br>  How much would it suck to have to go to work at a lousy paying retail job on Thanksgiving when you're supposed to be spending time with family and eating good food?<br>  <br>  Just go on Black Friday with the crazies...so much fun.|`|XqfH76PMaa	Most of them do not.  Some stores (like Kmart) will open until 6 or 8 but most will be closed.  I would contact the mall and ask them to make sure though.|`|EtVjEoyBaa	 on thanksgiving day they close early where i live they open at 9:00am and close at 5:00pm on this day. the mall|`|WUOxEUtUaa	some have pre-BF sales.
