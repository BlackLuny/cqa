4owr19vCaa	You can use "canned air" aka "duster gas" in place of 134A, all forms of duster air has very similiar properties and perfectly safe for use in Japanese / Taiwan brands of GBBs.    I use AI's "duster adapter" for my TM M9 with a drop of lube every other mag fill since 134a is closely related to duster air in terms of power at a given temperature. HFC134a / duster gas has lower power at the same temperature as HFC22 / green gas / propane does so they recommend 134a in Japanese brands like TM. HFC22/green is the manufacturer recommend product for Taiwanese (and most other GBBs made outside Japan).    Weather or not you want to substitute HFC22 / green gas / propane + lube in your TM would largely depend on the temperature, it is acceptable to use it in colder weather (say, 40C or lower) since hfc22/gg will give more power, however once you get indoors or warmer outdoor weather it would be better to go back to the lower power hfc134a or else it may damage your TM pistol!    I personally use Dust-Off brand (available at my local CostCo) it is difluoroethane based and works great indoors / summer, I use it in my Marui Biohazard M92F, easily my favorite pistol (largely because I am a big RE fan :) - Don't forget to put in a drop of lube every 2 or 3 mag fills, it keeps the seals from drying out.      cheers|`|xMSESsGQaa	Wait so what would you use instead of green gas?|`|BpY2ed0Gaa	No. TM, like all Japanese manufacturers are strictly limited by the Japanese 1J max power level. They deliberately design their guns to break if too powerful gas is used.    Using anything more powerful than 134a is likely to break the gun, green/propane definitely will.
4ad21c8bd9ed4a91c2d622b918f0138daa	Yes he is going to return to the wwe sometime between No Way out and wrestlemania. In Bleacherreports Dixie Carter herself has said that he was the first big name from the wwe to jump to tna and it's interesting because he's the first one to jump back to the wwe. It was too obvious at the rumble because people chanted we want christian and holding christian signs. Don't worry he's returning soon people were like this when Jericho was going to return. I think wwe is planning for him to go face at first by teaming with jeff against edge and matt but he will turn heel like Jericho as the months go by.

He Never Complains about ANYTHING , which for what he Puts up with is Outstanding.  And he's a Genuinely Great , Nice Guy.      CM Punk - The StraightEdge Lifestyle that he Follows.  He Refuse to be a Conformist , & Doesn't Care what Other People Think.  His Work Ethic is Top Notch as Well.  He's also got a Great , Work Hard / Get Rewarded Well Attitude about him as does Cena.

He is a true legend in wrestling and very dedicated to his family.|`|0NNEJXJPaa	I must say that although many have been very inspiring to me, my hero is none-other than Susumu Yokosuka, the man lives and grew up in Japan (Being schhooled in Japan in Achievment enough) he was a straight A student. He lost everything, his father disowned him for doing what he beleived in and loved. Yokosuka trained for many years and finally reached Nirvana, thatys when he burst onto the scene - inventing The Somersault Powerbomb, which is by far the most difficult mnove in all Wrestling. His Techni9cal skill is virtually unmatched known to attack his opponents seperate body parts (The defenition of Dragon Gate). He's done the hard yard, His skill is undefinable - he is so strong, fast, cool and Technical.    Links on Youtube: Top ten moves of Susumu Yoksuka, Susumu Yoksuka vs Dragon Kid, Susumu Yoksuka vs Masato Yoshino!!!!!!!!    He speaks only Japanese, so you might underestimate his emotion when he fights, i remeber in Japan when after the match, he couldn't help but smile - he had one his first championship.

A lesser man would have given up but Eddie never did. He proved to me than no matter how bad things got if you stay strong and believe in yourself you can always find a way through your problems.

Right now, Arsenal is missing two key players in Rosicky and Fabregas. They are not scoring at all right now, and really need an offensive boost. Arshavin has been proven as a striker who can put the ball in the back of the net, which is exactly what Arsenal needs right now, and is why they signed him.|`|DEcunDd5aa	I was actually really happy that Arshavin got signed with Arsenal.

Ar5VHDiBaa	In bed with Brady's lady|`|ULw1777caa	He will be with the Pats.|`|ubGNtkHQaa	If Brady is on track to start the season then he will get traded shortly before draft day.|`|QtjnmEzoaa	Under the terms of his Franchise tag, the Patriots have the option of matching any deal offered to him and thus keeping him OR receiving 2 first round draft picks from the team that signs him. If no other team offers him a contract, he will have a one year contract with New England. I know Cassel had some great numbers this year, but I don't think a team is going to be willing to give up 2 first round picks for him. Also, I'm not sure I buy the story that Brady's knee is completely on schedule. I think he'll stay in New England.|`|RZIV15e3aa	Back on the bench and playing for the Patriots.|`|tzrLDbHWaa	I really don' t know where he'll be next year.  I'm not convinced he's really a great QB.  I mean, granted, he put up some really impressive numbers this season, but he has a good offense and pretty much took a team that Tom Brady took to the superbowl and was 16-0 in the regular season with, to missing the playoffs.  Call me a naysayer, but I really think anyone could have put up Cassell's numbers in his position, and I really don't see him being another team's solution to the QB position.    Now, its really going to be hard, in my opinion, for Matt Cassel to end up anywhere.  First of all, I don't see any team really wanting to give up 2 first round picks just to sign him, and thats what's going to have to happen if the Patriots let him go, since he has the franchise tag.  If the Patriots want to sign him, I really don't see him worth the 14.65 mil that the franchise tag will offer him.  What's left?    The only real place I see, that would make sense to me, would be Minnesota.  Frerotte started most of the season, he wasn't good, Tavarius Jackson isn't really much better, so Cassel would be an upgrade.  Furthermore, the Vikings are a good team, they made the playoffs, so their draft picks aren't going to be good anyway, so if you're going to risk losing 2 first rounders, a  22 isn't that bad.  There's no other team I see that really needs a QB but doesn't have a high pick and might consider it.  (Well, statwise maybe Pitt, Big Ben had a low rating and a lot of picks, but they wouldnt bench him)    On the other hand, thats even a stretch.  I think he'll end up back in NE, but I also don't see them really wanting to pay up 14+ mil for him.|`|mplvoPGEaa	He will probably stay with the pats they need a good back up qb|`|H1VIZsutaa	He just got franchised by the Patriots. For a team to get him, they have to give up 2 first round draft picks.|`|ZpH2PFF9aa	The Patriots because Tom Brady knee may hurt sometimes and when it hurts they can put Matt Cassel in!|`|DpPCs6fPaa	RaGS sez : I'm thinking New England, but who can say for sure?

He's a good backup, but no backup is worth 2 first rounds. Besides, it's doubtful that Brady will ever be the same after this injury, so they'll definitely want him around to pick up the pieces. The real question is, that since Brady's career is likely over, has he done enough for the hall of fame? (probably)|`|O0b9Kiosaa	Pats|`|ZlaxbI33aa	He will be in New England.

Xar3YgiRaa	100% no.    When ever someone tries to convince me that wrestling is fake i just say let me pick you and throw you and lets see if its fake. Or i tell them that if its fake then go on a 5 foot height, jump and land on your back and tell me that it didn't hurt. Or let me hit you with a chair to the face.     By no means is wrestling fake, its just predetermined. The only thing fake in Pro Wrestling are the Divas Chests and thats it.    So to answer your question. No. I would never let anyone convince me that wrestling is fake...because it isn't.    ***************STARRED***************|`|WlT5Ks3qaa	I was scrolling websites for random WWE videos and I saw someone say that Owens death was fake...  That was so sad it almost made me cry T_T|`|sUmlxkQlaa	For it to be fake, it must first be represented as real.  A fake rolex would only be fake if it were sold as the real thing.  So if it turned out the Arizona Cardinals took a dive the Super Bowl would have been fake as it was presented as a real game.    Wrestling is like a movie.  Fiction is my word for what wrestling is.|`|ngkPO5Woaa	i wrestler in high school it isn't fake|`|jHjC95v2aa	i'd never say it in few words i'd go on about injuries and risks and they usually just let me win|`|777bb5cdb16d0cbf43218a2a8f793dffaa	Wrestling, fake?  *tears drops down cheek*|`|cuSRcd8uaa	it is incredibly fake. the punches don't even hit each other  i admit they are good actors but that's what they are, body builders and actors  the real fighting is in the UFC and WEC|`|SMoZplv4aa	If it's scripted than it's also fake.|`|237c103f8cbc25137bf6fd4b4b4c91a7aa	call it what you want. Fake, scripted...same thing. It is clearly not a competition of any sort. Just because they get hurt doesn't make it any less fake. My cousin is a wrestler in a few different organizations and he gets hurt sometimes but that doesn't make it real. Wrestlers exaggerate their injuries. Such as it is common knowledge that they cut themselves with razor blades to make the cuts on their heads. And they always look sweaty or wet when they come out so when they do bleed it looks worse than it is.|`|NXktxy8jaa	Never. Some of my friends at school always come up to me and say that Wrestling is fake. I tell them that its scripted and they just walk away. I Guess you could say that they are part of the Rest/Haters.    Ive been to many WWE Shows, the injuries, fighting, submissions, and weapons are all real. Just because its scripted it doesnt mean its fake.|`|T13xM9iJaa	No,NEVER  I would never happened why because as we all know pro wrestling is scripted. It makes me angry when someone says wrestling is fake so what I tell them is well let me push you into a steal gate or let me hit you with a chair then tell me how fake wrestling is then so it will NEVER happened.|`|oAjbBLDpaa	No, Because there is an obvious difference between Scripted and Fake.    Anyone that says fake is ignorant.  The matches are pre-determined but the pain is real. Also, the thrill for me in watching is the display of athleticism for 2 men (or women) show to get to that pre-determined outcome.|`|haN9IMbCaa	It is fake dog. Allow me to explain.  It is not real. The matt is soft. The "rivals" are not real. The drama is not real. They are not really hitiing each other. Yeah it is pretty much fake.   . So wrestling is fake.|`|OHBvEYKHaa	yes you tube people conviced me already|`|6E16tR6xaa	Dead honest? If my friend told me that he'd give me 5 dollars if I said the words"wrestling is fake", I would honestly take it. There is a huge diffrence between scripted and fake. But I mean, just saying the words? Easy 5 dollars.|`|ptQ5SkPVaa	No, because I have worked in Indy shows. I have seen guys get hurt. It may be scripted but it's far from fake.    I just manage some being 14 I cannot get into the ring for any reason. It's my fathers golden rule.|`|tACz8JjAaa	its scripted not fake.

That is the opportunity of a lifetime and you should jump at it. Just give it your best and hope that the next time you get a job offer it pays. More than likely it will.|`|F3VjJAdiaa	If I were a wrestler then yes, because it would be in my blood. I'd rather get paid, but once in a while I would do it for free to help the cause.|`|YwgGcERMaa	I am actually thinking of contacting  old school championship wrestling to see if i can be a part of their show on the first. Im willing to get kicked in the head or face pretty hard like vince mcmahon. There was a decent sized crowd there last month so I think it would be fun. btw Lodi  of the  wcw is a regular and chris masters is making his second appearance.|`|hL3eS2zKaa	Of couse I would say yes. Wrestling has always been my dream, I would do anything to wrestle. Even for free. :-). I'd be even more willing to go if it was for charity. :-D
uh2bkRrFaa	Who's "Dereck Jeter?"     That's weird, there's a player for the Yanks with the name "Derek Jeter," I wonder if he knows about this Dereck person you're talking about.|`|fHxpycJSaa	2936|`|KVeenOGAaa	Probably 1 more, a liner off of his temple.|`|eP0KkYR3aa	3500 too 4000 hits|`|SVsVdRixaa	JETER is a great future Hall- Of - Famer.  Nobody knows how many hits he gets but  my guess is from 2900 to 3560 hits.  Or more Who knows|`|ZVSZZ6qHaa	If he can stay healthy I would say between 3300 and 3500|`|TK1O6RLHaa	I know for a fact that there is no Dereck Jeter in MLB. I do know that there is a Derek Jeter. So if your talking about Derek Jeter on the Yankees I think uhh 150. He's getting old...got nothing left in him. I consider him a defence type. He is going to reach 3000 in the course of 2-3 years. Possibly this year. But don't keep your hopes up alright.    He's not even much of a hitter.|`|8cf795959f4bb56d8c730f6fc0d177dfaa	Jeter is getting a little older but I think he has a good three seasons left in him.  He really hasn't had any major problems with injuries in the past and seems fairly healthy.  His production did drop off a little last year down to 179 hits.  However, this is a guy who has been a consistent .350+ hitter his whole career and I don't forsee his production dropping off significantly over the next couple years.  Lets say he averages 150 hits over the next three years (a conservative estimate).  This will give him another 450 hits and enough to put him above 3000 in his career.  I would bet on 3000-3300 hits in his career by the time he is done.

They just want to cause a stir. Yes, I know that is hypocritical because I do it too, but hey if I can help out others its a good feeling.     I would like to add if any one has any more links I would like to see them. I add them to a collection.     Thanks again :)
0Ck3Dsb3aa	I'm pretty much the same measurements as you but i'm shorter and i'm not fast at all but i play center. You definitely sound like a center to me. If you want to improve your jumps stand on the edge of a bench or something with your toes and just go up and down on your toes about 20-30 times a day. not down off the bench just down as if u were standing on the floor but still on the bench. Your feet should be parallel to the floor. This strengthens the muscles in the back lower half of your legs. But all you have to do is box people out. back them up and jump and grab the rebound. you don't have to be fast but it always helps to be agile and be able to change directions fast and get open. Hope i helped.|`|DgEEjpBiaa	Center or forward, if your taller then most kids trying out, go for center.|`|15Zr5voMaa	u should play center

Brock Lesnar? Go back to watching WWE|`|it2UVkF4aa	They were alot of fighters that came extremely close in defeating Fedor. If it wasn't for him cheating, he will have many loses on his record.

Xar3YgiRaa	Female Wrestling Fans from the 90's liked to watch the wrestlers wrestle.    Female Fans from now like to just watch the wrestlers and don't give a crap about them wrestling.

Is there a both answer?|`|777bb5cdb16d0cbf43218a2a8f793dffaa	Which female wrestlers today stand out, comparable to the female wrestlers of the '90s? ...    Victoria (well, not anymore since she recently retired) ... Probably the Glamazon and Mrs.Anvil (Nattie Neidhart) in the WWE ... no others stand out from the WWE in my mind.    From TNA, the only women who don't deserve any props are the Beautiful People, all the other ladies on the KnockOuts Roster deserve to be there, especially Awesome Kong.  It's good to see a monster heel female wrestler.|`|JITTMjasaa	None. Wrestling is lame. Why do you want to see people get hurt?

TaZvxS7Saa	I don't know about the rest, but Kobe and Tiger's kids aren't old enough to be in middle school, much less high school.    In a hypothetical situation, however, I think there could be a atmosphere where many kids want to be their "friends" just to get perks-- such as free game tickets, visiting mansion, attending over the top parties, etc.|`|kGCd8ioRaa	yeah, I think it could be possible - must be tough having a famous celebrity as a parent - athlete, actor/actress or otherwise.|`|99amr13kaa	honestly, i think they treat them the same way anyone would be treated. just because their dad is famous, doesnt make the kid famous. in my opinion they are just regular kids leading regular lives.|`|J6JFiNL8aa	yea i wouldnt really care for the kid just the dad|`|AA11573840	I think the most pressure comes from the dad rather than the peers. Some kids thrive on doing the same sport or trade as their dad, but some like me go on a completely different route. We had a princess at our school with bodyguards but everyone ignored her and didn't really care. Also we had a lot of famous actors kids at my school and they were left alone for the most part.

Minus all that, I loveeeee the Boston Bruins' home jersey, its absolutely gorgeous! the contrasts on that jersey is amazing    My least favorite would be the Oilers one, not because i hate them but i think it's just ugly. & Also the NYR one is kinda out there & a little weird.  Yours?     =) GO FLAMES!|`|5Zrg7sbuaa	Nashvile has that ugly garbage yellow in their jersey. i like the sens neutral (3rd) jersey.|`|GXGh37YSaa	oilers|`|3kgPmAmwaa	You have to go with some of the Original Six choices when determining the best. The classic 'hawk head' on the front of the Blackhawks jerseys make them the best. The red wings also have simple, yet classic unis.    The worst are by far the alternate jerseys for the Nashville Predators. The mustard-yellow is terrible...

LMayULw3aa	From Suns Perspective: No! Amare would feel deeply disrespected.

wvJmLgKxaa	out of all those, the SL-R for sure, one reason is because of the reverse camber.    Reverse camber is having a rocker between your feet and is a whole new experience.     You didn't list any board with reverse camber, except for the sl-r and maybe the scaremaster im not sure    but here are some reverse camber boards that are really good.  Lib-tech skate banana  gnu street series  capita horriscope  burton hero  k2 www w/ rocker  rome artifact 1985  rome notch 1985|`|HkwUGOmxaa	dont worry about the k2 boards. They are one of the best and biggest companies out there for a reason. Boards dont just crack. If they do they can be warrantied. The company has had many boards on top 10 lists and great reviews along with some good woods. The zepplin is awesome...for freeriding all mountain. The burton custom is the number 1 selling snowboard of all time. It has a lot to do with marketing dollars but if it sucked it wouldnt do as good as it does from word of mouth. This is a great board and alot of companies have tried to copy this over the years, the J. Jones is going to be for freestyle so it depends on what you like to ride and where. Never summers are very durable but I think sometimes a little too damp and you cant feel the snow under your feet...and can be a bit heavier than most...except of course in the case of the sl-r. I like ride. I have been riding for 16 years and sold them for 8. I live in colorado and out here Burton is 1 and ride is 2. Try to go to a demo center and ride them....some places will back the price of the rental out of the price of the board when you buy it|`|fxqRJNmYaa	hey man i dont suggest K2 boards idk whats happinin now but my friends have K2's and they just crack after a couple weeks i suggest any Burton and yeah Burton custom is probably the best one there is so i would go with that. Oh and if your also looking for bindings K2 makes way better bindings than they do snowboards I have K2 Indy's and they've worked for 2 years!

This is how a friend of mine is doing it and he's a pretty solid guy.  Going to college (4 years of whatever, I think he's doing youth ministry lol, nothing related to military or whatever), enlisting in Marines (yes enlisting, he wants to be a scout), then doing police. Since he's going to be a scout/sniper he can also do some federal work i.e. protecting the president for the USSS. But after college and 4 years Marines he would be about 26, then 20 years (for retirement purposes) on the police is 46 so he'd have a ton extra from that for earning more and stuff.|`|ZUTfMc8vaa	there is some boot camp bases would let you do that but i am not sure|`|tZXHSxkQaa	CKM is the way to go.Also there is closecombattraining.com.Find a shooting range,they should have instructors there that can train you.|`|fRosDAZEaa	Sorry, you gotta join the military or the police force for such experience.  It's not so much the actual fighting or weapon handling, but the fighting and weapon handling and working as part of a team that sets the experience apart from what you can get outside of of the military or the police force.|`|htH3TGD9aa	well, i know the military teaches all kinds of diffrent martialarts, but try looking into a Martial art, and if you want to know how to shoot join your local shooting range (or whatever you want to call it) but to save time and the energy of doing all that you could just join up the military or the reserve|`|i0EKsGayaa	I suggest commando Krav Maga as it is a highly effective combat system, teaches what you need to learn fast, and over all meant for people such as cops and military personnel and has been proven to be effective. The trick is to find a good school because Krav Maga has a bad case of McDojo's (A school with a unexperienced master that is more interested in taking your money then teaching you the art) If you want to find a good  school you most likely have to go to Israel or some one who has trained in Israel and has combat experience. If you want to learn to shoot then go find a tactical shooting school and make sure the school is legitimate. Good schools are essential to learning. Good luck.

tA5DrAPpaa	If you want to get to the hole on a regular basis, all you have to do is swing the ball until one of the guards at the top of the key slips up and gives one of your wings a chance to drive.    When she drives, the girl you have on the post needs to take a small side step so the defender on the post needs to choose whether she's going to guard the wing driving or the post player.    BTW, a 1-3-1 is something I've never heard of.  It looks like that offense uses like 4 guards and one forward/center, that's my guess.  If you don't have much size, I recommend the Vegas offense.  It's simple and proven to work.|`|Ap0zXXToaa	Penetration straight to the free throw line, then pass the rock out to the soon-to-be-open wingwoman for the three.|`|6Efhd6lNaa	Its a lot tougher to penetrate against a 2-3. That scheme is basically designed to run against younger less talented players who arent good shooters. If you do have any shooters i absolutely recommend using them to your advantage with pick and pops or flare screens. However if youre coaching a highschool team thats probably not the case. I would try stacking up on one side, maybe having three or four players on one side and only one or two on the other. Then you either have a mismatch if the defenders dont come over to help or if they do you likely have an uncovered guy on the weak side.    Hope I helped.|`|ewW1CY3Waa	quick penetration to the middle. Set up with great wing passing, or a motion zone offenece alla The Bearcats!

Yea, the X games are cool and you're in to that.  The ball is worth 10 times as much as any Terry Kennedy anything.  So it would be a bad trade for you if you do it.   Ask ten average people about Terry Kennedy and 2-4 may know who he is. I don't know who he is. Ask the same people who's Magic, they'll all know.

jTaW3goeaa	You need to get a lesson for your first time, even after that you're going to fall a lot while learning.  I learned though a 3 day camp and by the end of the first day I was able to start going down easier hills, so I think if you got a lesson you'd be able to do the same when the lesson is over.  It will take a while to get good though and get to the point where you can connect turns and not fall a lot.  But with practice you can be great, the guys you see in the X Games doing this didn't get those skills overnight, they came from hard work and practice.|`|7otyLHwCaa	if you're going up every week, you will get good fast, I think. Give it 4-5 full days of riding, and keep riding and practicing, and you'll get it down, I'm sure. Also, start out slow (green runs) and work your way up to blue, stay on blues for a while. Get real comfortable with those, get used to speed and carving, then try out a diamond. Good luck

En la final de Italia 90, Alemania vence a Argentina con un penal inventado por el arbitro mejicano Codesal (hasta los alemanes reconocieron con el tiempo que aquel penal fue un invento). En el mundial del 86 Maradona con la mano contra Inglaterra y en el partido Italia - Argentina el arbitro invento un penal para Italia. En el mundial 94 el arbitro italiano invento varias infracciones cuyas ejecuciones llevaron a dos de los 3 goles con los que Rumania elimino a Argentina. Y no hablemos de todos los favores recibidos por Brasil en los ltimos 4 mundiales. En este mundial los rbitros dejaron fuera a Holanda, Tnez y Australia. No me acuerdo muy bien en que mundial fue pero Blgica fue eliminada por el arbitro en un partido contra Alemania. El arbitro de hoy influyo en el resultado porque a los argentinos les cobraba hasta si tenan mal aliento, es muy curioso; en el primer tiempo arbitro bien, pero en el segundo fue un desastre, como si alguien hubiese hablado con el. Pero todo esto es intil, la final sera Brasil - Alemania. Y en el mundial del 2010 pasara lo mismo.

7af1f8e6154f8bf0e1c1d5a55819649eaa	no not really|`|AA11562202	I have always thought rankings are not very useful and it was proved early in this world cup. Ghana(ranked 48) outplayed and beat numbers 2(Czech) and 5(USA). The rankings are partly based on the number of international matches you play and win and you can play many of those but not really with good football teams.|`|AA12298079	Most of people which play football in the world know that game is not play on paper.|`|d275ff0a7ed765c402c685c5a7ca26f8aa	no because the teams that they played before the tourney might stink and also maybe some of their players are hurt or something|`|AA12218378	Not really.I think we all saw that there were some big surprises.So it only depends on how they play now.|`|392fac156ea4e8f5535b3e4633d68736aa	Nope|`|86eb8f7e48b6b3d84b0e42299fd4ee03aa	not realyy, it just puts an impression in ppl's minds so the team r thought of as good or bad|`|2c01d6355094ea5b75f464caed08c1a6aa	No way. Look wut happened to the US. Look at Ghana. They only show who's supposed to be the best.|`|82cf772ad02ee778fd31c0ab73b4299aaa	Usa out, Czech Republic out, Serbia out, Croatia out.  The ranking is crap.|`|AA11577135	No. Idon't think so because that's why is called world cup anybody has a chance is all about how good they play. For example in 2002 France and Argentina were tough to go far and who took it? BRAZIL|`|a679da2e903a1cc502878bc8d21328b6aa	Obviously the world rankings were made up badly... the "number 2" and "number 5" (Czech Rep. and USA) Are both going home, and  48 Ghana and  42 Australia advanced.  Personally, I don't understand how the US got such a high ranking.  I mean, they were  5 ranking! I believe That Brazil, Argentina, England, France, Spain, Germany, Mexico are all better than my country's team and yet we somehow are ranked  5.  Baffling.|`|dac944ebbbda58056e43898ef52226c2aa	No but their attitude does. If their attitude is governed by their ranking then it will cause them problems.    Australia (Go Socceroos) was ranked 42nd in the world (lowest in its group) before the world cup but went into its games against Japan, Croatia and even Brazil and tried to win by playing to score goals.    Contrast this with the arrogant attitude of Italy (Forza Azzurri) against lower ranked teams such as Korea in previous world cups. They lose against them because their attitude is wrong.     I will test my theory in the Italy v Australia game.     BTW I am a Aussie with Italian parents ... a win for me :-)|`|AA11462058	Not at all.

07b080b41caddbe8a69506dd2d05fbd8aa	Pues, soy gran Fan del equipo de Holanda, ellos juegan en Equipo, aunque el de este mundial no fue nada comparado a Equipos de los mundiales anteriores, NUNCA olvidare el juego Holanda-Brasil en Francia 98, creo q ellos merecian llegar a la final, y con respecto al de hoy, En el segundo tiempo no supieron aprovechar que ellos contaban con un jugador de mas, creo q la presion de medios k decian q Holanda solo ha ganado un partdio a Portugal hace a?os los altero y no estudiaron bien su contricante, tambien el arbitraje estuvo mal en el primer tiempo, no puedo creer q la FIFA todavia no haga algo al respecto, pues creo que hubieron muchas faltas en el primer tiempo contra ellos, y ya en el segundo fue mas pleito, incluso ha sido el unico partido hasta ahora con peleas. Pero con todo, creo que holanda merecia al menos empatar, ya en tiempo extra no podria decir, pues estaban con mucha tension.

I heard during the German game the Italians said that German better be scared cause everyone saw how badly they whooped Ukraine...YAA u bet Ukraine...Its not like you bet Brazil or Portugal.    Italia didnt deserve the World Cup. Espically when they went in with the controversey about the refs. Materazzi deserved that headbutt. And a Penalty kick Shoot Out doesnt make you the champion of the world...great players like Zidane, Henry, Ribery, Abidal, Makelele, and Viera do.|`|AA10063321	For a man of ZZ's stature to throw away the World Cup must have taken some pretty dispicable comments from Materrazzi.  The French team is extremely sensitive to racial issues in light of the comments made by the racist LePen.    Surely some kind of inquiry will be conducted by FIFA into the actions leading to the headbutt. ZZ deserves at least that. There were enough cameras on the players and the most basic lipreaders will be able to decipher anyoff color remarks.    FIFA needs to put up or shut up with the whole "Say No to Racism" campaign.|`|d64d86b3563991d3135cc628dfafbcc8aa	You rock dude! You are so 100% right! I so agree with you.

So you can't call this an injustice at all.    There is NO justification for what Zidane did.  None.|`|1a48d26d47457296d901c8a219f00528aa	Look... the 'frogs' lost,  'Zizou' is 'Bye-bye'...

What is that teaching our kids when they were watching it - for my nine year old saw this and asked me why he would do it.  Do you expect me to say 'well, the other guy in the blue shirt said something mean to him'. - so, no it is not injustice at all.   He got what he deserved.  Period.|`|AA10944724	I agree with u! They should treat their sport and everyone in it with respect. To me that is poor sportsmanship! It is taught in pee-wee sports to respect each other and be good winners and good losers!

Can we please look at some evidence before we make unfair accusations against him?? I know he's not the fairest playing person in the tournament but it's unfair to plant accusations on him insulting Zidane when no one knows what happened. Materazzi might have said something bad but Zidane's headbutt was a definite worse violation of the pledge.

9432010a3e2b67082ab13d7fdf82c8bcaa	It was CLEARLY a goal.  I was watching it on American television (which, of course, would be a neutral party in this instance since the commentators weren't supporting either France or Korea) and they replayed it and it was CLEARLY goal.  They kept on talking about how it was unfair and how France got robbed.  I honestly don't care if FIFA didn't catch it at first, but they should have made an announcement that it would count after rewatching it.  It's better to have angry Korean fans than angry French fans because the French deserve to have won since they scored two goals.  FIFA is honestly showing their true colors and obviously, they aren't as neutral as people would think.    It's very unfair and normally, people would let it go, but one stupid referee's decision could cost France its place in the round of 16.    FIFA, you screwed up big time and people really noticed.  Not a smart move AT ALL.|`|AA12298079	Yes it seemed the goal was clear|`|AA11447638	yes.

It is not entirely the referees' fault - they are under FIFA orders  The balance of blame has got to lay with the players. Blatter and Fifa have set all these rules and it has taken some common sense out of the process - it's killing the game to a certain extent.    Players too have to be held to account for the rash of bookings and dismissals. The tournament has been littered with occasions of simulation and bad tackles and it's up to the referees to punish these things. It is what they are there for. They're under so much pressure they must judge everything according to the letter of the law.    You could say if the referees were not active, it could have turned out into a more unfair or dirty tournament. The referees are applying rules consistently and the players have been warned from the beginning; the tournament actually has generally been quite fair so far.|`|1a48d26d47457296d901c8a219f00528aa	Because of their ego's (FIFA's screening process, is useless)... they want to be remembered!|`|d2ef06f41db519be6a59ead58942c215aa	apparently its all the pressure from FIFA this year, I guess the refs were getting a bad rap for being to easy last time around, and now they're just overdoing it. kind of ridiculous.|`|aea3eb864fb657b29c485926f758d1f2aa	Because FIFA was drunk when they made up new rules.|`|8525cd8984cd2051965887dd25ff092eaa	Serious!!  I believe during the wold cup build up the referees were assembled together,during which they discuss with fifa the way to go about officiating matches in the tournament.  From the outcome of previous tournament and controversies that foils, leveled on discipline of players and the way the referee's handle the matter. fifa resolved that it has empowered them to take decisive action on any player found wanting in the conduct of having a fair game.  Even though it was predicted to generate some heat from supporters, i believe they dint predict it to be of this magnitude.

4ef3a192bf8da20c7a899c18aeef72c8aa	If they keep broadcasting poker tournaments they will.  Since when was poker a sport?  ESPN for the most part is okay but sometimes they get too "Hollywood"  Sometimes the broadcasters focus on themselves and not on the world of sports.  As long as ABC owns them, they will be around for a long time.  Personally I liked ESPN when they were just getting started.|`|AA12064626	yeah. we've got another sports channel for baseball so it's like byebye|`|7f6e1fdca347d17247abbcc871cadcb2aa	I always disliked them|`|bb5ea1ac42d4fc685fd5fa039f14fe4caa	Down the drain?  From an existence standpoint, the answer is no - they are a powerful network (in general, not just in sports), so get used to them.  If you thought ESPNDeportes and ESPNU weren't enough, wait til ESPN8 gets released - it'll be overkill then like it is now...    But if you mean down the drain in coverage and pure bombardment, then yes.  Unfortunately, ESPN got away from what made them great - clever hosts, highlights with some analysis.  Now we're constantly inundated with cooler talk, mullet chat, and six-packs of questions that really don't add any insight.      ESPN is getting in it's own way, particularly when it comes to covering "hot" news.  I don't need constant updates of Barroid's chase for a record that nobody wants him to break, or that a deal might go down at the baseball trading deadline that might involve a big name and might involve and small town team.  Give me the news that's fit to print, not what might be happening or useless speculation (which is what most media has become, thanks to the reward of breaking stories first.  Not necessarilty accurate, but before anyone else).    FOX did a smart thing by releasing Final Score - simply highlights.  You might see a migration from some (like myself) to that type of sports show, but ESPN is so ingrained in our sports culture, it will be hard to get people to switch over or stop watching ESPN.

Its a good learning experience. Good job  for u. Doing sports at a young age like you are, you can decide if u like it or not, so in the future, u could maybe play in High School, College n maybe become a pro athlete!    Goodluck and have fun.

AA10408476	Well after last night's performance, I know someone we are not going to boo anytime soon...Beckett was awesome!

AA11246712	1)  Make sure you fully understand any "complimentary" routes employed by your offense in your playbook. Those types of route combinations usually allow you to make a decision based on the initial movements of just one or two defenders.  Knowing what defender is key to the success of these routes will make for quicker reads, especially against aggressive defenses.      2) Understand the blocking scheme employed by your offense as designed by o-coordinator.  If you don't understand the pass protection goals of your offense, you won't know the expectations of your reads against an aggressive D.  If your offense is trying to quick pass over the blitz, then then the O-linemen know they only need to block defenders for 3.5 seconds.  Pre snap reads are key here.  Hit the short routes just as the recievers break.  Some offensese by design don't do this!  Some offenses bait pressure and max protect on purpose.  In these offenses you will need to stand in the pocket and may be expected to take a couple sacks while reading down the field.  Its ok to take a little longer reading the defense.  The O-lineman know they need to block for 4+ seconds.  The trade off here is you will likely be able to hit wrs in single coverage deep down the field.  Figure out what your offensive coordinator is trying to do with his blocking scheme/route combos and execute your reads within his system.|`|f0f5f0fbd4bfae9ccc2f92dfc315c409aa	Always go on like 3 85 percent of the time one of those blitzers will show!|`|4a970485c4c5ae4a3946e03a42fad9beaa	watch for the linebackers showing blitz, idk what position you play but if it is a lineman, than sacrifice your body to stop them to save the rb, cut the crap out of their shins. it will stop them dead in their tracks and they will most likely slow down their blitz a little more, then you can also have your tackles push the d-ends to the outside, so they can get in on the play, and leave the d-t's to the guards, if they are in a 5 man front, then you would also have the center play man up and push him one side to the other, but u better hope that they dont have both ILB's rushin in, if they do then you will have to get a quick hand off, probably through the b or c gap and have them head at around a 45 degree angle, maybe less straight towards the sideline, and then when they get close to the edge they would need to angle up, but make sure the tightend goes for the corner and the flanker for the deep protection, and become the lead blocker and eventually blocking out the saftey.|`|AA10062277	Three simple keys.      1) Watch all the film you can film ahead of time   Every individual defense may set up a little differently.      2) Safeties.  If they are up, they are daring you to pass    3) Linebackers.  If they are down one a three point stance outside of your tackle - chances are he's coming in after you.|`|AA10868035	it all matters wat position u play but u may also want to watch film and pick up tendensies|`|2572a642e1d108f93d999b5c6808b615aa	yeah what he said|`|66f80f6cf9d7e3d90d1521611699e902aa	All defenses have signs to give things away (i.e. positioning before snap, too many people in one place.) But it all depends on the defensive scheme. 4-3 defenses tend to basic and easier to read than the 3-4. The 3-3-5 can be difficult to read. The 4-2-5 / 4-4 is usually simplistic and easy to read also.    Coverage is a good indicator. Cover 0 or 1 free up people to blitz without leaving holes in coverage.    Safety depth. It could be cover 4, or it could be the safety coming up in man freeing up a LB to come or come himself.    D linemen positioning can tell also because of gap resposibility. If their is a big gap, then the gap resposibility could be the LB which could mean blitz.    I could go on and on for days about all the little things that give away things for a D, but then you should just hire me as your coach. Watch the films, watch them live, find things they do to tip things off. And most of all learn defenses as if you were playing it. If you know a defense and what it is set up to do, you can anticipate its moves.
0b893a614efb4ef1584c6a3de77efae5aa	The top 5 running backs in the NFL are:  1) LT - He's the most consistent in both catching and rushing. He gets around 20 TDs a year with 1500 rushing yards with the potential of having 100 catches.    2) LJ - He rushed for an average of 150 yards over the last half of the season. Translated into a whole season, that is 2400 rushing yards. Simply put, LJ is unstoppable.    3) Alexander - Alexander is a TD machine. He is a virtual lock to get in the endzone at least 20 times a year. How many running backs can say that.    4) Portis - Portis has so much potential that it is scary. In his first two years, he ran for over 1500 yards. In his lone bad season, he rushed for "only" 1336 yards. Last year, he rebounded with 1516 yards and 11 TDs. When this guy is on, he is the best RB in the league.    5) Barber - Barber combines rushing the ball with receiving better than anyone in the league. He rushed for 1860 yards with 530 receiving yards and scored 11 TDs. He has put up very solid stats for 4 consecutive seasons. He is very consistent.|`|4a970485c4c5ae4a3946e03a42fad9beaa	1.

Edge, altho he is going to a new team, he will still end up on top,  4. i think you will be able to see reggie bush up here after this year, he is very fast and one of the most agile running backs i have ever seen come out of college.  5. and also tiki barber. he is a very good running back, very underrated, if he stays healthy this year you will see him come out strong and run for 25-30 td's|`|aeae9f9501fa82271978b0e4207d775daa	1.) Shaun Alexander- 2006's MVP. Has great hands, great speed, and great vision. He can pick up the blitz when needed to and can probably get you an instant touchdown. He has the size and ability to pound the rock, but isn't exactly built for that.     2.) Larry Johnson- A young running back with great potential to probably become the best. He has the size, the speed and the vision to become the best and especially behind that Kansas City's o-line. But he has to increase his skills for picking up the blitz.     3.) Tiki Barber- A veteran that works hard and can give you at least 25 to 30 touches a game. He has great speed, great hands and can outrun some safeties. He lacks the size and blitz pickup to.    4.) Julius Jones- A young and great new talent. He has the perfect size to pound the rock and has good hands. He has great vision and good speed when given a lane to run though also. He is OK at picking up the blitz, but that will get better.    5.) Brian Westbrook- Very versatile, great speed, a great receiver out the backfield and has good vision. He just lacks the size and the opportunity to run the ball.|`|AA11095686	1. Shaun Alexander  2. LaDanian Tomlinson  3. Larry Johnson  4. Tiki Barber  5.

Alexander the Great of course he's number one and MVP of 06, you can't question 28 TD's   2. I go with L.T. here because he can do it all and has been for  years now   3. The new Larry Johnson, not the one who played basketball for the Knick and Hornets but "yes" the LJ who will run for 2000+ this upcoming season for the Chiefs   4. Give me Tiki Barber here, he's just a few steps behind LT in the all purpose log.   5. I'm going with the work horse for the Bengals, Rudi (not I'm not from Notre Dame) Johnson for his hard nose style.

Il concetto semplice  che le pene vengono date rispetto all'infrazione commessa. Leggendo le pene, ma bisogna aspettare le motivazioni perch altrimenti il giudizio non pu essere completo, i giudici hanno cos interpretato le interecettazioni:  Meani, giudicata figura marginale del Milan, ha tentato di combinare 1 partita, richiedendo arbitraggi che avrebbero favorito, o quantomeno non sfavorito la sua squadra. Galliani e la societ che rappresenta paga una penalizzazione di -30 nello scorso campionato e -8 nel prossimo per non aver "tenuto a bada" il suo dipendente (la responsibilit oggettiva in soldoni  questa), ma non  vero che abbia partecipato attivamente a questo complotto per combinarsi le partite (responsabilit diretta, che invece  stata riconosciuta alla Juventus). Questo  il motivo perch il milan sta in serie a e la juve no.  Ora 2 precisazioni:   1) Non si  mai sentito che persone come giudici costituzionalisti possano far influenzare il loro giudizio da simpatie politiche (quindi Berlusconi e tutti coloro che dicono che il giudizio dipende dal fatto che lui sia il presidente hanno perso un'ottima occasione per starsi zitti)  2) Il giudizio sportivo infligge le pene rispetto alla gravit dell'infrazione e solo a quella, di conseguenza la scelta dei -30 o dei -44 non pu essere fatta con il preciso scopo di cacciare od ammettere una squadra alle coppe europee, ma solo perch l'ammontare della penalit viene ritenuta congrua. Il partecipare o meno alla champions  una conseguenza e non pu essere un metro di giudizio.  Spero di essere stato chiaro anche se un p lungo, di questo mi scuso, ma vorrei che la gente non sparlasse a proposito: le critiche alle sentenze devono essere fatte con un minimo di logica, senza pensare di diventare esperti di diritto sportivo da un giorno all'altro; c' gente che l'ha studiato e sarebbe almeno indecoroso nei loro confronti ;)|`|0de15416b4e71fb1f6d13eb7d300eeb3aa	perch andare in serie B per una telefonata di 37 secondi,nella quale si chiedeva soltanto un buon arbirtro, effettivamente esagerato.|`|c1f31da143fc1e2bd04bbdae2f2a12f3aa	simone 86 ma perke non ingoi?siete vergognosi e continuate ad esserlo...perke voi non dovreste pagare solo con 8 miseri punti mentre la juve la lazio e la fiorentina molto di piu?siete uno scandalo....vergognatevi...io mi sarei punito da solo  MAI STATI IN B|`|23371a5fdeaa06751b66fcf90e5950ceaa	E' giustizia,aspetta le motivazioni e vedrai che non  altro che il minimo di giustizia...Guardate le risposte di choncachenabba....Niente di pi giusto....Era quello che volevo dire per filo e per segno,ma visto che  lungo da scrivere non mi stava andando....Capite bene prima come stanno veramente le cose senza fare conclusioni frettolose e assolutamente fuori luogo!!!!!!Bravo choncachenabba e anche simone 86!!!!!!!!Sempre Forza MILAN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|0e5abaa57786c723e14aa7ba335834e4aa	perch il milan  il milan, cmq deve anche vincere...

But other's will pay a premium for a star's autograph on his rookie card.  The card probably books for between $2 and $6 unsigned.

Zidane s era realmente desequilibrante, adems de tener una tcnica depurada que utilizaba cuando era necesario. Ronaldinho es brillante con el baln en lo pies pero, excepto en contadas ocasiones, se luce haciendo las autnticas filigranas cuando el marcador es muy favorable o en zonas del campo en las que no corre riesgos. Es un tipo al que le va mucho el lucirse de cara a la galera.  Por otra parte, y en trminos puramente futbolsticos, a Zidane era mucho ms difcil quitarle el baln, y haca los pases ms rpidos y ms precisos. Ronaldinho tiene la mana de marear la perdiz cada vez que el baln cae en sus pies: queda muy vistoso, pero muchas veces ralentiza el juego.|`|16c1b427a5eb6f6507ebb2be56cb7d83aa	ZIDANE|`|d7d17c115d0da530c02449bd25524daaaa	En que?  en jugar al futbol Ronaldinho con 2 a?os le dejaba sentado de culo y eso que Zidane ya tendria unos 30.    en pegar cabezazos cobardes...Zidane el number one  en ocultar y falsificar edad....tambien    en hacer que los ni?os crean que el futbol es para delincuentes  el mejor.

e36c9277d8256b11944386366ce89863aa	A mon avis c'est du au fait qu'il n'y a pas vraiment eu de communication ni de pub sur l'evenement. Ceux qui aiment le rugby et qui jouent le savent tous et ce sont eux qui vont remplir les stades donc bon...    Et puis mme si la France est une des grandes nations rugbalistiques, ce n'est pas une majorit des Francais qui joue ou qui s'y interesse. Deja, l'environnement est super important et quelqu'un qui ne vient pas d'une region du rugby ou d'une famille qui aime le rugby n'aura pas beaucoup de chances de s'y mettre ! Donc normal que les 2/3 ne le sachent pas, s'ils n'ont jamais ete mis en contact avec le monde du rugby (tres ferme il faut le dire, avec ses propres regles et valeurs).    Par contre, ca ne veut pas dire que c'est normal et que ce n'est pas triste !!!     Et pour celui qui dit que les 2/3 sont des femmes, qu'il tourne 7 fois sa langue dans sa bouche avant de dire des conneries pareilles !! Beaucoup de filles s'interessent et/ou jouent au rugby. En France elles reprsentent l'augmentation la plus importante dans la FFR !!

En equipos donde jugaba Jabbar, Jordan, Magic, Barkley, etc, no haba mucho lugar para extranjeros. Hoy hay mas de 150, de paises remotos y con poca tradicion basquetbolistica. Y la a liga nacional le pasa lo mismo, el nivel a bajado considerablemente debido a que los 20 o 25 mejores jugadores, estn todos en Europa.

The following quote is excerpted directly from Wikipedia's page on Zumaya (see source link below) who was clocked by TV speedguns at 104 MPH, although this has not yet been recognized as the "official" record:    "The official record according to the Guiness Book of World Records is 101 MPH by Nolan Ryan in 1974. However, the fastest observed speed (although not official) was a pitch from Mark Wohlers during spring training in 1995, which allegedly clocked in 103 MPH. On July 4, 2006 at McAfee Coliseum in Oakland, California, Zumaya threw a pitch clocked at 103 MPH, thus tying the "unofficial" record held by Wohlers [1]. On July 20, 2006 in a game against the Chicago White Sox, Zumaya threw a fastball that television speedguns recorded at 104 MPH, however it is yet to be seen if this speed will be recognized."|`|d38ab62a316f12cee9d2d8bb20ad29d6aa	I know it is faster than 100.9 because Randy Johnson hit 102 in Arizona's 2001 season, and that was recorded.|`|62d04b8730b9859ed57800098ab76009aa	115|`|AA11829006	The record books show Nolan Ryan of the Angels as having the fast pitch ever recorded @ 100.9 mph.

I used this ability during games to make linemen lose balance when we went head to head.  Its a shame I broke my leg in three places.

Pero es una tonteria compararlos. Se puede comparar jugadores que ocuparon la misma posicion en la cancha, en similares epocas. Pero comparar a maradona con pele, a platini con garcia aspe, al checho batista con beckenbauer y passarella... me parece una perdida de tiempo. Es indudable que Pele, pelota que agarraba la metia en el arco. Es Indudable que los pases de Maradona eran insuperables. Es indudable que Paolo Rossi era mas infranqueable que el muro de Berlin. Y es imposible comparar aquel juego de antes del mundial 94 (para mi la epoca dorada del futbol, desde el 30 al 90, donde el negocio era una porcion minima del juego) con jugadores del 94 hasta hoy. Hay mucho dinero en juego, el deporte se ha hecho una vidriera, en los mundiales solo se ven equipos egoistas y miedosos, que no quieren cometer errores para que no se les frustren los pases millonarios a sus jugadores. Solo analicen esto: El futbol es un deporte de roce. Y estoy seguro que hubo pocos (creeria que ningun) lesionados POR ROCES O GOLPES en estos ultimos mundiales. Todos se lesionan en entrenamientos, o subiendo al micro, o viendo la telenovela. Eso significa que dentro del campo de juego ya no se deja la vida, sino tan solo un poco de sudor, que les aseguro, cada gota tiene precio en euros.    El caso de ronaldinho en este mundial fue lamentable. Hasta lo vi pisar la pelota y caerse. Se le puede atribuir a los nervios, pero me parece que el mayor problema es que tanto a el, como a las jovenes promesas que jugaron el ultimo mundial, no se los dejo jugar con libertad absoluta. En el mundial 86, creeria que no habia estructura tactica mas rigida que la de Bilardo, y sin embargo, la seleccion argentina, con la conduccion de maradona, jugo a lo que quiso. Se sintio libre de cuestionar la estrategia de su tecnico. Quizas la culpa del futbol anodino que hoy nos toca ver tambien sea culpa de los jugadores...|`|2ee2e620c2c30c433bd94fcb32712c83aa	pele|`|17c84f5d140737cec440090cd8f57625aa	Maradona!!!

He is at most every live taped event that is put on by the WWE. In fact, he is normally right behind that curtain you see all the wrestlers come from behind. He is in contact with the ref at all times during a match by way of an unseen transmitor in the refs ear. So, if say, said wrestler gets legitimatly injured, he is there to tell the ref how he should end the match. Also, he is constantly monitoring the crowd reaction to any said wrestler and/or match, and is hands on in the decision making of the outcome. What you see on tv,internet,etc... is a character. But no, the character of Mr. McMahon will never be gone for good til the day he dies, it pulls too many ratings.|`|c1c78c474f57996e83758e418259767daa	dx will take mcmahons place, they do a better job at it than mcmahon has ever done.|`|AA11252878	Mr. McMahon will be returning as soon as he gets that nasty aftertaste from the Big Show's *** out of his mouth, maybe never!

When he does the west coast pop, he used to turn it into a hurricanranna, but now he just sits on the guy! They need to let the wrestlers make their own matches like they used to, instead of letting those so-called WRITERS do it, cause they have no idea what they are doing. Im sorry i didnt really answer the question, but I hope somebody agrees|`|2FKHNIB2aa	Its all about the show those moves are not meant to look like they hurt they are meant to build excitement so they have to put lot of flair into the move that's what makes them great.|`|k2fFfNtRaa	It suppose to be like magic and the audience is like litte kids, so they cheer.|`|IWDFArMIaa	I think it's so stupid when fans scream!!! what does it accomplish people???? nothing!|`|O6WSs2s5aa	because those people love to see those moves they think its cool and they dont no its fake|`|OfNTLq3Qaa	Fans love the stunner because it usually means everyone with in the first five rows gets to drink beer.|`|JRGttmejaa	your a mark     its becuse they love to cher for ther faves     now ia am a meber of pac  but they think its cool|`|SBzfbIU3aa	Because its the superstars signiture move,  its very hyped up  and its part of the match dat friens lokk 4ward to seeing!!|`|VmoNpWddaa	5 knucke shuffle sucks. Peoples elbow i can see that cause everyone loves the Rock. But hey fans pay money to get into the place, let them have a good time.
AA11276808	No he can't becuase he has already appeared for Inter in the CL this season.|`|ojHN65J0aa	No, he has already played for inter in the group stages.  Juventus isn't the big bad wolf, thats Barca. They are not giants towering over us, we can beat them.      Juve has lost 2 game in a row to pretty average teams. I know, Ive been watching their games.|`|4v278ckwaa	No he wont because he's cup tied.|`|cOPCNP7Laa	I don't think so according to what I know. The CL and UEFA lists were handed in on Sunday and he was signed later so yeah.    Sorry :/|`|DZ24AAkiaa	depends if he played for inter in this seasons champions league then he will be cup tied and wont be able to play
Hiasgb75aa	Assenal are gonna lose!    Edit: This DVD joke is so old, you guys always use it to comfort yourselves when we beat you.     Edit: How many times did you beat us last year???|`|4BppP7Mkaa	haha them and their DVDs|`|Z0IKiIJ4aa	If they win :  Dvd name : The final showdown  subtitile : Our last win in the EPL|`|cOPCNP7Laa	It would be hilarious if they did :D|`|N7fNwIQSaa	They bring out a DVD for every bleeeeeding game against us....plus a mug and saucer to drink your tea off whilst watching it!|`|c1wYc2syaa	Yawnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn|`|5c0ea2e937929dc820b4f96293aa83a2aa	Keep slagging us off, we can all see it is just a cover as you are pi$$ed with the way your crummy club is performing..... See you Sunday....|`|TKDi70uTaa	lets hope we bring out a full length feature film after sunday's showdown. every game for us lately has been as tense as a derby and after seeing the gooners v west ham they aint the team they used to be for sure. coys.
5c0ea2e937929dc820b4f96293aa83a2aa	Why??? They are all past it  Keane Defoe and Chimbonda are still in prime... Go away silly gooner...      Also if slaging off spurs makes you feel better about the gooners suffering.... keep it up... Water off a ducks back.... See you sunday|`|TKDi70uTaa	i dont know any spurs fans who are happy, dont you be giving us the blame cos the club are losing their position as contenders. of course we are gonna love it if you lose your precious champs league spot linzi just like you will if we go down. fact is both clubs are punching way below their wieght.|`|dT3xJ9GWaa	no need,arsenal already the next star for arswenal.it is adebayor,fabregas and djourou|`|LReOvHEdaa	Bring back Flamini and Hleb..I will be more than happy.    FQ2:They are happy to have keane back I guess|`|Oj9ITMSFaa	We all miss them. But buying back you old players never works just ask spurs.|`|cOPCNP7Laa	I think they can't wait for Arsenal to come 5th. But tbh you should get Henry back.    You really miss a forward!|`|N7fNwIQSaa	More like Flamini and Hleb we miss them along with the injured lads baaaadly    FQ2: Im happy|`|Wv0UKUdiaa	Before Valencia game I would beg you to take Henry back but now maybe he will prove that is good enough for Barca!!!!|`|N2PcehV4aa	If we could get a 25 year old Henry and Vieira, along with a 28 year old Tony Adams, we would once again be the best team in the land. Unfortunately that is impossible, and buying back the players you mentioned now when they are well past their prime would not help much (well, Henry would still have something to offer). As for the Spuds, one must remember that they care more about any potential Arsenal failure much more than any Tottenham success. We must cast our minds back only a few months to remember the barrage of claims that Spurs fans were making; 'We will replace you in the top 4', 'Modric will be a revelation', 'We have the best spine in the league - King, Jenas, Berbatov', 'Ramos is better than Wenger'.....all these claims were utter fantasy of course.|`|ixLoI73uaa	as long as you guys stay the hell away from Arteta i dont care|`|X1ij46peaa	ya i think that arsenal should buy henry back it will do good for them nexxt season|`|5vuC2GSXaa	Well not until the summer anyway|`|a85328c1885e0dae2a1db923b89cac28aa	We can get Adams on a free in a few weeks.    Got to agree with commander c, funny how all the pre-season talk of Spurs upstaging us and claiming 4th have now been replaced with how happy they are with us sitting 5th in the table. We might be a big club in a crisis, but at least we're not a little club dreaming of being a big club    And with all these transfers I seriously wonder if Spurs are involved in some shady underworld deals cause what they've been doing recently smacks of money laundering !|`|no3tD0OSaa	If you manage to get Campbell back, wait til you see the whole of White Hart Lane Riot|`|af1fe9ebe396bd1dc330674aa3329c96aa	Brady, Sunderland and Jennings too I reckon...
EsTAylwIaa	i think he played once or twice alex pity because he is crap as for the headlines they do not want to slag of their own kind xx|`|bej55wxUaa	Maybe the transfer fees for both were a factor, Ally.  Riordon was touted as a bright prosepct, whereas Gow was a relative unknown.  Maybe the laptop loyal at it agian, LOL.    Muntheperv, even for you, this is getting embarrasing.  I don't care how often you mention me, YOU ARE NOT BEING UNBLOCKED.  Is that clear enough ?    Notunblockinganyperverts.com|`|ePFdhsCYaa	His only competitive game was the 7 - 2 cup win over Falkirk and since then failed to make it into the Rangers team. The difference with Riorden is that he was a big signing for Celtic and I think out of those 24 appearences only scored 5 times so he was given more than enough chances to make the grade at Parkhead.|`|cTTmHn9paa	Cuz the media are all huns thats why!    Daily Rangers  The Hun  The Evening Rangers      You name it!|`|lsXcvlTbaa	You know the reason Alex as well as I do. Found it strange that Gow went after the very strange collapse of his transfer to Wolves with even more baffling explanation.|`|57rbgBw2aa	Wee Utterpi sher Billys Laptop Loyalists rool ok??
5c0ea2e937929dc820b4f96293aa83a2aa	Well Fifa 2009 updates transfers at the end of the window... So if Football manager dosnt its a rubbish game!!!!!!     Im glad their all back!!|`|7Tw7s6HSaa	Yes i do believe it is, lol|`|WK8887Tsaa	Well, in terms of Spurs, I suppose.    But no...|`|N7fNwIQSaa	Yer it is....i bought Arshavin for Arsenal....and hes pretty good|`|dCbIHBpGaa	I think it's nice of Spurs to hold a reunion and buy back all of their old players. I've heard they are hoping to buy Ossie Ardiles, Steve Perryman and Ricky Villa in summer when the window reopens. Chelsea have been inspired also and are looking to bring back John Bumstead to fill the crack in their defence..|`|3Eixj6Syaa	If you manage Spurs, yeah.    Otherwise, It's pretty outdated.
7RUMbREoaa	Thanks for all of the nice things you guys have said about me-it really did make my day :)    I will have to say that the transport drivers have to be one of the most underrated positions.I have a friend that used to drive a hauler and he had to drive all over the country,make sure everything is where it is supposed to be,buy the groceries,cook for the driver and crew,etc.He described a very labor-intensive position to me.    Thanks again everyone.|`|xTTP2Bv8aa	prolly the guys that put the cars together  Good on ya MOJO, have a great one|`|UYKNpI2Xaa	One of the most underrated jobs would have to go to the spotter. They don't get much credit and work hard out there all day long, but they are one of the first to get the blame when something bad happens.    48MOJO have a great day. I love reading your answers, and you have great taste in drivers. LOL!|`|mXXjoAnfaa	The pit crew.|`|EHtFxGxMaa	The transport driver.    When do you ever hear of them getting accolades????? If it were not for them, NOBODY would be there for the race.    MOJO, you da man...    And there was much rejoicing..    yayyyyy|`|kjAsuC6Haa	I'm going to agree with Maggie. If the wives didn't keep things running at home and support these guys, they wouldn't be able to race at their best. They put up with a lot: long separations, pit lizards and rabid female fans flinging themselves at their husbands, dealing with the kids alone, etc..    48MOJO, you are honored. Have a great day!|`|NC2BfEvLaa	I would have to say the spotter also.You don't hear much about them unless something goes wrong. Those guys have a lot of peoples lives in their control.  Congratulations 48MOJO ,have a great day !!!!|`|icTRTBAraa	I would have to say the tire changers they don't just change the tires they also check them for cracks, leaks and the little holes they get that make the tires go down.  The tire changers give feedback to the team in turn to Goodyear to hopefully make the tires better, you notice I said hopefully.|`|OnXX13yCaa	the person in charge of securing sponsors, running hospitality functions and making everyone feel like a vip. beside the primary sponsors you need the smaller contributors to put the butter on the bread. without these team members there would be no team.|`|739f14d79f8285fdffb364bed6c305feaa	I am going to say the Truck drivers I mean they have to haul the millions of dollars of equipment from town to town, it all sorts of weather with a limited time schedule and all safely and you never hear about them....at least I don't.    MOJO 48 congrats on your day!  Your a great guy to have in our little world, I enjoy your Q/A's very much and your singing ain't half bad either ;)  **Cheers!*|`|MWSv1yfhaa	I think the most underrated people are the people that work at the shop and offices and do not go the track week in and out.    48MOJO I hope you have a great day.|`|VQHGqYXvaa	The gas man !!    Have a great day 48MOJO|`|41980ab28e587a42197eea5a921bca4aaa	The catch can man!    Have a great day MOJO even if you are a 48 fan!|`|JSryPP8faa	I'm going with Tom on this one, the hauler driver. Remember when they had the driving skill's contest's at the track's a few years ago. Thant was cool.   48MOJO seeking 4 in a row. Great driver, great team and better fan all wrapped up into one. Enjoy your day.|`|iO12Vjnvaa	No question the most underrated job on a team has to be the team's gopher...which is usually an entry level spot on a team usually a volunteer or very low paid position. A gopher...."GO FOR" is the guy or gal who goes for the tool left on the truck, goes and fetches the tires from Goodyear; goes and fetches coffee or any snack for the driver and the rest of the crew; dry cleaning, tissue, oil, you name it a gopher fetches it. Still it's job I would gladly do if I could be on a team.    Mojo----I really enjoy your q and a you are an asset to this forum keep up the good job!!!!  But as with any other member of a team....without a good gopher a team couldn't be as successful.    Just an opinion as always.|`|U3ZBUOWaaa	The wives.  Without that support I wonder how many guys would be doing as well.   Here's one for the ladies.        And speaking of one for the ladies...here's to 48MOJO...I always enjoy my "brother's" questions and answers (most times...lol)  But what a great guy and a real asset to our NASCAR Nation house!!!    Have a great day MOJO....*CHEERS*|`|63e6fbd5b85357a27d660c7d5c0b9ee9aa	the spotter have to they really dont get to many breaks at all . they are constantly talking to the driver and other spotters to make deals during the race...   have a nice day MOJO!!!!!!|`|S2vI4VEXaa	Most of the jobs on a team are underrated..    To 48MOJO, enjoy your day..|`|vIcOdePzaa	anybody that is taken for granted until something goes wrong.    48MOJO enjoy your day. You are a great contact and friend. Glad to have you in the Nation.|`|9BtA5Knfaa	I wanna say the spotter, theirs a lot of stuff he's constantly talking to the driver about!!!      48MOJO, I hope you can keep that good MOJO going Mr.48, today is your day, ENJOY IT!!!|`|Q2sZhNmJaa	Underrated job on a team.  The people who build the cars, mechanics.    48MOJO have a great day, I love your detailed answers!  Good to have you in the Nation.|`|5LxpvXSmaa	i agree with then King- the spotter has to be on their toes at all times and the pressure must be immeasurable to say the least.    48MOJO have a great day! Love your answers and a great member of our family here at Nascar Nation.|`|5d77c66b171b12a5932576b2dc7b7dd3aa	Hmmmm, great question..........I am going to go with the jack man because without him being right on point; the 4 tires don't get changed properly...........    Congrats MOJO..............have a good day in the sun!!!!|`|n55igpCUaa	The sweeper boy. If it wasn't for him, there would be stuff everywhere and people would be getting injured because of tripping!    Let's all hear it for the sweeper boy =D|`|71c0e431058e396595b5a2772f5b2d6faa	The spotter has the most underrated job on the team. Nobody seems to remember that they are on the team, yet they have one of the most important jobs, keeping their driver out of harms way.     48MOJO have a great day!!

tvuhGTD9aa	On Boras' advice (regardless he denies it), Ramirez walked away from $40M in Boston.    So there's no way they settle for less than that unless the window is closing -- say, Opening Day, with first pitch time about an hour away, and it's time to finalize the rosters.    Things can change quickly and Ramirez might be in uniform by the end of the week, but right now, it certainly appears that Boras misread the Manny market very, very badly. While he is an incredible hitter, he's also north of 35 and left a very bitter taste in the mouths of executives everywhere (outside of Chavez Ravine) with how he played himself out of Boston. Who wants to trust, either on a personal level or the robustness of the offense, to someone who has pulled such a stunt once? It could happen again.|`|yk4S7uuraa	In defense of Manny, he's not the one calling the shots here, Boras is.  Until Manny steps in, and says "we're doing this deal," like AROD did, Manny isn't going anywhere.    I still feel that Manny may end up in a Mets' uniform.|`|1GNKh8mEaa	I think it is pretty retarded. I mean come on it is 25 million so what u  r not playing where u want to play. Like Bernie Mac once said "Respect is greater than dollars and cents."|`|zFsTSrOcaa	Answer...Scott Boros.|`|dq993QC7aa	Tell me 'bout it. What a dumb*ss. He probably just wants to be on a good team, a really good team, that already has a chance at winning the World Series. Still, he's dumb.|`|1d8ff4af85cfc3c1463d61e54d554260aa	Wow he is a idiot. We should give him the "Bonehead Award".|`|nSSKixvCaa	That is business. I think Manny and Boras think that someone will just offer even more than that but I think he will be disappointed because he is overestimated himself.|`|8dade3f51dce6d39e323275eb907fe07aa	I think he's going to end up losing out on a good deal.  The Dodgers just gave him a chance to have a helluva good contract for one year and test out the market once more next November.  Instead of embracing it, he spat it back to their faces.  I hope the Dodgers pick up Abreu or Dunn and let Manny choke in his own freakin ego.  Then there is Scott Boras who is an *** and adds fuel to the fire, needs to have lemons squeezed in his eyes.|`|p8ahZa8iaa	Sounds like someone who's dying to sign with the Yankees.    If he really wanted to stay in LA, that deal would have been done long ago.|`|op9iJRvBaa	Unbelievable. I'd play for $25.|`|d065d40a6781127c80dc5959554a2d4faa	I guess he wants to be locked up for more than 1 year. However, if he produces this year he can get 20-25 million for the next year. That is the problem though, Manny doesn't want to work at it. He wants a longer deal so he can sit in cruise control for awhile.    I think Manny is on here giving everyone a thumbs down.|`|3ULjjUNlaa	Well, I don't see him as a Dodger than.  Honestly, 25 million a year?  Jeeze, that's just not right.  For any athelete.  Who would turn it down?  Crazy people I guess.|`|GwawzO5Faa	I know it may sound crazy to us but. Why sign a one year deal and be a year older and be in the same situation again next year?     I don't think Manny wants to play in the NL at all. I really think he's looking for an AL team to sign him so that he could play left-field and DH to extend his career.|`|fHxpycJSaa	Yes, that's about right. In today's economy, he turns down 25 million dollars to play baseball. This should makes even his fiercest fans realize what a dope he is. In my dreams, the Dodgers drop him, and no other teams sign him because they don't want anyone that stupid on their roster.|`|u1T5TQP7aa	one with dread locks, that block all of his thinking, CONGRATS MANNY! you're going no where|`|U3ZBUOWaaa	It's getting that its all about the almighty dollar. Can you imagine what we could do with that?  So what if he doesn't get to be where he wants to be.  If he is holding out for more I hope he doesn't get it.        By the way lenny...no need to leave any money next time. A thank you and continued worship will suffice.|`|iPWKzzQtaa	He was offered a 2 year deal earlier. A player of Manny's caliber doesn't have to sign for one year. This is a game of cat and mouse...if they really want him the original offer will go back on the table, 2 years, 45M.    About Manny being an idiot. Oh yes, I agree. If he would have shut up in Boston and finished his contract...he could have filed free agency under normal circumstances. As the best hitter in the game, he could have had a sweet multi year deal.    I think a big risk on Manny is that if he really plays up next time...he will get outcasted, being forced to play for the Nationals or worse, being offered far less money.    A star player only getting offered one year is an insult but it's his own fault.|`|EtEf098yaa	Very simple answer - someone who doesn't want to play for LA.      First off, I don't think he's stupid.  He knows he's not getting more then that from anyone else.  Sounds to me like he has a destination in mind.  Who?  I don't know.  Unless he wants to walk every at bat and collect LESS money he'll steer clear of SF.  I'm guessing he either want to go to the Mets (he's buddy/buddy with Omar) or the Yankees (a chance to win and a chance to stick it to Boston).  I don't see either one happening right now.  I don't see either one of those happening, but you never know.      If he wants money, he'll go to the Nationals (who supposedly want some big free agent to build around).  If htere's something else its anyone's guess.|`|6vzpHTqQaa	A spoiled, egocentric idiot.|`|lPDHMOVZaa	This guy must think that he is god... Manny must be waiting for someone to pay him with the sacrifice of their first born son... 25 million bucks for "1" season?! That is ridiculous!     Bottom line... Manny is not going to get an offer that pays him more, per season, than that... so I hope after he turns down all suitors and comes crawling back to the Dodgers just so he can play this year... that the Dodgers cut his deal in half and only offer him $12 million. Either don't play, or take half of what was originally offered... I hope that's where Manny ends up... pompous b*stard!|`|RcCJSSMPaa	His Ego is bigger than $25 million    Boras is probably stroking Manny's Ego as we write.|`|4SKmjYrsaa	i agree with you 200%    now let me take this from Manny's point of view    He's thinkin that they already offered him 2 years 45mill with a vesting option for the 3rd year, and 1 year 25 million offer strait up. He knows, just like everyone else that he will get a 2 year 50 mill deal! the dodgers are already flirting with it. If you look at it from Manny and Boras view, he did the right thing in the long run    Now, back to your question, WOW! thats a crap load of money to turn down! i'll play for 1 year 25 thousand!|`|P1bO87l1aa	The answer is greed and Scott Boras.|`|kGXU1Dotaa	Let me tell you this if Manny and Scott turned this deal down this could mean they already have a 2nd party that has offered them a better deal i really belive there's another party involved its just being hushed up for now.
217ff35a8ea8ca73e63af6072240aa24aa	Very concerned ,the US strikers a proven goal scorer and would have walked straught in the team ,Sammy s of the boil ,JVOH s slower than a week in the Jail ,Browns improving ,Robsons OK .Mc Geadies come out of the WGS a better player & hopefully will be here for a while yet ,If WGS fails in his 4IAR campaign hes going to have to explain to the fans why he didnt strengthen ,Keane, Lennon ,no chance ,Davy Moyes  is the man for me|`|smA22aNHaa	It could be. Not many managers can handle the Old Firm jobs so we might find it hard to get a good manager.|`|1d9b5228edfe6d8363220570ff4e828caa	thats the way it looks anne marie...to be frank i think strachan would be off his nut if he stayed on after the flack he's received despite the success he's had. i think its been a case of no point in wgs signing new players if he's leaving (on a high) at the end of the season. i hope tae christ keane doesnt get the job though|`|57rbgBw2aa	Yes I think the board realise most of this 2nd rate squad already on the payroll will be joining chesney out the exit door as soon as a new manager gets organised, I'm surprised half aren't gone already.  I'm not 100% happy with Keane myself Anne Marie as he seems a quiter to me... pity chesney wasn't the same the gutless, shameless little parasitical hanger on.. he reminds me of wee Billy Dunoon that other shyte spouting dreamer.|`|w7gKpzMZaa	I THINK WE SHOULD BE GRATEFUL THAT ROY KEANE WOULD EVEN CONSIDER THE CELTIC JOB WHEN I THINK OF EVEN HALF THE SHITE THAT WEE GORDON HAS HAD TO PUT UP WITH FROM A SIZEABLE MINORITY OF CELTIC FANS.

This climate is going to hurt EVERYBODY ! There is also the fact that the spl is not very attractive to the bigger name players. I agree that WGS might be coming to the end with Celtic. Hope he isnt replaced with Keane, I would like to see Craig Levein at paradise.|`|7Tw7s6HSaa	I'm not sure what the reason is but i don't really think we needed to strengthen any area of the team anyway, maybe a left back, but there's always wilson for that position.    I think the end of this season we may see Strachan leaving, regardless of the outcome of the league but i don't think Roy Keane is the man for the job, in fact it think it's laughable that Reid is even considering him.    @ Krissy - 2nd biggest mistake, remember John Barnes, lmao|`|bej55wxUaa	I think Strachan will be replaced by Keane, Annemarie, as you said irrespective of the outcome in the SPL.  I have mentioned this previously.    I see my stalker, Munthecrossdresser, has once again, shock horror, mentioned me in a post.  Don't quite know how I am equated in a Q about the current and future Celtic manager, but then again I am not a pervert or compulsive liar, so I have no idea how Slipiner's mind works.  Nor do I want to know.    Told you before perv, no matter how aften you stalk me, I will not unblock you.  Get the message, for fecks sake, ladybhoy.

Dumbpervertedcompulsiveliar.com|`|ePFdhsCYaa	Roy Keane would be the biggest mistake Celtic could ever make. Surely they wont take a gamble on someone so inexperienced as a manager as him. He has won nothing and has no european experience.|`|S0LSmJ9haa	A "minority" of the Celtic support will never accept WGS anyway, step up Mr Keane...does he have the Rollox for the job?  If we are keeping money for the new man, let's hope he realises we need a striker and a LB.|`|9MtS42oWaa	Anne Marie i heard a similar rumour that Strachan was leaving at the end of the season regardless of weither we win the treble or only the double Ha. Didn't hear Keano was lined up however and like yourself i wouldn't fancy him at this point. One thing is for sure whoever comes in will need a few quid to get us back playing the football we want to see, reckon its time for a change mind you, well have to wait and see.
9MtS42oWaa	Tough one that Anne Marie out of the reserves only Hutchinson and Millar seems to stick out although to be fair i dont watch a lot of the second string. Could not believe we let Caddis go mind you considering we didnt strengthen the full back area, hope that doesnt come back to haunt us.Take your point with McGowan and Sheridan also on loan hope we dont get any injuries to our main three.|`|Tu6TbXN7aa	ima celtic fan but i dunno wat ure on about!|`|rAqdywlcaa	i like kevin garnett, ray allen, and paul pierce. CELTICS ARE GOOD|`|1d9b5228edfe6d8363220570ff4e828caa	who would you promote anne marie? the last 2 to have been given run outs have left on loan. maybe o'dea, miller perhaps? i know we've some quality youngsters like tidser and monti but would they improve the side?|`|7Tw7s6HSaa	I would really like to think so, and i agree, we are not strong enough to fight on 3 fronts, not by any stretch of the imagination.  I will be happy with the league, the other mob can retain the cis cup and scottish cup if they like, i want the league|`|bej55wxUaa	Agreed.  It's the way forward for both clubs.  They will always sign players from elsewhere but the backbone of the team should be homegrown.  Would save a packet and I would wager that most if not all kids brought through the ranks would be more loyal to the club and would also 'play for the jersey' in the true sense.    Another physcotic outburst from Muntheperv.  The other night he was giving someone a hard time and called them 'a disgrace to Scottish football fans'. Now, Celtic need Irishmen from the board down, last I heard Dermott was an Irishman ???  What a load of cobblers.  Don't think he knows that Glasgow, being part of Scotland, is therefore part of Great Britain.  He literally can't spell 'Glaswegian' !  As for the 'good catholic bhoy' bit, give us a break.  No-one with a genuine claim to that title would have anything in common with the endless bigoted nonsense he insists on imposing on this forum.  Every post, irrespective of the subject matter, is greeted with tedious, repetitive bile. Don't think they teach that in the chapel.  A place he probably never goes, unless he is planning to steal from it to finance his next trip to 'Thailand'.|`|smA22aNHaa	Yes they will all get their chance to shine.|`|57rbgBw2aa	Haven't you noticed Anne Marie? most of our youngsters are around 28 Haha. The board is as bad as the management and if Desmond doesn't take a hand in the running of the club then he wants to go back to gun running and organising hooky bets with J.P.Mc Manus and Magner and give up the reigns to a true Celtic board,  we're becoming another British company with people like Reid and Lawwel controlling our interests.. we'll soon lose our heritage and become 100% British and that's not on... A Keane and Lennon partnership might give us back our pride....  we'll keep the Green Flag flying high!|`|S0LSmJ9haa	Aye..where is my Paddy? :-)  personally not happy about either Caddis or Sheridan going on loan, and am not happy that McGowan went either. Sheridan reminds me of Kyle Lafferty but I am amazed we got rid of our 4th choice striker even though he is shite without bringing anyone in, I seriously think they had planned for Hibs to say yes.  Maybe after his semi final performance Boruc is now 4th choice striker? ;-)

Kh9Wzrhyaa	I find it amusing that when making an argument for the KHL being a better league you reference Dan LaCouture as a reason why. He of 337 games played and a staggering 20 goals scored in the NHL. Guess he was just using the NHL as a warm-up league.     The game's best talent can be found in the NHL. Players from around the world know to become a star in this league you have established yourself as an elite hockey player. Enough said.|`|e7576a139b6789e59e2195c707b6c228aa	Obviously most of the best players in the world are in the NHL. Esa Tikkanen played for Anyang Halla, that doesn't make the Asian League the equivalent of the NHL.|`|agN864Vdaa	If the KHL paid their players, I would say then it would be a fair comparison.|`|WgTKHqlnaa	I think you're referring to the KHL not CHL. Anyway, the NHL is and always will be the superior league. They have the money to pay the top players in the world. Sure, Jagr is a decent player, the NHL has Iginla, Crosby, Ovechkin, Malkin, Lecavalier, etc (the list goes on and on). We even match their jerks, they have Emery, we have Avery. Anyway, it's the NHL, no contest. Do you think the NHL could trade the Red Wings to the KHL for Jagr? I'm just joking.|`|VWLtJoX2aa	NHL, follow the money.    Also, during the lockout year some players went to play for other leagues but they came back to the NHL...
q8dX0MsNaa	use a size 2 or 4 baitholder and when you open your mussels, keep them whole. don't tear them up. that's the secret. then run the hook through the tough central mass, wrap the soft parts with the mantle (the longer pieces that look like a worm), pinning the mantle with the hook holding everything in place. cast gently but you can cast them. l use them all the time in the ocean. l like fresh better than frozen.  l don't find the need for string or bags when using them. just naked mussel.|`|EDc2Ipe6aa	I only fish plugs in the surf now but, when I was fishing bait we would take some silk thread and wrap the soft yellow bank mussels onto the hook (white or red thread)|`|mMFJrPbvaa	Well you can put the meat of the mussel in a nylon, like a stocking to use as a sort of "sack".  The nylon with the meat in it stays on the hook for a really long time.  Another thing I have used for clam bellies is orthodontal bands.  They are mini rubberbands used for braces.  You can go to any dentist and ask for a bag of them and its only like a buck for 500 of them.  Regular small office rubberbands work well too|`|oMjVp4zGaa	I always would put the hook through at one end, turn it over (spin the bait over half way) and put it back through the bait and do it again and again and when it would start to dissolve I would wrap all the runny skank around the hook shaft. I learned after I stopped using mussels to leave the shell on the meat to use the threads attached to do the wrapping around the shaft with it and it makes a 100% sellable presentation on the bottom|`|pDitGEC8aa	If the mussel is fresh, ie, it is still alive when you open it, it should be tough enough to stay on the hook if you're not casting. If you must cast, that's a different story. Use rubber band or a mesh to wrap it around the hook, just like a clam bait.    In my area, blue mussel has a very tough tongue while bank mussel has juicy meat.|`|BhWmEZWNaa	I use a 3 hook rig 2 to 3 apart.

iPWKzzQtaa	You have there 4 different kinds of pitcher....so let me ask you a question first....then I continue.    How about Joe Namath's knee...what about Gale Sayers? Would they be the best ever if not for injury?    As a small man, Pedro...he's about 5'10, I think, throwing hard fastballs and breaking balls, he was bound to get arm trouble. And mentally his head was not always in the right place.    Since all 4 players are going to the HOF at some point I will give you my opinion. Randy Johnson, got a late start due to control problems early in his career...when he was pitching in a groove, he went 7-8 starts in a row giving up less than 5 hits per start, striking out more than 10 each time...now he's had very serious back problems requiring 2 surgeries, but he's still pitching. Now had he been healthy always, he might have had 350 wins by now.    Your question is designed for us to say Pedro is the best, or would be if not injured. Maybe, but I cannot say that for sure.|`|6e083f2ba7e3043fb68160d6bfe280dcaa	Speculation is always 100%.  To say that if any pitcher had stayed healthy his entire career he could have been the best.  The same could be said of Doc Gooden. Had he stayed off drugs he could have had a much longer career and many more 'W's.   Had Herb Score not been hit in the eye by a line drive off the bat of Gil McDougal he could have had a "great" career.  Had Denny McLean (31-game winner in 1968) not been involved with gamblers, drugs, etc he would have lasted many more years in the Majors and be in the Hall-of-Fame and not been in prison twice.  Had Ted Williams not spent 5-years in the military in two wars (2nd WW & Korean) he would have played 5 more years and had many more home runs.  It's easy to play the "What If" game". What we have to go by is what really happened.  (Think of this: If the opponent hadn't of hit a home run in the bottom of the 9th, we would have won the game.) There's a whole bunch of "what if's"  My order is different than your order and others who will answer. It's strickly personal opinons. My order as they stand is:  Randy Johnson - Greg Maddux - Roger Clemens & Pedro 4th.  This is why baseball is the best sport. Debate... is great.|`|mqgS6Dfxaa	Pedro Martins would not have been the best pitcher if he stayed healthy.  Pedro Martinez was a much better pitcher than Martins.  LOL    Look at the best 5 year stretch for each player.  Pedro 1999-2002 23-4 2.07, 18-6 1.74, 7-3 2.39, 20-4 2.26, 14-4 2.22  Maddux 1994-1998 16-6 1.56, 19-2 1.63, 15-11 2.72, 19-4 2.20, 18-9 2.22  Johnson 1998-2002 19-11 3.28, 17-9 2.48, 19-7 2.64, 21-6 2.49, 24-5 2.32  Clemens 1997-2001 21-7 2.05, 20-6 2.65, 14-10 4.60, 13-8 3.70, 20-3 3.51    So even going by their peaks, I'd still put Maddux over Pedro follwed by RJ and then Clemens.|`|nqdDe3cJaa	who the hell is Pedro Martins and why are you comparing him to Hall of Fame pitchers ???????|`|5xIroQjMaa	It's always unfortunate to see a pitchers career cut short by injury, but sadly that has to be taken into account. Look at what Sandy Koufax did...a Hall of Famer even though he only played half a career. But moving beyond him to the four that you mentioned:    Greg Maddux I think is unarguably the best of the four. He probably had less raw talent than any of the others, but still managed to do the most with it. He was great not because of his stuff, but because he outthought the hitter. And of course, he did it without drugs. I'm sorry, but you can't not mention drugs where Roger is concerned, because his career was built around steroids.     My order would be Maddux>Johnson>Pedro>Clemens    And the first three are definite Hall of Famers. As for Clemens, well personally I felt the man was a slimeball long before the steroids thing came out, and there's no denying he has a Hall of Fame worthy career, but whether he gets in or not is a question. I feel that they need to make a decision on the steroids plagued players. Either let them all in, or keep them all out, but there's no way you can treat them on an individual basis. Bonds, McGuire, Clemens...these guys either all get in, or all stay out.|`|d065d40a6781127c80dc5959554a2d4faa	So we are putting up 4 pitchers up here over 100 + years of baseball played, specifically over the last 20. So no other guys could have been good those first 80 + years?     What about Bob Fellar? If he didn't go to the war he may have been the best there ever was.    Another thing might help is if you could actually spell Pedro Martinez's name right. I'm not that big of a grammar freak but, if you are going to promote a guy at least learn how to spell his name.    I know you wanted the last two decades but there are so many other pitchers out there.|`|39fxsuGaaa	I love Pedro but Clemens was the best of the bunch.|`|5EuOTAjJaa	Four great or near great seasons do not a career make.  Every big league pitcher should stand or fall on his career record with a due consideration of his great years thrown in.     I'm not sure what you are after here, but I do not consider Pedro to be better than Clemens or Maddux or Johnson.    Of the four, Maddux is in my opinion, the most outstanding pitcher since Warren Spahn.    Pedro is, of course, the greatest seven inning pitcher of all time. 400 MLB starts and only 46 complete games. That is really kind of pitiful. The other three are all better than that.
HNnVrvCfaa	You're right - it is a crazy thought.  Haha nah, I wouldn't mind seeing Murray in the final at French Open versus Nadal but I sense Nadal will, once again, prevail.      Murray is indeed a worthy opponent and when he has lost to Fed and Nadal he has always put up a hell of a fight.  I feel that there is so much hunger this year from so many players that all the slams are going to be incredibly close -perhaps with the exception of the French though which Rafa seems to be dominating.  Can he be beaten?  I doubt it.      I thought I had seen a new attitude from Murray but it has to be said that at the Aussie Open he sort of seemed to let his anger and frustration get the better of him.  I hope he fights back from it though because when he is the right frame of mind he is a real threat.  It's always nice to know the applecart can be unsettled - even though I adore Rafa's play.      Roll on Roland Garros.|`|QlrIUIfOaa	It is crazy.  As long as the equipment favors 6'10" freaks on the men's tour and 6' Amazons on the women's, and the tournaments have to slow down the surface by making hard courts "gritty" and grass courts "sandy" the sport will remain in decline.|`|3jBUJxOdaa	yeah, its crazy|`|6QhACK70aa	it is so crazy that u need to see a shrink i believe|`|EZf00NJJaa	Possible , yet highly unlikely to happen.|`|N9pKl35Xaa	Yeah, i wouldnt put it past Andy to out do the guys in the French... Although Andy has had people talking, i think its now moved on to Verdasco.. i think Verdasco has the better game against Rafa and Nadal at the moment and any player really if he keeps up his impressive form     Andy's a good guy, but i dunno, still something about his game isnt making peoples eyebrows raise too high just yet. Wouldnt put it past him to make it a fair way into the rounds of the French, Wimbledon and US Opens this year though. Definately got what it takes, but im not sure winning a major is at hand just yet (im so gunna be proved wrong i bet lol)|`|Elg7pnWiaa	I believe that only an injury will stop Rafa from winning his 5th straight Roland Garros tournament. He has no rival in that surface, nobody seems to be able to counteract the very very very lifted drive shots that come from him. And winning Australian Open he has demonstrated that his playing has improved a lot. I can't even see anybody else winning in Paris in the next 2-3 years, he has won some clay tournaments even not being 100% in physical condition.

XVYRUzkEaa	That was a commanding performance by India. An amazing display of hitting initially from Yuvraj Singh and Virender Sehwag, and then by Yusuf Pathan towards the end of the innings. Even the loss of the big wickets of Sachin Tendulkar and Gautam Gambhir early didn't prevent India from reaching what is by some distance the highest score at the Premadasa.   I think Virender Sehwag's Strike-rate is better than Yuvraj Singh. So I would term Sehwag's century better.   India has to bowl well now. But I think India is going to win this match.    EDIT: India gets rid of Sanath Jayasuriya. Now the chances for Sri Lanka to win looks bleak.    Srini: Sehwag scored 116 of 90 balls whereas Yuvraj scored 117 of 95 balls. Sehwag's Strike-rate is 128.88 whereas Yuvi's Strike-rate is 123.15. That proves it, SEHWAG'S INNINGS WAS BETTER THAN YUVRAJ SINGH'S INNINGS.    Srini: That is because Yuvraj got more strike than Sehwag!!!    EDIT: India WON! Pragyan Ojha on fire!!|`|JZCNMeQyaa	India is gonna win....Sri Lankans will have to taste the bitter defeat again..Yuvi's century was better but Sehwag also wasn't bad|`|91y0pMzeaa	murali and mendis will score centuries from 10 and 11 and still srilanka will lose by about 80 runs|`|dJcPxDBUaa	yeah... fantastic centuries by both yuvi and viru...

INDIA wins any doubt , even if Jayasurya fires all his cylinders. Kadamby fires also it will be inadequate.

I rate Yuvi's century as better as he scored faster than Sehwag.    Mr. Yahoo: I agree with your stats. But, Yuvraj scored his century at 29th over. But Sehwag scored at 31st over. Remember that Yuvraj came to crease after Sehwag.    Mr. Yahoo: I just feel Yuvraj inning was better. He scored a sixer whereas sehwag did not. I have no problem if you feel Sehwag innings was better. Because, everyone is entitled to their opinion.
N9pKl35Xaa	I would rather be seen balling my eyes out than be seen pulling my undies out of my *** every two seconds. Although neither of them are embarrassing, i think respectively, crying is the more appropriate one. I play soccer and i know all too well about the undie problem, but you dont just stand there yankin it out every minute because its not very lady like, nor is it manly? like lol.  I'm also over the crying part, its not the first time Federer's done it, people are only attacting him because this time when he cried he was the losing player, which i think has absolutely nothing to do with his loss. Vladimir must be one of those men who were brought up and told strictly that if you cry you're less of a man, however these days you're actually more of a man and more attractive to women if you show your emotional side. Its not like Federer cried everytime he loses a game. He had alot of expectations on his back that night he was probably overwhelmed by the fact that a handful of greats were behind him, taking time out of their lives to actually come down and watch a great match. Anyone who admires the greats and respects the greats of the sport as much as Federer does, would be somewhat overwhelmed by their presence.|`|U7BkuEU9aa	Both Fed and Rafa are remarkable men that should be admired for all they are inside of a tennis court and out. You don't have to hate on Rafa because some stupid people are angry that Fed is not some emontionless robot...|`|b70XH245aa	i would rather been seen crying..but federer was acting...sooo like a baby...butt i mean but i fell rather sad wen federer cried..well i do feel federer has no chance of getting another grandslam..mabe he could win wimbeldon but i think we r gonna see him cry more...|`|Qd6mOb1saa	First of all, I'm a Federer fan.  I don't mind him crying when he wins a grand slam.  That's tears of joy.  But crying after you lose a grand slam final in front of your opponent and millions of other fans?  That I can't accept.  The first thing I said when I saw him crying was "Why the hell are you crying?"    This is not a kids game.  Be a man.  What he should have done is held back his emotion, hold his head high, and come back with a vengeance next time against Rafa in the final.  If he wants to cry because of that defeat, he should really cry in his privacy after all are said and done.  You never saw great champions like Tiger Woods in golf, or Sampras, Agassi, Borg, Edberg, Becker, etc cried in front of their opponent and the public after they lost a grand slam final.|`|VpLrhh4laa	OMG, LMAO!!    ooops my a$$ just fell off.|`|MGTnkGnWaa	Crying...crying shows sorrow, but not bad sportsmanship. In my opinion, if you are not serious about a sport, you have no say in whether or not it is okay to cry when you lose.|`|JUblRbuEaa	I don't care if I'm crying or sobbing or pouting as long as I could be great enough to be on TV for an important tennis match--win or lose =b

The reason they gave Undertaker the win is because it is a reason to have a face vs face (or good guy vs good guy) match at Wrestlemania.

As for Cena, he will most liklely take on Orton and/or Edge at Mania leaving HBK to probably take on someone else.|`|LtF6Z73Yaa	i would of wanted micheals to win because it was his hometown and undertaker winning was kinda random|`|0KaT7Z7paa	I'm glad taker won!!!|`|e44af3d40d5f0f93121c0d87411a9511aa	Orton doesn't need any more push ... it was good to see Undertaker get it so that he can start his farewell tour on top of the world!|`|5ce1a4e084303d0af7f28437324670a6aa	I can't help it that your dumb *** follows and believe in kayfabe and I am a "smart" about this business.

a9f693c71e4b465afcc9a6b377b02694aa	When Chiarelli traded him to Anaheim, he described Bochenski as a guy who 'only showed up 50% of the time and mailed it in the rest".|`|AA10068004	I think a few here have covered the deal with this guy. All I know is when the Hawks traded him we got Versteeg from Boston as part of the deal. Not a bad move...lol|`|XQoH9ZI5aa	Loose puck in the offensive zone and he puts on the jets to try to create a scoring chance......play is going the other way is he is as lazy as they come...IMO his should be a career AHLer to spite a decent pair of hands.     Don Cherry raved about this guy when he was in Ottawa......he was his Rookie of The Year prediction one year....LOL.     Some guys just don't get it.|`|UoUaO52taa	I guess like Homes said he's a horrible defensive forward|`|naZQqrNeaa	From what I have read, his defensive game is terrible.  He can score....if he can hold onto the puck.  He is not super fast forward, but his offensive game picks up where the rest lacks.  Seems like no team is really willing to give him a chance.      Good observation.....I can't imagine why anybody would dig around on the Lightning roster unless at gunpoint, lol.|`|VWLtJoX2aa	He is not on the Lightning roster and probably won't be called up.  He had one good year in Boston but I guess he just in not good enough.  While he had an impressive start in the AHL he was never able to make that transition to the NHL.
k3y2ViUyaa	why not?????she will definitely do it once again...she may not b dat good on clay court but if she plays well w'out losing her focus she will definitely win again....same goes for wimbledon...she will claim d trophy if she improvd on her stamina...she's d finalist last year,so the possibilty is ther|`|AA10725587	She is a great player but I don't think it will happen.|`|pqExee6Oaa	No, she will falter at ROLAND Garros.|`|FYd1ndVxaa	If she is 'made' to win, then by no means it will not be possible! But if she is playing out of her own focus, fight and ability, yes, but a little harder if she is not 'made' to win... Whatever it is, she plays great but needs to be consistent, and she will probably not be winning Roland Garros again.. She has chance in her own home soil.. Remember, there are Dementieva, Safina, Ivanovic, Jankovic, Zvonareva, Venus, and so many talented top 10 beaters.. So, the chance for another 4-straight Serena Slams is not probable.. Since she has already won two straight slams at US Open and Australian Open that she only needs to win another two straight slams to make it, her chance is now at least 5 out of 10|`|Y31Ci8vlaa	There is a great possibility for serena to achieve more slams.She is the true fighter in women's tennis after her sister venus williams.Looking at her game the other day,I can say that she will be able to beat everybody.Serena williams is definitely going to win the upcoming grandslams this year.|`|b70XH245aa	tataly she cano it..the luck goes all the way for her.....i hate her|`|EzSMKnG9aa	as much as i admire her game and i think that she's a great champion, but i don't see her achieving the Serena Slam once again.  Her game is really good, but when it comes to clay,,,,,,, she doesn't have a clay-court style of play. She's won Roland Garros once, but i don't think that she'll do it again.  There are many players who are now better than her on clay and can easily defeat her. as for Wimbledon and the US open,, she can win them again, if she stays fit and keep her mind in it.  Serena is mentally inconsistent.|`|bsG2smjWaa	yes most definitly  she has already put pressure on the competition   and she like a person who culd be more consistant at the  1 spot|`|Fez9gSf3aa	I hope she can win more slams this year. If she is focused,she can win at least two more IMO.|`|QlrIUIfOaa	No, but really, I could care less.    The Williams sisters, Sharapova and the 6'10" freaks on the men's tour are the reasons I have lost interest in what used to be my favorite sport.  The sport has been ruined by the equipment manufacturers.  The sport is unrecognizable.      I surprised Laver shows up to watch.|`|6S8KjBLQaa	No, she can't beat her sissy at Wimbly, and she isn't good on clay. She could win the US Open again, however she won't win on clay or grass. Congrats for her though..are you stoked?|`|C9r94iTmaa	No because Serena doesn't have the finesse and her shots would not work on clay.  I don't think she will win the French Open.  At Wimbledon, I could see her winning it unless if Venus is on fire.|`|degfdvTGaa	Can't see her winning the French|`|uuHrf7cGaa	The way the competition is going as we saw in AO - seems that way. The Russians are all choking or injured - Serbians are no where near - So I see the way Azarenka played - she will be the one to beat. But the clay and grass courts are entirely different surfaces than hard courts and we need to see how well the competition plays. If Serena needs to win French - then she needs to be like she played in semis and finals - if not some one will knock her. Venus can win Wimbledon.
aTBs7pJ4aa	very likely with serena getting better an better.. and with justine henin out.. and sharpova hardly playing yet.. and with ivanovic being so inconsistent and with jankovic not steping up her game enough..    there is not alot of stiff competition to stop her..... so it could very well be it|`|6W4vcjFhaa	Serena could win all the tournaments this year if she continues to play.  The problem with Serena is that she doesn't train.  She get into  tournament for improve each game and so anyone can beat her before she gets to the final week.  She seems quite excited that she won and so might put the work in.  If this happens she could win them all this year.  The big question is - Does Serena wants to win them all?  If  she wants to she can.  There are a few young players on the horizon but Serena has the edge in experience.

5c2d5616da2cda512396f29008c535d2aa	Cualquier entrenador o jugador fracasa cuando entra al america. Y es que a este equipo lo que le hace falta es humildad. No han podido conseguir un campeonato limpio hace muchos a?os. El ltimo que consiguieron se decidi no en la cancha, sino en las oficinas de televisa. Mas del 50% de sus seguidores son comprados a base de publicidad. Es por eso que me apenan los aficionados sinceros que siguen a ste equipo. No se dan cuenta que a los directivos lo que menos les importa son ustedes?. Yo les aconsejo no que se cambien, sino que durante unos dos campeonatos no vallan a sus partidos, que noten que no son ustedes borregos a los que manejan a su antojo, y aunque ganen no acudan a los estadios, para que traten de reconquistarlos a base de honradez, juego limpio y humildad. Desgraciadamente parece que influyen en sus seguidores, pues cuando platica uno con ellos se muestran soberbios. Amiga, has del equipo Guadalajara tu segunda opcin, as cuando los otros te fallen, ya sabes que cuentas con nosotros.|`|2e071120ed4b5ae4c963372299179811aa	Querida amiga guilas yo le voy a las Chivas y me da gusto ver perder a tus aguilitas pero djame comentarte algo. Es probable que seas muy joven para saber del xito de tu equipejo en los a?os 70s. Quien se encargaba de todo lo deportivo en el Club era un se?or, Panchito Hernndez que saba mucho de ftbol y se coordinaba muy bien con el entrenador en turno, logrando equipos muy competitivos.La Directiva a lo suyo. La parte administrativa. El problema actual del Amrica es que TODOS los se?ores de pantaln largo quieren ser los estrellas y no permiten que el entrenador trabaje adecuadamente. No s si sepas pero a Benhakker lo corrieron porque, en una ocasin, durante un entrenamiento, el Presidente del equipo le "di" la alineacin que deba poner para el prximo juego porque no le gustaba como estaba jugando el equipo cuando, en se momento Tus guilas eran el mejor equipo del torneo, por cierto, tenan un juego muy espectacular.Benhakker le contest: "T mandas en tu oficina, en la cancha mando yo". Obvio decirte que corrieron a Benhakker y el equipo se cay. No tan slo hay que correr a Lapuente, debe cambiar la mentalidad de los actuales directivos lo cual, para fortuna de nosotros.. so va a estar muy ca?n. Por so no funcionan los jugadores.Recuerda al "Chaco" Gimnez, de noche en tus aguilitas, y el ms importante en el Campen Pachuca. ?La diferencia? una Directiva que hace su chamba, un excelente entrenador, muy decente por cierto, que hace la suya sin interferencias y por ende jugadores motivados. Lstima por ustedes y gran alegra para nosotros porque ESOS SE?ORES  no entienden que los que ganan y pierden los partidos son los jugadores NO ELLOS.  Saludos.

I am curious to see how the Steelers do next year considering their choice of their new coach & what about them Viking's?|`|jpWtZUEqaa	The Colts should atleast return to the playoffs  because they are not going to lose a major offensive player like the Steelers did with the Bus. Even if the Colts lose Freeney, June and Harper, they will get their because their defense sucked during this season and they made the playoffs. However, just like a tragic accident hurt the Steelers playoff chances, anything can happen to the Colts and no playoff spot is locked up until its locked up.|`|3CJZRmElaa	Probably not.  I think there's a good chance they'll meet in the playoffs again this post-season.|`|bf513c2f611784726477fc1aa990ce7caa	I think not only will they make the playoffs, they will have a good chance to go back to the Bowl. If they upgrade their defense, they will have a very good chance. Their offense doesn't need any help. They are a better team than the Steelers.|`|nomad8NPaa	depend on how good the team is next year. right now they've got some stud players, so it all depends on who comes back next year. but i think that they will still be pretty good next year.|`|f942ad78354c8d3d0f6256e0a4da8d67aa	no the colts will make the playoff just not the superbowl|`|1146600b8aec8f6be9df470eb913b279aa	No, The Colts will be back to the playoffs, but not the Super Bowl next year. They are a good team, but the AFC is just too good. The Colts may lose the best player on their defense, Cato June, and some of their better players. They may lose one of their running backs, Dominic Rhodes. They have a problem with letting their free agents leave. I believe next year's super bowl will be Bears vs. Bengals, or Bears vs. Chargers  Here is a list of their free agents:    Boiman, Rocky  LB  UFA    David, Jason DB RFA   Gardner, Gilbert LB RFA   Harper, Nick DB UFA   June, Cato LB UFA   Keiaho, Freddy LB ERFA   Klecko, Dan DT UFA   Lilja, Ryan OG RFA   Moorehead, Aaron WR UFA   Morris, Rob LB UFA   Mungro, James RB UFA   Rhodes, Dominic RB UFA   Schobel, Bo DE RFA   Scott, Jake OG RFA   Sorgi, Jim QB RFA   Thomas, Josh DE RFA   Utecht, Ben TE RFA   Wilkins, Terrence WR UFA|`|251a71e6237c8bca454f268ea5f2d21eaa	I sure hope not because that's just freakin' sad when that happens, especially when it's pretty much the same players, coaches, etc...|`|vOcGilEbaa	no, becuse the colts will keep all of the same people and will stil return to the playoffs. Evne though the steelers basically did this, Rothisberger was injured, but still played for a lot of the season. The colts will make the playoffs next year, unfortunately.|`|RcLlJwLGaa	I think the Colts will be back into the playoffs again.     Health has everything to do with it.  The Steelers were pretty banged up this year and couldn't get all the way back onto their feet by the end of the season.  If the Colts key players can stay healthy, they will go back to the playoffs.|`|b18a422a5f511c7083089e33975d72eeaa	No the Colts will def make the playoffs, they are too talented a team not to.    And Mr. Cash, you never even addressed my "concern." Manning's postseason didnt even compare to ANY of Brady's 3 when he won it all. You said NOTHING about that...figures Colts fans cant even come up with anything to say to that lol.    The Colts have a legit shot at winning it all next year since they arent losing anybody big (they'll prolly franchise Freeney)|`|AA10103147	No. The Steelers played well but don't have the overall talent the Colts have.|`|AA11899537	YEP, but they will be in the playoffs|`|440de272c4e0f8a0c994ad5b3cb0d3c8aa	Since Peyton Manning is some type of "machine-freak,"  I think they'll make it.  Also, a lot of people (especially Colts-haters) are saying that the Bears lost the game more than the Colts won it, so, I believe that the players will want to prove the world that they are a tough team.  The team is pretty much the same offensively.  If they can draft some good D guys, their defense can actually improve.  They have Bob Sanders and they might franchise tag Freeney.

You have pitchers in high school who can't break the highway speed limit and you have the exceptional few, and I do mean few, who can throw over 90. The average fastball for MLB is 91, to take that and go backward, I'd say high school would be about 79-80. There are too many people around who think they or their kid throws 85 mph, when they can't break 80. That's why you have all these high school pitchers that have good records, good stats and never play beyond high school. At the high school level you can throw 75 mph fastballs by a lot of hitters, and you can trick most of the other hitters  with "junk". If you or your friends say they throw 90 and you never played above the high school level, you or they are lying. Pitchers that throw 90 are few and far between, and they get the oportunity to show how good they are beyond high school.|`|429375c665c0b987852742de079d25ccaa	depends on the level  D1 - good pitchers high 80's  DII - low 80's  DIII - high 70's  keep in mind this is averages.

I could hit mid 80's also. so there will be variations, but for the average thats it.|`|c0a5f2b093c39765d702166698654b93aa	Frosh Baseball would be high 60 low 70s.

AA11686626	Starting in Dec. 2005, the International Gymnastics Federation (FIG), changed the score construction, routine requirements,  and skill values (Code of Points).  It has been tweaked a couple times since the initial submission of the COP.  There are two scores: a technical or difficulty score (additive), and an executive score (punitive).  The combination of the two is the final score.    For Men's gymnastics the scoring is as follows:    For the technical score, each element has been given a value of A through F or 0.1 to 0.6.  There are five element groups on each event.  A gymnast receives 0.5 for each element group fulfilled up to 2.5.  In addition, depending on the event there are also combination bonuses of up to 0.2.  Add up the most diffcult 10 skills, plus the element groups, and bonus and you have the technical score.    The execution score is 10.0.  The judges deduct all errors from this score:  small - 0.1, medium - 0.3, large - 0.5 and falls -0.8.    There are additional nuances, but this is a fairly straight forward summary.  You can check out www.fig-gymnastics.com or www.ngja.org for the detailed information, including the Code of Points.|`|82be68ec4be773ae61d8c6f1f06827daaa	Do you mean prior to 2006 or starting now. the code of points has reciently changed. The new scores are made up of a tech score and an exicution score. The tech score depends on the amount of difficulty in the routine. The exicution score is always taken out of a 10. Points are deducted from that 10 for form breaks, falls, steps, etc. then what's left of the exicution score will be added to the tech score. This new scoring system is being used for elite competitors only. All optyional and compusrary gymnasts are still using the old 10.0 system. That system was used prior to this year and is as follows: Your start value depended on how difficult your routine was. One your start value was determined points would be deducted for fiorm breaks, falls, steps etc. Whatever was left was your score. Hope that helps!!!!!!!!!

a8a956c005a4d9bc85d0004fa778dfd0aa	Umpires give pitchers new balls when a ball gets scuffed -- that is, when the ball gets some roughness on the hide.  A mark from grass or from the bat doesn't warrant a new ball.  But a badly pitched ball that hits the dirt will invariably get scuffed.    Why is a scuffed ball bad?  Because a pitcher can actually take advantage of an altered ball surface in the way he pitches, actually causing the ball to do odd things that make it harder for the batter to hit the ball.  And that's illegal in baseball. (Pitchers have been known to cheat by wiping vaseline on a ball, or secretly scuffing the surface with a file.)  That's why umpires are always looking at the ball between plays -- to make sure it's still good as new.|`|3811cf2118d0cdbb069be777cffa6108aa	Here is a secret, told to me by an umpire: a large number of balls taken out of the game because they are "dirty" or because someone objected to them, are stashed in the umpire's bag and brought out again several innings later.|`|758d8348e9bf3a1795b6a2bad265f83baa	they may keep playing the same ball, but not before the UMP looks it over and returns it to play.|`|e65d6f0d2890780ae2e698ca76c77acfaa	You know what. That's a good question.  Maybe the umpire runs out of balls to use|`|6940636c14f0c7788b4864b40489789baa	Dirt is bad, vdy vdy bad.|`|e4e5b432abada8d45410c07eac3eb838aa	If you watch when a pitch hits the dirt you'll see the ump ask to see the ball from the catcher every time.  He'll look at it and if it is good, he'll put it in his pouch for use later, but if it isn't he'll toss it aside and it is removed from the game.  A scuffed ball is an unfair advantage for the pitcher...they can make the ball do a lot more moving around due to the enhanced grip the scuffs provide.  The ump is the one who decides if the ball is useable or not.  A pitcher can ask for a new one, but it doesn't mean the old ball will not be used again.|`|628c4d3d5d4a63d381f3eb0268652d9eaa	Wow. I don't know the answer to your question, but Wow. "Man" got a -21 rating.|`|00b4720ccfc696c724458cad86a64684aa	because they have to use at least 50 balls in every game so they use any excuse to get a new one.|`|b112b0ee2a6089b51ae2647004ba1617aa	When the pitch ends up in the dirt the pitcher sometimes asks for a new ball because he complains that it had a bad grip to it. The pitcher is the one who decides if they should play with the new ball.|`|AA10305110	well wen the ball is hit the pitcher could throw the ball in and get a new one but if it hits the dirt off of a pitch the umpire is right there so they just do it. but i also think wen it hits the dirt pitching its got a backspin and the part of the ball that hit the dirt it catches alot more dirt and it also slides further in the dirt unlike a hit the ball doesn't it has a regular spin so it doesn't catch as much dirt and it doesn't slide as much|`|7bf8ff7e086f4e877dfbde20d16972f9aa	It's because the dirt on the ball causes more movement. It's usually always the batter that requests it be thrown out.|`|c202ef16098b6e694553d3d0d9928233aa	They do not use the same ball when it is hit. The umpire takes the ball and gives it to the bat boy to get cleaned and then thay re use theball but if it is dented or damged in any way it is not used at all. thats why they go through 100 some baseballs in a game.|`|AA11265153	because when the ball hits the dirt at a high speed it causes rips or tears in the lether, this makes the ball spin in different directions, and gives the puitcher a slight advantage

GHIN is provided through 61 State, Regional or National Golf Associations to over 10000 clubs|`|sBrummATaa	not my home course that i know of but i dont ask either|`|GJjZ4cEPaa	Most courses give USGA certified handicaps, private or public.  Some websites do it as well such as the GolfChannel.com.    Why not play golf a few times and see if you truly like the game before investing more money?  But be careful, read around this golf section and you'll see the game can get a little addicting.|`|hwaBhUzJaa	The only reason you NEED a handicap is for tournaments. If you WANT to know your handicap, you can calculate that yourself. You need at least ten scores to calculate it.    Here is a link with instructions:  http://www.golfq.com/calculate-handicap....|`|Pc0QjrQ4aa	I'm not really sure what you're asking as your middle paragraph is odd, but I'll try to answer your question.    Almost all public golf courses (including municipal courses) have a handicap service (if you're in the US, it's an official USGA handicap).  Just go to your local course, and tell them you want to sign up for a handicap.  It'll cost approximately $15-$35 per year (you sign up annually).      Depending on what service the course uses (GHIN is the most common), you can post scores either from home via the Internet, or at the computer at the course (my home course in Ontario, Canada allows Internet posting, but requires you to turn in all scorecards within 7 days of posting).      Most courses have handicap cards or stickers available at the start of the month with your name, ID  (or GHIN ), and your home handicap, and your USGA handicap (my home course handicap was 3.2, and my overall index was 2.5; I haven't played since October- we get this stuff called snow and freezing weather here :) and won't again until April).    If you play at a private club, you can post your score on your home course's computer (as noted above).  These are referrred to as "away" rounds (as in, not at your "home" course).      The decision to join a golf club as a member has no relation to signing up for a handicap.  A majority of golfers who have handicaps are not members of a private club.

gb9REJN4aa	It means "by the sea" and is very much related to today's modern use of the word "pool," as in "swimming pool." Long before we had artificial pools in our backyards, a "pool" was a sheltered place to swim, usually tidal, and almost always associated with the sea. This is unsurprising when you consider the locations of Liverpool and Hartlepool; both are right on the water and are famous seaports.    Extra trivia: Hartlepool was named after deer seen there (male deer are each called a 'hart,' from the same origins as our word 'herd') and Liverpool may have been named for the muddy color of the water, for the eels (called an 'elver' long ago) there, or from the Welsh Llif (meaning a flood, and also as a name for the Atlantic Ocean by extension).|`|X1ij46peaa	they r both near water n liverpool means 'LIVER'bird 'POOL' ocean|`|mK06dus9aa	a tidal inlet or creek    and actually Washington may have a very similar meaning - oviously the president - but the name come from the description of a place as being a town on low ground near a tidal creek or "wash"|`|nGkCWpRVaa	maybe everyone is wet|`|kOrYXVedaa	It means nothing.just a name,like Washington DC

Maryse came into the WWE as a model, she learned what she knows while she was in the WWE. Beth has been training for most of her life. She is truly passionate about the buisiness and seriously works her *** off to stay at the top. She's in amazing shape, she's a true dominant diva. I've heard that she's amazing with the fans too. Beth is extremely powerful but is also agile and quick in the ring. Her capers with Santino are hillarious, the way she dropped him whe she found outthatshe won the Diva of the Year award, which by the way, she deserved. Beth is one of my favourite Divas ever, she (Like Maryse) shows that you can look great and be an amazing wrestler at the same time. She's had some great matches in OVW too, where she did a lot of her training. Don't get me wrong, Maryse is a great champion and she has a lot of skill, but Beth Phoenix is better any day in my books.|`|VQlrQ34Faa	Maryse|`|4tvI9WYjaa	maryse is the best diva on smack down and beth is the best diva on raw but maryse is the best diva current|`|bBHlGs5waa	Beth, definitely.|`|3z5gicSLaa	well beth is much stronger but i think that maryse could win i mean triple h won agains the great khali but they both dominate on their brands

Chris jericho was beleived to be facing mickie rourke at wrestlemania !  mike knox wwe probably wnt c dat potential in him yet!

Kane- ?? not sure bou kane!!|`|VmoNpWddaa	I just hate how Undertaker is always in the Main Event now. I dont wanna see Edge vs Undertaker AGAIN!

4VdRmfwyaa	It's great.  You get to show off to all your friends and get bigger muscles than everyone else.|`|AA11686626	Mens Gymnastics is a great sport.  Gymnastics as a whole creates the best "balanced" athletes with strength, agility, and flexibility.  I love watching Men's gymnastics, because the skills are just so huge and incredible.  To think that someone has the ability to flip and twist, land and punch, flip and twist again is amazing.  I also think the combination of physical and mental ability is incredible.  The fear factor that has to be worked through and the progressions to get a skill is intense, but the sense of accomplishment upon learning a skill is so worth it!    Floor, vault, and high bar are my favorites, but I appreciate the strength of rings.  Still trying to get the concept of Pommel Horse.  Whoever decided to strap pommels on a vaulting horse and swing with weight supported on the hands is a little twisted.|`|a38b329d2da34b6cfb1a2520ac0b7aefaa	Depends on what you are born with I guess!

b60b0deda80ed7906a1e090ee0a071e2aa	Without a doubt, anybody who doubts what you just said is just being a cry baby, because they made their favorite team look like a bunch of little girls.  They have never been controlled.  Every time that defense steps on the field, I guarantee they make 11 upset stomaches.  And no I am not a Ravens fan, but no sane person can doubt their greatness.|`|yAw4H5dnaa	No, I don't think their feared but they are good. The true scary defense would be a healthy bears squad.  I would have love to see what they would have accomplished this season. Meaning, the numbers they would have put up and records they would have broken. Their defense took them all they way to the super bowl. Don't forget that. And anyone who tries to tell me their schedule was too easy. Take a look at Baltimore's. I didn't see to many teams with winning records. And don't dare compare them to any 80's teams. Those teams were legendary.|`|jpWtZUEqaa	Yes. No defense has been as good as they have for as long as they have. Even last year when they went 6-10, offenses were afraid to play them. If you doubt that they are to be feared  just talk to Big Ben, he can tell you some horror stories.|`|lWBpkhgNaa	Not the last decade but the Ravens do have the best defence in the NFL for the last 5 years. and the best is usually the most feared. So the answer is No (for the time span) . BUT it is also yes (for the most feared).|`|Ff0obt6maa	No...The most feared this past season, yes.  But for the last ten years, the defense that has been consistently feared, year after year, has to be the Bucs.  They finished in the top ten every year except this one, with playmakers at every position and a roster full of potential Hall of Famers. They had the speed to shut down Michael Vick's running game when no one else had figured him out yet.  They demolished the Raiders  1 offense in the Superbowl with 4 interceptions. Other teams have had a few years of great defense, but over the last decade the Bucs are the only choice.|`|adb2ca04e6d4528745a3ebf1ff15b72daa	Oh yes, and I dont think its close. The defense this year may have even been better than the Super Bowl edition a few years back. They came out and tore up the colts and didnt allow a single TD and they still lost .... I still can't believe that happened.     Oh yeah, McNair simply flopped in that game.     But back to the question, the Raven's D is on par with the Bears and Giants of the 1980s and Steelers of the 1970s and .|`|bffe05b813a6d5248ebf57407160d97baa	To the idiots that put that they are on the same class as the 70's Steelers, YOU ARE STUPID!! Until almost half of the Ravens Defense gets voted into the Hall of Fame, they are nowhere near as good as the Steel Curtain. If you try to compare Haloti Nata( or however you say it) and Adalius Thomas to guys like Mean Joe Green and Jack Lambert. To answer the question yes although they have had years where there were better defenses(the Steelers 2005, Patriots-year before that)|`|OBsYU0NFaa	No.  The Steelers.|`|ed56ee40ff6a2e059c5131d4d244601baa	Feared... I don't think so.   Strongest... It could be.  .|`|3CJZRmElaa	Not hardly.|`|AA10103147	They didn't put much fear in the Colts.    Seriously, it's either them or the Tampa D under Dungy.|`|7e632a04dd178e071e54add9fb9eb945aa	Not even close. The Giants (when healthy) are far more scary. The Bears are even scarier.

He's also played for Standard Liege (twice), Schalke, Mouscron, KV Kortrijk & Hamburger SV. He's frequently injured too. He has a brother called Mbo.     http://home.skysports.com/player.aspx?pl...    He cant be any worse than Corradi, Samaras & Dickov - can he?|`|fabc6981fb31665c38e28ad3cd2f790daa	you could find him in here....    http://www.mcfc.co.uk/default.sps?pagegi...|`|Hqh13B6qaa	I think it is Hugh Jarse|`|7381d213f981d5ac210f86006d5ec8ccaa	Yeah hes from Belgium (whose nickname funnily enough is the red devils!!!! :D )    Looks to be a fairly solid player - was one of the top players in Germany in the late 90's.     He's still not that old and to be honest even if he can hit 1 in5 he's probably a better prospect than Corradi or Dickov who are both quite a bit older.    I'm just a bit worried about the fact that he gets injured a lot, and apparently he's owned by a management company in london - which is why blackburn didn't sign him in january|`|5c80f9515de4e37e9f5005b7e88314c8aa	From the other answers he sounds a waste of time.Plenty of injuries and quite a few clubs.|`|JRlRPyqCaa	no sorry|`|ixFBYkKhaa	emile mpenza. he used to have quality stats on championship manager 01 - 02 but never lived up to his potential whenever is signed him.

I always liked them. They need the light blue pants back and the player's number under the lightning bold and it'll be just like when John Hadl and Lance Allworth played!|`|9vq0oSD2aa	That's because this was asked a few months ago when they unveiled it. Personally, I liked the old ones better, especially the font of the numbers.    Cheers!|`|KSsgEdlmaa	The uniform itself I don't care about one way or the other, but I definitely think the white helmets look better than those midnight blue ones they used to wear.|`|2no9LHZBaa	i guess they look pretty good   But i love the powder blue

JUKvZgiIaa	Well no cruiser weight should be pushed to win the world heavy weight title. they should stay in their on division    Isn't Beniot a heavy weight he around 220  but Rey he 170 and he 5,6... there is diva's taller than rey maybe its his height..|`|C0ye0p3naa	Yes, (as i said in the e-mail). I thought it sucked for the simple reason that hes cruiserweight, not JUST cruiserweight about 70 pounds away from 'heavyweight' Chavo could put that on in a week .... wolla ... no problem at all. However, Rey merchadise seems to sell - his crappy t-shirts,etc and that f*cking mask of his p!$$e$ me off. Chavo hasnt got any merchadise so Vince 'benifits from' pushing Rey and the 'underdog' stroyline|`|0c94b546c337f60e4e94fbbfaf76006baa	Don't get me wrong, I'm a Rey Mysterio fan but I never thought he was World Championship material. I definitely thought he deserved the Cruiserweight Championship. Same for Chavo. In my opinion, why have different divisions if you can go for any of them.|`|AA12373016	Kind of since he needs to carry the Guerrero legacy!!! But, Rey made a way better champ!!!!

ZeN4IEVPaa	Lance Hoyt,The Big Texan.Heck yeah,he's probably one of the most underated guys in wrestling.He is I guess 6'9 and does moonsualts and dropkicks.Last I heard,he won a title in some independent promotion that TNA allows them to work.So he might come back soon.He was teaming with The Truth on TNA last, so tag titles maybe.|`|0c94b546c337f60e4e94fbbfaf76006baa	Haven't seen him lately but he is still listed as a TNA superstar.|`|73ae2aa599d5394fc4df8f95be5496efaa	right now he is just backing up VKM. It would seems that they don't have any good angles for him right now.|`|15eaddd8b8b69fba6f07c8adb9eb49f8aa	He's being misused. The WWEers are getting all the tv time. Hoyt was awesome back in the day. Hopefully he joins forces with Killings again. That was sick.|`|BrTWWxlDaa	im wondering what happened to him too|`|hLANDgFaaa	he has wrestled lately but your right he does need a push and it's taking forever for them to give it to him|`|0c9a8d9b547cd236db5ea20384275919aa	thats not a person..thats what you do to your hoyt when you have a boil on it....you lance hoyt...|`|Zt5k2bg6aa	I'd rather have him Christian's body guard than Tomko. But, honestly TNA won't give him any spot but a jobber sadly. But I love Hoyt-A-Mania haha.|`|OhOMOzGvaa	Yeah he was like TNA's Test
OWvVtgTWaa	dude im not and undertaker will get his day again probably around armegeddon and besides he aint gonna sit out as long as the doctors say he'll be back in like half the time and edge is the biggest poon out there lets wait for like three wrestlers to take down taker and see what happens.. i wish edge would get the **** beat out of him and undertaker will come back and reclaim what rightfully is his|`|f3586d5e0985f6e9f0447a70215d2b84aa	I'm glad.

Of course i wanted undertaker.|`|3fcI0lijaa	That is the only way Edge could have beat the Undertaker. Compared to the Undertaker Edge does'nt even exist in wrestling. There is no way that anyone can compare the strenght of Edge to the Undertaker. Undertaker is better in every possible way.Edge only wins by cheating. They should demote Edge  to a jobber. I would like to see Undrtaker make Edge R.I.P.|`|b431fc634e0dad4a5767526148ce11f0aa	I guess I kinda am because 'Taker's injured and i'd rather see him lose the title after a fight than by just giving it up (ala Batista)    But I'd've rather it'd been someone like Chris Benoit that took the title from him|`|yjoC0Uetaa	I really hate that Undertaker couldn't have a long title reign. I have to say i was looking forward to the dead man's era. But since he got injured i think that Edge was the best choice to be the next World Champion.|`|AA10594283	Why the hell did the WWE think that having Edge take the title from somebody that is actually liked (Undertaker) is better than taking it off someone that is boo'd everywhere he goes and has mold growing on his title because he's had it way to damn long (The man who makes 16 year olds cream in thier pants, Cena)?  What a rip off.  I want my money back.|`|90Hudo9Faa	im not,  i reckon kane should beat edge next edge  should lose it a judgement day|`|AA11765500	Vince loves Edge. Thats all!    On the other hand, if you look at Undertaker's history....he never got what he deserved (compared to titles)...but still he has lots of fan =)|`|WhkuO8jFaa	edge is a ******* cheater he would probably let mark henry beat  the **** out of the womens champ then fight fair & square taker will kick his *** and take his title back without breaking a sweat so can you dig that SUCKA

Even though I am a Ranger fan, I want DP to be okay, a good young cocky goaltender makes the rivalry fun.|`|62df3239f5809bb4f76bab5956c951ddaa	I'm not sure, but I was very happy to see the Islanders win toady as well. I hate the Leafs more than any other team so I wanted them out bad. I have been cheering the Islanders for weeks to get that last spot. I feel if Rick DiPietro was healthy all year, they would have made the playoffs for sure without such a close race at the end. That's the main reason I was cheering for them, I would normally route for a fellow Canadian team like Montreal, but not this year. I feel the Islanders deserved the spot. Montreal and Toronto are pretty bad teams this year really, the Islanders are getting better again and that's good to see. I loved and remember the early 80's dynasty very much. Al Arbour was a genius, one of the greatest coaches ever. Nolan's good too! And man Bossy could just flat out score, that team was awesome. Those days are my first hockey memories, '82 they beat my Canucks 4 str8 in the finals, ouch! That hurt, but they deserved it. I liked them so much back then, I still have a little Islanders jersey that would only fit on a kid about 7 or 8 hahaha! Glad to see the Islanders back on the up swing! Nolan is good for them and so is Rick DiPietro for sure! I espect to see them with an even better year next year. Peace! GO CANUCKS!!!    I'm picking a Sabres Cup victory by the way. Whoever gets out of the west is gonna be hurting this year and I don't see anyone beating Buff in the east except maybe Ottawa if they get a lot of breaks. It would be a small miracle though. This Buff team is the real deal!!!    1.Ducks  2.Canucks  3.Sharks   Are the sleeper picks but it shall be though.    Penguins have no chance! My advice to anyone, don't bet Pittsburg. They are going out, and they may even go real early. I don't see them beating Ottawa. Not gonna happen!|`|08600caaf7133f77999e8abe4dc781dcaa	i don`t think he is going to make it back. even with him you guys will get beat down by buff...but hey at least you go there un like my team...the yotes|`|9f3703cabede7b9cdc05e7f7123be1fcaa	yea DP might return in the play-offs and if he does hes going right in...in the mean time im loving Dubie      LETS GO ISLANDERS!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|b5acdda75abbcaeea62367009255e864aa	I follow the islanders alot and i heard that if the islanders make the playoffs they will revisit the thought but the medical staff thinks dipietro will be out for the season. but i think we  can pull it off with dubie hes on fire now. i agree with u the score should of been 2-1 . this is why i hat e jjohn madden    LETS GO ISLANDERS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

AA12170560	Why don't you take three steps back and play free safety ??  I think thats a great idea.    A Nickleback or "Monster" (FS) position is ideally suited to a smaller, faster linebacker types.    On my 360 page is a friend that coachs at 2 levels and plays "down under". We share the same last name...sort of...you are welcome to contact him.    Good luck|`|a0223cb90091117bae34fe4ba8dec364aa	Left out.|`|AA11353775	I was about your wt, a tad shorter, I found that the best position for me was "Defensive Tackle", you're in just the right spot, you can use your hands to push through the offensive line, and if you're fast enough out of the "HOLE",  and bust through the line like a "Runaway Truck", you,ll get to see that frightened look on the quarterback as you close in on him, or be able to grab the ball, or jam up the ball runner, or grab the ball runner, you will always be in on the action. "Safety" requires long running, and more coverage, and you may, or may NOT be involved in the play, "Defensive tackle" is almost ALWAYS involved in the "PLAY" !|`|XRzQzWGvaa	Safety or cornerback sound like a good position for you to play.  Just make sure if the weight you are gaining that you keep training to stay fast.|`|AA10103147	It's tricky to gain muscle weight and maintain speed and agility. You should find a weight that is easy to maintain and work out. At your age you could have more growing to do and may find that you become more guided by that factor. Talk to your coaches about this. Most coaches know what guys work best at the positions.     If you are fast and hit hard, then safety is a great position. You are a good size for that right now. Safety is a blast to play. You make a good sized safety for your age and if you like to hit could make a difference for your team.|`|eaa995a74163353b5eb63f3e0dc2b680aa	I was exactly your size when I played football in Highschool.  I played safety(rather well) and cornerback (not so great with coverage 1 on 1).  You get to make some nice hits at both positions, but I found safety easier to play and more fun as well.  I had to much to think about when I played corner.  Much of your decision should center around the type of defense your team is running, but I enjoyed safety overall.|`|h4vzQCPbaa	Size doesn't play 100% in positions, now a days you need to understand the game and the position you will be playing. I was the exact same height and weight in High School when I played. I would suggest an outside linebacker (more of a contain guy) or dropping back into a FS position.   About the building speed while gaining weight... do it at the same time. Muscle weighs more than fat does, so you could easily trim the body up while gaining speed and weight. I would suggest working primarily on the quads, hams and calves... strong hams ensure a lower chance of lower body injuries, while working calves will give you that explosive boost you need to be quick. Building your quads will allow you to build speed off the quick starts, but ultimately... work on your calves and hams. This will allow you to start and stop quickly, which you will need in a game situation.   Work specific work-outs you could do.... ask your coach or even go down to a local gym and ask the trainer what they would suggest.
AA12170560	No, it's not too late.    You will develope as you go.    Small story - Dave Mallow played basketball for 4 years in college. He found out he could play an additional 5th year of collegiate sports.  He picked football because it seemed cool: he had never played before.  He played one season his whole life...went to the Pittsburg Steelers in 1990 right after he graduated.|`|AA10409668	It all depends.  The problem is that other players are well ahead of you when it comes to certain things you should already know.  If you're willing to work hard and not get discouraged with constructive criticism, then yes, I think you can do it.|`|1c968sQbaa	NO It's never to late, I started playing my 9th grade year, I'm a sophomore right now BTW and I was good before I started but I improved over one season so much it's unbelievable, start ASAP or dont start at all... But the other guys are right it's more than catching, running, throwing and everything.... You gotta know a playbook, all the audibles everything, it's hard work, it's a big committment but pays off in the end... I'm a tail back what position do you wanna try for?|`|1mHegHWXaa	No it is definatly not too late.. Get out there and get started !    You might not start right away, it takes time to learn the plays, develop playing strength etc but you are only a freshman.    I suggest you hit the weights REALLY hard and focus on eating lean protiens at every meal.  Also work on doing sprints to raise your speed and endurance.    Go to talk to the coach.. LIke tomarrow and tell him you want to play.. He'll give you the weight program and probably a running program.. follow it and you'll be starting in no time.|`|AA10103147	You should go out for the team is you think you have what it takes. Many guys don't have experience going into high school. Often, even if they did play some football, it was not at a very competitive level anyway. Be prepared to work hard. If the coach likes you, then you belong on the team!|`|WJLX0qAzaa	if you r a freshman in high school its not to late but u cant just jump right in and be a running back or whatever it will take a year or two for u to earn the starting spot. but get in the weight room. best of luck to u|`|45e4172936d12eedec5617fcc59e934aaa	there is alot more to it than just throw, catch, run. you have to learn a playbook and totally understand how the line opens holes and have a general understanding of how a play develops. also remember, running and in a t-shirt and shorts is alot different than in full equipment. now having said that, no, it is not too late for you to start. obviously, your friends who have played pee-wee, or pop Warner will have a edge over you, but that should not stop you from trying. playing football is truly a lifetime experience, so you should at least try it. it is something you will never forget. best of luck.|`|9803cd2f2ca0199527a535bafbe7c650aa	Im a captain of the varsity football team...and what i tell young cats that want to join is....JOIN....anytime u can...cauz the longer u wait...the harder u have to work....the game is getting your name out there wit the coaches....and then hitting the wieghts....the better the coaches kno u...the better chances you have of playing...join...and the skills will come with work|`|ec625cab7a0f2e7ce2313ce05a827f0baa	I believe most people start football in their freshman year.

9c196be0c59a24112a750a109c75a550aa	la cocaine et le cannabis je suis pas sur que ?a soit pr amliorer ces performances ...  aprs c sur qu'il y a de +en+ d'argent ds le rugby dc il risque d'y avoir de +en+ de tricheurs hlas|`|db392f14b9d9198f7a521d229fb93fb7aa	A la limite je me serais attendu  pire, dj, concernant le canabis je vois franchement pas pourquoi on met ?a dans les produits dopants, ce n'est pas le mme dbat  mon avis.    Les rugbymens n'ont pas encore trop les moyens de se procurer des produits dopants et vu le cadre encore un peu "famillial" des clubs de rugby cela risquerait de se voir, mais il est certain que cela doit tre pris en compte. la rflexion est sans doute plus li l'intensite des matchs et  leur rptition, un jouer ne devrait pas enchainer plus de 5 ou 6 matchs d'affils, un peu sur le principe des marathiniens qui n'ont pas le droit de courir polus de 5 ou 6 marathons par an (je sais pas le chiffre exact).|`|66c23b1eb7ea4cdd7ea04e9b166c7cafaa	Bah c'est toujours mieux que le dbut de saison (12 ou 13 cas de positifs), mais ce n'est que la face cache, les controles n'tant pas encore trop nombreux et tant prvus. Dans un sens c'est peut tre pas plus mal, la lutte contre le dopage se retourne vite contre ceux qui l'ont lance, tant que rien n'est fait ?a vitera que le rugby soit trait de sport de dops, on voit ce que ?a a donn avec le cyclisme, mme si l le dopage tait plus important. Il faudra attendre que les autres sports les plus touchs se mettent eux aussi  lutter.      En attendant je tiens quand mme a prciser que la THC, ainsi que la cocaine et autres drogues du mme genre sont des produits qui ont un effet anesthsique sur la douleur, en consquent ce sont bels et bien des produits dopants et que les effets peuvent tre plus graves que ceux provoqus par d'autres produits  cours terme. Ensuite je rapelle aux mmes qui pensent qu'il n'y a pas de dopage dans le rugby que la cratine y est autorise, hors ce produit est class sur la liste des produits dopants... Enfin, des produits tels que la testostrone ne sont pas dtectables aux premiers tests des contr?les anti-dopages s'ils sont administrs en faible dose et ne peuvent tre reprs qu'aprs le second test (Landis est d'ailleurs positif sur une dizaine de tests, ce qui n'avais pu tre vu la premire fois).|`|PQAtenbAaa	et chabal?il etait positif  la chair humaine?|`|uBcbHjOVaa	qu'est-ce que vous avez contre le dopage ? le but c'est de gagner, non ? alors laissez-nous nous doper tranquillement.|`|n4QgkZY0aa	yen a quasiment pas qui se dopent ! cest comme dans le foot, yen a 3 qui se dopent et pui voila on dit que tt le monde se dopent !  dans le rugby j'ai entendu comme cas de dopage Saylor (aillier des wallabies et des warathas) et quelque anglais de 2003 (lewsey, wilkinhson et quelques autres) mais Jason Robinson et lawrence Dallaglio ne sont pa dedans !|`|dvE3IlOZaa	Ta question est pertinente, nanmoins il faut faire une distinction importante entre les stups et les produits dopants.  C'est certain, on va se diriger vers des mesures de contr?les plus contraignantes. il faudra attendre la fin de la CdM (qui en tout tat de cause va soulever ce problme) et voir les nouvelles mesures qui seraient prises par la Fd.    ( juste un mot : j'avais pens qu'ici, dans cette rubrique 'Rugby' on trouverait seulement des vrais fans, je vois que l'on commence, nous aussi, par tre gangrn par certains Mickeys qui rpondent n'importe quoi......comme l'autre qui veut qu'on le laisse se doper !  Il faudrait qu'il vienne sur un stade se faire dcoller les oreilles !)|`|b7506e68988f3433e89685cc7c797aafaa	Dans certaines contres, je ne les nomerai pas,.... c'est du produit "cach", j'en suis plus que persuad en regardant les matchs internationnaux.|`|7FgmXE7Kaa	le dopage,le VRAI DOPAGE,c'est celui a l'epo,la cratine,l'hormone de croissance,la testosterone,les stroides...en france,il est extrement rare!!!!les pays anglo-saxons sont beaucoup plus concerns...  la cocaine,le cannabis et les autres drogues sont beaucoup plus dtectes,mais elles ne dopent pas rellement...Donc,il faut rester vigilant devant la menace du dopage,et ne pas se soucier des drogues car elles ne sont pas utilises a des fins dopantes...|`|aEIB0S6gaa	Comme il a dj t dit, il ne faut pas tout mlanger, la coca?ne et le cannabis ne sont pas des produits dopants, ce sont des drogues!    Pour ce qui est du dopage dans le rugby, bien s?r qu'il y en a et cel depuis plusieurs annes, en gros depuis le passage au professionnalisme. Le rugby devient un sport spectacle peu  peu et mme si c'est intressant par rapport au jeu qui y est propos, les cadences et la violence des chocs font que les joueurs ont besoin "d'aides" plus ou moins licites.    Mais contrairement  certains sports, en rugby, le dopage se concentre essentiellement sur 2 points: la prise de masse musculaire et la rcupration.  C'est pour cela que la cratine est trs prsente (surtout dans les pays anglophones) mais malheureusement pas seulement pour son action sur l'augmentation de la masse musculaire avec moins de travail et sur la rcupration plus rapide. La cratine est surtout reconnue pour tre un produit mascant, c'est--dire qu'un joueur positif  la cratine (qui est autorise  peu prs dans tous les pays qui sont les nations majeures du rugby, hors-mis en France) l'est s?rement pour ne pas tre positif  d'autres substances beaucoup plus dopantes mais aussi beaucoup plus dangereuses...
