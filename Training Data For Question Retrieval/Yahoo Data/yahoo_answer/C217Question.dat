I treated her hair, combed out the nits, sprayed the furniture, swept the floor, washed the clothes, blankets, and bagged the toys.        Now I go to the school today and  at least 50 kids were lined up in the hallway. I asked my daughter what grade it was and she says all grades those are the kids that have lice and are being sent home.  There were 2 kids from her class in that line. I rechecked my daughters hair and found nothing. I would like to know of any preventive things that work?

My husband and I started trying to ease into having sex about 5 weeks postpartum. I can not tell you how much it hurts! I had an episiotimy, and at my 6 week checkup, he said all was healed. We can have sex whenever and as often as we like. Easy for him to say.   I don't hurt from the insision, but rather from the inside. When he goes in, it feels like a grinding. And when he pulls out, it feels like he is pulling out my insides. And if he goes slow, I can feel, notch by notch, him pulling out. It really hurts!   My doctor said that my pelvic floor muscle was loose. And he showed my husband how to help me excersie it. But I'm really so scared now, to mess with anything down there, cause of the pain.   Has anyone gone through this, that can tell me how to solve this?

Instead of giving a baby up for adoption, and especially instead of an abortion, is it possible for someone, say me, didn't want the baby, but one of my friends did, so could i sign the baby up under her name, and when i give birth and feed the baby till he/she doesn't need breast milk anymore, could i give the baby to her legally?

20090226161349AAGhAbI	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Are Vick's Vaporub and antihistimines (nyquil) safe during pregnancy?	The Vaporub says to "consult a doctor" but thats usually just a disclaimer to cover their asses. While I fully intend to ask my doctor when I see her, I could really use some relief from my sinusitis right now and I'm not sure if antihistamines are safe, so I figured that was my best bet.      Oh, my Nyquil (which contains an antihistimine) doesn't say anything about being pregnant, has anyone had their doctor tell them that this is safe during pregnancy? I have dayquil too but that doesn't have the antihistimine which is what I need (I have recurring sinusitis). Also, I tried nasal spray and it made me throw up. Great.      I avoid drugs (anything, even tylenol or ibuprofen) during pregnancy, but I know from experience that my sinusitis can quickly get out of control.

I have given many teen moms advice and tried to make them take full responsibility for a baby instead of aborting them.   *I just wanted to know what is like being a mom as an adolescent. *Why did you have unprotected sex?    *If not why did you have sex at all? Is the father of your child or (children) taking full responsibility also?   *I just wonder... WHAT CAUSED ALL OF THIS?

20090226164435AAERoni	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	As many people answer this as possible please? good responses too thank you.?	ok so we are 14 years old and freshman in high school. the question is..Does he like me? So far he has tapped my shoulder 4 times , the opposite one so I didn't know it was him till like the 3rd time. Also he doesn't know me, cause were not in the same classes. He is not doing this when his friends are around. Then another day as i walking, he said to me "why are you looking at my butt". I just laughed. bad idea I shouldn't have. Lastly about 2 days ago, I saw one of his friends sorta signaling me(i am pretty sure like pointing at me)Not gonna lie i think he is cute, but I don't know what is wrong with me. I am pretty sure he likes me, I just don't know why I am so scared to do SOMETHING. so basically the question is: Does he like me? and Should I do something like poke him on the shoulder or something?thanks peeps.

20090226165043AAwZeKo	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	What are the chances of Plan B failing, if used "properly"?	Here are the details-   I took Plan B about 8 or 9 hours after unprotected sex. (January 7th)   My last period was December 26th.      It was the middle of February when I finally stopped and thought I hadn't had a period yet, and I didn't have one the whole month of January.       I asked my sister she said she didn't remember me having one either.   She told me to ask my sister-in-law if she had any pregnancy tests.   She didn't, so she took me to the doctors to take one there.   I couldn't pee at alll.. So I sat at the sink drinking cup after cup of water.      Eventually after an hour I peed enough.. lol      I got the test back, it was negative.      But... its been two months exactly since I've had a period.   I'm having light cramps like I'm going to start.. But nothing! nadda. No spotting, anything.    Extreme nausea, and light-headiness. All I can do is lay in bed all day. I've eaten, I've drank water, and tried to lay down/sleep. But it wont go away.      Although, I'm not peeing a whole lot. Barely at all, actually.       I don't know...   I just want someone's opinion, thoughts, advice.   I'm clueless

My 21 month old son was just getting over an ear infection and yesterday he was completely fine, eating great,playing, happy.  Today I got a call from the sitter saying he kept puking and wouldn't eat or stop crying.  I picked him up but brought him home to see how he was acting, not himself...he gagged a couple of times but wouldn't puke it up he just swallowed it.  He's been sick on and off since Dec. 14th.  He's been to the dr. like 10 times since then and the hospital once when he stayed two nights they said he had pnemonia, bronchitis, stomach flu and plus his stool was backed up.  He never really got better, got a cough again took him to dr....he said it was a cold, then he ended up getting an ear infection and I thought he was finally getting better the last couple days.  I don't know what's going on but I'm taking him to a different dr. that's suppose to be really good tomorrow so hopefully I'll find some answers.  Since December he's puked a lot on and off, had a few fevers the highest was 102, he's had diarrea ALOT on and off.  Today he hasn't ate one thing, I'm trying to get him to at least drink but he's been sleeping for the last few hours on and off.  I'm so worried about him, but I don't want to take him to our hospital (It sucks here, they didn't do anything to really help him last time) His new dr. is out of town.  Anyone had anything like this happen to their child and get any answers?  I know I'm taking him to the dr. tomorrow but I'm just so curious to find out and I know there are so many things it could be.

20090226175850AALTybo	Pregnancy & Parenting;Baby Names	Looking for a girls name that will fit?	I am working on developing my main character, and I am looking for the perfect name. Here is a short description.      She has straight, dark red hair, and a sprinkle of freckles across the bridge of her nose. Her lips are full, and her eyes are a pool of shimmering blue. She has thin eyebrows. She is a little bit shorter than average - about five feet and five inches tall. She is slim, but not muscular.       She is kind and responsible, but she always has a witty comeback up her sleeve. She is considered popular, mainly because of her personality, but partly because of her beauty. She isn't beautiful in the generally stereotyped way, but she is popular among the guys. (She seems responsible on the outside, until you get to know her. Her train of thought is reckless, but in life she acts responsibly because her friends are more reckless than she is.)      Does anyone have a name that jumps out at you that seems fitting for this character? First and/or last names would be greatly appreciated.

I have had chronic high blood pressure since I was 17 and has been under control very well ever since then with medication.   I have been with my husband for 7 years and we really want to start trying for a baby. I have not talked to my doctor about this yet and I was just wandering if anyone else can relate to what I am going through. Any advice? Do you think I will be ok to have a baby???
20090225115938AAaEyP5	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Please ladies give me advice!?	I am 22 and i already have 2 daughters, one is 7 weeks old.  I might be pregnant again, I took a blood pregnancy test yesterday now am just waiting for the results.   I don't want any more kids PERIOD. I really just wanted one.  So i was thinking about having a abortion, which kills me inside.  I do have the luck of having a wonderful man by my side.  We are stable, emotionally and economically.  The only thing is he wanted are second daughter which I honestly didn't want at all.  I know that sound mean but am 22 and I just wanted to wait a little longer for our family to grow more.  We have a home, which we barley moved into 4 months ago, but having another child will break us.  We cant afford another child.  I don't want to adopt because once I have the child hell i wont be able to let go of him or her.  I know that for a fact.  I have a heart and it is killing me to think I want to get a  abortion.  We used the pull out method and well it might have not worked at all.    Please I am a emotional disaster.     I know it is my decisions but just let me know what would you do.   My oldest is 3 and my little one is 7 weeks

I suffer from post natal depression and have done on and off for 17 months and a symptom of this is that i consistently tell myself i am a bad mother and no one can convince me otherwise no matter how many times they tell me.      Well i was just in the kitchen with my 17 month old DD and we were cooking up a storm making past bake for dinner, fritatta's for lunch and cutting shapes out of bread and dipping them in finely grated cheese and gobbling them up, then when everything was in the oven i got ALL of the pot lids out and we had a jam session yelling and singing and all of a sudden i thought "WOW i am a good mum" and felt like a weight had been lifted off my shoulders it was unreal.......im wondering if any other mothers have had that sort of a moment?

20090226171302AAL61Cr	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	How to help a 4 year old grieve?	My dad passed away last Friday, the services were on Tuesday. My 4 year old son is taking it very hard. I told him that my dad had been sick for a really long time and that his body couldn't take it anymore. I also explained to him about souls and heaven (we are Christian). At the visitation, he was busy playing with his cousins and seemed to be fine. The funeral was a military funeral and he was preoccupied with counting the guns for the 21 salute. After the funeral, however he has been yelling at me and his 3 year old sister, crying over everything, and refuses to throw anything away. He was obsessive-compulsive beforehand. I don't want to take him to a child psychiatrist just yet (I'm hoping he will calm down).       I'm really hoping to get answers from people who have helped a young child cope with the death of a loved one. If you are going to answer by bashing my religious beliefs, don't bother yourself....I will report those answers.      Thank you.

20090226172502AAKoQva	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Few questions about my baby spitting up?	Im gonna call doctors tomarrow but heres story.  I am just looking for advice or tips. My baby is 5 months. Wes started him on formula at 4 months due to no weight gain. He has always been spitting up a little but not a ton. We gave him Enfamil and he did good on that then I found out wic only paid for goodstart they said goodstart with cultures too so I gave him that, and I remember him doing good I don't remember much spitting up-now he is on the regular goodstart because they wouldn't give with cultures unless he couldn't handle the regular but he spits up A TON I didn't put two and two together until my husband pointed it out, he drinks 6oz and spits up at least 1-2 oz each feeding. He is happy otherwise just spits up everytime he lays to play or you pick him up.  I am not sure how much is normal. I sent my husband out to get the formula that I know he was ok on but the wic lady said the natural cultures and regular were the same except for the cultures and theres no reason he'd need one over the other? does that make sense?

20090226174924AApRALn	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	I think I may have ADD and I'm wondering how I talk to my parents about it?	I'm not going to go into the details, but I think I may have ADD or ADHD. I mean, I have trouble concentrating, completing tasks, getting motivation to do anything, and I do this weird thing where I count every step I take in fours (1,2,3,4,1,2,3,4...). I'm exceptionally smart, but it doesn't show in my grades. I make these careless mistakes, and I can never remember anything, small or big. For some reason, I can't sit still to do homework or school work. My parents and friends remind me of things I can't remember agreeing to, but they swear that I had. I'm beyond creative (draw, write, play music; I do it all).    Anyways, the point of this question isn't to ask you if I have it. I want to know how I start this conversation with my parents. I get very emotional when I try to talk to them about something as upsetting as this. How can I talk to this about them, or is there another way I can let them know so I don't cry in front of them?      And also, I was diagnosed with Chronic Gastritis and my doctor said to start some sort of stress management. I think worrying about this and doing my best to pay attention is causing more stress on me, and I'm trying to eliminate that.      And don't say it's because I'm a teenager, or because "I want to be sick." First of all, that's stupid. Secondly, people like to use "being a teenager" as illness itself when you could be hurting someone who really needs help. I'm 15.

20090226173057AA6sMH9	Pregnancy & Parenting;Grade-Schooler	Do you like the beginning of the story my thirteen-year-old daughter wrote?	My brother is a genius.    Most people don’t believe me when I say that. They call me delusional, but I know better. And if you think I’m making it up, ask my mom or my dad.    The average person’s IQ is 100. If you have an IQ over 150, you’re automatically a genius. Matthew’s IQ is 184.    Matthew’s my little brother. He’s seven – three years younger than me, and we’re best friends. He’s memorized every Fibonacci number up to 12 586 269 025 and every prime number up to 3 125 672 873. He can do a hundred piece puzzle in four minutes and thirty-eight seconds. I know because when I was eight and he was five, I gave him my hundred piece Beauty and the Beast puzzle to look at and timed him as he put it together.    My brother is better at math than anyone I know, including my teacher. Sometimes I have him “help” me with my math homework, because he’s even better than a calculator. I’ve tried really hard equations with him like 256 x 397 and without a moment’s hesitation, he replied, “101 632.” And even with questions on my math sheet that had me stumped, like 789 2 (we were supposed to multiply it out, but why should I bother when I have Matthew, a.k.a. the human calculator, here to help me?), and he didn’t have to think for a moment before telling me the answer was 622 521.    I’m the only one who really understands my brother. He doesn’t speak – he’s never in his entire life said a single word, other than when he hums or answers mathematical equations. That drives my parents crazy – at first they thought he was doing it deliberately, but after awhile they accepted that something was seriously wrong and switched gears so fast it made my head spin. In its own way, that was even worse. My parents put Matthew into a million different therapies, mostly speech therapies. They convinced themselves that something was wrong with what they were doing, and set out to “fix” him and make him “normal”.    But not me. I accept my brother for who he is, and understand him better than anyone else does in the whole wide world.    One time when Matthew was six, he was filling out a multiple choice math sheet in class – easy questions like 4 + 5 and 7 – 3. There were forty of them, and he got every single one wrong.    There was no doubt in anyone’s mind that he’d done it on purpose. As his teacher put it, “If I actually believed that Matthew didn’t know the answers and merely guessed randomly, theoretically he would have still got between eight and twelve questions right. But he didn’t get any correct. Not a single one.”    No one understood why he’d done it. They drove themselves crazy trying to wrap their heads around it – was he rebelling against them? Had something gone wrong? Was this some kind of insane thing geniuses did?    It was somewhat amusing to watch them fumble around for an answer, actually. Only I understood, floating obliviously above the chaos, watching from up high. With my brother, sometimes there is no “logical” reasoning behind the things he does. Matthew tends to follow his heart rather than his head, and this was just another example. To him – and to me – it made perfect sense; he got all those questions wrong to prove he could. He was experimenting and testing boundaries in his own way, as all young children do. Matthew was so used to easily acing math tests that he wanted to see what would happen if, for once, he didn’t.    Another time, when Matthew was five and I was eight, we were at the lake. Our dad gave us permission to hike for a bit by ourselves as long as we didn’t get too close to the water and stayed together.    Matt and I went for a walk in the woodsy area, which wasn’t quite a forest but could have easily been mistaken for one. I didn’t let go of Matthew’s hand, even as I climbed up the gigantic jagged rocks with edges as sharp as broken glass and he scrambled up after me.    Then we came to the old abandoned pirate ship. It actually wasn’t a pirate ship, just an old canoe, but I had a very vivid imagination and made believe it was special and that it was a pirate ship. Matt always just went along with me.    I let go of my brother’s hand for just a minute. I jumped down from the rock at the boat, turning back to my brother and yelling to him to stay where he was. I didn’t know how safe this area was, and figured if one of us was going to get hurt, better it be me than Matthew.    I took one step on the curved boulder, then another, carefully balancing so as not to fall into the swirling, wild waters below. I took a third step and a fourth, and then – I lost my footing! I slipped and tumbled into the deep, icy waters.    Struggling to float and gasping for air, I screamed. Panicking, splashing around wildly, I prayed that someone would come save me before I drowned. Even though I knew how to swim, I wasn’t particularly adept, and especially not in raging waters as cold and deep as this one.    And in that one second after I screamed, Matthew jumped off his safe rock into the rough, uncertain waters. My

20090226171401AAHQraD	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Baby has sores from sucking fingers?	Hi! So, I have a 6 month old little girl who absolutely won't touch a pacifier (We've tried!!), but loves sucking her fingers. It's a little messy, but for the post part I don't mind this habit. A couple of days ago, I noticed a red area on the finger she sucks on most, and yesterday there seemed to be a blister (more like a blood blister than your typical whitish blister!), and today it's, I guess opened (as in the skin is broken). It doesn't seem to bother her, but I am worried about a possible infection, and besides, it looks horrible! Has anyone had a baby who sucked his or her fingers so much that they got a sore? I have no idea what I should do for it (I figure a band-aid would be a choking hazard)! Any ideas? Thanks a million!

20090226180309AAWECJk	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	What is the chance I am pregnant? serisous answers please...i need advice...*best answer*?	Ok So a few days after Christmas I had unprotected sex. It was off and on for about 45 minutes, more or less, and I'm going to be blunt, he did not get off inside of me, it was about 15-20 seconds after he pulled out.     In November, I had my period on the 7th. In December I had it on the 9th. Right around New Years, my fiance and I split up and I was stressed, but I didnt think it was enough stress to mess with my period.  In Early Jan. I began to either throw up or dry heave EVERY time I brushed my teeth.  I finally got my period on January 24th. It was kind of light, but only lasted for 3 days tops.  Between last month and this month, my bloating did not go away.    This month, I did not start until last night and it is an odd color. Kind of bright red. The past two months, my stomach has hurt like crazy.  I never got cramps before.  I just took my first bath rather than a shower since and I feel so sick.    I have still been throwing up when brushing my teeth.  I am hungry all the time, but when I go to eat, I get this big lump in my throat and almost throw up: sometimes I do.    I have always gotten my period around the 11th.  And I thought that if it was stress, it would have been normal this month.  I still do not know how I could be sick like I have been if it was stress.   I did take a HPT. It was a cheap one.  The positive line was there at first, it was very faint, but when the test was complete, it had faded away.  I am going to TRY to get another, a better one tomorrow.    I would just like opinions on what you think.  Does my sickness, tiredness, etc sound like I am pregnant?

20090225121622AAtZWHO	Pregnancy & Parenting;Grade-Schooler	What are the judges looking for in a middle school cheerleader tryout?	My daughter will be trying out for our local middle school cheer squad next week.  This is the first year she has tried out, and also the first year they have allowed 5th graders to try out to cheer in 6th grade.  Until now it has only been a 7th and 8th grade team.   She is very excited and nervous at the same time.  Other than a youth cheer squad and a few gym/tumble classes, she has no real experience.  That is the norm for most of the girls, most of them dont even have that much experience.  So she is not ahead of or behind the flock.  She is on a pretty level playing field.   Anyway, they will spend 4 days in a clinic learning basics, a chant, a cheer, and a dance.  Then on Friday they will perform for the judges in small groups.     I have talked to one of the cheer sponsors, and she says they arent sure about numbers yet and that they plan to just stop at the natural drop in scores, which i completely agree with.   I am telling her to focus on sharpness, facials, and being loud.    I am also stressing to her that its no big deal if she doesnt make it, she will make new friends, gain more experience, have a good time, and there is always next year.   Any more tips or thoughts I should share with her?  Thanks!

According to ovulation calculators on here (I know they aren't always accurate), I should be ovulating. A few days ago I had went to the bathroom and wiped, I noticed a slimy brown discharge. The next day I noticed slimy brown discharge in my underwear (gross, sorry) and tonight hubby & I were having sex and when we were done, it was there again. I heard it was normal to get this during ovulation, but seriously, this much?? I've never had this sort of discharge while ovulating... I'm not sure if it'd be implantation, which I thought for a second it could be, but ah.. I don't know :( Any suggestions?

He's not a baby anymore but he's walking/running around everywhere.  He's very smart. I babysit him and sometimes I change into my pajamas around him (I'm 14).. i don't get naked or anything but at what age should I stop changing around him or tell him to close his eyes (which he doesn't know how to do yet). I never cared when he was only a year or so but now he starts to look at my bra and say "boobie" when he sees me change. and I noticed he's always touching his weewee when I change his diaper. how can i stop that? he always puts his hand back on it ...and I can't leave him alone in any room for any amount of time while I change. I don't want him to be looking for those things in girls (boobies) .. well I know he will someday when kids his age reach puberty but not while he's a young boy you know?   this also applies to when he can go in the boys bathroom alone when he's a little older instead of me taking him in the girl's rest room.. what age would be right?

We have been giving her some stage one foods but not regularly.

I had a c-section 7 weeks ago and after they took the catheter out, I developed a bad bladder infection. I was on Cipro for 3 weeks following the surgery. However, now I'm still bleeding from my urinary tract area and no one seems to know what's causing it. I think that when they pull the catheter out it could of scratched something up in there and caused a sore or something. Has anyone every had this happen? If so, what caused yours?

I have heard that your chances of conceiving again, after having carried a baby to full term, are increased.

I thought about it completely frantic and went to his friends house. There he was with his friend in the backyard, claiming that they had just come over to call me. What bugs me is he did not even wait 30 seconds which he usually does anyways. I KNOW he knows he should have stayed at the bus stop. I lectured him about it, but I need a punishment. He has been defiant the last week, and he knows that I always show up about thirty seconds after the bus stops.       What is a consequence for going MIA on me?

20090225120636AACdd0V	Pregnancy & Parenting;Grade-Schooler	Kids in schools getting cheese sandwich meals....?	I just read an article on MSNBC.com about a school district in New Mexico. Parents are angry that their children are being served cheese sandwiches, milk, and fruit, if they don't have lunch money. It says that with the economy these days, parents are not able to pay for school lunches, so instead of the normal "hot lunch" for purchase at school, children are getting the cheese sandwich meal. What is wrong with that? I don't see the problem! Especially when it's FREE!   People these days are so damn picky. My kids go to a daycare where I have to provide their lunch, which most often is a sandwich,sometimes without meat, and just cheese. They like it.  What are your opinions?

20090225121358AAnEE6J	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	Can raising a sibling's child be a mistake?	My husband and I are taking care of his sister's 10 yr old daughter. At the time, sister told us that she couldn't take care of her because she was too much of a hand full and she was either going to give us legal custody or put her in foster care. We of course said yes and our niece has been with us for 6 months. However, she is a complete monster. She's rude and disrespectful. My 2 1/2 yr old son beats her and doesn't like her. Its also come to a point where my husband and I don't like her. That's not fair to her, but its becoming hard to deal with. My niece's parents are no help what so ever and so we're dealing with this on our own. We want to send her back honestly, but I know that won't help. Therapy has not helped and other family members see what we see. Any advice?
20090226183027AAJiOs4	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	Want to read a joke my 14yr. old aspie wrote?	''License and Registration Please"      One morning when I was driving to the store, a red light stopped me. I turned off my engine and leaned back in my seat. I was the person in the very front of a line of traffic. I turned on the radio and rolled down all of the windows so everybody could hear the insaness of the heavy metal play full blast. People began to role up their windows and turn on their radios. The red light switched to green and about three seconds later, people in their vehicles started to honk their horns and curse through their windows. I just sat back and relaxed screaming out the words of the song ignoring the loud noised in the background. A siren from a police car sounded from the very back of the traffic making its way past the opposite lane. I pulled myself up in my seat and turned off the radio. I turned the engine back on and began to drive forward. Before I could even get past the line, the green light turned from a yellow to a red. I stopped and rolled up my windows. The siren got louder and louder as I held my left hand up to my face wiping the sweat off my forehead onto my pants. The siren stopped. In a slight releif, I sighed loudly and turned towards my window looking up at a man in a black uniform tapping on my window. I rolled down my window and these words echoed in my head as his mouth moved.,"License and Registration Please."      elizabeth writes all kinds of stories...she said that writing is something she does to avoid people...

I had sex on the 21st, 23rd and plan to on the 26th (tonight) and 27th.  I've always had little cramps during ovulation and had them yesterday (25th) and today.  What are my chances that I hit the jackpot this month??  I only missed the 22nd, 24th and 25th.

20090226184427AAYwOI4	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	What could be the reason my period is late?	I have had 2 miscarriages. The last one was about 6 months ago. My husband and I are trying to conceive. So I thought I would get on BC for a few months to see if it would help my body as far as getting pregnant again. I started the pill Ortho novum 2 months ago and this month I was only on it for 2 weeks.I missed a pill then missed again for 2 days,spotted every few days and decided to just try again to get pregnant so I stopped half way through the 3rd week. I usually bled for a couple weeks after I stop the pill, but haven't bled at all since the spotting(light only lasted for a day so). My period was due 4 days ago and never came.I took a test yesterday that said negative but I could only pee a little bit on it...to much info,I know lol  Could I be pregnant or did the pill just throw my cycle off?
20090226190758AAGitmi	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Did I miscarry? experts please*?	1. I have been to the doctors just waiting for results - wont get them for another week.   2. I know the symptoms could be a variety of things including: cervical cancer, some sort of tumour/lesion, or hormonal problems but this question is trying to rule out miscarriage.      story:  I normally have a 34ish day cycle but in January it lasted 40 days.  right before I expected to get my period (around day 32) I had unprotected sex (thinking I was far past ovulation date).  I didn't end up getting my period till day 40 (a saturday). I had a normal menstruation lasting 4 days. The following saturday I had sex and had spotting (bright red) afterwards. The spotting lasted a couple days, then it turned into a full menstruation again (looked dark brownish like the very end of a period but then turned into normal mes. blood).  It stopped by Wednesday and then on Saturday had intercourse again followed by spotting (bright red).  this only spotted after sex and went away.  By this time I had made the doctors appointment for the following Wednesday.  By the time wednesday came I woke up with a heavy full menstruation again.  the pap smear therefore wasn't able to be completed fully but I had lots of blood work done.  Now I am waiting.  Currently I am experiencing bloating cramping and have tender breasts basically for the whole month (which isn't uncommon for me and my PMS).       the doctor mentioned: swollen uterus (but I don't know what that could mean), my cervix 'looked' healthy but no smear results yet, and took blood for pregnancy test and iron and other deficiencies.      the reason I never considered pregnancy (or now miscarriage) is because the sex was so late in the cycle.  the only reason this makes sense is if I ovulate really late in my cycle.  Any advice on this as well?      miscarriage? cervical cancer? tumours? thyroid?   anyone else experience something similar?

20090225120132AA2ijQJ	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	What do you think they will do for my baby?	My daughter broke her had under a fire place mantle on 10/31/08. She was in the hospital for 2 weeks because she had very bad tissue swelling. She had to surgery's while she was there. The first one was to relieve the swelling in her had by draining the blood, that's when they found it was tissue swelling so they couldn't do anything to relieve it. So we waited for the second surgery where then they pinned her badly broken ring finger the lower part of her hand. Sense they have removed the pins she has not been able to bend her ring finger and that was like 2 or 3 months ago. She under went therapy and her finger still won't bend. What do you think the doctors will do?
20090226185104AA7ox9a	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	What is the best time my 7 month should go to sleep for the night?	My 7 month old daughter changes her schedule so much. she only has 2 solid feedings a day. (stage 3 foods) Plus she drinks about three 7 ounce bottles of formula with cereal a day. I want her in the habit of going to bed by 8:00. If I put her down that early she wakes up about 2 - 3 hours later and wants to stay up a little longer. How do I get her in the habit of going to bed early?
20090226185050AAldqXU	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	What techniques besides...?	when baby cries in the night, pick her up, feed her, or put her in bed with you did you use?  That's what I've done with my seven month old and I can not get her to sleep through the night.  I have tried everything.  If she only wakes up twice then I'm lucky.  Usually it's 5-7 times.  I get up for work at 3am and I've got to get some sleep.  I'm an exhausted grumpy mommy.  The only thing I haven't done is cry it out, and now I'm almost starting to think I need to let her lay there and cry a little to figure out how to get back to sleep.  When I put her down at night I put her down awake and she goes to sleep on her own, it's the staying asleep and getting herself back to sleep that she can't master.  What can I do before I make her cry it out?  I don't think I could lay there and listen to my baby cry, but I'm starting to get desperate.     And yes, I've mentioned it to her dr many times.  He just grins and says "Oh, you've got one of those babies.  She'll sleep eventually".  He's not at all concerned.

20090226182245AAMWHsL	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	My nine month old baby (almost nine months) shakes her head...?	back in forth, like saying "no" in multiple successions.... but she only does that when (at least I think) she's tired, frustrated, or teething.  It's an on off thing, but it still worries me.  It's almost neurological, and when I talked to her doctor about it, around her five month birthday, she said that as long as i was able to get her out of it easily there was nothing to worry about.  And it is easy to distract her from this behavior, but the consistency still bothers me.  What do you think and is this something that your child has done on occassion...      when it comes to all other milestones, she's spot on, if not accelerated, so I don't think an obvious autistic diagnosis is correct.        HELP!

I have had an on-going problem with her since she was in the 6th grade. That's when she started skipping school. I tried reaching out to her, and it didn't work. As a last resort I contacted her school, and let them know she's been skipping. I asked for help. They weren't able to get through to her.   Just yesterday DCF paid me a visit! I got a long speech, and was interrogated by them. They kept asking me why I didn't send her to school. I would go as far as dropping her off right in front of the school! But as soon as I pulled away from the school she left. I had to pay a pretty hefty fine from the courts!   If I confront her about anything she gets ridiculously mad. When she gets mad enough she loses all control, and it's like she doesn't feel pain. However, if she sees me crying she asks me what's wrong.   The other day she opened the car door while we were in traffic, and took off! PLEASE GIVE ME SOME ADVICE! I NEED IT DESPERATELY. I AM A SINGLE PARENT OF 4 KIDS.

He goes with his father every other weekend and that's the only time we get any time alone. At night we have to sleep with the door open because he can't handle the door being shut he freaks out even when she's shutting the door to change and still tries coming in even though she's told him she's changing from the second he wakes up it's mom mom mom mom mom he freaks out if she doesn't lay with him every night the second he wakes up he comes in and wakes us up jumps in the middle of me and her put his back to me and cuddles her and if it's to early he comes in says he had a bad dream so that we she'll get up and go sleep in his bed with him I know him well enough to know when he's actually had a bad dream and when he just wants to cuddle with her. he will go to the nurse and says he sick until he gets to go home so my wife picks him up and spends the rest of the day with him there have been times he claims he has an ear infection and she brings him to the doctor and he's fine he does this atleast once a month if not more and when ever I mention something about him being to dependant she freaks out and tells me he's only 9 what do you want me to do through him out on a the streets. he doesn't have ANY chores he doesn't do anything by himself he never watches tv alone or plays his playstation alone I remember when I was 4 I was more dependant than he is he will wake us up so he can go watch cartoons in the morning at what age should some dependancy be broken any help?

Ok. im in 7th grade and i go to this dance school where there are a lot of rival "clicks" or "groups" and im part of 1 and like we do stuff to girls in other groups, like we pants each other, give each other wedgies, etc. anyway, theres this one shy girl thats not part of any group and i hate her because shes just annoys me, so anyway, we can wear shorts to dance, and, lol. i pantsed her and by accident i pulled her panties down too! she cried and everyone saw and the teacher found out and so i got suspended from dance for two weeks but my mom still had to pay for that time, which is a lot! so omg, my mom was so mad at me that she grounded me for two weeks, taught me a lesson the "old fashioned" way, which hurt SO bad, like OMG, and for a month i can only wear underwear at home and nothing else because my mom wants to humiliate me for humiliating that loser!

20090226182554AAe92lQ	Pregnancy & Parenting;Toddler & Preschooler	How to *safely* involve a toddler in washing dishes?	My toddler (almost 2) loves to help me wash dishes, and since I would rather wash them during the day than after he has gone to bed, I've been trying to find ways to involve him in the washing process, but none of them seem super safe.      I don't feel comfortable with him playing in the wash side, since (1) the dishes are dirty and could potentially make him ill and (2) he splashes water everywhere, making his chair not so safe of a thing to stand on.  If I have him help with the rinse side, I have to slide him over so I can rinse with hot water and not worry about him burning himself.        So, what are some safe and still engaging options I could try for involving him in dish washing?

Some of my family want me to accompany them on a vacation soon.      -We are traveling by car (and I will be required to drive for a good portion of it)   -It is several states away from where I reside, over 700 miles from home.   -The trip will last about 8-9 days and we will be moving locations every single day.  (It's a "trek" for the family members that can actually exercise...me and another will just be lounging and then moving the vehicles to the next spot.)   -We will be doing a lot of sightseeing.  I was promised that doesn't include much walking, but not sure I believe that...      Considering that...would you go?  Part of me really wants to take advantage of this vacation that will be completely paid for before the baby arrives, but part of me just thinks this is too stressful and risky (and tiring.)  So...all opinions welcome, what do you think?  Thanks!

Today i had my first "doc" apt. it consisted of me doing paperwork, i just entered my 9th week of my first pregnancy. i filled out a few sheets of paper, handed in a packet i had filled out previously only two pages of that packet were even looked at. i had some questions but when i asked just one of them about a supplement i used to take and want to keep taking but not sure how it will affect the pregnancy. i was told "i don't know you'll have to ask the doctor" but i never saw a doctor or a nurse. i had blood taken. and had to go to yet another office to fill out more paperwork. paperwork they couldn't give me forsome reason when i went and was confirmed as being pregnant. they set me up an apt. for march it will be the very last day of my 11th week. they wanted to make it for the middle of my 12 week but husband couldn't come then. it just does not seam right to me that i can't even see a doc till my first trimester is almost over.       this is a navy hospital (military)

20090226165941AAujidn	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Do babies with low birth rate develop slower the 1st year?	I am adopting a 10 month old who is a few months behind developmentally (she isn't even crawling or close to it). Could this be because she had low birth weight. Do these babies take longer to catch up....or is something wrong with her....her mother was 12 when she had her.
20090226160141AAEhAI3	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Weight gain with breastfeed baby?	My daughter is almost 8 months old. She has been breastfed since she was born. I started her on solids at 6 months but actually ended up stopping solids cause she kept getting constipated so now I'm only 100% breastfeeding her. As I've read and my doctor has told me breastmilk and formula are more important then anything else for the first year. And since breastmilk has everything my baby needs I'm not in a huge rush to start up solids again until her digestive system is ready. So I've stopped solids for now. My main question is my baby was born 6lbs 2 oz, and now she's right around 15-16 lbs. At her last visit to the doctor in January she was 16 lbs. She hasn't gained any weight. Is this normal? And what can I do to help her gain weight. I know breastmilk has just the right amount of fat for her, and she should gain weight from it. But I'm worried. She's crawling,talking, active,smiling,bouncing, and so on. She's up to date with her milestones but she's just not gaining weight. I am only 5'0 97lbs so I myself am a small girl, and my husband isn't much bigger he's 5'7 about 150lbs. My guess is that since she's doing all her milestones for her age that she's fine and she's just a slow weight gainer, correct?

20090226175703AAP4lUq	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	How to take thievery out of a child.?	I have an 8 (almost 9) year old daughter who has gotten sticky fingers as of recently.  It often involves food but can involve other items as well- such as money, pens, paper, her sister's toys, etc. The rule in the house is if it does not belong to you then you must ASK to use it. (Part of good manners)  Food is always on a permission basis only- I gave some exceptions but specifically named them- fruits and veggies namely- carrots, banana, apple, orange things of that nature if she's too hungry to wait for meals.       Last night I found a box of girl scout cookies I had only recently opened hours earlier half eaten. I knew I had not eaten them and the only other people in the house are my daughters -5 and 8.  The 8 year old confessed guilt after being cornered (she has a look on her face that as soon as I mention it I know she's guilty whether she confesses or not). Her excuse- I was hungry.  That doesn't fly in this house.      Since this is not nearly the first occurrence she got in HUGE trouble. The previous time she was caught stealing I took a favorite toy away. This time I took them ALL away.  She was devestated. We had a long talk. Thought something might have gotten through to her.      Then today- I caught her doing it AGAIN.       I'm at wit's end with her. What can I possibly do to get the point across that stealing (whatever it is) is NOT acceptable? She's currently grounded to her room writing lines "I will not steal" but short of stripping her of eating/sleeping housework and homework I don't know what to do to make a lasting impression that this shall never happen again.      Please skip the "put the cookies away" routine. We have a houseful due to cookie orders so the  boxes are unavoidable (and it's not just cookies- just the most recent culprit) Plus it's the principle of the matter- not the cookies- that bothers me. I want to be able to leave anything out and know she won't steal it. What's more- I want to be able to take her to someone else's house and not have to worry about what THEY have out.  Basically I'd like to nip it in the butt  before it becomes a more serious problem when she's older...

I have a two week old son, and today he hasn't been napping as much as usual.  Hes been up since like 10 this morning and maybe has only napped for 2-3 hours total, where as he usually sleeps much more during the day.  Hes constantly hungry today too. But he's pooping and peeing normal amounts and doesn't have a fever.  Most of the time when hes been awake today he's been very aware and wide eyes and not drowsy acting, until the past few hours he's been a little grumpy, but I figure its because he's barely slept today. Is this normal? Is there possibly something wrong or am I just paranoid?

My daughter is six in a couple of weeks and lately she has started using the word "sex" to me and my husband shock horror. (to us she is still our little baby girl :-(  ) Anyway, I know it is alll innocent and seeing she has just started year 1, it's probably "school yard" talk  *sigh*  my husband and i are very affectionate in front of our two kids (youngest is 4 )but also very mindful and consciece of keeping the whole sex thing respectful and dont say anything innapropriate around the kids.  However, in saying that i want to talk about it to my daughter as it is somthing she is obviusly hearing...so instead of hearing warped things i'd rather her hear it from us, the parents.   The problem is...how much and what do you tell a 6 year old.  I dont want to go intop too much detail obviously cos of her age.  How do i approach the whole subject?   I want to avoid the whole embarresing thing and be as open as possable with our children as they grow, but at the same time keep it all respectable.   PLEASE...only proper answers!!!!   Thanx!?
20090226180817AAmvYKx	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Is my baby eating too much..how do I increase milk production?	My Dr. says he's doing fine, but I am having trouble keeping up with his appetite.  He is 8 1/2 weeks old (last weighed at 9lbs.5oz 2 weeks ago).  He's drinking 5 oz bottles (I pump breast milk, so he eats out of a bottle, not at the breast) every 2-3 hours during the day and 5 oz every 5-6 hours at night...Some times I don't have enough milk for the next feeding so I have to pull frozen breast milk out of the freezer to make 5 oz for the next feeding.  A few times I have not had enough milk at all (still pumping after every bottle, so every 3 hours during the day and every 5 hours at night).  When I haven't had the breast milk to feed, I've had to give formula....I'm been taking fenugreek tablets the last month, and it hasn't helped much.  I'm also drinking like a gallon of water a day...!!  What else can I do?  I can't get baby to latch on, he has only done it twice with a breast shield, but I keep trying every day.  I know when he has latched on I've gotten a few more ounces pumped the next feeding..I just don't know what else I can do, and at this rate...how much more is he gonna drink in the next few weeks?  I'm worried I'm not gonna have the supply for him if he's already drinking 5 oz..I've tried pumping longer up to 15 minutes), but it doesn't seem to help.

My husband doesn't get home until 12:30am, and after it gets dark I get so paranoid and scared. I lived in this house alone for three years before my husband and I married, but since our son was born a couple of years ago, I'm so paranoid to be home alone. I think I hear things all the time outside, and the other night there was someone walking around by our house (I saw them) and I just froze, called my husband and begged him to come home. I'm terrified to the point where I can barely move. He never bothered us, and I have a gun in the bedroom, but I'm still scared every night. It's like, knowing that I'm solely responsible for his safety is too much for me. I'm nervous all the time and it causes me to get short with him. I try and make hm stay quiet and get really upset when he makes loud noises.. IDK what to do. Should I talk to someone about this or am I just a freak? :/

If given the choice, would you abort the baby because of the unfortunate circumstances?       If, like me, you said yes, you would have just aborted Beethoven. Yes, Beethoven was    born under those exact conditions. You would have altered history forever .

20090226180012AAPC2nS	Pregnancy & Parenting;Other - Pregnancy & Parenting	Should I go ahead and give my baby up for adoption?	I am a 20 year old single mother of two boys aged two and three.       Currently we are homeless because I lost everything I had. We do not live in a homeless shelter but we sleep on my moms couch every night and we live in her living room. I do not have a job or any money to provide the basic things for the baby when she arrives and I dont want to be selfish and keep her because I love her, and I can barely provide for the two boys I have now. In my heart, I want to keep her but I do not have another option considering my situation. I do not have any support from family except for one of my mom's friends but she wants me to move to move to savannah with her and bring three kids and I dont think that would be smart to do with no money but she offered to buy what the baby needs.       The birthfather wants the baby to come and stay with he, his mom and dad but yet he has not purchased one thing for this baby and I will be induced monday. Also he does not have a room at his house as his mother and father have 5 kids and they live in a three bedroom. He is also unemployed and he likes to hang out and smoke and I dont think that would be giving my child a  better life at all. Mind u that we have one child together and he does nothing for him because his mom does everything for our child and I receive nothing so I still have to struggle and get things for him. and he has not paid one bit of child support. I just need to know what to do in this situation because i want my baby but u cant take care of a baby with love.      Also I have been working with an agency and I have created and adoption plan. I just dont know what to do and how I am going to deal with the emotional part of this.      I am working on trying to provide a better life for my boys and I and plan to put my plan in action as soon as the baby comes so that we can get our life back. My mom plans on moving also and she does not want ot take me and my kids with her and she is not interested in helping at all.      Please give me only good feedback.

I am going to put one pay check into the savings account. I am going to do this until my senior year. I am currently in 8th grade. Does this sound like a good idea? And do you think I will get enough money? I will have a job every summer *i hope* except this one. Because I am not old enough. And no matter what one or half of one paycheck will go into my savings account. And during the school year I will more than likely work a job too. I live in oklahoma btw.

Its my sisters. If you look i asked about it last year for her 13th. turns out we didnt do anything. I guess thats what she wanted. anyway, i need to do something for her this year. Me being the "grown up older sister" now and everything. So what are some ideas for a birthday party for a teenager. If you could, dont just say"hotel party" add some details of what you could actually DO at a hotel party. Like I went to one once, and there was a quince (a hispanic girls 15th birthday. like most others have sweet 16's, they have quinces- for anyone who doesnt know) and it was like 2 or 3 in the morning and people got in a fight right under our balcony that we had taken blankets and pillows and snacks onto. her mom freaked out and made us all go away from the window then she walked away and i crawled under the bed next to the window so we could watch. lol :) so anything like that little story just share ideas and experiences if you could. i might or might not pick a best answer depending on her (my sister) because she might choose an idea then i will pick best. anyway- PLEASE SHARE!!      love, emily      please dont get mad about the category. i just know there are lots of teen girls on this one and know they have ideas hey wanna do for THEIR birthdays that my little sister could benefit from. so thanks!!

THEN they told me that as soon as my baby is born, they want a dna test and that they are going to take the baby away.          the babys dad doesnt have a job, i dont think he will finish high school, and he does alot of drugs.       i honestly cant trust him to be taking my baby every weekend or so because i believe he is the type of person who would just run away with it and not give it back. he isnt responsible at all.         what should i do?
