Y7tGKcjZaa	Yeah, I would date her, if she identifies as a lesbian. I think most MTF's are straight and would rather date a male. But if she's a lesbian, I would date her.

I wonder if mtf trans give off female pheromones? Because i believe that's what makes us like the people we like. I mean, as shallow as this sounds, i wouldn't be opposed to sleeping with her if she was hot and .. didn't have a penis, but actual dating would have to involve an emotional aspect, which i'm not sure is possible if they still have that male chemistry pheromone thing you know. I mean, logically if they did have the right pheromone thing and i found somebody who i really liked, i would have no problem with dating a trans girl.<br>  <br>  and i'm femme ... i think. mostly anyway. :-)|`|le9ZROs5aa	For sure if I were into her and she me.

kK4GG6Z2aa	I think that you are very wise - for one thing your child will not turn away from a faith if he decides to choose for himself in later years.  You were forced into catholicism and it has pulled you away from God rather than drawing you closer. shame on them I say.  I also hope though that you and your husband are in agreement on this otherwise it could bring disharmony into your house.  Other than that I think what you are planning is just fine - and I too am a Christian - but didn't become one until I was in my early 30's.  However don't forget that once your child is in school he will learn about all religions so perhaps you may think about what you hope he might believe in,  if anything at all - as before you know it he will be in school and he will soon be asking questions - many of those who teach religion in school have no faith of their own and therefor cannot give a full picture of what faith is or even give a good explanation as to what the religion  truly means..I wish you a safe birth and great joy when baby arrives. Congratulations by the way.|`|sJegUB11aa	OK, well what about the Santa Claus thing?<br>  <br>  Your plan sounds good and I hope it works well.  Many people get a lot of benefit out of religion so you should also plan to not resist if your child turns out to be one of those.|`|UH1ipgJmaa	If I were the Father then I would divorce you & convert my kid to Christianity & fly away somewhere in Stockholm|`|aEdkaXmtaa	I am going to do the same thing|`|qfSKgxDsaa	why did you marry a christian?  and more a question is, if he's a christian technically he shouldn't have married you because in the Bible it says that you should not be unequally yolked; different religions.  But whatever that's your choice.  I guess letting him choose a religion is okay, but he might not pick anything if you dont talk to him at all.  Maybe a better idea is to (when he's old enough) to explain the different religions (including your own) and let him decide that way.  Good luck with this|`|hdFn4Dobaa	If you choose not to teach your child to stand for something, then your child can fall for anything.  <br>  A child learns the most in their !st years of life.<br>  Your child will learn from the world then.<br>  <br>   Do you really want the world to teach your child ?...........is what should be considered when bringing a child into this world. <br>  <br>  Most parents want the best for their children. They want more for their children, and speak into their child's future, because they love their children, I'm sure you do too.<br>  <br>  I pray that yu will find the right path to guide your children dear.|`|NsHV4O8oaa	i suppose, as your views are kind of conflicting, it would be unfair to confuse the child with those views - as instead, they would likely just do both really badly. but then again, developing an awareness of these beliefs may not be... its odd. because there will be that inquisitive stage where they ask endless questions.<br>  i would say, it is best to instill an awareness, but need the right age to do it - at a younger age it will likely just confuse.<br>  hope i was of some help, atleast lol|`|pfNnuD5saa	That's fine. Remember though that you do teach your children more by example than words. They will learn what you believe, they will then accept or reject it, just as you have done. Your children will be your best champion and worst critics in some respects.|`|S4XUl7qWaa	I think it's the only way to be sure your child will select a path that is truly right for her or him, and that it is very responsible parenting.|`|GfNVcq7Naa	I think that you didn't mention what your husband thinks about what you plan to do. Nor did you mention what he wants. <br>  What about the other family members. YOu seem to have it all figured out but what about the others?|`|OeAfpIZAaa	I believe it is the only correct way. What would the god(s) in question prefer? Belief from free will and personal decision or brainwashed belief?|`|YI8V5e36aa	Very smart.... yes do that good plan|`|fDo7CG6vaa	I think you may have a plan; however, I appreciate my parents taking me to church when I was little.  I got to share with them part of their life, even though I have left the Catholic church due to their pushing so much for us to interfere in the politics of pro-choice or right to life.<br>  <br>  Maybe you can let your children come with you to certain pagan or christian events, so they can share that part of life with you.  You don't have to tell them they have to believe anything till it makes sense to them.|`|N3Xv1EMuaa	It's the right thing to do... as it should be an adult decision.<br>  <br>  Any person of religion that insists on indoctrinating children knows their faith can't survive in a rational world.|`|rIvp1BToaa	I think  that  is ok  as long as you let  them  explore  what they want    when  old enough.|`|AA11990721	i think that's the best thing you can do for your child. just never force him into any religion|`|Gzhdixecaa	ask God for guidance.|`|FI916ISFaa	That's how our 12 year old was raised.  She has been to church with my mother a couple of times and has been told things about God by her Fundie cousins but for the most part I just answer and questions she has about God and religion as best i can but preface them with a "some people believe".|`|j7D3Sazraa	That's a good idea. I wish my parents would have let me think for myself. I hate them thinking that just because it's their religion, it has to be my religion. It was completely unfair and I respect how you're going to give your child the choice.
X548yCR6aa	You should drop your religion and friends both.|`|FI916ISFaa	I only have a couple of things to say.  First off do not witness to or otherwise proselytize to your friends.  You will only alienate them.  I will also tell you the same thing I tell my atheist daughter after she hangs out with her Christian friends and starts misbehaving; "act the way you know that you are supposed to act, not the way your friends are acting."|`|Gsd4VD13aa	What are you, five years old? No, you MUST be a teenager.<br>  <br>  1. Drop the friends. They're slimeballs anyway.<br>  <br>  2. Stop worrying about your religion so much.|`|18a5331fc23bba2ade711a68568a2f8faa	I have to be honest when asking who would be the bigger influence on who. If you think your friends have a remote chance of getting you to act in a negative way it is a bad idea. It is good to be honest about our strengths and weaknesses which is what I perceive  you are trying to do underneath the details. I also have to think if you aren't doing the things they do chances are they will view you as buzz kill.|`|AA11124121	Public school is better.<br>  <br>  these are the young people you'll be next to in life..<br>  <br>  and out here they're not all christians with values.<br>  <br>  i've been very much stabbed in the back by so-called religious people in charge..throughout my life...<br>  <br>  i trust no one..ever.|`|s40sgQ45aa	You say you want to hang out with them more and be a witness to them and then you go on to say that when you are with them it is harder for you to glorify God for some reason, like he's pushed out of your mind.  You say it is much harder to resist those things when you are the only christian around.  <br>  <br>  Shouldn't that answer your question about switching back to public school?  Do you realize how blessed you are to be in a christian school and out of the public school system?  Not many christian children have that opportunity.|`|g7bQ9zSvaa	Pray over it first, but remember that God may have placed you where you are for a purpose, and that He has a plan not just for your now, but for your future also, so submit to His will and leading. You might be there because he's preparing you for something else.  Pray for your friends also.  If you leave your school just to witness to them, you may end up feeling hurt if they don't come round.  Don't underestimate the power of prayer, and you can still be a witness where you are, and your friends will still be there after school, when you would have matured more in Christ and able to witness more effectively.  That being said, if God calls you to leave, then do that.  <br>  <br>  PS-have you discussed this with your parents?  I assume they're paying and for your private education?|`|xi19aSjvaa	I think you should do just that. You should show them how and why you are different than them and maybe start to talk about what God has done in your life and how he has changed your life. In other words, you could give them a testimony of how your life changed after becoming a Christian. If they still don't accept you, then maybe they don't need to be your friends. The best thing that you can do is to pray about it and maybe God will open up their hearts.

Eve saw “that the fruit was good to eat” and she ate of it in all her innocence! Eve had no “Guardian Angel” to advice her of anything wrong. She must have thought that God was wrong again like when he created man alone!  She honestly didn’t know that God set her up to fall, either! Her fall was planned BEFORE THE FOUNDATION OF THE WORLD! (1 Peter 1:19-20)<br>  <br>  The Bible writers say that as soon as God created the angels almost half of them were not one bit impressed with God’s Beauty and Holiness and 1/3 of them rebelled against God ON FREE WILL and on the spot! The highest ranking angel ever created was LUCIFER* (*Light Bearer) which is another of God’s goofs! He must have thought highly of Lucifer! If God were my employee I would question his competence! God also created Eve only as an afterthought! And so Eve ate from the forbidden fruit for about the same reason we eat any fruit! She had no way of knowing that Satan (aka Lucifer, aka The Old Serpent) was EVIL! Any honest Christian with a reasonable IQ can tell you that the Bible God set up Eve to eat the forbidden fruit  and in the process NO GUARDIAN ANGEL WAS IN SIGHT TO PROTECT THE BULK OF HUMANITY FROM GOING TO HELL…!!!<br>  <br>  The Bible writers created an original God different from any other primitive God. The angels that rebelled against him were not evicted from Heaven! They became known as demons. God is in desperate need of them to justify sending “the world” that he loves so much to be tormented in Hell for ever and ever! According to the Bible writers the demons and Satan will be evicted from Heaven during the “Tribulation of the last days” (Rev. 12:9-10)! Nothing really makes sense in the Bible unless you have plenty of faith (gullibility) to swallow anything that the preachers tell you! Christianity is a big business banking on people’s gullibility! <br>  <br>  Back in the Garden of Eden God set up a “flaming sword moving back and forth” to protect the “Tree of Life” so no matter how much “free will” Adam and Eve had they couldn’t eat of it and live for ever! God also PREVENTED anybody from killing Cain. God could have done something similar to protect Eve and the bulk of the human race from going to Hell unless he was determined to create human beings only to torture them with fire and sulfur for ever and ever for his wanking pleasure. Christianity is as Heathen and barbaric as you can’t possibly imagine!<br>  <br>  God personally intervened and PREVENTED that the Heathen King Abimelech had sex with Abraham’s sister/wife/hooker Sarah so he “wouldn't SIN against God"! God himself NOT A GUARDIAN ANGEL, BUT GOD HIMSELF was present in this King’s Royal Bedroom to PREVENT a questionable sexual activity that he might have enjoyed with Sarah! BTW, Abimelech means “my Dad is the God Moloch” --not related to any Bible God. But neither the Bible God in all his bragging of “omnipresence” nor a Guardian Angel was anywhere to be seen near Eve or the untouchable fruit tree to prevent that the WHOLE HUMAN RACE that God loves so much end up tormented in a sulfuric burning Lake of Fire! It doesn’t take too many neurons in anybody’s brain to figure out that the Bible writers were a bunch of wanking perverts creating a God so full of Holy Crap! It takes years of Christian schooling to keep Christianity still marketable today! The top Clergy is fully aware of all the Holy Crap that they peddle! They call it difficult doctrines in need of a new Bible version.<br>   <br>  Genesis 20:2-6 …and there Abraham said of his wife Sarah, "She is my sister."* (*incest [inbreeding] was ALLOWED, COMMANDED and ENFORCED all along by God’s Holy Law [Numbers 36:8]!) Then Abimelech king of Gerar sent for Sarah and took her. But God came to Abimelech IN A DREAM ONE NIGHT* (*only this wanking God knows how many nights he was peeking on him!) and said to him, "You are as good as dead because of the woman you have taken; she is a married woman.”* (*It would have been perfectly OK with God if Sarah had no husband! God didn’t question on whether the king was a married man or not! God enjoyed watching King Abimelech perform sexual numbers all along! God declared King Solomon the wisest man “EVER TO SET FOOT ON THIS EARTH”, too maybe because he loved to watch him perform in bed with over 1,000 wives and lovers! By the time God in the person of the Holy Ghost visited the Blessed Virgin Mary in bed he was not a nerd!) Now Abimelech had not gone near her* (*at least that night, but he must have been aware that God was watching him perform all the time because of his lack of surprise!), so he said, "Lord, will you destroy an innocent nation?* (*God and this Heathen king discuss National Security issues in a dream!!! Too bad CNN was not there to interview the king!) Did he not say to me, `She is my sister,' and didn't she also say, `He is my brother'?* (*can you imagine this holy man of God Abraham handing over his horny sister/wife Sarah without any objection for the unrestricted sexual pleasure of this Heathen king? BTW, this illiterate Hebrew shepherd Abraham already pimped his sister the same way before to the king of Egypt and he came out filthy rich out of it! Gen 12) I HAVE DONE THIS WITH A CLEAR CONSCIENCE AND CLEAN HANDS."* (*It is like in the case of EVE, but here Sarah is a “sinful” horny old lady age 90, not an honest person like King Abimelech!) Then God said to him in the dream, "Yes, I know you did this with a CLEAR CONSCIENCE* (*so as long as you do it with a clear conscience and clean hands you can’t possibly commit any sexual “sin” against this wanking Bible God!), and so I have kept you from sinning against me. That is why I did not let you touch her.”* (*Hey, what if God would have applied the same protection on Eve, wouldn’t the world be different today? The Bible scholars tell you that God prevented Sarah from enjoying sex with King Abimelech because she was going to be an ancestor of Jesus Christ! Practically all of Jesus’ ancestors are loaded with all sorts of sexual escapades!) <br>   <br>  Compare the Bible writer’s sexual tryst story of King Abimelech and the Holy hooker Sarah to the story of King David and Bathsheba… King David and Bathsheba committed adultery of the kinkiest sort! She was a gorgeous sexy married woman. After Bathsheba was done having sex with King David she was probably drenched in royal sperm so she took a shower to "purify herself and be clean” (2 Sam 11:4). She became pregnant, too with a baby boy while God was delighted watching them perform in bed! No sin here because God planned for Bathsheba to be the ancestor of Jesus Christ through King David, not through her original husband! King David had to have Bathsheba’s husband killed for fear of reprisals! She was so happy to become King David’s favorite wife that she never grieved the death of her husband. God had their baby boy killed in a long and painful death so everybody in Israel can watch him suffer and learn a lesson!  The baby boy was born in adultery and had to be killed! Pregnancies as result of incest or rape are most sacred to the Christians today, but not so babies born in adultery to this Bible God… God hates them and he uses slow painful death tricks to get rid of children like that! <br>  <br>  Later on, Bathsheba mothered King Solomon another ancestor of Jesus Christ! Like in the case of King Abimelech this wanking God enjoyed watching King David performing in bed all along, but he didn’t do a thing to stop King David from having sex with Bathsheba. God didn’t stop King David from killing her husband, either because God loved King David, “a man patterned after God’s own heart”! So as long as you are a Christian you can get away with murder before God, but be aware of the long arm of the SECULAR LAW that supersedes any Law of God!<br>  <br>  The Bible God didn’t hesitate to stop the Hell bound Pagan King Abimelech from having sex with Sarah so he wouldn’t sin in spite of the fact that Sarah was a horny old lady age 90! Old Christian ladies take a cue that age is not a restriction as far as enjoying good sex goes! Later on God didn’t stop King David from having sex with Bathsheba and killing her husband! In the case of a Heathen King God feels that sex is wrong and it has to be prevented, but with King David sex and murder is OK… it is all within “God’s plan of salvation.”<br>  <br>  In due course God was “pleased” to send his ONLY BEGOTTEN SON to be totally beaten, tenderized and thoroughly marinated in Roman soldier spit so he can be nailed totally naked to the Holy Cross as a “worthy lamb of God taking away the sins of the world”. BTW, the Roman soldiers never dressed the genital area of their victims with a white diaper! Now Christians need to snack Jesus spit flavored Meat and drink his Holy Blood in the Holy Communion so they can go to Heaven when they die. Jesus was terrified about dying on the Holy Cross! He was sweating blood praying “to pass the cup!” He must have asked his Sadistic Heavenly Father, “Hey Dad, wouldn’t have been much easier to stop Eve from eating the forbidden fruit?”<br>  <br>  Christians are brainwashed to believe that the Bible doesn’t mean what it says and that it can’t be taken literally (short of seriously)! Isn’t it ridiculous to live in a Country that chose to be a Nation under this peeping-tom wanking GOD? Christianity is about the most immoral religion in the world today, second only to Islam!|`|Jgoylfvqaa	My Savior<br>  My best friend in the whole world!<br>  My creator!|`|vYFqEtcUaa	God is my father, protector, but most of all he is my love!|`|49c1ed9541d154d45ed38796a9a07ec3aa	Lucifer himself ,,thats why i choose not to follow|`|Ps0tDYBAaa	a being that gives me peace of mind when i need it.|`|xelkbdbdaa	Chris said it all.|`|4K3jzOUzaa	i am myself god|`|mZegY0loaa	The  horned god...<br>  and who could forget the Goddess.|`|FMuSs9Qtaa	A higher being somewhere|`|hR7OsqtRaa	2 Timothy 3:16<br>  All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness.<br>  <br>  Galatians 1:11-12<br>  I want you to know, brothers, that the gospel I preached is not something that man made up.

The authors all present different perspectives, but they all proclaim the same one true God, and the same one way of salvation—Jesus Christ (John 14:6; Acts 4:12).<br>  <br>  In John 8:58 "I tell you the truth," Jesus answered, "before Abraham was born, I am!"<br>  <br>  The above verse speaks a lot about who Jesus really is.<br>  <br>  All about Jesus and the Holy Trinity explained in the below website.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com</a><br>  <br>  Lots of videos, sermons, songs are also present, along with all of Jesus miracles, his parables, and questions on his birth, crucifixion, resurrection are answered.<br>  <br>  Many major questions on Christianity are answered with lot of examples that cannot be denied by anyone, such as,<br>  <br>  1) Did Jesus really exist? Is He God? Why did He suffer on the Cross?<br>  2) What is so special about Jesus? Why cant I just view him as an ordinary man or a teacher or a prophet?

Jesus is God in Heb. 1:8<br>  3. John the apostle states that Jesus was the Word which was God that became<br>  flesh (John 1:1-14)<br>  4. The phrase "Call upon the name of the LORD" (Hebrew, YHWH, i.e., Psalm<br>  116:4) used only of God on the OT, and translated into the Greek in the LXX as "Call upon the name of the LORD (greek, KURIOS)," applied to Jesus in the NT (1 Cor. 1:2) Jesus is God in flesh<br>  5. The apostle John says that Jesus was , "...calling God His own Father,<br>  making Himself equal to God," (John 5:18)<br>  6.

s3iruA0raa	it shows an uneducated person, in my opinion.  Words can bring comfort, pain, embarrassment, joy.  There is connotation associated with words and they invoke strong emotion or feelings.  Use a wise vocabulary and show your intelligence.|`|4nu8OOFSaa	I personally don't think there is anything wrong with the actual words, just the way people use them - most commonly to describe something bad, or in a way to try to embarass someone. I think that this is probably why people call them curse/swear words, because they are usually used in a bad way.<br>  <br>  :]|`|DgFhlJvYaa	Monkey see monkey do. I curse sometimes but I learned it from my mother & father. Im 19 now & ever since I was 13 I was cussing. I mainly only do it when Im mad or when Im just having a bad day. People have different opinion's on this subject. Some people think it's not ok, others think it's a way of relieving stress, others think it makes you look like an idiot. Having said that it just depends on the person who say's & the people their around. Cursing isn't a bad thing in my eye's, but if your one of the very many people who curse around little kid's & in public place's then they should learn how to keep it down when kid's are around.|`|dvgj6q6xaa	They are just words but WORDS MEAN THINGS. Curse words sound offensive to people and show that the user is an illiterate a$$hole.
A1Dawc5paa	Well I'm pretty girly, but I'm not all about looks and outfits.<br>  I LOVE girly girls, but of course they have to have certain qualities or theyr good looks won't take them anywhere. She has to be: loyal, hobest, intelligent, down to earth, stand by her beliefs and morals ect. <br>  <br>  I like this type of girls because although there's nothing wrong with (dykes,butch? Pick the word you like to use) I think a feminine girl is just  ...GORGEOUS . They get my attentiong and I feel we get along so much better. Also, and I hope I don't offend anyone but I don't exactly like men, so why would I want a girl that looks or acts like one?|`|NmQCYizTaa	Im a sorta in between (NOT leather :P) lesbian, and I'd go for an inbetween as well, I think, from experience.

More boyish actually.<br>  <br>  Femme or Butch, both suits my taste, but I like skinny girls, or just a little bigger than me. But I don't like weak and uninterest, unopiniated girls. It's pathetic to me.<br>  <br>  Humble, well-mannered, confident, a good sense of humor, independent, smart.

To clarify, the words "Sunni/Salafi" are used to make a distinction between genuine Islam and deviant ideologies that claim to be Islamic. These terms are used when neeeded so the general Muslim is not confused between the various parties that claim Islam.<br>  ---<br>  "A Brief Introduction to the Salafi Da'wah"<br>  <br>  The Salafi Da'wah (da'wah literally means "call", and in this sense it refers to calling to the truth, preaching and propagation) is that of the Qur'an and the Sunnah (i.e. the Religion of Islam - pure and free from any and all additions, deletions and alterations). It means adherence to the Path of the Messenger, may the peace of Allah upon him, and the Faithful Believers, namely the Salaf as-Saalih and all those who follow in their footsteps in belief, actions and morals.<br>  <br>  Allah has said: "And whoever contends with and contradicts the Messenger after guidance has been clearly conveyed to him and chooses a path other than that of the Faithful Believers, We shall leave him in the Path he has chosen and land him in Hell, what an evil refuge!" [Surah al-Nisaa' 4:115]<br>  <br>  Shaikh-ul-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah commented on this verse: "All who contradict and oppose the Messenger after the right path has been clearly shown to them, have followed other than the Path of the Believers; and all who follow other than the Path of the Believers have contradicted and opposed the Messenger after the right Path has been shown to them. If one thinks that he is following the Path of the Faithful Believers and is mistaken, he is in the same position as one who thinks he is following the Messenger and is mistaken."<br>  <br>  -Who are the Salaf and who are the Salafis?-<br>  <br>  The Salaf as-Saalih are the Companions of the Prophet, peace be upon him, their Followers (the Taabi'een and the Taabi Taabi'een (i.e. the first three generations of Muslims) and the Scholars of the Ahl-us-Sunnah wal-Jamaa'ah after them who followed their way in belief and deed. Among them are :<br>  <br>  Imam Abu Hanifah (150 AH), Al-Awzai (157 AH), Ath-Thawri (161AH), Al Laith ibn Saad (175 AH), Imam Malik (179 AH), Abdullah ibn al-Mubarak (181 AH), Sufyan ibn Uyainah (198 AH), Imam Ash-Shafi'i (204 AH), Ishaq (238 AH), Imam Ahmed bin Hanbal (241 AH), Al-Bukhari (256 AH), Muslim (261 AH), Abu Dawood (275 AH) and others.<br>  <br>  Ibn Taymiyyah (728 AH), and his students: Adh-Dhahabi (748 AH), Ibn al-Qayyim (751 AH), Ibn Katheer (774 AH) and others.<br>  <br>  Muhammed bin 'Abd al-Wahhab (1206 AH) and many of his students.<br>  <br>  And in our time: Abdul Aziz bin Baz, Muhammed bin Saalih Uthaimeen, Muhammed Naasir-ud-Deen al-Albaani.<br>  <br>  The Salafis are the Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa'ah. They are the Taaifatul- Mansoorah (the Aided, Victorious Group) and the Firqatun-Naajiyyah (the Saved Sect) which have been mentioned in the following statements of the Messenger, peace be upon him:<br>  <br>  "There shall not cease to remain a single group from my community upon the Truth, victorious; they are unharmed by those who abandon them and those who oppose them. They will remain (in my community and in such a state) until they fight the liar (i.e. the Anti-Christ (Dajjal)."

"Wahhabi", was particularly used by the Sufi grave worshipers in the time of Shaykh Muhammad ibn Abdul-Wahhaab, may Allaah have mercy on him, as they took offense to their shrines of shirk being demolished in accordance with the Sunnah. See <a href="http://www.thewahhabimyth.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.thewahhabimyth.com</a> .<br>  <br>  Q) "They follow the Qur'an, Sunnah and the example of the Sahabah etc... pious predessors."...that means every Muslim...?"<br>  A) No it does not. Many Muslims claim to follow the understanding of the Sahabah, but it is an empty claim. For example, the Sufis claim to follow the Qur'an and the Sunnah, but they perform and call to acts of worship that were never taught by the Prophet, peace be upon him. The Shia claim the same, but they have taken their Imams as intermediaries with Allah. Terrorists claim to be following the Sunnah, yet they kill innocent people all over the world and cause widespread corruption. All of these groups have fallen into severe error because they interpret the Qur'an and the Sunnah in a way that opposes the actual, authentic, and contextual teachings of the Prophet, peace be upon him, and the scholars throughout Islamic History.<br>  <br>  Q) Difference between Salafi/Sunni?<br>  A) The terms are interchangeable to an extent. They are terms used when needed to clarify the difference between true Islam and deviant ideologies that claim to be Islamic. The term "Sunni" came about to clarify to the general Muslims that the "Islam" claimed by the Shia is not true Islam. Later on in Islamic history, the scholars of the religion, used the term "Atharee" (means: a follower of the authentic narrations) to clarify to the general Muslim that a true Muslim is one who accepts and follows the authentic narrations from the sunnah (because in that time, people who rejected hadeeth would still call themselves "Sunni" so the general layman would be confused about the difference between truth and falsehood.) Likewise the term "Salafi" is used when necessary to clarify that true Islam entails following the understanding of the Salaf-us-Salih in actuality (because there exists Muslims who claim to be Sunni but who practice Islam with a corrupt methodology). These terms are not "sectarian" terms, rather they are used so the person seeking to worship Allaah correctly will not be confused by all the parties that claim Islam.|`|Um8G2ZS3aa	ISLAM IS 1 = SUNNI<br>  anything else is off center<br>  ya_shami@yahoo.ca|`|MhbEQoJYaa	Tell him to be a Muslim who Follows the Quran and the Sunnah of the Prophet Muhammad (saw).|`|T0LMj7ZHaa	Sunni-|`|Ilc0eEGOaa	sunnah|`|liGflTmjaa	the main stream islam which is  is sunni islam  <br>  <br>  sunni islam follows quran and sunnah of prophet pbuh|`|RLQpyK3Jaa	He should be a Muslim who follows the sunnah of Muhammad salallahi alahi wa salaam as directed in the Qur'an :<br>  <br>      ?????? ????? ?????? ??? ??????? ??????? ???????? ???????? ?????? ????? ??????? ??????? ??????????? ???????? ???????? ??????? ????????

You will see their actions and disapprove of them.” Hudhayfah said, “Will there be any evil after that good?” He said, “Yes, there will be some people who will invite others to the doors of Hell, and whoever accepts their invitation to it will be thrown in it (by them).” Hudhayfah said, “O Messenger of Allaah, describe those people to us.” He said, “They will be from among us and speak our language (i.e., from among the Arabs).” Hudhayfah asked, “What do you command us to do at that point?” He said, “Adhere to the jamaa’ah (group) of the Muslims and their leader.” Hudhayfah asked, “What if there is no jamaa’ah and no leader?” He said, “Keep away from all those different sects, even if you have to bite (i.e. eat) the root of a tree, till you die while you are still in that state.” (Narrated by al-Bukhaari and Muslim).|`|7KyYzytbaa	well , bro , i guess they didnt get the msg of ur Q , lol , did they?<br>  <br>  this Q is asked to show u that all these sects u r making is just wrong & all what we have to do is to follow the prophet's life , no more..<br>  <br>  thx for ur Q..<br>  love & peace from islam..|`|e3PWZYsAaa	Salam,<br>  <br>  tell him there should be no sects in Islam.....<br>  <br>  tell him he shouldn't believe in sects.......<br>  ......but school of thoughts<br>  <br>  so tell him to look into these and chose the school of thoughts wisely.....<br>  <br>  i'm a muslim who follows the Shia school of thoughts.......<br>  ......and my reason is the fact that it makes more sence than the other school of thoughts<br>  but a lot of people disagree with me, while a lot of other people agree with me.....<br>  <br>  end of day, each person will answer for himself in the day of judgment......<br>  <br>  Peace.|`|mOWyzwubaa	tell your friend to Follow Quran Alone, Quran is easy to understand and follow,Quran is Mufasal Kitab<br>  <br>  17:36 Do not uphold what you have no knowledge of.

They translate it as "Lord alone in the Quran." Though there are many verses emphasizing God's oneness (see 39:45), this verse could be understood as another one emphasizing that message. However, this could be only a secondary meaning of this particular verse, since the adjective wahdehu is used not after the word Rab (Lord) but after the word Quran. In Arabic if one wants to say ‘Quran alone,’ the only way of saying it is "Quranun wahdahu."<br>  <br>  and also 39:23<br>  <br>   39:23 God has sent down AHSAN UL HADITH, a book that is consistent, relating/contrasting/repeating.

For one, I don't know how to integrate it unless its broken up into parts, which cannot always be done.  <br>  <br>  I should probably stop stressing over all of it though..

Sometimes I wonder one of the "big" questions: why am I here?  Sometimes when I ponder it, I feel this weird sensation.  I feel like I'm being pulled back into some higher truth or something.  Its like the allegory of the cave.  Here we are, in the depths of the cave, chaned by plannet earth to look at the wall with the shadows.  We have our whole crazy society based off of the strange flickering shadows.. and someone, or something, or something that is not something at all, is pulling me to see the fire.  <br>  <br>  Wow.  I think thats the first time I talked about that.  <br>  <br>  On a lighter note, language is a big cage for me.  There are so many things that language keeps one from being able to understand.  For instance, some languages need a subject for a verb to make sense.  Some languages are vague.  Some languages tye feminine and male qualities to every single tini tiny word.  <br>  <br>  Sometimes, well actually most of the time, I don't think in english because of this language problem.  I tried discussing this with my psych teacher once.  He insisted that everyone though in a mix of pictures, spoken words, and feelings.  I told him I did not.  Most of my thoughs are in thoughts, not pictures, words, or feelings.  Its almost like a feeling, but its like feeling the exact neuro transmitter and not going all the way to translate that into language.  <br>  <br>  hmm...

ca4247c09b67a73146e3e075c995e872aa	Words and/or some sort of insult would never compel me to become violent, as long as the confrontation remained verbal- my assailant would be free to say whatever he/she wanted to say, and I would walk away as soon as I got tired of hearing it, without being violent. I would only resort to violence if I were to be physically threatened, and someone else made the first move, i.e. somone hit me for no reason. Then, YEAH- I would not hesitate to become violent. I personally believe violence is in our nature as humans and as products of our universe- everything we know and see, however beautiful or ugly, is ultimately the result of extremely violent processes and reactions that took place over time. For  me, then, it stands to reason that violence is simply an integral part of our nature, since we, too, are ultimately a product of that same "natural" violence that has been going on for billions of years. We're a part of nature, and so violence is also a part of us.|`|Cbom3Lweaa	Some people have limited intelligence|`|aSs0tfjUaa	Because ignorance is all too common.|`|R0mZqqfXaa	We all have violent tendencies it just comes out easier in some people.

It's just one of those things.   This is probably going to keep happening to you for several decades.  You're just going to have to learn to deal with these feelings.

Go to another church. Sorry that's the only answer.<br>  <br>   Yes I do believe Satan has ways of weasling into our lives like this. He finds our weaknesses and latches onto them and makes them grow.<br>  <br>  Just keep praying for God to help you fight the power of the devil in your life. Then be smart and use the brains God gave you and get away from him before you do something stupid. Men can pick up on these vibes very quickly and you wouldn't want something to happen. <br>  <br>  No matter how against Adultery you are Satan is very powerful and attraction and sex can win over brains sometimes. Him being a pastor doesn't make him any stronger then any other man. He's still a man and don't think for a second he hasn't felt your admiration for him. To a man it's like a 6th sense.<br>  <br>  Good luck, it sucks when this happens.|`|mr0Hb5fvaa	umm, it sounds to me that if it was satan tempting you he would be getting his way with your decision now. you should not quit church, because it is essential to your spiritual growth. the gathering of people at church may actually help you overcome these thoughts. if you feel it is necessary talk to the man, or if that is awkward, his wife, and ask for help. you already realized that it is something wrong, so that is the first step to getting past it. the bible says if one eye sins, pluck it out. don't let it infect the whole body. i don't think this passage is meant to be taken literally, but if your mind is sinning, then you need to ask god to help you clean it up. bottom line, don't stop going to church.|`|qfSKgxDsaa	Satan is definitely attacking you!  Anything He can do to bring you down and try and get you to do things that are agaisnt God.  The reason you have that you want to stop going to church, I don't think is right.  If at all you need to envelop yourself with God even more!  I am a Christian, and I am not against taking a break from church, but it depends on your reason!  For me, I'd rather have a talk with God by myself or a Bible Study by myself.  For me, I get more out of it then by listening to someone else talk about what they felt was on THERE heart that day...not that this is bad, just for me I like my own experience.  But if you are under spiritual attack, which it sounds like you are, I think going to church is a good idea, but of course this is your decision.  Also this is most likely just a phase you are going through, and you'll get over it.  But you definitely need to seek God and it will go away with your Faith.  My favorite verse is Hebrews 11:1 "Now Faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen"|`|DDYIrSKOaa	Ye must be born again<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.chick.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.chick.com</a>|`|sR4HjV9Paa	Can you skip a meal for a month?

Always it's not how you feel, its what you do with those feelings that make the difference.  <br>  <br>  Another cause of attraction to someone is because you do not have a special person in your life.  Perhaps you can have your pastor's wife fix you up with someone who shares your spiritual goals and is available to to you.  When you have someone he will go back to being the spiritual leader he was and nothing more.<br>  <br>  Don't beat yourself up...it happens to all of us!|`|LXNgztljaa	I don't feel as though its fair for your actions ot be explained. You feel an atrtraction, thats I assume a good thing. Not going to church for a month, I haven't been to mine in about 6 though we moved overseas. I think the most important thing you can do here is look at what attracts you to this man. Is it his humor? His personality? If so, try to expand your pool of friends so you can find younger single men like him and just remain friends. You cannot change a man nor can you control him. If his wife and him break up, it cannot be because of you but what he feels for you. I would say you must be a special lady if he is that interested in you but do not seduce him ever before you understand whetehr or not his wife is leaving him, or vice versa.|`|MqLxwsw7aa	NEVER let yourself be in ANYTHING that would be even suggestive of a compromising situation or anything that will be construed as one - whether church related or not!

You're lonely and you found some company.<br>  If you're really that serious about it, then consider looking for another church. Pray about it, too. That's the best thing you can do. If not, just stop hanging around them for a while.<br>  Quitting church for a month won't just make the feelings go away. This is something that you have to deal with.|`|etIBdVE3aa	Make no mistake that once you try to follow Jesus and his narrow path. The devil will make every attempt to trow you off that path that leads to heaven.<br>  The Devil does NOT work in the bars or in sexually oriented clubs. It is clear to me that the devil works in the people who are trying to follow Jesus. Fishermen do not fish on the bottom of their boat where their catch is. They fish the waters for fish that they do not have. Satan works in very similar way. Catch the fish that are getting away. Why chase fish that are in the bag.<br>  Since I accepted Jesus as my Lord and savior. Satan has played on me very similar temptations that you are describing here.<br>  Accepting Jesus is accepting the target that the devil will do his best to get to.<br>  Now cutting church practices may be what Satan wants from you. So tempted or not he will try to trow you off.<br>  Without the interaction of the congregation you can grow cold in the faith. On the other hand you hare being temped. It is biblical to cut off the part that makes you sin. <br>  In this case you must fight the good fight in your heart and mind.<br>  <br>  God's speed|`|FI916ISFaa	I've skipped church for 263 months and counting with no ill effects.<br>  <br>  That said, you would be better off to distance yourself from temptation.

You and the husband do though.<br>  There are other churches if you still want to go to church but don't want to see the pastor.|`|78a004f4953e767d0c2c36ffd1bf1c39aa	First, do not overly credit the Devil, you should know that it is by your own evil desires that drag you away and tempt you.  I can bring up that passage if you want it.  Second, if the man is half the Christian you think he is you could never be a home wrecker or whore, with him, as he would not even consider it.  You are most likely having a crush and it happens.  You need to distance yourself until you can reign in your feelings.  It is good to notice the qualities you want in a future spouse and should pray that God would lead you to such a man.  You already know God would not lead you to a married man and to entertain any such ideas are indeed sinful.  Your dreams are warnings against such actions and if you listen to them you will remove yourself from that temptation.  You do not have to quit Church, but that is an option if you cannot control yourself.  You are not to forsake the gathering of believers so Church is an easy way to do this not the only way.  Bible studies and good Christian friends are more than acceptable means.  You could also find another Church with similar beliefs and immerse yourself there being a positive help in the youth ministries.
X3QbcIUwaa	I would like to say yes.<br>  <br>  We were very poor when I was a young girl. One day, I remember my mother crying and feeling helpless, because she did not have money to buy olive oil to cook the little food we had. Also our only cooking pan was ruined and we had no washing liquid to wash our dishes.<br>  <br>  Me and my sister hugged her not knowing what else to do deeply aware that we had no where to go for help/money.<br>  <br>  At that point someone knocked our house door. It turned out to be the local warehouse owner. He wanted to give us: a new pan, wahing liquid and a bottle of olive oil. He said that something got him to get these items and knock our door. He left immediatelly as he came, very shaken.<br>  <br>  Now, of course that could have been a coincidence, but the Christian in me says a miracle. <br>  <br>  That person never really spoke or interracted with us prior to this even, at least nothing more than a hello.

That's part of the problem for those who don't, can't or won't believe. They are the people who refuse to actively seek out the only possible proof of God's existence - not scientific, but personal experience. Because they believe the scientific method is the only way to prove something exists, and they don't accept personal gnosis as proof enough, they miss out.

fjsczTsMaa	Interesting question. I watched a documentary last year about this; apparently on a scientific level, people are naturally attracted to those who have lighter skin. Simply because, the lighter a persons skin is, the easier it is to tell whether or not they are healthy.<br>  <br>  Secondly, in all races females tend to have lighter skin than their male counter parts. Therefore, light skin is considered feminine. Even the ancient Egyptians depicted women with almost white skin, even though they would have been reasonably brown.|`|2sLv6uXtaa	Im light skinned doesnt mean i always get treated better and ive seen GawJuz....dark skinned ppls...its about the facial features and their bod and talents aswell not everyone is as narrow minded.<br>  <br>  but there are some that thinks light skinn = beauty.|`|FKxrJxbPaa	Its rooted in the imperialism and colonialism of the last 500 years. <br>  <br>  With European cultural expansion came the spread of their ideals of beauty.

Additionally, people from across the ethnic spectrum have their likes and dislikes within their own group as well as others, as to skin tones, facial and physical features, etc.<br>  <br>  Have you heard, "The blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice!" I'm sure something of that sentiment exists in most ethnic groups. That's where folks who are not incarcerated by self-debasing standards are coming from. I like what one y/a responder said: We are all the same color, just different shades and tones.<br>  <br>  It means that we have to be free to see through the eyes of our souls where beauty resides and not through the cracked lenses and pernicious propaganda of hollywood, the fashion industry and other sources of sickness.  Peace.|`|LhCGU3F1aa	Yeah, Latinos do the same. Its pretty fcked up. Im North-Western Indian, and trust me, were naturally light, even though i hate it. I wish had like tanned brown skin lol. I don't think skin colour makes anyone more prettier or ugly. Its whats on the inside that counts. It just sucks that our world has so much stupid people judging people by their looks and skin colours. Light Indians can be found in India, mainly in the north/Punjab region. The dark ones are probably the Tamil ones. Im not even going to lie, their girls are gorgeous. They have beautiful big eyes, and really nice black hair. BTW, theres is no common Indian folks hunny. Theres many different ethnic groups, so which one do you consider 'common'? BTW, it happens in alot of Cultures. Latinos, Blacks, Indians, and Middle Easterns think that lighter is more beautiful. Asians think bigger eyes are more beautiful.

A dark object reflects fewer visible photons than other objects, and therefore appears dim in comparison. For example, matte black paint does not reflect visible light and appears dark, but white paint reflects all visible light and appears bright.

It left me with a sense of wonder and led to quite an interesting journey beyond that day:<br>  <br>  In Lincoln, Nebraska, my children and I lived in a rather strange house. Many things happened, such as the front door being wide open early in the morning, when I knew that it had been locked the night before. There was the sound of a child crying when no children were home, things would move, and my son told me of things he saw in the basement. I didn't exactly want to know these things, so I tried to ignore it all.<br>  <br>  One night, though, in the early morning hours, I felt someone's presence in my room. Of course, I had a couple of my children camped out with me, but this was different. I opened my eyes and a woman was standing next to my bed, looking at me. I didn't feel threatened. Rather I felt loved, safe, and that this being meant no harm. I rolled over and closed my eyes. When my brain kicked in telling me that there shouldn't be a woman in my room, I looked back, but she was gone.<br>  <br>  I don't know why I saw this at this particular time. I could conjecture many things, but this experience has led me to wonder, not just about the existence of spirits, but of so much more.|`|2f80c7f92ac35179422c66cc55098c7eaa	Clarify your question more.

AA11743216	I feel that suicide is a sickness of the mind.<br>  Jesus would have and does have compassion<br>  on the sick, Im sure He would have had your<br>  brother seek out other means, but dying <br>  an unbeliever is the thing that takes one to hell.<br>  It sounds as if your brother was saved and<br>  believed. Since Jesus was given the power to<br>  Judge- John 5:26-27 , most people overlook those verses,<br>  Jesus is the Judge, and<br>   I believe based on that,<br>  and what you have already stated, your brother<br>  may not be the greatest in the Kingdom, but<br>  is in the Kingdom regardless. <br>  I pray that the Holy Ghost fills you and your family<br>  with His peace. I lost my husband and was<br>  saying the "repentance prayer" as he was giving<br>  up the ghost due to heart attack, so I know<br>  exactly what you guys are going thru. My husband<br>  was either already gone or was unable to respond<br>  but I pray he heard and his heart was right. He was<br>  only 39. He was a good man who saved me from<br>  a life of hell from an abuser. He might of not been<br>  the perfect "church" christian, but he certainly gave<br>  his life to me and my children and donated his free<br>  time at the foodbank to help strangers. So I feel the<br>  Lord will judge fair.|`|ec0b60fee25a982ef565651fd4f465d1aa	The bible says NOTHING about suicide.<br>  God knows your brothers heart.God does not allow one of his lost sheep to go astray without retrieving them.<br>  God knows if your brother had mental problems.<br>  <br>  I also had a brother who shot himself and lived, was on drugs and alcohol, eventually gave his life to Jesus then turned back to drinking and drugs which killed him.<br>  I know for a fact hes' in heaven.God sent me a message.<br>  <br>  Pray for your mom to have peace that only comes from his holy spirit.<br>  God bless you dear.

Suicide does not make a person lose their salvation.Nothing can separate us from the love of God . If once saved, always saved. "Nothing can snatch them out of His hand".  We have a friend, actually a Pastor that lost  a son to suicide - and he knows that his son is in heaven.  Your mom and everyone else will grieve the loss- they still do , and this was a good 8 or 9 years ago, so grieving is a natural process and one that God totally understands- but you can reassure your mom that her son is in heaven, since he was born again.  Remember that the Holy Spirit seals us unto the day of salvation.|`|18a5331fc23bba2ade711a68568a2f8faa	Most people that commit suicide do so in a mentally imbalanced state. I am not saying this to insult anyone but I heard this from a Christian councilor I heard many years ago. I take comfort from knowing that God declares himself in scripture be be good, just and merciful. With that I leave these difficult situations for him to sort out. If I have learned anything from Jesus it is that he was willing to forgive when people were eager to throw rocks.<a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?book_id=23&chapter=145&verse=8&version=50&context=verse" rel="nofollow">http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?boo...</a> and|`|25qUTYLEaa	I personally believe that God felt you brother's pain, and understood it better than anybody. He knew he was being tormented mercilessly. Our Father is a loving and forgiving Father. I believe He would have compassion on your brother who was in so much pain. God is the keeper of all promises. He cannot tell a lie, or go back on His Word. Therefore, tell your mom that your brother is in Heaven with Jesus. God has already kept His promise to her, and all He wants is for her to TRUST in His promise and return to living again. God bless you and your mom. Suicide is so painful especially for the loved ones left behind. But have FAITH in God. He will never leave or forsake you.|`|5OucqEzFaa	Isaiah 61:1-3: "The Spirit of the Sovereign Lord is on me, because the Lord has anointed me to preach good news to the poor.

The gospels are full of his compassion. He understands our grief and our pain. He understands your pain, and your mother's pain and he understands the pain of your brother. Just lay this down at the foot of the cross and trust in the Lord to do the right thing.<br>  <br>  My heartfelt prayers go with you and your mother.|`|f3nwI8ytaa	In order for a suicide to go to hell, they must have been in full possession of their faculties, aware of the consequences, and not care.  Does that describe your brother at the time of his act?  God is fair.  He's not looking for reasons to reject people.  None of us can know the state of another's heart before God.  I will pray for you and your family in this season of loss.<br>  <br>  peace|`|bp2kMAr7aa	Could a loving God ever judge someone who is ill? I don't think so.

We do not know if, in the final moments he may have repented. God is far wiser than any, and He alone is capable of making a judgment.<br>  (about her bargain with God, her lifelong commitment in return for His saving her household: there is no bargaining with God; He has determined how it shall be.

So the believer that commits suicide, goes to heaven.  It is impossible to lose or "leave" salvation (John 6:39-40, 1 John 5:13), so the believer that commits suicide, still goes to heaven.  And it only takes a moment of having believed in Jesus alone for salvation, at any point in their life. <br>  <br>  The unbeliever that commits suicide, goes to hell, because they are an unbeliever.|`|cKuppxUQaa	I am so sorry for your mothers pain, it is so hard to lose a child. I lost my son in August and tomorrow is his birthday and i miss him so much. Your mom should just trust that God knows what was in your brothers heart.

My prayers are with your family and i pray God will give your mom peace of mind.|`|i6Mi8uWIaa	Christ is indeed very merciful and compassionate. <br>  <br>  Christ taught us that the only unforgivable sin is blaspheme of the Holy Spirit. So no, your brother is NOT roasting in Hell. Mark 3:28-29 tells us this. <br>  <br>  Instead, your brother went to Purgatory when he died. There, he is being cleansed, and when he is fully cleansed, he will go to Heaven, if he is not there already. <br>  <br>  Mental anguish mitigates the grave sin of suicide and lessens the punishment. It is our responsibility to pray for those who have taken their own lives, just as we are to pray for all the dead.|`|t88527U1aa	I'm not a Pastor  but my heart goes out to you. I am a minister for Jesus Christ. These questions cannot be answered by men but only by God. If your brother accepted Christ into his life he is saved as Chris said. As Jesus said to the thief on the cross you will be in heaven with me this very day,if your brother accepted Christ,God is righteous and just to cleanse him from all inequities. I am sorry for your loss my family will pray for yours.|`|uK3tkaOJaa	I'm so sorry for the pain both you and your mom are having.  I'll star this so my Christian contacts can see it and hopefully help you with scripture.<br>  <br>  I don't have scripture for you, but I have another thing that you could perhaps talk to your mom about.  When she's open to a conversation about it, perhaps when you're discussing torture, talk about the morality of torture.  Ask if it would be moral for the USA to torture someone for a solid year.  How about 2 years?  Even Bin Laden and Hitler didn't torture people for that long.  If these evil beings couldn't torture, how could a loving god?  It doesn't make sense and your brother isn't being tortured.|`|CT265lQyaa	Your brother is NOT burning in hell or anywhere else.<br>  You need to understand that.<br>  Your mother needs to understand that.<br>  It is FACT.<br>  She probably needs to see a real medical professional, they even have doctors who specialize in "grief counseling".<br>  Not that losing a child doesn't cause unequalled unhappiness, but there is absolutely no valid reason for her to continue to suffer so badly over this every day for the rest of her life.<br>  There are things that can be done to help.<br>  Whatever you have to do to help her, do it.<br>  If praying helps, do it. No matter what it is, as long as it makes her pain less.<br>  Two things though:<br>  <br>  1. Keep her away from anyone who even thinks that there is a possibility that her child is in hell and might tell her something like that, or even say they aren't sure. She needs positive reinforcement. Look up some bible verses that support her son being in heaven or at least say that he isn't in hell. She needs this kind of reassurance as often as possible. Keep it coming.<br>  Might as well use religion for it's intended purpose.<br>  In this particular case, it may be the only thing that helps, even though it is technically the cause of her unreasonable fears.<br>  <br>  2. Please, please, please make an appointment with a counselor or other mental health professional. Larger churches even have access to psychologists and counselors who use religion to help their patients.<br>  <br>  I can't believe I'm giving some of this advice, but I know that losing a child is the absolute worst thing that can happen to any human being. The only thing that I can imagine to be worse is thinking what your mother thinks.<br>  <br>  The ONLY thing that matters here is helping your mother to believe what she needs to believe.<br>  <br>  Please do something for her.<br>  <br>  While you might not agree with my views, be assured that not only do I give great advice, but I genuinely want this poor woman to be helped, and I truly think that she could be, by a professional.<br>  I hate to say this in this way, but I assume you are grown. Take this responsibility onto yourself. Either see that she gets real help, or leave her to her agony. It's up to you to do something for her.<br>  How much do you love her?<br>  Do something for her then, follow my advice.<br>  You won't be sorry...|`|MqLxwsw7aa	My Condolences for your loss.<br>  <br>  It seems that you both need something to heal and Truth so that you can move onward and forward!<br>  <br>  Take the time and READ The Anointed, The Elect, and The Damned! as it does contain ANSWERS that you seem to suggest you need.|`|RgceFQ9Caa	You have received only one answer that shows any understanding about just what your brother  is subject to after this incomprehensible act which has brought so much grief on his family.   The Bible does not teach the concept that the dead go to heaven or hell upon death.  Instead, it teaches that when a person dies they go to the grave to sleep until the time the Almighty has ordained for their resurrection.   At some point in time, your brother will live again and you and your mother will have some time with him to love and cherish him and help him overcome whatever troubles drove him to this act.<br>  <br>  Job 14:14  If a man die, shall he live again? all the days of my appointed time will I wait, till my change come.<br>  <br>  Perhaps in the meantime you could both be comforted in studying the truth about what happens after death.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.ucg.org/booklets/AD/" rel="nofollow">http://www.ucg.org/booklets/AD/</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.ucg.org/booklets/HL/" rel="nofollow">http://www.ucg.org/booklets/HL/</a>|`|hWvvrEphaa	This is the only question I have ever answered that points do not concern me. <br>  <br>  I know your pain and I am terribly sorry to know you and your family are going through this. My lifelong friend committed suicide last April. He became a very dark person after he was raped by a German man in 9th grade while hitchhiking. He became very depressed and introverted. <br>  <br>  The world is full of people who think they have answers to this question. I don't have an accurate answer but I know the bible does and even if we can't pinpoint where it is you can take comfort knowing that God is very mysterious. There was a man from where I live who was declared dead for 3 hours. He came back to life (I won't get into the story because its way to long) and testified in church. He wasn't a christian and he had died from a drinking and driving accident. <br>  <br>  Here is what I can tell you. In the bible (I'm sorry but I'm not sure where it is) it states that in heaven you will see people you never thought you'd see and the people you think you will see may not be there.<br>  <br>  In his last few breathes he might have regretted what he done and asked for forgiveness. It is also not impossible that the Lord appeared to him before he passed and gave him a choice. If you research near death experiences, you'll see that many people who have died and come back to life have said that Jesus is very loving and does not want us to go to hell. I believe that people who commit suicide were troubled and felt deep emotional suffering. Only God knows what people go through before they take their life. You have to remember though that God is very merciful and he loves everyone, even those that hate and mock him. <br>  <br>  I don't know if this helped and again I'm sorry for your loss. <br>  If you want to talk to me, you can send me an email. I'm here for you.<br>  <br>  *hug*|`|vYFqEtcUaa	I'm so sorry for your lose. I am only 14 years old, but I know Jesus would never send your brother to hell.

When a child messes up and makes a mistake, he doesn't give up on them and send them to hell. He keeps helping that person get through the tough times. Your brother is in heaven with Jesus!

3DjUX8etaa	It is a common teaching in Hinduism, Buddhism and many New Age beliefs. It is the concept that we are punished or rewarded, not by a god, but by a natural process that exists in the world which reacts to our deeds. Most religions that believe in karma also believe in reincarnation. Reincarnation is thought to be directly related to ones karma. God Bless!  +?+|`|8PjHFUdfaa	Its amazing how many people don't know what karma really is.<br>  <br>  Its has nothing to do with good or bad or payback for bad deeds or suffering for sins.<br>  <br>  Karma is the accumlative result of past thoughts and mental attitude, supposedly stretching back into past lifes.<br>  <br>  So if you went thru 30 years of your previous life dreaming about being rich, then its possible because of karma that in this life you will end up in circumstances that make you rich.|`|fjidmhxsaa	Karma is the concept of "action" or "deed" in Indian religions understood as that which causes the entire cycle of cause and effect (i.e., the cycle called sa?sāra) originating in ancient India and treated in Hindu, Jain, Sikh and Buddhist philosophies.<br>  <br>  In these systems, the effects of all deeds are viewed as actively shaping past, present, and future experiences<br>  <br>  This is a noun-form coming from the root kri meaning "to do," "to make." Literally karma means "doing," "making," action. But when used in a philosophical sense, it has a technical meaning, and this technical meaning can best be translated into English by the word consequence. The idea is this: When an entity acts, he acts from within; he acts through an expenditure in greater or less degree of his own native energy. This expenditure of energy, this outflowing of energy, as it impacts upon the surrounding milieu, the nature around us, brings forth from the latter perhaps an instantaneous or perhaps a delayed reaction or rebound. Nature, in other words, reacts against the impact; and the combination of these two -- of energy acting upon nature and nature reacting against the impact of that energy -- is what is called karma, being a combination of the two factors. Karma is, in other words, essentially a chain of causation, stretching back into the infinity of the past and therefore necessarily destined to stretch into the infinity of the future. It is unescapable, because it is in universal nature, which is infinite and therefore everywhere and timeless; and sooner or later the reaction will inevitably be felt by the entity which aroused it.|`|971d3daea9af9b7b15f437ab3cfcc861aa	Probably the easiest way to explain karma is "what goes around comes around."|`|xi19aSjvaa	Our history teacher said that karma in the Hinduism religion is your accumulation of good deeds.|`|sR4HjV9Paa	It's pagan.

What you send out ot the universe the universe gives to you. (all in all, this means your actions be it good or bad will have a reaction you will see and feel.)<br>  <br>  Karma is not wiccan. It is one way to expain the same things i mentioned above. One of them I believe is the newtons law of physics, perfect in almost any situation. <br>  <br>  you hit a vehicle, that vehivcle caused yours damage and that owner will be verypissed and might be tempted to kick your butt. <br>  <br>  forgiveness stops karma on some degree but most frequently, it is the fact that you have injured or helped someone and the people are either envious or hurt becaus eo fwhat you did to that person. Rappers have been shot for this.

Why on earth should you care? People have all sorts of reasons for their beliefs. So what? I'm sure you also have plenty of beliefs that aren't based in reality. We all believe some things simply because we want to. Unless you're a machine, that is. <br>  <br>  Beliefs, even illogical ones, are part of what makes us human. Get over it!|`|jkW2b55Qaa	I think it's a pretty good reason.<br>  <br>  I mean, if you accept the idea that you are only in it to feel better, at least you are admitting your selfishness.   Maintaining the fiction that oyu are after the truth and yet still clinging to the obviously ridiculous notion of religion shows a lack of integrity and your inability to own up to it.<br>  <br>  This way, you are at least admitting you have no integrity.|`|08ae3d05d7e2c113fc49e08dbdcfa338aa	I hate the thought of my corpse rotting in the ground that is why I am going to be cremated.

Thats their happyness and their relationship with the Gods that does not involve me.  <br>  <br>  I believe in the Norse Gods because I like the culture, the rules, and the Gods called me.  <br>  <br>  <br>  hmm..  Then again i'm more tired than happy at the moment.  I've been up for 24 hours.  Wee, my eyes aren't focusing.  I'm hungry.  I've been ramboling a lot lately.  weeeeee.  pretty colours.  I'm starting to see things.  Wait, its only been 24 hrs--I shoulding be seeing thin--OMG a ghost.  Theres a ghost.  ahh!!!  oh good, it didn't see me.  15 more minuites until my shift is over, 15 more after that for my cooworker to arive late.  ffs.  always late. grr.  well, there was one time, like 3 weeks ago, where she was actually early for once.  That was strange.  Was nice though.  hmm...when I get off work I really want food.  but I decided not to eat.  no, no food.  grr.  i want food.  but no, i no will let self have food.  i hungry!! grrrrrr.  i torture self.  usually this is much more enjoyable.  hmm...  i wonder if i didn't eat for an entire two weeks how much I could potentially loose in weight.. but i dont want to do bad in school.  bleh.  why must they not give me sufficent breaks in school, why!.  i want like two or three weeks all to myself so i can do whatever i want and not worry about lowered brain function because my body forgot how to metabolize glucose from my fat.  hmm.. i wonder how much water i'd need to drink, like if i could get a lot from the fat.  wow, thats more chem then i wanted to remember.  oh well, probably a good thing.  that way, when i have kids, i can explain to them why a kangaroo rat doesn't need to drink.  hmm...  i want nuts, nuts sound good.  oh wait, we were answering question.  i forgot.  um.. the answer is pi.. i like pi. yeah.  oh, and he shouldn't be wanting to believe in the Godhs just to get to Valhalla.  valhalla is like one of the hardest halls to get into.  you have to be picked to get there by Odin.  ooo, i like cheese.  grr.  must stop food.  must stop food.  omg, i think i hear the cooworker.  wee!!! shift over!! maybe.  wait, false alarm.  that was some random door opening and closing.  ahh!! the ghost is back.  RUN!!|`|OnzQmPFYaa	Oh my...i know it is kinda of sickening rotting in the ground and all kinda bugs in and out eating up the dead flesh...wow!....but you have another body inside that body so be careful what you say young heart it is a spirit body that lives and you surely do not want it to feel the fire do not hate your life now... live with passion and purpose... be grateful to be alive...take time to laugh and play...focus on the good things in life, be amaze at how even the birds sing for you...and dismiss or should i say evict those thought who are trying to take you to that rotting corpse in the ground...enjoy!!!!|`|OUBuIKDMaa	It's the same reason most atheists choose not to believe in God; they find it more comforting to stay in their intellectualistic, cynical bubble of disbelief than to so much as examine the possiblity that a god or gods might exist.|`|ZvTbDyxUaa	I thought you weren't supposed to challenge beliefs that didn't interfere with your own life...
3xlDwlkhaa	I believe the phrase is simply metaphorical in that it directly compares seemingly unrelated subjects. At various points in history and across cultures, strong emotion has been associated with the liver, the spleen, the space between the eyes, etc. Surely you have heard of a 'gut feeling' in reference to something strongly felt or intuited.<br>  <br>  In moments of excitement, whether that excitement be pleasurable or threatening, the heart has a tendency to speed up its beating as part of an adrenaline based fight or flight response. The sensation is quite noticeable.<br>  <br>  ~~~~~~~~~<br>  <br>  Love, by the way, is not an emotion. Love is an intention to behave toward another in a way that is beneficial to the other's well-being.<br>  <br>  Acts of love are usually reciprocal. We hold an expectation of a return. Spiritual love and altruistic love are given with an expectation of something beyond the material.<br>  <br>  The strength of the commitment fluctuates; accordingly, so does the behavior - intention and a commitment to the intention being the driving forces behind the choice of displayed behavior.<br>  <br>  Emotions are conducive and peripheral to love, but they are not the love itself.|`|4405cb5dd585bee70aeaf6a964ff0b94aa	We can thank the Egyptians for this one. The ancient Egyptians believed that the Heart and Spine were the two biggest items that involved life and judgment into the afterlife. When they would mummify someone, they noticed that the Heart was central to the body and surrounded by bone, so it must have had some importance. Being, at the time unaware of the function of the brain, this was viewed as head-stuffing and never given a second thought. The heart was used in judgment in front of the 42 Gods who comprised a council, and the heart was weighed against a feather, which if the heart weighed more than the feather, it was Devoured by Ammit, a really nasty deity of sorts, or in terms, a controlled demon. So the heart was granted with the ability to choose instead of just pumping blood, it could feel, it could think, it could heal, several aspects according to the ancient Egyptians. Faith in our hearts come from the Egyptian idea. The Council at Nycaea gave us the Bible.|`|FIXKYCIGaa	The idea that the heart can be the center of emotion was around for thousands of years before it was understood that the brain is the center of emotion.  Some times you meet someone and when you see them or think about them you get a warm feeling in your chest.  It's a great feeling.  That's where the idea originated long ago that the heart is the center of emotion, particularly love.  It not hard to understand that a devoutly religious person could get that same feeling over something that to them is just as important, if not more important, than love of another person.|`|gsTpQmGfaa	It is a metaphorical expression, I believe it is because the heart beats faster in response to love. I also call it an "inner-light".<br>  Hope this helps :-)|`|PAA4uWPuaa	Because one can not live without their heart and I suppose it sounds better than "I love you with all of my medial insular"|`|jkW2b55Qaa	It's a metaphor for strong emotion.  You know, the kind that makes your chest tight, heart beat fast, etc.|`|Z4QbQt3Xaa	Pagans, Jews, & early Christians believed life was in the blood.<br>  They knew that the heart was a vital organ circulating the blood.<br>  This extended into their concept of sacrifce, draining the blood.<br>  The Jewish priest would sprinkle the people with the blood.<br>  When someone is in love, their heart rate increases.|`|wwdllMzYaa	cos they feel serotoninin their brain, and instead mistake it for 'faith in the heart'<br>  apparantly if you are a beliver this may well be easy to mistake|`|2h8tqOeFaa	Because when you feel something emotional your heart beats faster or slower, hence why the heart became symbolic to emotion.. <br>  <br>  Through ancient history the Bible has been studied right up to today, and its never changed..<br>  <br>  When you say no one really knows, just think about the fact that its there to begin with, and all the things that are written within are things that scientists of recent times have only recently discovered..|`|25qUTYLEaa	I know it doesn't seem "logical", but when you give your heart to Jesus, it literally springs to life!!! Seriously, it feels so beautiful and warm and wonderful that anyone who doesn't believe just wouldn't understand. It is like the feeling of a first-love, but multiply it by a million! It is an awesome and life-changing experience! It is a miracle in itself. True believers do know where the Bible comes from. It comes from the Word of God. And the Word never changes. Hun, I hope you put your doubts aside some day and feel it for yourself. You won't regret it! :)|`|nXSpS3Axaa	Feelings are chemical reactions in the brain..|`|s40sgQ45aa	How can you feel love when the heart is an organ that pumps blood?  Answer that question first....

SCkhQc2Caa	No translation can resemble the Qur`aan in precision of expressions, highness of style, or beauty of composition. Nor is it possible to reflect the miraculous nature of the Qur`aan, fulfill all its goals in illustrating rules, principles and etiquette or indicate the lessons and primary and secondary meanings deduced from it. Any one who tries to do so is trying in vain.<br>  <br>  People of Knowledge can express what they have understood from the meanings of the Qur`aan in other languages to help the speakers of these languages get the ideas, even though they are not ultimate. But this is not considered to be Qur`aan; it could be classified as belonging to illustrations.<br>  _____________________________<br>  <br>  The rewards reading Qur`aan is only for the one who reads the Qur’aan as it is in Arabic, not for the one who reads the interpretation of the meanings in any other language.<br>  <br>   However, if a person reads a translation of the meanings in order to understand the meaning and benefit from what the aayaat are saying, then he will be rewarded for doing this, and his reward is with Allaah, because the Muslim will be rewarded for reading tafseer (explanation and commentary), and a translation is tafseer.<br>  <br>   But there is no indication that the person who reads a translation will earn the reward mentioned in the hadeeth. The bounty of Allaah is immense. <br>  <br>  And Allaah knows best.<br>  <br>  [Shaykh Muhammed Saalih Al-Munajjid]<br>  ___________________________|`|qky7gWosaa	It does count. The whole world does not speak Arabic, does it? Allah is Merciful. However, it is best to learn Arabic and read the Qur’an in Arabic for a better understanding. <br>  <br>  It is not an absolute necessity to read the Qur’an in Arabic but is recommended for a better perceptive.<br>  <br>  (41:44) if we made it non-Arabic Quran they would have said, ‘Why did it come down in that language?’ Whether it is Arabic or non-Arabic, say: ‘For those who believe, it is a guide and healing. As for those who disbelieve, they will be deaf and blind to it, as if they are being addressed from faraway.’<br>  <br>  The Qur’an was revealed to Muhammad (Saw) in Arabic only. So any Qur’anic translation, either in English, or Latin, or any other language, is neither a Qur’an, nor a version of the Quran, but rather it is only a translation of the meaning of the Qur’an. The Qur’an only exists in Arabic in which it was revealed.|`|RLQpyK3Jaa	I don't think that's true.  Muslims who are reverts may not be able to speak Arabic, but are expected to perform salat. It took me a little while to say my salat in Arabic, but, based on my intentions, insha'Allah, what I said in English counted.<br>  <br>    Or, better yet, just remember Allah subhana wata'ala is a Just, Merciful and Loving Creator and makes our deen actionable and never a burden.<br>  <br>    Insha'Allah this helps-|`|KqiiT1WSaa	The reading of the translation of the Quran is NOT reading the Quran, simply because the Quran is in arabic<br>  <br>  The words of Allah (swt) are in Arabic not English|`|SjLDdUh7aa	Intentions and your heart counts more than actions.

Logically I know I don't look any different than I did the day before when I went out with friends, but something just says to me "Hey. Hey you. You don't look like you oughta." or sometimes it feels like someone has come around in the night and shrank all my clothes so they cling where they shouldn't.<br>  <br>  Usually though, I bully myself out the front door and to the bus stop. Once I get into doing whatever it is I set out to do, I don't really think too hard about how I look. I'm usually okay once I get out, and if I am not I hurry through what I need to do and go back to the safety of my apartment that much quicker.|`|X1j7qYkUaa	it makes sense.<br>  <br>  (that's all I have after sitting here and finding my own insecurities are too big to even respond to a message that really doesn't apply to me, yet easily identify with.

The word is nigh thee, even in thy mouth, and in thy heart: that is, the word of faith, which we preach; <br>  <br>   9That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. <br>  <br>   10For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. <br>  <br>   11For the scripture saith, Whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed. <br>  <br>   12For there is no difference between the Jew and the Greek: for the same Lord over all is rich unto all that call upon him. <br>  <br>   13For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved. <br>  <br>   14How then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed? and how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard? and how shall they hear without a preacher? <br>  <br>   15And how shall they preach, except they be sent? as it is written, How beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel of peace, and bring glad tidings of good things! <br>  <br>   16But they have not all obeyed the gospel. For Esaias saith, Lord, who hath believed our report? <br>  <br>   17So then faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God. <br>  <br>   18But I say, Have they not heard? Yes verily, their sound went into all the earth, and their words unto the ends of the world.|`|6D2jlvgkaa	Of course we hear with our physical ears .In the mean time , we should keep  our spiritual ears also open .The only it will work .<br>  <br>  "18.

What happens is it suddenly becomes clear to you what He is saying. You know that you know that you know etc.<br>  <br>  Discerning things is very important in the times we live in. If you read something that is wrong you kind of feel it like a knot in your stomach. <br>  Even if the book is supposed to be spiritual. If it is incorrect you will get that knot in your stomach. That's the Holy Spirit warning you not to be deceived. Many TV shows and movies affect me that way these days.

RR|`|UWlRLXvRaa	We "hear" when God's people preach the gospel. (Rom. 10:14) That's why Paul said How beautiful are the feet of those who bring the good news in Rom. 10:15.<br>  <br>  But have you ever noticed that not all who physically hear the gospel, receive it? Why is that?<br>  <br>  It's because they didn't hear it on the inside. The light didn't come on. The didn't "see" it. They didn't "hear" it spiritually. Oh, they heard it physically but couldn't hear it spiritually.<br>  Why not? <br>  The word for word in Romans 10:17 which says, "faith comes by hearing and hearing by the word of God." - that word means 'rhema' - which is a Spirit breathed word. It's a spoken word from God. It's living. It's alive. It's 'rhema'. When we read the Bible, the written word, we are reading the "logos" word. It's the general overall will of God in written form. That isn't the same as rhema. Rhema is different. Rhema is a Holy Spirit breathed word. The Holy Spirit takes a logos word and makes it come alive. <br>  To just sit down and read the Bible doesn't guarantee that we'll have ears to hear what God is saying. We need to pray for rhema words and revelation as we read the Bible. <br>  When rhema comes so does faith. Faith is a gift from God. (Eph.2:8) It comes when the Holy Spirit opens our inside, spiritual ears to hear and our inside spiritual eyes to see.<br>  So just reading the "red" words of the Bible is no guarantee that we will hear. We must pray for the Holy Spirit to open our ears and eyes to help us see. We must open our hearts to listen to what He, the Spirit is saying. We trust Him to help us hear.<br>  <br>  That's why we must approach Bible study as little children. We don't seek to understand it with our own power of reason because reason can't understand God's thoughts. (Isa. 55:9). We come humbly and quietly to God listening with open hearts to hear what He's whispering in our spirits.<br>  <br>  Yes, like everything else, with practice we begin to learn what is of God and what isn't. (Heb. 5:14)<br>  <br>  When God speaks, many times it's a thought that was out of the blue. It brings peace. It can bring joy. It's full of light. That's why people sometimes exclaim, "I see! I see it!" His word brings healing and direction that leads to life. It cuts down between the soul and spirit. It's sharp. (The sword of the Spirit in Eph. 6 is the 'rhema' of God, not the 'logos' of God.) God also speaks in pictures. That's why He spoke to people in dreams throughout the Bible and even today.<br>  <br>  When the devil speaks, it comes with a sense of anxiety and guilt, like "If you don't do this now, you'll be condemned or you'll be lost!" Such a word puts the pressure and weight on the hearer. God convicts people of sin while satan condemns people of sin. His words are heavy in a guilt way. It has a sense of condemnation.<br>  <br>  God speaks to His people by His Spirit sometimes directly and sometimes through His written word and sometimes through His Body the church. <br>  God speaks to the world, by His Spirit through His Body, the church. That's why Jesus sent us into all the world because God now speaks to the world through His Church. Not through angels; not through nations; not through asses (although I'm sure some might disagree with me on that point :) ), He speaks to the world through His church. That's why we are colaborers. That's why Jesus told the disciples to pray that God would send more workers out into the fields. (Matt. 9:37-38)|`|qfSKgxDsaa	This is a very good question (I star you:) Okay people normally do not audibly hear God, they talk to him and then feel like they get answered, like asking to be shown a way to do something and then the next day (or in a dream) get shown, etc.<br>  <br>  2. The way you recieve salvation is one way; by accepting the Lord Jesus Christ as Savior into your heart <br>  <br>  3. The red in the Bible is what is believed were God's words.  So (at least for me, I don't know about others) this is not "hearing" it's just like reading.  You hold it higher then anything else because after all it's the Lord's words!<br>  <br>  4.  I think what you are looking for in this one is when you hear stuff literally you eventually become spiritual, and or can hear (or get visions, i.e. dreams) like God's speeking to you (like what I said at the top)<br>  <br>  5. I believe that the Bible is the only book of God and any other book is a knock off of that.  THe problem with a lot of the other "bible's" out there is that people that wrote it, took bits and pieces from the Bible and then twisted it and changed it to what they WANTED it to say, and then people read it and beleive it, it's really bad.  I know what's true (in the Bible) so when I read, or hear anything that is different I know it's not right.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps! :)|`|wQiD8uZWaa	When you go to church and are preached to you here threw you ears <br>  <br>  But once you are truly saved and accepot jesus christ as savior,and keep faith  you hear see and feel through the holy spirit <br>  <br>  <br>  Galatians 5:22, 23 <br>  But the fruit of the Spirit is <br>  love, joy, peace, patience, <br>  kindness, goodness, faithfulness, <br>  gentleness and self-control. <br>  Against such things <br>  there is no law.|`|3l6DE1m0aa	I think you described the process pretty well.  It was basically how I was going to answer.  To confirm:  hearing precedes faith.  Hearing is an essential part of the sanctification process, one of the first steps.|`|OMRjXLQAaa	There's many ways to approach your question, but 1st let me answer you from my experience that <br>  <br>  1 & 2) I heard with my physical ears God's Inspired Word correctly preached by a man in A PCA church and I was moved by the Holy Spirit to KNOW that God was real.<br>  <br>  3) In following Christ, you know how He leads you when He does it, so you 'hear' and follow His commands, as it says in Deut (ESV) :6 "So you shall keep the commandments of the LORD your God by walking in His ways and by fearing Him" and in the NT 1 John 5:3 "For this is the love of God, that we keep His commandments. And His commandments are not burdenome." It's easy to hear, but harder to turn what we hear into the practices of our daily life.<br>  <br>  4) If you listen to the "Prosperity (only) preachers" Benny Hinn, Kenneth Copeland, Jesse Duplantis & Joel Osteen you'll hear an incorrect & twisted version of the intended context of God's Word, so you must discern if what you hear follows the proper context in which God's Word was delivered.<br>  <br>  5) It's a difficult thing to fathom "can you discern the spirit behind the words" of an ungodly book.  I've read a few books which made me feel creepy and feel like the author was tryign to lead me down a path of thought that wasn;t in line with what I've read in the bible and have tested to be true.  It was obviously a pipe dream kind of book and I put it down like it was dirtying me up ... so, for me, yes, though not always, I'm sure.
AA11876718	GHOSTS yeah never encountered one but I Reeeeally really believe in them...because I heard lots of stories ever since I was young but you know what?? it's not about the scary ones..it's about the good or stange ones that made me believe.

There could be a spirit out there but there is no proof yet. I think they are real because why else will these random things happen when we do not do anything. For example, why do books fall from shelves when no one touches them? You have to think outside the box in order to answer this.|`|xarKlp0Oaa	Holy cow I sure believe in ghosts because I have actual pictures and videos.

gDr6c4hraa	Praise be to Allaah. <br>  <br>  Firstly: <br>  <br>  The hadeeth which condemns extremism was narrated from ‘Abd-Allaah ibn Mas’ood (may Allaah be pleased with him) who said: The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Those who go to extremes are doomed.” He said it three times. <br>  <br>   Narrated by Muslim (2670).   <br>  <br>  The scholars have many explanations for what is meant by extremism and those who go to extremes, all of which are in harmony with one another and do not contradict one another. All of them may be summed up as meaning one thing; it boils down to overburdening oneself and being too strict in matters where strictness is inappropriate. <br>  <br>  These meanings include the following: <br>  <br>  1 – Going to extremes in worship, which leads to excessive hardship. Islam does not enjoin anything but that in which there is ease and tolerance. It forbids excessive strictness in religion. The forms of extremism that people have invented in religion and were listed by the scholars as being examples of extremism are virtually innumerable. <br>  <br>  Al-Nawawi said in Sharh Muslim (16/220): <br>  <br>  i.e., those who delve too deep and go to extremes, and overstep the limits in both word and deed. End quote. <br>  <br>  2 – Introducing innovations into religion, by forbidding that which Allaah did not forbid, and introducing forms of worship and commitments that did not exist at the time of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). <br>  <br>  Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in Majmoo’ al-Fataawa (10/620): <br>  <br>  Monasticism and innovated forms of worship which were not prescribed by Allaah and His Messenger are akin to the cases where the mushrikeen and others forbade good things that Allaah has permitted, and examples of the extremism that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) criticized when he said: “Those who go to extremes are doomed” and “If the month were made longer for me, I would have continued to fast without a break so that those who delve too deep would give up their attitude”, such as extreme hunger and thirst which harm the mind and body, and prevent one from doing obligatory or mustahabb actions that are better than that. The same applies to walking barefoot and naked, which harms a person and brings no benefit, as in the hadeeth about Abu Israa’eel who vowed to fast, and to stand always and never sit, and never seek shade, or speak. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Tell him to sit down, and seek shade, and speak, but let him complete his fast.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari. This matter is broad in scope. End quote. <br>  <br>  3 – Exaggerated and affected speech, by trying to select words which attract people’s attention, with no meaning or benefit.  <br>  <br>  Ibn Abi’l-Dunya narrated this hadeeth in his essay al-Gheebah wa’l-Nameemah (Backbiting and malicious gossip), in a chapter entitled Ma jaa’ fi Dhamm al-Taqa’’ur fi’l-Kalaam (p. 15), in which he narrated from ‘Umar ibn al-Khattaab (may Allaah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “That which I fear the most for my ummah is every well spoken hypocrite” <br>  <br>  It was also narrated by Ahmad in al-Musnad (1/22) and classed as hasan by the editors of al-Musnad. <br>  <br>  He also narrated that ‘Umar ibn al-Khattaab (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: “The prattling of speech is the prattling of the shaytaan.” <br>  <br>  Ibn al-Atheer said in al-Nihaayah (5/164): <br>  <br>  Those who go to extremes in speech are those who speak in an affected manner. <br>  <br>  4 – Indulging in that which does not concern one, asking about that which is inappropriate, and delving too deeply into that which is of no benefit.  <br>  <br>  al-Khattaabi said: <br>  <br>  The one who goes to extremes is the one who delves too deeply into a thing, and burdens himself with looking into it in the manner of ahl al-kalaam, who examined matters that do not concern them, who indulge in that which their minds cannot comprehend. End quote from ‘Awn al-Ma’bood (12/235). <br>  <br>  Ibn Rajab said in Jaami’ al-‘Uloom wa’l-Hukam (p. 285): <br>  <br>  The one who goes to extremes is the one who delves too deeply and looks into that which does not concern him. Examining and asking too much about the ruling on something that is not mentioned among obligatory duties or haraam things may lead to thinking that it is haraam or it is obligatory, because of its similarity to some duties or prohibitions. Accepting pardon for it or refraining from asking too much about it is better. End quote. <br>  <br>  Then Ibn Rajab (may Allaah have mercy on him) mentioned some examples of what we should refrain from asking too many details about with regard to matters of the unseen that are unknown and subtle fiqhi differences, and discussing things that rarely happen, and so on.  <br>  <br>  Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen said in Sharh Riyadh al-Saaliheen (1/416-418) <br>  <br>  The same applies to being too strict in matters of worship, when a person is very strict in prayer, fa|`|Bt7LaDd9aa	No, she only wishes to be socially secured and safe. That's not extremism.<br>  <br>  Btw, not every extremism is linked to religion as presumed by most people today.|`|Ipheh638aa	there is no such thing as extremism, its better to folow Islam properly than be a 50/50 muslim|`|7KyYzytbaa	yeah , i think she is , ppl can disagree with me as much as they want , but this is my opinion..<br>  <br>  islam is the religion of moderation in every thing , can u tell me where is the moderation when a woman covers all her body ( including face & hands ) completely ?!!<br>  <br>  what's wrong with wearing a modest hijab & fashionable clothes ( in the limits of islam ) without showing her body nor her hair ?!!<br>  <br>  islam allows women to look beautiful BUT not sexy , and there's a huge difference here..<br>  <br>  love & peace from islam..|`|7Q33v5hOaa	No not at all. <br>  <br>  Extremists are those who go over the top and break human rights.|`|QcviYozHaa	Peace..<br>  <br>  No that isnt extreme...What is extreme is that someone has a different view on 1 part of the religion with another and doesnt accept the others opinion and wouldnt talk to the other person because he has a different view...<br>  <br>  I.e. Extreme in easy ways could mean, A person could say "i will not marry a shia because i am a proper sunni" After all at the end of the day they are muslims and extremism shouldnt come in the way of unity...Though people that pretend to be muslims 'try' to increase hatred..<br>  <br>  Peace|`|emJ79qagaa	very haram <br>  <br>  I personally would never do that unless I was in the middle east.

Just as heterosexuals can lie anywhere on the gender spectrum between butch and femme, so can homosexuals and transpersons as well.<br>  <br>  Just as gender roles and gender identity don't necessarily have to match in hetero culture, it doesn't have to match in trans culture as well.  I think their identities are just as valid as anyone else's.|`|oVeGMNsLaa	I think that they *can* be threatening to others who fit into more binary gender expression, especially when those people are just first coming out as trans and often overcompensate for their fears about not passing by being super manly FtM's and incredibly femme MtF's.<br>  <br>  I mean, all you have to do is read Joshua Bastian Cole's article "Tarheels and Transfags" on BeyondMasculinity.com to see how much a trans person's individual gender expression can definitely hurt others;<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.beyondmasculinity.com/articles/cole.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.beyondmasculinity.com/article...</a><br>  <br>  There are lots of cool people who accept all sorts of gender identities and gender roles, but a lot of trans people, strangely enough, are pretty invested in the traditional gender roles.|`|le9ZROs5aa	I think they fit in just fine.

Like if you make race a big deal, even if your not being negative towards the race, but making the person feel bad about it or different for it.<br>  <br>  I agree with the other person, it's usualy something that's just been imprinted in their minds from how they have been raised and the people they have been around (their environment basically). If race has become an issue in your life, and the people around you are racist or act racist in any way. You will most likely be racist aswell. Or if you just don't like people from a certain race for your own reasons. It would be hard to change yes but not impossible if they had sense!<br>  <br>  Racist people are not compassionate, understanding, reasonable or logical at all.<br>  <br>  I hate racism so much! It's one of the worst, most idiotic things ever.<br>  <br>  Oh and it's not just white people that are racist! :S|`|ca4247c09b67a73146e3e075c995e872aa	product of your environment- plain and simple. the older one gets, the harder it is to overcome views and beliefs that were instilled in one's mind from day one on. therefore, people who were raised in racist environments also become racists, and it is just as hard for them to change as it is for someone who is NOT racist to become one. In a sense, they really don't have a choice, and very few people have the reasoning skills and logical sense to overcome the racist values and beliefs they have grown up with their entire lives. It's not entirely impossible to change that, but extremely difficult and unlikely. The biggest obstacle for racists is understanding, realizing, and acknowledging that they ARE in fact racist- this is next to impossible to accomplish when all you've known your entire life is racism. understand?

ptIIkqq0aa	Sweetie, bless you with your calling to the religious life. That is amazing that you are trying to emulate St. Therese. I'm right around your age and I sometimes consider being a nun, too. The best thing for your to do is to talk to someone in your local parish, possibly even the Priest. Mark D did a very nice job answering your question-it would be best to come into contact with your Vocations director. Hopefully you would be able to meet other nuns and help be guided along your journey.   <br>  To help grow in your spiritual life, read the Bible more, pray the Rosary, attend mass, there are so many different ways. Praying is also your best bet. <br>  Best of luck along your journey, please feel free to e-mail me with any questions- especially regarding this matter :)<br>  You are in my prayers ?|`|592517cb7a38eb4f9614445c37df538aaa	Send a letter to this wonderful religious sister and ask her to find you a spiritual mentor.<br>  <br>  Mother Joan Paul, C.K.<br>  Villa Regina<br>  4100 S.W. 56th Street<br>  Lincoln, NE 68522|`|31M2IDw2aa	I think that 'Mark D' gave great advice.  Meanwhile, frequent Mass, and frequent confession are THE BEST ways to grow closer to our Lord.  Also pray the Rosary, it is said every night on the EWTN channel.  <br>  <br>  I truly hope that you do become a nun, it will bring to you an eternity of happiness.|`|i6Mi8uWIaa	What a wonderful saint you have chosen to emulate! She had a beautiful view on life with her "little way." I attempt to emulate her, myself, dedicating everything I do to God.<br>  <br>  The best thing you can do is to find someone within your own parish to act in this manner. This person can also become your confirmation sponsor. <br>  <br>  However, if there is ever anything I can do to help you, don't hesitate to e-mail me through my profile! I would be very willing to guide and mentor you wherever I can.|`|TO4bRflyaa	I am glad that you are an admirer of the Little Flower saint. It would be best if you have a spiritual guide from your parish. Getting in touch with your parish priest will give you greater momentum towards your calling.<br>  <br>  I hope you are aware that St. Teresa was a cloistered nun, which requires greater dedication. Share your calling with your parents. I am sure they would be proud.<br>  <br>  Please don't hesitate to contact me through my profile. I would be glad to be of any help.|`|LKRXCFuWaa	You need to talk to your local priest about this seriously. If you want, he can schedule to meet with you once a month or so, in something called "spiritual direction," where he helps you to listen to what god is saying to you. You can speak with him about what you believe you are being called to do and you can further explore the possibilities.<br>  <br>  your priest will be able to put you in contact with the Vocation's director in your diocese, if you want. The Vocation's director is a priest who's sole job it is to help young people discern entering religious life. He will help you to meet other nuns and learn about the various communities, arrange opportunities to meet with sisters of different orders, and talk with girls around your own ago who are also thinking about religious life.<br>  <br>  You should also be talking to your family about this. It's a big step! Get your folk's input, tell them what you think and what you feel. Have them speak with the Vocation director as well.<br>  <br>  I will pray for you and I hope that this will help, in some small way, for you to better discern God's will for you.|`|SEXr9IrOaa	I am saying this out of complete sincerity. If your goal is to grow spiritually closer to Jesus then read your bible. Start with the book of John but don't just read it for pleasure. Read it and dissect it and really try to meditate on what Jesus is saying (Joshua 1:8). And pray to God multiple times a day for someone to disciple you until you have peace (1 Thessalonians 5:17-18, Phillipians 4:6).

AA11988866	I would be delighted to help you learn to speak better English, but I am uncertain how we would go about doing that.
AltO9qZ6aa	We have Virgin Media, and there are a few French channels on there. I find it quite helpful just to watch them for a while - it is surprising how much you understand! <br>  The other thing you can do is go on youtube, buy DVD's of films or tv series that you already know the jist of what is going on, so you can pick up vocab.<br>  <br>  But, the only way you will really improve is actually going to France and trying to hold a conversation with someone. That way you improve your talking and understanding skills, and will learn more colloquial phrases.|`|YaMdGqxlaa	I did the reverse. As a French native, I learned English in school but could not understand spoken English. So I started watching very boring television shows in English, and went to movies a lot. Now you can rent movies and watch them over and over again. This is an excellent way of learning. If you can get subtitles it is also very good. Songs are not easy because there is so much manerism and the lyrics are often weird.<br>  <br>  Bonne chance. Je suis persuadé que vous réussirez.|`|dpLONMkDaa	I'm learning french too and feel the same.  However, what I found really helps is to listen to french songs and stuff.  I found some on YouTube, and they are really helping me:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KVMolWHkn7E" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KVMolWHkn...</a><br>  <br>  Just listen to more stuff from POPULARFRENCHSONGS<br>  <br>  ^_^|`|26c3882c8862fb989b196c0d5e86733aaa	It can be difficult to follow speech as spoken by natives, as it is not necessarily something one is going to be hear whilst on an academic course in a non-French speaking country, and in particular, French is often spoken very fast, particularly Parisian French. It is a little more easily understood when you are hearing African or "colonial" francophones talking, but, of course, that is heard even less often. Although fluent in French, myself, however, I do find Canadian French difficult, and can only understand that, when it is subtitled in French! <br>  <br>  Perhaps your instructor might allow time, for group conversation, and comment on individual students pronunciation, or even use spoken French for the whole period of instruction.<br>  <br>  Otherwise, I feel the easiest method in non-Francophone countries is to watch subtitled French programmes, so you get to hear and see what is being said; the subtitles being in your own language, of course.<br>  <br>  If you have the chance to visit France or a French speaking country, and meet up socially with other native French speakers, perhaps in a bistro or coffee bar, you would have a chance to improve your hearing skills, as the group would appreciate your present ability, and adjust their speech to ensure you can follow the conversation. <br>  <br>  Fundamentally, it is a matter of persisting, and eventually you will obtain a good level of fluency, and widen your vocabulary in the process.|`|vbq0tFRCaa	i think we are in the same boat,<br>  im the best in my year at french but i hate listening with a passion...<br>  <br>  i think in this case it is practise that makes perfect, and i think the best way to improve is to go and listen to some real french people, in france... also getting used to the way listening exams work, and in each exercise you have to know what you are listening out for...|`|cjaEHwEvaa	I moved to france, but everyone spoke too quickly to keep up with, so i might as well have known nothing! I started watching french films, TV, radio, podcasts whatever - and after a while I found I could keep up|`|Jk5QfpcDaa	I can read French pretty well too, but listening is my weak point. I just try watching French movies and TV,  even if I didn`t understand it at first, now I`m slowly starting to get it :)<br>  <br>  You can also improve by reading written French out loud, to get a feel for what it sounds like. Best to get a native speaker to correct your pronunciation first though.<br>  <br>  Also, there are many helpful audio clips on the internet. Listen to them over and over again, `till each and every word becomes clear to you. There should be some in: <a href="http://french.about.com" rel="nofollow">http://french.about.com</a><br>  <br>  Practice makes perfect!
nw0fqXj9aa	If he was real, no. God could have easily just have forgiven the sins and all that. This is clearly a case of scapegoating, quite morbid at that.|`|hR7OsqtRaa	2 Timothy 3:16<br>  All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness.<br>  <br>  Galatians 1:11-12<br>  I want you to know, brothers, that the gospel I preached is not something that man made up. I did not receive it from any man, nor was I taught it; rather, I received it by revelation from Jesus Christ.<br>  <br>  2 Timothy 3:16 tells us that the Bible was "breathed out" by God.<br>  <br>  Galatians 1: 11-12 tells us that the gospel was a revelation from Jesus Christ himself, which was recorded by Jesus disciples and Paul.<br>  <br>  God himself chose the disciples and the people whom He knew were going to spread His word and write the Bible.<br>  <br>  The Bible was written by approximately 40 men of diverse backgrounds over the course of 4000 years. Despite being penned by different authors over 40 centuries, the Bible does not contradict itself and does not contain any errors. The authors all present different perspectives, but they all proclaim the same one true God, and the same one way of salvation—Jesus Christ (John 14:6; Acts 4:12).<br>  <br>  In John 8:58 "I tell you the truth," Jesus answered, "before Abraham was born, I am!"<br>  <br>  The above verse speaks a lot about who Jesus really is.<br>  <br>  All about Jesus and the Holy Trinity explained in the below website.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com</a><br>  <br>  Lots of videos, sermons, songs are also present, along with all of Jesus miracles, his parables, and questions on his birth, crucifixion, resurrection are answered.<br>  <br>  Many major questions on Christianity are answered with lot of examples that cannot be denied by anyone, such as,<br>  <br>  1) Did Jesus really exist? Is He God? Why did He suffer on the Cross?<br>  2) What is so special about Jesus? Why cant I just view him as an ordinary man or a teacher or a prophet? Why should I see him as God?<br>  <br>  Pasting a small part from the website.<br>  Visit the website to strengthen your faith in Jesus or to know more about Him.<br>  <br>  Jesus is God.<br>  <br>  1.Thomas calls Jesus God in John 20:28 (Note, Thomas addresses Jesus<br>  specifically.)<br>  2. Jesus is God in Heb. 1:8<br>  3. John the apostle states that Jesus was the Word which was God that became<br>  flesh (John 1:1-14)<br>  4. The phrase "Call upon the name of the LORD" (Hebrew, YHWH, i.e., Psalm<br>  116:4) used only of God on the OT, and translated into the Greek in the LXX as "Call upon the name of the LORD (greek, KURIOS)," applied to Jesus in the NT (1 Cor. 1:2) Jesus is God in flesh<br>  5. The apostle John says that Jesus was , "...calling God His own Father,<br>  making Himself equal to God," (John 5:18)<br>  6. Jesus said that He and the Father are One (John 10:30), that caused the Pharisees to<br>  claim that Jesus was making Himself out to be God.<br>  7. Jesus knew all things (John 21:17)<br>  8. Jesus knew all men (John 16:30)<br>  9. Jesus is everywhere (Matt. 28:20)<br>  10. Jesus Christ, dwells in you (Col. 1:27)<br>  11. Jesus is the exact representation of the Nature of God (Heb. 1:3)<br>  12. Jesus is eternal (Micah 5:1-2)<br>  13. Jesus gives eternal life (John 10:27-28)<br>  14. Jesus is our only Lord and Master (Jude 4)<br>  15. Jesus is called the Mighty God (Isaiah 9:6)<br>  16. Jesus is called the Mighty God (Isaiah 9:6) and "God" also be called the Mighty God in Isaiah 10:21<br>  17. Jesus is able to raise Himself from the dead (John 2:19-21)<br>  18. Jesus created all things (Col. 1:16-17), it is God who created all things by Himself (Isaiah 44:24)<br>  19. Jesus searches the hearts and minds of the people (Rev. 2:23)<br>  20. Jesus is worshiped (Matt. 2:2-11; Matt.14:33; Matt.28:9; John 9:35-38;<br>  Heb. 1:6) Only God can be worshipped (Matt. 4:10) (same Greek word for worship<br>  is used in each place.)<br>  21. In the OT God was seen (Exodus 6:2-3;Exodus 24:9-11; Num. 12:6-9; Acts7:2), yet no man can see God (Exodus 33:20; John 1:18). It was not the Father that was seen in the OT (John 6:46). Who, then were they seeing? See John 8:58.<br>  22. Jesus claimed the divine name, "I AM", for Himself in John 8:58 see<br>  Exodus 3:14.<br>  23. Jesus says you must honor him even as you honor the Father (John 5:23).<br>  24. Jesus gives life (John 5:21).<br>  25. Jesus bears witness of Himself (John 8:18;John 14:6).<br>  26. Jesus is the One who will judge you on judgement day (John 5:22-23). Only God can be the judge.<br>  27.

But, when talking hypothetical questions the answer can be anything including no.  If God had deemed it an open ended event the Messianic prophecies would have been more ambiguous or state he would conquer.  I am not sure why God chose this path, but it makes sense.  We know actions have consequences and payment must be made for mistakes and wrong doing so this method works well with our core beliefs.  But, what would have happened if the people cried out release Jesus!  Give us our King!  Perhaps we would already have lived out the millennial reign of Christ and would now already be in a new Heaven and Earth.|`|iblT1HJpaa	First, to "chris" - can you explain apostasy and how that can never be forgiven? And when that can occur in one's life? <br>  (salvation CAN be reversed for God is not a forgiving God when it comes to apostasy) <br>  <br>  <br>  Okay...........<br>  1. Jesus is not dead. He was resurrected to live eternally. (As are we when in belief) "Life everlasting" and all that.........<br>  2. Jesus did die on the Cross. Wait! How can God die? Was Jesus God? Well, now it's gotten deep.........Phil 2:6 gives us a picture of how Jesus (God Himself) emptied himself of His deity to become human. This is what makes Jesus so very, very difficult to understand. And when people do not understand, they walk away as uncomprehending. Is this God's fault? No. It's the person's fault. <br>  <br>  Jesus had to pay the price for our sins before a loving God that cannot stand the presence of sin. How then are we to find heaven when we die? We are fully sinful and wretched in God's eyes. We can never "take back" what we've done before God so God came before us (Jesus) and became our Mediator (like in a court room) to wash us of our filthy rags of sin and allow us to stand righteous and holy before a Holy God. Would you willfully take the death penalty for another person? Not your spouse or your child. Would you take the cross for a perfect stranger? This is what Jesus did for you!|`|247e16fe699fb80e444deaffc4762c81aa	yes, so that we could live<br>  we could never atone for our own sins and live|`|7mhRDbvsaa	if he didn't would there be Christianity|`|AA11957594	Yes, He had to die to take care of the sins of the world. If you believe and trust in what He done on the cross for you then your sins are forgiven. He was buried and took your sins away and He rose again the third day for your justification. Romans 4: 25 Who was delivered for our offences, and was raised again for our justification.<br>  God had to come to earth as a man so He could die and raise again. Only God could do this. It had to be perfect blood without sin to take care of sin. Hebrews 9: 22 And almost all things are by the law purged with blood; and without shedding of blood is no remission.|`|i6Mi8uWIaa	Yes. This was the will of the Father. <br>  <br>  Christ died to save us. It was part of the mystery of the Father's plan. He even told His apostles that He had to die. <br>  <br>  This does not, of course, mean that we are all automatically saved. Believers can and often do fall away from salvation. But that is why Christ's mercy is so wonderful. No matter how many times we screw up, if we ask Him to forgive us, He does. In Mark 3:29, He tells us that the ONLY unforgivable sin is blaspheme of the Holy Spirit.|`|DE4QXh2Eaa	Yes, He had to die for our sins to show that He loves us so, so much that He would die for us and He did. John 3:16"<br>  For God so -loved(s)- the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth on him should not perish, but have eternal life."<br>  :)<br>  Revelation 22:20<br>  "(20)He who is the faithful witness to all these things says, "Yes, I am coming soon!" Amen! Come, Lord Jesus!" (21) The grace of the Lord Jesus be with you all."|`|FOzN3xwzaa	Yes, to pay for our sins.  There was no other way for us to be saved.  <br>  <br>  Salvation is a FREE GIFT that happens in a split second when you believe in Jesus! It is impossible to lose or "leave" salvation (John 6:39-40, 1 John 5:13). <br>  <br>  The truth about Jesus is that the only way to be saved and to get into heaven and avoid being sent to eternal hell, is by believing in faith alone that Jesus, who is God, died for our sins on the cross as FULL PAYMENT for all our sins, and then Jesus rose from the dead (1 Corinthians 15:1-4). Believe this and you will be in heaven, no matter what! <br>  <br>  Please pray now: "Jesus, please forgive me of my sins. I believe that You died on the cross for my sins and You rose from the dead. Thank You for eternal life!" You will be in heaven with Him forever when you die. :)|`|NW1oQMtGaa	The True Jesus NEVER DIED BECAUSE HE IS AN ETERNAL AND IMPERISHABLE BEING!

It is impossible to lose or "leave" salvation (John 6:39-40, 1 John 5:13). <br>  <br>  The truth about Jesus is that the only way to be saved and to get into heaven and avoid being sent to eternal hell, is by believing in faith alone that Jesus, who is God, died for our sins on the cross as FULL PAYMENT for all our sins, and then Jesus rose from the dead (1 Corinthians 15:1-4). Believe this and you will be in heaven, no matter what! <br>  <br>  Please pray now: "Jesus, please forgive me of my sins. I believe that You died on the cross for my sins and You rose from the dead.

As God's son, Jesus worshiped only his God and Father.<br>  (1 Corinthians 15:20-28) However, now Christ has been raised up from the dead, the firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep [in death]. 21?For since death is through a man, resurrection of the dead is also through a man. 22?For just as in Adam all are dying, so also in the Christ all will be made alive. 23?But each one in his own rank: Christ the firstfruits, afterward those who belong to the Christ during his presence. 24?Next, the end, when he hands over the kingdom to his God and Father, when he has brought to nothing all government and all authority and power. 25?For he must rule as king until [God] has put all enemies under his feet. 26?As the last enemy, death is to be brought to nothing. 27?For [God] “subjected all things under his feet.” But when he says that ‘all things have been subjected,’ it is evident that it is with the exception of the one who subjected all things to him. 28?But when all things will have been subjected to him, then the Son himself will also subject himself to the One who subjected all things to him, that God may be all things to everyone.|`|hIaBgCrgaa	Wow where do you get off talking all this nonsense about Jesus.

In fact some of the best proofs that he was NOT God are contained in the book of John.  It is in John that Jesus says "The Father is greater than I am" (John 14:28)  It is in John 20:20 that Jesus said "The Father has sent me forth" (you don't send yourself).<br>  <br>  It is in John that Jesus said "‘I am ascending to my Father and your Father and to my God and your God.’” (John 20:17) showing that Jesus worshipped the same God as his followers worshipped (not that he was God).<br>  <br>  It is here in John 19:7 where his chief opposers had the opportunity to accuse Jesus of the greatest blasphemy they could think of and even then they accused him of claiming to be "God's son" not God himself.<br>  <br>  It is here in John 17:3 where Jesus prays to his Father and says that it means everlasting life to be taking in knowledge "of you, the only true God, and of the one whom you sent forth, Jesus Christ."  Two different entities. "the only true God" and the one he sent.<br>  <br>  True in John it does say that Jesus and the Father are "one", but it also makes it clear what he meant by that when he says in prayer to his Father: "20?“I make request, not concerning these only, but also concerning those putting faith in me through their word; 21?in order that they may all be one, just as you, Father, are in union with me and I am in union with you, that they also may be in union with us, in order that the world may believe that you sent me forth. 22?Also, I have given them the glory that you have given me, in order that they may be one just as we are one. 23?I in union with them and you in union with me, in order that they may be perfected into one, that the world may have the knowledge that you sent me forth and that you loved them just as you loved me"  John 17:20-23  He was talking about "one" in unity.  He was requesting that his followers all be "one" in the same way he and his Father are "one".  <br>  <br>  Trinitarians see only that "Father and I are one" and fail to understand the context, fail to see that Jesus also wanted his followers to be "one" with him and the Father.  This type of "oneness" is the same as a married couple becoming "one flesh" a unity or a harmony of purpose.<br>  <br>  True there is the scripture at John 1:1 that they point to.  But in light of all the other scriptures that is a very flimsy argument and one easily shown to be a mistranstation of a fundimental idea.   Even that they must take out of context in order to twist to make fit their ideas. Reading the context we learn that "14?So the Word became flesh and resided among us, and we had a view of his glory, a glory such as belongs to an only-begotten son from a father"  It shows here that Jesus' glory was a reflection of his Father.  and that there is a distinction. (John 1:14)  Also reading on there is further proof that Jesus is NOT God when we read in vs18?"No man has seen God at any time; the only-begotten god who is in the bosom [position] with the Father is the one that has explained him."<br>  <br>  "No man has seen God at any time".  Doesn't this itself prove that Jesus is the SON of Almighty God as he claimed?  People certainly saw Jesus.  Yes it does call him the 'only begotten god"  but the word "begotten" means "conceived".  This right here tells us that Jesus had a beginning, that he was God's SON, that he was of the same type of powerful person as God, but that he was not the Almighty God who had no beginning.<br>  <br>  Believe me, there is NO book in the Bible (even the book of John) when looked at logically and with all the context in place that proves or even indicates a Trinity as it is taught in the churches.<br>  <br>  Yes there is a unity between Jesus and his Father, Yes Jesus was a spirit as his Father is, Yes Jesus is powerful and is called a "god", but the Trinity teaching states that he had no beginning, that he is equal to the Father and that he knows all the things his Father knows. <br>  <br>  John itself disproves two of these and these two scriptures disprove the other: (Matthew 24:36 and Mark13:32)|`|sVyH0jTiaa	I agree with The silly Q&A man , because Matt 4:10<br>  10 Jesus said to him, "Away from me, Satan!

Still, he is clearly a separate spiritual person from his Father, Jehovah.

The Apostle Paul heard some disturbing reports about the Corinthians church.  He wrote this book to get them back on track.  The specifics about the verses you chose was simply written because the church was excusing sexual immorality, so harlots were beginning to take the forefront and distracting men of God from their purpose (similar to what led up to the great flood in Genesis 4).  So, to end this, Paul wrote this letter to them, and noting that those women are to keep quiet.

Why should I see him as God?<br>  <br>  Pasting a small part from the website.<br>  Visit the website to strengthen your faith in Jesus or to know more about Him.<br>  <br>  Jesus is God.<br>  <br>  1.Thomas calls Jesus God in John 20:28 (Note, Thomas addresses Jesus<br>  specifically.)<br>  2. Jesus is God in Heb. 1:8<br>  3. John the apostle states that Jesus was the Word which was God that became<br>  flesh (John 1:1-14)<br>  4. The phrase "Call upon the name of the LORD" (Hebrew, YHWH, i.e., Psalm<br>  116:4) used only of God on the OT, and translated into the Greek in the LXX as "Call upon the name of the LORD (greek, KURIOS)," applied to Jesus in the NT (1 Cor. 1:2) Jesus is God in flesh<br>  5. The apostle John says that Jesus was , "...calling God His own Father,<br>  making Himself equal to God," (John 5:18)<br>  6. Jesus said that He and the Father are One (John 10:30), that caused the Pharisees to<br>  claim that Jesus was making Himself out to be God.<br>  7. Jesus knew all things (John 21:17)<br>  8. Jesus knew all men (John 16:30)<br>  9. Jesus is everywhere (Matt. 28:20)<br>  10. Jesus Christ, dwells in you (Col. 1:27)<br>  11. Jesus is the exact representation of the Nature of God (Heb. 1:3)<br>  12. Jesus is eternal (Micah 5:1-2)<br>  13. Jesus gives eternal life (John 10:27-28)<br>  14.

In the OT God was seen (Exodus 6:2-3;Exodus 24:9-11; Num. 12:6-9; Acts7:2), yet no man can see God (Exodus 33:20; John 1:18). It was not the Father that was seen in the OT (John 6:46).

A young man from Bani Abi Mu'ait, wanted to pass in front of him, but Abu Said repulsed him with a push on his chest. Finding no alternative he again tried to pass but Abu Said pushed him with a greater force. The young man abused Abu Said and went to Marwan and lodged a complaint against Abu Said and Abu Said followed the young man to Marwan who asked him, "O Abu Said! What has happened between you and the son of your brother?" Abu Sa'id said to him, "I heard the Prophet saying, 'If anybody amongst you is praying behind something as a sutra and somebody tries to pass in front of him, then he should repulse him and if he refuses, he should use force against him for he is a satan.'

Well she should stick to her decision to keep her hijab because it is obligatory for a muslim woman. Allah ordered us to love and obey our parents but if they want us to do something that is against Islam then our obedience should be to Allah alone because He will be our judge on the last day. She can bear the burden for a while and I'm sure that if her family sees her patience, they will change their minds if they really treat her as a member of the family.<br>  <br>  I hope everything goes well.|`|NlQhkgFCaa	Remember that no Muslim can obey any creature of Allah above Allah, so in this case this woman should continue wearing her Hijab but she must explain to her family nicely that this is what she is comfortable with and she has every right to wear her Hijab as it's her choice.

To search things out and to protect her, simply the hands and the tongue (of her family) should be free from sins, so i would support her in money, clothing, food what ever she needs to get out of such enviroment..... If she has the age, i would find a suitable husband for her. <br>  <br>  Look my parents (in kufr), did the same. I removed the hijaab... Because there wasn't at that time a good strong muslim ummah that cared feesabillaah, to support me in ghair.. They state it wrong that i should respect my parents and their wishes... But i started to wear it outside the place of their residence, and searched a trustable waliy and  suitable husband and a caring muslim ummah outside the place of residence. The need for Mahram and a "ummah" was high piority for me... I couldn't deal it alone, i needed people that could say to them, "look now it is enough", "she doesn't commit wrong with covering herself, staying chaste"...  When my parents flipped, they (the ummah) said you are welcome aslong as you need. I didn't pay anything and i didn't bother them with difficulties, because i knew i was their gast, i had the choice go back to my family or stay here as a polite gast... <br>  <br>  Tell her, that my parents throw all my hijaab out of the window, and they hing in the tree, one neighboor said "that is something totally different than lingerie..."

(but i think i can see it was Per capita) and not necessarily per population. in retrospect california overturned Gay marriage. so it seems there might be less wickedness in california per capita than new york or New Orleans. i did have an audio file where a woman in the news claimed new orleans was indeed the most wicked. !!!<br>  lets earthquakes in california and floods in the southern states and blizzards on each coast. i think these are plagues of biblical wrath, but done in hopes of calling people to repentance. <br>  <br>  it is written however, every single person that joins secret combinations and does not serve God on this consecrated land, will be destroyed and cast off.!<br>  it is also written that God (the lord of hosts) will Use the Kings of the earth to destroy EACH Other. <br>  Unless THEY repent and choose Peace without war. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  .|`|VLv3Vzjnaa	You sound really angry. Perhaps the Holy Spirit is trying to convict your heart of something?<br>  <br>  Sodom and Gomorrah were not destroyed due to homosexuality. God had decided to destroy these cities long before the angels arrived at Lot's house. If all the inhabitants of these cities were gay, why would Lot offer his two daughters to the angry mob? What group of gay men would be interested in women? The threatened gang rape of angels as the ultimate act of disrespect and inhospitality may have been the last straw, but all the gay people I know do not participate in gang rapes. If one bothers to read all the references in Scripture where the sins of Sodom are listed, homosexuality is never mentioned once. Some point to "Jude" and the comments about "strange flesh." "Strange flesh" refers to angels and the sin of humans trying to have sex with angels--it has nothing to do with being gay.<br>  <br>  Homophobia is a sin like lying, stealing and murder. You should be more careful because the Bible is very clear that revilers are not going to Heaven.<br>  <br>  “…nor revilers…will inherit the kingdom of God.” (1 Corinthians 6:10)h|`|Nxolwd5Baa	if any god is gonna smite the USA it'll be the gods of the native americans, they've got it coming for that hehe!!|`|kc1IBYMRaa	I thought the whole Bush administration was a smiting and a half!|`|8465ed09a7111e9ef73563fd6ed0ec22aa	Last I checked, Denmark had the highest single parent family rate in the world...over 60%. This is not a healthy society. <br>  <br>  A friend recently asked: “How long do we have left as a society?”  In answer to that question I informed her about an interesting and comprehensive study that a renowned British anthropologist, Joseph Unwin, PhD., presented to the British Psychological Society in 1935.  Unwin sought to prove that the traditional monogamous model for marriage was not essential to the maintenance of a healthy society.  After studying 86 different cultures, across time and continents –and much to his surprise — he came to the inescapable conclusion that the traditional male-female monogamous model for marriage was indeed the best foundation for a healthy and productive society.<br>  <br>  Unwin found that societies that adopted this model typically took about three generations to reach their peak of productivity and progress.  After that, frequently, a gradual development of complacency and licentiousness would take place and what he described as an ”outburst of homosexuality” would sometimes occur.  When that happened, and the society started to move away from the traditional model of male-female monogamous marriage as its foundation, it would begin to unravel.  It would then take another three generations of deterioration from that point for the society to collapse.<br>  <br>  It is my opinion that between the end of the American Civil War and the Reconstruction of the South, proceeding through the Industrial Revolution, and continuing up until about the end of World War II in 1945, the U.S. reached its zenith.  Then came the U.S. Supreme Court’s Everson decision in 1947 which imposed an unconstitutional “Wall of Separation” between Church and State.  This directly contradicted the vision of the founding fathers.  Upon his farewell address to the nation, George Washington tried to impress upon his fellow countrymen that it was “Religion and Morality” that served as the foundation for our young nation.|`|9Ohpo5Vuaa	You doomsday loving Christians really give me a Cynical view of the Future.|`|naI5hGjHaa	I hate to break it to you but God created homosexuals.|`|OeAfpIZAaa	"Phil Zuckerman spent 14 months in Scandinavia, talking to hundreds of Danes and Swedes about religion. It wasn’t easy.<br>  <br>  Anyone who has paid attention knows that Denmark and Sweden are among the least religious nations in the world. Polls asking about belief in God, the importance of religion in people’s lives, belief in life after death or church attendance consistently bear this out.<br>  <br>  It is also well known that in various rankings of nations by life expectancy, child welfare, literacy, schooling, economic equality, standard of living and competitiveness, Denmark and Sweden stand in the first tier.<br>  <br>  Well documented though they may be, these two sets of facts run up against the assumption of many Americans that a society where religion is minimal would be, in Mr. Zuckerman’s words, “rampant with immorality, full of evil and teeming with depravity.”<br>  <br>  Which is why he insists at some length that what he and his wife and children experienced was quite the opposite: “a society — a markedly irreligious society — that was, above all, moral, stable, humane and deeply good.”<br>  <br>  Mr. Zuckerman, a sociologist who teaches at Pitzer College in Claremont, Calif., has reported his findings on religion in Denmark and Sweden in “Society Without God” (New York University Press, 2008).

It is everywhere. Advertising for example. The point is that we are human, we need to make "understanding what is right and wrong" a priority for our selves and we need to make it a habit to regret when we make an error in doing what is wrong. Those, and not perfection, are what is expected of us.

What you see in the mirror is what you will have the rest of your life.<br>  After age 18-21 we start aging. Very slowly. It continues over the rest of our lives.<br>  As the years go by, our muscles get smaller, weaker. Our bones get thinner, also weaker.<br>  <br>  Everything inside of us entirely depends on the strength of our muscles, which supports our entire body. Loose muscle strength, and we develop various medical problems with our bodies.<br>  <br>  And worse! - by age 70, we have LOST 1/3 to 1/2 our body strength! Even getting out of a chair is a challenge.<br>  <br>  So you have two choices; 1. Accept loss of muscle strength and bone mass as "a natural part of aging," which is B.S.!! or 2. Realize that you HAVE to exercise every day; even when you are young, for the rest of your life. And exercise means DAILY stretching, DAILY aerobics, DAILY light weight lifting, and ONCE-A-WEEK heavy weight lifting. With exercise, you will STILL loose muscle strength and bone density, but considerably LESS than every one else around you.<br>  <br>  I am age 56 and I can bend over and pick up a fire hydrant, swing it around while holding it, bent over!|`|nwnILcEAaa	Live it!

5c9011543d498dda04d1562813072559aa	What someone did to you was was very, very wrong, and they have clearly caused you much pain in life. Nor has your pain left you, as your post makes clear; you still hurt inside because of their wrongdoing.<br>  <br>  That's why the real issue you face is this: How will you get over these hurts from your past? You see, this person's sin has produced a tragic harvest of anger and bitterness in your soul, and they're like a poison that will only make you miserable if you don't get rid of them. Not only will it prevent you from being happy, but it also will harm your relationships. The Bible warns, "See to it ... that no bitter root grows up to cause trouble and defile many" (Hebrews 12:15).<br>  <br>  It isn't easy to get over the pain of what others did to us, particularly when we were young. But listen: God doesn't want you to be enslaved by the past! He loves you, and (unlike the person who hurt you) He wants to help you and bring healing to your heart and mind and soul.<br>  <br>  Begin life again by turning to Christ and committing your life—including your hurts—to Him. Then ask Him to help you forgive this person in your heart. No, they don't deserve it—but then we don't deserve God's forgiveness, either.

UhyvM73iaa	All answers are good about uncleanliness of dogs.  Dog's meat is haram and forbidden to eat. But we are allowed to have dogs out of our houses and in back yard or farms for protection purposes.<br>  <br>  Allahs Angeles come in the houses of good practicing Muslims to bless their homes, their children and their belongings.  If dog is inside the house, it can sense the presence of Angeles even if Angeles keep themselves invisible to dog. So dog starts barking to awake the family members. This is why Muslims keep the dogs out of our loving quarters. We do not let dogs lick faces of our children so children don't sick from germs and diseases dogs may carry in their slaviva.  <br>  <br>  Unfortuantely our people  customarily show their affection for babies and children by kissing them on their faces. And some times they make babies sick.  Think about dog.  Offcourse babies will get more sicknesses from dogs licking faces of babies and children. <br>  <br>  Allah doesn't create any creature without a purpose. Dogs are extremely helpful to people in watching their livestock and  their property from theives. Dogs can also do lots of very useful duties to humans like crime solving. Some dogs can sense humans buried under high piles of snow caused by Avalancbes in mountain areas. <br>  <br>  Unfortunaltely Muslims are too allergics to dogs because of Islamic teachings and keep dogs completely out of their lives.   Muslims do keep dogs in rural areas for protection of their live stocks and to keep thieves away.|`|mOWyzwubaa	Allah Never Commanded that dogs are haram,neither did Prophet Muhammed disobeyed Glorious Quran.<br>  bukhary and co made dogs haram , and Not Allah Allmighty,these lies are attributed to Allah Allmighty in bukhary and co's books <br>  <br>  It is interesting to know that dogs are mentioned in the Quran 5 times, not just once, 7:176, 18:18, 18:22 (three times). NO WHERE does God call the dogs dirty animals or give any indication that they should be avoided or treated the way many Muslims think they should. Actually the story of the people of the cave, in Sura 18, gives the indication. that we should appreciate. <br>  <br>  The people of the cave, 3, 5 or 7 were mentioned in the Quran and every time God insists on letting us know that their dog was there with them. Their story can be as complete without the mention of the dog, but God did, Why ? <br>  <br>  so much so that the catch these dogs bring is not haram let alone dog itself !!<br>  <br>  5:4 "They consult you concerning what is lawful for them; say, Lawful for you are all good things, including what trained dogs and falcons catch for you. You train them according God's teachings. You may eat what they catch for you, and mention God's name thereupon. You shall observe God. God is most efficient in reckoning." <br>  <br>  Fabricated hadiths contradict the Quran. Many of them narrated by Abu Hurayra. Abu Hurayra, whose name is translated as , father of the little cat, hated dogs and women and from his mouth came many hadiths that insulted women and cursed the dogs and make them undesirable animals that need to be avoided and in other hadiths killed. <br>  <br>  These fabricted hadtihs were falsely attributed to the prophet Muhammed who cannot utter but the teachings of the Quran and would only be a living example of the Quran itself. The prophet Muhammed who lived by the Quran could not have done anything but agree with the Quran,not contradict it. God gave us a great criteria to judge His truth form the man-made fabrications; <br>  <br>  "....If it were from other than God, they would have found in it numerous contradictions." 4:82|`|d1i3ac5baa	if you were to read the bukhari hadiths you would learn that mohammad didn't like dogs and had most of them in mecca killed. you are only allowed a dog for protection and working dogs. millions upon millions of people have dogs today with no ill effect. so once again the so called prophet is wrong.|`|Wgsl0hVLaa	because Allah commanded so... you do not have the right to question something Allah recommended.<br>  <br>  you can keep them for guard, or if your blind. they are dirty animals.<br>  <br>  you seem to be confused.|`|rM9QdK75aa	As Muslims we are to love and be kind to ALL of Allah's creatures. <br>  <br>  Allah tells us that the dog's saliva is highly unclean, not to mention that there are certain breeds of dogs that can seriously harm or even kill their owners without any notice. <br>  <br>  Although we must treat dogs with kindness, we are not permitted/encouraged to own them as domestic pets (like the ones who are kept in the home, and who sleep in their owners beds) (two of the reasons I mentioned above).<br>  <br>  Cats are considered to be highly sacred animals, and must be treated with kindness and respect- and yes we are permitted to have them as pets, but it's a big responsibility which when we enter, must be done for the sake of seeking Allah's pleasure.<br>  <br>  At the end of the day, only Allah knows best why these rules are in place. Just know, that there is always a Wisdom to everything Allah decrees for us.<br>  <br>  peace|`|yhPLditYaa	it is not haram to have them<br>  but u cannot keep them in your house nor any other pet n that's because they r "dirty", anything that "falls" from the pet is <<najasa>> in islam whish mean u cannot pray at that place u have to CLEAN it all over again and all..........<br>  but it is not haram<br>  <br>  hope i helped<br>  wish ya luck|`|AA10736671	Dogs are not haram who told u that? its just when u keep the dog take care that the dog don't touch the people in the house and it should be kept outside the House for health reason|`|zKQKl9mZaa	The prohibition is for spiritual cleanliness.

Dogs help keep blood pressure low.  There are many health BENEFITS to having a dog.  That the blind would use them to help around the house.  That some dogs are trained to alert deaf people of noises, such as the phone ringing.  Or that some dogs can be traind to fetch things for physcially disabled people.<br>  <br>  Or just how great it is to have them as a pet.

qky7gWosaa	God has stated in the Qur'an:<br>  <br>  And if you are in doubt about what We have revealed to Our worshipper (Muhammad), then produce a chapter like it, call your witnesses besides God if you are truthful. And if you do not do it, and you can never do it, then fear the Fire whose fuel is men and stones. It has been prepared for disbelievers. And give good news (O Muhammad) to those who believe and do good deeds, that for them are Gardens in which rivers flow. 2:23-25<br>  <br>  Ever since the Qur'an was revealed, fourteen centuries ago, no one has been able to produce a single chapter like the chapters of the Qur'an in their beauty, eloquence, splendor, wise legislation, true information, true prophecy and other perfect attributes. Also, note that the smallest chapter in the Qur'an (Chapter 108) is only ten words, yet no one has ever been able to meet this challenge then or today.<br>  <br>  Apparently, some of the disbelieving Arabs tried to meet this challenge to prove that Muhammad (Saw) was not a true Prophet. Why did they fail?<br>  <br>  I am 100% sure that the Qur'an is the best book. It’s not a question of what I consider, but what Allah has stated Himself in the Qur’an. He declared that the Qur’an will stay protected, and it is a miracle that not a single word has been distorted in the book itself. The Qur’an’s original language is Arabic, and there are numerous Hafiz Muslims who can recite the Qur’an flawlessly.  So even if the Qur’an gets tarnished (God forbid), Hafiz Muslims can easily notice where it has become faulty.<br>  <br>  Asker: Have you read the Fur’qan? Well this was a failing attempt to resemble the Qur’an, because none of the 'surahs' from the Fur'qan resembled one from the true Qur’an. There are Muslims who believe that the Qur’an has been faulty, and they also deny two surahs from the Noble Qur’an. My answer is not biased; I personally believe that the Qur’an is incomparable to other revealed books such as the Bible and Torah; however these books have definitely been despoiled, whereas the Qur’an has not. But do your research, because there are numerous Muslims who believe that the Qur’an is corrupted.<br>  <br>  Cannicus - Give me an objective proof that the Bible has not been tampered with. I am very eager to hear your retort to this, since you claim that Muslims have no objective proof whatsoever.<br>  <br>  Asker -  Well make your question clearer next time, that would be helpful for a start =)<br>  <br>  Asker – Since it depends on the individual, yes I do think it comes to being a subjective matter. But the Qur’an is a word of God, and in my opinion, it is incomparable to other books.|`|mOWyzwubaa	Alahmdolillahe Yes Glorious Quran is The Best Book, but for majority this just a lip service,they complaint,<br>  <br>  Quran doesnt have this Quran doesnt have that, Quran is not detailed,<br>  Quran just gives barest minimum instructions, too many question they raise, why ?<br>  <br>  because they find every thing in man made books of bukhary and co.<br>  a terrible hypocrisy|`|Ieqp1kIhaa	Dear,<br>  <br>  Peace be upon you.<br>  <br>  In the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.<br>  <br>  To proof Al-Qur'an the Best Book listen to what written by Charles Francis Potter;<br>  <br>  "It is "MORE" read than any other book in the world. The Christian Bible may be the best seller, but nearly 250 million followers of the Prophet Muhammad read or recite long sections of the Alcoran five times a day, every day of their lives, from the time they can talk." (Charles Francis Potter, THE FAITHS MEN LIVE BY, KINGSWOOD, SURREY, 1955, page 81). [Today, the Followers of Prophet Muhammad is at about 900 million].<br>  <br>  Wabillahhitaufiq Walhidayah Wassalamu'alaikum Warahmatullahhi Wabarakatuh.|`|Kiv4D2aWaa	"When you say 'No one can produce a chapter like one in the Qur'an', why do you think so? I mean, *you* think when you see an attempt at making a chapter like one in the Qur'an that it is not like the Qur'anic chapters. Another person who's a non-Muslim might think it is like the Qur'anic chapters. Isn't that subjectivity?"<br>  <br>  No. People said Muhammad's claim to prophethood and the truthfulness of Islam are only Muslims' subjective opinion. So Allah produces the challenge ("challenge"*) to prove that Islam is objectively the religion of Allah. Now, he didn't foresee that people would continue to claim the challenge is a legitimate one only in Muslims' subjective opinion. He didn't address that. So, if Allah didn't answer that, we don't question it.|`|8179167c86c2a954054ffc06276ae83caa	subjective.<br>  apparantly no one can write a verse like it. however, when satan cast a revelation on muhammad's tongue, it did sound exactly the same. then when allah came and cancelled satan's words, they still sound exactly the same. imagine that - allah and satan sound exactly the same.<br>  <br>  also, i say 1 corinthians 13 is greater than any quran sura, not like it but greater! no muslim will agree. but should we have a vote? i'll ask all the christians and we'll out vote all the muslims by 1/2 a billion or so votes. can you see what a weak challenge that is?<br>  <br>  could muhammad bring a play like shakespeare? a theory like newton? an equation like einstein? surely muhammad brought nothing beyond human ability to create. <br>  in comparison, the bible standard is perfect prophecy. this is something actually divine. and every prophecy comes true exactly, even the ones about islam.|`|iH7ZB5Soaa	The Qur’an invited the Arabian orators of that time to reply to even one of the shortest of the Suras. It challenged them with the decree of:<br>  'And if you are in doubt about what We have revealed to Our servant, then produce a Sura resembling it.'<br>  It also said: “If you do not believe, you shall be damned and shall go to Hell.” It provoked them intensely. It smashed their pride in fearsome manner. It was contemptuous of their arrogant minds. It condemned them firstly to eternal extinction and then to eternal extinction in Hell, as well as to worldly extinction. It said: “Either dispute me, or you and your property shall perish.”<br>  If it had been possible to dispute the Qur’an, is it at all possible that while there was an easy solution like disputing it with one or two lines and nullifying the claim, they should have chosen the most dangerous and most difficult, the way of war? Yes, is it at all possible that that clever people, that politically-minded nation, who at one time were to govern the world through politics, should have abandoned the shortest, easiest, and most light way, and chosen the most dangerous, which was going to cast their lives and all their property into peril? For if their literary figures had been able to dispute it with a few words, the Qur’an would have given up its claim, and they would have been saved from material and moral disaster. Whereas they chose a perilous, lengthy road like war. That means it was not possible to dispute in by word; it was impossible, so they were compelled to fight it with the sword.|`|zHNPTV67aa	first of all the quran is not just abook it is the word of allah also how many other religion do u no were you can take 5 different people from allover the world from each different religions and ask each one of them who has memorised there bible/quran/torah and ask all of them to recite there book from start to finish and see if they all get i right from start to finsh i guarentee you that the jews would start reciting different verses as the torah has been changed so many times and the christians have so many different versions of the bible the would be messed but us muslims from surah fatitah to surah an nas(the first n last chapters) each muslim could recite the same as the other as ALLAH says HE HAS PERSERVED HES BOOK SO NO ONE CAN CHANGE IT .                       say no more|`|NlQhkgFCaa	I believe objectively that the Glorious Quran is the proven word of God <br>  <a href="http://www.55a.net/firas/english/" rel="nofollow">http://www.55a.net/firas/english/</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.miraclesofthequran.com/index.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.miraclesofthequran.com/index....</a>  <br>  <a href="http://www.islam-guide.com/bqs/" rel="nofollow">http://www.islam-guide.com/bqs/</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.load-islam.com/wel_islam.php?topic_id=3" rel="nofollow">http://www.load-islam.com/wel_islam.php?...</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.islamreligion.com/category/75/" rel="nofollow">http://www.islamreligion.com/category/75...</a>|`|Ipheh638aa	it's not just any book<br>  it's very detailing and gives us inspiration|`|BVVvb8Ieaa	It is kind of a silly challenge.<br>  <br>  The Vedas are very very beautiful, Persian poetry, Khalid Gibbon, ect.|`|xtI9RmNZaa	I say this when i read Quran.<br>  No one can write even a single verse like  QURAN.<br>  IT is the best book showing the right path.|`|bfWcfCKXaa	LMAO - Muslims have no "objective" proof for this statement. None whatsoever. It is totally subjective. Muslims will engage in every logical fallacy such as "circulus in demonstrando," equivocation, "ignoratio elenchi," "argumentum ad populo," etc. to make their sad claims. But no "objective" proof whatsoever - NONE! Never have been able to do it! In fact, many do not know the difference between an objective and subjective statement when it comes to their faith. If they "feel" it, it must be true! I keep pointing this fact out here at Ramadan. I keep pointing out that all the claims here about Islam are "subjectivities" based on no hard, factual evidence. Yet people believe what they say as if they witnessed it as much as the sun rise every morning. They "know" Muhammad heard an angel speak to him because??????? Oh, I know - Koran says so! How is that for an answer. And how do they know that what Koran says is true??? Allah revealed it. And how do you know that Allah revealed it? Koran says so. And so the argument goes or variations on it in a "circulus in demonstrando." And then when you back them in a logical corner, they accuse you of refusing to submit to the obvious will of Allah and then stick their fingers in their ears and sing: "La, la, la, la, la, la, la, I can't here you infidel, la, la, la, la.laaaaaaaa!"

423b37222c9aecc6d4e09218cb231a06aa	NOOOOOOOOOOOO !<br>  <br>  First of all let us understand the meaning of ‘Curse’ (lanat). Lanat is a prayer to deprive someone of Divine Mercy. We find that 41 verses of the Holy Quran sanction Lanat. If it had not been so, how could we have known what is from the Shaitan and what is from Rahmaan (The Beneficent Lord)? <br>  <br>  It is upto you to study the biographies of Muawiyah and Yazeed and decide for yourself whether they deserve curses or not. And whatever praises that you find for Muawiyah in narrations and history are fabricated. <br>  <br>  This is testified by Asqalani in Fathul Bari from Ahmed ibne Hanbal. He says: "I asked my father what he thought of Ali and Muawiyah." He pondered for some time and said, "Know that! Ali had many enemies. His enemies searched for some fault or the other in him. But when they failed, they came together to a person who had fought him and began to praise him excessively in their enmity of Ali (a.s.). He said: "This points towards the fact that all that has been related from the fazail (virutes) of Muawiyah is fabricated."<br>  <br>  (Ibne Hajar Asqalani’s Fathul Bari fi Sharhe Sahih Bukhari)<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.oneummah.net/understand/" rel="nofollow">http://www.oneummah.net/understand/</a>|`|KqiiT1WSaa	Taking things out of context.<br>  <br>  Just like the atheists.<br>  <br>  Well done.<br>  <br>  earlier one shia was showing us the similarities between Hinduism and shia-ism. Now you are showing us the similarities between atheism and shia-ism. Well done !! keep it up !|`|Bb6fQtl0aa	The reason why the Shi'a are not accepted nor reconciled with is because they have introduced beliefs and practices into Islam that were never taught by the Prophet, peace be upon him, never taught by his family, or his companions. Rather they have changed Islam from it's original perfected form and thusly, innovated a way of life that leads to Hellfire. This is not a dispute between a trivial "this" and "that", it is a serious issue dealing with the difference between the Straight Path to Paradise and the crooked paths that lead to punishment in this life and the next. May Allaah rectify our condition and affairs.<br>  <br>  With regards to Shee'ism, then it is not the Islam that was taught by Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him. Rather, they are a group that have exaggerated the status of the noble family of the Prophet, peace be upon him, to the extent that they build shrines devoted to their worship along with Allaah. This is shirk, polytheism, the greatest crime a human being can commit in the sight of Allaah.<br>  <br>  The proper way to practice Islam is to follow the understanding of the Qur'aan and the Prophetic life example that was actually taught by Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him, and actually lived by the Prophet, peace be upon him, his family, and his companions.<br>  <br>  All beliefs and acts of worship that oppose this way are affairs that lead away from Paradise and lead towards Hellfire.<br>  <br>  It is not permissible to worship Allaah with acts of worship that did not exist in the time of the Prophet, peace be upon him (such as pilgrimage to Karbala, calling upon 'Ali or other human beings for help who are dead or absent, building shrines dedicated to saints, etc...) And it is not permissible to interpret the Qur'aan with meanings that oppose what the Prophet, peace be upon him, actually taught.<br>  <br>  Remember, the main goal of every Muslim is to enter Paradise and to avoid torment in the Hellfire. The main goal is not unity in this life for the sake of "unity". If the Shee'ah have chosen for themselves a path to destruction, then it is not in any Muslim's interest to "unite" with them. Rather the sincere Muslim should advise them to return to the right guidance that Allaah created us and them for, and if they refuse, then other Muslims should be warned against falling into their severe errors. By this way, with Allaah's permission, we preserve the correct practice of Islam for ourselves and for future generations who seek to worship Allaah correctly.<br>  <br>  Whether the Shia' as a whole will repent and return to the Straight Path...? Allaah knows best. This splitting amongst the Muslims is a test from Allaah to see who will sincerely and correctly follow His religion. He guides whom He wills and He leaves to stray whom He wills and Allaah is All-Knowing, All-Wise.<br>  <br>  ADDITIONAL NOTE: "Fitnah" Makers?<br>  <br>  It is oppression to call a Muslim who clarifies the difference between true Islam and deviant ideologies a "fitnah" maker. The people responsible for making "fitnah" are those who alter the pure religion of Allaah and turn it to something that leads our brothers and sisters to Hell.<br>  <br>  If I knew someone who was in danger of being murdered, would I be considered a "fitnah" maker if I were to alert that person to danger? No. I would not be considered a fitnah maker, even if the murderer was a Muslim.<br>  <br>  And innovation in religion and the threat of Hellfire is more serious a danger to a person than murder and thusly a Muslim has more right to be warned against it in the clearest terms possible.|`|SCkhQc2Caa	Saheeh Muslim Book 031, Number 5915:<br>  <br>   Amir b.

You don't need your parents to agree to or support the marriage because it's really none of their business.  If you're adults and old enough to marry then be adults and do what you want instead of caving to parents wishes.  If you're a Muslims man then you are allowed to marry another religious woman who is Christian or Jewish.  If a person marries someone of another faith it doesn't change or affect your faith as long as you are both respectful of each other.|`|AA12350023	I assume you are a guy by your avatar..

That to me as a women would encourage me to learn more about my fiances faith.. I probably would convert for him.. thats just my thoughts on the matter..<br>  Pray for your women, maybe she will convert to Islam.. Show her and guide her, but never pressure her to convert..

yPfxcIb9aa	most likely, cos when you think about it, all of the tactics that Mugabe used to pressurise people into voting for him (his 'henchmen' stood outside of the polling station to ensure that they voted for him). Then Tsvangirai supposedly won the elections, so Mugabe demanded another election, but this time, he upped the ante with making sure that he won- which he did!<br>  <br>  then for ages, other countries were pressurising Mugabe to enter a power-sharing deal, which when that came through, Mugabe wasn't allowing Tsvangirai to make any crucial decisions, and Mugabe was appointing his own main politicians (many of whom were responsible for forcing most Zimbabweans into voting for Mugabe).<br>  <br>  When the cholera outbreak happened, he denied that it was happening- claiming that it was the West that was making it all up so they had a reason for war, meanwhile the country had little or no food, yet Mugabe still managed to have a full feast for his birthday!<br>  <br>  Shortly after Tsvangirai was made Prime Minister, one of his to aides was arrested for 'treason'- he was white, which as we know, Mugabe is forcing white people out of Zimbabwe.<br>  <br>  Next thing we know, Tsvangirai and his wife were involved in a car crash, involving a large truck (they are massive!), so no doubt, it was an attempt on Tsvangirai's life as well!<br>  <br>  Mugabe knows his days are counting down!|`|magnUFbjaa	Probably!!!!

In fact, Jesus PLEADED GODS message ever so exhaustedly, to people who continually turned the other way in fear that he would change their ever so evil and transgressing ways.<br>  <br>  Please read the following then go to the website down below:<br>  <br>  ENCYCLOPEDIA BRITANNICA<br>  <br>  notes that none of the sources of his life and work can be traced to Jesus himself; he did not leave a single known written word. Also, there are no contemporary accounts written of his life and death.

I did not receive it from any man, nor was I taught it; rather, I received it by revelation from Jesus Christ.<br>  <br>  2 Timothy 3:16 tells us that the Bible was "breathed out" by God.<br>  <br>  Galatians 1: 11-12 tells us that the gospel was a revelation from Jesus Christ himself, which was recorded by Jesus disciples and Paul.<br>  <br>  God himself chose the disciples and the people whom He knew were going to spread His word and write the Bible.<br>  <br>  The Bible was written by approximately 40 men of diverse backgrounds over the course of 4000 years. Despite being penned by different authors over 40 centuries, the Bible does not contradict itself and does not contain any errors. The authors all present different perspectives, but they all proclaim the same one true God, and the same one way of salvation—Jesus Christ (John 14:6; Acts 4:12).<br>  <br>  In John 8:58 "I tell you the truth," Jesus answered, "before Abraham was born, I am!"<br>  <br>  The above verse speaks a lot about who Jesus really is.<br>  <br>  All about Jesus and the Holy Trinity explained in the below website.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com</a><br>  <br>  Lots of videos, sermons, songs are also present, along with all of Jesus miracles, his parables, and questions on his birth, crucifixion, resurrection are answered.<br>  <br>  Many major questions on Christianity are answered with lot of examples that cannot be denied by anyone, such as,<br>  <br>  1) Did Jesus really exist? Is He God? Why did He suffer on the Cross?<br>  2) What is so special about Jesus? Why cant I just view him as an ordinary man or a teacher or a prophet?

The apostle John says that Jesus was , "...calling God His own Father,<br>  making Himself equal to God," (John 5:18)<br>  6.

We ask here that all the world may learn to know and adore the attributes of our God, who is so great and so holy. We ask that he may be known, loved and adored by pagans, Turks, Jews, barbarians and all infidels; that all men may serve and glorify him by a living faith, a staunch hope, a burning charity, and by the renouncing of all erroneous beliefs. In short, we pray that all men may be holy because our God himself is holy.<br>  <br>  "Thy kingdom come."<br>  <br>  That is to say: May you reign in our souls by your grace, during life, so that after death we may be found worthy to reign with thee in thy kingdom, in perfect and unending bliss; that we firmly believe in this happiness to come; we hope for it and we expect it, because God the Father has promised it in his great goodness, and because it was purchased for us by the merits of God the Son; and it has been made known to us by the light of the Holy Spirit.<br>  <br>  "Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven."<br>  <br>  As Tertullian says, this sentence does not mean in the least that we are afraid of people thwarting God's designs, because nothing whatsoever can happen without divine Providence having foreseen it and having made it fit into his plans beforehand. No obstruction in the whole world can possibly prevent the will of God from being carried out. Rather, when we say these words, we ask God to make us humbly resigned to all that he has seen fit to send us in this life. We also ask him to help us to do, in all things and at all times, his holy will, made known to us by the commandments, promptly, lovingly and faithfully, as the angels and the blessed do in heaven.<br>  <br>  "Give us this day our daily bread."<br>  <br>  Our Lord teaches us to ask God for everything that we need, whether in the spiritual or the temporal order. By asking for our daily bread, we humbly admit our own poverty and insufficiency, and pay tribute to our God, knowing that all temporal goods come from his Providence. When we say bread we ask for that which is necessary to live; and, of course that does not include luxuries. We ask for this bread today, which means that we are concerned only for the present, leaving the morrow in the hands of Providence. And when we ask for our daily bread, we recognize that we need God's help every day and that we are entirely dependent upon him for his help and protection.<br>  <br>  "Forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us."<br>  <br>  Every sin, says St. Augustine and Tertullian, is a debt which we contract with God, and he in his justice requires payment down to the last farthing. Unfortunately we all have these sad debts. No matter how many they may be, we should go to God with all confidence and with true sorrow for our sins, saying, "Our Father who art in heaven, forgive us our sins of thought and those of speech, forgive us our sins of commission and of omission which make us infinitely guilty in the eyes of thy justice. "We dare to ask this because thou art our loving and merciful Father, and because we have forgiven those who have offended us, out of obedience to you and out of charity. "Do not permit us, in spite of our infidelity to thy graces, to give in to the temptations of the world, the devil, and the flesh.<br>  <br>  <br>  "But deliver us from evil."<br>  <br>  The evil of sin, from the evil of temporal punishment and of everlasting punishment, which we have rightly deserved.<br>  <br>  "Amen." (so be it)<br>  <br>  This word at the end of the Our Father is very consoling, and St. Jerome says that it is a sort of seal of approbation that God puts at the end of our petitions to assure us that he will grant our requests, as though he himself were answering: "Amen! May it be as you have asked, for truly you have obtained what you asked for." That is what is meant by this word: Amen.|`|db7df25ea31227e5641d5c32d43c3bcdaa	Mat 6:9  After this manner therefore pray ye: Our Father which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name. <br>  Mat 6:10  Thy kingdom come.

Rather it serves as a model prayer for His followers. It was not intended as a ritualistic prayer for regular recital, but rather a guide for praying "after this manner." The Lord Jesus gave many other commands to pray (Matthew 7:7-11; 9:38; 17:20; 18:19,20; 21:21,22; 26:41; Luke 18:1,7; John 14:13,14; 15:7,16; 16:23,24)--all of which give further instruction on the vital subject of how believers should pray.<br>  <br>  6:10 Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven.<br>  This is the first occurrence of the word "will" in the New Testament, and it is noteworthy that it refers to God's will--not man's. The last occurrence is in Revelation 4:11, there translated as "pleasure," but again referring to God's will.<br>  <br>  6:11 Give us this day our daily bread.<br>  This is the only occurrence in the New Testament of the Greek word here translated "daily" (except for the same sentence in Luke 11:3). The Lord notes here that we should ask for our physical needs one day at a time.<br>  <br>  6:12 And forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors.<br>  <br>  6:13 And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil: For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, for ever. Amen.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps?|`|08ae3d05d7e2c113fc49e08dbdcfa338aa	Father, <br>     Reveal who you are. <br>     Set the world right. <br>     Keep us alive with three square meals. <br>     Keep us forgiven with you and forgiving others. <br>     Keep us safe from ourselves and the Devil."|`|2059629ba703ea51b813a449b0cb4431aa	By "translate line from line" did you actually mean "interpret, line for line"?<br>  <br>  Is this for a class?

Pray for our leaders that God's spirit would lead them to do what is right according to the will of God.<br>  <br>  Give us this day our daily bread = (While many of us do not understand this)  We should thank God that he will give us what we need and sustain us.  Thank him for the abundant blessings he has poured out on you above mere substance.  Thank him for being your provider.<br>  <br>  And forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us = Repent of any and all sins that you knowingly committed and if there are any you are not aware of pray for enlightenment to see them and the strength to avoid them.  Then forgive those that have wronged you so that they too may know the love of the Lord and they will not have to endure extra hardship on your account.  Pray that they may come to the light and share in your inheritance.<br>  <br>  And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil = recognize your weakness and ask God to make you a better person.  Pray that you become more like Jesus and avoid every appearance of evil.  Also acknowledge that God will deliver you from evil in one way or another.  Pray for strength during trials and temptations and courage to do Gods will no matter how painful.<br>  <br>  For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, for ever and ever amen = Praise God for his kingdom, power and glory and that his reign will never end and amen means may it be so.  In short, end your prayer with praise and hymns to God.  Worship your creator and deliverer.|`|50UbJp14aa	Our Father, who art in Heaven, Hallowed be they name, thine kingdom come, thine will be down on earth as it is in heaven, Give us this Day our Daily bread and Forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us, For thine is thy kingdom, the power and the glory, forever and ever Amen|`|srUuoCwcaa	Translate how so?

Bb6fQtl0aa	"The Shee'ah According to the Scholars of Islaam"<br>  <a href="http://abulhaarith.wordpress.com/category/the-raafidah-sheeah/" rel="nofollow">http://abulhaarith.wordpress.com/categor...</a><br>  <br>  __<br>  <br>  The reason why the Shi'a are not accepted nor reconciled with is because they have introduced beliefs and practices into Islam that were never taught by the Prophet, peace be upon him, never taught by his family, or his companions. Rather they have changed Islam from it's original perfected form and thusly, innovated a way of life that leads to Hellfire. This is not a dispute between a trivial "this" and "that", it is a serious issue dealing with the difference between the Straight Path to Paradise and the crooked paths that lead to punishment in this life and the next. May Allaah rectify our condition and affairs.<br>  <br>  With regards to Shee'ism, then it is not the Islam that was taught by Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him. Rather, they are a group that have exaggerated the status of the noble family of the Prophet, peace be upon him, to the extent that they build shrines devoted to their worship along with Allaah. This is shirk, polytheism, the greatest crime a human being can commit in the sight of Allaah.<br>  <br>  The proper way to practice Islam is to follow the understanding of the Qur'aan and the Prophetic life example that was actually taught by Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him, and actually lived by the Prophet, peace be upon him, his family, and his companions.<br>  <br>  All beliefs and acts of worship that oppose this way are affairs that lead away from Paradise and lead towards Hellfire.<br>  <br>  It is not permissible to worship Allaah with acts of worship that did not exist in the time of the Prophet, peace be upon him (such as pilgrimage to Karbala, calling upon 'Ali or other human beings for help who are dead or absent, building shrines dedicated to saints, mourning on ashura, etc...) And it is not permissible to interpret the Qur'aan with meanings that oppose what the Prophet, peace be upon him, actually taught.<br>  <br>  Remember, the main goal of every Muslim is to enter Paradise and to avoid torment in the Hellfire. The main goal is not unity in this life for the sake of "unity". If the Shee'ah have chosen for themselves a path to destruction, then it is not in any Muslim's interest to "unite" with them. Rather the sincere Muslim should advise them to return to the right guidance that Allaah created us and them for, and if they refuse, then other Muslims should be warned against falling into their severe errors. By this way, with Allaah's permission, we preserve the correct practice of Islam for ourselves and for future generations who seek to worship Allaah correctly.<br>  <br>  Whether the Shia' as a whole will repent and return to the Straight Path...? Allaah knows best. This splitting amongst the Muslims is a test from Allaah to see who will sincerely and correctly follow His religion. He guides whom He wills and He leaves to stray whom He wills and Allaah is All-Knowing, All-Wise.<br>  <br>  ADDITIONAL NOTE: "Fitnah" Makers?<br>  <br>  It is oppression to call a Muslim who clarifies the difference between true Islam and deviant ideologies a "fitnah" maker. The people responsible for making "fitnah" are those who alter the pure religion of Allaah and turn it to something that leads our brothers and sisters to Hell.<br>  <br>  If I knew someone who was in danger of being murdered, would I be considered a "fitnah" maker if I were to alert that person to danger? No. I would not be considered a fitnah maker, even if the murderer was a Muslim.<br>  <br>  And innovation in religion and the threat of Hellfire is more serious a danger to a person than murder and thusly a Muslim has more right to be warned against it in the clearest terms possible.|`|e3PWZYsAaa	Salam,<br>  <br>  first of all about Imam Hussain (as)..........<br>  what happened to Imam Hussain (as) never happened to any one else on the face of the earth.......<br>  <br>  the heavens and the earth cried blood for Imam Hussain (as)......<br>  ........this is even reported in sunni books:<br>  <br>  “On the day of the martyrdom of al-Hussein (AS) the sky rained blood . . . .” <br>  <br>  See<br>  <br>  Thakhaa'er al-Uqba pp 144, 145, 150. <br>  <br>  Al-Sawaa'eq al-Muhriqah pp 116, 192 . . . . . .<br>  <br>  “There was not a stone which was not lifted but underneath it was found blood . . . ” <br>  <br>  See<br>  <br>  Al-Sawaa'eq al-Muhriqah pp 116, 192. <br>  <br>  Tathkirat-ul-Khawaas p 284,<br>  <br>  Tafsir ibn Kathir vol. 9, p 162 . . . . .<br>  <br>  <br>  but we love all the 14 infalliable people.....<br>  these people are:<br>  Prophet Mohammad (PBUH&HF)<br>  Bibi Fatima (as)<br>  and the 12 Imams (PBUT)<br>  <br>  <br>  about Ayesha.......<br>  a lot of Shias dont't like the fact that she fought Imam Ali (as).....<br>  <br>  In Holy Quran Allah tells the wives of Prophets<br>  "And stay in your houses. Bedizen not yourselves with the bedizenment of the Time of ignorance.." (Quran 33:33) <br>  <br>  Aisha was required by the above verse of Quran to stay at home, but she disobeyed the order of God. All of other wives of the Prophet obeyed the above injunction with the exception of Aisha. Historians relate that Hafsa Bint Umar wanted to go with her for the battle of the Camel. But her brother, Abdullah, reproached her and recited the aforementioned verse to her. Hafsa then canceled her plans. Aisha, however, rode the camel that that Prophet had forbidden her from riding and warned her about the barking of al-Haw'ab's dogs:<br>  <br>  The Prophet (PBUH&HF) said to his wives: "I wonder which one of you will be the instigator of the Camel Affair, at whom the dogs of Haw'ab will bark, and she will be the one who has deviated from the straight path. As to you Humayra (i.e., Aisha), I have warned you in that regard." <br>  <br>  Sunni references:<br>  <br>  * History of Ibn al-Athir, v3, p120<br>  * al-Imamah wa al-Siyasah, by Ibn Qutaybah<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  and as for the 3rd part of your question.........<br>  <br>  as i have always said.......<br>  ........we do not need to believe in the exact same things to be united<br>  we should want the same thing........<br>  ............and we should all want unity............<br>  <br>  Peace.|`|WmU7jhObaa	there hypocrits they pick and choose who to worship in the prophets(pbuh) family. since Ayesha(ra) is Abu Bakr(ra) daughter they choose not to like her, even though she is the prophet(pbuh) wife. if he did not like her he would have divorced her and not die by her side. it also looks like they hate his Companions(ra). without having any companions Islam would of died in Makkah.|`|rM9QdK75aa	Assalamu Alaikum,<br>  If we wish to speak in terms of Sunni vs Shia then there are 2 things that stick out like a sore thumb-<br>  <br>  -One group claims to 'hate' certain companions(may Allah be pleased with them) of the Prophet (peace be upon him).<br>  <br>  -And the other group doesn't, and is repelled by the thought of it.<br>  <br>  Who's who?

And some things like controlling the world is solely for Allah.<br>  But in shiaism these imams and figures r greater than prophets.<br>  <br>  So as a result  shias, bcoz this wrong concept of imamat, reacted very stongly who ever had any conflict with Ali (RA)<br>   <br>  Their hate of sahabah is based on two types of narrations ,incident .<br>  <br>  1) One type of narations which r fabricated against sahabah and has no base at all .<br>  <br>  2) second type of narrations which shows the arguments and differences of opinion  among the sahabah and Ali(ra)  .<br>  <br>  Muslims take second type of narration as a natural disagreement which occurs between two sahabah (none of them is infallible), but in the sight of shias this is a conflict between a divine, infallible person i.e. Hazrat Ali (RA) and a fallible person i.e. the other sahabah.<br>  <br>  Edit :; So we can not resolve any issue with shias unless the position of Ali (RA) as a infallible imam or a fallible(but pious and Muttaqi) is decided .|`|TXyFtQ9uaa	First; of all the only people that maybe regarded to some degree as being infallable are the prophets(pbut) for they got their revelation from the creator himself (though on issues outside the religion they may very well have made mistakes because they are only human) others from creation can and have MADE MISTAKES !, THE ONLY ONE FREE FROM SUCH IMPERFECTIONS IS ALLAH THE LORD OF THE WORLDS ! SO WITH THIS BELIEF OF THEIRS THEY COMMIT BLASPHEMY (SHIRK) !<br>  Second; they object to the first caliph of Islam taking office ie. Abu Bakr however if Ali the cousin of the prophet was the first caliph instead of being the forth this would be the establishment of Kingship a concept denounced by Allah in Islam. The following verse of the Quran proves this "Kings whenever they enter a land they corrupt it and they make the most noble of men the lowest of the low" SO THEY ALSO DENY KADR (DESTINY the sixth pillar of Islam) <br>  Third; they claim to love ahalbaiyt ie. the household of the prophet(pbuh) yet they insult Aisha(ra) his wife calling her a harlott, Omar ibn Al khattab(ra) the second caliph of Isalm also an inlaw calling him a sodomite amongst the other evils they utter.The prophet(pbuh) said "don't speak ill of the sahabah for if you gave away gold the size of mount uhud it would not measure up to the sacrifice my sahabah made" SO THEY ALSO HATE THE PEOPLE OF ISLAM A TRAIT OF HYPOCRICY <br>  Forth; they introduce things and concepts into the Islamic faith that Prophet Mohammed(pbuh) did not either practice or sanction. Which parent in their right state of mind will take a razor blade and cut their child's head and their own then bash their own heads with blood pouring down their heads under the pretext of being more zealous than the rest of the Muslims?(the festival of blood). Name one single hadith that the prophet(pbuh) ordered his ummah to fill a bag full of large stones and bash yourself on the back? In Islam when you do something wrong you pray a 2 rakah salah and ask Allah to forgive you, this is called taubah; not the madness shia do that I've illustrated. THEY WITH THESE ACTIONS TELL LIES ON ALLAH AND HIS MESSENGER<br>  Fifth; Historically since the inception of their so called faith they have always stabbed sunni Muslims in the back and to this day remain treacherous. If they considered themselves the bretheren of sunnis they would never have broken away from the rest of the ummah. SO THEY ATTEMPT TO HIDE THEIR GUILT OF TREACHERY BY BLAMING OTHERS OF TREACHERY ie. bearing False witness. <br>  Sixth; They also claim a third of the Quran is missing, the remainder of which will be brought back by their mahdi so the Muslim world including the shia were not properly guided by Allah's incomplete word; so with this belief Allah broke his promise to protect the Quran Therefore the Lord of the worlds IS A LIAR IN SHIA IDEOLOGY.<br>  Seventh; three of the caliphs of Islam are regarded by the shia as being the idols of Quraish and their mahdi will reserect them and crucify them infront of everyone to see. so Abu bakr, Omar and Uthman(pbut) are regarded  as DISBELIEVERS BY THE SHIA FOR THEM TO BE CRUCIFIED BY THEIR MAHDI.<br>  At the very least they are a stupid people who lack basic under standing of all the components of the Islamic faith; at worst these people are the worst of hypocrites and enemies of Islam.For further details consult a Sheihk of knowledge who is not shia or a modernist.

5vqo3XzHaa	Yes he does.  Revelation 2:12-13 - "And to the angel of the church in Pergamos write; These things saith he which hath the sharp sword with two edges; I know thy works, and where thou dwellest, even where SATAN'S SEAT is: and thou holdest fast my name, and hast not denied my faith, even in those days wherein Antipas was my faithful martyr, who was slain among you, WHERE SATAN DWELLETH."  Not only does Satan have a dwelling at Pergamos, but he also has a throne there. The KJV word “seat” in verse 12 is the common word for throne (it is thronos in Greek).  Pergamos (sometimes spelled Pergamum), is a city near the coast in Asia Minor which is currently in modern Turkey.  God bless!!!|`|2WnbP80Taa	Yes, for now~~it resides in Hell; will soon be destroyed though.|`|MXYWSsM7aa	Satan will try to set up his throne when he is cast down from the heavens to set up his kingdom here on earth as the Anti-Christ. He will succeed for only a little while and then be cast down to hell where he will be tormented for eternity. <br>  Rev. 12, talks about the man-child(overcomers) and how satan will try to devour that child but the child was taken up to God's throne. Then there will be a "wing clipping party" so to speak and satan will be cast down to earth. v.12 says, "Therefore rejoice ye heavens and ye that dwell in them. Woe to the inhabiters of the earth and of the sea! for the devil is come down unto you, having great wrath, because he knoweth that he hath but a short time." This is the time when heavy persecution shall come to the Church but the patience of the saints will prevail.<br>  Satan will never get what he wants not even an everlasting  throne in Hell.<br>  Thanks Brad and God Bless. :)|`|3DjUX8etaa	Hello Brad! You ask a question that has no easy answer. Christian tradition states that Satan does have a throne which he sits upon. But, the problem with much traditional teaching is that it is not always biblical in nature. This is one example of such an instance. What further complicates this traditional belief is the Jewish perspective on Satan. They believe that unlike humans, angels do not have free will which makes it impossible for them to rebel or act against God. They believe that Satan was never cast out and resides with God to this day. Please do not think I am trying to persuade you of anything. I am just offering you something to consider. God Bless!  +?+|`|P0WyZU8Uaa	Brad, In a way I guess you could call the earth Satan's throne for the time being.  God has cast him to the earth and given him dominion for a short time.<br>  <br>  Isa. 14:12, 13  "How you are fallen from heaven,<br>  O Lucifer, son of the morning!<br>  HOW YOU ARE CUT DOWN TO THE GROUND,<br>  You who weakened the nations!<br>  v. 13  For you have said in your heart: <br>  'I will ascend into heaven,<br>  I will exalt my throne above the stars of God;<br>  I will also sit on the mount of the congregation<br>  On the farthest sides of the north;<br>  <br>  Ezek. 28:17  "Your heart was lifted up (proud) because of your beauty;<br>  You corrupted your wisdom for the sake of your splendor;<br>  I cast you to the ground,<br>  I laid you before kings,<br>  That they might gaze at you.|`|1oYjjp0Daa	yes - a non-existent throne for a non-existent being|`|YJVmL9Ubaa	Satan's throne is here on earth,God(YHWH)cast satan and the angels who followed satan down to earth and out of heaven,Jesus was tempted by satan who offered Jesus the earth if Jesus would just bow down to him,this also proves to the ones who think satan is still in heaven that he was on earth while Jesus was on earth teaching"the way,the light,and the truth", no one really knows when satan was cast down to earth,only YHWH  has a throne and it is in HEAVEN.|`|t9C8y5JNaa	yes, And unfortunately it resides in the form of an easy chair or couch that most people, who respond to questions like this are sitting on.

He goes to the park a lot.|`|G4SVG7tKaa	Satan doesn't exist.

NjPjpewlaa	As always, when looking at scripture, it helps to read the verses before and after the specific one you are looking at.<br>  If you read Romans (the whole) chapter 5, there is no confusion.<br>  Specifically Romans 5:16, 18.<br>  <br>  and my favourite... Romans 5:8  But God demonstrated His own love for us, in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us.|`|ef4edd8f1c0d16fab298d474bf08b339aa	Because God is the one who never changed. His selection (sometimes referred to as 'election' or 'predestination'), decides who gets His mercy, and who doesn't get His mercy. I am not one of those Christians who thinks that God loves everybody; He said He doesn't. <br>  <br>  But as Romans 9 illustrates, God chooses who He wants to save and who He doesn't want to save. For those He doesn't want to save He relies on the ability of His to keep His word esoteric. He doesn't want some people to "get it."<br>  <br>  Also see Matthew 13, and John 6.

You must include the entire chapter and Bible to these verses. If you do not solidly look at the Bible as "One" you will never understand absolutely the meanings of Jesus words.<br>   If you see Jesus talks with her in the next verses and tells her "it is not good to take the bread from the table and give it to the dogs" and she said  "yes it is true, but also the dogs eat from the crumbles of their masters table that fall off the table."<br>   Jesus is giving a lesson here to His disciples of good faith. The way He approaches people and faithful believers is unique. The lady responds to Jesus comment in a wise and faithful way.<br>   Let me get even more detailed.<br>   The children of Israel are given the bread but don't respect it and let it fall off the table and the natives of His homeland as you say "the dogs" await for these crumbles from their Master and live on it.<br>   Jesus never said that He is only for the "Israelites" as you think.<br>   In Matthew 3:9<br>   "And think not to say within yourselves, We have Abraham to our father: for I say to you, that God is able of these stones to raise up children to Abraham."<br>   Children of Israel are not the People that live in Israel. This is the mistake that everyone makes. Israel in not a country. Israel is Jacob! God "in Exodus told him that He will now call him "Israel" and not Jacob any more. I don't remember the verse but if you look towards the end you will find it. <br>   Now today they call the country that they settled at Israel. This does not make you a son of Israel. Son's of Israel as Jesus tells us are those who follow His Fathers Word and believe in The Son that He sent to this world to save us from Sin.<br>    <br>  My advise to you is not to focus on one verse by itself because that will always lead you to mistakes and mistranslation.

Yeah, probably.  Damned as in fiery torment for eternity?  Not so likely.<br>  <br>  God doesn't torture people who lack faith.  Those without faith don't progress spiritually, and that is a true tragedy, as faith is a principle of light and truth.<br>  <br>  By the way, I too believe the Earth is one of many inhabited planets.  This was a teaching of Abraham.<br>  <br>  Personally, I believe that science and religion are two methods to obtain truth, and compliment each other.  The problem with many religionists, is that they tend to take a grandiose view of the scriptures.  Take for example the great flood.  The Bible records that the waters covered the earth.  This can be taken in two ways; the first way is as a personal testimony of Noah, who opened the window and saw no land.  The second is as a overview of the world as if it was written by God himself.  The first is very down-to-earth, whereas the second is grandiose.  The first is very possible and even probable.  The second is an embellishment to make God look greater, as if he needed any help from us.  The scriptures themselves can be taken either way.<br>  <br>  Another example is the six day creation period.  Ancient Hebrew only had about three thousand words.  The word "YOM" which translates to day also translates to period and year and many other variations describing the measurement of time.  The typical Christian trusts the translation and likes to imagine a God who is so great that he can create a world in six days.  Unfortunately, this is an embellishment; the scripture could simply refer to time periods or stages.  It is perfectly in line with science, if it is translated that the earth was organized in six stages.  The earth started as a large dust cloud of unorganized matter.  As gravity pulled it together, eventually the dust settled and the sun and stars appeared.  This was followed by the creation of plants, animals, and then humans, much as the Bible explains.<br>  <br>  Science tells us that there were humaniods who lived long before Adam.  This doesn't disagree with the Bible, as the Bible never pretends to contain all knowledge.  Although the Bible doesn't specifically mention such creatures, there is no reason to believe it should.  It doesn't mention manatees or penguins or many other creatures.  It never pretends to give us a list of all animal life.  Science tells us that these creatures lived for thousands and maybe even a hundred thousand years without any significant technological advance what-so-ever.  Apparently they had an intelligence more comparable to an ape or monkey; they are a far cry from modern man, whose story starts essentially around the time of Adam.  At the time of Adam, something changed.  There is no human history prior to Adam.  I don't know what their story was, but our story begins with Adam.|`|4qA9Y7m9aa	Yep, a lot of them do.<br>  <br>  You are aware that Jesus mentions the story aren't you?  It seems he believed it.  He mentioned Noah too.<br>  <br>  Added: He mentions them as if he believes them.  He was very much taking them literally.  So, that rather implies he wasn't really God since the stories are very absurd.<br>  <br>  The Jesus story also has a whole section where Jesus is with Satan.  They go up on a mountain together where they can see "all the kingdoms of Earth"   Picking and choosing like you are doing isn't a consistent position.  There is just as much craziness in the New Testament as the Old, and Jesus certainly believed the Old Testament himself.  Thus you either have to conclude the stories are real (no matter how crazy) or that Jesus wasn't God's Son.|`|b1PvVoB0aa	If Adam & Eve were not real, then why would Jesus die for our sins?<br>  <br>  The Bible is very clear that Adam & Eve were real people.

Most books refer back to Genesis as support for arguments.<br>  <br>  Atheists know how important Genesis is. That is why they focus much of their attack on it.

LZF76BLXaa	1) Adishesha:<br>  <br>  In Hindu (Vedic) tradition, Shesha (???) is the king of all nagas, one of the primal beings of creation, and according to the Bhagavata Purana, an avatar of the Supreme God known as Sankarshan.<br>  <br>  In the Puranas, Shesha is said to hold all the planets of the Universe on his hoods and to constantly sing the glories of Vishnu from all his mouths. <br>  <br>  "Adishesha", which means First snake.<br>  <br>  2) Ananta-Shesha:<br>  <br>  Shesha is generally depicted with a massive form that floats coiled in space, or on the universal ocean, to form the bed on which Vishnu lies. Sometimes he is shown as five-headed or seven-headed, but more commonly as a many hundred-headed serpent, sometimes with each head wearing an ornate crown.<br>  <br>  He is closely associated with Vishnu. His name means "that which remains", from the Sanskrit root sis, because when the world is destroyed at the end of the kalpa, Shesha remains as he is.<br>  <br>  So he is refered  as "Ananta-Shesha" which means "Endless Shesha". <br>  <br>  Lord Vishnu is seen resting on the coils of the serpent Shesha, also called Ananta. Sheshanaga is the expansion of Lord Balarama, Lord Krishna’s brother, and serves the Lord in this way as the Lord’s support and paraphernalia. Shesha has a thousand heads swinging to and fro over the form of Lord Vishnu, creating a shelter and couch for the Lord.<br>  <br>  Ananta is endlessly singing the praises and glories of the Lord from His thousand hoods without ever reaching the end. His hoods are also supporting the many planetary systems in the cosmic creation that are orbiting throughout the universe above His heads. Ananta also means endless in terms of the endlessness of cosmic time. This is also represented by His thousand hoods as divisions of time. The material worlds are created within the element of time, and are thus sustained by time. During the process of the universal annihilation, time ceases to exist, in which case the material planets are also forced into obliteration. <br>  <br>  Lord Shesha is often seen floating on the causal waters of the Garbhodaka Ocean, which exists on the bottom of the universe. Lord Vishnu is thus resting on Sheshanaga as They float on the ocean. At other times, They are viewed floating on the Kshiramudra, or an ocean of white milk. This represents the Prakriti or the ingredients of the unmanifest material nature in its purest form. <br>  <br>  3) Ananda Sesha as incarnation of Godhead: <br>  <br>  (i) Srimad Bhagavatam 10.1.24:<br>  <br>   "The foremost manifestation of Krishna is Sankarshana, who is known as Ananta. He is the origin of all incarnations within this material world. Previous to the appearance of Lord Krishna, this original Sankarshana will appear as Baladeva, just to please the Supreme Lord Krishna in His transcendental pastimes." <br>  <br>  (ii) Srimad Bhagavatam 5.25.1:<br>  <br>  "My dear King, approximately 240,000 miles beneath the planet Patala lives another incarnation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. He is the expansion of Lord Vishnu known as Lord Ananta or Lord Sankarshana. He is always in the transcendental position, but because He is worshiped by Lord Siva, the deity of tamo-guna or darkness, He is sometimes called Tamasi. <br>  <br>  Lord Ananta is the predominating Deity of the material mode of ignorance as well as the false ego of all conditioned souls. When a conditioned living being thinks, 'I am the enjoyer, and this world is meant to be enjoyed by me,' this conception of life is dictated to him by Sankarshana. Thus the mundane conditioned soul thinks himself the Supreme Lord."<br>  <br>  (iii) Sri Chaitanya Caritamrita Adi-lila 5.120:<br>  <br>  "That Ananta Sesha is the devotee incarnation of Godhead. He knows nothing but service to Lord Krishna." <br>  <br>  (iv) Srila Jiva Gosvami, in his Krishna-sandarbha: <br>  <br>  "Sri Anantadeva has thousands of faces and is fully independent. Always ready to serve the Supreme Personality of Godhead, He waits upon Him constantly. Sankarshana is the first expansion of Vasudeva, and because He appears by His own will, He is called svarat, fully independent. He is therefore infinite and transcendental to all limits of time and space. He Himself appears as the thousand-headed Sesha." <br>  <br>  (v) A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada:<br>  <br>  "Sankarshana of the quadruple form descends with Lord Rama as Lakshmana. When Lord Rama disappears, Sesha again separates Himself from the personality of Lakshmana. Sesha then returns to His own abode in the Patala regions, and Lakshmana returns to His abode in Vaikuntha."  <br>  <br>  (vi) Bhagavad-Gita, Chapter 10, Verse 29:<br>  <br>  In the Bhagavad-Gita, when in the middle of the battlefied Kurukshetra, Krishna explaining his omnipresence, says: "Of Nagas, I am Ananta" indicating the importance of Ananta Shesha.  <br>  <br>  4) Avataras of Adishesha:<br>  <br>  Balarama, Lakshmana, and Nityananda Prabhu, are considered avataras of Shesha.<br>  <br>  Pata?jali is also considered an emanation or incarnation of Shesha and is iconographically depicted in naga form with naga canopy.<br>  <br>  5) More on Adishesha:<br>  <br>  In a story from the Puranas, Shesha loosens Mount Mandara, to enable it to be used in the churning of the ocean by the devas and asuras.<br>  <br>  According to the Mahabharata (Adi Parva), his father was Kashyapa and his mother Kadru.<br>  <br>  The city of Thiruvananthapuram is named after him as the "City of Lord Ananta".|`|jTFHNLS7aa	Snake symbolises the Devil.|`|41519dcd613e198147ae134a0f6e6e78aa	This is a mythological creation for which there is no explanation|`|4ad0fb30a1174358bcdd57576983960caa	Depiction of snake around neck of shiva and mutiheaded snake over head of Vishnu are symbolic expressions of experiences of higher state of spirituality.

In India, nāgas are considered nature spirits and the protectors of springs, wells and rivers. They bring rain, and thus fertility, but are also thought to bring disasters such as floods and drought. According to traditions nāgas are only malevolent to humans when they have been mistreated. They are susceptible to mankind's disrespectful actions in relation to the environment. They are also associated with waters — rivers, lakes, seas, and wells — and are generally regarded as guardians of treasure. According to Beer (1999),[page number needed] Naga and cintamani are often depicted together and associated directly in the literature.<br>  <br>  They are objects of great reverence in some parts of southern India where it is believed that they bring fertility and prosperity to their venerators.Expensive and grand rituals like Nagamandala are conducted in their honour (see Nagaradhane). In north India certain communities called Nagavanshi consider themselves descendants of Nagas.<br>  <br>  Varuna, the Vedic god of storms, is viewed as the King of the nāgas. Nāgas live in Pātāla, the seventh of the "nether" dimensions or realms. They are children of Kashyapa and Kadru. Among the prominent nāgas of Hinduism are Manasa, Shesha or Sesa and Vasuki.<br>  <br>  The nāgas also carry the elixir of life and immortality. Garuda once brought it to them and put a cup with elixir on the ground but it was taken away by Indra. However, few drops remained on the grass. The nāgas licked up the drops, but in doing so, cut their tongues on the grass, and since then their tongues have been forked.<br>  <br>  Vishnu is originally portrayed in the form sheltered by a Shesha naga or reclining on Shesha , but the iconography has been extended to other deities as well. The serpent is a common feature in Ganesha iconography and appears in many forms: around the neck, use as a sacred thread (Sanskrit: yaj?yopavīta)wrapped around the stomach as a belt, held in a hand, coiled at the ankles, or as a throne, which is where the 5 or 7 headed snake heads sheltering Vishnu arises.<br>  <br>  Here's a picture of a statue:<br>  <a href="http://lifeblisstree.com/images/wood/W030_Radha_Krishna%20on%20seven%20headed%20snake.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://lifeblisstree.com/images/wood/W03...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Halcon|`|c2281bdd79a22b4095d5a638856c7bdeaa	As per Hindu mythology,that is one of the avtars known Sheshnag.When Lord Krishna was born,this avtar protected Lord Krishna from heavy rain.We shouldnot feel surprised and believe it.

It cannot be a person. At pentecost 120 disciples where baptized with holy spirit. In proverbs chapter 8 it talks about wisdom being a person. Now can wisdom be a person? When you look at all aspects of the bible you get the right interpretation of scripture. John 14:28  2 Timothy 3:16-17<br>   Just like 120 disciples could not have received a person inside them. No but a helper that would remind then of the teachings of  God and help them to endure and teach others about the Christ and his mininstry and the kingdom of God.

When you are baptised in Jesus name, you have the promise of the Holy Ghost!|`|TyRfv0eoaa	Acts 2:38 -<br>  <br>  Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus' Christ for the forgiveness of your sins, and you will receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.<br>  <br>  If you love God and try to follow in His footsteps, you believe and you have repented. You are ready for baptism.|`|hWvvrEphaa	Hi there,<br>  <br>  I was raised Pentecostal and I love it. I'm not fond on the attitudes of some of the pentecostal people. Everyone should be welcome into the church, no matter what you look like, where you've been or what you've done. Jesus loves everyone. :)<br>  <br>  Now, to answer your question. Most Pentecostal Churches baptize people during Easter. You can call your church and ask them when they will be doing there's. I don't know if every church is alike but my church has a small pool in it and its in front of the whole congregation. They say a prayer for you and then you vow to follow Jesus (I can't remember exactly what they say) and then they dip you in the water. However, you don't need to get baptized to be a saved. You're saved when you make the decision to follow Jesus. I think getting baptized makes it more real so that you are more likely to keep your promises to God. :)<br>  <br>  I'm getting baptized too this Easter, so congratulations. :)<br>  <br>  All the best to you. Good Luck and God bless.|`|FOzN3xwzaa	Water baptism cannot save, water baptism is not required for salvation, and water baptism cannot be added to Jesus's PERFECT salvation. <br>  <br>  Water baptism is only a celebration for the ALREADY saved. And if a person is never water baptised, they are of course still saved if they are a believer. <br>  <br>  The thief on the cross was never water baptised. <br>  <br>  Salvation is a FREE GIFT that happens in a split second when you believe in Jesus! It is impossible to lose or "leave" salvation (John 6:39-40, 1 John 5:13). <br>  <br>  The truth about Jesus is that the only way to be saved and to get into heaven and avoid being sent to eternal hell, is by believing in faith alone that Jesus, who is God, died for our sins on the cross as FULL PAYMENT for all our sins, and then Jesus rose from the dead (1 Corinthians 15:1-4). Believe this and you will be in heaven, no matter what! <br>  <br>  Please pray now: "Jesus, please forgive me of my sins. I believe that You died on the cross for my sins and You rose from the dead. Thank You for eternal life!" You will be in heaven with Him forever when you die. :)

XhXG44Ddaa	Well, the both users who answered above undoubtedly know far better than me. They just forgot to teach you how to pronounce this adjective. I′d suggest you never to ask for a translation of an only word, as many things depend (can vary) on the context, on a whole sentence. OK?<br>  <br>  There are 2 forms of writing and/or pronouncing that: " lep / lepa // lijep / lijepa ". It depends on the region, but the forms with "ij" are common, normal, usual in Croatia, Bosnia-Herzegovina and Montenegro. Well, the couple above can help you more, if necessary; they speak Croatian as native folks, as they said. I′m not living there!<br>  <br>  This sound "l(ij)e-pa" from Slavic languages isn′t easy, especially for English speakers, ′cause it′s a palatalized sound; you′d have to fold your tongue in a special way, as if to wet your palate, this is, touching your inner part of mouth next up from your teeth with your wet tongue. Anyway try to say quickly "llyeh" as in English and join "pa" ( " llyehpa "), like in "pEpper" but with "ll" and not "p" at the beginning. (If masculine, just pronounce as English "llyehp".)<br>  <br>  Ah! In Bulgarian, it′s " красиви " / " красива ",  pronounced as in English "kraceevee" ("cee" being stressed), for masculine / and "kraceevah" ("cee" being the stressed syllable too), for feminine.<br>  <br>  (Good?|`|qBaHftytaa	lijepa means beautiful on croatian..you read croatian like it is written...it is pretty simple...|`|q4pLY5F8aa	Lep (beautiful, masculine); ljepa (beautiful, feminine).

M2UWOTAjaa	The idea of getting married because you are in love is quite new to human civilization. For a very long time arranged marriages were the rule, in the interests of the family or clan, and for political interests in the case of the ruling classes. In addition for many thousands of years boys and girls got married as soon as they had either the first period or the first ejaculation. Our DNA has a long memory, as it were, and it was instructing people to marry very young because there was a very good chance they would die before the age of 40 and also that 1/3 to 1/2 of the children would die before puberty.<br>  In most cases 9 year olds are either bethrothed (engaged) or the marriage is not consummated until she reaches puberty. The history of marriage is long and vvery interesting.|`|GdEBdbOsaa	1) Its natural as they normally have a lower life expectancy. <br>  2) They do not cohabitate<br>  3)they marry out of true love not waiting till they are 30 to tick off the  'right' boxes ie nice house, good car, money, status. If you love someone, those things are irrelevant hence the lower divorce rate|`|FKxrJxbPaa	Because in many other societies marriage at a younger age makes much more economical sense. <br>  <br>  We live in a developed world where waiting to get married is an asset because it leaves time to get an education and develop a career. Whereas in many 3rd world nations marriage is better early because there IS no available education and pooling together money and resources helps ensure survival. In underdeveloped countries oftentimes the only work available is argricultural work and manual labour and men are better suited for that, so with litte options for women they have almost no choice besides marry a man young to feed themselves.|`|4sh2oRR7aa	That girl was married off because her father sold her.<br>  <br>  It's mostly in Islamic countries where fathers often marry 8 and 9 year old girls off for money. 2 girls last year in Saudi Arabia were married to 48 and 58 year olds for money and can't get a divorce for several years (if the divorce is approved). The sole reason is that a girl is property and her father owns her so he sells her.

From Peter, there is an unbroken line of succession to the current Pope, Benedict XVI.|`|jard50Yiaa	Saint Peter (Greek: Π?τρο?, Pétros “Rock”) (c.1–AD 64) was one of Twelve Apostles, chosen by Jesus from his first disciples. He is prominently featured in the New Testament Gospels and the Acts of the Apostles. According to Biblical accounts, Peter was a Galilean fisherman assigned a leadership role by Jesus (Matthew 16:18), and was with Jesus during events witnessed by only a few apostles, such as the Transfiguration. Early Christian writers provided more details about his life. Catholic tradition claims him as the first bishop of Rome, author of two canonical epistles, and a martyr under Nero, crucified head down, and buried in Rome. His memoirs are traditionally cited as the source of the Gospel of Mark.<br>  <br>  The Roman Catholic Church, Eastern Orthodox, Oriental Orthodox and Anglican Communion consider Simon Peter a saint. According to Catholic tradition, but not in Orthodox tradition, Peter was the first bishop of Rome (Orthodox regard Linus to be the first bishop of Rome) and Catholics argue that the Pope is Peter's successor and therefore the rightful superior of all other bishops. Eastern and Oriental Orthodox also do not recognize the Bishop of Rome as the successor of Saint Peter but the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople sends a delegation each year to Rome to participate in the celebration of the feast of Sts. Peter and Paul. In the "Ravenna Document" of 13 October 2007, the representatives of the Eastern Orthodox Church agreed that "Rome, as the Church that 'presides in love' according to the phrase of St. Ignatius of Antioch (To the Romans, Prologue), occupied the first place in the taxis, and that the bishop of Rome was therefore the protos among the patriarchs, if the Papacy unites with the Orthodox Church. They disagree, however, on the interpretation of the historical evidence from this era regarding the prerogatives of the bishop of Rome as protos, a matter that was already understood in different ways in the first millennium."<br>  <br>  In art, he is often depicted holding the keys to the kingdom of heaven (interpreted by Roman Catholics as the sign of his primacy over the Church), a reference to Matthew 16:19.|`|AA11440601	Simon Peter.<br>  <br>  John 21:15-17 states: <br>  <br>  When they had finished breakfast, Jesus said to Simon Peter, "Simon, son of John, do you love me more than these?" He said to him, "Yes, Lord, you know that I love you." He said to him, "Feed my lambs." <br>  <br>  He then said to him a second time, "Simon, son of John, do you love me?" He said to him, "Yes, Lord, you know that I love you." He said to him, "Tend my sheep." <br>  <br>  He said to him the third time, "Simon, son of John, do you love me?"

In Christianity you have freedom but some religions have not.  Being a mother she loves you and she wants you to be a religious person like her.  Unfortunately, you are not that way.  You love the world more than Christ it bothers your mother that you are going to hell.  But what ever you do, do according to her will until you are under her roof.  If you have freedom to take care of your self then you do whatever you do. It is a wise thing to follow her advise to avoid this conflict at present.|`|Hc5vU3dhaa	God please save this girl :( hey shes jus taking good care of u y cant u realize or understand that...??? all i know is she loves u alot pls be good to ur parents... may be shes freakin out n telling others bout jus bcus she cares for u n want u to change y cant u accept that...???|`|OKPzO95Zaa	Because she's your mother.

At least you make known which side of Universal Sovereignty you support!|`|YJYHV5qRaa	Noah lived on a different planet.<br>  When they boarded the boat they were oblivious to the nature of the trip God was about to send them on.<br>  <br>  The planet Noah lived on was destroyed and all life on that planet was snuffed out and washed away.<br>  <br>  When Noah landed, they landed in a place where there was an olive tree. How can that be? The planet Noah was on needed Adam to slave just to get thorns and thistles to grow yet this new planet lifted that curse.<br>  <br>  When Noah landed, he landed on a planet that was already fully developed and thriving with numerous species. Those species that Noah brought on the ark went out into the world and joined the species as they already existed on this planet.<br>  <br>  Face it, if we spend billions of dollars to go into space transporting life and looking at planets like mars which had life and water but is now barren, do we really find it soo unblevieably absurd that God could do the same thing we do?<br>  <br>  If you couple a quantum physics lesson of energy creating matter and the stories of Angels transporting in lightning bolts and appearing as static electricity with the concept of space travel and science propegating species on new planets and I think it is clear from the bible perspective - we are the aliens placed in a garden to work it (farming) on this planet and God controls it.<br>  <br>  Check genisis. Theere are two creation stories mixed together. One where man is created first and the animal later and one where the animals are first and man comes later. That means if both are true, we have more than one planet spoken of. We now know other planets exist - time we start acting like educated people and admit the bible is speaking about other life forms with mastered skills and technology. Angels are other life forms.|`|pb4M6Q3Paa	Well you'd think he built a boat for animals there would be individual pens for each, not all of the animals were that large, for instance you said mice, a lot of animals can swim so that knocks off quite a few of them.

When God flooded the "whole world", I think it probably is referring to the world as Noah knew it. There wouldn't have been nearly as many animals in that one part of the world, so it would be doable, and the talking snake was, of course, the devil. That's obvious. Not every snake could talk. It was that snake the devil posessed.|`|Eke9jZ1Aaa	From a realistic perspective, Noah only took the animals he could find in his geographic area. And the Ark was roughly the size of a football field.

Noah didn't "gather" the animals, the bible says God caused 2 of every animal to come to the arc.  If God can cause 2 of every animal to come to the arc I think God could also satiate and desire of the animal for food.  I realize the goddidit answer is not popular, but you in your summery already allowed for God to 1.speak verbally to a particular person. 2. Gather animals. 3. Provide a massive amount of Rain.

One is grateful for receiving an egg the other throws a tantrum because God did not answer the Prayer.<br>  <br>  Some people make eggnog and share their eggs. Some people keep all their eggs in one basket. Some people throw their eggs at other people and laugh and laugh. Some people steal other people's eggs. Others have their eggs stolen.<br>  <br>  On judgment day, in the after life, having watched the people suffer because their eggs were stolen I think God would make up for their suffering because God is a God of justice. God hears our prayers however the answers may not be the answers that we want.<br>  <br>  The egg keepers may sincerely believe that the egg throwers are doomed to hell.

iH7ZB5Soaa	No.It's been proved that there is no conradiction between Divine Determining and Freewill at:<br>  www.lightofquran.info/26word.htm<br>  <br>  It is not burdensome; it rather affords a luminosity and joy producing a lightness, ease, and spirit, and ensuring confidence and security. Because if man does not believe in Divine Determining, he is compelled to bear a burden as heavy as the world on the shoulders of his spirit within a constricted space, which allows him only an insignificant independence and temporary freedom. For man is connected with the whole universe. He has infinite aims and desires. But since his power, will, and freedom are insufficient to meet a millionth of these, it may be understood how awesome is the burden of the distress he bears. Thus, belief in Divine Determining throws that burden in its entirety onto the ship of Divine Determining, allowing him to roam free within its perfections with perfect ease and perfect freedom of spirit and heart. It only negates the petty freedom of the evil-commanding soul and smashes its Pharaoh-like tyranny and lordship, and its acting as it wishes.

In this older narrative the first woman is created after the first man (Adam), from his body (Genesis 2:21-22), a situation which no doubt reflects the dominant position of males in a patriarchal society.<br>  <br>  But the implied inferior status of women becomes explicit only after the fall from grace in Eden, when God tells the woman: "your desire shall be for your husband, and he shall rule over you" (Genesis 3:16). Adam then gives his partner a name, Eve, an act that echoes his naming of the beasts, which expressed his dominion over animalkind. <br>  <br>  However, this account stresses, even more strongly than the first Genesis creation story, the unity of the sexes and their mutual need. God says: "It is not good that man should be alone; I will make him a helper as his partner" (Genesis 2:18). Only woman proves suitable for this role.|`|mr8isJoZaa	Yup, god took that rib from adam, planted it in the ground, and nine months later, eve sprouted up as a fully grown woman.....haha, i love this story, than adam and eve have two children, cain and abel, than cain kills abel and some 6 thousand years later, we have black people, white people, indian, asian and european blood lines.  hahahahahaha.|`|b1PvVoB0aa	Actually try reading something before you laugh at it.

Then the LORD God made a woman from the rib he had taken out of the man, and he brought her to the man.<br>  <br>  'Where did Cain get his wife' is a common question.<br>  There is an excellent article which explains it very clearly.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://creationontheweb.com/images/pdfs/cabook/chapter8.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://creationontheweb.com/images/pdfs/...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  The reason we do not marry close relatives now, is because we are more likely to share common genetic defects which could cause serious defects in resulting children.<br>  But Adam and Eve had perfect genes so this was not an issue. Genes have been gatherering defects ever since - we are, if you like, devolving.<br>  <br>  God only gave the commands about not marrying close relatives to Moses, many years after Adam and Eve.<br>  <br>  So Cain must have married his sister, or possibly a niece.<br>  <br>  Adam and Eve are recorded as having 'sons and daughters'. Only Cain, Abel and Seth are mentioned, but according to Jewish tradition they had 33 sons and 23 daughters.<br>  <br>  This line of reasoning is consistent both with the Bible and with observation and science (genetics). We know that all humans are related and share a common (human) ancestor.

This gland responds to emotion and controls facial expressions as well as the tongue.  You may notice differences in Japanese facial expressions as apposed to others.  The tongue is inhibited and does not respond to mental talk as fast and often does not deliver the message while the mind is in this state of shock.  These individuals have thought about saying many things but there tongue is inhibited and the message is not delivered.  The mind accepts the message as useless and unnecessary.

Jesus used the occasion of healing the man blind from birth to point out the reprehensibility of the Pharisees because they professed to be those with spiritual sight and willfully refused to come out of their blind condition. They were like those who loved darkness rather than light. (Joh 9:39-41; 3:19,?20) The apostle Paul spoke to the Ephesian congregation about having the eyes of their heart enlightened. (Eph 1:16,?18) Jesus points out that those who profess to be Christians but who are not conscious of their spiritual need are blind and naked, not discerning their pitiful, groping condition. (Re 3:17) Just as being in darkness for a long period of time will cause blindness to the natural eyes, the apostle John points out that a Christian who hates his brother is walking aimlessly in a blinding darkness (1Jo 2:11); and Peter warns that one not developing Christian fruitage, the greatest of which is love, is “blind, shutting his eyes to the light.” (2Pe 1:5-9) The source of such darkness and spiritual blindness is Satan the Devil, who, transforming himself into an angel of light, actually is “the god of this system of things” and the god of darkness who has blinded the minds of the unbelievers so that they do not discern the good news about the Christ.—Lu 22:53; 2Co 4:4; 11:14,?15.<br>  <br>  <br>   The apostle Paul wrote: “Let us work what is good toward all, but especially toward those related to us in the faith.” (Galatians 6:10) As Christians, we have an obligation to show love for those who are related to us in the faith—our spiritual brothers and sisters. How important is this love? Making this powerful point, the apostle John wrote: “Everyone who hates his brother is a manslayer .?.?. If anyone makes the statement: ‘I love God,’ and yet is hating his brother, he is a liar. For he who does not love his brother, whom he has seen, cannot be loving God, whom he has not seen.” (1?John 3:15; 4:20) These are strong words. Jesus Christ applied the words “manslayer” and “liar” to Satan the Devil. (John 8:44) Never would we want those terms applied to us!<br>   True Christians are “taught by God to love one another.” (1?Thessalonians 4:9) We are to love “neither in word nor with the tongue, but in deed and truth.” (1?John 3:18) Our love should be “without hypocrisy.” (Romans 12:9) Love moves us to be kind, compassionate, forgiving, long-suffering and not jealous, boastful, arrogant, or selfish. (1?Corinthians 13:4,?5; Ephesians 4:32) It impels us to “slave for one another.” (Galatians 5:13) Jesus told his disciples to love one another just as he loved them. (John 13:34) A Christian should therefore be willing to give even his life in behalf of fellow believers when necessary.|`|QjZFMfksaa	Wouldn't it be a beautiful world if everyone loved each other? Well, that's the kind of world God has planned for those who can love each other. The question is, will you be apart of it?<br>  <br>  Yes -- we are all children of God -- all one family -- <br>  <br>  “The universe is in continual creation. Rather than making the universe according to a fixed and final design, the One set in motion an exploratory, experimental process. Not only is the outcome of this process unknown, but also we and all other evolving creatures are co-creators with the One, and all matter is imbued with the Spirit and Consciousness of the One.”...Malcolm Hollick<br>  <br>  The Science of Oneness: A Worldview for the Twenty-First Century by Malcolm Hollick|`|k03dYskYaa	I agree with what the Scriptures about hating one Christian brother. That would make a person a liar if they claimed to love God but hated their brother. That is improper hatred.<br>  Upon becoming Christians, persons who formerly hated one another do so no longer. (Tit 3:3) The one hating his brother is still walking in darkness, and any claim on his part to be a lover of God would really be a lie. Hatred of one’s brother is tantamount to murder.—1Jo 2:9,?11; 4:20; 3:15.<br>  <br>  There is proper hatred.<br>  Under certain conditions and at certain times it is proper to hate. “There is .?.?. a time to love and a time to hate.” (Ec 3:1,?8) Even of Jehovah it is said that he hated Esau. (Mal 1:2,?3) But this cannot be attributed to any arbitrariness on God’s part. Esau proved himself unworthy of Jehovah’s love by despising his birthright and selling it and hence also the divine promises and blessings attached thereto. Moreover, he purposed to kill his brother Jacob. (Ge 25:32-34; 27:41-43; Heb 12:14-16) God also hates lofty eyes, a false tongue, hands that are shedding innocent blood, a heart fabricating hurtful schemes, feet that are in a hurry to run to badness, a false witness, anyone sending forth contentions among brothers, in fact, everyone and everything standing in complete opposition to Jehovah and his righteous laws.—Pr 6:16-19; De 16:22; Isa 61:8; Zec 8:17; Mal 2:16.<br>  <br>  In true loyalty to Jehovah, his servants hate what and whom he hates. (2Ch 19:2) “Do I not hate those who are intensely hating you, O Jehovah, and do I not feel a loathing for those revolting against you? With a complete hatred I do hate them. They have become to me real enemies.” (Ps 139:21,?22) But this hate does not seek to inflict injury on others and is not synonymous with spite or malice. Rather, it finds expression in its utter abhorrence of what is wicked, avoiding what is bad and those intensely hating Jehovah. (Ro 12:9, 17,?19) Christians rightly hate those who are confirmed enemies of God, such as the Devil and his demons, as well as men who have deliberately and knowingly taken their stand against Jehovah.<br>  <br>  While Christians have no love for those who turn the undeserved kindness of God into an excuse for loose conduct, they do not hate persons who become involved in wrongdoing but who are worthy of being shown mercy. Instead of hating the repentant wrongdoer, they hate the wicked act, yes, “even the inner garment that has been stained by the flesh.”—Jude 4,?23.|`|yV8fog7Paa	You can't.

This usually leads to a defeated spirit or proof that no faith produced by God ever existed (1 John 1:19).<br>  <br>  In retrospect, what Christian hasn't struggled with faith? This is part of the sanctifying process.

We learn to trust in God.<br>  <br>  Faith itself is a gift of God. It is written that one needs to be drawn of the Father to believe in His Son...<br>  This is part of the fundamentals of Christ Church Foundation. Peter being a clear example. His faith in who Jesus Is, is because the Father gave this faith to know in his heart & confess with his mouth, 'Jesus is the Christ, the Son of the Living God.'.|`|FsX5VoXKaa	I guess i'm very glad to say that I have yet to experience any struggle with faith ...   This is probably thanks to my pastors and caregroup and ministry leaders who always encourage us with fellowship and through preaching the Word..<br>  <br>  The only times i feel really sad/unhappy is when I miss fellowship/service and will then go on a binge of sermons lol..   I understand that Faith comes by hearing and hearing the Word of Christ. <br>  <br>  Therefore, whenever i put on a CD sermon, or listen to a podcast of sermons, I feel faith building up whenever the preacher unveils Jesus... <br>  <br>  and meditating on that word that was preached really gives fuel for the week ahead..|`|CXmL4qvOaa	It is like Jesus said, that faith as small as a mustard seed can move mountains. But how can that be so? By exercising your faith and feasting on the Manna from God, "Faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God." Faith is alive, and it will grow if you nurture it. It also will wilt and fade away if you do nothing.|`|1ec32bd76f3584208ce83bf42928a21faa	We all are given a measure of faith when we confessed our belief in Jesus Christ as our Lord and Savior (Romans 12:3)<br>  <br>  Faith also comes to us by hearing the word of Christ (Romans 10:17).<br>  <br>  We build up our faith by praying in the Spirit (Jude 20).<br>  <br>  The challenge Christians have is to walk by faith and not by sight (2 Corinthians 5:7) which means we act in faith through using our spiritual perception and not our natural perception.

One that I can relate with. But it seems to be more out of anger than anything else. I used to ask questions very similar to what you are asking until I stopped asking people and asked God. <br>  <br>  Most of us get married for the wrong reason. Most children born are not expected and are the product of a man and a woman being disobedient to the word of God. Yes, most people preach too much on grace and compassion and not enough on conviction. But what can we do to change it... Whether you want to believe it or not. Some of us are meant to be born and raised in single parent homes. Some of us are meant to experience a mother and father getting divorced. It all fits God's plan of being able to reach out to those who do not believe.One day we all will come across someone who is going through what we have experienced.. That is what the call being witness and sharing a testimony. As much as I have a hatred in me to see the world as it is it all has purpose in God's eyes though we may disagree. The grace and compassion comes in because even though we make mistakes God still loves us. It is not to say that we will not be punished for what we do but that he will always be there.|`|QjZFMfksaa	I think we need a different interpretation as to what God actually can mean for us all.<br>  <br>  A quote by Deepak Chopra, author of 'How to Know God'<br>  <br>  "God has managed the amazing feat of being worshiped and invisible at the same time. Millions of people would describe him as a white-bearded father figure sitting on a throne in the sky, but none could claim to be an eyewitness. Although it doesn't seem possible to offer a single fact about the Almighty that would hold up in a court of law, somehow the vast majority of people believe in God -- as many as 96 percent, according to some polls. This reveals a huge gap between belief and what we call everyday reality. We need to heal this gap. <br>  <br>  What would the facts be like if we had them? They would be as follows. Everything that we experience as material reality is born in an invisible realm beyond space and time, a realm revealed by science to consist of energy and information. This invisible source of all that exists is not an empty void but the womb of creation itself. Something creates and organizes this energy. It turns the chaos of quantum soup into stars, galaxies, rain forests, human beings, and our own thoughts, emotions, memories, and desires. In the pages that lie ahead we will see that it is not only possible to know this source of existence on an abstract level but to become intimate and at one with it. When this happens, our horizons open to new realities.

This is why God gives us direction on how to have a good marriage, how to treat our spouse, how to treat our children, how to treat our parents, etc. It's all in the Bible, people just choose to not follow it.<br>  <br>  God created us with a free will. We also have to understand that we live in a fallen world.<br>  "These things I have spoken to you, that in Me you may have peace. In the world you will have tribulation; but be of good cheer, I have overcome the world.” -John 16:33<br>  <br>  You see, there is a bigger picture here, this life is but a vapor, it's here then gone.

If there is no God, then there is no hope.|`|AA10192697	"Where is the grace and compassion on the kids ..."<br>  <br>  God gives grace to the the suffering automatically but the suffering has to seek it in order to find it.  That's why in the case of a divorce, the parents are responsible to help the children live through it. The parents are the comforters and guiders. God can work through the parents to help the children.  In families of believers, the children can pray to God for help through the divorce and after wards. Children at any age can talk to God daily, read the Bible, talk to other believers for help and God works through the prayers, talks thru the Bible and other people to help the children.<br>  <br>  God is waiting on one side and we need to seek Him, knock and the door will be opened.  God doesn't automatically help anyone. We need to ask Him, to show Him that we have faith and want and need His help. He helps thru the words in the Bible, thru other people.  Children can talk to friends that are from divorces parents. Children can talk to other relatives, teachers, neighbors, friends' parents, counselors, etc.  Yet it is the completely the parents responsibility to listen to their children and get them the help and guidance that they need. And if they are believers in God, the parents can open the Bible and read stories of encouragement, people working thru despair and succeeding, etc.|`|93galWG1aa	Fallings will happen but woe to the one who is the cause!<br>  suffering is something we all go through no acceptations,they just differ.<br>  Grace is not something we get rewarded for doing it's a free gift to know God and he heals and binds the wounds of those who suffer through no fault of their own.<br>  Grace is all around you if you know how to follow it it will lead you to peace and joy.<br>  all that you say is self inflicted by disordered desires, consequences follow actions, that's a lesson we should all know by now, we can deal with them alone or with God.<br>  have you read any Books on the Saints? if you have you'll see a common thread it is great suffering but with it comes great joy as they live to be like Christ, you can't stand outside and shout in where's mine! consequences are for good things too.
sohnrZDcaa	You don't seem to read the bible paying attention to what you read!<br>  <br>  Before his conversion Saint Paul was instrumental in the death of countless followers of Jesus Christ. He must have left behind a lot of widows and orphans. He never repented. He only wised up! God picks the scum of the Earth to be his prophets and preachers! After his conversion Saint Paul doesn’t have people killed anymore, but he still has a special hatred for certain people. He doesn't like gays and lesbians, he hates women, and he doesn't like Cretans. He hates widows, especially the ones that he left behind in his past “DUNG” (plain sh*t) life as he call it. Now Saint Paul is stretching out to reach the “supreme calling” in Christ Jesus! So he is denying any church help to most widows and no apologies, either.  He hates escaped slaves and he orders them to return to their masters! Can you imagine sexually abusing masters especially on young little boy and girl slaves? In fact, Saint Paul dedicated the whole book of Philemon to teach escaped Christian slaves to return to their masters and Saint Peter goes along the same lines, too! <br>  <br>  1 Peter 2:18 (NIV) (Saint Peter, the First Pope commands!) Slaves* (*including young little boy an girl slaves!), submit yourselves to your masters with all respect, NOT ONLY to those who are good and considerate, BUT ALSO TO THOSE WHO ARE HARSH.* (*Hey…! hey…! hey…! How kinky can the Christians get today? As kinky as they want as long as the secular arm of the law won’t catch them! Smart preachers do it in their closets until they get caught! Christians have no moral standards to draw from the Bible! They borrow from the real secular world that we all live in!)<br>  <br>  Titus 1:12-13 (NIV) (Saint Paul writes) Even one of their own prophets has said, “CRETANS ARE ALWAYS LIARS, EVIL BRUTES, LAZY GLUTTONS.” THIS TESTIMONY IS TRUE! Therefore, rebuke them sharply, so that they will be sound in the faith!<br>  <br>  Saint Paul wrote the bulk of the New Testament. He laid down the basis for the new Christian religion. Apparently he doesn’t like the people on the Island of Crete. He is accusing them of being ALWAYS LIARS, EVIL BRUTES, LAZY GLUTTONS… just for the heck of it on hearsay evidence alone! Christians ought to know that the “born again transforming power” of God the Holy Ghost has no effect on the Cretan Christians. The Cretan Christians need to be rebuked sharply that they are no good people!  If any Cretan fills out a job application anywhere Saint Paul is tipping the hiring manager that the Cretans are “ALWAYS LIARS, EVIL BRUTES, LAZY GLUTTONS”! So good luck all ye Cretan Christians there is a big finger salutation for you in the Bible!!! What if Saint Paul would have made the same statement in the Bible about the American Christians? How long would it take to remove a Holy Ghost inspired statement like that from the Bible? Obviously, the Bible is in desperate need of an update because it is too primitive and barbaric to say the least!<br>  <br>  I know… I know… Saint Paul was “moved” by God the Holy Ghost to write what he wrote and he was not aware of it… According to the Fundies the eternal Bible is 100% the “Word of God” and Saint Paul is one of his mouthpieces! It takes a lot of gullibility… oops, sorry faith to believe all the Holy Crap in the Bible! And the Christians get extremely nasty at me for telling them like it is in the Bible! Actually I don't know why Christians get nasty unless it is sublimely inserted in their mind to be so whenever they read their Bible!|`|LSJ8BmHVaa	I don't like Paul at all.

That's why Paul said that. He didn't say it in a mean way, simply that they shouldn't be talking out loud, while the men were trying to hear and understand the Word. Remember, God puts men in charge of His Word in his family at home. It is up to the men to be the spiritual leaders in their household. It was important for them to hear the Word, so they could relay it to their families. That's also why he said "let them learn it from their husbands."<br>  I know a lot of women get upset over this passage, but if they do, then they are simply taking it out of context. Men ARE suppose to be the spiritual leaders in the home.|`|PBNPWPbVaa	Like i said earlier he was an old fart with unresolved sexual issues.<br>  Seems to me like he hated women....<br>  Seriously now i think he said that because yes women talk to much,they gossip and they don't ever shut up.|`|wSYYfBK4aa	I don't hate him for it.

Or my friend who was raped at 12, her parents FORCED her to have the baby...who was her stepdads! <br>  <br>  Then them, forcing their kids into their religion, taking them to an echoing huge building thats anti family, where a bleeding statue of a corpse hangs with its mouth gaping open, and an old anal man yelling to the children, "YOU'RE GOING TO HELL" <br>  <br>  When Hell came from mythology, but hey children are innocent and kind, they'll believe in anything, even that their Christian parents "love" them, when they only had them for their god and to "go forth and multiply" <br>  <br>  Do you know how many kids this produces? They breed like rats~! Save a few kids in Africa? NO! They're too busy tending to their meaningless kids that have no love and overpopulating the Earth until we all starve to death and eat eachother. <br>  <br>  <br>  Then they fill people's heads with the idea that it's okay to hate. They go outside other religions churches or a gay support meeting with their signs threatening people and whatnot. And the thing is, children in this age, raised by gay parents, usually turn out straight anyway, but really good people, because their parents, being a minority, find it impossible to hate something innocent, because they too have been hated for no reason. <br>  <br>  I'm surrounded by those Christians everyday.

In those days Dildos were known as “Household Gods” that anybody in the family could use…! <br>  <br>  Genesis 31:19, 34-35 (NIV) When Laban had gone to shear his sheep, Rachel stole her father's household gods. [34-35] Now Rachel had taken the household gods* (*dildos not smooth, but in the form of Heathen Gods for that extra feeling!) and put them inside her camel's saddle* (*I am not sure if this is a colloquial for something else!) and was sitting on them. Laban searched through everything in the tent but found nothing. Rachel said to her father, "Don't be angry, my lord, that I cannot stand up in your presence; I'm having my period."* (*was she squatting?) So he searched but could not find the household gods.* (*at least one of them must have slipped inside her vagina already…! Rachel seemed to have stolen ALL OF THE DILDOS from his daddy’s home.

Saint Paul did not reprimand his mother at all, but he suggested that the young man be delivered to Satan WITHOUT any hearing or counseling!

Most Christians refuse to agree with God, but according to the Bible writers JERUSALEM IS MUCH MORE SINFUL THAN SODOM...!!) and your daughters have done. ”Now this was the sin of your sister Sodom: She and her daughters were arrogant, overfed and unconcerned; they did not help the poor and needy...* (*Neither God the Father nor Jesus Christ EVER MENTIONED THAT THE SIN OF SODOM was homosexuality, but God hated their carefree living and so he had to destroy Sodom! Jesus said the same thing about Sodom Mat 10:15, 11:24, Mar 6:11. Luc 10:12) [53] "However, I* (*God) will restore the fortunes of Sodom and her daughters and of Samaria and her daughters, and your fortunes along with them… [55] And your sisters, SODOM WITH HER DAUGHTERS and Samaria with her daughters, WILL RETURN TO WHAT THEY WERE BEFORE; and you and your daughters will return to what you were before!<br>  <br>  Hardly any Christian pays attention to what they read in the Bible. They honestly know the crap that they need to discard! Still the Bible says plainly that the destruction of Sodom was a mistake because Jerusalem turned out to be much more “sinful.” God FULLY APOLOGIZES and will see that the Sodomites WILL BE FULLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY RESTORED to what they were BEFORE THEIR DESTRUCTION any time soon… Praise the LORD!

It is hard to imagine both the kings of the earth and hardheaded businessmen bewailing the destruction of a church! These leaders are bewailing the destruction of an entity in which their power and wealth are involved, placing them in grave danger of overwhelming loss because Babylon is no longer able to consume their products.<br>  <br>  Notice in Revelation 18:3, 7, 19, and 23 how clear the inferences and direct statements are regarding wealth, not only of Babylon itself, but also of those who trade with her. How can these scriptures apply to a church? Modern Israel has been largely responsible for causing the prosperity of Germany, Japan, Taiwan, South Korea, and now China through trade."<br>  ---<br>  NKJV Study Bible Commentary says ... "From this point on in Revelation, the voice of the bridegroom and bride is heard only in regard to "the marriage of the Lamb" (19:7-9) and the New Jerusalem, "a bride adorned for her husband" (21:2).

DfDss68haa	So true:<br>  <a href="http://stuffblackpeoplehate.com/2008/08/22/cherokees/" rel="nofollow">http://stuffblackpeoplehate.com/2008/08/...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://stuffblackpeoplehate.com/2008/05/13/creole-chicks/" rel="nofollow">http://stuffblackpeoplehate.com/2008/05/...</a><br>  <br>  This is interesting becuase I have noticed the same thing but with White people. <br>  <br>  I have heard light skinned (like the kind of light skinned that indicates obvious European ancestory) Blacks latch onto the explanation that Africans come in different colors so it's possible to be light skinned and not mixed. Which is true so we shouldn't automatically assume light skinned = mixed with white BUT it's obvious in some cases like your grandmother that there is some white in there. I have heard these types say that they don't like to think of being part white becuase of another big misconception--that being part white means a black woman ancestor got raped by a slave master. I just don't believe this urban myth. I don't want to downplay the suffering that slaves suffered and I am 100% sure there were rapes but there just wasn't enough slave holders to explain why so many Blacks are mixed with white. It's much more likely that the micegenation occured AFTER slavery. I mean many Blacks are unaware that there was an entire system set up where Black women were mistresses to rich white men. It was called placage. You can argue it was a form of rape becuase many of these women were disadvantaged and were sold in what amounts to prostitution against their will. <br>  Plus many Blacks spent their lives being racist against whites. It's cognitive dissonance, it would lower their status if they admitted they were white. <br>  <br>  Which brings me to White people who sooner admit to being Native American than admit to being Black. Just like Blacks will sooner admit to having some Indian in there and in fact will go out of their way to tell you about their Cherokee great great great great grandmother, there are an equal amount of Whites who will will claim Native American before Black. White don't want to claim being Black becuase traditionally admitting Black heritage has meant you are all Black so admitting Native American heritage gives them the exoticness without actually making them inferior. Plus White and Black people like to talk about their Native American ancestory becuase it sounds regal and gives them rights to this land. I always love to bust White people's bubble who eagerly claim Native American by pointing out that many tribes intermingled extensively with Black slaves. So next time a White person talks about their Cherokee ancestory point out it's likely they have black in them. Hehe|`|286158035f0bdbcd6406fc818ecc200faa	Did you ever happen to think that she might actually have native americans in her background?  During the Civil War, the Cherokee, the Crow and the Seminole all sheltered and hid runaway slaves, making them tribal members and often intermarrying with them.  You might question her more closely as to exactly what tribe she identifies with and whether she can tell you stories about other tribally connected ancestors/relatives (probably very interesting).<br>  <br>  Also, all native americans do not look alike.  There are blue-eyed native americans as well - probably dating back to the lost Jamestown, VA, colony.<br>  <br>  I'm not black, but I Do know a bit about the history of the Civil War era and about several native american populations.

(pardon the pun, but I just couldn't resist)<br>  <br>  I actually think it's a beautiful thing. It's just like any other "father-daughter" dance. It's no more creepy than the father dancing with his daughter at her wedding. <br>  <br>  At these purity balls, the daughters make a vow to abstain from sex until they are married. The father does not vow to "protect their virginity," but instead to set a good example by always remaining faithful to the girl's mothers and by never watching/reading pornography. <br>  <br>  The girls who go to these purity balls with their fathers are actually far less likely to have sex before marriage, and they tend to ahve a closer relationship with their father, giving them a healther self-concept as well as a healthier relationship with men in the future. I think these purity balls are a wonderful idea!|`|S4XUl7qWaa	It's totally creepy.

Because of the fall of our first parents, we are born with original sin (which is washed away in baptism) Personal sin, knowing something is wrong and choosing to do it anyway is a possibilty only because of our free will nature. If by "evil people" you mean people who only do evil you are mistaken, even if you consider that someone may do more evil than good I think honest evaluation shows very few examples and these may be explained by a disfunctioning brain which would not result in personal sin. Most people (those that can properly reason and discern without handicap) regardless of whether they believe in God or not, are guided by their nature to do good and avoid evil (read Aquinas on natural law) it is the law written in their hearts. Even Hitler presumably cared about his family. People still do evil things by choice, but there are no fully or even prodominantly evil people, it is against our nature.<br>  <br>  EDIT; Sorry apparently contrary to S.D.A. theology, Sabbath keepers are not the only ones created in his image.

And just because God is a wonderful loving God that gives us freedom of choice does not mean that it is ok to sin.

All he wants is for us to learn how to make a working society, he wants th ebest for us and wants us to do it for ourselves so he knows we are capable. you cannot ptractice sin, all you can do is live how oyu like and make te best of it. All you can do is help others and hope your actions make an impact that is positive, not negative. Being a christian myself, many times I ask myself whether or not the commandments are vague. Killing is wrong, but what killing? killing of  ahuman life? Animal life? A dream? hope? <br>  <br>  Overalll, the idea that God will send a lightning bolt down to everyone that screws up is ridiculous. There is too much effort for that and with the amount f demons and dark energy that abounds, i am unsure of our concerns about sinning match the needs of demons and the like. <br>  <br>  sinning is learning, and it is not sin if you do something like go out and have an orgy or however that goes, feel bad about it and not do it again. sinning is not stealing, feelig bad, taking that object back and not doing it again.

The problem with a lot of non-Catholics is they don't know the significance of Easter nor are they aware of the sacred traditions passed down by the Apostles of Christ which are preserved and practiced only in the Catholic Church and ignorance of the same is no basis to call any holy days such as Easter, Christmas or others as pagans. There might have been pagan holidays coinciding with such days but we don't celebrate pagan gods on those days but Christ the redeemer of the world and the foundation of the Catholic Church.|`|vhlORK4Waa	There was no goddess Eostre, which many ill informed Pagans believe was a festival taken over by Christians<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eostre" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eostre</a><br>  <br>  It's an adequate starting point if you haven't the ability to read the original sources in OE, Latin and OHG.<br>  <br>  Note where it tells us that the Grimm Brothers made up all the stuff on Ostara but had no evidence to back it up.<br>  <br>  Also you might try here<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.nabkal.de/beda/beda_15.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.nabkal.de/beda/beda_15.html</a><br>  <br>  which gives you the original in Latin, with the glosses in OE.

It is one of the traditions of men that we are warned against following. Christians should celebrate Passover as did our Savior.<br>  <br>  The truth is that the resurrection was near the end of the weekly 7th day Sabbath (our Saturday) exactly 72 hours after He was placed in the tomb. Anyone who tells you anything else is calling Christ a liar. If it was NOT 72 hours, then He is NOT your Savior. The only sign that He gave that proves His identity is Matthew 12:40. Three days and three nights cannot possibly fit into Friday evening to before sunrise Sunday. You cannot even count, if you believe in a Friday crucifixion, Sunday as a day because the scriptures say He was already risen BEFORE the women got to the tomb and that it was still dark.<br>  <br>  Several links where you can study the truth for yourself:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.tomorrowsworld.org/cgi-bin/tw..." rel="nofollow">http://www.tomorrowsworld.org/cgi-bin/tw...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.ucg.org/booklets/JC/" rel="nofollow">http://www.ucg.org/booklets/JC/</a><br>  <br>  To truly understand what went on during the week of the crucifixion, you need to study the Biblical Holy Days:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://media.pcog.org/en/Literature/PAG_..." rel="nofollow">http://media.pcog.org/en/Literature/PAG_...</a><br>  <br>  To give you a basic overview, because you really need to study this vital truth for yourself, in the Bible, the days start and end at sunset:<br>  <br>  Crucifixion week:<br>  <br>  Our Tuesday evening (Sunset started the 14th day of Exodus 10-12) Yeshua ate the Passover with His disciples and instituted the bread and wine ceremony as a memorial to His death. That night He was betrayed, arrested, taken to the High Priest's house. The next morning (our Wednesday) very early before the morning sacrifices began at the Temple, He was taken to the Sanhedrin. Peter denied Him, most likely about the time the Temple Crier (Not a rooster) was calling for the morning sacrifices to begin. <br>  <br>  After being shuttled back and forth between Herod and Pilate, He is finally condemned, tortured, and crucified and died on the cross late Wednesday afternoon and was placed in the tomb before the sunset that ended that day. This was the preparation day for the 1st High Sabbath of the year, the first day of Unleavened Bread (Again read the Exodus account and Leviticus 23).<br>  <br>  This period of time from sunrise Wednesday to sunset Wednesday is also the preparation day for the High day Sabbath mentioned in John's account.<br>  <br>  Night 1<br>  Sunset Wednesday to Sunrise Thursday. The High Day Sabbath, the first day of Unleavened Bread, or the Passover of the Jews, mentioned in John's account (19:31) began at this sunset<br>  <br>  Day1<br>  Sunrise Thursday to sunset Thursday. It is still the High day Sabbath.<br>  <br>  Night 2<br>  Sunset Thursday to sunrise Friday began the preparation day for the weekly Sabbath.<br>  <br>  Day 2<br>  Sunrise Friday to sunset Friday. This is the daytime portion of the preparation day for the weekly Sabbath, during which the disciple prepared the spices for the final burial of Yeshua.<br>  <br>  Night 3<br>  Sunset Friday to sunrise Saturday, the weekly Sabbath began at sunset Friday and the disciples rested according to the commandment.<br>  <br>  Day 3<br>  <br>  Sunrise Saturday (Sabbath)to just before sunset Saturday (Sabbath), 72 hours after being placed in the grave before the first Holy Day ends the 3rd day. <br>  <br>  This is so easily proven from the Bible that it is ridiculous that people still believe in a Good Friday/Easter Sunday scenario. Like so many other practices and beliefs of traditional Christianity, it is rooted in pagan worship of heathen gods and has no Biblical basis whatsoever.<br>  <br>  Bottom line;  Which do we love more, God and the truth or the false traditions of man?<br>  <br>  Deuteronomy 12:30  Take heed to thyself that thou be not snared by following them, after that they be destroyed from before thee; and that thou enquire not after their gods, saying, How did these nations serve their gods? even so will I do likewise.|`|ZE9eTtRhaa	The traditions in my church is celebrating his resurrection on sunday "He Is Risen!" and the death for our sins was on Friday.

The first human authorized by God to perform water baptism was John the son of Zechariah and Elizabeth. (Lu 1:5-7,?57) The very fact that he was known as “John the Baptist” or “the baptizer” (Mt 3:1; Mr 1:4) implies that baptism or water immersion came to the attention of the people especially through John, and the Scriptures prove that his ministry and baptism came from God; they were not of John’s origin. His works were foretold by the angel Gabriel as from God (Lu 1:13-17), and Zechariah prophesied by holy spirit that John would be a prophet of the Most High to make Jehovah’s ways ready. (Lu 1:68-79) Jesus confirmed that John’s ministry and baptism were from God. (Lu 7:26-28) The disciple Luke records that “God’s declaration came to John the son of Zechariah in the wilderness. So he came .?.?. preaching baptism.” (Lu 3:2,?3) The apostle John states of him: “There arose a man that was sent forth as a representative of God: his name was John.”—Joh 1:6.<br>  Further understanding of the meaning of John’s baptism is gained by comparing various translations of Luke 3:3. John came “preaching baptism in symbol of repentance for forgiveness of sins” (NW); “baptism conditioned on repentance” (CB); “baptism whereby men repented, to have their sins forgiven” (Kx); “baptism in token of repentance for the forgiveness of sins” (NE); “Turn away from your sins and be baptized, and God will forgive your sins” (TEV). These renderings make plain that the baptism did not wash away their sins, but the repentance and changing of their ways did, and of this, baptism was a symbol.<br>  The baptism performed by John was therefore not a special cleansing from God through his servant John, but a public demonstration and symbol of the individual’s repentance over his sins against the Law, which was to lead them to Christ. (Ga 3:24) John thereby prepared a people to “see the saving means of God.” (Lu 3:6) His work served to “get ready for Jehovah a prepared people.” (Lu 1:16,?17) Such a work had been prophesied by Isaiah and Malachi.—Isa 40:3-5; Mal 4:5,?6.<br>  Some scholars try to read anticipation of John’s baptism and the Christian baptism in ancient purification ceremonies under the Law (Ex 29:4; Le 8:6; 14:8, 31,?32; Heb 9:10, ftn) or in individual acts. (Ge 35:2; Ex 19:10) But these instances bear no analogy to the real meaning of baptism.|`|AA11232725	John didn't forgive sins. His mission was to prepare a people for the Lord. The key word is "repentance". John's baptism was foreshadowing the spiritual baptism into Christ that would come to those who realized that they were sinners in need of a Savior.<br>  <br>  Romans 6:1  What shall we say then? Shall we continue in sin that grace may abound?  2  Certainly not! How shall we who died to sin live any longer in it?  3  Or do you not know that as many of us as were baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into His death?  <br>  <br>  4  Therefore we were buried with Him through baptism into death, that just as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life.  5  For if we have been united together in the likeness of His death, certainly we also shall be in the likeness of  His resurrection,  6  knowing this, that our old man was crucified with  Him, that the body of sin might be done away with, that we should no longer be slaves of sin.  7  For he who has died has been freed from sin.  <br>  <br>  8  Now if we died with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with Him,  9  knowing that Christ, having been raised from the dead, dies no more. Death no longer has dominion over Him.  10  For the death that He died, He died to sin once for all; but the life that He lives, He lives to God.  11  Likewise you also, reckon yourselves to be dead indeed to sin, but alive to God in Christ Jesus our Lord.  <br>  <br>  12  Therefore do not let sin reign in your mortal body, that you should obey it in its lusts.  13  And do not present your members as instruments of unrighteousness to sin, but present yourselves to God as being alive from the dead, and your members as instruments of righteousness to God.  14  For sin shall not have dominion over you, for you are not under law but under grace.<br>  <br>  1 Corinthians 12:13  For by one Spirit we were all baptized into one body--whether Jews or Greeks, whether slaves or free--and have all been made to drink into one Spirit.|`|ec0b60fee25a982ef565651fd4f465d1aa	1-Mark 16:15,16 - "He Who Believes and Is Baptized Will Be Saved." <br>  Man says; He who believes is saved and may then be baptized. <br>  bible says; "He Who Believes and Is Baptized Will Be Saved <br>  <br>  2-Acts 2:38 - "Repent and Be Baptized for Remission of Sins" <br>  Are sins forgiven (remitted) before baptism or as a result of it? Note that the purpose of baptism is clearly stated: it is for remission of sins.Consider the people to whom Peter was speaking. <br>  <br>  If "for" means "because they already had remission," then Peter must have been talking to saved people. Was he? <br>  <br>  He had just convicted them of the sin of killing Jesus (v36), and they were pricked in heart and asked what to do (v37). They did not already have remission, but stood in need of receiving it. <br>  <br>  Peter then told them to "repent." If they already had remission, why did they need to repent?

It was the power of God through repentance and faith.|`|i6Mi8uWIaa	It was God's Holy Will that made John's baptisms so powerful. God had already set in motion the events that would lead up to the crucifixion of His Son, Jesus. As John the Baptist, Jesus' cousin, was baptizing, yet still he knew that Jesus was greater. <br>  <br>  Baptism cleans us of all sins committed by us before our baptism, including, and most importantly, original sin. This is why we baptize infants, to wash away the stain of original sin so that they may start life with a clean slate. <br>  <br>  When an adult chooses to be baptized, they are repenting and being washed clean. Any sins from before the baptism are automatically forgiven. When we baptize an infant, original sin is gone, and their parents and godparents are not only promising to help guide the new baby and raise the baby as a Christian, but also renewing their own baptismal promises. <br>  <br>  However, it was Jesus who really made baptism powerful. First, when he came to his cousin to be baptized, by being baptized, Himself, Christ made baptism a holy sacrament. Second, through His order to His disciples to go and baptize in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit, Christ showed very much that baptism is necessary. Finally, at His Crucifixion, both blood and water poured out of Christ's side, which is why when we are baptized, we say that we are washed in the blood of Christ, having died with Him through our baptism so that we may then rise with Him. <br>  <br>  So it was Christ that made John's baptisms so powerful, and it was God's Holy Will that made John's baptisms valid before he baptised Christ.
RTaimrg7aa	The word is a combination of Sex (meaning gender) and the suffix "-ist" from latin meaning "one who"  the meaning literally is one who emphasis one sex over another presumably their own but it could go the other way in a self depreciating manner.|`|bEynoNf6aa	No.  The Bible would actually be considered sexist by most modern definitions.  There are many passages, particularly in the Old Testaments, calling for the submission and even oppression of women.<br>  <br>  Examples:<br>  <br>  If a betrothed virgin is raped in the city and doesn't cry out loud enough, then "the men of the city shall stone her to death." (Deuteronomy)<br>  <br>  Paul points out in New Testament Romans that "the natural use" of women is to provide men with sex. (Romans)<br>  <br>  In the Bible's book of Deuteronomy it says that if a man marries a woman and then decides that he hates her, he can claim she wasn't a virgin when they married. At that point her father must prove she was a virgin. (How is not explained.)  If he can't, then the girl is to be stoned to death at her father's doorstep.|`|pus08YEOaa	The men, not God, who wrote the Bible certainly weren't sympathetic to women by any means.

Most of us belong to one of three different nations who claim to worship the God of Abraham, thru three different traditions and scriptures (Israelite/ OT, Roman/ Gospel, Arab/ Quran). We have all found ways of ignoring something Allah told the other two nations was very important. For example,<br>  <br>  It would be blasphemy for Jews & Muslims to accept the divinity of a human form (Jesus). However, it maybe He will be lenient to Christians on this matter. After all, your Gospel is not as forthright on the issue as the OT & Quran.  In the same way, I believe that Allah will be lenient to Muslims who do not accept the Gospel and OT as scripture, because he was not as forthright on the matter in the Quran as he was in the Gospel and OT. This I believe is an important issue to recognize.<br>  <br>  <br>  The reason for why Allah has done this is, Allah is a merciful and forgiving God. He has given us a scripture that can, at the very minimum, be reconciled with our respective tribal traditions, so it does not burden us too much.  Those who accept atleast one of these scriptures, in this way, in my opinion, will probably go to some level of Heaven. However, there are many levels of Heaven and those who obey him best, may make it to a higher level of Heaven than others. He has put us in a world where we are forced to accept the existence of  other nations with other traditions and scriptures of Allah than ours. Those who understand his plan the best will attain a place in the highest levels of Heaven.|`|6Z4fKZ8aaa	That verse only applies to Jews, Christians, and Sabians before the Prophet Muhammad(SAW). Now you have to believe in Allah(SWT) and Muhammad(SAW) and die a MUSLIM to get to Jinnah.

It is because they and Muhammad(pbuh) were all sent to do the SAME job, to tell people to worship the same, invisible God. <br>  <br>  But when Moses died, Jews started worshipping idols and disobeying rules, hence Jesus was sent. <br>  Jesus died and people started worshipping HIM, calling themselves 'Christians'. <br>  Hence, Allah sent Muhammad as the last messenger, clearing all misconceptions. It is now upto us to accept him.<br>  This is why we believe everybody is a muslim-it is the name, not a separate group, for those who submit to God. In short, a person who takes partners to Allah, and those who do not worship Him, or follow His rules(this applies to those also who do not take partners) cannot go to heaven. <br>  <br>  36:14 When We sent to them two messengers, they denied them. We<br>  then strengthened them with a third and they said, "Surely, We have<br>  been sent to you."<br>  36:15 But the people said, "You are nothing but human beings like us.<br>  The Beneficent has never revealed anything. You are but lying.” <br>  36:16 Said the messengers, "Our Lord knows that we have been sent to you.<br>  <br>  36:17 And our duty is only to convey the message clearly."<br>  36:18 The people said, "We consider you bad omens. If you do not<br>  desist, we will surely stone you, and grievous punishment will befall you at our hands."<br>  36:19 The messengers replied, "Your destiny rests with yourselves, now that you have been reminded.<br>  <br>  Allah may have separated us into nations, but we are all the one and the same for Him, and He wants us all to be one.

The Bible as it stands today is a corrupted text. Ayah 2:62 that you have quoted you need to put it into context which you obviously have not fully understood and then arrogantly seek to advise people about it without consultation of a tafseer or at least the knowledge of a Shaikh.

lJ2baVliaa	No, let's show those who choose that lifestyle and any other lifestyle for that matter, the love of Jesus Christ.  We know the act is a sin because God tells us that.  We also know that the act of homosexuality is no more severe a sin than any other sexual sin or any other sin for that matter.  James 2:10 says: "For whoever keeps the whole law and yet stumbles at just one point is guilty of breaking all of it." So someone who lies is no less guilty than the person who commits the act of homosexuality.<br>  <br>  We are not to judge.  We are to show them the love of Christ and teach them gently and with compassion.<br>  <br>  Let me explain it in a way some may understand.  Lets say a man was with a girl, and they lived together.  God tells the man in the Bible that he can't live with the woman (because they aren't married) So he says, I'll move out and abstain from sex until we can be married.  The woman gets mad and dumps him.  His heart is no less broken and in pain than that of a person who must give up someone they love in a gay relationship.  In fact, giving up the gay relationship is more painful because there is no reconciliation with their former partner if the person plans to follow God... whereas the straight relationship can reconcile through marriage.  That's why we must be compassionate and gentle when dealing with this issue.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps.|`|FMuSs9Qtaa	I don't and you should think before you type stupid **** on here, let people be, how would you feel if someone told you you could'nt be someone you love??? and being gay is not a choice|`|97d2a2d9ef8fc8e73e2d9c8436cd4609aa	Faithfully Lithia is absolutely right and she gets my vote.

But YOU have been washed clean, but YOU have been sanctified, but YOU have been declared righteous in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ and with the spirit of our God. <br>  <br>  <br>  God does not hate any of these people, just their actions. Here we could see that homosexuals, this includes lesbians, will not inherit gods kingdom. But, if you love Jehovah God, and want to please him and want to live forever, you would make the change like so many others did from the past. This doesn't mean that you will get rid off all of these gay feelings in one day or ever, but praying constantly and doing what is right in Gods eyes will help in staying strong. <br>  <br>  Those who say "God loves me anyways no matter what I do" are fooling themselves and only want to do what they want. And are probably not God fearing people.

We believe that when Peter died, he took those keys with him. We need these keys to do the basics in our church, this includes even the simplest things including Baptism, having the power to  bless and pass the sacrament, and giving priesthood blessings to anoint the sick. Then of course comes the priesthood authority to do other things such as marriages, sealings, and endowments. Without the Prophet having those keys and passing them along to other worthy male members, we'd have no church.. <br>  <br>  While any member can pray and have their own personal revelation. The prophet is the *only* person who can receive revelation for the entire church. No other member can have that sort of revelation.|`|FyLfEPv0aa	But that's the point!<br>  <br>  The bible are records of what prophets told people to strengthen their faith in Christ and prepare them for trials.<br>  <br>  So that's why we have a prophet.<br>  <br>  It's odd that you place so much value in the bible - the word of God - yet wouldn't see the value in a prophet speaking the words of God.<br>  <br>  From time to time there is also council given to the church such as 13 years ago we were told to get out of debt and lower our mortgages, not to refinance our homes to benefit ourselves but to become financially secure.

They could have prayed and recieved their own personal revelation.  They didn't need Moses did they?<br>  <br>  What about those who followed Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Daniel, or Isaiah?  Did they really need a prophet?  Couldn't God have just spoken directly to the hearts of their followers?<br>  <br>  The answer is in the Bible.  Amos 3:7 "Surely the Lord God will do nothing, but he revealeth his secret unto his servants the prophets"<br>  <br>  Sure God is all powerful, and he has chosen to do things via prophets.  He choses prophets.  They teach the people and write down their words.  The Bible is 4000 years of this process.  Why didn't God just choose one prophet, have him write everything we needed in the Bible, and then stop calling them?  The pattern of the Bible is that God reveals his truths through prophets.  <br>  <br>  Would you have accepted the words of Abraham had you lived in his time?  They Jews rejected Jesus Christ because they were so hung up on the words of the dead prophets that they didn't recognize their own Messiah when they spoke with him face to face.  <br>  <br>  Additionally, the Bible prophecies that there will be more prophets in the future.  So, the question to you is:  What are you doing to correctly identify true, living prophets of God?|`|BtygS0Hraa	Umm, modern revelation maybe.  God is the same yesterday, today, and forever.

He is the same today as he was back then.  God also has not revealed everything to mankind or completed all of his works.  <br>  <br>  If you doubt that he has more to tell us you ought to read the Doctrine and Covenants.  The increase of knowledge that you can gain from what God revealed to the prophet Joseph Smith is astounding.  Their are some very important and relevant verses about the Priesthood.  A subject that is not adequately covered in the Bible.  <br>  <br>  Also, think of Moses.  What would have happened to the Israelites if they would have chosen not to believe in Moses as a prophet and to follow him?  What if they would have said, "We have Abraham as our prophet, we don't need any other."  Or what about Jesus Christ himself what if the people would of rejected him and his message and refused to believe that he was the Son of God?  Oh wait, they did that already didn't they and still today they don't accept him.  Hummm sounds like the same reasoning to me as those who say that we don't need a prophet anymore.|`|8ubAwaGCaa	"There is nothing new under the sun," or so people say.<br>  <br>  However, since God's only purpose in dealing with man is our eternal welfare, arising from his great love for us, he's at times going to give specific instructions for specific situations to make sure that the greatest number possible of his children can return to him.  This is why the early Christian church taught that the gospel is preached to the dead and that the dead can accept vicarious baptism on their behalf if they wish to do so (it isn't obligatory, so you don't need to be offended if some idiot in my church performs a baptism by proxy for somebody you know -- his intentions were good, even if pride or folly filled his heart, and he can't turn an unwilling Baptist or fundamentalist into a Mormon any more than he can turn cheese into milk.)  Because the world killed the apostles and the authority to administer these ordinances was lost (along with the realization that it is necessary to do so), at least some revelation and restoration of authority was necessary.<br>  <br>  There are trials or persecutions or situations that Jesus' believers face now that might not have occurred before.  Note that Amos, Joel, and John the Beloved have all gone on record indicating the necessity of revelation in the last days, even to prophets.  Indeed, John prophesied that the everlasting gospel would have to be restored to the earth by an angel in the last days.  That would count both as a revelation and a dispensation of authority and correct doctrines.<br>  <br>  Come to think of it, knowing that God is in charge and has a prophet on the earth to give us due warning in due season is rather comforting, considering the way things are going now.  I shudder when I imagine facing the disturbances, disasters, and death predicted for the last days without any more guidance than my own wits and prayers.<br>  <br>  Frankly, there are so many divisions and so much hatred in the Christian world that a prophet would be a breath of fresh air, allowing us to understand which interpretations of the Bible are correct, if any.  In areas where no correct understanding exists, revelation to a prophet can set the record straight.  To quote Bugs Bunny, "You realize, of course, this means war," because it means that a prophet is never going to be able to please everybody, much less the people who find out they were mistaken.  <br>  <br>  Even truths that were lost from the Bible can be restored via a prophet.  For example, please read Zechariah 13:2-5.  If you do, you will certainly say, so what?  It deals with a false prophet.  Now read verse six.  Does that sound like a false prophet to you?  I think that one of the most important prophecies of Jesus Christ that was ever given was edited out of the Holy Bible because it was just too much for somebody centuries ago.  I might point out that in verse one, there is a prophecy that could, symbolically, refer to a major conversion or revival event in Palestine -- or Eretz Yisrael, if you prefer -- resulting in either baptisms or other ceremonial washings, perhaps according to the Law.  Whether that is to occur in the last days like the verses that follow it, or it refers to Jesus' ministry, I leave up to your interpretation -- until a prophet happens to explain it better than I can.<br>  <br>  You're probably not interested in any Latter-day Saint specific scriptures, so if you wish just stop reading now.  I call to mind one scripture where Jesus states that his house is "a house of order."  I guess that one of the things he means is that he's not going to implement a holy reverse 911 system with the Holy Ghost.  He's going to give whatever warning is necessary for the world or his church to a prophet, as promised by Amos; he is going to give whatever warning is necessary for a local congregation to a bishop/pastor (assuming the bishop is humble and good); and he is going to give whatever warning is necessary for a family to the father of the family or (in cases of widowhood or other single parenting) to the mother.  It's not that any of these people are necessarily more or less important than any of the others.  It's just an orderly and economical way for Jesus to make use of his time, which I gather is rather important.<br>  <br>  Regardless of how you view this, I hope you have a lovely day.|`|2ZO7vFC1aa	10 years ago our prophet warned the world to get out of debt.  Look where we are now.  The Bible is very valuable, but it doesn't always specifically address modern issues.  A prophet is a conduit through which God DOES address modern issues.  It boggles my mind why people think a prophet would be a BAD thing.  God used prophets throughout history (it wasn't bad then, why would it be bad now), and even after Jesus, God continued to reveal new things to Peter and Paul.  And then God just stopped?  Isn't God the same yesterday, today, and forever?|`|AA12365543	It keeps order in the church.  That is why the church grows and has probably the most devote Christians on the planet who live and work within society.<br>  <br>  While other churches fall apart and have "sunday christians"|`|T0SNBKOKaa	Joseph Smith didn't have a prophet to guide him. What makes him so freaking special? He was just a kid that said, "Dear god, this sh** don't make no sense. Please tell me why." <br>  <br>  Let's, for the sake of argument, entertain that JS was in fact visited by God and God jr. Why the hell can't everyone have a visitation? Why does JS get a pass on having to have blind faith when the rest of us are asked to follow blindly and hope our gut feeling isn't just imagination influenced by our fears?|`|AA10637643	The prophet serves as the mouthpiece for the Lord - for the church as a whole.  We as members are still entitled to our own personal revelation, the prophet doesn't take that away.<br>  <br>  Jesus Christ said He would reveal nothing, except it be through his prophets.  There is much counsel the prophets have given us that is not contained in the bible, such as not watching R rated movies, not watching or viewing pornography, not getting into debt (where in the bible is that?), living within our means, food storage, where new temples and churches should be built, the instigation of new programs like the Perpetual Education Fund, etc.  The prophet also tells us what we need to know for OUR day.  We don't live in bible times.  That doesn't mean we don't still NEED the bible, it means we are at different stages of technology and different temptations.  Do you think 2000 years ago people had to worry about their 15 year old dating too young?  Or wearing immodest clothing?  Or what about porn on the internet?<br>  <br>  The prophet is chosen to lead and guide the church as Christ would, to be His mouthpiece, and to oversee the church.<br>  <br>  Apparently we DO need the prophet to tell us to get out of debt... look at our economy.  Can you imagine how much better off we would be if EVERYONE took the counsel of the prophet???<br>  His message is for everyone, it's not just the members that benefit from what he counsels.  It's just sad the rest of the world doesn't now that.|`|6DmsiLGbaa	Of course we can get personal inspiration through prayer!  That's the whole point of prayer.  Still, God is hardly going to give, say, inspiration to me about you.  I have no authority or even a relationship with you, so of course I'm not entitled to inspiration about you.  Nor am I entitled to inspiration over the world as a whole.  A prophet, however, would be.  The whole point in having a prophet is to pass God's word and God's warnings to the people, which is precisely why God has always called them.  When the people needed someone to warn them about the Great Flood, the prophet Noah was there.  When they needed someone to provide guidance as they prepared to leave Egypt, Moses was called.  For whatever crises there has been, the prophet has always been there, ready to guide and lead and protect.<br>  <br>  ...which is precisely why we still need a prophet today.  As wonderful as the words of past prophets are and as much as they can teach us, they're still just that: PAST prophets.  Somehow, I don't think Moses had to help people facing pornography or drug addictions.  He didn't have to guide people through a dying economy or help them cope with broken families.  Many of the problems we face are unique to our time, which is exactly why we need a prophet for our time.  And if anything, I'd say that we need a prophet more today than ever, especially since so many have closed their hearts to God and aren't even praying.  It's a little difficult, after all, to receive inspiration and revelation when one isn't speaking or listening to God at all.|`|3v9rL5xLaa	Why did people in Bible times need a Prophet, and we don't? Don't you think God loves his children in these times enough to provide direction to them also?<br>  We do believe in personal prayer and revelation, but I can't receive revelation for you. That is why it's personal.<br>  A Prophet is the Lord's mouthpiece on earth and I am grateful God still speaks to us through a living prophet.|`|AA10644435	It is about authority.  The prophets and apostles have always had authority over the Church as a whole, having their guidance given to them by Christ, then there were bishops, and others that had authority over smaller sections gaining their guidance given to them by those in authority over them as well as Christ himself through the Holy Ghost.  They have stewardship over their calling.<br>  <br>  And yes, we each have authority over ourselves and those that we are put in charge of...ie children...and we are given guidance by those with authority over us and Christ himself through the Holy Ghost.<br>  <br>  Gods house is a house of order.  It is God's authority that Leads the Church...the same authority and power that created the universe and all that is in it.|`|C5yCtJ3Baa	What need did the Israelites have for prophets (other than Jesus Christ) after Moses, or even after Israel (Jacob) himself, or Isaac, or Abraham, or Noah, or Adam for that matter? Perhaps there is a deeper lesson that can be learned here, and I assure you that if you can answer the question I have just posted, you will see more clearly why Latter-day Saints believe there is a need for prophets today.<br>  <br>  I encourage you to learn more about who we as Latter-day Saints, we desire sincerely to live in Christian harmony with you and afford you your rights to believe as we desire you also to allow us to believe as we choose. We invite you to present your beliefs if you feel so inclined and ask that you allow us to respectfully share ours.|`|Tcu0NWkUaa	I wasn't going to respond to this question, as I know that you ask a lot of "questions" that attempt to defame and discredit The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and it's members, but then I went the extra mile and read some of the responses you've given to other's questions about the bible being "silly" and such.<br>  <br>  I perceive that you honestly love the Lord and the bible, so I'll try to give a response that I sincerely hope you will read and give some attention to.  If ANYONE ever needed a prophet, don't you think it might be nice to have one today?  Consider all the evil and corruption in the world.  Consider how mankind has turned away from the Lord.  The people of Sodom and Gomorrah NEEDED a prophet, but they gave no heed to him.  The people of Noah's times NEEDED a prophet, yet they gave no heed to Noah.  <br>  <br>  What was the benefit of ANY biblical prophet?  The same need is prevalent today in every wit.  The Old Testament foretold the need for prophets, the New Testament leaders foretold the need for prophets until we all come to a unity of the faith - see Eph. 4.  <br>  <br>  So, I guess we can sum up the answer to your question by just saying that our "need for a prophet" is to be obedient to God.  After all, it is God who calls his prophets and he has done so in our own time.  I love it!  It's wonderful!  God still loves us and has not forgotten us.|`|sKXzYvaRaa	At least there is proof their prophet actually existed...

VYLEfiSTaa	No, they do not, no more than listing three people, such as Tom, Dick, and Harry, means that they are three in one.<br>  <br>  This type of reference, admits McClintock and Strong’s Cyclopedia of Biblical, Theological, and Ecclesiastical Literature, “proves only that there are the three subjects named, .?.?. but it does not prove, by itself, that all the three belong necessarily to the divine nature, and possess equal divine honor.”<br>  <br>  Although a supporter of the Trinity, that source says of 2?Corinthians 13:13 (14): “We could not justly infer that they possessed equal authority, or the same nature.” And of Matthew 28:18-20 it says: “This text, however, taken by itself, would not prove decisively either the personality of the three subjects mentioned, or their equality or divinity.”<br>  <br>  When Jesus was baptized, God, Jesus, and the holy spirit were also mentioned in the same context. Jesus “saw descending like a dove God’s spirit coming upon him.” (Matthew 3:16) This, however, does not say that the three are one. Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob are mentioned together numerous times, but that does not make them one. Peter, James, and John are named together, but that does not make them one either. Furthermore, God’s spirit descended upon Jesus at his baptism, showing that Jesus was not anointed by spirit until that time. This being so, how could he be part of a Trinity where he had always been one with the holy spirit?<br>  <br>  Another reference that speaks of the three together is found in some older Bible translations at 1?John 5:7. Scholars acknowledge, however, that these words were not originally in the Bible but were added much later. Most modern translations rightly omit this spurious verse.|`|rg4lS9E9aa	trinity is a false teaching.

For many biblical references, see: <a href="http://www.cwo.com/~pentrack/catholic/Trinity.txt" rel="nofollow">http://www.cwo.com/~pentrack/catholic/Tr...</a><br>  <br>  Under the influence of the Holy Spirit, the early Christians prayed and struggled over these hints for a couple of centuries. The concept of the Holy Trinity (three equal persons in one God) was mainstream Christianity in 325 C.E. at the Council of Nicaea and our belief is expressed in the Nicene Creed.<br>  <br>  How this works is not fully known and is one the Christian mysteries.<br>  <br>  The doctrine of the Holy Trinity is shared by most Christian denominations including Roman and Orthodox Catholics, Lutherans, Anglicans, Baptists, Methodists, Presbyterians, Pentecostals, Episcopalians, and the Salvation Army.<br>  <br>  For more information, see Catechism of the Catholic Church, sections 232 and following: <a href="http://www.usccb.org/catechism/text/pt1sect2chpt1art1p2.shtml#232" rel="nofollow">http://www.usccb.org/catechism/text/pt1s...</a><br>  <br>  The major non-Trinitarian churches are Christadelphianism, Christian Science, Jehovah’s Witnesses, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Arian Catholicism, Unitarianism, Nontrinitarianism, and Oneness Pentecostals.<br>  <br>  With love in Christ.|`|yQNit56Qaa	Well, I think that the issue is much more complex than you have shown here.<br>  <br>  In fact, there is no short list of Scriptural passages that causes the reader to irresistibly conclude that the doctrine of trinity is being described.<br>  <br>  I think it much more likely that the doctrine of trinity is a sort of religious *theory* which is alone in being in complete agreement with all Scriptures regarding the nature of the relationship between Jesus, the Father and the Holy Spirit.<br>  <br>  Now, let me backtrack a little and explain.  We can show from Scripture - despite what anyone says - that the Father and Jesus are both God (John 20:28; Heb 1:8)<br>  <br>  We also know from Scripture that Jesus prayed to the Father, and that (while on earth, at least) he was subject to the will of the Father.<br>  <br>  Finally, both Jesus himself and the Father in the Old Testament clearly indicate that there is only one God.<br>  <br>  These Scriptures clearly indicate the *beginnings* of trinitarian doctrine.  There is only one God; the Father and Jesus are both God; yet clearly the Father and Jesus are not the same person.<br>  <br>  However, progressing from that point, *logically*, requires more knowledge than I possess.  We know that the Holy Spirit is treated as a person in some passages in the New Testament - but does that make it a "person" of the Godhead?  I can't say, but I think you will admit that mentioning the Holy Spirit in concert with the Father and Jesus is telling - especially when the phrase used is "in the name of...the Holy Spirit", indicating that the Holy Spirit is not only a person, but a person of authority at least *similar* to the Father and Jesus.  This could be considered supporting evidence (not proof!) for the idea that the Holy Spirit is<br>  a) also an integral part of the Godhead<br>  b) is of similar *or* equal authority with the other persons mentioned<br>  <br>  <br>  Conclusions<br>  a) Even someone without collegiate religious education can use logic to determine that something very like the trinity is described by Scripture<br>  b) It is difficult for that same someone to *prove* using Scripture and logic the precise details of the doctrine of trinity - that is, that all 3 persons are members of the trinity, that all 3 are "co-equal" and "co-eternal".  However, such details clearly do not *contradict* Scripture, and there is evidence *supporting* (but not proving) such claims.<br>  <br>  SO, remembering my admittedly lacking education in this area, I conclude that the doctrine of trinity is the most rational explanation of the pertinent Scriptures that is widely supported.  The details may or may not be accurate or verified - *I* am not able to prove them.  However, the primary premises of the doctrine can clearly be deduced from Scripture, and the more precise details are at least partially supported and never contradicted by Scripture.<br>  <br>  Jim, <a href="http://www.bible-reviews.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.bible-reviews.com</a>|`|iAXmdQOEaa	The bible does not teach the trintiy at all.

And if the<br>              Holy Spirit is one of the three that are one, as stated in the<br>              Trinity, here we see they are different, Jesus & the dove, BUT<br>          (3) Now the third part of the trinity speaks & says; this is M Y  <br>              S O N , the beloved, whom I have approved. Why would Jesus<br>              use ventriloquism, magic(the dove), & at the same time be<br>              a fleshly human? To deceive all that were there into thinking<br>              he is three different entities when in fact he's one. Why would<br>              he be so deceiving?

He taught them much while he was with them, and then sent the Holy Spirit to continue to guide them in Truth. The Trinitarian belief goes back to the early days of the Church. For instance, the Trinitarian formula for baptism was taught in the Didache (70 A.D.). There are many references from the Fathers, such as Ignatius of Antioch in 110 A.D., Justin Martyr in 151 A. D.

Many people presume the caucasian race for example only applies to ''white people'' or Europeans rather. However caucasians are anywhere from England to North Africa and everywhere in between and has NOTHING to do with skin tone. People from the same places can even be classes as different things for example some American Indians are classes as mongoloid and some as caucasian. As for what I would consider a black person has nothing to do with skin tone either, for example if I were to see an African albino they would indeed still be African (or black) and their skin tone, hair color ect wouldn't come into it even if they were as white as snow. And if you consider the 6 billion people on the planet all look different, how can anyone be compared to anyone even of the same race as we all look different. It is a very interesting and in-depth issue which is very interesting to read about so you should continue with your research.|`|T1beLIQqaa	DNA(haploid) testing is now able to tell different ethnicities-this is what the human Genome Project is all about-to answer your question-GET A DNA test for each subject.Until 11,000-13,000 years ago-EVERYONE had a golden brown skin tone and either black or brown hair and eyes-different color skin, hair, and eyes than these was actually do to a genetic mutation occuring at that point. I like the old thinking of the anthropologists, that the 5 ethnicities started at different points-that is how they maintained their ethnic traits, not the ou-of-Africa Theory. Incidentally, out-of-Africa does NOT mean everyone was Black or descended from Blacks. Two forms of Homo sapiens(modern humans are a subclassification,Homo sapiens sapiens-the human race-only one), both extinct, existed at the same time-Idaltu(had N*egroid features) and Cro Magnon(had Caucasoid features. Neither had a racial classification.Both had a shade of brown skin and black or brown hair and eyes.Human ancestors before this, had more of Idaltu's characteristics.Ethnic lines are becoming more and more blurred as we become a more blended society.United we stand, divide we fall. Here's to a more united, blended world.If a superior ethnicity existed-that person would have the most desireable characteristics of each of the ethnicities.A pure ethnicity such as Hitler's Aryan blond, blue eyed Whites would have bred themselves out of existence due to "replicative fading"(genes become progressively deteriorated like copies, of copies, of coopies of papers) and inborn genetic errors. This would be from a limited gene pool-incest and inbreeding-this is exactly what is happening with the big cats today.|`|zEoRcL91aa	I can look at a person's shinbones and know where they come from:)<br>   I grew up in S.

You are who you are, and you can't change that. Hopefully they will both understand that soon. <br>  When I told my mom, I also told her I was interested in a girl that she disliked.

It definitely does not always go well, the parents don't always "love you anyway", and in some cases the teen may find himself without a home. Personally, I'd wait until you're at least 18 and able to support yourself, so that your dad won't be able to do anything that will affect you in a truly awful way. Luckily, you have less than a year until that happens. Surely your mom can give you that much time before she opens her mouth.|`|mYe6TDmzaa	Just know this your mom already knows and supports you.

pus08YEOaa	If you read waay earlier translations of the Bible, for every ignorant fool like Paul and passages threatening female rape victims as soiled property, women were important and influential figures. Modern Christianity doesn't have to redefine your faith if you want to stick with the Church and educate from the inside out. It's like, all the Christians who used the Bible to justify slavery and racial discrimination now use different scripture to speak out against them. Christianity doesn't have to be black and white, "female submission," etc.<br>  <br>  Gal. 3:28 There is no Jew nor Greek; there is no bondman nor freeman; there is no male and female; for yea are all one in Christ Jesus.<br>  <br>  I'm not Christian, so I'm not trying to keep or convert you. I assume similar problems of social philosophy reinterpreted as religious philosophy (and vice versa) occur in other religions too. Like past Hindus supported widow-burning, child brides, and honor killings, but they have their own version of the Galatians quote that reaffirms men and women's spiritual equality. <br>  <br>  Then again, Unitarian Universalists are egalitarian, Reform Judaisim has become more and more liberal, and there's always Dianic neopagan traditions like everyone else said.|`|vhlORK4Waa	Wicca<br>  <br>  In Wicca, there is no central body that dictates beliefs, which subsequently enables equality and diversity of expression. <br>  <br>  “Respect for elders is more a mark of your training than your worth”, David Garland from PAN says.<br>  <br>  He commends the lack of a hierarchy “Absolute power corrupts. That’s the whole problem with giving power to anyone that’s human. We’ll always fall”.<br>  <br>  Duality is a key element of Wicca “I believe in the ‘takes two’ principle – male and female; good and bad. Everything needs a counter to be balanced”. <br>  <br>  The revered female<br>  <br>  “The biggest thing with Wicca is that women are treated as equal, if not revered. They aren’t downtrodden, having to keep their heads covered or bow down to anyone”, says Garland.<br>  <br>  Reverend Philip Hughes, researcher with the Christian Research Association (CRA), believes the growth in Wicca is due to dissatisfaction with long historical oppression of women.<br>  <br>  “For many, Wicca involves a protest against powerlessness and repressive sexuality attitudes. Wicca can be a protest explicitly against Christianity, which is seen as having failed women”.<br>  <br>  Wicca was traditionally a female dominated craft. Today the statistics demonstrate that it is becoming more balanced, 75% female and 25% male .|`|u7Vp848Oaa	Christianity. <br>  Many people think it doesn't because of the bible verse in which it says "do not let women have authority over men" but actually in the greek (which is the original it was made in) that type of word authority actually means don't let them be tyrants and dictators, which goes the same for men!

I know that this is very different from what you hear on the media.

If ye take a dislike to them it may be that ye dislike a thing, and God brings about through it a great deal of good. (Surah 4 Verse 19)<br>  <br>  “and live with them honourably”[al-Nisa’ 4:19] <br>  <br>  “And they (women) have rights (over their husbands as regards living expenses) similar (to those of their husbands) over them (as regards obedience and respect) to what is reasonable, but men have a degree (of responsibility) over them. And Allaah is All-Mighty, All-Wise” [al-Baqarah 2:228] <br>  <br>  And the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “I urge you to treat women well.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 331; Muslim, 1468. <br>  <br>  These websites discuss women in Islam:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://sultan.org/#women" rel="nofollow">http://sultan.org/#women</a><br>  <a href="http://www.submission.org/women/compare.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.submission.org/women/compare....</a><br>  <a href="http://jews-for-allah.org/Why-Believe-in-Allah/Jewish-Women-Converting-to-Islam.htm" rel="nofollow">http://jews-for-allah.org/Why-Believe-in...</a><br>  <a href="http://whyislam.org/GenderIssues/BrochureStatusofWomen/tabid/95/Default.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://whyislam.org/GenderIssues/Brochur...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  Also, these are 9 things where Islam differs than Christianity concerning the status of women in the society:<br>  <br>  1) The Bible Convicts Women as the original Sinners (ie. Eve picking from the forbidden tree){Genesis 2:4-3:24}. <br>  <br>  The Koran Clarifies it was Adam Not Eve {Koran 7:19-25} <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  2) The Bible says "The Birth of a Daughter is a loss" {Ecclesiasticus 22:3}. <br>  <br>  The Koran says both are an Equal Blessing {Koran 42:49} <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  3) The Bible forbids women from speaking in church {I Corinthians 14:34-35}. <br>  <br>  The Koran says women can argue with the Prophet {58:1} <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  4) In the Bible, divorced Women are Labeled as an Adulteress, not men {Matthew 5:31-32} <br>  <br>  The Koran does Not have Biblical double standards{Koran 30:21} <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  5) In The Bible, widows and sisters do not inherit Any property or wealth, only men do {Numbers 27:1-11} <br>  <br>  The Koran abolished this male greed {Koran 4:22} and God protects all. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  6) The Bible Allows Multiple Wives {I Kings 11:3} <br>  <br>  In The Koran, God limits the number to 4 only under certain situations (with the wife's permission)and prefers you marry only one wife {Koran 4:3} The Koran gives the woman the right to choose who to marry. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  7) "If a man happens to meet a virgin who is not pledged to be married and rapes her and they are discovered, he shall pay the girl's father fifty shekels of silver. He must marry the girl, for he has violated her. He can never divorce her as long as he lives" {Deuteronomy 22:28-30} <br>  <br>  One must ask a simple question here, who is really punished, the man who raped the woman or the woman who was raped? According to the Bible, you have to spend the rest of your life with the man who raped you. <br>  <br>  The Prophet Muhammad Says {Volume 9, Book 86, Number 101} Narrated by Aisha:"It is essential to have the consent of a virgin (for the marriage)".<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  8) The Bible also asks women to wear veils as in Islam {I Corinthians 11:3-10} <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  9) Women were given rights to Vote less than a 100 years ago in the (US), while the Koran gave women voting rights almost 1,500 years ago. <br>  <br>  <br>  PS:<br>  there was a french translator who translated the Quran, and he said that if he didn't know that Muhammad wrote the Quran (although he really didn't, but it is the words of God) he would have thought that the quran was written by a woman, as it states rights after rights of women!|`|GrRXAjF7aa	Atheism!

Regret for having been caught; regret for things not turning out as you had hoped; etc. But, never a desire to change the way you think and act - hoping for a reconciliation with God.<br>  <br>  Judas' repentance was a worldly sorrow. He even sought repentance from the wrong crowd! He did not seek God for reconciliation.<br>  <br>  "Then Judas, which had betrayed him, when HE SAW THAT HE WAS CONDEMNED, REPENTED himself, and brought again the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders, Saying, I have sinned in that I have betrayed the innocent blood. And they said, What is that to us? see thou to that.  And he cast down the pieces of silver in the temple, and departed, AND WENT AND HANGED HIMSELF."<br>  (Mt.27:3-5)<br>  <br>  "14 Follow peace with all men, and holiness, without which no man shall see the Lord: 15 Looking diligently lest any man fail of the grace of God; lest any root of bitterness springing up trouble you, and thereby many be defiled; 16 Lest there be any fornicator, or profane person, as Esau, who for one morsel of meat sold his birthright. 17 For ye know how that afterward, when he would have inherited the Blessing, he was rejected: for HE FOUND NO PLACE OF REPENTANCE, THOUGH HE SOUGHT IT CAREFULLY WITH TEARS."<br>  (Heb.12:14-17)<br>  <br>  If any man see his brother sin A SIN WHICH IS NOT UNTO DEATH, he shall ask, and he shall give him life for them that sin not unto death. THERE IS A SIN UNTO DEATH: I DO NOT SAY THAT HE SHALL PRAY FOR IT. <br>  (I John 5:16)<br>  <br>  All unrighteousness is sin: and THERE IS A SIN NOT UNTO DEATH.<br>  (I John 5:17)<br>  <br>  <br>  "But every man is tempted, when he is drawn away of his own lust, and enticed. Then when lust hath conceived, it bringeth forth sin: and sin, when it is finished, bringeth forth death.  Do not err, my beloved brethren."<br>  James 1:14-16<br>  <br>  Sin is a process that ends in death. It is a sowing to the flesh. The devil does not tempt us, the flesh (carnal mind) does! The lust of the flesh gets planted like a seed in a womb.The heart conceives and we begin to imagine all the possibilities and ways of getting our desire fulfilled. From that we begin to fall short in our proper attention to God. Our preoccupation of lust finally culminates in action. Then our sin is complete and has brought forth death. <br>  <br>  We all can testify to a sin which so easily besets us; a sin which we seem to keep repenting of to no avail?<br>  <br>  Repentance is properly, a state of continually changing our mind, to the mind of Christ. We can become so grossly entrenched in the action of sin that the only thing which can break this bondage is the Judgment of God! But, thanks be to God that all his judgments are unto correction! Judgment, in scripture, only pertains to our works and actions! Never does it relate to our salvation! <br>  <br>  Paul did not pray for repentance in the man in Corinth who was having sex with his mother-in-law. Paul JUDGED him and turned him over to satan for the destruction of the FLESH (carnal mind). That was a redemptive measure and not a punitive one.

Or if our heart condemns us. If our heart condemns us, we have one who is greater than our hearts. Jesus Christ our Righteousness.<br>  1Jn1:9 If we confess our sins, He is faithful & just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.<br>  <br>  <br>  I have learned from experience that to repent for doing something in obedience to Gods Word is a no no. Because God won't let me repent to God about something that I did that was being obedient to God.<br>  <br>  Sometimes we doubt that we obeyed God or not. Because of other peoples judgments against us, etc. Like if God led me to see a Minister & I went to go see him. And people told me he was a false prophet, etc... I went any way. And felt the Lord told me some very powerful faith building stuff. I could then go tell my friends this, but they have already condemn this minister of being a false prophet. So? I question my discernment. And try to repent. God won't let me repent. Because I had obeyed the Lord & went even though others told me not to.<br>  <br>  So? We need to trust the assurance in the first place in an act of obedience to God. If we later try to repent, that is actually a lack of faith. Jesus already said we are going over to the other side.<br>  <br>  <br>  So, I don't think there is any other occasion for it being wrong for repenting to God. Repenting to God should be a daily thing. It is getting back to the top. It is following after the Spirit & growing in Christ.<br>  <br>  Of course asking for forgiveness for show for man would be wrong. Or a dishonest heart asking for forgiveness. God listens to the honest heart.<br>  <br>  Also once the Lord has forgiven us, we shouldn't ask Him to forgive us again for the same offense. Because the devil accuses us for what is already forgiven.  So to believe the devil & pray for forgiveness is also a lack of faith that God has already forgiven us. Lack of faith that Jesus shed blood is sufficient payment for every sin.<br>  <br>  And we should go to the Lord first in prayer of repentance. Then if the Lord directs us to repent to someone we offended, go to that person.<br>  <br>  In the case of giving alms in the front of the Church & forgetting that our brother is offended, we need first go to that brother & apologize, then give alms.|`|N6cCc9dOaa	There is never a wrong time to ask the Savior for forgiveness./he is the Savior of the world.It is not like He sleeps or anything like.|`|QS6hSdZNaa	Jesus said " All manner of sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven unto men" .--Matthew 12:31....So we may ask forgiveness for all our transgressions....BUT....He said " the blasphemy against the Holy Ghost shall not be forgiven unto men" --same verse.....then the only remedy would be to believe in John 3:16.....God bless you all.|`|CBbsulYCaa	Personally religion doesn't work for me cos I find it too implausible to believe.

hR7OsqtRaa	2 Timothy 3:16<br>  All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness.<br>  <br>  Galatians 1:11-12<br>  I want you to know, brothers, that the gospel I preached is not something that man made up. I did not receive it from any man, nor was I taught it; rather, I received it by revelation from Jesus Christ.<br>  <br>  2 Timothy 3:16 tells us that the Bible was "breathed out" by God.<br>  <br>  Galatians 1: 11-12 tells us that the gospel was a revelation from Jesus Christ himself, which was recorded by Jesus disciples and Paul.<br>  <br>  God himself chose the disciples and the people whom He knew were going to spread His word and write the Bible.<br>  <br>  The Bible was written by approximately 40 men of diverse backgrounds over the course of 4000 years. Despite being penned by different authors over 40 centuries, the Bible does not contradict itself and does not contain any errors. The authors all present different perspectives, but they all proclaim the same one true God, and the same one way of salvation—Jesus Christ (John 14:6; Acts 4:12).<br>  <br>  In John 8:58 "I tell you the truth," Jesus answered, "before Abraham was born, I am!"<br>  <br>  The above verse speaks a lot about who Jesus really is.<br>  <br>  All about Jesus and the Holy Trinity explained in the below website.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com</a><br>  <br>  Lots of videos, sermons, songs are also present, along with all of Jesus miracles, his parables, and questions on his birth, crucifixion, resurrection are answered.<br>  <br>  Many major questions on Christianity are answered with lot of examples that cannot be denied by anyone, such as,<br>  <br>  1) Did Jesus really exist? Is He God? Why did He suffer on the Cross?<br>  2) What is so special about Jesus? Why cant I just view him as an ordinary man or a teacher or a prophet? Why should I see him as God?<br>  <br>  Pasting a small part from the website.<br>  Visit the website to strengthen your faith in Jesus or to know more about Him.<br>  <br>  Jesus is God.<br>  <br>  1.Thomas calls Jesus God in John 20:28 (Note, Thomas addresses Jesus<br>  specifically.)<br>  2. Jesus is God in Heb. 1:8<br>  3. John the apostle states that Jesus was the Word which was God that became<br>  flesh (John 1:1-14)<br>  4. The phrase "Call upon the name of the LORD" (Hebrew, YHWH, i.e., Psalm<br>  116:4) used only of God on the OT, and translated into the Greek in the LXX as "Call upon the name of the LORD (greek, KURIOS)," applied to Jesus in the NT (1 Cor. 1:2) Jesus is God in flesh<br>  5. The apostle John says that Jesus was , "...calling God His own Father,<br>  making Himself equal to God," (John 5:18)<br>  6. Jesus said that He and the Father are One (John 10:30), that caused the Pharisees to<br>  claim that Jesus was making Himself out to be God.<br>  7. Jesus knew all things (John 21:17)<br>  8. Jesus knew all men (John 16:30)<br>  9. Jesus is everywhere (Matt. 28:20)<br>  10. Jesus Christ, dwells in you (Col. 1:27)<br>  11. Jesus is the exact representation of the Nature of God (Heb. 1:3)<br>  12. Jesus is eternal (Micah 5:1-2)<br>  13. Jesus gives eternal life (John 10:27-28)<br>  14. Jesus is our only Lord and Master (Jude 4)<br>  15. Jesus is called the Mighty God (Isaiah 9:6)<br>  16. Jesus is called the Mighty God (Isaiah 9:6) and "God" also be called the Mighty God in Isaiah 10:21<br>  17. Jesus is able to raise Himself from the dead (John 2:19-21)<br>  18. Jesus created all things (Col. 1:16-17), it is God who created all things by Himself (Isaiah 44:24)<br>  19. Jesus searches the hearts and minds of the people (Rev. 2:23)<br>  20. Jesus is worshiped (Matt. 2:2-11; Matt.14:33; Matt.28:9; John 9:35-38;<br>  Heb. 1:6) Only God can be worshipped (Matt. 4:10) (same Greek word for worship<br>  is used in each place.)<br>  21. In the OT God was seen (Exodus 6:2-3;Exodus 24:9-11; Num. 12:6-9; Acts7:2), yet no man can see God (Exodus 33:20; John 1:18). It was not the Father that was seen in the OT (John 6:46). Who, then were they seeing? See John 8:58.<br>  22. Jesus claimed the divine name, "I AM", for Himself in John 8:58 see<br>  Exodus 3:14.<br>  23. Jesus says you must honor him even as you honor the Father (John 5:23).<br>  24. Jesus gives life (John 5:21).<br>  25. Jesus bears witness of Himself (John 8:18;John 14:6).<br>  26. Jesus is the One who will judge you on judgement day (John 5:22-23). Only God can be the judge.<br>  27. Jesus forgives sins (Luke 5:20) (Luke 24:47,Acts 10:43) .Only God can forgive sins.<br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com</a>|`|qxu6sK3yaa	Luke 4:20<br>  :20And he closed the book, and he gave it again to the minister, and sat down.

Technically Middle Easterner/Arab-Americans and African-Americans would qualify as white as well. The Northern Africans like Moroccans and Egyptians would classify as African-American though they are caucasian in race. So white covers more than just European which is a common mistake.<br>  <br>  Lazy, no white person today stole any land and it's already been overly promoted that white people took the land from the Native Americans. The African Americans took the land from the Liberians but they're never faulted for that.|`|M2UWOTAjaa	Yes, but the whole point of the American way is to assimilate all people into a new people, that being Americans, who share the same values, the same interests, the same love of liberty, etc. Of course racism derailed the "way" but that is the ideal. In fact it is the way of nationalism in general. People in the Czech republic don't care if a person's grandmother was French; they're all Czechs now becuase that is where they live.
Bq0gqw7qaa	Part of the problem may be the wording of your question starting with who you address it to. A quick dictionary reference will bring you to realize that not only are there eastern Orthodox, greek orthodox,orthodox jews,there are even catholic orthodox (Byzantine rite). Many roman catholics like me, consider themselves to be adherents of Christian orthodoxy. As I understand it there are very few theological differences between any of these rites (the exception being orthodox jews of course). Even the first great schism of the church surrounding the filoquia clause is not enough to separate both the eastern and western rites from orthodoxy. It is not until the reformation and the rejection of the councils and creeds of the early church that faith becomes "unorthodox."<br>        You can read my bio to find out where I'm from;  Peace<br>  <br>  EDIT; Just to be clear, as a Catholic I am certainly entitled to answer your question. I am infact your "Orthodox Christian Brother" It was YOU, as I submitted that was unclear in your question's parameters.

Not everyone thinks life begins once the sperm enters the egg.|`|4Te5gVvDaa	It is up to the woman. Why should she be coerced into undergoing a life threatening reproductive cycle when she doesn't have to. Abortion is only considered when the child isn't considered alive. How far are Pro-Abortionist are going to take this. They might as well consider masturbation genocide and damn us all to hell.|`|cIvFOzoiaa	I'm pro-choice all the way.  I agree with you, as a guy, I can't imagine what would be going through a woman's head if she's pregnant.<br>  I think that people who don't want abortions shouldn't get them, guys should keep their mouths shut about it if they don't like them, and this country should remain free.|`|cKuppxUQaa	Pro choice is saying its ok to murder babies and that is not right.|`|8j70Neqeaa	good for you|`|35ff9d3ad1eb64812f64b2031173d7e4aa	You can still manage to apologize without actually apologizing. Try this:<br>  <br>  "Hey, I'm sorry about that argument that we had a few months ago. We were both wrong, and I hate how something like that ruined our friendship. Want to meet up at Starbucks* later?"<br>  <br>  The key of it is using "we". An argument involves two people, and you need to meet on even grounds. Avoid the topic of abortion in the future conversations.<br>  <br>  Only apologize if it's really a friendship that you want to start up again. If you have no interest in being her friend, then don't bother. I understand that you're upset, but if you still want to salvage a friendship, then pick up the phone and call her!|`|6w1e6zUVaa	Of course people who agree with you will say, "right on" and others who don't will say, "go to hell" so I won't do either.  What I will do is say that you two probably weren't very good friends if a minor disagreement like religion or politics (the abortion topic is a political one).  But if you think that you really were friends then it has more to do with both of you not wanting to "sack up" and be the bigger person and apologize.  So if you were friends then just call her and get it over with.|`|knhgtiYvaa	It is very difficult for pro-choice to match the arguments of the alternative.<br>  <br>  Imagine your parents telling you "I wanted to have you aborted but the government wouldn't let me. So I had to have you".<br>  <br>  Your friend is retarded for throwing a friendship away over a differing opinion. Little lost.|`|I7V1GwS1aa	Well I can't choose.<br>  <br>  I'm a product of an affair gone wrong, my biological father was married and didn't want me, but my mom kept me.<br>  Then a few months ago I heard my mom say she got an abortion after my little sister(who she had at 40)  when she was 45 years old with my stepdad.<br>  <br>  Another situation came out with my older sister. She has the life kind of out of a picture book. She married her Highschool sweet heart from when she was 16, own their own place, and had one abortion about a year ago, because they weren't ready. I didn't find out to this past xmas, and she's prego again but we persuaded her to keep it. She wasn't sure this time because of all the economic problems we're having that she could support a baby yet. But she's keeping it and so happy for the first baby in the family since 1994.<br>  <br>  I always feel abortions are horrible, but think it's even worse to start taking women's rights away after we've fought for so long.|`|akvrwpywaa	"because i am NOT in the other women's situation"<br>  That would be like if I said that I was against rape because I wasn't in the other men's situation, or if I was against bank-robbery because I wasn't in the robbers' situation.<br>  <br>  '"regardless, it is NOT against the law"'<br>  Think about this:  For a whole century after slavery was abolished, it was not against the law to discriminate against blacks, either.  For seven-eights of a century, states were allowed to refuse people of a different race the right to vote.  For almost a century and a half, states didn't have to allow women to vote.<br>  <br>  And if a woman has an "unexpected pregnancy" (which is truly an oxymoron) and doesn't want to give the baby for adoption, then she has already made two choices: one to have sex in the first place, and another to not give the baby up for adoption.<br>  <br>  As far as the whole thing about your friend: Let people be people.  I'm assuming you're a girl.  I hate to sound sexist, but I know how girls think and hold grudges.  Maybe she just had a... moment.  Perhaps she's calmed down now about the matter.  If you'd like you could call her and just not bring up the topic, but that's your choice.

KJ3zAtJJaa	Sure they do. Something you have got to realise though, everyone's idea of sexy is different. I know a gal that is good looking and most other people think she is incrediablly sexy and that helped her get the job she had and other advantages but I think she got lucky because the way society treats us.

The owner could legally whip a slave to death.  The owner could force himself upon a female slave.  I trust that you haven't read these verses because if you have and still wrote this question then your character as a person is deeply flawed.|`|UOBvuImUaa	I agree , slavery is still in practice today , it is just different .<br>  Have now , pay later , we are still selling ourselves.<br>  Freedom is just another word for nothing left to loose .|`|S4XUl7qWaa	Your sources for this supposedly fabulous fun OT slavery, please.<br>  <br>  I hear christians make this claim all the time, but it seems to me you have not read your own bible if you think that slavery 2000 years ago was just a bowl of cherries.<br>  <br>      When a man strikes his male or female slave with a rod so hard that the slave dies under his hand, he shall be punished.  If, however, the slave survives for a day or two, he is not to be punished, since the slave is his own property.  (Exodus 21:20-21 NAB)<br>  <br>  However, you may purchase male or female slaves from among the foreigners who live among you.  You may also purchase the children of such resident foreigners, including those who have been born in your land.  You may treat them as your property, passing them on to your children as a permanent inheritance.  You may treat your slaves like this, but the people of Israel, your relatives, must never be treated this way.  (Leviticus 25:44-46 NLT)<br>  <br>  Don't even get me started on how many times the bibles says it's just peachy to take young virgin women from neighboring villages, kill their entire families, rape them either force them to marry their rapist or keep them as sex slaves. Does that sound okay to you?|`|aOzkfsPNaa	You are very right. In the Old Testament, slavery was used as a way of neighbors and citizens to pay debts to one another. But it wasn't such a cut and dried thing. The debtor could be held even after his debt was paid if the person owed didn't think they got a comparable amount of work out of them. As well, the debt, if large enough, could also be passed down through generations. <br>  Though there was one interesting detail about the way it was done. If a man owed someone else an enormous amount and even with entering into slavery his family "lost everything", things were set on a 50 year cycle so that families would have their holdings, land, etc returned to them or they could rightfully reclaim them every 50 years. That only applied towards things that were taken, not things honestly bought and sold.|`|qEYYHNyyaa	I agree freedom is an illusion.<br>  <br>  Free range farms are cheaper and easier to manage.|`|FBrwlhPtaa	Here's a great website for all questions about OT slavery:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.rationalchristianity.net/slavery_ot.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.rationalchristianity.net/slav...</a>
d0945a07b59dce3ca7393bc610216aa9aa	I love your "Additional Details," by the way. <br>  <br>  I am not a Christian, but here's my view on reincarnationism in Christianity: <br>  <br>  Reincarnation represents the Rosetta stone of Jesus' ministry which clarifies his teachings and reveals the mystery of life itself. The early Christian church modified his teachings to better fit the Roman and Greek religions, which we now call "mythology." Reincarnation was and is an integral part of ancient Jewish mysticism, however, over which Christianity had no control. <br>  <br>  The early church edited, rewrote and redefined Christianity to place itself as the mediator between "God" and mankind. Only a few fragments of truth remain but they are clearly there: e.g., WHO sinned, THIS MAN or his parents, that HE BE BORN BLIND?... TRULY, LITERALLY, YOU MUST BE BORN AGAIN. <br>  <br>  History provides proof, too. As the Dead Sea scrolls reveal, John the Baptist was a member of the Essene sect of Judaism; Essenes were one of many Jewish sects that taught reincarnation. Jewish mysticism has always taught that reincarnation is true, since before the time of Jesus, and there is no doubt that Jesus was a Jewish mystic. Baptism originated as symbolic of reincarnation, of being dead and rising up in physical rebirth (water) to live again. To be baptized signified a metaphorical reincarnation and its promise of a new *physical* (not just spiritual) life. <br>  <br>  When John's cousin Jesus was baptized, to Jews of his acquaintance it was symbolic of Jesus' soul having returned in a new state of being. <br>  <br>  There is nothing in the bible that "disproves" reincarnation. The oft-quoted "It is appointed that men die once and face judgment" has no connection to rebirth. As the "man" is dead, the people who use this quote - what exactly do they think hangs around to face judgment? Could it be that non-corporeal part of that person, usually referred to as the soul? Of course. And the *soul* is what reincarnates - not "the man."<br>  <br>  It is the soul that survives death, the soul that "faces judgment" and the soul that is reborn in a new body. <br>  <br>  Although re-writers of the NT essentially presented Jesus as a zombie rather than a soul reborn in a brand new body, the soul does not return to the old physical body to reanimate the corpse. "Resurrection" is how the men who didn't understand his mysteries interpreted Jesus' teachings on reincarnation. He stressed separation of body and soul, but the resurrection believers couldn't comprehend that distinction.<br>  <br>  "Judgment" faced at death is contemplation of your previous life, your failures and successes. This contemplation (self judgment) is a fundamental Jewish concept. "Hell" is a Christian invention. Jews believe that there is a period of contemplation after death. This is "the judgment." Christians often ignore the fact that Jesus was Jewish, in particular an Essene Jew. Even the Pope, however, recently admitted that Jesus followed the Essene calendar, according to when he celebrated "the last supper's" Passover. <br>  <br>  Essenes naturally followed the Essene calendar, and Essenes believed in reincarnation, baptism, which are things Jesus actually would have taught.<br>  <br>  Other bible verses contradict the single, solitary "man dies but once" verse. Paul wrote, "I die daily." There's a reference in the NT to "the second death." Clearly other bible verses disagree with the "once" remark. However, it's the "faces judgment" portion that brings the verse into focus as a reference to the continuing soul (which is what reincarnates into a new body).<br>  <br>  This Isaiah verse that Christians slap on every question about reincarnation at YA may refer to zombies, but not to the return of the eternal soul in a new body -- which is what Jesus believed in and attempted to teach. Apparently he failed. Fortunately, reincarnation requires no belief. You return whether you believe in reincarnation or not. Awareness of one's eternal journey is not necessary in order to continue learning and perfecting the spirit. <br>  <br>  "Be ye therefore perfect even as your father in heaven is perfect," Jesus instructed his followers. He didn't say 'hey, do your best,' or 'if you just believe I existed that's enough...' He said BE AS PERFECT AS GOD IS. Jesus indicated, according to the bible, that absolute perfection is within the reach of every human when he made the statement, YE ARE GODS. <br>  <br>  Anyone with a functioning mind should be able to comprehend that perfection and godliness cannot be attained in a single lifetime and that unbiased examination of historical fact is evidence that Jesus was a reincarnationist.|`|Ne9rXERpaa	Not really -- it doesn't have any credible evidence supporting it, either.<br>  <br>  The "energy" you're talking about is contained in molecular bonds -- you ARE your body, not some insubstantial bolus of "life energy" riding around in a meat suit...|`|MQBKnbSFaa	The law of conservation of mass and energy doesn't apply because the law only applies to the physical world. Something spiritual like a soul or spirit being reincarnated is irrelevant.|`|35388c245298f734c446f07410c4ec69aa	No, not at all.|`|ZB9Eh9V1aa	no not at all. Rebirth as related to Salvation is a complete change of a persons spiritual base as related to God and His will. Reincarnation is can relate to physical change as in becoming something entirely different than who/what you are.|`|j4n95V8gaa	rebirth/reincarnation?<br>  <br>  So u mean that after u die, ur soul gets judged according to what you've done & there would probably be a scale that measures you good works & bad works & then leads you to a life of animal or bird or worse than that??<br>  seriously? do u want anyone to believe in that?<br>  <br>  sorry<br>  <br>  u'r wasting ur time & mine<br>  <br>  I say that because there are overwhelming evidences to support Christianity,<br>  but no single serious evidence for believing in uncountable gods & goddesses who act crazy & all are married [GOD MARRIES?] & who have thousands of legs & hands like beast...<br>  <br>  and those beast-looking gods made up this kind of crazy idea...<br>  <br>  thousands of gods = thousands of wives = thousands of legs & hands = thousands of births..<br>  <br>  Sorry it doesn't make sense<br>  <br>  Christianity makes more sense|`|g4AAZRuxaa	No.|`|VmqOq8Qjaa	Yes

Don't fall in to this trap climb out. Push yourself in to going out or talking to your friends but stay positive because depression can be a hard battle if you go to deep. If you need counseling don't be afraid to get. Some depression can come from hormones or chemicals in the brain called seratonin. Exercise all ways helped me it gives me energy  and allows me to think clearly. The mind can play tricks on you if there is no crisis or significant reason then every day is what you make it. There is a thin line between sanity and insanity stay on the sane side.|`|rELSr3Oaaa	If I were you I'd make an appt with a therapist.

r8rykCkGaa	Honey, you are much too new as a Christian to get involved in any arguments with those who hate Christ.  It won't do you any good at all!!!<br>  <br>  If you have to tell a Jew anything, tell them to read Isaiah 53, and Micah 5:2.  This proves Jesus is the Messiah beyond a shadow of a doubt but if they refuse to compare it with the New Testament or believe the NT, then you still have a problem with them.<br>  <br>  After this stay away from false religions of any kind.  The devil will use them to try to tear down your faith.  you need to really study for some years before you can try to teach a Jew.  They can get very mean too and I know many are bitter.|`|PYD9JyIzaa	they do not believe the new testament - but yes - there is something in the old testament that shows who jesus is - isaiah 53 - peace be with u|`|AyPF2TFlaa	Since Christ never lead any one away from the living God this has no comparison to Christ.<br>  This is a warning about false teaching and false god's.<br>  This was for many prophets not one!<br>  But it is written that the anti christ is anyone who denies Jesus come in the flesh, he has rejected God therefore leave him to God.<br>  I agree with some of the others learn about Christ and Love him wholly<br>  before arguing, you'll find with time your opinions and outlooks will change as you try to find the truth.<br>  Get yourself rooted!|`|P5rczL0Saa	Jesus fufilled all the Messianic Prophecies. Please read Isaiah, also read Psalm 22. <br>  If you are a new Christian, you should be very careful about getting into "debates" with someone who wants to disprove you. They will eat you up and spit you out! One of the very things we need to do is "Be ready!"  to give answers for our faith, as Paul put it. So, my suggestion to you is to read and STUDY the Bible each and everyday. Get into a really good study group at church. You'll be surprised how much you learn.If you go into the lion's den, you need to be prepared to fight the lions!  You need your FULL ARMOR of GOD!!!  I know how much you want to give the right answers, and it is equally important not to give the wrong answers.  Keep studying, and try not to get into any debates right now.  God Bless you on your journey with Him!!|`|4293cf50016bde6c1a79ccb90dbe6c96aa	I would love to answer this fully, but I have to go now.  The quick answer is to read through Isaiah and pull out all of the prophecies about Christ.  There are lots of them.  You can even google Messianic prophecies in Isaiah and I'm sure it will pop it.  There are other Messianic prophecies in different Old Testament books as well.  How can Deuteronomy be speaking of Christ when Isaiah and other books in the OT so blatantly prove it?|`|xkSwcCW1aa	Jesus Christ came into this world about 2000 years ago.

Even if you have the best argument in the entire WORLD for your belief, you probably are not going to sway someone else out of their beliefs.  Don't try to get into religious debates at this point in your spirituality.  It will only confuse and frustrate you.  If you're going to argue the point, you need to know exactly what you believe and why you believe it and be able to back up what you say.  Otherwise, you'll probably get shot down pretty quickly.  <br>  In other news, I cannot believe you are attempting to read the entire bible.  Wow.  I know christians who have been part of that religion for decades who haven't even attempted that.  I'm not christian, but I have to say kudos!|`|W7l1awFPaa	He is probably referring to Matthew 16:28 where Jesus says "I tell you the truth, some who are standing here will not taste death before they see the Son of Man coming in his kingdom"<br>  <br>  Skeptics take this to mean the second coming, however, if you read on into chapter 17 it then gives an account of the transfiguration of Christ about a week later.<br>  <br>  If it were actually referring to the second coming then Jesus would be a false prophet because that prophecy of his would not have come true.  Clearly though, this cannot be the case because Jesus himself states in Matthew chapter 24 verse 36 "No one knows that day or hour, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father"|`|AA10264246	Jews do not believe that Jesus was the  promised messiah. In the same way, Christians firmly believe that Jesus was indeed the Son of God. Heres' a tip: If at first you don't succeed in convincing a Jew to be a Christian, don't  try again. Otherwise he will try much harder to make you embrace the Jewish faith. I'm sure God, by whatever name you call Him, will look kindly to both of you.|`|6fnN5XMwaa	Don't look at it like you are.. Consider it this way.... You are new to Christ which means that you are not fully developed in him. We all go through spiritual training and exercises before God really puts us to work. Consider that battle to be lost but use it as a tool to prepare you for the next time it happens. Remember that the devil knows the bible better than all of us. He can use scripture after scripture to get you to stop believing what you do because of his knowledge of the bible and God....... I am not calling your Jewish associate the devil. I am saying don't let this stay under your skin as it has already gotten under there. Use it as a learning tool. Go back, pray over Deuteronomy 13 and ask God to clarify that chapter with you. Start reading the old testament as it should have been read first. You must know how God used to be in order to really appreciate what Jesus has established....|`|hR7OsqtRaa	2 Timothy 3:16<br>  All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness.<br>  <br>  Galatians 1:11-12<br>  I want you to know, brothers, that the gospel I preached is not something that man made up.

The phrase "Call upon the name of the LORD" (Hebrew, YHWH, i.e., Psalm<br>  116:4) used only of God on the OT, and translated into the Greek in the LXX as "Call upon the name of the LORD (greek, KURIOS)," applied to Jesus in the NT (1 Cor. 1:2) Jesus is God in flesh<br>  5. The apostle John says that Jesus was , "...calling God His own Father,<br>  making Himself equal to God," (John 5:18)<br>  6. Jesus said that He and the Father are One (John 10:30), that caused the Pharisees to<br>  claim that Jesus was making Himself out to be God.<br>  7. Jesus knew all things (John 21:17)<br>  8.

In the OT God was seen (Exodus 6:2-3;Exodus 24:9-11; Num. 12:6-9; Acts7:2), yet no man can see God (Exodus 33:20; John 1:18). It was not the Father that was seen in the OT (John 6:46).

We will never understand all of it, there are too many layers of meaning to everything in it. This is my advice for you at this point. Don't worry about arguing with people or trying to convince them of anything, especially Jewish people about Jesus. They get that pushed at them constantly and they get so tired of it. Jesus specifically said not to keep on and on with people who didn't want to discuss faith matters. <br>  <br>  As a new Christian it is so exciting to have this connection with Jesus and to be learning all this, and it is natural to want to talk about it! I am not faulting you for that *at all.* But there are ways to go about it and as Ecclesiastes said, there is a time for everything. <br>  <br>  As for your question concerning the scripture passage in question, get a good Bible commentary to read along with your Bible study that will explain things. Pick one you really trust. And focus on growing to be like Christ rather than debating people about what Scripture says about him and you will go so much further in your Christian walk and it will mean so much more!

Is He God? Why did He suffer on the Cross?<br>  2) What is so special about Jesus? Why cant I just view him as an ordinary man or a teacher or a prophet? Why should I see him as God?<br>  <br>  Pasting a small part from the website.<br>  Visit the website to strengthen your faith in Jesus or to know more about Him.<br>  <br>  Jesus is God.<br>  <br>  1.Thomas calls Jesus God in John 20:28 (Note, Thomas addresses Jesus<br>  specifically.)<br>  2. Jesus is God in Heb. 1:8<br>  3. John the apostle states that Jesus was the Word which was God that became<br>  flesh (John 1:1-14)<br>  4. The phrase "Call upon the name of the LORD" (Hebrew, YHWH, i.e., Psalm<br>  116:4) used only of God on the OT, and translated into the Greek in the LXX as "Call upon the name of the LORD (greek, KURIOS)," applied to Jesus in the NT (1 Cor. 1:2) Jesus is God in flesh<br>  5. The apostle John says that Jesus was , "...calling God His own Father,<br>  making Himself equal to God," (John 5:18)<br>  6. Jesus said that He and the Father are One (John 10:30), that caused the Pharisees to<br>  claim that Jesus was making Himself out to be God.<br>  7. Jesus knew all things (John 21:17)<br>  8.

Jesus is worshiped (Matt. 2:2-11; Matt.14:33; Matt.28:9; John 9:35-38;<br>  Heb. 1:6) Only God can be worshipped (Matt. 4:10) (same Greek word for worship<br>  is used in each place.)<br>  21. In the OT God was seen (Exodus 6:2-3;Exodus 24:9-11; Num. 12:6-9; Acts7:2), yet no man can see God (Exodus 33:20; John 1:18). It was not the Father that was seen in the OT (John 6:46).

No more do I look to these organized religions to help "teach" me how to properly conduct myself. I look to God's word the Bible and always pray for understanding and comprehending it's many life lessons and it is a life manual.<br>  <br>  IT is true that people are the ones committing the evils and interpreting things wrong.. that is because their hearts are not in the right place and Satan is having his way with these ones, but as far as organized religions.. beware and do your homework, like how they got started, who said what and did what to get these organizations started.

For instance, instead of being exposed, they were moved onto other parishes with a "hush hush" attitude & in this way other children were put into danger. This was done by the 'high-ups' within the religion. Putting children at risk is a terrible thing that they did.<br>  So, the question we need to ask is... were these people representing God by doing these acts (paedophilia)? <br>  And those who tried to cover up these things... were they too representing God? - They both claim they were<br>  <br>  Evidently, they weren't.<br>  They will answer to God for their actions|`|ed7d52fe8334c4d034acc2f4c34f0b44aa	Pedophiles are everywhere and they will always be everywhere: doctors and lawyers, teachers and rabbis and priests.

I frighten the crap out of them, because they think having a penis makes them a man, but I'm a man without one, so it obviously doesn't LOL. This freaks them out, I make them realize that there is more to being a man, an it's something they lack: integrity, responsibility etc. It's the same with supremacists.

aGRJ6MPdaa	While it is true that some KHs are closing down, many are also springing up...<br>  <br>  ...but there is a catch, of course!<br>  <br>  Since one JW who answered made reference to the JW Yearbooks, I will also point to those same yearbooks. In any of their yearbooks from the last few years, you will notice that the least amount of growth is in countries where people have a higher education level. The greatest amount of growth for JWs is in countries with a lower education level. Anyone see a connection here? I'll give you a hint:<br>  <br>  Educated thinkers = not falling for the JW web of deceit!<br>  <br>  Also, from personal observation and through verification from other JWs, a large part of the growth in the USA is from illegal immigrants. My local KH, for example, has had a "stalemate" in growth/loss ratio in the English- speaking congregation for decades now. In the late 1990's, a Spanish- speaking congregation was formed. Within one decade, there were two Spanish- speaking congregations! Yet, despite having two whole congregations of Spanish- speaking JWs, there was a tremendous shortage of "qualified" brothers to appoint as elders and ministerial servants! Why weren't they "qualified"? Because they were illegal immigrants! The organization can't risk putting the names of known illegals on any of their paperwork! That would make them look bad, and we can't have that, now, can we!? <br>  <br>  The majority of the growth that the JW organization is experiencing is from under- educated and underdeveloped countries and peoples. They are either untrained or do not have access to information that we in developed countries have.<br>  <br>  Edit- Desert Rose, thank you for proving my point. While the United States has a 99% literacy rate, the Dominican Republic has only an 87% literacy rate. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_literacy_rate" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cou...</a><br>  <br>  The USA experienced well under 1% growth rate for JWs while the Dominican Republic experienced around 5% growth rate. <a href="http://watchtower.org/e/statistics/worldwide_report.htm" rel="nofollow">http://watchtower.org/e/statistics/world...</a><br>  <br>  The defense rests!|`|3aVxJYf6aa	In my country 112 new KH in the last 4 Years......and we are only one of the more than 60 countries the program of construction is taking place.<br>  <br>  Dominican Republic...with several pictures available.|`|oVHFz52Laa	That would be good news. I need to ask about that from the ladies that come to my home|`|mrMkKFqNaa	It is likely due to a demographic shift.  For example, in the United States, people are moving away from Northeastern states to the Southern and Western states.  Thus, I would expect there to be less growth among JWs in the Northeast and "rust belt" and more growth in the West and South...merely because it tracks population trends.<br>  <br>  And, yes, it is not surprising that JW growth is primarily among disadvantaged and immigrant communities.  This is borne out by a study from the Pew Forum in 2008 which found the following about JWs:<br>  - They are the least educated of all religions that they surveyed (70% have a high school education or less).<br>  - They are the second-poorest (2nd only to traditionally African-American dominations).<br>  - As compared to the U.S. population, African-Americans and Latinos are over-represented and Whites are under-represented in the JW religion.|`|YJVmL9Ubaa	I live in Texas and 2 kingdom halls have quit going door to door(i left at at the age of 14)but they talked about a time when they would shut the doors to everyone when they felt like God was coming back soon,do u know of any kimgdom halls that have quit going door to door and have shut the doors to the k-hall?|`|crJ0fHZhaa	where did u get that?

When they were instructed to go in their own area, it was so many people that had to move that, that one particular congregation was no more, but the Witnesses are still active in their new respective congregations.

He was seen by over 500 people AFTER His resurrection. <br>  <br>  When we die, if we are "In Christ," our bodies go to the ground. Our souls go to Heaven. (absent from the body, present with the Lord). Our earthly bodies (corruptable) will be changed to glorified bodies (incorruptable) at the Rapture of the Church. Then we will live with the Lord forever with our glorified bodies. Our bodies will be like His. The one who are still alive when He returns, will NEVER taste death. Their bodies will simply be changed at the Rapture, and will go to be with the Lord. <br>  <br>  If one dies who is not "in Christ." Or, an unbeliever, their body will go into the ground, and their soul will go to hades to await the Judgment. Then, after the millenial reign of Christ for 1000 years on earth, they will be brought up out of the grave to be judged by Jesus Himself. They will be found "guilty" and then thrown into the Lake of Fire, (which is called the "second death") with satan and the Antichrist and the false prophet. <br>  I'm not joking. This is what will really take place, according to God's Holy Word.   I hope to see you at the Rapture! God Bless|`|FOzN3xwzaa	The truth is that death brings IMMEDIATE heaven or hell, depending ONLY on whether you believe in Jesus alone for salvation or not. <br>  <br>  So to be in heaven and not hell, believe in Jesus alone for salvation now! :) <br>  <br>  Salvation is a FREE GIFT that happens in a split second when you believe in Jesus! It is impossible to lose or "leave" salvation. <br>  <br>  The truth about Jesus is that the only way to be saved and to get into heaven and avoid being sent to eternal hell, is by believing in faith alone that Jesus, who is God, died for our sins on the cross as FULL PAYMENT for all our sins, and then Jesus rose from the dead (1 Corinthians 15:1-4). Believe this and you will be in heaven, no matter what! <br>  <br>  Please pray now: "Jesus, please forgive me of my sins. I believe that You died on the cross for my sins and You rose from the dead. Thank You for eternal life!" You will be in heaven with Him forever when you die. :)|`|smdYwFfRaa	where were you before you were born?<br>  no where.<br>  You didn't exist.

It's all a matter of "faith" which by definition is non-logical.However, there is a principle in philsophy that says it is impossible to prove all true statements. Perhaps the existence of afterlife is one of those unprovable true statements.|`|3jBUTewUaa	Well, depending on your religion, theres different theories. Theres some who believe in re-incarnation, some who believe in purgatory, and some who believer in "after life"    Re Incarnation is the belief of coming back as a different person or a different species. Purgatory is a Catholic belief that when you die, you remain in purgatory, the more people who pray for you, the faster you MIGHT get to Heaven. I also believer purgatory is where God judges you. When you are "accepted" your soul ascends into Heaven. The after-life is simple, I believe that means you can come back as a spirit.   I dont know if this is what your looking for. Hope I helped. Let me know if that was OK for you.|`|OeVGYXhxaa	Does something inside us, like a soul or a spirit, survive the death of the body? Consider how the first man, Adam, came to have life. The Bible states: “Jehovah God proceeded to form the man out of dust from the ground and to blow into his nostrils the breath of life.” (Genesis 2:7) Though breathing sustained his life, putting “the breath of life” into his nostrils involved much more than simply blowing air into his lungs. It meant that God put into Adam’s lifeless body the spark of life—“the force of life,” which is active in all earthly creatures. (Genesis 6:17; 7:22) The Bible refers to this animating force as “spirit.” (James 2:26) That spirit can be compared to the electric current that activates a machine or an appliance and enables it to perform its function. Just as the current never takes on the features of the equipment it activates, the life-force does not take on any of the characteristics of the creatures it animates. It has no personality and no thinking ability.<br>  What happens to the spirit when a person dies? Psalm 146:4 says: “His spirit goes out, he goes back to his ground; in that day his thoughts do perish.” When a person dies, his impersonal spirit does not go on existing in another realm as a spirit creature. It “returns to the true God who gave it.” (Ecclesiastes 12:7) This means that any hope of future life for that person now rests entirely with God.<br>  The ancient Greek philosophers Socrates and Plato held that a soul inside a person survives death and never dies. What does the Bible teach about the soul? Adam “came to be a living soul,” says Genesis 2:7. He did not receive a soul; he was a soul—a whole person. The Scriptures speak of a soul’s doing work, craving food, being kidnapped, experiencing sleeplessness, and so forth. (Leviticus 23:30; Deuteronomy 12:20; 24:7; Psalm 119:28) Yes, man himself is a soul. When a person dies, that soul dies.—Ezekiel 18:4.<br>  What, then, is the condition of the dead? When pronouncing sentence upon Adam, Jehovah stated: “Dust you are and to dust you will return.” (Genesis 3:19) Where was Adam before God formed him from the dust of the ground and gave him life? Why, he simply did not exist! When he died, Adam returned to that state of complete absence of life. The condition of the dead is made clear at Ecclesiastes 9:5, 10, where we read: “The dead know nothing .?.?. In the grave, where you are going, there is neither working nor planning nor knowledge nor wisdom.” (New International Version) Scripturally, death is a state of nonexistence. The dead have no awareness, no feelings, no thoughts.|`|1d0cc0ea5546dfbb6d1b826ce4a34599aa	If I say those people who have accepted God through Jesus Christ and have been faithful to their faith up to the end will go to heaven and those who just laugh with the Good News and continue with their usual selfish lives go to hell you won't believe. Why? It's because we have already closed our minds to the truth and we'll only accept teachings which satisfy our curiosity and will not condemn us even if we do bad and live irresponsible lives. <br>  But for me, I believe in the basic teachings Of genuine Christianity that still believes in heaven and hell as literal places because after all the hardships and sacrifices the believers have undergone in their earthly lifetime they will understand that it will not go to waste for God will reward them according to their works. But for the people who mock at them when they're still alive would you think God will be fair and just if these evil people will also share with them in their happiness altogether in heaven? That's why I believe also in hell. Now, if you think that God, in His mercy, will still give these people a chance to live or reincarnate, whatever you think, then these people will reincarnate in a lower form of life as Hinduism teaches as their karma because of their evil past lifetime. They will reincarnate as dog, cats, etc. based on their teachings. I'm not kidding. Now will you accept this kind of life? Will these people accept their fate because of their evil past lifetimes? Then it will appear that God is like a Punisher that will punish us because of our wrong doing in the past lifetimes. A never-ending cycle of lifetimes till people attain godhood according to Hinduism. Look at the people now in India (where Hinduism originated), the poor people. Do the Hindus help them? No, because the Hindus always say, "that is their karma, That is their karma." But the famous Mother Teresa showed them what it meant to be a Christian. How about the martyrs like Paul, Peter, Stephen and countless Christians who died for their faith for centuries if there is no heaven? Why would they risk their lives if there is no resurrection of the dead? And the people now in China -the true Christians, who are willing to die for their faith because of Jesus. Please open your mind and heart and study the lives of Chinese Christians. Their testimony has been written now and available in the bookstores, one is "THe heavenly Man" the story of Yun, a Christian who suffered severely at the hands of the Communists in China. This will open your mind of what true Christianity is all about - True Christianity was founded by blood, death, and testimony by Jesus and those who follow Him to the way of the cross.|`|UYnAASPJaa	this question should read where will I go after death. this is a personal question for each of us and depends on how we live our life. if you believe in Jesus and do your best to live for him repent when you fail. then your going to heaven again that is between you and God i cant judge you and tell you where your going i don't know whats in your heart. But if you don't believe in Jesus that he came to earth lived, died , AND rose again then i can without a doubt tell you where you will be going Hell!!  this life is short and really meaningless living for christ and making it to heaven is all that matters here.|`|vb5oY7O6aa	according to islam...we die our bodies disintegrate and our souls go into a phase thats called the middle phase... on the day of judgement a horn will sound and every living person will die..... it will sound a second time and all of the mankind from when it all started will get up like new..... everyone will know its the judgement day..... faces will go dark with fear noone will care for noone they ll be running like crazy looking at the sky.... every one worrying about his/her actions and result.....people will see God and the angels ... and non believers will beg God that if they were given a second chance they ll be the best slaves of God...

And I will be quoting from scripture.  <br>  <br>  The "soul" is just someone who is alive.  Human or animal. That can be found a few times in Gen. <br>  <br>  The  spirit is the breath of life.  <br>  <br>  Our souls are NOT immortal.  God is the only one that is immortal.  <br>  <br>  The bible clearly states that when you die that is the end of all life.  You dont think or remember anything.   There is no afterlife, which some people think,  God takes the breath of life out of you.  It doesnt say that "you" go anywhere.  At all. Ever.....<br>  <br>  If immortal souls have bodies -- fingers, toes, eyes, etc.    then what use is there for a resurrected body? If the soul has a physical appearance, with human appendages, then the body rotting in the grave is of no further use, and reuniting the immortal soul with its resurrected body at a future date would be useless<br>  <br>  Something to think about......   Our mortal body "must put on immortality" at the return of Christ (1 Cor. 15:53); thus immortality is something promised, not now possessed (1 John 2:25).<br>  <br>  That verse is saying that "our" mortal bodies.....   it's not saying our immortal bodies.   If we DO go to heaven after death,  it would say our immortal bodies or souls.  But it doesnt...<br>  <br>  One of the last messages of hope the Lord Jesus left was, "Behold I come quickly and my reward (eternal life) is with me to give every man according as his works shall be." (Revelation 22v12). If a person is in heaven enjoying the reward of immortality, what is the use of the second coming of the Lord Jesus and the resurrection of the body? The simple truth is that no part of man goes to heaven...he sleeps in the grave until called forth by the Lord Jesus, as he did when He resurrected Lazarus, who 'slept' in the grave, not heaven (John 11v11).<br>  <br>  And again..........  God is the only one that is immortal  (1 Tim. 6:16)<br>  <br>  "Blessed are the meek: for they shall inherit the earth" (Matt. 5:5) - not '...for their souls shall go to heaven'.<br>  <br>  "In death there is no remembrance of Thee: in the grave, who shall give Thee thanks?" (Psalm 6:5).<br>  <br>  ECC.  9 V 5    For the living know that they will die; But the dead know nothing, And they have no more reward, For the memory of them is forgotten.<br>  6   Also their love, their hatred, and their envy have now perished; Nevermore will they have a share In anything done under the sun.<br>  <br>  So basically what happens to you is that when we die, we are in the grave untill Christ comes back.    The scriptures state that it will be like a "blink of an eye" until we are raised.   Why a blink of an eye?   Because in death there is nothing,  no memory or afterlife, no nothing.  You cease to exist.|`|A1xOf1O9aa	you will not find any proof of any destination when life ends. That is the only "logic" you will receive from a "faith" type question.

5b3uOQc6aa	Our Belief: Fate good and bad is from Allah.<br>  God predestines and then brings that out, which is our destiny.<br>  Simple Imaan. <br>  <br>  Dear Muslim, there was a group of people in early Islam called Qadrias and another called Jabariahs. They went into extremes in regards to belief in fate. Our Messenger said the Qadriahs [who didn't believe in fate/destiny] were the fire worshippers of this Ummah. I.e. they have no part in Islam.<br>  Before the end of times, these beliefs will re-emerge. And God will make such people metamorphose into animals.<br>  <br>  Horoscopes show the belief in luck and the stars. Which Islamically, is forbidden. Yes, the cosmos has secrets. But those are Allah's to know. Because every person who delved into the studies of the Stars lost some or all of his religion.<br>  <br>  To read it is sin, to believe it could be kufr. Yes. Prayers aren't accepted for 40 days.<br>  *Our Messenger said: 'Laa tiyaarah fil Islam.' 'There is no superstition/bad omen in Islam.' <br>  *Our Messenger said about the one who goes to the fortune teller, 'he has disbelieved in what was revealed to Abul Qaasim' i.e. The Messenger. What a warning!<br>  *Our Messenger said: ''If' opens the door of Satan.'<br>  i.e. Don't say if this happened, this wouldn't have happened. No, God decreed it as such.<br>  <br>  P.S Those E-mails, if you don't do this this will happen on you're not a true muslim. Or somebody had a dream that this many Muslims are in Hell..<br>  All lies. False. Don't belief this rubbish.<br>  <br>  Besides, nowadays the horoscopes are made by some fat spinster. Anyone can make it up. Today, you will regret something. Then, you MAKE yourself believe it. <br>  ISLAM CAME TO FREE US FROM SUPERSTITION TO UNDERSTANDING.|`|fN6eDrFKaa	Praise be to Allaah. <br>  <br>  Astrology, horoscopes, superstition and fortune-telling are all actions of jaahiliyyah (ignorance) which Islam came to show as false and to explain that they are shirk, because they involve depending on something other than Allaah and believing that benefit and harm come from something other than Him, and believing the words of fortune-tellers and soothsayers who falsely claim to have knowledge of the unseen in order to cheat people of their money and change their beliefs. The evidence (daleel) for that is the hadeeth narrated by Abu Dawood in his Sunan with a saheeh isnaad from Ibn ‘Abbaas (may Allaah be pleased with him), that the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Whoever learns anything of astrology has learned a branch of witchcraft (al-sihr)…” And al-Bazzaar narrated with a jayyid isnaad from ‘Imraan ibn Husayn that the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “He is not one of us who practises augury or has it done for him, who tells fortunes or has his fortune told, or who practises witchcraft or has that done for him.” Whoever claims to know some matter of the unseen either is a fortune-teller or is acting like a fortune-teller in some sense, because Allaah is the only One Who has knowledge of the unseen. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning);<br>  <br>  “Say: ‘None in the heavens and the earth knows the Ghayb (Unseen) except Allaah…’” <br>  <br>  [al-Naml 27:65] <br>  <br>   My advice to everyone who has anything to do with these matters is to repent to Allaah and ask for His forgiveness, and to depend only on Allaah and to put their trust in Him in all their affairs, whilst following the practical means that are prescribed or permitted in sharee’ah. They should give up these matters of jaahiliyyah, keep away from them and avoid asking the people who practise them or believe what they say, out of obedience to Allaah and His Messenger (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), and in order to protect his commitment to Islam and his ‘aqeedah (religious belief).<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Adapted from Majmoo’ Fataawa Shaykh Ibn Baaz (may Allaah have mercy on him), 2/123|`|berHpm4eaa	well...its haram to believe in it then why bother reading it?<br>  because once you read it you want to read it everytime...and you may not admitt it but you start to kind of believe in it...<br>  just like i used to tell you and the other girls off for reading it..<br>  <br>  im telling you again:<br>  <br>  DON'T READ IT!!!

He, peace be upon him, said, "They are nothing." They said, "O Allah's Apostle! Some of their talks come true." The Prophet, peace be upon him, said, "That word which happens to be true is what a Jinn snatches away by stealth (from the Heaven) and pours it in the ears of his friend (the foreteller) with a sound like the cackling of a hen. The soothsayers then mix with that word, one hundred lies."<br>  (Sahih al-Bukhari: Book of Tawheed)<br>  <br>  ADDITIONAL NOTE:<br>  <br>  There is a severe punishment in Islam for just visiting a fortune-teller (whether one believes in their prediction or not):<br>  <br>  Safiyya reported from some of the wives of Allaah's Prophet (sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam) Allaah's Prophet (sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam) having said: He who visits a divner ('Arraf) and asks him about anything, his prayers extending to forty nights will not be accepted. <br>  (Sahih Muslim: Book of Salutations & Greetings: Chapter> Kahanat (Divination) is Prohibited and it is Forbidden to go tp the Kahin)|`|qky7gWosaa	It is not permissible to read horoscopes.

Well, we pay for the sins of our parents. As a person, when we follow the teachings of Christ, we live right and commit less wrongs. Our lives display the blessings that comes with living and doing right. When God love us, He blesses our seed, meaning our children. When the majority of society follow God, the whole country benefits and vice versa.<br>  <br>  2)  One has to understand that satan was cast down to earth before the creation of humans. Satan has managed to make the human race a fallen race through sin. Then along comes Job, a righteous human. Satan challenges God. If You do this and that, Job will surely not worship You. So Job was an excellent proof to satan that there are a handful of humans who are like Job, who will worship God and not blame Him for anything b/c we are His created beings and are owned by Him. After all the hardships, God blessed Job and restored him.<br>  <br>  3) God is not found 'magically'. We seek Him with all our hearts to find Him. The bible teaches reincarnation. Let's say in this life, you tell God you won't ever worship Him. You die and get reincarnated. You think you'll get the chance to worship Him after making that deal with Him? No. Perhaps some children will never get the chance b/c of this. Just my guess. The real reason/s, only God knows.<br>  <br>  4) Christ was incarnated as a human. He knows what pain is. The cross is proof.<br>  <br>  5) Alcohol was obviously used in Jewish wedding celebrations. Anything taken to extreme is bad. <br>  <br>  6) God is uncreated. Know what this means. <br>  <br>  Can you 'take care' of yourself against satan? against dark evil forces? Fact : everyone needs God to take care of us. W/o Him, we will be tortured by satan, dark evil forces. Look at the suffering in this world.|`|AA10392426	1.) God lets children die in africa because it is cruel to let them keep living in poverty and in heaven there is no pain<br>  2.) To prove to satan that faith can withstand all, and if i remember correctly, didn't god give Job all of that stuff back to him ten fold after Job and god proved satan wrong?<br>  3.) God is apart of all of us and this is evident through innocence (lack of sin). Children are born pure, that's why they smile, laugh, and live without depression because they haven't been corrupted by sin. Dying as a child isn't such a terrible thing, they just get that much closer to god because of their innocence. A child would not get angry over this, their innocence is something of awe, and it is thier reason for bliss.<br>  4.) I'm assuming he did feel those things if he felt ALL of our pain.<br>  5.) We can't buy alcohol on sunday because of the dogmas of the church, they push their ideologies on us that can't be found in any religous record to control us and force us into thier beliefs.<br>  6.) God came from our faith, if we believe in him truely, then is their for us, but if we turn our backs to him then he is no where to be found.<br>  7.) Faith is not weakness, it's the ability to open your mind and be able to trust something that is sometimes questionable and some people who are too closed minded to accept the idea of a god think that our open mindedness towards what cannot always be seen is a mental disorder (such as psychosis). But in actuality they are the ones who are weak by rooting themselves in their anger against the spiritual.|`|gf3CCvuUaa	1) They die because of sickness and hunger, not because of God's will. Part of it is man-made, because government failed to do their job properly of making their citizens prosper. Clearly not God's will.<br>  <br>  2) The Roman Catholic Church has ruled out this part of the bible as allegorical and does not represent literal meaning. However, the old testament more or less shows the omnipotent, just and ruling God, rather than a caring and loving one. For example, He punishes Sodom and Gomorrah.<br>  <br>  3) We don't find God. It's just as we grow adult, we're more exposed to evil that we're keeping a distance with God. That way, we need to find God again. Those children who happened to die young would enjoy the privilege of innocence to find their way to heaven.<br>  <br>  4) Yes, He does.<br>  <br>  5) Who says we can't buy alcohol on Sunday? Let alone, you can drink as much alcohol as you want, if you can be responsible and not drunk. Given that you can't, then we're not supposed to drink that much. And especially on the Lord's day, we're not supposed to drink irresponsibly.<br>  <br>  6) Nowhere. God is all the beginning and end. He doesn't have anywhere to come from, nor anywhere to go to.|`|oiB4KATuaa	I was brought up an Atheist and came into Christianity quite late so I'm not that well read on the bible etc  I just have my beliefs and I feel they are right, I dont need the wacky bible stories (no offence) telling me things in riddles...I mean did God write the bible? So I can't really answer most of your questions, well I could but I might be here a while, and they are just my opinons...I guess to summarize I dont think its up to God to stop all the bad stuff that happens in the world, its about us accepting and moving through the bad things with the help of God, its hard to understand I know because I work in the crime field and deal with terrible crimes all day, but to me God is about the good part of life, he represents the good and the good in us for example and its not a great example, but someone could do something really awful to me and I might go home and be angry and depressed and maybe start plotting 'revenge' etc and then I think of God and what he would do and that would be to forgive this person  and accept him/her as one of God's creatures who isn't perfect etc and then I lose all those feelings of anger and 'revenge' so thats how he helps me in my life, its not about being weak, its showing a better way...and when I pray I'll pray for something but I'll say you know if you dont give this to me then I'll understand it's not meant to be and I can accept that...but I always get it so its hard for me not to believe?|`|t3b9M0B0aa	1) God has sent over christian organizations to help feed these people <br>  but  it's a very big continent.

In the end job got through it and was blessed even more than he was in the first place.<br>  <br>  3)Because of the abortion epidemic spreading across the world you are certainly right allot of babies don't get a chance to live which is sad =/ but that's our doing not God's.<br>  <br>  4) Yes he felt all the emotional trauma of every person as well as their physical disease.

Just look at nature for that. When a woman becomes pregnant she goes through a pregnany usually lasting arounfd 9 months. During that time the baby is being created. When someone exists before time there can be no measurement of creation because no time is recorded and it was always there. God existed before time and therefore had no creation point but always "was". When he created the universe he made the sun and seasons of the earth to record time as it passed. But he existed before that.|`|hR7OsqtRaa	The influence of Satan is the cause for all evil in this world. Dont blame evil acts on God.

There is plenty of food and money in the world to go round isnt there?  Didn't Geldorf say 'If it wasn't for the greed there would be no one in need' or words to that effect. Also many more will die because of the greed as greedy nations continually tear down the trees in the rain forests.  Man's inhumantiy to man causes the pain and anguish in Africa - it's not just about famine - because the once rich soil  sustained by trees has turned to desert - but because hidious wars and atrocities - mans inhumity to ma.<br>  <br>  ) Job supposedly was a man of faith - but if you notice he would repent on behalf of his children - which says to me that he lived in fear rather than faith. However after that he came to his senses - yes he did suffer dreadfully but it is also a story that reveals that Satan can do absolutely nothing without God's permission - which may shut the mouths of many Christians who blame everything on Satan that goes wrong in their lives instead of looking at maybe there is something they need to change in their lives. God rewarded Job with far more than he had before.  Which is a way of saying that although we may suffer our ultimate destiny will be far better.  i.e. heaven and a new world.<br>  <br>  Children who die go straight back to God - because they are too young to know right from wrong and God never expects them to try and live by standards they are too young to understand. kids are kids after all...God knows that.<br>  <br>  The crucifiction wasn't about physical pain - but spiritual pain -a total separation from God - read that. A world without God would be even darker than it is already. <br>  <br>  Some say a belief in God is a sign of weakness - in fact it is just a recognition that we believe in someone bigger and better than ourselves and wish to follow his example of love and forgiveness to all men. We came to the realisation that perhaps we weren't loving our neighbour as ourselves - were critical and ruining our lives by some of our actions...and we couldnt change ourselves. Being a Christian is not an easy road to travel by any means-and if people find it is than I suggest they are fooling themselves. Basically it is with the God's help that we can be better people.  It is people who hurt others not God - back to the story of Job - Satan only was limited in what he could do - and Job bore it all - at one point he was suicidal - but he came out of it a stronger person.  As with us God doesn't give us more than we can bare.<br>  <br>  A lot of good things come out of tradgedy. Laws have been changed etc etc. Children no longer climb chimneys or work in mines - laws bought about by Christians who probably agreed with it before they knew God.  Lets face is no one is born good - you only have to look at children to realise that - they hopefully are given certain standards by their parents that help them to grow into good and caring citizens.  But the first words a child uses after learning Mummy and Daddy is usually NO! and the rebellion continues doesn't it? Just as we rebel against God even though his commandments make sense for a more loving and peaceful world.<br>  <br>  For instance - some think that God is a spoil sport with regard to sex. But look at the world today - children having babies, a rise in STD's the spread of Aids- marriage break ups - multiple partners - men and women loosing out on seeing their offspring when there is divorce. Grandparents denied the joy of seeing their grandkids when there is divorce etc. No one comes out of divorce unscathed -  it really is a sad old world really.  Even the economic crisis is evidence of the greed in this world and the me me me mind set.<br>  <br>  I'm a Christian - I am not perfect but am being perfected - the day I am perfect is the day my spirit leaves my body and stands before God.<br>  <br>  We are to tiny to know where God came from - we don't know everything even though a lot of folk believe they do - and that is why what we have is called faith.  After all a goldfish in a tank is unaware he is in a room, which is in a house, which is in a street, in a town, in a county/suburb/ in a country which is in a world, etc. Like us the goldfish minds are not big enough to grasp or understand the hugeness of the universe let alone God.<br>  <br>  Being a Christian is not an easy - no problem journey - but it is a journey of self discovery and sometimes the things we discover about ourselves aren't very nice and we hopefully will change our thoughts or actions accordingly.  <br>  <br>  Yes Jesus turned the water in to wine - and even Paul suggested one of the followers took a little wine for his stomach problem - so the laws on alcohol are man made.  Jesus also said that during one ceremony drink this wine in remembrance of me.  Alcohol can be used in a celebration or abused by those who are in pain and it can destroy many lives- not only theirs but people who love them. People do have choices - but drugs and alcohol are oft

AA11142708	For the most part, Buddhists practice non violence, vegetarianism, meditation (the discipline of mental focus and repose), and compassion and respect for all sentient beings. The Buddhist path is called the Middle Way, meaning that it is open to all who choose to practice Buddhism. However, some people may have a difficult time adapting to Buddhist disciplines, the disciplines leading to ethical behavior in thought, word, and deed. The purpose of this practice is to seek the elimination of unnecessary suffering. From what I understand from news reports, the Sri Lanka soldiers may call themselves Buddhists, but are they the real deal? <br>  <br>  Theravada Buddhism, the Buddhism practiced in Sri Lanka, is, if anything, a more strict version of Buddhism than what I have already described. If the soldiers are practicing Buddhist's (which they most likely are not) then they fall into that group of Buddhists that are Buddhists in name only--Buddhists who do not practice the ethical disciplines which, ultimately, identify Buddhists from non-Buddhists. Thanks for the question. I hope this helps.|`|RRJFI9Oqaa	Buddhism understands the phrase ' to err is human' very well.<br>  In wordly affairs, there will be mistakes whether Buddhists or nonBuddhists.<br>  Because every one thinks they are right.<br>  <br>  That is why, Buddha left worldly affairs behind and went into forest.|`|64292d1d2bf96e71973f028f1912878aaa	Most of the Sri Lankans are Buddhists and most of the sri lankan Buddhists are peaceful people.<br>  But there is a war going in Sri Lanka,against a terrorist group who is using Tamil civilians as a human shield.Government forces are trying rescue the the civilians and recapture the area held by the terrorists.<br>  <br>  Government is fighting against the terrorists to stop suicide bombings and village mascaras done by the terrorists.|`|P49Ie95xaa	Sri Lanka is a Buddhist country. But the war has nothing to do with buddhist teachings. Even though Buddhist teachings are there they are not using it in solving this problem. There are Buddhist people and even monks who support the war. It is their personal choice which has nothing to do with Buddhism. <br>  Srilankans have tolerated LTTE terrorists for something like 20 years. They have even tried peace talks which didn't work. Despite of being a Buddhists they just can't tolerate it anymore.

But if you do not forgive men their sins, your Father will not forgive your sins." <br>  <br>  So if the person who did not commit adultery wants to be forgiven of all their sins, they must also forgive anyone who sins against them.<br>  <br>  But, I think it's important to know that your fiance did not commit adultery.  You two are not married.  If you have sex with him before marriage it is a sin of sexual immorality and no different than adultery in the eyes of God.

If a person drives to a bar sits down and has several drinks and then drives home and hits someone with their car and they die it is murder.    When they sat down and had that first drink they knew what could happen when they left the bar.    Same thing.  Before he had that first drink he was sober and knew what could happen after drinking a few drinks.  They just didn't care and was selfish.   I say run and find someone who will be honest and not use alcohol as an excuse.<br>  <br>  Also, if he has a drinking problem I would not marry him until he was sober for many years and can prove he can control and be the man you want and the man he should be to you.   Alcoholics and marriage are very hard and violent.   The majority anyway.<br>  <br>  Ask yourself one question?  "If this was your daughter, what advice would you give her"?

WRSNIusaaa	Mitosis is the way cells in the body reproduce without changing the DNA (obviously so the cells all work the same). So the DNA is copied and 2 daughter cells are produced (which are identical to the parent cell). I'm pretty sure it occurs in all cells except sex cells (or gametes) but it's different for some, like red blood cells, which don't have a nucleus.<br>  Meiosis is the production of sex cells. It involves the cell splitting twice (once the original and then both of the original halves), producing 4 daughter cells with half the chromosomes (obviously so that when the ovum and sperm meet, they form a genetically unique zygote). Meiosis is the perfect way to guarantee genetic diversity in a species, which is actually also why incest is dangerous, because the DNA is too similar in each sex cell and causes problems.<br>  <br>  I think the only thing you listed which goes in both categories is that the chromosomes divide, the difference is that in mitosis they divide and then replicate, and in meiosis they divide and stay divided.<br>  <br>  That's pretty much all i can remember from human biology.

UhyvM73iaa	Assalamu Alaikum,<br>  <br>  See what Allah says about Prophet Ibrahim AS:<br>  <br>   "Abrahim was not a Jew nor Christian; but an upright Muslim." (Quran Soorah Aa,e Imraan 3:67)<br>  <br>  There is no Prophet sent by God after Mohammad Prophet and Messenger of Allah SAW because Allah says"<br>  <br>  "This day have I perfected your religion for you, completed My favour upon you, and have chosen for you Islam as your religion". (Soorah Al-Maa'idah 5:3)<br>  <br>  After Allah perfected and completed the religion Islam, which Prophet Ibraham also preached, there was no need of any other religion after Mohammad SAW. That is why Allah protects Quran Himself from any alteration or changes in it. He put a miracle in Quran that enables millions of Muslim Arab and Non-Arab children and adults to memorize Quran from cover to cover correctly though they most of the Non-Arabs Muslims who memorize Quran don't undertand Arabic language. They can not memorize any book in their own language but they can memorize Quran. It is only because of the miracle of Allah <br>  Associated with Quran to protect it from corruption.<br>  <br>  All men whom claimed themselves to be Prophets are fake Prophets and not from Allah. Prophet Mohammad did warn his companions that there will be fake prophets after I will be gone..  <br>  <br>  About religion of Islam being the only true religion Allahs says:<br>  <br>  "If anyone desires a religion other than Islam (submission to Allah (God) never will It be accepted of Him" (Soorah Aal'imraan 3:85)<br>  <br>  This statement of Quran, negats all religons other than Islam as not true religions today. Prophet Ibrahim and Jesus Christ also taught Islam. But followers gave their religion names other than Islam and changed lots of teachings of Prophets. Allah didn't protect those books because Allah was going to send His final and complete revelation Al-Quran to replace all previous books.  Prophet Mohammad SAW  was also from the descendents of Prophet Ibrahim but Jews and Christians do not accept Al-Quran because Prophet Mohammad SAW was an Arab. They have a stupid superiority complex that they have much higher intelligence than Arabs so they refuse to accept Mohasmmad SAW beeing an Arab Prophet of Allah.<br>  <br>   It is their own loss and not the loss of any Arab or Islam or Quran. When they will face Allah on the day of Judgment, they will know how wrong they were. But it will be too late for them and they will suffer consequences pf their disbeleif in true Islam from Allah.  <br>  <br>  Lots of Christians do realize that they have been in dark after they study Quran. This is why highest  number of converts are Christians in all Christian Christian countries and their number is increasing.<br>  <br>  May Allah guide us all to the true religon Islam, forgive our sins and lead us to obedience to Allah and Quran and Prophet Mohammad SAW in all aspects of our lives so we become worthy of heaven in next life. Ameen|`|qPSkkPqwaa	In ur 2nd paragraph u mentioned people claiming prophethood, that is falsehood as Muhammad HIMSELF said many times in hadith and his farewell speech, no  prophet or messenger will come after him.<br>  <br>  We dont need any prophet bcoz Muhammad was sent with the revelation of Quran which is guide to mankind till Day oF JUDEGEMENT.

He with Allahs guidance brought the complete final message "in tact" and Allah made sure this time that we humans wouldnt alter the message in translation..

So when the knowledge of human being reached to the level when Mohd (pbuh) was the massenger. God made a promis to human being and said i take the repolsibility to preserve this message for the rest of human race, and then i will make this language (arabic) a living language. Thats why besause the language is a living language and the message is preserved there was no need to send further massengers. I hope that answers both of ur questions. when i have a question in my mind i prey to Allah and ask for his Guidence and he always helps me. May God give us the wisdom to understand him better.|`|Bb6fQtl0aa	1) It is not correct to refer to Judaism and Christianity as Abrahamic religions.

But Christianity and Judaism today do not follow the original teachings of the Prophets.<br>  <br>  2) Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him is the final Prophet/Messenger sent to all mankind.

I think this confusion is due to the language i.e. prophecy - Prophet.<br>  <br>  While the Quran is clear that Mohammad did NOT know the future i.e. <br>  <br>  Ref. 7:188<br>  Say, "I have no power to benefit myself, or harm myself. Only what GOD wills happens to me. If I knew the future, I would have increased my wealth, and no harm would have afflicted me. I am no more than a warner, and a bearer of good news for those who believe."<br>  <br>  ---<br>  <br>  As per Quran the Prophet is the one who is given "FIRM COMMANDMENTS" in the form of scriptures. And the messenger is the one who EXPLAINS the scripture.<br>  <br>  A prophet may receive the scripture AND would NOT know the meaning of the ENTIRE scripture that he has received. i.e. Mohammad did NOT know the meanings of the "ENTIRE" Quran. He knew only a part of it.<br>  <br>  God is the teacher of the Quran. And He reveals it at APPROPRIATE times i.e.<br>  <br>  Ref. 5:101<br>  O you who believe, do not ask about matters which, if revealed to you prematurely, would hurt you. If you ask about them in light of the Quran, they will become obvious to you. GOD has deliberately overlooked them. GOD is Forgiver, Clement.<br>  <br>  AND GOD is the teacher of the Quran:<br>  <br>  Ref. 55:2<br>  Teacher of the Quran.<br>  <br>  --------<br>  <br>  75:16<br>  Do not move your tongue to hasten it.<br>  <br>  75:17<br>  It is we who will collect it into Quran.<br>  <br>  75:18<br>  Once we recite it, you shall follow such a Quran.<br>  <br>  75:19<br>  Then it is we who will explain it.<br>  ------------<br>  <br>  The Messengers come at appropriate time and deliver the messages explaining the scripture. The messages that are vital for the problems of those times.<br>  <br>  The difference between the Nabi (Prophets) and Rasool (Messenger) is explained by TWO verses:<br>  <br>  The verse 22:52, tells us that ther prophet and messenger are NOT one and the same thing. They are TWO different roles:<br>  <br>  22:52<br>  We did not send before you any messenger, nor a prophet, without having the devil interfere in his wishes. GOD then nullifies what the devil has done. GOD perfects His revelations. GOD is Omniscient, Most Wise.<br>  <br>  NOTE: the phrase "messenger NOR a prophet.<br>  <br>  The difference between the two is explained:<br>  <br>  3:81<br>  GOD took a covenant from the prophets, saying, "I will give you the scripture and wisdom. Afterwards, a messenger will come to confirm all existing scriptures. You shall believe in him and support him." He said, "Do you agree with this, and pledge to fulfill this covenant?" They said, "We agree." He said, "You have thus borne witness, and I bear witness along with you."<br>  <br>  Note:  The prophets are given the scripture and wisdom. While the messenger CONFIRMS the existing scripture.<br>  <br>  The above verse ALSO confirms that ATLEAST one Messenger was to come "AFTER" ALL the prophets.<br>  <br>  Now Mohammad was a prophet as well (in fact the FINAL prophet). This concludes that ANOTHER messenger had to follow AFTER Mohammad. ATLEAST one messenger. AND not necessarily the Last messenger. In fact there is NO such term as "Last Messenger" in the Quran.<br>  <br>  As far as "Elijah" and "Baha-ullah" are concerned, I have no idea about them. As far as Mirza Ghulam Ahmed Qadiani is concerned, I would say that my personal opinion goes HIGHLY against him. He seems to be a clear cheat. A Qadiani who corresponded with me, insisted that I have not read about him from the Qadiani literature. But in fact, I have read about them even from their literature as well.<br>  <br>  Mirza Ghulam Ahmed Qadiani was a power and fame and money and woman hungry person. There are 8 vital failures of his life. And one of the failures was that he wanted to marry a lady who was the daughter of one of his own disciples. He failed. And then he cursed the husband of that lady. <br>  <br>  The above may be refuted by the Qadianis. And I don't wish to get into a debate in this matter. I wish to engage on core issues than to get entangled in peripheral non-issues.<br>  <br>  The whole matter is that, a serious student of the Quran will find out that there are 03 vital criterias that are needed to identify a person as a messenger. (Note: I believe that Rashad Khalifa was the prophesied messenger to follow AFTER Mohammad, he may or may not the be last).<br>  <br>  The 3 criterias that are necessary to a good extent are:<br>  <br>  1-  The messenger will advocate to "Obey GOD ALONE".<br>  2-  MUST NOT ask for a return / wage.<br>  3-  Should be associated with a sign.<br>  <br>  The last (3rd) point, is something that MAY be debatable. <br>  <br>  For example, Noah did not demonstrate any miracles. Similarly Shoaib and Hud also did not demonstrate any miracles. Although Mohammad also did not demonstrate any miracles "BUT" the accounts say that "the revelation of the Quran" was itself a miracle i.e. prior to Mohammad "ONLY" the progeny of Ishaq (Isaac) had received the scriptures. <br>  <br>  The Arabs wanted to have the scripture. It was there dire wish. They knew the Abrahamic religion ONLY through hearsays. But when the scripture finally came, they were the ones who opposed it ( a typical historical trait).<br>  <br>  Ref. 2:78<br>  Among them are gentiles who do not know the scripture, except through hearsay, then assume that they know it.<br>  <br>  Note:  The Arabs were gentiles and they knew the scripture ONLY thru hearsays.<br>  <br>  Ref. 29:51<br>  Is it not enough of a miracle that we sent down to you this book, being recited to them? This is indeed a mercy and a reminder for people who believe.<br>  <br>  --------<br>  <br>  Regarding Rashad Khalifa. He was from Arabic family. And the Arabs are descendants of Abraham (thru Ismail).<br>  <br>  <br>  @Asker:<br>  First I have already pointed out that "Rashad Khalifa" was from an Arabic family. And thus in all probability he is a descendent of Abraham.<br>  <br>  2-  Which point do you need an evidence / proof to ?|`|e3PWZYsAaa	Salam,<br>  <br>  yes, all these religions are related to Abrahim (PBUH&HF) since the prophets of these religions are his children.......<br>  as we can see, it's the sunna of Allah SWT to keep the religion leaders in the same family root.......<br>  <br>  Prophet Mohammad (PBUH&HF) is the last and final messanger, there will be no more prophets or messengers after him........<br>  .....but Allah SWT has chosen Imams after the prophet, to guide people and keep the religion alive.....<br>  these Imams are born to give their lifes for Islam.......<br>  ......and we've seen great examples of this such as the event of Karbala......<br>  <br>  Allah SWT says:<br>  4:59<br>  "O ye who believe!

jM7CyxQzaa	Hi there<br>  <br>  No disrespect meant but to be honest Cunningham is not such a good author as you're thinking, the man pretty much invented Solitary Wicca despite never having actually been involved much less initiated into a genuine Wiccan Coven,  He has caused a lot of argument between those folks who are genuine seekers and claiming 'Wicca' as their belief system because they really don't realise - having followed, to the letter, his teachings -  and those who are of the 'old school' and put in the work to be initiated into a coven. He was an american living at a time when finding a geniune Wiccan coven in the states was not an easy task. No one has an issue with him trying to make things easier for Seekers as he did, just with what he's called his 'path' It would be like saying you are a Doctor but have never been to Med school.<br>  <br>  His teachings in general are basically good if VERY simplified, his interpretation of things is often questionable,also when he gives ingredients for Incense and suchlike he does not, anywhere, give the warnings that any responsible author should do (such as never using camphor around someone with breathing problems and similar things) Take his books with a large pinch of salt and try to branch out to other authors, cross referencing the info he gives with as much as possible (not silver ravenwolf either <grins>) Pop Wicca is the term given to his style of wicca now.<br>  <br>  Ok on to your question<br>  <br>  I can see your reasoning behind counting Light and Dark as 'elements' but I think your influences are more 'pop wicca' related than actual solid understanding, sorry to sound so blunt :( there is a lot of misinformation coming into Pagan interpretation due to such programmes as Buffy, and books like Twilight. There are online quizzes using 'light and dark' as elements too and most genuine Pagan practitioners will discount them as Elements. <br>  <br>  Please could you alse explain what you mean about 'darkness is more of a mental thing relying on speed and agility to be of any use to attackers' that bit to me DEFINATELY sounds like 'Pop Wicca meets Occult storytelling aka Buffy/Twilight/Charmed' I'm happy to be convinced otherwise tho if you'd care to elaborate?<br>  <br>  Now to most Magical practitioners the five elements are, as you've mentioned Earth, Air, Fire, Water and Spirit - Spirit is considered an element because it is not only the 'spirit' in a being - they way you describe it is more of a 'soul' of an individual than understanding of Spirit the Element - it is the whole of Nature, of Diety and of 'that which makes your heart catch and you to suddenly feel connected to the world and it's beauty, or to the Gods if you're so inclined.<br>  <br>  Light and Dark are not seen as separate from those original Elements as they make up a part of Spirit - much work is done for both Light and Dark but within an elemental framework and also Diety understanding. (ie for a 'darker' aspect of Earth a person may be' stuck in their ways', for a dark aspect of 'air' a person may be airy fairy and never able to concentrate on anything for long, both of which would be worked on as a whole to bring the person into balance, so not only balance with the elements but the 'light and dark' aspects of those elements)<br>  <br>   Also, and more importantly in the case of Wicca the Dark and Light are connected - obviously, to the Sun and Moon and therefore connected with the God and Goddess -<br>  <br>  Remember that in Wicca the Goddess is associated with the Moon which has an important role within Wicca, we follow the moon cycles and the three phases of the moon, ie that of Maid Mother and Crone (new, waxing and waning and also technically a fourth) and Darkness as you have it here is covered by the Crone aspect and therefore part of Diety understanding. <br>  <br>  The Sun is seen in Wicca as the Sun God or God, ie Lugh from where we get the festival of Lughnasa, and the fact that Midsummer - the time when the Light is at is strongest is also a pagan festival - so again Light is  covered by study of the Gods and within the Wheel of the Year (they festival cycle) not seen as something separate from the whole.<br>  <br>  The whole 'light and dark' as elements as you cite here is, as I've said more to do with gaming, or with things such as Charmed and Twilight which is why you won't find any online info on it because no one writes any since it's not technically correct, just something that has been picked up on by the media.|`|UxooffHZaa	I believe the soul and body are one, but also that our bodies dissintigrate, and our souls are released, like fertile soil is made from dissintigrating plant and animal matter.

Spirit is only lukewarm for me, because I think all of the other elements create the spirit, so it's not really elemental by nature. <br>  I unfortunately am not sure exactly what you're looking for when it comes to the other two elements. I've worked with them, myself, and have always felt a stronger connection with the dark over the light. I think that people fear the dark, and that in general, we should learn not to. That there is something to learn from the darkness- both within and without. For beings of the dark, I believe that shadow people (as they are normally called) relate well to the darkness. And unlike most, I find the darkness to be more male in orientation... but that's just me. <br>  If you wanted, you could email me some more specifics, and I can see what I can do.|`|AA11403222	As a pagan, I consider spirit that which binds all things together.  I agree that all things have spirit.  I haven't really thought of light and darkness as elements, but I can see your point.  The answer you got before mine is as good an explanation as any.  I see Light and Dark as an integral part of the balance of nature.  You can't have life without either of them, and even where light doesn't exist (the deep ocean) you have light created by the creatures themselves.<br>  Darkness equals mystery, things to be hidden, danger and caution, self-protection and personal concealment.<br>  Light is its opposite, being: revealing, boldness, power, life-giving.|`|YXGdwwTJaa	Your ideas are as valid as any other, including official religions. <br>  <br>   Only if you want to spread your word, please make it a little clearer as I am not finding it easy to follow.  <br>  <br>  You can have as many elements as you want, and whatever deities you feel exist and are relevant to you.  Religions and practice are personal.  <br>   <br>  I have not read Scott Cunnimgham,  though I have a book about incense by him, so I know little of what he was like.|`|jyqpeg40aa	Finally!! Someone who understands that religion is just what you believe it to be - it should not be constantly under attack if you don't feel the same way. <br>  Anyway, yes I see what you are saying - light, darkness, spirit. But (and not to put your opinion to the curb) why not think of light as an energy as well? Light is the form of which we see all (even the beyond). It helps with the focus of other element (fire would not be as destructive without the light to guide it.) <br>  Darkness is something that exists from the absence of light, therefor I think that could be the "Antimatter" of light - when they touch it forms a new ground of energy - called the twilight.<br>  The twilight is a "Tween" as a call it for it is the exact middle of light and darkness. With that in mind, I suppose you could say that light and darkness are also elements - it just depends on the view point. But I like the way you are thinking. <br>  <br>  By the way, I am a christian - I believe in one god, my God - yet I do believe there is more than this - everyday life - on this Earth. That is why I became a partial wiccan/pagan!|`|0uqsaxEqaa	I am afraid I agree with Sue on all of what she said. Especially where she states that you won't find information online about it because no one in the Pagan community has written about it. Most genuine Magical practitioners do not use Light and Dark as elements due to the above stated reasons - their use comes from Gaming or tv programs. A few years ago with the revival in the interest of Witchcraft the makers of TV programs learned just enough to put in things like using light and dark as elements - this doesn't make it a normal or even sensible practice.<br>  <br>  If you are finding yourself in positions where you need to use the elements to 'fight' on a regular basis, I'd look at how you're conducting your life. Elemental magic of course can be used to 'fight' but if you go on the offensive be DARN sure you know how to deal with what will inevitably be sent back to you, Which is why most folks with common sense use elemental 'fighting' for protection work and to strengthem themselves. For the same reason I would strongly advise not using Dark to fight in the way you describe it because what you get back may be something you can't handle.<br>  <br>  To answer your qestion, I'd look at teachings from Traditional Witchcraft as what you describe sounds more related to that. <br>  <br>  Not too sure what you mean by 'not needing incantations to make them valid' surely that is a moot point? HOW everyone works varies from person to person - sorry I was confused by that point.

In recent years, many owls have moved from their previous rural habitats to start to inhabit urban areas. The Tawny Owl has been a common visitor to cities across the UK for about forty years, where it survives on a diet of pigeons and small birds. Owls in urban areas are also known to prey on new-born kittens.[9]<br>  <br>  In many parts of the world, owls have been associated with death and misfortune, likely due to their nocturnal activity and common screeching call. However, owls have also been associated with wisdom and prosperity, frequently being companion animals for goddesses. In Hindu Mythology, the barn owl is considered to be the vehicle of Goddess Lakshmi (Goddess of Wealth) and thus it is considered lucky if an owl resides near a house.<br>  <br>  Henry David Thoreau summarized one perception of owls, when he wrote in 1854's Walden, "I rejoice that there are owls. Let them do the idiotic and maniacal hooting for men. It is a sound admirably suited to swamps and twilight woods which no day illustrates, suggesting a vast and underdeveloped nature which men have not recognized. They represent the stark twilight and unsatisfied thoughts which all [men] have."|`|8dd8e579fd621e4b4affcc8b80072b8caa	I have had an OWL around my home now for 3 years and nothing bad has happened here or to me or my family.<br>  The native americans feel and owl showing it self represents death.<br>  Look up Native American culture and look at owls.

He had served 30 years in the military, was on the rifle team and in WW11. He had severe hearing loss & was legally blind and still was only rated at 10% disability.

I know many 80+ disability ratings from Iraq and Afghanistan, one of them being myself, I am 100% both VA and DoD.  With the focus on the disability process nowadays, there are many old claims that are being relooked at, but the system is badly backlogged right now as you've most likely seen in the news.  I can't honestly come up w/a good number.  Most of the older WW2 and Korea guys are getting to the age where they are dying out.  The Vietnam generation are in their 60s.  Most of the really high disability ratings are coming from the new GWOT wars.  There have been over 300k purple hearts awarded.  There will be more and more files claimed as soldiers get out from the unseen Traumatic brain injuries and Post traumatic stress from being exposed to the IED blasts.  Post traumatic stress alone is a 50% rating.  They have a formula ot calculate the final percentage.  The sum of my disabilities is 340 but obvioulsy 100 is the highset you can go.

s3iruA0raa	There is no doubt that he is attracted to you.  Here is the creme de la creme....... you are attracted to him too.  If he is driving you insane, you can't stop thinking about him, You also touch him, you are at a loss for words around him.  I think you are experiencing a closeness that is mixing up your feelings.  He is gazing into your eyes because he feels a strong connection to you.  You can call it love, infatuation, desire, etc. He looks at your lips because he is internalizing (dreaming) about licking them or kissing them or just enjoying the movement of your mouth.  Usually, a person can decipher their own feelings until, they are infatuated or in love, then it is all mixed up. They all straiten out once the other person admits the same feelings then the connection is made.  Ask yourself this question: Are you ok with him touching you if you were in private.  Would you reciprocate? If he kissed you, would you fight, flight, or allow it.  <br>  <br>  It is pretty obvious by your writing that he loves you and maybe he is IN LOVE with you.  Why don't you just tell him how you feel and ask him if he is making advances toward you.

Mirror his actions. When he stares, you do the same. Whenever he comes closer, you get closer. When he touches, you touch. If you leave him the pace and acknowledge and mirror every step, you will soon be where he wants you to be.

It is quite obvious that he is attracted to you! =)<br>  <br>  Talk to him about it.  You should sit him down sometime (preferably at a time when you can't be interrupted) and ask him how he's feeling.  Ask him about his love-life etc.  Get onto the topic of gay people (and this is your chance to show him you have absolutely no prejudice towards gay people) and talk to him about it.  He might come out to you.  If he doesn't, you could tell him.  Ask him about any crushes he might have and see what happens.<br>  <br>  Good luck =)  You've been given a nice opportunity - use it!|`|AA11672481	I'd say that he's definitely attracted to you, and he really wants to keep it a secret.

It is a bank holiday in Northern Ireland and a public holiday in the Republic of Ireland and Montserrat. In Canada, Great Britain, Australia, the United States and New Zealand, it is widely celebrated but is not an official holiday. [1]<br>  <br>  It became a feast day in the Roman Catholic Church due to the influence of the Waterford-born Franciscan scholar Luke Wadding[2] in the early part of the 17th century, and is a holy day of obligation for Roman Catholics in Ireland. The feast day usually falls during Lent; if it falls on a Friday of Lent (unless it is Good Friday), the obligation to abstain from eating meat can be lifted by the local bishop. The date of the feast is occasionally, yet controversially, moved by church authorities when March 17 falls during Holy Week; this happened in 1940 when Saint Patrick's Day was observed on April 3 in order to avoid it coinciding with Palm Sunday, and happened again in 2008, having been observed on 15 March.[3] [4]|`|RWgjnwl9aa	In the Irish Culture we celebrate St Patrick's Day because he is the Patron Saint of Ireland & wearing Green represents Emerald the color of Irlands' lush country side & the Shamrock represents the Blessed Trinity that St Patrick used to explain religion Slainte(cheers & health) to you|`|ROPLbLW9aa	i presume you know what Christmas Day is. yes? 25/12th<br>  <br>  well, St.Patricks Day is the day all the worlds intellectuals take time out to socialise and enjoy the Craic!!! 17/3rd<br>  <br>  Where will YOU be???<br>  <br>  La Feile Padraig do gach duine|`|2oCq5u52aa	it's the celebration of the patron saint of ireland St.Patrick and a celebration of irishness celebrated by irish people and people of irish descent|`|Org2hdfUaa	It's the day of the patron saint of Ireland (St. Patrick, aka Paddy!)<br>  <br>  It is basically a day to celebrate your Irishness! <br>  <br>  =)|`|wgOzHizAaa	St.Patrick was born in Britain to wealthy parents near the end of the fourth century. His father was a Christian Deacon but it is suggested he took the role for the tax incentives and the is no evidence that he came from a particularly religious family. <br>  <br>  When Patrick was 16 he was taken captive by a group of Irish raiders. They transported him to Ireland and Patrick was a prisoner for a little over 6 years. Lonely and afraid he turned to his religion for solace, becoming a devout Christian. One night Patrick believed that God spoke to him in a dream, telling him it was time for him to leave Ireland. <br>  <br>  After Patrick returned to England he claimed to have another dream, telling him to return to Ireland as a missionary. Soon after Patrick began religious training, a course of study that lasted more than 15 years. After his ordination as a priest, he was sent to Ireland with a dual mission; to minister Christians that were already living there and to convert the Irish. <br>  <br>  Familiar with the Irish language and culture, Patrick chose to incorporate traditional ritual into his lessons of Christianity instead of attempting to eradicate native Irish beliefs. For instance, he used bonfires to celebrate Easter since the Irish were used to honoring their gods with fire. He also superimposed a sun, a powerful Irish symbol, onto the Christian cross to create what is now called a Celtic cross, so that veneration of the symbol would seem more natural to the Irish.<br>  <br>  St. Patrick's Day is celebrated on March 17, his religious feast day and the anniversary of his death in the fifth century. The Irish have observed this day as a religious holiday for over a thousand years.<br>  <br>  On St. Patrick's Day, which falls during the Christian season of Lent, Irish families would traditionally attend church in the morning and celebrate in the afternoon. Lenten prohibitions against the consumption of meat were waived and people would dance, drink, and feast—on the traditional meal of Irish bacon and cabbage.<br>  <br>  The first St. Patrick's Day parade took place not in Ireland, but in the United States. Irish soldiers serving in the English military marched through New York City on March 17, 1762. Along with their music, the parade helped the soldiers to reconnect with their Irish roots, as well as fellow Irishmen serving in the English army.<br>  <br>  Over the next thirty-five years, Irish patriotism among American immigrants flourished, prompting the rise of so-called "Irish Aid" societies, like the Friendly Sons of Saint Patrick and the Hibernian Society. Each group would hold annual parades featuring bagpipes (which actually first became popular in the Scottish and British armies) and drums.<br>  <br>  In 1848, several New York Irish aid societies decided to unite their parades to form one New York City St. Patrick's Day Parade. Today, that parade is the world 's oldest civilian parade and the largest in the United States, with over 150,000 participants.<br>  <br>  Each year, nearly three million people line the one-and-a-half mile parade route to watch the procession, which takes more than five hours. Boston, Chicago, Philadelphia, and Savannah also celebrate the day with parades including between 10,000 to 20,000 participants.|`|Ilk5Xbzfaa	Hello. My name is Patrick. I was named after St Patrick and I was born in March, the same month St Patrick was born. On March 17 every year, people who are Irish and proud celebrate his feast day. He is a saint in the Catholic Church and he told the Irish people about Jesus., On this day (March 17) if you live in Boston or New York in the USA, where there are many Irish people, we have a parade to celebrate. In New York, we march along 5th Avenue by Central Park, and the traffic and cars are shut down. If you want to be Irish for one day, wear something the color green on this day. Thank you.|`|9886899d6f135552d9c3c4f7e401043daa	Its the greatest day in Ireland when all the Leprechauns take a public holiday and go out and get drunk.

IwvszgPdaa	i would say "ive been arguing"|`|pQ0n9IGTaa	Both are correct, but I would say "I have" instead of "I've" because I've sounds so much like "I" so to the listener's ear it would sound like, "I argued with my boss."  Which is, of course, incorrect.|`|ed71a2e7f354d346a0ff1de177befe5faa	Both are correct, but I would change the "almost all the afternoon" to "most of the afternoon".  Means the same thing, but sounds better.|`|AA11102193	It depends - when you say this, are you still working?<br>  <br>  If yes (you're still at work, and are talking to a coworker, for example):<br>  <br>  What a bad day! I've been working for 8 hours and (I've been) arguing with my boss almost all afternoon long.<br>  <br>  If not (you've finished work and are telling somebody about your day after it's over):<br>  <br>  What a bad day! I worked for 8 hours and (I) argued with my boss almost all afternoon long.<br>  <br>  (You must use "past simple" tense to express something that is not continuing through to the present.)|`|spbCARk6aa	Well actually, both sound ok. Change the 'I've' to 'I have' when you say it. When you do that the first one flows better. I believe it is redundant to say I have been. So I would say the first one is right but I'm only about 75% sure.|`|R0mZqqfXaa	Both are correct.

tC1hF1y5aa	A Mormon can marry anybody they want to, just not be sealed in the temple until the spouse converts.  There are many, many "mixed" marriages that seem to be quite successful.  I almost married a Baptist boy - but, at the time, I came to my senses and married within my religion.  That marriage failed.  So there are no guarantees either way - just the hope that you will "endure to the end".  Best wishes.|`|LuN1unJ3aa	A number of members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (Mormons) marry outside their religion. No member is ever shunned for marrying outside the path.<br>  <br>  I believe the same can be said for members of Baptist Churches (that they can marry someone outside their religion).|`|IS7Xubkfaa	Somebody would have to convert. <br>  <br>  My nephew married a Mormon and he was Catholic.

It may be weird to you, but that is our culture, we have our own culture, that is where the problem lies.  Ppl don't want to give us that, we are not assimilators, that is why.

It may be unique/special/extraordinary to that parent as to why they choose those specific names.|`|EmOnt7FIaa	LaThongda?|`|maVptaMZaa	You say that your question is not racist but it is.  I wonder if your so-called black friends know about your feelings of them and their children's names.  You also say that you "feel bad for some kids that get these names" and that they will have problems finding a job.  Maybe you should look a little closer and brush up on your own grammar and diction.  What kind of job do you have; for example?|`|yhfG07Jtaa	You made up most of those names. And people can change their names if they want to. There are plenty of professional black people with African-American sounding names. Condoleeza Rice is an example.<br>  You are racist, this is a racist question, it is trying to find laughs at the expense of ordinary people.<br>  Like nobody thinks Bristol Palin or Moon Unit Zappa would be hard names to live with.

RB0ICpJCaa	Sounds like you are curious. The fact you can't get this girl out of your head shows you are interested in her. Or you find her attractive. I think the best thing for you to do, is some how get a hold of her and ask her some questions. Best way for you to figure out your sexuality is to talk to someone who has already gone threw it.|`|eGvyFeW9aa	Well.. why don't you just go for her? You never know until you try. Experimenting will show you. [=|`|MufqgZzGaa	yes, you are a homosexual lesbo gay|`|85XxzOF8aa	Well i think you should talk to her, tell her how you feel what more could she say. maybe if you like her so much this could be the beginning of something new. i know yu dnt kno for sure but atleast give it a try

mP6ox5f3aa	I was eight when WW2 broke out. My father went into the Royal Navy and my mother went on to munitions, working shifts. I had to look after myself and my younger sister. Getting the meals, fetching the rations with the ration book and climbing over the railings of the wharf where the waggons frequently dropped coal which I would pinch and throw over the railings to take back home which would eek out the coal ration. One day I got a pointed rail through my hand, it was bad but it didn't stop me! We children had to go everywhere with a gas mask in  cardboard box tied around our shoulders with string. We became very self reliant. not like the wimps of today!<br>  Can you remember the round luminous badges that we wore on our lapels? so that we could see each other in the blackout?<br>  Can you remember the Post Office Telegramme Boy on his red bicycle taking telegrams to the home of some soldier, sailor or airman who had been killed?

RLQPWkXCaa	Malaysian. People have said it's the easiest language in the world to learn. It's definitely easier than Chinese or Japanese, and more exotic than most anything out there. <br>  <br>  It doesn't have gender, plurals, verb conjugations; it uses the Roman alphabet, it has a number of loan words from Dutch and English that you would mostly recognize. <br>  <br>  Malaysia is one of the NIEs -- countries whose economies are doing really well. It has a military alliance with the US, so it could help you get a job, though it depends on what you're looking for. <br>  <br>  It's also very close to Indonesian, so learning it would help if you wanted to travel to Southeast Asia. I personally think it sounds cool -- kind of like Spanish, but more exotic.<br>  <br>  If you want something more complex, you could try Thai or Hindi.|`|dqL0PB1Haa	Chinese is very difficult to learn.

It branches off into Italian, French, Spanish, and Rumanian; not to mention that English is half based on it. (The other half is German.)<br>  <br>  It's easy to learn in the sense of the words themselves, but the grammar and word placement is a bit harder to learn. No one talks it anymore; it's dead, but it helps out with so many other language fields, and it's wonderful if you're looking to be a doctor or lawyer.

In fact the “new world” had not even been discovered. What race Christ was we can not know for sure since the bible rarely gives any description of Christ. However it’s very doubtfully that he was white despite that is often how he is portrayed. Jesus was from the Middle East he lived there and that is where he was born thus he was probably tannish what some might call olive skinned to even a light brown.  We also know that Christ had to be identified by Judas via  a kiss on the check. So by that we can determine that there was nothing that made Christ stand out from other middle easterns in that area.|`|JaTjoLNlaa	yes, he lived in nyc before he went there. he spent his time bumming around, and thought he could make a difference. so he left nyc, walked across the atlantic ocean to the middle east, and got himself crucified around 26 A.D. he lived in an apartment in brooklyn..|`|rThIVk2maa	It is recorded that he was a Jew from the Middle East.

8IHfytEvaa	Don't forget 1 Timothy 4:1-4<br>  <br>   1The Spirit clearly says that in later times some will abandon the faith and follow deceiving spirits and things taught by demons. 2Such teachings come through hypocritical liars, whose consciences have been seared as with a hot iron. 3They forbid people to marry and order them to abstain from certain foods, which God created to be received with thanksgiving by those who believe and who know the truth. 4For everything God created is good, and nothing is to be rejected if it is received with thanksgiving,|`|Bq0gqw7qaa	Matthew 18 16-18  The Church has been empowered by Christ with the authority to bind and loose on earth. Catholics are not "sola scripturists". It does bring up an interesting point; Can Protestant churches legitimately have preachers that are unmarried or without children? Theoretically they should be bound to these parameters, come to think of it they should be bound to Matthew 18 16-18<br>  <br>  EDIT; Just a point of interest in my archdiocese we have a fully ordained preist who is married.

But one wonders why, since the Bible clearly teaches that this is a very good thing.<br>  <br>  Matthew 19:12: "For there are eunuchs who have been so from birth, and there are eunuchs who have been made eunuchs by men, and there are eunuchs who have made themselves eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom of heaven. he who is able to receive this, let him receive it."<br>  <br>  1 Corinthians 7:7-9 "I wish that all were as I myself am. But each has his own special gift form God, one of one kind and one of another. To the unmarried and the widows I say that it is will for them to remain single as I do. But if they cannot exercise self-control, they should marry. for it is better to marry than to be aflame with passion."<br>  <br>  1 Corinthians 7:32-35, 38: "The unmarried man is anxious about the affairs of the Lord, how to please the Lord; but the married man is anxious about worldly affairs, how to pleasse his wife, and his interests are divided. And the unmarried woman or girl is anxious about the affairs of the Lord, how to be holy in body and spirit; but the married woman is anxious about worldly affairs, how to please her husband. I say this for your own benefit, not to lay any restraint upon you, but to promote good order and to secure your undivided devotion to the Lord...So that he who marries...does well; and he who refrains from marriage will do better."<br>  <br>  The Western or Latin Rite of the Catholic Church draws its priests from among those men who have felt called by God to give "undivided devotion to the Lord." This cannot be "unnatural" because it is a gift and calling from God, and it is not anti-biblical, because it follows Paul's own instructions! <br>  <br>  Every institution has the right to make whatever rules it deems necessary in order for it to fulfill its purpose. Most people are called to marriage; some few are called  to be celibate. The Catholic Church doesn't hinder God or any individual in the least, but rather, cooperates with God's own will for each man.<br>  <br>  There is reason to believe that the married apostles renounced their married state, for precisely the reaons that Jesus and Paul pointed out.<br>  <br>  The disciples indeed had a right to get married, but they renounced it. Paul did exactly the same thing regarding remuneration for missionary work, for the sake of the gospel. This is perfectly harmonious with the Catholic position. Jesus Himself taught that a person might even leave his wife (by mutual consent) and everything else, in order to be a profoundly committed disciple:<br>  <br>  Luke 18:29-30: "There is no man who has left house or wife or brothers or parents or children, for the sake of the kingdom of God, who will not receive manifold more in this time, and in the age to come eternal life."<br>  <br>  Matthew 19:27-29: "Then Peter said in reply, 'Lo, we have left everything and followed You. What then shall we have?' Jesus said to them, '...every one who has left houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or children or lands, for my name's sake, will receive a hundredfold, and inherit eternal life." <br>  <br>  It's quite possible that St. Peter separated from his wife in this way; the Bible never mentions his wife traveling with jesus and the disciples at all, even though it mentions many other women (several by name) who encouraged the disciples, and who helped support them financially. Evne those Eastern Catholic and Orthodox priests who are married regularly abstain from relations with their wives for long periods, for various liturgical or penitential reasons. The Bible clearly supports this practice, too (1 Corinthians 7:5). <br>  <br>  Priests remain celebate in order that they may be completely devoted to God.|`|bxxwhP04aa	The RCC has MANY laws and rules and regulations which are entirely man made, and NOT of the Biblical God.|`|wuPTBIIuaa	incorrect. bishop and overseer might be the same office but bishop and priest are not the same <br>  <br>  and the words this translation use are not the same as other translations use. <br>  <br>  adding the word: "but" <br>  implies a man cannot be a bishop without a wife, and adds the idea is restricted to having ONLY one wife. <br>  <br>  this is NONsense and clearly a "tampered" verse, altered by history and tradition.<br>  <br>  first: if jesus was never married how can he be a high priest if he was not a bishop! how can jesus be a leader of the church under this same verse requirements, if he never had a family to know how to rule the church if he did not know how to rule his family in righteousness. ? see vs4<br>  <br>  no jesus was married. ! otherwise he would not have fulfilled ALL righteousness when he was baptized by john the baptist. <br>  <br>  i like another verse which says: (Paraphrased) it is the doctrines of devils to forbid to marry and to abstain from meat...|`|AA10014750	1. Wisdom 3:14. (Catholic scriptures).<br>  2. The 'church' may be his bride, dso he dedicated to her.|`|evStsOQiaa	God is asking the same question.|`|51fe01ef6db0c1bd743afcb3e7a2e1ffaa	Baloney.<br>  <br>  But even in the Old Testament some of the prophets, like Elijah and Jeremiah, chose celibacy. By Jesus' time the great rabbis spoke of the possibility of "marrying Torah," that is, dedicating their whole life to the study of the Word. Paul was one who did, both before and after his conversion. Jesus is, of course, THE WORD, and infinitely more deserving of total dedication than the written word.<br>  <br>  It should not be surprising, therefore, that Jesus should speak of some who would remain celibate ("eunuchs") for the sake of the Kingdom of God (Mt 19:12). St. Paul not only continued his pre-conversion celibacy as a Christian but recommended it for those who would be dedicated to serving God in this world (1 Cor. 7:7, 17, 32-35). He was speaking to a general audience and so he does not oblige it. But observe what he says in verse 17, "Only, everyone should live as the Lord has assigned, just as God called each one. I give this order in all the churches." This coincides with the admonition of Jesus to follow the vocation given by God, whether celibacy (Mt 19:12) or marriage (v.11).<br>  <br>  Now Jesus said that if one could accept celibacy for the sake of the Kingdom one should and Paul says it is the best way for those dedicated to the Kingdom, and BOTH of them lived this total dedication to the will of the Father for the salvation of souls.<br>  <br>  Although Latin Rite Catholic priests for the last 1000 years have had to be celibate, Eastern Rite Catholic priests and priests of the Orthodox Churches (not in union with Rome) do not. However, ALL bishops in both the Catholic and Orthodox Churches MUST be celibates. They represent Christ to the people in their dioceses and Christ's bride is the Church (Eph 5:21-33) not someone else. So, it is entirely fitting that bishops not marry EVER and that priests not marry either, though in some traditions it is allowed PRIOR to ordination.<br>  <br>  . It is a total gift of self to the Lord, fitting for those whose vocation is dedicated to love and service of God and neighbor. Unfortunately, it is something the worldly who do not understand the power of God have difficulty accepting, then as now.|`|AA10034051	The tradition of single priests is Canon law, not a dogma, which means it is not set in stone, and could change. The married priesthood is not unbiblical per se (i.e., Peter was married), but their is much scriptural and historical evidence supporting celibate priests. One thing is for sure. A family man has to put his family first, not the Church. That leads into a huge dilemma if he is a pastor.A priest puts God and the church first.<br>  Scripture fairly consistently awards celibacy a higher spiritual calling than marriage. <br>  <br>  ...it is well for them to remain unmarried as I am...it is well for you to remain as you are...do not seek a wife...he who refrains from marriage will do better...(I Cor., 7-8 and 32-38) <br>  <br>  Paul says that celibacy provides "unhindered devotion to the Lord. " (1 cor 7:35) Jesus tells us "it is better not to marry...let anyone accept this who can." (Mat 19:10-12)<br>  <br>  <br>  In Jewish law the priesthood was passed on by blood relation and marriage was therefore necessary, but even so, Jewish priests of the Old Testament were required to abstain from sex during the periods when they were serving in the Temple for spiritual reasons. Catholic priests serve in the Temple every day. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Scripture verses valuing celibacy:<br>  Matthew 19:10-12<br>  ...his disciples said to him, "If such is the case of a man with his wife, it is better not to marry." But he said to them, "Not everyone can accept this teaching, but only those to whom it is given. For there are eunuchs who have been so from birth, and there are eunuchs who have been made eunuchs by others, and there are eunuchs who have made themselves eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom of heaven. Let anyone accept this who can."<br>  <br>  1 Cor 7:6-9<br>  ...This I say by way of concession, not of command. I wish that all were as I myself am. But each has a particular gift from God, one having one kind and another a different kind. To the unmarried and the widows I say that it is well for them to remain unmarried as I am. But if they are not practicing self-control, they should marry. For it is better to marry than to be aflame with passion. <br>  <br>  1 Cor 7:24-35<br>  ...In whatever condition you were called, brothers and sisters, there remain with God. Now concerning virgins, I have no command of the Lord, but I give my opinion as one who by the Lord's mercy is trustworthy. I think that, in view of the impending crisis, it is well for you to remain as you are. Are you bound to a wife? Do not seek to be free. Are you free from a wife? Do not seek a wife... Yet those who marry will experience distress in this life, and I would spare you that. I mean, brothers and sisters, the appointed time has grown short; from now on, let even those who have wives be as though they had none, but the married man is anxious about the affairs of the world, how to please his wife, and his interests are divided. And the unmarried woman and the virgin are anxious about the affairs of the Lord, so that they may be holy in body and spirit; but the married woman is anxious about the affairs of the world, how to please her husband. I say this for your own benefit, not to put any restraint upon you, but to promote good order and unhindered devotion to the Lord. <br>  <br>  1 Cor 7:38-40<br>  ...So then, he who marries his fiancée does well; and he who refrains from marriage will do better. A wife is bound as long as her husband lives. But if the husband dies, she is free to marry anyone she wishes, only in the Lord. But in my judgment she is more blessed if she remains as she is.<br>  <br>  <br>  Catholic Christian

mr0Hb5fvaa	this is a really weird passage, i don't really understand what is going on. the only thing i can think of is maybe it wasn't moses, but moses' son, because he wasn't circumcised. either that or it may be referring to pharaoh.  ?|`|0aJlEmIxaa	God was going to kill Moses because of sin. The sin of Moses in Exodus 4:24-26 is not stated explicitly, but the surrounding events give substantial clues as to the nature of Moses’ transgression. God had instructed his messenger to warn Pharaoh to free Israel, or risk losing his firstborn son (Exodus 4:21-24). Moses had been specially groomed by God for eighty years for this mission, and now the time for action had come.<br>  <br>  Moses was to lead his people out of Egypt and to be an example to Pharaoh’s house, to the nation of Egypt, and to all the nations that heard of those happenings (Exodus 18:10-11; Joshua 2:10-11). Accordingly, Moses’ personal life had to be in order before he could direct the spiritual lives of the Hebrew people. It seems that Moses had neglected to administer the sacred rite of circumcision, the act that symbolized the Almighty’s covenant with His chosen people.<br>  <br>  Perhaps this was the result of pressure from his surrogate Midianite tribe. It is also possible that he was persuaded by Zipporah not to circumcise his son, since she apparently found the practice revolting (4:25). This would explain her violent outburst; she felt that she had saved her husband from death by shedding the blood of her son. Whatever the cause, Moses’ outstanding sin made him unfit to serve as a spiritual leader, and the situation had to be rectified before he could carry out his mission effectively. Indeed, as soon as Zipporah performed the act, the Lord “let him go.” In summary, God was going to kill Moses because Moses was supposed to teach the Israelites God's Law, yet Moses was not obeying God's Law himself.|`|8etlLo7Zaa	It wasn't a chance encounter, God is omnipresent (all-present) everywhere at once. Look at Exodus 4: 21-23 first. God gave Moses a mission, to go back to Egypt and perform the miracles in front of the Pharaoh. Moses never circumcised one of his sons, which was an insult to the LORD. how could God trust him to free all the Israelites if he couldn't even take care of his own son?<br>  <br>  here's the passages you need from the Amplified Version of The Bible, it explains it to you.<br>  <br>  Exodus 4:24-25<br>  "Along the way at a [resting-] place, the Lord met [Moses] and sought to kill him [made him acutely and almost fatally ill]. [Now apparently he had failed to circumcise one of his sons, his wife being opposed to it; but seeing his life in such danger] Zipporah (his wife) took a flint knife and cut off the foreskin of her son and cast it to touch [Moses'] feet, and said, Surely a husband of blood you are to me!"<br>  <br>  *He who is on his way to liberate the people of the circumcision has in Midian even neglected to circumcise his second son Eliezer.

Being a witness of something you weren't there for does seem silly. But being a Christian myself, I don't claim to have witnessed Jesus actually dying on the cross or rising from the dead, I only claim to witness His impact in my own life. I am a witness of how he changed me from who I used to be. Not that I'm perfect now or don't experience trouble, cause as long as sin is in the world people are going to experience its consequences, but yea, all I'm a witness of is what I've actually seen and experienced. sorry if Christians have annoyed you, just know it's really not our intention.

We are living our faith and part of that is to share it with the world, to "Witness" to the world. <br>  <br>  We are to BE the hands of Christ in the world by helping and caring for our brothers and sisters.

There is no way we could afford to build a ship to go there if it were even possible. I figure it like this. The vast distances involved are intentional in order to keep God's creation separate.

I'm also fairly certain that if we encountered another space faring being that they would be doing so for exploratory purposes only and to not make war.

Knowledge is nothing to fear; it's what you DO with it that matters.<br>  <br>  And you're too young to declare yourself an atheist. Fourteen is too young to know yourself and your beliefs.|`|4SGBr8cWaa	yes, taking into account your viewpoint on killers & suffering i feel that some or any religious study might be of benefit to you|`|cXXJVz64aa	There's nothing wrong with studying religion, as long as you don't fall for their ideals.|`|AA11952133	Are you interested in the bible, or are you just interested in people?  I ask because if you are interested in learning what the bible has to offer, you can go to the website listed and ask for a free copy of "What does the Bible Really Teach."<br>  <br>  Just one suggestion...|`|MqLxwsw7aa	Of course it is.<br>  <br>  However, don't be fooled by the religions with respect to any of the things that require you to have 'belief', 'faith', 'prayers', 'hopes', etc.  They don't work!  Even as young as you are, your INNATE will guide you to the truth if you will pay attention to it.<br>  <br>  God REQUIRES that you KNOW that He is God - not 'believe'.|`|Ba5PVgHMaa	Its a great thing to study religion, your old enough to make your own decisions about what to beleive. Even if you decide to still be an athiest, its always good to understand why you dont beleive.|`|26414b2f3237391dde0fd3b0221fcffcaa	Yes, I'd think so. You need to understand religions, in order to have a better opinion about them, I think.

baW9sSsLaa	There is no separate realm for "good" spirits and "bad" spirits--they exist in the same realm.  <br>  <br>  Using a Ouija board is a bit like opening all of your doors, and then advertising that you're going out of town for a couple of days.  Some of those who stop by may indeed be well-intentioned, or merely curious, but the majority are the sort of people you wouldn't want to be around.<br>  <br>  Unless you are well versed in protective or abjuration magic, using such an open method of contact is just asking for trouble.|`|2PZnXjZ7aa	I think it's more of a subconcious thing. Like, your mind is moving it to where you want it to be. Of course, I've never tried one myself. Hey, they sell them at Toys-R-Us! How bad can they be?|`|UMa3jvRHaa	Well some people say they are real others say they aren't. <br>  it all depends on how you see it.<br>  They they say they open doors to other world because evil spirits try to contact you using the board so they can get out.<br>  you don't always contact an evil spirit though. The bord will give you signs you have contacted one. (ex. if the pancheta moves in a figure 8 around the board you have contacted an evil spirit)<br>  The biggest danger in using one is letting the spirit out because once you have contacted it you have invited it in.<br>  <br>  i personally belive in it, but most people think it's fake and riged.|`|9OOTeQLYaa	when they say it opens doors to demons because the ouija is only for the people that didn't make it to heaven, you think God would let his angels talk to you through the ouija? No of course not! he would send them to tell you, now ir opens doors because you shouldn't know the future just like getting your palms read, just be careful if you want to try it ok|`|49c1ed9541d154d45ed38796a9a07ec3aa	ive done it ,,its real ,there are good and bad spirits ,,its highly addictive as you can imagine whoever you contact could just be bored and wanna frighten you i know if i was dead i would ,,best keep away though i slept with light on and door open for years after wards|`|c05702374b5bc85f3a1502d55060a46eaa	Ouija board is toy, not dangerous, silly tales wrong, demon world not exist, good and bad spirits not exist. My lover's mother and brother use Ouija board, get bad answers, not dangerous, unless believe nonsense.
0rpN2419aa	Knowing what I do now, is the key to that question.  It's too bad we didn't listen to our parents and grandparents, because they had lived longer they knew what was ahead of us in the decisions we made.  <br>  I like camping so much and being in the outdoors, I might have thought of forestry as in a park ranger so I could be outside in my job.<br>  My second job would have been a teacher because I enjoy working with children.  I taught reading as an instructional assistant and the pay was less than a third that the teacher made.<br>  We didn't have the money to go to college.|`|UllYFJgjaa	I would get my degree in Music and teach Music Appreciation in school to ages anywhere between 11 years old to Seniors in High School.

I guess an education that would qualify me to be a wildlife biologist and a better education in animal husbandry would make me happier if that is indeed possible. Better training in the basic skills would sure be nice.|`|8G42oyydaa	I would be a Doctor, work with burn victims. Something I wanted to do since I was a child and never had the money for.  All I managed was 4 years of college while working full time from 4:00 to midnight 5 days a week. :-(  <br>  <br>  In Canada you cant get student loans, or couldnt then if your parents were able to pay for your education, if they were willing to was never a consideration in the determination of eligibility|`|GrKiEDb1aa	I'd still join the U.S. Navy and experience all I did.  I would fly my wife to some of the different ports I visited so she could enjoy what I did.  I've been stationed in 3 countries and visited over 30 (some more than once).  I was on 5 ships, sailed 8 oceans/seas, on 6 of th 7 continents (not Australia), and spent 13 months in Antarctica.  I still keep in loose contact with 3 people I met in my travels.  One was an Israeli soldier I met in 1985.  We wrote frequently until around 1999.  A few years later I got a letter from his sister who found my letters among his things.  He had been killed in a skirmish in 1999.<br>  So, I'd do it all over again...and have the money to add to the things I did.|`|5qFmukWwaa	I would be a photojournalist and travel the world.|`|LQ52bOFFaa	An archaeologist.  I love history and read everything I can find about archeology.  College was not an option for me.  It never even occurred to my brothers or me.  There was no money.  Both brothers became carpenters like my dad.  I was a waitress.  One brother later became a very successful salesman.  I went to night school and went to work in the grocery industry.  We all had success in one way or another, but an education would have been wonderful.|`|Dmaahsc3aa	Looks like I am just like everyone else. . . education !!!   We were poor too, and no government loans back then. . . my biggest problem would have been the choice on what to take in college !  I love history, art, animals, human behavior, music appreciation, doing research, mathematics, literature, archeology, oceanography. . wow, at this rate I would still be in school today !!  I do know one thing. . . I sure would have bought stock in the little unknown companies like Microsoft. . Google . . etc.  LOL  Oh to be so lucky !!!|`|LuIFkPfwaa	Shoot if I had all the money I needed??  I always wanted to have a farm/ranch.  I still do.  <br>  <br>  Now, as a second I was going to school to be an accountant.  When I took the required law course I found I really loved the law.  So I would get an accounting degree with a minor in law, then go on to law school.  I could either be a lawyer (like a tax attorney), or a CPA.  Both degrees would benefit both those careers.|`|RWgjnwl9aa	Oh a Veterinarian hands down! I would study all the medical courses & put my heart & soul in it then in time I'd have my own Veterinary Clinic & just love going to work to be honest I love my animals' more than some people I know lol|`|ozwLZwXeaa	My dream was to be a registered nurse.

Oh, boy.<br>  <br>  I'd be a reconstructive surgeon, and I would certainly not waste any time on persons like my ex-husband.  In fact, I probably wouldn't marry at all.|`|cdWbQwWGaa	I would go directly to college and not stop until I got my PhD
AA11403032	Which god do you mean?<br>  <br>  I don't believe in any of them...Jehovah, Jahweh, Allah, Vishnu, Thor, Odin, Mars, Zeus, the flying spaghetti monster.....none of them.<br>  <br>  Reason:  Because there is not, and has never been, a single shred of evidence to suggest their existence is real, and further many of the supernatural claims made regarding these gods are demonstrably false.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Can you believe that some idiots think the bible is proof of the existence of a god?<br>  If that is so, then the Mr Men series of books proves that Mr Tickle is real.|`|2059629ba703ea51b813a449b0cb4431aa	No. I require actual verifiable evidence for things before I find myself believing in them. Particularly for supernatural super-beings who can create universes on a whim.|`|evStsOQiaa	Yes I believe in the God Yahweh because science can now prove His existence through mistranslated scripture in the first five books of The Bible.|`|R0mZqqfXaa	I don't believe in God. Those who do believe need something to validate their existence, I do not.|`|HRUkmBBxaa	i do <br>  a lot of reasons including the earth, the creatures, miracles and the love  he has shown me throughout out|`|sJegUB11aa	I don't.<br>  <br>  Simply put, the concept of God (or any god) seems quite unreal to me; it doesn't fit into reality.|`|50UbJp14aa	I do|`|Cbom3Lweaa	I don't know. This world is a very uncertain place|`|mj52nmKtaa	I believe God is energy. Everything that surrounds us. I don't believe he's a man or a woman up there watching everyone. It takes a tremendous amount of energy to create mass. So what would we call the energy that would be large enough, powerful enough and pervasive enough to create the solar system, the planets, the stars, the sun, you, me and everything on earth…could it be God?|`|yvmvrpaYaa	No, because there is no evidence that he exists and because all the things that he purportedly created have had the processes of their formation elucidated. Without these, why would we think he exists? What about all the other gods that have been worshipped through time? Should we believe in them as well? Why do people choose not to believe in all of those gods yet believe in just one?|`|0cf7e13d54e541838eb884911dd10263aa	God is real, very real. We listen to him every single day in the words of preachers CBS participants, etc. collecting money in exchange for salvation and approval. <br>  God has absolutely nothing to do with my life, he is a man-made thing, designed to instill fear in people's hearts.<br>  God has never answered my prayers. I believe that if you look inside yourself you would find that he has never answered yours either.<br>  God is for people who need someone to guide them. He is for the weak and the helpless. He is for people who are broken by the loss of a family member or job.<br>  God is a cruel being who watches people get beaten to death and starved just to see if WE will do anything about it. God is impartial to children and other beings. <br>  If there IS a God, I want nothing to do with him. He is playing a game with our lives.|`|xi19aSjvaa	You bet I do. Look around you at what all God has created. Think about how the earth and the universe could have possibly been created without God. It wouldn't have happened. Also how God has changed not only my life, but other Christian's lives as well.|`|dAt612NLaa	I don't. throughout history everyone has believed in so many gods. So what does that tell you about present day god?he is as real as all the others. Some  people just need to believe that things happen for a reason and someone is watching over them to feel safe!|`|Cld0jeiXaa	No, I'm a very strong Atheist. Once we give up the crutch of Religion (all religion) our society will truely begin to prosper.<br>  In response to Madi L<br>  "I do because I believe in all my heart. He created us! He loves us!<br>  Why not believe in him?? Atheist can only say no ...They have NO reason They are afraid that God might ruin their perfect lifes! WRONG!"<br>  <br>  I have many reasons to be a "Non believer", first and foremost I don't need a God. My moral compass is fine, I like all people have made mistakes and will continue to. Religion is on the forefront of every war and of every money grubbing hoard. Religion in every form is a chain and a crutch. It allows individuals to persecute each other to wage war and to burn one another at the stake. Life is this world! It's all we have so make the best of it, find love, feed someone that might not eat, and do the right thing for our world.|`|yrBY9M2paa	NO, just look at all the wars and terrorism that are down to religion, and you can't blame god because there isn't one so it is down to religious people been mad. any one practising any form of religion should be executed|`|aSs0tfjUaa	No, I an am atheist. <br>  <br>  My reasons;<br>  <br>  1) There is no scientific evidence.<br>  <br>  2) No physical evidence.<br>  <br>  3) If there was an almighty being ensuring the good of all why would we have such personal and World wide tragedies.<br>  <br>  4) Logic and common sense.|`|rpjnAhIIaa	Please take  stantonlogan's  answer  it is definitely most logical thought about the wonder of everything in this world, that you see with your own eyes.   stantonlogan  dude,   Amazing answer man!  thumbs up.|`|SWOeg0jFaa	I just don't because I don't.<br>  Seems logical to me and God seems illogical.|`|Jgoylfvqaa	I do because I belive in all my heart.<br>  He created us!<br>  He loves uus!<br>  Why not believe in him??<br>  Atheist can only say no ...They have NO reason<br>  They are afraid that God might ruin their perfect lifes!

That is not how real people are made(yes, I know where babies come from). <br>  And who really wrote the Bible. No one knows. It could have been some schizophrenic, sitting in a tent, hearing voices in his head, thinking those voices to be a holy being, and writing a book about the voices.|`|hR7OsqtRaa	Who created Humans.? People may say The Big Bang. Then Who Created the Big Bang.? Particles ? Who created the particles ? I can keep going on and on.<br>  Answer : Humans are not real since there is no evidence of their evolution.<br>  Would you accept the above argument. ?<br>  If I tell you Who Created God, then you would say Who created the one who created God and it would go on and on.<br>  We know God is real, since we are real. If you deny God, then you have to deny your own existence, which is impossible. No matter how knowledgable or intelligent you are, you cannot deny that there has to be a supernatural force that has created our planet and our body and, that creator is God.<br>  <br>  The Bible was written by approximately 40 men of diverse backgrounds over the course of 4000 years. Despite being penned by different authors over 40 centuries, the Bible does not contradict itself and does not contain any errors. The authors all present different perspectives, but they all proclaim the same one true God, and the same one way of salvation—Jesus Christ (John 14:6; Acts 4:12).<br>  <br>  In John 8:58 "I tell you the truth," Jesus answered, "before Abraham was born, I am!"<br>  <br>  The above verse speaks a lot about who Jesus really is.<br>  <br>  All about Jesus and the Holy Trinity explained in the below website.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com</a><br>  <br>  Lots of videos, sermons, songs are also present, along with all of Jesus miracles, his parables, and questions on his birth, crucifixion, resurrection are answered.<br>  <br>  Many major questions on Christianity are answered with lot of examples that cannot be denied by anyone, such as,<br>  <br>  1) Did Jesus really exist? Is He God? Why did He suffer on the Cross?<br>  2) What is so special about Jesus? Why cant I just view him as an ordinary man or a teacher or a prophet? Why should I see him as God?<br>  <br>  Pasting a small part from the website.<br>  Visit the website to strengthen your faith in Jesus or to know more about Him.<br>  <br>  Jesus is God.<br>  <br>  1.Thomas calls Jesus God in John 20:28 (Note, Thomas addresses Jesus<br>  specifically.)<br>  2. Jesus is God in Heb. 1:8<br>  3. John the apostle states that Jesus was the Word which was God that became<br>  flesh (John 1:1-14)<br>  4. The phrase "Call upon the name of the LORD" (Hebrew, YHWH, i.e., Psalm<br>  116:4) used only of God on the OT, and translated into the Greek in the LXX as "Call upon the name of the LORD (greek, KURIOS)," applied to Jesus in the NT (1 Cor. 1:2) Jesus is God in flesh<br>  5. The apostle John says that Jesus was , "...calling God His own Father,<br>  making Himself equal to God," (John 5:18)<br>  6. Jesus said that He and the Father are One (John 10:30), that caused the Pharisees to<br>  claim that Jesus was making Himself out to be God.<br>  7. Jesus knew all things (John 21:17)<br>  8. Jesus knew all men (John 16:30)<br>  9. Jesus is everywhere (Matt. 28:20)<br>  10. Jesus Christ, dwells in you (Col. 1:27)<br>  11. Jesus is the exact representation of the Nature of God (Heb. 1:3)<br>  12. Jesus is eternal (Micah 5:1-2)<br>  13. Jesus gives eternal life (John 10:27-28)<br>  14. Jesus is our only Lord and Master (Jude 4)<br>  15. Jesus is called the Mighty God (Isaiah 9:6)<br>  16.

Jesus created all things (Col. 1:16-17), it is God who created all things by Himself (Isaiah 44:24)<br>  19. Jesus searches the hearts and minds of the people (Rev. 2:23)<br>  20. Jesus is worshiped (Matt. 2:2-11; Matt.14:33; Matt.28:9; John 9:35-38;<br>  Heb. 1:6) Only God can be worshipped (Matt. 4:10) (same Greek word for worship<br>  is used in each place.)<br>  21. In the OT God was seen (Exodus 6:2-3;Exodus 24:9-11; Num. 12:6-9; Acts7:2), yet no man can see God (Exodus 33:20; John 1:18). It was not the Father that was seen in the OT (John 6:46). Who, then were they seeing? See John 8:58.<br>  22. Jesus claimed the divine name, "I AM", for Himself in John 8:58 see<br>  Exodus 3:14.<br>  23. Jesus says you must honor him even as you honor the Father (John 5:23).<br>  24. Jesus gives life (John 5:21).<br>  25. Jesus bears witness of Himself (John 8:18;John 14:6).<br>  26.

God isn't. Struggle to discover why this is so.|`|HFlytHlRaa	Most of the changes in religion occurred during the Enlightenment era, following the history of what happened may shed some light on the changes.<br>  <br>  As you've stated, Catholics used to require penance, usually given in the form of money. There was the idea of the Ladder of Virtues, back then. Where if you commit a sin - you fall off the Ladder of Virtues, you pay penance and your sin is forgiven. The goal is to climb the Ladder to reach Christ. (Aquinas believed this as well.)<br>  <br>  Martin Luther, however, rejected this idea. He believed that giving penance and climbing the Ladder of Virtues was a never ending cycle. How would he know when he's reached the top and when he's done all he can to get there?<br>  His thoughts were that people would over-exert themselves and drive themselves into chaos (think Berger's idea of the nomos and theodicies) and believed in the idea of Sola Fide, "Faith Only" and taught his beliefs from the Bible and only the Bible.<br>  He believed that one was stained with the Original Sin (Garden of Eden, Adam and Eve) and no amount of penance would replace it. Instead, one should simply believe in God's promise and they would receive His grace.<br>  <br>  Zwingli also countered the Church and believed no penance, sacraments etc. were of any worth past human symbols and wanted to entirely remove idolatry.<br>  <br>  This continues for some time with several philosophers; even Thomas Jefferson and John Locke weighed in.<br>  Most people sided with Luther, Calvin or Zwingli. Thomas Jefferson added reason to the equation. <br>  <br>  This idea that penance should be removed was also widely accepted because during this time there was mass amounts of famine and starvation. The money being given to the Church, some people felt, should be spent on other manners so as long as the people believed.<br>  <br>  As you see, like with the idea of the Earth being flat, ideas and perceptions changed over time through repeated analysis of the Bible. <br>  <br>  One of the primary reasons of the change in religion is that, prior, the Bible was only printed in Latin. Most people couldn't read Latin so the Church had full control of what was believed and the people simply took their word. Afterwords, Luther insisted on the Bible being translated (the Church opposed) and that people follow the Bible's teachings not theirs. <br>  <br>  This lead to a different perception of religion alongside of the reasoning of the Enlightenment thinkers.<br>  <br>  <br>  ---<br>  I'm sorry for the novel, I'm a huge theology buff. I think it's all fascinating|`|F5bT2wAraa	That is nice that you believe in God.  True religion is the loving relationship between the minute spirit (you and I) and the supreme spirit (God).  Love takes two and they are both happy in it.  This relationship is eternal, is based on love and devotional service to the supreme and does not change with time.  However, God is not a void energy who does not move.  He moves and He does have His pass times.  That is why it is said that you can know God by 3 methods combined. 1- Lord in your heart  2- Scripture  3- A qualified LIVING spiritual master.  It is also said the the most difficult of all will be to find the qualified spiritual master.

The bible says He stays the same. And what Jesus said "I am the Way, the Truth, and the Life" "No one comes to the Father but by me" doesn't change. The fact that the bible says we can't get to heaven by being good enough (since everyone sins) - only through trusting in Jesus salvation through His death on the cross and resurrection - doesn't change - even if religions make up another "way to get to heaven". We need to keep testing things against what the bible says to see if it is true, eh?

The Church in no way fears anything that science may reveal. Truth cannot contradict truth.  Anything that science reveals only further manifests the wondrous magnificence of God.  <br>  <br>  When will people like you realize that science is a means to an end, not an end in itself.  Christ is the alpha and the omega.  When will YOU embrace the reality that God IS?  When will YOU look at the evidence FOR God's existence and realize that only a fool could ignore such overwhelming evidence.  <br>  <br>  Have YOU ever studied the Catechism of the Catholic Church?  I'm going to go out on a limb and guess that you have NEVER opened it's cover.  You worship, and embrace the lies of materialism.  You think that science will disprove God.  You are embarked on a journey that has no end.

I was especially turned off this week when Rush Limbaugh said that he hoped Obama's financial plans fail. To hope that our president fails at anything is very disrespectful. If our president fails we all fail including Rush. I am so tired of the black e-mails. Everyone conveniently forgets that President Obama is half white. If ever our country needed to pull together and make things work it is now. Putting down everything the president is trying to do is so petty. It's so easy to say that something is not going to work but does anyone come up with a better plan that will work? I am just so sick of all the bashing. I would have so much more respect for people if they would do something constructive instead of bashing those who are at least trying to do something.|`|e9YFTyzZaa	Yes, I am tired of it.<br>  No, I don't think it's only the Media...I'm talking 'Regular News'...Yes, I do think it's people like Rush Limbaugh, Sean Hannity & FOX News.<br>  BUT, surprisingly the "Buzz" sections at the end of Articles (Yahoo News) display such "HATRED" of President Obama.

He has also created some controversy by his own actions.....such a tax increase of 61 cents for tobacco. You may say good...but he campaigned on no tax increase and then hits the middle and lower class with this substantial increase. Watch out seniors......a reduction in SS and Medicare is on it's way. This will be used to help fund a national healthcare for all. Again the middle and lower class, especially the elderly that depend on SS and Medicare will be hit again.

TJAdzZOEaa	As organisms, our only responsibility is to ensure the continuation of our species regardless of the cost.  That said, humans can be very brilliant and kind when they choose to be and I would argue that we're smart enough for more than simple survival.<br>  It seems to me that much of the harm caused by the human race is through a combination of simple neglect and apathy, and I would say that our duties are every bit as easy to outline as our flaws are:<br>  Firstly, we need to protect our environment. We've conquered most illness, developed technology that allows us to live in even the harshest environs year-round without risk, and turned the most ferocious animals on the globe into zoo exhibits that our children can laugh at without feeling an ounce of fear.  We've divorced ourselves from the natural way.  Its effect on us is minimal, but still we alter it in the most profound ways, leaving a handful of environmentalists and conservationists struggling to repair the damage.<br>  Secondly, I feel that we have a duty to help one another live the happiest lives possible.  Internal conflicts (loneliness, ignorance) can often be solved by something as simple as companionship, and external conflicts (starvation, vagrancy) are usually rooted in greed.  We all deserve to be happy, but if one person's salary is large enough for seven families, then there are six families somewhere who are paying for the disparity.<br>  To me, a dutiful life encompasses nothing more than minimizing harm to the planet and remembering that you aren't any more entitled to an enjoyable life than the person living across the street.  Or, more likely, the one living across town.|`|D4rXVLMuaa	With FAITH THE SIZE OF A MUSTARD SEED...........you can tell a mountain to get up and cast itself into the sea!

2Hot9EJiaa	This song is one of my favorites-  actually had it song at my husband and my wedding renewal ceremony.  God created us because He loved us.  He knew that we would fall short of His glory, and that even though "He sees our sin, He looks on us in love".  Sometimes I ask this same question- we are not worthy of His love - however in His worthiness He chose to die on the cross so that we could be reconciled to Him, and have the relationship that He created us to have.  What really amazes me and what I praise God for everyday is the fact that He knew that I would fall short, but still created me and when Jesus hung on the Cross, it was us that He was thinking of. It was not the nails that kept Christ on the cross , it was His love us. Unbelievable huh?|`|f3nwI8ytaa	He created us to bear His image on the Earth.  We were made to stand for God-- a bridge between the Spirit Creator and the physical universe.  I trust that He knew what He was doing when He made us so.

When humans were first created, Adam and Eve, they were made PERFECT --- PERFECT HUMAN BEINGS and God gave them a paradise to live in "The Garden of Eden". He gave them free reign over all creation in the earth, the animals, plants and vegetables, etc. God also gave a direct order and if they rebelled, disobeyed, they would surely die in that day. They did disobey and both died within the day they sinned; Adam was about 935 years old when he died, and Eve about 880 years old though the Bible is not exactly pin-pointed on how old she was when she died. <br>  <br>  Remember what 2 Peter 3: 8 - 10 tells us:<br>  <br>  ...One thousand years to us is but one day to God, and one day is 1,000 years"...<br>  <br>  They both grew old, rotted and died. We have inherited their imperfection, but one day soon, God will make all sins go away and the last sin to be removed from mankind is "death" itself.<br>  <br>  We were created perfect but were made sinners through one man, Adam. When Jesus came in the 1st Century, he was the perfect ransom, that perfect sacrifice to give us back what Adam lost for us: LIFE. Jesus was "the 2nd Adam". <br>  <br>  At Armageddon he (Jesus) will return once more to destroy all wicked humans in the earth and then death will be the last sin removed from mankind. We won't die anymore and there will obviously be a lot of room within the earth because most now in the earth are wicked; very evil and live outside of God and his standards.<br>  <br>  Psalms 37: 8 - 11 tells us:<br>  <br>  ..."And the meek shall inherit the earth in the abundance of peace... forever... and the wicked will be no more for we will certainly give attention to their place, but they will not be"...<br>  <br>  He, God, chooses those, meaning, he is the ultimate judge of who survives [at Armageddon - who gets life] and who will be judged to destruction; death. God has a book of life and many of us are written into this book of life, but don't forget, we can be removed also.<br>  <br>  I do ponder Armageddon quite often and I am not craving it, but I want it to be here. I am not sure if I will "make it" or not, but whether I do or don't [get life], anything is better than living in the world to which we live in today for this is a world full of liars, hypocrisy, greed, abuses -- serious abuses, mental anguish constantly, fornication, and the list is never-ending. Armageddon will take care of all of this. I hope God sees fit for me to "live" after he sends his son to destroy all wicked humans in the earth; I would want nothing more than to live forever on a paradise earth.<br>  <br>  I hope you do too.|`|Jgoylfvqaa	Because he created us!

WKtOrTCaaa	These are almost all good options.<br>  <br>  Spanish and Italian are both fairly easy for an English speaker to learn, as are Norwegian and Swedish. Finnish, on the other hand, is completely unrelated to English. It is widely considered to be one of the world's most difficult languages!<br>  <br>  Personally, my experience is that the Scandinavian languages are a bit easier for an English speaker than the Romance languages, although those are probably the two easiest language families for us to pick up. :) Romance languages are going to have a lot of cognates, or similar words, with English, especially in high level vocabulary, like 'felicity' - 'felicidad' - 'felicitá' (Happiness, in fancy English, normal Spanish, and normal Italian, respectively). <br>  <br>  On the other hand, the Scandinavian languages have more 'basic' vocabulary in common with English, and the sentence structure is usually similar to English. For example,<br>  <br>  They Like Him<br>  <br>  Norwegian: De liker ham<br>  Spanish: Les gusta.<br>  <br>  Notice that Norwegian expresses this idea in a very similar way to English, and Spanish instead uses a construction like 'he is pleasing to them'. Also, in Spanish, the verb is conjugated (changes to show who does the action), and therefore, the pronoun is not needed. In the Nordic languages, you use the pronoun and less verb conjugation, as in English. <br>  <br>  Another benefit is that if you learn Norwegian, you are automatically functional in Swedish and Danish as well. (If you learn Danish, you gain this functionality with Norwegian, but not really with Swedish... if you learn Swedish, you gain it with Norwegian but not really with Danish... so if you want to be able to communicate in all three, choose Norwegian). They say that if you learn Spanish, you can manage with a Portuguese or Italian speaker if both of you are working at it. I have found this to be far less true than the idea that you can speak Norwegian with any mainland Scandinavian.<br>  <br>  All in all, they are both pretty easy. Norwegian may be a little easier if you have no other criteria for your decision. But think about where you want to travel and why you want to use the language, this is probably more important. :)|`|oAkhoCQ6aa	Spanish is generally considered one of the easiest languages, although there is no "scale of difficulty" for languages. Languages always depend on the perspective of the learner. Russian is relatively easy to learn for someone from Poland, yet it is considerably difficult for English learners.<br>  As far as the length of time for fluency, it will depend on your level of commitment, the effort and time you put into it and whether or not you are around others that speak it fluently. You can study a language all you want but if you never immerse yourself in that language, you'll never master it. I taught English in Poland and I met people that had been studying English for 5, 7, and even 9 years and many could barely string together a coherent sentence, simply because they've never had the opportunity to visit an English-speaking country or converse with Native English speakers.<br>  <br>  Also: Italian is about on par with Spanish as far as "easy", but I would stay away from Scandinavian languages if you're looking for "easy" or versatility [that is, 'who speaks Norwegian?' Think about it, 99% of every country south of the U.S. speaks Spanish, not to mention Spain or your almost compatibility with Portuguese or Italian. ]|`|m4nKkFDUaa	Italian|`|TO0tJCsOaa	if the only lanuguage that you know right now is English, then I would say spanish.

You become a new creation in Christ. I question anyone who says that they're born again if there is no change. Jesus spoke of the different ground the seed of Christ falls on. The gift of eternal life is free and never can be taken back. God knows who His children are. There are some that have fallen away (backslid) but, the Lord goes after them and receives them back. I am one of them. For over twenty years I lived my life in riotous living denying Christ in my life. Then one day (yes, one day), I asked Him to take me back and He did. That was in 1994. <br>  Just because we are Christians doesn't mean we don't have free will. It is there and everyday we have the choice to either serve God or ourselves. This is the battle that we must face every single day. We do answer to our conscience and we are held accountable. Believe me when I say that I have been held accountable for much. I'm glad for if I were not then I would be guilty of having a seared conscience. We are easily forgiven when we turn to Him for forgiveness. God knows our hearts and if He sees that we are trying to fool Him then He will deal with us. We answer to God.<br>  I'm sorry if you know Christians who do what they want and don't answer to God but, you must ask whether they really know Him at all. <br>  Thanks for the question. I find it very sincere and am glad to assist in answering. I hope I have. God Bless. :)|`|5nfqY9T7aa	I'm pretty sure you have to mean it in your heart.

Read Matthew chapter 7.|`|Bq0gqw7qaa	I believe the most powerful reason for believing in God firstly revolves around our understanding of what is right or wrong regarding morality. A skeptics perspective that Objective (that is existing outside of our perspective) moral values do not exist. That stealing or lying or rape are not wrong in of themselves but have been determined to be so by the clan, society, mankind for the advancement of it seems un retainable to me. That adherants of moral relativism, or ethical subjectivism when tested inevitably conceed that some moralities improve are in fact better than others, thus nulifying their argument.<br>  I believe that a significantly stronger argument is that the "law written in our hearts", "natural law" (see Aquinas) guides all human beings regarless of race colour or creed to be drawn "to do good and avoid evil". Why else would anyone (and I believe all are) be drawn to accept basic fundamental human rights, if they did not actually believe they exist, and they only can, if justice and objective moral values actually do. I believe this to be a significant indicator that we may actually indeed be "created in the image and likeness of God". I think the proposition that it is in our nature to know and rationaly choose right from wrong best explains why Theist and atheist alike generally choose to do so.<br>  and I find it fascinating that although both are guided by their nature to do the good, both sometimes fail to act in accordance with it. Natural Law can only be felt, not shown, or even for that matter observed|`|UkKEvilYaa	God knows what is in your heart, if you are truly a Christian you become a new person wanting to follow the Lord in all things that you do. Christians have a conscience knowing that someday they will have to answer to God for all their actions. <br>   Forgiveness is not easy, as we are to forgive others as Jesus forgave us. I have a step father that was very abusive to me, and it took a while before I could learn to forgive him.I have and pray from him all the time. My son thought that he had done so much wrong in his life he could never be forgiven He found out he was wrong that there was nothing he could do to stop God or me from loving him. The hardest thing he did was ask for forgiveness and to forgive himself. So it si not easy but you do not have to do it alone God wants to be there for you.|`|f9hHqA1Vaa	bible is fiction.

f0JLp4hFaa	There has never been a proven case of actual ability to foretell the future.<br>  <br>  A million dollar prize has been available for a decade to anyone who can, under basic test conditions, prove any paranormal ability.  The test conditions were always fair, and were always agreed to by the person claiming the abilities.  The prize was never won.<br>  <br>  Not one person foretold 9/11 or the 2004 Tsunami - both of which were world-changing events.<br>  <br>  But fortune telling and spiritualism are BIG business, so many people (some of them very charismatic and convincing) are out there trying to take your money.<br>  <br>  I can give you one prophecy - you will live a richer, more rewarding life if you don't waste your precious mental energy on nonsense, and if you don't waste your money on frauds.|`|OeAfpIZAaa	You are a teenager.<br>  <br>  When you get older, you will stop believing in fortune tellers.<br>  <br>  You will die of natural causes.<br>  <br>  No, you will not.|`|4S5NnT7aaa	One of these days, I'll create a new Y!A profile as a fortune teller so that I can amusingly mock people such as yourself who think that it's possible to get a true psychic reading, especially one from the Internet. Nothing personal, but you'll get nonsense from so-called 'psychics', regardless of whether you've paid for their opinions or not.<br>  <br>  My completely non-psychic reading is: You're 15 now. You'll die at 23 in a road traffic accident.  You will meet an internationally famous rock band, but only when they get off their tour bus to see what they just ran over.

Since when is pain something foreign to me?  My life, such as it is, has taught me to be remarkably accepting of hardship; so what if my life is nothing but decline?  It is what it is, and all of it, even the experience of pain, of hardship, every hurt that comes my way, is something uniquely and personally part of me, this story of mine.  As I wrote to someone recently, very few of us have lives whose stories go on to be bestsellers; most of us end up in anonymity, but that is us, the vast library of humanity.<br>  <br>  I won't have this life too long, of course, and even a bad life, even this life of mine, is something I love fiercely; when it is gone, I will miss it.|`|wmSSCZ5paa	I learned that I am grateful to be a woman and can express being overwhelmed by being allowed to cry.

8PjHFUdfaa	Hell is like sleeping with no dreams, not knowing anything about anything.|`|FMuSs9Qtaa	No, i don't etier|`|f3nwI8ytaa	My belief in heaven forces me to believe in hell.  Not to mention the fact that Jesus clearly believed in hell.  It's kind of hard for me to be a Christian and think Jesus was wrong about it.<br>  <br>  peace<br>  <br>  --------------------------<br>  What would heaven be like for someone who didn't want to be there?|`|s40sgQ45aa	Read scriptures and allow the spirit of God to lead you to truth.<br>  <br>  Hell is not the lake of fire.

I saw a show on the history channel once where an archeologist was talking about historical Hell.  He indicated that there was an area outside the city that was basically the local dump.  They burned things there all the time, it was infested with vermin, it smelled bad, pretty much the same as any other dump, and the dump was called Hell.  Given that sort of information, I think when God says in the Bible he will throw you in Hell for your sins, I think it's pretty much saying that if you sin against him he will throw you in the garbage.  The descriptions are pretty consistent with how a dump would have been run in those days, bad smells, things burning day and night, and attendants with pitchforks, who would have used those to turn over burning rubbish, etc.<br>  I believe in reincarnation also, and that if someone finds such an afterlife for a time, it's a reflection of how they lived on the way there, but they eventually learn something and find their way out of there on their way to being reborn.  Ideas have the ability to construct things in other dimensions, enough people believe in the concept of Hell and add the energy of that imagery to the construction of such a place, so yeah, for some people Hell does exist, because they feed it with their energy and construct it with their ideas, and some people who truly believe they belong there deep down will find their way there for a time, until they figure out that they built and imposed it on themselves, and go on to be born again...|`|AA10945101	I believe in hell.  I believe the bible makes it perfectly clear that hell exists.  As such, if a person is going to believe in the existence of God and heaven, then it isn't logical not to believe in the existence of hell too.  Either you believe what God said or you don't...if you think he was lying about hell then it doesn't make sense to believe he was telling the truth about heaven (or anything else).   <br>  <br>  Having said that, I don't believe that any human being has the ability to understand the nature of hell or the knowledge to say who will or will not end up in hell (if anyone).  God made it clear that it exists but he did NOT give us enough information to determine what is like or whether any specific human being, including ourselves, will experience it some day.  <br>  <br>  I would note that your beliefs about what happens to people who haven't been "good enough" to get in to heaven sounds a whole lot like hell to me!  <br>  <br>  For one, I think the gatekeeper of heaven, the one that gets to make that "good enough" assessment for each of us, made it pretty clear that he sets the criteria and he makes the decision..and he set the bar REALLY high!  Did you ever lie, steal, hurt another person?...if so, will you ever be able to know that you're "good enough" until your life is over?  <br>  <br>  Then, if you aren't, you get to start over without the benefit of what you learned on your previous attempts to pass his entrance exam! <br>  <br>  I just got this picture in my head of a student taking a comprehensive exam required to complete his or her degree.  If the student passes the exam (however "passing" is defined by the person giving the test NOT by the person taking it), he or she graduates and moves on to bigger and better things. If the student doesn't pass the exam, he or she gets to start over...take all the classes again and then take the comprehensive exam...and again, if he or she passes, graduation, if not, try again.<br>  <br>  Now to make this scenario reflect the reality of the situation, the course work has to take a lifetime, the topics covered by the exam change every time you take it, passing is defined as "100%" correct, and you are given no feedback on your performance until you finish the exam...and then you are only told that you passed or failed.  On top of that, given what we know, few if any people are born with any knowledge from a previous life, thus, they can learn nothing from their previous failure to help them pass the second (or third or fourth or one hundreth) attempt at the exam.   <br>  <br>  Personally, I think that sounds like "eternal torture".  After all, you clearly accept that this earth isn't heaven...now consider that if what you believe is true, this earth may well be the hell described in the bible!  An eternity spent taking and retaking a test that you probably won't even realize you're taking until you've already failed it.  <br>  <br>  ...and on top of that, you have no control over the circumstances you're born into on any of those lifetimes!  Your life may seem pretty good this time around...you may have experienced some pain and suffering due to illness or injury, the death of a loved one, the unkind actions of other people, but all in all, getting to go to heaven isn't significantly more appealing to you than getting another life!  <br>  <br>  But try to put yourself in the shoes of someone who lives a life that you would classify as "torturous".  Imagine being born to parents who abuse you physically and/or sexually from the time you're an infant, imagine being born in abject poverty with hunger pains and death and disease a daily part of your life.  Imagine being born into slavery or in a country ruled by a dictator who uses force and even torture to control your behavior. Would you still use the word "just" in connection with the alternative of being reborn back to earth???<br>  <br>  What if I told you that if you don't pass the test this time, when you are reborn, you'll be born into the exact same circumstances and have the exact same life as the one person you've identifed in this lifetime as having "the most horrible life you can imagine".  Are you still willing to risk your next life on your ability to figure out what God means by "good enough"?|`|rh5vbol9aa	A hungarian poet, whose name is Attila Jozsef says that he made a trip in the hell.|`|FOzN3xwzaa	Jesus made it clear that hell is eternal torment.  And that nobody has to be sent to hell.

ozwLZwXeaa	I would pick Ron Howard. Actor/director and former child star on the Andy Griffith show.   I would choose him because he is smart and is capable of getting the job done.|`|xyt9NdjVaa	I won't answer to the last part of your question because to elect a president on his or her looks is unwise, since looks won't get you squat when it really comes down to getting the job done. As far as a Hollywood personality, Many of the Hollywood actors/actress' are liberal minded. Those that are Hollywood conservatives are generally looked down upon by the Hollywood scene because liberal Hollywood follows the 'PC' garbage.  Clint Eastwood has been shunned for his conservatism. The man has my respect. I wouldn't mind seeing Kelsey Grammer. (Frazier,) or Wayne Rogers, (Mash,) run for president. I would have voted for Fred Thompson had he stayed in the running. Again, it is a tragic mistake to vote for a presidential candidate on their looks alone. That is not making an intelligent decision for such an important office to be held, if they are not qualifed otherwise.|`|vQJPRjhVaa	Not a one , I hate it when they use their status/influence  to support anything of a political nature.|`|ZCh0OHuhaa	Arnold Swartsneggar.|`|WbKBHh8Haa	Al Pacino|`|vxSXsn59aa	Bill Maher.|`|P8dOSNslaa	DON RICKLES|`|Rs3ITS1Iaa	Henry Winkler a.k.a the Fonz|`|1yxPfC0Jaa	Stewie Griffin for president! <br>  A cartoon character would be as good as any politician, lol!|`|IAdmom0Qaa	Chuck Norris.

gYV5ikdgaa	I myself am wiccan, and I have a few pointers:<br>  -DO NOT go straight into spells, study like crazy first.<br>  <br>  also, for sites, witchvox.com is great.<br>  do not use wicca.com, it is very misnformational, it is better just to learn about the properties of things.<br>  <br>  The book "Wicca For Beginners" by Thea Sabin is a great book, hands down, it covers energy, theological beliefs, tools, covens, solitary, eclectic, and things you can do like practices.<br>  <br>  Wicca is not all about spells. i have been studying for 3 years, I have yet to preform more then a few spells, but that is not uncommon.<br>  <br>  Spells are a sidething. first, you hould do some welcoming rituals, try drawing a circle and calling the quarters, communicating with the gods.<br>  Also, feeling the energy in your body and other objects is a very good practice.<br>  <br>  It is better to write your own incantations then to use pre-existing ones.<br>  Study candle magic aswell as stones and such (the only good use of wwicca.com)<br>  <br>  witchvox (The witches voice) is the best site for wiccans. It gives so much information.<br>  <br>  So, please study, fight the fluff, and don't give up.<br>  Also, if you're a minor, mke sure your parents are okay with it.<br>  I'ma star this question and add you, I like following peoples journeys, it's interesting.<br>  <br>  ALSO:<br>  -A Book of Shadows is a must, you can go to the dollar store and buy a notebook, buy a very expensive one from some occult shop (or from a new ager, they'll have even higher prices, XD)<br>  or, as i do, use a blog site. This is good because you can opy and paste useful things.<br>  <br>  If you're interested in any help at all on studying, contact me at:<br>  vampir3jon@hotmail.com<br>  <br>  I am willing to help with whatever you need.<br>  <br>  P.S. stay away from teen books, they're misinformed most of the time.|`|vouUQQzBaa	Are you seeking sites for spells and the witchcraft in general?<br>  Or are you seeking the religious aspect of Wicca?|`|fe6b42bdfa55cb67fd1db082d532073aaa	well i guess theres not one good site.  Just type it in a good search engine. there would be tons.  Try to find in yahoo groups|`|SDDgbtQ4aa	Wicca is a religion.  Witchcraft is a magical practice.  The two often go together, but don't necessarily have to.  Many Wiccans do not work with spells.  As there are witches who do not follow the religion of Wicca.<br>  <br>  I'm not sure what you mean by practicing Wicca "a little", and then you go on to mention spells, which would be a secondary practice.  First and foremost, the focus of Wicca is building a relationship with the God(s) and Goddess(es), attuning to nature and the natural cycles of the year (keeping the Sabbats), and living by a code of ethics based on the Wiccan Rede and Law of Return.  I would suggest a year's worth of study on Wicca and witchcraft to determine if this is the path for you before deciding to dedicate to it.<br>  <br>  This is one of the best websites with information on all the basics of Wicca:  <a href="http://wicca.timerift.net/" rel="nofollow">http://wicca.timerift.net/</a><br>  <br>  And every witch should also have The Witches Voice bookmarked:<br>  <a href="http://www.witchvox.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.witchvox.com/</a><br>  <br>  As far as magic, it's best to start at the beginning, learning meditation and magical techniques.  I would recommend working through Christopher Penczak's "The Inner Temple of Witchcraft" for this.  Once completed, you can move on to "The Outer Temple of Witchcraft" which will delve more into putting the techniques you learn into practice.<br>  <br>  I would also recommend Carl McColman's "Before You Cast a Spell: Understanding the Power of Magic".<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Inner-Temple-Witchcraft-Meditation-Development/dp/0738702765" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/Inner-Temple-Witch...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Outer-Temple-Witchcraft-Circles-Rituals/dp/0738705314/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1236447159&sr=1-1" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/Outer-Temple-Witch...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Before-You-Cast-Spell-Understanding/dp/1564147169/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1236447193&sr=1-1" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/Before-You-Cast-Sp...</a><br>  <br>  Blessings on your journey.|`|UsH9kex3aa	<a href="http://www.witchvox.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.witchvox.com/</a><br>  Witch's Voices is one of the the oldest and most popular news and networking sites for Wicca. It has links to many helpful sites, and I'm pretty sure they have forums that can help you. They also list local covens so that you acquaint yourself with other Wiccans. Good luck and blessed be.
Sn0CViR7aa	My Jewish friends seem to believe the Messiah was to be a world conqueror.  By that standard, Muhammad seems to be what they have in mind.  He "pacified" the Arabian peninsula in his lifetime, and within a couple of generations, he built a Muslim empire from Spain to India.

Others are incorrect, the Messiah will NOT "save" everyone, won't be divine and will NOT be worshiped. He will accomplish all the prophecies and won't need a "second coming" to do so.  Therefore, Jesus wasn't the Jewish Messiah. He was likely meant to bring the pagan Gentiles to monotheism but he was not the Jewish Messiah.<br>  <br>  Major points: no world peace, no messiah.

"Jews for Jesus and Messianic Jews" are Christian Evangelical groups. No branch of Judaism excepts them (it's like stating you are a God believing atheist).<br>  <br>  It is important to note that the OT and Tanach are not the same when making theological comparisons the same way the OT/NT and the Qu'ran are not the same. <br>  <br>  It is also important to note that none of these prophecies include anything about a "second" coming.<br>  <br>  Here are some translation differences:<br>  <br>  Psalm 22:17: "Hikifuni ca'ari yaday veraglay"<br>  Means: "They bound me like a lion my hands and my feet"<br>  Christian translation: "They pierced my hands and feet"<br>  <br>  Nowhere in the Tanach do the words ca'ari or hikifuny mean anything resembling the word pierce.<br>  <br>  Isaiah 7:14: "Hinei ha'almah harah veyoledet ben"<br>  Means: "Behold the young woman is pregnant & shall give birth to a son."<br>  Christian translation: "Behold a virgin shall give birth."<br>  <br>  In Hebrew, 'ha' means 'the' and 'almah' refers to young woman. Betulah is Hebrew for virgin and is used in the Torah.<br>  <br>  The term mashiach literally means anointed one and refers to the practice of anointing kings with oil when they took the throne. The word does not mean savior. Every King/High Priest was anointed with oil, each being referred to as a mashiach/messiah.<br>  <br>  We believe the messiah *WILL*:<br>  -------------<br>  <br>  -From the line of David on his fathers side (Jeremiah 23,5)<br>  *If Jesus was the product of a virgin birth he couldn't have been from David's line on his father's side genetically. <br>  <br>  -Observant of Torah commandments (Isaiah 11,2-5)<br>  *It's noted that Jesus didn't observe some commandments: "He does not observe Shabbat!" (John 9:14)<br>  <br>  -A normal human who doesn't possess supernatural abilities<br>  *Jesus had 'supernatural' abilities.<br>  <br>  - Born of human parents<br>  *Jesus was a product of a virgin birth..Not two parents*<br>  <br>  What the messiah will do:<br>  --------------<br>  -Bring political and spiritual redemption to the Jewish people<br>  *Are Jewish people in political/spiritual redemption? No.<br>  <br>  -Bring all Jews into Israel (Is:11-12; Jer:23,3; Hosea 3,4-5)<br>  *Are all Jewish people in Israel? No (I'm in NYC ;))<br>  <br>  -Establish a Torah based government in Israel (Is: 2,2-4; 11)<br>  *Israel is a democracy, not a theocracy.<br>  <br>  - Rebuild the third Temple (Ezekiel 37:26-28)<br>  *Is the third temple rebuilt? No.<br>  <br>  - Re-establish worship in the Temple (Jeremiah 33,18)<br>  *Are people worshiping in the rebuilt Temple? No.<br>  <br>  - Usher in an era of world peace (Isaiah 2:4)<br>  (The end of all hatred, oppression, suffering and disease)<br>  *Do we still have hatred/oppression/suffering/disease? Yes.<br>  <br>  - Lead the Jewish people to full Torah observance.<br>  *Are all of the Jewish people fully Torah observant? No.<br>  <br>  All commandments in Judaism remain binding forever: Anyone who comes to change them is identified as a false prophet (Deut 13:1-4).<br>  <br>  In the NT Jesus contradicts Torah and states its commandments are no longer applicable (John 1:45, 9:16, Acts 3:22, 7:37)<br>  <br>  God is not mortal: God is one:<br>  ------------------------------<br>  Can man be God? No.<br>  "God is not a mortal" (Numbers 23:19).<br>  <br>  (Numbers 23:17/19) - "...What did God say? He said: Rise up Balak and hear...God is not a man...or a son of man..."<br>  <br>  (Deuteronomy 13:2-4) "If there arise among you a prophet or a dreamer of dreams and he gives you a sign or a wonder AND THE SIGN OR THE WONDER COME TO PASS of which he spoke to you saying, let us go after other gods which you have not known and let us serve them; you will not hearken to the words..."<br>  <br>  "You shall not hearken to the words of the prophet (who changes anything in Torah)... for God, your God tests you to know whether you love Him with all your heart and with all your soul."<br>  <br>  This excerpt tells us that even if someone has the ability to perform supernatural miracles we should be wary: Especially if they claim to worship another God.<br>  <br>  This outlines the possibility of fake prophets and people claiming "miracles" in order to further their goals.<br>  <br>  (Deuteronomy 13:1) "Everything that I command you, do it and do it meticulously. You may not add to it, nor take away from it."<br>  <br>  This refers to the Tanach*<br>  <br>  God clearly states that he is ONE and that there is no one else to do His job: How does Jesus deliver if this is the case:<br>  <br>  (Isaiah 43:11-13) "I am the Lord, and beside me there is no deliverer. I have declared and have saved and I have announced that there be no strange god among you...there is none that can deliver out of my hand..."<br>  <br>  And of course to counter the "suffering servant" argument placed by Christian apologetics you can check here: <br>  <a href="http://www.outreachjudaism.org/sin.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.outreachjudaism.org/sin.html</a><br>  <br>  "Despite strong objections from conservative Christian apologists, the prevailing rabbinic interpretation of Isaiah 53 ascribes the “servant” to the nation of Israel who silently endured unimaginable suffering at the hands of its gentile oppressors.

Ao52XHjCaa	It sounds like you have spent a good deal of time reflecting on this situation. You've got a few issues here that you should probably divide up if you want to solve the issue.<br>  <br>  It's interesting that you lower expectations then still force yourself to fail. Lowering expectations is usually a way of dealing with stage fright, and I think that is what you have. When they tell you to get over fear of being judged by an audience they tell you to think of them in their underwear - in other words, eliminate them in your mind as sensible judges. You are attempting to do something similar to that - you eliminate people as potentially harsh judges to ease your anxiety by making them easy judges (judges with low expectations), but you aren't actually doing so successfully. You still don't want them to judge you negatively, so you perform to their lowered expectations. <br>  <br>  You may also be forcing yourself to fail so you feel that your failure is under control (you hate mistakes, don't you?), but that is another thing that people do when they have stage fright. A performer can't control what the audience thinks, so he or she purposely calls attention to a specific failure. But you don't mention that your failure is intentional.<br>  <br>  What I think you need to do is check out one of the many books on dealing with stage fright and see if they can offer some advice. (You also need to learn how to take a compliment, but that is also hard when you are so worried about becoming prideful). I think you may need a more effective way to manage performance related stress, since the one you have unconsciously adopted is not very effective. I think you carry stage fright into almost every situation you are in.<br>  <br>  Your low self-esteem is a different issue altogether. Perhaps by performing better, you'll raise that a little too. But what you describe is something a little different from that. You know inside that you are good, you just don't want it to be known that you are good - you don't want to be noticed. When people have low self esteem, they usually think that they aren't any good. You seem like someone who is good at reflecting on your problems. If you recast your low self esteem as shyness or a little fear of being noticed, what does that do for you? What's keeping you out of the limelight?|`|d8ox561maa	Perhaps you should become a little bit more selfish.

Not everyone would be asked to play piano, they must really value me". Then just say "Yeah, sure thing, thanks for asking!".<br>  It's a habit you've got into, and it's a habit that it's really best to be out of.<br>  If you get into the habit of being thanking, rather than putting yourself down, you'll find you become a lot more positive automatically.<br>  The more you put yourself down, the more others will believe you, and you will have a very negative air about you.

Well, I'm not an atheist, but personally, I don't understand how someone can dismiss the idea of a supreme being as not existing and not provable, and still believe in things like spirits, or fairies, or anything like that, isn't it pretty much about what can be known through science, or processed through your five senses? As far as I know, atheists believe that personality is a function of things like nerves and brain chemistry, that there is no such thing as a soul, and that one ceases to exist altogether, body, mind and spirit at the time one dies.  If you no longer exist, then there is no need of an afterlife of any kind to go to. Those who set out to prove the existence of things like spirits are pretty much outside of the realm of science.

If you deny God, then you have to deny your own existence, which is impossible.

Despite being penned by different authors over 40 centuries, the Bible does not contradict itself and does not contain any errors.

Is He God? Why did He suffer on the Cross?<br>  2) What is so special about Jesus? Why cant I just view him as an ordinary man or a teacher or a prophet?

But, in modern English people tend to use the first pattern in daily conversation than the latest one. The latest pattern is used to say in traditional English.

bxxwhP04aa	Don't know, but I believe he was married to Anne Boleyn, and had her be-headed........really NICE of him, don't you think ?|`|yQNit56Qaa	Well, really neither.  He wasn't teaching false Christian doctrine - he just wanted a divorce.  Since he was the most powerful individual in England - having feudal control of the military forces there - he was able to get what he wanted.  He had the power to ignore the pope and Roman Catholic religious restrictions on his personal life and gain a divorce.  His influence with local clerics allowed him to get a divorce once the threat of the pope's displeasure was removed from whatever cleric(s) were agreeable to annulling his marriage.<br>  <br>  Not exactly heroic.<br>  <br>  You *could* say "heretical" in the sense that he considered his own authority to be superior to the pope's - but he was hardly the first noble to exercise his military might or wealth or influence to sidestep the *official* doctrines of the Roman Catholic Church.  Many later rulers - Roman Catholics, in fact - had the same idea that their authority over their territory "trumped" that of the pope.  Holy Roman Emperor Joseph II was infamous for his treatment of the church as just another of his vassals, and he was hardly the first or last to treat the church in his domain in a similar fashion - that is, as just another subject of his kingdom.<br>  <br>  When you figure in the military eradication of Roman Catholicism that took place under Hank8 after the formation of the Church of England, you might label him "heretic" with more foundation.  At that point, he was clearly attempting to eradicate all loyalty to the pope - not just assert his local authority over that of the pope.  However, that occurred *after* he had established the Church of England so that he could get a divorce.<br>  <br>  Jim, <a href="http://www.bible-reviews.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.bible-reviews.com</a>|`|YXGdwwTJaa	No; how could he be a hero when he was King, did not have any dangerous war to fight in his time and could virtually do what he wanted.  There was no struggle against odd for him, only an attempt to find a legitimate male heir as that was how royalty was usually passed on. <br>  <br>  Henry may have kept, in his heart,  to the catholic theological beliefs in which he had been raised, but he broke with the Church of Rome as the wife he wanted to get rid of was too important to harm. As her relations had power over the Pope  Henry could not get a divorce.   The only way was to have another church.  There were Protestant groups, who now used their own language, not Latin, for religion, on the continent.  Henry copied them, put in the Bible in English, newly available due to printing; and made up his own religion, what fun he had!  <br>  <br>  there was another motive,  the CatholicChurch owned much wealth, especially in the form of monastic lands and taxes paid to the Pope, so Henry grabbed this lot for himself.  It was partly a desire to create a religion that the English would like, not one from a foreign sourece, but  the impetus may have been more the desire to have a son by a young woman and to make lots of money.  Being in control of the religion meant that Henry could dictate even more as head of church than he had as head of state.  It was politically expedient.  <br>  <br>  Heresy is simply what someone calls you when you disagree with them.  It means nothing but is an excuse for punishment.|`|VmqOq8Qjaa	Heretic to some hero to others, either way, christianity invaded and staked their claim in england.|`|wxBFZ41Taa	Heretic.

As humans we can see the consequences of pre-marital sex as you stated, single moms and also spread of disease.  On an emotional level, there is a bond that forms that's very sensitive, and most adults know about it and is a big part of why they don't want their young persons having sex, becuz it can hurt so deeply when things don't work out. There's just a big responsibility there that required commitment to another person which can really interfere with the progress of their lives. Alot of 'entertwining", i don't know how else to describe it.<br>  But on a spiritual level (and that's where Christians differ from atheists), we believe there is an entertwining of souls which cannot be undone. So you're 'connected' to all your partners for life! And i think girls especailly feell this and that really messes with our self esteem. Not saying guys don't get affected by it, but i think girls are more sensitive to it. <br>  Anyway, marriage is Gods prerequisite for sex, in marriage two souls become one, and that is the ultimate commitment between two humans, which sets a sound foundation for trusting your "heart" to another. Being married doesn't mean nothing can go wrong, being human we are not perfect. But if we did follow Gods rules perfectly, no one would be hurt. So if we follow the 'marriage' rule, and also follow the "don't divorce" rule, and also follow 'no adultery" rule, you can see where that leads......|`|bVHnNqzBaa	I think it's because they don't want other people to enjoy their lives while they miss out on the good things that god gave people to experience during their physical life. Why do people have physical bodies if not to experience pleasure and TO LIVE LIFE? <br>  <br>  From responses I've seen in R&S, some Christians are jealous of us, believing we atheists are getting away with something. That we get to live a life without morals and then don't have to suffer the consequences. Not sure by what irrational logic they arrive at that conclusion. As an atheist I am moral, kind, and selfless because it is the right way to live. I have no expectation of any reward for proper living. Wouldn't a true Christian be good in absence of salvation, or are they only good to be saved?<br>  <br>  EDIT: Can anyone quote the Bible verse that explicitly states sex is reserved strictly for MARRIAGE?|`|94618fa9aff7c44a9bbefcc52d8a7de7aa	A lot of people don't understand but the act of sex is a union that actually combines the two bodies into one! <br>  If you are a Christian and you do take another in the act of sex then it is you who are taking a part of the body of Christ's church and engaging the church into another body. And that other body could very well be an evil one that has seduced you.<br>  Perhaps it isn't that, but it is not of the Christ nor is it of a holy state of matrimony, that strikes against the Lord. The Lord is our master, do you really want to be striking the one you serve? <br>  Marraige is not a signed document, the document is for the government and their census as well as statistics. Marraige however did not always have the law of the land to enforce a signed contract between the two. Marraige is a state of union sanctified by God. Officiated by clergy or other authority under God in front of witnesses and God by the passing of vows that bind the couple til death parts them. There is a big difference. <br>  As for the common law couple of twelve years? Well it's obvious they are married to each other with or without the blessings of a denomination or lawful contract. <br>  I think God would be able to see through that one don't you?<br>  Try to understand that the Christ sees all in all our hearts and is able to discern the difference between one another. He could very well see that the couple of twelve years have a real marraige of the hearts and soul whereas the two year marraige is just learning the heart and the soul of each other; and are still growing in their sanctified state.<br>   Or not.<br>  Marital sex is blessed, it is a union of man and woman, it is sanctified by our God.<br>  Premarital sex isn't. <br>  Never the less we all engage in it at one time or another. Well ... the vast majority of us have; we do have a minority who are able to control their teenage angst and their sexual wants long enough to remain virginal till their wedding night.|`|HBp5r76haa	The Bible nowhere directly and explicitly states that sex before marriage is a sin. There is no Hebrew or Greek word used in the Bible that is precisely defined to refer to sex before marriage. The Bible undeniably condemns adultery and sexual immorality, but the question arises, is sex before marriage considered sexually immoral? According to 1 Corinthians 7:2, “yes” is the clear answer, “But since there is so much immorality, each man should have his own wife, and each woman her own husband.” In this verse, Paul states that marriage is the “cure” for sexual immorality. 1 Corinthians 7:2 is essentially saying, “because people cannot control themselves and so many people are having immoral sex outside of marriage, people should get married, so they can fulfill their passions in a moral way.”<br>  <br>  So, on the basis of 1 Corinthians 7:2 clearly including sex before marriage in the definition of sexual immorality, all of the Bible verses that condemn sexual immorality as being sinful also condemn sex before marriage as sinful. Sex before marriage is included in the biblical definition of sexual immorality. Therefore, there are countless Scriptures that declare sex before marriage to be a sin (Acts 15:20; 1 Corinthians 5:1; 6:13,18; 10:8; 2 Corinthians 12:21; Galatians 5:19; Ephesians 5:3; Colossians 3:5; 1 Thessalonians 4:3; Jude 7). The Bible promotes complete abstinence before marriage. The biblical definition of sexual immorality is sex outside of marriage. Sex between a husband and his wife is the only form of sexual relations of which God approves (Hebrews 13:4).<br>  <br>  Far too often we focus on the “recreation” aspect of sex without recognizing the “re-creation” aspect. Yes, sex is pleasurable. God designed it that way, and He wants men and women to enjoy sexual activity (within the confines of marriage). However, the primary purpose of sex is not pleasure, but rather reproduction. God does not outlaw sex before marriage to rob us of pleasure, but to protect us from unwanted pregnancies and children born to parents who are not prepared for them. While practicality does not determine right from wrong, imagine how much better our world would be if God’s pattern for sex was followed. If the Bible's message on sex before marriage was obeyed, there would be far fewer sexually transmitted diseases, far fewer un-wed mothers, far fewer unwanted pregnancies, far fewer abortions, etc. Abstinence is God’s only policy when it comes to sex before marriage. Abstinence saves lives, protects babies, gives sexual relations the proper value, and most importantly, honors God.|`|evStsOQiaa	Why would God care when He had unprotected sex with a certain famous virgin He was not married to. What kind of leading by example is that?|`|31M2IDw2aa	Sex outside of marriage is FORNICATION. What you don't understand is that marriage is a Sacrament.  Of course today's modern world mocks such a notion.  Our modern culture is so contaminated as to celebrate multiple partners, and unbridled sex. Below I have posted a little about the Sacrament of Holy Matrimony, please read it. <br>  <br>  <br>  THE SACRAMENT OF MATRIMONY <br>  <br>  1601 "The matrimonial covenant, by which a man and a woman establish between themselves a partnership of the whole of life, is by its nature ordered toward the good of the spouses and the procreation and education of offspring; this covenant between baptized persons has been raised by Christ the Lord to the dignity of a sacrament."84|`|7422ddf097669bd7b6e3d48e56258b87aa	Marriage is much more than a signed document. It is God's way of including each and every one of us in his divine plan, which is based on love ... not lust. <br>  <br>  The Bible says this about love:<br>  <br>  1Co 13:4  Love (charity)  is patient, is kind: charity envieth not, dealeth not perversely, is not puffed up, <br>  1Co 13:5  Is not ambitious, seeketh not her own, is not provoked to anger, thinketh no evil: <br>  1Co 13:6  Rejoiceth not in iniquity, but rejoiceth with the truth: <br>  1Co 13:7  Beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things. <br>  1Co 13:8  Love (charity) never falleth away: whether prophecies shall be made void or tongues shall cease or knowledge shall be destroyed. <br>  <br>  When one man and one woman declare their love for one another in holy matrimony, that love not only lasts forever, but thanks to God, it has the power to transform the world, for good.<br>  <br>  Casual or temporary sexual relationships fall far short of God's plan, and when we accept those things, we too are likely to come up short ... in more ways than one.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://douglawrence.wordpress.com/" rel="nofollow">http://douglawrence.wordpress.com/</a>|`|iblT1HJpaa	God established the covenant (promise) of marriage to be holy binding one man and one woman to a life-long promise. A vow from one to another. This is why it is called "Holy Matrimony". And God allows us into this sacred thing to be bound to Him "as the third cord", the stronger cord to bring understanding and peace to something that should not work. <br>  Gen 2:24 - "a man shall leave his father and mother and be united to his wife as "one-flesh"... " <br>  For a marraige to be consecrated, two things need happen: <br>  A vow (promise) and sexual union. Think back......if people did not have sex, the marriage could be annuled for the marriage covenant was not fulfilled. It takes both things. Such is the power as God sees it in the act of sexual union. <br>  We take it all for granted (sex) because it's so great. It's only great in the confines of the marriage bed. Outside of that is where we find adultery, disease, unwanted pregnancy and abortion, hatred, deviousness, debauchery.......... and the list is endless. Does this happen in a marriage? No. <br>  If people have lived together for 10+ years - is it marriage? Not unless there was a vow. Society says "yes", but society needed to establish a baseline for divorce proceedings. This says nothing for the true intent of marriage.<br>  This is a very deep question for it crosses many barriers and goes ito the heart of love, commitment, law, divorce, children and the very heart of society - Marriage!|`|5163421430fada657d83a91148b438e2aa	You need to read the Bible if you want to understand our beliefs, the Bible says sex outside of marriage is a sin, it says a house built outside the Lord will not stand.Let me ask you why can't the couple that have been together 10 years not married if they love each other so much. I go by what the Bible says, it is what I know to be the truth.|`|zmVCqh7Daa	Nowadays marriage may be a signed document but not in God's eyes. Marriage is two couples coming together and being one. They are devoted to one another. Sex is in marriage. <br>  <br>  Love is love. BTW a "newly wed" is somebody who is married. So there really is no difference, because the 2 year and 10 year couple are both married.|`|LF4vun1maa	There is no logical basis for it.  Like much of the morality and structure Christians try to force on us its real source is us vs them mentality.  The group has a set of rules which they follow.  And they are the superior group so these rules are superior, it reinforces itself and goes to unhealthy places, like America having an anomalously high rate of STD infection and teen pregnancy.|`|5RmhSDPTaa	we wait until marriage because God designed sex FOR marriage.<br>  <br>  and your description of a couple who has lived together for 10 years and are in love, let me just say that God considers them married, whether they have a legal document or not.<br>  <br>  delme|`|AA12165299	as a Christian i believe there is a spiritual aspect to sex...when having sex with someone it creates a spiritual tie...making just one spiritual bond with one person creates a deeper fuller relationship...|`|hdFn4Dobaa	Yes dear, because God said so.<br>  A True believer is someone that walk in the Light of the Lord, instead of being a part time elevator rider.|`|dqZrq7Zeaa	I think it should be a matter of personal choice. I'd never marry someone I hadn't lived with. But my parents did and so did my sister and it worked out for all of us.|`|dqvZmj22aa	You mean the "church" position, or my thought as a Christian?  They ARE different.<br>  <br>  The traditional Christian church position is that any pleasure that is purely done for it's own sake is a distraction from God and therefore a "sin."  That covers everything from junk food, video games, movies, poetry, dancing, sex, etc.  <br>  <br>  I'm not that sort of Christian. All the pleasures of the world are there to remind us to thank God for making a nice place for us (before the jerks ruined it.)  This has always been a minority position in church history, but it's always been there.<br>  <br>  But I DO consider sex & lovemaking to be sacred, as it leads two souls to merge, to become "one flesh" as St. Paul put it.  Whenever 2 people make love, there will always be that connection between them.  So while maybe it doesn't require eternal marriage and sharing housekeeping the rest of your life, it isn't to be done with just anyone.  You wouldn't merge souls with anyone at random, would you?<br>  <br>  Makes sense I hope?

And they shall say to the elders of his city, ‘This son of ours is stubborn and rebellious; he will not obey our voice; he is a glutton and a drunkard.’  Then all the men of his city shall stone him to death with stones; so you shall put away the evil from among you, and all Israel shall hear and fear.”<br>  <br>  <br>  Disclaimer:  These are in no way my words, thoughts or anything that I would ever do.

It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. 5It is not rude, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. 6Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. 7It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres.<br>  <br>   8Love never fails. But where there are prophecies, they will cease; where there are tongues, they will be stilled; where there is knowledge, it will pass away. 9For we know in part and we prophesy in part, 10but when perfection comes, the imperfect disappears. 11When I was a child, I talked like a child, I thought like a child, I reasoned like a child. When I became a man, I put childish ways behind me. 12Now we see but a poor reflection as in a mirror; then we shall see face to face. Now I know in part; then I shall know fully, even as I am fully known.<br>  <br>   13And now these three remain: faith, hope and love.

In fact, he welcomed them with open arms.<br>  <br>  I sincerely hope this is a troll, but if not, I can only say: Any parent with such ferocious, clearly dangerous ignorance doesn't need to be raising a child. There is no contradiction between God and love in all its varied forms, and your son clearly has a better understanding of this than you do. Cudos to him for refusing "prayer meetings" and "laying on hands" in some feeble and backwards attempt to make him something he is not. (Prayer is about seeking wholeness, not about realizing alienation and fragmentation.) Frankly, I wouldn't want anything to do with your religious nonsense either--and you have done nothing to EARN his respect, whereas at least he's been strong enough to stand comfortable in his own skin, over and against your own misconceptions and prejudices. <br>  <br>  He deserves a better life than this.|`|4405cb5dd585bee70aeaf6a964ff0b94aa	Weren't you the trolling girl talking about killing off all the gays about a month back?

Once you have done this, slowly build up back to a family love relationship with him. It's difficult to do because he is your son after all, but it does work, and the child will respect you more for it in the long run. As far as being gay, that really makes no difference, that is on you and you need to stop being a homophobe.

His homosexuality is nothing to apologize for and completely natural.  Your offensive prejudice towards him and people like him is what should be apologized for.  God doesn't exist and if He does, it's not the hateful, contradictory, nonsensical God you were taught about.  Your religion is wrong and does things like create wars, teach non-acceptance of all kinds of different people, and even tear apart families like you and your son.  He knows he was born like that and that "God" would not make a person homosexual and then judge him for being one.  You are wrong, no matter how hard your religion was beaten into you, you are WRONG, wrong, wrong, and you're going to choose it over your son and lose him.  For his sake, I hope you do disown him so that he may live a normal, peaceful life without his own mother constantly hating and disapproving of him.  I can't tell you how sorry I feel for your son and you as well.  Religion has gotten the best of you.|`|QyAyQf3Laa	Proverbs 10: 1 tells us:<br>  <br>  A wise son is the one that makes a father rejoice, and a stupid son is the grief of his mother.<br>  <br>  Proverbs 10: 18:<br>  <br>  Where there is one covering over hatred there are lips of falsehood, and the one bringing forth a bad report is stupid.<br>  <br>  Proverbs 10: 23:<br>  <br>  To the stupid one the carrying on of loose conduct is like sport, but wisdom is for the man of discernment.<br>  <br>  Proverbs 13: 19 - 20:<br>  <br>  Desire when realized is pleasurable to the soul; but it is something detestable to the stupid ones to turn away from bad.<br>  <br>  He that is walking with wise persons will become wise, but he that is having dealings with the stupid ones will fare badly.<br>  <br>  Proverbs 14: 7 - 8:<br>  <br>  Go away from in front of the stupid man, for you will certainly not take note of the lips of knowledge.<br>  <br>  The wisdom of the shrewd is to understand his way, but the foolishness of stupid ones is deception.<br>  ----------------------<br>  <br>  MAINTAINING A FAMILY-LIKE ATTITUDE<br>  <br>  Good parents do not handle the wrongdoing of their children as does a judge in a court, simply getting the facts and then rendering a decision. They try to help wayward children to come to their senses and in the future to conduct themselves in a way that will bring credit, not disgrace, to the family.<br>  <br>  Often parents handle matters privately with a child that gets into trouble, not exposing their son or daughter to shame before the whole family. But when they deem it necessary, they may let all the other children know what has happened, the discipline given to the disobedient member of the family thus serving as a warning example to them. <br>  <br>  Parents may, for a time, put up patiently even with the wrongs of an adult son or daughter still living at home. Then, after repeated disciplinary efforts fail to correct a bad situation, they may demand that the grown son or daughter leave the house. (Compare this with what Israelite parents did in harmony with the command at Deuteronomy 21:18-21.) <br>  <br>  In taking this action, they may also have in mind shielding their younger children from a corrupt influence.<br>  -----------------------<br>  <br>  1 Corinthians 6: 9 - 11<br>  <br>  What! Do YOU not know that unrighteous persons will not inherit God’s kingdom? Do not be misled. Neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor men kept for unnatural purposes, nor men who lie with men, nor thieves, nor greedy persons, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners will inherit God’s kingdom. And yet that is what some of YOU were. <br>  ------------------<br>  <br>  It is time for Mr. Know-It-All to leave now. You have done all you can do and he needs to learn for, and fend for himself. He is a destructive force in your home and the situation is not getting any better.<br>  -----------------------<br>  <br>  My brother refused to listen to heeded warnings, and he is now doing 11 years in a federal prison for his sexual deviancies. He let it get out of hand and thought he'd never get caught and did not think of others. He was and is very stupid. I am glad he is in jail so hopefully he will change, but I doubt that 11 years will bring forth this change, but at least he is not able to be out and free hurting people and himself. He does not thinkof others and is a thorn in the side of our family. He has been given up to the world for his refusal to turn his life around and repent.<br>  <br>  Your son is not listening and it's time for him to go.

Keep him away from the television and stereoplayer. ---And keep on homeschooling. <br>  <br>  Keep praying for him. Don't forget, things like this just don't happen out of the blue. This child grew to be like that. That could have been because of a lack to discipline him in the past. It will be hard to train him now, but it might still be possible.  <br>  <br>  Ask more people to pray for him as well. Don't hate your child. I don't think you do.

She was a believer in Christ but was living in the flesh and felt very alone and alienated when matters of her faith arose.<br>  <br>  Two years later she was married to a wonderful man and still is.The talk we had?<br>  <br>  We went to the bible and looked specifically for what she was doing and how she was offending God. While I could only conjecture about her sexual relationship ,her "love " for the other individual was one which could be Agape was it less the sexual aspect. <br>  As I stated to her at that time to love someone of the same sex is not the sin. The sin is a sexual one by getting carried away in our lusts and having sex outside of marriage we are committing sin and the bible considers one man one woman marriage only.<br>  So she was given the option of looking at her relationship and if it was one that was Biblical or Carnal. She had to make the choice ...That is what God has given us Free Will.

And the scriptures have concluded that sin shall not have dominion over us, so it is left to our choosing to willfully sin or not too.|`|TyRfv0eoaa	Homosexuality is caused by nature... which is why it exists throughout nature. Nature was created by God, therefore, homosexuality was created by God. Simple logic.|`|yYYXVCGZaa	homosexuality has EXACTLY the same cause as heterosexuality, bi-sexuality and any other sexuality you cane name...genetics!  but you keep studying your mail order demon removal rites, i'm SURE that'll come in handy for something!|`|evStsOQiaa	It is caused by a flaw in the cells while dividing to make a fetus in the womb. Why God allows it to happen is a question I cannot answer.|`|7mhRDbvsaa	from one who disagrees with homosexuality<br>  <br>  your being very rude and immature|`|aEdkaXmtaa	none of the above|`|LF4vun1maa	In men the most common cause appears to be an immune reaction in the mother's body against certain androgens in the developing infant, which delays or redirects certain hormone cascades.  Environmental factors like this during development can have a greater effect than genetics, and they are just as permanent.  <br>  <br>  So no, it can't be "cured."  Attempting to alter factors like this is like asking water to run uphill.<br>  <br>  No matter how many times you repeat "It's a choice," those of us who live in the real world have already looked into things, and figured out how they work.  As is par for the course, you're likely to spend decades in the dark howling in terror at something because you don't understand it.|`|59vpcHuhaa	Neither. It's not a sin or an illness.<br>  But it's mental (in a different way). Homosexuals have a different gender identity and social gender role than heterosexuals. They were born that way and nothing's wrong with that.|`|baW9sSsLaa	None of the above.<br>  <br>  What's with this homosexual fixation you have, anyway?  <br>  <br>  "Methinks the lady doth protest too much..."|`|4nAVWEjhaa	hormones~ Now what causes republicanism and evangelicals?

Why don't Christians go there?|`|FMuSs9Qtaa	Why are u always in the gay section, you need to live people alone|`|P544Sbmqaa	You could easily flip that.  Christians are very obsessed over sex and orientation.  In fact, many of the rules/laws/traditions are based on someone controlling someone else's sex life and body.  Not everyone is a Christian, and we are in a country that was founded on the right of freedom to religion.  Perhaps YOU are the one who needs to go away.|`|TyRfv0eoaa	I think you have it backwards. It is homophobic heterosexuals like you who keep bringing it up.<br>  <br>  I'm a gay Christian. And in this section, I would much rather talk about the things of God. But people like you are far more concerned about what you think is going on in my bedroom. So as long as there are people like you, the issue will keep coming up.|`|iJzlRCkOaa	Well aren't you a compassionate individual.|`|gDVQNMR7aa	Why are YOU obsessed with gays?  <br>  <br>  o.O|`|cjneKyrZaa	Try this get 20 people in one room have 19 join hands and Make a circle taunt the one not in the circle and you will find that the person will search for the weakest link and try to break into the circle People no matter what they say can not choose to stay out of a group.  This also shows peer pressure and show we have no free will.  We have certain instincts like all animals.  Do not tell they group or at least the one left out what your experiment is until you have finished it.  People will not like the conclusions from this experiment because they will say the would rather be alone than in a relationship that is full of disrespect and hate. they will also try to explain this with circular reasoning. simply stick with the facts it will work every time and it even works when people don'tt believe the outcome.|`|9CoaKELzaa	I'm not a homosexual, but I'd speculate it's because they're tired of ignorant, narrow-minded hicks like yourself telling them they aren't allowed to be Christian.  I feel sorry for the little child you're raising.  It's a shame his mother isn't going to teach him to respect all people despite their religion or sexual preference.  Get a life, woman.  I hope your kid gets a proper education and realizes that you should respect all people for who they are, not what they look like or who they love.  It's a shame he's going to have to put up with you for the next 18 years...<br>  <br>  Do us all a favor and why don't YOU go away.  I hope Jayden is gay and then we'll see how you feel, woman.<br>  <br>  You are a complete embarassment to the Christian religion.

82A8E4yzaa	im confused about the question....<br>  <br>  are you saying is it wrong or right to date someone who is 16 years older than you?<br>  <br>  i think i get it now...lolz... i think it isn all right : unless your like very young [meaning less that 18] that would be weird.<br>  <br>  But if your mature and like this person very much..that why not? I am abit younger than the person i like....[9 years] . I think it could affect a realtionship..but its worth a try or you will never know.<br>  <br>  My answer - I think if you like this person....then its right.|`|2242ab75cc3bad9ab4ca7fbaf5578defaa	It's not wrong in itself but such relationships often fail in time due to the age difference|`|jd14u32qaa	I think that the farther apart your ages are, the less you will have in common, IN GENERAL.  There are obviously exceptions, but for the most part, people at different ages are a different stages in their lives so they are looking for different things.  You shouldn't worry about age, focus on each other, what you have in common and how you feel towards one another.|`|niZBsn9Qaa	When i was 18 i married someone 17 years older....it wasnt good.<br>  <br>  nothing in common, a decade almost 2 apart, he made me feel like a baby sometimes....<br>  <br>  i would say avoid it if possible, it can only lead to problems.|`|oKvyaIPSaa	love has no age but maturity does.|`|DIqqgNaVaa	there is nothing wrong with it if you are 18 or older|`|Jjjg7jcraa	I think that it depends on how old you are. A 16 year old dating a 32 year old isn't ok, you would have nothing in common. However a 40 year old dating a 56 year old, the age gap closes when you get older. It also depends on the maturity level of the two. When I was 21 I dated a 42 year old, but I was always mature for my age, and he was a very immature 42 year old...so it worked. The best thing to do is figure out how much you actually have in common, and if it's a lot...then age doesn't matter.|`|XSHLHq8saa	I think you are teenage and he is older. is it? well, if you need a friend maybe for this moment is ok. but you most expet at the future it is going to be longer. If you need money to feel save in life is it ok. but you most be more interesting in school. you take your time and do something for yourself and learn how to be win money in work by your self. not be hardfeeling pls. it is my way in experience of life. also not good english. do you speaks spanish?|`|oSSL1wKpaa	As long as both people are above the age of consent, then it isn't "wrong". However, the chances are that you'll have nothing in common with the other person.|`|DbHXMVZQaa	The age gap isn't as important as you age but if you're inyour early 20s or below then it is probably best to stick to your own age range. But then love isn't always rational.|`|SttRtZ1Kaa	I think they always be small problems.<br>  The younger you are may be more problems (ie 20years or younger.)<br>  The older you are, differences don't seem to matter (ie 30years & older.)|`|IGXashPvaa	It depends what age you are. If you are young, then its probably not a good idea.|`|ZpuU2h3daa	Love is love no matter what age or sex!

Why not do these things?  The Lord gives us good things to enjoy.|`|uK3tkaOJaa	This question had a very good point.  I'm serious!|`|dAt612NLaa	I believe that the purpose of life is life its self if that makes sense.  It is to not take anything or anyone for granted and make the best of your time here and doing things that make you happy.  If everyone up and decided that god was not real and realized that we are responsible for our actions and had to take care of each other and our earth things may be a little different. If you did not think that god has your life planned you may be a little more careful in everyday life.  The point of doing the things you listed is enjoying your time here, by doing things you enjoy, educating yourself about things and being able to have nice things that you like! Just my perspective.

However,our acquaintance with these feelings is not limited solely to the press; in daily life,we,too,frequently come across such problems and, more importantly, personally experience them. <br>  People and societies endeavour to liberate themselves from the distressing experiences,disorder and repressive social structures that have prevailed over the world for long periods. <br>  We only need to glance at ancient Greece; the Great Roman Empire; Tsarist Russia, or the so-called Age of Enlightenment, and even the 20th century-a century of misery which saw two world wars and world-wide social disasters. No matter upon which century or location you concentrate your research, the picture will not be appreciably different. <br>  If this is the case, why haven't people succeeded in solving these problems, or at least some efforts been made to remove such social diseases from society?<br>  People have encountered these problems in all ages, yet each time they have failed to find any solutions because the methods they employed were inappropriate. They sought various solutions, tried different political systems, laid down impracticable and totalitarian rules, stirred up revolutions or subscribed to perverted ideologies, while many others preferred to adopt an indifferent attitude and merely accepted the status quo. <br>  In our day, people are almost numbed by this way of living. They readily believe these problems to be "facts of life." They picture a society immune to these problems as being nothing short of impossible-a dream utopia. They persistently and openly express their distaste for such a way of living, yet easily embrace it, since they think they have no other alternative. <br>  The resolution of all these problematic issues is possible only by living by the principles of the "true religion." Only when the values of true religion prevail can a pleasant and tranquil scene replace this gloomy and unfavourable picture, which is doomed to continue so long as God's limits are ignored. To put it another way, people are enslaved by these complications as long as they avoid the values of the Qur'an. Put simply, this is the "nightmare of disbelief" and the link below for this wonderful book:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://fs.harunyahya.net/popup/Download.php?WorkNumber=256&Format=pdf" rel="nofollow">http://fs.harunyahya.net/popup/Download....</a><br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  you will find how the regulation of life by the "norms of morality" introduced by the Qur'an revealed to mankind by God will banish the "nightmare of disbelief," how pessimism, corruption and social restlessness can be eliminated from society, how the individual can surround himself with an ideal environment, what spiritual and material benefits he is likely to attain by adherence to these norms of morality are gone into in detail, and finally, that the unique alternative to all these problems is the morality of the Qur'an. <br>  So far, many books have attempted to deal with the social and psychological problems societies face. Yet, what distinguishes this book from others is its stress on the most realistic solution. It also sincerely warns people against the troublesome future they are likely to face if they fail to resort to this solution. <br>  We expect that every reader of conscience will grasp that peace, mutual trust and an ideal social life is attainable only by embracing the values of the Qur'an and will turn to the true religion, which is Islam. <br>  They will then happily join the ranks of those who never suffer, mentally or physically, from any of the above-mentioned complications. Around them, there will always be an abundance of favours, comfort, love, respect, peace and confidence, and moral virtues will prevail. They will know how to earn God's approval, by observing His limits and the commandments of the Qur'an. They will thus, by having faith in God, attain His mercy and at last enter Paradise. <br>  <br>  Useful link:<br>  (A BRIEF ILLUSTRATED GUIDE TO UNDERSTANDING ISLAM)<br>  <a href="http://www.islam-guide.com/islam-guide.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.islam-guide.com/islam-guide.p...</a><br>  <br>  DEEP THINKING (VIDEO):<br>  <a href="http://api.fmanager.net/api_v1/productDetail.php?dev-t=EDCRFV&objectId=1124" rel="nofollow">http://api.fmanager.net/api_v1/productDe...</a><br>   <br>  <br>  =* FOR ANY HELP FEEL FREE TO E-MAIL ME ON *=<br>  smiling4ever222@hotmail.com|`|f3nwI8ytaa	To the extent I'm able, I do.

NmQCYizTaa	I think it's to be expected that lesbians have more kids than gay guys, as gay guys dont have wombs, therefore have to find a surrogate or go through adoption. A gay woman, even if she is not attracted to men, is still perfectly able to have a 1NS with a guy and get pregnant, or to use a male friends sperm.

AA12006309	It depends. Did you send the video to anyone? If you did, then it's somewhere on their servers and they can look at it just fine, which might cause an investigation.

It's stupid anyways.|`|Ao52XHjCaa	Hmmm. Don't do that, please. The existence of child produced child pornography has created quite a stir recently, and local authorities aren't sure how to classify the perps, especially if the "perp" is the child him or herself. I wouldn't worry that the phone company is going to actively search your phone, especially since the service is shut off. However, anyone who gets their hands on that phone has access to a personal video of you. I wouldn't produce such a video and place it on something so easily lost and stolen, like a cell phone or laptop.

And it's likely that someone will save it, and show it to someone else.  That video could be around forever, and unless your family or friends see it, no one will ever know it's you, but think about it.

acbqsZZbaa	It is not logical to assert that "there is no god" since one cannot prove the non-existence of something that is not amenable to testing (Russell's teapot argument). Therefore, any logical atheist must admit the possibility of God, however vanishingly small that possibility might be.<br>  I would not describe that as "belief" in the possibility of God, since the word belief implies an element of faith, I would describe it as acceptance, admittance or recognition of the possibility of God.|`|LjsRfaskaa	Not an external male god, no. If there is a god it is a Universal Consciousness that act's in the same way our brain reacts to our bodies cells.

It is internal not external. It is genderless and universal.|`|ridu0Rtwaa	Sorry but you are way off and never been an atheist - you are an agnostic!!<br>  <br>  ATHEIST -  someone who does not believe in a God – any God – not just the Christian one.

Indeed anything that does not entail a god!!  Thus they can discus the concept of a god with people in a debate but the moment they consider one a possibility they are no longer and atheist!!<br>  <br>  AGNOSTIC – Does not believe anything can be know about or proved about a god.

People don't believe Zeus is real and have no doubt he is fictitious. People don't believe Ra is real and have no doubt that he is fictitious. I have that exact same way of thinking about the Christian God: I don't believe in God and have no doubt that he is fictitious.<br>  Any Christian can prove me wrong by saying there is a possibility that Zeus and Ra are real. Any of you wanna try that?<br>  <br>  EDIT<br>  Thank you for explaining your position. So, you do believe in the possibility of a god. Cool. That is called being an agnostic atheist. "An agnostic atheist is atheistic because he or she does not believe in the existence of any deity and is also agnostic because he or she does not claim to have definitive knowledge that a deity does not exist."*<br>  I was an agnostic atheist at your age. Gave up religion at 13, tried agnostic atheism for two years, then at 15 realized I was just hanging on to the possibility of a God as a faint hope, a vestigial delusion that my prior belief in God hadn't been because I was a fool. At 15, I realized I was a fool... there are no gods. Never have been, never will.|`|cZ3h1dffaa	Possibility?  Sure.  I accept it's possible.

f0JLp4hFaa	Yes, I believe so.<br>  <br>  The first answerer thinks ignorance is the opposite of intelligence.  But it isn't.  The worst evils are those done by intelligent people who are ignorant of the feelings and humanity of others.<br>  <br>  Certainly evil is much easier when you're dealing with an ignorant population.

The maximum hottest temperature that we know of is yet to be recorded. No man has found that maximum temperature yet. However, the coldest temperature we know of has been recorded; and is just over minus (-) 400 degrees. Therefore, Dear; cold is nothing more than the absence of heat. This brings us to your question. Evil is the result of nothing more than the absence of GOD in many peoples' lives! If you look into the lives of the criminals who commit their evil crimes; especially the crimes like in the true story we know as, "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre", you will find that these individuals never knew of GOD. In fact they weren't even taught anything about GOD and His ways. Jesus Christ is our Savior, Lord, and Redeemer. He is the "way, the truth and the life"; and we only have to accept Him and what He did for us to enter an eternity with GOD and live in His presence forever.<br>   Ms. Star, Honey;<br>       This is for you. Your belief is exactly what Satan wants you to believe. That is the true result of ignorance.

faceb0da83e7b433b86d3ae6836703f3aa	Yes.<br>  <br>  The reality is that we are sealed by the Holy Spirit unto the day of redemption.<br>  <br>  So, evil spirits can inluence us, but they can't possess us. Because we belong to Jesus and the Holy Spirit dwells in us. The love of God is in our heart.<br>  <br>  Ephesians6 writes about our spiritual armour. So read that & visualize it.<br>  <br>  And also, God disciplines us with evil spirits also. They are connected with hell. And Jesus said that if we critically judge others, we will be judged likewise. And judging others critically is also a form of unforgiveness. We judge others who don't go by our rules so don't forgive them, condemn them & gossip about them.<br>  So? Then the Lords prayer was to the Father to forgive us like we forgive others... And the Lord Jesus said that if we don't forgive others, the Father will turn us over to the tormentors.  These are spiritual demons, and also toxic emotions that wear on our health.<br>  <br>  So to protect our self... Submit to God (Pray, meditate on Gods Word, Ask God for wisdom, be still & listen, sing praises, worship in spirit & truth...)<br>  Resist the devil. Resist the destructive lusts of the flesh & make the soul choice to follow afte the Spirit, with fruits of faith, hope, love, honesty, truth, patience, etc... Don't give attention to the thoughts of the evil demons. Cast down every thought that exalts itself above Gods Word. Speak Gods Word over the lies of the devil.<br>  <br>  The devil runs away.<br>  <br>  We need to know who we are in Christ. That is studying Biblical Scripture on this. Like 'I am a Child of God, sealed unto the day of redemption. I am the head & not the tail. And the song.. He has given me authority to trample on snakes & scorpions. And to overcome all the power of the enemy. Nothing can harm me nothing. Nothing can harm me (A song made from scripture.). I'm Gods child & nothing can take me out of His hands. Just a few that come to mind. Greater is He who is in me than he who is in the world.  There is therefor now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus; For the law of the Spirit for those in Christ Jesus has set us free, from the law of sin & death. There is therefor, now no condemnation, for those who are in Christ Jesus. (Condemnation is from the evil one.) The Lord convicts us when we sin that brings forth the fuit of repentance. Condemnation condemn with no way out of the condemnation. Condemnation is like someone saying, 'You are a loser & always will be.'.<br>  <br>  Always thank God for His protection & plead Jesus shed blood over you & yours. For His Righteousness is why we are restored with the heart of God. Why we are Gods spiritual soul child.<br>  <br>  Also, when a curse comes our way, imagine a boomerang coming your way, dipped in the love of God, and returned to sender. This keeps us from receiving the curse, yet blessing those who curse us.<br>  <br>  When a demon attacks in a fear dream, etc. When you wake up, first ask God in prayer why the demon?... (Submit to God first. Repent if you opened the door to it in anyway. ). Then by the power of Jesus Name, bind the demon in weights & throw it into the abyss to wait till judgment day.|`|3l6DE1m0aa	Yes.  All humans, Christians or no, are influenced by a lot of forces in this mortal world, including other beings.  It can be said that the purpose of mortality is to overcome these influences and not be overcome by them.<br>  <br>  How can you protect yourself?  Not a short answer.  There are probably several actions you can take to protect yourself.  The most simple suggestion is probably the most powerful and don't overlook it -- pray for protection.<br>  <br>  God bless you.|`|gLyD1CiIaa	A believer can be influenced only by revealing himself to the demon. <br>  <br>  The devil is always on the lookout for the saints. As long as we are covered by the blood of the lamb and the word our testimony, we are protected. <br>  <br>  Yet, often times we open doors of sin which reveals to the devil and his demons where we are and what door of temptation makes us vulnerable.<br>  <br>  Although we cannot be possed by the demon as long as the Lord reigns in us, the longer we allow this demon or devil in our lives, the more the possibility we could lose our salvation. <br>  <br>  For a man cannot sup at the table of the Lord and the table of his enemy. The man will hate one and love the other.|`|Cld0jeiXaa	Dude you guys are crazy, seriously Demons. How self involved you must be to believe that there is some huge Angel/Demon battle going on for your soul. Live your life and enjoy what has been placed infront of you. This is it.

Then we need to put on the WHOLE armor of God.<br>  <br>  Eph. 6:13-17  Therefore take up (once forever) the whole armor of God, that you may be able to withstand (temptation) in the evil day, and having done all, to STAND.  14  STAND therefore, having girded your waist with TRUTH, having put on the breastplate of RIGHTEOUSNESS,  15  and having shod your feet with the preparation of the GOSPEL OF PEACE;  16  above all taking the shield of FAITH with which you will be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked one.  17  And take the helmet of SALVATION, and the SWORD OF THE SPIRIT, which is the word of God.<br>  <br>  Verses 13 and 14 use the word "stand."  We are in a spiritual battle we can't be lazy and lying around.  We have to STAND and fight constantly lest the evil one overcome us and makes us ineffective for God to use.  Have you ever watched a boxing match?  The fighters are not sitting or resting on their laurels ... they are STANDING and doing battle.  We have to picture ourselves as God's boxers and be ever ready to do battle.|`|247e16fe699fb80e444deaffc4762c81aa	yes, we are often influenced<br>  <br>  protection:<br>  regular feeding on the word, worship/prayer, fellowship

GAyy1wBgaa	There are so many questions that we humans have no answer to, ie., - death, love (what is true love, etc). Religion is just an 'answer' to these questions, telling people not to be afraid of the unknown, because they have a god to believe in, who, if praised and worshipped will provide them with salvation and eternal peace. <br>  Me, I don't believe. Not because I don't want to, I simply can't, as you said, believe in something there's no proof of. I also think religion can be too imposing... Like those mormons who call to your door, telling you you're going to suffer in hell if you don't take their pamphlets. <br>  I'm probably a Catholic-Atheist - went (still goes to) Catholic schools, and the prayers ceremonies never made sense, nor did they ever answer my questions or put me at ease when it came to death. <br>  But, in the dark of night, every atheist half believes.|`|yvmZBQ0baa	I agree with you, but i think there are too many religions, and its so hard to believe al of them or just one could be right, so it only makes sense that none are real.  Also how could a gog become a god.  Was he appointed by another god, if so why dont we worship that god.  what i really dont understand is why people go to church, if there was really a god, we wouldnt waste an hour each sunday praying to him,not that its pysicly possible for him to care about each individual person for any time.|`|ShwV6Ewfaa	I think its quite obvious why people believe in god after all every one likes the idea of someone looking out for them and someone to guide them through hard times and not everyone has friends and family do they and that's a very sad thought and if those people can find comfort in believing in god if it gives them peace and makes them happy who exactly is that hurting|`|9lT4e8Efaa	Because we are afraid, afraid of living life knowing there is nothing looking after us, afraid that when we die we simply cease to exist and  our souls don't go to heaven for all eternity. Religion is evil (and Im aware many people won't like this or agree with it), the world would be a far better place without it. It is corrupt and totally brainwashes people. I think people need to grow up and stop living in a childish dream world, and get a better grip of reality, there is nothing no life after death, there is no-one watching over us and there is no god. <br>  This is just my opinion, I respect everyones views and faiths, and if religion helps them become better people and have a happier life then good for them|`|Ps0tDYBAaa	for comfort and to have peace of mind in their lives and for their own existence to make sense to them.|`|1z7M3Tntaa	Well for me It's just from personal exeriences that has caused me to believe, and there's plenty of proof,  people just dont want to believe it.|`|Gsd4VD13aa	Because they are weak, foolish, lazy, and unwilling to become anything else.

Haha just kidding i don't believe in that bullshit.|`|AA10641825	Because it feels good.|`|355JLlcLaa	Faith in God is based upon nothing but itself. Science, including the theory of evolution, explain nature satisfactorily without needing supernatural beings. Religious beliefs are no different to those of ancient beliefs in gods and goddesses. <br>  <br>  Belief in a god and hence religions probably goes back to times when people didn't understand how the seasons worked. And when winter came and the crops no longer grew, some sort of sacrifice would have been made to the sun, and then it came back and the crops grew. The people would have associated the sacrifice with the positive outcome, and they wouldn't have dared not do it again because they couldn't risk famine.<br>  <br>  In time the sacrifice will have become more sophisticated, and perhaps the idea came about that the sun might be the gift of a god rather than the god itself. This might be a way, or similar to a way, that religion developed. <br>  <br>  People would then have assumed that the laws that their ancestors devised came from the god, so the religion would have become even more sophisticated still, providing authority for the laws and fear of a vengeful god if laws were disobeyed, and the same fear would make others stone to death anyone who breached a law to avoid vengeance being visited on the whole community. <br>  <br>  There are probably other elements, but it will have gone back to the dawn of civilisation.<br>  <br>  The idea of the biblical God changes throughout the course of the Bible as does the name, and there seem to be several changes of Deity. For example, when Moses encounters God, God introduces himself as Yahweh (I am who am, I will be what I will be, etc), which is a different name to that used at the beginning of Genesis, Elohim, a plural of El a Canaanite (Phoenician) deity (I'll leave to others to consider whether the plural implies more than one supernatural being, or just a convention that expresses respect and awe); continuity with previous beliefs is maintained by claiming to be the God of Abraham, Jacob (Israel) and Isaac. In fact the first Creation myth in Genesis probably derives from the Babylonian Creation Epic, Enuma Elish in which the Creator God's name is Marduk, probably via the Canaanites.|`|CcHUacLPaa	You are currently breathing God's air.

It doesn't mean he's a "coward" and I HATE that expression so much because it can Really hurt someone. It just takes longer for some people to come out to family for example. He may have an intolerant family or he may think that they'll just not understand. He may even be like me, "It's just no one else's business" because it really isn't. Sexuality isn't something that should be flaunted. See, I don't go around telling people that I'm gay; but if they were to ask me if I were gay, I would say, "yes I am gay." I don't really care who knows, but I'm not going broadcast the fact that I am gay because that's not who I am. It's just a part of me and that's all. <br>  <br>  Just give him some time. Please show him how much you love him and just be patient with him. Let him come up with his own way of letting people know. Strategies are different for different people and don't rush him or make him feel uncomfortable because that will be the ONE thing that will interrupt your relationship with him. If you really love him, you will be patient and get through it :)|`|QZvvHp3iaa	I've been in similar situations and to tell you the truth it just didn't work, at least in my case. I was out since 16 and that put off a few guys who I've been with who weren't out or were only out to close friends only. I make a point not to date guys who are in the closet because to me that is cowardly and I will not be forced to live in their closet with them. You have to make sure that is ok with you, if you don't mind being called whatever girl name he comes up with when you both are on the phone or introduces you as a friend to everyone then fine, that's your prerogative. This guy could be a great guy, but he has issues with who he is and you are being tangled into that and there is nothing you can as a boyfriend for him. I'm telling you from my experience it will come between you. And if your boyfriend wants to keep a great understanding guy like you around, then he needs to be more respectful of your feelings. Bottom line, this relationship is in your hands, cause if the pressure was on and his family/friends suspected the two of you were an item he will cut you without thinking about it; just so he remains 'clean'. Think about it.

Being betrayed is only a thought, a word....sometimes the other can see something coming before it happens and it is better to not question it, but accept is as it is...even if it hurts because you know feeling hurt is better then something more, knowing you have committed a great error, sin. And maybe they are thanking God because they where able to discern the situation and had the strength to address it and change the situation,before further hurt was imposed to either party or led to something even more disastrous.....not only for themselves, but you more so.

DtlQawvgaa	The first president and founder of the Watchtower Organization, Charles Taze Russell taught and believed that only 144, 000 people called Spiritual Israel would go to heaven. Of course, this out-gathering started in "C.E".33. Some of his followers would consequently be part of this elite class of Christians. He died in 1916. <br>  <br>  He was succeeded by Judge Joseph Franklin Rutherford who,  embraced most of what Russell taught with some modifications. The 144,000 idea however, was still a major doctrine of the cult. By the year 1919 the membership rose to 4,000 and by 1939 reached 73,000. <br>  <br>  In the early 1930's Rutherford anticipated rapid growth of the organization and visualized the membership rising beyond 144,000. This would complicate the original doctrine of only 144,000 people being candidates for citizenship in heaven. <br>  <br>  Rutherford was now confronted with a big problem. What was to be done with the prospective members coming into the organization that would exceed 144,000? Being that some of this elite group had already been chosen by Jehovah God during some 1900 years of the Common Era since the death of Jesus Christ, something had to be done fast ! <br>  <br>  A bright light flashed up in the mind of Rutherford as what to do about this dilemma. So, at the Washington, D.C. Convention of Jehovah's Witnesses, May 31, 1935, he made an astounding announcement. Anyone coming into the organization from that day on would compose an earthly class of Christians. <br>  <br>  This earthly class would be called "The Great Crowd", and would spend eternity on a new righteous "Paradise Earth" with no hope of ever going to heaven. Some members were still part of the remnant totaling 144,000 called the "Little Flock" of anointed Christians and could go to heaven .<br>  <br>  The Bible unquestionably speaks of a "new heavens and a new earth." However, contrary to the Watchtower's teaching, the prophecy in Revelation is clear that the new earth is post-millennial, after the resurrection and final judgment. All these events, which the Watchtower Society places from the beginning and during the "Millennium," were plainly prophesied to occur "after the thousand years have ended" in Revelation 20:5 through 21:5.  Although Watchtower writers frequently apply Bible texts about the "new earth" to their particular doctrine, the verses invariably have no relevance to the thousand-year time prophecy of Revelation. <br>  <br>  God Bless!|`|hR7OsqtRaa	2 Timothy 3:16<br>  All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness.<br>  <br>  Galatians 1:11-12<br>  I want you to know, brothers, that the gospel I preached is not something that man made up.

So I will address one or two every chance I get. Basically, it should be pointed out that all such Trinitarian “proof texts” and arguments require a ignorance of Scriptural terms, context and Hebrew and Greek grammar. Every text she cites requires that an interpretation be “read into” the scripture which contradicts the immediate context as well as the greater context of Biblical teaching regarding God and Christ.<br>  <br>  Answers to Sunsandnrain:<br>  <br>  Your claim that Jesus is Almighty God because he said "I Am" is a result of faulty and misleading research. This claim is the result of an ignorance of the Bible caused to a great degree by those who have removed the Divine Name. First, the translation "I Am that I Am" is a mistranslation of the Greek "EGO EIMI hO ON" which is in turn a mistranslation of the Hebrew "EHYEH ASHER EHYEH." A more accurate translation would be "I will be what I will be" such as Rotherham's & the footnotes of the NRSV and NIV-1984.<br>  <br>  On top of being misled by these mistranslations most people do not see that in the very next verse (Ex.3:15) God states that Jehovah/Yehowah is the name by which he will be known eternally, not "I Am."<br>  <br>  This is why the Trinitarian argument linking John 8:58 with Ex.3 is invalid. It is based on a falsehood; It is based on the incorrect translation of the Septuagint, not the inspired Hebrew words. Further, the noun identifying God in the Septuagint was "hO ON" not "EGO EIMI/I am" which is a verb. Jesus did not use hO ON which is something even Trinitarian scholars recognize, but as usual they leave their flock in ignorance allowing them to continue relying on such false evidence. If “I Am” was an exclusive title for Almighty God then what did it mean when the once-blind man used the very same words in the very next chapter (Jn.9:9)?<br>  <br>  1. Did Thomas’ words say that Jesus was equal to Almighty God? No. First, if Thomas did address Jesus as God, this cannot mean he understood Jesus to be equal to Almighty God. Jehovah’s Witnesses have no argument that Jesus is called “God” several times in the Bible. However, we also know that in the Bible "God" is a title applied to angels, the Devil and men too (Ex.7:1, Ps.8:5; 82:1,6, Jn.10:34). The words “My Lord and my God” was a common address at the time of Christ for rulers, but never with the understanding that the Emporers were equal to Almighty God.<br>  <br>  Most important of all we cannot force John to contradict himself and John knew Jesus was the "Son of God" (Jn.20:31), and that Jesus had a God over him. Jn.20:17. (The Bible speaks of Jesus having a God over him at least 17 times after he went to heaven!)<br>  <br>  Therefore, the argument that Jesus must be equal to Almighty God because he was called “God” is faulty because it demands and ignorance of the way the term “God” was used in Bible times and it contradicts every explicit scripture which shows that Jesus was less than Almighty God at every point of his existence (Jn. 14:28; 20:17; Mk.13:32; 1Cor.15:27,28;  Rev.3:2,12). At the highest position he will ever attain, Jesus is still "subject" to *GOD* the same way we are "subject" to him.<br>  <br>  2. When Heb.1:8 calls Jesus “God” does it mean that Jesus is equal to Almighty God? No. The context clearly shows that Jesus cannot not be equal to Almighty God. First, vs 9 says Christ has a God over him! God had to subject all things under him (1:13; 2:5,8) and he was "appointed" to his position by *God* (1:2,7; 3:2). He is said to be "God's son" (1:2,5,6,8,), God's "firstborn" (1:6), God is his "father" (1:5), and he is the "reflection" and "image" of God, not God himself (1:3). He is "at God's right hand" (1:3,13). He "obtained" a better name (1:4), he was "anointed" by his superior, God (1:9) etc. etc.<br>  <br>  Also the translation is questionable: "It is not certain whether Ho Theos is here the vocative (...with the Messiah termed theos...) or theos is nominative (subject or predicate) with estin (is) understood: 'God is thy throne', or 'thy throne is God'."—A.T. Robertson; Word pictures in the N.T.<br>  <br>  The Trinitarian interpretation is proved to be false since this is a quote from Ps. 45:6,7 which is speaking of David. If the Trinitarians’ interpretation were correct then it would mean that David was God. However, just because the human king is called 'God', this does not mean he is the equal of Jehovah. He was addressed as 'God' in the same sense as the angels and the judges of Judah were. Being called "God" did not make them Jehovah; nor elevate them to a position equal to Jehovah. The same is true of the Son when he is called “God.” Only by keeping people in ignorance of these facts can Trinitarians continue to twist these scriptures to mean what they want.<br>  <br>  4. Because the phrase “Call upon the name of the LORD" is used in reference to Jehovah in the O.T. and then is applied to Jesus in the N.T. does not mean that they are the same or equal. For example, the term “morning star” (PHOSPHOROS) is only used of Satan in the O.T. but in the N.T. it is applied to Jesus. According to the logic of this argument Jesus must be Satan!! (Isa.14:12; 2Pet.1:19).<br>  <br>  This type of warped logic is standard for Trinitarian arguments. First, it only works if we ignore the fact that we have TWO names here, Jehovah and Jesus. In Psalms it is “Call upon the name of Jehovah,” and in Corinthians it is “call on the name of the Lord Jesus Christ.” It is explicitly not talking about the same individual but clearly identifies which “Lord” is being spoken about! This is hidden from those who have translations which remove the name Jehovah from their bibles.<br>  <br>  If we read the very next sentence we see that Paul could not possibly be saying that the “Lord Jesus” is identical to the “LORD God” because Jesus is grammatically separated from God: “Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.” The context through verse 9 shows that we always have two individuals here, and according to all of Paul’s statements the Lord Jesus is never the same as, nor equal to, Almighty God (Rom.15:6; 1Cor.8:6; 11:3; 15:24-28;  2Cor.1:3; Heb.1:7-9; 2:7,8).<br>  <br>  Only if we rely upon a faulty translation, faulty logic and ignore the context of Scripture can we interpret this to be speaking of the same individual.<br>  <br>  This argument also deceptively makes a false claim, demanding an ignorance on the part of its hearers. It claims that this terminology is only used of God. This is not true. In Hebrew it is used of calling on the names of false Gods (Ex.31:2; 1Ki.18:26). Just because it applies the same phrase to Jesus does this mean he is the same as these false Gods? Paul also used the same Greek verb when he “called upon Caesar.” Because Paul “calls upon Caesar” and also “calls upon Jesus” does it mean that they are the same? Only if we accept the faulty logic of Trinitarians.<br>  <br>  Jesus had to be "MADE Lord" and he had to be GIVEN an exalted Name and Authority (Acts 2:36; Php 2:9-11; Matt 28:18). So he cannot be the Almighty who always was the Most High We “call upon” Jesus because he is our only way to God as the mediator between God and men (1 Tim 2:5).<br>  <br>  Trinitarians love to state that Jesus was “God manifested in flesh.” While this statement is found in the KJV at 1Tim 3:16, most modern Bibles do not say this. Because the word "god" is known to be a spurious addition to the Scriptures made by Trinitarians desperate for Scriptural backing when they could find none (Rev. 22:18).<br>  <br>  IF JESUS IS ALMIGHTY GOD...<br>  <br>  1. Then how could he be WITH God (ho theos)? (Jn.1:1)<br>  2. Then how can he have a God? Could Almighty God have a God? (Mic.5:4, Ps.45:6,7; 89: 26, Jn.20:17, Rom.15:6, Rev.1:6; 3:2,12)<br>  3. Then why is he subject to GOD, like we're subject to him? (1Cor.15:27,28, Eph 1:17)<br>  4. Then why does Jesus not know what God knows? (Mat. 24:36, Rev.1:1, Lk.8: 45)<br>  5. Then why is Jesus still subject to God when he is as high as he will ever be? (1Cor.15:27,28)<br>  6. Then why is he not powerful enough to subject things to himself? (1Cor.15:27, Eph.1:17,22)<br>  7. Then why would he have to be GIVEN any power and authority? (Mt.28:18; 11:27, Jn. 5:22; 17:2; 3:35; 2Pet.1:17)<br>  8. Then why did he have to LEARN anything? (Heb.5:8, Jn.5:19; 8:28)<br>  9. Then why is speaking against him not as bad as speaking against the Holy Spirit? (Mt.12:31,32, Lk.12:10)<br>  10. Then why did he need to be saved? (Heb.5:7, Jn.12:27)<br>  11. Then why did he have to be EXALTED to Leader and Savior? (Ac.5:31)<br>  12. Then how could he be EXALTED and GIVEN a higher name than he had?

If you want to prove how talented you are, its best to DO things which show that rather than talk about it, because no one likes it rubbed in their face. <br>  make a conscious effort to ask people question about themselves eg how r u etc. <br>  sometimes i think well if people aint gonna talk...i might as well talk! and thats not a problem i dont think lol|`|NnFltKgsaa	this is an evolution of your personality and to become more open minded see the world as if it was the first time and try to understand it as it is and not through you own biases.

My belief is that you are ok, do keep in mind that we all are not perfect, and often we are like "the blind men and an elephant". Do keep an open mind on things that you are not sure of, read widely, mix with broadminded people and off course, even respect narrow-minded people's right to keep their believes.|`|VUo09gpuaa	It means that you do not look at the wider picture of a situation or perhaps an opinion and are not open to suggestion - and we are not all from London - we are from a very much wider area - the world!|`|pE0XKXbWaa	Being narrow minded means that you have your view point and that's it.

HC7MS1vQaa	This all revolves around you really. I can tell you what you can do, but its only if you're willing. Being manly, is only a stereotypical view of a male figure. Thus creating this view that all men have to BE manly or else they are a "girl". To stand your ground, you just have to suck up the fear, or whatever it is that you're going through at the moment, and try and keep a calm view on things. Take for instance fighting, if someone were to be in a fight, two things would happen, your body will prepare you to flee or remain there and fight. Both are your choice. Now, think of it this way, if a situation is too dangerous then you will flee, or you will remain there. Same thing goes for Standing your ground. Now if we're talking about argument wise, and keeping your opinion, obviously no one can change it but yourself. But, the only problem is I don't understand, in your terms, what you mean by manly or standing your ground. It was a very vague description, but I do hope this helped just a wee bit. I apologize if I came off rude or offensive in anyway, this was only meant to help.|`|kcpcbGItaa	Self confidence goes a long way to helping that out.

Feel it until you get used to it<br>  Put on a mask. Pretend not to be hurt. Control your tears, don't cry. Don't let them out. Show the world that as if nothing had changed and that you are strong. Pretend that you do not care about it anymore. <br>  Pretend that everything is ok, when it is not. Move on through life and pretend that that period did not exist. Burn that crazy shirt, and change sim card.<br>  After all, life is about moving on and seeing new things. not dwelling on the past hurts|`|YGYMocGRaa	thats simply the way it is. people lie, cheat, kill and betray. what did u expect?|`|KCnaL3dTaa	I think what you need to do is move on, if she didn't love you than you need to go out, take time to be single and enjoy it.

I don't know, depends how u we're with her n how u feel about her, maybe completely ignoring would be good, or still keeping friends, but i dont think the latter one wud be a gud idea. Maybe on your anniversary u cud take her the shirt and let u know how much u love her. Write all of ur feelings down and then give them 2 her that nite. Oganise before the date, just say u want 2 see her to speak about things. Then u cud try to get the love back, but be prepared for more heartbreak.

EAuMJrs4aa	because , hmmm which god?<br>  <br>  why do we need a god isnt basic human descency enough to make the mayority of people good people, why does one need such archaic concepts in this day and age|`|RQvLrKMXaa	The reason, in my opinion, this conflict will never end is because after the end of WWII, The Jews were given the land known as Israel, which was in fact Palestinian land and we, the USA have guaranteed their existence ever since.  Which is wrong on our part.  It's way past time to stop supporting Israel and it's war-mongering ways.  I'm not Muslim, by the way.  In fact I don't believe in the islamic way at all!|`|UH1ipgJmaa	They are destined to keep on fighting till the Anti-Christ comes & establishes peace.|`|ec0b60fee25a982ef565651fd4f465d1aa	Can you say free will? I know you can.|`|iblT1HJpaa	Sorry. <br>  They don't believe in the God of Peace but the God of Wrath. <br>  The God of Israel and the God of Islam is not the God of Christianity. They all had the same roots (Abraham) but the Jews and Muslims have subverted the truth of God into various forms of Law. <br>  God does not want LAW! He wants relationship and this is through Jesus Christ. <br>  We cannot have relationship to God except through Jesus. <br>  You will never see peace in the middle east until God comes down and makes HIS PEACE! <br>  Just wait..................|`|o4zAMlCoaa	Because it was destined that there will never be real peace in the Middle East. God could end it if He wanted to, but it's all ready set up according to how God wanted it.|`|QyAyQf3Laa	Big@ss Brown said it all pretty much.<br>  <br>  I agree with her.|`|S4XUl7qWaa	For the same reason I can't sprout feathers and fly off the roof of my house, and my car can't come inside and cook me a five course meal.<br>  <br>  Everything is not possible.

Such things must come, but woe to the man through whom they come!<br>  <br>  With God, everything is possible. Because there is sin in the world, there is evil as until we see the End of Days, we will live through a sinful world as each of us are sinners. <br>  <br>  Romans 3:23<br>  For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God,|`|0VkZ70f2aa	because maybe it's not what's best right now.. maybe in the long run they needed this war.  Truth is, you probably won't know the reason until you go to heaven, just know that there is a reason and GOD has an amazing plan for you and everyone else.  with GOD, everything is possible, doesn't mean that everything good will happen in your favor. sometimes GOD tests us to see what we can and can't handle.  We just have to stay strong and keep our faith!  I'll pray for you! GOD BLESS!|`|j1vjNjDiaa	The war IsReal, but the palestine-ISRAEL war does not end until YHWH GOD says it does & no they do not believe in the same GOD.|`|E870WbAsaa	You know "ego" is worst and biggest friendly enemy being worshiped as god   :)|`|YUAegpPoaa	On this one we are in agreement I think. God doesn't have anything to do with the Israel-Palestine conflict.|`|mr0Hb5fvaa	read the book of revelations, it talks all about why the war cant end until jesus returns|`|UEA4Uli9aa	Obviously god doesn't want the war to end.|`|qfSKgxDsaa	B/c they attacked us and we have to defend our country!  With time it will end, but right now we have to defend ourselves!|`|kml4wGw4aa	All things in due time my dear.|`|SxwhZ7Xxaa	somethings happen for certain reasons and maybe what the Palestine's are fighting over is over our head maybe their fighting about what you talking about here.<br>  <br>  well all i can say is with good comes bad that's just how the world functions <br>  and god does say there will always people that are poor,people that are starving|`|GsFllX0Eaa	just because anything is possible with God doesn't necessarily mean God wants them to stop fighting and by that i mean :<br>   <br>  1) maybe he has a greater purpose, meaning maybe something will come out of the war<br>  2) we do have free will and if we choose to fight, we will fight<br>  <br>  the whole thing is kind of complicated actually it gets into the predestination thing. there are a lot of good arguments for both sides out there. as to the fact that they are both staunch believers in god, well their gods are different gods. for instance its like comparing someone who worships God to someone who worships Satan/the devil both say they are worshiping their god. thats why they fight. they insist that their god is the true god. and that because their god is the true god, they should dominate the land.<br>   i know its confusing and i cant explain it very well, but i hope that helps a little.|`|1721e094abd49bbc7f2c2d4889d463b0aa	Because the Arab/Israeli conflict must continue to the end of this age, culminating with the Battle of Armageddon. After this war, Jesus will reign over the earth for a thousand years with a rod of iron.|`|XZOgfxYJaa	Everything happens for a reason and it is not your place to question why God does what he does...<br>  <br>  This is a less extreme example but..say you over sleep and miss an important test, at the time you would be very mad and think it is the worst thing in the world. But, then you turn on the news later and find out there was a drunk driver on the highway who killed 5 people...you were saved|`|1pFcDyeDaa	First, you need to understand that both parties believe in a DIFFERENT God.  And that is the crux of the problem.  <br>  <br>  The God of Israel does not tell the Israelis to "kill the infidel."  They are merely defending their land and people.<br>  <br>  Yehudi|`|fjidmhxsaa	Matt 19:26. I think you all need to understand the Bible verse and not misinterpret the Bible.<br>  <br>  Jesus had said that a camel could more easily go through the eye of a needle than a rich man enter the kingdom of God (Matthew 19:24). Both are impossible. "Blessed be ye poor," Jesus said, "for yours is the kingdom of God" (Luke 6:20). One must at least be willing to give up his possessions before he can enter the kingdom<br>  <br>  For peace to prevail, both sides must be willing to broker peace. But going by the Bible again, the story (conflicts) between the two sides go way back to the days of Abraham. Days of Old.|`|MqLxwsw7aa	Doesn't that tell you that all parties (you forgot to mention the Christian supporters) are not in compliance with Holy Law?<br>  <br>  It should!|`|PEUwnGHraa	Well, both parties say they believe in God but look at their actions. Do these people show that they so believe and are doing the "will" of God? No, for they are both committing violence and though we can see that one side is not as much as fault as the other, the only way man seems to resolve things is through bloodshed, murder and war.<br>  <br>  Furthermore, God has a set time when he will enact his "war on justice" and it will be a war that puts an end to all of mankind's wars. This war of God's will be Armageddon, for at that time, God will send his Son, Jesus to destroy all wicked humans in the earth. This war of God's will be a total war and there will be no more of mankind's wars, not ever again. Furthermore, Jesus will destroy all of Satan's governments in the world; all of mankind's governments because they are being run by Satan.<br>  <br>  EPHESIANS 6: 10 - 15<br>  <br>  Finally, go on acquiring power in [the] Lord and in the mightiness of his strength. Put on the complete suit of armor from God that YOU may be able to stand firm against the machinations of the Devil; because we have a wrestling, not against blood and flesh, but against the governments, against the authorities, against the world rulers of this darkness, against the wicked spirit forces in the heavenly places. On this account take up the complete suit of armor from God, that YOU may be able to resist in the wicked day and, after YOU have done all things thoroughly, to stand firm. Stand firm, therefore, with YOUR loins girded about with truth, and having on the breastplate of righteousness, and with YOUR feet shod with the equipment of the good news of peace.<br>  --------------------<br>  <br>  Governments of the World<br>  <br>  Daniel 2: 44 tells us:<br>  <br>  “And in the days of those kings the God of heaven will set up a kingdom that will never be brought to ruin. And the kingdom itself will not be passed on to any other people. It will crush and put an end to all these kingdoms, and it itself will stand to times indefinite.<br>  ------------------------<br>  <br>  Lastly, it seems like you're trying to blame God for man's choices to do evil. ALL OF US WERE CREATED WITH FREE WILL and most humans are choosing to do what is wrong. Please note what James has admonished:<br>  <br>  James 1: 12 - 15<br>  <br>  Happy is the man that keeps on enduring trial, because on becoming approved he will receive the crown of life, which GOD promised to those who continue loving him. When under trial, let no one say: “I am being tried by God.” For with evil things God cannot be tried nor does he himself try anyone. But each one is tried by being drawn out and enticed by his own desire. Then the desire, when it has become fertile, gives birth to sin; in turn, sin, when it has been accomplished, brings forth death. <br>  -------------------------<br>  <br>  We know that man makes his own choices, but soon there will not be time for man/women to change their course of life because Armageddon will be upon us. Peter makes mention of this very time and I mentioned it above several times... Armageddon, God's war against all wickedness in the earth.<br>  <br>  2 Peter 3: 8 - 10<br>  <br>  "However, let this one fact not be escaping YOUR notice, beloved ones, that one day is with GOD as a thousand years and a thousand years as one day. GOD is not slow respecting his promise, as some people consider slowness, but he is patient with YOU because he does not desire any to be destroyed but desires all to attain to repentance. Yet GOD'S day will come as a thief..."<br>  ---------------<br>  <br>  Not even Jesus knows of this day of Armageddon. He knows he will return a 2nd time to earth to enact God's war, but he does not even know the day himself. Jesus said "Only the Father knows".|`|FOzN3xwzaa	The truth is that Jesus is God. <br>  <br>  And, it will be antichrist that will, in the future, come and make a false "peace" deal with Israel, with which antichrist will deceive many.|`|IIxy6ATwaa	It will end once the palestinians stop firing rockets into israel and israel stop robbing the land of palestinians.|`|c5ffa63bef1a57e12459947bb46f6b28aa	They have nothing better to do (and when I say they I mostly mean Palestinians - the Israelis seem to have actually built an economy of some substance).<br>  <br>  God really doesn't care being preoccupied with existential problems of his own.|`|d4ab69OKaa	Everything is possible? You, along with 99.999% of people here, don't understand the general concept of God.|`|5rP0zBudaa	Belief in god is the cause of the problems not a potential solution.|`|U7QZW11aaa	I guess that proves that he isn't how people think he his.|`|lU285qgSaa	Because it is not about God ... He got left behind|`|pmbHveQGaa	Who said it can't end? Everything for a reason, many time in the Bible there is reference to God allowing us to continue sinning, thus allowing it to get worse and worse, for the sole purpose of having "proof" to show us that we are imperfect and heavy sinners so we will be more likely to fear the Lord.<br>  <br>  In the story of Abraham attempting to get the king of Egypt to let his people go, the king knew it would be better for him to let them go, and was willing to let them go, however every time he started to agree to let them go, The Lord hardened his heart so he wouldn't let them go, then, much later the Lord destroyed the king and his whole army because of there many sins - as an example to what could happen to sinners.<br>  <br>  The point ~ It is impossible to know what Gods reasons are, but we do know this; God has a reason for everything, and in the end everything will turn out right.<br>  <br>  Everything mortal eventually ends, including war, it's just up to God as to 'When' these things end.|`|LXNgztljaa	Because God wants ut to solve out own problems. both sidesbelieve in god but Paletine wantscomplete control over isreals lands due to the sudden bloom in plant products there. (sorry, brain shuts down after 1 AM.) This being said, Paleestine doesn't believe in the same god isreal does. Isreal wwants no war, perod. They don't care of Palestine settles on their land but they want a working society. Palestine wants te lad and mostly, th dome of the rock thati s on that land. <br>  So, until those disputes are ended God won'rt end it becausehes given us the capabilities to be peaceful, we choos enot to be peaceful though.|`|8494c081be43cef45fec2115b09ddb15aa	Yes all things are possible, but there is a reason for everything that does happen. This war was prophesied in the bible and the prophecy must come to pass. There is a certain sequence of events that MUST take place before the end of time. Read Revelations.<br>  God can make everything happen but his thoughts are not our thoughts. Or minds are so small that we can't see/understand God's master plan. 1+1=2 but God says 1+1=1, in marriage that is. <br>  We have to trust and believe. He knows what he's doing!|`|S9jmWU7Yaa	One of God's gift to men is free will.<br>  The men are the ones who refuse to stop attacking each other. God could stop it, but that would be taking away our free will.<br>  <br>  And just for the record, just because they believe in God doesn't mean that they believe in the RIGHT God.<br>  The Muslims that are participating in the Palestinian war believe that God WANTS them to attack Israel.|`|c4214bf572837db9664885f65d833b03aa	Yes, with god, everything is possilbe. And to anwer you question why can't Israel-Palestine war end? Well, thats because god wants to be this way. God plans everything for each individual and as a whole as well. This is part of life, we are living under gods will and he chooses what happens and what does not.<br>  <br>  But In a politic way, this war wont end because its part of the U.S/U.K New World Order (NWO). Im not sure if your familiar with the NWO, if not, i suggest you look in to it. It will answer all your questions like this. The NWO are trying to get all the countries in the world, to be under one governemt. Europe has done it, with its Union. U.S.A is doing it as we speak without citizens knowing, US and Canada and Mexico will be ONE LAND and no more borders. No one knows this, but its happening now as we speak.<br>  <br>  I hope these answers your questions.|`|EpkDA2FOaa	I'll tell you something..Read the Bible..Revalation..it's all end-time prophecy, this war has to happen my friend..you'll prlly get alot of crap from atheists and junk, but trust me..just read it and research Rev. for yourself..don't listen to what people say..not even me..do the research and see for yourself.

wTB9xTvDaa	orthodox, catholic, and mainline: appropriate styles of preaching<br>  Evangelical: innappropriate styles.|`|srUuoCwcaa	To clarify (it's a bit of a semantics issue, but it will sound better in the future: Orthodox and Catholics are not "denominations" in the technical sense, as denominations are usually subsets of Protestantism; rather, they are churches within the Christian tradition).<br>  <br>  Catholics and Orthodox give short sermons called homilies. These homilies aim to expound upon the scripture readings, which change based on the ecclesial calendar, and are not the focal point of the divine liturgy. They seek to better relay the truths of the gospel to the congregation, but always take a backseat role to the celebration of the Eucharist.<br>  <br>  Mainline Protestantism can be the same, or very similar, at times (Anglicans, Episcopalians, many Lutherans, etc.) but more often than not play a more pre-eminent role in the mass or service. Their themes usually correlate to scripture readings (again, like Catholics and Orthodox, these readings are usually set already) and may cover a broad range of themes and issues.<br>  <br>  Finally, with evangelicals, there can be no denying whatsoever that the sermon is the crux of the service. It usually lasts up to a half hour or more (compared with a 10-20 minute homily) and in this case, the pastor usually chooses the readings himself. They can be very emotionally charged, perhaps even perceived as aggressive if one has never experience this before, and usually take a conservative stance on pressing social issues and occasionally drawn from numerous other sources in agreement with the pastor's message (that is, relevent, usually contemporary, books, things of that nature).<br>  <br>  All have their converging points. My advice is to visit various churches if you want to see first-hand. Eastern Orthodox churches (whether they be Russian, Greek, etc.) can usually be found in large cities; Catholic parishes virtually everywhere, but city-based cathedrals are always the most sublime experience; mainline Protestant denoms (Methodist, Lutheran, Episcopalian) in most suburban areas and cities in the North; and evangelical churches (Church of Christ, Baptists, Pentecostals, non-denominational, etc.) are sown throughout the South, but every area has SOME, I'm sure, within a reasonable distance.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|0puMsQJgaa	Simple Answer!<br>  <br>  (1Corinthians 1:18)  For the preaching of the cross = is foolishness = to those being lost,=  but to us being saved, = it is the power of God.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.gty.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.gty.org/</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.e-sword.net/" rel="nofollow">http://www.e-sword.net/</a><br>  <br>  Thanks for Asking!  RR|`|FOzN3xwzaa	Labels don't save.  Catholicism and orthodox cannot save anyone.  <br>  <br>  Only believing in JESUS alone for salvation, is what saves  :) <br>  <br>  Salvation is a FREE GIFT that happens in a split second when you believe in Jesus! It is impossible to lose or "leave" salvation (John 6:39-40, 1 John 5:13). <br>  <br>  The truth about Jesus is that the only way to be saved and to get into heaven and avoid being sent to eternal hell, is by believing in faith alone that Jesus, who is God, died for our sins on the cross as FULL PAYMENT for all our sins, and then Jesus rose from the dead (1 Corinthians 15:1-4). Believe this and you will be in heaven, no matter what! <br>  <br>  Please pray now: "Jesus, please forgive me of my sins. I believe that You died on the cross for my sins and You rose from the dead. Thank You for eternal life!" You will be in heaven with Him forever when you die. :)

Learn the parable of the fig tree is what Christ said, don't let anyone deceive you. do your home work.<br>  Many things must happen first, Do you see a one world government yet? Is Lucifer back on earth in a flesh body standing on mount zion claiming to be god.<br>  God sends us signs and messages all the time through such things as current events, music,His angles, and His elect, look for them and if that does not give you enough to keep you busy in these end times, than just pray to God for your answers and He will provide them to you.<br>   Oh! and on a lighter side of scripture this web sight is a sign if you read 2nd peter chapter three, its full of scoffers walking after their own lust, ignorant of what the scriptures say.

I personally believe that due to way the world, and especially our nation here in the U.S. is going more and more corrupt, it may be within the next couple decades, but like I said, noone can know except for God. The Bible says that the anti-christ will rise shortly before His coming. But you never know, He could return tomorrow, or in many decades from now.

Familiar baiting words of Satan who tempted Christ on the mountain.  Satan has already tried to bait Him, "throw Thyself down on the rocks below, for it is written that the angels will lift Thee up lest Thou dash Thy foot against a stone."  But Jesus said, "Begone, Satan, for it is written, the Lord Thy God alone, shalt Thou adore."  <br>  <br>  People will always say "if only He would appear to ME!" then I would, etc. etc. and etc.  But this is simply avoiding God's will and preferring our own will.  You have already the same free will to GIVE the only thing you have, adoration of Christ in payment for His Sacrifice on the Cross. <br>  <br>  St. Mary Magdalen was THE whore, not just one of the whores, of Jerusalem, and she gave Christ her perfume, and giving it, she was adoring Christ, and giving her love with contrition for all her sins, Perfect Contrition, for she suddenly knew that this was the Lord of Lords, the Son of God!  She gave to Him her most valuable possession, her heart, substituted by her perfume poured on His feet, and she washed His feet with her hair!   And He gave her eternity. <br>  <br>  We don't get any better chance than that. Today's sinning apostates and atheists are no different than when Christ came to earth.  The world was in darkness, only a remnant of the House of David remained faithful to God's prescripts, and they believed the scriptures.  Who is waiting today?  Not those who say, "I tell ya, I need to see! otherwise I won't obey!"  They, too will hear familiar words, but Jesus said, "Depart from Me, for it is written, the Lord Thy God alone, shalt Thou adore."

rlgb5pRGaa	Hello!<br>  <br>  Great question. God is tough for our tiny little brains to comprehend, but here's my understanding.<br>  <br>  God is one essence in three persons. The Trinity is a beautiful picture of how relationships are supposed to be. Father, Son and Holy Spirit -- three people who live in such tight, loving community that they're truly one.<br>  <br>  More specifically, here's what the Bible says about the Holy Spirit: He (1) is God, (2) is a person, (3) gives us spiritual birth, (4) makes us holy and (5) teaches. One of my all-time favorite verses is Galatians 5:22, which lists the "fruit" the Spirit can help produce in our lives: love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, gentleness, faithfulness and self-control.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps!<br>  <br>  Mark<br>  <br>  <a href="http://getupwithgod.com" rel="nofollow">http://getupwithgod.com</a>|`|wTfY9AmPaa	3rd person. its kinda of thought of the hand of God that helps us today. its also what we recieve in Baptism.

f0JLp4hFaa	No, evolutionary theory merely describes how life evolve and how the species became more diverse.  It says nothing about god or about the creation of the Earth or of the creation of the universe or even of how the first living thing formed.<br>  <br>  But there are PLENTY of reasons to believe god doesn't exist (sorry for cut & paste):<br>  <br>   <br>  1) Supernatural explanations are ALWAYS replaced by natural explanations:<br>  All of these things were once attributed to god(s) or spirits:  floods, hurricanes, the existence and movement of the Sun, Moon and stars, the tides, earthquakes, disease and health, success or failure of crops, rain or drought, tidal waves, eclipses, why children look like their parents, the diversity of life.  ALL of them have since been explained as our understanding of the natural world has improved.<br>   <br>  Number of natural explanations replaced by supernatural explanations:  zero.<br>   <br>  2) Inconsistency of world religions:  <br>  If God is so important and ever-present in our lives, why can't anybody agree on anything about God?  If God is not important or ever-present, why does God matter?<br>   <br>  3) Arguments for God are always weak:<br>  The arguments presented by religious people fall into the same categories:  argument from authority (God exists because the Bible says so), argument from personal experience (I just KNOW God exists), and special pleading (God is above being questioned).  None of these are based on logic or evidence.<br>   <br>  4) God keeps shrinking:<br>  In the Old Testament, God parted seas and made worlds.  Now God seems to only give comfort to a few individuals, magically craft the occasional bacterial flagellum, and put his image on toast or tree bark.<br>   <br>  5) Religion comes from parents:<br>  Children may learn more about subjects than their parents, may have differing views about so many things (politics, social issues, etc.).  But religion is almost always chosen, not by the individual, but by the individual's parents. <br>   <br>  6) All components of the "soul" are affected by physical things:<br>  Consciousness, identity, personality, character, emotions - these can all be affected by drugs, brain injuries, etc.  So all appear to be based on physical mechanisms.  No supernatural component is required.  No supernatural soul means no afterlife.<br>   <br>  7) Nothing supernatural has EVER withstood testing:<br>  When someone claiming paranormal powers or a paranormal event agrees to have it tested, they ALWAYS fail and almost always claim the test was unfair.  If gods are supernatural, and if no claim of supernatural has EVER survived testing, why should I believe in gods?<br>  <a href="http://www.csicop.org/si/online.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.csicop.org/si/online.html</a><br>  <a href="http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/1m-challenge.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/1m-c...</a><br>   <br>  8) Most claims of an all-powerful god are untestable or unfalsifiable, and those that are testable fail.<br>  Reality can be tested.  A reality-based idea can be proved true or false.  But a divine being with no physical form whose actions are indistinguisable from random natural phenomena cannot be tested or falsified.  Knowledge or worship of God provides no useful predictions.  A small coastal town full of simple, religious villagers is just as likely to get wiped off the map by a tsunami as a big city full of atheists.  And if the divine being's actions are indistinguishable from random nature, why bother to worship him/her/it/them?<br>   <br>  9) Our understanding of God never improves:<br>  2000 years ago we had a bunch of different religious factions, all bickering or warring over their different interpretations of their gods.  That is exactly what we have today.  Our understanding of God never improves because there's nothing to understand.  But over the same time period, our understanding of the natural world has grown:<br>  - from huddling around a wood fire to harnessing the power of the atom;<br>  - from witch doctors to eradicating smallpox and polio;<br>  - from astrology to the Hubble Telescope;<br>  - from mud huts to skyscrapers;<br>  - from camels to Airbus;<br>  - etc...<br>   <br>  10) Complete lack of evidence<br>  If a powerful god wishes our worship, he/she/it need only part a sea, write in the sky or do SOMETHING sufficiently grand and inexplicable, and all religions would unite, all bickering would cease, and all atheists would pray.  If a giant voice boomed across the Earth and said "You must protect the planet, must never have more than 2 children, must help a person in need every day, and must stop burning coal and oil within 5 years or I will smite you all", the entire planet would unite in common purpose.<br>  <br>  So, that's why I don't believe in God, and why I think the only way to avoid destroying ourselves is to stop wasting thought and energy on the supernatural, put down our Bibles/Vedas/Korans, and learn about the REAL world.|`|4qT0TfMZaa	In none of his writings did Darwin ever suggest there is no God.

373KJjiOaa	I dislike Islam, not Muslims. The reason I dislike Islam is that it can easily be interpreted to support violence and terrorism (we have seen the results of this on 9/11 and the many terrorist attacks before and after it), it prohibits freedom of expression (we have seen the results of this in the reaction to the Danish Mohammed cartoons, the Sudan "teddy bear" incident, Muslim reaction to Salman Rushdie's The Satanic verses etc), it prohibits freedom of religion (foremost is the ruling that an apostate should be killed as we have seen in Afghanistan, but it also includes the mistreatment of religious minorities in Muslim lands), I find the Shariah law barbaric (especially the part about flogging people and cutting people's limbs off for theft), and it violates gender equality (marriage laws, divorce laws, inheritance laws, etc)|`|iJzlRCkOaa	I think that they are good, peace-loving people.<br>  <br>  I don't think this of fundamentalists, but that's for extremist followers of any religion, not just Islam.|`|yPy4gFZ9aa	i dont understand why they believe in a god, otherwise i cant say anything about "muslims" in general|`|283tO9j9aa	Depends on the individual when it comes to people I know personally.

6DmsiLGbaa	No, it wouldn't be good to "slip" at EFY, but I think swearing at all is the bigger problem.  Course language can drive away the spirit of God, and nobody wants to be without the promptings of the Holy Ghost.  Those promptings can save lives or at least prevent misery, and that's something we all desperately need.  <br>  <br>  I had a friend with your problem.  He had a bad habit of telling people to do anatomically impossible things and of using language that would have blistered a sailor's ears.  He wasn't a member, but he knew he couldn't continue that way, so he came up with a plan for stopping.  First, he made a list of all of the words he knew he shouldn't be using.  Then, he came up with stupid substitutes for each.  He'd say something ridiculous like "lollipop" instead of the F word--something he'd never want to use in public for fear of making people think he was a loon.  He started thinking before he spoke, and by doing so, he was able to eliminate the course word from his vocabulary entirely.  He'll still say an occasional "lollipop" when he's frustrated, but the course words themselves are completely gone, and his substitutes have actually become a running joke for him.  <br>  <br>  And of course he slipped up himself on occasion, especially in the beginning.  Still, he assigned a punishment for himself each time he used a course word.  He'd either put money in a jar--and I'm not talking a penny, because you'll need to use something that will cause your wallet to cry in the long run or this won't be affective--or he let his girlfriend assign some truly horrible chore each time.  After a few months of this, he'd saved enough money to buy a stereo and his girlfriend had the most cared for house on her street.  It was a win-win, really, and it's worth a try, right?<br>  <br>  Still, the most important thing of all is to rely on the Savior and God to help you.  They obviously don't want you swearing all the time, so of course they'll help you.  Pray for their guidance, and get a blessing.  Also, it wouldn't hurt to pull out your scriptures every time you notice yourself swearing.  Read until the spirit is back with you, and I think you'll find that the urge to swear at all slowly fades.  And if you're not in a place where you can read the scriptures, think of a hymn or a Primary song and run through the lyrics in your mind. It works as a quick fix for just about any problem, to be honest, and you'll only benefit from trying.|`|dc00e6f724cc094e75dc0475843d0e44aa	Work at it from two ends. Since you have identified this as a goal, work on the it from the first end by trying to reduce the number of times that you swear per day.  Do this by rewarding yourself with something you like for your progressive success. For example, you may give yourself the reward of a special snack each day after school.<br>  <br>  The second end of things would for you to come up with an apporpriate substitute word to use and replace the swear word with the replacement word each time you think you might swear.  For example, fudge, or snap, or fetch.|`|8jhACvtlaa	I've found what helps me a lot are the words of the modern prophets and apostles.<br>  <br>  What I do is I go to LDS.org and just search for the thing that I think is holding me up the most.

Unless, THEY themselves are on the front lines against all evil. <br>  <br>  to me cussing is not a sin. its a bad habit YES and it is not good communication YES and people who strive for perfection should believe in repenting of this practice. but they should be tolerant of the unsaved and not be hypocritical in judgment against them. who knows? those that are judgmental and not perfect will probably have greater sins and damnation on "their" heads before they obtain grace. while an unbeliever can repent and find grace immediately.|`|CTxGUFZOaa	How much do you love your Heavenly Father?

It is my personal belief that the "war" between these two will be the demise in Gods plan that brings on the end of the world. <br>  It started with Hagar the hand-maiden and Sara, both inpregnated by Abraham....hopefully i have the names right.<br>  <br>  *edit* I should change 'friends' to 'unite'. Of course individuals can overlook their own religious differences and become friends with one another.  It's the ideas of each group that can't merge.|`|HqG4MDxGaa	You're right, the religious wars have been raging for years and years and they will probably never be friends. Especially since Muslims don't believe in the divinity of Jesus while Christians do. Christians are descended from Abraham and modern-day Arabs are descended from Abraham's son Ishmael, whom Abraham was forced to banish, along with Ismael's Egyptian mother, Hagar. However, the part that gets confusing is that God still loved Ishmael & Hagar. So where did this "break" in religion come forth? Arabs to one side, Christians to another? I'm sure it's in the bible somewhere but I wouldn't know what passage out of Genesis would talk about that. <br>  <br>  However, BOTH Islam and Christianity believe in doomsday or rather, the End Times of God. And also in a "Messiah" who will come forth in the world *in the name of peace* and try to get the whole entire world united over one universal government: one God, one religion, one world.  Ofcourse, this person will ONLY be pretending, they are REALLY coming in the name of DESTRUCTION but only PRETENDING to come in the name of "peace" and will fool MANY......Christians believe this person to be the Anti-Christ, though Jews and Muslims will view this person as their long-awaited-for "Messiah", since both Jews and Muslims denied the divinity of Jesus or that Jesus was the Messiah. <br>  <br>  As for why Jews and Muslims fight so much, it goes way back to the Old Testament. God temporarily banished the Jewish people fro their land and allowed foreigners to settle in the land of the Jews, instead, as a way of punishing the Jews for disobeying him (God, that is). But then when the Jews repented of their sins and tried to turn back to God, and get their homeland back, things weren't so easy. The ancient Palestinians said "no, this has BECOME our land, you have already abandoned/been driven from it". To which the Jews say "no, you're wrong, this is OUR original promised land, promised by G-d" and back and forth, back and forth and they've been fighting holy wars over this land ever since.  <br>  <br>  As for why God didn't just obliterate the Muslims earlier and just let the Jews take back over the land, I think he's afraid if he does this, that the Jews will sooner or later just rebel again, like they did in ancient times. For it seems a people (of ANY kind of people, actually) can only be "good" for so long, before they start rebelling. Not to mention that Muslims are technically still a part of God's people too, since they all sprang forth from Abraham through his half-Egyptian son Ishmael. <br>  <br>  So yeah. Christianity, Judaism, Islam. All tied together through Abraham. It was all the same "faith" and "God" at one time, but then there was a "break" and they all went their seperate ways.|`|6D2jlvgkaa	Since Jesus shows and reflects the actual Divine Love of the Father God , no doubt the Christians accept Jesus to be God's Son .Bible is Infallible too. But Islam gives all explanations to prove that Jesus is not the  Son of God. "Jesus is the Son of God " is the very Foundation of the Christian Faith . But Islam tries to disprove it and thereby tries to prove that the Bible is a book of lies . The Bible ( both Old Testament as well as the New Testament teaches " Love your neighbour as yourself " ( O.T :Leviticus 19:18 , N.T : Mark 12:31 ).<br>  <br>  The Bible instructs how to treat an alien also :<br>  " When an alien lives with you in your land , do not mistreat him. The alien living with you must be treated as one of your native-born. Love him as yourself, for you were aliens in Egypt.I am the LORD your God." ( Bible : Leviticus 19:33-34 ).<br>  <br>  The Bible Instructs about Love and Equality among all human beings . Hence it is no doubt believed to be the Word of God . Since there exist  some difference of opinions there is no possibility at all for them to be  genuinely friends .<br>  <br>  Muslims don't call God as " Father " . Hence they call Jesus just as a Prophet . But Christians have been authorised by the Word od God to call God as " Father " . since the Christian believers are used to called God as Father , they are of the Culture to call Jesus ( the one who reflects God's Love ) as the Son of God . To call Jesus to be the Son of God is purely logic and scientific as far as Christians are concerned . One man's father need not be every one's father . With all reverence the Muslims call Jesus as a Prophet . With all reverence the Christians call Jesus to be the Son of God .

God has given the inhabitants of this planet so many avenues and paths towards him. So many vehicles to choose from,however, Satan the devil has blinded the minds of the unbelievers and used his power to cause enmity between all peoples in an effort to disrupt peace and harmony. That is why all people of Earth need Jesus.  For there is only one God and one Mediator who can reconcile God and humanity—the man Christ Jesus. He gave his life to purchase freedom for everyone. He personally carried our sins in his body so that we can be dead to sin and live for what is right. By his wounds you are healed.<br>  "For God loved the world so much that he gave his one and only Son, so that everyone who believes in him will not perish but have eternal life. God sent his Son into the world not to judge the world, but to save the world through him.<br>  "There is no judgment against anyone who believes in him. But anyone who does not believe in him has already been judged for not believing in God's one and only Son. And the judgment is based on this fact: God's light came into the world, but people loved the darkness more than the light, for their actions were evil. All who do evil hate the light and refuse to go near it for fear their sins will be exposed. But those who do what is right come to the light so others can see that they are doing what God wants."  The heavens are declaring the glory of God;<br>  And of the work of his hands the expanse is telling. <br>   One day after another day causes speech to bubble forth,<br>  And one night after another night shows forth knowledge. <br>  God of Abraham I shall laud you because in a fear-inspiring way I am wonderfully made.<br>  Your works are wonderful,<br>  As my soul is very well aware. <br>  For you yourself produced my kidneys;<br>  You kept me screened off in the belly of my mother<br>  My bones were not hidden from you<br>  When I was made in secret,<br>  When I was woven in the lowest parts of the earth<br>  Your eyes saw even the embryo of me,<br>  And in your book all its parts were down in writing,<br>  As regards the days when they were formed<br>  And there was not yet one among them. <br>  So, to me how precious your thoughts are!<br>  O God, how much does the grand sum of them amount to!<br>  Were I to try to count them, they are more than even the grains of sand. God of Abraham where can I go from your spirit,<br>  And where can I run away from your face? <br>   If I should ascend to heaven, there you would be;<br>  And if I should spread out my couch in Sheol,<br>   look! you would be there. <br>   Were I to take the wings of the dawn,<br>  That I might reside in the most remote sea, <br>   There, also, your own hand would lead me<br>  And your right hand would lay hold of me. <br>  How long, O Jehovah, must I cry for help, and you do not hear? How long shall I call to you for aid from violence, and you do not save?  Why is it that you make me see what is hurtful, and you keep looking upon mere trouble? And why are despoiling and violence in front of me, and why does quarreling occur, and why is strife carried? <br>   Because the wicked one is surrounding the righteous one, for that reason justice goes forth crooked.  “See, you people, among the nations, and look on, and stare in amazement at one another. Be amazed; for there is an activity that one is carrying on in your days, which you people will not believe although it is related.  For here I am raising up the Chaldeans, the nation bitter and impetuous, which is going to the wide-open places of earth in order to take possession of residences not belonging to it.

So it's hard to watch people who are very devout in their faith, whether it's muslin or jewish whatever, b/c they're very devout, probably more devout than I am, but they're drinking the wrong water, or at least missing parts of it. <br>  <br>    A lot of the world's religions are similar to Christianity, and they have the same roots. Like the muslims, a lot of their history stories are the same ones the Christians have, b/c Christians are rooted from Abraham's son Isaac, but Muslims came from Abrahan's son Ishmael. But where we differ is that the Muslims believe in Mohamed the prophet and his teachings and Christians only believe in Jesus. <br>  <br>    You said we can't know the truth until we die. I obviously don't agree with you. I believe the Bible is God's letter to humanity, showing us our roots, our sins, and His plan for redemption. And there's a lot of historical record that are not religious that back up things that happened in the bible. Plus most cultures, tribes in africa, etc, have these stories too that were passed down to hem, stories like Noah's ark. If you're interested at all in pursuing any of this, you could go to this website: www.vineyardcolumbus.org, and check out the online sermons section, find a title that interests you and listen to it. See if it sounds like truth to you or not. I don't know if you ever went to church or not, but I guarantee you it's some of the best Christian preaching available. Probably not what you would expect at all.<br>  <br>    The thing is, if atheists are right, it's not really going to hurt anybody when we die. We just die and that's it. So it doesn't matter if someone lives the party life or if someone lives selflessly. But if I'm right, if Christians are right, the atheists will be in a lot of trouble when they die. I'm not a "hellfire and brimstone" kind of person, but isn't it worth exploring for yourself, really investigating Christianity? Don't you want to be sure there's not God instead of waiting till your dead to find out, when it's too late? It it your life after all. I would hate for you (or anyone) to miss out on God b/c all they could see was the hate and violence in the world caused by religion, not caused by God. And there is a huge difference between the 2. That's why I'm worried about what other people believe.|`|d1862ba8e4c727c54e3035f0293c5a14aa	I agree with you totally. Have you ever watched 30 days where this lady who's an atheist goes to stay with this christian family for 30 days? The father was furious with her for not believing. He seriously got angry. It's weird how some people get if you don't believe. It's actually dangerous. Like it threatens them if you believe different. I think their religions also tell them they need to force others to believe like they do. It's sick that people can be so mindless as to not think for themselves? I mean why would some loving god let a child be tortured or raped if they have the control to make the world? We were made from sand? Helloooooo CRAZY.

3DjUX8etaa	Jesus was not seen as the only Messiah. Messiah in Hebrew means "the anointed one". There have been many Messiahs throughout Jewish history. Aaron, the brother of Moses, was the first. Most of the Jewish kings, priests and many of the prophets as well were anointed. Messiah does not have the idea of divinity in Judaism as it does in Christianity. But, as for all those others you mentioned, Mithras and Isis can not be Messiahs because Messiah is a Hebrew word and a Messiah is a Hebrew/Jewish concept. As for the others, it is possible.

If there is an overarching plan of God that He controls, then it should not fail or come to nothing.<br>  <br>  A second part has to do with logic theory.  It is entirely possible for two similar things to have different causes.  When others resemble Jesus in some way, it needn't imply that they were both sent by God or that neither were sent by God.<br>  <br>  I would beware more of this second issue while you are in cyberspace.

stAeoUeSaa	He is the only REAL messiah|`|NNdkhCy0aa	Messiah is a Jewish term.  There were actually two messiahs that they were waiting for as seen by two different groups.  Mainly, the Messiah they were looking for was to free them from rule of others.  However messiah really means 'anointed'.  There were, at Jesus time and at other times, others who fulfilled the role.  Messiah didn't necessarily point to someone who did miracles.  in fact the miracles that Jesus did were more signs to show that God's kingdom was within reach.  Response to the fact that God had come close and was actually interested in people was to repent, and so be accepted by God.<br>  <br>  Jesus himself never described himself as son of God.  He did call himself son of man, but that was actually simply a Jewish term, and as such all Jews saw themselves as Son(s) of God.<br>  <br>  The closest you could get to Jesus calling himself anything like a relation to a deity is in John's Gospel.  However that gospel was written 100-150 years after the death of Jesus and was actually an exposition on the theology of Jesus.  So the writer (perhaps another John, or something called pseudopigrapha which means 'writing as if you were the writer called XXXXX) 'put words in Jesus' mouth' so to speak, to make sure that people knew that Jesus was the son of God.  If you want something closer to the source read Mark and Luke.<br>  <br>  For me, experience counts.  My experience is that Jesus truly is the Messiah, and that follows a whole host of university study.|`|c05702374b5bc85f3a1502d55060a46eaa	Christians say other religions not true, Judaism say Jesus not Messiah, Messiah descendant of David, Joseph descendant of David, Jesus not son of Joseph, cannot be Messiah.|`|AA11367192	because Mary made him think he was the only Messiah since he was little, he grew up with that thought and this world has 2009 years that suffers the consequences of that thought.|`|zlQLsR89aa	Christians believe it and therre r lots of them.

I was in a head-on collision 2 days before my 21st birthday (other guy's fault), and was in the ER due to *possible head trauma*. I started panicking and going into shock and having a heart attack. The light above the examining table was getting brighter and brighter and brighter and brighter, until my soul came halfway out of my body. They were about to give up and pull the sheet over me because a nurse said "well, looks like we got to call the mother, she's not gonna be too happy about this........" when I heard a voice to the right of me say to the rest of the doctors and nurses around me: "5 minutes. Just give me 5 more minutes and lets pray to God to save the life of this little girl!" and looked up at the light as she said it. And then I prayed to God to live because this "nurse aide" that asked for the 5 minutes seemed so sad that I was "dying" and I couldn't stand to see the sadness in her eyes. So I layed back down in my body and was brought back to life. She smiled down at me and said "you're very lucky, the Lord's given you a 2nd chance today. aren't you so glad to have a 2nd chance at life?" with a special "twinkle" in her eyes as though she knew me. Later on, I tried to follow her down the hallway to thank her but she disappeared.

Please take a moment right now to read the insert on your birth control pills. Look at all the side effects, including heart disease, liver disease, deadly strokes and more. Does your husband really think it's okay for YOU to take all these risks while he assumes none of them, just so that you can avoid pregnancy?<br>  <br>  Anyway, like I said, God's system works just fine. Women can't get pregnant every day -- just when they are ovulating. And God gave each woman a set of signs of ovulation that show her when it's possible to get pregnant. Science has learned what these signs are -- it's been the subject of YEARS of research.<br>  <br>  All you need is education. Learn to read your individual signs, and then it's simply a matter of choosing when to have sex and when not to, according to whether or not you are ready to have a child. There are different methods, including the Creighton Model (which I highly recommend). Google for information on classes -- at the very least, your local Catholic Church can tell you where to take classes (you don't have to be Catholic).|`|4qT0TfMZaa	It does not matter what others think.

No deity in its right mind would want any woman to have to keep cranking out babies at her own expense. If you wish to take birth control pills because you don't want more children, that is your right. <br>  <br>  There are also many other forms of birth control if you find you don't like the pill (I can't take it because it affects me poorly), including vasectomy, IUD (with or without hormones), cervical cap, diaphram, sponge, condoms, and on and on. Your choices are practically limitless, and considerably more effective than the "natural" family planning method I see reccomended here by so many men. (hint to the guys, not all women's cycles follow a steady pattern)|`|o4zAMlCoaa	But in your case, I wouldn't say so. Preventing kids because you wouldn't be able to provide for them makes since. But if there is room in your budget, you should have kids. Birthcontrol intercepts a potential blessing from God.<br>  If birth control is really concerning you, just avoid "close time" with your husband during times you're likely to get pregnant.<br>  Good Luck!|`|ZaSiPFvtaa	It is, according to the Roman Catholic Church, and perhaps other religious organizations as well.  To give credit where credit is due, most other churches have grown up on this issue, and did so long ago.<br>  <br>  According to reasonable people who do not let religious organizations control their minds, the answer is no.  Birth control is actually a scientific breakthrough, with extremely significant and liberating results.  To those who are against abortion, consider this:  how many millions of abortions have been prevented by the use of birth control?  It's incalculable!  If he's REALLY against abortion, the Pope himself should start a free-condom-distribution plan!|`|7f19096dfc203109750db707ef0faeedaa	Of course. God requires that you pump out those babies as fast as you can; that's all women are good for. And soon the earth will be uninhabitable because of the pollution and wrecked environment, and you'll all have to die a slow, painful death so you can be with your god in heaven. And good friggin' riddance.|`|c85dfb73b5d99dcbc373b5a788901bc7aa	If I believed in "sin," I would believe that the greater sin would be for you to ignore the good judgment and intelligence that God gave you.|`|LF4vun1maa	Consider the logic of any action being considered as an "attempt to play God," for a bit.<br>  <br>  We deliberately alter the world around us every day.  We'd all be dead in short order if we didn't.  No one actually leaves their life in God's hands and abstains from any action to control it.  Afterall, you could just fall down and refuse to eat or drink, insisting God will keep you alive if it's part of God's plan.  But you don't do that because eating and drinking are very simple, familiar things for you.  "Playing God" is simply things people are unfamiliar with.<br>  <br>  All medicine used to be "Playing God" then surgery was.  Now genetic modifications are "An attempt to play God."  There's nothing in the bible where God says "The rest of biology you can have, but DNA is mine."  It's because it's new and unfamiliar and people demonize it because they're afraid of new things.<br>  <br>  And it's the same with birth control.  The Catholic church has been curiously incapable of accepting or understanding this science, as so they cling to an ancient bit Hewbrew superstition that claimed semen is a human life they label birth control as "Playing God."<br>  <br>  What I can't understand is where anyone gets the idea of a god who is so feeble that something as simple as birth control would be considered an approach to his power.|`|YXGdwwTJaa	Whoever told you that birth control was a sin?<br>  <br>  At one time it was important, as humans became farmers, that enough people were around to do the hard work  so society and its mouthpiece, religion, said that it was good to have lots of children.  Of course until recently  at least around  quarter of children died before they were five and many before they were adult. so women needed to have lots of children to replace those who  died.  <br>  <br>  Now that more children grow up and the world population is too big, then birth control is a necessity and not using it could be considered a sin against people, the rest of the world and whatever deity you worship. <br>  <br>  Of course, if you believe that chemical or any other form of birth control is a sin then it would only be logical to refuse and other modern invention such as vaccinations, antibiotics, medication generally and operations, none of which are natural.|`|08ae3d05d7e2c113fc49e08dbdcfa338aa	It is not a sin to use contraception<br>  <br>  <br>  To the person above me re: children in Africa and AIDS. <br>  Dillicious cubed<br>  <br>  1 out of every 5 children dies in Africa because of all sorts of preventable things.|`|8IHfytEvaa	Birth control pills and other methods which prevent conception are fine.<br>  <br>  The IUD allows conception but then won't allow the new baby to implant, so with the IUD, you'll probably conceive each month.<br>  <br>  In other words the IUD causes an abortion each month.<br>  <br>  I think what you are doing is fine.|`|AA11952133	Be fruitful and become many was a command given only when the earth needed to be populated, first with Adam and Eve, then after the flood.<br>  <br>  There are no commands in the Christian Greek Scriptures that say this is still a command.<br>  <br>  However, there is something against judging our brother (and sisters) and their choices.

I do not see this as a sin to the eyes of God (Glory to his name).<br>  <br>  God blessed us with free will and we are using it. After all would it be better to have more children that would add stress and maybe deteriorate a marriage and a family? Of course not.<br>  <br>  Loving your children and husband is all you should do. Don't worry about anything else. If you are happy, God is happy. If you are sad God is sad. He put us here to enjoy life and love and do good.<br>  <br>  How about sponsoring children in third world countries? This does not cost a lot and this way you can also have spiritual children that you help. Also why not become a Godmother? It is such a blessing! You can also volunteer to work with children at your local orphanage.<br>  <br>  No matter what you do, God loves you. You are His child afterall. What parent does not want children to be happy eh?<br>  <br>  I hope this helps. Blessings to your lovely family sister.

To me, it means to be Jesus 'hands and feet' like He told us to do in the Bible.  It means going out and getting my hands dirty by actually helping people.  Going to the retirement homes and the prisons to visit people, feeding the hungry, organizing and having garage sales so that people can stay in their homes, trying to help people kick drugs.  That's what witnessing for Jesus means to me.  So, if you mean do I go door to door or go out in the street and tell people they're going to hell, no, I don't.  If you mean do I go and help the helpless and SHOW them Jesus by being 'all things to all people' as the Bible teaches, then that's a BIG YES, my friend.

If she does not ask you directly, don't volunteer any information. It is not for you to inform her why she was excluded if this discussion will make you uncomfortable. And make no mistake - her purpose in talking about it is very likely to make you feel guilty enough to include her in future plans. Manipulative behaviors such as this make most people uncomfortable. If she asks you directly, you can put the question back on her, "Why do you think you were not included?". The party is over.  If you can't fix that, compaining to you about it constitutes whining on her part.

VRsu7c3Paa	Hmm...I try my hardest to "pass" and usually fail at doing so. It is frustrating, but I understand the other person's perspective. There might be that hint of femininity that they pick up on and think "well if this person is a woman I don't want to offend them and say he." Being androgynous/masculine and female at the same time promotes a lot of questions. The majority of it comes with the other person thinking "I don't want to mess it up." Just hang in there until you can get hormones.<br>  <br>  For myself I think I pass around .01% of the time. Probably less. I've been cursed with a pear shaped frame which makes it impossible to get clothes that fit right.

CTM29j3Aaa	I guess because Christ is the most well-known religious figure, more people have heard of him having said this rule. Also, if you hadn't noticed, Christianity had a habit of taking bits and pieces from other religions and claiming it as their own (a lot of the Pagan practices for example). <br>  <br>  Yes... it was mentioned in other religions or by other people before Christ.<br>  <br>  For example, the story of the Jew Rabbi Hillel... when ordered by a Roman to explain the essense of Judaism while standing on one foot, Rabbi Hillel said (while hopping) "Do not do unto others that which is hateful to yourself".<br>  <br>  Hinduism mentions it also: "One should never do that to another which one regards as injurious to one’s own self".|`|f3nwI8ytaa	He's credited with it because He said it.  There are similar rules from other sources, but they are not exactly the same.  Jesus did not invent the golden rule.  He gave it expression.  I'm trying to figure out why this bothers you.  Jesus also said a bunch of other things: love your enemies, turn the other cheek, forgive those who sin against you, etc.  His moral stature did not come from this single saying.  Jesus was not a one hit wonder.  He was the real deal.  Even his staunchest enemies admitted that his moral teaching was profound.<br>  <br>  peace|`|ni6SCUm9aa	Practically every religion (Buddhism, for example, which was invented 500 years before Jesus came along) has that rule.|`|49c07573b2ef8b7f4c512a10de7d7febaa	I have no idea; certainly it pre-dates Jesus by at least a hundred years or so.  Hillel the Elder said, "That which is hateful to you, do not to others."  And he lived MANY years before Jesus (around 110 BCE) - and was probably where Jesus got it to begin with.|`|3GAiVmEAaa	I don't know, I never thought he had been. In one of my last years going to my Unitarian Universalist church when I was taking RE, I was given a list of different religions versions of it. It was a long list, just about every religion has some version of it.|`|j0oU4V3baa	it's a lie, obviously.|`|fM7yNf8oaa	It's just the nature of Christians. They attribute everything good to their god, and everything bad to humanity, sin, and satan.|`|26414b2f3237391dde0fd3b0221fcffcaa	Some people are just closed off and ignorant about history. It's not exclusive for Christians, but I doubt that being a religious fanatic helps.|`|rIvp1BToaa	I have  heard of the golden rule  but not that it came  from Jesus.|`|AA10945101	He did say something quite similar (e.g., Matthew 7:12 "Therefore all things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them...").  I'd also point out that he gave credit for the statement above to "the law and the prophets"...to me that suggests his statement reflected a long history of any number of versions of the golden rule influencing human behavior and ethics.<br>  <br>  Given the number of people that have read the bible today and given a long history of people for whom the bible represented the bulk of their reading material, I wouldn't be surprised to discover that a large number of people, starting back with those that heard Jesus say what he said and continuing through modern times credit Jesus with "the Golden Rule".  <br>  <br>  I wonder, if you didn't have access to the Internet, would you believe Jesus was the author of the Golden Rule?  You and I know that Jesus wasn't the first to suggest the "ethic of reciprocity" because we were exposed to that possibility through education and because we were interested enough (for different reasons) to do more research to discover the truth.  <br>  <br>  However, I can tell you that any number of teachers told me that Jesus was the author of the Golden Rule...so did my parents, my grandparents, and any number of other people...and every one of them was basing that belief on a combination of having read what Jesus said AND being taught by their own teachers, parents, and others that Jesus "created the Golden Rule".  <br>  <br>  If you think about it, easy, widespread access to the information required to even question whether or not Jesus was the first to suggest the golden rule has only been available for the last 15 years (since the development of the World Wide Web).  Before that, a person would have needed to devote hours and hours of time to library research the origins of the golden rule.  Furthermore, it wouldn't even occur to most Christians to wonder whether or not Jesus was the originator of the golden rule.  After all, whether he was the first to present the idea or not, he did present it to his followers and commanded them to follow it.<br>  <br>  At worst, Christians who say, "Jesus gave us the golden rule" are revealing their "lack of knowledge" (aka, ignorance) about the origins of the golden rule, surely not a major issue.  Especially if you consider that if Jesus hadn't said what he said, it is quite possible that "the Golden Rule" (as we know it) wouldn't have become such a basic rule of ethics today.  Yes, many others said something quite similar to the golden rule before Jesus said it...but human beings haven't been listening to and/or reading their words by the millions for the past 2,000 years.  As such, it isn't necessarily inaccurate to say Jesus "gave us" the golden rule...they aren't saying he created it, just that he "gave it" to his followers as a commandment and they've been sharing it with others around the globe for a long, long time!

Nice to see you're back! :) <br>  <br>  There's many, many, MANY different interpretations of who the harlot is in the book of Revelation, just as there are many interpretations of who or what "Babylon" is in Revelation.<br>  <br>  But I'll give some possible theories of my own interpretations:<br>  1. Literal symbolism mixed in with Metaphorical symbolism. I think most of it is literal, yet alot of it is metaphorical. So it's hard to tell which is which.<br>  2. I believe the harlot is metaphorical. The harlot could be Rome or the Roman Catholic church (it's very, very corrupt these days), it could be the USA (as we're one of the most glutton-filled, pornography-producing, mid-driff baring, etc) nation on Earth, it could mean the False Prophet (as the harlot "rides on the beast" as the False Prophet would "ride" on the words of Anti-Christ), it could just signify Sin itself or the apostasy in the church, it could mean alot of things.<br>  <br>  As for my thoughts on rather or not she (whatever she or IT is) exists, my personal belief is YES. But the more I think about Revelation, the more confused I get as it also REPEATS alot of symbolism in it. 11 of this and then later on, 11 of that. Or what have ya. <br>  <br>  But yeah: if anyone can tell me their personal interpretation of the whole entire book of Revelation, kudos to them! :) lol|`|abKiChJAaa	Revelations is a book of end-time prophesies which refer to the times preceding and following the return of Christ a.k.a. the Rapture. When addessing this question you must realize that harlot is a metaphor for a country that is "prostituting" itself to other nations and allowing itself to be defiled. In Revelations, the geat harlot refers to the ancient Babylon of the Old Testament. Ancient Babylon was the epitome of materialistrc and immoral nations. It was the most wealthy nation of the ancient world and full of glamour yet, it was also sexually immoral, hedonistic, rampant with paganism, and every evil you can think of. Revelations 14:8 says, <br>  "Fallen, fallen is Babylon the great city! She made all the nations drink of the wine of her immoral passion."<br>  This precedes what is further described in Revelations 18:2-5,<br>  " 'Fallen, fallen, is Babylon the great! She has become a lair for demons, a haunt for every unclean spirit, a haunt for every unclean bird, a haunt for every unclean and detested beast.  For all the nations have fallen from the wine of her immoral passion, and the kings of the earth have committed sexual immorality with her, and the merchants of the earth have gotten rich from the power of her sensual behavior.' Then I heard another voice from heaven saying, 'Come out of her, my people, so you will not take part in her sins and so you will not receive her plagues, because her sins have piled up all the way to heaven and God has remembered her crimes.' "<br>  As you can see, this is also a prophesy of the future because there will be a nation (very possibly America) that will be the modern Babylon and will draw the rest of the world down the path of hedonism and other evils. If you read the rest of Revelations 18 (an NET or NIV Bible would be best for your comprehension) you will get a clear insight into what the future holds. But to sum it all up and answer your question, the "Great Harlot" is Babylon and yes, she is here today.|`|26414b2f3237391dde0fd3b0221fcffcaa	Paris Hilton? <br>  <br>  Oh, you mean Lilith?

5c9011543d498dda04d1562813072559aa	The Book of Revelation can be confusing to the modern reader because much of it was written using a symbolic style of language that is not used today. Sincere Bible scholars, in fact, disagree about the meaning of some of the symbolic passages. But that should not keep us from reading it and understanding its main message.<br>  <br>  The key for the reader is to try to see beyond the details to the main themes, which are tremendous truths. For example, the book of Revelation underlines the fact that this world is doomed, and our hope must never be in this world or its political systems and philosophies. It also points us to the great truth that some day God through Christ will triumph over death and evil, and Satan will be utterly defeated.<br>  <br>  The Book of Revelation emphasizes that Christ will come again some day in great glory to establish His Kingdom of perfect justice and righteousness, "and he will reign for ever and ever" (Revelation 11:15). Some day those who know Christ will be secure forever in Heaven, and "there will be no more death or mourning or crying or pain, for the old order of things has passed away" (Revelation 21:4).<br>  <br>  Most of all, the Book of Revelation (like all of the Bible) points us to Christ. He is the Savior and Lord of all who trust in Him, and some day we will see Him face to face. Are you ready for that day? You can be, by repenting of your sin and giving your life by faith to Christ today.|`|825953318303d03d2a0b5c5c512b8f40aa	I can't say I understand the whole book, but think I understand some of the major things in it.  Revelation opens with the Lord addressing the seven churches, of which he calls Pergamos the throne of Satan.  This is not widely known, but in true history, these churches collapsed after the open letter was read to the seven congregations.  It was predicted they would rise again.  The Lamb begins to open the seals.  First horseman rides conquering, and to conquer.  He rides out of the old testament into the new, and on into the future.  The earth has a history of war, the abomination of desolation.  First horseman, Law, Government, Democracy.  Second horseman, Catholic church.  Third horseman, Protestant church.  Fourth horsemen.  The two witnesses, the kingdom proclaimed.  Chapter 12.  Here we see a firery red dragon having seven heads.  He stands in front of the woman, ready to attack.  Here we see the seven churches on the rise again, but here they are organized in a military type mannor, ready to attack the saints, whenever they should appear.  Here the devil disgorges a river of water at the women to destroy her.  Religion has always been the mans realm.  You can read the river of lies told about the woman in the old testament, which kept women abject slaves and in bondage until this modern century in developed countries.  Chapter 13.  Here the seven headed beast is rising again, only it is a christian nation.  It comes out of the sea, meaning it comes out of the sea of people.  This describes the system of voting, where someone is elected out of the general population to lead the country.  He is hand in hand with the religious beast from the earth.  Euphrates dried up.  When prophecy is lived out, the prophetic water is dried up, this will precipitate Babylons fall.  The first horseman parallels the beast from the sea.  The second horseman parallels the beast from the earth.|`|QVKWVValaa	I can. I understand it is fictitious. All of it is make-believe.

Many have thought that it refers to a devastating nuclear war in our time. Actually, Armageddon is something quite different. According to the Bible, it will mean major changes for the better, resulting in a world of lasting peace.” Read Revelation 16:16 or Psalm 37:10,?11 <br>  <br>  Here is an excerpt from the book REVELATION...IT'S GRAND CLIMAX AT HAND. Awesome book and takes you step by step through the visions that John say and explains how they apply to us. I can send one to you...you'll love it! spreadingoodnews@yahoo.com<br>  <br>  Chapter?39<br>  The Warrior-King Triumphs at Armageddon<br>  Vision 13—Revelation 19:11-21<br>  Subject: Jesus leads the armies of heaven to destroy Satan’s system of things<br>  Time of fulfillment: After the destruction of Babylon the Great<br>  ARMAGEDDON—a fearsome word to many! But to lovers of righteousness, it betokens the long-awaited day when Jehovah will execute final judgment on the nations. It is not man’s war but “the war of the great day of God the Almighty”—his day of vengeance against earth’s rulers. (Revelation 16:14, 16; Ezekiel 25:17) With the desolating of Babylon the Great, the great tribulation will already have started. Then, urged on by Satan, the scarlet-colored wild beast and its ten horns will concentrate their attack on Jehovah’s people. The Devil, more wrathful than ever at God’s womanlike organization, is determined to use his dupes in waging war to a finish with the remaining ones of her seed. (Revelation 12:17) This is Satan’s last opportunity!<br>  2 The Devil’s vicious assault is vividly described in Ezekiel chapter?38. There, the debased Satan is called “Gog of the land of Magog.” Jehovah puts figurative hooks in Gog’s jaws, drawing him and his numerous military force to the attack. How does he do this? By causing Gog to see His Witnesses as a defenseless people “gathered together out of the nations, one that is accumulating wealth and property, those who are dwelling in the center of the earth.” These hold the center stage on earth as the one people to have refused to worship the wild beast and its image. Their spiritual strength and prosperity enrage Gog. So Gog and his numerous military force, including the wild beast out of the sea with its ten horns, swarm in for the kill. Unlike Babylon the Great, however, God’s clean people enjoy divine protection!—Ezekiel 38:1, 4, 11, 12, 15; Revelation 13:1.<br>  3 How does Jehovah dispose of Gog and all his crowd? Listen! “‘I will call forth against him throughout all my mountainous region a sword,’ is the utterance of the Sovereign Lord Jehovah. ‘Against his own brother the sword of each one will come to be.’” But neither nuclear nor conventional arms will avail in that strife, for Jehovah declares: “I will bring myself into judgment with him, with pestilence and with blood; and a flooding downpour and hailstones, fire and sulphur I shall rain down upon him and upon his bands and upon the many peoples that will be with him. And I shall certainly magnify myself and sanctify myself and make myself known before the eyes of many nations; and they will have to know that I am Jehovah.”—Ezekiel 38:21-23; 39:11; compare Joshua 10:8-14; Judges 7:19-22; 2?Chronicles 20:15, 22-24; Job 38:22,?23.|`|oxdBlbezaa	sir Issac Newton.   temple at the center of time by David flynn.|`|AA11008046	I have a fairly good concept of that teaching.

Contrived compassion, where you'd like to feel love for all beings but it just ain't happening and true compassion where you can fell great compassion and love for every single being without exception.<br>  We begin our metta (loving kindness) practice by practicing first with those people whom we feel closest.  then, later when our practice has matured, we extend that loving kindness to all beings.  Slowly but surely, experiencing that loving kindess we feel for those who are close to us, we truly experience loving kindess to those whom we don't know.<br>  The danger in this practice, as you have brilliantly pointed out, is that we can get stuck with just practicing for those whom we are closest and never quite reach the state of true compassion for all beings.  We should share all our merits with all beings without exception.  Otherwise it won't work.<br>  om mani padme hum
fQGv81kHaa	I have been reading some of the verses Mohammad had recited into his quran & it never ceases to amaze me @ the lengths he went to to try to recall the O. T. & N. T. Scriptures/verses! I mean, really, his short, undetailed, & totally twisted way of reciting them makes me laugh & sometimes roll my eyes because he simply expected people would never have known that he got his "revelations" from anywhere else. He believed his followers were as ignorant as he was.<br>  <br>  quran surah 17:104   And we said to the Children of Israel afterwards, "Go live into this land. When the final prophecy comes to pass, we will summon you all in one group."<br>  <br>  In this sura, Mo is sort of summarizing/paraphrasing what Moses wrote in the O. T. what Pharaoh said to him & Aaron: ("Go live into this land.").   "This land" is referring to Israel, the Promised Land that God promised Abraham!  My goodness, in the next sentence, Mo is reciting from 1000s of years later about what he could remember of what the prophet Isaiah said: ("When the final prophecy comes to pass, we will summon you all in one group".)<br>  <br>  A good site that describes the FINAL PROMISE AND DELIVERANCE comes from Isaiah chapters 60-66. I strongly suggest that Isa. 60:12 be given special attention to! One must remember God's Holy Spirit inspired Isaiah to write in ch. 66 that it isn't only the Jews which BTW will only be a remnant who will be gathered unto Israel; but also people from all nations (Gentiles) & this ch. is referring to the Messianic kingdom, each verse, especially v. 18, v. 22, 23, & 24. Mo could have been thinking about what the Holy Spirit told John to write also which is basically the same as He inspired Isaiah to write.<br>  Who knows, Mo got so much of the O. T. & N. T. Scriptures mixed up as he was reciting into the quran & deliberately twisted & distorted Them & btw, when he wasn't trying to remember Them, his demonic self recited (the traditional war chs. for example & much more). I sure am thankful that God led the men who followed Mo to write about him & the acts he committed into what is called their hadiths. 'By his deeds, he is known.'<br>  <br>  So here's my answer: God's Word tells us everyone's name which isn't written in the Lamb's Book of Life will be cast into eternal Hell. So if any Muslim or any other person who did not come put their trust & faith in God's only Son, Jesus Christ, (God Incarnate) while living on this earth in their physical bodies before physical death will be spending eternity in Hell. The answer for this is in the Holy Bible for honest seekers who desire to know why God will send nonbelievers to Hell.<br>  <br>  Tom, I also ask the same question to ---she said--- that you did & I agree that the version she quoted is whitewashed/misleading.<br>  <br>  Blessing to you, K|`|AA11922696	tsk tsk tsk, Pinocchio, you are losing it.<br>  <br>  didn't you ask this Q. before and I told you that the translation of the verse is wrong??<br>  <br>  didn't you read my answer or you still living in the denial state???<br>  <br>  it is not good to lie to prove your point, since you keep accusing Muslims of lying.<br>  <br>  you are not giving us a good example to follow, yes???<br>  <br>  read and remember(you should see a doctor by the way, or are you getting old??)<br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AhND3hS00R5FquLdtM09EKbty6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090215060427AAsKzPL&show=7#profile-info-d1i3ac5baa">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a><br>  <br>  the verse is like that:<br>  <br>  (104.

Destroy every idol or statue, and level down every raised grave.”<br>  (Sahih Muslim)<br>  <br>  May Allaah protect our beloved brothers and sisters in Islam from the deviation of the Shee'ah.<br>  ---<br>  The reason why the Shi'a are not accepted nor reconciled with is because they have introduced beliefs and practices into Islam that were never taught by the Prophet, peace be upon him, never taught by his family, or his companions. Rather they have changed Islam from it's original perfected form and thusly, innovated a way of life that leads to Hellfire. This is not a dispute between a trivial "this" and "that", it is a serious issue dealing with the difference between the Straight Path to Paradise and the crooked paths that lead to punishment in this life and the next. May Allaah rectify our condition and affairs.<br>  <br>  With regards to Shee'ism, then it is not the Islam that was taught by Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him. Rather, they are a group that have exaggerated the status of the noble family of the Prophet, peace be upon him, to the extent that they build shrines devoted to their worship along with Allaah. This is shirk, polytheism, the greatest crime a human being can commit in the sight of Allaah.<br>  <br>  The proper way to practice Islam is to follow the understanding of the Qur'aan and the Prophetic life example that was actually taught by Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him, and actually lived by the Prophet, peace be upon him, his family, and his companions.<br>  <br>  All beliefs and acts of worship that oppose this way are affairs that lead away from Paradise and lead towards Hellfire.<br>  <br>  It is not permissible to worship Allaah with acts of worship that did not exist in the time of the Prophet, peace be upon him (such as pilgrimage to Karbala, calling upon 'Ali or other human beings for help who are dead or absent, building shrines dedicated to saints, etc...) And it is not permissible to interpret the Qur'aan with meanings that oppose what the Prophet, peace be upon him, actually taught.<br>  <br>  Remember, the main goal of every Muslim is to enter Paradise and to avoid torment in the Hellfire. The main goal is not unity in this life for the sake of "unity". If the Shee'ah have chosen for themselves a path to destruction, then it is not in any Muslim's interest to "unite" with them. Rather the sincere Muslim should advise them to return to the right guidance that Allaah created us and them for, and if they refuse, then other Muslims should be warned against falling into their severe errors. By this way, with Allaah's permission, we preserve the correct practice of Islam for ourselves and for future generations who seek to worship Allaah correctly.<br>  <br>  Whether the Shia' as a whole will repent and return to the Straight Path...? Allaah knows best. This splitting amongst the Muslims is a test from Allaah to see who will sincerely and correctly follow His religion. He guides whom He wills and He leaves to stray whom He wills and Allaah is All-Knowing, All-Wise.<br>  <br>  ADDITIONAL NOTE: "Fitnah" Makers?<br>  <br>  It is oppression to call a Muslim who clarifies the difference between true Islam and deviant ideologies a "fitnah" maker. The people responsible for making "fitnah" are those who alter the pure religion of Allaah and turn it to something that leads our brothers and sisters to Hell.<br>  <br>  If I knew someone who was in danger of being murdered, would I be considered a "fitnah" maker if I were to alert that person to danger? No. I would not be considered a fitnah maker, even if the murderer was a Muslim.<br>  <br>  And innovation in religion and the threat of Hellfire is more serious a danger to a person than murder and thusly a Muslim has more right to be warned against it in the clearest terms possible.|`|423b37222c9aecc6d4e09218cb231a06aa	No ! Visiting graves is not worshipping graves.<br>  <br>  ----- ----- ---- ----- ----- ----- ----- ----- ---- ----- ----- ----- ----- ----- ---- ----- ----- ----- ----- ----- ----<br>  <br>  Sulaiman: You people venerate the graves of Ahle Bayt (a.s.) and yearn to visit them (ziarat). Isn’t it haraam?<br>  <br>  Ja’far: We believe that the traditions used by those who prohibit the ziarat of graves are incorrect. Or they have not understood the context of the traditions. And it has been the practice of the Messenger of Allah (s.a.w.s.) to visit graves. He visited the grave of his dear mother and wept upon it. His companions joined him in the lamentation. (Sahih Muslim 2:671). In the same way Fatemah Zahra (s.a.) visited the tomb of her father. Muslims throughout the ages have visited the tomb of the Messenger of Allah (s.a.w.s.) and the graves of the Imams of Ahle Bayt (a.s.) that are situated in the Baqi cemetery of Madinah.<br>  <br>  Therefore if you prohibit the visitation to graves it will go against some authentic traditions, like,<br>  <br>  "Verily, I had restrained you from visiting the graves. Now, visit them. Certainly, it reminds one of the Hereafter."<br>  <br>  (Sunan Tirmidhi, Vol.3, Pg. 370)<br>  <br>  Since the earliest times it had been custom of people (Muslims) to visit graves.<br>  <br>  ----- ----- ---- ----- ----- ----- ----- ----- ---- ----- ----- ----- ----- ----- ---- ----- ----- ----- ----- ----- ---- <br>  <br>  Sulaiman: However, you people bestow on them the position of divinity and respect them greatly. You also build upon them places of worship?<br>  <br>  Ja’far: Certainly, the Almighty Allah has ordered us to consider the place where Ibrahim (a.s.) stood, as a place of worship.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  The Holy Quran says,<br>  <br>  "Appoint for yourselves a place of prayer on the standing-place of Ibrahim."<br>  <br>  (Surah Baqarah 2:25)<br>  <br>  Similarly, the cave where the ‘People of the Cave’ took shelter was also made into a place of worship. As mentioned in the following ayat,<br>  <br>  "When they disputed among themselves about their affair and said: Erect an edifice over them — their Lord best knows them. Those who prevailed in their affair said: We will certainly raise a masjid over them."<br>  <br>  (Surah Kahf 18.21)<br>  <br>  Moreover, the Messenger of Allah (s.a.w.s), the Ahle Bayt (a.s.) and the Muslim leaders have till this day circumambulated around Hijr-e-Ismail (when they go Hajj or Umrah). It is actually the grave of Hazrat Ismail (a.s.), his mother Hajra (s.a.), his daughters, and some other Prophets (a.s.).<br>  <br>  Now, if it is haraam to visit, or to convert into places of worship, the graves of prophets and messengers and the righteous servants of Allah, why do we find the Holy Prophet (s.a.w.s.) following such a practice? And if it is the practice of the Messenger of Allah (s.a.w.s), then what restrains us from following this practice (Sunnat)?<br>  <br>  ----- ----- ---- ----- ----- ----- ----- ----- ---- ----- ----- ----- ----- ----- ---- ----- ----- ----- ----- ----- ----<br>  <br>  Sulaiman: But this is ‘shirk’ (Polytheism- associating someone or something with Allah)!<br>  <br>  Ja’far: I said, ‘for the servants of Allah’, then how can it be shirk when the Messenger of Allah (s.a.w.s) has followed this practice? Also, have you ever seen any Muslim praying towards a grave while considering it as a Qibla (direction faced during prayers)? Whenever you see people praying at the tombs, know that they are engrossed in the worship of Allah. They have not changed their deity. They worship Allah at this place because it is a blessed and purified place. The place is associated with one of the beloved ones of Allah. It is a sign that reminds us of this great personality who is the dweller of this place.<br>  <br>  It is haraam according to shariat to worship anyone other than Allah at the grave. Such a thing is not found in the Islamic world. The doubters and those who misinterpret have such wrong notions, which are of no value.|`|073ad2ba60d8cf71ef3514ad2f5a92eaaa	Ofcourse not but we consider the grave of the holy people holy.

cOcoJI4vaa	There's not a major difference between dancing styles in the South and West of Africa. They're pretty much similar, even some of the songs, just in a different language. I think of the West African countries, Nigeria and Ghana have similar styles of song to South Africa, but that's only my view. But dancing is still pretty much the same. If you wanted to do something about clothing as well, they have a variation across Africa, so you might want to research about that as well.<br>  <br>  Hope I was of any help. =]
5OucqEzFaa	Without knowing what your brother-in-law's recent decision was that so disgusted his family, we're in no position to comment.<br>  <br>  However, as a former Jehovah's Witness I can tell you that they see no need to save up money or invest in pension schemes or even get a good education to get a good job with career prospects. That's because they still believe Armageddon is right round the next corner (give or take a few decades) and "this wicked system of things" will soon be destroyed. You won't need money after Armageddon.<br>  <br>  But, and this is a b-i-g but, they want their members to spend as much money as possible with them - buying literature, contributing to the society funds, leaving your estate to them in your will. They are not like the churches of Christendom who ask you to give one-tenth of your income. Oh, no! They want voluntary contributions only - which will hopefully exceed a mere tenth of your annual disposable income.<br>  <br>  I don't go along with their beliefs, but if you think you've only got a few years left before Armageddon turns up, you might as well blow it.<br>  <br>  Check out the answer above and these quotations from the March 'Awake!' magazine: Quoting Acts 20:35 where Jesus says there is more happiness in giving than there is in receiving, the article goes on to say "Such happiness results when we cheerfully use our finances to help the needy, especially fellow Christians." Now check out the profit and loss account of the Watchtower Society to see how much money they have contributed to the needy. The only charity they support it themselves. That's the bit that says "especially fellow Christians." They mean themselves because they would have you believe they are the ONLY true Christians and every other Christian denomination is part of false religion.<br>  <br>  Luke 6:38 is used as a biblical basis for contributing financially to advancing "the interests of God's Kingdom." Guess who is the only organisation on the face of this planet who is 'advancing the interests of God's Kingdom'? Latter Day Saints? Seventh Day Adventists?<br>  <br>  Check out the audited financial returns of this organisation which is recorded, for tax purposes, as a publishing corporation.|`|UR4mWefGaa	I know JW's do not believe in christmas.

JW's were running up their credit cards, and such because they believed they would not have to pay back the evil banks. What a Hoot! The Kingdom Hall my family attended actually had a countdown calendar for October 1, 1975. When the day came, and went, nothing happened.

They believe in Armageddon and that the financial system will not survive, that "They will fling their silver into the streets and their gold will become an abhorrent thing; their silver and their gold will not be able to deliver them in the day of the wrath of the LORD." (Ezekiel 7:19) So - and this is a rather stupid extrapolation of that belief - you might as well spend your money now, since Armageddon is coming Real Soon Now (tm).  <br>  <br>  I used to be a JW, so I heard this all the time.|`|pGNnnUD7aa	You can't take it with you; why not spend it?<br>  <br>  Plus, it'll help stimulate the economy.

I am not sure who told you that about Witnesses teaching not to save money. The latest Awake magazine (Mar issue) is AWESOME about how to be reasonable about money and also says that we NEED to save money and be balanced about spending. My husband and I are total ding bats when it comes to money so this helped us alot! Ask him for the magazine....I'll bet he's give you one ;-)<br>  <br>  PLEASE read this with your bible.....that is what our beliefs are based on completely!<br>  The Bible’s Viewpoint<br>  What Is the Wise View of Money?<br>  “MONEY is for a protection,” says the Bible. (Ecclesiastes 7:12) Because it pays for food, clothing, and shelter, money serves as a protection against the hardships associated with poverty. Indeed, in a material way, money can buy practically anything. It “meets a response in all things,” says Ecclesiastes 10:19.<br>  God’s Word encourages us to work hard so that we have the means to provide for ourselves and our families. (1?Timothy 5:8) Honest, hard work rightly engenders feelings of satisfaction, dignity, and security.—Ecclesiastes 3:12,?13.<br>  Additionally, our hard work enables us to be generous in a financial way. “There is more happiness in giving than there is in receiving,” said Jesus. (Acts 20:35) Such happiness results when we cheerfully use our finances to help the needy, especially fellow Christians, or to purchase a gift for someone we love.—2?Corinthians 9:7; 1?Timothy 6:17-19.<br>  Jesus encouraged his followers to be generous, not merely on rare occasions but as a habit, as a way of life. “Practice giving,” he said. (Luke 6:38) The same principle applies to giving in order to advance the interests of God’s Kingdom. (Proverbs 3:9) Indeed, our generosity in this way helps us to “make friends” of Jehovah and his Son.—Luke 16:9.<br>  Beware of “the Love of Money”<br>  Selfish people rarely give, and when they do, it may be with an ulterior motive. Their problem often is the love of money, which, contrary to their expectations, usually brings unhappiness. “The love of money is a root of all sorts of injurious things, and by reaching out for this love some have been led astray from the faith and have stabbed themselves all over with many pains,” says 1?Timothy 6:10. Why is the love of money so unsatisfying and even hurtful?<br>  For one thing, a greedy person’s appetite for wealth is insatiable. “A mere lover of silver will not be satisfied with silver,” says Ecclesiastes 5:10. Hence, money lovers ‘stab themselves’ with endless frustration. Moreover, their greed contributes to poor relationships, unhappy family life, and even lack of proper rest. “Sweet is the sleep of the one serving, regardless of whether it is little or much that he eats; but the plenty belonging to the rich one is not permitting him to sleep.” (Ecclesiastes 5:12) Above all, the love of money earns God’s disfavor.—Job 31:24,?28.<br>  Biblical and secular history contain many examples of people who stole, perverted justice, prostituted themselves, committed murder, betrayed others, and lied—all for money. (Joshua 7:1, 20-26; Micah 3:11; Mark 14:10, 11; John 12:6) During his earthly ministry, Jesus invited a “very rich” young ruler to follow him. Sadly, the man declined this wonderful invitation because it would hurt him financially. In response, Jesus exclaimed: “How difficult a thing it will be for those having money to make their way into the kingdom of God!”—Luke 18:23,?24.<br>  During the present “last days,” Christians must especially be on guard because people in general are, as foretold, “lovers of money.” (2?Timothy 3:1,?2) True Christians who remain conscious of their spiritual need are not swept along with this wave of greed, for they possess something far superior to money.<br>  Something Better Than Money<br>  While stating that money serves as a protection, King Solomon added that “wisdom is for a protection” because it “preserves alive its owners.” (Ecclesiastes 7:12) What did he mean? Solomon was here pointing to the wisdom that is based on an accurate knowledge of the Scriptures and on a wholesome fear of God. Superior to money, such godly wisdom can save a person from countless pitfalls in life and even from a premature death. Also, like a crown, true wisdom exalts those possessing it and wins them respect. (Proverbs 2:10-22; 4:5-9) And because it contributes to the gaining of God’s favor, it has been called “a tree of life.”—Proverbs 3:18.<br>  Those who sincerely want such wisdom, and who are willing to search for it, find that it is readily available. “My son, if you .?.?. call out for understanding itself and you give forth your voice for discernment itself, if you keep seeking for it as for silver, and as for hid treasures you keep searching for it, in that case you will understand the fear of Jehovah, and you will find the very knowledge of God. For Jehovah himself gives wisdom; out of his mouth there are knowledge and discernm|`|tx4bRDrXaa	You need to be more specific but maybe you can't disclose family matters. The Bible says that (Ecclesiastes 7:12) For wisdom is for a protection [the same as] money is for a protection; but the advantage of knowledge is that wisdom itself preserves alive its owners.(Proverbs 22:7) The rich is the one that rules over those of little means, and the borrower is servant to the man doing the lending.it also tells us the love of money is the root of all evil. Not money the love of money.The Bible helps us to live balanced and practical lives where money is concerned.<br>  I am a Wittness and while there are some Wittnesses that are very rich,most have to be frugal to live and many are middle class.Was his disicion to move to another place or to further the work ?Is his entire family wittnesses ? I do know that these are the principles we live by,not to put money first or quarrel and fight over it .Jesus promised us that he would take care of us and that is a garauntee.We take care of ones who don't have the things they need also.(Matthew 6:33) “Keep on, then, seeking first the kingdom and his righteousness, and all these [other] things will be added to YOU.

And it's an instant in which God is posing a question, and that question is basically, 'Do you want to be one with eternity? Do you want to be in heaven?' And we're all saying, 'No thank you. Not just yet.' And so time is actually just this constant saying 'No' to God's invitation. I mean that's what time is. There's just this one instant, and that's what we're always in.<br>  Actually this is the narrative of everyone's life. That, you know, behind the phenomenal difference, there is but one story, and that's the story of moving from the "no" to the "yes." All of life is like, "No thank you. No thank you. No thank you." then ultimately it's, "Yes, I give in. Yes, I accept. Yes, I embrace." I mean, that's the journey.

" at this address,<br>  <br>  <a href="http://catherinephilosophie.wordpress.com" rel="nofollow">http://catherinephilosophie.wordpress.co...</a><br>  <br>  Because it is exactly about this.<br>  <br>  Thank you for your Question.<br>  <br>  Take care.|`|0e3fc5be5d3c0d40f8667b63fe95585caa	Much study is weariness of the flesh, but, yes, only the all-one has free will.  The all-one in bodies (us) is caused as well as causer.  The world is where the all-one 'comes' to get booted around (for that is fun too).  Any part of the world gets booted around by all the rest of the world - and boots the rest of the world around too.<br>  <br>  The idea that part of the all-one exists is a mental artifact, created by limited wits, perception, memory, imagination, consciousness.  Limited wits see part of the all-one, and take it for reality.  Only those who see the big picture are awake, are in reality, are realised.  A jigsaw puzzle piece, or several pieces, or billions of pieces, is not the completed picture, the reality.<br>  <br>  But the all-one needs to have experience of part as well as whole, of unreality as well as reality.  Because everything is recognised through its opposite.  So oneness is known only thru manyness, wholeness is known (experienced) only thru partness.  And recognition is consciousness, and consciousness is life.  Life depends on the play between whole and parts, reality and seeming reality.  <br>  <br>  Thus the whole whole-and-parts (heaven-and-world, spirit-matter, energy-matter, knowledge-ignorance, unity-duality) is life.<br>  <br>  Hence the scripture  I was a hidden treasure and i wanted to be known so i created the world.  This is humanity's will (god's will).<br>  <br>  Much religion is aligned with going from earth to heaven, from physical reality to the ideal.  But this is part of error.  The truth is that all is good, both heaven and world are parts of the whole.  The true aim of religion is realisation of the perfection of heaven-and-world, of perfection-and-imperfection.  The joy of this is that we are not on an endless treadmill to ideal heaven, but we are in the right place now.  And always.  Both error and truth are part of the game of life.  And necessary and good parts.<br>  <br>  We oscillate eternally and daily between error and truth, and this oscillation is our home, is what we as all-one have chosen and we like.  Oscillation is wave is energy is consciousness is life.  Heaven without earth would be contrastless and therefore inexperiencable.<br>  <br>  Moreover, heaven doesn't have (can't have) colour, movement, shapes, time, space, progress, challenge, learning, questing, growing, suspense, excitement, for all these things require partness and manyness.  We have chosen to live in the world.  We can choose to move freely between the two worlds, and this is the life maximum.<br>  <br>  When people are in the world, they sometimes want to get to heaven.  When people get to heaven, they want to get to heaven-and-earth, the best of both worlds, mortality-immortality, knowledge-ignorance, safety-excitement.    Heaven is the perfect hospital but you wouldnt want to live there - just be able to go there at will at need.  Get heaven and all else (world) will be added.  Heaven (the heaven of heaven and earth)  is at hand (is here now and always).<br>  <br>  Greed is trying to get the infinite out of the finite.|`|XqASiNieaa	Unfortunately, all that has been said about god, everything...even the Bible, has been written by mankind. We don't know anything. The only thing we know, for sure, is that we are here, breathing entities, alive...moving about. It is all a mystery.<br>  <br>  Question about *why* will continue until we are extinct (or whatever). The mind's endless quest to know who/what am I? Why am I? On and on...<br>  <br>  To break up the angst around 'all this' (and there is angst)... is to rest in just who you are...exactly who you are. To interrupt the mind's repeating karmic pattern, endlessly disgruntled with 'what is' right now, is to end suffering. To bring awareness to ones life, too look dualism...right/wrong, this vs. that, in the face... is to notice it. When it is noticed, it is neutralized. Dualism needs a 'third force', awareness, to neutralize its sting. When one sleepily moves though ones life, karmic patterns repeat.<br>  <br>  So awareness is who you are. Someone recently said "I am, what is". How true that statement is. When we realize that all that is manifest 'appears' from that great unknown...movements of energy set in motion...you, exactly as you are (!)...for our entertainment!<br>  <br>  In our own way, we recreate/copy life drama...good vs evil, in our movies. Is the movie, once it is produced,the director of its destiny? It is produced for our entertainment. If we step away from this scenario we can see amazing similarities to our own creation.<br>  <br>  To know the original source of life and all of its handiwork is pure folly.I don't think we have choices...maybe one and that is...to watch. :)<br>  <br>  Thanks for your question!|`|ghMJyzsOaa	Oneness, is a single stream of fully connected consciousness, from which where we all share in a myriad, diverse, dimensional, matrix of thinking.  Categorically a resounding "Yes." We have absolute volition to exercise choice over an unlimited continuum of generated thoughts, relational to the potential of our design, and we can either harness and utilise our free-will to control what we intentionally choose to create, or we can randomly mole ourselves through life, hoping entirely on chance to attract the right external conditions that match our internal dreams and aspirations.<br>  <br>  Choice, control or freewill - these words just symbolise the free flowing power that we all possess for the purpose of directing and channelling energy into being for the experience of feeling fulfilment, and setting the course for attracting an even greater energy of fulfilment, which we call joy happiness and love. There are only two paths. One leads to frustration anger and many other negative qualities, which equals unfulfilment, and which translates to us as resisting the natural flowing order of our emotional and thinking evolution, which is always aspiring to flow in unity with the source of who we really know ourselves to be. Thoughts that make us feel bad or unfulfilled creates resistance, preventing us from reaching the fulfilment of our innermost desires.      <br>  <br>  I may have wandered off course a little, but I chose to loose my control and direct my free will to express my unbridled thoughts. Bless You!|`|hwRZ7DY7aa	I don't believe that Oneness exists somewhere outside of us.<br>  What I'm about to say doesn't derive from any religion or philosophy it is only a personal experience I had through meditation and the best way to describe it is by using a metaphor. <br>  <br>  So, I had this feeling, image, thought I don't know the correct word for it that if Oneness was once like a big single piece of glass, somehow it broke and scattered in billions of smaller pieces. <br>  The pieces forgot that they used to be one, got lonely, got scared thought that the other broken pieces were something different than themselves and that caused the glass to break to even smaller pieces. <br>  I feel that the more we hurt ourselves and others the more we break the glass to smaller pieces and the more difficult it will be for us to restore it. I feel that the little glass pieces who finally realize their true nature get reunited and hope/prey for the others to realize it too and join them.<br>  <br>  So yes I believe there is choice. I also believe some people are born with a "spiritual advantage" that helps them identify and make the right choices when it comes to reuniting with the One.|`|6dL7UGvfaa	Oneness has no choice or becoming, growing and reaching. It is all in one without need for any! It just Is. However, we have separated from that Oneness which is a futile exercises  as everything is in One and there is nowhere else to 'go 'after 'separation'. Yet we think we are separate as we think we have no identity of our own in Oneness which is again unnecessary and that is part of our malady. Now, the choice/freedom is only to 'rejoin' to the hugely bigger Choice we were ushered in the day we came on this earth: Realize the Source Consciously and Be It! Of course we are already in it, it does not wait for our choice. Yet, since we have only words to express here, it is a sort of manner of saying! In other words, we have to cast off the mind myth and behaving with that myth that we are not in One!|`|F5v5Qme0aa	The illusion is that we are separete from the God force.

Our free will does not mean we may do as we please, but what God pleases.  As we are part of God, in reality our will is His Will, there is no separation.  When free will is not in accord with God's Will, it is the will of the ego.   God is not in charge of ego.  In fact God does not recognize ego.  God's Will is perfect, and as Holy Spirits made in God's likeness, we can only do our will that is also God's Will.  It is the same, for we are perfect creations of God.  When our will matches God's Will, this is true free will.  It is in the remembrance of this that we willingly do God's Will.  Discipline is not the answer without willingness out of our Love for God.|`|A01w1dHqaa	Freedom means to be free from fear. The loving choice is God's choice and we are Sons of His.

So we must have the experience before we understand the words. So instead of just talking with words we will add ritual. And what ritual fully expresses the joy of the fullness of being, to join pure consciousness with its expression in the physical world? And so we enter the ritual of Tantra, Red Tantra or Maithuna as it is sometimes called, this "making love" is the experience we all have each moment and so we weave reality back together, we make love when we walk on the grass with our bare feet, see with our eyes a beautiful flower or hear a bird song. Making love is just another way to say "making sense", all our senses are making love with all the sense objects, reality consists of constant intercourse between the senses and sense objects. This is the true marriage, the sacred union, this is completeness of being. The universe is a sex machine, is sex. But having listened to unworthy teachers that have polluted our minds with concepts we have forgotten the experience of completeness, of life itself and so need to practice ritual to begin to burn away those dead concepts. Sexual energy, being the very energy of creation is powerful and pure enough to burn away the veils that separate us from our own beautiful fullness of being, to be in joy of "all that is" this, our every day experience is enlightenment. By allowing ourselves to show up, to experience enlightenment or not can be considered the use of free will.|`|fmHyfVmVaa	Dear Sister, what many call "free will" simply is that we can chose when to begin.  What difference of choice is there in the illusion of many. We are free to not acknowledge or "believe" in any Truth we wish, but it has no effect on the reality of that Truth. It is also quite possible to be mistaken in what we think we want! We already are all we seek, the journey home will bring you back to yourself. We don't need to chose what is real, only come to remembrance by discovering that which is not. In the end we find that it was our will all along. As you stated, nothing else can possibly be, there fore if we really never left our Source, the two wills are really just one.|`|f10424ac1ac7b1791b4f665094823d61aa	I believe that, as it's creators, we do have volition within the illusion.<br>  <br>  I would think there must be some degree of choice, control or free will within Oneness, or the separation would not have taken place..<br>  <br>  As a small part of God that choose to experience separation in this form, we can perhaps assume that the "rules" of Oneness do not exist within the illusion. They were left at the boundary fence.  Perhaps because the illusion would not be complete or experienced to the full if Oneness had entered our dream with us.<br>  <br>  We have forgotten who we are and we need to wake up. <br>  <br>  But ALL "individual parts" of the illusion need to awaken from the dream and therein lies the conundrum.   Can we truly become enlightened enough to recognise all these separated parts as ourselves?|`|AA12391873	In oneness, who's choice, control and free will are you talking about? <br>  ...perhaps the One?<br>  <br>  Choice, control and free will are just concepts of the human mind which is fearful because it thinks it is separate and competing for resources.|`|4dgrwFU4aa	You create a variant of something that exists already.

You see, you are thinking that God should only be able to think, say or do things one at a time.  But God is all places "at once."  And this means, that we are at all places "at once."  And, God can and does diversify because this is the only way that God can know Self.  The eternal question, "Who Am I?" is still being asked of God-Self - I am saying that God is asking God-Self eternally this one question.  God knows that "I AM" is what God is Being in the overall, general context of the statement.  God knows that God is Being Who God IS.   <br>  <br>  Nevertheless, you see, KNOWING does not complete BEING.  Just knowing something doesn't mean you have any experience with it.  And lacking experience, we cannot KNOW our BEING - not fully, not completely.  The only way for God to know SELF and BE that SELF, is to experience it.  When knowing AND experiencing happens, then BEING demonstrates itself.  So, in a manner of speaking, WE are the expression of God experiencing so that God (and us, by the way) can bring about BEING.  <br>  <br>  You are assuming that Oneness erases individuality and that individual consciousness is destroyed once we regain full awareness of ourselves really being God.  Yet, you already know that God is Many Beings in One.  The "Many" is all of US and much more.  You see, God is like a symbiosis, much as you would imagine a jellyfish in the ocean, consisting of countless independent organisms who live and work together to form the appearance of One Jellyfish.  And that is exactly what God Is - a huge body of living beings, with countless members - I mean, literally, COUNTLESS...I think the only person who knows is Ultimate Reality God, aware of each and every "cell" of the symbiosis.  We are, in effect, God's BODY.  And so this is where the writers of the Bible GOT IT WRONG!  They got to this conclusion a long time ago theologically, and "described" all of US as the BODY.  They made a mistake though in terms of using this term to describe the COMMUNITY of BEINGS.  They made a terribly mistaken leap to the next illogical assumption, that because we are the BODY of God, the suddenly we are made in the "image and likeness of God."  And then, the very next conclusion is - God must LOOK and BE like us - like a human body.  And so humans have gone off the deep end, thinking God only looks like a human being.  Do you see the terrible mistake that has been made theologically here?  Yes, of course, God can look like a human being WHEN GOD WANTS TO. When God decides to look like a human, God can look like a human.  But God can choose, elect and decide to look like anything ELSE too!  And that is exactly the point.  The closest truth about it is, is that we are SPIRITUALLY created From God's Self, and that we are, in fact, a Spiritual Being - and we too, can decide, to be something ELSE, for it is true - that God gave all of the Beings of the "BODY" the ability to inherit every trait, characteristic and ability of the totality.<br>  <br>  When we return BACK to the full awareness, the totality of awareness that We are but One being, we return back to the awareness of the totality of all the BEINGS that we are as One.  Nothing in God is ever lost.  no memory, no state of existence, no remembrance of individualism, and NO LOSS OF INDIVIDUAL BEING.  We are exactly like that jelly fish - God is the SUM and TOTAL of All the BEINGS that God IS Being.  I do not believe it is God's intent, desire or wish for any of us to loose individuality UNLESS we choose to dissolve our individuality.  Yes, there are souls who have decided to do that, but it was their choice, their desire and their wish to dissolve individuality - and because God loves each individual beyond all measure, their wish was granted and is granted when that decision is made - but not instantly!  Only when that soul has reached a point beyond ANY shadow of a doubt exists.  I would call the next stage, the undifferentiated mass of BEING that is Absolute God - this is the closest I can describe this. But this is not your ultimate "fate" if you choose not to become part of the undifferentiated mass of Absolute God.  There is no requirement, no one is forced!  God honors your desire to remain an individual, even in total Oneness, you remain an individual, but you then, are totally aware of ALL the other Beings as well that is also YOU.  You need never fear that you will loose individuality by attaining total God Consciousness State.<br>  <br>  Just take comfort in knowing, God is Many in One and that Many is Countless.

Your mind should be on safety and building some skill, not taking the wrong exit. Taking a wrong exit might be a mistake but making a new driver nervous or upset is much worse.|`|H5nBLB9Zaa	maybe make a point to say before you get in the car with her, say loud enough for her to hear, that you do not want to drive with her, the back-seat driver. You are learning and you don't need rude people yelling at you and talking to you as if you are some kind of idiot<br>  tell her you'd prefer not to drive with her|`|mQZDizMVaa	It's very dangerous when/if someone argues with you while driving-especially since you're learning. You can lose your focus, composure, become distracted and cause an accident. Your aunt is lucky you're giving her a lift, but she doesn't appreciate it. Anyone can make a mistake.<br>  <br>  Two options-<br>  <br>  1 - Tell her BEFORE you get into the car she's NOT to argue with you while driving and if/when you miss an exit; if she still argues, get off at the nearest exit and take her right back home. It's your car and your rules. Not your car? It's your calm demeanor on the road that determines whether or not you'll get to your destination safely and if you're being yelled at-you'll probably become nervous and not attentive to what's going on while driving.<br>  <br>  2 - Don't take her anywhere and tell her why-she's argumentive while driving with you and that doing so could cause an accident.<br>  <br>  Don't let her make you feel as though you're incompetent. If she thinks she could drive without missing her exit, she should get her own license.<br>  <br>  Once when my mother started arguing with me because of an issue, I pulled over and told her: "Please don't argue with me while driving-it's distracting and dangerous. I need to focus so we can get to our destination safely." She never argued with me again while driving.<br>  <br>  Good luck.

But He does care what happens to us! He doesn't want us to drift through life without any meaning or purpose, nor does He want us to throw our lives away or destroy them. He loves us, and He knows all about us; Jesus said, "Even the very hairs of your head are all numbered" by God (Matthew 10:30).<br>  <br>  Never forget: God is far greater than we are. No, we can't imagine trying to keep track of every person on earth—but God can do it because He is greater than we are. The Bible says, "As the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts than your thoughts" (Isaiah 55:9).<br>  <br>  How do I know God loves us and cares about us? I know it because He sent His only Son into the world to save us and bring us back to Himself. Sin has separated us from God—but on the cross all our sins were placed on Christ, and He took the penalty we deserve. Yes, God loves us—and He loves you.

wwzej6rvaa	"K?nnen" is a modal verb which usually is not used in perfect. Your sentence could be "Du konntest schwimmen". But every modal verb in the German language is followed by an infinitive on the end of each sentence!<br>  <br>  Your other examples are grammatically correct as follows:<br>  <br>  Ich konnte schwimmen.<br>  Du konntest singen. <br>  <br>  :-) Hope that this will help you!|`|74n26OdMaa	I don't really understand your question about how to structure a sentence, but the last two sentences (Ich habe schwimmen gekonnt.  Du hast singen gekonnt.) are correct.  They translate as "I have been able to swim" and "You have been able to sing."|`|zEoRcL91aa	Czesc!<br>  Katrine said it well  - k?nnen is the best in your example.<br>  For writing, use Pr?teritum, when speaking - Perfekt.|`|95230f8eac1d3ff49eaca5df1c14e7faaa	Actually...these sentences are grammatically correct, but that's already it. There is no way you use "Du hast gekonnt". Maybe "Du konntest". But k?nnen usually isn't used in Perfekt. It just doesn't sound well.<br>  And, to answer your question. You could e.g. say "Ich konnte noch nicht laufen" or so. "I wasn't able to walk yet". That way it might make some sense to you ;) And that way it's even used in Germany.<br>  But don't use it with Perfekt...Thanks :D|`|z25aqkDjaa	both your examples are correct.german is indeed very difficult.for one rule there are 4 exceptions.more or less..........good luck
BwJOeHDEaa	im glad that someone said it..<br>  i am not racist, i came form a very ethnically diverse city,a dn was lower income, white people are the most discriminated against when it comes to jobs, benefits, etc... in my opinion, we are having to yeild to other races because if we dont we are called racist, discriminatory, lawsuits are filed, jese jackson comes out of the woodwork, and all hell breaks loose..<br>  ad what you said about living in thhe ghetto and getting the hell out of there..goo dfor you!! it completely pisses me off that people say that its not equal and theyre stuck there and things like that..EVERY SINGLE CHILD IN THE US HAS THE EXACT SAME CHANCE TO GRADUATE HIGH SCHOOL!! then, its up to them..if they decide to go to school thats good, if they dont, then stop ******* complaing that your stuck int he ghetto and cant get a good job..go join the military or something..getting paid, discounted things, and your doing a good thing and might get decent job offers when you get out too<br>  thank you saying that|`|cPQ7TBcuaa	Eh, it's just an excuse for them say that they have it so terrible. But not all minorities say this...but the ones that do, do it for self-pity.|`|r1BycC7Xaa	I don't think all white people have it well. Just straight, Christian, rich, able bodied, white men.|`|LfIw9R0iaa	You know what they say, the grass is always greener......|`|eIQ5T2amaa	White people don't have it made. We used to, but not anymore. Now we're the ones that are discriminated against, because everyone is so worried about offending another race. The American government is trying to make people equal, but are people really equally when they are being forced to be equal. Equality is a mindset. It is a philosophy that people are no better and no worse than other people.|`|16JTMgKpaa	Yes, i agree with you...not all whites have it made in the shade- I have seen some poor whites. I have also seen some whites who get profiled by the police because of their cars. And you know what? they feel the same way other people feel. they call cops 'pigs' or 'the man' and they can relate. You know why? because until you experience being discrminited against you then feel a unity with others who know what it is all about- and have known it for years. I had a friend once, (huge white guy) but we were buddies at work, and he would always talk about the cops. it ws funny as hell.<br>  <br>  sidebar: lol. notice how some of these responses can only 'attack' blacks or other minorites, when that was not the point of the damn question...grow up you hateful racists.|`|FME726Eaaa	I agree.And I'm not saying this from a little blonde-haired rich girl standpoint, either. I'm actually of Jewish decent, but I look like my mom, so I look like I'm a little white girl, straight up. People are always saying racist stuff at me because I'm white. Plus, I can't walk down the f-ing street without some black guy or mexican thinking I'm a racist. I'm not. It pisses me off that people think white people are the only racists out there.|`|tbdPLC1Aaa	Opinions are like butt holes; everybody has one....but its their opinion; what do you think is important. <br>     I am black and sad to say looking at history, from slavery to riots, majority verses minority, KKK etc; our past has been very racist and sadly history use to repeat itself.  But we can not change our past, but we can change our future.  <br>     Don't allow other peoples opinions to rent space in your mind.  Do your best and be the best that you can be.  Love those that hate you, Bless those who curse you, and pray for those that despite fully use you.   In other words trust God and yourself.  You'll never please everybody and you are the only one who can please you.  You are in charge of your destiny<br>     Never look back, keep looking forward and strive to achieve your dreams.  NEVER let people tell you who or what you are!! Be You and be the Best You!<br>    God's blessings and good luck!!!!|`|pfke6Jieaa	i think its only the few ignorant people who say that. whenever someone does something wrong i never give them the excuse that white people are at fault. most minorities already know that trust me. but there are still close minded ones who like to blame everything on the "white man" just because they are too depressed in their lives and want to blame someone else for their trouble. they deffinitely do not represent all minority people at all.|`|xbGgF6dLaa	as time goes by, other races are taught that because that is how it was before. They don't understand that time has moved on and they use the bad treatment from years before or treatment from some people now and believe that they are treated this way because they have less, not really knowing whether they do or not.|`|u3fJ2cMWaa	It is an excuse for their own personal failures.  It is easier to use whitey as a scapegoat for their failures, insecurities and ignorance than to accept responsibility.  They need to grow up and accept the screwed up their own lives instead of blaming me for it.|`|5HPkIxZHaa	i assume that because they've been in the usa for a while now. for generations. my parents are immigrants and didnt get an education here. it takes a couple of generation for people to start making money. white people have been here. they owned houses, and inheritied houses. =|`|mI7abIT8aa	Well i'm black i can't speak for everybody and i don't agree with this, but i think a lot of black people grow up poor and bitter and just give up or just don't try hard enough and instead of saying they gave up they want to blame their failures on someone else.|`|LhCGU3F1aa	Whats your point? You think you have it bad? That's why some Middle Eastern or South Indian can't go down the street, without at least one white person thinking of them as a terrorist. That's why some black person cant walk down the street, without a white person thinking of them as a drug dealer or thug? Don't say im making these assumptions up, cause i know those old white ladies are crazy.<br>  edit: thumbs me down haha EVERYONE THUMBS ME DOWN!|`|yjctHwzAaa	you are so right.
eIQ5T2amaa	This is not equality. The "equal opportunity" laws should be called "equal opportunity for everyone who isn't white" laws. They simply aren't fair, and they lead to stupid things like what happened with your brother-in-law.|`|VhBW7AjAaa	They hired people to go find the man? What? Sorry, but I find that hard to believe. This sounds like a loaded question. If you're living in America, then you should know how the system works by now.<br>  <br>  It's not fair that less qualified people get hired sometimes, but it's also unfair that applications (from qualified people) get thrown in the trash based on the fact that their names sound "too black", or because they selected "Female" as their gender. <br>  <br>  People can't really win either way. Sometimes the system works, but a lot of the time it will backfire, which makes it tough to give a definitive answer to this question.|`|3DoCbvnAaa	You are that F*king racist idiot from last time!<br>  <br>  Hurry up and leave America Cracker, we don't want u here!  <br>  <br>  Ps_ Come up with a better story!|`|pfke6Jieaa	i believe there is still racial preferences even today when applying to jobs. i know its ridiculous but it still happens. i applied once to a restaurant and it came down to me and a white girl. i had more references and i knew a manager of the same franchise store from another city and i attached his card on my application. while that girl was 16 and she had no job experience and she got the job.<br>  <br>  i felt kinda bad because i couldnt even believe it, but of course i wasnt surprised since most of the workers there are white and hispanic. people will always prefer their own race because they feel like they need to stick together somehow. this is never gonna end i guarantee you that.<br>  <br>  and as you can see instead of backing up whats right and fair they back up whats black. i have nothing against blacks but i think its not fair that they get also better chances just because of white guilt. people need to wake up and start to overlook race and really look at the individual because we are all capable of doing a job if we put an effort into it.<br>  <br>  same in YA, people will answer ur question based on ur avatar. check out the ones with the asian avatars they usually get the most answers no matter how stupid the question is. i dont have anything against asians it just seems people have favortism. and whenever i expose the truth about people here they get mad and say im whining or jealous. that is their only self defense mechanism.|`|KM2EPk2saa	Well this might not be the best solution. However, white people have discriminated historically and this is what the government came up with to obtain parity.  There are many qualified black people out there as well.<br>  <br>  THese laws are meant to protect them from people like you.|`|4Vmlf902aa	I learned about this in school. I think it's because of quotas or whatever they call them. If a business  doesn't have a certain # of people who are say black, hispanic, women,etc. they get fined. They don't work though, and just tell your bil to go find another job. There's nothing he or you can do to change what happened. Besides it isn't like that's the only job available today. Tell your b.i.l. to suck it up, and go find himself a damn job.|`|CEChcfKwaa	This story does not ring true. In this economy, are you telling us that only 1 black and 1 white man applied for a state job? There would have been many black as well as hispanic, white and asian applicants and there are plenty of black men with CDLs. Don't tell me you haven't noticed all the black truck drivers on the roads.
16JTMgKpaa	Indians tend to have more curl to the texture of their hair, Pakistanis is usuallly a bone strait. Indians don't have such big bones on the bridge of the nose as Pakistanis- Indians have a more range in complexions. You can just tell the difference.|`|T1beLIQqaa	No difference.They are basically the same as Pakistan was a part of British India during the British Raj from 1858 to 1947, when the Pakistan Movement for a state for Muslims, led by Muhammad Ali Jinnah and the Muslim League resulted in the independence and creation of the state of Pakistan, that comprised the provinces of Sindh, North-West Frontier Province, West Punjab, Balochistan and East Bengal. With the adoption of its constitution in 1956, Pakistan became an Islamic republic. In 1971, a civil war in East Pakistan resulted in the independence of Bangladesh.India and Pakistan has a very diverse mixed population consisting of ALL shades of Indian peoples.Their caste systems tend to favor lighter over darker skin.Being very mixed, you would have to compare heritages if you want to form such a biased opinion since they were all India at one time-exactly like the US during the Civil War-North and South. <br>  <br>  Your question would be like asking how the girls in the US during the Civil War, from the North look different from the girls in the South?|`|vtafeEIJaa	no difference......|`|ZbpaRKkUaa	Pakistanis all have beards. At least the males do.|`|LhCGU3F1aa	Well, no one can typically look like an Indian or Pakistani. They all come in different colours.

I'm pro-choice because it's my body, and I should have a say in whatever goes on with it. Other women should have that right too, and if they don't want to be pregnant that that's their own personal decision. I don't completely approve of abortion being used as birth control, but then again, it's not my choice.|`|cf5961a316debfb7203fffd630bd740caa	i'm pro-choice because 1)consent to sex is not consent to motherhood and 2) nothing and no one has the right to use another's body without their consent or against their will. that includes a fetus.|`|DIqqgNaVaa	im pro choice and christian but abortion should be used as a last resort for things such as failed birth control and rape|`|eC5QIpnbaa	I'm Pro-the-baby-gets-a-choice.|`|364f2af929520dfb5f9cb218e970ddaeaa	I'm sorry but im not "for" abortion.... not because of religion or anything.... i just don't like the method they use... how they tear the baby apart.... But if it HAS to be done ....it has to be done....|`|FLAtdWrmaa	Yes, although I wouldn't actually have an abortion.  But if NOT having an abortion is a religious choice, then HAVING one is equally a religious choice. And the US Constitution guarantees freedom of religion.  Freedom of religion is not absolute (no state allows someone to marry simultaneous multiple spouses, for example;  no one is allowed to kill their spouse even if their religion says it's OK, for another):  this is why abortion as an issue has made it into the political sphere.<br>  <br>  To explain my position: many Christians have specific beliefs about exactly when the fertilized human egg becomes a human being -- namely, that "human-being-ness" begins at conception, and that deliberately ending the life of even the most amorphous "human being" is murder.  They cannot prove this, there is no way -- but they believe it, and since nearly all other forms of killing are (legally) murder, and are wrong and illegal, abortion should not be allowed, either.  They say.<br>  <br>  But other people of other religions (and no religion, who are also protected by the Constitution) believe that while technical life begins at conception or at implantation (of the fertilized egg in the uterine wall), *that* life doesn't gain "human-ness" until some later time -- such as at birth, when the biological bit of life starts functioning on its own, independent of any other life form (its mother).  These people should have the right to conduct their pregnancies according to the dictates of their own religion, not the Christian religion.<br>  <br>  I don't believe that blastoplasts and zygotes are human yet.  So deliberately ending a pregnancy is not murder.  Under the Constitution, I have the right to think so and say so.  I should have the legal right to behave so, as well, if I wish.|`|NmQCYizTaa	I am, because I can't judge someone in that situation. I'm not qualified to, as I have never been pregnant. Therefore I think it's wrong to say that THEY cannot be allowed an abortion, just because of some view YOU have.|`|j27SONW9aa	Im pro choice too....Im for it as long as people dont use it as a form of Birth Control|`|DUnUPiNeaa	I am because I believe its your body and you have the right to treat it however you want.|`|QZvvHp3iaa	I am, I believe a woman has the right to do with her body as she sees fit.

Gender, race, orientation, and what have you shouldn't matter. If you love someone, it's your business, and no one has the right to tell you that you can't be with that person for the rest of your life, simply because you deviate from the majority. I also happen to think gay guys are awesome. Anyway, it shouldn't be illegal to marry the person you love because of the way you were born.|`|q9k2zEAUaa	I'M NOT TOO, AND I ALSO BELIEVE LOVE IS LOVE NO MATTER WHAT AGE OR SEX ITS A FEELING AND ATTRACTION YOU CANT CONTROL!<br>  wait. i don't.<br>  no, i do.<br>  wait, AAAH!<br>  I DON'T KNOW!|`|psUL6906aa	Obviously, just like every other sympathetic human being on this planet|`|rh5vbol9aa	Its none of my business.

There is absolutely no reason they can't have decent manners and at least close their mouth while chewing. It's repulsive, and makes me lose my appetite! <br>  I knew a girl who apparently did not possess the ability to eat quietly. Down to slurping her tea, not one thing that went into her mouth went there quietly! It was so frustratingly obnoxious, I refuse to be around her while she eats.|`|gDEFlWnOaa	I do find it annoying when people chew loudly and/or with their mouths open.

bRLCxmP6aa	It depends on the culture - in some cultures, it is considered aggressive or rude to look a person in the eye. In other cultures, it is considered a sign that you are not being honest. In many cultures, it's a sign that you're not paying attention or you don't value the person with whom you are speaking.<br>  I had trouble with shyness when I was younger, and I know that it is difficult, but you should keep trying, even though it is uncomfortable for you. You don't have to lock eyes with the person...just try to make eye contact a few times as you speak, rather than one sustained look.|`|5FVyVS9vaa	It is very rude. You can look at another persons eyes without really looking at them.|`|qeOlkRM0aa	It would depend on the circumstances. Most people who would deal with or talk to you would recognize that you are shy, and accept it, or at least not be insulted.

But if you're in America, it bothers a lot of people.|`|OAaiT1zWaa	It depends on the cloture. In China is is an insult to look someone in the eye. I think that in your case you should look at them but you don't have to look directly into their eyes|`|XzLUA7ataa	Eye contact depends upon your culture.  In some parts of the world it is frowned upon and in other places it is considered rude to look away.|`|FYPl8CYjaa	omg, that's the same with me, when i speak to someone i cant make eye contact and if i do i get this funny feeling i sort of feel embarrassed even with my best friend.  I had parents evening last week and i was speaking to my teachers i just couldn't make eye contact and some of them looked a bit annoyed and awkward, its sort of hard cos you have to look down, i haven't been bothered about it recently and try not to think about it it sort of Works with me, its not too rude it just makes you come of as if your not listening sometimes.|`|776143369bb290accd3ea9aa251e66c9aa	A lot of people assume you're not listening if you're not looking at them when they're speaking to you.  I was also very shy growing up (I did eventually outgrow it in my mid 20's) and had a hard time with eye contact.  I found it was easier just to look at people's faces without focusing on a specific feature.  Just pretend you're looking at something very interesting that's right behind the person's head.  You still appear to be making eye contact, but it is less uncomfortable.|`|MCczXQW3aa	it is rude because if you are staring off into outerspace itlooks like you could care less about the person/conversation. but if your shy u should tell ppl that are close to you so they know u arent trying to be rude.|`|VqcNXuC2aa	It depends on the situation. Like with your teacher cuz it would look like you're not listening and as aswell with your friend. Sometimes its also good to not look into the eye but not always|`|2Ety14sLaa	In our culture it is rude to not make eye contact. Try looking into only one eye. It is easier and gives you less of that weird optical illusion.|`|YSuc7L8taa	It is a sign of weakness.|`|8WPpcjhCaa	haha wow I'm the total opposite of you. I HAVE to look at people in the eye, otherwise I feel so uncomfortable and I feel like they're not paying attention to me.  But, everyone is different.  You are shy and that's okay, but you have to let people know that, so they don't have the wrong impression of you.  Like when your teacher said to look at him, I'm sure you don't give off the 'i dont care vibe', people are usually good at spotting people that are shy, compared to people that don't want to pay attention.<br>  <br>  But that's something you should work on a little day by day because it could hurt you in the future.  For example, when you go out for a job interview, when you go apply for college, whenever you have interactions with people, this will hold you back unless you improve it.  In order to have a good career and move on, you have to get over your fear slowly and maybe read some books, or search it up online on how to become more social.  I'm sure you're a wonderful person, you just have to realize that people in this world are more concerned about themselves that others (as sad as it sounds) and that you don't have to worry about what other people will think of you.  <br>  <br>  One more example...when I went with my friend to a job interview, she is like the smartest girl I have met, and she has all the necessary tools and information about the job she was going after.  She was competing against this one guy who's like half of what she is, we have known him before and we couldn't believe that he was even trying to apply for the same job.  My friend is shy and doesn't really like talking much, and he just talked and talked and just said a lot of Bs, and ended up getting the job because they liked his personality and knew that he would bring more customers in, and he wouldnt be afraid to interact with random people that might approach him.<br>  <br>  So yeah, I  mean it's something that can be improved over time, i just don't want it to affect your life.  Some people would consider it really rude and disrespectful, others will understand...but in the end you have to do what's right for you and how it will help you in the future with school, friends etc.<br>  <br>  Hope that helped! =]|`|oZqoxgc7aa	I can't stand to talk to people who don't make Eye contact with me. As noted in other comments I read the Asian thing is true, it's a little more complicated than that though, Many cultures make it gender specific as to wether it is considered rude.<br>  European cultures as well as North American cultures Consider Eye contact to be very telling of your personality. Don't allow your shyness to come across as timidity, ths could get you into trouble. Also you'll find yourself passed over for promotions and career opportunities if you don't make the effort to look people in the eye.<br>  Meekness is a dead artform, be assertive and confident. Only avoid eye contact if you feel it's in the best political  interest of someone else, e.g. someone who may be sensitive about a glass eye or a really bad unibrow. Try to make eye contact but there's a fine line between showing confidence and staring.|`|EcCG3VXyaa	The question has been answered by others but I have a suggestion:<br>  As with anything else, this will get easier with practice. Try looking someone you trust in the eye as you speak to them. You can even ask them beforehand to help you with this. <br>  Keep practicing. The more you do it, the easier it will become.

iTEf1dP3aa	Then there is some females who just dont care and still wear those 2 sizes to small jeans...thats when you feel no pitty and say "Ew".

If they feel embarrassed by the queue from a stranger it should be enough to stop them from doing it anymore. <br>  Fashion Faux pas' are unfortunate and the victims are truly put in harms way. <br>  If you feel the need to be subtle, I think you handled your particular incident rather well, I personally would've asked if she was going to be around later as I'll need somewhere to park my bike.
f7qVtYfaaa	if they are 100s of posts apart i don't even know how they could be aware that it is the same question!some people want to micro manage everything i guess.|`|bRLCxmP6aa	It depends on the question - if a person reposts a question because they didn't get a response, or many responses, to the first one, I have no problem with it. I also have no problem if they repost a question and say that they've asked this before, but they only received answers from a particular group or point of view and they'd like more diverse opinions. I agree that it's ridiculous for someone to get mad at a questioner because the same question was asked two weeks before, but that's not the usual situation.<br>  <br>  Some people post the same question multiple times in the same day, which is like nagging or hectoring, and some people post questions that have been asked and answered hundreds of times (for example, "atheists - if we evolved from monkeys, why are there still monkeys?"), which seem to be motivated by nothing more than a desire to annoy the likely respondents. That kind of thing gets old. <br>  <br>  There is a search function that is pretty easy to use, so people don't have to wade through thousands of pages of questions to find out if the one they want to ask has already been asked.|`|l2qtG4yfaa	I think people get mad when you ask the same question every single day or if you post the same question within minutes of each other.

Others ask questions that everyone has seen 50 times already. If you don't like getting negative responses, try to be a little original. If you can't put any real thought into your questions don't expect them to be well received.<br>  <br>  By the way, it is against Yahoo Answers guidelines to repeatedly post the same question.<br>  <br>  Misusing AnswersDon't create multiple accounts to troll or otherwise violate these guidelines or the Yahoo! Terms of Service. Don't post things that are incomprehensible or in the wrong language, and don't post the same question over and over again.|`|g7mD94cuaa	Because they are negative jerks. They have nothing better to do then be jerks and be negative and try to get other people to be negative too. There is no reason to get mad if someone re-posts a question. And the excuse "because people are tired of answering their questions"? Bull. If they are tired of answering their questions, then dont answer them anymore. Simple. People need to stop being so negative. They need to stop being haters. I am sick and tired of all the negative people on yahoo.

And their answers, if any,  were not what I had been looking for.<br>  Maybe it's because most of the other netizens were sleeping at the time.<br>  Though I awaited new answers for a few hours, the question was being hidden by newly posted other questions, hence no further answers.<br>  But as soon as I reposted it dozens of hours later, lots of people started to answer that question.<br>  I believe nobody would intend to complicate this international website with repeated questions.<br>  There are many non-American netizens in Yahoo!

5c9011543d498dda04d1562813072559aa	Angels definitely exist; they aren't simply good people, and they are greater than we are. The Bible says, "What is man that you are mindful of him? ... You made him a little lower than the angels" (Hebrews 2:6-7).<br>  <br>  Angels are a separate category of spiritual beings, created by God as His special messengers or helpers. They have many responsibilities, but one of their major tasks is to watch over God's people: "Are not all angels ministering spirits sent to serve those who will inherit salvation?" (Hebrews 1:14). Although they seldom take visible form, they are constantly involved in the ongoing conflict between good and evil. In the last days, Jesus said, "The angels will come and separate the wicked from the righteous" (Matthew 13:49).<br>  <br>  While the Bible doesn't give us details about their origin, it seems that angels existed before the world was created, and through all eternity they will continue to serve and praise God. We are not to worship them, however, for only God is worthy of our worship (see Revelation 22:8-9).<br>  <br>  Thank God for His angels, and for their watchful care over us; they are a sign of God's continuing love. But the greatest sign of God's love is Christ, for He alone went to the cross for our salvation. Is your hope in Him?|`|2BBKHggeaa	Yes, you are right.  More proof for you to ponder below.<br>  <br>  <br>  (1 Corinthians 4:9) For it seems to me that God has put us the apostles last on exhibition as men appointed to death, because we have become a theatrical spectacle to the world, and to angels, and to men.<br>  <br>  (Heb 10:33) sometimes while YOU were being exposed as in a theater both to reproaches and tribulations, and sometimes while YOU became sharers with those who were having such an experience<br>  <br>  (1 Pet 1:12) It was revealed to them that, not to themselves, but to YOU, they were ministering the things that have now been announced to YOU through those who have declared the good news to YOU with holy spirit sent forth from heaven. Into these very things angels are desiring to peer.<br>  <br>  (Eph 6:12) ?because we have a wrestling, not against blood and flesh, but against the governments, against the authorities, against the world rulers of this darkness, against the wicked spirit forces in the heavenly places|`|faceb0da83e7b433b86d3ae6836703f3aa	Another dimension?<br>  <br>  Angels are either Godly or ungodly. This verse is writing about Godly Angels. They have wings & are beautiful. About 7' tall or taller.<br>  <br>  The other dimension may by the spiritual realm?<br>  <br>  One can pick up the spiritual realm with their 6th or 7th sense.<br>  <br>  I like to think of the 6th sense as our soul sense and the 7th sense as our spiritual soul sense (once born of His Spirit, cleansed by His blood).<br>  <br>  It is written that everyone born into this world has seen the true light of Christ... So Jesus said that the Fathers Angels do constantly watch over the Children & constantly behold the Fathers face. So yes, everyone has their Guardian Angel. They are always there, and difficult to sense with our 6th sense because they aren't a different feeling.  And when a child becomes disobedient, they get hardened conscience, so it is even more difficult to sense ones Guardian Angel. I believe our Guardian Angels guide us through our God given conscience.<br>  <br>  And when we get disobedient or believe a lie... we can grieve our Guardian Angel.<br>  <br>  The Ministering Spirits sent forth to minister for them who shall be heirs of Salvation (Or who are heirs of Salvation.). Once saved, having the Holy Spirit seal our hearts as Gods child, then the Holy Spirit is always with us, forever. But there are also Godly Angels or Godly Saints who are with us too. The Saints in heaven become Angels (Gods Messengers), but they don't have the wings Cherebims do (God created the Sons of God, who are Winged Cherebims, first in heaven. Some names are Michael the Arch Angel, Gabriel, Raphael, etc...).|`|HqG4MDxGaa	I don't know. But I can sense that many Christian people out there who see this question or people familiar with the Bible will now dig their bibles out to see Hebrews 1:14 to see for themselves! lol :)|`|AKFlMCToaa	Friend,<br>  <br>  You are correct.  There is an entire spirit world we cannot see.  This is proven by our eyesight, which is indirect.  We do not directly see anything, but the light reflected off of things.<br>  <br>  Change the light, and these things change appearance, do they not?  Remove the light, and we see nothing, correct?  But, the objects in question are still there.<br>  <br>  There are spirits or angels, both good and evil.   God's angels serve Him and the People of God.   Angels take a keen interest in life on planet earth (I Pet. 1:12).<br>  <br>  The people who recorded things in the Bible knew all of this (and more) by direct revelation from God (II Tim. 3:16; I Cor 2:10-12).<br>  <br>  Good luck.
eb4e977a0cb9ce50b08bf74f0f3a0c61aa	Go to your local big box hardware store, like Lowes or Home Depot, and purchase 1 sheet of 1 inch thick sheet styrofoam insulation. It usually comes in 4x8 sheets, giving you more than enough to work with. Cut out your 4 walls using a hobby knife, and then draw the stones of the castle walls on the styrofoam by using a ruler. Go over these lines with a large alcohol-based marker - the alcohol will slightly "melt" the styrofoam where you draw, making perfectly recessed "mortar" lines. <br>  Paint the walls grey, and then paint your mortar lines a darker grey or black with craft paint. Cut out windows and arrow slits, and carefully cut out your castle gates or drawbridge, saving the piece you cut out for later use as the "door" - paint it to look like a wooden gate and glue it back in place using an overlapping piece of cardstock, neatly folded, as the hinge. <br>  Glue your walls together by gluing thin styrofoam "braces" in the inside corners to keep the walls together while they dry. Use a porous glue such as Elmer's wood glue, do not use solvent-based glue like superglue - it will melt the styrofoam, as will spray paint. Construct a portcullis out of popsicle sticks glued together, and painted a deep brownish black.<br>  Depending on your skill level you can do much more with sculpting styrofoam, but it all depends on your imagination.|`|DZCFD0p2aa	same as what aldrin says but it you are pressed for time I suggest you by a paper (gift paper or wall paper) with a small stone-brick pattern on it and glue it to the outside of the walls. Quicker than the tissue thing. For best results though, I used the mud for the drywall (if you have any left over from when they built your house) or papier-mache and then paint when dry.<br>  Also, the rolls from the paper towels or toilet paper make good towers (unless you're going with square keeps).|`|peIBQH6aaa	Making a medieval castle (if that is to create one like a mini-one)<br>  create little boxes with identical sizes (the smaller the better yet the harder >.<) and then prepare a water glue mixture (glue > water) then use a paintbrush to cover the boxes with the mixture..then cover the box w/ mixture with tissue (that is to create texture). After that use a blower to dry the boxes and then paint them light gray..then put them on top of each other forming either towers or walls...<br>  <br>  It is your choice if you leave it like 2 towers plus some walls then some holes for the entrance and some windows..but I prefer a bridge that serves like a door ..made from popsicle sticks colored wood brown..and some deep holes around the castle..those deep ring forming hole should be covered with blue cellophane to create a water effect..<br>  <br>  The other additional thingys is up to you, your time and your creativity..<br>  <br>  If you mean to make a medieval castle is to draw..well,,that;s kinda unfortunate..for you and shameful for me..wahaha..:))|`|Ex3XC0ayaa	Here, hope this works for you and good luck...<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.enchantedlearning.com/crafts/Boxcastle.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.enchantedlearning.com/crafts/...</a>
CEChcfKwaa	You don't become a lesbian. Being lesbian is not a choice, it is an identity. Hating men does not equate to being lesbian since most lesbians do not hate men. They just are not sexually attracted to them.<br>  <br>  Add:<br>  Maybe you just need to take a break from romance and concentrate on school or work and friends and family. It sounds like you've been hurt. We all get hurt. All you can do is give yourself time to get over it. Unless you are sexually attracted to women only, you are not lesbian and you can't make yourself become one.|`|283tO9j9aa	You have to be born lesbian- sexually attracted to women and not men. If you're just pissed off at men but you still find yourself attracted to them, there's no way you're going to be a lesbian any time soon.<br>  <br>  My advice is to find yourself a nicer man. Don't look in clubs, clubs are full of douchebags.|`|yPy4gFZ9aa	hate to disappoint u but its not like homosexuality is a choice. ull have to take revenge on men in an other way...|`|WAoNhHB1aa	Um, being a lesbian is something you're born with.|`|Qt3Zqfviaa	date girls?|`|ZbpaRKkUaa	Isn't being a woman tough enough?

rlEoPwjEaa	Unfortunately Yanling..thats how American Schools are.<br>  <br>  But this is not neccessarily a bad thing. Alot of kids these days start having sex at earlier ages. And alot of schools dont teach about abstinance education because they probably figure " whats the point? They're just gonna end up doing it anyhow." So They try to do the next best thing. Teach them about sexual protection. Whether they think about what effect doing this has...Im not sure.<br>  <br>  I definately do not advocate sex amongst school aged children. But I know some of them will end up doing it...So at least teaching them about protection can keep them from becoming parents at such a young age. <br>  <br>  If you have children...or have them someday...The best thing to do when they get older and get interested in the opposite sex is to talk to them about it. One mistake i think parents make is that they dont want to talk to thier kids about sex( because its embarrassing..and parents dont want thier kids to grow up)..so the kid ends up learning about it elsewhere. You can honestly only teach them..and hope they make good choices on what they were taught.|`|yPy4gFZ9aa	ya, 18 is sooo much too young...<br>  <br>  dont think kids r stupid. u cant stop them from having sex anyway, so its better to give them contraception so they dont have to handle unwanted consequences|`|xWGJHMkuaa	It depends. In a school that doesn't teach birth control in it's health classes, free condoms are a must, IMO. The kids are going to have sex anyway and few have been educated about the subject. As for schools that DO teach birth control, I don't think they are neccesary.|`|vbAu5SY3aa	Kids are having sex as young as in sixth grade. They don't think about using protection because they don't know where to get it or ask for it...but they have the sex anyway. Don't you think they should at least take protection with them to do what they are already doing.<br>  It would be really great if parents would just NOT let their kids go off anytime and anywhere they want. Parents should know who their children are with and make sure adult supervision is near. They should also talk more often to their kids about this kind of thing. Parents who are not paying attention need to step up into the role of guardian...|`|cJRFbZUaaa	Using your logic, teaching kids about seat belts encourages reckless driving!  <br>  <br>  Kids are way smarter than you give them credit for.<br>  <br>  Condom education is just part of an overall program aimed at educating kids about the risks of sex.  I always tell kids to hold off having sex until they're ready to take the responsibilities for their health.  And if they don't know what condoms are, they won't use them during sex and get pregnant and spread disease.  Is that what you want?|`|8nZtWHiBaa	so u want ppl to have unprotected sex??? surely if u tell them about sex maybe they will use their brains and wait a bit instead of leaving them in the dark|`|NTrBagbHaa	well i think it really depends on what age the students are. Obviously, if they're giving them away to students in middle school i would be concerned. I think that kids are going to do what they want no matter what the parents say. Its really a win lose situation...if you give them the condoms then they'll use them (that's the goal at least, and to lessen the chance of pregnancy), but they could have sex just because they have the condoms. It really depends on how you look at the situation.|`|rU7ZjIHKaa	I don't think that providing free condoms is sending any message other than it is important to practice safe sex. High school students aren't so young that they don't understand the concept of a condom. <br>  <br>  It had been argued repeatedly that since high school students are having sex more and more frequently anyway, and teen pregnancy is always on the rise, that providing condoms can only help matters.|`|BZegmux2aa	No, it does not give that message.  Kids were having sex in high school (and middle school, which is way gross) long before anyone suggested giving out condoms.  That's WHY they want to give out condoms - they know a lot of kids are having sex anyway and they are trying to educate them about at least being safe.|`|CLw0gffNaa	i thought the same as you before, but i guess its a matter of not telling and letting them get pregnant or letting the kids know and prevent unnecessary pregnancy <br>  also with the media nowadays, kids would get to learn about sex really soon anyway, like how you hear on news kids at 10 started to have sex etc|`|JUfoPMLAaa	First US government has TO  stop fiance help to  unmarried couples  ( single parent) having kids. They should be punished.<br>  <br>  We have many unfortunate children whose neither father or mother is known to them.<br>  <br>  Your suggestion will add to  their pain and worries  to unfortunate - unborn child. The society will have more irresponsible parents and add to crimes and social  problems.<br>  <br>  <br>  CHILDREN ARE SUPPOSED TO GO TO SCHOOL AND STUDY WELL TO BE A GOOD HONORABLE CITIZEN - NOT FOR IM-MATURED AGED SEX .|`|hEEcpV9kaa	You are so stupid. The kids are going to have sex regardless! Besides the moms and dads (if they even know who their dads are) want us to do this. At my school 13 to 15 year olds are regularly having sex, so they might as well enjoy it safely. <br>  <br>  I have seen your answers to my questions and I think you ae some kind of FOX news groupie hate-monger.
MH5dUNnxaa	Be careful. Many such 'services' that advertise in newspapers are rackets. They advertise that they will pickup your junk (or still running) car FREE but when you call them they'll say there's a 'charge' usually about fifty bucks. I believe the 'charities' they claim to represent (assuming they exist) receive little or nil - and the junkyards make a fortune off the parts!|`|BNlSh53faa	None of them work like that.

AA10276327	The New World Translation of the Bible was completed in 1961 by the Watchtower Tract and Bible Society. The Watchtower Tract and Bible Society is also known as the Jehovah's Witnesses. The New World Translation is not a true translation of the Bible. Rather, it is an intentional editing of the Bible in order to promote the beliefs of the Jehovah's Witnesses. The New World Translation is identical to other Bible translations in many places. The differences arise when something was stated in the Bible with which the Jehovah's Witnesses disagree. Whatever verses and passages in the Bible that did not agree with the teaching of the Jehovah's Witnesses were edited or removed. <br>  <br>  The New World Translation is the ultimate example of a religious group altering the Bible in order to promote a particular sect. Here are some examples: <br>  <br>  Genesis 1:2 (KJV), "And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters." Genesis 1:2 (NWT), "Now the earth proved to be formless and waste and there was darkness upon the surface of [the] watery deep; and God's active force was moving to and fro over the surface of the waters." <br>  <br>  The Jehovah's Witnesses do not believe that the Holy Spirit is a person or is God, rather they believe Him to be a figure of God's power. <br>  <br>  John 1:1 (NKJV), "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God." John 1:1 (NWT), "In (the) beginning the Word was, and the Word was with God, and the Word was a god." This change was made because Jehovah's Witnesses do not believe that Jesus is God. Rather, Jehovah's witnesses believe Jesus is a created being, the highest of the angels. <br>  <br>  The New World Translation is not a translation of the Bible. It is an intentional perversion of the Bible in order to promote the doctrines of the Jehovah's Witnesses. The names of the "translators" of the New World Translation have been for the most part kept secret. It has been revealed that those responsible for the New World Translation had no knowledge of Hebrew and Greek and no experience in the field of Bible translation|`|tx4bRDrXaa	(Genesis 1:2) Now the earth proved to be formless and waste and there was darkness upon the surface of [the] watery deep; and God’s active force was moving to and fro over the surface of the waters.<br>  <br>  KJV And the earth was without form and void and darkness was upon th face of the deep and Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.The Hebrew word Rua ch is used here in both instances ,it is translated active force or Spirit of God.|`|TyRfv0eoaa	Can you supply the translation? I only have a NWT New Testament, and I would like to compare their translation to the Hebrew.<br>  <br>  Edit: Hebrew transliteration:<br>  Veha'aretz haytah tohu vavohu vechoshech al p'nei t'hom veruach Elohim merachefet al p'nei hamayim.<br>  <br>  Literal translation:<br>  And the earth was utter chaos (tohu vavohu - topsy turvy), and darkness upon the face of the deep (abyss), and spirit of God hovers (or soars) on the face of the waters.<br>  <br>  Parentheses mine for explanation or alternate translations.<br>  <br>  I'm a former Hebrew teacher. I used Ben Yehuda's dictionary to confirm translation.|`|EBGdlo35aa	A good question regarding the New World Translation.  As far as *I* know, the ancient Hebrew word meaning "spirit, breath, wind"<br>  <a href="http://www.studybibleforum.com/htm_php.php3?do=show_marg_and_gh&b=1&c=1&v=2#7307" rel="nofollow">http://www.studybibleforum.com/htm_php.p...</a><br>  is *never* translated by *anyone* else (in any ancient Hebrew writing!) as "active force".  Now, that does not mean that it is a *wrong* translation.  However, it is a sort of over-generalization.  By that I mean:  it's sort of like translating "solar radiation" as "energy".  "Active force" is a very "neutering" translation - it removes all nuances of the original language word, just as "energy" removes the "solar" and "radiant" aspects from *that* phrase.  Note, though, that imprecise is NOT the same as inaccurate.  The NWT translation of that particular word (and similarly the Greek word in the New Testament) seems to me (not an expert!) to be valid, but poor.<br>  <br>  "Spirit" is normally chosen because it includes a nuance of "breath" (re. "respiration").  However, that can *also* be considered lacking in precision because the word *can* possess alternate meanings.  For example, the excellent New Jerusalem Bible uses the phrase "divine wind" here - "wind" being a as well-accepted a translation of this Hebrew word as is "spirit".<br>  <br>  So, you *could* argue that "active force" is inclusive of all of the meanings of the Hebrew word and therefore a more precise translation - but I think you would be hard-pressed to support such a claim with logic.  "Active force" does not include the nuances of wind, breath OR spirit.<br>  <br>  My preliminary review of the NWT<br>  <a href="http://www.jimpettis.com/bibles/nwt.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.jimpettis.com/bibles/nwt.htm</a><br>  <br>  Jim, <a href="http://www.bible-reviews.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.bible-reviews.com</a>|`|fxHEZGcCaa	Greetings,<br>  <br>  People like to blindly make the prejudicial charge that the NWT is not a true or accurate translation, or that it has intentionally altered the Bible wherever it did not agree with the Witnesses’ teaching. This claim is completely false and displays a complete ignorance of the Bible or its languages and lacks the most basic competence for accurate research.<br>  <br>  Jehovah’s Witnesses do not translate the Bible in line with their beliefs, rather they bring their beliefs into line with the Bible. Ninety-nine percent of the Witnesses beliefs were formulated long before the NWT was around and most of the time we still study with others and prove our beliefs from the KJV and other translations.<br>  <br>  Contrary to some statements here, notice how other translators have also rendered the word RUAH in Gen. 1:2:<br>  <br>  NJB: “Now the earth was a formless void, there was darkness over the deep, with a DIVINE WIND sweeping over the waters.”<br>  NAB: “the earth was a formless wasteland, and darkness covered the abyss, while a MIGHTY WIND swept over the waters.”<br>  TEV (1976): “and THE POWER of God was moving over the water."<br>  NRSV: “the earth was a formless void and darkness covered the face of the deep, while A WIND from God swept over the face of the waters.”<br>  Knox: "and darkness hung over the deep; but already, over its waters, stirred THE BREATH of God." <br>  Jewish Publication Society: "with darkness over the surface of the deep and A WIND from God sweeping over the water"<br>  Everett Fox: "rushing-spirit of God hovering over the face of the waters." --The Five Books of Moses (Schocken, 1995), <br>  <br>  Most of these translators believe that the HS was a person, so they cannot be accused of bias. Rather they all saw that the word RUAH as here used here required more than just the rendering “spirit” to accurately convey its sense. So the claim that the NW Translators were motivated by any theological bias is a lie.<br>  <br>  God’s “wind” or “spirit” is dynamic or active, not passive like wind or contained like the “spirit” within humans. God’s spirit is never latent, dormant, or inactive. It is always moving and energetic. So the translation “spirit” or “wind” may be accurate but it does not convey the full sense of God’s Spirit.<br>  <br>  Standard reference works agree that God’s Spirit is an “active force”:<br>  <br>  Dr. Alan J. Hauser writes: "Let us briefly examine the use of ‘spirit of God’ in the Old Testament. The first part of the phrase, ‘spirit of,’ is commonly used in the construct state in Hebrew to denote the MOTIVATING FORCE or DYNAMIC POWER of a person or of God...2Chron.36:22...Ezra 1:1...1Chron.5:26...In these instances ‘spirit of' does not denote an entity in any way separate from the person but rather the ACTIVE, FORCEFUL POWER of that person (cf. also Gen.45:27; 2Kings 2:15; 1Sam.30:12; Hag.1:14). Why should we presume that it is different when the object of the phrase ‘spirit of’ is God?...There is no hint of a separate person within the Godhead acting upon the individual...see, for example, 2Ki.2:16; 1Sam.10:6; 11:6)"--The Genesis Debate; 118, 119.<br>  <br>  Commenting on Genesis 1:2; Job 33:4 and Psalm 33:6, Swete writes: "The Spirit of God is the VITAL POWER which belongs to the Divine Being, and is seen to be operative in the world and in men. It is the Divine Energy which is the origin of all created life."-- Swete, The Holy Spirit in the New Testament (1909), page 2.<br>  <br>  "The Spirit...is the ruah ('breath,' 'wind') of God, the OUTGOING DIVINE ENERGY AND POWER." --The New Bible Dictionary, J. D. Douglas (1962), page 531.<br>  <br>  The most basic meaning of RUAH is variously defined as 'blowing' (Kamalah, NIDNTT, 690), 'air in motion' (TDOT 2:836; Reiling. DDD, 792).<br>  <br>  "The phrase describes not chaos but the creative power of God in action. Wind, a symbol of power, is used theologically in the Old Testament to refer to THE DYNAMIC ACTIVITY and presence of God in the world - his Spirit." -Genesis 1-11 Cambridge Bible Commentary, Robert Davidson (1973), page 16.<br>  <br>  All of these, and many other dictionaries and lexicons state that RUAH should have the sense of a “dynamic,” “active,” “vital,” or “forceful” energy.<br>  <br>  So just a little basic research would keep people from gullibly or dishonestly repeating these inaccurate and biased accusations as we commonly find promoted by individuals who cannot support their doctrines with real evidence from God’s Word.<br>  <br>  The translation offered by the New World Translation Committee, and these other translators, is the result of sound translational principles regarding definitions and context.<br>  <br>  Those who argue against the translations “wind” or “active force”are the ones motivated by theological bias. They desperately want to support their belief that God’s Spirit is a person even though there is no sound reason or scripture which supports such an idea.<br>  <br>  The Catholic Encyclopedia states: "Nowhere in the Old Testament do we find any clear indication of a Third Person." "The OT clearly does not envisage God's spirit as a person...God's spirit is simply God's power....The majority of NT texts reveal God's spirit as something, not someone; this is especially seen in the parallelism between the spirit and the power of God."<br>  <br>  The Holy Spirit is always something that *belongs* to God, specifically His "wind" or "breath." No one ever talks to it, prays to it nor does it have a name. The Old Testament did not teach that the Spirit of God was a "person," but rather it was the active or dynamic force of God the Father. The word RUACH is used of a literal force, the wind and of a person's breath. This usage teaches us that God's Spirit (wind) is not a person: it is a force.<br>  <br>  Yours,<br>  <br>  Ron Rhoades|`|3aVxJYf6aa	Niceguy <br>  <br>  probably all the bible you mention have also the false verse of 1 John 5:7 as an added verse......<br>  <br>  Why you use a bible that have a false verse??|`|31M2IDw2aa	They are NOT Christians, are you surprised that they have corrupted the Bible?|`|j5YwuVEIaa	You can actually read the New World Translation online at www.watchtower.org.<br>  <br>  As for the scripture here is some good info:<br>  <br>  According to Parkhurst’s Greek and English Lexicon to the New Testament (London, 1845, p.?2), the Greek a′bys·sos means “very or exceedingly deep.” According to Liddell and Scott’s Greek-English Lexicon (Oxford, 1968, p.?4), it means “unfathomable, boundless.” The Greek Septuagint uses it regularly to translate the Hebrew tehohm′ (watery deep), as at Genesis 1:2; 7:11.<br>  <br>  Also:<br>  <br>  Its Use in Creation. Jehovah God accomplished the creation of the material universe by means of his spirit, or active force. Regarding the planet Earth in its early formative stages, the record states that “God’s active force [or “spirit” (ru′ach)] was moving to and fro over the surface of the waters.” (Ge 1:2) Psalm 33:6 says: “By the word of Jehovah the heavens themselves were made, and by the spirit of his mouth all their army.” Like a powerful breath, God’s spirit can be sent forth to exert power even though there is no bodily contact with that which is acted upon. (Compare Ex 15:8,?10.) Where a human craftsman would use the force of his hands and fingers to produce things, God uses his spirit. Hence that spirit is also spoken of as God’s “hand” or “fingers.”—Compare Ps 8:3; 19:1; Mt 12:28 with Lu 11:20.<br>  Modern science speaks of matter as organized energy, like bundles of energy, and recognizes that “matter can be changed into energy and energy into matter.” (The World Book Encyclopedia, 1987, Vol. 13, p. 246) The immensity of the universe that man has thus far been able to discern with his telescopes gives some slight concept of the inexhaustible source of energy to be found in Jehovah God. As the prophet wrote: “Who has taken the proportions of the spirit of Jehovah?”—Isa 40:12, 13, 25,?26.|`|bWmOaK33aa	Hey, never trust a religion that would let you die rather than giving you a blood transfusion.|`|vtafeEIJaa	i love to know

This is how the board/ senior management gain assurance that all activities carried out by their corporation are properly controlled.  Google 'corporate governance' and perhaps try one of the major audit sites such as the IIA for an overview of why corporate governance is important.

YvvnTrxDaa	Tattyman they go to be with the Lord.  If they are in Christ he doesn't chuck em out , nothing can come between Christ and his saved one.<br>  <br>  These people are saying that it's an Unforgivable sin, It's not.  The Unforgivable sin is unbelief, because if you don't believe then how can you ask forgiveness and be forgiven.<br>  <br>  People in pain sometimes commit this sin, but it's not Unforgivable.  Once you are saved you HAVE ALWAYS been forgiven, if you continue in sin then you become out of fellowship.<br>  <br>  The new covenant is irrevocable.|`|eph8JOhBaa	he/she dies and will never live to explain why life was so horrible that they had to do it.

They may well have been clinically depressed, and didn't have the help they needed.<br>  <br>  If I, as a human being, can understand that, surely God can.|`|5c9011543d498dda04d1562813072559aa	Whenever I answer a question like this, I'm deeply aware that someone may be reading this who is seriously contemplating suicide—and I would do everything in my power to convince them not to take that final, drastic step. With Christ there is always hope.<br>  <br>  God loves them; He loves them so much that Jesus Christ was willing to die on the cross for their salvation. And others care about them, as well (even if they have a hard time believing it). Suicide is never God's will, and even in the midst of life's worst storms we can look to Christ and discover that He truly is "an anchor for the soul, firm and secure" (Hebrews 6:19). The first step back from the brink of suicide is to turn to Christ and open our hearts to Him.<br>  <br>  <br>  David<br>  believer_in_jesus37421@yahoo.com|`|4VouLn4waa	From a biblical perspective, they commit a mortal sin which cannot be repented and suffer eternal punishment.<br>  From a literal perspective, they die and become confined by 6 foot walls|`|HRUkmBBxaa	they die and rot  then the worms have their dinner :) .and the christian waits for Judgement day<br>  but it depends on why they have killed themselves then they might go to heaven|`|dqZrq7Zeaa	They leave a devastated family behind that will never really recover.

This is due to the Christian in question having turned away from God by not having faith that God could resolve the particular issues and circumstances of hopelessness that usually lead to a consideration of suicide as an option in the first place.<br>  <br>  Unless this is a trick question. A Christian is a Christian due to a total belief in Jesus and God. Therefore a true Christian should never reach the point of complete hopelessness that leads to suicide.|`|NW1oQMtGaa	Whether you are a christian or not,fake christian or true christian,if you do not received any mysteries of the kingdom of Light,surely your soul will be boil and toasted to and fro at Amente and recast back into the world as new babe with a punishment attached into it...say you will have a suicide phobia..ahehe...<br>  <br>  Why do you commit suicide?do you not love your life?..death is not the solution to your problem...as long as you live there is always be hope...if you use your brain...|`|zoAqdu1Jaa	I just lost a friend on Saturday from a heroin overdose. (believed suicide) I hate to think that someone that was so hurt in life would go to hell. I don't believe that and I am a Christian. I don't care what the bible says to be honest. This really bothers me. I have lost so many people to suicide and I have tried to commit it myself, but I was lucky. I was in a place of loneliness, despair, anger and hurt. I know God was by my side, I could feel it in me. I can't accept that they go to hell and are punished for eternity. :(|`|C33dNHSDaa	I personally feel if a person is a true born again Christian they would not take their own life. Because the Holy Spirit in someone that is saved wouldn't even think of taking their own life for any reason.They may wish for death because of things in their lives but not at their own hands.<br>   As far as someone taking their own life what happens who knows? You'll just have to wait and find out from God.We don't know what frame of mind someone gets into.And with out God in their heart - it possible for the devil to put them up to all kinds of things.|`|P5rczL0Saa	That is a tough and very good question. Suicide is one of those controversial topics. The Word of God states that murder is a sin. Suicide would be considered self murder. Just like any suicide, we cannot know if that person had a change of heart before they died, or not. We cannot know whether they are a Christian committing suicide, or an unbeliever, who repents while they are dying. It would have to be TRUE repentance, because Only God knows the heart of that person at the time of their demise. It's God's call. Not mine, not yours, not anyone else's. So, I can't give you a direct answer to a question that calls for God's judgment alone.|`|vouUQQzBaa	According to the Roman Catholic church, it is a mortal sin thus won't be accepted in Heaven.<br>  In many parts of Italy (won't say all as I'm not sure), the person who committed suicide cannot receive a holy ceremony and proper catholic burial|`|faceb0da83e7b433b86d3ae6836703f3aa	A Christian who is spiritually sealed by the Holy Spirit of Promise, who is born of Gods Spirit... their spiritual soul will go to heaven when they die. Their body is buried & turned to dirt.<br>  <br>  That is believing that the Christian is on the fundamental foundation. The Rock, Jesus Christ the Son of the Living God. Once on the Rock Foundation; then we build on it everlasting or perishable. The obedience to God is everlasting. The errors or lies we believe are the perishable. Then the day comes that these are tested by fire. And the lies & perishable get fried.<br>  <br>  When a Christian gets suicidal, they have forgetten who they are in Christ. They have not renewed their mind in Gods Word. They believe the condemnation of the devil. They don't forgive others who wronged them, so are turned over to the tormentors. That can feel like hell on earth.<br>  <br>  So? If they would just get back to the top. Repent to God for not trusting His love for them... They would have been filled with Gods blessed assurance.<br>  <br>  But being a disobedient Christian, trying to abide in sin... (It isn't possible for one born of God to abide in sin, because of the Holy Spirit conviction.).  They sometimes get to the point of suicide. This itself is a great sin that causes our Holy Spirit to Grieve.<br>  <br>  Because the Holy Spirit has sealed us unto the day of Redemption. We are the temple of God, the Holy Spirit dwells in us. And to kill self is total lack of faith in Gods love for us.<br>  <br>  The Pastor had preached that two died & both were Christians. One was faithful till the end. Jesus said to her, well done my faithful servant... Receive the rewards I have planned for you...<br>  The other who didn't trust God... yet did trust God in the beginning & got on the Rock Foundation... stood before Jesus. Jesus asked him why he didn't trust His love for him. That He had planned so many rewards to give him. Now that he had committed suicide, Jesus couldn't give him those rewards. Jesus said that since he was still His child, his inheritance in the Kingdom of God is still the same. So he gets to go to heaven.<br>  <br>  Now if a Christian who had never received Jesus atonement for their sins; past, present & future... Were never born of Gods Spirit, cleansed by His blood... But were on the fence, & committed suicide, then they die & are still held accountable for their sins. And this person wouldn't go to heaven.|`|tqQIcLb5aa	R?wan,<br>  <br>  That's not Catholic teaching, no wonder your an ex-Catholic, if you were always a misinformed one.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/para/2282.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/para/2282....</a>|`|fjidmhxsaa	Hell.<br>  <br>  Suicide is one of the acts which we can ask for forgiveness for. for once you commit suicide - which is a sin, you can't repent / ask God for forgiveness|`|MF9YknDYaa	They die,there is no afterlife or god,just eternal nothingness.remember much about what you were doing a thousand years ago?no,that's just like death.|`|SWOeg0jFaa	they die, just like everybody else who commits suicide.|`|0LTqyhz1aa	They destroy a bit of the people around them.|`|O5KOwhovaa	They die.|`|fHpPgMlZaa	They die.|`|b06d5f5c50bd7cf1d8a2a3aedfcc1c94aa	They die|`|aTFJ5TM2aa	death|`|n6zHBxY8aa	Ok I am a Lutheran (Christian) this is what happens....<br>  God gives you life, it is not your life to take your own or someone else's.<br>  If you take your life, it is not your right to and youll go to hell.<br>  God gives people life because he believes in us and nothing can be so bad that your going to take away one of th ebest gives that any being can give you.<br>  So if your Christian and u commit suicide youll go to hell.<br>  <br>  Think what you want of us, but if u think we r stupid for our thoughts ur wrong, because we belive ours r true as u believe urs r|`|fhOlbSWaaa	=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=<br>  Dear friend,<br>  Please read my ANSWER CAREFULLY and follow the links, books & Videos, all free of charge, which provided below …<br>  =*=*=*=*=*=*=*=<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  THE TRUTH OF THE LIFE OF THIS WORLD (Video)<br>  <a href="http://api.fmanager.net/api_v1/productDetail.php?dev-t=EDCRFV&objectId=1276" rel="nofollow">http://api.fmanager.net/api_v1/productDe...</a><br>  <br>  Wickedness, injustice,grief, pessimism,trouble, loneliness, fear, stress, frustration, distrust, unscrupulousness,anxiety, rage, jealousy, resentment, drug addiction,immorality, gambling, prostitution, hunger, poverty, social corruption, theft, war, struggle, violence, oppression, fear of death…News about these issues appear in the newspapers and on TV every day.The popular press devotes entire pages to these subjects, while others serialise articles about their psychological and social aspects. However,our acquaintance with these feelings is not limited solely to the press; in daily life,we,too,frequently come across such problems and, more importantly, personally experience them. <br>  People and societies endeavour to liberate themselves from the distressing experiences,disorder and repressive social structures that have prevailed over the world for long periods. <br>  We only need to glance at ancient Greece; the Great Roman Empire; Tsarist Russia, or the so-called Age of Enlightenment, and even the 20th century-a century of misery which saw two world wars and world-wide social disasters. No matter upon which century or location you concentrate your research, the picture will not be appreciably different. <br>  If this is the case, why haven't people succeeded in solving these problems, or at least some efforts been made to remove such social diseases from society?<br>  People have encountered these problems in all ages, yet each time they have failed to find any solutions because the methods they employed were inappropriate. They sought various solutions, tried different political systems, laid down impracticable and totalitarian rules, stirred up revolutions or subscribed to perverted ideologies, while many others preferred to adopt an indifferent attitude and merely accepted the status quo. <br>  In our day, people are almost numbed by this way of living. They readily believe these problems to be "facts of life." They picture a society immune to these problems as being nothing short of impossible-a dream utopia. They persistently and openly express their distaste for such a way of living, yet easily embrace it, since they think they have no other alternative. <br>  The resolution of all these problematic issues is possible only by living by the principles of the "true religion." Only when the values of true religion prevail can a pleasant and tranquil scene replace this gloomy and unfavourable picture, which is doomed to continue so long as God's limits are ignored. To put it another way, people are enslaved by these complications as long as they avoid the values of the Qur'an. Put simply, this is the "nightmare of disbelief" and the link below for this wonderful book:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://fs.harunyahya.net/popup/Download.php?WorkNumber=256&Format=pdf" rel="nofollow">http://fs.harunyahya.net/popup/Download....</a><br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  you will find how the regulation of life by the "norms of morality" introduced by the Qur'an revealed to mankind by God will banish the "nightmare of disbelief," how pessimism, corruption and social restlessness can be eliminated from society, how the individual can surround himself with an ideal environment, what spiritual and material benefits he is likely to attain by adherence to these norms of morality are gone into in detail, and finally, that the unique alternative to all these problems is the morality of the Qur'an. <br>  So far, many books have attempted to deal with the social and psychological problems societies face. Yet, what distinguishes this book from others is its stress on the most realistic solution. It also sincerely warns people against the troublesome future they are likely to face if they fail to resort to this solution. <br>  We expect that every reader of conscience will grasp that peace, mutual trust and an ideal social life is attainable only by embracing the values of the Qur'an and will turn to the true religion, which is Islam. <br>  They will then happily join the ranks of those who never suffer, mentally or physically, from any of the above-mentioned complications. Around them, there will always be an abundance of favours, comfort, love, respect, peace and confidence, and moral virtues will prevail. They will know how to earn God's approval, by observing His limits and the commandments of the Qur'an. They will thus, by having faith in God, attain His mercy and at last enter Paradise. <br>  <br>  Useful link:<br>  (A BRIEF ILLUSTRATED GUIDE TO UNDERSTANDING ISLAM)<br>  <a href="http://www.islam-guide.com/islam-guide.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.islam-guide.com/islam-guide.p...</a><br>  <br>  DEEP THINKING (VIDEO):<br>  <a href="http://api.fmanager.net/api_v1/productDetail.php?dev-t=EDCRFV&objectId=1124" rel="nofollow">http://api.fmanager.net/api_v1/productDe...</a><br>   <br>  <br>  =* FOR ANY HELP FEEL FREE TO E-MAIL ME ON *=<br>  smiling4ever222@hotmail.com|`|36QJQXXyaa	Suicide is usually a result of mental illness.

mVTGl6HGaa	The very act of conceptually dividing populations into groups is controversial.<br>  <br>  Among physical anthropolgists at least, support for dividing populations by "race" has fallen steadily over the past century.[66] Where 78 percent of the articles in the 1931 Journal of Physical Anthropology employed these or similar synonymous terms reflecting a bio-race paradigm, only 36 percent did so in 1965, and just 28 percent did in 1996.[67] The paradigm has also lost favor among medical researchers and practitioners. In February, 2001, the editors of the medical journal Archives of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine asked authors to no longer use "race" as explanatory variable nor to use obsolescent terms. Others prestigious peer-reviewed journals, such as the New England Journal of Medicine and the American Journal of Public Health have done the same.[68] Furthermore, the National Institutes of Health recently issued a program announcement for grant applications through February 1, 2006, specifically seeking researchers who can investigate and publicize among primary care physicians the detrimental effects on the nation's health of the practice of medical racial profiling using such terms The program announcement quoted the editors of one journal as saying that, "analysis by race and ethnicity has become an analytical knee-jerk reflex." [69]<br>  <br>  Such criticisms suggest that "racial" terms (Black, White, Asian or Caucasoid, *******, Mongoloid) reify the "race" notion and perpetuate the simplistic and demonstrably false notion that H. sapiens can genetically be divided into a specific set of 3-8 distinct groups which can then be objectively delineated to everyone's agreement.[70] Humanity can be grouped or classified in many different ways, of course, either genetically (as, for instance, by blood type, lactose tolerance, skin tone, or the neutral markers of prehistoric migrations) or politically (as in U.S. EEOC regulations). And whether any such classification scheme matches any particular individual's notion of "race" depends upon the individual.<br>  <br>  Nevertheless, as mentioned above (Differences among U.S. voluntary ethnic self-identity groups), there are considerable public health disparities among U.S. ethnic groups. Clearly, the subject must be studied in order to bring about a more equitable society, and it is hard to see how to do this without labeling the social groups being studied. Similarly (as mentioned in Differences associated with continent-of-ancestry admixture ratios), increasing numbers of public health differences throughout the Western Hemisphere are found to correlate with Euro-Afro-Amerind genetic admixture ratios in New World populations. Again, one must label the phenomenon in order to study it.

RoqxGbgRaa	of course, this all depends on one's social environment at the time, but generally speaking, i think many people consider it socially incorrect to display anger in its full force.  it is perfectly acceptable to most folks to show displeasure or irritation in a way that is much more verbal than physical.  and by verbal, i don't mean the high-flying curses and threats of violence we have a tendency to use when we've been angered or offended.  i mean a direct, but self-possessed, highly measured expression of what we are feeling, why we are upset, and what needs to happen to rectify the situation.<br>  <br>  there is accorded a certain respect to someone who can calmly and articulately express why a certain situation is unacceptable, while keeping white fiery heat out of the conversation.  and the people to whom we are speaking usually respond quickly to set things right.|`|5FVyVS9vaa	They say it is, but there also is a limit as to how far you can push a person before they react.|`|yk4S7uuraa	Yes, but things happen, and sometimes the outburst is already over when you realize that it shouldn't have happened.<br>  <br>  If that happens its best to walk away and not make any future references to it.|`|KcAehrrKaa	People tend to look down on you for doing it, but it really depends who you're with.|`|85a0fa252f2147419dc9d5d05017495eaa	not when it is justified|`|BpTlXUj9aa	idk|`|oZqoxgc7aa	There's not really any such thing as social incorrectness, inappropriate yes. but wether showing anger is inappropriate entirely depends on your particular social scene. At work, it's only appropriate to show anger to the person who instigated it (unless that person is your boss).<br>  Typically I would say try not so show anger when you meet somebody new, but if people already know you, they will know wether you're "just like that" or if it's something out of the ordinary for you. It's often very important to shw anger, especially if you're a very timid person, otherwise people will walk all over you.|`|DC4Civrvaa	It depends on the circumstances.  If something has done something wrong to you as a customer/client in a business, I believe it is ok to demonstrate to them that their wrong-doing has upset you.  I don't believe it is ok to react like that woman in China did, throwing herself all over the place.  Don't overdo it!|`|qlNfbBMvaa	it all depends on the situation. your asking it as an absolute: either its always bad to show anger or never bad to show anger, which is a false dilemma.|`|1IzphjzKaa	no, but i am the kind of person that cant be mean and bottles everything up.

z7aGxtznaa	He's being a little selfish, if you ask me. He's got to understand that your driven and that this wasn't something you just wanted out of the blue, this is your life, and if he wants these kids and this family, then your going to have to get a good job to provide for them! You just have conflicting interests, but if he loves you enough then you he will stand by you, he's just hurting right now and maybe thats why he doesn't want to talk to you? At the end of the day, you have got to put yourself first, if you gave up your dreams for him, then maybe you'll just feel resentment in the future, having given up everything you wanted for him.
8G42oyydaa	He is a "great" person but when you want to pursue your dreams, you are being selfish because you arent sacrificing them for him? Its his way or no way and he is such a great person?  He is selfish, self centred, immature, and a bully but he is such a great person? <br>  <br>  He said you were only thinking about yourself, how dare you even think of yourself and ot him,  because you arent thinking ONLY of him and letting him dominate and control you, and how DARE you have a dream that isnt all about being dependent on and subservant  to him, and he is such a great person? <br>  <br>  He has cut off communication because you dared to disagree with him or express an independent opinion, which BTW is a form of abuse, and he is such a GREAT person?  <br>  <br>  Its your body, your mind, your future, your dream and he is mad at you because you havent given control of yourself, mind, body and soul to him, and he is such a GREAT person?  What am I missing here? Better yet, what are YOU missing?<br>  <br>  The last time I checked women werent chattel and any sensible young woman would run like hell from a man like this.  Unless you want to be bullied, intimidated, controlled, dominated, disrespected, abused, used and treated like a doormat, HIS doormat your entire married life, that is<br>  <br>  Be thankful you found this out now rather than later. If its a long distance relationship you havent even spent time together getting to REALLY know each other.  <br>  <br>  He has finally shown his true colours to you.  A male friend of mine said "why dont women get it that when a man shows his "true colours" to a woman THIS is who he REALLY is, not the person he pretended to be before that."<br>  <br>  Have you ever heard that love isnt supposed to hurt?  He is an abuser, because not talking to you as a mature functional adult person would, and giving you the cold shoulder in order to "put you in your place" IS a form of abuse.  <br>  <br>  And this is NOT love. When you love someone you want them to follow their dreams, be happy, you want them to be an equal partner, and to be the best they can be.   <br>  <br>  He doesnt love you.   <br>  <br>  He wants you uneducated, pregnant with lots of children and completely dependent on him and subservant because of your situation. THIS is his "dream" of your future together. Not the same dream at all is it?<br>  <br>  Cut him out of your life, let go of the dream you had for yourselves as a couple, happily married ever after and all that. Its a good dream, but you chose the wrong man to play the role in it. In your dream YOU were happy too, not just him, and he wasnt emotionally abusive to you, he was a loving caring partner. In actual fact he isnt. Lose him now before emotional abuse turns to physical abuse.  <br>  <br>  Emotional abuse can include: <br>  <br>  name-calling<br>  ridicule<br>  degradation<br>  exacerbating a fear<br>  destroying personal possessions<br>  torture or destruction of a pet<br>  holding possessions or pets as "hostages"<br>  excessive criticism<br>  inappropriate, excessive demands<br>  ignoring your needs and wants<br>  controlling, dominating <br>  withholding of communications<br>  threatening, ie: <br>  if you dont do what I tell you to you are out of here<br>  threatening to leave if you dont "obey" him<br>  mocking your religious beliefs<br>  routine labeling or humiliation<br>  controlling finances, making you completely dependent on him|`|ozwLZwXeaa	This boy is so selfish now, even before you are married. Never marry this guy it would be a disaster for you. You are so young and already have a good head on your shoulders by knowing you must get the education before the family. I don't know you but I am proud of you.<br>  Trying to get young people to think with their head and not their raging  hormones doesn't seem to work. You my dear girl are the excepting to that rule. Your parents should be bursting with pride with you as a daughter. Have you talked with them regarding this pushy, moody, and selfish boy? Listen to your parents always. They want what is best for you and especially if they are helping pay for college, they have a right to know what you are worried about. Show the love for Mom and Dad. Do the right thing and go to college and just stay friends with the silly boy. You are a young woman and he needs to grow up and smarten up.|`|4SF4KGu4aa	Sounds like a control guy. Once he gets you married , then kids, you are totally dependent on him. I bet he wont want you to work. Doesn't sound like your over-invested in this yet so it's not too late. Get the schooling. I have a niece that did and by golly, she got a divorce when she found out he was a control freak and jerk. At least she had the teaching degree to take care of her and the kids since the loser never pays support.<br>  <br>  However, your avatar makes it look like you are coming into this situation a little later than most. When anyone starts to sell you on" buying right now, since this deal wont last", you are getting ripped off. Same with politics. One of the reasons we are in this situation now because" we have to do this right now to fix the economy. We are in a Crisis. Let's do this NOW" .<br>  <br>  I'd go the way you need to go and get the school. Make your life to be independent but if it works into marriage and kids, that's great. At least you will be able to support them if you husband dies or divorces.<br>  <br>  Good Luck.|`|LQ52bOFFaa	By all means get your education.  You don't say weather or not he's already educated or in college.  Who's being selfish here?  Him for wanting you to be a housewife/mother or you for wanting an education?  You sound like a high school senior with brains.  Don't waste them.  It's nearly impossible to do what you want with a husband and two or three babies.

No one can ever take education away from you. If this man really loves you, he will want you to do what makes you happy. It sounds to me that he might be concerned that if you get your PHD, you might out grow the relationship you have with him. Chances are he is right. Your way to young to be thinking about marriage and children. Get your education. Like I said, if he loves you, he will stand by you. Your not being selfish. He is being selfish.

TyRfv0eoaa	Hebrew, koine Greek, Roman and Greek history, ancient Jewish history.<br>  <br>  In all of these, secular sources are best, because they are less likely to have an agenda. A secular language teacher simply wants to teach you the language. Likewise with history teachers.<br>  <br>  Most of the Christian language sources I have come across are seriously in error. Many can't even pronounce the names of the letters of the alphabets properly, let alone know their sound values. (Ex. Strong's Concordance). How can they then be trusted to know the meanings?<br>  <br>  I learned Hebrew very inexpensively from an Israeli teacher. Hebrew was her native language.

There was the Canon of the Pharisees, the Sadducees, the Ethiopian Jews and the Diaspora/Essene Jews. Jesus and the disciples used the Septuagint which was the Canon of the Diaspora/Essenes. We know this because it is quoted in the New Testament. This Canon continued to be the Canon of Christians until after the Reformation and, in fact until about 200 years ago when the Protestants adopted a condensed version of the Canon eliminating the Deuterocanonicals from their Bibles. Even the AKJ originally contained the complete Christian Canon. It has been said by critics of Christ’s Church that the Deuterocanonicals were never believed to be inspired and just the opposite is true. The decision by Christians as to which books are inspired and useful for teaching was decided at the African Synods in the late fourth and early fifth century. There was never a question about their inspiration. <br>  <br>  The OT Canon chosen by the Protestants is actually a Jewish Canon not chosen by the Jews until after the establishment of Christianity as a result of the spread of Christianity to slow the growth of the new group in Jerusalem after the fall of the Temple in 70AD. Until then as I said previously there were many Canons in use. The adoption of the Canon missing the Deuterocanonicals united the Jews against the Christians was decided in the Jewish Council of Jamnia because the Deuterocanonicals referred too strongly to the Messiah fulfilled in Christ. <br>  <br>  Some Protestants will claim that only the Jews have the authority to choose Canon but the Church deferred that decision to Christ and the disciples and it is clear through biblical research, that the Septuagint is the Bible used by the first century Church and quoted in the NT Scriptures. The fact that Protestants choose to adopt the Canon that was approved by the same Jews that accused our Lord that resulted in His crucifixion suggests the source of this confusion as from the father of lies who led the Pharisees to accuse Christ and petition for His punishment. It is another way that Satan divides the body of Christ and separates the faithful denying Christ’s prayer that we all be one in Christ through His Church. The Christian Church has always used the Septuagint as Canon and never the truncated version of modernist Protestants.<br>  <br>  Some Protestants erroneously believe that Catholics added to the Bible with the Deuterocanonicals but this shows an ignorance of their own history and the history of Christianity as witnessed by Christ’s Church. The facts are that the Protestants removed the Deuterocanonicals and even considered strongly to remove some of the NT books currently in use by Protestants and Catholics. Fr. Martin Luther was in favor of removing the book of James because it conflicted with His heretical man made doctrines of the “Solas”, Sola Scriptura and Sola Fide. The heretic Ulrich Zwingli wanted to remove the Gospel of John because of its teaching of the commandment to Eat Christ’s Body and drink His Blood which contradicted his view of a real absence of Christ instead of a real presence in the Eucharist. Even Fr. Martin Luther could not endorse such a departure from Scriptures and deny that Christ is truly and really present in the Eucharist in Body, Blood, Soul and Divinity. <br>  <br>  In Christ<br>  Fr.

God Bless you .|`|2Us94NUEaa	I personally feel that you can make this more simple:<br>  <br>  1st, You need to talk with God earnestly.  Without him you won't be able to understand any of it.  He will send you knowledge to understand. <br>  <br>  2nd, you need to purchase the Old Testament and New Testament in the English and translated forms so you can compare words. I've found this to be the greatest reason why people believe there are contradictions in the Bible. <br>  <br>  3rd. Get a concordance, Hebrew lexicon, Greek lexicon, etc. and check into all passages that pertain to a subject before you make a conclusion.  People taking one liners out of the Bible and calling them truth is the problem. You must do a thorough research or you will miss something.<br>  <br>  4th, You can purchase the Nag Hammadi Library book. It has the lost writings that weren't put into the Bible, but you're not going to see some real difference from what's in the Bible, but you can maybe see why they did not include these writings.    <br>  <br>  This will give a good start.|`|bb06GQ5Paa	I took this bible class at Univ of Houston.  It was taught by a rabbi.  OMG, I learned so much from that man!!  So, I would recommend a class like that with somebody who has spent his whole life learning about the bible.<br>  <br>  <br>  And remember that anybody can have an agenda.  Always take these classes with a certain level of discernment no matter who's teaching them.<br>  <br>  And it would probably benefit you to read everything you come across, even if you think it's nonsense or a lie or whatever.  At least you get some background, you know?

Look up Leviticus  18:22;  Leviticus  20:13; and 1 Corinthians 6:9 but I wouldn't put much weight into those readings for the simple reason that:  (i.) men wrote the Bible, not God; and (ii.) if God crated the World 40% of the Animal Kingdom is bisexual.

They are the only ones who matter.<br>  <br>  It may be that you are unsure of yourself, and perhaps lack confidence.  If you sit in on a bench a busy shopping centre or high street, just watch people going by. Almost every person is "average" looking, nothing spectacular, yet nothing unattractive.  And there is nothing wrong with being "average".  All those people going past will be going about their lives, without a thought for anyone else.  They won't all be looking at you or judging you, and many of thosee people will feel exactly the way you do.|`|VkVyuq5baa	Hi, I get that all of the time. Girls treat me differently. They have a glance at me then they look away, whereas they will eye a guy up and down if he's good looking (even if he is made up of half the substance I am). Also, when I have walked down the street drunks, or simply rude people, have called me ugly. And I assume it happens all the time, because generally peoples' opinions are quite similar. Maybe you asked this question for reasurance, but I am afraid I cannot say "you aren't ugly" or "it's all in your mind" because what authority do I have to say that? I have never met you. Instead, I will provide you genuine reasurance. I promise you, with all my heart, that it is possible to find someone you are attracted to just the way you are.

When women look at you, smile and say in a very friendly voice, "How ya doing?"  <br>  <br>  That shows confidence, and confidence will get you further than looks any day of the week. <br>  <br>  You let some strange girl intimidate you and make you feel bad.  Why?  She didn't say anything bad to you.  You just assumed that she was judging you.

Sometimes the answer is 'No', sometimes the answer is 'Be patient' and sometimes the answer does not become apparent until later, when we look back and see how God was guiding and directing us through a difficult period.<br>  <br>  Here is an example to illustrate how God can answer prayers in an unusual way: When I first realised my sinful nature and prayed for forgiveness. the Holy Spirit directed me to a Baptist church in a small commuter town north of London. After I was baptised there, I remembered an event from 25 years ago - I was waiting on the windswept, cold platform of the railway station in this small town and I said to my colleague, 'What a God-forsaken, miserable dump this place is. I'm glad I don't live here.' Guess what? This was the supposedly God-forsaken, miserable dump that the Lord brought me to to live with my husband and son and where I finally became a Christian. Nice one, God - I repented and ate my words!|`|1ce0748c0ab23dcbbd0d889d57183122aa	God doesn't answer prayers. Mine atleast. Or anyone elses that I know.|`|MeFeazFiaa	God does not exist so nothing fails like prayer.|`|AA11008046	The answer has to be sufficient so you give God praise and thanks for the answer; not just suspect it is an every day event.<br>  You must also be careful you are not expecting the answer in any certain format.  You may get something you misconstrue to be from God when it actually isn't.|`|yPy4gFZ9aa	well, since he doesnt actually answer at all u have to wait for something u can interpret as an answer. and if nothing comes, u make sthng up. and thats weird, or unusual if u will|`|g4AAZRuxaa	Because God alone is all wise, and knows what is best for us.|`|ttTDiJWfaa	Prove how before you go asserting why.|`|2059629ba703ea51b813a449b0cb4431aa	You're assuming in your question that there is a "god" and that this god "answers prayers". Neither of those two things has been established. You're projecting your hopes and needs on a probably non-existent being and attempting to find evidence that these "prayers" are being answered, and so you invent supernatural explanations for natural events.|`|fjidmhxsaa	For he is God. His ways are not our ways; neither are His thoughts are thoughts. Isaiah 55<br>  <br>  55:8 For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways, saith the LORD.<br>  <br>  55:9 For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways, and my thoughts than your thoughts. <br>  <br>  This analogy, comparing the infinite thoughts of God to the very finite thoughts of man, would suggest that the heavens are infinitely higher than the earth. There is no end to space.|`|Ii0Kd6hdaa	Because God works in mysterious, inefficient, and breathtakingly cruel ways.|`|AA10398522	Because you're looking for anything that you can conceive as being an answer from god.|`|fHpPgMlZaa	The answers come from your own mind. There are no gods hence no answers to prayers.|`|d78420f6881261db90170d41d16536a0aa	Because people interpret anything that happens as an "answer."|`|dqZrq7Zeaa	because people invent the answers|`|YzArBxQFaa	This is a mystery that has been going on since man was on earth and started to worship something other than himself.  Many people are not aware that once man worshipped animals because they were stronger than he was and that he depended on them for survival.  This thought evolved into the theistic patterns we see today.<br>  <br>  There is spirituality in the universe- when you listen and speak to it, you are praying and meditating.  When we pay attention to this, our prayers are being answered.|`|cjneKyrZaa	this is another reason why i think the religious people have a lot  of their ideas all wrong.  They claim God answers prayers and the claim he knows every hair on your head.  Well wie do have lots of bad things happening everywhere but we have these people Winning games and getting a front row parking space at Wal-mart claiming God answered their prayer.  If God answered a Prayer why doesn't  he/she answer the ones that are important with respects to the living conditions and the hungry and the lost. why don't he protect the Innocent babies and the ones being shot or blowned up with bombs.  Seem like a way to brainwash and keep the rituals of money making scams going after 1000's of years of fake hope and grace.|`|zoAqdu1Jaa	I have to second this question. I know God doesn't punish us, but sometimes I feel like I am being punished. I can't go into detail about anything, but God answered my prayers with a pregnancy and I find this the most bizarre thing ever. It is not something I wanted, but it would prevent me from doing something stupid in my life.......weird. I know some will probably give me a thumbs down, but I know this was intentional.|`|pD3qti9Xaa	So that you will know that only He could have answered it the way He did.It appears that He answers in an ironic way so it will bring a smile.As I look back in my life of 64 years I see where He has answered all my request & i've broken all of promises to Him----this makes me feel very low.I could have done better.|`|HqG4MDxGaa	Because if he answered prayers the way we "expected" him to answer, that would take all the fun out of it for him! Believe it or not, he IS a God of humor from time to time! :)|`|YIElevidaa	Because in order for you to believe he's answering them you must look at the r"results" in the most unusual ways.<br>  <br>  God is a Fairy Tale<br>  <br>  -Church of Atheism <br>  206 Vine St.<br>  Eau Claire wI 54703|`|qiNr0AqJaa	Just to keep you guessing<br>  if it is HIS answer, or just<br>  good luck or bad luck.|`|6y3Xd4P7aa	maybe its funner for him...more amusement. but it is the unusual ways the catch our attention|`|lU285qgSaa	Because of Free Will.... If we weren't so hard headed he could get things done direct!
nBvKAftwaa	start with a place and friends or volunteers <br>  try your local high school thats where i planed mine<br>  then you need people to help run it and depending on where you live try to get an estimate on how many people will come so if 200 you need 10+ people to help out <br>  then you need stuff for people to do i.e. a few live bands and booths for kids almost like a carnival <br>  try to get donations and that can pay for any costs and extras like one of those giant slide deals <br>  there is alot to think about so i would sugest getting a few of your friends togather and brain storm on what you need to do

K2QwEM4raa	The Indians passed the peace pipe around as a form of friendship.. I think that is what it is all about. Pot was not illegal at one time and alcohol was. Give me a pot smoker over a drunk any day of the week. At least it grows naturally and is not mixed up into a drug that is far more harmful to the body and to other people. I know lots of people that smoke it and have for many years yet they work and take care of their family  Sure I know a few who abuse it but they would abuse anything they could get their hands on. Pot could and is useful for many things and the battle against it will never work. People in ALL walks of life smoke it's just most people are not stupid enough to advertise it. Now I guess you people that don't like my answer and don't know what you are talking about can thumb me down. And if it was legal no it would not be as much fun to the abusers but to the ones that don't put it first in their life nothing would change. Why do we seem to have so many more problems in the US than in places where it is legal?|`|P544Sbmqaa	Well the difference is that one joint is enough for several people at one time.  One can of beer or one cig sometimes isnt even enough for only one person.<br>  <br>  And yes, i will still smoke pot when its legal.|`|VAHxoStlaa	yes|`|FgPZ8Sl8aa	One alcoholic drink isn't enough to get multiple people drunk and one cigarette isn't enough to satisfy more than one person.<br>  <br>  One packed bowl is usually enough to get more than one person high.<br>  <br>  But certainly, it has a bit to do with the subculture behaviors of us marijuana smokers. The legality plays no role in how enjoyable it is for most of us. If that were true there wouldn't be so many of us fighting for legalization. You think we like to be cooped up, smoking in secret? Definitely not. There's nothing I would like more than to be able to sit outside and enjoy smoking a little weed without concern of the law. Or a nice stroll on a comfortable spring day with a joint.|`|ZaSiPFvtaa	The passing-in-a-circle thing probably would not change.  It's just how things are done in that subculture, and a change in the law would not change that.<br>  <br>  Your central point, though, seems to be that part of the "fun" with this activity is doing something that the government tells us we're not supposed to do.  Based on my own observations, as well as conversations with numerous pot smokers, I think you are dead-on correct.|`|O2RNsEOraa	It's only fun if the government doesn't want you to do it.<br>  But if they make it legal, it's going to be like "Oh big deal, he's smoking marijuana". See, no fun.|`|GeyNHYtfaa	we are a community...more of an ARMY if you will...and of course if you like passing...(i do inless im running low)<br>  <br>  we as a Weed Nation are determin to legalize it so be prepared...|`|A7O8MeETaa	HELL NO!

I'm guessing it's one of the books where Jesus does NOT intentionally break the law and refuses to leave before the Romans arrest him and sentence him to death.|`|vvQWHVWOaa	There is nothing in the scriptures which speak to suicide.  The bible is silent on this issue.  But it would be reasonable to assume that God frowns upon the practice considering he created and shaped us to begin with.  It's hard to imagine that God would be happy with it.  <br>  To the issue of heaven and hell regarding suicide, we simply don't know.  It depends on whether or not they are right with God, and anything could happen in the last moments of breath or thought.  People often reconsider atheism or apatheism when it's time to die.  Someone commiting suicide could possibly plead for salvation before they expire.  As long as that's possible, no declarations of who is in hell are plausible.|`|fhOlbSWaaa	=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=<br>  Dear friend,<br>  Please read my ANSWER CAREFULLY and follow the links, books & Videos, all free of charge, which provided below …<br>  =*=*=*=*=*=*=*=<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  THE TRUTH OF THE LIFE OF THIS WORLD (Video)<br>  <a href="http://api.fmanager.net/api_v1/productDetail.php?dev-t=EDCRFV&objectId=1276" rel="nofollow">http://api.fmanager.net/api_v1/productDe...</a><br>  <br>  Wickedness, injustice,grief, pessimism,trouble, loneliness, fear, stress, frustration, distrust, unscrupulousness,anxiety, rage, jealousy, resentment, drug addiction,immorality, gambling, prostitution, hunger, poverty, social corruption, theft, war, struggle, violence, oppression, fear of death…News about these issues appear in the newspapers and on TV every day.The popular press devotes entire pages to these subjects, while others serialise articles about their psychological and social aspects. However,our acquaintance with these feelings is not limited solely to the press; in daily life,we,too,frequently come across such problems and, more importantly, personally experience them. <br>  People and societies endeavour to liberate themselves from the distressing experiences,disorder and repressive social structures that have prevailed over the world for long periods. <br>  We only need to glance at ancient Greece; the Great Roman Empire; Tsarist Russia, or the so-called Age of Enlightenment, and even the 20th century-a century of misery which saw two world wars and world-wide social disasters. No matter upon which century or location you concentrate your research, the picture will not be appreciably different. <br>  If this is the case, why haven't people succeeded in solving these problems, or at least some efforts been made to remove such social diseases from society?<br>  People have encountered these problems in all ages, yet each time they have failed to find any solutions because the methods they employed were inappropriate. They sought various solutions, tried different political systems, laid down impracticable and totalitarian rules, stirred up revolutions or subscribed to perverted ideologies, while many others preferred to adopt an indifferent attitude and merely accepted the status quo. <br>  In our day, people are almost numbed by this way of living. They readily believe these problems to be "facts of life." They picture a society immune to these problems as being nothing short of impossible-a dream utopia. They persistently and openly express their distaste for such a way of living, yet easily embrace it, since they think they have no other alternative. <br>  The resolution of all these problematic issues is possible only by living by the principles of the "true religion." Only when the values of true religion prevail can a pleasant and tranquil scene replace this gloomy and unfavourable picture, which is doomed to continue so long as God's limits are ignored. To put it another way, people are enslaved by these complications as long as they avoid the values of the Qur'an. Put simply, this is the "nightmare of disbelief" and the link below for this wonderful book:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://fs.harunyahya.net/popup/Download.php?WorkNumber=256&Format=pdf" rel="nofollow">http://fs.harunyahya.net/popup/Download....</a><br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  you will find how the regulation of life by the "norms of morality" introduced by the Qur'an revealed to mankind by God will banish the "nightmare of disbelief," how pessimism, corruption and social restlessness can be eliminated from society, how the individual can surround himself with an ideal environment, what spiritual and material benefits he is likely to attain by adherence to these norms of morality are gone into in detail, and finally, that the unique alternative to all these problems is the morality of the Qur'an. <br>  So far, many books have attempted to deal with the social and psychological problems societies face. Yet, what distinguishes this book from others is its stress on the most realistic solution. It also sincerely warns people against the troublesome future they are likely to face if they fail to resort to this solution. <br>  We expect that every reader of conscience will grasp that peace, mutual trust and an ideal social life is attainable only by embracing the values of the Qur'an and will turn to the true religion, which is Islam. <br>  They will then happily join the ranks of those who never suffer, mentally or physically, from any of the above-mentioned complications. Around them, there will always be an abundance of favours, comfort, love, respect, peace and confidence, and moral virtues will prevail. They will know how to earn God's approval, by observing His limits and the commandments of the Qur'an. They will thus, by having faith in God, attain His mercy and at last enter Paradise. <br>  <br>  Useful link:<br>  (A BRIEF ILLUSTRATED GUIDE TO UNDERSTANDING ISLAM)<br>  <a href="http://www.islam-guide.com/islam-guide.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.islam-guide.com/islam-guide.p...</a><br>  <br>  DEEP THINKING (VIDEO):<br>  <a href="http://api.fmanager.net/api_v1/productDetail.php?dev-t=EDCRFV&objectId=1124" rel="nofollow">http://api.fmanager.net/api_v1/productDe...</a><br>   <br>  <br>  =* FOR ANY HELP FEEL FREE TO E-MAIL ME ON *=<br>  smiling4ever222@hotmail.com

It is a tradition of men handed down through the generations.  It comes to us from ancient paganism.

Why is it that the churches have made no difference in the lives of people?  Why is it their messages are empty and meaningless?<br>  <br>  The reason is this: What constitutes modern "Christianity" today is about 90% ancient pagan practices, which God hates.<br>  <br>  The Church in Acts never observed Christmas, Easter, Lent, Valentines Day, St. Patrick's Day, or Halloween.   Have you ever wondered why you can never find a reference to Christmas or Easter in the Bible (Acts 12:4 is a deliberate mistranslation from the Greek Pascha for Passover).<br>  <br>  The Early Church in Acts kept the Sabbath (seventh day), Passover, Unleavened Bread, Pentecost (Acts 2) and the other Holy Days of God.<br>  <br>  A challenge:  Read Acts, all of it.

bRLCxmP6aa	The meaning and use of the term Asian depends on the society - in Britain, if you say that someone is Asian, people will assume that the person is South Asian, rather than East Asian. This is probably due to the fact that the UK had, traditionally, an earlier and higher rate of immigration from South Asia than from East Asia. In the US, the situation is reversed - the US had a traditionally higher rate of immigration from East Asia than from South Asia. Therefore, in the US, people associate the term Asian with people whose ancestors came from China, Japan, Korea, etc.|`|4Vmlf902aa	Because East Asians are STILL ASIAN, and live on the Asian continent. So they will be called Asian just like everyone else.|`|u8slDDkLaa	because they want to make it short instead of long and the common asian is south eastern it is just how they say programmed to like why do they call native americans indians there from asia but not from india <br>  or they say black people instead of african americans most of the time i mena tere skin is not black but brown people or white people intead of european american or caucasan see what i mean <br>  or hispanic instead of natve american they just are mixed with spanish and speak it but ancestors are native americans|`|S6MqrWdjaa	i say asian <br>  <br>  for the other asians i say by region<br>  ex<br>  middle east<br>  south asian or indian<br>  eurasia etc.|`|1c3d738dd4eb9120591e3bba318ed300aa	plus alot east asians like the japanese and korean don't want to be put with the same category as the chinese|`|jJxUCkkFaa	far east is another term for East asian|`|vURKBxvWaa	yea, im filipino and sometimes it pisses me off when people refer to filipinos as filipinos, but not asians. it like hey man, im asian too!<br>  i guess its the same with saying "americans" to refer to US citizens, when everyone in north and south america are actually americans.<br>  i think its just an obnoxious american habit we have lol.<br>  but hey, i do it too lol.|`|6sJhoXAAaa	I'm ashamed to admit this, but I do call everyone who comes from any country within Asia "Asians."

That has been proven false.|`|NLRkD63eaa	You can't categorize a group of people because of geography. Geographical locations do contribute to the influence of cultures, but for a continent like Asia, it is made of many smaller countries. "East Asian" geographically do not include Vietnam or Thailand, but these countries also share similarities with your "East Asian" countries.<br>  <br>  Are people aware that the proper reference to whites are Euro-Americans? But most do not refer to themselves as a descendant of Europeans, instead they are Americans. Asia is a continent like North America, but Americans do not associate themselves with Canadians nor Mexicans nor do Canadians and Mexicans refer to themselves Americans (technically they are on the North AMERICA continent, right?). They, as a country, have their own individual culture.<br>  <br>  The Asian culture from combined countries dominate the other countries that are located in Asia as well. Countries like China, Taiwan, Thailand, Japan, Vietnam, Korea, Philippines, and Mongolia all share the same cultural and language family (meaning similarities from the result of descendants).<br>  <br>  If someone's from countries like "Cyprus & Israel, to India, Pakistan, or even northern Russia" they would refer to themselves as their country because referring to themselves as people from the continent Asia they would be saying that their country's culture is part of the culture that dominates Asia. If someone's from countries like China, Taiwan, Thailand, Japan, Vietnam, Korea, Philippines, and Mongolia they would refer to themselves as Asian because their culture and language are from the same family that dominates the Asia continent.
ljzb6fZBaa	As some of our brethren has pointed out, Isaiah 61 points to our Lord Jesus Christ. Sis Grey Tower has a great answer too.<br>  <br>  The word "ashes" reminds me of the ashes of the red heifer mentioned in Hebrews 9:13-14 "...ashes of a heifer, sprinkling the unclean, sanctifies for the purifying of the flesh, how much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered Himself without spot to God, cleanse your conscience from dead works to serve the living God?" This shows that ashes symbolise that our conscience is cleansed completely by the blood of Jesus. <br>  <br>  "To Him who loved us and washed us from our sins in His own blood, and has made us kings and priests to His God and Father, to Him be glory and dominion forever and ever. Amen." (Revelations 1:5-6)<br>  <br>  Back to Isaiah 61, Jesus was anointed by the Holy Spirit to proclaim liberty to the captives and the acceptable year of the Lord. Because of His perfect sacrifice, we have forgiveness of all our sins - past, present and future. God is no longer counting the sins of humankind during the age of grace. He has given us the ministry of reconciliation. (2 Corinthians 5)<br>  <br>  Now that we are new creations in Christ, old things have passed away. God wants us to behold that all things have become new! (2 Corinthians 5:17) God doesn't want us to look back at the past with regrets anymore. Jesus has turned our ashes - our past failures, broken dreams, etc - into beauty through His finished work at the cross. He has turned our mourning into joy and dancing, just as there is music and dancing in the Father's house when He welcomed the prodigal son home. :) And He has clothed us with His robe of righteousness and garment of praise, so that we no longer sing the sad heavy songs of the world, but we shall continue to sing songs of praise and worship to the One who died on the cross for our sins and gave us eternal abundant life. :)<br>  <br>  Thanks for the revelatory question - it is a wonderful Bible study for us to see Jesus' grace and glory in Isaiah 61. God bless you, sister Grace. :)|`|5OucqEzFaa	Isaiah 61 is famously known because Jesus applied it to himself when he read from the scroll of Isaiah in his local Synagogue and said this scripture was fulfilled in him.<br>  <br>  The crown of beauty is a turban or head-dress.<br>  <br>  Contrast this with Job 2:7-8: "So Satan went out from the presence of the Lord and afflicted Job with painful sores from the soles of his feet to the top of his head. Then Job took a piece of broken pottery and scraped himself with it as he sat among the ashes."<br>  <br>  Unless you have had first-hand experience of physical affliction, especially skin disease such as psoriasis, you can have no idea of the pain and the suffering of Job.<br>  <br>  To go from glory to suffering is what happened to our Lord and Saviour.  Hands that flung stars into space, to cruel nails surrendered. Out of the ashes of sin rose the beauty of God's eternal plan of salvation, to redeem sinful humanity. Praise God and praise Jesus and praise the Holy Spirit.|`|5JqCObDSaa	The first thing that came to mind was "To give them life for death". <br>  Like the tree planted by the rivers of water, when the heat comes, her leaf shall remain green and when the drought comes it shall not cease from giving fruit.<br>  So, not matter what we go through, even when we go through the fire and the storm, as long as we have Jesus - we have beauty and will come out like pure gold - ever so carefully refined by the Master.<br>  Thanks be to God : )|`|TMb076n6aa	It means the seasons we go through in life as a Christian.<br>  <br>  Phropheticaly it speaks of Jesus|`|DEzHhQeFaa	In the olden times a mourner or someone (lamenting about a matter) would smear ashes on himself head to toe.<br>  <br>  To give them beauty for ashes is one way of saying to bring their mourning to an end or to clean up the ashes and restore their beauty.<br>  <br>  <br>  Job 42:6<br>  Jeremiah 6:26<br>  Ezekeiel 27:30<br>  Jonah 3:6|`|XpZumlkwaa	To beautify Israel again, from the ashes, (the destruction) it has become.<br>  Notice this is prophesy that has already happened but the latter is yet to come.<br>  <br>  The New Jerusalem:<br>  Coming soon!|`|kX0T1urdaa	It is for people who have made a mess of their lives.

Servants of God love what is good. But they must also learn to hate what is bad. (Psalm 97:10) That means avoiding certain practices that God hates. What are some of those practices?<br>  2. Fornication: Sex before marriage, adultery, bestiality, incest, and homosexuality are all serious sins against God. (Leviticus 18:6; Romans 1:26,?27; 1?Corinthians 6:9,?10) If a couple are not married but are living together, they should separate or else get legally married.—Hebrews 13:4.<br>  3. Lying, Gambling, Stealing: Jehovah God cannot lie. (Titus 1:2) Persons who want his approval must avoid lying. (Proverbs 6:16-19; Colossians 3:9,?10) Every form of gambling is tainted by greed. So Christians do not take part in any kind of gambling, such as lotteries, horse racing, and bingo. (Ephesians 5:3-5) And Christians do not steal. They do not knowingly buy stolen property or take things without permission.—Exodus 20:15; Ephesians 4:28.<br>  4. Fits of Anger, Violence: Uncontrolled anger can lead to acts of violence. (Genesis 4:5-8) A violent person cannot be God’s friend. (Psalm 11:5; Proverbs 22:24,?25) It is wrong to take revenge or to return evil for the bad things that others might do to us.—Proverbs 24:29; Romans 12:17-21.<br>  5. Magical Spells and Spiritism: Some people call on the power of the spirits to try to heal sicknesses. Others cast spells on their enemies to make them sick or even to kill them. The power behind all these practices is Satan. So Christians must not take part in any of them. (Deuteronomy 18:9-13) Staying close to Jehovah is the best protection from spells that may be cast on us by others.—Proverbs 18:10.<br>  6. Drunkenness: It is not wrong to drink a little wine, beer, or other alcoholic beverage. (Psalm 104:15; 1?Timothy 5:23) But heavy drinking and drunkenness are wrong in God’s eyes. (1?Corinthians 5:11-13; 1?Timothy 3:8) Drinking too much can ruin your health and disrupt your family. It can also cause you to give in very quickly to other temptations.—Proverbs 23:20, 21, 29-35.<br>  7. Persons who practice things that God says are bad will “not inherit God’s kingdom.” (Galatians 5:19-21) If you really love God and want to please him, you can break free from these practices. (1 John 5:3) Learn to hate what God says is bad. (Romans 12:9) Associate with people who have godly habits. (Proverbs 13:20) Mature Christian companions may prove to be?a source of help. (James 5:14) Above all, rely on God’s help through prayer.—Philippians 4:6, 7,?13.|`|HbnhpnL8aa	God does not hate anyone.

NlQhkgFCaa	Yes, only Allah is the ultimate judge but the Qadianis fall out of the primary criteria for being Muslim as they claim that scary looking chap Mirza Ghulam Ahmed <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirza_Ghulam_Ahmad" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirza_Ghula...</a> (shivers) was the last Prophet (Astaghfirullah)|`|c1Mq2ejmaa	reem is a shia?<br>  <br>  that traitor!!!!!!|`|EEmosbL3aa	<<<Salaam Nas2a.

What right does anyone have to place themselves between another person and God? Who gave them a right, let alone the power, to create barriers between anyone and our creator?<br>  <br>  What if it turns out this is an experience that leads them onto the right path? Are people somehow afraid that those they disagree with might end up guided, when they feel the right is theirs alone? Do they really believe that their power to prevent people from performing hajj is greater than God's power to guide them?<br>  <br>  It does not matter, whether or not you allow or disallow anyone to perform hajj. It does not matter what you believe, even though we are entitled to our beliefs. A person cannot give the final judgement as to what is someone elses heart. I don't care what the differing beliefs are, and the reasons for the disagreement. When someone says they know what is in anothers heart and they know their true intentions, when they say they know others have been misguided and have no guidance from God, they are fools who presume to have powers they do not have. <br>  <br>  And if someone says to you they believe in God and God alone, that they worship no other beside him... you call them an idolater at your own risk, and while your opinion cannot brand them what you believe them to be, you just may find out later how wrong you were to judge them.<br>  <br>  I maintain that whatever it is I am called by others, be they wrong or right in their judgement, they have no power over me in regards to my path towards God. And everyone in this forum who goes around presuming they know others intentions and others relationship to God, and choose to condemn them for their beliefs rather than agree to believe as a group in God alone, should be ashamed of themselves.<br>  <br>  I have no problem maintaining a high level of respect for many, be they sunni, shia, qadianis, or anything else that is out here.

Your e-mails are foolish and written in an incongruous way that even a five year old cannot understand. You have a major quandary with me, and I am not surprised, since people like you take the internet seriously.<br>  <br>  Sister Zaru is correct. I do not label myself for various reasons.

I am very open-minded on my beliefs, and I am still educating myself on both Sunni/Shia beliefs. To those who proudly label themselves, a big round of applause to you.

Fitnaa’, fitnaa’ and more fitnaa’.<br>  <br>  Why does it concern you so deeply about what I do or say? I keep asking this question to you every day! In what way do my actions influence you? Are you my father? No, you are not. So stop acting like one. Leave it to Allah to judge me. Yes I do believe that only Allah can judge me, who are you people anyways? Cowards.

jSPj3S6faa	Here's the best answer that I ever encountered while I was severely delusional; now I have graduated and enjoy the freedom of not being tied to this myth of the Invisible Man in the Sky.<br>  <br>  I was a Mormon and they seem to have things pretty well figured out, doctrine-wise.  Succinctly, commission of sin requires a punishment.  No human can withstand the infinitude of the punishment within a given time period.  However, Jesus was able to endure said punishment because He was half-God.  Being half-mortal, He was subject to the rules of sin & punishment.  By his taking on the punishment on Himself, He set Justice back into place (He balanced out the Universal Karma; borrowing from another belief system.).  And it is a gift from Him to allow us sin-prone humans into the presence of God after this life.<br>  <br>  As far as being prone to sinning, this is related to the most important doctrinal keystone: free agency; that is, humans are free to do whatever they want to do... but are not free to choose the consequences of such actions.  Thus it is our free will and choice to do what is right or to properly repent and thus by perfect logical justice enter into God's Kingdom after this life.<br>  <br>  Well, this is all just swell... until one applies perfect just logic to everything within this system of beliefs.  For it states in Mormon scripture that God in his creation of His children gave to them their free agency.  Now there's trouble.  This states that there was a point wherein humans did not have free agency.  Thus, they were not free to choose to receive free agency.  Then it was thrust upon them.<br>  <br>  And thrust upon them were the consequences of exercising any facet of their free agency, be it good or bad.  Thus in effect the act of "bestowing" free agency upon humans was a violation of their intrinsic right to choose for themselves.<br>  <br>  And lastly yet most importantly, all this talk of free agency is a moot point as it has proven by science that humans do not have free will as commonly defined.  Actions performed by humans are iniatiated by impulses which exist before the human is aware of it.  That which we treasure as consciousness is barely more than a powerless observer.<br>  <br>  So, in the end, obtaining logic arguments in support of a delusional belief system is counter-productive; for the simplest logic will conquer any delusional belief system if only applied in the most elementary fashion.|`|ttTDiJWfaa	It's not rational and they will tell you so themselves.<br>  <br>  "It's all outside of humna understanding" they claim.<br>  <br>  Translation: They just want you to shut up and put $$$ in the collection plate.<br>  <br>  If there WAS a God he could just kill Satan and be done away with sin,right?|`|AA10398522	Every time I see a serious question or ask one, Christians can't answer it.  Why does sin require death as a punishment? That's to much punishment for most sins.

Tell you what, I'd like to buy those birds from you. Name your price." <br>  The boy named his price, and the man payed it.<br>  When the man received the birds he opened the cage and set them free.  <br>  <br>  Before, I went into this long explanation of the basics of Christianity, but then I realized it's in God's word. <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=%20John%208:24;&version=65;" rel="nofollow">http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?sea...</a>  Please read it.<br>  Don't get "foamy in the mouth"(angry) now. :><br>  <br>  edit: ask yourself: "Am I going to take the time to read all these answers?"

Couldn't God just forgive us and forget it?<br>  Have you ever wondered why Jesus came to earth as a man to die for our sins? That is the question we are looking at this week.<br>  <br>  God makes it very clear in the Bible that sin requires death as the punishment: (Ezekiel 18:4 NIV) For every living soul belongs to me,the father as well as the son--both alike belong to me. The soul who sins is the one who will die.<br>  <br>  He also makes it very clear that you will have to die for your own sins, not for anyone else's, nor will anyone else have to die because of your sins: (Jeremiah 31:30 NIV) Instead, everyone will die for his own sin; whoever eats sour grapes--his own teeth will be set on edge. The Jews use to say that the father eats sour grapes and the son's teeth are set on edge. What they meant was that the child was affected by what the father did. God is saying that is wrong, only the person who sins will die for that sin. That does not mean, however, that we are free from the results of the sins that our parents commit. If your parents dabbled in witchcraft, or used drugs or abused you, you will have some things in your life which you might have to deal with, but you will never have to answer to God for what they did. <br>  <br>  So we know that God demands death for anyone who sins, but why? We have to look at God's nature to answer that question. God is holy. Look at what He says about Himself: (Leviticus 11:44 NIV) I am the LORD your God; consecrate yourselves and be holy, because I am holy. Also: (Leviticus 19:2 NIV) "Speak to the entire assembly of Israel and say to them: 'Be holy because I, the LORD your God, am holy.<br>  <br>  That presents a problem. We were all born sinful, with a sinful nature. We cannot change our nature by ourselves. God is holy and He cannot change either. Since God is holy, He cannot sin, nor can He stand to be around sin or anyone who sins. That is us folks! God cannot stand to be around us. That means that we will forever have to be separated from Him. That is spiritual death. <br>  <br>  But God loved us and did not want us to have to die spiritually. He could not just forget our sins, because we are still sinful and like I said He cannot stand that. Our sins had to be paid for and in the process taken away, but the only way we could pay for our own sins would be to spend eternity separated from God. There was no way out of this, we could do nothing to change it. <br>  <br>  That would have been the end of the story if God Himself had not decided to pay for our sins for us. He sent His only Son; Jesus to earth as a human being to die for our sins. He could die once and in the process pay for all our sins, because He was holy and without sin. It was not just the physical death that was the payment. We could and will die physically, but that will not pay for sin, it has to be a spiritual death, a total separation from God. Jesus did that for us too. When He died on the cross, He took our sins and God the Father turned His back on Jesus because He being holy could not look at our sins. We will never know what pain Jesus went through when God the Father turned His back on Him. That is we as Christians will never know, but if you die and are not a Christian you will experience that same pain of separation as God turns His back on you for ever!<br>  <br>  We should praise Jesus' Name everyday because He paid that price for us: (Romans 6:23 NIV) For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.<br>  <br>  God, because of His holy nature could not just forget and we could not pay that debt and still be with Him, so He paid for our sins Himself. That is true love.|`|wuPTBIIuaa	Again!!!!!<br>  <br>  jesus did not die "FOR" our sins! <br>  <br>  i protest. <br>  <br>  he died because he made political enemies of the high priests who conspired to have him killed for blasphemy. <br>  <br>  for preaching repentance and faith and teaching that mankind can reject false teachings and learn to live life more abundantly if htey would would forsake all their sins and become saints. <br>  <br>  but then again, it is written Jesus had to become the "sacrificial" lamb of God according to the merits of his own faith he had to "submit" to the will of God the Father in order to obtain the fulness of the godhead and all authority.

This did not do away with the consequences of our sin, so God sent his son, Jesus to:<br>   - Show us the nature of the Father<br>   - Proclaim the love of God and the "good news" that we could be reconciled<br>   - To demonstrate a perfect life (by depending on God to live it)<br>   - To be the atonement for our sin<br>   - To demonstrate that this was so by being the only one to rise from the dead<br>  <br>  Actually, it kind of hangs together for me.|`|V8TFzhYZaa	Roman crucifixion was considered an horrible way to die because it took days - sometimes even weeks - for the victim to die.<br>  <br>  Poor old Jesus spent about two and a half hours on the cross before he was cut down.*<br>  <br>  It was all for show - i.e. a "cruci-fiction" - so that he could a.) fulfill messianic prophecy, and b.) emulate the death and resurrection(s) of Dionysis and Osiris - only two of a veritable plethora of pre-Jesus resurrection cults.<br>  <br>  A few daze later, His mom, wife and sister-in-law went to "change his bandages," and He wasn't home - or so the story goes.<br>  <br>  Here's a HINT: dead folk don't need to have their bandages changed.<br>  <br>  Sure a guy that (maybe) lived a couple of thousand years ago has most certainly died by now - but not on the cross and not for anyone's sins but His own.<br>  <br>  Addendum:<br>  <br>  I'm reminded of an olde cartoon in which a devout christ-worshiper proclaims his belief to the almighty, who responds by saying, "That's absurd!

So man is born with sin nature that we all inherit. We sin & die. But Jesus came born of a virgin of Israel, conceived of the Holy Spirit. (Genesis3:15, Jesus is the promised Savior, the Seed of the Woman who defeats the seed of the serpent & the curse of sin & death.) So Jesus wasn't born with sin nature, nor did He sin when tempted of the serpent. He was the Lamb of God without blemish (without sin). Since the wages of sin is death & Jesus did not have personal sin, the curse of sin & death couldn't keep Jesus in the grave. He raised from the dead & overcame the curse of sin & death for us.<br>  <br>  Because of the first Adam, all man has sinned & died.

Jesus is worshiped (Matt. 2:2-11; Matt.14:33; Matt.28:9; John 9:35-38;<br>  Heb. 1:6) Only God can be worshipped (Matt. 4:10) (same Greek word for worship<br>  is used in each place.)<br>  21. In the OT God was seen (Exodus 6:2-3;Exodus 24:9-11; Num. 12:6-9; Acts7:2), yet no man can see God (Exodus 33:20; John 1:18). It was not the Father that was seen in the OT (John 6:46). Who, then were they seeing? See John 8:58.<br>  22. Jesus claimed the divine name, "I AM", for Himself in John 8:58 see<br>  Exodus 3:14.<br>  23. Jesus says you must honor him even as you honor the Father (John 5:23).<br>  24. Jesus gives life (John 5:21).<br>  25. Jesus bears witness of Himself (John 8:18;John 14:6).<br>  26. Jesus is the One who will judge you on judgement day (John 5:22-23). Only God can be the judge.<br>  27.

The only major difference is the concpet of Jesus and God which with all due respect, is very important to both religions.<br>  <br>  I have studied both the bible and the Quran - and there is nothing you can say to me which i would not know.<br>  <br>  There are passages in the bible whereby Jesus himself predicts the coming of another warner<br>  <br>  John Chapter 14, Verse 15-16: <br>  'If you love me you will keep my commandments and i will ask the Father and he will give you another Paraclete (Helper) to be with you'. <br>  <br>  John 14, Verse 26: <br>  But the Paraclete whom the Father will send in my name will teach you all things and bring to your remembrance all that i have said to you.<br>  Nevertheless, i tell you the truth; it is to your advantage that i go away for if i dont go away, the Helper will not come to you. But if i go, i will send him to you' (notice the word IMMEDIATELY or QUICKLY isnt mentioned).<br>  <br>  John Chapter 14, verse 30: <br>  I will not now speak many things with you. For the prince of this world cometh, and in me he hath not any thing. <br>  <br>  If he doesnt go away, then the Helper (Paraclete) will not come. <br>  Who is this in reference to? The Holy Ghost was with Him so it couldnt have meant the Ghost? God was with him so he couldnt have meant God neither.<br>  <br>  So again was Jesus saying that someone else was to come after Him?<br>  <br>  the above can be supported with<br>  'it is to your advantage that i go away for if i dont go away, the Helper will not come to you.'<br>  <br>  It is CLEAR that Jesus is talking about someone else as the spirit was with him, and God was with him.<br>  And even in the bible ITSELF - it mentions the name Mohammed|`|3vmDRCTCaa	I think someone tried to copy the patriarchs from Judaism/Christianity and invented an imitation religion a solid 600 years after Christianity was already out.

rADpGLeJaa	I do not think or hope that economic condion will be bad as it was in the 1920's due to the following reasons:<br>  1.In these years since 1920 to present time a lot of progress in living hood has done due to the progrees of science & technology in every field and it is a fundamental fact. It is also true that the economy has down throughout the world due to misutilisation of IT industries. On the otherhand, the IT industries also provide down fall of mankind thinnking & thoughts. The world is very big and its solution of problems can be foundout to search out new invention which would overpower the lack of errors of IT industries. This can also provide a new direction of other industries(see,www.opmisra.com) and can also be findout a solution of mentally handicap. In this way,wait for good future and good economy prospects in different directions.

Thanks.|`|Wn1rtE97aa	It depends upon what brought one to agnosticism.<br>  <br>  If one is agnostic as a form of equivocation, intellectually hedging the question as to whether God exists or not, one might be moved either way.<br>  <br>  It is possible to arrive at agnosticism by applying an intellectual standard of verifiability.  I've yet to see any claim either way which doesn't ultimately rest on some presupposition on the matter one way or the other (the atheist baseline presupposes no gods and requires empirical evidence, the theist perspective almost always presupposes a particular God's existence).<br>  <br>  I consider myself agnostic, in particular a theological noncognitivist.  When one asks what we are talking about when we are talking about God, I put all the claims together and see a mess of vague comparisons and generalities might be attributable to anything or nothing at all if one could tease anything coherent out of it.  From what I see in common conversation, it seems that people use the word "God" as some sort of dumping ground for the collective Id.<br>  <br>  I suppose I tend to roll with the atheists oftentimes out of a deep suspicion of religious institutions, they tend to be more favorable towards empiricism, and they tend to be less tolerant of their idiots than theists seem to be of theirs, but then again there are a lot more theists, so there going to be many more idiots.|`|dqvZmj22aa	It didn't happen here, but I used to be an agnostic.  A good friend of mine became a totally judgmental, Fundamentalist, "everyone is going to Hell but me" @ssh0le, and I started studying Christianity in an attempt to argue him out of being a jerk about his beliefs.  <br>  <br>  (He divorced his wife because she wasn't "pure" enough, for example.)<br>  <br>  I never got him sorted out, but I DID find that there was a lot to offer in faith.  I don't try to convert people though, that's a bit rude.  I just guide those who ask, instead.<br>  <br>  But the "true Believers" here are just as obnoxious as the atheists, I find.  For example I've been told I "must" be homophobic because I'm Christian by atheists , and I'm told I have to BE homophobic to be Christian by Fundamentalists.|`|AJr98ZReaa	not quite. I'm still agnostic, but I lean toward atheism. I remember that there is no proof for or against the concept of God, but plentiful proof against god as depicted by any organized religion, ever.<br>   <br>  Still, I have more in common with atheists, and I answer questions directed at them.|`|9LLDkYPeaa	I was always an atheist. Coming to yahoo this atheism in me was strengthened reading all the crappy answers of religious people. However, I was unaware of agnostic beliefs, I only think in extreme terms, being agnostic is like placing each foot on different boats.|`|CrpEAhh3aa	Here's the thing, you wouldn't really change from an agnostic to either an atheist or a theist.  Agnosticism isn't an "in between" phase to those two philosophies, it's a separate distinction.  It's possible to be both agnostic and theistic, or to be both agnostic and an atheist.|`|PAA4uWPuaa	The questions and answers from atheists here helped me realize that I had been atheist all along. <br>  <br>  At first I claimed to be agnostic but the things I read here made me realize that agnostic gave no reference to what I believed and that I had always believed there are not any gods hence I was an atheist.|`|ridu0Rtwaa	Just try reading a small sample of Christian postings on here!!!<br>  <br>  Intolerant, egotistical, hate filled and bigoted!!

lJUyhMceaa	The 144,000 you mention are "male", "virgin", "Jews".  They are the remenant of Israel that will be saved during the Great Tribulation period.  Read the Bible !!!!!!<br>  <br>  This does not include the Church of God, nor does it include those saved during the Old Testament.<br>  <br>  God's plan of salvation is perfect.  We have all sinned, and thus we are all guilty of breaking God's law.<br>  <br>  Look at it this way.  If you took one rock, representing one sin, and you though it at a glass window, what would happen?  It would shatter, and you would have to replace it with a new window.<br>  <br>  Now, take 1000 rocks representing 1000 sins and throw them at a glass window, what will happen?  It will shatter, and you will have to replace it with a new window.<br>  <br>  It is the same thing in the spiritual sense.  When you sin, one time or one thousand times, you are a sinner.  The only way to fix your sin, is to give you a new life.  The only way you can get a new life is if you die first.  And since we can not die, and give ourselves new life, God had to do it for us.<br>  <br>  This is why He came and died.....So that we would not have to die for our own sins.  He paid the price for your sins and mine, regardless of how many.<br>  <br>  When we believe God and trust His Word....Believing in Jesus Christ and giving oursleves to Him, we spiritually die to oursleves and are "born again" (John chapter three).<br>  <br>  When we do that, all our sins are washed away, and the Bible says "all things become new".  We are a new person in God's eyes, and it should be evident in mans eyes as well.<br>  <br>  This is why, you can be saved, and why I can be saved, and why anyone regardless of what they have done, can be saved.  If you have the spirit of God in you, you will be happy that God's salvation is for anyone who will repent and accept it.<br>  <br>  God's way is perfect.|`|bb06GQ5Paa	If God forgives Gacey, it's because he was truly, with every ounce of his being, sorry for what he did.

Read it again.  The number of the saved is a few verses later, it is a number of people so huge, that no man can number it.<br>  <br>  Being forgiven and getting into heaven is easy, because Jesus did everything on the cross.  We must only simply believe  :)  <br>  <br>  Salvation is a FREE GIFT that happens in a split second when you believe in Jesus! It is impossible to lose or "leave" salvation (John 6:39-40, 1 John 5:13). <br>  <br>  The truth about Jesus is that the only way to be saved and to get into heaven and avoid being sent to eternal hell, is by believing in faith alone that Jesus, who is God, died for our sins on the cross as FULL PAYMENT for all our sins, and then Jesus rose from the dead (1 Corinthians 15:1-4). Believe this and you will be in heaven, no matter what! <br>  <br>  Please pray now: "Jesus, please forgive me of my sins. I believe that You died on the cross for my sins and You rose from the dead. Thank You for eternal life!" You will be in heaven with Him forever when you die. :)|`|bWmOaK33aa	You're way wrong, those 144 000 are a group of Jews who (according to the book of revelation they) "are virgins" they will have a certain mission on heaven but those 99% left on earth will enjoy and earthly paradise.|`|sVDW5mVUaa	don't click here<br>  <a href="http://ca.answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AlyqZkUjjFaxjHm_e2wyeiHAFQx.;_ylv=3?qid=20090307100604AAzA84W">http://ca.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...</a>|`|rIvp1BToaa	that  number  is  of Israelite's there are  billions and billions  more  but God  will forgive  all who Truly repent and it is  not for us to judge them.|`|zoAqdu1Jaa	See, God knows our hearts.

They are those who have come from (martyred in?) the great tribulation. (Revelation 8). So even if they were the only saints in heaven (which I don't believe), isn't that enough proof that it's not going to be only the 144,000?<br>  <br>  The Bible says that those written in the lamb's book of life will go to heaven.<br>    <br>  "Nothing impure will ever enter it (the new Jerusalem), nor will anyone who does what is shameful or deceitful, but only those whose names are written in the Lamb's book of life."<br>  Revelation 21:26-27  <br>  <br>  So...who gets their name in the lamb's book of life, and how do you do it?

vYAgIMLdaa	no|`|QP8LdPLeaa	would you be comfortable swiming in someone's pee?|`|TXe7XqUlaa	It is not socially acceptable to pee in a pooI. If you do it front of other people they will be extremely offended. If you do it into a public pool, you will be kicked out if your lucky, or the cops may be called if your are not. I presume that you must be in your early teens or older, as you have started menstruating. The chlorine can kill bacteria that may be found in urine, but in any case it is still not needed. If pee and blood are acceptable, why stop there? If you friend pooped in the pool, would you still swim in it? If the answer is yes, you have some serious issues. You need to sort them out, as none of this is acceptable behavior in the normal world.|`|MpNCNQU5aa	hahaha thats funny sorry it is<br>  lol<br>  watch this vidio <br>  its fred goes swimming<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEqwKNNQBwc" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEqwKNNQB...</a>|`|d42c34ff42d7b1a4c999f30da1751f64aa	Smells like Troll...<br>  <br>  To answer your question, troll - that's what toilets are for. I dont want to swim in someones piss. ...But I'm sure you knew that.

iKmkRaqBaa	Indian girls goes to school to study. They are In Style everywhere other than in school.<br>  Style is another word for magnet. They didn't want to spoil the boys at school by being magnetic.|`|QP8LdPLeaa	you ever heard of a thing called culture dude? who are you to judge and say what is stylish and what is not. sounds like your attitude needs styling|`|34K0QIzTaa	thats kinda racist u meanie !! :) but its kinda true ! and it doesn't matter to them how they look .... so just forget about it :)|`|WpaQKpckaa	The group of Indians that you have seen doesn't go for all Indian teens. Why are you judging them? You're a racist and retarded.|`|bFWhuJbuaa	thats racist.<br>  <br>  every race has its "nerds" and "stylistas" there isnt one all stylish pretty race|`|Awo7g1K4aa	I couldn't care less as long as they wear clothes.|`|WQcxODKLaa	every culture has different beliefs, yes looks do count, but you just have to accept the fact that their parents want them focusing on school and not how they look .<br>  <br>  <br>  (your shallow and very superficial .)|`|NCvvwPEdaa	Indian girls are unique in their own way. They dress up with their own style. Here in india there is something called as culture and indian girls maintain it, it is called simplicity. I like indian girls dressing style more than that of western.|`|plY21D3Yaa	u r an american? stick to ur ideas. the indians give away their culture tryin to ape the west. girls come to school to study. not to be drooled over. so if you want to see the girls stylish...... c them after school........ and looks dont matter much if u have a heart of gold........ think twice b4 u sterreotype us indian girls.|`|nYEkkNn2aa	it's just the way they dress. it's their religion. what they believe in. how they were raised. no they are not retarded. style isn't every thing and doesn't really have to do with confident. clothes aren't just for looks in this world.|`|80fWQyDnaa	They r studying with hard earned money ! You studied with donations ! So they have no chance to be styled ! They studied with pen and paper. And u studied with a gun in ur pocket ! No gun ! No drugs ! And no style !b|`|99NNTv6vaa	This question and you are the stupidest things on the face of the Earth as of right now.|`|drzN1kkuaa	I agree with the first answer, different places/cultures have different styles.|`|knvXQDvzaa	wow, you're a jerk|`|A7O8MeETaa	In answer to your question, Indian girls tend not to be as free to socialize, date and go to parties and the like. There are few occasions where they have to dress up, and also few occasions to see other stylish girls.<br>  <br>  On another point, no, studying is not enough, but its one of the most important things you will do as a youth. If these girls forgo spending time which could be spent studying dressing to impress people like you, I see it as a positive thing. They can learn later in life how to dress. They can't repeat their education in the same way.|`|BCyWKUtKaa	idk I'm Indian. I think my parents just want to save money bcuz tehy buy me cute clothes when they r on sale. I don't shop at like American Eagle or aberacromie and stuff but I like the way I look. I don't really care if all the other American girls have retarded straight hair and super expensive clothes. They just wanna fit in with everyone else and be "cool". ( which fyi...they look like sluts trying to do so) They r the most annoying people bcuz they think they are so cool and better than ever1 else. My parents don't want me to be like that. That's why they don't spoil me.|`|lvDam67Saa	umm... i disagree many ppl you have been studyin happen to be like that but a bunch of my frenzz who are indian are very stylish. Many of them look hawt to and also I shop with them and I am not american but  I look gud to... THat IS SUCH AN INSULT.<br>  B/c they d  have style you just studied the wrong chicks|`|844Gkwnfaa	it is a cultural thing ...indian parents do that because to them they are protecting there kids ... maybe there thinking is that if my girl looks attractive boys might fall for her and the girl might get hurt or get in some other kind of trouble...|`|QiBBgOA5aa	because many of them are too busy worrying about where their next meal is coming from... <br>  stupid question<br>  <br>  unlike american teenagers, they might have more difficult problems to worry about.<br>  <br>  Why are you so stupid?|`|C7Ujon3Xaa	'Who’s The Hottest Girl In The World, My Desi Girl, My Desi Girl'|`|gHmqYsVwaa	Because in India there is a different sense of style.|`|ef4b0b9eb5f80f99b4a112e5e254c3d2aa	differant cultures differant styles it is simple and live with that|`|jL0Y27g2aa	oh my god you are so descriminatory,  well i do think you are retarted.|`|PhkWt9vEaa	RUDE!
