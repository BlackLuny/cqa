20080620204555AA3arR7	Home & Garden;Do It Yourself (DIY)	Compost pile in a trash can has maggots in it - help!?	I started a compost pile with dead leaves and grass clippings in a plastic garbage can. I punched holes in the top and along the sides. It was doing OK but the kids overwatered it. I moved it so it would be away from the hose. Now it has maggots in it. They're big; I think they're deerflies. Should I just dump it somewhere and spread it out, or will it get resolved if it dries out in the can? Thanks!

20081003082519AAyRMFG	Home & Garden;Garden & Landscape	What Kind of Tree is this ?	My neighbor has a very large tree in his yard - its about the size of a 100-year old maple - it drops these green, lime-sized (and colored) stone fruits at this time of year, that seem to smell vaguely citrusy.    Any idea what they might be ?      (Notes - I'm in new england, and I'm not even sure that the part of the tree that drops the fruits wasn't grafted on at some point in the past 100 years  . . .)

20081007165107AAOAYTe	Home & Garden;Maintenance & Repairs	What's wrong with my dishwasher?	In my apartment I have an outdated dishwasher. It has been working fine for about 2 months. But today after running it the dishes had spots and a thick film on the inside. I ran it again, and the conditions only worsened. On the third run I noticed it sounded different and had a clicking noise all throughout the drying cycle. Is my dishwasher broken, or could it be from the water? Is there a better dishwasher detergent I should buy? Thanks.

20081009120353AARIVSM	Home & Garden;Maintenance & Repairs	When are you satisfied that the wax toilet ring doesn't leak?	I just replaced the wax ring on my toilet and everything seems fine - but I just want to double check with someone who's done this a few times.  The floor is level with the flange so I used a more standard #3 no seep ring.  I placed the toilet down and flushed about 25 times then tigtened down - do you think I should be good?  I hope so - I'm caulked in and it's drying.  Also - I've heard recommendations to replace the supply line but used the old one again - it was in good shape and is solid metal (good gaskets) rather than burst hose.      Thanks.

Soon after, the yard developed a few dead/bare patches and thinned out quite a bit.  I've fertilized and watered, but I can't seem to get the grass back to the lushness and fullness it had before.        I know there are several varieties of St. Augustine, but I don't know which kind I have.      Any ideas?
