20060629125535AAVyPTM	Computers & Internet;Internet	DSL vs. Dial-Up Comparison?	I already know all about DSL and the speed, but i would like to know how fast is fast.    Lets say i have a 56.6kb dial-up connection, of which i only get to use 49.2 of the connection. I have a 5 to 6 times accelerator.    I might be getting a 1.5M connection.     Now lets say i download files that normally take 10 to 30 minutes to download on the Dial-Up connection i have. How long would it take to download them on a 1.5M connection.    By the way, dial-up has to lower picture quality(images) in order to increase internet quality(speed). I was wondering, does DSL have to do that in order to get high speed. Does DSL allow best internet quality without lowering picture quality.

20070520103532AA2RPFN	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Laptops & Notebooks	My lap top suddenly will not accept my password how do i get in?	I live in France and I am American. My sister bought me a HP lap top at Best Buy over a year ago, and brought to me in Paris on one of her visits, as I need a qwerty keyboard with American applications. The warranty is expired. I called Best Buy and a technician told me to press F5 and blah blah blah, reset password,  but it didn't work. My daugther was playing checkers on it last, and when I went to login, it would not accept my password. It is now collecting dust. My husband took off the keyboard as he thought maybe the letters were registering wrong or sticking, but nothing changed. I have a another lap top now (ordered qwerty version on Dell) but it seems a waste to throw out the HP. Any advice?      Thanks so much, Wendy

20070710191550AACFcF0	Computers & Internet;Security	How do you fully uninstall WinAntispyware 2007 when my computer is having problems doing it?	I dont know who installed it when i got off last night, but I know it isnt good. I started to get warnings about "malicious software and virus" pop ups and "install drivecleaner" ads. Now pop ups come out of nowhere with pop up blocker on. My internet closes and then "send error report" message pops up. Even if the web browser sits open, it'll all of a sudden close or pops-up come up.   I tried to uninstall it with add/remove but it said it was unable to uninstall because it doesnt exist but the shortcut and file is still on my computer. Should I try WinSpyware's uninstall? i wanted to stay away from it since it is the problem.   Oh, this computer doesn't have actual spyware/virus protection but some kind of trial i think.      Also what's "A runtime error has occured. Do u wish to debug?"    It's popped up ever since i got this computer(used). It says that when loading a webpage. It wont finish loading until i click no. I clicked yes once, but didnt know what to do after that?

The desktop is running XP.  The laptop is running Vista.      Here is the kicker.  My desktop is connected to a non-wireless router because of it having a connection for a phone jack for Vonage.  That router is lan-lined to my wireless router, which broadcasts to my laptop.      So does anyone know how I can get it to work?

Well I have a programming assignment I have to complete for class but I am very confused.      I have to read in the contents of a binary file into an array.  I don't understand how to do this.      ifstream ifile("popdata.bin", ios::binary);       Emp rec;              for(int i=0; i < 29; i++)       {           ifile.read(reinterpret_cast (&rec), sizeof(rec));       }         Where Emp is a class that I made to do something I don't even understand.  But once it reads all that stuff in in the for loop, it's supposed to be "in memory" now right?  So how do I access that stuff in memory and put it into the array?      Any help and guidance would be very appreciated.  Thanks!
20090131110839AAbUVqI	Computers & Internet;Programming & Design	What method of Artificial Intelligence should I use with C++?	Hi, I just downloaded Microsoft Visual Studio Visual C++ Express Edition, along with the Dark GDK add-on to help me make a game, since that is my intention.      My game is based off of a real-life card game, you can have a customized deck of anywhere from 40-60 cards. I want the game to be able to respond in a correct way, so it needs to know every possible move that I might make, and every possible option it might have.   There are currently 3068 cards in the game, and as more come out in real life, I want to add them to the game. Each card has it's own effect as to what it does, so I want the computer to know what it should do so it can do it.   So what form of AI should I use and how would I code it to where I can fit more of the cards in as more are released?      Thanks.

20090131121532AA4z0a6	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Desktops	Computer heating up and freezing.?	i had a computer built for me five or six years ago (top of the line, back then, tons of upgrades). used mostly for games, movies and ripping music. i can only imagine i ripped myself a virus or something malicious, even tho i run anti virus soft-wear and my internet company provides me with another blocker.  actually, ive downloaded tons of  'possible'  intrusions by way of all the music and whatnot that i have. ive gone and scaned both my drives and all the info on them and cleaned it all up (i think). now it seems im missing patches to my  OS like 'c:|...'system32'  and a few others that appear when i start my computer. it runs fine for hours till i run a game or play a video. even running itunes for more then 15 mins is starting to freeze it up. when i restart my computer after a freeze up it chirps and says 'overheat error press f1 to continue'.i do and windows starts. other times ive hit the del button at computer start-up to go into the OS screen to 'look around' and the only thing ive noticed is that the temp on the computer get red hot (as in the letters on the screen go red past a certain temp... 65 or so i think, all the way up to 90 till i shut the comp. off). i have two internal fans and three external fans with lots of air flow...ive also sprayed 'air in a can' to clean out any dust that might be in it. any ideas? where to gt back the missing patches for windows xp? do i need a new vid card? could there still be virus' on my computer hiding in files ive downloaded? thank you.

20090131122229AA0sZK1	Computers & Internet;Programming & Design	Make an iFrame anchor jump parent page?	I've been toying with the idea of creating a site of mine with an iFrame for my navigation links so that I only have to change it in one place (the same concept as using external CSS).    I've run into one most important, most critical, most crucial, most exasperating problem: I can't figure out how to make the link in the inline frame to force the parent directory to change.    I don't want anything complicated, if possible. My main concern is browser compatibility. If JavaScript is necessary, please keep it minimal.    Also, it needs to be capable of validation for XHTML, so if the id field works over the name field, please use that.    Thanks!

It had onboard video, so I bought an eVGA 9500GT.  After inserting the card, the system wouldn't boot and the BIOS beeps indicated either bad video ram or an improperly seated card, the latter I'm sure isn't the case.  eVGA replaced the card, but I still run into the same problem.  Do I need a new motherboard?  If I do, what would be a good one under $100?    Here's my specs:  Windows XP SP3  Antec EarthWatts 380 watt PSU  AMD Athlon 64 X2 5600  4 GB RAM (I know only 3 are recognized)  Asus M2N-PV motherboard    Thanks

20090131132154AAFDu3j	Computers & Internet;Internet;YouTube	Can a Vlog Really Ruin Your Life or Job?	There's a common belief that having a vlog (or anything on the internet) will ruin someone's life.  I love vlogging and I want to design video games some day.  My vlogs are very general (for example, I said I was trying to get a job at a cafe and not "I am currently trying to get a job at Starbucks") and focus on my creativity (drawings, stories I'm writing, or stories I have come up with).  I know of people who say that vlogs can ruin people's lives by getting them fired or in trouble (getting stalkers for example). There are a lot of creative people in the  video game industry so I see no harm in my future manager finding my stuff. I would really hate to put my vlogs on private since the people who comment are so much help to me.  So what do you people think?

Okay, here's the deal:      I have a Macbook and I am using VMWare Fusion to run Windows XP on it. I have a few roms for Nintendo 64 games on Windows but anytime that I try to run them on any emulator, I get the following message:      "No hardware-accelerated Direct3D devices were found."      Does anybody know if there is something I can download or do to make these games run? I know that Direct 3D is something to do with the graphics card which (from what I heard) should be fine on a Macbook.      If anyone has any advice or knows what to do, I would greatly appreciate your help. Thank you in advance for your help!

I'm trying to install windows xp, the DVD drive recognizes the CD and Files that are on it fine.   It is a copy of my original XP disc, because my former disc was scratched.

I've tried two CD/DVD drives so far, both of them do this.   I am using Vista, trying to put XP on another partition.   Yes, the CD/DVD drive is first on the boot list.

I have an iPhone, and yesterday, I was able to access the iTunes store from it just fine and I could purchase songs and apps, but this morning, I could not get it to load. So I logged on to iTunes on my computer, thinking I could just sync it after I bought my stuff.      Up in the top right of the iTunes window, after you sign in, it's supposed to show your email address and also the amount left on your account (I do not use my credit card on my iTunes account). Mine only shows my email. When I went to purchase something, it told me that my payment information was invalid, but I know that I have money on my account because it still says I do when I log in on my phone, and because I had money on it yesterday.      Confusing, right?      Long story short, I can log in on my iPhone and my computer, but I cannot purchase anything.      And, in addition to that, my internet will only open certain pages, like DeviantArt. Yahoo! and most everything else will not work.      Basically, my whole phone is all jacked up, as well as the iTunes account on my computer.      If there is anything that I may have shut off in my internet settings, or if I need to contact a service provider, please let me know. Sorry for making this question so long and confusing, but that's how this is :/      Please help, and thank you in advance!
