20090205165127AA3CdOF	Cars & Transportation;Maintenance & Repairs	If my engine overheats does the oil degrade enough to cause loss of oil pressure?	My water pump recently went out, the engine got pretty hot (not hot enough to blow head gaskets or anything) but when the engine got hot the oil pressure dropped to the red when ever I gave it gas. Now the water pump has been replaced, I have very good oil pressure (even with high RPMs) as long as the engine is cool. When the engine warms up enough and the RPMs raise the oil pressure plummits. I know that heat will thin the oil, what I'm wondering is when the engine got so hot could it have permanently thinned the oil? Should I change the oil? Or am I looking at replacing the oil pump? I really don't want to replace the oil pump if I don't have to, it's in the oil pan and I have to raise the engine to remove the oil pan.      '93 Ford F150   5.0L (302) V8
20090205165150AA09f2n	Cars & Transportation;Car Makes;Chevrolet	92 cavalier hard cold starting?	Hello there i have a 92 cavalier that has developed a problem in which it will be very hard to get it going when it's cold, what i mean by this is that it will catch a bit while turning over, i usually have to play with the throttle to get it going. it never did this last winter. I've changed the ignition module, both coils, spark plugs, wires, and the crankshaft position sensor, I've also checked the grounds. once started the car runs perfect and the spark plugs come out clean, this also happens on a hot start but instead it will start with a slight miss while turning over. if anyone can point me in the right direction that would be great.

20060828125503AA1KQFX	Cars & Transportation;Maintenance & Repairs	Tansmission, mechanics ony?	Can anyone tell me what a reasonable price is to have a transmission replaced in a 2001 VW Cabrio.  I am looking for the transmission only as the clutch was replaced 30,000 miles ago.  I have no doubt in my mind that this car is a lemon.  It has just about 65,000 miles on it, and I had to replace a clutch at 35,000, tie rods at 60,000, and now at like 65,000 a transmission.  This is not normal at all.  I know how to drive a stick.  I never had to replace any of these things on my other car, and I drove it to 140,000.  Please let me know.  The quote I got was $2,100.00 for a used transmission and $2,400.00 for a rebuilt one.  Is there any place to get a brand new one, or is this the only way to go.  Please give me the best answer you can.  Thank you.
