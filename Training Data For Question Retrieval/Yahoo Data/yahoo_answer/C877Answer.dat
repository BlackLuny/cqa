However, you may be able to qualify for a low-down payment mortgage through the FHA guarantee program.  Call around to local banks and see if they participate in the FHA program.  If so, you could expect to place a down payment of about 3 - 3.5%.<br>  <br>  However, if you can find a foreclosure that is priced significantly below appraised value, you may be able to use the equity as your down payment.  For example, if a house appraises at $100,000 and the bank is selling for $80,000, the bank may look at the $20,000 as your down payment.  <br>  <br>  And if you buy, as a first time home buyer, don't forget you get the $8,000 tax credit.

They are generally conducted by a relatively neutral party, such as a human resources staff member, so that the employee will be more inclined to be candid, as opposed to worrying about burning bridges. For this reason, some companies opt to employ a third party to conduct the interviews and provide feedback.[1] The purpose of an exit interview is usually to gather data for improving working conditions and retaining employees. [2] Common questions asked in exit interviews are, "What are your primary reasons for leaving", "What did you find most satisfying about your job", "What did you find most frustrating about your job", "Were there any company policies or procedures that made your work more difficult", etc.[3] Many career advisers recommend treating an exit interview like a hiring interview, in that criticism of the past employer should be limited to statements about the company as a whole, rather than specific individuals.[4]<br>  <br>  Schools may also conduct exit interviews with students before graduation, or even as a requirement of it. This is sometimes called a graduation interview.<br>  <br>  During elections, pollsters may conduct random exit polls, though these are not required.

Bw1h5xAcaa	It really depends on where you live. In many areas of the country there is a substantial nursing shortage. In other places, such as where I live in the midwest, we are experiencing a lot of layoffs due to the economy. New grads are still able to get jobs, but it might not be the job you want to have. . . if you want to get into hospital nursing you might not be able to, and you might have to start off in a nursing home or doing home health.<br>  <br>  How hard the work will be depends on your job setting, and how much you enjoy your job and how well you deal with stress. Not all nursing jobs are stressful. Some are intermittently stressful. Some are almost constant high-energy, more stressful. In nursing school, a lot of what you learn is not about nursing - it's about self-awareness, and finding your preferences, your coping mechanisms, your weaknesses or limitations, and figuring out an idea of what kind of nurse you want to be. Nursing is great because of the fact that there is such a spectrum of job settings, specialty areas, room to advance your education and professional standing, etc. <br>  <br>  I work in a hospital in high risk obstetrics, including labor & delivery. It's a "feast or famine" kind of area, where things can be calm and downright boring, then suddenly crisis emerges and you have to be on your toes, ready to act, dealing with emotionally traumatized women and their families, etc. If those things have no effect on a person, then you aren't human. It's ok to get stressed, it's ok to grieve, it's ok to be angry, but it's how you channel those feelings in order to get it out, get it over with, and move on. Each nurse has to find their own way of dealing with those stresses. <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|oZ3gU7htaa	There is a shortage of RN's in almost every state.  You should be able to get a job.

Ch9TedMcaa	basic supply and demand<br>  <br>  more buyers- higher price<br>  <br>  more sellers- lower price|`|3tuwWidiaa	This is basic economics.  If there are many that want to buy, demand is up.  That raises prices.  If there are many that want to sell, that means demand is down.<br>  <br>  It works, although to a lesser extent (see below), with most things.  For example, consider grapes.  If, all of sudden, it's announced that grapes cure cancer, without a change in the supply, prices will go up.  If grapes are discovered to cause cancer, prices will go down as there are fewer buyers.<br>  <br>  Stocks fluctuate more than most goods because the demand for stocks is based on rumors, guesses, and supposition.  Even small things can cause big changes in stock demand.  Plus, the may the stock market is setup, prices can change on a second-by-second basis.  With grapes, for example, it can take days for the effect to actually be seen.|`|DLjhWN58aa	actually, when you think about it, stock prices works like an auction. imagine you are at an auction for a painting. the reserve price is 1K. but other bidders feels like that the price is cheap they start bidding. as more and more people bids, the painting gets more more expensive for other bidders to buy.<br>  <br>  now imagine if the price of the painting somthing really expensive, like 100K....and the bidders think that it is too expensive. as the auctioneer goes on, there are no bidders....but the auctioneer is desperate (he MUST sells the painting on that day) so he lowers the price of the painting......he keeps on lowering it until there's somebody who's willing to meet the price.<br>  <br>  in the stock market it is something like that only in an auction, when a bidder buys the painting, the auction is over but in the stock market when a stock broker managed to buy a stock at a particular price, and there are no more stocks available to be sold, the stocks gets higher until it meets the price where someone (the seller who owns the stock) willing to sell the stock to a willing buyer. <br>  <br>  same thing goes when there's nobody wants to buy a particular stock. when there are too many stocks wanted to be sold, but there are only a limited buyer, the stock prices tumbles until it meets the price where a buyer willing buy the stock at that particular price.|`|AA10220379	Because people are Buying and Selling all the Time!!<br>  <br>  When alot of people buy Stock in a Company, the Value goes Up.<br>  When alot of people sell Stock in a company, the Value goes down.<br>  <br>  For Example:<br>  If Warren Buffet decides to buy the MAX amount of shares in a Company without buying them Out, then the Value of the Shares will go up quite abit!<br>  <br>  Now, if you look at the Volume, you will know how many People own Shares in a particulare company.

And giving you a new debt that won't be covered under the bankruptcy. (will be an extra payment to make)<br>  Personally I don't trust car dealerships, I have been ripped off every time! paying double what the car has been worth!<br>  The bankruptcy court will decide which debts get paid first & how your payments will be used.<br>  Bankruptcy laws don't protect your rights or give you a fresh start.<br>  My sister had to file & still lost her home.<br>  write down all your questions & make sure your lawyer answers them to your satisfaction. Make sure you go to all court hearings even if your lawyer tells you you don't have to be there! don't trust him to protect your rights.<br>   It's a stressful time for you so be aware of what is happening- don't let  others (the lawyer) have total control. He has other cases & other things on his mind . Don't feel like a pest calling him with dumb questions- that is what you are paying him for.

I am assuming your are talking chpt. 7 here.  If you have already started the procedure and you buy a new vehicle before the final meeting of creditors this is possible bankruptcy fraud- a federal offense.  I would advise you to talk to a bankruptcy lawyer before doing anything stupid.<br>  <br>  PS-  Same thing with a credit card- you can't go out & max it out knowing that you are filing bk- they will make you pay for it in full if it's within so much time of filing.  Again- fraud.

I wouldn't go there.  It sounds like you are just financing the actual owner's mortgage and he's holding a carrot out there to get you to rent.<br>  <br>  To buy a house, you usually need 10% down payment.  You can go to any bank/mortgage web site (or Google Amortization Schedule) to calculate what your payment would be for a mortgage.  Then, add about $175 a month in insurance, $95 a month for PMI and $275 a month for property taxes.  These all get added into your payment.<br>  <br>  When all of this is put together, if it takes up more than 1/3 of your monthly income, you cannot afford to buy a house.  Continue renting and saving up for a larger downpayment.  (If you put 20% down, you don't have to pay PMI, which saves $95 a month).<br>  <br>  Closing costs are usually about $3,000 - $5,000 on top of your downpayment when you buy the house.  I used to live in Mass, so these numbers aren't too far off.  Much of it depends on the value of the house you are buying.<br>  <br>  By all means, if you can't afford it, don't "stretch" to get into it.  You are better off renting.  Otherwise, you could destroy your credit and lose your downpayment.<br>  <br>  BTW, most banks also require you to be debt free, except for maybe a tuition payment and a car payment, before they will finance you.|`|44209bed877d82f066bd0e61b8c60fa0aa	www.masshousing.com or HUD websites.  Also, contact a mortgage broker, make an appt and they can tell you pretty much how much you can afford, what the downpayment, closing, fees, etc. will cost you.   I live in Mass also, the heat was unbelievable this past couple of months.  My feb gas bill for heat was $245.00 and my electric usually runs around 125 month.  I have a small ranch and only 2 of us living there, so it would be more for a larger family.  Also remember to include your taxes and water and homeowner insu in costs. Good luck.

Not sure what you are asking bout the cost.  There are all sorts of fees other than the house itself.  Down payment, which might be different because I live in Wisconsin.  There is a closing fee, title fee, you'll want an assessment done.<br>  <br>  Also anytime something breaks ex, water heater, stove you will have to pay to fix or replace.  Renting this is the landlords responsibility.<br>  <br>  Looking for your first home I'd suggest going to the bank filling out a credit application and get a pre-approval and go from there.  This will tell you what kind of house you can afford and the bank will finance.  You'll be able to ask them what kind of down payment you'll need.  What your looking at payment wise.<br>  <br>  Now that you will have a price range you can go from there.  Location is important.  Do you have kids? Or will you have kids?  What school district will they be in?  Do you have a yard?  Yards are important for pets as well.  What type of taxes will you be paying on this house?  <br>  <br>  This is a very exciting time for you my suggestions are be patient dont let a commissioned real estate agent talk you into something you dont love.  Look at a ton of houses first.  This will give you an idea of what you like what you dont.  Have fun!

RY1xuwzoaa	Well, an interview is a lot like getting up in front of people to talk.  It can totally rattle your nerves and it's hard to think straight.<br>  <br>  So, first off, it's important to get a clear perspective of what is happening.  You are interviewing them just as much as they are interviewing you...  So, don't be intimidated by anyone.<br>  <br>  I personally like to think of a few good questions to ask myself.  The person doing the interview is usually a lot more comfortable than you are since they are in their own environment.  And, even though they are interviewing you for a job, it's only human nature for people to want to talk about themselves.  So, when asked about yourself, give a few details about your previous jobs and experience and school and then end it with "and how about you?  How long have you been here at the company?" ...<br>  <br>  It's all in your mindset.  You have to walk in the room in a good mood and be ready to have a simple conversation with a new person.  Your personality is the #1 reason you'll get hired or not...  Remember, these people are going to have to work with you everyday - so that should be your #1 priority is to just relax, be friendly, and be yourself.<br>  <br>  And there's always going to be interviews that go terrible - don't worry about it.  If the person interviewing you made you so horribly uncomfortable- do you really want to have to deal with them every single day?  Trust me, you don't want to work there in the first place :)<br>  <br>  Anyway, there's tons of interview practice articles out there, just visit the job sites and Hotjobs and Monster and they'll have guides and such that you can read through to help build up your confidence.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|d6cbd4f49a6660cc733a0b7ea8151199aa	Here is an example, information totally made up, but you get the idea:<br>  <br>  Tell me about yourself:<br>  <br>  Certainly, my full name is Maria Smith and I am married with 2 children 5 and 8. I am originally from Springfield, MO where I graduated from High School. In high school I was vice president of the book club and played in the band. I worked at a fast food restaurant 30 hours a week while maintaining a 3.0 GPA. I spent 2 weekends a month volunteering at my church teaching the youth group. When I graduated I accepted a postion working in a small family business making hiring decisions and managing the store in the owners absense. Due to the current economy I was forced to move on and most recently I have been working for a clinic where I was responsible for auditing transactions. In my off time I enjoy reading and exercise. <br>  <br>  Notes: This question is a very open question, but be careful not to wander into the black hole to too personal. It's really a question used to gain information and settle you down. This answer won't get you the job, but if you can use it to settle down, it will make the interview go smoother. So, be open and say things that come natural without saying too much and putting the interviewer to sleep. Use Power Statements to demonstrate a pattern of success and leaderhip. Companies like good citizens: people who volunteer, leaders, go-getters. Someone who can multi-task: Work 30 hours while maintaining your grades. Obviosly if you have a college education, pull some things from there <br>  <br>  To prepare: think of some things similar to my response and put them on a 3x5 card. memorize the item, but not the answer. it will sound too rehearsed. <br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|1oEhpwGvaa	research the company before you go<br>  think about good work qualities you can offer and tell them you work well under pressure blah blah<br>  always go in with a question you can ask them<br>  because when they say: "ok do you have any questions..." you shouldnt just say no i think i got it.. sound intrigued.|`|6PO04dhyaa	what most employers want to hear when they ask that is often generic and vague, perhaps to see how well coordinated you are<br>  <br>  just say something like, "I am an honest and capable person, I take pride in what I do, and I always work to be an asset to my employer"|`|Xxz9ihH2aa	well you could tell them something good about your self anything thay is most interesting to you sorry this is what i got for you.

60cwSqE9aa	I'm assuming that you're the owner of a small business and this is your first venture into food wholesaling. In the first instance, you need to decide if you want to sell to one supermarket or several. The next thing is to decide whether you want to sell direct or go through a wholesale distributor, such as Booker Group (who sell to independent stores). Selling direct will probably get you a higher profit margin but a wholesaler might get you more customers.<br>  <br>  For a new company, getting an exclusive contract with one supermarket can be a major coup. Provided that your product sells, this may guarantee a certain income. Probably the best thing to do is to approach each supermarket's head of purchasing directly.

Finance or http://quote.fool.co.uk or http://quote.fool.com indicates they should bounce back.    The more you spend on broker commissions, the more it eats into your profit.....  e.g. on the Halifax sharebuilder account I mostly use, commissions are 1.50 on each trade.

I deducted that one of the reasons they are so rude and angry is that they have crappy jobs and that's how they get treated at work so they figure they Will treat someone else like crap.   Also they are usually buying something just to keep up with the Jones',they really don't want it but God forbid they don't keep up with their friends.   Another one is that are self centered and have never treated anyone with respect ,let alone their own family members.  More: Never have been taught Manners or Social Skills            They really have a low self esteem and have not              figured it out yet.             Everyone deep down thinks that they are better              the next person.   Maybe some day people will start treating others kindly, then they will find out How good they will feel.

You can do that with microsoft office products too.

And if someone did know, then why would they tell you, so that you could compete with them?   I don't think you THOUGHT (not "fort") about it at all.   But here is a tip. Go onto Amazon and look for a book called "Rich Dad, Poor Dad" by Robert Kiyosaki. That book will show you how to make money that will last you for the rest of your life.
A1kiUMgvaa	The answer to your question depends on the nature of how your refund was to be received.  If you were looking for a direct deposit you should see those in your bank today if the IRS released the funds to SBBT.|`|aBRDy1q4aa	The same thing happened to me on the 6th, the IRS said my refund was deposited, sbbt saiud they never recieved it, come to find out that at the last minute the IRS pulled it for a review.  It has now been 5 weeks since I efiled and I still have no money.  for the last 2 weeks the IRS has been telling me I will recieve a letter in 1 to two weeks, well two weeks are up and still no letter, best to call 1-800-829-0582 ext 462 you may have to hold for 30 minutes or so but you will get a live person
d931yVovaa	SBBT does not change until after the expected refund is not received. They normally do this on Weds. as that's when the IRS "alerts" them to a pending deposit for Friday. If your receiving it or not the SBBT website will let you know. Also this number will give you and update as well 877-908-7228 to get phone updates if your away from your computer. Hope that helps.|`|v6E4Ulmtaa	Mine says that too and then this morning went to the irs web site and it is now saying the 17th but sbbt still saying the 6th|`|jR3zihbSaa	It's good to know that I'm not the only impatient person waiting for their refund    Since the day I filed, I check the IRS "Where's My Refund" site a couple of times a day as if the direct deposit date is going to change.    You're going to have to wait just like me till this Friday.  Only 2 1/2 days, tick tick tick.
E5ZL94Braa	Hi  Doing business on ebay is good, I m doing since last two years.  The main point is what you want to sell on ebay, I mean to say some thing unique which other seller dont sell.  Doing electronic business from China is a big game because the electronic market is very vast and profit margin is less, it is a game of quantity.    1) if you have an ebay account you do not have to register company for selling multiple items for sometime. After incoming of some specific amount ebay will ask you to enter you company detail in paypal account. But if you are business register seller it will be good to gain customers faith.  2) You seller from China will send you the documents and Shipping Company will contact you and ask for documents and shipping charges plus VAT. Once you pay the amount they will delivery container at you given address.    3) Import duty and taxes include in shipping charges. They will send you all documents.      For more details and new product idea please contact me at info@casanovanauticals.co.uk|`|TpMvr1pyaa	do not bother; 99% of the sellers there earn no net profit.    to earn a profit; there is a world wide approach;    I N S T E A D--find UNMET needs and fill them.    do not just try to sell stuff "willy nilly."|`|oMjVp4zGaa	1)yes you need to renegotiate with E bay  2)you either own and drive or rent a van unless you bought a whole container then you have to get a hauler to go get it and deliver it to where you can safely unload and inventory its contents  3)by value estimation of imported goods  4)I don't know but I hear they play free bird as loud as skynyrd|`|L6aR6GJbaa	If I were you I would not try to import from China at this point for several reasons. Firstly, importing is only really viable for large orders. Anything less than say 5000 is not really viable. You also have to be VAT registered to bring things through customs.      Another reason is that you don't yet know what will sell well    It would be better to buy from a wholesaler. Buy 'the Trader' magazine.    Wholesalers will buy in vast quantities and so you can buy a few hundred of something and see what sellsmand see how it goes  then scale up later when you are established

With me, I have one credit card, paid off the car that I reaffirmed, and have student loans that I am paying on.|`|pRF5LLloaa	The bankruptcy does you FAR more damage than the other debts.  A personal bankruptcy stays on your credit record for 7 to 10 YEARS.<br>  <br>  When you "get rid of " the debts, they are "written off" as a loss to the lender. but they DO NOT get removed from your credit report, and thus they keep your score low. Those "written off" debts will remain for 3-5 years, possibly longer.<br>  <br>  It is MUCH better to make continues, regular payments, even though they are late, than to have an account show up as "Written off".<br>  <br>  You can expect to be refused credit for the next several years, and any credit that you do get will cost you much more in higher interest rates.

Le4hlm6haa	hey,  i had the same problem a few months back when i needed to raise alot of cash. the first thing i did was raided my house for old mobiles that we didn't use anymore and traded them in at various stores and websites. Then when i had all the cash from that i looked around for other things that i had lying about that i didn't use much more and put them up for online auctions on places like amabelievebeleive me you get more than you think for things that you don't think about anymore. Another thing i did was to save all my spare cash and even my coppers. that made just about enough money for me.

According to Robert's Rules of Order, a quorum count is only taken if requested at a meeting.  If no one brought it up, then a quorum isn't necessary.

y7Mwptsraa	Get yourself a new accountant. Yours doesn't know what he's talking about. Either that, or he didn't want to put in the effort to get this done for you.    You will have to get your previous tax return adjusted to include the amount of your RRSP contribution. Get a copy of form T1-ADJ from the CRA web site. You'll be adjusting line 245 of your tax return for the year you made the contribution. You can get any of the previous ten years returns adjusted under the taxpayer relief provisions of the Income Tax Act.     As long as you report the contribution, you can elect to carry forward the deduction to any future year. So, if you made the contribution in July of 2005, you report the contribution on your 2005 return, but you can carry forward the tax deduction to any future year as long as you have the limit.|`|kOcBfbRraa	NOT TRUE...................      RRSP deduction is on line 208 not 245 !!!!    anyway, if you purchased RRSP in past and have not yet deducted that contribution, you CAN adjust any of your past 4 returns. Determine which year is best, write letter to your tax office, include copy of the RRSP receipt and ask them to adjust your tax return for whichever particular year.

In your example, for the first week you'd be paid 35 hours straight time, and in the 2nd week you'd get 40 hours straight time and 5 hours OT pay.

t2pMn6Mtaa	Definition of Ethics:  "...The science of human duty; the body of rules of duty drawn from this science; a particular system of principles and rules concerning duty, whether true or false; rules of practice in respect to a single class of human actions; as, political or social ethics; medical ethics.     Business ethics can be defined as written and unwritten codes of principles and values that govern decisions and actions within a company. In the business world, the organizations culture sets standards for determining the difference between good and bad decision making and behavior..."    In the most basic terms, a definition for business ethics boils down to knowing the difference between right and wrong and choosing to do what is right. The phrase 'business ethics' can be used to describe the actions of individuals within an organization, as well as the organization as a whole.     Society ( the customers) have a poor image of business ethics within corporations and most businesses because of the performance of individuals in them. Poor customer relations is probably the major reason for this. Once upon a time business ethics assumed that ' the customer is always right'. Much too often in the present business environment when a customer has a complaint, the customer is kept waiting, fobbed off, left to take the matter up personally with the manufacturer of a faulty product, and   not given proper service.    Generally, when ever critical decisions are rquired, adopting what is an ethical approach, will make the task easier. Once one chooses the ethical solution it eliminates many other problems.     In the present world economic  crisis, many businesses need to make some drastic decisions such as cutting back on orders, retrenching workers, ceasing production all together, cancelling or renegotiating contracts, withholding dividends, downsizing and many other considerations.    Just  look at one of these critical problems - retrenching workers. Ethically a business is expected to provide work for its employees in the long term. Workers make commitments in the long term on the basis of their employment. A company employing say 100 people may need to reduce its payroll by 20%. Do they just sack the last 20 people they employed ( last in first out basis)? Ethically, when an overall view is taken there are a number of alternative solutions:  1. ask for volunteers to accept redundancy;  2. reduce the working hours per day by 20% ( may be work a four day week);  3. each employee will take holidays for twice the normal period at half pay; or  4. A combination of the above.

If the person you bought them from doesn't ship them to your buyer your butt will be on the line.

You do not know the address to where the new buyer comes from and I'm sure it's against ebay's policies somewhere.

The only companies that ship single pieces are specialty movers. You can find some by Googling "antique shipping". Next time I will only use the one I originally used for my first purchase. Their name was Transportation Nation(sorry don't know the number...maybe Google it). The sideboard I bought arrived safe(they apparently wrapped it very well with a bunch of furniture blankets). The other 2 companies I used were slightly cheaper, but not worth the hassle of filing claims for damages. I just repaired the pieces myself after no callbacks.

In recent years, the PCAOB (Public Company Accounting Oversight Board) has taken the role of 'policing' the US stock markets (Nasdaq, NYSE, etc.) especially since the inception and adoption of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2004 to ensure the financials (which drive stock prices) are not fraudulently represented. None of these governing bodies have any influence in the London or Hong Kong Exhanges, however. These are governed by difference bodies within each geographical borders.<br>  <br>  The Dow Jones is just a series of securities traded and the information is compiled to reflect the overall market performance. These numbers are compiled based on the volume of trades placed in these securities, as well as the overall prices of the traded securities on a Fair Market Value Basis. <br>  <br>  So in a nutshell there is your answer. Hope this helps, and it gets very much more complicated than my above explanation. You can read about the further structure on almost any website hosted by the PCAOB or SEC. Take care, <br>  -G
A1kiUMgvaa	This specific circumstance has not been addressed but from what has been published by the IRS the short answer would be yes you would have a tax obligation for repayment of that credit.<br>  However the language of the recapture provision would suggest that the credit/loan would be forgiven if you did not purchase another home within two years.  I find nothing that would suggest that anyone has experienced this issue nor has the IRS addressed it specifically.|`|0u6qy9Uuaa	why are you worrying about that mere months after buying your house?<br>  Do you expect it to happen to you? it has to be paid back in full if you sell or leave the house before the 15 yr payback is done|`|9a881112567263b20d6262238853cc86aa	This has not been addressed by the IRS yet.<br>  <br>  I believe that there is a provision that forgives the balance of the loan if you sell the home at a loss of greater to or equal to the balance remaining on the loan.  A foreclosure is considered a deemed sale by the IRS so it would depend on what the bank sells the home for after they foreclose.  One other variable could be whether you have a Recourse or Non-Recourse mortgage.<br>  <br>  My Final Answer:  Maybe!|`|snh9wzpnaa	Yes.  A foreclosure is just a sale of home for tax purposes.  Just because it wasn't necessary voluntary doesn't mean anything.  And any sale of the home before you paid back the $7500 causes you to have to pay the remainder back in the year of sale.|`|2N6oTOLQaa	Of course you do. That credit has to be repaid even if you keep your house. How would loosing your house to foreclosure possibly remove your responsibility to repay the tax loan?

Basically if you can't afford to pay for anything then using a credit card is gonna make this 10 times worse.  <br>  <br>  I don't think pl realise that if you have a balance to pay and only pay the minimum payment without spending on it or making fresh purchases IT WILL TAKE YOU 7 YEARS (NO JOKE) TO CLEAR YR BALANCE OUTSTANDING with added interest monthly etc.  Please believe this - it is true.  So if you go out for a meal and put it on yr card - any card and only pay the min balance each month you are still paying for that Tiramisu 7 yrs later so I hope you enjoyed it at the time !!

So the current financial year ends on Sunday 5th April 2009.|`|434f04a6fde02d2e60610cacc58bd89eaa	The financial year is 1 April to 31 March.

The year is decided by the start date, therefore we are currently in FY08 which started on 1 April 2008.<br>  <br>  The fiscal year is 6 April to 5 April, but that is not the same thing at all.

NCZK0QyGaa	This goes back to the Fraud Triangle - the basic three things necessary for a fraud to be perpetrated.<br>  <br>  1. Opportunity<br>  2. Pressure<br>  3. Rationalization<br>  <br>  In tough times all three of these triggers are increased.  1. Since people are desperate their willingness to try money-making schemes increases; 2. As expenses exceed income the pressure to obtain additional funds increases; and 3. They can rationalize their fraud by thinking of companies as entities rather than considering the people within the entity that will be affected or by saying that they have just hit a rough time and will pay the company back when their financial situation improves.|`|cjfV7XEVaa	The fact is people are desperate.  They need to make additional income to pay for a home that's being foreclosed on or to make up for income lost due to a lay off.<br>  <br>  So when individuals are in that panic/scarcity mindset they will make decisions that, had they had the time to think it through, they might not have otherwise made.<br>  <br>  To avoid scams in general try this<br>  1)Take some time to make any real financial decision.  Rarely is there any decision financially that has to be made "now or never."  Take some time to sit back and look at what's going on objectively.  An adviser that tells you have have to make a move in the next 5 minutes sets off all sorts of red flags!<br>  <br>  2)If it's too good to be true...it could be.  Don't ever fall for a get rich quick scheme.  Those things are laden with either HUGE risk that you might not fully understand or  it's a full on rip off.<br>  <br>  3)Make sure you do your due diligence.   Ask every question about everything.  Where are they getting funding?  How do you get money back?  What's the return?  What's the buisness plan?  If you don't know what questions to ask, find a financial advisor YOU know and trust to help you ask them.|`|ByyfoeAUaa	We're living hard times and evil people are taking adventage of that, when the people are more desperate for easy cash they fall into tricks that promise them they will get it.|`|0u6qy9Uuaa	because people are desperate and the scammers know they can reel in a few suckers|`|iY6GQsRUaa	It is like looting during an environmental disaster.

It's as though the economy waivers around the confidence we have in our President.  This downturn however has some factors that have made it significantly worse and will take more time to fully correct.  If we follow the historical pattern this downturn will be on its way back up by September and that will lead to fixing many of our major problems.  That is my guess.  <br>  <br>  This pattern was the motivation behind the terrorist's plan of attacking the world trade centers in September after the 2000 elections; an effort to send the world economy into a downward spiral and topple the US economic superpower.  Also why so much emphasis was placed on consumer confidence and spending after the attacks.

qWaYbxcxaa	shaking my head.<br>  <br>  I've prob have 100's and 100's of posts about Citi and banks/ financials in general since before and esp during the fall of 2007, and NONE of them positive. <br>  <br>  I specifically cited (beginning on or around fall 2007) names of financials that were at bankruptcy risk, and those that might be at risk. Turns out, every company on my "Bankruptcy Watch List" was at risk. And that has been the correct call for the last 2 years.<br>  <br>  I have repeated this Bearish mantra like a broken record for another what over 3000-3700 some posts since. So I am amazed that I am still seeing these questions. <br>  <br>  Granted, you prob didn't know, or see my posts, I understand. Most people just ask the questions, and don't bother searching for answers that are already there. That's OK. I'm still here to try and help. Not trying to be hard on ya, just trying to get the point to everyone WHY it is important to have a seasoned professional advisor.<br>  <br>  I have stated that Citi and BAC and others are technically insolvent. They are trading to or close to zero.<br>  <br>  The USG has invested some $40-45 billion in Citi that currently is worth $10 billion today. If one factors Cit's $2 Trillion debt, minus the REAL current value of their assets (which is far less that their balance sheet is showing - market forces driving down prices, increasing defaults, etc), the company is worthless, worse than AIG in my view.<br>  <br>  The USG has loaned some what $40+ billion (that will now prob move to $80+ billion to GM, F, & Chrysler. I said last year (2008) BEFORE the auto bailout that the real auto bailout costs could be around $100-125 billion+). <br>  <br>  And these auto companies are paying about 8% interest to the US Gov, and then loaning that money out at 0.00% to consumers. We'll, one can't borrow money at 8% and loan it out at 0% and run that business for too long.<br>  <br>  The market is convinced that they (banks, and auto industry?) will be nationalized. I have said that this would be bearish for the banks (and any gov ran industry) and would likely wipe out the equity of the common stock of any gov ran company.<br>  <br>  If one wants to speculate, I'd rather own the preferred stock of Citi at 23 cents with a whopping yield, however I am not speculating in something that I see as a losing trade. <br>  <br>  Been short Citi and pretty much every bank, broker, mortgage, real estate company, and others such as S&P 500 since 2007 (trading).<br>  <br>  At some point (poss soon) we will have a huge (short covering) rally just like we had last Nov/ December 2008. I called a 1000 point rally about a week before that occurred at that time and posted that here on Y!A.<br>  <br>  At that time, I said I would be short on any rebound rally and seeing (early) January 2009 as the D-day for the downside again. <br>  <br>  I posted on or about the Th or Fri of the 5th/6th trading day in Jan 09 that we had a negative close in the S&P 500 - a bearish sign for a downturn, that would need to be confirmed by the last trading day in Jan 09.<br>  <br>  We had the worst Jan (2009) close in history, down over 8% for the month. This confirmed my Bearish move for the market would be down even further. <br>  <br>  I stated around the time of the Superbowl (2009) that I expected to see a negative to flat year at best in 2009. As of 02-19-2009, the S&P 500 is down 15%+ for the year.<br>  <br>  Intraday today, F 02-20-09: check out these numbers:<br>  <br>  From Jan 2, 2009 to intraday trading, 02-20-2009: <br>  Citigroup (C) down 70% in 2009<br>  BAC down 85% in 2009<br>  AIG down 68% in 2009<br>  Capital One (COF) down 71% in 2009<br>  JPM down 42% in 2009<br>  AXP down 33% in 2009<br>  <br>  This is on top of 2008's huge losses. <br>  <br>  NONE of ANY bailout money which we have about $9+ Trillion in new spending, bailouts, loan guarantees, or other guarantees have had ANY positive impact to the market or economy. I have repeated stated that they will not work to "save the economy." We have to take the pain and let is play out. <br>  <br>  The market has sent the signal were things are going to go no matter what Obama, or previously Bush thinks they will try to do. <br>  <br>  I am starting to move into the Bear Camp that says we MIGHT, just might go back to Year 2000 levels in the market. Some people are Super Bearish and say we may hit 1995 levels in the market. I'm not in that camp right now. <br>  <br>  I recall that during the ".com Bust" (2000-2002) the ENTIRE up move in .com stocks had been completely revered to the point back to where they were prior, to their run up. <br>  <br>  Look at any chart, 1995-2002 and you will see these companies have an upside down wide "V" shape on those charts. The  upside down "V" are the start and end points to the move of the stock(s). Everything in between (those gains on the upswing) were erased if one did not sell by the time the down leg (the other side of the "V") occurred.<br>  <br>  Thus, taking from recent history, the last recession from the .com crash ended in October 2002. It was in 2000-2002 that the real estate boom started again. Therefore, we should erase all the gains we had from 2002-2009 which we had done, but could also erase all the gains we had from the start of the real estate boom which was year 2000. <br>  <br>  If this new upside down "V" in the current trend that showed tops by 2007, and the market right now is trading like it could happen, we could see a lot more down side.<br>  <br>  If that year 2000 point does not hold in the market which I think is a weak period for the market (being 2000 was a market top), I could then see how some people think we could go down to 1995 levels - to erase the entire .com and real estate boom gains.<br>  <br>  Now before you hit the sell button, I am not saying we are going to year 2000 or 1995 levels. It won't happen overnight or in a few months. I am saying it is possible over an extended period of time.<br>  <br>  It is HIGHLY likely that BEFORE any new big down leg happens, we have a HUGE rally, which I would be shorting again unless other data proved me otherwise.<br>  <br>  Last Nov/ Dec 2008, I stated on Y!A that we could have "The Mother of All Bear Market Rally's." We did from Nov low to early Jan 2009. This suckered people into buying because "things were low priced, and they thought they would go back up." You can trade on that move. I did for my clients. You just have to know what kind of animal (market) we are dealing with.<br>  <br>  The adage: "Don't try and catch a falling knife" has come to mind over and over of those wanting to buy a big name stock that is falling so fast to the point of bankruptcy or to the effect.<br>  <br>  I have written extensively of the autos too: None of it good. Sorry, that is the reality. <br>  <br>  GM is at 1938 lows (02-020-009). GM had a market cap in 1929 at $4 billion. Today, GM has a market cap of $1 Billion. (CNBC-TV, 02-20-2009)<br>  <br>  After listen to the nationalization arguments, it sounds as if this would be difficult undertaking, but not impossible. The USG would have to guarantee all the deposits of banks, and could be facing a total of $30 Trillion in guarantees according to CNBC. This would triple the US Gov debt, and "could crash the US Dollar."  <br>  <br>  So who knows what will happen, but it seems like no matter what happens there will be no guarantees on the common equity of stocks. This has been true since 1787.<br>  <br>  See my post history. I have prob covered  every question more than once than has been asked on Y!A regarding investing.<br>  <br>  Add me to view post history.<br>  <br>  ********edit 1:<br>  OK for legal reasons I don't make buy /sell recommendations on the Internet. I try and offer general information, and have people decide on their own what is right for them. <br>  <br>  I always tell people to seek an (in person) professional advisor with 15+ years of real market experience - not just one selling mutual funds, etc. <br>  <br>  Your risk:<br>  Is the the current price of Citi to zero. I would not be surprised that this stock could run 20-60% on short covering. All these short sellers have to buy the stock at some point in order to capture their gains. <br>  <br>  The risk also can be that the stock gets wiped out first, or trades down to the other US Gov take over stocks. <br>  <br>  Look at FNM, FRE, AIG stocks. All of them are US gov controlled (U.S. owns 80% of AIG), and all are trading for about 50 cents now - far more than they are currently worth. So be prepared that this is a likely 'end game' result in my view.<br>  <br>  ********edit 2:<br>  I am now on both sides of the Citi trade. Closed my effective short. Reopened the trade using call and put options. <br>  <br>  Long Mar 2.50 calls (hedge in case of technical rebound)<br>  Long Mar 2.50 puts (betting on nationalization/ gov take over/ or effective stock price collapse to under $1.00)<br>  <br>  Also bought a S&P Mar Call in case of a technical rebound. <br>  <br>  I'm net short on Citi - more money on the down side than upside. My strategy is that a radical move in either direction should net positive the combined positions. <br>  <br>  Positions and opinions can change anytime without notice. See disclaimers on Yahoo 360 profile (bottom).<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|L9Cx70gtaa	It will hurt, and I can't guarantee that things won't unexpectedly go up, and you might hate me..

Please find another bank with a better interest rate. You would actually be better off with a credit card with a lower interest rate!<br>  <br>  With this economy it should be very easy to find a lower interest rate and save yourself hundreds, possibly even a thousand dollars.  If you are able to pay the loan off two years earlier then you will save a lot more money in interest but will have much much bigger payments to make.

The most that will happen to him is a fine for getting it out late.<br>  <br>  But you are supposed to keep track of your income.  You still have to report it - whether or not you receive a 1099 for it.<br>  <br>  Do an amended return to figure the tax due on the extra income.<br>  <br>  I'm assuming that when you say "my business" you're talking about a sole proprietorship....in which case, it doesn't matter if the 1099 is issued to your peronal name or your DBA name...it still goes on your Schedule C.  If it's a business that's encorporated or a partnership - then amend the return that applies if the income wasn't previously shown.  And then send him a certified letter telling him he needs to correct the 1099, and give him the EIN it should be reported under.<br>  <br>  If he's that big a jerk - he might not correct it...but as long as you've accounted for the income in the right place, you won't have anything to worry about in the end.|`|MmTe8W8uaa	The point of the deadlines is so that, even if the mail is slow, you receive the form before the deadline for you to file.  If you received the form already and have not yet filed, it is not late enough to matter.<br>  <br>  If the business is a sole proprietorship for which you report income on Schedule C or C-EZ, it does not matter whether the 1099 has your name or the business's name.  If the business is a C corporation that must file its own return, is a partnership, then it does matter.|`|Jgg7ZTItaa	You will still need to make the attempt to have him send you a corrected 1099.  Send him a certified letter stating what you need.

This will also help.  <br>  <br>  If you are looking at owing additional taxes because of it you might want to contact the IRS and get advise on recourse before they start hitting you with fines and penalties.|`|NwkZ5OmCaa	First off, when he agreed to pay you, you gave him a W-9.  On the W-9, you would have indicated your name, the name of the single-member LLC, the fact that you weren't an S-corp.  On the form, you would have put your SSN or the LLC's EIN (single member LLC's don't necessarily have an EIN).<br>  <br>  The 1099-Misc, if done correctly would have shown your name on line 1, the LLC name on line 2 and your SSN or EIN.  He wasn't allowed to show the payment in just the name of the LLC.<br>  <br>  Next, you were already reporting the income on your schedule C from *your* records.  The 1099-Misc was merely a courtesy to remind you that he also reported the income to the government.  The only time you should have an issue is if you were also reimbursed for expenses and didn't know if the payer was on an accountable plan or not.<br>  <br>  The IRS (and your accountant) expect *your* records to be correct.

HlUEFypHaa	It actually depends on the state.  Some states have laws that let a bank take a judgment against you for the balance owed, some don't allow it.<br>  <br>  Edit:  I think this sums up Michigan, but check here:  Michigan Statues Annotated, Vol. 22, Sections 27A.3140, 27A.3201 et seq.  <br>  <br>  If the law says it depends on what you've agreed to, you'll need to read the actual Mortgage document you signed:  "A lender is restricted to foreclosing against the property as the sole remedy, unless the lender has a separate document that obligates the borrower to pay a sum certain, such as a promissory note, or the borrower has otherwise agreed to pay a sum in a specific amount stated in the mortgage document. In order to recover a deficiency amount, which would be the balance due on the mortgage minus the sum collected at the foreclosure sale (or credited if the lender bids by canceling out some of the borrower's obligation), the lender must file a lawsuit. The borrower can defend by showing the foreclosure sale price was less than the true value of the property at the time and place of the sale. If the sale was for substantially less than the true value, the deficiency sum the lender can recover may be either defeated or reduced by crediting the property's fair value against the unpaid loan balance at the time of the foreclosure. However, these defenses do not apply if the lender forecloses by court action rather than by foreclosure by advertisement. "|`|VCIZJQCJaa	i am  just sick when i hear a story like yours some people file bankruptcy and negotiate the balance others walk away from the balance owed  thousands  are walking away.you gotta do what is best for you right now. it is amazing  when the banks get rewarded with gov,t funds for fraud but give no break at all to the people. can you hang in there long enough and see what obama will offer home owners? i'd stay in the house ,fight  as long as possible. our friends are school teachers,and they filed bankruptcy they lost their house in florida because the taxes and hurricane insurance exceeded well above $2000.00 on their original closing .,but still owe a huge monthly balance,they will have it paid off in 7 years,when their bankruptcy is over.just in time to buy a new home.is this sicko  bank coincidence? just try to maintain your dignity for now wait and see.|`|2N6oTOLQaa	Officially, you still owe the difference. The bank has several options on how to proceed. <br>  <br>  1. If they think they can still get some money out of you for the debt, then they can collect on it like any other debt. They can sell it to a collections agency, or pursue you themselves. They can sue you if you don't pay (and they will win). After they get a judgment against you, they can garnish your wages (when you get a job) until the debt is fully repaid.<br>  <br>  2. Banks will usually take a settlement at a fraction of the balance. They know that if they pursue you for the full amount, there is a good chance that you will file bankruptcy and have the debt canceled by the courts. They know that if that happens, they'll get nothing, so they'd rather take a small settlement and get something. If you go this route, make sure you get clear written documentation that shows that the payment you make settles the debt in full, and the bank has no further rights to collect on this debt. Get that statement BEFORE you send payment, and never trust a verbal promise from a bank employee, because as soon as you send payment, nobody will remember what that particular employee promised you. <br>  <br>  3. The bank can cancel the debt and write it off on their books as a loss. Sometimes they'll just accept this option because it gives them a tax break the could be more valuable to them than pursuing you for the debt. If they do this (or if they settle as described in option 2) they can issue you a 1099 for tax purposes. This means that the amount of debt that they canceled on your behalf, counts as income to you when you file your income taxes. This could create a huge tax bill for you if they cancel tens of thousands of dollars in debt. This endes the bank's right to collect the debt, but  you will quickly find yourself in debt to the IRS. <br>  <br>  Hope things work out okay for you.|`|ikXRqWxUaa	the answer depends on your state, and whether your mortgage was written as recourse or non-recourse.  assuming that it's a recourse mortgage, what will happen is that the price the home fetched sold is subtracted from the oustanding loan balance.  legal and selling fees are added back in.  this is the amount that you still owe the bank.  it's call the "deficiency"<br>  <br>  they can pursue this themselves or sell the debt to a collection agency.  eventually though (depending on how much that is), they can come after you in court for the deficiency.   if they get a judgment against you, they can garnish your wages, lien your other titled assets (cars, boats, other homes, etc), or freeze and or attach to bank accounts.  <br>  <br>  worst of all, that foreclosure will be on your credit reports for 7 years.  the judgment can be on your reports for 10 or more.  <br>  <br>  a lot of states have abolished 1099c'ing for owner occupied primary homes that are foreclosed.  for investment properties though, they are still fair game.  as the last poster said, it would be a huge tax bill and you would be better off owing the bank than the IRS, who can be far more ruthless and have much more power.|`|AA12065533	In most cases you will be responsible for the balance after the auction. There are special circumstances when a loan is backed by the VA though.

The judgment, if requested, is usually granted at the last foreclosure hearing.  Sounds like your foreclosure didn't take place recently, so if you haven't heard from the mortgagee I guess they didn't puruse it.  Check your county's public records to see if a judgment has been filed against you.<br>  <br>  realtor.sailor

A few Krugerrands, sure, but after that you have to start worrying more and more about safety, fire, theft, etc.<br>  <br>  Holding physical gold in a depository might be OK, but there are fees and I personally doubt whether the trouble is worth it. (Not that there aren't fees with all of these scenarios.)  They are not regulated to the extent that ETFs and mutual funds are.<br>  <br>  Funds that use derivatives can fail to track the underlying commodity sometimes, particularly in the long term.<br>  <br>  Gold mining stocks currently appear undervalued compared to the commodity itself -- they are priced conservatively.<br>  <br>  So my personal opinion is that if you want bullion ownership, buy an ETF that holds bullion (GLD); but in the near term future, if you think gold will continue to go up, gold mining stocks are probably a better bet.<br>  <br>  However, I am not personally confident that any of these are a good investment in the current environment, not confident that I can predict the future price of gold, and so I am not invested in gold in any way other than by giving my wife jewelry from time to time.

DPajzalfaa	I am a professional resume writer (which also means cover and thank you letters), so please listen. <br>  <br>  In your letter, be cordial, yet still professional. You are not her friend, or her colleague. You are looking for a job. <br>  <br>  Make sure you thank her for her time, and consideration. Stress how interested you are in the position. <br>  <br>  Hopefully during the interview you took notes (or have a superb memory). Recap the points in your skills that make you the best candidate. If she voiced any concerns about your ability to do the job, address those as well- but make sure you give supporting evidence as to why those are not things to be concerned about. for example- if a concern was inexperience- you can refute that by emphasizing your willingness and quickness to learn from other staff members. <br>  <br>  Run spell check, but also have a friend (who is detail oriented and would notice mistakes) read it. Go have a snack or run an errand and proof read it again before sending it. <br>  <br>  Good Luck to you!

However importing is not a get rich quick proposition. <br>  <br>  In order to import for resale, you will need to import in volume. That volume will require anywhere from 6 - 10 weeks to receive your merchandise as it will be coming by Ocean Freight.<br>  <br>  You will also need a good customs broker in your area that can readily clear your items through customs. Just as important as the customs broker in the US is the Freight forwarder who prepares your shipment and all the associated paper work.<br>  <br>  You will need to answer many questions first. Who will you buy from? are they trustworthy? What products will you buy? Are they sell-able? Who will you sell to? What about pricing? Storage?

Well actually, if they were really married (rather than just living together) then he would have been able to become a legal tenant.

95c065274173702e7fa3abcdf4f5d394aa	It goes back to what you mean by "great shape" Most US coins never circulated much, they do not tone much, so will look very good. For gold coins, you really have to know how to grade precisely to get an accurate value. The price between slight wear and no wear is huge. Unless you wish to learn how to grade, I would take it to a coin club or a coin show and ask for assistance on how to grade the coin. Only then can you look up the value.<br>  <br>  By the way, 1844 is a better date than most you see in the late 1800's and 1900's. I would not be surprise to learn it was very valuable, or at least much more valuable than the approximately quarter ounce of gold in it. You can look up values at www.pcgs.com

What's not so common is the (ttm), so I assume that's what you're probably asking about.  <br>  <br>  TTM stands for trailing twelve months, so whenever you see this acronym, just mentally add "for the last 12 months".  In this case, this is to clarify what EPS  period you're referring to (for example, year-to-year EPS, this quarter's EPS, or future estimated EPS which are based on analysts' estimates).

AA11206283	They are so small they are hosted by yahoo. Not a good thing.<br>  <br>  From HUD:<br>  <br>  OCC Consumer Tips for Avoiding Foreclosure Rescue Scams<br>  Foreclosures are increasing nationwide, and so are scams that promise to “rescue” homeowners from foreclosure.  What these scams do is take your money, ruin your credit record, and wipe out any equity you have in your home.  <br>  <br>  <br>  Foreclosure con artists take advantage of people who have fallen behind on their mortgages and face foreclosure.  Con artists know that people in these situations are vulnerable and likely to be desperate.  Potential victims are easy to find: mortgage lenders publish notices before foreclosing on homes.  After reading such notices, con artists approach their targets in person, by mail, over the telephone, or by e-mail.  They advertise their services on Web sites or publications.  They often refer to themselves with titles that sound official, such as “foreclosure consultant” or “mortgage consultant,” and market themselves as a “foreclosure service” or “foreclosure rescue agency.” <br>  <br>  <br>  Your mortgage lender – or any legitimate financial counselor – can help you find real options to avoid foreclosure.  If someone offers to negotiate with your lender and offers to arrange to stop or delay foreclosure for a fee, carefully check his or her credentials, reputation, and experience.  To protect yourself, follow the recommendations contained in this Consumer Advisory.  <br>  <br>  <br>  WATCH OUT FOR FORECLOSURE RESCUE SCAMS <br>  <br>  Lease-Back or Repurchase Scams – Be very suspicious if someone offers to pay your mortgage and rent your home back to you.  This scheme often involves signing the deed to your home over to the con artist.  The con artist may promise to sell your home back to you, but this may be very difficult, if not impossible, under the terms of the contract. <br>  Signing over the deed gives the con artist the power to evict you, raise your rent, sell the house, or steal the equity you have in your home.  You will still be responsible for your mortgage, so if the con artist stops paying it, your lender would have the right to foreclose on your home, and the foreclosure and any other problems would go on your credit record.<br>  <br>  Refinance Fraud – Look out for people posing as mortgage brokers or lenders and offering to refinance your loan so you can afford the payments.  Con artists may trick you into signing over the ownership of your home by saying that you are signing documents for a new loan. <br>  Signing over the deed to your home exposes you to the dangers described above.  Even if you are a victim of fraud, you could still lose your home.  <br>  <br>  Bankruptcy Schemes – Several scams attempt to abuse the bankruptcy laws.  For example, a con artist may ask you to give a partial interest in your home to one or more persons.  Each holder of a partial interest can then file bankruptcy, one after another.  The bankruptcy court will issue a “stay” order each time to stop foreclosure temporarily.  However, the stay does not excuse you from making payments or from repaying the full amount of your loan.  In another kind of scam, a con artist may offer to obtain refinancing or negotiate a payment plan with your lender.  If you may make payments to the con artist, he or she may keep the money rather than pay the lender on your behalf.  The con artist may even file a bankruptcy case in your name, without your knowledge, as a part of the scam. <br>  Bankruptcy laws provide important protections to consumers.  Scams can only temporarily delay foreclosure, and they may keep you from using bankruptcy laws legitimately to address your financial problems.  Signing over ownership of your home, or even partial ownership, can result in serious financial harm.<br>  <br>  <br>  HOW TO PROTECT YOURSELF FROM SCAMS<br>  <br>  Know what you are signing.  Read and understand every document you sign.  If a document is too complex, seek advice from a lawyer or an approved, trusted financial counselor.  Never sign documents with blank spaces that can be filled in later.  Never sign a document that contains errors or false statements, even if someone promises to correct them later. <br>  Get promises in writing.  Oral promises and agreements relating to your home are usually not legally binding.  Protect your rights with a written document or contract signed by the person making the promise.  Keep copies of all contracts you sign.  <br>  Make your mortgage payments directly to your lender or the mortgage servicer.  Do not trust anyone else to make mortgage payments for you. <br>  Be very careful about signing over your deed.  Foreclosure scams often require you to sign over ownership of your home to a con artist or another third party.  Never sign over your deed without getting the advice of your own lawyer, financial advisor, or other independent person that you know you can trust.  Understand the terms of the deal you are making.  By signing over your deed, you lose your rights to your home and any equity built up in the home. <br>  R|`|11fzAz3saa	I was in foreclosure.

oU9rI4woaa	Both the previous answers clearly do not know what life settlements are.  A life settlement works this way:<br>  <br>  1) Somebody has a life insurance policy and needs or wants cash.<br>  2) An investor, or investors, buys the policy for a fraction of the face value, then assumes ownership and pays the premium.<br>  3) Investor hopes the insured dies soon, thereby realizing a profit on someone else's death.<br>  <br>  From the sounds of it, you were probably approached by someone who wants you to be part of an investment group.  It's a little creepy if you ask me.  I'd recommend you roll that money straight to an IRA that is a little more conventional.<br>  <br>  good luck|`|Saul1Bhuaa	You'll have to decide for yourself, but:<br>  <br>  1.  Life insurance products, including annuities, are very costly to you and very profitable to the salesman.<br>  <br>  2.  401k plans are "exempt" assets whereas life insurance products, generally are not exempt.  Exempt means that no matter how much money you owe anyone on the planet, the exempt assets belong to you.  (Remember OJ Simpson and his $30 million dollar judgment.  He keeps on collecting his pension because it is exempt.)|`|9k4d7Kytaa	Some annuities can be a good place for retirement assets based upon your goals with that money.  When you retire, do you want a guaranteed set income for life?  If yes, then an annuity can be a good option.  If you'd rather be able to take your money as you need it, but run the risk that it runs out, then an annuity is not a good option.<br>  <br>  Some variable annuities also have options where you can invest in separate accounts (basically mutual funds) but still have principal protection to protect you from losing your money during a market downturn.  Ask about this option.  If the agent is an independent agent or State Farm agent then they may have the ability to sell the Phoenix Spectrum Edge + which has a really great Guaranteed Minimum Accumulation Benefit for the purpose of principal protection.  Now, this is an insurance product so you're essentially going to be paying a premium for that added protection just like you pay a premium on your car, home and life insurance.  It can be costly...but it can save you thousands upon thousands of dollars as well.<br>  <br>  However, if you're not interested in either guaranteed income for life or principal protection on your money (at a cost) then you'd be better off rolling your 401(k) into some standard mutual funds...and you'd be better off doing that with a discount mutual fund company like Vangaurd, Fidelity or T. Rowe Price.<br>  <br>  I'm personally a fan of annuities that can provide principal protection, but not everybody feels that the premium is worth it.  That's up for you to decide.<br>  <br>  EDIT:<br>  <br>  I understand what a life (or viatical) settlement is, but I figured that this was a miss-use of terminology by the asker (very common on Yahoo! Answers, and totally fine).  Actual life settlement investments are very rare and complex, and the investor tends to be a very high net worth individual.  Also, I've never heard of a life settlement being structured as an IRA (unlike annuities).  If it truly is a life or viatical settlement, I would personally stay away.

72c3b924e93e85f5493bc3f07051afb4aa	Let's see I can make some sense.<br>  <br>  In states that provide tax deeds to the tax-lien buyer, the deeds are issued at the tax sale auction (although sometimes they're held unrecorded). Deeds either wholly or conditionally transfer title to the subject property from the tax-delinquent owner to the successful bidder. In cases where the portion of property taxes is not paid along with the monthly mortgage payment (a PITI, or principal-interest-taxes-insurance, payment), the successful bidder is most often the first-mortgage holder. Furthermore, federal statutes provide that if government-insured financing (an FHA loan, for example) is in place on a property that's sold at a tax sale, the government agency has one full year in which to redeem it. In other words, don't count on moving in or immediately selling such a property the day after you purchase it at the auction.<br>  <br>  In some states, after the tax deed has been issued, the successful bidder must then contend with the state's statute of redemption, which is a law that allows the delinquent owner to reclaim the property by paying all back taxes, expenses, and accrued interest within a specified period of time. In most states, all lien holders of record must be served notice, and they are also given the opportunity to redeem the property prior to the expiration of the redemption period. Once the deed is actually issued to the new owner, all prior liens are extinguished.<br>  <br>  In those states that issue certificates, forfeiture of property for tax delinquency does not convey ownership to the subject property. Instead, a tax-lien certificate creates a first-priority lien on the property with the right of foreclosure – again, subject to the state's statutory right of redemption.<br>  <br>  The buyer of the certificate pays the outstanding tax and other expenses. He or she must then wait through the redemption period. In order to redeem the property during that time, the delinquent owner must pay the certificate holder the full amount that was paid for the tax certificate, along with interest and sometimes expenses and penalty fees. The interest rate on tax lien certificates is set by each municipality and is often quite high, typically in the range of 15- to 20 percent, and can sometimes be even higher. If the tax-delinquent owner or another party with a possible legal interest in the property (such as an ex-spouse, an heir or perhaps a contractor holding a mechanic's lien) does not redeem the tax certificate within the allotted time, the certificate holder must then initiate foreclosure proceedings. These proceedings are the means by which title will actually convey to the certificate holder.<br>  <br>  However, even when foreclosure proceedings are complete, there still may be claims against the property or other problems in getting clear and marketable title. If this occurs, the investor must go to court for a "quiet title" action (which is a court procedure to establish ownership of real property when it's under dispute). If the court's decision favors the certificate holder, then he or she will receive clear title to the property; if it rules differently, he or she will lose the real estate and all money that's been invested in it.|`|3d5b2006369d379cd04e938a9cd52652aa	I don't think so. He'd have to pay the back taxes and maybe the liens.|`|AA11132354	PLEASE read up on what you have done, learn what you are doing, not just how to do it.<br>  YES, the owner has rights to cure, to get their property back.  The whole thing of the tax sale is bidding to pay taxes and the amount of interest to be paid to redeem the property.<br>  Of course ALL the liens on property would be prior to yours, and if any of them are foreclosed, can wipe out all junior liens.

2N6oTOLQaa	If you are talking about the stimulus package that congress just passed, which Obama signed into law on Tuesday, then there are no lump sum checks. The only portion of that package that goes directly to tax payers is that tax brackets are lowered by $400 per person and $800 for married couples. That money will not be paid in a lump sum like last year. It will show as a little bit less being taken out of each paycheck so your net take home pay will be a little higher. It will average out to an extra $13 of take home pay per paycheck for the average person. Then, when you file your taxes at the end of 2009, the amount you owe for the year will be less to compensate for that fact that less money was withheld from your paycheck.<br>  <br>  Bottom line, there is no lump sum amount this time.|`|d331dd95c4a1ebbb6ed4bd0996d3a0b6aa	no check this time|`|oCEnm3vvaa	Here's a breakdown: <a href="http://www.boston.com/business/articles/2009/02/17/what_will_the_787b_stimulus_do_for_you/" rel="nofollow">http://www.boston.com/business/articles/...</a>|`|bfe4ad38e28ddda61b321173866c1f9aaa	This year it is currently only a tax rebate where the Feds will pull less money out of your paychecks starting later this year.|`|kifwyOgKaa	We, the people, are NOT going to receive a lump sum check ie, stimulus check.|`|gYWDrHVFaa	No check for anyone.

It depends greatly on how long you have until you retire.  If you are 40 or under, and you are investing in companies that you feel won't go under in the long term - you may be buying stocks at a great bargain and will end up making a lot of money in the long term.  If you are over 40 or 50, then you should talk to a financial planner.<br>  <br>  Also it depends greatly on your salary.  Money that you don't put in your 401k will be taxed, if you put in less money than your employer matches, you will have you given up 'free' money.  I'm afraid that you'll have to do some math to figure out what is best for you.<br>  <br>  EDIT: Crap, you said IRA, not 401k...  so the part about matching and taxes don't apply at all.  Sorry!

Bw1h5xAcaa	There is no "right" way to go about it. You can do it either way. Yes, most hospitals will pay some degree of tuition reimbursement for their RNs to complete the BSN, but don't count on them paying for all of it. <br>  <br>  Factors to consider when deciding whether to pursue the ADN vs. BSN would be the admissions situations at your schools of interest. For many people, obtaining their ADN ends up being a 3-4 year process when you factor in the time to complete pre-requisites, and possibly having to apply several years before gaining admittance to the program because there are simply so many applicants and very few spots in programs. <br>  <br>  Sometimes you're better off going into a regular university and declaring your major and if you have a high GPA it's a little easier getting accepted into the BSN programs, and boom, you're done with the BSN in 4 years if you were attending full-time every semester.<br>  <br>  I went the ADN first route for many complex reasons. It took me 3 years in all. I immediately found a job and was offered some tuition assistance of about $3500 per year, and enrolled in a distance learning (online) BSN completion program based at a public college in my state (avoid for-profit schools like University of Phoenix).<br>  <br>  Just take your time to do a lot of research into the admissions processes of the schools you are interested in, look at cost factors, see if you can find out how much tuition reimbursement is offered at hospitals in your area, etc. Good luck!

Do, this it will save you in the end.  You will be writing him a mortgage for the $4500 with an interest rate, etc.. You need to write terms for the money he will be paying you with conditions as to him defaulting ( not paying )  Terms should clearly state that you can take back the premises if he doesnt pay..  Don't rush this.  Do the right thing and protect yourself..  Take a few days to put it all together for yourself.  Protect yourself.. Here is good thing to do.. Call a lawyer and have him draw up the contract and see if he will draw it up for $400..  Take the $1000 cash as a deposit and give receipt to be held by lawyer.. Draw up the contract and slip in there buyer to pay Atty fees and recording fees..  So, you walk with $600 , and the buyer pays all your fees and your protected..

Florida is full of horse farms and has equestrian competitions every year. Madonna even had a horse competing this year.|`|auegTf2iaa	To cold in Tennesee.. Go back looking in Florida..  You can get really good deals in SW Florida.  I would look at Arcadia Florida..  Its inexpensive with great weather, and its horse country..<br>  EDIT:  Have you checked temps in Tennesee in the winter?  Its freezing there..  Florida is the way to go..  Cheap land and housing and nice mild temps and flat land with plenty of grazing<br>  EDIT 2:  You must be looking at the immigration stats from 2006..  I hardly see any mexicans here now.  Remember, the FL building boom is over. They have all gone back to Mexico, I think..  As far as crime, SW Florida on the gulf is low crime..  Its the east coast that has all the crime. Yes, prop tax is high, but that will only be the 1st year.  It will adjust on the second year and FL also has the homestead act ( 25K exemption for all FL residents )

It will cost you an additional 4.11 per day for 1 year to cover that $1500. So are you going to walk away from all your utility deposits and all the time you've waiting to get to this point? Why not consider this, ask the seller to pay 1/4, you pay 1/4 and the agents pay 1/4 of the 1500.  $375 each. <br>  <br>  As for your walking away, what you have to KNOW is that your offer was written in such a way that if the appraisal came in low or you weren't qualified, the offer would become null and void. Does it say that? If not, you stand to lose your earnest money. <br>  <br>  You have three choices, #1 walk away, #2 pay the 1500, #3 ask all parties to pay part of 1500.|`|bf5nEVATaa	Your realtor should have helped you with this one, I just brought a house and the same thing happened to me, either the saler drops the house to the  appraisd price or let you out the deal and give you your earnest money back...sorry<br>  <br>  ..Also, the shouldn't have let you turn on any utillities before closing<br>  <br>  ...your realtor let you down big time|`|LIxpXTnLaa	I wouldn't give up a house I like over a silly $1500 descrepancy unless I straight out could not pay it.<br>  <br>  It does depend on the contract.

Our real estate agent took a cut in his commision and paid the difference, he worked for both us and the sellers. But I wasnt going to let my dream home slip away over a small 1550.00 dollars difference.

BoAEgaAGaa	Past experience shows that the IRS will not allow a deposit into a bank account that the taxpayer is not listed as an owner on.  This is to keep from refunds being deposited into the wrong accounts.  If this occurs the refund is normally sent back to the IRS and it will then be sent to you by check.

Perhaps I am being overly self critical, but I believe I may have appeared timid in my demeanor.

Instead you could say something to the extent of ' I am enthusiastic about this position and am eager to get to know and work with the rest of your team!'<br>  <br>  This is an indirect method of showing your enthusiasm and that you like working with people, but does not say 'I am not normally so shy, forgive me, I was nervous'. <br>  <br>  I hope that helps!

3ExcyAJaaa	Playing Forex can appear alluring, but the majority  of people who try it lose money.  All you have to do is do a web search on the words "Forex" and "lose" to see this is the consensus.<br>   <br>  Forex is what we call a "zero sum" game.  You are making a bet with someone else about whether a currency will rise or fall.  For every winner there has to be a loser.  If you are smarter than the average player, you may make money.  If you are dumber than the average player, you are likely to lose money.  Most of the people making the "bets" in Forex are highly trained professionals at banks and other institutions.  You are unlikely to beat them at this game.<br>   <br>  Actually  Forex is not quite a zero sum game.  It's a slightly negative sum game as the Forex broker takes a small percentage each time in the spread.  It's a small amount but over a hundred trades, it ends up being a considerable amount of money.  So the average player is likely to lose money, and remember the average player is a highly trained professional and probably smarter than you.<br>  <br>  There is a lot of luck in Forex, and if you play it, you will have some periods of time where you make money.  This is usually because you are having a lucky streak, not because you have suddenly become an expert Forex player.  However, most people are unwilling to admit their success is due to luck.  They become convinced they have a system that works, and lose a lot of money trying to refine it.<br>   <br>  Further complicating the problem is the large number of Forex scams on the internet.  Most Forex websites are of questionable honesty.<br>  <br>   I would recommend not trying to do Forex at all, unless you are a trained professional.  It's like playing poker with people better than you, with the house constantly taking a small percentage from the pot.<br>  <br>  P.S. I have never heard of a automated Forex program for home use that actually works, although a lot of people on the internet try to hawk programs they claim work.  However, I am sure the professionals that constitute most of the Forex market have better programs that you are able to buy.   Once again, you are playing at a disadvantage.|`|hVuDF91Caa	Studying Forex can't hurt, and at the very least can lead you into a better knowledge of more things in the business community like International stocks, U.S. Bonds, and commodities.

Ch9TedMcaa	Buy no load mutual and index funds, dollar cost average, hold for the long term.|`|zI2KS0HOaa	Well, opinions will be all over the map on this question, but you asked what people are doing:<br>  <br>  I'm buying stocks, mostly via mutual funds.<br>  <br>  I am not confident that I can predict the short term movements of the market, but I am confident that buying stocks in the depths of a recession is always a good idea in the LONG term.  You don't have to know whether this week is the absolute bottom to be relatively confident that buying now will make you money if your time frame is more than 3-5 years, and even more confident if your time frame is 10 years or more.<br>  <br>  And if you sell now, exactly when would you buy again?  After the market is definitely on the way back up?  That almost certainly means "sell low, buy high" which is not a winning proposition.<br>  <br>  However, I don't mean by this that buying ANY stock or fund is a good idea.  Diversification is a must, and buying funds with low fees and broad diversification is always a good idea.  (That why index funds are a great idea.)  If you have literally lost 50% of your initial investments, it may be a good time to re-examine your choice of funds. Perhaps your asset allocation was not very well-diversified, and now may be a good time to correct that.<br>  <br>  Best of luck.|`|GTTYxxM7aa	Well, short answer is I don't know.

Lucky, I have adhered to the old rule, spread your assets in 1/3 gold, 1/3 real estate, 1/3 stocks, mutual funds.<br>  I although did my research and know, that real estate and stocks do not increase more then inflation over a long time, so my expectations where always very low. I never believed the lies Mutual Fund Managers spew.<br>  As long as I am healthy, my family is doing fine and we have to eat, we can laugh about the greed and stupidity of people, who think, that parties are endless.<br>  <br>  Right now, anything you do can be wrong. If we hit a real depression, gold will be worthless, you better own a small farm. Watch out, inflation is going to come like a tidal wave

T1SmVFwCaa	you're a landlord...I don't trust you|`|0ixBWT6Xaa	Take pics of the damage and any bills you have for fixing it. Why should they get back rent when they lived there? Was there a lease, if so did they leave before the lease was up? You have to prove your damages.That's how it works in the U.S. anyway. If you have no paper work on the rental agreement then you are screwed.|`|tdQTZPI7aa	Bring your  proof of damage.  Photos and the paid receipts for the repairs needed.  Then counter sue for harassment.|`|49d798aae69c40cbf0926ebc21291224aa	All you have to do is prove that they damaged the property.  Did you take photos?  Do you have bills or receipts from workmen who you employed to repair the damage?  Even if you repaired it yourself, you should have receipts from whatever supplies you purchased to fix the damage such as paint.<br>  <br>  I am not aware of how much the tenant is able to claim if you fail to put their deposit in a protection scheme, but hey, you broke the law by not doing it, so next time think about that first.|`|O71xlcG3aa	well first you need to take pictures of the damage that they caused.  did they sign a lease contract when they moved in?  if they did they have to comply with the conditions of it so bring that with you too.  if they stayed for three months then they should not get that money back.  thats all i got for you i don't know a whole lot about it but thats what i would do.  i would ask around to the people you know if they know anyone who can give you legal advise on the matter.<br>  good luck|`|7PbJWEo1aa	You didn't put the deposit in the Government Scheme?!?!? What were you thinking?!?! That is the Law I am afraid. You don't have a leg to stand on because you didn't put the deposit in the scheme. If you'd have done that, you could have kept it all.<br>  <br>  Hope you've learned your lesson.|`|eiJOdPgxaa	You need a solicitor. Failure to use the Tenancy Deposit Scheme is not good for starters, and if they damaged the property then you are entitled to hold back a portion of that deposit, but they are clearly claiming more than that.|`|AA10283947	On this occasion you have by-passed the road of good practise.<br>  <br>  However for next time why not photograph the room/s and have the tenant agree in the agreement as to the validity of the use of the photo's and the original room condition by signing the (claused) agreement which includes signing the photo's on the rear.<br>  Deposit these with a solicitor and do not repay the tenants deposit until all parties concerned are happy that the room condition is agreeable, i.e the tenant/s have fulfilled their written agreement with you.<br>  In the case of excess damage use the singned photographs to sue in a court of law.|`|F90xIfHNaa	Do you have an legal document of the lease?. If it is a six month or a twelve month contract, have they broken the contract?, by not giving notice?.<br>  Have you solid proof of the damages and the cost of repairs?. Have they paid you all of the rent? if not you are entitled to keep the bond.<br>  Have you got any character references for your tenants?, if they are bad people or have claimed before, find out?.<br>  Have the case delayed, it can take months to get to a small claims court if it is a scam, then it will stop them doing it to someone else, if they do it again you have grounds to either have the case dismissed or counter claim.<br>  How was the rent paid? housing benefit or did they have jobs?. If they are unemployed they can only get legal aid, get yourself a solicitor that deals with housing disputes, it will be worth the money!.<br>  One last thing if you are a scummy penny pinching landlord! I hope you get what you deserve!! and then some!.<br>  If not good luck and check up on the ppl you rent to next, and get a proper agreement drawn up and put the deposit in a government scheme.|`|X3PmWPUraa	This is obviously an English question - the ￡ sign sort of gives it away!  So, advice on American law is not much help.  If you did not protect the deposit you are screwed.  The judge will order you to pay back three times the deposit.  All you can do is to try and prove damages.  Next time do it properly - an expensive lesson to learn!!|`|ebae2bb97120c05a8385c8a1fc06cefbaa	Make up your mind wether you are a tenant/landlord/tenants firend?

You could be found not eligible for unemployment because the company offered you a spot but you had to turn it down due to your eyes.  If you can get medical proof that this condition did inhibit your ability to drive keeping you from the offered position, and the problem began while you were working at the job, and that you are available for something else if the spot is open, then you may get unemployment.  They may say that they offered, you declined.|`|nxEoR9CEaa	Yes you can file.  Will the company fight it?  My guess is yes they will.

Do you have someone who could act as Guarantor for you?<br>  <br>  Yes, so long as your other references come up clean (and the Guarantor's do as well) you should be ok with most rental agencies.

NwkZ5OmCaa	The property taxes clearly go on schedule A, no matter how many properties you own.<br>  <br>  If you have a main home only, this investment can squeak through as your second home and the mortgage interest can be put on schedule A.<br>  <br>  If your already have 2 homes and you need for the house to truly appear to be an investment property, you would have to report the interest expense on form 4952 and if you have no other investment income, you wouldn't be able to claim the interest this year (you would roll it forward to next year).<br>  <br>  The distinction between investment and 2nd home is important as well when you sell or convert to a rental.  If the property goes down in value, you can't take a loss on personal-use property.|`|AA11132354	Did you try to rent it out or not?<br>  If you had it available for rental and tried, then you treat it as rental property, although without income.|`|A2G9foewaa	Right now it is an investment property until you rent it out.  If you are paying mortgage interest it can be deducted as investment interest expense on schedule A.  If you pay any property taxes they can also be deducted.  Other than that nothing else can be taken until you sell it, or start treating it as a rental property.

23F70N1Raa	Auto mechanics does not require a college degree.  It requires that you go to a technical school.  I am unsure what is in your area but here in the NY and NJ area Lincoln Tech. is the big one.  This tech. degree program will offer you the certificates that you need to work in the field.<br>  <br>  Now, running your own company is something a bit different.  I would reccomend an associates (at minimum) or a BA in business.  This will give you the well rounded information that you will need to run a business properly.  A combo of the two is most likely what you will need.<br>  <br>  I then reccomend that you go to a tech school for auto mechanics (my husband is doing that right now!!) get your certificate and then start working in the field.  While you are working in the field, you can consider an online school for business (Try University of Phoenix Online).  Between the two you will be able to start up your own business.  However, consider that you will need some years in the field before you reallly know what you are doing.  So, don't drop your dreams of opening your own shop, just realize that it requires more than one degree/certificate and some years working at the bottom of the ladder.  I hope this helps!  Follow your dreams!

Calculating the formulas is a bit of a bear and you need to make sure you are talking about the right numbers to put into the formulas. Excel is widely used for regressions(linear). For the Data sets themselves on the Macro level go to the IMF website, the CIA "world book" has some figures for a lot of countries.

We don't know who you work for!!<br>  <br>  But it is true that most corporations are doing away with pensions. Pensions were around before 401Ks, and most employer now give matching to 401Ks as their main retirement benefit. Since a 401K serves the same purpose as pensions, these companies argue that the 401K is a replacement program instead of having two sources of retirement benefits, which is financially difficult for the company to maintain. <br>  <br>  It is a good arguement if you look at it from the perspective of an investor, and even if you are an employee, it is a bit unreasonable to EXPECT the company to fund two different forms of retirement on your behalf. If your company does fund both a pension and a 401K, then it is going to hurt your company's profitability, which will eventually come out of your paycheck anyway.<br>  <br>  Remember that retirement plans such as a 401K and pension are BENEFITS, the company is under no obligation and does not owe you such perks, they choose to provide them in order to attract the best and brightest employees. If your company has one or the other, consider yourself lucky!!|`|3b935648a282d2f42dde7ba4f5526790aa	Some do, some don't.

aE4hyVehaa	You are suppose to. By law, the answer is yes. How you handle it is your problem.<br>  <br>  The IRS lets your take deductions on your taxes for "work related expenses" to cover the other costs at the rate given below for driving.<br>  <br>  Most companies also have a company car or reimburse you for those expenses. You should probably talk to your manager about reimbursing you for your vehicle expenses at the standard IRS rate. Although that might be what your $1.25/delivery is for in which case you can still deduct that as a work related expense.<br>  <br>  For 2007, it's 48.5 cents per mile<br>  <a href="http://www.irs.gov/newsroom/article/0,,id=163828,00.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.irs.gov/newsroom/article/0,,i...</a>|`|d4662f5c12296e262f813ae70fab3b8faa	Yes.

AA12054896	Be very careful with this type of deal. Make sure that the contract states that it is a transaction of this type because if the owner gets sued or the government comes in, they can take the house and you get nothing. Also make sure that if you are late that the house doesn't automatically revert back to the owner and all you paid is just rent. I had a guy try this when I had tried to buy a house from him. If I was one day late all the money paid was rent and I got nothing at all, the repairs to the house were forfeit. Best advice get an attorney to read it and explain everything to you!<br>  It becomes more involved that a contract for land, or other contract because you tend to have more legal ground to stand on. Make sure the seller is putting all or most of your rent towards the property and not that they pocket it all.

2be4e21dfb076401aa5c1ab77fc88fecaa	First, do you have a resume highlighting your skills and abilities??  People have more than what they think.  <br>  Second, do you have volunteer work you can put down?  <br>  Third, in your last 2 jobs, did you help to increase the business in any way?  Any awards, acknowledgements, etc.??  <br>  Fourth, do you know what you want to be when you grow up??  (I'm not being sarcastic here--do you know what you want to do with the rest of your life??)  If you know what you want to do, then you will enjoy the work more, and it won't seem like a j-o-b.  <br>  If you can't answer these questions, this is what I would do.  <br>  1.  Get a resume made up, highlighting skills and abilities.  You can do this free of charge at your local One Stop--used to be unemployment offices (in Ohio).  <br>  2.  Volunteer work counts as employment, just not PAID employment.  It shows you aren't a slacker!<br>  3.  If you received "Employee of the Month" tell about it!!  YOU have to BRAG on your accomplishments, because noone is going to be behind you in an interview doing cheers for you--YOU have to toot your own horn!!  (Brag, but don't boast--there IS A difference.)  <br>  4.  If you aren't sure what you want to do for the next 30-40+ yrs of your life, then take an online personality/career assessment--you just type in "free online personality/career assessments" in the search bar.  Then take the assessment.  Usually, they will also give you job choices that match to your personality.  This will really help you out in the long run.<br>  5.  During the interview, definately show your enthusiasm for the job, and let them know you will give it your all.  Also ask for the job, most employers don't know if you really want the job or not.  (Just because you're in the interview, don't mean jack!)  If they hem and haw, offer them a deal to work for them for a week up to a month as a sub-contractor.  After the specified time, if they don't like you, you gotta go.<br>  6.  Ask them questions about the position, such as:  On a typical day, what are the duties that would need to be done??<br>  7.  If you don't feel secure in an interview setting, practice with a friend, or at the One Stop--most offer mock interviews to help you ace the real one.<br>  8.  Do your homework on the company.  Ask them questions about the company too!!<br>  9.  My personal favorite:  REMEMBER THE 4 C's!!!   They stand for:  CALM, COOL, COLLECTED, AND MOST IMPORTANT, CONFIDENT!!!  If your a fast learner, SAY SO!!<br>  10.  Once on the job, find a mentor.<br>  I hope this helps you out, if not, feel free to email/im me.  I'll help you.  (That is my job!!)<br>  Peace and Good Luck!!<br>  PS:  idoradwas has a good idea, but instead of offering your services for free, subcontract--after all the deal is the lifeblood of America.  And Sciencemo has some good points too!  Use them all!!  Again, good luck!!|`|e0af25a7a52f26cb654683cd39018a7faa	Without knowing the facts I can give a bit of advice.  Having two jobs does not necessary mean you can't hold a job.  It may show any future employer that you have staying power and are dedicated to your jobs (assuming you haven't been a job for just a few months.)  In an age where people come and go it is to the benefit of any company to hire a person such as yourself.<br>  <br>  It's all in first impressions. When you go on interviews you can get the job if you remember a few important things:<br>  <br>  1.  Dress for success.  I'm sorry, but I never hired people who walked in with baseball hats, sneakers, tee shirts (especially with stupid sayings and pictures on it), cleavage, gum and nails the size of lion claws.  If you dress for the part it conveys confidence, maturity and pride.<br>  <br>  2.  Speak for success - Smile, look the interviewer in the eyes and speak clearly with good English.  Don't mumble.  Enunciate your words, and don't say "like" alot!    <br>  <br>  Practice at home.  Pretend you are on an interview.  Ask yourself "what can I say that shows the person that despite my lack of experience I have all the stuff necessary to do the job?"  Experience does not necessary mean a person is the best for the job.  When someone impresses me I usually take a chance.  In the past, the people I hired were the people who sold themselves. <br>  <br>  Remember, many people come to interviews and do it wrong.... do it right and you will stand out and get the job!<br>  <br>  good luck!<br>  <br>  p.s. make sure you give a firm handshake, too!|`|4a2adc31caac58fe2cd8e6f289eb92feaa	Simple.<br>  <br>  Tell them you'll work for free for one week to prove yourself.<br>  <br>  That's something that any employer would take as proof of you abilities.|`|a9058b6672aa91ede2d4d292a9648374aa	You may also look out for an option to work online to make extra cash in your spare time.

Some options include...<br>  Babysitting, Rake leaves, Pet-sitting (during the holiday's is a great time because a lot of your neighbors may be going out of town and need somebody to look after their pets), If you live a area where it snows you can shovel the neighbors driveway and walkways, if you are good in a certain subject in school you may ask around sometimes parents would like a tutor for their smaller children who struggle in certain subjects at school, or ask your parents, grandparents, aunts, uncles if they have any extra chores or work you could do for them for extra money...<br>  <br>  A very good start to making money at 12-15 is just asking your neighbors (only if your parents say it is okay) if they have any extra work around the yard or house that you could do to earn a little extra money.    When I was 13, my next-door neighbor was an elderly lady who needed help with cleaning her house because she had a difficult time with some of the cleaning since she was getting older, but it was to expensive for her to hire a housekeeper.  A lot of children  around my neighborhood now ask if they can rake leaves or shovel snow because even if they have a groundskeeper, they usually don't come out just to rake the leaves and definitely not to shovel the snow.  Plus a lot of neighbors are nice and would love to help the kids in the neighborhood make some money and give them something productive to do with their time.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps you!  Good luck!|`|9889473867ad5a394112d25ec8ccc0c0aa	Babysitting or helping small children with school work and projects.|`|58a3f6fd60fd21053dc2524d12237900aa	I'd say babysitting...and also check to see what age they can get a work permit in your state.

Get as many lists as you possibly can i,e:phone books,  Drivers Lic, Street listings, Auto dealerships, any retail operation. high school year books, college year books, fishing lic and hunting lic. lists, anything you can think of.  2. arrange them alphabetically and by reason of list, age, area, sex. 3.  you'll need allot of names.  4 Go in person to auto dealerships, insurances, etc etc and sell you lists for X amount per name with a minimum purchase amount..5. Provide the names and address as purchased on peel off labels and deliver to company..6. Take out an add in the yellow pages, maybe the Internet, your local newspaper, personal letter to organizations and companies tell them what you got and offer them a deal to do business with you..7. You must always  7 days a week be looking to develop your lists to increase names etc etc for the various clients that you will be dealing with..It can work..it requires allot of work and you can make some serious money..Don't forget to put a bogus name and address in about ever 10 to 50 names to see if the company is using your list more than what you agreed to..In talking with clients explain they can mail only 2 times. After that they need to purchase updated list..if you should get more than 2 pc. of mail for the same bogus name  contact an attorney for breach of contract..Good Luck  good idea..|`|b5138a7657b3b5908bc39e3ee8c2735daa	Print more numbers of photos with famous cartoons,sports person,car&two wheelers,film stars.

The risk invovled is huge and you may lose everything if you're not careful. You can also start your own home business using the internet to attract customers. You may need help on creating a website with the proper verifications and handlin orders, but onces thats done, all you need is a product (which should really be thought of first). You can sell lots of stuff, if you get enough advertisement (art, candles, custom made computers). You can also get money from ads alone. Google ads can be added to almost any serious webpage on any topic. The more people click on the ads on ur page, the more money you'll get. This may not be enough to live on, but in addition to an internet based business, it can add a pretty handsome bonus to each month.|`|ae670ce23e2209b66197ed301aec6b00aa	try to get a job where you can stay at home and help your kids|`|b18251818d6570f1149bbbc3412f24bdaa	First of all, I just want to say that I really admire your desire to stay at home with your kids.

AA11819947	I doubt that there is a source for your answer.  The primary reason is that most small businesses are not sold.  It is their assets that are sold.  These assets include accounts receivable, inventory, fixed assets, intangible assets such as patents, trademarks, formulas, customer lists, company name, goodwill etc.   This is called as asset purchase by the acquiring company.  Of course, one could also buy the stock but most small businesses are not sold this way.  It is hugely to the advantage of the buyers to acquire by purchasing assets and it makes little difference to the sellers either way.<br>  <br>  So, the now empty corporate shell has cash from the sale.  It dissolves and the cash is distributed to the owners.  The old company just fades away and is no more.  Most states do not keep track of why businesses dissolve so the sale gets lumped into the gone and forgotten category along with business failures and the like.|`|6ea8cfbee758581707797673d8baa6f5aa	i think your Q has not really Answer!<br>  because there are many buisiness on the world...

Almost anybody you meet these days has some say or the other on one or the many malls they have visited. <br>  <br>  Just when you thought that you knew what malls were all about, there comes a revelation that knowing is just not enough, there is more. With malls opening everywhere, here are some observations:<br>  <br>  In the good old no-mall days, when visitors came, we used to take them to the beach for a walk by the sea or to a park or just entertain them at home with some good food and music, the idea being that they had come to spend time with us.<br>  <br>  But with malls opening up everywhere, that funda has changed and what we do now is we take them to the mall just to have a dekko. That we end up buying something or the other is a different story.<br>  <br>  When our relatives come to visit us on one of their rare visits from out of town, we take them to the mall, to show off that we live in a mall-ed city.<br>  <br>  When our kids crib, we take them to the mall so that they can climb up the escalators and touch and feel the tens of thousands of items littered all around the supermarket.<br>  <br>  When we need to buy a gift, but don’t know what to buy, we go to the mall so that out of the tens of thousands of things available there, we can select an appropriate gift. <br>  <br>  Some eye openers on visitors to a mall:<br>  ? They come in all sizes, shapes, attitudes, looks, and the likes.<br>  ? The single visitor is an extinct species.<br>  ? Visiting groups have a minimum of three or four people. Most people come with their aunties and uncles and their kids and their cousins.<br>  ? Uncles and aunties who can barely walk are omnipresent, ‘kakubais’ with their ‘nauwari kashtas’ or ‘bhaiyannis’ with their long ‘ghungats’ and two kids on each arm are regular customers.<br>  ? Even the ever the stiff upper lip, conservative Tambrams are present, of course, along with the shopping addicted Gujaratis and Punjabis.<br>  ? It’s an amazing cultural pot pourri.<br>  ? When you visit a mall that claims to be trendy, don’t expect a trendy crowd.<br>  ? Never visit a mall on a weekend or a day close to the weekend.<br>  ? Be prepared for shocks.<br>  ? You’ll find hundreds of thousands of people all over the mall. And if you manage to get inside a store in a mall, you are really lucky. Now, try your luck coming out.<br>  ? People throng malls like the world is coming to an end, and there isn’t going to be a tomorrow.<br>  ? The luggage trolley has become ubiquitous – be prepared to be hit in all places. The trolleys also lug kids and their pushy moms – I am no exception!<br>  <br>  On a serious note though: I don’t know what is the effect of the mall on the economy, except that the average salary earner is becoming poorer by the day (the usual result if you spend on items that you don’t need, but want just because they are there).<br>  <br>  But then there is a positive side to it, too. We can see more branded shops in one place than ever before. Then there’s the amazing architecture – some of the malls have wonderful interiors and themes, like, for example, Nirmal Lifestyle, which has the theme of the universe with planets hung up above. <br>  <br>  FMCG and durable goods companies have never had it so good – the touch-feel-experience the product concept has taken on a different meaning altogether, what with events taking place inside the mall for which they get a captive TG.<br>  <br>  And, yes, in this sweltering heat; when you keep wishing the roads could be air conditioned, all you have to do is visit a mall to cool down. <br>  <br>  That you will be nudged and pushed and have to share the air conditioning with a sea of people is just part of the package, I guess.

Diariamente miles de millones de Dólares son negociados en diferentes monedas en todo el mundo. <br>  <br>  Se estima que el volumen promedio operado por la más grande Bolsa de Valores del mundo que es la Bolsa de New York, en un mes completo, es igual al volumen que se negocia en un solo día en el mercado Forex. Además se estima que este volumen se incrementa un 30% anualmente.<br>  <br>  A diferencia de otros mercados financieros, el FOREX no tiene un centro de contratación si no que se opera directamente a través de Bancos, Dealers y Market Makers (Creadores de Mercado).<br>  <br>  Hasta hace poco tiempo, el Mercado Electrónico de Divisas era operado exclusivamente por grandes Bancos e Instituciones Financieras. Para un inversor individual era muy difícil entrar a este Mercado a causa del gran capital que se requería para operar en él.<br>  <br>  Hoy gracias a los creadores de mercado como E-GoldDailyPro (EGDP), un inversor puede invertir tranquilamente desde una peque?a cantidad de dinero y acceder a los enormes beneficios del mercado más grande del mundo.<br>  <br>  EGDP ha nacido para revolucionar las inversiones y los negocios por Internet y es por eso que a nuestros inversores les ofrecemos todavía más posibilidades de ganar extraordinarias cantidades de dinero y aquí es donde tú puedes sacarle partido a nuestro negocio de forma directa.<br>  <br>  Observa atentamente los siguientes datos porque son muy significativos.<br>  <br>  ?Con E-GoldDailyPro se puede entrar en el mercado mas grande del mundo como inversor a partir de 20 dólares, sí como lo estás leyendo, 20 dólares (USD).<br>  ?Podrá acceder a uno de los dos planes de Inversión que ofrece EGDP, Standard y Súper Promotor.<br>  ?El tipo de interés diario que ganará todo inversor es del 1,1% diario, o lo que es lo mismo, el 33% mensual en el plan Standard.<br>  ?El tipo de interés mensual que ganará todo inversor en el plan Súper Promotor es del 1.5% diario o lo que es lo mismo, el 45% mensual.<br>  ?A diferencia de lo que sucede con los demás Creadores de Mercado que operan en FOREX, los depósitos de capital NO CADUCAN NUNCA.<br>  ?El capital invertido está nuevamente a disposición del inversor a los seis meses sin penalizaciones, comisiones o gastos.<br>  ?Si desea disponer del capital invertido antes de los 6 meses podrá hacerlo en el momento que desee pero se le cobrará una comisión de penalización del 15%.<br>  ?Pasado el plazo de 6 meses el capital continuará afecto al plan al que el inversor se haya suscrito hasta que el mismo decida retirar su capital.<br>  ?El inversor podrá retirar o reinvertir sus ganancias cada 30 días a partir de unos beneficios de 20$ (Cash-Out)<br>  <br>  Voy a ponerte un ejemplo de lo que ganará un inversor por un depósito digamos de 250 US $ al cabo de 6 meses reinvirtiendo tus ganancias…<br>  <br>   <br>  MESESIMPORTESBENEFICIOS<br>  1o  250 X 33%

no se puede obtener en un Banco, en los cuales incluso depositando importantes sumas de dinero no se consigue más allá de un 5% ANUAL en el mejor de los casos.<br>  <br>  Ahora observa bien nuestro plan de compensación porque si los porcentajes de ganancias por inversiones te han parecido buenos, nuestro plan de carrera para inversores es si cabe más impresionante.<br>  <br>  EGDP maneja además dos planes de Inversiones, un plan Standard y un plan Súper Promotor los cuales te va a dar las siguientes comisiones por inversores referidos:<br>  <br>  <br>  Plan Standard al que acceden todos los inversores cuyo depósito de inversión está comprendido entre 20 y 2499 dólares.<br>  <br>  Nivel 1: 10% del importe de cada inversión realizada  por cada referido directo<br>  Nivel 2:   5% del importe de cada inversión realizada  por cada referido de tus referidos<br>  <br>  Plan Súper Promotores al que acceden aquellos inversores que realizan un depósito de inversión comprendido entre 2500 y 10000 dólares americanos.<br>  <br>  Nivel 1: 10% del importe de cada inversión realizada por cada referido directo<br>  Nivel 2: 10% del importe de cada inversión realizada por los referidos de tus referidos directos<br>  Nivel 3: 10% del importe de cada inversión realizada por los referidos de los referidos de los referidos directos.<br>  Nivel 4: 10% Idem…<br>  <br>  Bien, este proceso es infinito, no existe límite de referidos directos que tu puedas hacer y lo mismo para tus referidos, es decir, no existe límite de referidos por nivel.<br>  <br>  Para acceder a esto tienes dos opciones…<br>  <br>  OPCIóN No1<br>  <br>  -Hacer un depósito de inversión abriendo una cuenta en EGDP a partir de 20 U$S en <a href="http://e-golddailypro.biz/?ref=3486" rel="nofollow">http://e-golddailypro.biz/?ref=3486</a><br>  <br>  OPCIóN No 2<br>  <br>  -Registrarte como usuario GRATIS también en <a href="http://e-golddailypro.biz/?ref=3486" rel="nofollow">http://e-golddailypro.biz/?ref=3486</a>  <br>  <br>    <br>  Registrarse como usuario libre o gratis, quiere decir que no tienes que hacer ningún depósito de dinero, pero, como la condición para acceder al plan de compensación es que seas uno de nuestros inversores, tendrás un período de 15 días para conseguir uno o varios referidos que te reporten una comisión mínima de 20 US $.<br>  Es muy sencillo, solo con que consigas una persona que haga un depósito de inversión por importe de 200 U$S  o 4 referidos que inviertan 50 U$S cada uno, se te acreditarán las comisiones pertinentes en un depósito de inversión igual que los demás, el cual comenzará a producir beneficios del 33% mensual desde el momento en que tus referidos hayan depositado su dinero en su cuenta.<br>  <br>  Como usuario libre tendrás un plazo de 15 días para conseguir acreditar en tu cuenta las comisiones necesarias (20 US $) para que las mismas te permitan seguir trabajando con nosotros con el Status de Promotor con los beneficios y prerrogativas que ello comporta.<br>  Una vez finalizado el período de 15 días desde tu inscripción, si no has alcanzado el mínimo de comisiones la cuenta será cancelada automáticamente sin más.<br>  <br>  Decirte que lo ideal para cualquier Súper Promotor es que se comprometa mínimamente para ganar buen dinero con nosotros cada mes haciendo más y más grande su cartera de referidos directos.<br>  Tú mismo puedes hacer un cálculo y verás que te está esperando mucho dinero si sabes aprovecharte de esta oportunidad.<br>  <br>  Si decides unirte a este proyecto (para el cual, ya ves no se necesita gran cosa sólo ganas de triunfar), podrás trabajar on-line (con tu ordenador y conexión a Internet) y por supuesto off-line, hablando con todo el mundo y recomendando este impresionante servicio a tus familiares, amigos, vecinos… en definitiva, a todo el mundo.<br>  <br>  No estarás solo, porque tenemos todo lo que necesitas para trabajar pues la empresa nos proporciona, gratis, una página Web en principio en espa?ol e ingles y nos ofrece todo el apoyo necesario, incondicionalmente. Además la empresa cuenta con un servicio de soporte que estará siempre a tu disposición para orientarte acerca de cómo gestionar mejor el negocio; para aclararte las dudas que tengas; y para ayudarte en lo que sea preciso. <br>  Pondremos a tu entera disposición herramientas de marketing y promoción, por ejemplo anuncios, explicaciones como ésta, cómo realizar el trabajo y muchas otras cosas.<br>  <br>  Si de veras te interesa esta propuesta y tienes todavía preguntas que formular, estaré encantado de contestar aquello que necesites saber.

Mientras que los a?os anteriores muchos Géminis han sufrido divorcios, separaciones, discusiones de pareja etc., este a?o se plantea de forma mucho más positivo con grandes mejoras en el terreno sentimental. Las difíciles experiencias de los últimos a?os te ayudarán en futuras relaciones. <br>  <br>  Los Géminis solteros encontrarán pareja y es posible que se enamoren locamente. Los que sí tienen pareja o lograrán afianzarla con nuevos niveles de compromiso y estabilidad, o tal vez decidan que nunca va a funcionar su relación y la terminen para buscar una relación nueva y mejor. Sigue tu intuición porque este a?o tienes todo a tu favor.<br>  <br>   <br>  Dinero y trabajo Géminis 2007 <br>  El flujo de dinero será constante pero debes estudiar las opciones de inversión con mucho cuidado antes de invertir. Si no estás segur@ cómo y cuánto invertir, consulta con un experto porque merece la pena asegurarte. Los mejores meses para asuntos económicos son los meses de mayo y agosto y los peores de enero a abril.<br>  <br>  En el mundo laboral, se abrirán nuevas oportunidades aunque es posible que experimentes algún problema con otros compa?eros debido a un problema de comunicación. Los géminis tienen grandes habilidades comunicativas y tendrás que recurrir a ellas para salir de una situación incómoda. Durante el a?o 2007 los Géminis experimentarán cambios en su vida profesional que pueden suponer viajes de negocio, una promoción, una subida salarial o incluso un cambio radical de trabajo. Serán cambios positivos, sobre todo durante la segunda mitad del a?o. <br>  <br>   <br>  Otras predicciones para Géminis 2007 <br>  Las predicciones generales para los Géminis durante 2007 son positivos, sobre todo durante la segunda mitad del a?o. Mientras que 2006 fue un a?o problemático, este a?o será uno de crecimiento, progreso y nuevas posibilidades.<br>  <br>  2007 será un a?o de viajes para los Géminis, bien por placer o bien por motivos profesionales, sobre todo viajes cortos al extranjero. <br>  <br>  Físicamente los Géminis se encontrarán mejor que durante 2006 y su época de mayor fuerza física será el mes de septiembre. En cuanto a temas relacionados con salud, las zonas que tienen que vigilar son corazón, intestino, tiroides, ri?ones y trastornos causados por el estrés.|`|b21e9b1d0adf65030d3a1950a5b633a8aa	cosas malas...cuidate mucho......saludes|`|ff9861a5bc25c6d6b7c6ac42e621098faa	LAS CLAVES DEL 2007 PARA GéMINIS: El último a?o te expusiste al máximo las 24 horas del día.

3b0ea9b8fa9f7cf6d538cf6cce996051aa	Use what you have available and will be comfortable using. One supervisor and a couple peers will suffice for most situations. Almost all. (References provided as application documentation are not worth much. Your credit report is more important, as that is the de facto "background check".)<br>  <br>  If someone wants more than one supervisor or something else that you cannot (or do not want to ) provide, I wouldn't let it bother you. It will more than likely be the exception. So tell them what you are willing to provide and if they don't like it, you don't have a match. Time to move on. (I don't really see this happening.)<br>  <br>  Remember that every candidate with 20 years of experience has some reason to be looking for a job. If they were in a situation that was perfect, they would not be available to prospective employers. You have what you have, move forward with confidence and you will be fine.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|cc3820a15b7c09ec25ef5a6c571f58b7aa	just make sure who ever you list is a good spelar.<br>  <br>  They wont ask for just people you have worked for .... they will ask for your supervisor or whom ever can give you a reference.  Then you will also be able to list personal references.|`|6787199a941d7d5b7eb2a4dd8919de97aa	Usually a job application will ask for 3 character references in addition to your employment reference.

I would suggest notifying the people that you are using for references so they are prepared for the call.

It has worked for me, my family, and friends.<br>  <br>  If you have a computer and the internet (and an e-mail account), that's all you need to make money at this website I found. It's completely legitimate. They are an American company, but residents from all countries are welcome.<br>   <br>  This website is the ONLY website I've found so far that actually pays you money for doing very little work.<br>  All you do is fill out simple surveys and sign up for websites.<br>  All you need is a valid address where they can send your monthly cheque.<br>  I've only been with this program for a few months, but I already know that it works. I have received numerous cheques from them totalling well over $800.<br>  I only spend a few hours on the site a month. This means that I earned about $20/hr for doing next to nothing. This IS a legitimate website with thousands of users who are earning money as well.<br>   <br>  The reason I'm posting this is because I have an opportunity to earn even more money. If you sign up for the site and start earning money, I earn an additional 20% of whatever you made.<br>   <br>  So here's the link, give it a try. What do you have to lose, you don't have to put in your credit card information or anything.

I have just started so my income intake is not very high but hey it gives you few extra hundred a month for doing practically nothing. They send a check every 20 days. You need a minimum of $5.00 to get a check on cashcrate and $20.00 on treasure trooper. It's also free to sign up. Email me with any questions you have.

Go see what the prices are, ask the sellers how they are selling.

I used to make and sell jewelery, and I can tell you that having to absorb all the upfront costs and then try and collect can be a long and tedious process.  I don't do it anymore.  My stuff sold well, but I had to have too much tied up in inventory and when stores didn't pay me, it caused me financial hardship.|`|2AmAFf8vaa	You should check out this forum it has useful information for you <br>  <a href="http://www.work-at-home-forum.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.work-at-home-forum.org</a> <br>  i hope this information is useful to you
