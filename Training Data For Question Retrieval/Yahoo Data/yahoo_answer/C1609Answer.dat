See see below for visa info on-line.|`|zVgWleBaaa	You should contact the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services to obtain that information
AA11589437	Avoid the area around Omonoia square.<br>  Try Plaka, Syntagma, Koukaki, Makrygianni, Thiseio. Basically the areas near metro stations Acropolis, Syntagma, Syngrou Fix, Thiseio.|`|QoVL5cDHaa	Athens is normally one of the safer cities, but I don't know if the recent riots have affected things. If you stay in the city centre you should be safe, and there is a vast choice of nearby restaurants, especially around the Plaka. The centre of Athens is quite compact. Everything is in walking distance, and you can't get lost for any length of time, as all roads lead to views of the Parthenon.<br>  When my daughter was doing her Classical Civilisations 'A' level, I took her over there twice. The first time we went was in June/July, and was it hot! The second time was in February with the dark nights. We felt safe on both visits, and found the Greek people love the British, they are still grateful for what we did for them in World War 2.|`|2724e8c32a9de71dca3f16697d9d6ebbaa	I studied in Greece for half a year.  I stayed in the apartments on Likavitos with my roommate.  That seemed pretty safe. We always went out together.  During the day I did travel some by myself.  Everybody is generally friendly, and it is generally safe.  You will have to keep in mind, though, if you are American girls you will be hit on all the time especially by the Turks but also by the Greeks.|`|AA10421518	PLAKA is very close to the center, and it's a fun neighborhood with lots to see and do.  That would be my suggestion.  <br>  <br>  Do not stay in Omonia Square.... it's not the safest place.  Many unsavory characters hang out there.|`|fafd36bfe7e438c0ce232689c8a5a135aa	not available in Athens unless you are in the suburbs or with locals|`|FQC97becaa	I found the area around Plaka to be the most vibrant and safe.<br>  There are many hotels there, the one we stayed and liked was named "Plaka" too.<br>  Of course it goes without saying, no matter where you go, if you are looking for trouble, trouble will find you.<br>  Play it safe and use  common sense
AA10310496	Yes, there is a small graveyard at Castle Combe, it is in the grounds of the Church of St. Andrews.  I have never heard the woods referred to anything other than the woods!  maybe a local person could tell you differently.<br>  <br>  Used to live at Bath and went to Castle Combe often.
63e6fbd5b85357a27d660c7d5c0b9ee9aa	no many hotels now require that the person reserving the room stay in the room.. also if there was any damage the card holder would be responsable for repairs.. andalsoo if you want extra in your room more than likely the other would be complaing  of the noise.. once the clerks saw you and your friends come in they will ask for ids and if no one is over 25 forget about renting a room|`|FXPTeTcPaa	No. The adult, and holder of the credit card must stay in the room. They will verify the credit card and identity of the person during check in and out. <br>  <br>  Edit: Even if you pay for the room online, they will still ask to see the credit card and identity info on check in and check out.

That's sign #1<br>  Then the sap in the sugar bushes starts running in March. This requires cool to cold nights and warming days for maple syrup production. This is definitely a precursor to spring. <br>  The second Sunday in May is Blossom Sunday in the Niagara Peninsula so they're free of snow. Most other trees are in bud or budding.<br>  Victoria Day (May 24) is usually the date we feel it possible to think of establishing our gardens as it should be frost free.

Y entre los inolvidables monumentos y detalles turísticos de cada ciudad el viajero se encontrará ante un paisaje verdaderamente rico por su variedad, marcado por rocas, alcornoques, olivas... y todo bajo un cielo casi siempre azul y con sol. Y en esta vastedad están distribuidos pueblos blancos, parques naturales, ruinas romanas y mucho más que espera a ser visitado por el turista.<br>  <br>  Así pues, sobran las razones para hacer un viaje al extremo sur de la Península Ibérica (y europeo). <br>  <br>  Y por si eso no fuera suficiente Andalucía cuenta con cientos de kilómetros de costa con las playas más bonitas de Espa?a y, la verdad es que ésa es la atracción más grande de esta región. La Costa de la Luz y la Costa de Sol forman las zonas turísticas más importantes de Andalucía. Pero mientras la Costa del Sol ya ha sufrido muchísimos cambios y un cuarto ha sido invadido por hoteles y urbanizaciones, la Costa de la Luz todavía mantiene su atmósfera original y nos da la impresión de un turismo más suave. Y entre estas dos grandes Costas (Costa del Sol y Costa de la Luz) se encuentra la ciudad más al sur de Europa ?    Tarifa.|`|SDHvDNGJaa	No se de toda Espa?a, pero para mi Sevilla es una región bastante bella e interesante.<br>  Saludos!|`|ra5IbnXYaa	Para mi que he conocido Espa?a, el lugar mas lindo es Andalucia.

MsCm6t3qaa	Estar embarazada no es un mal ejemplo, mas bien es un buen ejemplo de lo que puede suceder si se deja fluír libremente la vida. Hay que explicarle a las ni?as cuáles son los métodos anticonceptivos y el uso del condón desde temprana edad.

No dejes ir esta oportunidad.<br>  No es necesario que te muestres compasiva o que hagas juicios.

No entres en cuestiones de valores pues entonces quizá sí que confundas a tu ni?a.|`|a865b7450bcfa6924b41939ba8ea3352aa	no creo que sea mal ejemplo, al contrario, a veces es necesario vivir las cosas muy de cerca para darse cuenta de como son en realidad, simplemente es la realidad que se vive en tu entorno y si se vale que tu hija se de cuenta de como son las cosas, de todo lo que su vecina se perdera, de todas las responsabilidades que desde ahora lleva a cuestas.<br>  un abrazo|`|c44a58bfe31203c03fc40703ac1a5c4eaa	No solo se vale komo ejemplo... tu vecinita (vecinititititititta) Es el ejemplo vivo y a todho kolor de las koncekuencias ke tiene la kalenThura de kabeza (y otras kosillas) y la falTha de prevencion.

This means you are not limited to staying near the airport, you can go anywhere. To give you an idea of time..its takes about 45mins to get from Heathrow to Kings Cross/St Pancreas station ( which is the northern train station) and thats crossing quite a bit of London, so its pretty good really. I only stayed a couple of nights in London..one I wanted near a tube station as when I first arrived I had to lug 3 large bags all over the underground ( and there seems to be a lack of escalators and lifts..just steps!)  so don't pack TOO much!<br>  Mind you if you get a day pass you can go on both tube and bus ( and even train if you are going somewhere out of London).|`|KouAsdpyaa	www.laterooms.co.uk is a good source of hotels in London.<br>  <br>  They offer good rates for late bookings and you can always find somewhere on the day.<br>  <br>  NB - Heathrow is a good way out of London - I would recommend Heathrow Hotels for the night before your flight if flying early, otherwise if you are wanting to do London stay in London.|`|49f80f254c9a13d56cc1097e04b35aa7aa	There are lots of hotels, around heathrow, Just put Heathrow Hotels in your browser, most have transport to/from the airport|`|qy8TwuQoaa	Check out <a href="http://www.taxifarefinder.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.taxifarefinder.com</a> for the taxi prices.

Cold in the South Island & Taranaki & the Waikato region of the North Island.  Not so cold in the rest of the North Island but it is a damp cold due to all the rain, rather than a dry cold.  Wellington is cold with a horrible chilling constant wind.<br>  <br>  It's interesting as at 10 degrees celcius here it can feel really cold as it's a damp cold, but when I was in Canada in zero temperatures it actually didn't feel any colder than NZ as they had a dry cold.  If that makes sense....<br>  <br>  It's worth seeing the picture postcard snow areas in Winter here like Taranaki & Queenstown & other parts of the South Island but the rest of the country is all rain & you're better off seeing those parts in summer.|`|AA11441385	It depends where you are.

AA10956234	I'm really so shocked by the 4 thumbs down for moonrise, she didn't say something wrong, in fact her answer is totally right, and that's was in the past, <br>  <br>  Abt your question, That's not common this days in Egypt at all, in all social levels, <br>  <br>  In the past, and bcoz families were more united and you can find Aunts, cousins, ..etc all in one big house, so when the mum is not in the house and lets say the baby needs milk, then her sister or her cousin, ..etc any member from the family (close one) can breast feed the baby until the mum comes home, and that's was not in daily basis lol, maybe once or twice, <br>  <br>  Also as moonrise said, in the past in some of the rich families they were bringing a woman for breast feed the baby, <br>  <br>  NOW, this days in Egypt, I noticed in some families I know, If the mum will go out or will leave the baby with her mum, she give her mum some milk in a bottle for the baby, sometimes its her natural milk, sometimes it's powder milk (which is not healthy as mum's milk) and sometimes its other natural source.<br>  <br>  btw, Prophet Mohamed (salah Allah 3alyeh wa salam) was born and lived all his life in KSA, it's different culture and different people and different traditions, I'm just saying that to not compare between Egypt and Saudi Arabia weather or way of living. there is a different between culture & religion, you can see Egyptian Muslims are not the same as Saudi Muslims and are not the same as Malaysian Muslims,|`|5Zi1uaEYaa	in past it was tradition or compliment to mother to breast fed her cousin son or daughter you know was compliment and in some high class family just an excuse to let the mother go out and about they consider it sign of reach sick minds betw. but now its not wide as b4 cause there is baby's milk now and bottles and any one can buy it|`|9VevsfLxaa	I think it used to be, but not any more. <br>  This is an option that can be resorted to when the mother is too sick to breast-feed. <br>  Personally, I think it is wrong.

But then I was talking to my mother about it and she said that it happened before in her country if for example the child is an orphan or any other time when the mother is not around for whatever reason.  Does this not happen in Lebanon?|`|DoaMYpfMaa	it is normal in many places.  my husband was breastfeed by his uncles mom but now instead of having 1 sister and 4 brothers he has 4 sisters and too many brothers!!!!! i mean there is nothing wrong when they breastfeed from someone else.  it is common.|`|hhhk499qaa	Well yeah it is.|`|ravzJTVOaa	it used to happen a lot in the countryside .<br>  this was a problem when the little ones grew up and were told they were sisters in breast feeding .<br>  it also happened in rich families .<br>  a surrogate mother was hired in the house .<br>  she lived with her own child in the house , or she went to the house to breast feed the baby then go home at night .<br>  she was well fed so as to be able to feed the baby and her child .<br>  our Prophet 's mother died , so he was breast fed by a surrogate breast feeding source .<br>  that's why Mohamed urges us to be kind to orphans .

fZjgIE9Baa	That is strange. Once on a flight from Los Angeles to Seattle, I was sitting right in front of an old friend of mine who used to live next to me. We hadn't talked in 14 years until then. He was currently living on the other side of the country, and happened to have a connecting flight from LAX to Seattle, the same flight I had.|`|1bTYCUDkaa	Yes, but not on the airplane, but in the airport, and on land.  I was once dropping of my grandparents at the airport, and saw someone from my grade there too.  And, I was traveling to Florida, and my teacher was at the airport too.  When I was in Florida, I saw someone in Universal Studios, from my grade, and the same school.  They were eating lunch at the same restaurant we were, and at the same time.  And when I was in Hollywood, visiting USC, my neighbor was taking the tour as well, on the same day! We had no idea she was there too.  We were all the way from Maryland, so it was a big deal.  <br>  <br>  Everything happens for a reason.

48f05733ad5213c40c6efa92aa9ee2c0aa	To accurately answer your question, since I have been in both NYC and Wash DC this time of year; Washington is typically about 10 F warmer at this time of year.<br>  <br>  But, as others have correctly pointed-out, there are many weather variables to consider.  Sometimes the cold front move down from Canada, go across the plains states and then head toward Maryland, Virginia and Deleware...barely missing New York.  Other times, lake effect snow will come down from Canada, hit Buffalo and Rochester and move down into New York City and either head out to sea or swoop back up the coast toward Maine.<br>  <br>  In the winters, Washington DC weather usually comes from the plains states.  Again, it comes down from Canada first and either goes across Kansas, Iowa, Illinois, and then heads east through Ohio, Pennsylvania and West Virginia.<br>  <br>  In the summers, Wash DC weather comes from the south, along the atlantic coast.  Starts down near the Bahamas and flows north to Florida, Georgia, the Carolinas and continues northward here to DC and then further north to New York and finally Maine and Newfoundland.  (Check-out the way most hurricanes run up the coast in the summers and that's where the weather is coming from in the summers.)|`|AnNVvu3raa	washinton is 40<br>  Manhattan is 42, NYC is warmer|`|4i59X44Laa	Washington DC is about 204 miles south of New York, so most of the time it will be slightly warmer.

Please pick an answer as best answer, even if it is not mine.|`|5AbCtkWFaa	DC, as a rule, tends to be warmer than NYC, but of course, there are variables from day to day, depending on weather patterns.<br>  <br>  If you want to do a right-now comparison, why not go to weather.com?|`|5VXm2Cc8aa	washington is warmer it's a 20 degree difference|`|c63c1a8a3f313613d03647643c55dd58aa	NYC currently....3 PM EST|`|pII9EGPnaa	Washington is warmer for now, but as with all weather patterns either city can be warmer, colder, or the same.

Apparently you'll have to attend at ports of call.

They can not discriminate against people by having a catholic church because not everyone is catholic.  Sea Princess usually holds a service for all on the Sundays that they are at sea.  It is just prayers, songs and readings.|`|CpJnhy1saa	No, sorry, the Monarch does not have any chapel for any denomination.

JoC6dlASaa	Australia has a much smaller population than Australia: 22 million in AUS, 300 million in America. <br>  Australia's coastline is essentially the only area that can sustain people living since the middle of Australia is dessert, unlike the US which has cities and towns throughout.<br>  Australia is still part of the Queen's commonwealth of England and America is an independent Republic.<br>  Australia has many more government sponsored programs such as national health care than America, therefore the people expect the government to help them out more than people in America.<br>  Australia has less competitive business models ( ie: Coles and Woolies only ) than in America which helps to keep prices down ( in the US ) in the grocery store.<br>  Australia has higher wages in the service and retail industries than in America partly due to the " no tipping ' rule in Australia which is also why in my opinion service is really bad in most pubs and restaurants.<br>  America is 78% white and Christian, Australia is 92% white and Christian but overall Australians are less religious than Americans.<br>  America had a much much higher population of Jewish people than Australia.<br>  Men in Australia are shorter than the men in America.<br>  There is no mail delivery on Saturday in Australia and the postpeople do not pick up mail from your house.<br>  The Australian school year is from late January to mid December whereas the American school year is from early September to mid-June. Australian schools do not have yellow school buses.<br>  The seasons are opposite.<br>  Other than Melbourne, shops ( stores ) close at 5pm on weekdays whereas shops in the US usually stay open until 9pm.<br>  Australians get Boxing Day as a public holiday, they don't in the US.<br>  There is no tipping in Australia.<br>  Australians suffer from "Tall Poppy Syndrome" which means they put down people who are successful. This syndrome does not exist in the US.<br>  Australians consume more beer, chocolate and ice cream per capita than the Americans.<br>  Australia drives on the left side of the road, Americans on the right side.<br>  Australia has a higher incident of skin cancers than in America.<br>  In Australia when you go to a party, you bring your own beverages to drink (and in some cases, your own food), in America, your hosts ( who are having the party) supply all food and beverages.<br>  Australia has ute's, the US does not. They used too but they stopped making them.<br>  In Australia, it is compulsory to vote and you get fined if you do not vote. In America, it is not compulsory to vote.<br>  Highway lanes ( Motorway Lanes ) are slightly narrower in Australia than in America.<br>  IMHO, high schools pretty much have the same academic standard, but US high schools have more spirit and pride in their schools. The whole cheerleader,sports ,clubs and band experience isn't as intense in Australia. Also,you may leave school at 15 yrs of age if you want too and that is acceptable. In Australia, you do wear a uniform all the way through highschool in both the public ( state ) and private schools.<br>  In Australia, Elementary and high schools are called " colleges" and college as we know it in the US, is " university" or shortened ' uni "|`|90tPT5nlaa	Truthful's answer is excellent, but I would add that there is gun control in Australia and there is a much lower rate of violent crime.<br>  <br>  Also, Australia is not 92% Christian.

UP in Canada we had a comparable cereal  called Muffets.|`|aqLLbzJQaa	Weatabix is nothing like shredded wheat.   It is a breakfast cereal shaped like a biscuit about 2-1/2 inches by 1-1/2 inches by about 1/2 inch - but much more dense than shredded wheat made from flat flakes of wheat compressed together.<br>  <br>  Of the two cereals I much prefer Weatabix with cold milk on for breakfast.<br>  <br>  ...|`|iiOW0CNqaa	yeah same sort of size as shredded wheat. and yeah is also a breakfast cereal. however the two don't taste similar at all. hard to explain the taste...but they're good! try it!lol

tGjI8syRaa	How much money you need for the safari really depends on where you are staying (luxury, lodge, or camping) and which park you are visiting--let me know and I can answer that.<br>  <br>  Temperature in Mombasa at that time will range from 70-90 degress with high humidity.  Weather in July should be sunny with 9+hrs of sunlight per day.<br>  <br>  For the crew on safari you should tip each of them about $5 USD per day or something between 2000 and 3000 shillings for a 4 day safari each.|`|RILZcr6Daa	If you are paying in Kenya shillings which is the best since its weak against the dollar currently you will need around $2500-3,000 for the safari and ten days in  Mombasa

94b8KImYaa	Unless you are planning a trip in the Gulf of Aden, or the Malakka straights, you can tell your mom, that pirates are not in the Caribbean. (As nice as it might would be, if Johnny Depp would be showing up - lol)<br>  <br>  Maybe you can convince her, that this will be a great vacation. She needs to unpack and pack only once, she can have her laundry done onboard the ship (for a fee) but could come home with clean clothes - ready to be put in the closest. <br>  She will have wonderful food, not need to worry about something and will have a Spa, a Hairdresser, a casino, shops, the gym, a pool, bars and restaurants and shows and entertainment all within walking distance of about 10 minutes. <br>  She only needs to carry her carry-on to her room - the heavy luggage will be delivered to her cabin and picked up at the end of the cruise. <br>  She will be pampered. <br>  She will have tons of possibilities on what she can do - and all she has to do is show up. <br>  <br>  The bigger the ship, the less will she feel like she is on a ship. <br>  For a cabin, choose one in the center of the ship length wise and height wise. (And look at the Deck plan, so the cabin is not next to Elevator landings and not under the restaurant or theater. <br>  In this you need to do a little homework and have your arguments ready why this cabin is good. <br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|Ib5XecOiaa	Have her see a psychiatrist.

(We have to fly to get to the west coast).  <br>  <br>  We checked out a video on Alaska cruises at the library and found it informative and fun as well.<br>  <br>  Also, check your local tv listings on cable.  At least once every 2-3 months on a Saturday they will show cruising shows back-to-back for like 4-6 hours.  Different cruise lines or different excursions or different destinations or life aboard a cruise ship.   They usually appear on the Travel Channel.<br>  <br>  As for the kidnapping, where does she think she will be kidnapped from?   Traveling to the Caribbean (western, eastern or southern) is safe.  The islands and the countries rely too heavily on tourist $$$ to have it be any other way.<br>  <br>  Also, have your mom check out a Disney Cruise.  They are safe and are centered around families and activities that are geared for families. <br>  <br>  You say that you have the money.  Most kids think their parents have money to do everything.  But cruises, just like other travel, can be expensive.  Tell your mother that you can sail for as little as 3 days and then return home.  That might fit her schedule and her budget better than a 7 day cruise.  <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|AA10144812	One suggestion is show her Royal Caribbean Ships.

Start by finding cruises that depart from some place that you don't have to fly to. you don't want to have to convince of too much.  If you have access to a local ferry start with that, that's how I won my mother over when I was a teenager and she must have a cruise once a year. Also start with some place she'd like and cruise line that would cater to her taste, I know people will get tired of hearing this from me but Royal Caribbean is the absolute BEST, you can never go wrong with fare rates, atmosphere and I've done both Carnival and Royal Caribbean and Carnival was so aweful I wouldn't cruise them if someone gave it to me for free.

nF9DZ0sOaa	The area around Schlitterbahn has a lot of resort-type condos.  Most of the hotels in New Braunfels tend to be along Interstate 35.  But bear in mind, New Braunfels isn't all that big a town.  From I-35 to Schlitterbahn is maybe 5 minutes, if that!  If you go to the Schlitterbahn New Braunfels website, they include links to the resorts.  Otherwise, Expedia or Travelocity will direct you to the hotels.  Another great option is Gruene, which is right on the edge of New Braunfels.  There are a couple of big tubing areas in Gruene, and a lot of bed & breakfast resorts.<br>  <br>  Bear this in mind...this area of central Texas has been in extreme drought conditions since Fall 2007.  The rivers are horribly low, and you will certainly want to check river conditions before planning a tubing trip to the area.

Of course this costs extra, you wouldn't get it at the regular ticket price.|`|1bTYCUDkaa	They really do not specify, but I would assume bronchitis, or some very bad, contagious illness.  But, airlines do not like very pregnant women to fly.
4cWtH7X2aa	Canada is a great place to live, and it's ok if you don't like hockey...we'll forgive ya on that one ;) As for immigration I suggest you get in contact with the Canadian consulate where you live. There are people there that specialize in relocation and can help you with all the paperwork.|`|XLQ9wCUaaa	Canada is nice. <br>  <br>  Of course they don't want to live in the USA though (laughs) - part of their national identity is hating Americans or at the very least considering themselves superior to Americans. <br>  <br>  Canada is more mellow than the USA though - everybody doesn't tote guns here. There's healthcare, which if Americans ever got their hands on they would wonder why they didn't demand it sooner. The cops aren't as maniacal and don't have as much power as the American cops and I don't feel like I'm living in a police state up here. University is also a lot cheaper, affordable, and doesn't put a person in debt/indentured servitude for the rest of their lives. <br>  <br>  It is cold though. Very, very frickin cold and there's a lot of snow. This can be hard on your vehicle. It gets tiresome after a while too and shoveling feet of snow every week starts to suck around mid-January. Plus there's fewer daylight hours which I know gets to me sometimes, especially in the dead of  winter when the sun goes down here at like 5-5:30pm. Canadians are fanatical about hockey too - the same way Europeans are about soccer. Just smile and nod and you'll be fine. Oh and they like their beer. Canadians really put away the beer, it's true. <br>  <br>  As for moving here I'm not sure... but Canada's pretty okay. It's like a colder version of the USA with less crazy religious people, more snow and some amusing accents~ :)|`|OvJpK2Zsaa	do you qualify to immigrate to canada?  that should be your first concern<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/index.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/index.asp</a>|`|3QsPl1uLaa	I think you need to know allot more about Canada to make a decision like that.

1bTYCUDkaa	Yes.  On www.orbitz.com and other similar bargain travel websites, click "search near-by airports".  I have done multiple searches on Orbitz, and checked that box.  For example, I was searching for itinerary from Buffalo to Fort Lauderdale, and then on the way back, it said Fort Lauderdale to Syracuse.  It is possible.|`|UVUYG5jaaa	the whole purpose of a round trip ticket is to use the same airports|`|AA11496012	Another way in addition to the "open Jaw" is if you fly into an airport such as in Manila.  Manila has 2 airports; one for international flights and one for domestic.  When my friend flew into Manila from the United States, he arrived at the international airport.  He then had to take a taxi to the domestic airport to connect in order to get to his final destination of Cebu City.|`|9e3125f1cbec258838efea7ac306d1c1aa	That's called an "open-jaw ticket" - an example would be a flight from New York to Paris, you travel between Paris and Rome on your own, and then you fly back to New York from Rome.<br>  <br>  Most online sites will not give you a good fare for them, but a good travel agent should be able to get you one for no higher than the higher of the price of a round trip to each of the cities.  In other words, if it's $500 for a round trip from New York to Paris and back, and $700 for a round trip from New York to Rome and back, the open-jaw ticket above should cost no more than $700, and in some cases you could get one for the average of the round trip prices - $600.|`|Mxr6AIkiaa	Yes. There are at least two variations on this.<br>  <br>  First, in some places multiple airports serving a metropolitan area are counted as one destination. If you fly into LGA, for example, flying home from EWR or JFK counts as a simple round trip. By the way, if you don't care which airport you fly in/out of for New York City, search using the pseudo-airport designator "NYC" instead of an individual airport code.<br>  <br>  Then there's the "open jaw" booking, where you fly from, say, San Francisco to JFK, then back to SFO from BOS. The airline doesn't know and doesn't care how you get from New York to Boston. Pricing on those may be as little (and as simple) as half the SFO-JFK round trip plus half the SFO-BOS round trip or may be a bit more (more money, and more convoluted) but is almost certainly less than two one-way tickets.
Mkb0wTjAaa	If course in fact the french community of Quebec is considered a part of Latinamerica as the Spanish speaking comunity in New Mexico of USA is considered a part of Latinamerica too, Haiti and the French Guyana, but the country Canada isnt Latinamerica because you have english as the first oficial and most widespread language, 90% speaks it and just 40% speak french, so to be a part of Latinamerica you shouldn't have ''english'' over there for first time.|`|cdCGo0vHaa	No, not at all.<br>  Latin America has more to do with location not language (although it does play some part).

54ee904ce0957cabc081644147eab797aa	Hi, I live in LaSalle, ON (suburb of Windsor), but work and attend school in Windsor, ON.  <br>  <br>  First, for the border.  I'm presuming you and your girlfriend are U.S. citizens.  For documentation, the Canadian Border Services Agency (CBSA) requires that you have a passport, or proof of citizenship (ie. birth certificate).  Remember to bring government-issued photo identification (ie. driver's license) to accompany your proof of citizenship if you don't have a passport.<br>  <br>  Their is so much to do within Windsor and the surrounding Essex County that I don't even know where to start.  Check out the Visitors Bureau website link in the sources section to see a full list of what's available in our area.  Here are a few of my personal recommendations, and I've provided links for these attractions in the sources section as well:<br>  <br>  - Art Gallery of Windsor, located in downtown Windsor<br>  - Outlet mall shopping @ Windsor Crossing<br>  - Odette Sculpture Park

Z57Feobcaa	The best time for visiting the Fiji Islands is between May and November. This is the 'winter' season, and though still deliciously warm and tropical, it is not as humid as the hotter, wetter summer months of December - April. However, do not rule out the summer months as there are many advantages. Firstly there is a greater abundance of flowering shrubs and trees as many of these start to bloom more prodigiously from November. Secondly, since it is the ' low season ' it is easier to find many excellent deals. Fiji is beautiful all year round - it's just that there is more chance for some tropical rains during summer. But it is the tropical rains that make Fiji such a beautiful paradise!|`|AA10961212	It gets quite hot and humid from November to April, while from May to October, the weather in Fiji is much cooler and drier. The rainfall here is highly erratic and is usually characterized by brief but heavy downpours. Hurricanes or tropical cyclones are most likely to take place between November and April and usually originate from low pressure centers near the equator. However, it should be noted that strong destructive hurricanes rarely hit Fiji.

Lay out what you want to take, then decide what one is better for your trip<br>  hope this helped!|`|BXBTv1H5aa	If you are the type of girl that likes to have options in clothing, and that likes to have it nicely folded and packed neatly in your luggage then the suitcase. <br>  <br>  But if you're the kind of girl that does not care what she wears then you could use anything, it's really as matter of rocking what you bring, and not having second choices.|`|nXTDkokuaa	Well i dont know what is your taste in a luggage type you wanted but then i found a huge selection of luggage sets site  <a href="http://www.luggage-deals.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.luggage-deals.com/</a> that might help you to look a luggage in your 2 night trip :)|`|4VBoqt4jaa	for a two day trip i would take the duffel bag<br>  you aren't going to need to bring that much stuff and if you bring a suitcase you'll feel the need to pack more.
gEBBpvlFaa	It depends upon how you're mailing it. If you mail it in a flat rate Priority Mail box from the USPS, it'll take 3-4 days.|`|jYPeis3Saa	so you couldnt call the post office, ups or fed ex and ask because??|`|vaM9JtcTaa	priority mail gts there by airplane, but no one knows how long it sits in the main post office in Honolulu....can take up to 7 -10 days|`|vXoDHBGMaa	it takes 6 working days

Eat all these different foods. take a lot of pics and VIDEOS(like u still got europe with you lol) take long vids so u dont end up sayin"thats it!? mann i should have taken more..." be prepared. I personaly want to go to...Spain than Italy, than Pais. but that is just me.<br>  I hope u have an awesome trip and stay safe:)|`|PwHQSAxvaa	Great Britain. Rich in history back to Roman occupation and beyond. Fantastic architecture in major cities. Okay, some buildings are ugly concrete monstrosities, but Wren's St Paul's, and the neo-gothic Palace of Westminster (parliament) are known the world over. Not forgetting the lovely Byzantine Westminster Cathedral and the Norman Tower of London. How many cities have a 1000 year old castle in the middle? And that's just London. There are also great buildings around the country and, since Britain was the first to industrialise, many of them were firsts in engineering. And there are countless fantastic unspoilt National Parks.|`|JsCSVzgtaa	It all depends on what you like.  If you are into the arts, either Italy or France. <br>  <br>  What I would recommend is buy a Euro-rail pass for the two weeks.  With the Euro-pass you can travel several countries within the two week period.<br>  <br>  Check the sites below for some more information.<br>  <br>  One last thing, whatever you decide to do, enjoy it and be open to the whole experience.  And remember you are the foreigner, so you need to adapt to them not the other way around.|`|6lWBa6GRaa	There are loads of good european countries to visit.

TcgUVcYwaa	1) According to German law you can own things (including real estate) right after your birth and up until your death. So there is no age-limit to owning real estate. <br>  <br>  But if your niece plans to stay in Germany for only one year it would make far more sense to rent than to buy. The real estate market in Germany is kind of sluggish, if you buy you buy for life. Real estate is hard to sell, with the legal issues involved it makes absolutely no sense to buy real estate just bc your niece wants to live in Germany for a year. <br>  <br>  2) You need to be 18 and a German citizen to vote in federal elections. EU citizens can vote in communal elections, in some states you can vote in state and or in communal elections after you have turned 16.<br>  <br>  3) 18. <br>  <br>  You need to be 18 to drive a car and make major decisions (take out a loan, sign an employment contract, make major purchases, ...) without the permission of your legal guardians. <br>  <br>  4) www.toytowngermany.com|`|94b8KImYaa	18 for all. <br>  <br>  Once you hit 18 in Germany you can drive, do business (buying an apartment) drink, vote (if you are a German citizen) and you are fully responsible for all your actions. <br>  an Adult by all means with all responsibilities and rights.

The same data shows violent crime levels in Paterson tend to be much higher than New Jersey's average level. There is no Edgewood in Chicago. Chicago has a Englewood, Edgewater or Edgebrook. Which one do you mean? O.K, then the  the murder count in the Englewood community continues to be one of the city’s highest. The Defender reported in August that from January to July 2007, Englewood had 25 murders compared to 26 for the same period this year. Paterson has 17 murders in 2007.
IstwJtBraa	It is playa dorada btw/<br>  <br>  You can go to the shared beach, the pay discos and bars in the complex.<br>  <br>  You can only eat in yours and if there is another Allegro Hotel in the complex which I don't remember if there is.  There is a disco next to the Casino at the entrance on the left.  There are movies in a little mall in the middle.<br>  <br>  You can also take a cab to Puerto Plata and hit some of the clubs there.<br>  <br>  Remember every Dominican guy is going to love you very much.  It is all about your money so don't take it to heart and don't think you found a better one because he will only be a better talker and more charming.  The entertainers are usually Sankies who go after the money of the tourists.

wdaoaa1gaa	For how many bedrooms?  Good luck trying to get a 3 bedroom with that price unless you are going to the south side. Depends on what you want to do, if you are in your early 20's go to Lake View (everybody else does) or Wrigleyville but you'll have to pay at least 2000 bucks for a 3 bedroom apartment.  IF you are more in your late 20's, I'd recommend wicker park, bucktown, roscoe village.|`|OLXv3DEAaa	$600-1000 total? You will not find 3 BR apartments anywhere but the worst areas for that little money. I don't think you need to pay $2000 a month to live here but at least $1200-1500. Even 2 BR are hard to find for $1000.<br>  <br>  Realistically maybe look at Edgewater or Rogers Park. Edgewater is nicer but generally a little more expensive. Rogers Park has some nice areas and some not nice areas. <br>  Try looking at Craigslist for a better idea of the rents in different neighborhoods.

TskZHzZyaa	I parked on Addison once about 4-5 blocks to the West I think.  But knowing the city better I take transit whenever possible - the Red line lets you off right at Addison.  Also I parked on the street 10 years ago - as cash strapped as the city has been I wouldn't be surprised if they have more meters up around the area.  <br>  <br>  And if you do insist on driving don't expect to drive away in a hurry - with the crowds leaving and some hanging around the ballpark don't expect to move fast.  Unless of course you take the train.|`|tAYL0Ktdaa	try and get there early. There will be a lot of places with parking signs & the closer to Wrigley the more it will cost you.

Exect to pay around $30-$40 to park for the game.  <br>  <br>  If you're looking to spend less, coming from the north park at DeVry near Wrigley which is sponsered by the Cubs and they'll bus you over for free.  The parking is like $6.  DeVry is at Addison & Western: <a href="http://chicago.cubs.mlb.com/chc/ballpark/directions.jsp" rel="nofollow">http://chicago.cubs.mlb.com/chc/ballpark...</a><br>  <br>  From the south I like to park at Chinatown and take the red line to Addison.

Ride on a cable car while in San Francisco.  It's very fun and inexpensive, and  a San Francisco tradition.  You must see the view from Coit Tower.  It is spectacular.  I have some great photos of myself with beautiful San Francisco in the background.  Check out Muir Woods, just north of San Francisco, for scenic natural beauty.  Also, I suggest visiting Golden Gate Park, where you'll find The Botanical Gardens, Academy of Sciences, the Buffalo Paddock (view some roaming buffalo), and the Japanese Tea Gardens.  While you're in Chinatown, go visit the fortune cookie factory.  It's a very cool tour.  Enjoy some of Chinatown's great teas and try some dim sum.  It's a very interesting experience.

His passion for food and his pride of honoring the culinary traditions of Italy have named Perbacco the best fine dining Italian restaurant in San Francisco.<br>  <br>  Staffan travels to Italy 4 times a year to seek out new recipes and discover traditional Italian methods of cooking. The menu changes seasonally and you will never find chicken with pasta- so don't even ask! Some of the items you just can't miss there are the breadsticks, house-cured charcuterie platter, any of the house-made pastas, the dried-aged steak and the panna cotta.<br>  The wine list is impeccable and can be intimidating if you are not familiar with European wines, but do not fear! The ever-knowledgeable Sommelier and service staff will be more than happy to guide you through your wine experience.<br>  <br>  "Staffan Terje, who worked many years at Scala's Bistro, has created a breakout restaurant in the Financial District where he makes stunning house-cured meats, incredible pastas and the world's best breadsticks, brought to the table soon after guests are seated. Old meets new in the two-level interior that incorporates a large open kitchen and various dining areas, some with majestically high ceilings and others with a more intimate, private atmosphere.

I think first you will learn how to pronounce and write, and read the characters, then build on from there. Yet, to really get the correct pronunciations, you should try to visit Korea and hear what the natives sound like. Some of the pronunciations are difficult, and are hard to really know what they sound like without hearing from a native. Like it is with all languages, it takes effort and time to learn Korean. You can also try reading hangul books if you're fluent enough, and expand your vocabulary from there.|`|2b97e016ad66437b36147f9acd28a75baa	Unfortunately, Korean isn't an easy language to learn.<br>  It's very complex and the Korean language has so many grammatical aspects that are absent in most languages.<br>  <br>  It's known to be as difficult as Modern Standard Arabic (if not more) and it's faaaaar more difficult than Latin for sure.

Stockbridge is south of Atlanta but close enough to the amenties that Atlanta has to offer.  Weather can be cold in the winter with little to no snow.

Crime can hit anyone at anytime.  It is easy to find great neighorhoods and good schools.  Atlanta's bad rap is not deserved.|`|ab61ef1200d21fb7cf489c83f75d6fc9aa	atlanta kool.itz qanqs everywher not juss in atlanta. there can be rude n nice peopl. but stockbridqe no really bad. u will like it.downtown they have alotta stuff to do.tha underqround,atlantic station, greenbriar mall,aquarium...MANY thinqz ta do|`|VALo05Zdaa	OMG another yankee moving to Atl!|`|Aw6nZ4wWaa	I hate it sooooo much.There is nothing to do at all.

tPPZ0QDmaa	I'm not sure what you mean by 'good', but I'll break this answer down into my categories for 'good'.  <br>  <br>  Best price....roadside jerk chicken vendors.  They're always around and you can't beat their prices or creativity.  Prices are $3+<br>  <br>  Best atmosphere...Kuyaba on the beach.  I've never been so relaxed while eating.  Sitting at a table with a candle while hearing nothing besides some reggae and the waves of the ocean--its heaven.  The service is over the top great.  The staff actually cares about your meal.  Dinner with two drinks will run you about $25+.  <br>  <br>  Best Authentic Jamaican food....there's a ton.  My favorite is Fatty's.  Its across from Traveller's Resort on the beach.  Her prices aren't posted--just the menu.  She charges you based on your attitude.  The portions are large and its a favorite with locals.  Try the curry goat.  Be adventurous!!  Prices with a beverage $5+|`|j0lAPCfTaa	There is a wonderful restaurant on 7 mile beach called cherylann Inn. It has table linens, linen napkins and even water glasses.  .The outdoor dining area  is really nice.  The food is fantastic, the wine list, extensive and the service is above par.

0ed3a47409dac89fe63086d50549f520aa	You could consider doing a graduate degree at a European university. Most undergrad programs are in the native language of the country, but there are plentiful Master's programs available in English all around Europe. Some countries have no tuition, so you just have to pay living costs. A European grad degree would help you find work in the country you wanted to move to, as well as give you time to adjust to the cultural changes. The UK is also tightening rules for non-EU workers, requiring a Master's degree anyway on the skilled-worker scheme. You might as well get it there, if that's where you want to go. UK does charge tuition fees, but they are much less than the US. Most student visas come with an allowance to work part time.<br>  <br>  You'll need to start on your language skills now if you want to live in Germany/Austria/Italy. The more fluency you have, the better chance of finding work.<br>  <br>  There are a few fields that are in demand in every country. Technology, engineering, building, sciences, healthcare, teaching. An English as a foreign language teaching certificate isn't enough, you'll need a full teaching education if that's what you want to do. Most countries hire dual-language teachers in both the native tongue and English, so it may be better to concentrate in another field. You'll find that healthcare (doctors, nurses, hospital staff) and engineering especially will offer plentiful work opportunities.|`|4WxJvc5Raa	Europe has the same needs as the US. The first question they will ask you is, can you speak German? etc... I would take the time to learn the basic language of the chosen country first.|`|TcgUVcYwaa	If you are serious about moving to Europe you should look into studying at a European university. <br>  <br>  As a US citizen you need a residency and work permit in order to live in Europe. (You'll be considered an immigrant, so you need the European equivalent of a Green Card.) For a young person the easiest way to a residency and work permit in Europe is to graduate from a European university, either with a bachelor or a master's degree.<br>  <br>  As for special career, IT and engineering are sought after in Germany and people who hold bachelor degrees in these fields and have some experience can usually get a skilled migrant visa. <br>  <br>  But most important you should study what you enjoy and what you are good at. This will increase the chances that you'll find a good job that you like and that makes you happy, regardless where it is and what it pays. <br>  <br>  The biggest problem of studying in Europe is usually the cost. Foreign students are given a limited work permit, but on this work permit (10 hours a week) most students cannot make enough money to make ends meet. The main source of funding has to come out of savings, either their own or their parents. The cost is roughly 750 EUR per month in Germany, 800 EUR per month in Austria. Studying in London is about 1000 GBP per month. Some students from the U.S. have managed to take out student loans from US banks and institutions in order to study in Europe. Scholarships for studying in Europe are usually not available until you are in your 2nd year of university or are already doing your master's degree. <br>  <br>  For information on studying in Germany check out <a href="http://www.daad.de" rel="nofollow">http://www.daad.de</a> <br>  <br>  I especially recommend that you carefully read "Admission at a glance"<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.daad.de/deutschland/wege-durchs-studium/zulassung/06160.en.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.daad.de/deutschland/wege-durc...</a><br>  <br>  You'll quickly see that in order to enroll at a German university as a U.S.-American you need to have very good German and that (unless your highschool diploma is very good, say a SAT score of 1300 points in both Math and Critical Reading) you have to take preparatory classes and pass an exam.|`|95b3c1cab8a1f1f08d03b46eefc17755aa	You need a job offer first, and you won't get that until you've finished with college. <br>  <br>  In Ireland there is a shortage of science graduates. Italy, Austria or Germany all require speakers of the languages, so you should learn German and/or Italian as well. What's very useful in those countries is a teaching diploma of English as a foreign language.|`|OHfZFR31aa	If you want to eventually move to Austria or Germany, then study German. It's almost impossible to get a job if you aren't fluent<br>  <br>  As the other poster says, I would get an undergrad degree in the US, with at least a minor in German. Then go to a German university for your Masters<br>  <br>  Or study nursing as well as German. There is a nursing shortage all over Europe and it's one of the easiest ways to get a work visa. You just have to complete a bit of additional training in the country where you want to practice, but often they will let you start working while you are taking those courses<br>  <br>  Call the German or Austrian embassies or consulates to find out what your options are
AA10255325	I don't know much about how they ID you in the resorts, if it's all inclusive you will have a band to wear, one for adults and one for under 18.  As far as the clubs I would imagine you can find a way in. I've seen kids in those places that look 14 or 15. If you tip well you can get just about whatever you want.<br>  <br>  2nd question: I think legal age is 18 but probably only one of you have to be 18 put it under your name.<br>  <br>  3rd question:  Cancun is a party place! hands down. The clubs are crazy! We always go in June and it's packed with young people.<br>  <br>  4th question: We have a membership at the Palace Resorts (Beach Palace, Cancun Palace, Moon Palace and Sun Palace) it's all inclusive including alcoholic beverages and two tours are included. They stock your refrigerator in your room with beer and soda and two big bottles of liquor, whatever you want. There are also hot tubs in the rooms. Even the regular deluxe room has them.  So look into those resorts online and you can make it all inclusive which is so worth it, because it includes food and beverages,tours (2) and tips.  The Beach Palace and the Cancun Palace are the closest to downtown and the clubs. Hope this helped.

Jo2VrRRjaa	The previous poster gave you some really good information. I'd have your friend have somebody send him his birth certificate immediately so that he can get back into the US, because they are VERY picky when you go back into the States. I've had problems (meaning the 3rd degree: where are you going, what are you doing, how long are you going to be there?) at the US/Mexico border when I cross to go shopping etc. and I always have my US passport with me.   Once your friend gets their birth certificate, I would advise them to go to the nearest US consulate and get a passport or a passport card to make crossing the border easier.|`|brmSHEvkaa	If you don't have your passport, and trying to go to the U.S. you are going to have a problem because you need one in order to pass the border. remember, U.S. is stricter than Mexico....

Maybe in downtown Lima you can sell it to a Vintage Money dealer but he's not going to give you much for it for they made a lot of bills in 1987 causing a hiperinflation of over 2,000%  in 1988 (more than 30% per month).<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.deperu.com/album/galeria/50_intis.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.deperu.com/album/galeria/50_i...</a>|`|Ax1EX8Twaa	It may have some numismatic value. If you google it, you can see that several people are auctioning this bill, with asking prices varying from $0.50 for a single bill of 50 Intis, to $4.99 for 10 bills. <br>  <br>  For example:<br>  <a href="http://shop.vendio.com/kashiwa/item/977651723/?s=1235391227" rel="nofollow">http://shop.vendio.com/kashiwa/item/9776...</a><br>  <a href="http://yhst-50657565757811.stores.yahoo.net/w10-pen-p131b-87.html" rel="nofollow">http://yhst-50657565757811.stores.yahoo....</a><br>  <a href="http://www.kcshop.com/fc/p.php?pic=F536" rel="nofollow">http://www.kcshop.com/fc/p.php?pic=F536</a><br>  <br>  As far as currency value goes, Perú now uses the Nuevo Sol, which is quite stable against the US dollar with a local exchange rate varying between S/.3 to S/.3.50 for 1 USD over the last few years. The exchange rate fluctuates based on economic activities, but there is no consistent inflation against the dollar at the moment<br>  <br>  The Inti was a monetary unit that was mainly in use during Alan Garcia's first term as president in the second half of the 1980s, which was characterized by economic contraction, hyper-inflation, and strong left-wing guerilla activity. The economy was turned around by the following president, Alberto Fujimori, and stabilized by subsequent presidents.<br>  <br>  I don't think that the Peruvian Central Bank accepts exchange of Intis for Nuevo Soles, and as such, for use for actual payment, your bill is worthless.

You're bound to come across some pretty sweet places.|`|ac7e0f50f58632b431b5cf5de0564ffbaa	There are literally hundreds of things to do here in LA. Here is my list of “must sees”. Visit as many as you have time for.:<br>  <br>  Disneyland: The Happiest Place on Earth. Half a billion visitors can’t be wrong. #1 Destination. <br>  Universal Studios: A theme park that grew out of a studio tour. #2 Destination.<br>  Even if you don’t visit Disneyland or Universal Studios Tour, Downtown Disney District and Universal City Walk are very fun places to visit for shopping and eating. And they’re free to visit. <br>  <br>  Hollywood: Enjoy the Walk of Fame, Entertainment Museum, Chinese Theatre and more. You can see a lot for free. The Hollywood & Highland complex is AMAZING. It has lots of shops and restaurants, and the Kodak Theater (home of the Academy Awards). I also like the El Capitan theater, right across the street, where Disney shows their movies. And the Hollywood Bowl is a GREAT place to listen to concerts outdoors. <br>  <br>  Rodeo Drive, 90210: Packed with exclusive shops, full of gawkers. They all came to enjoy the excess. Free, unless you intend to buy something.<br>  <br>  Venice Beach: Los Angeles kitsch and over-the-top culture at its best. Here you'll find Muscle Beach, street performers and tacky shops galore. Fun, VERY interesting, but I avoid it after dark, when it gets a little TOO interesting for my taste. <br>  <br>  Santa Monica Beach and Pier: Great beach scene and a classic seaside amusement park, complete with antique carousel that has been in a lot of TV and movies. (The Sting and "Three's Company" come immediately to mind). After visiting the pier, you can ride a bike south a couple miles to Venice Beach.<br>  <br>  Santa Monica Third Street Promenade - Downtown Santa Monica's shopping promenade is often the scene of movie star-sightings. Just north of Santa Monica Pier.<br>  <br>  Sunset Boulevard: Perhaps one of the world's most famous streets, it began as a route between the stars' posh neighborhoods and the Hollywood studios. It runs from downtown to the ocean, passing through the "Sunset Strip" on its way. It makes for a fun drive. When you get to the ocean, stop at Gladstone's for Fish.<br>  <br>  Farmers Market and The Grove - A new shopping complex right next to a Los Angeles landmark, The Grove and Farmers Market coexist. Enjoy a movie or shopping, and then take the trolley to the Farmers Market for lunch or dinner. It is right next to CBS, so walk across the lot to see if they are taping "The Price is Right". You might even get in.<br>  <br>  TAAB: The Americana at Brand- The newly opened TAAB, developed by the same group that gave us The Grove, breathes new life into Glendale, and gives all those hip people in Eagle Rock and the eastern half of LA a great place to go. <br>  <br>  Griffith Park - Home of the Los Angeles Zoo, Griffith Park Observatory, Travel Town, the Greek Theatre, and Gene Autry Museum of Western Heritage.<br>  <br>  Getty Museum - The Getty's architecture is so beautiful that it keeps me fascinated. No matter whether you like their art or architecture better (or maybe you'll just enjoy the view), the Getty is sure to please. Free.<br>  <br>  Attend a TV taping - You can get free tickets at audiencesunlimited.com, tvtix.com, or see the booth at Universal City walk. It's very interesting to see a show being taped. The most popular, by far, is the Tonight show with Jay Leno. Check the NBC web site for all the details there.<br>  <br>  Places to eat:<br>  In-N-Out Burger: Multiple locations, best burger in LA, ask anyone.<br>  Pink’s Hot Dogs: 709 N. La Brea, just north of Melrose. You might even see a celebrity. Maybe.<br>  Tommy’s Chili Burgers: Look for the shack, an LA tradition. The original location is at Beverly & Rampart, a couple miles west of downtown.<br>  Canter’s Deli: 419 N. Fairfax, between Beverly & Melrose. Near CBS, you might spot a celebrity.<br>  Phillippe’s: 1001 N. Alameda. Great roast beef sandwiches. Near Union Station and Olvera Street. Watch the mustard, it’s hot.<br>  The Pantry: Corner of Figueroa and 9th, downtown. Huge portions, they never close, GREAT steak and eggs.<br>  <br>  Places to Stay:<br>  Since LA is so spread out, there is no single place that is close to EVERYTHING. Most people who come here tend to stay in Hollywood, Santa Monica, or Anaheim.<br>  In Hollywood, I recommend the Renaissance Hotel at Hollywood and Highland, the Best Western Sunset Plaza, or the Holiday Inn Walk of Fame. <br>  In Santa Monica, the Holiday Inn Santa Monica is close to the pier and reasonably priced.<br>  In Anaheim, I recommend the Howard Johnson (HoJo) Anaheim, and the Candy Cane Inn. <br>  <br>  Places to Shop:<br>  Third Street Promenade, Santa Monica<br>  The Grove, Los Angeles<br>  Americana @ Brand, Glendale<br>  Beverly Center, Los Angeles<br>  Citadel Outlets, Commerce<br>  Brea Mall, Brea<br>  The Block at Orange, Orange<br>  South Coast Plaza, Costa Mesa<br>  Fashion Island, Newport Beach<br>  Santee Alley, Los Angeles|`|AA11562811	Go to the Griffith Park Observatory in Los Angeles.  It's free and you can learn new things.  It's a great place to see how huge L.A. is. On a clear day you may see the mountains and the Pacific Ocean all in one spot.   You can also see the Hollywood sign.  <br>  <br>  Have fun <br>  <br>  A native Angeleno|`|EVncPolHaa	the promanade in santa barbara. such a fun place. you could take a day in hollywood--go to the star walk. there's actually a lot of stuff to do there, and a huge mall with great food :) if you're looking for something more historical there is a great mexican mission in ventura. hope you have fun :)|`|oTHdb4HKaa	Carlsbad, California<br>  Breathtaking|`|eopnz5Bbaa	You should go to the Birch Aquarium.

Darien, Greenwich, Westport are charming, small towns with architectural and historical elements that are quite nice (No Frank Lloyd Wright's, however) There are some very acceptable areas in Stamford, CT. Small towns like Bedford and Pound Ridge, NY are also lovely. Peekskill, Croton-on-Hudson and other towns along the Hudson river are within reach. Princeton NJ is a good candidate, as are the small towns in Northwestern NJ. But be warned, real estate in locations that are within 60 miles of NY, that fit your interests, is going to be VERY expensive. Good luck, and welcome home.|`|lZVz8SwBaa	long island|`|9e3125f1cbec258838efea7ac306d1c1aa	There aren't any places that fit all of those criteria - you will have to prioritize - which is more important to you - affordable, good schools, character, or close to the city.

After the revaluation of the Romanian leu, the metical briefly became the least valued currency unit, at a value of about 24,500 meticais per USD, until the Zimbabwean dollar took the title in late August 2005.

f4c35d4729f3cfcc287328ffc6b7f9a8aa	If you don't mind sitting through 2 hours of "time share" sales?  You can pick up two free tickets to one of Disney's theme parks just for suffering through the presentation and the BS.  :)  All the hotels have that pitch available, I do it every time I go there, my partner and kids chill out at the pool (get the early morning session.)  They really are good tickets and they really are free, just say NO to the time share purchase...LOL<br>  <br>  Otherwise, online is actually the best price available that I've found for Universal, Sea World, and Disney.  AND, you don't have to stand in those damn lines to buy your tickets there!  Just go right to the turnstyle.  Gives you an half hour extra.  <br>  <br>  SeaWorld is the best park by far of all of them.  Universal is better for older kids than the young ones.  Disney is always crowded, earlier you get there the better.<br>  <br>  And take the time to spend 2 hours or so at Gatorland.  It's a little, family park that is fun for smaller kids, no crowds, hands on and the food is the best at any park in Orlando, and cheaper, too!<br>  <br>  Orlando Zoo north of town about 10 miles, same thing, small, quiet, and great to get away from the crowds.|`|Aw6nZ4wWaa	There is a store named costco,they sale universal orlando for both parks and you could use it up to 3 months it cost $90.00,Disney's you could try AAA travel!|`|7A3ROGjxaa	I wouldn't wait to purchase them.

SAAO0xXgaa	A great question I would say.<br>  <br>  The reason Hong Kong is Hong Kong because of its unique location. It is near to PRC yet separated. During the early periods it served as an important trade outpost for the British merchants. They signed a 99 year lease agreement with Qing Dynasty. Initially they traded tea and silk for clock, watches, musical box  and other such stuff. But soon it developed into an entrep?t. An entrep?tis a trading post where merchandise can be imported and exported without paying import duties, often at a profit. This profit is possible because of trade conditions, for example, the reluctance of ships to travel the entire length of a long trading route, and selling to the entrep?t instead. The entrep?t then sells at a higher price to ships travelling the other segment of the route.<br>  <br>  So Hong Kong's proximity to PRC brought in several roles for it, like:<br>  <br>  Trading Partner - HK as final customer and as supplier buying from and selling to China<br>  Middleman - organising transactions between China and third countries<br>  Investor/Financier - providing and organising funds for China<br>  Facilitator - point of contact, source of learning<br>  <br>  GOODS<br>  entrepot - HK firms buy from China, find buyers, set prices, take risk of ownership, make contracts<br>  trans-shipment - goods pass through HK<br>  brokerage - goods shipped directly from China to third countries -HK firms provide services<br>  <br>  SERVICES<br>  tourism - HK firms arrange inbound and outbound China travel since they allow people to visit without the requirement of a visa. In fact most of the tourists to China opt to come to HK first and get the visa to PRC from there.<br>  <br>  The role of middleman for HK is the centre of the economy: 90,000 Import/Export firms employ around 600,000 people.<br>  <br>  HK has a permanent geographical advantage and infrastructure development is well ahead of China because of the 99 years of British influence.|`|a6JZjRG1aa	if not for the geography there wouldn't be any HK...|`|nfu6LiVXaa	Hong Kong developed from a fishing port to a trading port. Before the trading with the westerners started, HK was a fishing port as it was along the coast line and it has a harbor. That's why you see a lot of fishing history in HK. When the westerners arrived in China, many of them landed in HK as it was closer (European ships traveled from Europe from China by going around Africa and India, so HK was closer than say, Shanghai). Westerners were interested in Shanghai and Beijing because of they were close to the "heart" of the emperor/capital. Hong Kong is one of the most southern cities of China, farthest away from the central government.<br>  <br>  Because of the harbour, coastline and location (closer to Europe and far from the Chinese government), Hong Kong and Macau became colonies of the Brits and Portuguese respectively.

W5VqTPQRaa	First, let me answer the big question: YES.  Argentina is an incredible place to visit and live.  I've traveled all throughout South America and Europe, and Buenos Aires is still one of the best places I've ever been.  <br>  <br>  People like to talk about how unsafe it is, but it is no different than any other big international city (and certainly safer than nearby Rio).  If you stay smart and keep your head up, you shouldn't have any problems.  <br>  <br>  Buenos Aires is a Latin American city with a European flavor.  People like calling it "The Paris of South America," but that doesn't do it justice.  BA has it's very own unique character that makes it stand out from every other city in the world.  There are so many things to do in the city, with lots of art, history, culture and an incredible nightlife.  And, you're only a short local flight away from many great natural sights, like the glaciers in Ushuaia and the amazing waterfall of Iguazu.<br>  <br>  So, yes, I'd say you should go to Argentina.  The only problem is that just one year might not be enough!

I'm guessing there should be a bus from Budva to Bar, but I can't seem to dig up any more info about that. Unfortunately Dubrovnik has no rail connection, so those are the only public transport options.

I highly doubt you would walk into Mecca and get a class in Islam. They would think a woman doing that would be insane anyway. And if your questions were things you could research yourself they would be upset that you did not research yourself instead of wasting their time. <br>  <br>  Why did you want only men to answer this question for? I think you can find this most pure teachings are that of Sunnah. You do not need anyone to show you that. You can study all of this on your home. As its best for women to stay at home. Maybe you should go to an Islamic university if your interested in learning about Islam. <br>  <br>  I live in Saudi and were not restricted. But we do know what lines we can not cross, and approaching a man like this would be one of them. It is best for you to study at home, they will tell you the same if you ask. <br>  <br>  About Mecca, yes non Muslims can not go, but you stated that you were one. The reason non Muslims can not go is to protect it not bc it is sunnah, as we have many enemies. <br>  <br>  Try studying Salafi, its the purest form of Islam and not this new modern style people are trying to practice. Its still Sunni, do not worry.|`|es6Xw606aa	If you want to know about Islam - there is only one way: learn Arabic and read the Qu'ran. There is no place for intermediatry in Islam - Islam as a religion stresses v deeply upon the individual's direct relationship with Allah. also dont get into the ritualistic aspect too much - try and imbibe the spirit of islam. People get too much into this hadees says this and that says that. No dont get into what people tell you - read and see for yourself. <br>  Then of course you can ask for a Sheikh's guidance.<br>  I would also suggest some other reading material. If you can find Marmaduke Pickthall's english translation of the Qu'ran, it will give a v good idea of the background and reasons why each particular Ayat came down to the Prophet (PBUH). <br>  There are also general books by Martin Lings and Karen Armstrong on the Prophet's (PBUH) life. Karen Armstrong has also written an extremely good and short history of islam and another book on the crusades which is v useful to get to understand the circumstances of islam and christainity today. <br>  You can only enter Mecca if you are muslim - i disagree with tina our Prophet (PBUH) never said anywhere that non-muslims cannot enter mecca. in fact he used meet many delegations and visitors there who were non-muslims. There is also undeniable proof that the guru of the Sikhs Guru Nanak sahib lived in Mecca for three years and studied Islam. So I suspect this is more of an organizational issue. <br>  This is what I was warning you against - ther are lot of people who will tell, oh dont put this on the floor, dont do this dont do that' - just think about it, in PBUH's days they did not have mega furniture to put things on. People used to read their duas and roll on the mat and sleep - so use your intelligence, filter out the rituals.|`|hrzc7BDQaa	I agree to the answers above, you need to read yourself to fill up yourself with basics, later on listen public talks by some active muslims scholars (Ahmed Deedat, Dr. Zakir Naik {you can find lots of videos too} and others mentioned above, as they are in every part of world from every culture and in every language).  Hopefully you will find answers to all your queries, as they carry answers to questions asked since ages and from different cultures and different parts of world. {At least I found mine.....}.|`|4c6549fd1fc3d819643c24a127555d36aa	I think your biggest hurdle is the fact that you're not a Muslim.<br>  <br>  Non-Muslims are forbidden entry to Mecca by Saudi law.|`|qnukgFYzaa	............ lol|`|jbICAok1aa	Hi Alisha,<br>  I believe the best choice would be doing some researches besides living your life normally.

L76KaI4zaa	Inversnaid is pretty close to being "in the middle of nowhere". There is only one road in from the East - most of the development on Loch Lomond is on the West side.

uwRYMelHaa	Positive: El Salvador suffered a civil war from 1980 to 1992. But now El Salvador has democracy and peace, a lot of liberties and the war is over, which helps the country to become more developed.<br>  <br>  Negative: Delinquency, criminality and dirty cities. El Salvador is one of the most dangerous countries in Latin America. In addition, a lot of cities are dirty especially because of the culture of people, they just put the trash on the streets, even when there are waste baskets nearby. As for what is being done to solve these problems, I think just trying to fight against these problems by campaigns of education for having clean our cities, and trying to capture delinquents. Anyway it does not seem to be working as we would like to, because the problems are still there. We need a very strong plan for attacking these problems, because we have many years with these problems and things have not improved as much as we want to and need to.<br>  <br>  Jaime Montoya<br>  webmaster@jaimemontoya.com<br>  <a href="http://www.jaimemontoya.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.jaimemontoya.com</a>|`|3KoGUAfLaa	As far as the positive issue, there is no longer a major civil war going on.<br>  <br>  On the negative issue: CRIME.

AA10250756	In the Tampa air port there are a lot of shops and restaurants outside of security in the landside area. They can park their car in the short term parking free for one hour and pay after that. You can meet them there and eat and shop. Afterwards you then go through a brief security to go to the shuttles to the gates and through security again when you get off the shuttle and that's the big, drawn out one. You would be able to meet them in the main airport area and eat and visit, but allow at least an hour afterwards so you get through the security and make your plane. By the way, I was just there today|`|1bTYCUDkaa	Usually, the gift shops are within the TSA security check-point, so your mom won't be able to get into the airport, so you will have to leave.

But they won't be able to go past there<br>  <br>  No, I do not think you hallucinated about all of that. I'm just saying that whenever I have flown in the past 42 years of my life, I needed a boarding pass to get through security. They ALWAYS ask for it right after you go through the metal detector. TSA agent standing there, he asks "can I see your boarding pass". Maybe you went to a airport where there was restaurants and shops before security?

Just so you know that when the majority of Jewish people pulled out of Morocco and stopped supporting that country it took a few years but Morocco King ended up begging Jewish people to come back.  Now Morocco is so bad that even Moroccans are having issues living in their own country.  When majority of Jewish people left Iraq, the government there actually questioned if they could survive it, because so many Jewish people were involved in businesses there. Those people were so corrupt with all that oil money and their own people didnt' benefit from it we saw where their war cries led them. Now America is trying to pull them back on their feet and nation build, so why you talking about destroying nations? And what kind of American lack of support are you considering, since there are so many Jewish Americans? And what do you think would happen to the Christians too are they going to automatically leave too and stop supporting Israel so you can support this fantasy of yours? You want things to be like Morocco and Iraq? Then go live in those countries and leave our countries alone.  America is a Judeo-Christian nation and Israel is a Jewish nation both countries are in Holy alliance supporting each other.  <br>  <br>  As far as Americans and supporting Israel it's actually quite patriotic to support our allies.  We don't just support Israel we support all our allies. Do you suggest we stop supporting Britain or they stop supporting us because we are stuck together like glue to them :) and have a long rich history together. No, you only want people to stop supporting Israel for now and that shows your true colors.  Blood red. Just like Hitler you pick on Israel first but we know you'll move onto someone else if given the opportunity.  Let me help you with your fantasy and snap you back into reality.<br>  <br>  We Americans come from a long line of Israel supporters. Our Presidents that support Israel are elected from a large constituency of people that support those Presidents because of their moral backbone. Reagan was a staunch supporter who loved Israel and believed in supporting our allies and the American public loved him. <br>  <br>  We have a common enemy that is Islamofascism, and the quickest way to be isolated in this world, is to turn one's back on their allies. Some of you people that support terrorism would like that. Turning our backs on our allies means exposing ourselves to our enemies with nobody to rely on except ourselves. Israel is doing a great service to help with the war on terror and all of the West being allied together makes us stronger, not weaker. We are NEVER going to turn our backs on our allies so snap out of it.<br>  <br>  Ronald Reagan, Speak Softly:<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efUB72yYxME" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efUB72yYx...</a><br>  <br>  "Any excuse for not providing our friends for the weapons they need to defend themselves is a prescription for disaster. And again, those who advocate ignoring the legitimate defense needs of those who protect will be held accountable if our national security is put in jeopardy.

Israel’s military and political importance in the Middle East and its strategic position stabilize the entire area, including the oil fields of the Persian Gulf.  It is a most reliable partner in the promotion of Western strategic interests and in the stabilization of the Middle East. Over 20% of its budget goes for defense, compared to 7% in the U.S. and less than 1% in Japan. Israel has one of the best armies in the world. Its navy and air force are the major deterrent forces in the eastern Mediterranean. Israel effectively secures NATO’s southeastern flank, without having a single American soldier stationed in its territory. Still, the superb military installations, the air and sea lift capabilities, the equipment and food storage capacity, and the trained manpower to maintain and repair sophisticated U.S. equipment are instantly at hand in Israel. It is the only country in the area that makes itself available to the United States, in any contingency.Only fraction of aid stays in Israel. There is no other country in the Middle East except Israel that can be considered to have a stable government or populace friendly to the United States. There is much danger that any military aid to Arab countries, and military equipment given or sold to them, will suffer the same fate as the untold billions of dollars and priceless military secrets that were lost to our enemies in the debacle of Iran. Is Saudi Arabia more stable? Egypt? Jordan? Kuwait? Judge for yourself.Only a fraction of the aid given stays in Israel. By far the largest share remains with American defense contractors. Peter McPherson, former administrator of the Agency for International Development, estimated that every billion dollars of aid to Israel creates 60,000 to 70,000 jobs in the United States. <br>  Also not one single U.S. soldier needs to be stationed and put at risk in Israel. U.S. military analysts estimate that the U.S. would have to spend the equivalent of $150 billion a year in the Middle East to maintain a force equivalent to Israel’s. There are many other benefits that the U.S. military derives from Israel. Israel is the only country that has gained battlefield experience with U.S. weapons. This experience is immediately conveyed to the U.S. Enormous quantities of captured Soviet weapons and defense systems were turned over to the U.S. military for analysis. Israel, in the light of its experience, continually modifies U.S. weapons systems. For instance, Israeli scientists have made over 200 improvements in the F-15 alone and similar improvements, mostly in avionics, in later-generation planes. It would be more in line with reality if military aid to Israel were classified as part of the defense budget, rather than as “aid”. Israel is truly America’s unsinkable aircraft carrier in the Middle East. Former President Reagan put it well: “The fall of Iran has increased Israel’s value as perhaps the only remaining strategic asset in the region on which the United States can fully rely.”|`|mXCDJ9jYaa	Probably when it's too late,as in South Vietnam in 1975 or later that year in Taiwan. The U.S. is notorious for abrupt changes of this nature. In the 60's they acted like the sky would fall if South Vietnam became united with the North. They acted like they reality itself would dissolve if anyone recognized "Red" China instead of Taiwan. Nothing changed gradually. It was a total surprise to both governments when they suddenly found themselves abandoned to their fate. No one could have predicted either volte-face even six months earlier.<br>  <br>  Re: as noted above. The U.S. would "crumble" if it weren't for "so much" the tel Aviv regime allegedly does for it? First off,I don't see where it does anything for us at all; our only real allies in the region are Turkey and Saudi Arabia,we get nothing from "Israel".  Anti-semitic? Well,I suppose you could call it anti-Slavonic to criticize the Russian Federation but I don't think it would have any merit. I couldn't care less what their ethnicity or religion is; I know a grisly racial state when I see one,Jewish or otherwise.As to "crumbling" the U.S. was doing just fine for almost two centuries before May 15,1948. In fact on that very day we were generally considered the heroes of the world. Today we are widely despised for our support of such a violent and racist  society. We got along very well without it before and we will get along very well without it in the future; it has certainly brought us no  blessings at all,only shame and disgrace. Whereas in 1947 we were loved and admired we are today hated and feared. It will take many generations to cleanse ourselves of this unholy misalliance and even then we shall always bear it's stain of iniquity.|`|eyJqrqn7aa	When the Anti Christ desecrates the new Temple.

mQZDizMVaa	I'm 1 1/2 hrs. out of NY, in NJ, close to the NYS stateline. Pure country-two lane country roads, farms, rolling hills, I can see the sky, no noise, no jackhammers, no sirens, no crowded stores.  Brutal commute via train or bus, but it's behind me-retired. <br>  <br>  Depending on where you move to, you'll need a car. I had my license for years, hardly drove. Moved to NJ, only had to take the written test, and I'm now driving. I'd rather drive to a mall than take those subways.<br>  <br>  Consider Hoboken (there could be reasonable apts. and via PATH it's about 15 mins. out of Man.), Montclair (train to either Hoboken or change at the Secaucas Transfer for trains to Penn Station), West Orange (Bus to Port Authority).<br>  <br>  I don't blame you for wanting to get out. Manhattan's too congested, people are on top of each other, the rents are absurd for what you get, and although you can get anything you want in Manhattan, stores are always packed. Forget shopping in a supermarket-the aisles are narrow and more often than not, they're out of stuff.<br>  <br>  Malls out here are never crowded and supermarkets are huge. Welcome if you decide to move to this side of the Hudson!|`|5XYlHv6Paa	Go to West New York, Weehawken, or Jersey City.

La comida es muy buena. Y los safaris, la verdad deliciosos. No te cansas de observar, tomar fotos. Además te dan espectáculos tradicionales de bailes típicos. Hay cenas en restaurantes al aire libre. Es toda una experiencia. Visitamos también Johanesburgo, una ciudad fantansma, pero que es interesante conocer. Fuimos a Soweto, cuna de Mandela y su lucha en contra del Apartheid, también conocimos la actual capital, Pretoria.

L9XS5Gqgaa	I like the East Side ( as opposed to East Providence which is a different area)  It's really the nicest part of Providence. Wayland Sq is there and has kind of pricey but nice restaraunts, and stores, Wickendon St is also in the area if you like funky areas, and Thayer St has a lot of students with stores like Urban Outfitters etc and is near Brown and RISD. They are all in the same area. Blackstone Blvd is there with beautiful old houses and walking areas.  Starting out I think the city is the best place to meet people. There are lots of people your age there. <br>  If you like beauty, South County is the way to go with Newport, other ocean and bayside towns and easy access to Block Island.  There is also a college town in Newport<br>  RI is small so you can practically drive across the whole state in 45 min so nothing is really far away. <br>  I would check out Craigslist RI on line for apts.  You can find sublets,and temps furnished appts etc. Then you don't have to make a huge commitment right away. Then check out Meetup Providence for whatever type of club, (kayaking, dining, newcomers, etc) you might want to join.  Have fun!|`|OMTQxQF1aa	Down town by the mall would be the best place but good luck because the people in Rhode Island are super rude and the traffic is horrible!

jOM4bBMPaa	M husband & I went on a 10 day vacation to Mexico in November 2007.  We flew into Cancun, rented a car & immediately drove down to Tulum.  Spent a few days there going to the beach, did a one day "Mayan adventure tour" through Alltournative, and ate some delicious food.  We stayed at the Posada Luna del Sur, which I just found out is on Trip Advisor's list of best bargain hotels in Mexico.  <br>  <br>  We then drove down to a little town called Xcalak, which is so small the closest gas station was over an hour away.  If you really want to get away from it all this is a great place to go.  We went snorkeling, kayaking, and relaxed on the beach.  The Hotel Tierra Maya is where we stayed & they had a restaurant on the grounds to eat at, kayaks you could use for free, and snorkeling equipment.  We went back to Tulum for another two days on our way back up to Cancun & visited a spider monkey preserve.   <br>  <br>  We stayed in Cancun one night, only because we had a 6am flight to catch.  We spent our entire time at the hotel we stayed at, the Westin.  It was the most expensive hotel we stayed at on our trip, but it was only a little more than $100 for the night.|`|AA10042296	Playa del Carmen is nice click the link below to read reviews and compare prices of 185 Playa del Carmen hotels.
jek0fdTfaa	Upon landing, airlines will turn off the lighting in the cabin and ask passengers to open their windows so their eyes will have time to get acclimated to the lighting conditions outside in the event an evacuation is needed. <br>  <br>  Imagine the scenario if an airline left the cabin lights on during landing in the evening and the power goes out. Passengers will have difficulty seeing in the dark and this will slow down the evacuation as they wouldn't be acclimated to the darkness. <br>  <br>  To a lesser extent, the same is true for a daytime evacuation as passengers would be blinded by going outside from a dark cabin.|`|nkA5NMUsaa	maybe i haven't flown enough but i have never heard any such order.|`|JEMtVVkBaa	So if the aircraft was to crash, or be in some type of emergency' rescuers could then see into the aircraft.<br>  <br>  Think about it; you are a rescuer and you want to save as many people as possible. You can see people that are dead, and others that are alive, but you also see closed window shades. You think that the people behind the shades are alive, but you are not entirely sure. <br>  <br>  So who's life would you save first? The person that you know that is alive because you can see them, or try to save someone where you dont know if they are dead or alive because their window shade is closed??|`|xIHgTqVhaa	I'm an ex-Flight Attendant and we were told in training to make sure the window shades were open during take-off and landing for several reasons. <br>  <br>  First, the interior lighting should match outside as much as possible for take-off and landing, which is helped by opening the shades. We had to adjust the cabin lighting accordingly, either full-bright for a daytime landing or completely off for a night landing. <br>  <br>  This means time isn't lost during an evacuation when people are either blinded by the outside light or need a second to adjust to the dark. It can't be matched exactly but even a slight adjustment either way can help.<br>  <br>  Second, in a crash, the emergency lights should go on. Even if they didn't, the passengers would have any outside light to help them find an exit. It would help their orientation. In either case, having as much outside light as possible, logically, is helpful.<br>  <br>  Lastly, after the evacuation, any rescue personel from outside can see inside the cabin more easily, to see if anyone is trapped inside. <br>  <br>  There have been claims that it's so that the authorities can do a "body count" after a crash by looking through the windows. This is so absurd and illogical, it doesn't merit comment. This appeared in a book which was meant to be a comedy on the airline industry and now some believe it to be fact. <br>  <br>  Another small plus, which isn't the reason for the rule, but if anyone gets airsick, it's good if they can see outside. On descent, you can get stuck in a "holding pattern", not fun for those who are prone to getting motion sickness. Seeing the ground, even if far below, helps equalize their inner-ear balance. <br>  <br>  Please let me remind you that in an emergency evacuation, do NOT grab any of your bags. As soon as the plane comes to a complete stop, follow crew members', and only crew members', instructions. If you are supposed to get out, do so and don't take anything with you. <br>  <br>  If there is someone else having trouble exiting their seats, evaluate the situation and only help if you can do so quickly. In most cases, it's better to take note of the location, evacuate yourself and immediately tell any rescue personel on the ground and/or crew members where the help if needed. <br>  <br>  Hopefully that's information you never need to use! Just a small public service message...that could save your life!<br>  <br>  It's nice to have the window shades down during the flight but for take-off and landing, the most dangerous portions of the flight, it's more practical to have them up. Everyone really should be awake at those times anyway so even if the sun is in their eyes, they'll be on the ground shortly anyway.<br>  <br>  Don't be afraid to ask the crew any emergency questions next time you fly!|`|1bTYCUDkaa	That is because if there is an emergency, they want you to see the landing circumstances (i.e: in water) and that you are prepared.|`|Mxr6AIkiaa	This gets asked every week or two. I suggest you look at previous answers. Some of them are correct, and others are amusing.

4kxg48quaa	They are all acceptable, however "these are very tall mountains" sounds best to me. High is better used for positions ("it's very high up there") and big is too simple/vague.|`|Q7ovix19aa	Its subtle.  High mountains can refer to the higher elevations.  The mountain's base could begin at higher elevation but the mountain itself might be rather unremarkable. Tall mountain refers to just height. Big mountain can refer also to girth.<br>  <br>  Here in the US we aren't so selective. Any would be assumed to mean tall mountain, but the most common would be "big mountains."  That ignores possible regional preferences, though.<br>  <br>  I'm sorry to be nebulous, but the answer is in fact nebulous.|`|7lmtBhdMaa	High mountains|`|JsCSVzgtaa	It all depends on the rest of the sentence and what you are trying to say.  All are good.|`|BF27cDnbaa	Like the person above me said, they're all right. I like tall mountains.

LOL :D|`|eEeCIRDaaa	high  mountains|`|YLqVv7Lzaa	I would say 'tall' mountains.<br>  <br>  'High' simply means that it is far above sea level, for example, Mount Everest is the highest mountain as it stands higher than any other mountain above sea level. However, from root to tip the tallest mountain is Mauna Kea on Hawaii, but most of it is below sea level..<br>  <br>  'Big' tends to take into account total mass, meaning a mountain could be the biggest mountain in the world without being the tallest. <br>  <br>  Edit: 'Cut your ears'? I haven't heard that one before....

I went to Magaluf (for example) when I was 16, and we drank every night, and my brother was even younger, although he looked older. <br>  <br>  I live in Barcelona, and while you would be allowed to drink in a restaurant with your parents, some places might refuse you, just as they don't want you getting drunk and rowdy amongst the other diners (I'd be inclined to say the same for most hotel bars) but you might not have a problem in some of the bars. <br>  <br>  I hope that's not confusing you, sorry!|`|Vv3UIGWWaa	I thought tou had to be over 18 too travel abroad or accompanied with an adult, you parents must be mad letting you go abroad at your age!<br>  <br>  But yes you will probably get served, and be good boys while you are there and don't drink to much !|`|vEJhSd0Raa	possibly, I've known sixteen even fifteen yr olds get served|`|NZPgCcHWaa	legal age is 18 for drinking and smoking!|`|WvevK4n0aa	no,you must be 18|`|rU4HYQk7aa	drinking is for fools|`|LbyUehC1aa	yes! they dont bother abroadd they just want money lol .. :D
CC461Vf3aa	1) Renting a car may be a good idea, however public transport is not expensive and gets you anywhere you want. It is 47 euro cent per trip. You can buy a day ticket or a three day ticket as well I think which would be worth it.<br>  <br>  2) I suggest you spend a whole day in Gozo. It is 45 minutes to Cirkewwa and a 20 minute ferry trip. In Gozo make sure to go to Dwejra and see the Azure window and Citadella. However, if time is tight, it is possible to spend a half day in Gozo if you leave Malta early in the morning.<br>  <br>  3) Regarding Harbour cruises, you can go to Sliema sea front and visit one of the various stands along the sea front. Compare prices first and then book. <br>  <br>  4) Sliema is a nice place to stay. There are various nice and affordable restaurants there and it is nice to go for a walk by the sea. San Gorg hotel is good. Sliema is also close to Paceville in St.Julians, famous for nightlife.<br>  <br>  Hope this helped and enjoy your holiday! :)|`|Vv7a31pmaa	don't go.

So I would worry and maybe wouldn't let her go, but not because of Kos, but because I would worry that she would get really drunk and get in the sea or just get alcohol poisoning, or that she may have a motorbike accident, or get raped by another drunk teenager.<br>  Apart from those, Kos is wonderful, it has amazing beaches, good food, interesting monuments, etc. Why don't you go there too? She will be with her friends, but you will be around and check on her a bit. And you will have the time of your life!!!|`|OXxKTM6vaa	I am 19 and have been to Kos twice. I went once with friends (last year) and with family around 6 years ago. I have never had any problems, I had just turned 18 when I went with friends and had the most amazing time - as long as you're daughter uses common sense she should be ok. <br>  <br>  It generally feels very safe in Greece, there are tonnes of Police officers and they are constantly patrolling so the area generally feels safe.

After that, you would need to find whatever it is you want to deliver and you would have to find custumers.|`|31MP69Q6aa	The best way is to start driving trucks in South Africa yourself by working for some one who has a trucking business, then after a couple of months you will learn the trade, buy your 1st truck (the horse), hire a trailer until you have enough money to buy your own trailer etc. You need a Code 14 license.
Rxi8wu5Paa	i love in dublin and i say just hit the city centre theres so much to do and make sure that at least once you go to a pub for dinner one of the best meals you will have|`|1bRRODd2aa	Most of the main shopping areas in Dublin are just North and South of the River. On and around O'Connell Street, Temple Bar, Grafton Street, etc.<br>  <br>  Get yourself a tourist map of Dublin, and that will give you a good idea on where places to visit are.
Lf16A5sYaa	The least expensive time of the year is summer.<br>  <br>  Washington works backwards from many tourist destinations, in that the tourist industry is secondary to the city's main industry: government.  Very little government work gets done in the summer.  So lobbyists and those trying to get government contracts aren't in town.  Plus they are willing to pay for good rooms.  The tourists are not.  So tourist season is actually when you'll find less expensive rooms.  However, be ready for the long lines at all the tourist attractions.<br>  <br>  If you're going to come weekends are always cheaper than weekdays.  Again, no work gets done on weekends.  A room that goes for $300 on a regular weekday will go for around $100 on a weekend.|`|AA12086491	I've visited twice in May and loved it, perfect temps, not many crowds, and if you go early in the month you miss the cherry blossom crowds.  Make good use of the Metro, it goes everywhere and is easy to use.  DC is great for a low budget trip because everything is free.  Plan well with your food needs, you can carry lunch with you in a backpack.  If you are staying in the city, stay in a hostel, they are inexpensive, www.hostels.com, if you are outside the city you can camp in some areas, I know in Greenbelt there is a campground, I didn't think it was that bad, surprisingly almost quiet (its in a national forest/agriculture area so its  away from highways.)  In that case you can drive to a metro stop and ride in from there.  If you are staying outside of the city I also recommend going to see Annapolis, your close by and its a great town.  I've done two low budget roadtrips to this area at this time of year and loved both of them, I can't wait to go back again.|`|48f05733ad5213c40c6efa92aa9ee2c0aa	Here's the deal...<br>  <br>  Summers are usually busiest, since people traditinally take their vacations in the summer.  It's also very hot and humid in Wash DC.  Not sure where you are from, but the heat is one thing...the humidity is the show stopper in the summer around the DC area.<br>  <br>  If you are looking to save money, I would suggest a trip sometime in November through February; that's when the hotels are SLIGHTLY cheaper, since it's no longer the summer vacation season.  But, just about everything else will be just as expensive.<br>  <br>  It's cheaper and safer to stay in either Virginia or SOME parts of Maryland, near the Metro (subway) stops.  Most hotels have a free shuttle service to the metro, and some hotels are close enough that you can simply walk to them.<br>  <br>  Be sure to book your hotel room far in advance!  That's the best way to get the best rates.  If you wait and book at the last minute, you will pay more (just like airline tickets).<br>  <br>  Also, there are some local "magazines" that have information about cheap room rates and have additional coupons.  (They usually put these things at the interstate highway rest stops for people driving through the area to pick-up.)|`|4bsg7laoaa	I would say the 7 months between Fall after Labor Day Holiday and before the Cherry Blossom Festival (March 28 - April 12) in the spring would give the offseason tourist the most leverage bec once schools start then the crowds will be less and leverage and supply of hotel rooms is in your favor.  But from the end of March (Cherry Blossom Festival) and all summer long, there will be too many tourists visiting means less hotel rooms and higher lodging rates....<br>  <br>   <a href="http://nationalcherryblossomfestival.org/cms/index.php?id=390" rel="nofollow">http://nationalcherryblossomfestival.org...</a>

AA11143484	I stayed there over the Christmas holidays, Grand Paradise Bavaro is amazing!!!! The entertainers there are so good especially Rodolfo, who's one of the main entertainers. They do these hour-plus long performances every night from like 9:00 pm to 11:00 pm, and its amazing performances, with a mix of dances, magic shows, singing, etc. And the pools are good, the beach is great and the rooms are all pretty tidy. The hotel also offers really good activities. Like they have Spanish lessons and yoga on the beach and dance competitions between the hotel guests and on Sundays there's always local Dominican bands that come play on the beach. The only bad thing about the hotel was the food-it tasted good ( dont get me wrong or anything, it wasn't bad quality food) but there just wasn't enough diversity. Like they only had three restaurants and if you're there for a week or more, you get tired of it. But the drinks are amazing-they have a whole range of drinks, perfect for people that do drink or that don't drink. <br>  So yeah, I definitely recommend the hotel.

G2h8g2g1aa	I think no matter where you live in the Chicago city limits (where the CTA operates) it is possible to get by with no car.  However most Chicagoans who do not have unlimited funds for cabs and renting cars will tell you that it is important to have access to a car.  You don't have to have a brand new car with maxed out insurance, but if you have a car in good working order that you take car of, you'll definitely be happy to have it.<br>  I have a car but I don't use it to go to work or anything else that has to do with downtown Chicago.  I do however use my car for anything really local or for any type of shopping...<br>  <br>  From my place if I wanted to go to the nearest Target I could walk to the corner (wait for 10 minutes) and take the #55 bus to Cicero, (wait another 10 minutes) then take the Cicero bus twenty block south to Target.  A trip that may take ten minutes at most in my car could take almost an hour via the bus in both directions, and that doesn' include lugging your bags around and maybe having to stand on the bus because all of the seats are taken.<br>  <br>  I can however walk to the grocery store and a few restaurants and bars as well, and I've gotten by just fine when my car was in the shop for repairs.  I would say if you're on the Near Westside you can get by with no car, but the truth is if you get rid of your car, at some point you're going to have to rent a car or make friends with somebody who owns a car.  My friends in the neighborhoods all own a car or are dating somebody with a car.  I'm friends with two couples who can afford to live downtown and one couple owns a car, and the other is looking at buying a car.<br>  <br>  My advice:<br>  Keep your car for a year and if you don't need it, get rid of it.  But make sure you go through WINTER in Chicago with no car before you get rid of it.|`|bmP4NdKuaa	It depends on where you want to live. If you live near the bus lines or the el, then you can survive very well without a car. And now there are Zip cars for rent all over the city. I would say the eastern edge of the north side is very easy to live without a car.|`|gkqSk29Zaa	KEEP YOUR CAR!! the only people who don't need cars are those who live and work close to the loop. If you are living way west side public transportation isn't as convenient. Plus think about waiting for a bus in Chicago's frigid winters.|`|04833260a508ecf8d2a4938012444526aa	West Chicago is a Chicago suburb.It is not close to the city.Do you mean the west side of Chicago?|`|bf3ca50b05cfac5b70624a2d5ea3e6ddaa	Depends how far in west Chicago.  Most of Chicago, if you live in and work in the city, you don't need a car - in fact, it's more inconvenient to have one than to have one, because of the expense of insurance and parking.  The few times you'll need a car you can rent one or use one of the ZipCars that are available for a fee at places in the city.  On the west side, it depends how far west you are - but, for example, if you're anywhere near an L stop on the Blue or Green lines, you wouldn't need a car.|`|wdaoaa1gaa	will you be in the city?  West Chicago is not the city of Chicago.  It's a suburb.  So yes, you need a car.|`|VELnLnIKaa	dude you need a car|`|y96i0vfUaa	Lincoln Park, Lakeview, Wicker Park<br>  <br>  Anywhere off the Red or Blue line is great anytime. The Brown line runs through nice ares but doesn't run all night. The Clark bus runs all night. (goes through Lincoln Park and Lakeview.) The Chicago Bus runs all night, but don't live too far west. Same goes for the Belmont bus.<br>  Western bus runs all night and hits the Blue line at two spots, but I'd say keep it northern.<br>  If living on the west side is importan,t try to stay east of Kedzie near Chicago or a Blue line stop. <br>  Taxis are hard to come by west of Western
2b6bec3d7f2fe8f5707c7d178253ef15aa	I don't think you are looking to rent a vehicle. <br>  <br>  Use the Super Shuttle <a href="http://www.supershuttle.com/default.aspx?content=HowItWorks" rel="nofollow">http://www.supershuttle.com/default.aspx...</a> Its the easiest and most cost effective.|`|392fb9fe3924e0ea502b517efe20098daa	Tampa to Clearwater is less than an hour drive.  I am assuming you are flying into Tampa.  Renting a car with 5 people plus luggage will require a large car, van or suv - unless you all pack very light.  It may possibly be cheaper to rent 2 small - intermediate cars.
8vKrxSYyaa	Research has found that Hypnotherapy is an effective therapeutic intervention for a fear or phobia of flying. Cognitive Behavioural Therapy has also been fairly successful, however this would be costly and would consist of a few sessions whereas hypnosis could only be two sessions.<br>  <br>  You could use informal Cognitive Behavioural techniques yourself with her by stating that you have been on a number of plane flights yourself and found them comfortable while reminding her of the rewards she has made by taking a risk.<br>  <br>  Show her brochures or websites of France showing her that it would be a worthwhile visit.  You could also buy or download relaxation tapes which would be of good use during the flight if she gets anxious.<br>  <br>  Whatever you do don't watch the film 'Alive' prior to take off.|`|uxCRk3BSaa	Tell her it will be find ( remember to bring gum for the take off) and to bring something to do on the airplane|`|RAzCYBolaa	I flew to Spain in the summer last year and had exactly the same problem. I'd never flown before and I was SO scared. The worst bit is taking off. If you've already flown before, I suggest that, before you go, you take her through a step-by-step 'talk' of what will happen during take off and landing. Eg. Seatbelts, the safety talk, etc.<br>  <br>  Also, give her a mint to suck when taking off. It calms nerves and prevents ear popping during take off :)
XLQ9wCUaaa	1. London - seems like one of the coolest places in the world. Had the best time there when I went on a trip in high school. So much culture, so many people, and I never got to go to the clubs or see any live acts besides one play so that would be awesome.<br>  <br>  2. Glasgow & 3. Edinburgh - Scotland seems so beautiful, I watch shows about it on the travel channel and the landscape seems gorgeous. The people & culture also seem really interesting.<br>  <br>  4. Dublin - Ireland, again, seems really pretty. I also have heard there's a lot of nightlife & culture in this city for young people. <br>  <br>  5. Sheffield - I don't know why. I saw it in a few movies and it seems pretty. Upon researching it I found out it's on of the 'greenest' cities with lots of trees. Compared to where I live it has a lot of commons and public places as well. I'd like living anywhere in the UK though~ :)|`|lyDzjMfcaa	In no order:<br>  <br>  1. Harrogate - It seems a very quiet and nice place to live.  It has a chilled vibe to it.  There aren't many chavs roaming the streets unlike where i live and there are many nice places to eat and drink there.  It is pretty expensive though!  It was named as one of the most desirable places to live recently.  <br>  <br>  2. London - There is so much to do in the capital.  Also there are much more job opportunities.  I don't need to say why London is a great place!  I'd only live there if i was in a decent spot though as London can be one of the most dangerous cities in the UK at times.  <br>  <br>  3. Buxton - The place seems very nice, quiet and friendly.    Its also near the beautiful Peak District, Derby and Manchester.<br>  <br>  4. Nottingham - It's a compact city full of friendly people.  The nightlife is great and there are lots of interesting shops in the centre.  It feels more like a big town.  It's also has lots of countryside and forest! (not the garbage football team).  <br>  <br>  5. Alderley Edge - Well because the houses seem very nice!  Its one of those places only the stinking rich footballers and tv stars live!
rUvaitfLaa	Not knowing your age, or whether or not you have a family, it's really a decision to make on your own.  The summers are excruciatingly HOT, the temps can get up to 121 in the middle of summer, and that's in the shade!  The worst weather happenings are high winds, heat warnings, and flooding.  Gambling, drinking, and clubs are big deals here.  <br>  I, personally am not into the club scene nor do I go to the casinos much, and locals tend to stay away from the Strip due to the tourist traffic.  <br>  The surrounding areas can be fun: Mt. Charleston, Red Rock, Valley of Fire, Spring Mountain Ranch, Lake Mead, Lake Las Vegas, Laughlin, Lake Mojave, Bonnie Springs Ranch, etc.  Not to mention you are a short drive away from Utah (St. George 2 hours) and California (Los Angeles area 4 hours).|`|Vz5vjAWRaa	I think it will be fun up to a point, hope your not a gambler because vegas will take you under.. I think the henderson and green valley area are the best locations.|`|eWk2AMsVaa	I am a newbie here. I don't gamble or do the club scenes. I do enjoy just walking the strip because it is still new to me, but only during the day. I don't like the high winds. I moved from Dallas so the heat does not bother me, because it is dry. I do love the mountains and the scenery. Like what was mentioned there are many places to go around the area and not far. I go to LA quite abit. The economy is bad, so you may get a good deal on a condo. But some of the condos are changing to apartments, so watch out. I find it hard meeting peolpe. I don't know where you are moving from, but they are not friendly here like Texas and Georgia. Good luck.|`|AA11536773	People either love it or hate it here. I love it. It's VASTLY different from being a tourist here though. If you're looking for a small-town feel, you will NOT find it here. Very few people actually know their neighbors. As far as crime goes, it ain't Mayberry.|`|AA10240904	Vegas is in the middle of the Mohave Desert, hot in the summer and cold in the winter but no four seasons.  Prices are high likes CA though there is not State income tax.  People either love or hate living here.  My decades show I love being a lizzard|`|i3PGjRRfaa	LOTS of trailer courts in Vegas...........|`|Vm54QPg7aa	Just depends on what your version of fun is.  It's a city where you can be completely independent and without limitation on your activities - but you won't find a real sense of community no matter how hard you try.  I liked the liberation of it for a few years and then did a 180 and decided I missed the community of my hometown in the Midwest.  It IS sunny just about everyday and it's great to take a drive on some of the desert roads outside the city to California, Utah or Arizona.  The local economy is pretty slow right now, but housing prices are dirt cheap and you can find some amazing deals which would be a great investment if you plan on staying for more than 3 years or so. There are foreclosed condos in my community listed for sale for under $40K.<br>  Good Luck!|`|CnAkw9tgaa	Born and raised, parents were as well. Most people don't stay in Vegas it seems, most people tend to be a-holes. It's not the friendliest of cities. Fast-paced city. You won't be living on the strip so that's sort of irrelevant, although i'm sure you'll deal with your fair share of tourists, AND CALIFORNIA DRIVERS, which you'll probably want to kill. <br>  Whether or not Vegas is a fun place to live depends on what you like to do for fun. Ie, I like to ride horses and compete in evens for fun, but Las Vegas doesn't really offer anything along those lines, so my fun is very limited. If you enjoy clubbing or just general social time, drinking, dancing, whatever, then Vegas might suit you.|`|9O0fPOV3aa	I lived there for 9 years man!<br>  its hott, so if you dont like hottness (and im mean hot) please dont move there.

rUvaitfLaa	Check out Tao at Venetian, Jet at Mirage, Playboy Club at The Palms, or Christian Audigier at TI.

There is Cherry @ Redrock we go there often and love it! The clubs on the strip are usually packed so it depends on what kind of scene you are into.

Its laid back and has 2 floors so ur not as crowded and sometimes they will open the patio so u can look out from the 26th floor!!  The music is great and the drinks are reasonable considering it is a club!!  Happy Birthday!!|`|nZmLycrXaa	Pure at Caesar's, Tao at Venetian, and Privé at Planet Hollywood.

fFnsJ7maaa	The statue itself closed after 9/11 for security reasons. It hasn't reopened because the Park Service claims it lacks fire safeguards and adequate exits. Which is true. If you've ever been up to the crown, it's a long, slow process up a very narrow winding staircase. There are only a few places to cross over to the down spiral. Not for the faint of heart.

I (as a solo female traveller) have stayed there few times and love its cleanliness and safety.  It is located just near to the exit of main station/mrt/hi speed rail.  It is so near tat it take u about 20 steps from the entrance of the building to the entrance of underpass leading to the main station.  Therefore u dun have to worry tat it will be quiet when u return to your hostel and no worries about the rain since u can simply dash to the building from the mrt exit.  There is a convenient store on the first level and the first few storeys of the building are actually a shopping mall.  Therefore it can be quite crowded during the weekends. Behind the building of where the hostel is situated, there served many types of food whose price are catered to students since there are alot of tuition center/school nearby. The hostel is strategically situated and I simply to stay there whenever I was there.  All my friends love my recommendation.  So why waste the money to stay at hotel when u can have your own room in the HI hostel?  The boss is friendly and warm.  Sometimes he may just throw a welcome party in the evening if u r lucky.

Tshirts are fine for lounging around the house or going to the mall, but when you are visiting the seat of power for the nation (and possibly the world), it's a good idea to dress a little nicer.

Ic8FLXm5aa	"He said that several of the houses served with demolition orders were built before 1967, when Israel captured east Jerusalem from Jordan during the Six Day War but that numerous extensions have been built since."<br>  <br>  During 1967 Israel capture land that was occupied by the Egyptian arabs and the Jordanian arabs. Anybody who wishes to build a settlement or building in east jerusalem, Jewish or Not needs a notice. There is a reason for this. During the wars, many Jews were kicked out and ethnically cleansed from these locations. Jordan told many arabs to settle in these places where Jews lived. You do not see the Jewish villages from before because they were taken down by Jordanian forces.<br>  <br>  Therefore this is not where you should have been looking in the article. READING IS FUNDAMENTAL.<br>  <br>  ""I built my house a year and a half ago," he said. "I asked for a permit but never received authorisation.""<br>  <br>  Here is the line you should have told us. Clearly Israel does not want an arab majority in these areas or the Arab population to GROW in these areas.<br>  <br>  "Israel, which considers the whole of Jerusalem its "eternal, undivided" capital rarely grants building permits to Arab residents of east Jerusalem, which the Palestinians want to make the capital of their promised state"<br>  <br>  Another line you should have used. A fight between peoples for a capitol.|`|lvWqfnfpaa	Don't forget that Israeli soldiers enter Palestinians house and live there for a few days, leave then come back. Sometimes they dont even the kids enter when they;re coming back from school. Its crazy<br>  <br>  Tell this to America, Israeli will start crying and be like "No one cares about us...waaah!"|`|9QBlKlFmaa	In fact, Israel regularly demolishes the homes of Jews that were built without permits.<br>  <br>  This is a very rare occasion, when Israel applies the law equally to Arabs, who are ordinarily treated with kid gloves and are not subject to punishment for their violations.<br>  <br>  <br>  .|`|B5Y46XBoaa	What's your source? Or is this just more of the same anti-Israel propaganda from another Imperialist Arab shill?|`|lEo7yl7Oaa	and what about the last 8 years of palestinians sending rockets into israel for no reason. and them agreeing to give the land to israel and then fighting them and trying to run them out of it. or the president of their stating that he would wipe out all jews and christians and america and israel. what about him saying to "destroy them as a nation, that the name of Israel be remembered no more." what about israel's right to the land since the beginning of time.|`|iCMrsV9daa	They never answer questions directly. They either claim that its an invalid source "arab propaganda" or they throw it back at you by asking a dozen questions. Forget about every other nation in the world right now, we are talking about Israel. Answer the question simple and truthfull- why does ISrael do this? Because they need more houses, because their population is increasing and they need to expand, because they want to make the most of it now before any sort of peace process or land exchange. <br>  <br>  Why does Israel do this? Because there is nobody to spank her for it thats why.|`|YfUuV87kaa	I am close to fuming when I see the lack of knowledge demonstrated by my Jewish brethren!<br>  <br>  It is all part of the Masonic plan!

Why aren't they absorbed by their ever so caring Arabic neighbours? (Who refuse to pay the Palestinian Authority the pledges they have made.)<br>  <br>  <br>  Let Egypt have that basket case called Gaza, let the 'west bank' Palestinians move to Jordan.<br>  <br>  <br>  Why is it valid to ignore the historical Jewish territorial area but valid to accept 'historical' Palestinian claims?<br>  <br>  <br>  Why is the State of Palestine solely made up of area under Israeli control?<br>  (Gaza was formerly under Israel's control)<br>  <br>  <br>  Why isn't Trans Jordan, Egypt, Syria or Lebanon obliged to relinquish territory to this mythical state called Palestine?<br>  <br>  <br>  Why are there no border disputes between the Palestinians and the other Arab States?<br>  <br>  <br>  Why not take arbitrary amounts of land from each neighbor including the other Arabic states?<br>  <br>  <br>  Is it because Palestine is simply a vehicle to deny Jewish ownership?|`|nHuMeLtyaa	Because they can.  Do you think that the Arabs would behave differently if the situation was reversed?  Probably.  They'd kill all the Jews.  I'm not saying it is a righteous thing to do, but what do you expect from a government that wants all the land it can grab before a Palestinian state is declared.|`|YSK2PbAEaa	The asker states, "It is a wonder Palestinians get angry with Israel."<br>  <br>  You have it wrong.  The Arabs get angry with Israel because they just will not tolerate a Jewish presence in the Middle East.<br>  <br>  The Arabs will not be satisfied until they have driven the Jews into the sea.<br>  <br>  Any other claim is merely a pretext for their hatred.<br>  <br>  <br>  .
c64cfd32e7e9ba18e3ede6c7a2b89932aa	The Bronx - named after Jonas Bronck a Swedish born Dutch sea captain who seltted about 500 acres of land. Dutch and English settlers referred to the area as "Bronck's Land.  Another explanation for the use of the definite article in the borough's name is that the original form of the name was possessive: The Bronck’s or The Broncks’ (referring to the family).<br>  <br>  <br>  Brooklyn - was named after the Dutch town of Breukelen<br>  <br>  Manhattan - The name Manhattan derives from the word Manna-hata, as written in the 1609 logbook of Robert Juet, an officer on Henry Hudson's yacht Halve Maen (Half Moon).  The word "Manhattan" has been translated as "island of many hills" from the Lenape language. The Encyclopedia of New York City offers other derivations, including from the Munsee dialect of Lenape: manahachtanienk ("place of general inebriation"), manahatouh ("place where timber is procured for bows and arrows"), or menatay ("island"). <br>  <br>  Queens - was supposedly named for the Queen consort, Catherine of Braganza (1638-1705), the Portuguese princess who married King Charles II of England in 1662.<br>  <br>  Staten Island - Henry Hudson established Dutch trade in the area and named the island Staaten Eylandt after the Staten-Generaal, the Dutch parliament.

W2rZ44Keaa	It was probably due to the fact that you are driving at an inclined level. Usually when you are driving up a hill or mountain cars tend to not drive as well because it is more work for them to push up the hill and keep from rolling backwards. It's just like if you were trying to run up a hill you get tired faster and you tend to slow down. Same for the car. Those mountains might be steeper than normal too.|`|THkLe78Waa	You obviously have never drove on any hills before.|`|PEMnzRnvaa	because you were driving up a mountain
W2rZ44Keaa	If you go straight down to Southern California you waill only cross Washington-Oregon border and the California-Oregon Border. You could take detour from Northern California through to Nevada, then from Nevada to Arizona then stright over to Southern California. Your choice. But for a warning Nevada drive is terribly boring. Make it worth it by maybe stopping in Las Vegas or Reno. You could also swing by the Grand Canyon if you like its on the way.|`|WWQ4PAdJaa	Well, if you looked at a map you would see that the only states you need to cross are Washington, Oregon and then California. You would be going out of your way if you went to Nevada, unless you plan to stop in Vegas or something.|`|HgHWywJIaa	you're going to pass from washington to oregon then california. thats it. you wont cross nevada|`|jLTDqVHsaa	Via I-5 or US-101, just Washington, Oregon, and California.<br>  <br>  Other routes can theoretically take you through Idaho, Nevada, or Arizona (or any other state, for that matter), but these don't make much sense unless you are visiting something in one of those states.  In that case, that might be a very good idea!|`|8IfePMa3aa	Oregon. You can take I-5 all the way down. I suppose if you wanted to go to Nevada you could, it's a waste of time though.

jLTDqVHsaa	I can't tell you much about the private schools there, as I have never attended one.  I also can't compare to "Gossip Girl," as I don't watch the show.  However...<br>  <br>  The private schools obviously cost more than the public schools.  Some are more expensive than others.  Some of the people are ridiculously rich in some of the schools.  In other private schools, not as rich.  Some are good, and some are terrible (as referenced by the poster ~SNU~ above).<br>  <br>  As for the public schools, well, that varies from neighborhood to neighborhood, and from school to school.  It also depends on staff; I've seen good schools go sour after a new principal takes over.  Of course, there are a few "specialized" public high schools, requiring entrance exams, scattered throughout the city.  They are competitive, and loaded with advanced-placement programs.<br>  <br>  That said, there are also the regular neighborhood high schools.  Some are great, some are not, and some are in transition.  I was very happy with my neighborhood high school; it was close to home, so I had time to participate in numerous extracurricular activities and meet some great people.  The school had numerous AP programs, which greatly lessened my college course load later on.  I also ended up earning a full academic scholarship to my top-choice college.  Some of the school's students weren't so great, but there was definitely a focus on the many, many students who wanted to learn.  I thoroughly enjoyed my time in the local neighborhood public high school.<br>  <br>  So, consider your location, consider your budget, consider what your future plans might possibly be (though they are probably still quite fuzzy at this age, which is fine - mine were too, as are most students).  Then, start doing some research about your options, look at websites that review schools and have parents and students actively discussing the schools.  Look for a school that has happy, motivated students, a variety of course options, extracurricular activities, a good staff, and some school spirit.|`|rLiyrhCdaa	Noway jose. first off, the really great school such as: Dominican Academy, Xavier, Marymount, Regis etc; are all boy or all girl schools. So even though they do combine schools for drama and such there still isn't that "boy friend girl friend" drama. PLUS, schools like that have a very low tolerance policy on drama, gossip, cattiness so on.  So the things that go on on gossip girl are very unlikely to go on in an actual school in nyc. <br>  <br>  As far as everyone being that rich- To be perfectly honest, in order to live in nyc, you have to be rich. Everything here is much more expensive then it is in other states. Homes, restaurants, bars, grocery items, and school expenses. So unless they have a school scholarship, the kids are most likely well to-do. <br>  <br>  There are not many public school in Manhattan its self, but some of the best schools are located right outside.|`|9e3125f1cbec258838efea7ac306d1c1aa	"are they really like the one in "gossip girl"? are the people really that rich?"<br>  <br>  They are not that different than expensive private schools elsewhere - Gossip Girl is an exaggeration.  Some of the private schools cost as much as $30K per year, so the people who go to them are mostly very rich.<br>  <br>  "and how are the public schools there too? which ones do you suggest?"<br>  <br>  There are some very good special public schools that you have to take a test to get into (like Hunter, Stuyvesant, and Bronx Science), but most of the regular public schools are pretty bad.<br>  <br>  To find good public schools you have to go to the suburbs.|`|kD6M3Banaa	I go to a private high school in NYC. Upper east side in fact. Absolutely garbage. Everyone does drugs and sees a shrink.
bR5Dzulsaa	I come from a very poor area and teenage parents are common.<br>  <br>  But I only know one person that was a parent at that sort of age.<br>  <br>  My mother's a teacher in a local comprehensive school (Ysgol Gyfun Cwmtawe). Out of the blue she became pregnant with my baby sister. At the same time as she was going through pregnancy a pupil in her school that was 11 was going through the same thing. She was 12 when she gave birth to the boy. She had been impregnated when she was in Primary School. The boyfriend was 15. How scary is that?<br>  <br>  I don't know how they're doing now. But it was a bleak situation.<br>  <br>  I'm 18 now. When I was in Primary School I was in a class with 7 boys and 9 girls. Out of the 9 girls, 6 of them now have kids. They're 18!<br>  <br>  This is what years of English ignorance towards Welsh matters results in. Also, in my county, 1/8 girls 15-25 years old have gonorrhea.|`|gk4cclFKaa	Cwmtawe sounds like a Swansea name.

cL7btvi9aa	Are you happy about July 4, 1776? Im not but im sure you are. Its the same thing. Canada achieved independence to a degree. America had to fight a long war that left many people dead and caused the British to HATE them until World War I. Canada on the other hand peacefully achieved confederation with a series of laws passed by Parliament that left Canada and Britain to be great allies for over 100 years.|`|2wyDALHgaa	I think you are essentially asking if Canadians are proud of their country and what it stands for?  I do think so although they are a bit more quiet and reserved about it compared to how our cousins to the south view their country.  And I'm NOT saying the US view is wrong, just that ours is different. <br>  <br>  As to how Canadians may view that particular date in our history I think that many would be hard pressed to let you know what that date means.  In my opinion, Canadian history is not something that we teach enough of in schools these days and what we do teach gets drowned out by US popular culture through our TV and media.  More Canadian kids could tell you what the Fourth of July means then the First.|`|f9No4eRBaa	It's neither happy or sad.<br>  No different than an American thinking about July 4th.<br>  <br>  It's our culture and the make up of Canada.<br>  If anything, it makes us proud to be a citizen of this country and you see it when travelling abroad. It's a known fact if you have a Canadian Flag on your jacket or backpack, people will treat us with more respect than other nationalities.|`|JWvkEN7taa	I totally agree with Justin.<br>  And yes we are proud, just like you Americans are for July 4....

2HETgiwgaa	Kia ora <br>  <br>  (literally 'be well' or 'be heathy' - just like: kia kaha means 'be strong')<br>  <br>  As a kiwi, I've met a few Canadians, and can honestly say I've liked them all.  And yes, I can tell the difference (usually) between a Canadian and an American accent :-).  I'd say most kiwis like Canadians - and, as a country, we've got a reputation for being friendly toward everyone.<br>  <br>  I love living here.  You can get to the beach and the mountains on the same day if you want to - ski and surf.  Just like the song, you can get four seasons in one day.  Great things about NZ:  the scenery (including the view out to the Pacific from the front room of my house), the people (including my friends, family, and the great people I get to work with), the cultures (indigenous and imported), the Saturday sports (school kids kicking around rugby and soccer balls), tramping through the national parks (with a good supply of scroggin in your backpack), camping with friends, summer evening bbqs, chocolate fish and real fish (blue cod is my fav), AND the weird and wonderful wildlife (weta, kiwi, kea, tui...).  <br>  <br>  See the links for what other people love about NZ - and check out the ad from YouTube - directed at NZers, but the 101 must-dos for Kiwis (and 101 Kiwi secrets - see the link to the AA) are worth checking out for visitors, too.<br>  <br>  Haere mae (welcome) - come on over :-)|`|68ee405bb00c52b1f70ed3481fd154f2aa	I am sure that the Kiwis have a great respect for Canadians,,, as many will be aware that your troops fought along side theirs ( and ours.. I'm an aussie) in both world conflicts... JUST make sure that you state that you are Canadian and not american ( they may get your accents confused ) <br>  <br>  New Zealand is a great nation and for it's size and population .. one of the guttiest on this planet... If i were to be any other nationality IT would be Kiwi,.<br>  <br>  They were among the first nations ( like Canada) to give women the vote.<br>  Kiwis are GOOD PEOPLE ( least the ones that I have met )|`|ZG0AR1fXaa	If you travel to NZ you MUST stay in Queenstown for a while.

You'd love it. :)|`|bpMBiL9Xaa	I think before you go you should learn where NZ is! It is not in Aussie!!!<br>  <br>  Go visit a Marae to see Maori culture<br>  <br>  There are heaps of cultures here and I don't think most people think anything in particular bout Canadians.<br>  <br>  Kia Ora translates to 'be well'|`|AA11441385	Spectacular scenery and lots of sheep.
uU3iFayYaa	Dutch social class distinction is markedly different from class stratifications in say, the UK or USA. Being the most densely populated country in western Europe, housing types are not the most important social marker.<br>  <br>  The urban conglomerate in the western part of The Netherlands, called the Randstad (which loosely translates as 'urban edge') is very popular and a studio apartment in a posh neighbourhood in that area may sell for well over € 700,000. As such, it's not so much the type of housing, as it is the neighbourhood that determines one's social class. For instance, a large 19th c. farmhouse and few acres of land in the relatively sparsely populated north of the country, can be bought for less than € 350,000. <br>  <br>  The Dutch don't have what you might call a suburbia tradition; since space is at a premium there isn't very much 'suburbia' to be had anyway. So moving away from the cities doesn't count as social improvement in the way it does in places like Greater London or the US East Coast.<br>  Another factor that must be taken into account, is the Dutch tax system that refunds your mortgage interest, so it's relatively easy for low-income families to buy a house.<br>  <br>  As a very general rule of thumb you might say that every house in the € 75,000 - 125,000 price bracket is a low-income dwelling, whereas anything in the € 125,000 - 450,000 price range can be considered medium income. Houses starting from € 500,000 - and upwards are high-income properties. The standard rule for Dutch mortgage banks is that you cannot loan more than five times your annual income before taxes. You do the math.|`|vcATtojoaa	I dont have a link, but heres the basics:<br>  Really, the housing is the same for all three levels, it its the space that differs. All the houses are either Townhouses, apartments, or small stand-alones in the country. In general, the higher the class, the less neighbors one would have - the exception being small country houses, which could belong to anyone. An apartment would be lower class, a townhouse would be middle-upper middle class, and a split house or american-sized house would be VERY upper class.
6beL9zycaa	Ok, this is going to sound... obvious, but they differed because they were in different states, similar because they were all looking for the same thing:  GOLD.  Alaska was much more difficult to get in & out of than California, much harder to recover the gold.
818a6c4a96262d3d9669cd5c91b5efaeaa	An American passport?  If so, it takes 3 weeks by standard processing, 2 weeks if you pay the extra fee for expediting it and the express mail fees.  if you happen to live in or near a city with a Regional Passport office, you can call, make an appt, go , wit , and get your passport the same day at no extra fee.  Visas are completely different.  A visa is given to you by the country you want to visit through their embassy or consulate.  Some countries require a visa, others do not.  You can look on the site below, pick the country you want and click on it.  Then read under "Entry Requirements" to see if you need a visa or not.  If you do , there will always be a link there to follow for the embassy site so you can get visa application info.|`|70kvJrN1aa	it takes about week.
l9aXZ3poaa	Hitch-hiking would be free, but in this day and age is probably not the safest way to make the journey.<br>  <br>  I would guess that National Express coaches will be pretty cheap - particularly if you book them well in advance.  They are less comfortable than trains, and take longer - but in my experience (albeit a long time ago when I was a student) they were very cost-effective.<br>  <br>  Being inquisitive I just went to their website and found that the standard return fare for Liverpool / Bristol is about ￡40 and the journey time if you travel direct is about six hours.  It can be quicker if you take a service that changes in Brum.  And of course if you qualify for any of the discounts it will be cheaper still.<br>  <br>  www.nationalexpress.com<br>  <br>  BTW, Divine Diva makes a good point about walking - it would definitely be free.  And I might add that you could also swim the route - down the Bristol Channel, through the Irish Sea and then up the Mersey!  :-)|`|0115b8162e3b4d1bdce5ffb45890b1d8aa	National Express buses. you may have to change but this does not constitute a big problem. They take a bit longer than the train but he difference in cost is worth it. They have a loo on board and have to take statutory breaks for the driver but this is not a problem.

April is before the rainy season, you might get some but probably not much rain.

You can eat for as little as 35-40 baht from food carts and stalls, a decent meal from a small restaurant for 100-200 baht and a lot more at western style and hotel restaurants.

In the north the rainy season will just be starting.  In Bangkok and the south it will be in the rainy season so you can expect to see at least some wet weather.  Because of that, pack footwear that you can get wet - I recommend flip flops.  The temperature will be in the high 30's C during the day (90+ F) with relatively high humidity.  You should certainly bring swim wear,  sunglasses and some T-shirts and shorts.  You can buy clothes very cheaply so travel light and enjoy shopping.  If you are on a budget you can get by on 500 baht per day ($15 or so) but if you want an air-con room plan on double that.  Because it is the rainy season everything will be cheaper and quieter so it is actually a good time to travel.  Enjoy!|`|q7sX6ACraa	it depends where your going .. just regular "holiday/vacation" clothes shorts t.shirts swimming costumes etc i would recommend a hat also to keep your head from burning but you can buy it cheaper while your there .. you could also take other clothes because its sometimes cooler at night time.  <br>  you dont really have to take clothes for everyday either,most places have laundrettes that are cheap so you can just wash your clothes while your their and wear them again.|`|HANR0heUaa	Which part ? Normally, it is pretty   warm  there.You should bring only light clothes or cotton dresses. It would be if you purschase there. The price is very reasonable and it will be worthy as well. Currency ?

I also buy a bag to bring it all back in.<br>  <br>  Thailand will be very very hot in April, Make sure you get a hotel with air con.<br>  <br>  I always plan to take 5000 Baht a day not including your hotel...

This reinforced links between both french and lebanese elites as they were educated in the same highschools and then universities.|`|pO0p5O5zaa	It goes way back when they started colonizations, though I'm not sure they do love eachother.|`|WTFkqS3daa	Er, exactly what Marzetwo said... !! lol
dUpVqoB6aa	Australia needs to be careful with importing certain things because there are a lot of diseases and conditions that are not yet present in Australia and we need to make sure that we keep those diseases out of the country.For example we do not have rabies and a lots of other countries do.I guess it is better to have a good quarantine system then to battle with dieases.|`|AA12074269	Very difficult to do this are there are many more people who enter the UK on a daily basis and many more points (and ways) of entry. Australia and New Zealand are unique in that they are able to monitor and restrict entry to their countries and so protect their crops better.|`|AA11441385	Probably because Australia, because of its relative isolation, has managed to keep many diseases out.  No rabies, for example.  A breakdown in our quarantine regime has just resulted in our first ever outbreak of equine influenza.  We want to maintain this status.<br>  <br>  In the UK, the horse has well and truly bolted and there is no point applying strict quarantine.
wNw0AyI3aa	Not sure if you like walking?  If you did you could get a train from London towards the South coast and walk between two train stations - gentle hills, nice countryside, easy footpath and road walking, plus a pub (and ample time between trains) for lunch.  Did this for a friend's 40th a few years ago, can't remember the names of stations but l think they were on the line that goes to Arundel.  All you'd need to do is look at a map and you could work something out.  ￡50 should cover trains and food in a pub?<br>  <br>  Apologies if this doesn't float your boat ;-)

ypB3QDWNaa	Make the drive down to Flamingo, FL (SW of Homestead).  The drive takes you into the wild heart of the Everglades (1st link).  Then make sure you take the 'Loop Road' (2nd link).  And if you do the Loop Road, then you'll be going by Everglades City:  make the drive in and stay a night.<br>  <br>  The most amazing natural wonder in all of Florida is the Florida Keys.  Take the drive down to Key West, and the scenery will take your breath away.  Google-search these words: Bahia Honda State Park.

I don't really like SF that much and think the other two are way better. San Diego is going to be cheaper to live, but if your looking for a metropolis then L.A. is obviously where to be. If your looking to DJ techno then L.A. is good because it is so big with alot of places to go and do stuff like that. San Diego has unbeatable weather though, Dosent get as cold as L.A. but dosent get unreasonably hot either. SF is way expensive, weather is great, but it does have diversity so as far as techno there might be more places there. Im not extremely familiar with any of these things (teaching, DJing Techno) but i do know the city's except SF not very familiar with it. But I would be heading south. Hope this helps,

You also get to see the older fashioned towns and culture of Poland. The architecture there is marvelous. <br>  <br>  Among all of these things, I could go on and on forever about, the mountain view is the best. At first, you get overwhelmed with the view and that it is actually in front of you, and you can smell the fresh scent that just makes you feel light-weighted.|`|be8c12cdca22b46ac7dcd7d626901063aa	Never been there .|`|fcf427fccc8fa8230c38f4b869207e8aaa	beautiful town and very nice countryside.

qyATAaeXaa	I would recommend keeping your idealistic flatlander butt right where it is and staying the freak away from Vermont. If you can afford to live like that, then, by Jeezum, Vermont does not need you. Try New Hampshire or northern Mass instead. Go there and drive up their real estate prices. It's people like you who make livin' in Vermont unaffordable for those of us who do, or had to move because we couldn't afford it anymore.<br>  <br>  You're also like 16 (I looked at your other questions).

YvNCOYZZaa	This is the travel section, but I happen to have a PO Box, so I can offer you a little help.  <br>  <br>  The answer is that it depends.  My Post Office leaves me a pickup note in my box.  It's a pain because I have to wait in line to pick up my parcel. <br>  <br>  My old post office had lockers for packages.  They'd leave me a key and place my package in the locker.  <br>  <br>  If your po box is large enough, then they will leave it in the box.  <br>  <br>  The last two assume that the the package does not have a signature required option.  In which case, you would need to pick it up at the counter. Don't forget that the Post Office will only receive packages mailed via USPS or DHL.  No UPS or FedEx.

xUDPwUdIaa	israeli women are loud, and they tell it like it is. they are not pushovers and don't take crap.<br>  arieh said he will change 180 degrees and beat you....well he will probably change, but not beat you!<br>  he is returning to his home. right now he lives in a different society than he grew up, so he acts differently than he would than if he were on his home turf. so when he gets back to israel, you will probably see a side of him you didn't know. (personal experience on this one)<br>  when i first moved to israel i too was dating someone. he was completely different than the man i moved in with when i got to israel. he was just...different in israel. needless to say we are no longer together anymore because of this. so be careful. hopefully you will have better luck than i did!<br>  you need to have a tough skin to live here. don't be too sensitive. and if you think someone is rude, just give them a second chance. israelis are hard to get to know and can seem harsh and rude at first. but once you get to know one, thats a friend for life!|`|Ic8FLXm5aa	They don't like American Men.|`|eyJqrqn7aa	You will have to put up with Idiots like Steel and Arieah to get there.

Don't be scared! I would love 2 move to Cyprus..don't know why you fussing!|`|lcj1AKt1aa	People move every day and change schools. It will be hard at first but you will see that you will meet new friends.  Just be open and embrace new people.  Smile and say hello and that will draw people to you.  if you go around with a sour face you will discourage others from coming to you.<br>  <br>  You can still maintain contact with your friends through IM or any other medium.  You can also visit them occasionally although after a while the visits will get lesser and lesser as you get new friends and do new things.<br>  <br>  Alternatively, you can even let them come and visit you.|`|OXxKTM6vaa	Making new friends:<br>  <br>  You will make them at school, in you're new area and at any clubs you may decide to join. Try not to worry, just be confident and try to learn the language - this will help you.<br>  <br>  Keeping in contact with you're old mates:<br>  <br>  Skype is very good for keeping intouch with friends. Using this its free and you'll be able to see them on webcam (as long as you're friends have the internet).<br>  <br>  You'll be able to visit you're old friends when you visit England again to see friends & family too. Write letters and ocasionally phone them (depending on if you're parents let you). <br>  <br>  Overcoming being scared:<br>  <br>  Think about all the things you will gain, you will learn a new language, experience life in a new country and meet people you would have never met before. I know a girl that moved to Cyprus at a young age and although she found it hard at first (home sick) she agrees now that Cyprus offers her a better way of life. Which is always a good thing. The chances are you will go to a English speaking school & I'm sure if you got too upset about it all you're parents would consider moving back. This is always an option - something you could do when you're old enough if you wanted.<br>  <br>  The weathers alot better there, if you go to an expat school you will meet other people in the same situation as you, which should help you. Speak to you're mum - you're going through this together and it will help you both alot. <br>  <br>  Good luck & enjoy cyprus.<br>  <br>  Just think, free holidays for you're friends when they are old enough. Bonus.|`|X8yIFdwuaa	make sure u have their phone numbers, emails, etc.and keep in touch, maybe go visit a few times a year. u'll make tons more friends when u move and the new thing will wear off in no time, good luck!

I would be happy to help, feel free to email me.|`|FrErxv7aaa	Charlotte is fantastic.  I live here and have a 2 year old.  I have lived in the Carolina's my entire life.  I recommend settling down north of Charlotte, near Lake Norman.  There are tons of things to do, especially in the spring, summer, and fall.  There are state parks all around and free kid's activities, or really cheap ones almost every weekend.  Water parks, the whitewater center, Carowinds, zoo's, the mountains are 2 hours away and the beach is 3.5 hours away.  Bike paths are everywhere and we go hiking and camping at least twice a month at the park 15 minutes up the road.  Good luck in making your decision!  I can't imagine a better place to raise a family!|`|ZTkvCVN1aa	If you're talking about Charlotte, NC, then there are a lot of things for 2 and 4 year olds to do. In the middle of uptown, there is a museum called Discovery Place where there is an Imax and and planetarium, and all sorts of exhibits that teach children about animals, their bodies, etc. There is also a place called Carowinds, which is a HUGE amusement park/ water park. It's open almost year-around--in October it turns into a scare-park, and in November there are festivals for Thanksgiving, and in December they have things like ice skating, and Disney characters on ice. Also in Novemeber there is something called the Renaissance Festival which is a great family event that takes you back in time to the Renaissance Era. Your kids will love the princesses and kings and pirates and elves walking around! There is also a jousting show and they have great food! There are numerous parks around the area, no matter where you live! Also, there are a lot of elegant restaurants for you and your wife, and if you're looking for an unforgettable night out on the town look no further than uptown's wonderful Bars and Clubs!

bf3ca50b05cfac5b70624a2d5ea3e6ddaa	Well, Alinea is an exception even in fine food places.  It's a very strange arrangement of very unusual types and placement of foods.  Each serving - and there are about fifteen of them - is tiny.  How you eat it is often *explained* because it can be very strange and unusual.  And there are about ten minutes between portions so the entire meal takes about three hours.  It's sort of an experience - almost like going to an art museum.  Delicious, but in sort of an unusual way.  <br>  <br>  Bit of advice, don't bother with the wine tasting pairing.  They do a tremendous job pairing the food with the wine, but since the servings of food are so small, you'll do little more than have a sip of wine, and you'll end up with fifteen glasses of wine in front of you over the course of the dinner.  What I'd recommend is asking the server for a single glass of really superb wine that goes with the largest serving - that way you can use it throughout and enjoy the food instead.<br>  <br>  If you want to try a really superb fine food restaurant that is more of a traditional restaurant, I'd recommend Tru.  You'll enjoy Alinea, but it will be one of the more unusual places you'll ever go to, food-wise.

I like the wind in my hair, the wide open spaces! How can such beauty be unknown to the common world? My favorite word of all time is, "Play." the four most wonderous letters in the alphabet into one word that speaks numerous joys out to the crys of youth and childhood. Oh, did i mention my names Hildegard Alexandra Robusk? I was voted most likely to die alone in the year 2008. And let me just say, I have not died. And I... am alone. I am the complete OPPOSITE of the word platitudinous. I've had a crush on Bill Nye ever since I first saw him on my 2nd grade video. I wish to marry that young lad. I have 4 cats, all named after my grand ancestors. One named Bertha, Jilusephit, Gredle, and Sniffles. Sniffles was my great great great great great grandma and since they couldn't speak fluent sentences, her name was Sniffles.<br>  Ive recently painted all the walls in my house gray, to match my exuberant personality!<br>  And in conclusion- the clubs are LASDA and FOXX.

As a 'native' I have no problems with people from any race however I do think its rude when people want to come to Australia from any country and do not want to respect our language and our culture. Australia is a beautiful place and when people want to come here they should be respectful if they want respect from the people who live here. I have found that people (natives) are almost never recist even when they are alone, they have no need to be and majority of Australians are respectful of people from other countries.|`|NuUMDTrTaa	The main racism in Melbourne is from immigrants and refugees who won't accept the Australian lifestyle, and want to keep up their old nations prejudices.

bb1d785305d9940f30a4ac0ee52a9957aa	Venice is gorgeous, but just a few people live there, the majority lives in Mestre and commutes there for work. It's not the most lively place for nightlife, even if there is a famous university, but if you are looking for bars, osterie and restaurants, rather than clubs, than it's fine.<br>  A problem affecting the city is Acqua alta (high water=flooding), which causes several problems.<br>  Regarding living in Italy in general, the quality of life is high, you can enjoy, as you already know, good food, wine and visit many beautiful places. <br>  The problems are mainly linked to the crisis that the country has had for 15 years, now. The economy is stagnant and it's not easy to find a job, especially if you are a young graduate.<br>  I'm 29 and many of my friends haven't managed to get a good job, even if they have 1st class degrees from good universities or, in some cases, masters. Nepotism affects many aspects of the daily life, from getting a job to getting favors. This cripples many who simply don't know the 'right' people.  <br>  The Catholic church has a great influence on the government and the Pope is often seen on the telly, talking each Sunday from his balcony at the Vatican, but for many people he is not important at all. Do not believe that everybody goes to church every Sunday etc. in many cases is more of a tradition rather than a sincere faith, especially for the younger generations.<br>  Television programmes are generally quite c@@p. They are mainly targeted to an older audience on the national channels and to a younger one on the Mediaset channels (except for Rete 4, which shows loads of South American soaps). Vulgarity is mainly the common factor. Now that Sky TV is widespread it seems that the level of free TV channels has gone down even more. <br>  People tend to groom themselves a lot and to be fashion-conscious. In smaller places they tend to check what you're wearing. It happens to me every time I go back home, as I'm originally from a town in Tuscany. I live in London and buy my clothes here, so people tend to look at me cause I'm wearing stuff that others don't wear. If your style is quite eccentric get ready for that. People tend to compliment on you a lot if you show some effort in looking after yourself. Many are really sporty, they go to the gym or are part of a sport team. People also tend to look younger than their British counterparts for this reason.   <br>  Politics is really important for many and people tend to stick with friends who share the same views. It's usual to talk of politics with friends,  much more than in the UK. What you wear often reflects your political views. <br>  During the summer cities are empty because of the hot weather. In many workplaces there's no air conditioning and schools are closed for three months. The number of school days is the same as the UK, as in Italy we don't have half term holidays and Christmas and Easter holidays are shorter. <br>  It is very common to go home for lunch and have a longer lunch break, even if now in the bigger cities office workers tend to have UK-style working hours. <br>  I just spent the weekend with some friends of mine from Italy and they were complaining about the fact that we are adopting the worst sides of American and UK culture as fast food and binge drinking. Kids love MacDonald's, while adults tend to be more health conscious or are suspicious of 'foreign' food. There are many Chinese restaurants in many cities, but mainly people love to go to a pizzeria on a weekend with a bunch of friends, rather than try food they don't know. <br>  In general you can have a good life there and enjoy yourself a lot.People are friendly and tend to like British people.|`|oB9i7IQIaa	Live in Venice?Really expensive!!!<br>  it is an interesting "beautiful" city Venice,but because everything is lived on the waters,it is really slow!<br>  And overall the venicians are not that friendly,comparing to the rest of the region Veneto!<br>  it is fantastic and magical going there for a short holiday but i wont never live there,rather i would live in some little village or city around venice like Vicenza (the city of Palladio), Padova or Verona (the city of Romeo and Juliett).Anyway good luck!<br>  ciao.Luigi|`|3fHZOobiaa	Hi, I'm Italian living in Italy and I have to say something for the truth's sake...<br>  <br>  I like very much my Country, especially for the reasons that have maken it famous in the whole World:<br>  <br>  A very great historic tradition, the arts, the culture, the wine and food traditions, the style, but Italy is not only this, the Italy of 2009 has got a lot of economical, political and social problems:<br>  It has the financial crisis, but also first of it, the circumstances were not very beautiful: <br>  For example there is the Mafia, especially in Southern Italy that is the cancer of our society. There also is the Vatican which, because of its continual political interferences, makes Italy not a really lay democracy, moreover, today, there is a very big conflict of interests, and so a weak democracy; in fact our prime minister Silvio Berlusconi owns (directly or indirectly) the 90% of the Italian mass-media ( even if Law doesn't allow to own a bigger part than the 20%) , so in Italy there isn't a completely free press and information in general. Berlusconi has been indicted for corruption too, but he has always managed to save himself thank many "ad personam" laws that are unconstitutional and that their lawyers ( who are also members of Parlament!) have maken for him... So, today we have got a criminal exempt to the Law, indicted for corruption, who has had contacts with mafia and who is more interested in his personal matters than in the Italian ones as Prime Minister! ( and the other members of his party are not better than him)...<br>  <br>  Unluckly a true opposition doesn't exist, because during the last elections a lot of left-parties don't manage to be members of the Parlament...<br>  <br>  But Berlusconi ( called " affectionately" the psyco-gnome) Doesn't owns only the 90% of Italian mass-media, but also: an Italian bank, one of the most important publishing houses ( Mondadori) and three insurance companies!<br>  <br>  These are something of the most important problems in Italy today but there are many other too...<br>  <br>  ---<br>  <br>  See:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?gl=IT&hl=it&v=LhOJc1JBpKI" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?gl=IT&hl=it...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?gl=IT&hl=it&v=mTfgtYg1_3A&feature=related" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?gl=IT&hl=it...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?gl=IT&hl=it&v=MW8iP38KiGc" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?gl=IT&hl=it...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?gl=IT&hl=it&v=_tlydL2UAlQ&feature=related" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?gl=IT&hl=it...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?gl=IT&hl=it&v=JMbr_gKDWx8" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?gl=IT&hl=it...</a><br>  <br>  Bye

Z6tqdAoGaa	To JonEff...Instead of doing your usual knitpicking at someone elses answer,why don't you READ the question,and answer it which as usual you have not done....in answer to this question,the answer is NO it is not cheaper to buy the tickets in America.The Americans do not have cheaper fares when flights orignate from the UK and therefore you will pay the stirling fare but the equivalent in dollars...had the flight been originating in America,then it might be that it could well be cheaper to buy it in the US as they will have access to certain fares that we will not have in the UK....just to summarise for JonEffs benefit,if a flight originates from the UK,then it is not cheaper to buy the ticket in another country....also,regarding New York,it does not matter whether it is JFK or Newark airport you fly to as you will find the fares are common rated(meaning fares to JFK and Newark are the same) which is something else JonEff does not seem to know.....I get the impression he knows very little about air fares.|`|fZjgIE9Baa	It doesn't depend what airport you fly to, it depends what airline you fly with. If you want to fly from the UK to New York, I suggest either US Airways, Delta Airlines, American Airlines, or British Airways.|`|AjEftvtaaa	To "Pilot" It does depend on what airport you fly to. You clearly know nothing about the airline industry if you think that.<br>  <br>  Its always allot cheaper to fly to a bigger airport, where there are more flights, more seats, and there for seats are cheaper to fill them, so check flight prices to London Heathrow, London Gatwick, Glasgow International, Manchester and maybe Birmingham as they are the main airports in the UK.<br>  <br>  There are flights from New York to small regional airports such as Belfast, Bristol and a few other small cities, but they will cost allot as flights are not frequent.
0ed3a47409dac89fe63086d50549f520aa	There are 15.4 doctors per 1000 inhabitants in Norway. This means there are about 65 people per doctor (but not in actuality, most GPs see several hundred up to about 2000 patients).<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.norden.org/webb/news/news.asp?lang=6&id=7639" rel="nofollow">http://www.norden.org/webb/news/news.asp...</a>|`|qq5nceCXaa	The figures from the OECD are 3,7 active physicians per 1000 inhabitants.<br>  <br>  According to the SSB (statistics Bureau) this equates to around 9.1 man years per 10,000 inhabitants, so obviously some are part time or are not active full time.

CljhO6z9aa	No. I'd say Greenwood is roughly 90% white, with the remainder being black. It is very suburban and has no culture whatsoever.
AA10662056	It's like 200-400g. It depends on each person how much they eat.<br>  <br>  Young boys eat so much, more than 400g.|`|ybpJUWRnaa	One normal serving size is considered to be 200g. of boiled white rice.|`|W8QpLEh8aa	3250 grains of rice/65 gram|`|55ef67a1ec3f06e6f365e48d4a54535faa	one or two bowls like this.<br>  <a href="http://kisyoku.hp.infoseek.co.jp/ns04.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://kisyoku.hp.infoseek.co.jp/ns04.jp...</a><br>  fat people eat three bowls!|`|WLufY6Qpaa	we usually eat a bowl of rice every meal.<br>  Young boys might have a refill.<br>  <br>  We have bowls for rice every home.
TccNUVu9aa	Nice weather, medium crime, nothing to do, but you are close to San Jose and San Francisco.|`|4dfbcf738541ddcd8d3291d2dbbb44deaa	Boring as dirt.One so so mall with big and dumb guards running around.I don't think they have any fun things to do.There's a nice lake near by,but I think that's Castro Valley.|`|910537da330152ad69b869eeff90d14eaa	ignore all the other posts- I've lived in Hayward for many years.<br>  <br>  Weather-wise, Hayward ranks up there with the best of the Bay Area- not too hot in Summer, and not too cool in Winter.  You'll see much of the same weather along the coastal bay corridor- cities like San Leandro, San Lorenzo, Hayward, Union City and Fremont all have similar weather patterns.<br>  <br>  Crime can be something to consider.  There are certain areas of Hayward that I'd deem dangerous to live in- places like the downown area (A and B streets where they cross Mission or Foothill).  Another rougher area is the Palma Ceia are off of Tennyson Road.  Keep in mind that there are perfectly SAFE places to live in Hayward with low crime rates- the Winton area near Southland mall, Hayward Hills by CSUH, as well as the Fairway Park areas.  I'd say that as with any city, location has much to do with crime.<br>  <br>  hmmmm... FUN things to do?  In Hayward?  lol... there's a redevelopment going on in downtown Hayward- a new theater as well as a few new nightlife spots (Bijou and Zuckerssuss) as well as a few old friends (Buffalo Bills Brewpub).  Thankfully, there are nearby options- Jack London Square up in Oakland, several pubs/bars in the Fremont area, and then you can just zip up to SF in about 1/2 an hour on I-880.<br>  <br>  I really didn't mind living in Hayward- good location and a real bang for your buck concerning real estate/rent.|`|inOXaZzIaa	There's a few hundred cities I would live in, in the Bay Area before I consider   Hayward.|`|R5LuKSUXaa	I think its ugly and pretty ghetto.  But thats just my opinion.  Check out city-data there is everything you need to know on there regarding crime etc...|`|42caeb5abf4bf84fd4e6be61249c66e3aa	ghetto|`|300ft41Taa	the weather is ok, but it's not that interesting of a place to be. it is known as a ghetto but it is very close to Berkley and San Francisco which are awesome places. <br>  i wouldn't say it's a dangerous place, but in general the east bay isn't the most safe place out of that area....

I can tell you places I liked.<br>  <br>  There is a lake to the north of town on the way to the high-speed rail.  I think it's called Lotus Lake.  <br>  <br>  There's wandering along the promenade by the Love River -- sometimes it's fairly lively in the evenings with young people.  <br>  <br>  I walked up into the hills in the northwest of the city to see a couple nice temples.  I think the main hill is called "da2 gou3 shan1" (sorry, I don't know the characters).<br>  <br>  There's a massive harbour, but that only may be interesting if you want to see/photograph dockworkers.<br>  <br>  You might find more on forumosa.com.  Or you could just buy a Lonely Planet and find all kinds of things.
cNFcb5Ekaa	you would think, wouldn't you. I guess you would just see a bunch of college prodigies ;) i am not sure, if i were to be accepted into oxford university, i wouldn't really stay there after i graduated. So, maybe, you might ^^<br>  sorry i couldn't help lol<br>  <br>  ~*Tear*~

o4JRsfOdaa	Today was a nice 69 degrees in Springdale, Arkansas and tomorrow thunderstorms. Man! :(|`|RMppfinbaa	Snowy and Slushy and Yucky in New York City, once you hit L.A expect to get a tan. The weather should go from terrible to great. Make sure you don't have summer tires on because the streets are icy in Manhattan, NYC.|`|2faae7b556bae8292adc7e81ca55ca8aaa	its going to be snowy and stormy, it willl be flooded|`|Nuuk1Nwtaa	Blustery and cold and generally miserable in NY, probably rainy in the places in between, and warm and sunny in LA by the end of April. You'll want to pack heavy winter clothes, and lighter spring clothes, AND summer clothes.|`|b5c7f6bef65d4f3c4f8ebc309eccc08aaa	Sometimes it Varies what part of America are you going
