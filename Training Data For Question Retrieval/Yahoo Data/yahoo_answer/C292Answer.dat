hQbUwLvwaa	Of course MC, and the reason they are unsigned legacy is because they speak the truth and the government controls the media. And when you say MC doesnt mean they are unsigned for example, Nas, Mos Def, Talib Kweli, Phife, Q tip. They are Emcees and they are signed. But a lot of people that listen to mainstream are to ignorant to know wat an Emcee is, cause if they did how could they be listening to mainstream?|`|SI4tURLNaa	MC<br>  Mainstream is all the same. money and hoes. no poetry or even lyrical skill. you cant even call it music or art. Hip Hop isnt about pimpin and ballin. its about free expression, poetry, and rhymes, which is what most mainstream rappers lack nowadays. its the reason why nobody takes hip hop seriously. it is pretty much a joke.|`|d7d40db1326dfd0a8f66a123f8655dd6aa	Def mainstream, cant stand underground i tried listening to Immortal Techqnique, Rakim, and some others and it sucked.

There's Rock-A-Doodle and James and the Giant Peach and Bed Knobs and Broomsticks. I don't think any of them are the film you're looking for but i thought i'd post it just in case|`|LS6zgscQaa	enchanted??<br>  when its first a cartoon then its realistic??|`|8yE2sYGeaa	That almost sounds like "Cocoon", but that's live-action
33kuw8Xbaa	I think she looked like a gussied up ho bag|`|AA10368887	I'm laughing at you for actually caring.|`|24Xy8qWtaa	Yeah it was a bit.. over the top to say the least.|`|bltgAc9Maa	She looks like a Christmas tree... covered up in snow.<br>  <br>  And if you think about it, the dress looks like one of the princesses costumes in any Disney movies, so being a Disney product herself (note that I use the word PRODUCT, not ARTIST), I guess it pretty makes sense if she wears it. Perhaps she just wants to say to the whole world, "Look at me! I'm a Disney kid."<br>  <br>  Oh well, better luck next time, Miley....!!!|`|e8lAALzgaa	I thought she looked great in it, it's definitely a unique dress.|`|QziBNh0Uaa	I think it's a pretty dress.|`|gYYGyYUAaa	yeah, i didn't like it at all. it's too shiny and poofy.|`|bJnCOx4haa	Miley is Miley. <br>  <br>  She does not look like a Christmas tree.

Her Lovely dress caught everyone's attention.<br>  <br>  Everyone wears whatever they want. No one tells you today that you look ugly with that shirt or pant. No said you makeup was 100lb. No one said your hair had a tumor in it. Leave her alone.|`|rdcUOa1zaa	i really dislike her so anythin i see on her im guna automatically throw away in the imaginary trash can in my mind.|`|bf2a3cdfd3a1c0386023cef0e5cd4b0faa	It's a bit over the top... but that looks really expensive.|`|SYWbaqjcaa	I hate people that dont like Miley, just because you guys are jealus|`|2c76d7eb5804cf4a63f2667d2bebcfbaaa	ya she is ******* crazy

wztEAVm2aa	you have to answer a lot of questions in one category and get best answer a lot.<br>  <br>  OBVVVVVVVVVVVVV|`|gp7qmHsMaa	Becoming a Top Contributor is fairly simple. You have to maintain a best answer rate of 10% and be a regular in the category. Once you get the badge, you have to make sure you keep on answering questions in the category in order to maintain it. Trust me. This is the third time I am a Top Contributor in a category. Previously, I have been a Top Contributor in the tennis category and the American football category.  At one point I was a Top Contributor in both tennis and American football simultaneously. It is not easy trying to maintain a Top Contributor badge in two or three categories.|`|wjA9ytO0aa	go to the y!a office and threaten to rob them if they don't give you top contributor|`|XZi4UJgGaa	Go to Yahoo Answers as often as possible. <br>  <br>  Answer A LOT of questions on one category as much as possible.<br>  Get yourself picked for best answers as much as possible . That means give lots of good answers so that people are more likely to pick you for best answer. Just keep logging in and answering tons of questions in one category. I used to log in everyday to answer questions and get lots of best answers. After a while, I become a top contributor.  <br>  <br>  Now I don't have it because I don't participate as often.<br>  <br>  Someone asked the same question so here is a link for you.<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AukKY1JKrjXMiJh39Om2DmEjzKIX;_ylv=3?qid=20070814050023AAT6lCZ">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a><br>  <br>  the Hamster on Yahoo Answers explains it for you. <a href="http://blog.360.yahoo.com/blog-d8pH0dcoRKeB12yOcnUQp.9VCFos?p=19664">http://blog.360.yahoo.com/blog-d8pH0dcoR...</a>|`|uDsXjzwjaa	You just have to answer a whole lot of questions in one specific category. If you stop answering a lot of questions in that category after you get the title then you will lose it. It just depends on who is answering the most questions.

I was always expected to be seen and not heard and that emotions were something you kept bottled up inside. I don't want my two kids growing up with the emotional issues that I have.
adLSRFrZaa	I tend to be attracted to women who share the same general interests as me, but who also have a different twist to their personality from mine.  That keeps a spark of intrigue there.|`|J7EWQHYJaa	Opposites may attract but not when it comes to these kindsa relationships in most cases... (except, of course, that their genders are opposites--or not)<br>  I mean if you had nothing in common of course you wouldn't want to date that person.. so yea, more so than not for your question..<br>  Besides, it can't be all the same.. hence the word "almost" in your question, which you've done right ;)<br>  So that's my answer.|`|XPrNrfuUaa	Before I met the guy that I'm currently talking to, I always dated guys that were unlike me and in fact the opposite of myself..... <br>  <br>  The guy that I'm currently talking to? We're similar to a T, and I think that's why I like him so much. I didn't know what it was like until now, but I think I def prefer that.|`|AA11974236	Depends.  Sometimes, you meet someone through mutual interests and really it's unlikely that anyone would share ALL my interests, isn't it?  So, don't make this a rule, or you might end up finding the exception.|`|LQpUQ3kFaa	When you have the exact same interests, you have a common ground to build your relationship on.  You could improve your relationship from spending more time together and your interests can grow deeper together.|`|iKUKDRAlaa	No. That would bore the hell out of me. I'm naturally competitive and slightly antagonistic (in a playful way) what in the world would we do or discuss?|`|WJLKjMDYaa	no! it would be so boring if you guys would agree on EVERYTHING and would gain no knowledge on other stuff! plus if you believe in science then you would say no, opposites attract!|`|5ClRKukTaa	sounds like boredom, you could prob do that by just looking into a mirror :-)|`|xsp64deAaa	Keep things interesting and go for the opposite interest.|`|BT1dbMICaa	yes i would|`|JlqGY4eCaa	absolutely .... u always know where to take her 4 fun|`|WbRuTjmFaa	Actually it feels kind of good to be two peas in a pod, yet you know that no two peas are identical.. they have major differences.. but in the end they fit perfectly into the neat little pod...<br>  <br>  Opposites attract, but do they stay together or not... interesting question, even with my head numb it seeks to be answered|`|1c83832e4e75e687e416ee7572b46990aa	yes.|`|WD9vYTTmaa	Yes because a lot of the stuff I like to do, like ride ATVS, snowmobile, white water rafting, outdoorsy stuff like that :P would be ideal if the guy liked to do that stuff too, cause then we can do them together<br>  <br>  :)|`|fn5ijdnIaa	Yes, because my interests are so rare to the general public. I feel like I'm always going to be lonely when it comes to what I really love and sharing it with people..<br>  <br>  ohwell.|`|lgIuhKN4aa	No... i think i'd get fed up with that. haha. <br>  It's good to have things in common... but it is also good to have things which we don't really understand about one another, if you know what i mean. XD|`|3942e77c035cfc36aa7643acff17d6bcaa	Sure, why not? I'd like to meet a female conspiracy nut job who pays their own way on dates.|`|0lYFHqJLaa	I would.<br>  If i have some things in common with the person it would be easier for me to start a conversation on something<br>  <br>  For example i like playing video games and paintball shooting .Not many guys like that in a girl.They prefer girly girls.The person i like right now loves video games and  so i don't think sound nerdy or dorky to him when i talk about it with him. <br>  <br>  Also to me its easier to talk to someone with similiar interests. =]<br>  <br>  well thats just my reasons why.|`|AA11430900	Well, it sure beats dating someone with the opposite and fighting about where you should go and what you should do.<br>  <br>  I've been down both roads and if you take someone with totally opposite interests, you eventually wind up doing things by yourself even if you don't break up.|`|Tg6DxG7zaa	nope... cos then i can't try anything new and i can't be outgoing because nobody will get me to go bungee jumping and we'd do the same thing everytime. boooring.|`|xONzLjdwaa	well i would not want her to be exactly like me but i would not mind some same personalities|`|GbxIb7sgaa	Not really|`|yTAYGZucaa	I would|`|hwDtWCAjaa	it would be kinda boring|`|VA3tGarQaa	Yes, we'd have loads to talk about.

sR7jM0UCaa	It's about child abduction. Below is a quote from Chris Daughtry about the song, "All These Lives".<br>  <br>  "This song I wrote with Mitch [Allan]. We didn't want to write about the same old thing. He brought up the theme of child abduction and it became a really deep and emotional song. A song shedding light on the people out there that do that sort of thing. As a parent, this hit close to home because no parent would want to go through that."<br>  <br>  Taken from : <a href="http://www.daughtryofficial.com/node/86681" rel="nofollow">http://www.daughtryofficial.com/node/866...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  " Doesn't come down when she calls,<br>  "It's time for breakfast."<br>  Momma can't get down those halls<br>  Fast enough to see<br>  Glass is sprayed across the floor<br>  From the broken window."<br>  - I think this part clearly show that someone broke into her house and took her child away but she was too late to prevent it from happening.<br>  <br>  "She can't breathe anymore.<br>  Can't deny what we know."<br>  - I'm getting two different meanings here. It's either that this is about the mother in pain about her missing child or it's about the child that can no longer deny of being taken away from her family.<br>  <br>  "They're gonna find you, just believe."<br>  - This is directed to the child. The child needs to believe that h/she will be saved.<br>  <br>  "You're not a person; you're a disease."<br>  - This is directed to the abductor. H/she is not considered as a person but a disease.<br>  <br>  "All these lives that you've been taking,<br>  Deep inside, my heart is breaking.<br>  Broken homes from separation.<br>  Don't you know it's violation?<br>  It's so wrong, but you'll see.<br>  Never gonna let you take my world from me.<br>  The world outside these walls may know you're breathing,<br>  But you ain't comin' in.<br>  You ain't comin' in."<br>  - If I'm not mistaken, Daughtry is a father of two kids. Hence, I think he can relates to other parents about their abducted child and that's why deep inside, his heart is breaking. He doesn't want the same thing to happen to him. "The world outside these walls" are aware of the abductor but he(Daughtry) will do anything to keep him away from his family.<br>  <br>  "Posters hung on building walls<br>  Of missing faces.<br>  Months go by without the cause,<br>  The clues, or traces."<br>  - Another proof that it is about child abduction. It's pretty much self-explanatory. <br>  <br>  "Shed the light on all the ones <br>  Who never thought they would become<br>  A father, mother asking why this world can be so cold."<br>  - Keep on giving hope to those parents who never thought that it could ever happened to them.<br>  <br>  "Doesn't come down when she calls,<br>  "It's time for breakfast."<br>  The memories begin to fall.<br>  She asks, "When will I be free?" "<br>  - Here, I think the child remember the time when she was abducted. She wonder when she would be saved.<br>  <br>  Hope that helped!<br>  <br>  ★~

01d9f7d86b08b714b8ed46b41571cfdaaa	Capricorn isn't an unemotional sign, it just means we try to hide our emotions.   I don't like sharing my emotions with anyone, not even with people i trust, so i tend to write things down to deal.  Frankly, i like this better than talking with others, because then i don't receive the terrible advice i used to get (it's funny, i never realized how much advice is complete bull until i stopped asking for it).|`|IUfAvw9Naa	yes and no....<br>  yes because u may feel like you have to control your emotions....<br>  no because you can be entirely wrong about some things and guarding yourself against things that will not happen

9GRj1EwOaa	In May 2006, the band announced they were going on hiatus. Malakian has confirmed the break will probably last a few years, which Odadjian specified as a minimum of three years in an interview with Guitar magazine. He told MTV, "We're not breaking up. If that was the case, we wouldn't be doing this Ozzfest. We're going to take a very long break after Ozzfest and do our own things. We've done System for over ten years, and I think it's healthy to take a rest."[10]<br>  <br>  During their performance in Houston, Texas, Malakian also took a moment to say, "There's been a lot of rumors about us breaking up. Well, don't listen to them. Us four right here, we will always be System of a Down!"[citation needed] However, Malakian announced he was forming a band called Scars on Broadway, which was joined by Dolmayan. Their debut album (Self-Titled) was released on July 29, 2008. Odadjian will be working on a project with RZA of Wu-Tang Clan named Achozen as well as his UrSession website/record label. Tankian plans to keep recording as a solo artist/producer. His first single, "Empty Walls" off his first album Elect the Dead, which was released on October 23, 2007. Dolmayan, as well working with Scars on Broadway, planned to open a comic book store online by November 2007.[11]<br>  <br>  System of a Down's final performance before their hiatus took place on August 13, 2006 in West Palm Beach, Florida. "Tonight will be the last show we play for a long time together," Malakian told the crowd during Sunday's last performance. "We'll be back. We just don't know when."[12]<br>  <br>  Shavo Odadjian recently told Launch Radio Networks that System of a Down is "alive and well", but just aren't working together [13]<br>  <br>  In an April 2008 interview with Kerrang magazine, guitarist Daron Malakian and drummer John Dolmayan gave their takes on the band's future. When told that many people are going to wonder what the future of the band is, Malakian responded by stating that "We'll all know when the time is right." Dolmayan added, "It'll just happen." Malakian went on to say:<br>  “  Yeah. It'll feel good and happen. I can respect this situation [System's hiatus] more than I can respect the situation where two people are like, 'The lead singer ****** my girlfriend!' and that kind of bullshit. Nah, man. The lead singer is a special person to me and I am to him. And that's how we ended off. Same with Shavo, same with John. And it will always be. It was a big part of my life. We were onstage together for a long time, man. We went through **** as a band and friends -- we slept in RV's together!  ”|`|nxuPFxNcaa	i neve heard any news of the gang disbanding ..  im a huge SOAD fan, got every album ...  they're on vacation so to speak ... but they're stil together.|`|HzxSzY1paa	No, they are just on a hiatus.<br>  You could look into some of the side projects from individual members..

It has the ride, but the best selection is Siegfried's Funeral Music. The performance is so good it will blow your gears. The Brass is tighter than the Berlin or Chicago, and the Saxes sound so much like the wind/string combo you don't miss the strings.

As, a person I believe he is a great person who is a bit eccentric and the media unjustly perpetuates this and makes him seem like a weirdo or a monstrous figure something I believe he isn't. Which, brings the pedophile charges into question. I believe in innocent until proven otherwise. There was no plausible evidence and the family of the accuser just say a chance at a payday and took advantage of MJ. He would never do, such a thing.<br>  <br>  Too the person that said, LaToya Jackson said, MJ was a pedophile and that she would know being his sister. If you were a Jackson fan you would know that LaToya is the family black sheep and has been out of her siblings lives for years now. Janet Jackson took MJ's side and she herself has called out LaToya many of times.

After a couple of minutes, he resurfaced with a big grin on his face.<br>  <br>  'You're a little girl, and I'm a little boy,' he said proudly.<br>  <br>  'You're ever so clever,' cooed the baby girl, 'but how can you tell ?' <br>  <br>  'It's quite easy really,' replied the baby boy, <br>  <br>  You've got pink socks and I've got blue ones."

hvde0uHNaa	i do ... cos i have one ... hence im Australian <br>  <br>  when my cousins from england came over for a visit... i was talking to them .... couldnt stop laughing whilst talking to them|`|oVrcJwphaa	Oh yes. I absolutely melt when I hear a guy with an Australian accent. I love hearing anyone talk with an Australian accent though.|`|S4kNvdGcaa	hahaha<br>  helll yeah!<br>  i lovee those accents hella awesome<br>  <br>  i wish i had one<br>  i can only talk like "gangstahh/pidgin" kine|`|AA11542500	Actually, I have my navigation set to a female Australian voice so yeah, hella awesome!|`|ACa1N4Jdaa	YAY!!!!! AUSSIE AUSSIE AUSSIE!!!! OI OI OI!!!!!!!!!!! YAY!|`|aVZgY4S8aa	I love Aussie accents but British accents are my first choice|`|ymK1hg2Raa	HECK YES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!... I LOVE THOSE ACCENTS!|`|Nq5tE1h0aa	lol yeahhh|`|NJVm6dTiaa	As an Aussie, yep, I like the way we speak ... it's not "awesome" to me though, because it's just what we hear everyday all the time!! It's always amusing and somewhat flattering to have others remark that they love our 'accent' ... we don't think we have one! It's the rest of the world who appear to be accenting speech.|`|fUKWTjjiaa	YEAH! If I ever move to a foreign coutry it would be Australia I wonder if I could pick up the accent. Heck I already talk like them, all I need is the accent|`|WGehr0C3aa	absolutely. i was at a travel expo yesterday and there was an aussie at one of the places giving out guidebooks. that accent is epic.|`|d4f6400ded99a1dec7d1c509edd9fae1aa	Ha ha ha I have a thing for voices in general!  Alot of accents are hot!<br>  I have gotten a few compliments on my own voice so no, I don't want to talk like anyone else but me.|`|Kg681jL8aa	sounds like someone likes us.|`|dKyUhbYOaa	Eh. I like the British accent more. Australian is okay but it just doesn't cut it for me.|`|F2qPNDpiaa	Being an Aussie, I think we have a cool accent..sort of in between British and American. It matches our sence of humor! :)|`|UZEEKKPeaa	YUM...*drools...|`|QpkeD39haa	No|`|ZVSZZ6qHaa	Yes|`|OdovbvSYaa	its fair dinkum cobber|`|5nzKloSYaa	it starts to annoy me after five min D:|`|1sQAtgTaaa	YES... and also the british one...<br>  its hott!!|`|GZVqEEDraa	Oh my gosh yes!  The only accent I like better is a British one!   <br>  <br>  <br>  *Smiles*|`|CEKZsoFRaa	Yeah, it's cool!|`|UjPArJZ6aa	I much prefer a British accent...not the posh one, but not the 'East Enders' type one either...<br>  <br>  Not sure what it's called.|`|8VlDuMFOaa	hahaha....I find it hilarious when people find the Aussie accent appealing...I guess when you hear it and speak it everyday its nothing that great.<br>  Its the Irish and American accents that i prefer! OMG....LOVE THEM!<br>  <br>  Peanut Fu...let me whisper in your ear girl!!|`|m3ThrbDMaa	An American Accent?<br>  <br>  I just thought the rest of the world heard us as grunting gorillas...|`|rMB71kZ8aa	yes|`|K0iFV73Gaa	Sound cool. Great country
5Q5FZDs5aa	well it was prince #1 of course... because as it was a sunny day, the black one was much hotter to the touch than the white ones, which absorbed less heat.|`|QIC9FdvOaa	prince number 1 married the princesses because it was a very sunny day so he felt the doors and the black ones were hot so that's how he got it right.|`|AA11716002	The one with the most money.|`|AA10395093	hold on ..<br>  <br>  EDIT:<br>  Prince number 1|`|YDtSz60oaa	I think the first prince passed the test, the suns light would have been reflected from the white doors, keeping them pretty cool, but the black door would have quickly absorbed heat and become warm. he just had to feel for the warmest door.|`|HwV8IY7maa	prince one, black paint would get hot in the sun|`|VUfT35UQaa	Prince number one, he could touch the doors as the white one would be cooler, as black retains heat (or the other way round but by temperature)|`|LraBRIccaa	prince 1. He felt the doors and the hottest one was the black one
rMB71kZ8aa	Angelina Jolie is very weird.  She is a nut case.|`|GclagLJkaa	i think she just wants to rock the PPPPAAAARRRRTTTTTYYYYYYY....she is a goonie goo-goo|`|mZUXkeyRaa	I know!<br>  Would it kill her to smile for once?<br>  She didnt smile at all on the red carpet<br>  Plus, she refused to talk to Ryan Seacrest (i dont blame her, lol but she could be a little nicer)
r4N245AOaa	Its Britney :) yes ive always liked her... there are people all over the world who have made the same mistakes as she has but just b/c she is famous people act like she is the most horrible person in the world! and ppl who say she is a bad role model... i dont think she is trying to be a role model... and what about all of these rappers and singers who sing about hoes, and bitches, and sex and drugs.. those people are also role models for kids to!! but for some reason people only pick on britney spears! i think their just jealous|`|7b0903c0e39a55a5230350128e4fcff1aa	She's ok but she needs some help. She can't deal with the stardom that she has. She needs to concentrate on her children.|`|u0xvF3UOaa	Yes.<br>  I think she is a good woman although the media portrays her differently.|`|3FnhJluuaa	i've liked that girl since day one.she has had her momments and has done many horrible things i love her and she has never let down her fans. I love her song her songs her voice her personality from where i see it. Amazing girl! I have never stop loving her. Her tour will bring the best in her i wish her the best!|`|NhOQ3mRxaa	First it's Britney! Sorry but yes I looooove her I mean yes she has had some bad times but she has gotten through them and is now on tour starting in march and I mean she is doing really good! (April 30th,2009 she is coming to my town and I am going yay)<br>  Faith, Trust,And Pixie Dust,<br>  Chelsie!|`|VyJl1bZ4aa	i didn't but now i support the fact that she wants to get her life on the right track. if it happens, then yeah she'll be cool|`|CEKZsoFRaa	yeah she's cool, she's Brittney B*tch!|`|440b5eeaa808017d23fb3beb1ec4fa73aa	She was putting out some good music, but then she let the celeb status go to her head. Not to mention why to much money and not enough brains, so she ended up being nothing more than a twit, who goes out partying all the time and has a problem dressing all the way.<br>  <br>  One problem I have with any musician is if they are up there with a microphone they should be sing the song and not lip syncing to the song instead. I mean, if people are there for a live performance and it's what they are paying for, then it's what they should get. Anything else is almost like those two other guys, who got caught awhile back. The only difference with them was it was two different singers doing the actual singing and they were the pretty boys up front.|`|qQcw2O4Oaa	Yes, I like Britney Spears. I think she makes fun songs and looks great. She had a mental breakdown and faces a lot of criticism.  In my opinion, I think that Sean Preston and Jayden are just getting the ordinary, run-of-the-mill hillbilly upbringing like she had. She goes out and parties and stuff, but at least her kids are looked after. These women around here do horrible, adult things while their kids are in the same room. They go out, sleep with twenty different men, and then don't know who fathers their babies. Crap like that is common around here. At least Britney isn't like that. <br>  <br>  Honestly, I think she has the mind of a teenager (which is when she started in the music industry). She was probably trying to bring in money for her family (who had struggled financially) and thought about becoming big. It seems to me her mom, Lynne, is milking her and Jamie Lynn for all they're worth, and has let the money take over. I hate seeing **** like that happen. All Kevin seemed to want Britney for was her money. Justin Timberlake told about losing her virginity years ago to make himself get even bigger.<br>  <br>  I think all of that stuff combined with other factors has made Britney lose her mind. I still like her, though.|`|767862fac913cacc2a85deeb280cab44aa	The Britney Spears when she was 16 was good...<br>  but as she started going crazy I started to not like her as much<br>  If she gets her priorities set straight then we'll just have to see.eee|`|TvuaHx48aa	Personally I cant tell you because I do not know her.But one thing I do know is she is nuts! <3 So no for being famous,and idk for personal <3|`|XN0sRoqpaa	the "shave her self" was pretty much a turn off. but shes having a come back. so i guess... no, the reputation is ruined forever|`|6BAb9eawaa	yes,<br>  she is an amazing entertainer!|`|kRbkiPvnaa	No,  She is a terrible role model for young people.|`|WQcxODKLaa	yes .<br>  <br>  i loved her since i was 11 .|`|a5KpcodFaa	NO, too many reasons to list. I actually think she is the first person that thinks her sh_t doesn't stink as well as Oprah.<br>  <br>  She can't do anything wrong according to the public, it just shows why our nation is in a economic down fall all the general public thinks about is what is going on with the so-called stars life's. 95% of the nations wealth is controlled by 5% of the population. The other 95% of our nation believes everything the news tells them, how pathetic is that.|`|vo6ZenTUaa	I like her ok.  She made some mistakes but it is hard for young people who are in the limelight all the time.  And the papparazzi probably drove her half nuts.  They are vultures.|`|7pK8B250aa	Idk, I would say she's the most famous person that has ever lived, at least the most famous person with modern media ect. I mean Jesus comes a close second to britney.|`|S8AKs5s6aa	no, she is an attention seeking screw up and she should start focusing on her poor children instead of what everyone thinks of her|`|j2gtKnFdaa	Yes. She is very hard-working, and NORMAL like everyone else. I respect her greatly.|`|g5g7GBz3aa	yes i do.her music is great.she has made mistakes but that doesn't mean she is a bad person.|`|CHe30rdiaa	she's interesting. she's gone through some hard times but her songs are fun to sing and dance to so i don't think she's that bad.<br>  but she's not my favorite.|`|5TMzUFmsaa	sorta. its not really a yes or no cuz i like so of her songs but then i feel like she screwed up her life but idk|`|591LuLECaa	Yes i do, i like her songs!|`|k3sRw5q8aa	I think she is strange but has a good voice|`|2kg2cOHOaa	yes because she's cool

441GSyaMaa	My aunt has had cancer, this is the third time now... she's not getting anything (not that she wants any attention...) but it's like she is just taking the absolute p!ss now,  I mean I heard on the news that they may film her death and broadcast that... I mean how f*cking sick and twisted do you really have to be?! The whole boyfriend thing I can understand, I mean it's one night to spend with his pretty much dead girlfriend so I'm not bothered about that...<br>  <br>  I'm just so sick and tired of hearing it, it'll be like when princess Diana died, but for a much less of a decent person lol<br>  <br>  The good parts of this though is the fact that the money she raises for publicity it is all purely for her children (so that's good really) and the fact that she has raised awareness for cervical cancer and shows how dangerous it really is.<br>  <br>  I have to admit I kinda respect her for not using Big Brother her whole life and actually, when leaving the house, going off and doing her own things... I just don't care about this cancer thing lol<br>  <br>  And to "Woodywigan"... you're dumb, Kylie Monogue isn't going around every-bloody-where saying how she's dying, she's more discreet about it...|`|e0957cd4945ef9a81d45c793833468e0aa	Totally agree, you never hear about mothers, children, fathers etc dying of cancer and other illnesses every day here in britain, now you get a celeb who the media etc took the mickey out of most of the time and are now in love with her.<br>  <br>  plus she marries a thug who she doesn't exactly know that well.<br>  <br>  Can only guess he is after a few bob.<br>  <br>  <br>  btw if its jade goody or anyone else i dont like to see anyone go before there time.|`|yuTue84caa	I think its also to do with the fact that she is so young. Its quite rare for someone her age to have such advanced cancer.<br>  I have been following her story and I also went for a smear test a few weeks ago, which I probably wouldn't have done if it wasn't for her story.<br>  I feel really sorry for her boys and could not imaging not growing up without my mum at that age. <br>  As for Jack's curfew it was lifted for one night on compassionate grounds for them to spend their wedding night together|`|G8zAPz8Maa	My opinion: -<br>  She is a stupid woman who is worshipped by the other low life that cannot think for themselves and are told what to think by the media.<br>  <br>  Imagine how many families are going through redundancy and house repossessions and have to bear the thought of that poorly educated, racist woman getting paid ￡1m for marrying a convicted criminal.<br>  <br>  Is that an answer for you ?|`|jtYL9Qqnaa	I agree with you, but I do feel bad for her.|`|tUeH8HDdaa	I think it's all such a tragedy.<br>  <br>  The good thing to come out of it all is that more young women will now go and get tested.<br>  <br>  The sad thing is that there seemed to no help for Jade and all the others like her when she was a young child.<br>  <br>  Really as far as children are concerned nothing has changed in this country since Charles Dickens time.<br>  <br>  We're still paying money to watch people in the asylum.|`|7pK8B250aa	Yeah, but she's about to die dude, I mean have you saw her? I mean she gets to live out her last weeks getting followed around by paparizi, so I mean I feel sorry for her.<br>  <br>  OMG! that first answer cracked me up!|`|hk5f8yxVaa	I feel as sorry for her as I would for anyone, but I feel it's insensitive and a bit wrong.|`|JNDDFz33aa	I just hope she had a lovely day and enjoys what time she has left with her family around her.|`|P447J3kZaa	So do you have the same feelings about kylie minogue?|`|gqsFZdPnaa	publicity pays.|`|10cnKUpxaa	she is a cancer, i am aquaris|`|rftEZA50aa	OK, she's made women more aware of cervical cancer and large numbers of women are rushing to go to the gyno so inadvertently she may have saved someone which is very cool, but lets not for a second forget that she received a letter informing her of abnormal cells and IGNORED the letter and now it's too late! Yet again Jades ignorance is her downfall just like her ignorance that caused her racist rant at Shilpa. Raking in money from the media to make sure her kids want for nothing is a good thing, but there are more deserving women out there that have done more for their community and they don't get any recognition. Has Jade ever donated to charity or raised money for charity like so many others out there have done? Even the 'real' celebs have done more for good causes. Yes I feel sorry for her position as a mother that will never see her children grow to adults, that's a difficult reality to come to terms with, but if you ignore reasonable advice then you only have yourself to blame.|`|v1kpmmGwaa	before i read the story i saw the picture and thought she'd done a brittney<br>  but after reading it my best wishes go out to her and her children|`|57edf00d97af522b314c33475bf1e853aa	I know a lot of ppl are thinking "Who does this girl think she is?"<br>  She's a Celebrity made on RTV and then went on to make a living from it,so come on ppl, Who wouldn't have done the same thing?<br>  The only reason that she gets ridiculed is cos of the whole "racist"thing and everyone has held it against her.Shilpa Shetty can forget but the public cant?Not even for a dying women.<br>  <br>  She's 27 years old with 2 boys and dying...she grew up Ignorant and she doesn't want her boys living the same way so shes making their life better by selling her life to mags and tv,i'd do the same and im sure so would you.<br>  I think shes amazing and brave women as is every cancer ridden human being but it is her "Celebrity life"that's made her headline news.

The Exploding Power"<br>  <br>  Summary: Ishida and Yoshi begin their battle, and Ishida realizes that the Quincy battle accessory he is using does not allow him to properly focus his power. When Ishida is able to properly use the accessory and fire a powerful arrow, Yoshi is able to block it by changing the form of her doll into a fan. She then transforms her doll into a sword and knocks Ishida to the ground. Meanwhile, Kariya breaks into the Bureau of Technology, searching for a Bount crest, the Jōkaishō. Despite the efforts of Chad and Ichigo, Kariya finds the Jōkaishō, and after fusing with it, claims he has enough power to destroy Sereitei. <br>  <br>  <br>  ~~(^__^)~~|`|3kyJzANIaa	HADOUKEN!|`|f5p5vQmHaa	i don't know the number, but it was gay because kariya acheived his goal and uryuu was being a total douche bag, like what else is new?<br>  <br>  it was liek episode 99 or something, i think...<br>  <br>  @};- heartwingheart|`|xZYS9nDKaa	I DONT KNOW SORRY.

oH9JwVqZaa	he grows physically gradually. It's showing that he's changing and becoming more and more evil. In the beginning he's as you said soft and young, that reflected his personality. As the movie progresses MacBeth is power mad and becomes more and more evil this is shown through physical caricatures as well.|`|HXe1zgUtaa	you mean the polanski version? In that movie macbeth doesn't grow bigger..however, if he grows older looking, it shows us how different macbeth was from what h<br>  Macbeth, as played by Jon Finch, possesses a hypnotically brooding gaze and an intense delivery. Despite his young age (a different spin on the part―usually Macbeth is middle-aged) he seems perpetually tormented, both before and after gaining the crown. Though physically slight for the warrior-poet he is purportedly portraying, I found his performance gripping and his command of the text impressive. His weary reading of the “Tomorrow” speech, done mostly in voice-over, is affecting. <br>  <br>  Life's but a walking shadow, a poor player<br>  That struts and frets his hour upon the stage<br>  And then is heard no more: it is a tale<br>  Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury,<br>  Signifying nothing.<br>  <br>  This marks the most iimportant reason to why macbeth was getting weary,older looking. The cosmetics were also welll done.

Sloan <br>  Language: French <br>  First release: On audio single Même si tu revenais (1965)<br>  <br>  There does not appear to be a "legit" soundtrack recording for "Sicko" so your best bet might be someplace that sells "vintage" music.<br>  <br>  Here are the lyrics:<br>  <br>  Ecoute bien au lieu de rire<br>  Ecoute bien ce que je vais te dire<br>  Toi, l'homme de la terre, toi qui vis dans les champs<br>  Crois-tu que notre monde soit devenu méchant ?<br>  Toi, mon ami qui vis si près de la nature<br>  Dis-moi, <br>  <br>  [Refrain:] <br>  Dis-moi, encore et encore et encore et encore, mon ami<br>  Fais-moi croire que tout va bien dans ce monde<br>  <br>  Ecoute bien au lieu de rire<br>  Au lieu de te moquer, imagine le pire<br>  Peux-tu lire dans mes yeux que j'ai peur de cette bombe ?<br>  Si on presse le bouton, la Terre sera une bombe<br>  Nous serons tous victime de l'inconscience humaine<br>  Mais toi<br>  <br>  [au Refrain] <br>  [ Find more Lyrics on www.mp3lyrics.org/T5vm ]<br>  <br>  Oh! écoute bien, écoute au lieu de rire<br>  Que penses-tu du problème que je vais te décrire ?<br>  Si le coquelicot rouge vit dans le jaune des blés<br>  Si le blanc des nuages dort dans le noir de la nuit<br>  Pourquoi toutes ces couleurs dans notre Société<br>  Ne vivent-elles donc pas dans la même harmonie ?<br>  Et c'est ce monde absurde qui se dit civilisé<br>  Mais toi<br>  <br>  [au Refrain] <br>  <br>  Ecoute encore un peu ce que je veux te dire<br>  Ecoute une dernière fois, oh, il n'y a pas de quoi rire !<br>  Peut-être qu'à notre age, nous réfléchissons trop<br>  Mais tous ces satellites qui tournent tout là-haut<br>  Ne veulent-ils pas prouver que la paix est possible<br>  Que là-haut, les frontières ne doivent pas être visibles ?<br>  Mais toi, mon ami qui vis si près de la nature<br>  Dis-moi<br>  <br>  [au Refrain] <br>  <br>  Fais-moi croire que tout va bien dans ce monde<br>  [end]<br>  <br>  This is as far as I go.<br>  Google the artist or song name to dig deeper.

DafekVxjaa	NONE.  It would easier to just give all of the celebrities an award and be done with it.  They have how many awards shows? 10, 11, 12?  I get sick of it.  Besides, every time they have one on, the programming gets all messed up and the shows that I do enjoy are reruns.  I am sick of it.  What if every job had an awards show.  What it isn't enough that they make millions and billions of dollars, they also have to have 20 million awards shows!  Seriously, they are celebrities not gods.<br>  <br>  <br>  B|`|nKxQLZr3aa	OMG! love the teen choice awards, that my favorite because im a teen and they have good catergories and good celebs. i also love the Grammy's because i love music and all the preformances|`|YFVvNvBRaa	same, teens awards|`|AA11111233	Academy Awards.

PGSpIOPDaa	I'm a Leo with a Taurus man and I'm not like that. Sure I love that he is willing to pay but I don't want him to spend all his money on me. I try to be fair and don't go to really expensive places. But hey, that's just me.|`|AA11100991	I think that everyone has choices to make. Not all Leo women are going to use people, of course. Whether a person is a Capricorn, Gemini, etc. he or she might choose to use others. It's like anything. Just because certain character traits may or may not be found in a person does not determine what that person chooses to do. Your friend is choosing to remain in this relationship, so give him room to live out his decision. It is good that you worry about him/care for him, but he is still in control of what he chooses to live. Sometimes the best thing you can do is to be there for him and allow him to make his own choices. He will catch on, if he hasn't already.|`|IIwhkNZuaa	He's doing this because he wants to. A Taurus man knows how to say no, and eventually he will wear out with her and start screaming at her and maybe even hurting her, so just sit back and watch the fireworks.<br>  <br>  By the way, why are you badmouthing someone you consider your best friend?|`|S2uAq7i4aa	Me?Never.<br>  He's a Taurus,too,who is obsessed with money and might either love spending money or love saving it.

POaW7AKUaa	I like it but it makes it harder to keep your sims alive.  One of my sims was playing outside in the snow with his kid, and he froze.  My other sim had to thaw him out, and after that his skin stayed blue for a while.  One of my sims overheated in the summer and combusted.  My other sim tried to extinguish her, but she just turned into a pile of ashes and he had to play rock-paper-scissors with the grim reaper.  My sims get overheated from working out for too long.  My child sim almost got taken away because he got overheated from jumping on the bed.  I also had a sim get struck by lightning, a tree get struck by lighting and catch on fire, and a sim die from a hail storm.  It's a lot of fun though.  It makes the game more interesting. The snow is cool, there are new things like ice skating, fishing, gardens, slides for the pool, and some cool furniture.  If your sim spends too much time gardening, they can get a plant disease. Overall,  It's fun and worth the money.|`|ebaa7ca0b1b2e45ca08cf6fd5db01a30aa	its kinda fun.. u have to be very conscious of how long your sims stay outside.. because they have a thermometer  and could get sick.. or sunburned and its really fun.. there are green houses that make it easier to have a garden.|`|o9lQrcsYaa	It has all the seasons.. you never know when it will snow or rain... Also has the wheather channel... Your sims can get sick...

lpyWVR2oaa	Just based on the above info...<br>  <br>  In a nutshell, he is the homely, domesticated type who is steadfast, loyal, down-to-earth and stubborn to the core. This is a very fixed personality and once he's made up his mind, nobody can change it. He adheres to a routine and is a very sensual, earth person who loves to be in close contact with nature all the time. Can be slow to initiate matters and needs a lot of trust before he will open up to you.<br>  <br>  He is also attracted to watery, emotional, sensitive types of females who are domesticated and family-oriented, much like himself. He flirts and initiates by being a good listener, sensitive to your needs and appealing to your emotions.

I'm Capricorn sun and Pisces moon and I think it makes me a lot less emo and boring (when the said Capricorns were boring, I almost wept cuz I wanted to be a writer)<br>  <br>  The Astrology book says Pisces moon makes people nicer and more flexible, lol. <br>  <br>  Though I think astrology's more fun than serious, really. ;) so don't get restricted by it.|`|Fb2xM1kJaa	Pisces Sun<br>  Gemini Moon|`|uel6NBOVaa	I'm a Libra Sun with a Cancer Moon....they square each other which causes a lot of inner tension between my thoughts and feelings....I can be charming and poised one moment, and sensitive and insecure the next...I lose my temper way too easily. However, I have an excellent memory, and good intuition.

wzkCSmF1aa	AHH theyre so fantastic!!!!<br>  my favorite thing about them is that eachof their songs are so distinct, and they factor in so many different musical elements into their songs, but none of them sound overworked.<br>  i have no idea how they do it and each song sounds completely different.<br>  theyre very inventitive.<br>  yeah so i love them a lot.<br>  <br>  and theyre from austin, they state it sometimes in t heir music so i guess that like texas pride is attractice to their fans.|`|Vkff8N8Taa	They're pretty cool actually, never seen them live or anything, but their albums are really good--they just sound really neat and original. <br>  <br>  I've never been to TX, so I can't answer that; I've never met anyone who liked the band, come to think of it.|`|16t0eV0Uaa	Great band, I love all their albums, and eps, "Underdog" seems to be their most popular song, and it is nowhere near their best song imo, I think my favorite song is "the way we get by".|`|wTkvkWscaa	I LOVE Spoon.

Exactly because they're so catchy.<br>  <br>  And I don't live anywhere near Texas, but that's where they're from so it makes sense they'd have a serious fan-base there. I think most bands are pretty much beloved my their hometowns.|`|8plmBPaDaa	They're fantastic.<br>  <br>  Every song on Gimme Fiction is great.|`|0vm66wlcaa	I like them, they are one of my favorite indie rock bands!<br>  <br>  I would imagine most of their fans are from the Austin area, considering that's where they are from<br>  <br>  Those are the two albums I have from them!<br>  My favorite songs are:<br>  "I Turn My Camera On"<br>  "The Underdog"<br>  "The Beast And The Dragon, Adored"

bdttDnlwaa	The SUN takes 365 days to go around the Zodiac.<br>  <br>  The MOON takes 28 days.<br>  <br>  MERCURY takes 87 days.<br>  <br>  VENUS takes 224 days.<br>  <br>  MARS takes 1 year and 220 days.<br>  <br>  JUPITER takes 12 years.<br>  <br>  SATURN takes 29 years.<br>  <br>  URANUS takes 84 years.<br>  <br>  NEPTUNE takes 168 years.<br>  <br>  PLUTO takes 249 years.<br>  <br>  <br>  Now, if you work with the Astronomical Ephemeris, it is not so straightforward, because most Planets do go Retrograde, time after time, and in somehow an irregular way.<br>  <br>  Next, about Returns, such as for instance when Saturn comes back to the same position as that one on the Birth Chart, well, it has to differ. It is not the same, this because of many varied factors.<br>  <br>  Just two of these varied factors :<br>  <br>  The placement of the less slow moving Planets are different now. <br>  To check this, one has to do a Progressed Chart.<br>  <br>  And the World Planets have also a different Placements now.<br>  <br>  So all the interactions or aspects can only differ.<br>  <br>  Having said that, everyone individually, on a more intimate and psychological level, "own" their Natal Saturn, or Natal Jupiter, and so on.<br>  <br>  So, yes, definitely, it is advantageous and informative, to examine a Planet Return.<br>  <br>  By the way, the Sun, Moon, Mercury, Venus and Mars, are the Planets that return most frequently.<br>  <br>  As always, there are no simple answers in Astrology !<br>  <br>  Take care.|`|S2uAq7i4aa	Well,Pluto takes 12 years.<br>  <br>  <br>  ****** ;D|`|531f08d2bae7afb19dbace61520eb62caa	An astronomy question.

7sqjaYx6aa	yeah i knew. i was watching some videos of the doors with scott weiland and eddie veder a while ago|`|xKLydoTpaa	and did you also know that they never reached even half the popularity they had with morrison.  when the heart and soul of the band is gone it is hard for the remaining members to carry on.  another example of this is the grateful dead with the death of jerry garcia.  or nirvana and the death of kurt colbain|`|qThmcR1Aaa	Yeah. My best friend's mom had one of those albums when I was growing up -- "Other Voices," I think it was called.<br>  <br>  I've heard that Krieger, Densmore, and Manzarek have pretty much disowned those albums since then.|`|AgQForcYaa	Actually, Robby and Ray just took over the vocals, they didn't really "replace him."

I think a further investigation is required!!!|`|SXJTZP5zaa	I think it's fine that they released new albums without him, but replacing him with a wannabe Jim Morrison is kind of pathetic.|`|fzqMOD4Waa	Yes I did, and am an adamant believer that Ian Astbury, although brilliant, is not a Morrissonesque singer.|`|sBKdutqFaa	Yeah.  Robbie Krieger and Ray Manzarek still perform today.  They tour under the name "Riders on the Storm" but initially went by "Doors of the 21st Century" and "D21C".  I saw them in Atlantic City a few years ago, they weren't that bad.  Obviously NOT anything close to Jim Morrison - more of a Doors cover band with 2 of the original Doors members.<br>  <br>  John Densmore also has his own band.|`|Ju1skLb8aa	No Ray took over the vocals, nobody ever replaced him. Nobody could EVER replace the Lizard King. The albums that were released were just prior to his death and albums such as The Best of The Doors and The Very Best of etc. Anybody who thinks Jim could be replaced is insane, he gave the Doors their uniqueness.|`|8b6626612b46b1f7353ad3ec39c2a22eaa	The 3 remaining Doors released "Other Voices" in late 1971 and Full Circle in 1972.  I alway liked "Piano Bird" from the Full Circle album.  Tightrope Ride was the single from Other Voices.

B0avgIpRaa	Intermedio (2005)<br>  A group of four teenage friends become trapped in a Mexican border tunnel where they fall prey, one-by one, to tortured ghosts who haunt it.<br>  <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0414161/" rel="nofollow">http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0414161/</a>|`|15fafbb5314da7937a58fa36d4ece8fbaa	sounds kind of like Turista
8039be540df1845420248ce48f6ca331aa	Brian May. At least from the bands that I listen to, I can say that almost nobody has the same sound<br>  <br>  Dimebag, his pitch harmonics are unreal|`|aS0nijbhaa	I agree with Hendrix, he's easy to tell. I'm gonna put on my cape and become Captain Obvious and say Angus Young. If somebody doesn't recognize an AC/DC song within the first ten seconds, then they should be shot.<br>  <br>  Also, Slash. He has a fairly similar style. He does definitely sound different in VR though, than he did in Gn'R.<br>  <br>  Jon Schaffer of Iced Earth isn't too hard to recognize either.<br>  <br>  And lastly, Tipton and Downing are easy to tell too in Judas Priest. Not many guitarists can blend together like that.|`|tyeCsbk1aa	I don't know about individual musicians, but I can usually tell what band is playing within the first ten seconds if I've heard them before. Metal bands, at least.<br>  <br>  I consider it a good sign to be able to tell an artist apart; means they have a unique sound.|`|kwB9e37vaa	hmm, i can easily tell any of the actual music (nonsinging) of the ramones, social distortion, horrorpops, and sublime.<br>  i dont know why, there is just something about their style that i have come familiar with, and can tell right off the bat.|`|sLVGdCOTaa	Many bands are known after only a few chords such as-AC/DC, Van Halen, Tom Morello from Rage is similar sounding in most songs, Justin Chanceller from Tool's bass is a sound you can recognize (if you're a Tool fan of course,|`|pLPKo6mBaa	Carlos Santana, usually|`|qQKOAdSjaa	Eric Clapton<br>  nobody has said it?<br>  the only major guitarist that even uses the same tone settings is Slash on his les paul|`|OyT5oxFbaa	Joe Satriani, Eddie Van Halen, and Slash!|`|AgQForcYaa	I can usually tell a Symphony X song pretty easily without Russell Allen's voice.<br>  <br>  And I can tell Satch a lot.|`|8IDEe8Y2aa	*Tony Iommi - Black Sabbath<br>  *Zakk Wylde - BLS, Ozzy<br>  *John Frusciante - RHCP|`|zfadjiJVaa	Dimebag <br>  Kirk Hamett <br>  Both Opeth Guitarists <br>  Jimmy Page<br>  All That Remains Guitarists<br>  Jimi Hendrix<br>  Nonpoint<br>  Meshuggah|`|gMaeE2vAaa	Synyster Gates<br>  Dimebag<br>  Chuck Berry<br>  Tony iommi<br>  Slash|`|i5YJBqnZaa	Jeff Beck & Carlos Santana|`|12QJ9QMRaa	Dave Mustaine and Mike Amott,usually|`|rFBypeEfaa	Weird as it is, since I'm not that big a Kiss fan, I can always tell if it's Ace Frehley because of that weird multiple picking thing he does, especially evident all over the first album. An example being the main riff to "Strutter".<br>  <br>  (Unless I'm being an idiot and that's actually Paul Stanley; it is the rhythm parts where it usually happens, not the leads...)|`|rRCTvT7Saa	I can almost always tell when any of these guitarists are playing:<br>  <br>  Brad Paisley<br>  Albert Lee<br>  Eric Johnson<br>  Jerry Reed<br>  Chet Atkins<br>  Brent Mason<br>  Steve Vai<br>  <br>  <br>  And probably a few others I can think of at the moment.  As for bassists, I could most likely tell if Victor Wooten or Billy Sheehan is playing, but I'm not sure about drummers or any other musicians, for that matter!|`|JyxNA1o0aa	I can usually tell when it's Eddie Van Halen, like when i first heard Beat It, i was like...hmmm....the guitar solo sounds like Eddie, then i looked it up and it was!! XD|`|fn5ijdnIaa	Joe Satriani. I can also tell if it's gonna be an AC/DC song or a Who song on the first listen.|`|C7YbYUYPaa	Hendrix<br>  Brian May<br>  Tom Scholz
gMaeE2vAaa	It takes away from your tone until you get to the higher notes, then it gives you that lil extra push and makes you go higher|`|JDdKbIM1aa	Having mucus in your throat will obstruct your airway, thus preventing your voice from having a clear sound. The best thing to cure that is to take some sort of decongestant. Swallowing it won't to anything to get rid of it and constantly coughing is rough on your throat and your vocal chords. I have the same problem only my mucus is in my chest not my throat. I started taking chest decongestants and it helped a lot.
UAHjJpC0aa	no it's not that easy<br>  <br>  what you are doing is just one part of the song<br>  plus, no one is going to pay you for something you didn't create yourself<br>  <br>  and it's hard to get rich<br>  when most people are stealing music these days

And then the old Lady would fall down and break her chain saw in the gravel. And then and Songe Bob Squaw pants would help the old lady up and  they would sing the friendship song. And then they would walk off together with Spongy Bob helping her to cross the street in rush traffic to go and get her chain saw fixed.<br>  <br>  And then it's bed time now! <br>  <br>  Me! :- )|`|9OqSl1Jlaa	Spongebob Squarepants because the chainsaw wouldn't run underwater and the old lady would drown.|`|db545bc62ac973f7f9d4710ea59879d7aa	well the chainsaw wouldnt really come in handy since sponge bob would run away but sponge bob cause he could throw krabby patty grease on her lol<br>  <br>  i think these through dont i|`|ACa1N4Jdaa	Not you.

N1SwM3oOaa	For leisure reading, a book covers serve as the first impression. If it looks ugly, I will never take a look inside. However, functional or academic readings would be different, I need to pay more attention on the title and the contents of the book for information.<br>  For me, the design of a book cover is important.|`|ws0nvFi5aa	i try not to. <br>  <br>  and if i were to have a name that no one sees everyday, i wouldn't really mind that much, but it depends.|`|9OqSl1Jlaa	Yes.

InAICv25aa	Must it be piano? I play violin, so of course I'll be a little slanted towards those. Let's say Etude also includes caprices and pieces that borrow heavily from those, alright? Please! I promise to give you top 10 awesome pieces.<br>  <br>  1. The inimitable Heifetz plays a version of:<br>  Paganini Caprice No. 24<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPcnGrie__M" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPcnGrie_...</a><br>  Careful, there's a piano accompaniment here that's not in the original.<br>  <br>  2. Then Rachmaninov had to go and write a whole Rhapsody based on this theme.<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3G0YvPgrYrg" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3G0YvPgrY...</a><br>  <br>  For some reason, I just love piano transcriptions of violin pieces. Liszt goes on to write his "Paganini Etudes," which are six pieces that are based on Paganini's caprices. NO ONE can play Caprice No. 6, which is the one Liszt uses for his 1st etude, so the piano version much better to me. <br>  <br>  Anyhow, my favorite two here are, both included under this link:<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ABQFNCFCkY" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ABQFNCFC...</a><br>  <br>  3. Grande Etude de Paganini No. 3 (based on la Campanella theme, which is the theme in Paganini's Second Violin--wikipedia does a mistake here--third movement.)<br>  <br>  4.

M7E1uIsKaa	MTV plays music?|`|zVoKLysgaa	i agree,<br>  i haven't watched any music on MTV for years now.|`|ZhUmY8b3aa	i barely hear music on mtv anymore|`|oOSNI3wbaa	ha! it doesnt matter now. since they dont even PLAY music anymore. but back when it first started i think it had a huge impact on what would go on to become popular. but as far as today, MTV is as relevant to music as giving an otter a rectal exam.<br>  screw mtv. lets get a real video channel up and running again.|`|785d07b11864df1b07a99374609e381eaa	It would probably be the same. MTV doesn't create the music they just throw it out there and make it more popular. I hate MTV but I think without them the only thing that would slightly change would be the popularity.|`|3dpIt3PIaa	Like this<br>  <a href="http://www.paradise-engineering.com/quotation/paradise.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.paradise-engineering.com/quot...</a><br>  *sigh* wouldn't it be nice?|`|a1566efb5533aa90596e330bc315a547aa	MTV doesn't even play music! What kind of MTV are you watching? That channel just has a bunch of pointless shows on it.|`|j5TOIyypaa	I believe it only does if you choose to watch it and participate in it.<br>  I love MTV && VH1. Those are the only 2 stations Ill watch, aside from when Anime is on on Adult Swim. I dont really watch alot of TV, though. In the morning Ill listen to my iPod instead, just so the TV is one less thing that I have to turn off before I leave. I may watch it at night though, if I cant sleep.<br>  <br>  I like some of the main stream stuff (AAR, Secondhand Serenade, Saving Abel), but I mostly stick with bands like 30 Seconds to Mars, Bullet For My Valentine, Escape the Fate, etc. <br>  <br>  They only choose your music for you if you let them. And if you let them well ... your choice. Who cares if what you listen to is "cool" or "popular"? It's what you like after all (I hope?).<br>  <br>  LOL, I got a thumbs down, thats alright (:.<br>  <br>  MTV isnt completely reality shows. It shows music videos in the morning sometimes (Although they're normally no longer than a minute). It also shows 30 second clips during show credits.<br>  <br>  VH1 also has a big "influence" on popular music. Their music videos are also longer than MTVs.|`|AA12176630	MTV was ok when it first came out but went downhill fast.We used to have a big satellite dish in the old days and I liked MuchMusic better.There was also a show called Heavy Harv that only played metal which was really good.I notice that as people get older they tend to give up the popular music(no matter what genre) and prefer quality over mainstream.This is probably why MTV just couldn't keep up.Personally i feel that a lot of videos distract you from the music.|`|sLVGdCOTaa	You've just hit the tip of the iceberg, Not only music would be WAY better, But young girls wouldn't think being slutty is a normal part of every girls youth-(see every single show geared for teens on MTV, always drunk, sleeping around, no respect for themselves, ect.ect.) Every guy might actually have an independent thought, instead of-for example, Giant fake diamond studs, crooked baseball hats (The most played out fad of them all) untied Timberlands, pants falling down, and last but not least-Talking like you've never met the English language-"fur real dough", "thats how I do", "I see you at" "we might could get some henny" Please!! How and when did sounding like 6th grade dropouts become the way to talk? If MTV was taken off the air the youth of this country would be better off.|`|BJZq27Yoaa	I think music would probably a harder business to do, because there is less publicity proven. Also if there wasn't mtv I wouldn't have known about music in the first place so eyah, it ain't that bad.|`|kwB9e37vaa	i agree.<br>  i think the world of music would be alot better.<br>  i probably still wouldn't like main stream music, but god, it sucks.<br>  I agree with Jello<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCUjMWh1Q98" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCUjMWh1Q...</a><br>  "but your to godd@mn conservative to take real chances!"|`|rRCTvT7Saa	I think music would be a lot better without MTV.  I mean, there might actually be some great guitar work in rock songs again for once!<br>  <br>  Just think about it--great guitar solos in rock and roll again...that'd be awesome!|`|xgVVe8Yeaa	I think that music would be better because people would like everything not just some stupid "cool" crap.|`|AgQForcYaa	Well, back  in the 80s, they actually promoted BANDS, and GOOD bands, at that! After Nirvana, MTV just went to hell. Maybe music wouldn't be as overzealous and stupid as it is now.|`|hMPI3TxTaa	Exactly the same because MTV no longer has anything to do with music.|`|A3axVsjuaa	Have you been living in a cave for the past 5 years? MTV barely even plays music any more.  Now it's all crappy "reality" shows.  I think they stopped playing music when good music became rarer|`|1rX7HB8Qaa	old MTV was good...the new one is horrible.

lGdzb8aqaa	she is a wonderful actress and even  on young and restless she is good at what she does and every one loves her character even if you don't like it you have to admit that she brings fire to her part and as a long time Y&R fan there were Kay, Jill,Sheila and Phyllis as the bad girls who you rooted for, but Sheila was the baddest and Phillis is coming in for second, I love to watch her but the last couple of weeks she has disappointed me with the begging Nick, the old Phyllis would have a nice red velvet cake baked for Nick and Sharon, Where is she at!!!!!! put a horses head in Sharon's bed, back the car over her, bring my bad girl back, and she is so good when she is good and bad bad bad when she is bad.and I am going to miss her and nick she brought fire to their relationship, hot , steamy, sexy and she did that with Jack, but the girl is a great actress. thanks for the site.|`|fcPiQDwEaa	Michelle Stafford/Phyllis:<br>  Super hott, great actress, tall, lean, redhead on wheels of fire, beautiful, awesome, great mother, good sexual chemistry, loveable, strong, sexy dresser, just one classy chick that l can't get enough of! MS/Phyllis ROCKS!!|`|17d2bf173d4736ad8ae99a2e1672a131aa	I really don't like Phyllis, but she is becoming a better person hrough her relationship with Nicholas... but she is a damn good actress, one of the best on the show.<br>  Still we need to see her playing really a nice her so we can assess her complete actings skills.|`|msUIsv8maa	She plays her part right she will go to any lenghts to get what she wants and is not honest in a relationship if i had to do all she does to keep a man ide just forget it. [No Morals what so ever ].|`|LkTcLWTOaa	i can't stand phyllis but I acknowledge that it is michelle stafford's acting ability that causes me to hate her character.|`|SXwlw9N2aa	I am with you my man. I love Phyllis. Her style, her attitude, her charm and her spunk. She is a beautiful woman in real life also. I think she is one of the greatest actress on daytime tv. She makes the character of Phyllis come alive and she makes her believable. I think she great and would love to see her do more things outside of Y&R.|`|9FCxm8qJaa	I dislike the character of Phyllis so much that I can't get past the character to have a positive opinion of the actress.  this is the only role I've seen Michelle stafford play, so I don't have another point of reference for her.|`|5f0111f71db8592710a5d1cb4897be4aaa	I hesitated clicking on this question because you asked for haters ,, I'm a huge fan of Michelle . Thanks for the great site !<br>  <br>   (( I don't think you will find a lot of haters as you did with Cheetah ))|`|4kuWOZowaa	Phyliss is Awesome|`|vvgC20BHaa	I HATE Phyllis!<br>  But I love Michelle Stafford! <br>  Y&R wouldn't be the same if I couldn't hate Phyllis!|`|30r4coInaa	I am not a Phyllis hater, but for so many to hate a character with such venom as the Phyllis haters do is a testament to how great of an actor MS is.  Gloria haters hate Gloria because Judith Chapman is great at what she does.  No one is neutral on either of these characters.<br>  <br>  So many people are neutral on characters like Victoria, Lily, etc. because they're not portrayed by the very best of actors.... actors that  bring passion to their roles evoke passionate responses by the viewers.|`|75zggy81aa	She had a MINOR part in Double Jeopardy- hardly a part you would want to bring up to validate her acting ability. I think she is just "ok" which would explain why she works as an actress for a day time soap. Not to be completely rude but its a soap and you are starting to sound like that "leave Brittany alone" fan! Its part of her job to know that her character wont be liked by everyone and all actors know that they are portrayed as their characters and therefore they will also be bashed in the process. I like most of the characters and actors on Y&R with very few exceptions, i dont think michelle stands out anymore than any other actress/actor on the show- including your beloved sharon lol.<br>  <br>  PS. SC fans may say that about MS, but it is just as hypocritical for you to judge SC. Then you go on and say how SC is plain blah blah blah- we'll thats nice but MS isn't any more grand. Only to you and other Phyllis fans, because, you dont like Sharon's character. You are just as bad as any SC fan you despise. WHOO HOO she was a good actress in a LIFETIME movie, and so good may i add that you haven't seen the whole thing.<br>  <br>  You seem to like to stir the pot so good for you! But you really should find more concrete facts to back up all the great things you say about ms/phyllis and all the horrible things you write about sc/sharon. All you have are opinions.|`|e99ea32489fc5dbc539f321016b1f8f7aa	Here's the thing- she's got some bad habits. For instance, constantly says "Right?" at the end of sentences. Victor has a similar habit - he says "You got that?" all the time! I hate picking up on stuff like that- good actors would either catch themselves being redundant or would accept constructive criticism and work to change the problem! If you pay attention, you'll see what I mean.|`|AA11952412	It is the 'either/or' for a lot of Y*R fans.  For me personally, it isn't.  I opt, hands down, for Michelle Stafford's portrayal of Phyllis.  I have since day one.  She caught my eye with her ability to be the underdog, wench, loving mother, most hated, best scheming, yet most rooted for woman on the show.  What you see with MS is what you get - nothing in between.|`|AA12062912	Phyllis is awesome. I think she is the best daytime actress on any soap. She can play ANY part. I think she is wasting her talent on Y and R. She is so much better than most movie actresses. I would hate for her to leave the show though.|`|C3yO4HYUaa	You mean like the same class and decency you have? I have read your posts on Sharon Case. When you criticize the looks of a TV character, you are criticizing the person in real life as well.<br>  I like Michelle Stafford, just not Phyllis.|`|rYA2KCnUaa	I hate the scheming actress, but I do like Michelle Stafford for betraying the role very well, i would have to say she is a very good actress.|`|EPPb5pRBaa	I think 'Phyliss' Michelle Stafford is a good actress, i just don't like her character.|`|7912f79fee900d73d9e2592b682e2b28aa	i love phyliss.shes cool.and michelle stafford is a fabulous actress.phyliss is one of my fav characters on y-n-r.|`|AA10252869	I love Phyllis  I am tired of whiny Sharon|`|ANfILQFeaa	I love the character Phylis , the character is at her best when she is plotting and scheming.  Nick and Sharon, the characters, belong together in my opinion.  <br>  People need to realize the difference between reality and the soap world. People tend to forget that Actors and Actress , are  not one and the same as the character they portray.  That is why they call it Acting.  Too many people take soaps way to seriously.  I love my soaps, but I don't yell curse or downgraded the actor or actress who portray characters I dislike!|`|ce35927379e187a9a9405823379c0faaaa	I love both Michelle Stafford And Sharon Case as actresses. I have the ability to separate both the Actresses and the Characters. At times I hate Phyllis, and love Sharon. I've never hated Sharon and I know she's not perfect. I also know that Phyllis is not perfect, but she can avoid much of the crap she's pulled. As for both actresses, I'm willing to bet that they are really friends in life.|`|LO3BMobRaa	That maybe because she is conniving like this in real life. It's nothing to portray your own self for a living.

DJbEN5oyaa	This guy claims to have an IQ of 150, OK then he should of known by acting like an arrogant pig on television and by the things he said that he would be trashed by the public.<br>   I've never watched the show and this episode was the first & last time I'll ever watch it.<br>  <br>  His wife Rene says she has degrees, not so, she is a Scientologist and got some new age degree from them that lets her stand in the middle of a room and scream. "Out bad energy OUT!!" I laughed when I saw this.<br>  <br>   He was let go from sitting on two boards like oreillysleather said as his bosses saw what kind of a man Mr. Fowler really was. <br>  <br>  He really put his foot in his mouth, I'd say clear up to his hip.|`|Ssxe6a5jaa	You need to watch the whole episode. He was on Wife Swap who ended up with a wife who was from a town of 55 and was poorly educated. Through the whole show her lack of knowledge and education is evident like when she was reading the rules of the new home she was in it stated that they enjoyed going to the symphony and the woman could not pronounce it let alone figure out what it was. Stephen Fowler is a British man who married an American they both enjoy educating themselves further. He believes education is the most important thing and sends his kids to a very expensive bilingual school. Fowler made some comments about her lack of education and said things like "The only languages you seem to know are bad English and Redneck."<br>  <br>   I do not disagree with his point that this woman is extremely uneducated but I do believe he could have been nicer. I also think that people are making too big of a deal out of this situation. <br>  <br>  I tried my hardest to be as unbiased as possible in the first part.. Watch the episode and make up you own mind.|`|gkoX68Awaa	A psuedo intellectual from England who spent the entire episode making another woman miserable calling her fat, stupid, he insulted the military, Middle America just for starters.<br>  <br>  He is pretty universally hated. A complete boob. He has had to quit his jobs and the boards he was on because of his appearance on television. He draws negative attention to the companies he was associated with|`|DafekVxjaa	You just have to watch the show and judge it for yourself.  No one can answer this question for you because no one knows how you feel about people from different parts of the country.  While some may say that the woman was uneducated, others may say that she just wasn't as highly educated as this man is--or thinks he is.  I think that when you claim to be so intelligent, you wouldn't treat people the way that he did.  He was extremely rude and had an ego the size of the US.  He seemed to criticize Americans and the lives that they have--if they weren't the same as his.  Just because people to not go to college or the symphony, it does not mean that they are stupid.  He took it too far.  I think more than anything, though, people are angry with him because of the things that he was teaching his children.  I don't think that it was a good idea to get his children involved the way that he did.  More than anyone, I feel sorry for what for children had to go through and endure.<br>  <br>  The whole premise behind these shows is that people from two totally different worlds are mixed together.  He should have known that he was going to be paired with the wife of someone who was not like him.  In my opinion, if he could not live with that idea, then he shouldn't have signed up for the show.  <br>  <br>  Like I said, though, you should watch the show and make a judgment for yourself.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps: B|`|12Nou1pvaa	i was wondering the same thing, then i also you tubed it last week and immediately joined the I HATE Stephen fowler site, i cant stand him or his family, i hope everyone that knows them have made there lives miserable|`|oO4TUkVkaa	He is an complete idiot.  Yes the women was overweight and not the most intelligent person but there is a thing called tact.  He should have just kept his mouth shut and got through the show.  By attacking her he made all intelligent individuals with a flare for learning look like very ugly, mad at the world people.

hSpsroCXaa	1) Do you find at least SOME truth in Pain's words?<br>  <br>  I find a little truth in his words, mainly the part where he says there will always be war.<br>  <br>  2) What do you think of how Nagato looks?!<br>  <br>  I think he looks i'll, although since you can see his ribs and all the bones in his shoulders due to how skinny he is it makes me wonder why his body is like that or if he can't eat for some reason.<br>  I kinda like the way he looks though. <br>  Naruto just got interesting, well for me atleast.<br>  <br>  3) Just want to let it be known to all the people that say I was wrong in saying Rikudo was the real Pain... I was lol<br>  <br>  Ok lol. <br>  For the guy below incase you see it... Rikudo Sennin was the first person to posses the Rinnengan, and the founder of the Ninja wold. "The Sage of the Six Paths"<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  4) What do you think was up with Pein saying that he created akatsuki when he is the one who takes orders from the older than him Madara Uchiha?! There is proof that he is the true leader of akatsuki wouldn't you say?<br>  <br>  I wouldn't say that this is proof that Pain is the true leader over Madara... because, well in my opinion he is either runing or second in command of a secret orginization, and if Madara is the leader, Pain would have been told to keep quiet about it considering Madara is posing as Tobi rather than just being himself.<br>  <br>  Also if anyone from Konoha or any of the villages get word that Madara is still alive, then they can attempt to kill him before his Eternal Mangekyou Sharingan are at full power again.<br>  <br>  5) Who do you think will fight Konan if anyone?<br>  <br>  I think it will turn out to be Sakura or Shikamaru...although it could go another way where Pain is defeated and it turns out Konan really didn't want to fight, she was just trying to protect Nagato or something like that.<br>  <br>  ok thats all<br>  <br>  Ok :o|`|1p0qP4yXaa	YOO! lol<br>  <br>  1) Do you find at least SOME truth in Pain's words?<br>  >>> Well yes, there is some. Tho, I think that the word "justice" has been tainted so many times by so many people, and it makes you think: what really is justice? Sure, he may want to bring peace, but peace through destruction is a horrible way to try to bring peace, and it's kind of an oxymoron in itself as well. <br>  Sheesh, I can see this whole thing turning into a big debate if people keep talking about it >.>"<br>  <br>  2) What do you think of how Nagato looks?!<br>  >>> kinda creepy but it also makes sense when you think about it. Putting all his chakra into dead bodies would most certainly take a huge toll on his body, but he does it cuz he's so drivin and believes in what he's doing<br>  <br>  3) Just want to let it be known to all the people that say I was wrong in saying Rikudo was the real Pain... I was lol<br>  >>> lol I heard from someone that Nagato was the real Pein, and to be honest I agreed with that being possible more than I did when you told me it was Rikudo, I just didn't say anything cuz it confused me a little <br>  <br>  4) What do you think was up with Pein saying that he created akatsuki when he is the one who takes orders from the older than him Madara Uchiha?! There is proof that he is the true leader of akatsuki wouldn't you say?<br>  >>> I think him saying that is just a front, just like when everyone says he's the leader. He simply says that to hide the fact that Madara is in charge, tho Pein is still working for his own goal.<br>  <br>  5) Who do you think will fight Konan if anyone?<br>  >>> I want a bunch of Kunoichi to gang up on her >:D<br>  lol but really, maybe Sakura or Tsunada, I'm not sure tho<br>  <br>  well answering all that was rather refreshing (don't ask why lol)<br>  <br>  Peace Out|`|AV51DCKNaa	1) Do you find at least SOME truth in Pain's words?<br>  <br>  Yes, Pains words bring meaning to true pain but true pain can not be countered with threats of more pain, because the sum of true pain is what he is resorting to.<br>  <br>  2) What do you think of how Nagato looks?!<br>  <br>  Nagato looks as i basicly imagined he would other then thedeathly ill/ sick thing, because he would have to have hundreds and hundreds of the chakra recivers in his body to send out signals to the 6 paths of pain not to mention all the other pains that have dies befor he shows up in the manga.<br>  <br>  3) Just want to let it be known to all the people that say I was wrong in saying Rikudo was the real Pain... I was lol<br>  <br>  whos, Rikudo? Yahiko is the name of the one that we are lead to belive is the real pain.<br>  <br>  4) What do you think was up with Pein saying that he created akatsuki when he is the one who takes orders from the older than him Madara Uchiha?! There is proof that he is the true leader of akatsuki wouldn't you say?<br>  <br>  True, he does take orders from Tobi (I know it clearly says hes madara uchiha and theres a high chance it is madara but I still dont belive it is so im going to call him Tobi not madara, and fine once its proven or not prove you can eather belive me or rub it it in my face that he is/isnt) but although he takes orders from Tobi he is the founder of akatsuki and he covers up the fact that he is not the leader by allowing Tobi in as a recruit although Tobi is the one who enabled him to make akatsuki.<br>  <br>  5) Who do you think will fight Konan if anyone?<br>  <br>  I think definatly it will be a combo of Inoichi (Inos dad), hinata, shikamaru and Shikaku (shikamarus dad)

JyxNA1o0aa	Well Slash and Izzy from back then Guns N' Roses wrote Mr. Brownstone on a grocery bag! Try that!|`|rmkganLQaa	i always always always have my spiral notebook with me. i got one of those nice ones with the covers on it so it won't wear out, because i abuse it quite a bit -- it goes everywhere with me! sometimes if a good line comes to me, i just pull it out wherever i am and write it down so i don't forget. but if i am seriously writing a song, i'm in my room with my guitar or piano with the door closed.<br>  <br>  and i usually edit my lyrics as i write the music and sing through it, so i usually only re-write it once or twice. good luck! :]|`|gMaeE2vAaa	The only way to write a good song, is to write until you know you are done.  If you question and think you want to add more, DO IT.  Writing comes from everything. I like to make songs about stories... kinda maiden-esque|`|kwB9e37vaa	i write them in graffitti all over my walls.<br>  xD|`|i5CkNa5Qaa	Personally, I bought two notebooks one for my band member and one for myself. Just a cheap, 70 page, college ruled, spiral notebook. It's not special at all, but it becomes special by the things you write in it. But at random times, lyrics come to you in a split second and you might not have that one notebook or laptop with you. So it really doesn't matter where you write it, as long as you write it down.<br>  <br>  <br>  To your second question, a song can usually have up to like 100 pages or more! You can't be certain. For example, pretend you suddenly get an inspiration and start jotting things down on a notebook. You figure out a melody to go along with it and you write the notes down in that notebook. Then you might add chords and such to the song and that's three pages for you. But let's say you figured out the chords don't match the melody. You throw one away. You write on another sheet of paper and you write down the chords again. Again it doesn't match the melody. Or possibly you don't like the melody and throw it away and start over. And there are those songs where you write it on a little sheet of paper and you're done. So you see, there isn't really a certain amount of pages.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|kILkOc6saa	For me, I usualyl don't get inspiration unless it's raining out, and when I write it I'm usually sitting at my desk and looking out the window... so I usually have paper around, which I then transfer into a notebook aand finally onto my computer...|`|oOSNI3wbaa	well i'm an "anywhere" kinda guy.<br>  if a lyric enters my head i'll grab anything from a paper bag to a reciept to a scrap piece of paper to write it down on. <br>  then i'll get a single sheet of paper and work out the rest of the song and arrange the lyrics and chorus order.<br>  then when i think it's finished, i'll put it in my "special notebook" (ha!) that i keep all my completed songs in.<br>  <br>  that reminds me, i need another notebook!
hmsCFQocaa	I starred the hell out of you for an intelligent question.<br>  <br>  The problem with being creative is that it's the opposite of being organized. You have to be organized and creative separately.<br>  <br>  So, you write it down wherever it happens, and you get to a mental zone where you can reach that creative point. I use any notebook handy, then  type it into Microsoft Word documents to give it that "official" feel. Sometimes, even when the song is 2/3 done, or even just a chorus and idea, I will do this. Most of my songs never go over one page, since I want to keep them sendable on certain web sites like Y!A.<br>  <br>  The weird thing that happens to me is I am a security guard, and I can get hit with ideas on a slow watch. I've probably written 10 of my 55 lyrics to date on duty. My best love song may be the one I wrote dead tired at 5am at the World Market Center Main Lobby, Bldg. B when I realized I was coming home to no one.<br>  <br>  My recommendations are taking creative writing classes, and also reading books on creativity such as A Whack On The Side Of The Head, by Roger von Oech.<br>  <br>  Good luck with your writing. Maybe we could collaborate sometime. I love collaborations.|`|aXm9uo7Eaa	For me,it just all depends on where I am.<br>  I have a Notebook for it,but I ended up using it for school work also.<br>  I either write in that,on Microsoft Word,or if I don't have either of those two things,I'll take out my phone and save the lyrics onto my phone.<br>  <br>  I usually only need one sheet of paper for my songs,but I tend to use front and back. I don't tend to mess up very often,so I don't need more than one or two papers.|`|D9iE2JBKaa	i have this cool notebook i take every where and i have atleast 100 songs in it <br>  <br>  ummmmm my songs are for my band so idk how many pages i use|`|ynuLj6IYaa	on the toilet<br>  they tend to be very angry songs tho<br>  :D|`|wGUX2LSOaa	Usually it just comes out freestyle as i record it.<br>  but most of the time its a scribbled mess over the computer notebook paper or anything i can write on at the very moment the idea springs up.|`|Mn8xq268aa	on w.e piece of paper on my desk...<br>  <br>  then i let people hear read them or listen to my track..<br>  <br>  <a href="http://thenewebonics.com/index.php" rel="nofollow">http://thenewebonics.com/index.php</a>|`|CkIeCNS4aa	I usually type my lyrics so I can easily edit them, but before I had a laptop, I used to write in a "special" notebook that I liked just because it was my favorite color (red).  Usually my songs start as poems that I edit as I go, so I don't really know how many drafts I go through...

Zc15R4k5aa	Getting professional lessons is probably the best way to go.  Check around for local guitar/music shops to see if they offer lessons.  You can always teach yourself, but getting started with lessons will give you a good overview, or at least the basics of playing the guitar.  Also, if you take lessons, you can practice when you get home, or whenever you have any free time.<br>  <br>  I would recommend getting an acoustic guitar to start with.  They aren't as loud as an electric guitar can be (your parents would appreciate that), plus you have to buy an amp and cables if you get an electric (you can play without the amp, but it won't sound that great).  If you learn how to play on an acoustic, you can always get a bass guitar later on.  You will probably figure out which type of guitar you like playing eventually (bass guitar or six string).<br>  <br>  One thing I highly recommend is to get a good guitar tuner.  One of the top reasons people quit learning how to play the guitar is that their guitar is out of tune.  They might think they sound terrible playing, when it's just the guitar is out of tune, which makes it sound bad.<br>  <br>  You can also learn to play existing songs by learning to read tablature, or "tabs".  Tabs is much easier to learn how to read than sheet music.  Basically it shows you which strings to play, and in what order, to go along with the song.  It will make sense after you start learning it.  <br>  <br>  It would be great to start learning how to play guitar when you are in 8th grade.  Some people don't start until many many years later, and wish they had started sooner.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|DXotNZ9eaa	When i was in Junior High, I took a Guitar Lessons Class, Ask your principal if he'll start one. Unless your done school then i cant help u there im not the brightest.

Z0odTlyQaa	Stroke their ego, they love that!|`|V20PTwMmaa	well jlo is LEO and she loves her butt praised|`|l3b0hjdWaa	don't talk about how great you think she is.<br>  just talk to her like you would talk to one of your friends. be friendly. smile. ask her questions so that it's not basically you just talking to yourself. express your opinion on certain things|`|de25107f3b25bf271852feb4203decd7aa	That's so strange. I found it very to talk with leo girls! I'm almost NEVER myself with new people. This particular leo girl just idk, worked me in some way where I was just myself and we hit it off. I think leo girls are awesome. I couldn't imagine not being able to hang with them. You should definitely talk about how awesome she looks or whatever. You score major points with leos when you compliment them on something.|`|AgzRyqWTaa	yes show her how much you care,give her compliments,take her out to dinner or the movie tell her things to make her smile and always make her want to talk to you more and more you will love her and she will return the feeling.|`|utJE0EyIaa	lol....keep it casual as well as interesting. Don't bore her to death just be yourself and have fun. Try to be diverse and talk about exciting topics and compliment her without looking desperate.|`|47l1Sumeaa	Just have a casual conversation.|`|KR8RUXLSaa	._. my lovey for almost 3 years now is a leo...THEY ARE ATTENTION WHORES. lol they have GOT to be the main attraction or no attraction at all. they love giving/ getting expensive things and getting their effing ego stroked, the fact that she is a Leo MEANS EVERYTHING by the way. especially if shes into zodiacs.|`|YtAkmjoyaa	Leos....don't move on them so quick<br>  Yeah like everyone says. Just talk casually.<br>  you can start acting up and talk however you like as soon as you know for sure you got their Loyalty/Respect.|`|q3KCDrMAaa	I don't think this is a case of astrology or her being a Leo. I think you can't be yourself with her, because you don't feel equal.  And that's ok... Just let the relationship 'grow'. Become friends. Speak casually with her and look for things you have you common that you can talk to her about. Let it build... <br>  <br>  Most good relationships take time.<br>  <br>  Good luck! :)|`|Tat8nhjoaa	I'm a Leo, female, and I love it when guys get all tongue-tied around me. But only for awhile. Eventually you need to come right out and say what's on your mind, tell me how you feel, otherwise how will I ever know? I'm not a mind-reader. So, my personal opinion is, tell me (her) how you feel.|`|5HYbJmbcaa	her being a leo has NOTHING to do with it. just be casual, cool and be yourself! she'll love you for you!|`|hTdMv3BUaa	hmmm idk capricorns are better  =] lmaoo what sign are you look up online or in a magazine what your love factor is with a leo read up on them|`|3VKiFmMJaa	Definitely keep it casual, but try to calm down so u can maintain your confidence (extremely important)! Please do *not* proceed to tell her this early on how much u care and how great she is--she might be somewhat turned off by this because it is so soon (I know I would be lol)!<br>  <br>  Be genuine, try and keep the conversation light and fun so u guys r laughing together, flirt with her and definitely compliment her but make sure it is sincere and thoughtful--i.e. if u tell her she has beautiful eyes, don't just say that!! Make it more special and add that her eyes are what drew u to her in the first place. U could ask her what her favorite trait on a man is for example, and after she answers she will presumably ask what yours is. This is when u can say something like "The eyes! I love eyes they can be so expressive! Your eyes are initially what drew me to u, they are deep and almond shaped, very intriguing"--or something? whatever it is, make sure it is specific and unique to her so that she feels special. Then stop there so u aren't fawning over her. It should be just enough to capture her interest and leave her wanting more. She will appreciate it and remember u for it--u  want to stand out from the rest, don't you?<br>  <br>  Take it in slow steps first until things are more comfortable and then u should be fine, and feelings should be mutual. For now though, play it safe, u can't go wrong with a sincere compliment and a confident yet laid back attitude. Good luck!

6hnEhNcQaa	Currently: To understand your destiny you need to practice meditation and reflection. Make time for yourself, away from people that may misunderstand you as they will only make things more difficult. That does not mean that you should remove yourself from all society, but take the time to truly delve into your soul. Use your deep perception to penetrate to the heart of things, but respect the essential nature of what you scrutinize.<br>  <br>  To Keep in Mind: Emotional satisfaction is an essential food for the soul. By delving deeply into the waters of the psyche, you discover fundamental clues to the art of soul making. Destiny's path unfolds when the gifts of a responsive heart are realized. You are submerged in a miasmic or misty romanticism. Idealistic dreams of 'true love' are the barrier keeping you from making lasting attachments. Dispel the illusions of love and welcome its reality. Beware of emotional dishonesty and above all do not use sexual manipulation. <br>  <br>  Future: The past falls behind and is regenerated as the future. Opportunities are stirring, heralding new vistas. Old ways of doing and behaving can be replaced by new ways that your experience shows you. Do not get stuck in the past. Memories of the past should serve to guide you, not hold you back.|`|i0bFgktUaa	Your Personal Day of Death is... <br>   <br>    Saturday, January 23, 2066|`|6x7zV65Xaa	is 18 Novembuary?|`|FIdA3FiCaa	2nd answer made me laugh.|`|MiKrWuM6aa	Oh yes... yes I see it all clearly...<br>  <br>  You will become a homeless old hag that sleeps in a sewer.

TDO6EQsgaa	Yes this is a prequel. It's all about wolverine and the past he can't remember in the first three. He's actually been alive for a LONG time. He was one of the first mutants and IS the oldest because he is immortal. Before he met Wlliam Striker he was just bone and claws, until 15 years prior to the first xmen, when striker covered his bones in adamantium. Making him indestructible as well as immortal. There is a video on youtube about it that is awesome if your an xmen fan.|`|KrDin6i6aa	It makes no sense to me because in other two X-men it said that wolverine was a soldier and then he was made w/ his hand things but in this one it says it because of his parents, which makes not want to watch it anymore. :(|`|wbTlralRaa	I believe its not going to be an x men movie, but rather the story of wolverine
CKKisY5Aaa	Drink lots of water and citrus filled drinks. Avoid sugar and clearing your throat. I'll explain. Water is just good for anything. Citrus clears off any gunk that is attached to your vocal chords, like sugar. Clearing your throat takes more muscles than anything you do with your throat. If you need to, coughing is fine. <br>  Also pick about 3 paragraphs from a book or a newspaper. Then once a day, read through it (trying to clearly enunciate each word) in your lowest possible voice, then mid-lowest, then normal speaking voice, then mid-highest and finally highest. This will give you endurance as well as range. For being a voice actor, it's best to have a few different voices that you can speak with, so every now and then flavor the reading up by adding a little rasp and adding different tones to your voice. For instance, trying reading it with a James Earl Jones style voice, while your reading it in your high voice.|`|sCnksozaaa	warm-ups  or if it gets hoarse just rest it  you dont want more damage than you already have|`|i8Pl0Pejaa	Drink lots of water, and milk (haha, well it works for me, I don't know if it will work for you! I usually have some before I play a show) and practice, try not to sing so much from your throat, but from the diaphragm. Warm up before you sing, this could be another reason why you're voice becomes hoarse after singing. I have the same thing too, but it really helps to keep drinking lots of fluids, try not to smoke or drink, warm up and practice :) And you should be fine haha.<br>  Good luck!|`|7SwPIjCjaa	I second that guy with the long paragraph<br>  I was gonna say that<br>  but he beat me to it<br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090222222119AA5yeM3">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a>

That is my favorite show ever.  This is just a little food for thought, the guy who created the OC (Josh Schwartz) is also the creator and writer for Chuck and Gossip girl so you should try both of those shows too.

jOM4bBMPaa	30 Rock is totally funnier!  The Generalissimo episode that was just on where the Spanish soap opera version of Alec Baldwin ties a stick of dynamite to a kid's head to blow them up was hilarious!!!  I backed it up on the DVR at least 3 or 4 times & laughed so hard I cried!  I don't find the Office funny, I can't get into it.|`|K1GYtYryaa	the office|`|JOIZH0Bsaa	The Office is much better.

t2R3mEMoaa	If you read the guide lines you will see there are many things unacceptable on this site. That is why they have a "report abuse" below each question. Use it if it offends you and does not fit with these rules, in fact don't hesitate to use it. They will weed out the rudeness if it is not okay, foul language, personal and/or sexual innuendo and much worse. This is the only way we can keep this site respectable. There are age limits here as well and some things should not be said but still are. Report it! The individual will be taken off this site if to many reports are made about them and that is okay by me as well. You are not the only one that is seeing this, but to many people are just letting it go and shouldn't be.We all have a responsibility to keep this site respectable and dignified or like other things, it will just go to the dogs and eventually we will lose it for good. I for one really don't want to see this happen. Do you?|`|ftixHrOnaa	You got a problem with me?|`|mggll8dRaa	I'm sure Their not happy with that...!!|`|C2sZREuAaa	Because they have social workers telling them that we are safe.|`|WnygliJfaa	they keep us young|`|AA11784965	Because rude people know how to trick people into thinking they are normal.

LfRSzapUaa	Juno's stepmom felt it was inappropriate for a pregnant teenager to be going (uninvited) to a married mans house while the wife wasnt home. The family does not know the Lorings and for all they do know, Mr. Lorings may have had bad intentions because he knew Juno was sexually active (obviously). And towards the end he even told Juno he was going to leave his wife. It was just an inappropriate situation that a teenage girl should not have been in, I believe.|`|QMYNDtHgaa	Young Girls even if they are pregnant should not be sexually infatuated with older married men.  <br>  <br>  Jason Bateman was the only part of the movie I liked even though he had better chemistry with Ellen Page.

a1Ngi39Xaa	I give the award for Brooke hating to Stephanie.  She has been through Brooke with Ridge a zillion times now, Brooke with her ex-husband Eric, and Brooke with Thorne as well if I'm not mistaken.<br>  <br>  Taylor dislikes her too and for good reason.  Can't they find a good man for Taylor?<br>  <br>  But who they should really blame is Ridge and Eric.  Hold the men accountable for a change!|`|LO3BMobRaa	I'd say Stephanie, because Brooke has been like an incurable disease with her. She's been all, up, in, through, and around the Forrester family. Brooke started with her husband, then her eldest son, second eldest son, back to eldest son, and now her sister is about to do the same thing.|`|fcPiQDwEaa	I'd say Taylor. Even though they both hate Brooke for the same reasons, Stephanie can handle Brooke, but remember Taylor had an emotional breakdown because of Brooke. Also whereas Brooke only took Eric from Stephanie, he took Ridge and Nick from Taylor and also she had to deal with the fact that Jack is biologically Brooke's son.|`|msUIsv8maa	I dislike Stephenies Character more than any other on the show and Katie too.|`|9FCxm8qJaa	I think Stephanie dislikes Brooke the most.|`|LkTcLWTOaa	Wow! I would say they are neck and neck. maybe stephanie is a tad ahead of taylor.|`|rbI9oODCaa	I would have to say that Stephanie hates Brook more because Stephanie has to see Brooke every day of her life it seems like because Brooke works for Forrester plus Brook is currently involved with Stephanie's son Ridge. And also Brook has managed to sleep with all of the Forrester men. I am honestly surprised that she hasn't tried to have a fling with Felicia yet. And Brook's son is just like his mom. What a shame!|`|rYA2KCnUaa	I would have to say Stephanie Forrester, because Brooke had slept her way through the company and seduced her husband and sons! LOL
AA11640951	Possibly. With all the time shifts, I'm getting very worried we're going to be handed some tale where everything we've seen thus far is do to with our cast going back in time and having an effect on the events we've already seen in seasons 1-4.   <br>  <br>  Locke has meet a past version of Richard, Daniel and Charlotte both seem to have a past on the island.  Now we get a Dharma version of Jinn.  While it's probably safe to say the Losties are victims of their own actions, does that include the island as well?  Does this interaction with the past suggest the characters in Lost created their own future fates and don't recall it?|`|ba52jQHyaa	I think they might, I'm guessing that it may turn out that Farraday is responsible for starting all this in motion,|`|HEs6bzOtaa	we will soon find out i guess<br>  <br>  lost is awesome|`|dMBSE8ilaa	It looks that way, especially with Jin driving the van and it looked brand new, and he was wearing a DHARMA uniform.|`|GBKaftrJaa	I'm not so sure it is stuck in the 70's.  I'll be happy for them if it is and they don't have to go through any more time flashes.  But it was a time flash that took all the people out of the plane and put them on the island... so if they had a flash, wouldn't the people on the island have experienced that also?

This year they're doing one medley and they only nominated 3 songs (two from Slumdog). Somehow they declined to nominate the Springstein song from the Wrestler that won at the Golden Globes.<br>  <br>  Other than that, just the little comedic performances during the presentations and the opening number by Hugh Jackman (which was surprisingly entertaining).|`|9yASXPuVaa	yes, they perform all of the nominated songs before announcing the winner (go slumdog!)|`|lQs8HfOEaa	i dont think so.....|`|CEKZsoFRaa	yeah but I'm sure they'll suck

AbRfd29Haa	For any kind of music: practice, practice, practice. You can write for years, but if you don't perform, you'll never get the performance chops you're after. <br>  <br>  Is it all the time, or just when recording? You should spend some time every day performing your songs... you'll get better, you really will. If it's recording that puts you off... just turn on the PC any time you practice... you can record hours of stuff on a typical PC and still have room to do more. So just turn on the PC and practice. You won't think about the fact you're recording while you do it. If you think you nailed something, you can go back and listen to it... if not, you're still practicing, you're still getting better. If the session didn't go so well, just erase it when you're done. But save a few tracks every week, and you'll be able to hear that you are getting better. <br>  <br>  I do similar things with my guitar playing... I do get nervous on stage, in front or people, or even when recording, compared to "just playing". So I have one of those portable recorders... it can do 8 hours or more (and my fingers start to bleed after four). So I just turn it on and forget about it.<br>  <br>  But the big thing -- practice. Every day. Any rapper or rocker you hear these days, that's why you're listening to them rather than they to you right now. Well, ok, for you, it's that whole "I'm 15" thing.. you got time. But now's the time to get serious about it, if it's important to you.|`|q4XUy0Duaa	You need to do something to calm down.<br>  <br>  Here's some suggestions:<br>  1- Smoke a blunt<br>  2- Get a nut off before you record<br>  3- Believe in what you're rapping about, and you will be more confident and have more of a presence on the mic.|`|bFdn8wVLaa	record alone...you are the only one who you can hear it theirs no one els ...only you and your computer...if you don't like it, just delete it..and record again until you get the right one...<br>  <br>  i also sing and i also feel what you feel...and its hard..you what to do this but nervousness is pulling you back....and this is what i do<br>  <br>  <br>  nervousness  is a hindrance for success, and you should conger it!<br>  <br>  Good luck on your rap career...|`|rBatRZDSaa	All you really need to do is "act". I mean, it seems like all good rappers can get into movies and do really well. It also might depend on the program you use and the type of mic. I use cubasis and that works really well. I've heard that pro tools is the best program though. I rap too man, so I know how that is. Hit me up at myspace.com/deligs if ya got any more questions. And like that other guy said...... smokin a blunt wouldn't hurt ;)|`|gMaeE2vAaa	man... you think you are nervous now... Im 20 in a band and when we go to an actual studio i shake...<br>  But the whole thing is just relax... Become completely focused on what it is you are doing, and just let it flow|`|g8hsRwCzaa	just be confident <br>  and if no ones there<br>  u dont have anything to worry about

Vkff8N8Taa	Listen to Grassroots & Transistor (that's the album Beautiful Disaster is on).<br>  <br>  If you really want to open up your taste in music (that's similar to 311), try listening to some Sublime, Incubus, RHCP, and Keller Williams.<br>  <br>  For metal, I like Dream Theater; idk if you ever heard of them, but they're really good. <br>  <br>  :)|`|5b218420f6e58d52278efc9527f29a95aa	I can't say what's best by them as I think it's a matter of opinion, but my favorites are Frolic Room, Beyond the Gray Sky, and I'll Be Here Awhile. Awesome to hear you're trying to get into them. If you like them I think you'll like the b Foundation, too.|`|ZJMpOsokaa	i like "down" by 311. good song.<br>  <br>  sublime is kind of like 311. i suggest "seed" or "what i've got"
oOSNI3wbaa	find any local music mags that your city may have (they're usually referred to as "rags") or any other type of free newspaper type publication in your city and take out an ad.<br>  also try and make friends with people that like the same kind of music you do. eventually you will meet someone who either plays an instrument and wants to start a band or someone who knows someone who does.|`|RLQVRuG8aa	depending on where you live you can put up signs or take out an ad in the local newspaper. if you are an adult i don't know if people will take you seriously. i play bass and live in new york if it helps. all of the bands i was in fell apart because nobody really cared about the music, it was all bout being sellouts.
956d43fbc612852be9834658deb4139faa	House himself of course but then it has to be Wilson. The interaction between him and House is hilarious.  I love every episode but the ending scene in Lines In The Sand really touched me.<br>  <br>  As Adam and his parents are leaving, they thank House, who is sitting nearby. Adam holds eye contact with House and gives him his PSP, a most unusual gesture for a child with autism. Wilson comments: "That was a ten" in reference to a scale of how good in a moment being a docter can be. The new carpet covering the old, blood-stained carpet is rolled up, and Cameron says to House: "All change is bad? It's not true, you know".|`|PAZWfnFtaa	I Love Dr. Cuddy.  I think the tension between her and House is great.  My all time fave episode is "Three Stories."|`|Nr8ap8khaa	house is the only reason to watch the rest only look better because of him<br>  <br>  chase is kind of a jerk and a whiner i'm done with him.|`|u4liwDhAaa	My favorite character is House.  He is amazing even with his bad behavior!  As far as episode, I don't really have one yet.  They're all pretty good.|`|mVlA3u3zaa	I like House, Cuddy, and Chase..

n6nwpanAaa	I've scrolled Through the answers, and it looks like I'll be the lonely  opinion that says no, by definition, it is not an instrument.  By saying that, I'm speaking only of technicality, and do not imply that possessing vocal talent is more of a "lucky gift" than a developed and practiced skill that needs perfection in the same way an instrumentalist does.|`|2X2wjYb4aa	Hi Saucerful,<br>  <br>  Absolutely. Annie Haslam used to sing wordless "vocalise" passages in several songs when she was the lead singer for Renaissance. Another singer who has a wonderfully expressive voice is Kate Bush. Her contribution to Prog Rock - via her own work and also providing backing vocals, especially on Peter Gabriel 3 (the melting face album) - unquestionably proves how a voice can be an instrument all by itself.|`|EFsM3t9Xaa	It's definitely an instrument, sometimes the most important one!  Have you ever listened to a band do a cover of a favorite artist?  It immediately sounds very different.  While it might be difficult to distinguish two different drum players, changing the singer produces a very different sound.<br>  <br>  For example, compare the original sound of the song "Under Pressure" (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtrEN-YKLBM)" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtrEN-YKL...</a> to MCR's cover of it (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7eliOabU3I)." rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7eliOabU...</a>  MCR does a little more with the drums, but besides that, they definitely seem different.|`|ArKT9O7Maa	Oh hell yes.  There could be a song with the world's best instrument pieces, but if the voice is horrible i won't listen to it.  The voice is probably the MOST important instrument in rock music.  With ACDC and Ozzy Osbourne, the voices are right and i love the songs.  With a lot of other kinds of songs... the voice either doesn't seem to match the music or makes it sound depressed.|`|hMPI3TxTaa	Yup.|`|dFacbjIZaa	I sure do. Equally important with the Guitar or the Keys.|`|VSw6eN4Baa	Definitely. If you cannot sing well, it's as bad as not being able to play an instrument well.|`|kILkOc6saa	Yup, it is. Hey Sarah :D<br>  <br>  Although, some vocalists just can't play their instruments very well :P|`|Vkff8N8Taa	I'd say yes, because you have the ability to control it, and it has the ability to touch and inspire people, just like a regular instrument would.|`|12QJ9QMRaa	Absolutely|`|48df0ea585c1658be36a46553408d993aa	No, not really. I don't think of it as one of the "instruments". It's too unique for that.|`|rygoLKr2aa	Yes|`|b32501726d33018adfee15dc84a32f79aa	Absolutely.  It's as much of an instrument as a guitar or percussion, plays as much of a role in a song and takes as many years to study and perfect.|`|bmP4NdKuaa	<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBbnYdVaj8E" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBbnYdVaj...</a> proof right here|`|FY8YYZgBaa	Just like an instrument, it can make or break a song. I think so, yes.|`|rRCTvT7Saa	I consider the voice an instrument in ANY genre of music!|`|9hFexadLaa	ya, you kinda need a singer except if your name is Buckethead|`|E70A7aqcaa	Yeah, but sometimes it's an instrument they'll wish they'd've left at home since it ain't so "musical".

ZfN4SSmDaa	hmmm.....<br>  <br>  ~A new priest at his first mass was so nervous he could hardly speak. After mass he asked the monsignor how he had done. The monsignor replied, "When I am worried about getting nervous on the pulpit, I put a glass of vodka next to the water glass. If I start to get nervous, I take a sip." <br>  ~So the next Sunday he took the monsignor's advice. At the beginning of the sermon, he got nervous and took a drink. He proceeded to talk up a storm. Upon return to his office after mass, he found the following note on his door: <br>  1. Sip the Vodka, don't gulp.  <br>  2. There are 10 commandments, not 12. <br>  3. There are 12 disciples, not 10. <br>  4. Jesus was consecrated, not constipated. <br>  5. Jacob wagered his donkey, he did not bet his A S S. <br>  6. We do not refer to Jesus Christ as the late J.C. <br>  7. The Father, Son, and Holy Ghost are not referred to as Daddy, Junior, and the Spook. <br>  8. David slew Goliath, he did not kick the Sh*t out of him. <br>  9. When David was hit by a rock and knocked off his donkey, don't say he was stoned off his A S S. <br>  10. We do not refer to the cross as the Big T! <br>  11. When Jesus broke the bread at the Last Supper he said, "Take this and eat it, for it is my body", he did not say, "Eat me." <br>  12. The Virgin Mary is not referred to as the, "Mary with the Cherry". <br>  13. The recommended grace before a meal is not: "Rub-A-dub-dub, thanks for the grub, yeah God". and finally... <br>  14. Next Sunday there will be a taffy-pulling contest at St.Peter's, not a peter-pulling contest at St. Taffy's.<br>  <br>  Q: How do you tell when you're drunk?<br>  A:When you swerve not to hit a tree and realize its your car air freshener. :)<br>  <br>  A first-grade teacher, Ms. Brooks, was having trouble with one of her students. The teacher asked, 'Harry, what's your problem?' <br>  Harry answered, 'I'm too smart for the 1st grade. My sister is in the 3rd grade and I'm smarter than she is! I think I should be in the 3rd grade too!' <br>  Ms. Brooks had had enough. She took Harry to the principal's office. <br>  While Harry waited in the outer office, the teacher explained to the principal what the situation was. The principal told Ms. Brooks he would give the boy a test. If he failed to answer any of his questions he was to go back to the 1st grade and behave. She agreed. <br>  Harry was brought in and the conditions were explained to him and he agreed to take the test. <br>  <br>  Principal: 'What is 3 x 3?' <br>  Harry: '9.' <br>  Principal: 'What is 6 x 6?' <br>  Harry: '36.' <br>  And so it went with every question the principal thought a 3rd grader should know. <br>  The principal looks at Ms. Brooks and tells her, 'I think Harry can go to the 3rd grade.' <br>  Ms. Brooks says to the principal, 'Let me ask him some questions.' <br>  The principal and Harry both agreed. <br>  ?<br>  <br>  Ms. Brooks asks, 'What does a cow have four of that I have only two of?' <br>  Harry, after a moment: 'Legs.' <br>  Ms Brooks: 'What is in your pants that you have but I do not have?' <br>  The principal wondered why would she ask such a question! <br>  Harry replied: 'Pockets.' <br>  Ms. Brooks: 'What does a dog do that a man steps into?' <br>  Harry: 'Pants.' <br>  Ms. Brooks: What starts with a C, ends with a T, is hairy, oval, delicious and contains thin, whitish liquid?' <br>  Harry: 'Coconut.' <br>  The principal sat forward with his mouth hanging open. <br>  Ms. Brooks: 'What goes in hard and pink then comes out soft and sticky?' <br>  The principal's eyes opened really wide and before he could stop the answer, Harry replied, 'Bubble gum.' <br>  Ms. Brooks: 'What does a man do standing up, a woman does sitting down and a dog does on three legs?' <br>  Harry: 'Shake hands.' <br>  The principal was trembling. <br>  Ms. Brooks: 'What word starts with an 'F' and ends in 'K' that means a lot of heat and excitement?' <br>  Harry: 'Firetruck.' <br>  The principal breathed a sigh of relief and told the teacher, 'Put Harry in the fifth-grade, I got the last seven question s wrong......'|`|uPU8OlPwaa	Here's one.<br>  <br>  A couple of hunters are out in the woods when one of them falls to the ground.  He doesn't seem to be breathing and his eyes are rolled back in his head.<br>  <br>  The other hunter starts to panic, then whips out his cell phone and calls 911.<br>  <br>  He frantically blurts out to the operator, "O my gawd! Help! My friend just died. He's Dead! What can I do?"<br>  <br>  The operator, trying to calm him says,  "Take it easy. I can help.  Just listen to me and follow my instructions.  First, lets make sure he's dead." There's a short pause, and then the operator hears a loud gun shot.<br>  <br>  The hunter comes back on the line and says, "OK, now what??"|`|CYhOr4s7aa	It was the end of the school day and all of the kids were anxious to go home. The teacher told the kids,”As soon as you can name the speaker of a famous quote you may leave. O.K., Who said four score and seven years ago?”<br>  <br>  Johnny lifts his hand in excitement. <br>  <br>  “Yes, Johnny?”<br>  But before he could answer, Lucy jumped in and said Abraham Lincoln.<br>  “Very good, Lucy, you may go home now.”<br>  <br>  Johnny was red in the face with anger. The teacher then gave the next quote,<br>  “Who said I have a dream..”<br>  Johnny lifted his hand excitedly again. But this time Mary interjected and said “Martin Luther King.”<br>  “Very good, Mary, you may go home now.”<br>  <br>  At this point Johnny was really frustrated and pissed off. But the teacher asked again, “Who said ask not what your country can do for you?”<br>  Johnny knew this one, he raised his hand quickly. This time Rebecca chimed in and said, “JFK”<br>  “Very good, Rebecca, you may go home now.” <br>  <br>  Now, Johnny was BOILING MAD! He turns to the kid next to him and says, “I wish these bitches would keep their mouths shut!”<br>  “Who said that?”asked the teacher.<br>  “Bill Clinton,” said Johnny, “Can I go home now?”sometimes there just isnt an argument to to had ROLFLMAO|`|x8iAd7Znaa	dONT wASTE mY tIME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!...

f2Lcv80faa	What do I think of Eminem?<br>  <br>  - Well...I think that Em is one of the best rappers alive today. The reason why I think this is because he has his own unique style that only he can own and hold down so well. His use of metaphors and words, plus his flow is what makes him so great. He can flow with any beat and make it sound good. He can say anything, and still make it sound good, which is unlike any other rapper. The way he adds humor, albeit sick humor, into his songs, makes him stand out. Not to add, the dude can freestyle, and very well at that. <br>  <br>  Eminem freestyle :<br>  <br>  If I'm elected for ten terms<br>  I'm renewing the staff after the inaugural<br>  And hiring all girls as interns<br>  If I don't like you, I'll snatch you outta your mic booth<br>  While you're rappin and pull your right through the window and fight you<br>  I'll take you straight to the pavement<br>  Uppercut you, and scrape your face wit a bracelet<br>  Like a razor that shaved it<br>  Three drinks and I'm ready to flash<br>  Runnin on stage in a G-string, wit a bee sting on my *** (Look!)<br>  It's probably all cuz I ain't awkward at all<br>  I just like to walk through the mall, stop, and talk to the wall<br>  And have a relapse after I just fought through withdrawl<br>  (Hop in the car little girl, I just bought you a doll)<br>  The Bad and Evil movement is comin<br>  Plus the music is pumpin like a pill freak wit a tube in his stomach<br>  I write a rhyme a day<br>  So it's no wonder how come your whole album<br>  Is soundin like a bunch of **** that I would say<br>  Whether it's one verse or one letter<br>  I'll probably be the cleverest one that never gets spun ever<br>  It's Slim Shady and Tony Touch, it's only us<br>  The rest of y'all are just stuck in the middle wit Monie Love<br>  <br>  ...:) xxx|`|00b0f9ddac86ff60efd1e128d1e3d175aa	overrated, weird|`|OpBFc27iaa	i dont like Em|`|rPaveCYraa	hahaha @ all the people to answer so far bein females.<br>  oh yeah... 8 mile was not written bout his life... it was written with em in mind..<br>  but @ any rate, em is one of the most talented rappers out there. he has a style that can only be matched by nas in my opinion. delevery is good, metaphores... and can take shots @ him self as well. one of the best lines to me is "i made them think they had beat me to death/ holdin my breath for like five minutes 'till they finally left/ then i ran down the hall to the janitors storage booth/ kicced the door hinge loose/ and ripped out the four inch screws/.. grabbed some sharp objects, brooms and forigen tools/ this is for every time you stole my orange juice"... there is no word in the english language that rhymes with "orange" in the traditional sense of the word, so for him to make that line work, with no fillers, is genius.|`|Ig8gn0E1aa	i love him he has great songs about his life most of the time and he has great beats and rhymes to go with his stories and songs :D<br>  i like crack a bottle also.........and a  BUNCH of his other songs!<br>  go eminem! :D|`|ReqWzUM0aa	His voice is annoying. I used to like him when I was like 10, but I'm interested in more serious songs. He's gotta few serious ones, but his voice is still annoying.|`|ZMPMqYV0aa	great freestyler<br>  he can change his style up.<br>  he has some great lyrics.<br>  fav rapper.<br>  <br>  but "crack a bottle" is eminem at his worst.|`|VtHZjeVkaa	Eminem is the best rapper alive and arguably the best ever.<br>  He can:rhyme, flow, switch his styles up, change is emotion and speed in an instant, talk about anything, relate to anyone, can make any type of record, has sick beats, can freestyle and battle, ended careers of other rappers, has the three haded monster to watch his back, kill people on their own song, has respect from much of the  game, has the record for most rap album sales in the world, has the best selling rap albums (MMLP, The Eminem Show), and can go head to head with Biggie and Pac ("Dead Wrong" and "One Day at a Time"(new versions))<br>  <br>  What other rapper has all of that<br>  In my opinion he IS The Best Rapper Ever!|`|tlklY3ykaa	he has an exxxxtremely great voice,<br>  & he's not fake. 90% of his songs have to do with a real life experience.<br>  and his movie 8 Mile was about his life to.<br>  that's whats good about Marshall Mathers, is hes not a fake =D<br>  i'm not a big rap person, but he is definitely one of the 1/3 rappers i will listen to. without a doubt =]|`|21ewjYXKaa	one of the greatest of all time. speaks clearly when he raps.  he lyrics are very creative and his style is great.  he is a good story teller.  a force to be reckoned with on the mic in a battle.  could be the voice of the 00 decade.|`|ZZv1Ivmcaa	<a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AvChGO.bpfcn6QS3Q.NC7_6u.Bd.;_ylv=3?qid=20090222191233AA2jBqX">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|hQbUwLvwaa	I think he was the sickest emcee alive on Infinite and he was pretty good on Marshall Mathers LP but then he sold out|`|HHpVBoTuaa	One of the Greatest, Arguably the best rapper alive alongside Jay-Z.|`|7lRDU6iAaa	i think his voice annoying but he sounded real good in crack a bottle|`|no44NxsDaa	He is cool, i really like his song, Crack a Bottle! :]
M7E1uIsKaa	Eminem .. He has talent|`|zVoKLysgaa	i like a few songs from both but i guess ill go with eminem|`|xi9amEG2aa	You're comparing a Rock group to a wanna be Rapper....it's obviously Blink 182.  I don't like all their songs, and they're not the best band out there, but they're certainly better than Eminem.|`|785d07b11864df1b07a99374609e381eaa	Eminem. One out of very very very very very little of rap I like.|`|4ObhfxoIaa	Eminem|`|a1566efb5533aa90596e330bc315a547aa	That doesn't even make since smart ***|`|14F4WVQjaa	:( lots of Blink-182 hate in here. Ouch.<br>  <br>  I like blink but I understand that they're not for everyone. I prefer their older stuff but that goes for a lot of bands. I think I like them mainly because they are very nostalgic for me, they bring me back to my younger days. <br>  <br>  People are bashing them a lot lately because they're getting back together. Whatever.|`|j5TOIyypaa	Yeah, that's not even the same genre.<br>  But Ill say Em, since he's my favorite rapper (although. that doesnt say much. considering I dont listen to alot of rap.)<br>  <br>   And the only song I even like a little by Blink is Damnit (&& thats because its on GH).|`|BJZq27Yoaa	I'm not so sure.<br>  They're in different genres.<br>  But so far I listen to Eminem more, because the lyrics are funneh. <br>  But, usually I just listen to metal.|`|zfadjiJVaa	Thats a freakin retarted qusetion eminem i hate blink 182|`|AgQForcYaa	Well, at least you can laugh WITH Eminem...|`|JyxNA1o0aa	Psh, Eminem duh!|`|044IeGstaa	Em! <br>  What kind of question is this?

And it was three pancakes, I think...|`|mggll8dRaa	When is it.....??|`|zRlDQ9JJaa	When is it?
lxg0yqUQaa	Yes.I'll tell you why. Even though Tupac made a huge impact on society with his thug life movement,and even though his life and his struggle touched people globally,it still didn't pervade the way Obama has.Obama has broken steriotypes and he doesn't even understand how significant his presidency is. If you compare today,to the times of slavery or MLK's time,when blacks had little freedom it's clear that what Barack has done is way more profound than anything Tupac did. I love Tupac,but Barack has made me proud to live in a country where anything is truly possible.|`|l0dMHigQaa	i dont know what ur asking...<br>  <br>  it doesnt make any sense.<br>  <br>  barack is a motivator as well as tupac.<br>  but tupac curses way too much..|`|aBzRV8EXaa	there's a big different|`|5e60e2fdb02431cd40aeb2e01f70f701aa	WOW.!|`|1wNsBNmxaa	barack is not bigger than tupac just because he is the president that still does not make him bigger than anytone or anybody he will be around for about 4 years any way <br>  <br>  <br>  зомби~~?|`|m43bYTrlaa	hell no<br>  nobody can pass up tupac<br>  though he has had a huge and very revolutionary impact on the U.S.<br>  i believe tupac was bigger<br>  mostly because he was always true <br>  he didn't give a ****, and always spoke from the heart<br>  im not saying barack obama doesn't <br>  i just believe pac does it better

ak610Npjaa	it has to be Horatio Caine! he solves every murder while rockin his sunglasses.|`|MlCWsBcwaa	I think Mac Taylor.  He is a good boss, a good CSI and a good man who has served his country.  He would have to be the fittest of the three, and there is a lot going on with Mac, even when he is not talking.  Gary Sinese nailed Mac Taylor in episode 1 of season 1, especially the end of the episode.  That is just my opinion anyway and I guess it depends what you think cool is.  Good luck.|`|GZVqEEDraa	Horatio, he's awesome!|`|u4liwDhAaa	It would be a tie between Grissom and Caine!  They are both great bosses.|`|2tuiUiXkaa	Definitely Grissom. I got a little sick of him after awhile, but he's still the best.|`|fjNxzd6Baa	Grissom for me. He can be a little distant but he cares about and for his people deeply.|`|6064bd72a9d33a8f2e618cc79b0f9629aa	Horatio most certainly is a bad-***, but for all around awesomeness, I'd have to go with Grissom.  He was wise, funny, troubled, and when the shows delved into his love life, I didn't feel like they should never pair him with anyone (like I feel with Horatio).
EWEpkJelaa	YES!! I will miss him sooo much!<br>  <br>  I just watched the final episode today (DVR) and I almost started crying!  Then I went to the movies and the previews had a whole thing with clips of the show and I almost started crying there! Lol.  My thing is I'm from New York (live in South Carolina, but I vist a lot) and I always had it in my mind that eventually I'd go see him, but guess not now :(|`|80II1Wv1aa	Yeah, I definitely think his show will be very different. I'm going to miss the old show, but then again, I though It would never be the same when Andy Richter left the show and it turned out ok.

2UhSaxnGaa	I love 80s music and im 14!<br>  plus, i've also met Jon Bon Jovi, and there is no reason not to like him!<br>  It's great that people our age can enjoy "older music" these days. I've been going back wards in time for a little while, and i feel as though some great composers and old bands dont get the recognition they deserve. and honestly, this whole Jonas Brothers craze is just silly. If people were to look back and view works from the 80's and beyond, they'd realize the kind of crap that music has become today. <br>  <br>  don't get me wrong, i am pretty modern in music, its just artists like Hannah Montana that make me furious.<br>  <br>         don't stop listening! :)|`|WU4MHq3aaa	I'm 12 and I my favorite 4 bands are AC/DC, Led Zeppelin, The Who, and The Guess Who<br>  <br>  <br>  you tell me|`|H9Bzw0VNaa	not weird at all...

j5TOIyypaa	Well, in my chorus we have Soprano 1 (Really high notes. Im one x:), Soprano 2 (Medium notes), and Alto (Low notes). I think you would be a Soprano 2.<br>  <br>  Thanks for the thumbs down by the way o_O. She could probably pass for either Soprano 2 or Alto.|`|kAvgkLxPaa	We actually need to hear you sing scales from bottom to top to tell you what your range is. That song hasn't got much of a range at all, and they lie mostly in your middle and lower register.<br>  <br>  But based on that recording alone, you sound like a soprano or mezzo-soprano (that means between soprano and alto). Your timbre is not dark enough or heavy enough to be an alto. Most females are sopranos.|`|TJBEeXO2aa	You seem fuzzy in the lower notes. I can't really determine it unless you tell is your range like A3 to C6 or something like that.<br>  <br>  Perhaps you may be a mezzo soprano...your range does not mean you belong to that category sometimes.|`|9KQwu3oUaa	You sound like an alto to me. I was trying to sing along since I'm an alto but I don't know the song..hahah. But yeah, those notes aren't high, so probably alto or maybe 2nd soprano.|`|0icnNmNzaa	I had a cat that made a noise like you once..........I tied it to a tree and let the coyotes have it.|`|3kNeWYvdaa	Your an alto most definitely, based on what you sang|`|AQFwSLgiaa	I would most likely say 2 soprano.<br>  I sang that in choir and the notes you sang sounded 2 soprano<br>  <br>  I'm actually a mezzo-soprano but I sang with the sopranos lol but then I went to alto....I switched it up

oKyimeaMaa	yes... i was able to play trumpet a couple weeks after picking it up...i didn't even know how to read sheet music...|`|SYkzZtW7aa	Yes, certainly.

If you don't know how to read sheet music then I don't know.  I won't say it is impossible, but it certainly will be very difficult for you to comprehend even the most basic songs.  Your crash course in music needs to start like 5 minutes ago!!!  The longer you put it off, the less likely you will complete your mission.  Good luck.|`|c3BGCFdFaa	If you believe in yourself, you should be playing a simple tune or two on your first day, never mind three months. But as stated by somebody else, the tone will take a while to develop.<br>  <br>  If you're looking for a teacher (which you really should do), before you decide on which teacher to use, listen to some of the teacher's students rather than the teacher. Some people play really well, but don't know how to teach.

0ER34nnqaa	Yes and no. I can't really decide which, but to back myself up, I have prepared a speech:<br>  Chris brown is still only 19. He doesn't need jail, he needs counseling and therapy, which I believe he is working on now. It is apparent that his dad abused him when he was a child, so jail would make the situation worse. It would lead him to believe he is a criminal and he belongs in jail. And in a way, what he did was criminal, but like I said before, he needs counseling instead. Playing his music would lead him to believe that this would all blow over and everyone would forget about it and go back to normal. But not playing his music will have the same affect as getting sent to jail. I think radio stations should play his music every once and a while, but keep it minimal. It is important that he knows that not everyone despises him for doing this, but it is a serious matter that will affect his career. After all, no one wants to see America's pop princess get hurt, right? The photos of Rihanna made the sitiuation worse, because now everyone knows how bad the injuries were. I personally am very upset over all of this. I thought they were perfect for each other and I wish all of this never happened.|`|SvzsXddUaa	Well yea, but over where I live, one station still plays his music and they asked this girl what does she think about the Rihanna/Chris Brown situation and the girl said that she deserved it and it must have been a good reason for him to hit her.<br>  <br>  *sighs*<br>  <br>  Stupidity... some women need to stop defending him just because he's Chris Brown.|`|8657bab9888895b0dcc325c9f352566daa	I don't think so. Just because he did a very wrong thing, doesn't mean his music isn't changing from good to bad (or vise versa, whatever your views may be.)|`|AA12207999	I don't think they should just yet until they have all the facts.

65ae5dbf750c54c86214b6a8746d4b43aa	Oprah's Goals<br>  Throughout her life, Oprah has focused on influencing and touching people's lives. She has not let her race affect these goals. An article written after Oprah's appearance in the slavery themed movie Beloved explained Oprah's attachment to these goals. "Winfrey said making the movie reminded her of her history and her responsibility as a Black woman in a position of power and influence in the TV industry to make a difference in people's lives. She was inspired to help people take better control of their lives and destinies"(3). Oprah has held onto this goal strongly throughout her career. After she completed Beloved, Oprah commented: "And I realized that I had no right to quit coming from a history of people who had no voice, who had no power, and that I have been given this - - this blessed opportunity to speak to people, to influence them in ways that can make a difference in their lives and to use just that"(4). Oprah realizes that because she is one of the few black women to ever have had a voice in American society, she must use it. However, she does not restrict her efforts to that of her race. She has expanded more so than any other black woman in history in terms of venturing out of her race and touching people of all ethnicities. By doing so, Oprah has helped degenerate some of the strict lines between different races in America.|`|k6xdxjSmaa	1)To be white<br>  2)To be rich<br>  3)To marry a small,bespectacled,ugly white male<br>  4)To make money from gullible people e.g-housewives,the disabled.<br>  5)To sit on a white man's face.|`|b3b9eafde2a033943ecae8909779b52baa	Become the most powerful woman in the world.|`|mNjjSPdVaa	Only Oprah would know that for sure, the rest of us can only guess.<br>  One thing is for certain, her goals are ongoing and she keeps striving to fulfill all of her life's dreams.

9ee25102a7763535588f4a899e88f4dcaa	There are several contemporaries of Beethoven's worth trying.<br>  <br>  Luigi Cherubini (1760-1842)<br>  Johann Nepomuk Hummel (1778-1837)<br>  Antonín Rejcha (Anton Reicha) (1770-1836)<br>  Samuel Wesley (1766-1837)<br>  Johann Wilhelm Wilms (1772-1847)|`|CrAwmz65aa	Try Carl von Dittersdorf.<br>  Dittersdorf's music sounds like that of Beethoven because he lived at about the same time.<br>  The reason he is not as well known today is probably because he was not as innovative.<br>  <br>  PS I just gave Malcolm D a point.<br>  I didn't think about Schubert.<br>  On the whole, Schubert's music is more simple than that of Beethoven.  That  means that his music might be easier to enjoy the first time you hear it, but not as easy to enjoy the tenth time.|`|RXMHqNhsaa	In Piano music, Clementi can sound quite similar to Beethoven, but Beethoven had a characteristically dark sound palette that was unlike any of the musicians of the time. Yes, the guy above was right to consider Schubert, but for orchestral works, you might want to try Berlioz, because he was influenced greatly by the works of Beethoven, particularly his larger orchestrations.<br>  <br>  Although written much later than Beethoven's time, Brahms' first symphony is often referred to as "Beethoven's tenth symphony", as it shares tone characteristics and melodic figures with some of Beethoven's works.|`|Wi0LBsVbaa	Deli nailed the Hummel, he is closest to Beethoven in style. Schubert is another good call, though his first 5 symphonies will sound more like Mozart.<br>  The other recommendations are excellent listings of composers with Beethoven's style. They are not major figures though.<br>  I am thinking you are new to classical so you might be looking for more popular composers like Beethoven, but not so much matches for his style. So I will further suggest"<br>  Haydn's 12 last symphonies (92-104)<br>  Robert Schumann <br>  Felix Mendelssohn<br>  Brahms<br>  Weber<br>  These are major composers whose work is not far from Beethoven's language. With the above suggestions you can't go wrong.|`|kbFty6eVaa	No one is similar to Beethoven, he is a giant, but I guess you could say Schubert, Hummel, Mendelssohn (he studied almost every Beethoven score)|`|rNqF4gIVaa	Schubert is a contemporary of Beethoven. He is not however, all that similar... but then no-one really is.|`|CeMP7HMYaa	Well there wasn't really anybody similar to Beethoven.<br>  However, If you like Beethoven then you will probably like Mozart and most definitely Tchaikovsky.

hzH75VDXaa	I adore Watchmen. It's my absolute most favorite graphic novel.<br>  My favorite character is Nite Owl II. He's a bit of a geek, but I tend to like geeks.<br>  <br>  I can't wait till the movie comes out. I'm going to go see it the day it comes out. In IMAX of course.<br>  <br>  <br>  Lol, It does kind of look like the smiley face.|`|uBkvqcY6aa	Yes watchmen is a great graphic novel and I can't wait to see it.<br>  <br>  My favorite character is Rorshach/Walter Kovacs.  I identify with him far too much.<br>  <br>  No I won't explode, this has been 20 years in the making. Another week won't kill me.<br>  <br>  Who watches the Watchmen???? Apparently the Minutemen (or at least one of them) does.|`|V1hxvQukaa	yes!! <br>  this is my current desktop background:<br>  <a href="http://tinypic.com/view.php?pic=9696oi&s=5" rel="nofollow">http://tinypic.com/view.php?pic=9696oi&s...</a><br>  i made it myself =] <br>  <br>  A LOT!!<br>  rorschach... he's amazing.<br>  it is VERY possible... lol<br>  <br>  <br>  that does kinda look like the smiley...|`|WjYEIlYraa	1) a great deal<br>  2) rorschach, he's just bad@$$<br>  3) i might have a coronary standing on line to get tickets, lol
b2f5cc892d9a2ff6d43172b4bb022096aa	Yay for Soap land, where the suspected dead are rarely gone forever!<br>  Rebecca Budwig may not return to the role, since she said the commute was so difficult, but there is always the alternative for some time and space, and another actress to return, dazed and stunned as Greenlee and stir up mischief !|`|OpRi517waa	No I don't think she is but I think they should make her dead.<br>  I for one am tried of seeing her come back only to leave once more.AMC and Rebecca Budig need to make their freaking minds up already ether she stays or so goes for good.No more of this back and forth BS.|`|ce35927379e187a9a9405823379c0faaaa	No! She'll show up in a year or two. I hope with Rebecca returning in the same role. I think Greenlee will return to find everyone getting on with their love lives...unfortunately for her, Ryan will be with someone else.|`|4sRxBIF7aa	Well Zack is leaving the show so I think Kendall will end up with Ryan and then Greenlee will turn up like a bad penny and cause all heck to break loose.|`|mrzbRd9Iaa	I think we all know the answer to that.  No. She is not.|`|UY3zl9dFaa	With no body found, you know that she'll be back someday. Whenever Rebecca Budig wants to return they'll come up with some explanation for how she survived and why she hadn't come back (amnesia?).|`|NGNeT3rYaa	She is for now because Rebecca Budig needed to leave the show. Since there was no body found you can bet when she feels like coming back so will Greens!|`|GBKaftrJaa	I don't like her character so I was REALLY hoping they would find her body.  <br>  <br>  But my guess now is that, since David likes her as a friend, that he somehow found her. When they showed her in the water, her face was above water.  So she could be kept breathing. And David could easily stash her away and get her healed up from her injuries and use her in one of his plots. <br>  <br>  They did that on AMC with Marty, said she had such extensive brain injuries that she had no idea who she was and the man keeping her just didn't tell her anything about her life so that she wouldn't remember anything or have any interest in seeing anyone.|`|AA12390047	Greenlee is presumed dead which leaves the door open for the actress (Rebecca Budig) to return in the future.  It wouldn't surprise me if she's back within the year.  I think Kendall will stay with Zach, but it'll be a bumpy ride.  They can "fix" their problem if they'd stay away from Ryan and the others.|`|fjNxzd6Baa	Picture this:<br>  Greenlee with amnesia is seen in the distance by Ryan.<br>  He thinks he's going crazy.<br>  He's the only one who sees her.<br>  When he finally confronts her she believes she is someone else.<br>  <br>  Stop me if you've heard this before.|`|hFVPEkWjaa	i wish that really happens lol i wish she can come back

They're white.<br>  <br>  3rd Bass' THE CACTUS ALBUM and DERELICTS OF DIALECT albums were gold sellers on Def Jam Recordings. 2/3 of the group were white. Also separately MC Serch and Prime Minister Pete Nice (along with Daddy Rich) released albums under Def Jam. RETURN OF THE PRODUCT and DUST TO DUST.<br>  <br>  So watcha sayin'?|`|EW2HOa6Iaa	Def Jam is an Urban label that caters to R&B and Hip Hop music.<br>  Mostly Black people sing Urban music so black are they only ones signed to that label.<br>  <br>  Just like Country music labels mostly sign white artists.|`|Y0IlOTOqaa	They signed the Beastie Boys--Last time I checked Beastie Boys aint black.|`|6akfFQMmaa	If they do, that it is wrong. You can email any label and ask them if that is policy. Trust me if an act is purple, orange, or pink they will sign them if they will help the bottom line. Oh by the way it is not [DJR] policy.|`|9OksBQW4aa	No, def jam's island def jam has fallout boy and some other non-black artists. However, most of the company has black artists bacause they focus mainly on r&b and hip hop
69SHxWA9aa	Hi,<br>  <br>  This really has nothing to do with this question, but another that you asked a few weeks ago.<br>  <br>  Nightmares can be caused by having low blood sugar levels, and if there is a family history of diabetes, then anyone having nightmares should get their blood sugar level checked.  If it is low, then eating a cinnamon gram cracker or two before bedtime will keep the sugar levels high enough to avoid the nightmares again.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|4x2KMVbBaa	I guess because most men are stupid enough to let it happen.<br>  <br>  <br>  Be prejudice and it'll come back to you.|`|mnE3q7zNaa	sorry idk bout ur question but wtf to the dumb *** who gave the first answer not the one with the sis but the *** who said they should go back to the kitchen!? what the hell dude u were seriously born in the wrong wime period! get a life *** hole!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|AA12072871	Because most of these scripts are written by men.

Why should hollywood or the people that will always fork out money to see this swill.... be any different?|`|rQWlSJhCaa	I don't know about that since I can't name any movies right now that fits your scenarios. If you watched Eagle Eye, the woman playing in there was incredibly helpful in the story.|`|gE7CFNXuaa	Idk, they should just go back to the kitchen where they belong.|`|Q2xGtYvhaa	the chicks want to see some girls hairstyle. i promise you. i live with a blond sister.

cWjrtIlKaa	First you need to find and expand 'your type' of humor.( Chappelle does racial humor, Seinfeld did situational, Carrot top does prop humor.) Than you need to go out and increase your library of this comedy. <br>  <br>  Some of the best comics I know are ones that are very natural, if they get some hecklers in the crowd they know how to make a joke with it on the fly and don't crumble. This will only come with practice and confidence. <br>  <br>  If you are truly serious about this the only thing you can do is practice, and see if they have any amateur comedian nights at the night clubs and test your talent out. Good Luck!

UBdidsHYaa	No. Women deserve to be part of hip hop as any man. Now from my personal experience I haven't met many women who really deep into hip hop like me. But the few that I know who are actually into real hip hop are awesome. As a matter of fact i love meeting girls who are into hip hop. Its something I got in common with 'em. I once met a girl who told me she listened to A Tribe Called Quest and to me that is so awesome because there aren't many who into hip hop like that. So it definitely doesn't bother me at all. Tim looks stupid for actually being bothered by other women involved in the hip hop scene. We need more women to be a part of the culture.|`|PcXp05Haaa	yes,there i something about women that bother me when they enter the hip hop scene.im not against women in any way(i love them!) but i dont think they belong in hip hop.most women try to act and rap like the men do.usually women rappers or hip hop artists have dumb songs about love which brings down the art of hip hop.|`|ZjhccI73aa	I think if anything we need more woman in hip hop in general. Women can bring another aspect and empower themselves in the genre. If anything I feel that we need some more ladies for us fellas can get a better understanding of a ladies outlook on hip hop and their effect on it.|`|yZQG4Pnwaa	Nah, hip hop shouldn't have any gender lines.

PTsIhyHgaa	Actually, this is right up my alley (especially since this subject is what we went over in my rigging and animation class a few days ago). <br>  <br>  No, it is not "rigged" for Button.  Dark Knight had some great physical visuals, but Button was by FAR better.  They did not only make Pitt look older/younger.  On the younger Benjamin, when he was a small child in a wheelchair, they made a full facial CG model.  That is NOT the actors head and not a mask or makeup, it's full CG, the whole head, eyes and all.  It is insanely hard to match not only lighting and texture into a real environment, but this is human.  With a made up creature (dragon, for example) its easy to make up movements and muscles and get away with it because we have no real basis to compare it to.  But we're humans and know how humans move, thus making a CG human and making it look real and believable is difficult.  Making a FACE, something we look at all the time in great detail, consciously or not, and making a face look and move believably and making it look like its not CG in a real environment is incredibly difficult.  The people voting on the Oscar panels, know this.  Batman had great visual effects, but they were visual effects that are not new (we've had visual effects of things blowing up, cars crashing, superheros jumping off buildings, doing green screening) for years and its nothing new.  Stunning and awesome to watch, but nothing really astounding.  Making Button look real when the face for a significant portion of the movie look believable and real, not CG, is an incredible feat.  That is why it won the Oscar over Batman.|`|0e4fea790f4ea59363811798798d53a0aa	The movie is newer. And there was a lot more than just making his face look different. They actually did a whole head replacement pushing the envelope on special effects. I would have gone with Dark Knight or Iron Man. I have not seen Curious Case yet, but I read the background on it. It would have been a difficult choice for me to make.

Hawaii has been an American territory from 1893, when the US invaded the Hawaiian Monarchy and deposed of it's Queen Liliuokalani  from there on out Hawaii lost it's sovereignty and remained a US Territory up until 1959 when  it accomplished US regulations for becoming a state. Hawaii was the only state that had it's own Monarchy and it was 1 of 4 states in the US that once were its own country: Hawaii, Texas, California, and Vermont. Hawaii being the oldest of those sovereign republics.<br>  <br>  Alaska belonged to Russia from 1784 to 1958 when it was sold to the US in 1867 when the US payed Russia 7 million for it after gold was found. In 1883 it became an official US territory and in 1958 it was granted statehood.|`|kGCd8ioRaa	Hawaii|`|ZYrQXiwBaa	Hawaii<br>  <br>  no wait... it's Alaska.<br>  <br>  No!

They also command $25.000 per speaking engagement like talk shows and they also get "Love Gifts" from churches they go to speak at.<br>  <br>  That's how they paid $1,120,000  for their new home in Wernerville PA, and also for their new Condo in Park City Utah Home of the Sundance Film Festival. <br>  <br>  They also get tons of freebies which saved them a lot of money and they also get to write off much of their expenses such as Home, Cars,Furniture,clothes, food for themselves & crew as they use their home as the setting of the TV series. <br>  <br>  The majority of my friends wont let their children watch the show anymore because of how Kate treats her husband as they don't want their children to think belittling and bad mouthing ones husband and father is normal behavior.<br>  <br>  There is enough information about them on the web that its not that hard to find out  how much they earn etc.|`|uDsXjzwjaa	I doubt anyone really knows the answer to your question...even if they say they do.

If he wanted 100% immunity to telepathic intrusion, he could do it. Then Shadow King wouldn't be able to touch him.
AA11464625	First off I loved this movie and unlike many, many others on this answers web site I thought Phillip Hoffman should have gotten the best supporting Oscar. Anyone who can stand toe to toe with Merl Strep, deserves an Oscar. Anyway I thought the same thing about the movie the way you did and your question has shed a different light on the ending for me. So to answer your question, I must say that I am not sure.

2X2wjYb4aa	As a bass player for 29 years, I've noticed that bass players tend to get more respect now than before. Of course, when the bass player is the last guy in the album credits, buried in the mix, partially obscured in band photos, and almost never mentioned in any press about a band, "more respect" becomes a relative term!<br>  With the advent of better gear, and publications like Bass Player magazine (hey, I subscribed to it for 10 years) to help us improve our playing & get the most out of our talent, in many cases the bass is no longer seen as a second-class instrument played by either a third-rate musician or a frustrated guitarist. There's still more work to do and more perceptions to change, though.<br>  I generally agree that Flea's overrated, but he can still burn as a fingerstyle player. For pure bass artistry, I prefer to listen to players like Vic Wooten, Tony Levin (an unsung bass hero to be sure), Steve Swallow, and Marcus Miller. But I also enjoy rock players who refuse to let the bass take a back seat to anybody else (e.g. Steve Harris, Geddy Lee)|`|A3axVsjuaa	Well the thing about Flea is that he's good AND has a lot of show-manship. Also the same with System of a Down's bassist.  But you have to admit they have a pretty easy job.  Important none the less, other wise bands would just exclude them from their line up.  The only exception I can think of is the white stripes, but they have a 7 string guitar.  I like a lot of bass parts though, and it always sounds cool. Their job is to back up the lead guitar, and they do that well most of the time.|`|yRE2HDr3aa	Bass Players are underrated. It's generally more overlooked in the rock genre but I love Jazz/Funk/Experimental stuff.<br>  <br>  This guy is great.<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwcPon5FzPg" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwcPon5Fz...</a>|`|pbC9gnsJaa	I agree 100%!!!!!!!! I'm a bass player myself, and personally, I like the guy from Rancid. Not sure of his name right at the moment, but he's for sure one of my fav's.|`|AM33tqYAaa	if you didn't post an ad looking for a bass player, then why not recognize him?<br>  <br>  they treat the bassists like outcasts|`|n6nwpanAaa	One answer,<br>  Entwistle.  One talented enough can defy logic and this case go beyond the realm of only playing "bass" on a bass.|`|WHcBV7rLaa	I literally facepalmed when I saw this question, haha.<br>  <br>  I do feel like bass players don't get enough credit, but to try and make up for that, I give them the credit they deserve, although I'm a guitar player but I'm recently learning to play some bass too, and its super fun. It takes real talent to play bass well. Slapping is cool, I hope I can learn to slap soon, but IDK. I'm pretty shitty at finger picking right now.<br>  <br>  I love bass players, they're usually super nice and talented. And may I add that a fair few of them are pretty hot.|`|kILkOc6saa	Well, being a bassist myself, I love it and I love them.<br>  <br>  I do feel they deserve credit, as they lay down the foundation beat of the song.<br>  In some cases(Primus, Metallica, RHCP) they do get a lot of credit, in others, they get none.<br>  <br>  Check out this dude:<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=veLGBk1mE5U" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=veLGBk1mE...</a><br>  <br>  YEAH Americanguitarist848! you know what I'm talkin about!<br>  <br>  Flea is way overrated. He's good, but, liek you said, def. not one of the best.<br>  <br>  Wooten, as the guy below me mentioned, is absolutely amazing.|`|rXlyHk1Raa	Yeah, bass players don't get enough respect. Geezer Butler from Black Sabbath is hardly ever mentioned, but he is so awesome. Listen to the bass on Iron Man and Children of the Grave|`|rRCTvT7Saa	In some cases, bassists shouldn't get much credit...but that's just for the guys who don't do more than basically just a continuous G note.<br>  <br>  In other cases, bassists don't get nearly enough credit...one great example of this:  Billy Sheehan who is basically the Eddie Van Halen of bass.  Sheehan not only does tapping and pinch harmonics on bass, but he also knows how to fulfill the traditional role of a good bassist.<br>  <br>  Also check out Victor Wooten, if you haven't already!|`|07bX5jGsaa	Yeha, they don't from somebody who doesn't really know anything about music. But somebody who knows their music knows, and their really all that matters when it somes to saying whos important in a band and who isn't. Even though everybody usually is.<br>  <br>  Haha, slapping is when you slap the string with your thumb and play the other hand normally. It's nothing like tapping, but you have an idea.|`|ebxwADDcaa	i dont think flea is very good. <br>  <br>  if you want a band that gives the bass more credit, listen to Tool. the bass almost acta like the guitar part in some songs, like th backbone of the song, and the guitar is just a lead part.|`|DbtS5jzEaa	Ye man I agree..<br>  <br>  Like up until now I never cared for the Bassist in Underoath...but I saw him live yesterday and man is he epic...he is so energetic and he moves all around the fret board
Nuj1eScCaa	I guess it looks a bit strange if they are shaking hands for more than a few seconds.<br>  <br>  EDIT: I've never really seen anyone just stand there shaking both of their hands. That would be strange, like some panick attack or something.|`|ouEix2a2aa	Most of the time when I shake someones hand, they don't look at me funny. I just smile real big and give a big old handshake, and they usually do the same back, unless they have an injured arm, and I just shook that injured arm. There have been a few times, that they have looked at me funny, and that is when I shake, smile real big, and grab a hold of him, and don't let go. I use my other hand to grab his wrist to hang on to him. I just want to hold him a little closer, just pull him to me so I can see his eye up close and see if he has freckles on his nose, or how close he shaves, amd breathe in his scent. Sometimes that gets a crazy look, before I realize what I am doing. Especially if that man is a preacher or reverand, etc. <br>  <br>  No, seriously, shaking hands is very acceptable around here. We do it all the time when we meet. I really try not to do it too much during the cold and flu season, so they may look at me funny when I don't shake hands. It is difficult to get out of sometimes, so I just tell them the truth, my immune system is down. Now why would you ask a quwseion like that? Did someone look at you funny?|`|A40jdi5Naa	agreed....|`|5NsgLFPRaa	?<br>  I think it's normal and polite?|`|mzkfSwLwaa	Nope.|`|nooi0ldjaa	that's what your suppose to do man.<br>  <br>  edit: who the hell shakes their own hands? o.O<br>  never seen that before.|`|LYeAQKW8aa	no...?|`|uff3kOoFaa	nope|`|ekpg6v1Kaa	I wouldn't think so because shaking hands is a polite way of showing your gratitude towards others weather its formal or informal.  and it feels great for everyone to do so.|`|ACCIArkDaa	No, never get looked at funny for shaking hands, but shaking my butt gets the funny looks|`|hmSb745iaa	GET THE ICY HOT OFF THE HANDS !<br>  FEEL THE BURN !!!<br>  FEEEEEEEELLLL THE BUUUUUUUURRRRRRNNNNNN !|`|hu8o4vomaa	no|`|Yof1kN1Raa	no not usually|`|RL0sef3Saa	its pretty normal,polite and decent......whats d problem???|`|1RzQ3lK8aa	They always ask me whats all that goo...!?!?!<br>  I took lame and made it funny.|`|hThb2d6Kaa	not really.....|`|bGWwGPC6aa	no, i think its nice,|`|D9IbINdFaa	nope|`|goM4NtsEaa	errr... no<br>  dude what a lame question|`|mggll8dRaa	It's an "Old School" show of Respect.....!!|`|YW1DXceqaa	.....ehh....sorry dude kinda lame|`|a1566efb5533aa90596e330bc315a547aa	I hate it when I always give a firm handshake and others don't.

Try looking up the root word, "incongruent" for the answer.  <br>  <br>  If you look up the root word, the definition is, "not congruent."  (Which makes sense - the prefix "in" means "not" in English.)  So then you can look up congruent, which will also give you a definition for congruence, which is the clearest definition for the word.|`|692c8795f68a0ba95a0d09139d70c98caa	lol, ya i agree i hate when i look up something and dont understand what the hell its talking about... however the question should be phrased<br>  <br>  Don't you hate it when the dictionary makes me feel stupid?|`|I4bALymyaa	Look up incongruous then. =)|`|pmiKJGJmaa	LOL! dang! i hate that too... you just have to look up incongruous and hope that it gives u a def... but thats why i just use the internet cuz the dictionary just makes me mad!|`|e97037e29bf6dd323c13e9097d4a5669aa	i hate that so much!<br>  <br>  answer mine?<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AoVBkWoEP.CZU4pw9YRuS0nsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090222202418AAWwqXn">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|tZlfF4ooaa	lol, I know exactly what you mean.

fW5N3IO9aa	this is from imdb.com  looks interesting i have not seen it myself but other people i know say its good. I know it takes place in Germany post WWII.<br>  <br>  Middle aged German barrister Michael Berg recollects to himself his lifelong acquaintance with Hanna Schmitz, a relationship with whom he never disclosed to anyone close to him. Michael first met Hanna in 1958, when he was fifteen, she thirty-six. The two had a turbulent summer long love affair, dictated by Hanna that their encounters would begin with him reading to her followed by lovemaking. Michael next encountered Hanna in 1966, when Michael, now a law student, attended the Nazi war crimes trial of five female former S.S. concentration camp guards, one of whom is Hanna. Through listening to the testimony, Michael comes to the realization that he is in possession of information which could save Hanna from a life in prison, information which she herself is unwilling to disclose. In deciding what to do, Michael is torn between his differing views of justice

VLRkJOOuaa	Have I ever told you, Chu... you say whatever too much.<br>  <br>  <br>  Now... I've probably told you this a billion times before (I hope so, at least), but Claymore is an amazing series. And sure... there's some angry people. :|<br>  <br>  Ok.. so anger isn't really the correct term here. But Tupac wasn't really an angry person. He was just a misunderstood person that lived a tough, unfair life. Bitterness, if anything, better explains his personality.<br>  <br>  Back to anime... Claymore! Must watch! It's not really THAT emo... it's interesting.<br>  <br>  Next on the list of recommendations... Kino's Journey (Kino no Tabi). Greaaaat series!! This series is barely anger-centered; the great part of this anime is that passive feeling you get. There's regret, passion, apathy, sympathy, madness, and insanity. Everything good, pretty much!<br>  <br>  Just watch it.

They are from Titanic!<br>  <br>  Jack: Rose, you're no picnic, all right? You're a spoiled little brat, even, but under that, you're the most amazingly, astounding, wonderful girl, woman that I've ever known... <br>  Rose: Jack, I...<br>  Jack: No, let me try and get this out. You're ama- I'm not an idiot, I know how the world works. I've got ten bucks in my pocket, I have no-nothing to offer you and I know that. I understand. But I'm too involved now. You jump, I jump remember? I can't turn away without knowing you'll be all right... That's all I want. <br>  Rose: Well, I'm fine... I'll be fine... really. <br>  Jack: Really? I don't think so. They've got you trapped, Rose. And you're gonna die if you don't break free. Maybe not right away because you're strong but... sooner or later that fire that I love about you, Rose... that fire's gonna burn out... <br>  <br>  <br>  Lewis Bodine: We never found anything on Jack... there's no record of him at all. <br>  Old Rose: No, there wouldn't be, would there? And I've never spoken of him until now... Not to anyone... Not even your grandfather... A woman's heart is a deep ocean of secrets. But now you know there was a man named Jack Dawson and that he saved me... in every way that a person can be saved. I don't even have a picture of him. He exists now... only in my memory. <br>  <br>  Rose: I love you, Jack. <br>  Jack: Don't you do that, don't say your good-byes. <br>  Rose: I'm so cold. <br>  Jack: Listen, Rose. You're gonna get out of here, you're gonna go on and make lots of babies, and you're gonna watch them grow. You're gonna die an old... an old lady warm in her bed, but not here, not this night. Not like this, do you understand me? <br>  Rose: I can't feel my body. <br>  Jack: Winning that ticket, Rose, was the best thing that ever happened to me... it brought me to you. And I'm thankful for that, Rose. I'm thankful. You must do me this honor, Rose. Promise me you'll survive. That you won't give up, no matter what happens, no matter how hopeless. Promise me now, Rose, and never let go of that promise. <br>  Rose: I promise. <br>  Jack: Never let go. <br>  Rose: I'll never let go. I'll never let go, Jack.<br>  <br>  Old Rose: It's been 84 years, and I can still smell the fresh paint. The china had never been used. The sheets had never been slept in. Titanic was called the Ship of Dreams, and it was. It really was. <br>  <br>  <br>  Rose: Hello Jack. I changed my mind. They said you might be out here. <br>  Jack: Shhh. Gimme your hand. Now close your eyes, go on. Now step up. Now hold on to the railing. Keep your eyes closed, don't peek. <br>  Rose: I'm not. <br>  Jack: Step up on the railing. Hold on, hold on. Keep your eyes closed. Do you trust me? <br>  Rose: I trust you. <br>  [Jack opens Rose's arms] <br>  Jack: All right. Open your eyes. <br>  Rose: [gasp] I'm flying, Jack! <br>  [Jack starts singing] <br>  Jack: Come, Josephine, in my flying machine, going up, she goes up, up she goes. <br>  [they kiss] <br>  <br>  <br>  [Talking about Caledon Hockley] <br>  Old Rose: That was the last time I ever saw him.

80II1Wv1aa	they've already rerun the first three eps this season
dnoJPmG7aa	He had his stint as a sex symbol in the 80's/90's with a couple of films 9 1/2 Weeks with Kim Bessinger then Wild Orchid with Carrie Ottis. He also did a memorable film called Pope of Greenwich Village with Eric Roberts & Darryl Hannah...then for years he did not do alot except for small roles. The Wrestler was his come back film. Below is a link...for more info<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mickey_Rourke" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mickey_Rour...</a>|`|AA10175631	Well, back in the day he was on the fast track to being leading man material. He was even considered to be a sex-symbol. But he decided to leave acting and focus on being a boxer. Unfortunately, things didn't work so well as a professional boxer. He lost a large number of fights and also caused damage to his face. He tried to get his face corrected with plastic surgery, but as you've probably seen on the web, it left him looking even worse. He returned to acting, but as you can imagine, having a jacked up face can make finding a job in Hollywood pretty difficult. Thankfully though, he's refocused his career as a character actor and eventually proved that he can carry a film with The Wrestler.|`|dPULl5hjaa	Goggle him and find out.<br>  <br>  First of all:  Tons and tons of plastic surgery on his face!|`|4x2KMVbBaa	Back in the day Mickey was hot. I loved him in Wild Orchid with Carre Otis (yes, it's spelled Carre) and also in 9 1/2 weeks with Kim Basinger. He had a wild relationship in real life with Carre Otis and was accused of physically abusing her. He used to dabble in fighting as well, therefore, his face took some hits, he got some plastic surgery and that's why he looks so weird in the face today. He used to stutter so bad when he was younger he could barely talk. He was good in a smaller film called Domino too with Keira Knightly a few years ago, but nothing much else gave him recognition until The Wrestler film came out. He's always been a good actor, he's just had some trouble, been slightly abusive in his relationship with Otis and has had some surgery.

She is a very striking woman. She is very smart and she has a really wide range of facial expressions. It means that she is not an expert at "faking it".

e84edc9acb02bb655cb07cfc994911adaa	Everyone is so PC.  I personally don't understand it.  You're correct that the culture of the black community in America had it's start in slavery.  How they dealt with it, rising up from it...that combined with the culture they knew in Africa plays into the music, food, even sometimes their way of speaking and some of how they act.  It's a fact.  Just like ALL Americans are effected by their heritage.  Stop avoiding it, people!  There's no point.<br>  <br>  Also, since I know there are going to be some jerks out there sayin i'm racist...a lot of my close friends and my fiance and of course his family and friends whom I love, are all black.  <br>  <br>  The question is a very valid question and should not have been deleted.|`|YPhxypx7aa	i wouldnt say intellectual, but i would say its an honest question|`|OMOaUbFLaa	Hey stop stereotyping white people by saying we are scared, I am not scared say what you wish,|`|bdaeBAYUaa	Someone probably freaked out because they might have thought it was racist or something like that.

Why are you posting that?Are you trying to start a fight?!<br>  <br>  Why do you ASSUME whites are scared? Scared of what? Blacks are so narrow minded and they feel like they are owed something.

Take responsibility for yourself and quit blaming the past for your future.|`|tqD9xUpYaa	I don't know what category she put the question in - so maybe that was the objection.  Otherwise, I have no problem with the question and actually find it well thought out.|`|qGBVcV3naa	hahaha why should this question be deleted?<br>  <br>  i think white people are scared to talk about it cuhs they're afraid that black people will take revenge on them.<br>  and also plot things on yahoo answers or something, you know?|`|NJtjJA8Baa	This question has been deleted<br>  <br>  There was an error performing that action, please try again later.|`|yudfOAQQaa	Yeah it deserve to be deleted.|`|MXMMlSJPaa	no offensement. but i think the white people who will report this question.|`|0wf8Q1Raaa	yeaa.|`|AefLaOPeaa	no
qXxSBBRFaa	Yeah.

rKQ9l81kaa	If your voice is straining but you have good range, sing from your diaphram and everything else is good, than your just going OUT of your range, if your straining your vocal chords you need to stop hitting those high notes because you could damage your vocal chords and just make it worse, continue with the exercises that you already do and get advice on a vocal coach on any possible ways you could maybe train your vocal chords to reach those certain notes.

(Like techno music now and computerized instruments, computerized voices [T-pain-like]) That will keep things fresh and different!|`|AA11311516	no, each generation hears music and things of new creative ways to change it. you can expect much more electronic sounding music I think.|`|a7f3d8bf66bfd9fc1daac1814d6e6577aa	it already did,   back in 1969<br>  but realize that the keys on a piano are black and white<br>  but sound like a million colours in you mind. <br>  katie Mela sang that|`|By1DJAUOaa	I REALLY HOPE NOT!!!<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AuDyq1yu4pG39kQ7VwbBp1sazKIX;_ylv=3?qid=20090222170453AAKl6qW">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|TANToYsnaa	dont worry about it<br>  music can never end cuz artist keep stealing each other ideas and making it there own,<br>  <br>  theres alot of things to sing about<br>  or rap about,all u need is an imagination|`|tAsDynGEaa	it already did|`|ZZ12Gssiaa	Well,there is no such thing as running out of song lyric ideas, beats, and more. Musicians can remake their own version of other songs. For instance, Fall Out Boy remade Michael Jackson's  Beat It.Rhianna also used O-Zone's song(the Numa Numa song) and inserted words into it to make it her own. There are more than a million combinations of music and so many types of styles and beats musicians have not used or composed yet, so to answer your question,nope.|`|49DG60cFaa	Nah once the good music is gone. Random Songs about Random things will be made. Or the 70s music will be in style again and then the 80s and so on.:-)|`|l7rn9zE9aa	Music has always been the same, just different timings and beats.|`|oHsxp5weaa	Eventually.|`|vP8RQ9lWaa	never|`|T2KSjtkwaa	rap will..its all about the same thing lol
44c352a49807fd606b77f2a102ce7a23aa	Well she's got BLOOD flowing through her veins, right?<br>  <br>  The abnormal thing would be not caring, the normal thing is wanting to be recognized for your work and feeling happy when you are.<br>  <br>  Kate's an extraordinary actress who clearly felt thrilled beyond measure for the honor of receiving an Academy Award, it's the highest honor for an actor, so if she does "care too much" (whatever that means) is perfectly normal. <br>  <br>  I'm super happy for her, it was time already. I'm also happy for Sean Penn, amazing actor.|`|EC2TSFj3aa	I'm glad Kate won. She deserves it. She is very talented.|`|I7mBG3Dnaa	No, it is the highest honor for actresses. It is a big deal. Whats your problem?|`|7lnyNHgYaa	Wouldn't you be happy, too?|`|PKMJFq9Baa	I don't think so...

jDxlLbBzaa	Personally, no I don't think Slumdog deserves all of its Oscars. I feel it is winning many of them because it simply is the "fairy tale" of the awards, the little indie film that could, so to speak. Not that it's bad movie or anything, but some categories are just a stretch. I mean, Sound Mixing? Are you serious? Over Wall-E and Dark Knight? Really?<br>  <br>  Too many awards for the heartwarming story of the film's success rather than on the technical merits that the awards should be representing.|`|tqIaTWkHaa	i think it was an excellent movie, but i dont understand why it won the music....|`|4VWoIOIwaa	Ummmm, it won like 7 or 8 now<br>  and they totally diserved it!!<br>  like WTF<br>  The music was soo good<br>  so STFU|`|EC2TSFj3aa	No. It's totally overrated.

I hadn't considered the drive across town. <br>  <br>  At one traffic light, the stares of the people in the car beside me became obvious, and I looked across and explained, "I'm delivering him to my doctor's office."<br>  <br>  The other driver leaned out of his window. <br>  <br>  "I hate to tell you," he said, "but I think it's too late!"|`|2k8TEiRtaa	He didn't mean Barrack Sam Obama, the Presidents twin brother.

WyxxDgSeaa	No, I thought Aniston did fine and looked fine too. Angelitter had her usual smug, arrogant face on and Brad looked like a porn star trying to imitate Clark Gable. It all looked normal to me!  Angelitter probably was the pissed one when she and Brad went home with exactly nothing...and after having to use their 20 nannies and Israeli commandos to watch the kiddies too. Ahhh. LOL|`|QziBNh0Uaa	I am 100% team Aniston. Jolie is a man-stealing who*re. This isn't the first time either. Billy Bob Thorton was engaged when she snagged him and married him. Karma is going to bite her in the a** big time!|`|aRRzLrAmaa	I didn't really notice that, but I do think there was some tension, probably due to the poor material she was given to work with and the person she had to work with. <br>  <br>  I do think though it was Angelina who looked pissed all night, at least in all of the pre-show footage and photos. She looks like a b*tch in most of the pictures, and when Tim Gunn was trying to talk to her and Brad in the pre-show, she was very snobbish. (And this comes from someone who truly likes Angelina.)|`|hd442Ha5aa	It was the first time since Brad left her for Angelina that she was in their presence. Considering that, she did an almost great job of composing herself. None of us could hold a straight face and natural flaunt when they see the woman who stole their husband. Hopefully if more events like that group them together, Jen will finally heal and be the fun person she is.|`|dmxHQ0kTaa	Are you serious? I missed that part.  Angelina isaskank .  Ya I just asked about Jon Mayer showed up with Jen .  At HIS music festivities he didnt want her with him cause he said it took attention away from his music talent.   Your right though now that you mention it.  She did look a little ticked.|`|lbThMxj7aa	Jen just didn't look happy.  I felt really bad for her.   I was hoping she would really shine.  I don't know if I like the way she was wearing her hair.
msUIsv8maa	Sharon has loved Nick most of her Life they were High Schol Sweethearts then they married and had children i knw what you mean people act like Sharon is the trash of the town but she she still Loves Nicks as a woman loves her Husband thats why she cant have a relationship with n other man [But at least shes Honest about her feelings found nick ]Nick shouldnt have slept with her that gave her the idea he still loved her too only to turn around And stay with that Slut Phyllis. so  if any one has every been in Sharons position theyde know how she feels and as Dirty as Jack is i respect him for being a friend to her and not being Judgemental.Phyllis is far more worse that Sharon  shes cruel and Heartless.|`|XRPtuwoTaa	Nick does deserve the blame too & it always seems that it's the woman's fault. <br>  <br>   Wouldn't it be funny if Sharon was pregnant & didn't know if it were Nick or Billy's baby?|`|939a573d51518cee62321893077ea36baa	yeah I dont know whats up with that but lets not forgot besides his supposed cheating with grace she also kissed her father in law when she was married to nick|`|6tqGKoREaa	Who cares, Sharon is hot and they need more scenes of her waking up hung over only in her bra and panties.|`|AA11626328	I know, and Nick won't leave Sharon alone.|`|Jy9KORHDaa	I think Nick is the one with issues, and in due time I'm sure Phyllis will chase him off. They are both to blame for cheating, but I don't think Sharon would have slept with Nick if she knew he was going back to Phyllis? At some point they are going to have to both admit they still love each other, and Nick really doesn't want Sharon to move on, I don't think.|`|AA11952412	It is being said that Sharon could have said 'no' to  Nick, but she allowed herself to yet again sleep with a married man - first Brad and now Nick.  I don't think Nick is right to go yet again outside his vows, but I do think Sharon put the fruit too close to the guy.|`|EPPb5pRBaa	I agree, both should be at blame.|`|ahOBiGSzaa	Probably cuz Nick is too cute to blame.
5f0111f71db8592710a5d1cb4897be4aaa	Cane walked into Genoa City as a hot Aussie bartender and just because he ''thinks'' he's a Chancellor deserves the huge title as CEO.  <br>   I feel he deserves crap ( Lily ) and Crazy Chloe is too good for him !<br>   I loved Cane when he first came on the show but learned to despise him after he treated Amber like a piece of dirt after he found out their marriage was a scam > sure she was after the money of the Chancellor's but he's no different ! Do you think he really would have stayed in town IF he wasn't a ''Chancellor'' and say...... maybe a Baldwin or  a family who wasn't worth millions???<br>   I still believe hes a con and needs to be exposed !<br>  <br>   It's sickening....he so far uP Little Lily's A$$ he stinks of her !|`|6tqGKoREaa	Guess you are new to soaps.  Soap time is much faster than regular time.  Cane has years of experience just like the kid ages 10 years when they leave for boarding school/live with mom/going to summer camp etc.|`|30r4coInaa	He's got some Jill DNA in him, so that could have something to do with his feelings of entitlement.|`|AA11626328	You would think Cane would want to work In<br>  his Father's Company Chancellor INC.|`|EPPb5pRBaa	I agree, i still think Cane is a fake like Jill.|`|AA11952412	Good question and I have been wondering the same thing.  I think that with Cane being the long-lost son that Katherine stole and had adopted out that both she and Jill think they owe Cane the lifestyle he would have had if the past had not happened.|`|XRPtuwoTaa	Really!  I like Cane, but he's showing that he's Jill's son w/ his arrogance about being CEO
7fXpLlhBaa	I saw it and it's actually an amazing film! Have you seen it? If no, you have no room to talk- i'm sorry. Just basing the quality of a film on whether or not a lot of people have seen it or the amount of theaters it's been released in is not a good enough reason. And it's almost made $100,000,000 at the box office so obviously a lot of people have seen it. I really believe this film deserves all the oscars it can get. It's a great story about true perseverance, opens up issues in India, and is about true love. <br>  <br>  I have seen The Curious Case of Benjamin Button and I loved it to death. Really, that's a great movie as well- and if it weren't for Slumdog, Ben Button would be taking the gold.|`|9f68a1f4952a6fb1e0cfb91da91a5105aa	It is a feel good film-a film of hope--also the Oscars are getting more international, so a small film will gather many world awards..I dont think its right, but it happens|`|1NCPPHR9aa	It was playing at Century 12 last week.<br>  And it's not the public voting anyway.<br>  The films are sent to selected people who get the honor of voting.|`|AeJbSuNNaa	My. Thoughts. Exactly.|`|yeYL8Udoaa	i havnt even seen that movie...|`|BZwJeuMGaa	i knowwww! ive never even heard of that movie until today?|`|cAauS5aqaa	They win because they are good films. Period. I would go into the technical stuff but you seem like you don't have that great of an attention span, and I frankly, don't feel like explaining it. But it's a good film-that-could story with Slumdog, and maybe if you, I dunno, maybe SAW the movie you would know how different and good it was as opposed to a conventional commercial film. Seriously, I just watched it take home five awards and it might take home maybe three more. Best Picture is one and maybe best director. But I'm not mad dude, so don't take it personally. I just think you don't know what you're talking about. Period.|`|d4c9a4d52a9e77de4545721ac937c02faa	Well the only movie I've seen out of all the nominations is The Dark Knight, so of course I want that one to win. I understand a few awards for slumdog millionare but its getting like everyone, I don't think that's fair.|`|clqgFUFFaa	I hate that about the academy, always the unpopular films win it all|`|YTLePvkVaa	Are you jealous that an Indian film is dominating the US film industry?|`|AA10300538	idk...but my roomie has watched it and says its really good.|`|8zJy3jeOaa	It  seemed really good. And we havent all seen it so we cant be to quick to judge sweetie.|`|dMeVhu0iaa	I think they felt sorry for some of the cast.|`|U5ZOkDj6aa	cause it was good|`|PbKYvhrLaa	i read n heard lot of compliments n criticism about SDM. i cn recall few good things about it.. personally i feel it is a good movie to watch.<br>  I happened to see Slum Dog Millionaire before its official released to theaters and can certainly say that it is one of the better movies. This one is truly fantastic and doesn't shy away from tough subjects that children and citizens of Mumbai (Bombay) are subjected to.<br>  What's clever about the film is that the structure shows you how he knows the answers.<br>  A true eye opener - the movie is very real and portrays the spirit of every slum child of finding hope and release from the bondage of poverty.<br>  In short, Slum Dog has the right elements, and uses them to its advantage. It is fast, visual, contemplative and humorous.<br>  <br>  Every one associated with this movie, is equally deserves the award and not every makes it to Oscar. very well done|`|xbdrWhcZaa	because not as many people watched slumdog, it does not subtract from the movies quality overall.<br>  <br>  the movie wasn't even supposed to be released in a lot of movie theaters in the U.S., it was to be a small movie, but since the outcome of the film was so great, they released it in more theaters here than originally planned.<br>  <br>  i think that says enough to prove how good a movie slumdog is.<br>  <br>  just because this movie doesn't star an all-star american cast, it doesn't mean that it wasn't great, it actually kind of adds to what makes the movie good.|`|IjKndeVvaa	Because Slum Dog was an amazing movie, but I agree that it wasn't the best.<br>  <br>  I couldn't believe Benjamin Button won visual effects over The Dark Knight. Now, that was an anomaly. <br>  <br>  And Doubt should've been a nominee for Best Motion Picture. <br>  But I guess the experts are better at determining that.<br>  <br>  I honestly hope The Reader wins best picture. It was such a great movie. The only movie I haven't seen from the list of nominees was Frost/NIxon, but I don't think it stands a chance. The Reader was amazing. If you haven't seen it, you should. I think the fact that the first forty-five minutes was basically a soft porn is going to hurt its chances though.|`|bwcLzqQXaa	In reply to Dylan, benjamin button won best special effects due to the fact the first 52 minutes of the film the Brad Pitt character is all CGI and was not even noticeable by many viewers, it is noticed to be possibly the most ground breaking character animation, texturing, lighting and composite feat in film to date. Although Dark Knight does kick ***|`|74cd5679d2ee27013c7ff3274a324f67aa	because it was really good movie, and had an interesting way about how it was filmed. it also opens spoiled americans minds to things like ACTUAL poverty, not "poverty" as in, "awhh,i cant geta mac-book air? were so poor!" it shows that even though we live in glamour [for the most part,] there are still actual slums and betrayal.|`|5Zti94pOaa	yes i agree with you its not on is it.but what gets me is heath ledger got one an he died a few months back now i know its nice of then to give him a Oscar but i think it should of gone to a person who is still alive...|`|SZPZ40QAaa	Lol! Good question, I have always wondered the same thing. Like how in 1990 Dances With Wolves won 7 Oscars. It was decent but nothing special I don't know how critics decide what is worthy to be honest with you. BTW does anyone have a Cigarette?|`|crBmcntyaa	how did a turd movie like american beauty beat hurricane? then only to give denzel a token the following year for training day...........<br>  <br>  <br>  its a joke and picked by fortune cookies i swear|`|wqQf6IKqaa	CUSS THE PEOPLE WHO JUDGE IT  ARE STUPID!!!!!!!!!!!!!! SOME PEOPLE LIKE HEATH LEDGER TRULY DESERVED IT BUT SLUM DOG WASN'T EVEN AT THE BOX OFFICE!!!!!!!!!|`|aYZXi6ffaa	ive never even heard of this movie until it started being nominated and all that garbage.  I havent seen it and dont plan on seeing it either.|`|BL4OBp0eaa	idk.. a lot of people that i know saw it including myself. it was big in philly thats where i live and everyone was talking about it|`|Kp49Mf4iaa	I don't know...

5f0111f71db8592710a5d1cb4897be4aaa	I think Lily doesn't know what boundary's are ! For someone who claims to hate someone ( Chloe ) she has stuck her nosy self into the whole situation > there was NO reason to stay at the hospital like she did ! She's just as much as a pain as her mother was ( always in others business ) <br>   Maybe she just stayed so she could pick up Cane when Chloe gave him the devastating news about the baby <br>  <br>   (( Cane will propose to Lily this week )) they so deserve each other<br>  <br>   I think your right about the two daddy's too !!! Good Thought !|`|VAp5ICaBaa	Yes I found this to be very strange I would not stay there for one minute longer than I had to if I was Lily|`|uKXgg9heaa	Yes that was crazy. Even after Billy left she was still there,I was like "Go home Lilly!"|`|fcPiQDwEaa	I think the writers have something to do with that!|`|ce35927379e187a9a9405823379c0faaaa	Lily thinks she's there for Cane. She was being so insensitive when she was trying to urge Billy into telling Cane the truth about the baby. Now that That's been done, she can probably go home, but will she? She'll be there as long as she feels she has a claim on Cane. The fact that Lily's so picky would make Cane and Lily a very volatile couple.|`|Jy9KORHDaa	I agree, and if she loves Cane so much it should be painful to watch Cane with the baby and Chloe? I think she should have left as soon as Chloe and the baby were admitted because her part was done, but I guess in her twisted way she thinks she is there for Cane?|`|e99ea32489fc5dbc539f321016b1f8f7aa	She wanted to be there to console Cane- she expected him to be crushed about the baby not being his. HOWEVER, know when to quietly bow out already! Standing off to the side looks just plain weird!|`|9FCxm8qJaa	She's hanging around the hospital like a vulture waiting for Cane to go back with her.  I think it's pretty sad, she's out of place there, imo.|`|EPPb5pRBaa	I agree, I know she loves Cane, but she should just go.|`|a1Ngi39Xaa	And today she came in by herself just to check on Chloe and the baby.  Right!   I don't believe my own lies.<br>  <br>  She totally should not have stayed at the hospital as long as she did.  That was a place for the family.<br>  <br>  I think Lily needs to get a life.

8r46d89Vaa	Yeah!  I have a lot of Gemini friends (my ex is a Gemini) and Cancer girls would chase him and most of my male Gem friends more than any other sign.  <br>  <br>  It was like the minute the Cancer girl met the Gemini she was head over heels--which she would proceed to tell them too (which was the beginning of the end-lol).  <br>  <br>  The Gemini guys were always curious about all of that emotion and wondering if it were real.<br>  <br>  There is definitely a draw there----one is completely logical and the other is completely emotional and they both sit there like --heh? LOL!<br>  <br>  But after awhile that gets old and logical people want to talk and be understood by other logical (or similar in thought) people and the emotional person wants their feelings understood and the emotional security that other emotional (or similar in emotions) people give.<br>  <br>  Unless there are other complimentary aspects in their charts then these two will not last.<br>  <br>  Edit: Hey you have a Taurus Moon and your Venus and Mars is in Cancer---->that would be the "other complimentary aspects" that I referenced above :-P hehehe!!  A fire sign or Air sign could get "drawn in" by your Aquarius Ascendant and Gemini Sun but deep down you are more Earth and Fire.  Big draw for you I'd think|`|IaIBNChpaa	yess!<br>  <br>  hi there :). i am a cancer and i am extemly attracted to geminis, however i thought 'who isn't' cos sometimes they are very attractive, however, many of them have been attracted to me. this is because they both share an every changing eccentiricity. they can be odd, changable and misunderstood. Both can be very charming aswell. my boyfriend of six months is a gemini and we are best friends, he loves my affection and he can be very needy and clingy, both are loyal, and changing and inconsisten which can be a problem. but i always find geminis alluring. :) deffintily somethign there!<br>  <br>  i am a cancer sun, mercury.<br>  he is a gemini sun, mercury and rising.<br>  <br>  our moons are imcompatible to. mine scorpio his aries.|`|ETGMj8Hoaa	LOL kristy is the best example of cancer ;), i mean some cancers are like close minded and just go and reject (or protect its emotions)..... i know cancers like security and memories but if we understand each other with our own personality i think would be lovely....... there has to be confidence between each other and i think results will be allright....|`|Nnplp5Qqaa	Yeah...I think it happens a lot with Cancers+Leos too. but if you're a cancer, stay away from Sagittarius. gemini, stay away from scorpio|`|9QF6GGyiaa	Yes there is definitely strong attraction at first but these signs aren't too compatible.
RetVJj8Oaa	I love that earring. xD It was made in a special edition artbox by the company that is now out of business.

UAHjJpC0aa	unfortunately<br>  it's starting to become true<br>  <br>  so many people steal music these days .....?????<br>  <br>  why should a band have to tour constantly, <br>  just to pay the rent?<br>  <br>  this is why a LOT of good musicians an artists have left the business...<br>  they can't pay their bills anymore<br>  <br>  edit<br>  <br>  the band makes the CD/record/songs with "Advance money",<br>  which means they can't really just offer a song up for free, very often....<br>  <br>  they will have to pay the hundreds of thousands they spent in the studio, out of their own pockets !<br>  <br>  One reason (not a good one) that they make so little on their songs, (and it DOES vary with the group, and how they "cut costs") is that they have to pay back the money spent in the recording studio, BEFORE they get any "profits".<br>  <br>  kind of a catch 22?|`|WU4MHq3aaa	most reasonably successful bands with a steady fan base make most of their money touring..<br>  <br>  the record label makes quite a bit off their album sales..<br>  <br>  but yes... merchandise is BIG|`|785d07b11864df1b07a99374609e381eaa	Yup. People love band shirts.<br>  <br>  EDIT: Also they make half profit from iTunes. Nobody really buys CDs anymore.|`|y1xPK3Txaa	Unless you are a fairly well known (read: legendary band that sells hundreds of billions of records and your new album will automatically go platinum), or are independent, most rock/metal bands make their music from touring and selling their merchandise.  Most of the money for the records goes to the label, and the musician barely sees a penny of it.|`|cfda9b5d078d37da24e0ff1809dee8d5aa	A band only gets between $0.02 to $0.10 per CD sold, and sometimes not even that if the owe the record company money against their advances.<br>  <br>  On the other hand they can get anywhere upwards of 50% of the proceeds of merchandise like T-shirts.|`|ebxwADDcaa	a lot of lesser known bands, yea. <br>  <br>  I went to a concert and the band Architects told everyone to buy merch because they were poor. <br>  <br>  im sure once anyone gets signed to a major label they are making a decent living though.|`|0O0YzRH5aa	I've heard that also.<br>  <br>  Jared Leto of 30 Seconds to Mars has said that his band hasn't made a penny of profit from album sales.  Supposedly, the band is thinking about just offering their next album for free, and making money in all of the other more likely areas.|`|CjPtAEzmaa	I think so.<br>  You should read Alex James' biography.<br>  He talks a lot about when the band he was in, Blur, was just getting famous.<br>  They somehow ended up in debt, so they toured america and sold posters, t-shirts etc. and then they weren't in debt. <br>  Yeah.|`|WHcBV7rLaa	Well that seems reasonable, due to downloading and whatnot. But I buy albums, haha.|`|AgQForcYaa	Yesh, that's what I hear. <br>  <br>  BUY A T-SHIRT!!

UFE7BJHBaa	YES YES Yes - Yer Friend is absolutely right.  <br>  Noticed that back in the day.  Good Riff, tho.  AGREE?<br>  <br>  By the way - if ta get a chance, download the song "Destroyer" by the Kinks, and see if ya can guess what song "IT" sounds like.<br>  <br>  let us know @ A Later Date !!!|`|AgQForcYaa	I  just saw someone answer a "similar songs" question with that the other day! <br>  <br>  And I was hummed them both in my head, and was like "Oh, SNAP! They DO!" <br>  <br>  But hey, might be a coincidence. Jim Morrison doesn't seem like one who would rip off another artist.|`|SXJTZP5zaa	The beat sounds a little similar, but not similar enough to sue over.|`|IIpEaDCcaa	oooh yeah it does...|`|f79674f11cb0d8833ea9b2f32ce01461aa	They are both very staticco.<br>  A bit of history on the doors song. Jim Morrison saw a girl, but didn't talk with her...instead he went to his apartment and wrote the song about what he WANTED to say to her.|`|Ju1skLb8aa	yes they do sound a lot alike. funny how someone else noticed that.<br>  when i was about 7 i always got the 2 confused because i thought they sounded the same. im 16 now and a HUGE Jim Morrison/Doors fan :]|`|Z2dtfjPbaa	It kinda does but I can still tell the differencee|`|ykcpQhWzaa	sounds nice my friend|`|uAyYRXnvaa	Yes, they do have a similar rhythym.

Their wrestling loving fathers first introduced them to one another when they were 6 years old. Assuming that she was the best in wrestling, young Hikari challenged Kei to a wrestling match only to be thoroughly defeated by him. Ever since that fateful incident, Hikari swore to beat Kei in school grades, a sporting event - anything. To do this she has enrolled in the same school as Kei since elementary. Now she attends Hakusenkan, an ultra elite school, that costs her carpenter father a lot of money.

Chuck replied, "Don't you know who I am? I'm Chuck Norris!" The mere mention of his name cured this man blindness. Sadly the first, last, and only thing this man ever saw, was a fatal roundhouse delivered by Chuck Norris.|`|piH2RMezaa	Chuck Norris once roundhouse kicked someone so hard that his foot broke the speed of light, went back in time, and killed Amelia Earhart while she was flying over the Pacific Ocean. <br>  <br>  Crop circles are Chuck Norris' way of telling the world that sometimes corn needs to lie down. <br>  <br>  Chuck Norris is ten feet tall, weighs two-tons, breathes fire, and could eat a hammer and take a shotgun blast standing.<br>  <br>  The Great Wall of China was originally created to keep Chuck Norris out.

Look it up in wikipedia.|`|MWx7E1rlaa	huh? sorry, as far i know the series has ended, but would you mind sending me the link to the video ur talking about? im sure that Lelouch is dead and the series has ended.|`|RetVJj8Oaa	The 26th episode is a compilation episode, and then there is a sequal of 25 episodes.|`|dpAD1KoEaa	well I dont want to give anything away but there is far more.... i mean zero still hasn't lost everything yet... i'm not sure he will but he probably lost his heart in yesterdays episode...
8yE2sYGeaa	No Frost/Cheney, as Frost is dead.<br>  <br>  As to the rest of it, it sometimes appears that the only thing conservatives want to conserve is being conservative|`|n55igpCUaa	Wrong section, but you are talking to a liberal democrat, borderline socialist.<br>  <br>  We're up to billions spent in Iraq. Not really "conserving" anything.

tqIaTWkHaa	no<br>  that movie was the best movie i saw this year. excellent.|`|niDOzrJraa	Have you seen it?|`|NLXhW9rBaa	I haven't seen it|`|fuTLmHBQaa	Yes, it is overrated.<br>  <br>  The Academy generally leans toward the "message of the movie" in its deciding factor for Best Picture. Apparently, they were willing to disregard mediocre acting, cinematography, and other elements for it's message.<br>  <br>  For example, Benjamin Button WAS a better movie. You could argue the message of Slumdog is better but in my opinion, Button not only had a better message, but it was executed amazingly. I'm a big sucker for great cinematography and just aesthetic visuals so that movie blew me away unlike Slumdog.<br>  <br>  I'm not saying Slumdog is bad, I'm just saying it is overated. I'd give it an 8.1/10 which is a very good rating it's just not on par with other movies like Button.|`|44c352a49807fd606b77f2a102ce7a23aa	hahah 5 now, just won the Best musical score category..<br>  I think it was pretty good, very original and moving, I liked it.<br>  <br>  -----<br>  oops 6 already...oh my I think I see it coming...<br>  Best director?

This is too much!!! <br>  This is cracking me up hah<br>  ---------------<br>  Darn.. breathe buddy, it won everything lol unbelievable, I dont know if it was too much or not, it was a good movie, not sure if it was the best though, but it's the winner|`|d22RPJRVaa	Personally, I thought that movie was AMAZING and they totally deserve it.<br>  <br>  But that's just me..

yAXrsQiFaa	Yes. I don't even watch them anymore. I think it's rigged, I think those that really deserve to win do not. It's a favorites contest....|`|9IvcV7tiaa	Not a big deal to me. I  think they used to be, back when there were real "movie stars". Hollywood lost it's glamour years back. And it's too long and drawn out. I don't watch it. And treating actors as if they are doing something so wonderful, I mean the millions they get, for what, acting? It's crazy.|`|LPCfOtiKaa	I think they're a big deal because of the sheer talent that some of these people have. Honouring them is awesome. But honestly there are better award ceremonies that honour people not for talent but for life achievements, humanitarian work, literary works etc.  You know, things that contribute to the well being of the world.|`|4zuTkXW2aa	I've quit watching because I've never seen anything that gets nominated.

Rihanna got jealous, snatched the phone and started flipping out. She started hitting him (not sure where but he DEFINITELY has marks) and shouting. Chris Brown couldn't drive under these conditions so he stopped the car.<br>  <br>  At this point, Rihanna threw the keys out of the ignition and this set Chris off but he did not hit her... YET. When he couldn't find the keys, he returned to the car and yelled at her for throwing them. Rihanna put her hands over Chris Brown's mouth and thats how Rihanna got the bite marks.<br>  <br>  Rihanna then said something that REALLY set Chris Brown off. According to reliable sources, Rihanna said something to the affect of "Why don't you beat me up like your step-dad did to your mother?"<br>  <br>  This really set Chris off as his family past is a very sensitive subject. Chris went into a fit of rage and hit Rihanna a few times.<br>  <br>  In short, Rihanna instigated the fight and Chris Brown took it WAY too far. Neither person is innocent in this case.|`|bf2a3cdfd3a1c0386023cef0e5cd4b0faa	Okay I heard it was about a little argument they were having... putting each other down... However Chris Brown took it too far and Rihanna got mad and she pretended to call her friends telling them to have the cops there... he got angry so he started hitting her... and you know the rest..<br>  <br>  I'm not on either side... I think it's both their faults for having a stupid argument in the first place.|`|CD83zn9paa	i really didnt expect this violent behavior from chris brown at all...nd it was mad stupid how he reacted...rihanna new she had herpes y wuld she decide to pass it on isnt that like illegal or sumtin...but anyways,i no that rumor bout jz gots beyonce pissed..ha ha ha|`|rdcUOa1zaa	i dont care what happened between them with herpes or whatever but i do not think anything she does should make him resort to physical violence. he almost killed her!

di43MlSFaa	On Musical Notation:<br>  <br>  "Roman philosopher and statesman Boethius (c. 475-525) was the first to associate music with the alphabet, using the first fifteen letters of the Roman alphabet to indicate notes that were in use at the end of the Roman period. This system evolved over time, with Benedictine monk Guido d' Arezzo adding the staff at the end of the 12th Century, placing the letters on certain lines to indicate their pitch.<br>  <br>  In the 15th Century, time signatures were added, and the notes evolved into a rounded shape. The 5-line staff with auxiliary lines became standard in the 16th Century, and expression signs and Italian phrases indicating tempo and dynamics were added in the 17th Century.<br>  <br>  Ludwig van Beethoven was one of the first composers to use metronome markings on his scores to indicate tempo, having been acquainted with Johann Nepomuk Maelzel, who perfected the metronome around 1815".<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.musicbizadvice.com/who_invented_musical_notation.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.musicbizadvice.com/who_invent...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/2097/who-invented-musical-notation" rel="nofollow">http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read...</a>|`|CR2BQ1Jdaa	Boethius used as Boethian notation

Beauty and appearance doesn't matter unless you're shallow. Looks fade; don't get attached. "The man she is with and how he makes her feel"!!!? Are you serious? What kind of girl are you?? So if you're with an abuser and he makes you feel like crap that makes you a special girl? so you're confidence depends on how someone else makes you feel? that's as pathetic as your confidence going up and down depending on the amount of thumbs ups you get . that doesn't even make any sense<br>  <br>  You can look at this page and tell that everyone has a different view of what makes someone special. I think things like confidence, respect, and humor are just personality traits that vary from person to person. It doesn't make you special though. All of those traits can be developed. Having a physical connection or in other words giving head or having sex doesn't make you special since a prostitute could do that and she wouldn't be special in his eyes.<br>  <br>  Being special to me means being unique. <br>  It's the way you think, not the way you look. <br>  If you think the way you look makes you special, then how will you feel when your looks deteriorate and all you have left is a brain that thinks being special was the way you looked?<br>  I think someone is special if they have the ability to create because that can't be taught, or if they have depth, if they're modest...truly modest and not just saying "I'm modest" because they know it looks good <br>  I guess in a way all of our are special because our imperfections make us unique.

lpyWVR2oaa	It is common to have very different looking lines on both palms, so fret not. Personally, I don't use the notion of 'dominant hand' because both palms represent half of your whole individuality each and are equally important. Of course, this differs from palmist to palmist. <br>  <br>  I would view the right hand as the 'outer world', the face you show to your external surroundings, to people you come into contact with on a social basis like your bosses, co-workers etc. This is more like a facade and can be compared to the Ascendant/Rising sign used in astrology.<br>  <br>  The left hand would mean the 'inner world' which reveals the true individuality of a person, through interactions with those he/she is intimate with - spouses, family, partners etc.<br>  <br>  Not all life lines are curved. When they go upwards, it represents a highly independent nature which is not tied to the family emotionally nor does the person take family influences into consideration when making major decisions in life.
i8Pl0Pejaa	Just keep practicing, if you think you can sing, then you probably can, if someone tells you you can't that should encourage you to keep singing, haha. <br>  When i started my band i was really scared to sing as well, but as you become more familiar with your voice, and playing with other people you become more confident. <br>  Take up lessons if you feel the need to, no its not just a girl thing, lots of my guy friends have singing lessons. <br>  And definitely guitar+singing, do both. That's what I'm doing now, and it's the best.<br>  Good luck!|`|te2Us3mYaa	Hey man, voice lessons are not a girl thing.<br>  I take them and they've been a really great help.<br>  you'll learn how to make the right vowel shapes and it can even help increase your vocal range.<br>  <br>  Also, don't give up on the guitar either.|`|4X7b0s5daa	good luck i tried that but it did not work out|`|Z13CWyNGaa	I can't teach you to sing, I'm still trying to find my own singing voice, but I can help you with "I'm too shy to sing in front of strangers" problem. You ever heard of the saying, if you can sing in front of your friends you can sing in front of any body. Well it worked for me. First time I tried to scream sing for them it was bad, but they encouraged me. Now I scream sing pretty good, and I can do it for any one, just don't ask me to sing normally... A little liquid courage helps too just not too much because you can't sing drunk (very well) and it dries you out and can do some real damage to your throat.|`|zOKHhBvLaa	okay well to me both ideas are good but if u really want to step i up then u should take so singing lessons that's is how the famous singers are so good at singing|`|bbf5ba03e8f1091ed1d55be1570e5916aa	Do what you're good at, then work on other areas|`|KkZE2NDYaa	There are plenty of artists that sing who are not great singers. Bob Dylan, Tom Waites, Leonard Cohen, Iggy Pop, etc. You just have to find a style that suits your abilities. There is nothing wrong with a guy taking voice lessons. Even if you never have a lot of range it will teach you things like proper breathing, phrasing and other things that help. Singing and playing an instrument at the same time adds even more difficulty. You have to be comfortable with each one before you can do both at the same time. I played drums a long time before I could drum and sing at the same time. And I sing better if I don't have to play and play better if I don't have to sing. That's just a compromise you have to live with. But no matter what, they all take hard work, practice, and sticking with it. But if you have the heart and believe in yourself, you will find a way, Good luck|`|r1WMBKvuaa	If you have a great desire to learn to sing, you have some hope.<br>  Some people think they can't sing because they really don't care about it.<br>  However if you cannot tell the difference between the notes or are tone deaf, you will have a harder time than someone who can. If you go to a vocal coach be sure to tell them you know you cannot sing but you are willing to work hard to find out if you can improve. If you end up not being able to sing, concentrate on some other instrument and strive to be the best and work hard at it.

To get more views, maybe funnier jokes and to improve your videos, try looking in the camera next time, not at yourself when you're recording, to the viewer, it'll seem like you're looking straight at them. that's a good thing.|`|yg1dRXnmaa	It was pretty funny I noticed the camera was a little fidgety try using a tri-pod also try filming in a lighter place other wise it was pretty funny.|`|QCPddhlUaa	Try to promote your video with YouTube.

4999d7adc142f277d9650c9fcdbb39cdaa	It's definately a very good movie. You should go watch it. I ended up seeing it with a group of friends because there was nothing else to watch in theaters. I'm glad I did.|`|m5fuOGAiaa	no.  but it isnt THAT bad either.  It's just got more substance than most mainstream movies and I guess its one of those movies that introduces another culture to the west through some kind of overdramatized struggle.  Not to say the struggle is exaggerated but I'm betting it is nowhere near as interesting.<br>  <br>  So my answer is; its relative.  If all your favorite movies are blockbuster hits, or if you like more than half the movies you see, this is probably a great movie.  If your hard to please like I am, its no big deal.|`|3Thbv1Vvaa	I really doubt it could be as good as Wall-e, which was robbed because 'the Academy' can't get over themselves and realize that animated movies can easily be on par with live action.|`|w2Dui70Faa	Good and overrated, yes.|`|FCwuGH24aa	It bored me!|`|PKMJFq9Baa	YES!|`|up3AyHSIaa	dat movie is dam so gud..|`|JD5NQxeNaa	It is the best movie of the year and maybe last 2 or 3 years bar none. It really is that good. Danny Boyle has recreated magic after I thought he was done after Trainspotting.|`|CJzbIhWuaa	its definitely not the dark knight|`|AA11464625	It is about a dog who lives in the slums and out of the thin blue air he becomes a millionaire. I do not get the hype about a movie that shows what a dog that lived in the slums, does with a million bucks. This dog could have given some of the money to his slum dog buddies but the slum dog invest most of the million in a 401k. Now what is that all about? I would have looked into an IRA or some sort of mutual fund outside of the 401k. So to answer your question I must say I see nothing spectacular about a dog who waits around for his 401k to mature.|`|AeJrpZGqaa	It was better than the other nominees, except for maybe Milk. I thought The Wrestler, In Bruges, and Wall-E were the best movies of the year. It should've had no problem beating Benjamin Button and I haven't seen Frost/Nixon or the Reader.|`|AA11311516	lol, I am sitting here watching the awards thinking the same thing.

PIjCNYQNaa	When my dad was little, he and his brother were in church, and my uncle wrote "Ded kat" (dead cat) on a paper and my dad had to sit still through the rest of church. So if we have a bunch of used batteries, I usually write Ded on the bag.<br>  <br>  My friend Rachel and I were TA's for our music teacher in high school, and one day we were in his office and she tripped on a drum and yelled, "Holy Bible!" because what had gotten her attention was a King James version sitting on the bottom of the bookcase. So if we find something interesting, we call it Holy Bible.<br>  <br>  Another music story. Rachel and I were going through old music binders and we found one from the musical Grease. The spine of the binder said "FREDDY MY LOVE". In our emails, she signs as Freddy My Love, and I sign as Freddie My Love. (Because that's how I thought it was spelled before she corrected me. But I'm still Freddie.)|`|AM33tqYAaa	that one asian guy<br>  <br>  its a joke from chinatown about 2 weeks ago<br>  <br>  asian guy - you want fireworks<br>  me - i want egg roe<br>  him - you buy fireworks<br>  me - you buy me egg roll|`|7gpAdJGaaa	ITS RIGHT HERE ENJOY THE PIE IN YOUR FACE DUDE!!!|`|6C24kJhaaa	mine is i have this really white friend, so we make fun of him and say he's gay (he's not) and we tease him and once while we were doing so <br>  <br>  he bursted out saying "i dont like black cock" n we're like where the heck did you get that from? lol lmao hhahhaha so funnnny|`|C25Hw0mIaa	"***** U DONT KNOW MY LIFE"<br>  "tru dat.."<br>  "PROSTITOT!!"

SyKtEcncaa	Why do you feel it is necessary to qualify that your character is a geek (and not a ****)?  I don't think there's usually any association with geek girls being sluts...and it's not very nice to assume that non-geek girls are all sluts, either.  Just a bit of confusion on my part.<br>  <br>  My main contention with the comic is the hosted format, to be honest.  It's too small to read without using the "larger view" option, but you can't click through the pages from the larger window.<br>  <br>  The artwork is a little rough, but an artist's work is always unpolished in the beginning - half the fun of reading long-running webcomics is watching the artwork improve.  Stick with it!

ab250551cde4aadbf54a0fea8a7b14e1aa	"Persepolis" is essentially a coming-of-age story. It is the memoir of Marjane Strapi, an Iranian woman who was born in 1969 and underwent the travails of adolescence at the same time that her country was struggling through an astonishing revolution. Her perspective is not unique -- obviously there were plenty of little girls in Iran in the late '70s -- but she is the only one so far to write a graphic novel based on her experiences and subsequently turn it into an animated film. <br>  <br>  "Persepolis" is a cartoon, mostly in black-and-white, almost entirely in French (Satrapi lives in France now), and framed around the Iranian Revolution. It is named for the ancient ceremonial capital of Persia, a detail that is not mentioned in the film itself.|`|VYWaL2graa	Persepolis|`|Gem96NQyaa	Persepolis

m4PtEEDNaa	...oh, without a doubt, two of the most famous, two of the most funniest, two of the most heart-felt, and two of my most personal favorites...."The Errand Boy" and "The Bellboy"...|`|ZyGyDLsDaa	The best has to be "The Nutty Professor"! I watched it a few weeks ago on TCM and was even more amazed by the film than ever before. I saw this at the drive-in long, long ago and certainly did not understand how remarkable it is though I remember how frightening my sister and I found the transformation scene. Seeing it in my late 50s, I can appreciate so much more about it, and I was surprised to learn how much input Jerry Lewis had in the design, even the color choices, of this movie. It gets two thumbs up from me!<br>  <br>  Runnerup is "Artists and Models", which matches up Jerry and the equally frenetic Shirley MacLaine. One of the funniest scenes in any comedy is when Shirley belts out "Innamorata" to shy, stumbling Jerry! It's colorful, well-written and well-paced, with lots of memorable songs and bits with Martin & Lewis. I think it contains some of the best work Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis have done. <br>  <br>  I'm partial to "The Delicate Delinquent", too. I haven't seen it for a long time yet recall scenes from it that make me want to see it again someday.<br>  <br>  I have to admit that I would have to refresh my memory of other movies because many of them I haven't seen since childhood. Oh! I have to add another one that just came to mind!<br>  <br>  "The Geisha Boy" is sweet, gentle, funny and so good that I ought to add it to suggestion lists occasionally. There are great sight gags, lots of good in-jokes, wonderful performances from everyone, and Harry the Rabbit in Jerry's magic show. I still am not quite sure when it's Harry and a stunt-dummy (stunt-bunny?), whether he's standing on his hind feet, leaning against the case, or sliding down a bannister. *giggle* I can't believe I almost forgot that one! I AM getting old and forgetful!|`|0uBITVyGaa	<a href="http://www.filmsandtv.com/movies/jerrylewis.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.filmsandtv.com/movies/jerryle...</a>

58d6b4483a329162e1f9eeafcf972793aa	Let's face it, some people get recognized more after they expire. Honestly he should have won Best Supporting Actor for the film Brokeback Mountain, instead of Dark Knight.  Some times the tragedy or nature of one's death will trigger an award undeserving of the actor. Though he played a heck of a role as the Joker, he should not have that award..|`|GQo01nc9aa	the dark knight came out after he died. he didnt get to see it but everyone knows he did a phenominal job and he did deserve all the awards he got.|`|Kdph0XLXaa	Maybe that's because the projects that he completed right before he died were worthy of awards whereas, say, "A Knight's Tale" totally blew.|`|WLwMKsMZaa	True. But the sad thing is that his best project came right before he died. The Dark Knight.

hmsCFQocaa	You get your feelings out there, but the lyrics tend to be held back. Lyrics like using the word "pathetic" twice, and "seems that I'm a mess", are not strong statements.<br>  <br>  The idea is a keeper, but the mundaneness of the lyrics won't sting like unrequited love.

I do think she has lots of talent, but I just hope she learns to be a little more appreciative of her status and understand that she is a role model.|`|pmiKJGJmaa	LOL! well i think it might also be because she can't really sing and they only make her singing such a big deal cuz of her dad!!! but i still like her show though. i just wish she would stick to acting ONLY and the singing that goes with the character on her show.|`|M9LLimOYaa	mm.. its kinda gross that your smelling something? weirdd... but<br>  personally, i hate her because she is untalented and her music sounds terrible.

XbeHIzOLaa	All record companies accept demos - it's what they do.  However, they receive so many that it's likely that your demo will go unnoticed - so it's a good idea to send many, to many different record labels.  Go for all the record labels that sell music similar to yours - just look on the back of any of your favorite cds.  If they take interest, they may wish to watch you perform live (if you do so), and the ball gets rolling from there.  Hope that helped.|`|l1SVSF7zaa	most record companies will only take an interest in you if they've seen you perform before.  so go out and perform as much as possible.<br>  <br>  they'll also only sign you if they really think that you can sell.  if not, then they won't.
80II1Wv1aa	I prefer the Dark Knight Joker, but it has NOTHING to do with who played him, it's all in the writing.|`|P8gGMlbIaa	Jack.<br>  <br>  You have to be crazy to play the Joker|`|6c7e9e289fd5db36cd934c29dca6003eaa	Jack.|`|KLRQqVWfaa	Well i never actually saw Jack Nicholson as the Joker but after i watched The Dark Knight I saw that the other one was on....som i turned it on and he was that and i couldn't watch it because i was like wow Heath Ledger was so much better i thought Jack Nicholson was more of a joke.|`|TrPySdXFaa	Heath Ledger|`|8v40KEd0aa	Both in their own right.|`|h10ZwZtbaa	Wait till they get a load of me... I remembered how jack looked like, and the sinister laugh.. It was the way the scripts called for each character.  If you'll switch their movies/eras, you'll all probably be singing praises about Jack like what heath is getting (with all due respects to a dead good actor). <br>  <br>  But to be honest Heath's joker is no different to what all the "serial killers" portrayed in the movies, deranged and almost indestructible....I'd say Jack all the way!  What more if he's gotten Heath's script.|`|Kdph0XLXaa	Their performances are too different to compare them this way. I would call Nicholson's Joker very flowery with good, clean lines to his tapestry. Ledger's was very gritty, with extremely jagged edges. <br>  <br>  I thought they were both extraordinary but found Ledger's portrayal much more memorable...especially at the end where he walks out of the hospital dressed a nurse's uniform, giving the WTF look because the bomb didn't explode on time. I think that image has been stamped onto my brain forever. While I remember what Nicholson looked like as the Joker, I don't remember anything he said or did.|`|yYQJS2paaa	Heath Ledger definitely<br>  <br>  he was just so good it was unbelievable<br>  it was like a really haunting performance|`|oH0u3RxJaa	The one who died playing as him...was awsome. Too bad he had to...well, die playing as Joker. He had so much potentials.|`|knKVjOE6aa	Heath of course he played him so evil and insane which is what the joker is.|`|bbf5ba03e8f1091ed1d55be1570e5916aa	Jack is the best joker by far.  Heath was just too serious|`|c8akEWGnaa	heath ledger all the way.
UuSK08pyaa	I swear there is a scene like that in Sweet November, but I could be wrong.

AA10175631	I'd suggest Weeds. I've watched a few episodes of 30 Rock, at to be honest, I didn't see much there. I think 30 Rock may have gained in popularity due to Tina Fey's awesome performances as Sarah Palin on SNL. Plus, since Weeds is a Showtime series, it's a bit more risque and adult-oriented. 30 Rock seems kinda childish in comparison.|`|kgMp0d5jaa	I would suggest 30 Rock. It is a hilarious comedy show with lots of different charcter types who a have their own type of humor.  Whichever you download, though, you can get the other on freeonlineepisodes.net. Although hey don't have every show on TV, they have almost every episodes of those they do have (and they do have 30 Rock and Weeds)|`|F8x36rrSaa	I haven't seen or heard of 30 Rock but i do watch weeds i've seen every episode.<br>  <br>  Great show love it definitely worth downloading <br>  <br>  my advice is that since u put weeds before 30 Rock when u asked that question means that u thought of weeds first so in your mind u really picked weeds lol!!!|`|8yE2sYGeaa	This is a really tough call, but i like 30 Rock a hair more|`|2lLhCBJDaa	Weeds!

But afterwords, stick around (it didn't take much longer than 30 or 40 minutes for me) and hang around by his tour bus or outside the doors and he'll come out and sign autographs. There should be a good group of 20 people waiting around and he'll know why you're there and come over. He's very personable and wants to meet his fans so it will probably work. It did for me. Good luck, I really hope you meet him.|`|ZcrqGl5Naa	HAVE NO IDEA|`|kJ80vsVNaa	well i've been to concerts with bands that are<br>  kinda underground like, forever the sickest kids, all time low,<br>  etc. and they usually come out and talk to fans while they wait in line<br>  or if you wait outside the venue after the show for a few hours<br>  you could meet him and wait until he comes out, if he even comes out through weherever you wait for him, good luck :D

025wasRZaa	The answer above me is correct. The composition is known as Fur Elise (though it is actually a Bagatelle).<br>  <br>  Edit:<br>  <br>  Simple Complexity, thank you for reminding me. Moonlight Sonata was also written for one of Beethoven's students.|`|aSTmFCiBaa	his immortal beloved was la bella condessa gucciardi,whose silhouette appears in a beethoven bio by robert haven schauffer,he wrote the appasionata for her,guess she was a dish|`|xcPzZvsraa	The piece was not in itself "about unrequited love" although Beethoven certainly had experience of such.<br>  <br>  You could be speaking of either of the pieces already mentioned although to be honest I don't think the term applies here because in both the examples  it wasn't the young lady in question who rejected Beethoven's amorous advances but rather the parents or in the case of the recipient of the "Fur Elise" I think it was the girls uncle who admonished against Beethoven's proposal of marriage.   <br>  <br>  As regards the C sharp minor sonata known as the "moonlight" it was dedicated  to Countess Giulietta Guicciardi, a pupil of Beethoven.<br>  <br>  Similarly the Bagatelle in A minor known as 'Fur Elise' the common consensus is that he wrote it for another of his students named Therese Malfatti.<br>  <br>  From my understanding it is believed Beethoven proposed to both these students and both times the parents of the young girls forbade it.|`|aEnWEGjCaa	I'm not quite sure what your thinking of, but the first thing that pops into my mind is the Moonlight Sonata.

iWLaHVbfaa	my choice, my body...pro choice|`|jHDeIPEfaa	Adoption. So many women use abortion as a form of contraception. I don't appreciate the government using my hard earned money to fund abortions. Abortion is against my beliefs and principles. And now Obama wants to give our money to other countries to perform abortions. He is freaking pathetic!!!<br>  <br>  To those who chose abortion as their choice for this question because they don't want to go through nine months of pregnancy, you have two other choices. You can choose to keep your legs together or you can use your brain and use birth control when you have sex.<br>  <br>  Abortion is MURDER!! You can call a baby a fetus all you want. But it is still a BABY!! The baby's right to life is taken from them when they are aborted. <br>  <br>  It may be your body but it is also the home for nine months of the baby's life. You have no right to kill an innocent baby. If you don't want to have a baby, don't have sex or use birth control.|`|ncSd9jXDaa	my body my choice???<br>  <br>  <br>  thats just stupid!!! did you ask the baby for its choice?? ugghhh!!<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  hahah, you know how much money is going towards abortion from the pork bill?|`|CArzkDIUaa	I would adopt.

But, rape is also another problem and I personally don't blame them....<br>  <br>  Personally, I'm all for adoption|`|KaAXJJo8aa	adoption|`|6JimMvcDaa	True, True, True.<br>  Messed up world.|`|IqhD4JCCaa	white people?|`|dlqa6yFkaa	Adoption is overlooked nowadays and I think it's a shame. My best friend is adopted and has been aware of this all her life and says she would not want it any other way. Even 30yrs ago her parents waited almost 6yrs for a baby to become available. I have another friend who has been unable to conceive on her own or with IVF and when we mentioned adoption as something maybe she should look into she was horrified by the idea, telling us she must have one of her own.<br>  <br>  I feel the system being "broken" comes down to not enough people wanting to adopt and these kids going into foster homes. People that want to adopt children have different wants and motives to people that just foster children. I'm not saying foster parents are bad people just that the children they foster are not becoming theirs to keep. Also it is lot easier to keep a baby yourself and stuff up it's life than it is to just give it away when it is born.|`|OPKbGXUFaa	Because some people don't want to go through 9 months of being pregnant.<br>  <br>  I choose abortion.<br>  <br>  And you have to look at it at this perspective. There's a lot of kids in orphanages right now, more than what people are willing to adopt. If you are aborted, virtually it's not even murder because you're a fetus. So would you rather die as a fetus or spend years a an orphanage know you're unwanted?|`|hvdkLOT3aa	i think that it matters what you think is right.  if someone wants to have an abortion let them, its their own body.  and i think that it is their decision what they want to do with their own body.  it's theirs not someone else's.  so i think that no one should be told what they can and can't do.  I AM PRO-CHOICE AND PROUD|`|sixm6Vlraa	because some people can;t go through with knowing they carried a baby and can;t keep it. also they may be embarrassed to tell their friends and family they got pregnant.

Or, they bring up the one-in-a-million scenario to defend abortion.. "what if my drunk uncle elmer rapes me and I get pregnant?" To that I say, what if your mother had just decided it was too much bother to have you, and exercised "her choice" and had your brains vacuumed out, followed by the rest of your unborn body? Heck, that's ok! She wants to focus on her career! It's an intelligent, rational choice!<br>  <br>  It's not just "your choice." That's selfish thinking. There's a human life being ended. It's their choice too, but abortion kills them before they can express their natural desire to live. <br>  Anyone who has an abortion is a murderer, period.|`|I7Cs8hu1aa	firstly, not that much tax payer money goes to abortion.<br>  <br>  second, yes the system of adopting is pretty broken. Quite a lot of red tape and expense.<br>  <br>  third, I would wager that many of the ladies undergoing an abortion would just as soon forego the 9 month of pregnancy and the cost/pain of delivering the baby just to see it get taken away.<br>  <br>  fourth, there are plenty of older kids to adopt, why do people insist on adopting babies?|`|3Fma3URSaa	Abortion<br>  I was adopted and I'm not saying that I don't want to be alive but I'd rather die in my mother stomach then die from lack of money in the orphanage and not have enough money to support kids if I was never lucky enough to find a family.<br>  We don't need even more people in poverty just because someone ucked up the pregnant girl.|`|c8TXAAj1aa	Abortions can be kept a secret. People try to keep adoptions secret, but since thats a horrible idea, it blows up on them and people are hurt.<br>  <br>  If more people raised their children with acceptance and love, and informed them early on that they were adopted and have two sets of parents who love them (but one set who had their own issues), people would all be better off. The truth is always better, and it doesnt have to be watered down or used bluntly to be effective.|`|WpBQlRkQaa	Pro-choice. <br>  I wish people didn't need them, but with all the rape,wars, and in-breeding, we don't really need any more idiots in this world.<br>  But I also agree that it isn't a form of birth control. Have you ever been on one of those anti-abortion websites? They have these women whoare telling their storys about how they were so stupid to get abortions and how they're wrong. And they've had about five or six abortions?|`|bd035cd5fbed641889c4230d224d60d3aa	I don't think I could do either one. I could never kill a baby, and I could never carry one for 9 months then give it away. Either choice would just break my heart. But for the record, even though I would never choose abortion, I am pro choice. Every one needs to do what they feel is right for them.|`|P1Ahvv3Saa	I don't think that there are enough people that are willing to adopt, and keeping a child at a centre is expensive.

6Fuh3iqIaa	One Piece is great. It take a while to get into because unlike Naruto and Bleach that grab your attention on their first early episode, One Piece building its momentum slowly and keep getting better and better after that. I saw Naruto a long time ago, and I loved it. The Zabuza arc was great. The Chunin exam was great. Sannins were great. But, then I saw One Piece. I was bored by it at first, even though I liked the Kuro and Buggy a lot. But then I saw Arlong. From then on, One Piece equal greatness. It went from something to watch when you are bored, to something I anticipated more than Naruto.<br>  <br>  Other anime I would recommend<br>  <br>  D Gray Man<br>  Reborn!<br>  Yuyu Hakusho<br>  Soul Eater|`|6sgDopRBaa	One Piece for sure.

8yE2sYGeaa	WALL-E is an excellent example of sound mixing, as that movie is nothing but sounds. We are also talking about those ambient sound sin the background to add a sense of "depth"<br>  <br>  Sound editing is making sure that the sounds follow from scene to scene and are true to what we think the sounds should be|`|5mIhU9KAaa	usually in a scene when there is a lot of action or things going on is when "mixing" is used. like in an action scene they will have different sounds like guns going off, people yelling, and music all at the same time. editing is basicly just editing out the sounds that don't need to be used|`|n6P1mOJiaa	Sound Editing: putting together all the sounds that are in the film from various sources and making them seem like they are a seamless part of the film. In an action movie, you might have characters yelling, bullets flying and hitting walls, cars and helicopter sounds, and a pulsating soundtrack. You want the yelling to match the characters mouth movement, the bullet sounds to pop at the moment they hit something, and the car tires to screech when braking, not accelerating.<br>  <br>  Sound Mixing: determining the levels of all those things listed above, making it seem realistic (or unrealistic, if that is the desired effect). You wouldn't want all of those sounds to be at the same level because you couldn't hear one over the other.

zgMSRwnwaa	lol I agree... I'm not too big of a fan of the lovey dovey animes... Some ones I LOVE:<br>  <br>  1. Full Metal Alchemist (MY FAV! but I wasn't too happy about the ending ((as a warning)))<br>  2. Naruto<br>  3. Bleach (you said it but I love it)<br>  4. Death Note (not too much action, but it was still REALLY good)<br>  5. Soul Eater (lot of action, but their aren't any dubbed... yet)<br>  6. Devil May Cry (TONS OF ACTION. I almost didn't like it there was so much blood etc. but it turned out good. Only thing, it's pretty short)<br>  7. Wolf's Rain (it's ok... I'm not quite sure I like it yet, but theres still quite a bit of fighting, and not just human form...)<br>  <br>  Well, those are the ones I've seen and liked. And like I said, they all have at least a little action. I'd say the only one that doesn't is Death Note, but it's still really good! And they are all english dubbed, except Soul Eater.

I wish it could have ended on..."a happier note"? I can understand why the ending was as so, though. Ending the series there left a lot of "loose ends" that needed to be tied and could be accomplished so through the making of the movies that came out after the end of the series. I suppose this is one way to keep fans involved even after a series ends...|`|dpAD1KoEaa	you have a thing for short guys dont you...

Second, Metallica has some sick instrumentals (as in, crazy 'Tallica riffing with no vocals) but if you're limiting yourself to songs without vocals that's pretty much it. Some awesome riffs to songs with vocals are:<br>  Battery by Metallica<br>  Symphony of Destruction by Megadeth<br>  Fire It Up by Black Label Society<br>  Perry Mason by Ozzy<br>  The list goes, on, but those are a few examples.
2SIOE10Uaa	the middle- jimmy eat world<br>  or<br>  play crack the sky- brand new <br>  <br>  they are both fairly easy, and, even better, they're wonderful.|`|PeuFnqQwaa	Crimson and Clover - Tommy James<br>  Jesses Girl - Rick Springfield<br>  Hit me with your best shot - Pat Benetar<br>  <br>  Heres some more:<br>  <br>  When I started playing guitar, nobody taught me how to do it. It wasn't easy at first. My fretting hand's fingertips were so painful that I couldn't touch anything for days! But once I got the hang of it, I discovered it was one of the most enjoyable things I've ever done. Over the years I would look back at those times and smile thinking how my life was changed the moment I picked up the guitar. It was actually my big sister's guitar. However it turned out that I was more inclined to it that she was. She eventually turned over all the guitar playing duties to me.<br>  <br>  I thought of making a random list of easy guitar songs that beginners might want to try playing, just to get things started. It will cover different genres but the objective is to improve playing, one song at a time. These are the criteria I've used for the selection of the songs:<br>  <br>  a) Minimal number of chords -the less chords in a song, the easier it is to remember how to play it.<br>  <br>  b) Minimal barre chords - barre chords require us to use our fretting hand's index finger to press all 6 strings in a particular fret. Less barre chords is better for beginners. <br>  <br>  c) Familiarity of the song - the songs are some of the most popular during their times.<br>  <br>  And since we're talking about beginner songs here, the primary goal of this list is to give novice players some songs to STRUM the guitar along with. No point in doing any complicated stuff yet. We have to first establish the rhythm within the player. So here it goes, in no particular order:<br>  <br>  1. "Horse With No Name" - America<br>  <br>  Chords: Em, F#m7sus<br>  <br>  2. "Leaving On A Jet Plane" - John Denver<br>  <br>  Chords: G, C, D<br>  <br>  3. "No Rain" - Blind Melon<br>  <br>  Chords: E, D, A, G<br>  <br>  4. "Every Rose Has It's Thorns" - Poison<br>  <br>  Chords: G, C, D, Em<br>  <br>  5. "Knockin' On Heaven's Door" - Bob Dylan/ Guns N' Roses<br>  <br>  Chords: G, C, D, Am<br>  <br>  6. "One" - U2<br>  <br>  Chords: Am, D7, FM7, G<br>  <br>  7. "Four Strong Winds" - Neil Young<br>  <br>  Chords: C, Dm, G, F<br>  <br>  8. "I Remember You" - Skid Row<br>  <br>  Chords: G, C, D, Am, Em<br>  <br>  9. "Come As You Are" - Nirvana<br>  <br>  Chords: Em, D, G, Am, C<br>  <br>  10. "Wonderful Tonight" - Eric Clapton<br>  <br>  Chords: G, D, C, Em, Am<br>  <br>  <br>  Finger placement:<br>  <br>  C (x-3-2-0-1-0)<br>  <br>  D (x-x-0-2-3-2)<br>  <br>  D7 (x-x-0-2-1-2)<br>  <br>  E (0-2-2-1-0-0)<br>  <br>  Em (0-2-2-0-0-0)<br>  <br>  A (x-0-2-2-2-0)<br>  <br>  Am (x-0-2-2-1-0)<br>  <br>  F (x-x-3-2-1-1)<br>  <br>  FM7 (x-x-3-2-1-0)<br>  <br>  F#m7sus (2-0-0-2-0-0) G (3-2-0-0-0-3)<br>  <br>  Legend: <br>  <br>  D (x-x-0-2-3-2)<br>  <br>  D - the chord name<br>  <br>  x - E string will not be struck<br>  <br>  x - A string will not be struck<br>  <br>  0 - D string open<br>  <br>  2 - Press G string on 2nd fret<br>  <br>  3 - Press B string on 3rd fret<br>  <br>  2 - Press e string on 2nd fret<br>  <br>  There you go! Most of the songs have similar chords. That way, if we can recall chords from another some and incorporate that chord into another song then you get to practice applied knowledge.

10mOHSZTaa	This might sound really lame but honestly, start with Wikipedia.<br>  <br>  Stay away from movies like Amadeus, though; they perpetuate a lot of myths about composers.<br>  <br>  Ludwig van Beethoven often went by 'Louis' and sometimes tried to pass off the 'van' as a 'von.' 'Von' is an honorific, whereas 'van' just means 'of the'. You know what his name means? Ludwig of the Beet Garden. Louie Beet Garden.<br>  <br>  He was, of course, a brilliant composer, but he was also a guy just like any other guy.<br>  <br>  Robert Greenberg has a lot of good lectures on the topic of music and music history, which you can buy (expensive) get out of your library or pirate if you really wanted to, though I'd recommend supporting him.<br>  <br>  I can't really recommend any books; the best thing to do is to just go to a library and see what books have the information you want the most. Some will focus on the composer's lives for their own sakes. Some will focus more on the music. Some will focus on the composer as he reflected his society. Some will focus on a broad variety of composers from the same aesthetic. Just 30 minutes at a library can yield some very nice books.|`|025wasRZaa	Um...er...<br>  <br>  Internet, maybe?|`|hlN8AZuAaa	sono daccordo con quella che ha risposto prima, la wikipedia è la migliore, lo faccio anch'io, poi però se hai dei cd originali ci sono moltissime informazioni nel libretto in copertina...<br>  ah, la musica classica!<br>  ciaociao

k32sOHLgaa	It's not a bad thing in itself. However from her vampire parents point of view it looks strange that she is actually helping people by doing that, and that she depresses the urge to suck blood from other people. Either then that Karin herself doesn't want to suck blood from people (she contradict herself as a vampire) and thus think what she is doing is bad even if it turns out to help people.

SfKJKFPzaa	I think I know what episode you're talking about, but it's not in season 5 or 6.  It's the episode called "Who are You" in season 4.  Also, Buffy wasn't drunk when she was dirty dancing with Riley or talking to Spike.  It was Faith in Buffy's body.|`|XNfjaPaSaa	I'm not sure, but there was never an episode titled "Help" in the seasons where Riley was around, which were seasons 4 and 5, with one appearance in season 6.

Can you give a little more detail?|`|S68v9i4Naa	She wears a black tank top and red leather pants when she has her "final" faceoff with Faith in the Season 3 finale "Graduation Day part 1).

WLwMKsMZaa	Because, Heath Ledger was a talented actor who had his life cut short once he really got to spread his wings. He got a chance, but he could've done so much more if he lived.<br>  <br>  I also hear he was a good person to know.<br>  <br>  Don't get me wrong. We don't admire him just because he died. If he had lived to see the Dark Knight premiere, people would still be praising his performance.<br>  <br>  Edit: For all of you saying he commited suicide, NO he did not.

Keep taking voice lessons and you'll see it start to come into your singing.|`|kAvgkLxPaa	Like Kay said, there's no specific timeframe in which you will get vibrato. It's different for every individual. Keep at the lessons and practices, take care of your voice and don't torture it, and it will eventually come with age and experience.
dYDHHxzraa	Yes..Schecters are very good for the money you can get a dubble dimond or a hell razor for around 400 US.  Also look at the Epiphone LesPauls you can pick up one of those or a Epiphone SG G-400 for about 400 US. those are all great guitars.  The Ibanez RG GT42MDX is an amazing guitar it might hit a little above the 400 mark but its worth it.|`|PeuFnqQwaa	Look at the Schecters..... They are an Excellent Value for the $$$. I think they start around $250 and go up from there. Ther get great reviews. I own one and love it.

RetVJj8Oaa	I love you for saying the word "buy". You deserve a hug.<br>  <br>  I hope that doesn't mean you prefer to watch dub though, because the anime I was going to suggest was CLANNAD, and it hasn't been dubbed yet. So you can watch the fansubs by the lovely Sprocket Hole Subs, and then when it comes out in America (it's been liscened by ADV films, just not dubbed yet.) you can buy it. ^^<br>  <br>  The art style is fabulous, and when something's by Visual Art's/Key, you know it's plots are amazing. And I just can't get enough of the music! So this show seems pretty good for you, once you get passed the annoying harem crap.<br>  <br>  This next one I shall mention is Jigoku Shoujo (liscenced as Hell Girl by Funimation.) The art style is very nice! And the music as well! As for the plot, I'd have to say it's in the eye of the beholder. It totally depends on the person watching it. You either hate it or you love it. o.<|`|poPtRqouaa	if u watch inyuasha, i admit it was good, but it doesnt have an ending<br>  <br>  not sure if dragon ball z (or other series) of it is anime, but that was my favorite cartoon ever|`|SyKtEcncaa	Noir|`|hFgXi9cSaa	Then Meloncholy of Haruhi suzamiya<br>  Lucky star<br>  Fruits basket-T_T always wuvs u<br>  <br>  those are some i can name of teh top of my head rit now|`|8yE2sYGeaa	Music is a question.<br>  <br>  I promote mahoromatic, as i think it has all three, but that is what I like.|`|XZiABvdgaa	Watch Beck.<br>  <br>  Beck is a phenomenal slice of life drama about teens and rock bands.  All original music and a fantastic story.<br>  <br>  I would also suggest FLCL, since it features the always awesome music of The Pillows.  Its very short and easy to watch.  Also its available in English with a very good dub. (I tend to be a strictly subtitle only fan.  Very few dubs are passable.)|`|8ouVqW0Uaa	Cowboy Bebop is considered to have the GREATEST soundtrack by most anime-fans.

fffdacb95231c06c170621e811739692aa	There's nothing wrong with you, and you're not the first to have noticed this.<br>  <br>  I am appalled that the Jonas Brothers and Miley Cyrus/Hannah Montana are allowed to become celebrities when their songs are so cliche and tasteless, but they cater to children and preteens (Disney Channel), and I suppose they're contractually obliged by Disney to produce and promote the trash that they represent. The only thing is, I fear for the next generation, but hey, they'll grow up sometime and move on to better tunes.<br>  <br>  As for Britney Spears, even though she is talentless, she at least manages to entertain people. That's her job: an entertainer. Yes, she reduces music, a life-changing beauty, to mere entertainment, but at least she admits it.<br>  <br>  Metro Station...I haven't heard their songs, but I think they mainly appeal to teens too.<br>  <br>  Good music changes the world, and is subjective to its definition. People just want catchy tunes now.<br>  <br>  What do we do about it? Wait it out. Those people aren't going to go away...Britney Spears was 90s pop and hey look, it's nearing 2010 and she's still here. They're like flies.<br>  <br>  Just remember that despite their ticket and chart sales, there are far better artists out there, and as the listener, you at least get to pick what you get to hear.<br>  <br>  So just listen to whatever you want...there's not much you can do about the kiddy dance-pop/imitation rap fluff out there except to just ignore it.|`|526ecb0ada8ac2e5c1f389c6b5600112aa	Jonas Brothers and Hannah Montana sucks! they're disney channel muppets hahahahaha xD! <br>  <br>  Metro Station is the only passable in your ''music''|`|cOodF1a1aa	Because it has no meaning or passion in the songs try bands like i dunno Alice In Chains!!

YHu0TUxdaa	That video was one of the first trailers released for it thou that perticular scene isn't in the movie. And secondly the second naruto shippuuden movie was already released in japan It hit theaters August 2 2008.  And it is called bonds and features sasuke|`|M8qLP7MLaa	That clip in the trailer and what you seen with the dragon is the same movie, the clip that is used for that trailer just wasn't used in the actual movie.<br>  <br>  And yes, there is a second Naruto Shippuden movie called Bonds, but that isn't it.

2k8TEiRtaa	get a copy of " Songwriters Market " there is the place to send your stuff to. They are basically indie labels. But that's how most people get their start. They are looking for talent . They specify what they want and in which genre. Do a Demo as suggested and send everyone who might be interested. So, your young. That much better for you. Don't bother sending to the big labels, they always say "no unsolicited material". And just send it back.|`|PeuFnqQwaa	There is no EASY way. It takes lots of hard work, practice, networking etc. Your best bet would be to try and get to know some people who are in the industry and ask them for guidance and advice. Attend as many music functions and Galas as you can. You want to create a network of people in the industry and/or connections to people in it. It can be a long hard road....One that you may not get to the end of. Dig your feet in a prepare yourself. If you want it bad enough, you will get it.<br>  <br>  Good Luck !!!! :)  Hope your dream comes true..|`|fMfBAgOUaa	Record a demo of your stuff and put it on a bunch of cds, and send them to a bunch of record labels, radio stations etc. If they like it, they will let you know.

NrOuDXW4aa	Part of the problem might be that British actors in general have been trained as actors and worked there way up the ranks whilst the US seems to be besotted with using models and singers that look good instead of using real actors.<br>  <br>  Your complaint about Brits playing Americans shows a short memory, the list of major movies where Americans have played foreigners would be too long to print on this forum.  You only have to look at Valkyrie where Americans and Brits play germans in a story that is entirely about German events.<br>  <br>  Yes just like you the Brits would complain if an American did play Churchill or Queen Vic though I didn't hear much complaining when Cate Blanchett not a Brit though not American either played Queen Liz.|`|d55D0Ci4aa	No, if the movie is good, and the part is played well, I don't really care if they are from England or Australia or Ireland. I am more interested in being able to see a good movie, than who the actors are.  However, I do have favorite actors, americans, Australians, Irish, etc...and if I know they are going to be in a movie, I will generally watch it whether I think it sounds good or not....I think alot of people are like that.|`|uGn0FyWwaa	You're a dumb f u c k.|`|QMYNDtHgaa	Well let's take a look at Great American Actors.  I guess after tonight Sean Penn comes to mind.  That would be it wouldn't it?  Let me think harder..nothing yet, Denzel Washington, there yah go.  He is American.  <br>  <br>  British Actors see there craft as a profession while the American mentality of acting is I wanna Be Famous.|`|b2bMy1EAaa	Well I'm Scottish and enjoyed 'Braveheart' even when it is historically inaccurate, William Wallace is played by an Australian and it was filmed in Ireland. It's just entertainment, whoever does, wherever they do it makes no difference to me.

The constitution is the only thing that keeps our freedom alive. and when people take it as a joke our freedom will soon disappear thanks to the govt. I am all for right to bear arms. everyone has the right to have a gun in their house to protect themselves! by the way f*u*c*k CNN news and their false reports!! I love that guy!!|`|nooi0ldjaa	if you get rid of the right to bear arms, you get right of the ability to keep your rights.<br>  <br>  a armed nation is a feared one. even by its own government.|`|atJxwFssaa	Unless a Govt. can guarantee protection to all, I think everyone should have the right to bear arms.

Why? Would there have been a Revolutionary War if no one in the 13 colonies had a rifle? As a fundamental right to the establishment of a balance of power between "We the People..." and the government established by the People, it is an indispensable part of our society's heritage.<br>  <br>  The control on weapons is foolish and naive. In banning weapons that the government deems unnecessary for common defense, it uses several basic arguments:<br>  * gun control reduces violent crime<br>  * gun control reduces accidental gun deaths related to gun ownership<br>  * gun control makes society safer by removing guns from the society<br>  <br>  The problem is that all of the assertions used to argue against the individuals right to keep and bear arms is false. In countries where there are strict gun control laws, violent crime is actually higher. Police officers in these countries are armed with submachine guns, because the only civilians with guns are very violent offenders.<br>  <br>  Because practically no civilians are armed, an armed criminal has an extremely high statistical probability of having a tactical advantage over almost anyone they choose to attack. Criminals intent on committing a violent crime or intent on committing nonviolent crimes do not concern themselves with whether or not having a gun or not having a gun is a criminal offense.<br>  <br>  Without a weapon, they would have a lot of difficulty committing a crime. Harsh language and rude hand gestures are hardly and advantage in a criminal altercation. A gun or a knife, however, gives the assailant a distinct advantage. Ergo, the criminal is much more likely to succeed at what he intends to do (commit a crime) if he is armed and his intended target is not.<br>  <br>  If a criminal has to take into consideration that half of the populace of a given country is likely armed in some fashion, then the criminal in a society where people are legally empowered to keep and bear arms now has to take something into consideration that he doesn't have to in nations that remove a person's ability to keep and bear arms. In the act of committing a crime, he is likely to be killed or be forced into an armed confrontation that will require him to discharge his weapon, and thus possibly commit a greater crime than what he is intending. Ergo: a thief may not want to become a murderer, so he will not be a thief.<br>  <br>  In an unarmed populace, it's possible for an organized political movement to quickly quash free people. If the Germans were armed, would Hitler's Brown Shirts been able to burn down the Reichstag and thus paralyze German government? We'll never know.<br>  <br>  **EDIT**<br>  Only naive fools believe that you can just wipe guns off the face of the earth through legislation. If you illegalize guns, all of the law abiding citizens would be forced to turn in their guns or hide their guns. That would necessarily mean that the largest percentage of civilian owned guns would be in the hands of NON-LAW-ABIDING CITIZENS (aka: criminals). Great, so now the thugs are the only ones with guns.<br>  <br>  Peace and prosperity.|`|ENnO8ga4aa	not for crazy ppl that end up shooting their wife or best friend when they're drunk. they shoul take a crazy test before having that right. and put them in a safe or somewhere high where the kids cant get to them ppl. that's how alot of them have ended up shooting themselves accidentally. and some teens comit suicide. i would say most of the time the arms are used for something else rather than self defense. but if ur gonna be responsible about it, then yea it would be good cuz you never know when you might need it and it can save your life in a house robbery or something. or to go hunting (even though im against hunting).|`|0VHatv2Naa	if they take away the 2nd amendment when will they take the 1st amendment away and control our speech.<br>  i like the whole constitution i dont want obama to burn it at a rally like the nazis burned books and people.|`|a5KpcodFaa	I believe we have that right and it should not be messed with.

Why shouldn't we be able to own a gun?|`|dGiYVfw6aa	I think it's a good right. I hear stories all the time about people being murdered in their own homes. If someone breaks into your house in the middle of the night it's nice to be able to protect yourself because the police are going to take at least 10 minutes to get there.  And I agree with the NRA guy about the CNN story. Their footage had fully automatic machine guns in the video. I went to the gun range today and that place was very crowded. Men women and children shooting. There was a waiting list to get on a lane. I had to wait an hour before I could shoot. So apparently there are many Americans who like the right to have guns. If Obama takes that right away there will be a LOT of mad Americans.<br>  <br>  Patrick. Only little pansies don't like other people to be able to have guns. if you take the guns away from law abiding citizens only criminals will have guns. You see criminals don't tend to care about what the law says. And I'm not a red neck, A S S HOLE! There were a lot of people in that gun range I went to today. And I live in an upscale neighborhood in the 4th largest metro area in the United States. Not a lot of red necks there.|`|CmJwqeJ5aa	hmmm i prefer bare arms  ohhh wrong answer..I dont think EVERYONE should have a right some people are crazy as hell  and should not have the right.<br>  ***ADDING ON***<br>  Guns don't kill people.PEOPLE kill people usually because of stong emotions like jealousy or rage... gun safety and sanity tests(although anyone can lose it for a moment some people are a little more obvious or more likely to be unstable)Guns dont have the emotions that  lead to shootings|`|c0p2BYwnaa	I happen to be watching "Bowling For Columbine" on the IFC channel<br>  I believe that people should be able to legally defend their household.|`|AA11036219	It was put there as a right for us to protect ourselves and to over throw our own government if necessary.|`|U7d3Ft9baa	I do not like arms at all|`|N6aJoqTwaa	I think that it is Great !

OWk5POwVaa	I totally disagree with the douche bag above me!  I'm a white woman and color has nothing to do with the absolutely hysterical nature of Tyler Perry's movies!  Madea goes to jail is SO FUNNY and I watched it twice.  It's definitely worth it.  Tyler Perry has haters just like every successful person in the world - but that's not my M.O., so yes, I would go see it if I were you!  It's great.  It also has a good story behind the jokes, as we've come to expect from Perry's movies.  :o)|`|KVO4GpFcaa	its a movie with an old black lady that says stereotypical old black lady stuff like "oh hell nah!" tyler perry needs to be executed for the crap he keeps putting out. every other week something new comes out called tyler perrys this or tyler perrys that. he isnt writing all this crap they are just putting his name on it cause they know that black people for some reason think that they are required to see any new tyler perry project that comes out. i want to meet a black person that thinks tyler perry sucks.oh by the way. you should never see this movie its a waste of 2 hours of your life.

El narrador es "Buscapé", un joven ***** de-masiado frágil y tímido para una vida criminal pero con suficiente talento como para tener éxito como artista y fotógrafo.

06f0b6516fffc4eae3c24abbc4a74c25aa	Posso dirti questo: il mio primo maestro diceva che la chitarra è lo strumento più facile da suonare, e il più difficile da suonare bene. Parere discutibile nella seconda parte, ma una cosa è certa: la chitarra (e gli strumenti musicali in genere) non è come andare in palestra; in palestra ci puoi andare due o tre volte a settimana e va benissimo, la chitarra la devi suonare TUTTI i giorni (o almeno 6 su 7).<br>  Se ti accontenti di "strimpellare", puoi comprare un quaderno di accordi e imparare facilmente da solo; se vuoi "suonare" è diverso.<br>  La tecnica dello strumento è estremamente stancante perché monotona: 24 scale diatoniche per 7 diteggiature da moltiplicare per due "tocchi"; "glissati", "legati" e "ottave cromatiche" tanto per fare degli esempi.

b4de0f92c2afcc784870969dc7a2f447aa	El primer trabajo fue matar al león de Nemea, un animal que no podía herirle ningún arma.En el segundo trabajo mató a la Hidra, que vivía en un pantano en Lerna. Este monstruo tenía nueve cabezas, de la cual una era inmortal y, cuando le cortaban cualquiera de las otras, crecían en su lugar. Hércules quemó cada cuello mortal con una antorcha para impedir que crecieran las cabezas y sepultó la cabeza inmortal bajo una roca. Después empapo sus flechasen en la sangre de la Hidra para envenenarlas.El tercer trabajo impuesto fue capturar viva a una cierva con cuernos de oro y pezu?as de bronce que estaba consagrada a ártemis, diosa de la caza.El cuarto trabajo consistía en cazar a un gran jabalí cuya guarida estaba en el monte Erimanto.El quinto trabajo Hércules tuvo que limpiar en un día la suciedad acumulada durante treinta a?os por miles de reba?os establos de Augias. Desafió el cauce de dos ríos, haciendo que corrieran por los establos.En el sexto trabajo apartó una enorme bandada de aves de picos, garras y alas de bronce que vivían junto al lago Estínfalo y atacaban a las gentes del lugar, y devastaban sus campos y cosechas.En el séptimo trabajo Hércules entrego a Euristeo un toro furioso que Poseidón había enviado para aterrorizar a Creta.En el octavo trabajo para recuperar a las yeguas de Diomedes, rey de Trancia, que se alimentaba de carne humana, Hércules capturó al rey, se lo ofreció como alimento a las yeguas y después las condujo hacia Micenas.En el noveno trabajo Hipólita, reine de las amazonas, deseaba ayudar a Hércules en su noveno trabajo. Cuando Hipólita estaba apunto de dar a Hércules su cinturón, que Euristeo quería para su hija, Hera dijo a las amazonas que Hércules intentaba raptar a la reina y estas lo atacaron. Entonces el héroe mató a Hipólita, creyendo que era responsable del consiguiente ataque, y escapo llevándose el cinturón. En su camino a la isla de Eritia para capturar los bueyes de Gerión, el monstruo de tres cabezas, Hércules erigió dos grandes columnas( los pe?ones de Gibraltar y de Ceuta, que bordean ahora el estrecho de Gibraltar, y que se representan en la ciudad de Cádiz) como monstruos conmemorativos de su haza?a. Después que Hércules llevara los bueyes, fue a buscar las manzanas de oro de las hespérides pero como no sabia dónde estaban esas manzanas, pidió ayuda a Atlas, padre de las hespérides. Atlas accedió a ayudarlo si Hércules, sostenía el mundo sobre sus hombros, mientras él conseguía las manzanas.El último y más difícil trabajo de Hércules fue capturar a Cerbero, el perro de los infiernos. Hades, dios de los muertos, dio permiso a Hércules para llevarse el animal siempre que no usara armas. Hércules capturó a Cerbero, lo llevó a Micenas y lo devolvió a Hades.<br>  La sociedad derrotada: El desorden mexicano del fin de siglo.De Sergio Zerme?o - 1996 .<br>  Juan de Mal Lara, su vida y sus obras. 1941.<br>  Misoginia y defensa de las mujeres: Antología de textos medievales.De Robert Archer - Social Science - 2001.

La mato untandole las cabezas cortadas con cera y una antorcha d fuego, para q no puedieran volver a crecer (las cabezas)<br>  <br>  3. alcanzar a la cierva de cerinia: el animal sería consagrado a la diosa artemis, pero la cierva era muy veloz y no le fue fácil atraparla, por lo que la persiguió hasta el país de los hiperbóreos. allí la capturó mientras ésta tomaba agua<br>  <br>  4. capturar al jabali de erimanto: era una criatura que vivía en erimanto, un monte de la arcadia y la élide.<br>  <br>  5. limpiar los establos de augías: eran conocidos sus establos, que nunca habían sido limpiados. se le encargó esta extra?a misión con el fin de humillarle y ridiculizarle, pues era tal era la cantidad de excrementos acumulados en los establos que era prácticamente imposible limpiarlos en un sólo día, pero el heroe lo consiguio.<br>  <br>  6. acabar con los pájaros del lago estínfalo: eran unas aves con plumaje de bronce que poblaban la región y el bosque alrededor del lago estínfalo. le mandaron a hercules que acabase con la amenaza de dichas aves ya que en ocasiones atacaban al ganado o a la población. hercules espanto a las aves con un cascabel q le habia dado atenea, asi las asusto.<br>  <br>  7. domar al toro de creta: toro salvaje que expulsaba fuego por sus narices y que causaba estragos en creta. hercules consiguió subir a lomos del animal y lo condujo hasta micenas.<br>  <br>  8. robar las yeguas del rey diomedes (este trabajo fue anulado)<br>  <br>  9. vencer a las amazonas y tomar el cinturon de hipólita: eran una antigua nación legendaria de guerreras o un país contemporáneo poblado por mujeres en los confines del mundo. hipólita es la reina amazona, due?a de un cinturón mágico que le había regalado su padre, ares, el dios de la guerra. En una versión de la historia, hipólita se enamoraba de hercules y le daba el cinturón voluntariamente. de acuerdo con otra hercules obtenía el cinturón secuestrando a la hermana de hipólita, melanipa, y exigiendo el cinturón como rescate, y liberándola tras conseguirlo.<br>  <br>  10. matar al gerion y robarle los reba?os: era un monstruoso gigante alado hijo de crisaor y calírroe. llamado también gritón, estaba formado por tres cuerpos humanos completos unidos por la cintura. fue muerto por hercules cuando después de una de sus misiones éste le robó su reba?o de vacas rojas y bueyes. gerión fue en busca de venganza, pero cuando sobrevolaba a hercules, éste, oculto, le disparó una flecha envenenada con la sangre de la hidra que atravesó sus tres cuerpos.<br>  <br>  11. robar las manzanas de oro del jardin de las Espérides: hercules capturó primero a nereo, el dios del mar que cambiaba de forma, para averiguar dónde estaba situado el jardín. hercules enga?ó a atlas para que recuperase algunas manzanas de oro ofreciéndose a sujetar el cielo mientras iba a buscarlas, al volver con las manzanas, atlas decidió no aceptar la devolución de los cielos, pero hercules le enga?ó de nuevo pidiéndole que sujetase el cielo un momento para que pudiera ponerse su capa como almohadilla sobre los hombros, a lo que éste accedio. entonces hercules tomó las manzanas y se marchó.<br>  <br>  12. sacar al can cerbero de los infiernos y llevarlo ante euristeo: el can cerbero era el perro guardian de las puertas del infierno y animal de hades. en algunas versiones, hercules simplemente pidió permiso a hades para llevarse a cerbero, a lo que éste accedió siempre que hercules no hiciera da?o al perro, pero en otras versiones hercules disparó una flecha a hades. tras esto, en algunas versiones hercules luchó con el perro y lo arrastró fuera del hades, pero en otras hercules trató con amabilidad al fiero perro por primera vez, y éste le acompa?ó afuera dócilmente.|`|a19b10ee33aa04cf2904be8da26488a4aa	ajajajajaja, yo pensaba k trataba de otra cosa, te iva a poner, no pues levantar rocas y piedras por su fuerza jejeje, ese trabajo se me ocurre, che hercules alomejor era un flojo como yo, jjejejejeje.|`|a2c8bbb24610178840fdeb550558efe6aa	En los 12 trabajos de Hércules, están descritos arquetipicamente los 12 signos del zodiaco...Son 12 mitos distintos para explicar el comportamiento humano de cada signo.<br>  <br>  El arquetipo representa una forma de ser que se considera modelo de cualquier manifestación de la realidad...entonces cada trabajo de Hércules manifiesta una forma típica de actuar para cada signo...|`|d2013c944f29599fb3898bdeed7e07d0aa	Los 12 trabajos de Hércules<br>  <br>  El verdadero nombre de Hércules era Heracles que quiere decir “gloria de Hera”, la diosa que tanto lo odió, y por cuya causa hubo de correr tantos peligros y realizar tan increíbles proezas.<br>  <br>  Hércules era hijo del mismo Zeus que había enga?ado a Alcmena (madre de Hércules) tomando la figura de éste.<br>  <br>  Así pues Hércules había heredado la fuerza prodigiosa de su padre, Zeus.<br>  <br>  Cuando Hércules era bebé y dormía en su cuna, Hera (la celosa esposa de Zeus) le puso dos serpientes para que le mataran pero Hércules las estranguló con sus propias manos.<br>  <br>  Cuando Hércules creció y Hera vertió en su copa un veneno que lo enloqueció y, tan loco se volvió, que mató a su mujer y sus propios hijos confundiéndolos con enemigos.<br>  <br>  Zeus obligó a Hera que devolviera la razón a Hércules pero Hércules fue castigado por matar a su familia (aunque la verdadera culpa fue de Hera) a servir de esclavo durante 12 duros a?os a su primo Euristeo, rey de Micenas.<br>  <br>  éste que quería quitárselo de encima le mando los “doce trabajos de Hércules”.<br>  <br>  El león de Nemea<br>  <br>  Primer trabajo de Hércules. Euristeo le ordenó que diera muerte al león de Nemea, una fiera con piel dura como una piedra y que por de día se escondía y por la noche mataba a todo ser viviente que se cruzaba por su camino.<br>  <br>  Hércules intentó matarlo con algunas armas que llevaba para la ocasión pero, viendo que éstas no hacían ningún efecto, lo cogió por las patas traseras y, después de darle porrazos contra la pared hasta que quedó atontado, lo estranguló y una vez muertos le sacó la piel con las propias garras del cadáver y se la puso encima en forma de coraza.<br>  <br>  La hidra de Lerna<br>  <br>  Segundo trabajo de Hércules. Debía matar a la hidra de Lerna; un monstruo con cuerpo de serpiente, garras de dragón y dorso cubierto con duras escamas, y tenía siete cabezas, cuyas siete bocas vomitaban fuego y azufre. Una de las cabezas tenía láminas de oro y se decía que era inmortal.<br>  <br>  Hércules le cortó una cabeza pero ésta se regeneró y la sangre que manaba al caer al suelo se convertía en escorpiones y serpientes.<br>  <br>  Hércules le pidió a su sobrino que prendiera fuego al bosque más cercano y le pidió que trajera tizones llameantes que aplicó a las heridas abiertas en los cuellos de la bestia para que así no salieran más cabezas. Al final quedó la cabeza de oro que con un espadazo cortó e inmediatamente la enterró bajo una inmensa roca para impedirle reto?ar.<br>  <br>  El jabalí de Erimanto<br>  <br>  Tercer trabajo de Hércules. Debía apresar pero sin matar al jabalí de Erimanto.<br>  <br>  Cuando iba en busca de éste se le apareció Atenea que le dio una cadena. Cuando vió al jabalí refocilándose en un charco de agua, le lanzó un grito de desafío y echó a correr como si tuviera miedo del animal monte arriba hasta fatigar al jabalí. Aprovechando el desconcierto del animal saltó sobre su lomo, logró trabar sus patas y su hocico con la cadena que le dio Atenea y lo cargó sobre su espalda. Al llevárselo a Euristeo, éste se metió corriendo en una tinaja cagado de miedo y le dijo que se lo llevara de allí.<br>  <br>  La cierva de Cerínia<br>  <br>  Cuarto trabajo de Hércules. Debía apresar a la cierva de Cerínia, extra?o y hermoso animal, del tama?o de un buey, tenía los cuernos de oro y las pezu?as de bronce, estaba consagrada a ártemis y nadie podía matarla, ni siquiera tocarla. La cierva de Cerínia era muy ágil y corría a una velociadad asombrosa.<br>  <br>  Hércules estuvo persiguiéndola cerca de un a?o y una tarde en que la cierva, exhausta y sedienta, se detuvo a beber en el río, Hércules la hirió levemente con una flecha y entonces le resultó fácil capturarla.<br>  <br>  Cuando la llevaba para ense?ársela a Euristeo se le apareció Artemis y su hermano Apolo que lo acusaron de querer dar muerte al animal pero Hércules se disculpó endosándole la responsabilidad de aquel acto impío a Euristeo.<br>  <br>  Euristeo, al ver a Hércules con la cierva cautiva se echó las manos a la cabeza.<br>  <br>  Los establos de Augías<br>  <br>  Quinto trabajo de Hércules. Debía limpiar los establos de Augías, rey de la élide.<br>  <br>  Augías pensó que Hércules estaba loco y le dijo que si los limpiaba en un día recibiría en recompensa la décima parte de los reba?os.<br>  <br>  Hércules encauzó dos ríos que dirigió hacia los establos, en los que previamente hizo dos boquetes; uno en un costado por el que penetró el caudal y otro en el costado opuesto que sirvió de desagüe. En pocas horas las cuadras resplandecían como espejos.<br>  <br>  Augías no cumplió lo pactado alegando que Hércules realizó la proeza por orden de Euristeo. Llevado a juicio, Fileo, su propio hijo declaró a favor de Hércules, pues había sido testigo del pacto. Augías enfurecido desterró de su reino a Fileo y a Hércules. Al poco tiempo, Hércules al mando de un ejército lo depuso y colocó en el trono a Fileo.<br>  <br>  El toro de Creta<br>  <br>  Sexto trabajo de Hércules. Debía de capturar el toro de Creta, un animal muy hermoso.<br>  <br>  Hércules fue en busca del toro y, tras un breve forcejeo, lo agarró por los cuernos, se lo cargó en la espalda y se lo llevó vivo a Euristeo, el cual al ver al animal, corrió a meterse en la tinaja y le dijo a Hércules que se lo llevara de allí.<br>  <br>  Las aves del lago Estínfalo<br>  <br>  Séptimo trabajo de Hércules. Euristeo esta vez le mandó a Hércules liberar la ciudad de Estínfalo de las aves que se guarecen en un bosque cercano al lago. Son una multitud de aves terribles, con picos, garras y plumas de bronce, que devoran las cosechas e incluso a las personas.<br>  <br>  Cuando Hércules llegó a Estínfalo sin muchas ilusiones de poder llevar a término su trabajo se le apareció Atenea que le entregó unas grandes casta?uelas de bronce.<br>  <br>  Hércules subió a una colina y tocó las casta?uelas con lo cual las aves se fueron de allí.<br>  <br>  Cuando regresó a Micenas para darle cuenta a Euristeo del cumplimiento de su misión vio que algunas aves de Estínfalo sobrevolaban el palacio de Euristeo, el cual, horrorizado estaba escondido en la tinaja, diciendo: - Decidle a ese insensato que se lleve de aquí a esos malditos pájaros.<br>  <br>  Y, como Hercules aún no había devuelto las casta?ulas a Atenea, las tocó y los pájaros se marcharon.<br>  <br>  Las yeguas de Diomedes<br>  <br>  Octavo trabajo de Hércules. Esta vez Euristeo ordenó a Hércules que le llevara las cuatro yeguas de Diomedes que comían carne humana. Hércules consiguió arrebatárselas a Diomedes, que furioso fue con su ejército a matar a Hércules pero Hércules lo mató a el y su ejercito huyó.<br>  <br>  Cuando le ense?ó las yeguas a Euristeo, éste se metió en su tinaja y le dio orden de que las soltara.<br>  <br>  Se dice que las yeguas murieron en el monte olimpo devoradas pro las fieras y las alima?as.<br>  <br>  El cinturón de Hipólita<br>  <br>  Noveno trabajo de Hércules. Debía conseguir el cinturón de Hipólita por lo que fue a Temiscira, el país de las Amazonas. Cuando llegó, Hipólita le dio la bienvenida y lo invitó a pasar unos días ya que lo admiraba.<br>  <br>  Hera, que estaba furiosa hizo correr la voz de que Hércules había raptado a Hipólita pero al final todo se aclaró e Hipólita entregó el cinturón a Hércules y éste se lo dio a Euristeo.<br>  <br>  Los bueyes de Gerión<br>  <br>  Décimo trabajo de Hércules. Esta vez debía buscar al gigante Gerión, darle muerte y robarle sus ganados. Gerión era un gigante de 3 cuerpos unidos por el vientre. Tenía al cuidado de su gran reba?o a un perro de dos cabezas hermano del Can Cerbero, el guardián de los infiernos. Cuando llegó le salió al encuentro el perro de 2 cabezas al que Hércules abatió a mazazos. Después salió el gigante Gerión al que Hércules abatió con certeros flechazos.<br>  <br>  Hércules emprendió el camino de regreso llevando consigo los reba?os de Gerión. El camino fue fatigoso y perdió algunos bueyes.<br>  <br>  Las manzanas de oro<br>  <br>  Undécimo trabajo de Hércules. Euricles le ordenó a Hércules que robara las mazanas de oro del Jardín de las Hespérides. Estas manzanas pertenecían a Hera y estaban custodiadas por un dragón de 3 cabezas. Hercules tras superar varios peligros consiguió llegar al jardín, matar al dragón y llevarse las manzanas.<br>  <br>  Al entregárselas a Euristeo le dijo que provocaría la cólera de los dioses por lo que Euristeo las rechazó. Hércules se las entregó a Atenea y ella las volvió a poner donde estaban.<br>  <br>  El Can Cerbero<br>  <br>  Duodécimo y último trabajo de Hércules. Esta vez y para quitárselo definitivamente de encima le ordenó que le trajera al Can Cerbero que custodiaba las puertas del infierno.<br>  <br>  El Can Cerbero era un perro monstruoso de tres cabezas y cola de serpiente.<br>  <br>  Hércules lo venció con sus propias manos y se lo llevó vivo ante Euristeo.<br>  <br>  Cuando Euristeo lo vio llegar se metió corriendo en su tinaja y le dio la libertad a Hércules, el cual, volvió a poner al Can Cerbero en la puerta del infierno, el lugar que le correspondía.|`|db967d65039f971d78e4a2f4794ac3b6aa	Pues yo opino que cualquier semejanza es pura casualidad

So por curiosidade, fui num casamento ortodoxico que durou quase 4h foi um martírio...ninguem merece.;;beijos

8Mi15cTtaa	I didn't see either movie but I hate Sean Penn and his traitorous actions in meeting with Chavez in Venezuela.<br>  <br>  Sean Penn should have kept politics out of the Oscars. His comments were insulting. I will never go to a Sean Penn movie!!!|`|YmEGCGtnaa	i didnt see any of those but i can tell from the previews he shoudlve won|`|qdPtCBJeaa	I've only seen clips from both movies...I admit that I was crossing fingers for Mickey...being the comeback kid and all....<br>  but if he had to lose to anyone I'm glad it was Penn.<br>  He was gracious for saluting Rourke...|`|sICqdaDzaa	Brad Pitt deserved it more than both.|`|IqhD4JCCaa	nope,Rourke did deserve it "Wrestler" greatest movie i ever seen|`|XxVTw5U3aa	yes he should have got it|`|FdNYv4D9aa	I DEFINITELY think Mickey was screwed, and although I've not seen Milk, I won't bother to see Milk either, for the simple fact that I already KNOW what a subpar actor Sean Penn is and the fact that Mickey more than deserved the Best Actor award. I'm glad I didn't watch it last night. And I saw Brad in Benjamin Button, and that movie was VASTLY OVERRATED and as usual, Pitt showed me just how MEDIOCRE and UNCONVINCING of an actor he is..not to mention cheesy.<br>  <br>  2008 best films were Dark Knight and The Wrestler..yet third-rate, overrated subpar media favorites like Slumdog Millionaire, Milk, and Benjamin Button received the awards..typical Hollywood.|`|hu8o4vomaa	They were both great performances. The only thing is Milk was an actual person and it can be difficult to play a person people know. Also the Oscar are political and I thin Penn might have more friends out there.|`|3c13db451102c43a3042e283a0160e86aa	I haven't seen either of them, but from past acting, I would pick Mickey.  I have never thought Penn was that great of an actor.  He got such rave reviews for Mystic River, but i didn't think he was that good.<br>  Never have.|`|FiUDqsrLaa	I Didn't see either movie. But based on what I know about them: It would be harder for a straight man to play a gay man than it would be for a wrestler to play a wrestler.|`|cH3l3myKaa	Yes. I actually do... Sean Penn's performance was believable and amazing...but so was Rourkes...both were brilliant in their performance but the outcome didnt surprise me|`|fETbCVXbaa	penn deserved it|`|YrJYc79oaa	Brad Pitt deserved it waaay more than him|`|AA10897020	i like penn.
XTDeAfTqaa	Yeah. Sean Penn is cool. Anyone who thinks Hugo Chavez is a great man is OK in my book.<br>  <br>  JK. Sean Penn is a Knob!|`|5dc6493b424c85096e22e1614be3c9daaa	I was expecting Mickey botch face mouse to win, but Seann was awesome too|`|QMYNDtHgaa	Sean Penn deserved to win for portraying Harvey Milk as a perfect individual with no problems or qualms...no wait that isn't good acting?  hmmmmm...well it was a token political win and to say that Sean Penn doesn't deserve praise for acting would be a lie to.  Praise for Milk?  Not really, I think he was "meh" but heck I've seen real footage of Milk and I always have a hard time watching people imitate real life people.  I'm very critical on that, apparently the academy isn't.  His performance in Mystic River was brilliant and deserving but this just seems like they wanted a guy who would go on and on and on about Gay Marriage Rights. <br>  <br>  Clearly his convictions towards marriage are strong, that's why he thanked his wife Robin.   What?  He didn't?|`|9wblT5sYaa	I was thrilled to see Sean Penn win, he deserves it<br>  <br>  I just would have liked to have seen mickey make his speech, you can only imagine what he would have said.  probably mention his dogs about ten times|`|4x2KMVbBaa	I'm glad Penn won this one since Mickey won the other one. They're both good actors, but I think Penn has always done more and better movies for sure.|`|qUZjnsWOaa	If Mickey Rourke won it would have been one of the best comeback stories ever but Sean Penn deserved to win|`|uJFXbHA7aa	The truth in the matter is in the fact that "Milk" was nominated for an Oscar.<br>  <br>  The Wrestler" was poorly directed/edited which robbed Mickey of an Oscar.<br>  <br>  Rourke was better than the movie.<br>  <br>  Penn's performance carried the movie to its critical acclaim.|`|WBEfJs2Caa	I would have loved to see Mickey Rourke win, because he was wonderful. But Sean Penn did a fantastic job also. It was for sure either one of those two that were going to win. It was kind of a toss up.|`|62ca1a09937292cf311358116b02a9d1aa	Now I wish I had seen both movies...big controversy brewing between Penn and Rourke. I really don't watch much movies , only the Oscars lol|`|w2Dui70Faa	I was really disappointed that "The Wrestler" got home empty-handed. Mickey Rourke should have won.|`|Cc8MroEDaa	I was hoping that Mickey Rourke won too, saw The Wrestler and thought it was great.|`|6jZcr33paa	They both did good but I thought Rourke did better and I was really rooting for him.|`|miyQcyJFaa	Mickey Rourke was robbed.. Sean Penn's movie was a piece of trash..|`|AA10897020	not really. i wanted penn to win, and he did yay.

2f5f204ea95e4a6c5ae5a8c5f61793f8aa	Ich finde deine Frage spitze und in den anderen Antworten gibt es vieles was hilft.<br>  Meine Frau und ich sind seit 15 Jahren verheiratet und wir haben 5 Kinder. Wir sind gemeinsam durch manche Krisen gegangen.<br>  Wir haben erlebt, dass unser Versprechen, welches wir uns zur Hochzeit gegeben haben - in guten, wie in schlechten Tagen, bis das der Tod uns scheidet - eine Grundlage ist, auf der wir bauen k?nnen. Aber auch das reicht nicht aus.<br>  Wir haben schon im Vorfeld unserer Ehe (Kennenlern und Verlobungszeit) an der Beziehung gearbeitet (Verliebt- und Ehevorbereitungsseminare besucht, vorherige Beziehungen bzw. Pers?nlichkeitsdefiziete aufgearbeitet) gemeinsamen Interessen nachgegangen, versucht realistisch Zukunft zu planen, Streiten zu lernen, Vergeben zu k?nnen, u.a. Und wir sind bis jetzt immer noch am lernen. - Da kommt keine lange Weile auf!<br>  Eine weiter wichtige Grundlage für uns und die Stabilit?t unserer Beziehung ist unser gemeinsamer christlicher Glaube und die Hilfe, die wir für unsere Beziehung durch die Kraft Gottes erleben. <br>  Die Bibel gebraucht das griechische Wort Agape, wenn sie von der Liebe als Grundlage von Beziehungen spricht. Das ist die selbstlose Liebe, die den Anderen h?her stellt als sich selbst - im Gegensatz zur Egoistischen Liebe, die nur Befriedigung für sich selbst sucht.<br>  Auf Grundlage von Agape ist auch alle andere Liebe wie<br>  Eros - erotische Liebe, Sexus - Sexualit?t, Philio - freundschaftliche Liebe ind der gleichen Beziehung drin.<br>  Ich, als Mann, hatte es anf?nglich schwer zu kommunizieren. Aber meine Frau hatte mit mir Gedult - manchmal war sie auch verzweifelt, dass ich es immer noch nicht gerafft hatte, und ihrer Liebe hat mir den Mund ge?ffnet. Jetzt f?llt es mir schon wesendlich leichter über vieles mit ihr zu sprechen.<br>  Au?erdem haben wir gelernt, dass wir unseren Kinder viel mitgegeben k?nnen, damit sie selbst sp?ter f?hig sind, eine gute, lange Beziehung leben k?nnen. <br>  Was unserer Beziehung nicht geschadet hat ist, dass wir beide vor unserer Ehe keine sexuelle Beziehung hatten, weder mit anderen Partner noch gemeinsam. (Zu unserer Hochzeit war ich 28 und meine Frau 26 Jahre!)<br>  Ein wichtiger Aspekt in unserer Ehe, aus dem wir Kraft sch?pfen ist unsere sexuelle Gemeinschaft. Gerade wenn wir einen Konflikt/ Streit u.?. durch Vergebung und Vers?hnung beenden konnten - unser Prinzip ist: lasst die Sonnen nicht untergehen, ehe ihr verzeiht (und da gehts auch manchal die N?chte durch mit Gespr?ch) - fühlen wir uns sehr zueinander hingezogen, was sich dann, wenn m?glich, auch in der sexuellen Gemeinschaft ausdrückt.|`|0de4f69f539d6c77727a87ddbc2bf330aa	Das mu? jeder selbst herausfinden.

Auch Gemeinsamkeiten sind wichtig , wenn  er an 3 Tagen ins Fitness geht, sie an den anderen 3 Tagen zum Yoga und nur am Sonntag bleibt Zeit füreinander dann wird es auch schwierig . Viel gemeinsam machen und trotzdem dem anderen die Freiheit lassen zu sagen : Ich k?nnte ja wenn ich wollte, aber ich mach lieber was mit meinem Partner. Und wenn eine  Partnerschaft gut ist , ist auch der Sex gut, weil man unendliches Vertrauen zueinander hat und sich v?llig frei entfalten kann.Guter Sex allein ist keine Basis , wenn man sich sonst nichts zu sagen hat.<br>  <br>  Ich wünsch Dir ,dass du den Partner für′s Leben findest.<br>  Ich bin froh meinen gefunden zu haben.

AA12005596	O Cruzeiro do Sul<br>  <br>  Luís A. A. Marino<br>  <br>  Presente no emblema do Exército Brasileiro, na Bandeira Nacional e nos pavilh?es de mais 4 países (Austrália, Nova Zelandia, Papua - Nova Guiné e Samoa Ocidental); nome de cidade, de time de futebol e da revista mais lida no Brasil nos anos 60, a constela??o Cruzeiro do Sul, a Cruz Austral — seu nome oficial, em latim, é apenas Crux — é muito conhecida dos povos que, como nós, habitam o Hemisfério Sul da Terra.<br>  <br>  O Cruzeiro do Sul é uma das mais importantes constela??es do firmamento, apesar de ser a menor de todas elas e apesar de ser relativamente recente: apenas no século XVI, com as viagens de Fern?o de Magalh?es e outras Grandes Navega??es portuguesas às regi?es mais ao Sul do Equador esse conjunto de estrelas passou a ter esse nome. A primeira referência a essa constela??o é de Florentino Corsali que em 1515 batizou-a como Cruz Maravilhosa.<br>  <br>  As grandes civiliza??es do passado, das quais somos herdeiros, desenvolveram-se a milhares de anos atrás no hemisfério norte de nosso planeta, próximas ao paralelo de latitude 40o, conhecido como o Paralelo das Civiliza??es. Dessa regi?o, n?o se pode observar as estrelas que se encontram mais próximas do Pólo Celeste Sul, como as do Cruzeiro. Por isso, os gregos antigos, que deram nome a quase todas as outras constela??es do céu, n?o lhes deram muita importancia e nem imaginaram uma constela??o com elas.<br>  <br>  Por volta do mês de junho, no estado de S?o Paulo, pode-se observar facilmente o Cruzeiro do Sul, sempre no início da noite, por volta das 20h, bem alta acima do horizonte Sul.<br>  <br>  Nesse horário, olhando em dire??o ao Sul, mais ou menos uns 45o acima do horizonte, pode-se encontrar facilmente as 5 estrelas do Cruzeiro, com o bra?o maior da cruz praticamente apontando para o Ponto Cardeal Sul.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Além de ser muito importante como ponto de referência celeste para a Navega??o Astron?mica, o Cruzeiro do Sul possui duas estrelas que se encontram entre as mais brilhantes de todo o firmamento.<br>  <br>  A mais brilhante delas, alfa-Crucis, também chamada de Acrux, Magalh?nica ou Estrela de Magalh?es, representa a parte de baixo do bra?o maior da cruz e é a mais próxima do Pólo Celeste Sul.<br>  <br>  A segunda em brilho é beta-Crucis, também chamada Becrux e Mimosa, e representa um dos lados do bra?o menor da cruz.<br>  <br>  A parte de cima do bra?o maior da cruz é representada por gama-Crucis, também chamada Gacrux, uma estrela de cor ligeiramente avermelhada e que, por isso, recebe também o nome de Rubídea.<br>  <br>  O outro lado do bra?o menor da cruz é representado por delta-Crucis, uma estrela bem menos brilhante e que, por isso, recebe também o nome de Pálida.<br>  <br>  Há, ainda, no Cruzeiro, além dessas 4 estrelas, uma quinta estrelinha, épsilon-Crucis, menos brilhante que a Pálida. Por n?o pertencer nem ao bra?o maior e nem ao bra?o menor da cruz, ela é carinhosamente chamada pelos brasileiros de "Intrometida". Na verdade, a Intrometida mais ajuda do que atrapalha, pois facilita a localiza??o do Cruzeiro no céu.<br>  <br>  Bem próximas a constela??o do Cruzeiro do Sul encontram-se, na constela??o do Centauro, duas estrelas de forte brilho, conhecidas como os Guardas da Cruz. A mais brilhante delas, alfa-Centauri — também chamada de Riguel Kentaurus ou Toliman — é a estrela mais próxima da Terra (depois do Sol, é claro).|`|9d43fa95efdaeaaf86d0c3eed965b515aa	Cruz do Norte...|`|2bf03c200973fc356220d12c304d9e95aa	o ser humano de bra?os abertos e de pé? ou deitado de bra?os abertos ?<br>  <br>  será - ou o passarinho voando?|`|NnyySMgZaa	O cristo redentor lá no Rio de Janeiro, voce pode ve-lo da terra e ele tem forma de cruz|`|de23a20bb28332a29d4d9540fea2dd7faa	Todos já sabem é o CRUZEIRO DO SUL!!!<br>  <br>  Falaste em ser benzido?<br>  <br>  O que é isto?<br>  <br>  Onde está escrito esta un??o?<br>  <br>  A CRUZ é símbolo de Maldi??o, pois como está escrito no VT, "Maldito seja todo o que for pendurado no madeiro".<br>  <br>  A humanidade inteira carrega sobre si este estigma de maldi??o - a pesada cruz do pecado, da morte e da impotência de cumprir o menor de todos os Mandamentos e, como está escrito: Quem transgride um só, torna-se responsável pelos outros, pois todos os DEZ procedem de uma só VONTADE!!!<br>  <br>  Triste sina, n?o?<br>  <br>  Quando Jesus foi pregado no madeiro, quando à hora nona (3h da tarde) exalou o último suspiro transformou a CRUZ DE MALDI??O EM CRUZ DE REDEN??O:<br>  <br>   Tomai sobre vós o Meu Jugo, e aprendei de Mim, que Sou  Manso  e Humilde de Cora??o; e achareis descanso para as vossas almas.  Porque o Meu Jugo é Suave, e o Meu Fardo é Leve. (S. Mateus, 11:29,30)<br>  <br>  O segredo está na maneira de operar para que ocorra esta transforma??o e venha sobre nós a Potencialidade Divina.<br>  <br>  "DEUS VEM Só E T?O SOMENTE SOBRE SI MESMO"<br>  <br>  Alé lá, continuemos a contemplar o firmamento e suas belas constela??es...|`|icmKd001aa	E a  constelacao do Cruzeiro do Sul.

Eu adorava "Os Normais" e fiquei com muita pena do progarama ter acabado, mas acho que é melhor parar enquanto ainda está bom, sen?o o público acaba pedindo para acabarem logo com o programa, como é o caso de "Zorra Total", "Turma do Didi" (que nunca chegou a ser bom) e como aconteceu com a "Escolinha do Prof. Raimundo" (alguém lembra?), sem contar vários outros exemplos que est?o por aí saindo pelo ladr?o.<br>  <br>  Quanto à "Diarista" e "Sob Nova Dire??o", assiti pouco, mas tb acho que está na hora de acabarem, já deram o que tinham que dar, pois os personagens e situa??es s?o bastante limitados por conta da própria ambienta??o dos seriados, que foram feitos apenas para se aproveitar o talento c?mico das atrizes princiapais.<br>  <br>  Um caso à parte é "A Grande Família", pois como é uma espécie de novelinha, é difícil o programa ficar na mesmice, tanrto que houve a morte de umpersonagem, amadurecimento de outros e aina assim há muito material para se trabalhar.|`|mW2aiITnaa	Amigo concordo com vc.

No me queda ninguna duda de que se hizo un excelente trabajo de adaptación de las obras, se recrea con una consistencia increíble la magia del mundo fantástico de Tolkien en todo su esplendor (pese a que la obra se ambienta en una etapa de decadencia de ese mundo) los diálogos son maravillosos, las actuaciones muy logradas, los efectos especiales, pese a que son solo lo que deben ser (apoyos visuales para dar credibilidad a la trama) son de gran factura, y si todo esto no te convence aparece Liv Tyler hablando Sindarín, si hay algo más sexy y más hermoso que eso, dímelo por que hay que verlo para poderlo creer.|`|3890d84a35ff50691dad7d3673001d83aa	Para mi y se que para muchos la saga de suspenso al estilo de una novela de terror dividida en varios capítulos <br>  LA SAGA HELLRAISER cada capitulo tiene diferente tematica!!|`|4eb356813fa6bce0a563bd6f1b5c6912aa	Para mí es sin duda el Se?or de los anillos.

Te daré mis razones: tiene de todo, accion, drama, romance, uno que otro momento de comedia, fantasía,buenos efectos especiales, una gran historia, buenas actuaciones. Es de esas películas que hacen que creas que realmente estas ahí, hasta te sientes uno de los personajes. Tanto así como convencerte no se si se pueda, pues cada quien tiene sus gustos. Y claro que hay otras muy buenas sagas: Star Wars, Indiana Jones, incluso Harry Potter que no por involucrar ni?os significa que sea muy infantil, checa la clase de actores que tiene, pero si tuviera que escoger una sería definitivamente el Se?or de los Anillos.|`|bf4e143cb07ce7e522a62567c7f09248aa	Yo creo que Star Wars sin duda

50051773215656aaa1f3e5c7bc0d0ee8aa	No es santo de mi devoción, la verdad, pero ahí va lo que he encontrado:<br>  <br>  Junco es a la música gitana algo así como Barry White a la música negra. Banda sonora de mil y una noches de amor. Instinto primario entre sábanas de seda. Ricardo Gabarre se ganó el apodo de Junco de muy ni?o ayudando a su padre a cuidar caballos. Nacido en Fraga (Huesca) se traslada a los nueve a?os a Barcelona y, a los dieciséis, ya estaba al frente de Los ángeles Gitanos. Ya entonces, tendía a ese tempo lento que exigen las confesiones amorosas, su productor no lo entendió y quiso venderlos como unos rumberos más. Decepcionado por el fracaso, se dedicó a la venta ambulante mientras continuaba escribiendo canciones por afición.<br>  En 1986 ficha por Horus y lanza 'Hola mi amor', seguido de 'Vivir de amor' (1988) y 'No quiero nada'(1989). Junco se consagra entre los reyes de la balada gitana antes de afrontar su paso más decisivo.<br>  Cuando en 1991 graba 'Bella sin alma', inicia un viaje sin retorno a la canción italiana. No oculta su admiración por Marco Massini o Neck, pero prefiere centrarse en las desbordadas melodías de Cocciante, Battisti y Giaccobe.<br>  <br>  Letras de algunas de sus canciones:<br>  <a href="http://www.musica.com/letras.asp?c=16395" rel="nofollow">http://www.musica.com/letras.asp?c=16395</a><br>  <br>  Más letras:<br>  <a href="http://www.planetadeletras.com/index.php?m=a&a=Junco" rel="nofollow">http://www.planetadeletras.com/index.php...</a><br>  <br>  Portada de uno de sus LPs:<br>  <a href="http://www.coveralia.com/caratula.php?id=12497" rel="nofollow">http://www.coveralia.com/caratula.php?id...</a>|`|830c4982a643d1e5a562adde6333a696aa	Hola mi amor, tengo que hablar contigooooooooooooo.<br>  <br>  Hace mogollón que no se escucha nada de él.<br>  <br>  Un saludo.

663297edf503a9408c0dabde60213c07aa	A little "A" in the top right hand corner of the cover means that it was "approved" by the CCA, the Comics Code Authority.  The Code is a set of guidelines created to regulate the material that kids encounter in comic books.  An approved comic does not at any point portray crime in a postive manner and poetic justice is always served in some way, meaning that the bad guys must always be punished.  The villains must be portrayed completely as villains; the reader is not allowed much sympathy toward villains because the CCA was afraid that children might turn to crime themselves and emulate the characters they read about.  Gratuitous violence and gore are also prohibited.  Comics are even barred from having the words "crime", "horror", and "terror" in their names, which completely wiped out the horror comics genre.  An issue of Spider-Man was almost not approved because Harry Osborn was discovered to be doing drugs.  However, it passed inspection because it portrayed drugs as dangerous and Spider-Man apprehended the dealers in the end.<br>  Hope this helps.|`|AA11480528	The Comic is approved the comics code authority, which means The Incredible Hulk keeps his purple pants on when Dr. Banner Hulks out.

oMNHPDEvaa	What was your question?|`|yqe0I5zpaa	I'm very glad that Slumdog Millionaire won 8 Oscars, including Best Picture and Best Director for the much deserved Danny Boyle, it was easily the best film of the year. It was bittersweet and tragic to see Heath Ledger win the Oscar and to see his proud family accept on his behalf, he will be greatly missed. I was also psyched to see Sean Penn win, his performance in Milk was stunning. Rourke was good, but he played himself.|`|01wTbVEMaa	I'm so happy that Slumdog Millionaire won so many awards and Best Picture! That movie makes me wish I could be Indian, they're so pretty and the language is beautiful! Haha, I'm happy for Heath too! :D|`|y1Yl6p9Qaa	I'm with you all the way, I was getting kind of irritated at these other questions asking if we thought Heath Ledger deserved an oscar, ABSOLUTELY! His performance in the Dark Knight was superb. <br>  Slumdog kicked @ss at the awards, I was not surpised at that one either.|`|AA12307935	i agree. Heath Ledger is the man

AA12005596	Vou falar só sobre a mais perigosa: RIO DE JANEIRO, a vergonha do Brasil.|`|380e2cbee4e654344facbb6940e654b1aa	Rio de Janeiro - RJ<br>  Salvador - BA<br>  Ouro Preto - MG<br>  Natal - RN<br>  Penedo - AL<br>  <br>  Hoje esta perigoso em qualquer cidade grande.|`|6400f7da9b21b63c92d5b6bb944dd831aa	Acho q n?o dá pra ninguém responder a essa pergunta de forma realmente esclarecida, pq ninguém conhece todas as cidades! <br>  <br>  A n?o ser talvez algum caixeiro-viajante... ou candidato a presidente... <br>  <br>  Mas aí... meu zeus do olimpo...  como q vou escolher, por exemplo, entre Campos do Jord?o e Joinville?... s?o completamente diferentes! mas as duas s?o bonitas (ou pelo menos Joinville era mto bonita qdo estive lá, há anos, mas amigos q moram lá me dizem q n?o é mais t?o bonita....). Campos tb foi mais bonita do q é hj.. popularizou-se, claro q perdeu um pouco do charme. <br>  <br>  Aquele teleférico q fizeram lá é uma aberra??o, antes o q tinha no lugar dele era um morro lindo. <br>  <br>  Ent?o, em matéria de Campos do Jord?o, prefiro Monte Verde, q n?o tá na sua lista.... Mas sei de mto gaúcho q acha q a cidade mais bonita é Gramado, e tb n?o tá na lista.<br>  <br>  Qto à violência, como eu n?o sabia, fui consultar a net. No site da Radiobrás tem uma matéria da Folha de SP q diz q a cidade mais perigosa do Brasil é Diadema, na gde SP. A segunda cidade mais perigosa é Uberlandia. <br>  <br>  Das capitais, as mais perigosas s?o: <br>  1. Vitória<br>  2.Recife<br>  3.Rio<br>  4. S?o Paulo<br>  <br>  mas essa é uma matéria de 1999....<br>  www.radiobras.gov.br/anteriores/1999/s... - 45k -<br>  <br>  uma matéria deste ano, 2007, diz q: <br>  <br>  "As mortes violentas vêm ocorrendo com maior intensidade no interior, principalmente na regi?o Centro-Oeste. Entre as dez cidades com maior taxa de mortalidade, quatro s?o do Mato Grosso - Colniza (1o), Juruena (2o), S?o José do Xingu (5o), Aripoan? (8o). Os demais s?o Coronel Sapucaia (MS), em 3o, Serra (ES), em 4o, Vila Boa (GO), em 6o, Tailandia (PA), em 7o, Ilha de Itamaracá (PE), em 9o, e Macaé (RJ), em 10o.<br>  <br>  A cidade mais violenta, Colniza (MT), registrou, em 2004, 165,3 óbitos por 100 mil habitantes. No país, a média foi de 27,2 mortos na mesma compara??o. A primeira capital brasileira na lista das cidades mais violentas é Recife, em 13o lugar, com registro de 91,2 pessoas mortas para cada 100 mil habitantes.

Pois a cidade mais bonita do país você n?o listou. Aproveito o ensejo e te convido para vir conhecer minha cidade. Te dou também a hospedagem em minha residência. Sabe qual é nome dessa cidade?, Claro que você n?o sabe. é a cidade do povo mais hospitaleiro do país, é a cidade do sol, do sal, das praias e do ar mais puro do mundo. Dados do INPE - Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas Espacias. Esta cidade caro amigo, chama-se...NATAL. E agora? você sabe onde pelo menos ela fica no mapa do Brasíl?. Geografia se você der uma estudadazinha, você chega lá. Ok. Um abra?o e pegue o primeiro e próximo v?o e nós natalenses estamos a sua espera. N?o se preocupe que seu esquecimento será respeitado e você será muito bem recebido, assím como lulu santos, que comentou que em nossa cidade o povo é burro, talves ele tenha dito isso por nós termos recebido aquele maconheiro t?o bem e hospitaleiramente demos guarida a ele. E como Edmundo que nos chamou de paraíba e que gra?as à DEUS ele nunca mais pisou aqui. Aonde você estiver nesse momento e seja em qual cidade for, quero lhe dizer que aqui esta fazendo um clima de 26 graus, em plena quarta feira a cidade está lotada de turistas e as praias cheias. Caetano Veloso tem show aqui dia 21 próximo, amanh? dia dezenove tem Elimar Santos, ontem dia 17 teve Pepeu Gomes e no nosso shoppingo MID WAY MALL, o maior da america latina em área construída, na festa de 2 anos de aniversário, você assistí a shows dos vários artistas de nossa terra durante dez dias consecutivos.

3593be2acad4d331b430c2d0f1185a6aaa	Kate Bush nasceu em 1958, na Inglaterra. Toca piano desde crian?a e na adolescência já havia composto perto de 200 can??es.<br>  Bush teve um filho, Albert, do relacionamento com seu guitarrista e sócio atual Danny McIntosh, em 1998. N?o liberou a notícia do nascimento de seu filho à imprensa e manteve-a em segredo por dois anos até que o fato veio ao conhecimento do público em geral.  Esteve afastada do público por  vários anos, mas na realidade ela estava tentando dar ao seu filho pequeno uma infancia normal, longe do mundo do "show businness".<br>  Em poucas ocasi?es falou à imprensa desde ent?o, e quando tal ocorre declara sempre que a maternidade a fêz muito feliz. <br>  O oitavo album de estúdio de Bush, "Aerial", foi liberado em CD e em vinil em 7 novembro de 2005, seguindo-se a libera??o do single “King of Mountain” em 24 de outubro. <br>  Em uma entrevista que o "Australian" publicou em dezembro de 2005, Bush indicou que "Aerial" n?o foi t?o significativo para ser o seu último trabalho e que deseja continuar escrevendo e gravando música, o que é uma sorte e uma alegria muito grande para todos aqueles que admiram seu talento e suas qualidades incontestáveis de compositora, instrumentista e cantora e que a admiram ao longo desses seus mais de 20 anos de carreira.|`|AA12005596	Sim ela está viva.

Seu álbum de estréia, "The Kick Inside", de 1977, atingiu a marca de 1 milh?o de cópias vendidas. "Lionheart", o segundo CD, lan?ado um ano mais tarde, confirmou Bush como uma referência na cena pop britanica, levando-a a receber, em 87, o Brit Award de Melhor Voz Feminina<br>  <br>  abra?os<br>  @|`|WSH41Bmiaa	Rapaz, o que houve com minha predileta.<br>  Faz muito tempo que ela n?o me liga.<br>  Vou já ligar pro cel dela.<br>  <br>  Qualquer coisa te falo.<br>  Abra??o.|`|pyCHLAIbaa	yes|`|rcTNsfxXaa	Ela n?o morreu, está com uns 49 anos...

They're both pretty good.|`|UXUKwJSwaa	Korpiklaani has some faster songs. I'd call them more of "drinking" metal. If you listen to them, you'll see. <br>  Manegarm is pretty awesome. Bit of a variety in their style, which is kind of awesome. <br>  Tyr is pretty amazing as well. I only have a few of their songs, though. <br>  Alestorm has more of a pirate them, but they're pretty good as well.|`|QJpbPWxaaa	Enslaved.

HRx2sjBhaa	I thought he saved the Academy Awards! Each year they seem to get more boring and I keep telling myself I won't watch the whole thing but usually do hoping it will get better. This year I was actually able to look forward to the show. I was still disappointed in most of the categories but I thought Hugh did a terrific job! I loved the dance numbers and the opening jokes. Especially the part about downsizing to New Zealand next year. And at the end of the first song in which he says he's Wolverine. Strangely enough I am obsessed with musicals and comic book adaptions so this was a dream come true to hear him sing that.|`|5UH4vR1Jaa	I think he did a spectacular job at hosting.<br>  The first act was memorable.<br>  <br>  Then again, everyone's entitled to their own opinion. :)|`|0HUntD4Raa	He was great. A complete showman: an actor not just speaking, but also dancing and singing. A change form the comedy-central -monologues -only of the last years!!!|`|C7umw5Vpaa	I liked him. And I liked the musical numbers. He was sympathetic enough for me.|`|f551e387a3e6f01af266f4af899c09e9aa	I thought he was the best since Bill Crystal.  He was awesome and I was very surprised.|`|IDuA6JCxaa	He was different. No the others were better. But Jackman was fine.|`|DgAOboZNaa	i thought it was awesome!<br>  :D|`|73f4817c9af75121ee93853e03437fc1aa	I thought he did a great job hosting, and the opening number was hysterical!|`|4wm5kAygaa	It was great, I had no idea he could sing. All the new musical theater  really added to the show this year. I loved when he called up Anne Hathaway and that whole number at the beginning. I have to say Ellen was pretty great too!|`|hd442Ha5aa	You have to realize though that the previous hosts are professional comedians. He did a comedic and good job considering that he is just an actor. It was an okay job. Better than I thought it would be.|`|kiD47XbTaa	He was AWESOME!|`|24e3c53ff3387eb84f27768983042d80aa	I thought he did fine, he was entertaining.|`|AA10897020	he was funny! i liked him.
ibYYyPaiaa	Yah. So Totally.|`|w2Dui70Faa	No, I hate the tandem of Sarah and John Lloyd. I also haven't seen "A Very Special Love".
F3KkB4GWaa	Yessss! Absolute trash. Those camera angles were so lame. I think it was just a way to avoid having to spend too much on special affects.|`|ESXYxYKCaa	I admit like others that camera work is nauseous<br>  BUT<br>  One line to summarize this film according to my review is "Cloverfield is monster story what Blair Witch Project was to ghost story"<br>  <br>  It wasn't too bad though.|`|9bSCOZB1aa	All I could focus on throughout that movie was how determined that camera man was. That camera never left his hand, even as his leg was eaten by arachnid-like alien things, his friend's head exploded, and he was tossed into the air by a giant beast.|`|AA12307935	The point of the movie was to see it through the camera. I hated the way it made me nauseous and dizzy. I also hated the ending. Everyone just dies! But I guess the point was he died with his loved one.|`|odc3Y1edaa	i liked it. the deffintally need to not make a second one. and yes the theme is a bit used but it wasnt one of thouse movies i walked outa thinking about the monie i just wasted|`|SbbpfaG7aa	the camera was making me dizzy, felt like puking and what pisses me more is why the critics gave such good ratings to a bizarre rubbish movie|`|IEb4gtdpaa	i kind of liked it....it was interesting<br>  but i will admit, the camera was annoying|`|BpZLDMsoaa	I loved it, mainly because it was so different from most other movies.|`|BgnAMffpaa	you know they wasted a lot of money on it. the movie could have been much better!!!!<br>  it had a good story line but it started off very badly|`|9IyIO0Qkaa	it was horrible i thought wasnt half as good as i thought it would be|`|uKrRyVgVaa	I just couldn't watch it due to the "cool" way they filmed it...what bloody retards|`|GP1KPyekaa	yes it sux|`|zQB0kEmcaa	I did not like it - the jumpy camera was really annoying ...|`|sJNoTGQVaa	I think the fact that you used the word "rubbish" is rubbish|`|AA10300538	Im with u there buddy. I think cloverfield was kinda rubbish....like a bad sequel of blair witch (which was also reletively bad in my opinion).<br>  I think they should have made it have a bit more of a story line...rather than the bits and pieces.. I thought it was a waste of my time|`|speJXeIhaa	I liked it, and i liked the camera perspective too - it was different and made it more realistic.|`|80II1Wv1aa	I like it, but not as much as most ppl. I think they don't want to answer questions b/c they're saving it for a sequel.|`|miyQcyJFaa	I did not liked it too much..|`|JZMfUDylaa	I liked it! it wasn't the best movie ever like they say in the comericals but it was pretty good. My bf at the time didn't like it at all cause the way the camera moved a lot made him sick lol!|`|zGYvQoBaaa	show the  movie  not me dision dipended peoples dosion,|`|OSK0tQPSaa	Not only rubbish, but that camera work made me nauseous|`|X4RaGIaLaa	-_- dude.... a lot of movies do that..... clover field is an action movie of course the cams gonna be moving everywhere.....|`|KzXv8ZKEaa	definetly,rubbish.|`|22f82d8d45e6cb20bd3007cf1b7900f2aa	I agree, the camera stuff was annoying and I thought the movie would be better.|`|MVZ6Mpa1aa	I lasted 3 minutes!|`|cWfTvJTcaa	well, i liked it, but in that "this is really bad" sort of way.
buUTakKAaa	the first band to employ the screamo genre were The Sacramento Band Far and the Canadian group Grade|`|mqgS6Dfxaa	AC/DC|`|zqmy9Qfkaa	Which type of screaming?<br>  High-pitched "pig squeal" or the low metal-type?<br>  Or just screaming in general?<br>  Wrong forum too, sorry :(
PY1DKRUIaa	Beck  - Cover of Dylan's Leopard-Skin Pill-Box Hat|`|4x2KMVbBaa	Here's a link to the montage: <a href="http://blip.tv/file/1803262" rel="nofollow">http://blip.tv/file/1803262</a>
8ouVqW0Uaa	Logically speaking, air should be able to bend ANYTHING.<br>  <br>  For example, air should be able to "bend" water by carrying it around.<br>  <br>  Same applies for fire, metal, vines, ice, etc.|`|9Ywbz5w3aa	i always asked myself when i was watching it.<br>  <br>  but the thing is that they can do a lot of special stuff.<br>  like gliding and tornadoes; and moving things using air.<br>  <br>  but because air is how it is(no matter what it's used in, it's always considered air); you can really extend it so far, or else it won't be airbending anymore.|`|zaZibcGkaa	theres no special bending for air, however they are the only people that can fly whenever they want and they can run like the wind.  Unless you consider cloudbending and soundbending a better answer because they can do that too.|`|NvJzUipvaa	hmmm.... smoke? Why do you think they all died off?|`|VOxZ2dt2aa	i dont think so lol other than like tornados which is like the same thing|`|grv8mCeJaa	thats a tricky one- maybe they can control you because when you breath in air goes in your lungs, just like with bloodbending

YGDsepzuaa	the movie is better than the series. but i think your right about the series explaining more seeing as it has the time advantage. but the movie does a better job at putting those powers into action. the series just drags with back stories and such. i hope i didn't ruin your experience or anything.|`|8IDEe8Y2aa	Movie
36439efa77037bfd10ac9d0216e58cfeaa	Idk, I dont think he is married, maybe he just wear a certain ring on there sometimes. I often do that.<br>  Idk, but i do know that he is like really smexi, and super duper nice in person.|`|0ODiTrriaa	As far as I know he is dating model Luana Church.   David lives in the fixed up basement of band member Jeff.   I don't think a wife would tolerate that.   He isn't ready to settle down and get a house for himself yet.|`|94cf9d8f23c4608bc6c45d40777d17c1aa	Because sometimes he feels like he's married to his wife.

dd1ed523a17927679c4955f404f3e139aa	I kind of agree... but I love all their stuff. Pop was probably their most disappointing album for me... but I do like some of the tracks from it as well. I am so stoked for the new one coming out soon.|`|WU4MHq3aaa	yeah... I like the Joshua Tree...|`|AA11452399	absolutely|`|tyTJE8vxaa	Absolutely. They were great up until The Joshua Tree. In the course of the last 20 years or so Bono has turned from an extremely talented & poltically aware songsmith into a whiny, sanctimonius little pissant who is more concerned with his role as self-appointed saviour of the world than with making music.|`|PeuFnqQwaa	I agree totally!<br>  <br>  Everything was good until Rattle and Hum came out. That album was Horrible.<br>  <br>  Boy, October, The Unforgettable Fire and The Joshua Tree are the Best!|`|fce6b20339c75fb9fb439e1ea485621aaa	I'm a hardcore fan..love all of their work.Bono is very spiritual. :)|`|oUZLZusjaa	I'm not a huge U2 fan, but their oldest albums are definitely their most consistently great. After that, they have their ups and their downs. This new album sounds pretty solid though. It won't be their best, but it'll be much better than average is what I predict.|`|93t1aNWgaa	yes...me.. i love their song ONE..|`|wTkvkWscaa	Eh. A few of their older songs are alright. I've never really liked U2.

And then rescued by another. Now 10 years later, Yuki Cross, the adopted daughter of the headmaster of Cross Academy, has grown up and become a guardian of the vampire race, protecting her savior, Kaname, from discovery as he leads a group of vampires at the elite boarding school. But also at her side is Zero Kiryu, a childhood friend who’s hatred for the creatures that destroyed everything he held dear, is now determined never to trust them. This coexisting arrangement seems all well and good, but have the vampires truly renounced their murderous ways, or is there a darker truth behind their actions. Is Kaname's infatuation with Yuki the beginning of a forbidden romance, or is it something in her forgotten past that draws him to her. Because in this world of secrets, nothing is as it seems.

One day, Junichi's cousin and childhood friend, Sakura Yoshino came back from America all of a sudden. To Junichi's surprise, she looks exactly the same as the girl that moved away six years ago, and hasn't aged one bit. And she came back to remind Junichi of their childhood promise...

aw2xkdSbaa	Just recenly attended? I guess thats subjective. Its a once a year festival, last put on 9 months ago. I went to the first one, but not last year's. This year pretty much has the same bands, of which most have been touring extensively in the last 5 months. they need to get different bands on board that didn't just come through town on their own tour.
lpyWVR2oaa	Most Witches are blessed with skills inherited from their parents/ancestors etc in the family tree but not always necessarily so.<br>  <br>  In Witchcraft, the casting of spells can fall under either White magic or Black Magic. Voodoo would fall under the latter category. But most commercial witches use White Magic mainly for the benefit of the recipients and as long as you're not casting the spell in order to harm somebody, spells are considered harmless. Witchcraft isn't evil unless there is intended harm inflicted on an object (person, thing etc).|`|FmazIF6Maa	No, you don't need to be born a Witch. It is a practice.<br>  <br>  Of course someone who is born to practicing Witches and taught from a young age will have some benefits, or some may exhibit more natural talent than others, as in all things. But it's something anyone can choose to learn.<br>  <br>  Witchcraft doesn't really have anything to do with evil... it's just a practice. Magic is a tool, you learn to use it.<br>  <br>  People can do things for good or bad reasons, they can be helpful or they can hurt others. They can pick up a hammer and build a house with it, or they can bash someone's head with it. They can use Witchcraft to cure people or to destroy lives. <br>  <br>  But Witches, like any other group of people, have morals and ethics. Just like most carpenters would not advocate using a hammer to hurt someone, so would most Witches not advocate using Witchcraft to hurt someone.|`|UxooffHZaa	Depends. No, it is not evil. Just like guns aren't evil. But, if someone shoots a gun at someone else, that is evil. Witchcraft is a psychological tool that can be used for good or evil. <br>  I personally work in Tarot and Sigilization, and do no evil.|`|ZkBLNj6Vaa	No, it is not in and of itself evil.<br>  <br>  People use it for evil results sometimes, but that would make them the evil one.<br>  <br>  Just like I could use a frying pan for good or evil, for example.  I could cook some eggs or I could whack someone on the head with it.<br>  <br>  The majority of people I know use it for everyday good things.|`|tQW18Kspaa	witch craft<br>  It's a craft,herbal medicine is part of the craft.<br>  <br>  Judaism also makes clear that witchcraft while always forbidden to Jews, may be performed by Gentiles outside the holy land (i.e. Israel)<br>  <br>  There are good witches and Bad witches<br>  Didn't you ever see the Wizard of Oz?|`|80II1Wv1aa	witchcraft is not evil, it's just another form of spirituality.<br>  and sorcery doesn't even exist.|`|LtAVf2sLaa	Blessings it depends on YOU.

She finds out he only intended to use her as a maid for cleaning, cooking, and providing for him and actually has no feelings for her. She's infuriated and decides to swear revenge by competing with him in the entertainment industry, cause he's a famous idol. not school based, but still VERY good!!!|`|dpAD1KoEaa	code geass... you'll thank me later.|`|wJSYXvzGaa	Hana Kimi: its about a girl who dress as a boy to get into an all boys school to convince the guy for which she admired and liked to high jump again. she ends up living in the same dorm as he and they fall in love with each other. and through out the series they go on many dorm related adventures. <br>  <br>  Happy Hustle High: Hanabi is a tough girl who goes to an all girl school which is then merged with an all boys school. all of the girls fall for the 3 council members of the all boys school.

When she greets him, Koki pretends not to know her and she is shocked that he would act so differently from their previous meeting.<br>  Meanwhile, the students at the school discover Tanpopo is a poor girl from the country side and begin to bully her. In an effort to change the social hierarchy of the school and also find some new friends, Tanpopo cheerfully starts the "Planting Club".

w11e32dgaa	The words 'Digital Monitor' or 'HDTV Monitor' or 'Digital Ready' or 'HDTV Ready' do not mean that the TV actually contains a digital tuner. You will probably need to convert it to DTV. You should also check the manual or any other materials that came with your television in order to determine whether it contains a digital tuner. If you can't find that documentation, an Internet search for using the TV brand and model number along with the word 'manual' should allow you to find the documentation online. You can also call the manufacturer and ask. <br>  I Guess I Need To Convert My TV. What Now?<br>  Digital-to-analog set-top converter boxes are sold at various local retailers like Best Buy, Sears, Radio Shack, Wal-Mart and Target and others. As soon as you make the determination that you need to convert your analog TV to DTV, you should request a coupon that will save you $40 on the converter box.

u2QhQAxzaa	I could give a rats azz about what Sean Penn thinks.  He just won an award for Best Actor, not best Activist.  The show is honoring the entertainment and it was neither the time and place for his comments.  Most people have their minds made up on gay marriage and therefore, Sean Penn needs to understand that he is on siding with the left and that just makes him look self involved and obnoxious.  "Opinions are like azzholes, everyone has one."  -Clint|`|prMwhfsxaa	I don't have a problem with it.  If you have a chance to be in the spotlight  why not fight for what you believe?  You don't have to agree with him but when he has a large forum why not tell the people what he thinks?  I would if I had the chance.|`|5dc6493b424c85096e22e1614be3c9daaa	no, because he was shaking and probably wasn't thinking straight while giving speech, He probably just siad those out of uncontrolable impulse.

It is a topic that is considered related to Harvey Milk, due to the fact that Milk was the first openly gay official elected. And for those common Americans living in California, the views he stated are very emotional and have quite some meaning whether for or against gay marriage. Also, his comment about Obama is in support, which is also a comment opinion due to the fact that this election was a historical moment for our nation, along with other significances for common americans. <br>  <br>  If you have an opportunity to share you views and stand behind them, then take it that opportunity. Sean Penn did that by executing his ability to free speech.<br>  <br>  And in regards to his shaking, last time I checked winning Best Actor is the biggest achievement for an actor. So his emotions were kicking in. Not to mention, he was standing in front of hundreds of people, and being broadcasted to millions if not billions world wide. So if you were in his position, I am sure you would be shaking too.|`|i09pUyE4aa	well tons of American's only vote for someone because "OH MAH GAWDz BRAD PITT LIKES THEM LET'S VOTE lawlzzz"<br>  but i honestly, like to know everyone's opinion and point of view and things, because i like when people can change my mind about something.<br>  but if the celebrity doesn't give opinions and reasons, i don't think they need to state it obnoxiously.<br>  get a sign like the rest of America.|`|8Mi15cTtaa	HELL NO! They are twits that are so full of themselves and think that they are more important than everyone else.<br>  <br>  Sean Penn should have kept politics out of the Oscars. His comments were insulting.

1YdeUn1Caa	I was 16. I was told that second hand smoke was worse than actually smoking. So common sense said to start smoking to stay healthier. I've never felt better.<br>   I got them from cigarette machines. Bowling alleys and gas stations always had them. They never asked for ID either. Good thing machines can't talk. They just take your money and give you the cigarettes. Ah, the good ol days.|`|73ZquQVwaa	yes, 17 is when i started cigs, and anout 16 is when i started pot.|`|868rE46gaa	Yeah I started smoking cigars when I was 16 and I got them from older friends. When i was 18 I started smoking cigarettes and I've tried to quit multiple times. I've gone from smoking a pack a day to smoking only 1 or 2 cigarettes a day... So, I'm doing better.<br>  <br>  And to the girl with the peace sign as a name:<br>  **** you. I only smoke on my balcony, ALONE or with my friends that smoke also... I'm not harming anyone but myself.|`|jNUYkCZxaa	I've been smoking since 1967. I was 11 when I started though I used to buy them before that when they were only 45 cents for my mom.

By 15 I was buying them at the corner store and only got refused a couple times.<br>  - We would hide out in the woods near our house until that got old and we started smoking in public.|`|VqN3xV1uaa	Yes<br>  Before I was 7<br>  I come from a smoking family, so my parents let me smoke as much as I wanted. I could just take a pack from their cartons any time I needed some. And I smoked them at home, in the car, and with relatives at their houses.|`|Ws1hky6Zaa	16<br>  there was a gas station by my parents house and the ladie never carded. i would go out driving around with my friends and smoke, then spray on the perfume before i went home, like it covered the smell. lol|`|DqbLx3hxaa	I smoke<br>  I started when I was 13,<br>  I just went into the corner store by my house, eventually they just got used to me and never really asked me for ID.<br>  I smoked anywhere, I never hid it from anyone|`|91570a0146f250c792909304f3b1f793aa	age 17 in 1953.<br>  still smoking but these days its a pipe.<br>  cigarettes are too expensive in australia.|`|RAiBtbMLaa	i used to.. but not anymore.|`|B2PW3sUKaa	no. and i never will|`|dpCsTIEIaa	I was a rebellious teen...started smoking when I was 14.

Maybe you're an artsy and creative person, so maybe try making jewelry, painting or drawing, or doing photography. Perhaps you could even take up an instrument and learn to play music. If you don't happen to be very creative, then maybe you could do some volunteer work instead of an actual job. Volunteering is an activity that makes you feel like you're doing something better for the world, as opposed to a job that you would only do to make money. <br>  Instead of just idling around all day and allowing yourself to be passively bored, it would help if you were productive, but not in way as to pressure yourself.<br>  Good Luck =)
FyPKXjEFaa	They used to get a 'non-cash compensation' in the form of goody bags worth up to $100,000. In 2006, however, the IRS cracked down on these gifts saying celebrities would have to pay tax on the contents so the Academy now don't give them out. <br>  <br>  "The Internal Revenue Service and the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences yesterday announced they have reached a settlement on undisclosed taxes owed to the government on the "gifts" received at the Oscars in the last several years, through 2005.<br>  <br>  "The academy also announced it will no longer give out the bags, saying the board quietly voted last April to end the practice. In recent years, the academy has given the bags -- also known as gift bags or swag -- to as many as 200 hosts, performers and winners on Oscar night. "There's no special red-carpet tax loophole for the stars," IRS Commissioner Mark W. Everson said in a prepared statement."<br>  <br>  Apparently now the trend is to combine the gift-giving with charitable donations so they can choose the gifts and decide how much they want to donate to charity then fill in a tax form.|`|Gem96NQyaa	No, you don't.  Though the presenters make out like bandits... tons of uber-expensive gift baskets and whatnot.<br>  <br>  The awards themselves are gold-plated, but that's all the winners get.|`|K4Y76H3qaa	Not from the Academy Awards.

q8yOILG6aa	<a href="http://gossipgenius.blogspot.com/2009/02/whole-scoop-on-what-really-happened.html" rel="nofollow">http://gossipgenius.blogspot.com/2009/02...</a><br>  <br>  Chris Brown and Rihanna were riding in his rented silver Lamborghini when he received a text message. Rihanna got jealous, snatched the phone and started flipping out. She started hitting him (not sure where but he DEFINITELY has marks) and shouting. Chris Brown couldn't drive under these conditions so he stopped the car.<br>  <br>  At this point, Rihanna threw the keys out of the ignition and this set Chris off but he did not hit her... YET. When he couldn't find the keys, he returned to the car and yelled at her for throwing them. Rihanna put her hands over Chris Brown's mouth and thats how Rihanna got the bite marks.<br>  <br>  Rihanna then said something that REALLY set Chris Brown off. According to reliable sources, Rihanna said something to the affect of "Why don't you beat me up like your step-dad did to your mother?"<br>  <br>  This really set Chris off as his family past is a very sensitive subject. Chris went into a fit of rage and hit Rihanna a few times.<br>  <br>  In short, Rihanna instigated the fight and Chris Brown took it WAY too far. Neither person is innocent in this case<br>  <br>  <br>  this question is asked so much! there was no herpes|`|k39bNUgeaa	He beat her that's all we know<br>  <br>  People are making up excuses just to get attention<br>  <br>  the only people that know the reason is chris and rihanna|`|c9adce326b761303adb12127ff5dabd0aa	They do and they aren't telling.|`|zetxxZWUaa	The truth is Rihanna found a txt on Brown's phone from another girl who wanted to hook up and do a booty call, she got upset and totally got on to him for basically cheating and he went nuts.<br>  <br>  I know there is a ton of photo shop pic of Rihanna but tmz.com has a real photo of what she looked like after the incident. Chris Brown apparently also bit her on her arm and fingers, somebody needs to beat the hell out of that big-gum negro and throw his ugly un-talented *** in jail.|`|Bn864omfaa	no thats not true but i don't no what happend because every one keeps telling stories and even in magazines each one u read the more different stories you have at my friends house her mom has magazines and i read like 3 of them that had stories about it and they were all different so i dont think any one but chris and Rihanna really no what happend|`|14UfFR3qaa	He smashed her, thats all i know.|`|K2Soawplaa	i agree with the first answer.|`|sfYsac5Vaa	Supposedly,<br>  Rihanna and Chris were out eating lunch and then Rihanna gave Chris the ews that she gave him herpes and then he got upset and bit her and abused her and turned himself in.

But you can look it up.|`|l1SVSF7zaa	nobody does.  so STOP ASKING!<br>  <br>  people are going to answer this question with things that they heard but probably aren't true.<br>  get your own life instead of worrying about theirs!|`|xyaio5rpaa	Um...

But that's the only reason. Oh and she's a slut.
H92Yava5aa	The Best Thing by Relient K is a great song to sing to a girl you like.  When my (now) boyfriend told me how he felt about me, he told me that because of me, this song was special to him.  It was the perfect song for it.  The song uses a lot of piano, but i'm sure you can find guitar tabs for it online.|`|8IDEe8Y2aa	Here are some artists for ya to experiment with!

KEVIN ISN'T GAY GODDAMIT!<br>  <br>  This is the most bizarre question in the world, but no one know can answer this except Mama & Papa J. And anyway, NONE of those guys are gay! You might be, but they aren't!|`|NOSWANvNaa	Well if they actually cared about their son they wouldn't mind. :/<br>  So hopefully people in the world will stop judging because in the Bible it also says not to judge.<br>  <br>  Homosexuality is not a wrong thing for my Uncle is and one of my best friends is bi and she is not a bad person.<br>  <br>  It's the people who judge.<br>  If they don't like it, too bad. I'm sure Kevin is gay too.<br>  I know that's who you're talking about.|`|v1tHjJ3haa	keep up the good work, thanks for the retirement money ahead of time, now show me more $ and you can continue :D jk, I'd be shocked and they aren't gay :D|`|73f4817c9af75121ee93853e03437fc1aa	It depends on if you're a homophobic hypocrite or not, I guess.  If you stand by your beliefs, no matter how wrong or misguided they may be, then it wouldn't matter how much money they made.|`|zetxxZWUaa	I'm not against homosexuals, but it's obvious that one of the Jonas Brothers is gay, the guy just is a flamer so it's obvious. I hate the Jonas Brothers in general (not because there is a gay guy in it) but because they have no talent and are just irritating to listen to and watch.<br>  <br>  If they have nice and good parents then they'll accept their son for who he is. And if they are horrible parents they will disown their son and never talk to him again.|`|hd442Ha5aa	From the thumbs down on the other answers, I am expecting one myself with this answer.<br>  <br>  Homosexuality is not immoral or wrong but it's just a judgmental view in the eyes of the beholder. <br>  <br>  Their parents would probably be in total shock. They'd pray to God to remove this "abomination" from their son and eventually come to accept their son.|`|AA11090423	It's hard to say because a lot of religous people don't accept homosexuals. However, their family is extremely close-knit, so I think if one of the, ever did come out, they would accept it. Being gay isn't the worst thing in the world, most famous deisgners are gay.|`|EfLEZaNqaa	omg i bet one of them is! prob kevin, haha. they would prolly pull one of those "oh we love him for who he is" and then like 2 weeks later we'll see somewhere that they like disown him or something! lol that would be rich.

QE3hLbN4aa	the song was covered by beck|`|eL268hETaa	It's actually a cover of an old 1976 Bob Dylan song called Leopard Skin Pillbox Hat.  The version you heard was by Beck from the Warchild CD and I think he wrote it.  Personally, I thought it sounded like Ringo Starr or the Beatles.

1BKdwrvuaa	Well theres two specific episodes that stand out.<br>  <br>  Ep 176 i think.<br>  Its the one where Gohan defeats Cell. I like it coz all of the z fighters jump in and help him. And for once its not Goku who saves the day.<br>  <br>  Ep 222 i think.<br>  Its the one where Vegeta sacrifices himself for Bulma and Trunks. Its really sad but good too.<br>  <br>  Also u should watch where Goku transforms in SSJ for the first time.<br>  <br>  All of these can be found on Youtube.<br>  Enjoy.<br>  <br>  If u need help on anything else DBZ. Message me.|`|knKVjOE6aa	I think the Cell saga is the best it's Goku saviour of the Earth passing on the baton to his son Gohan the new hero of Earth.|`|dpAD1KoEaa	bardoc,the father of goku. but series...freeza saga. even thought I enjoy code geass even more.

Same goes for 'Dark Water'.  Do a search on Korean/Japanese horror/thriller movies, there's heaps and they're great, super scary.<br>  Others I'd recommend are:<br>  Rec - Spanish zombie movie, new take on a classic theme.  this is the most similar to 'The Exorcist' in terms of the kinds of scares it gives you and the paranormal themes<br>  The Exorcism of Emily Rose.<br>  The Village (scary in a psychological/philosophical way).<br>  Apocalypse Now - classic war movie.<br>  Redacted - Iraq/Afghanistan war movie, can't recommend it highly enough.<br>  Funny Games - seriously fuced up rich kids killing their rich neighbors, excellent cast (Naomi Watts)<br>  A Clockwork Orange - seriously fuced up poor guys committing serious crimes<br>  <br>  Hitchcock films:<br>  Vertigo - I can't watch this, even though it is an excellent film.  It just makes me so upset.<br>  Rebecca - I preferred the book.<br>  The Birds - weird|`|3ELCpil7aa	the omen<br>  the excorcist (sp?)<br>  the ring<br>  the strangers<br>  carrie<br>  halloween<br>  and of course the shining|`|hPl2B7bdaa	Alien, The Thing, Nosferatu|`|5Xykbetnaa	The Amytiville Horror|`|dycC1Lxoaa	ummm... the title... geez, i 4get, um... something like... the village, give or take a few words... <br>  SCARY AS HELL!!!|`|k4W3mCBKaa	grudge|`|2nkCO7HLaa	the village,<br>  chucky,<br>  signs,<br>  jeepers creepers!<br>  all these movies scared the crap out of me!!!<br>  -ginny :)|`|oFePenfVaa	haha I was gonna say the exorcist...um The Shining if you haven't already seen it.

AA11615026	You are are a lovely lady with good taste!  Yes I very much enjoy the old stuff too, I am 21 yr old male in Nor Cal, OKAY<br>  <br>  I am a very huge fan of Frank Sinatra and have a way lot and like Dean Martin but only have a few of his.  Here are some other names, Doris Day, Sammy Davis Jr., Debbie Reynolds...<br>  <br>  I really like the song When I Fall In Love which Doris Day originally sang in probably the 50's.  You might recognize this song from Sleepless In Seattle. The remake was sung by Celine Dion and Clive something, Griffin I think.  Anyway, Doris Day's version is very good.<br>  <br>  Dean Martin has a really good version of Baby It's Cold Outside, kind of a Christmas song but still kind of a warm love song.  Also he sings Thats Amore', though I don't like this song that much it is still quite popular.  He also sings the theme to the John Wayne movie Rio Bravo, it is called Get Along Home Cindy... that one I think is quite good, almost kind of country but still good.<br>  <br>  Sammy Davis Jr. I am not very familar with but he sings the original Candyman which was remade in the original Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory... I prefer the Chocolate Factory version cause I am kind of a sucker for that movie LOL<br>  <br>  Debbie Reynolds had some hit songs including the song Tammy which is also a theme from a movie,  of which I forget the title.<br>  <br>  So to Frank Sinatra.... here are some of my favs from him perhaps you will like them too?<br>  <br>  All The Way<br>  My Lean Baby<br>  Just One Of Those Things<br>  For Once In My Life<br>  Come Fly With Me<br>  Mack The Knife<br>  How Do You Keep The Music Playing<br>  The September Of My Years<br>  As Time Goes By (Theme From Casablanca)<br>  I Did It My Way<br>  Luck Be A Lady Tonight (theme from Guys and Dolls)<br>  Send In The Clowns<br>  The Impossible Dream<br>  The Way You Look Tonight<br>  Hey Jealous Lover<br>  Moon River (theme from Breakfast At Tiffany's)<br>  Summer Wind<br>  Strangers In The Night<br>  I've Got The World On A String<br>  Let Me Try Again<br>  In The Wee Small Hours Of The Morning<br>  New York New York<br>  I Love Paris<br>  Fly Me To The Moon<br>  Same Old Saturday Night<br>  <br>  <br>  I have lots more if you are that interested LOL you can IM me at popeye1285@yahoo.com also my email address kk<br>  <br>  oh another name I thought of is Bobby Darin.  There is a really cool movie which Kevin Spacey portrays Bobby Darin and Spacey acually sings his songs and dances and everything You might acually really like it.  I have it on dvd and love it.  Spacey does a very good job singing so check it out if you want hope to TTYL|`|3f1e40ba435c1d326916e58f6ca87d10aa	Go to your local disco joint and ask the played out DJ on stage.|`|a79d6c0cc9850864465ed3fd3c54d71caa	I would suggest getting online or going to a music store that lets you listen to CD's and try a few out. Or go online where music is sold and sample there. That way you can get something that you really enjoy. Another option, if you have it available, is to check out the music stations through your cable company. They always have an oldies 'station' with song, artist and album info and go from there!

The British producers had originally announced a possible April, 2002 release, and were then aiming for December 25th, 2002. Then, a 2004 release seemed likely, but with the new start date of May, 2004, sometime in 2005 is the next likely target."<br>  <br>  you can check out their website.... they have some info there too... <a href="http://www.reddwarf.co.uk/" rel="nofollow">http://www.reddwarf.co.uk/</a>|`|4c384b4d551cb60715e8fb8e5eb6067caa	As time goes by - its looking more and more unlikely. I remember when i was much younger my friend and i was really excited about The year 1997 as a film linked to a franchise i liked (mortal kombat annihilation) and a film linked to a franchise he liked (red dwarf: the movie) were coming out.  Unfortunately - only one of us got his his wish but that's how long ago a red dwarf movie was discussed.<br>  <br>  If you go to red dwarf.co.uk - you find a link to a site with info on the movie but hasn't been updated in some time.<br>  <br>  Basically the MAIN ISSUE as to why it hasn't been made yet is the funding. However with big stars such as Madonna and Patrick Stewart who are BIG fans of the show and were due to have cameos if a film ever did get financed - that could still change.<br>  <br>  Personally, i think a another series is more likely than a movie.

I love him when he was a little brat too. He is the best captain (taicho) and is he the genius boy. I like the colors that represent him too, silver (his hair), green (his beautifull eyes), and blue (when he makes his ban kai). All of that and he still is a child within standars of soul society.<br>  He is my favorite character of all times.

AA11070808	the way the lightsabers are supposed to work is that while you have it in your hand, your finger/grip has the "blade" in the "on" position. this way if the saber falls or gets knocked out of their hand, it will automatically turn off. you are able to lock it in the on position but it isn't normally done for safety reasons (i guess).<br>  <br>  when darth maul was chopped in half, his blade was still on, but as he fell down, he lost his strength and didn't put the energy needed to keep the lightsaber (or half of one since the dual blade got chopped in half) on... and truth to tell, keeping the saber on was the least of his problems considering he was in pieces and falling to his doom.<br>  <br>  i'm sure if you view the movie in "slow" or look at a still frame you should see the deactivated saber. if not, consider the fact that they forgot to put it in the movie.|`|e4353542228be082d8905600b494182daa	It's Sith Magik.

dca715b9cf6a27fd8457235f1dbad477aa	TíTULO DO FILME: EM NOME DO PAI (In the Name of the Father, Irlanda/Gr? Bretanha/EUA, 1993)<br>  DIRE??O: Jim Sheridan<br>  ELENCO: Daniel Day-Lewis, Emma Thompson, Pete Postlethwait, John Linch, Corin Redgrave. 132 min.<br>  <br>  RESUMO<br>  <br>  Em 1974, um atentado a bomba produzido pelo IRA (Exército Republicano Irlandês) mata cinco pessoas num pub de Guilford, arredores de Londres. O jovem rebelde irlandês Gerry Conlon e três amigos s?o presos e condenados pelo crime. Giuseppe Conlon, pai de Gerry, tenta ajudar o filho e também é condenado, mas pede ajuda à advogada Gareth Peirce, que investiga as irregularidades do caso.<br>  <br>  CONTEXTO HISTóRICO<br>  <br>  O atentado retratado pelo filme faz parte de uma atualidade que se tornou rotina na Inglaterra desde a divis?o da Irlanda em 1921.<br>  Dominada desde o século XII pelos ingleses, a Irlanda nunca se deixou subjugar completamente. País de língua celta e de religi?o católica (exceto na regi?o nordeste no Ultser), a Irlanda origina-se no século IV antes de nossa era, quando ocorre a chegada de uma popula??o céltica, os gaélicos, diferente daquela que, na mesma época, invadiu a Gr?-Bretanha. No século XVIII a Irlanda conheceu uma explora??o t?o violenta, que sua popula??o chegou a diminuir sensivelmente.<br>  Em 1801 com a "Ata da Uni?o", o parlamento inglês anexou totalmente a regi?o, dando aos irlandeses uma participa??o insignificante no governo, onde patriotas como Oa?TConnel e Parnell, deputados pela Irlanda, lutaram pela autonomia política, a "Home Rule".<br>  Já era comum que a luta resultasse em radicalismos e violência, contando com a atua??o de sociedades secretas como a "Jovem Irlanda" e a "Liga Agrária de Parnell". Por outro lado, os 3/4 católicos da popula??o irlandesa n?o possuíam direito de representa??o parlamentar, até que em 1899 decretou-se a "Ata da Emancipa??o", que inclusive suprimia o caráter oficial da Igreja Anglicana na Irlanda.<br>  Somente o início do século XX conheceu a autonomia política da Irlanda. Em 1914, formou-se um parlamento e em 1921 após dois anos de guerrilha foi reconhecido o Estado Livre da Irlanda, membro do Commonwealth, mas sem a regi?o do Ultser, onde os protestantes representavam a maioria. O primeiro ministro britanico Lloyd George formalizava assim, a divis?o da Irlanda em Norte - "Ultser" (de maioria protestante e industrializada, totalmente em m?os inglesas, com capital em Belfast) e o Sul - "Eire" (de maioria católica e independente da Comunidade Britanica).<br>  <br>  Em 1948 a constitui??o do Eire foi modificada e o país tornou-se a República da Irlanda, rompendo com a Commonwealth. Apesar de apoiar a uni?o com o Ultser, a República da Irlanda reprova a luta armada e as a??es terroristas do IRA, sigla de Irish Republican Army (Exército Republicano Irlandês), for?a nacionalista que substituiu, a partir de 1919, os voluntários irlandeses, e da qual uma parte constituiu o novo exército do Estado livre após o Tratado de Londres (1921). Prosseguindo em sua luta contra o governo britanico na Irlanda do Norte, dividiu-se em dois ramos em 1969: o IRA "oficial", que condena o terrorismo, e o IRA "provisório", dominante na Irlanda do Norte, que pratica a??es terroristas sistematicamente, como forma de chamar a aten??o da opini?o pública internacional e pressionar o governo britanico, visando a soberania da Irlanda do Norte em rela??o a Gr?-Bretanha, e em última instancia, a integra??o com a República da Irlanda.|`|57d15e76443e3ea7e75930202501fdccaa	infelizmente eu n?o sei, mas esse filme é ótimo !!!|`|6b9cbe81d0e2937c684fe57842d782efaa	No google, nas comunidades do orkut, no cadê.<br>  No terra, na parte de cinema.|`|7fsqgILZaa	Google:<br>  <a href="http://www.google.com.br/search?hl=pt-BR&q=sinopse+%22em+nome+do+pai%22&meta=" rel="nofollow">http://www.google.com.br/search?hl=pt-BR...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.google.com.br/search?hl=pt-BR&q=%22roteiro+do+filme%22+%22em+nome+do+pai%22&meta=" rel="nofollow">http://www.google.com.br/search?hl=pt-BR...</a><br>  <br>  Aprenda a usar o o Google.|`|AA12005596	<a href="http://www.historianet.com.br/conteudo/default.aspx?codigo=103" rel="nofollow">http://www.historianet.com.br/conteudo/d...</a>|`|5f413a06bdb884773821fce7761c1441aa	n?o conhe?o

AA10337837	Hum. The 'simply faces with big eyes' comes from Osamu Tezuka, the FIRST mangaka ever :)<br>  He LOVED Disney's movie, so he tried to understand why he liked so much disney'characters! He has watched houndred of times 'Bambi', in order to understand what made their characters so real and so emotional. Then he undersood that the BIG eyes were what really made the animals touch his heart!<br>  So, other mankagas tried to emulate Osamu Tezuka!<br>  That's why manga have often european traits...also, Japanese hate their asian traits...there are a lot of changing-eyes operation in Japan and Asia in general :)<br>  Japanese prefere the European and American traits because they feel the necessity of being different from the others (just think of the school uniform...)|`|nuLstxIGaa	First of all, not all series are like this. Take InuYasha for example.<br>  <br>  Second of all, this is because Japan has had a lot of influence from America.<br>  <br>  I have noticed this too, but it doesn't apply to all anime.|`|44a1782bc5e450a2942922ba96f0c234aa	I noticed that too,I read somewhere that anime characters were drawn that way to convey more facial expressions.|`|4f60e3653d4065cba4f29a67a1ae0142aa	As far as I know, not all the characters are Asians, therefore, have different features.  I've also noticed that the big eyes thing is mainly used to portray children or innocent (as in pure) people.  It varies depending on the artists really. <br>  <br>  Now, this is my assumption, but having bigger eyes or different features might make it easier for the characters to display emotions.  Maybe the range is wider.. I don't know.  Just saying what's coming through my mind.|`|340ac725b5c654d554de0eddf5a92e91aa	that is why we are called round eyes|`|87GHJiSRaa	um, well, im not sure if some else already answered this the way i am, cause im to lazy to read the other ones, but, in anime, ive read that, the eyes were influenced from america, like micky mouse and betty boop, but the eyes also can mean, the niceness or evilness of th echaracter ( little eyes can mean mean, biger eyes mean nice and happy) and the third way of the eyes is that the littler they are the older the character is, the younger the bigger. ive also read, that the japanese characters in anime are to look like american due to the influences also, and then the characters that come from other places other then japan, can look like they have darker skin, as if the opposite.. umm.. i dont know if that answers your question or not, im just bored, sorry if it didnt..|`|NZMqEciEaa	It is believed this has resulted from the influence of American characters like Betty Boop ,Bambi and others by a man named Ozaki(I'm not sure of the name)in the early 1960's.This seemingly direct link to Caucasian facial features is not perceived as such by the Japanese,rather just a stylistic approach to the characters.|`|lbWRiYb2aa	i heard it's cuz asians like big eyes and they think it looks nicer and want 2 portray themselves looking nicer, no offence 2 asians, i love asian girls lol. i cud be wrong tho. Fullmetal Alchemist characters r european so everything fits even makes more sense 4 it 2 be in english since it's set in modern (other-worldly) britain.

O Bruce é um baita vocalista, e o Metal n?o seria o mesmo sem ele e a Donzela de Ferro.

O André é um ótimo vocalista também, porém fica faltando um algo mais, já que muitos vocalistas do metal tem o mesmo "estilo" de canto. O Rob já foi muito bom, e está na história como uma pe?a importante do metal. Porém, o que dizer do Dio? O cara continua com a voz perfeita, mesmo depois de mais de 30 anos de carreira! Cantou em alguns clássicos do Metal, como Heaven and Hell e Holy Diver. Esse é o cara, sem desmerecer nenhum dos outros. Abra?os|`|7Dun8Egeaa	Com certeza o bruce dickinson.N?o entendo muito de técnica de canto,só sei dizer que a voz do Bruce me agrada muito.|`|QbLkBlqkaa	Heavy metal de qualidade com certeza é com o Bruce Dickinson, basta ouvir ''Tears of the dragon''.N?o é à toa que ele é o vocal do Iron Maiden a melhor banda de heavy metal do mundo por mais de 20 anos.

Mas ele é do mal? N?o, nem um pouco...<br>  <br>  Gosto de Naruto... ele é hiperativo, as vezes até burrinho, justamente porque é muito ingênuo, mas é persistente, nunca abandona um amigo, nem que para isso ele tenha que dar sua própria vida... é um exemplo de lealdade e perseveran?a... e é muito bonitinho... <br>  Neste mesmo desenho tem o personagem Shikamaru... é inteligen... calmo, paciente... mas morre de pregui?a de tudo... o que n?o é nenhum exemplo de mocinho,rsrsrsr<br>  <br>  Gosto do Raito (forma japonesa de dizer "Ligth", com "r" fraco, como na palavra "para" -  Death Note ), ele é o principal da história, a gente fica na dúvida se ele é vil?o ou mocinho já que ele adquire um livro (o Death Note, onde pode marcar o nome de pessoa e a forma da morte dela), e usa para matar bandidos... e aqueles que come?am persegui-lo, como pessoas da polícia...<br>  Tem o "L" . (Death Note) que é o cabe?a do grupo de investiga??o, é um garoto hiper inteligente, mas cheio de esquisitices...isto n?o faz dele um mocinho bobinho... certinho...<br>  Gosto dos personagens "Mugue" e "Jin" do Samurai Champloo... eles s?o os mocinhos??? Nem sempre, embora sempre acabam ajudando pessoas que passam por suas vidas, eles matam sem dó aqueles que resolvem trope?ar em seus caminhos, ainda mais se forem arrogantes... Mas, mesmo assim, ajudam uma garota a procurar pelo pai dela e andam pelo Jap?o (na era Edo), enfrentando diversos desafios... Embora sejam os mocinhos, n?o usam métodos muito éticos... hahahah<br>  <br>  No fundo, eu gosto daquele personagem com a qual eu me identifico, vibro , sinto por ele... coisa de doido, ne?<br>  <br>  é isso...|`|07e1278db1924fdb54fd432fabb32d94aa	Prefiro os mocinhos, n?o gosto de gente ruim.

A certa altura do filme ele responde a uma pergunta da Lois (qual era o objetivo dele na terra, algo assim), e ele responde que era defender a vida americana..ahan..com certeza.

Esses vil?es que se afogam em alta piedade s?o muito sem gra?a, Magneto faz de raiva motiva??o p/ alcan?ar seus objetivos.

Bush diz que combate o tráfico mas no fundo ele dá mais dinheiro pros cartéis, diz que combate o terrorismo mas n?o acaba a Guerra no Iraque pois isso aumenta o ódio e as mortes naquele lugar, ou seja, haverá mais petróleo pra eles.

O baixo, a bateria e a guitarra da banda s?o muito legais, só que os solos dele n?o s?o muito indicados, porque n?o fazem um guitarrista evoluir muita coisa. Bom, n?o sei se tu sabe também, mas o estilo verdadeiro do Nirvana é o Grunge e n?o o rock.<br>  Também gosto de Nirvana, mas n?o sou f? que nem você né, só que aprecio muito o Dave Grhol (baterista) que toca vários instrumentos e tem uma voz massa.|`|PlKAGC09aa	Eu já fui.|`|SGSPkBgsaa	Indignada, eu viro sua xará quando alguém faz piadinhas de mau gosto com rela??o ao Nirvana, dizendo que eles n?o tinham talento. P?! Só porque Kurt foi considerado duas vezes o pior guitarrista do mundo (kkkkkkkkk!) n?o quer dizer que n?o sabiam fazer música!<br>  <br>  O Nirvana (queiram ou n?o) foi um divisor de águas na história do Rock ao lan?ar o álbum NEVERMIND. Antes dele a cena principal que os norte-americanos chamam de mainstream estava dominada pelo hard rock :Aerosmith, Guns (eca!) e companhia... Aliás, você sabia que Axl (racista e homofóbico) n?o se batia de jeito nenhum com Kurt? Uma vez o "senhor Sha- lá-lá" chamou toda sua banda e os seguran?as para surrarem Kurt, Krist e Dave. Que covardia, n?o? Ainda bem que n?o conseguiram...<br>  <br>  A mídia tentou fazer NIRVANA x PEARL JAM, mas Kurt declarou: " Nós n?o precisamos do Pearl Jam como inimigos se já existe a porcaria do Guns N' Roses". Realmente...<br>  N?o faz muito tempo, Eddie Veder (Pearl Jam) reconheceu que  talvez  sua banda n?o estaria no patamar que se encontra se n?o fosse o Nirvana que abriu as portas do mundo para o Grunge.<br>  <br>  Os jovens estavam cansados de tanta frescura em seus ídolos que se comportavam no palco como se fossem de outro mundo; ent?o surgiram Kurt e seus amigos se vestindo como um cidad?o comum para mostrar que eram iguais a todos . NADA DE GLAM ROCK CHEIO DE PURPURINA!<br>  <br>  Bom, eu vou parar por aqui sen?o vou acabar escrevendo um jornal - kkkkkkkkk.

uiGZ51alaa	A resposta está no AMOR...<br>  Os casamentos de antigamente, eram tbm, muito de fachada...havia traí??o, descaso, vida dupla, mas n?o se podia separar pq a mulher ficava marcada e mal vista, complicava na partilha de bens, essas coisas, ent?o se vivia muito de aparência, nem sempre os casamentos duravam pq eram felizes.<br>  Hoje em dia é mais aberto, tem mais aceita??o, embora ainda seja difícil, as pessoas aceitam melhor a separa??o.<br>  Casais que se separam fácil é pq n?o existe amor de verdade.<br>  Estou casada há 25 anos e temos o mesmo entusiasmo de antes, a paix?o ainda existe, somos felizes e temos um filho de 11 anos, tivemos crises, mas nada mais forte do que o nosso Amor...<br>  Bjs Lua|`|0c10e174608cf1be66e58cf7309cfc46aa	EXISTE.<br>  Abra?o.|`|e1a1e0157dc7732e2acd6e3e6b1d6ae8aa	sao raros os que resistem|`|pvBIfjiuaa	Acho que o casamento hoje em dia se transformou numa espécie de comércio,ou seja,as pessoas fazem trocas e existem interesses.ou numa parte dos jovens,morar junto ou casar- se acaba acontecendo muito rapidamente na fase:paix?o,portanto com as facilidades de hoje,no primeiro obstáculo,se separam e ponto final.<br>  Poucas rela??es acontecem estruturadas em uma base de amor incondicional e por isso, o casamento esta perdendo o seu valor essencial.<br>  Os valores morais mudaram e as pessoas desfrutam todo o tipo de possibilidades e novidades,o fator de as mulheres terem conquistado suas vidas independentes,já n?o as torna submissas aos homens,capazes de serem felizes e vencerem sozinhas.<br>  N?o é a toa que muitos dos homens estilo "mach?o" (machistas) acabem ficando sozinhos,n?o conseguindo uma companheira estável,pois nos dias de hoje,mulheres n?o se submetem a serem tratadas como servi?ais ou meros objetos.<br>  Aquele amor de "até que a morte nos separe" esta ficando cada vez mais distante da história real dos casais.<br>  Mas ainda assim acredito que muitas pessoas ainda conservem uma rela??o pro resto da vida.<br>  Um abra?o<br>  Gisele|`|CdqyW1pRaa	Existe sim!

349e02508ed17b57e323668991b5da53aa	Sim, como esquecer? Bons tempos aqueles, S?nia Braga ainda jovem, lembra?<br>  <br>  Garibaldo (Laerte Morrone) era um grande pássaro brincalh?o, que muitas vezes errava por ser teimoso e levado por n?o ouvir bem os conselhos de seus amigos. Fazia as coisas sem querer. Mas sabia voltar atrás quando aprontava e levava broncas, pois tinha um grande cora??o. Suas penas tinha a colora??o "azul indigo" (quase a cor do jeans) e seus olhos bem amarelos.<br>  <br>  Gugu era muito rabugento e fazia birra com todos aqueles que chegassem perto do seu barril, no canto do pátio da Vila Sésamo. Era um boneco feito de vários fios de l? verde musgo, tinha nariz azul claro e bochechas laranja. O temperamento e até um pouco do boneco se parece com o atual "Mau" do "Castelo Rá-tim-bum" na TV Cultura.<br>  <br>  E existiam os dois amigos Beto e ênio, que brigavam constantemente durante o programa. Ambos surgiram do Vila Sésamo original, com poucas mudan?as no visual dos bonecos. Os nomes americanos deles é Bert (Beto) e Ernie (ênio). O Beto, de sombrancelhas grossas e de pouco cabelo era muito chato e n?o tinha paciência de solucionar as dúvidas do bom e ingênuo ênio. No Brasil eles eram apenas dublados.<br>  <br>  Juca (Armando Bogus) tinha uma oficina dentro da Vila Sésamo, onde ensinava as crian?as a fazer brinquedos. Ele era casado com Gabriela (Aracy Balabanian) e viviam na parte de cima do sobrado principal. Ela, sempre sorridente, adorava fazer ginástica.<br>  <br>  A prima de Juca, a jovem Ana Maria (S?nia Braga) era professora e ensinava as crian?as a aprender e entender melhor as coisas do mundo. E o seu par romantico era Ant?nio (Flávio Galv?o), que sempre a visitava quando podia.<br>  <br>  O Funga-funga adorava cantar, mas tinha um sério problema: ficava triste porque n?o entendia porque os outros n?o o olhavam como gente. Mas dava para entender, já que ele era um gigantesco e tinha uma corcova quase do tamanho do Garibaldo. Era um grande boneco laranja que tinha duas grandes orelhas beges.<br>  <br>  Tinha também o Seu Almeida (Jo?o Louren?o), que contava muitas histórias para as crian?as em seu armazém.<br>  <br>  Tinha o Caco, o Pantale?o e tantos outros, assim como na vers?o americana (o "Vila Sésamo" possuiu muitos personagens, mas a base fixa do programa eram estes que s?o citados acima). <br>  Vamos cantar?<br>  <br>  Agora é para deixar qualquer f? do Vila Sésamo feliz. . Abaixo esta a letra de "Alegria da Vida", abertura de "Vila Sésamo". Relembrem:<br>  <br>  Alegria da Vida<br>  <br>  (Orquestra e Coro Som Livre)<br>  <br>  Todo dia é dia<br>  Toda hora é hora<br>  De saber que esse mundo é seu<br>  Se você for amigo e companheiro<br>  Com alegria e imagina??o<br>  Vivendo e sorrindo<br>  Criando e rindo<br>  Será muito feliz<br>  E todos Ser?o Também|`|4e95103679fb0b4b15d4eb65ff3dc86daa	Lembro sim, aquele sujeito desajeitado<br>  e emplumado.<br>  Ouvi falar que est?o programando a vol-<br>  ta do Vila Sézamo.<br>  Vamos propagar a paz que todos nós temos!<br>  Um grande abra?o, muita paz!<br>  Do amigo de sempre, <br>  Carlos|`|V2iC7OhHaa	claro que lembro, ele, sonia braga, que n?o era nojenta até ent?o...vc sabe que nos EUA, eles ainda s?o um sucesso e tem vários produtos deles...minha neta de 05 anos tem uma roupa deles que veio de lá...<br>  abra?os|`|d80099c1ca223b93f3bdbb82d186066faa	Lembro. Garibaldo era o passaro grande, todo emplumado, com um bico comprido. N?o dava pra saber a cor por que a TV era em preto e branco. Mas nas revistas onde o Garibaldo aparecia acho que eles pintavam ele de azul. Mas n?o me lembro dos detalhes do programa. Me lembro vagamente da atriz Aracy Balabanian e dos personagens Enio e Beto. Infelizmente n?o me lembro de nenhum detalhe nostalgico porque n?o assistia muito o programa. Agora se vc me perguntasse sobre Shazam, Xerife e companhia eu diria que me lembro bem da bicicleta voadora e do veiculo deles. Acho que a Camicleta era o veiculo que eles usavam, um tipo de jipe cheio de bugigangas.|`|AA12005596	Lembro-me dele. Ele conversava com Aracy Balabanian, que participava de Vila Sésamo. Até abri uma comunidade para Aracy, no Orkut. Ela foi minha Xuxa. Garibaldo sempre assisti em TV preto & branco, ele era cinza na TV. Era assim que eu enxergava ele, com as cores do cora??o. Tinha Gugu, tinha S?nia Braga, Armando Bogus. Recordo-me de todos eles. O come-come.. etc. Eita saudade!|`|3ac75f06d57bffeb61a739e9af717712aa	Eu n?o me lembro de detalhes nostágicos, só  dos personagens. O Garibaldo era um avestruz, n?o é?
