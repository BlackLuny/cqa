20090306135420AAA8pIw	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	Just Curious (Adult Eyes Only): Is a man who enjoys another man's touch truly gay?	Is a man who enjoys another man's touch truly gay?      There's this trick game show floating around. What they do is, they lure men to a bus, having a sexy woman escort them there and offer oral sex. If the guy says yes, he must wear a blindfold. While he is blindfolded. The girl is switched out with a guy and the guy gives the blindfolded victim head.      This theory is supposed to "unmask" gay men, since supposedly if they like it and dont notice it's a man, they're gay.   But this, to me, sounds almost as if it should be a crime. >_<      What do you think, is the victim gay or not?      Does enjoying a man's touch make him gay?
20090306140321AAvtbIn	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Other - Cultures & Groups	Why do people feel the need to accuse NA or AA of being a religion, or say it's not successful at saving lives?	Having recently been brought to my attention, I see lots on here and elsewhere about NA or AA, discouraging addicts from attending meetings. I do not speak for any fellowship, I speak only for myself. I do not promote anyone should attend a meeting. NA is a secular spiritual (not religious) program. In "It Works, How and Why," an NA book, it states the fundamental principles that no one can tell you what your higher power is (could be a chair, holds me up longer than I can hold it up), and no one can tell you how to communicate with your higher power.      My understanding of all this bashing of NA as religion is because religions hold precisely the opposite principle of dictating spirituality. I'm not big on the "g" word (god), but its simple, 3 letters, one syllable, never really meant the same thing to any two people; most members use it, its not remotely mandatory. This allows focus on how a higher power (any higher power) can save my life.      Oh, yes, omitted in all the ranting, and I don't mind the information, just the crusade mentality and propaganda, is any reference to the fact we are talking about people destroying their lives desperately seeking to stop. Frankly, the statistic that NA has only a 5% recovery rate is misleading. If you can quit on your own, good, then you've done it already and are not part of the equation here. It is probably more honest, if you truly know anything about this, to say that the disease of addiction has a near 100% success rate, for those of us who were not able to quit on our own.      The "disease" is obsessive compulsive disorder, which when when mixed with alcohol, crack, heroin, etc. can break out in jails, institutions, and death, and enjoy the despair, destitution and misery in the meantime while your chasing that next hit. The disease is not the drug, it does not matter what the drug is, and it does not have to be a drug, if it makes my life unmanageable.      Any addict who fortifies themselves against NA because of what they read on the web is doing what an addict does: finding an excuse to take that next hit. While it may harm others, if someone needs to rant and vilify and propagandize against AA or NA on the web to keep a spike out of their arm, AA or NA would not kick you out for it, so what kind of religion does that make them?
20090306141526AArnlzK	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Do you find that helping other people carry their burdens in turn makes yours easier to carry?	A monarch of long ago had twin sons. There was some confusion about which one was born first. As they grew to young manhood, the king sought a fair way to designate one of them as crown prince. All who knew the young men thought them equal in intelligence, wit,   personal  charm, health, and physical strength. Being a keenly   observant king, he thought he detected a trait in one which was not   shared by the other.Calling them to his council chamber one day, he said, "My sons, the day will come when one of  you must succeed me as king. The burdens of sovereignty are very heavy. To find out which of  you is better able to bear them cheerfully, I am sending you together to a far corner of the kingdom. One of my advisors there will place equal burdens on your shoulders. My crown will one day go to the one who first returns bearing his burden like a king should."   In a spirit of friendly competition, the brothers set out together.   Soon they overtook an aged woman struggling under a burden that   seemed far too heavy for her frail body. One of the boys suggested   that they stop to help her. The other protested: "We have a burden   of our own to worry about. Let us be on our way."   The objector hurried on while the other stayed behind to give aid   to the aged woman. Along the road, from day to day, he found others   who also needed help. A blind man took him miles out of his way,   and a lame man slowed him to a cripple's walk.   Eventually he did reach his father's advisor, where he secured his   own burden and started home with it safely on his shoulders. When   he arrived at the palace, his brother met him at the gate, and   greeted him with dismay. He said, "I don't understand. I told our   father the burden was too heavy to carry. However did you do it?"   The future king replied thoughtfully, "I suppose when I helped   others carry their burdens, I found the strength to carry my own."

Women seem to be much more individualistic when it comes to what they find attractive in men.

20090306181207AAf6no9	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Believer theology just doesn't add up. Why does popular theology seem so contrary to what Christ was saying?	Neither Christ nor the Apostles were speaking as though the Crucifixion was "good news for mankind." Quite the contrary.      I have been told that the Apostles didn't know the "good news" until the Holy Spirit zapped them over a month after Christ was gone... and yet he was preaching the Gospel to them for 2 years!      And moreover, he said to be saved you had to walk through the "Narrow Door." And of course he was already passing out the key to that door long before the Crucifixion. And he was sowing a seed that saves (Luke 8:11) and saying to the people at the Sermon on the Mount... "you are the light of the world!"      Christ gave every indication that the he was already passing out the key to the kingdom long before the crucifixion. How can believers be saying that the Apostles didn't know what was going on? They already had the Key to the Kingdom!      So why is popular theology so out of tune with what Christ was talking about? (Click on my avatar if you want more context)

20090306171340AAH9qXQ	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	ReligiousTolerance.org has an interesting report on Gay Teen Suicides. It seem to prove that.....?	ReligiousTolerance.org has an interesting report on Gay Teen Suicides. It seem to prove that Conservative Religion is responsible for the majority of gay teen suicides.      What can be done about this? The following is an excerpt from the Religious Tolerance website:   ______________________________________...      "Cause of suicides according to religious liberals, therapists, etc:   On the other hand, most gays, lesbians, therapists, religious liberals and mental health professionals believe that many of the individuals who commit suicide are motivated to end their life by their hatred of themselves as gays and lesbians.      This, in turn, is derived from the hatred of homosexuals and homosexuality which permeates society and which they internalized during their childhood.      Considering that:      Homophobia is largely based on religious beliefs which among Christians are derived from about 6 quotations from the Bible.   Three out of four Americans identify themselves as Christians   Most Christian churches have actively taught hatred of homosexuality for decades.      Conservative Christian churches are currently leading the fight to:   Prevent gays and lesbians from enjoying rights and protections equal to the general population, prohibit marriages for loving, committed same-sex couples,      Oppose adoption by gay or lesbian adults, and   Keep accurate information on sexual orientation out of the public schools.      we estimate that CHRISTIAN CHURCHES are responsible for at least 40% of the homophobia in the United States.

But also, i hate the thought of being the 'butch' girl and i find that my 'type' seems to be brown haired girls with fringes and big lips.....

Then there wouldn't be any more babies.  And he did like babies.      Anybody got more info on Jesus' ideas about castration?   .

I mean, how would Isaiah know there were "isles"  out there, having never ventured out of Israel/Judea?    I understand Isles to be maritime countries.

20090306212244AAgFWu7	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Which religion (if any) discuss out-of-body experiences?	Wow.  I found a link last night that kept me awake for hours.  I just rolled around in my bed and could not sleep.  There are verifiable and documented cases of people experiencing OBEs where they actually saw real things that they should not have been able to see.  Here's a link with a few brief snippets:    http://www.tim.nu/swe/chap7.html       This one really freaked me out:   "In one such case, also involving a shoe, a resuscitated patient recounted a NDE to Kathy Milne, a nurse at Hartford Hospital with an interest in such experiences. The patient described floating out of her body, briefly viewing the resuscitation effort and then felt herself being pulled up through several floors of the hospital ending up above the roof. Here she recognised the skyline of Hartford and also saw a red object on the roof which she identified as a shoe. The out of body experience then proceeded into a fairly typical NDE. Milne later told a sceptical resident this story, who later got a janitor to let him out onto the roof where he indeed found a red shoe."      I realize that there are biochemical and neurological factors involved, as well as error in both seeing and remembering details correctly, but to rule out a very obvious supernatural element(s) would not make any sense.  Which religion (if any) discusses OBEs?

20090306223226AAFTuK4	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Christians, answer the question If you REALLY believe. The bible take countless hours to read, this takes 2min?	Before I end for the night (I hope there is at least one intelligent reply when I get back) andto got the club, I ask this question to find if any of you (hopefully so) are open-minded and can be understanding of (not necessarily believe) other religions. First off I'm referring to the fictional character and not one of the signers of the Declaration of Independence. The reason I ask is because there are numerous instances where the writer of the film (Vincent Gilligan whom is American of European decent) makes clear through, unsaid, terms that he's connecting Hancock to the Egyptian religion, and more specifically Heru the Sun God (becaue Egyptian hieroglyphs reffer to Heru "meaning Falcon." It's only Horus in Greek after they remixed it). All of these things had to be suggestive, and not specifically stated, as the whole point of making a movie is to make $$$$ (tha dolla dolla bill ya'll. 650 mill worldwide to be more precise.) And producers obviously didn't want a boycott by religions world wide. Whether it be one of the following:   1: ornaments hung around Hancock's trailer (of eagles/falcons)   2: insignia on Hancock's beanie throughout the beginning of the film   3: the pictures that he draws throughout (not knowing that it's a subconscious thing that he doesn't consciously remember)   4: the insignia on the back of his uniform (given to him by Ray)   5: the HUGE eagle/falcon statue he WALKS by in the bank robbery scene   6: finally, if you look at the Hancock poster, you can even see the eagle/falcon flying past the SUN in the reflection of Hancock's (Will Smiths) sunglasses. I don't wish to play the, "what color was jesus card." because I'm NOT even reffering to Jesus. (so save it.) I'm speaking of a completely different religion. SO, my question is which one, of the following, describes how you feel after reading this?      A. Like the movie before, now (adding everything up) I love it.   B. Like it before but now (since they weren't reffering to MY Jesus type God) I hate it   C. Disliked it before but (now adding it all up) I like it   D. Disliked it before but (now that I know it wasn't MY Jesus they had in mind) I HATE it even more.   E. Just a movie and, regarless of my religion, I think the same about it today that I did when I first saw it.      10pts to the best answer who explains why!

20090306224257AAwuZV1	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Other - Cultures & Groups	Do North Americans have interesting accents to other countries?	When I hear other accents, whether they be English, Scottish, Irish, South African, Australian, Russian or Eastern European, etc... I obviously find their accents to be quite thick and interesting. And of course when I hear people from the North-Eastern U.S and Canada I find our voices to be quite bland and uninteresting.       My question is, aside from any quips that people like the English might have with our different pronunciation (I mean it is English, they have the right to lol, I knew a girl from Scotland who absolutely hated how we pronounced words), would my Canadian (Ontario) accent be interesting or unique to you? Or would you find it bland.      This question is really meant for people who don't have a northern North American accent, since we all won't find each other interesting.

20090306213015AAIhTNV	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Have any of my fellow atheists noticed....?	How similar Christianity is to the Covenant religion in Halo.  Because both have like a lot of violence because they felt it was important for their religion.  Also, they say that in the end of the world or Armageddon everyone is going to die while the good Christians will be saved, while in Halo, when the Covenant activate the ring it is going to destroy all life in the galaxy but they faithful will supposedly be saved on their "great journey".

20090306221150AAVP7nV	Society & Culture;Other - Society & Culture	How can i get over my hatred of women?	Ok i know i have a problem with women over the years due to not getting dates when asking them out, or hanging out with women when i ask to just lets go to the movies, so now i am just so fed up with them not giving me a chance and dont careless for them.. Anyways, last week i was with a friend who acrouse is a jerk to his girlfriend, i was driving them home from school and they started arguing in the back seat to the point when he started to hit her in the face a couple of times and broke her nose it really didnt faze me as i didnt even turn around to help her as she cried, because i just didnt give a damn about women at the time. And there was another time where i was walking home from the fun park and saw a guy, which i know i would beat him to death with me being 6'8 258 pounds and him very small hitting and kicking his girlfriend because she locked the key in the car. He basically beat her into the ground as i just passed by and look and kept on walking with saying anything because i just didnt care about saving her and watching this Rihanna crap i guess it is true that women like jerks, so should i continue being a jerk?

20090306220021AALzV95	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Isnt it unfair for nonChristians to go to hell if theyve never heard of Christ? Christians please answer?	In Christianity, all nonbelievers (those who do not believe in Christ and accept his forgiveness) go to hell when they die. But doesnt this seem a little unfair? What if someone was born in a part of the world untouched by Christianity? What happens to them? Why should they suffer when it is not their fault? Why does believing in something change anything?      Upbringing has a huge amount to do with religion as well. For example, a little muslim boy is born and raised in a muslim family in muslim country.To him (he is taught this all his life), Christians are infidels and even an enemy, so it would take an awful lot for him to be converted. Should he go to hell?       Can Christians and theologians please answer my question? what happens to this people and is this fair? This is for me the most difficult aspect of the christian faith.

20090306211713AAX1yOb	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	About belief in deterministic atheism?	does  deterministic atheism make any sense?      most atheists are determinists. they believe that we are merely the physical matter in our brain, and therefore we can't have free will, our brains just follow the laws of physics. Therefore, everything that exists today, inculde your beliefs, is just an ubroken chain of events leading back to the big bang.    However, in that case, the laws of the physics are set up in such a way that given a few billion years, hyrdrogen gas transforms itself into beings which believe in God.    So the same laws of physics that cause an apple to fall lead to the creation of belief in God. Why would the universe contain such laws?

He returns to the Philippines after studying for seven years abroad. He hears news/gossip about the death of his father, Don Rafael Ibarra. Don Rafael was sent to prison in connection with the death of a tax collector. Since Don Rafael stopped receiving holy communion for a long time, he was refused a Catholic/Christian burial by Padre Damaso, the parish priest of their town.      Crisostomo (let's just call him Ibarra from hereon) sees the lack of progress in his town and decides to build a school to teach and prepare his townspeople. Tandang Tacio (the old philosopher) notes that there have been many attempts to build a school in the past, but all these had failed. Padre Salvi opposes the plan because he is secretly worried that the school project will threaten the power he wields over their town.      Ibarra almost gets killed while he is laying the cornerstone of the school, but Elias saved him. Elias is the mysterious fellow who also saved Ibarra previously.      With so many powerful enemies, Ibarra eventually gets implicated in a staged revolution, and is hunted down by the guardia civil. Maria Clara, Ibarra's sweetheart, unwittingly adds to Ibarra's woes when she switches Ibarra's letter with another letter that reveals her true nature.      The guardia civil catch up with Ibarra, and drizzle him and Elias with bullets near the lake. Ibarra survives and buries Elias in the forest owned by the clan of Ibarra. The guardia civil think Ibarra drowned and died in the lake and promptly leave the scene.      Maria Clara thinks Ibarra really died, gets depressed, and enters the nunnery. She does not follow the advice of Padre Damaso to marry Linares.         P.S. I got this from viloria.com and I really need this translated into the philipino language. help, please? :)

20090306220208AA96oRs	Society & Culture;Other - Society & Culture	Why do people judge by weight?	I have been annoyed lately over how people can pass judgments over fat people. I am fat, 240 pounds, and have been going through a lot about how people can just be so critical over this matter. It's as though the persons character, personality does not stand  a chance when they are fat! Last month I had a guy who contacted me and we started talking for about a week, and he would often say I am very intellect, funny and very personable. He would comment on how pretty my eyes or lips are. However, the minute he saw a full pose picture of me, he started ignoring me. This really made me wonder..Do people think that over weight people do not have feelings? Does it matter to an extent that they would ignore all other qualities because of someones physical appearance?

20090306231647AAncoat	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	I have a question about the term "homophobia"?	Is the term "homophobia" a sign in itself that society doesn't care too much about intolerance of gays?      People who hate another for their race is a racist, not a "race-ophobe" Being racist is really looked down upon. No one wants to be a racist.      Someone who hates another person for their sexual orientation is called a homophobe, implying that they are merely afraid of something and that it is as legit as something like agoraphobia. Having a phobia isn't looked down upon.      Is this a sign that intolerance is tolerated? What should the word be changed to?

She was rude and ignored me when she found out I was going to another school for the next year. And other things...

20090307010631AAoWgba	Society & Culture;Etiquette	Why is it so difficult to speak and/or type properly anymore?	As a warning, this is more of a rant than anything, but I'd really love to hear your thoughts and see if anyone has any answer as to why we can't use common sense when we speak and type.      #1. "i undrstand dat wen u type like dis on a fone, it saves space..."      ...But why on earth is it so difficult for many to type like intelligent beings when they have a full keyboard in front of them without a character limit?      #2. "WHY IS IT NECESSARY TO CAPITALIZE ENTIRE SENTENCES WHEN WE TYPE?"   I suppose at least whoever does this sometimes uses punctuation.      #3. "Who is teaching kids grammar these days?"      Because they're obviously not doing their jobs. I'm really not sure where children develop proper grammar and sentence structure anymore. I don't think it happens, quite honestly. There is absolutely no excuse for phrases like, "I seen you yesterday."      #5. "Didn't we use to have typing classes?"      I was watching a guy type next to me in class the other day, and he was staring straight at the keyboard, hunting and pecking with ONLY his two index fingers. I wanted to take a picture. That was how ridiculous he looked.   When I asked him why he didn't like using the home row method, he answered, "What do you mean?" ...Sigh.      And finally...      #5. "Why doesn't any of this bother anyone else?!"      The only other individuals I know who are even remotely bothered by this are English teachers! Are we honestly okay with kids going around thinking that there's only one form of the word "two?" Or that it's okay to misspell words in a College Prep English class essay? Or that we don't care that they're mistaking text-speak for actual words?      Before you ridicule me for being an over-bearing and fussy parent, cranky and lonely librarian, or hated English teacher, I'll have you know that I'm a 17 year old senior in high school. Why does this sort of thing bother me so much, you might wonder? Here's why; it completely and utterly pisses me off that I have to consider myself part of the generation that will most likely tribute to the downfall of the English language. Yes, I realize that language and grammar morphs over time with societal changes, but can you honestly present to me a time when we could be more ashamed of ourselves for said changes?      I want to hear your opinions. Is there anyone out there like me who feels the same way about this? What are your pet peeves when it comes to the modern society and the English language?   Those of you see nothing wrong with how we conduct our conversations today, I'd like it if you were to explain why. I'll not close you out of this argument...even if you do sadden me.      If you made it to the end without scoffing and mashing the "Back" button, thanks. I'm glad you had the decency to hear me out.

He is famous today for he is known as the father of Mexico. He traveled to the North American continent and discovered Mexico and built Mexico city facing many problems on the process of conquering and taking possession of the land.   1499~1502 During this period of time, Hernan Cortes attended the University of Salamanca because his parents wanted him to study law to become a wealthy lawyer. However he takes no interest in law and drops out of school. This was when he began to take interest in expedition of the new discovered lands.      1519 - He arrives at the Capital of Aztec, Tenochtitlan. He doesn't receive any resistance from the people of Aztec for he is thought of as their god. He is given the riches of the Aztecs and served well. He also suppresses the town of Tabasco and meets a woman named Malinche who becomes his mistress, guide, and interpreter.      1520 He suspects that the Aztects are trying to kick him out of the Aztecs so he takes hostage of Moctezuma and makes him swear his loyalty to the king of Spain. In advance, to try to calm down the Aztecs, he frees Moctezuma, but they respond by stoning him to death after Hernan lets him go.      1521 - With the help of reinforcements from Cuba, he began to cut off supplies towards the Aztecs which destroyed their people. Finally, with the capture of Cuauhtémoc, the Tlatoani of Tenochtitlán, also the ruler, the Aztec Empire disappeared. Cortés was able to claim it for Spain, thus renaming the city Mexico City. From 1521 to 1524, Cortés personally governed Mexico
20090227035050AAopUQB	Society & Culture;Languages	Asking for revision from a foreign English speaker?	English is not our mother tongue. Although having learned English for a long time, I still haven't been to English-speaking countries. My daughter is going to have a English-speaking contest in her school. She wrote a script about describing a dream for the contest, and ask me to revise it for her. I am afraid that I used too many uncommon words for a G5 kid and inappropiate usage, or made some grammatical mistakes.       Asking for opinion of revision from university students or anyone good in English.      The following is her script.      --------------------------------------...      Good afternoon, teachers and schoolmates!      Today I would like to share a story of mine with you.       It was a sunny afternoon. My family and I rode bicycles together very happily. We saw and entered a castle with special pictures on the walls. It seemed that there were many stories in these pictures. There were many kinds of colorful fish in the lake of the castle and beside the lake were also colorful flowers and trees. The scenes of the castle were so strange that I thought there must be something wrong, and most of all, there was not any person.       After leaving the castle, I saw a forest where many animals lived. Suddenly a rhinoceros rushed toward us. I was scared by the roar and the rumbling of its steps, so we left in a hurry. Being sure that we were out of danger, I lay on a grassy lawn in the breeze. It was a very wonderful feeling enjoying the breeze on the lawn.      When we rode again, my brother and I were chasing each other. I rode faster, faster and faster. Then I felt that I became lighter, lighter and lighter. I was flying up in the sky! I could see higher and farther! I enjoyed viewing the beautiful green landscape, breathing the crisp fresh air and listening to the happy chirps of little birds.      Then I saw a splendid outstanding building. Wow! It was the famous Taipei 101 ! I had ridden from the country to the metropolis. In the meantime, however, the landscape was transforming! The tall green trees became tall buildings. The sweet scent of flowers became the foul odor of sewage. The happy chirps of birds became noises from the factories. The bright blue sky became dirty gray because of the automobile exhaust.      I felt that the air was running out! I could not breathe any more!      I shouted “Mother, Father and younger brother, where are you!”      Then I woke up. Oh! Oh! It was a dream, and my face was covered by a blanket! I could breathe again.      Although it was a dream, it gives me an inspiration: “we have only one Earth, and we have to protect it very well!”         Thanks for your listening!      --------------------------------------...

20090307002959AAxPAbj	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;People with Disabilities	Any aspies can relate?	I am a nineteen year old male with asperger's syndrome.  Before I went to college, girls often made passes at me or made sexual advances toward me.  Sometimes they touched my dick or slapped my a** or did something like ask me details about my body or suggest ways I could have sex with them.  I didn't care though.  Sometimes I touched them back, and occasionally we fooled around some (didn't go beyond that, though.  I'm still 100% virgin.  Never even done oral.)  Though I know for a fact that some girls found me attractive, I seriously doubt that was why they were doing it.  Probably just doing it to be funny.  Any other people with asperger's syndrome who can relate to this?  Does this commonly happen to aspies?  Do you think people try take advantage of us to try to get us to do something stupid, or just because they think we're naive and they can get away with it?  Do you think I made a fool of myself playing along with it?
20090306230350AAPJGfA	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Ok everyone. I need an opinion on something...?	A little background...   I was raised Catholic, and at the age of 13 decided I was Agnostic.  When I turned 16 I developed a firm belief in God, but was still not a Christian, being that I didn't believe that Jesus was the Son of God.  (I still don't believe this and never will)     I am now almost twenty years old and have began to question whether or not I even believe in God anymore.  I still do believe in Reincarnation, Karma, souls, etc.  However, I do not know if I believe in God.  Part of me wants to... but I feel like I just use God as my excuse for someone that still believes in me in such a lonely world.  I believe that we should all do good to one another in this life, I believe in past lives, etc.  But perhaps not God?  I am starting to see how illogical it is, to be quite honest.  But is it possible to not believe in God, yet still believe that we are Reincarnated?  I sound so stupid right now.  Am I turning to the atheist side?  Should I?  The past year has opened my eyes more than ever before.  There is no God.  No heaven or hell.  But there is an afterlife...  I guess that's my beliefs in a summary.  Help?  Opinions?  Advice?  lol.

20090307002905AAfOHzf	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Other - Cultures & Groups	If cuban americans are so successfull how come it is not more widely known?	They are and there have been numerous articles about. just google it. anyways, do the majority of people know this and don't want to admit or are they ignroant to the facts??. But let me clarify so that people understand. There are two sets of cubans in this country. There are the cubans that came to the us from 1960 to about 1975. Then there are the cubans that have flooded miami since 1980-present. The first set of cubans fled to the us due fidel castro's takeover of cuba. They were mostly doctors, lawyers and wealthy buinessmen. and contrary to popular belief the majority of these cubans were white. They were being persecuted and force to leave their homeland. They basically started in this country from scratch. Miami was pretty much built on the money from cuban imimgrants in the early 60's. No other immigrant group has being able to achieve the finacial status so quickly and successfuly as the cubans that first came here. Cubans are as finacially successfull as non-white hispanics, sometimes even more rich. And cubans are the most educated hispanic group in this country and can rival any anglo.      Now when you hear people talk about the loud and uneducated cubans who appear to be darker. They are talking about the cubans that came here from the mariel boatlift incident in 1980. Sadly people don't know history. Even cubans will tell you that there is a big difference between the early immigrants and the poor cubans that have to escape on boats.      I am not bragging or saying that cubans are better or what not. I am just stating a fact.         BTW I did not copy any of this. I wrote it all off the top of my head.         I am a proud cuban american and would like to erase cuban stereotypes once and for all      cubans like all hispanics can be any race.   cubans are not mexicans   not all cubans are poor and uneducated

20090306225031AAc72j8	Society & Culture;Etiquette	Neighbor insists I am playing music when I am not?	Hello!  I live in a condo building with my husband.  We have recently been having some issues with one of our neighbors.        The way the building is set up we share about 6 feet of wall with her.  In our condo, that 6 feet of wall is in our computer room, and on her side it is apparently her bedroom.      Now my husband and I tend to be night owls and are often up until 1 or 2 am.  When we are, we understand the concept of keeping our voices/tv low out of respect for those around us.  Especially after 10pm.        A few weeks ago, my husband was playing a game on his computer while I was watching the 11pm news at midnight (I have time shift channels and often don't have a chance to watch the news at 11).  I had the volume on the tv set at a barely audible volume (around 6 on my tv) which is 2 rooms away from the wall she shares.  My husband was not listening to any media at all.      At about 10 after midnight someone pounds on my door.  I get up to answer it and it's the lady saying that the music I'm playing is too loud.  I attempted to explain that I was watching news not music and she insisted that it was coming from our condo.  I apologized and turned the television off.  I then went to check my email before I went to bed.  10 minutes later she pounds on my door again.  I explained that there is no media being played.  She went back to her place still insisting there was.      Fast forward to tonight.  My husband and I are playing a game with each other.  I have not had any music on since the morning and the tv has not been on since about 8pm when the husband finished watching a movie.  11:50 rolls around and there's a knock at my door.  I get up and answer it, and it is the lady again.  Stating that I really need to turn down my hymn music that both my husband and I are singing along to.  Now not to knock hymn music, but I don't own any.  I don't own a cd player or tape deck or even a radio that plays music.  I do own 3 computers, one of which is my work laptop with no music on it and the other two each have a set of A4Tech headsets attached to them and no speakers.        I attempted to explain this to the lady but she insisted that I was lying.  She then told me that my husband and I are no longer allowed to live in the building and we better sell our condo quickly and find a new place to live.      What can I do to resolve this issue.  She believes that I turn *my* music off when I answer the door, only to turn it on when she leaves.  She refuses to believe that it could be one of her other neighbors (we can't hear anything in our place on the side we share with her).      Any suggestions would be wonderful and appreciated.  Thank you!

20090306231903AAxfHIz	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Other - Cultures & Groups	Just a couple questions to emo kids?	I feel like this is a good opportunity to do what I've always enjoyed, and that is ripping on emos and goths.  Here's some questions and observations for those who enjoy that kind of lifestyle:         Question:  How can you possibly consider yourself a non-conformist, if you dress and act the same as all your little buddies?  I have yet to meet any non-goth, non-emo type person that wore the same clothes everyday as I did.        Case in point:  There's a guy standing over there at the car wash near my house.  He's wearing a white t-shirt and blue jeans.  I'm wearing khaki shorts and a navy blue shirt.  He's listening to rap music through his car stereo.  I'm listening to Guns 'N Roses.  He's got a sticker on his car that says "vote democrat."  I'm a Libertarian.  A lot of conforming going on here...      Honestly, what is the social norm that you're trying not to conform to?  Can you really answer that?      --------------------------------------...      Question:  If my lawn were an emo, does that mean it would cut itself?  What is the deal with cutting?  I know there's a lot of emo's out there that say, "Oh, but not all emo's cut."  Shut up.  I'm not talking to you.  Now, what's the deal with cutting?  Does it give you pleasure?  Is it for the scars?  Why not earn scars the old fashioned way, by having something story-worthy cause them?       Case in point:  I would rather hear a grizzly bear hunter going on and on about the leg he's missing and the story behind it than to hear a whiny-*** emo talking about how they did it in the bathroom with a rusty razor blade.      Although, if my music sucked that bad, I'd probably cut myself too.      --------------------------------------...      Question:  What is it, exactly, that you have to be so depressed about?  Did your mother make you do the dishes?  Were you forced to stay after school because you didn't finish your homework?  Made to take out the trash?  Clean your room?  Did your mom or dad play sneaky winky with you when you were little?      Get over it!  If you're that concerned about the effect that your folks, society, or whoever had on your life, why not try getting some revenge by actually becoming a productive citizen?  Show that you're not going to let your past ruin you, instead of wallowing in your own self-pity.      Not good enough?  Considering suicide?  If your life is that bad, why not just end it all?  Surely you're not afraid.  Just do it already and get it over with, so the rest of the world doesn't have to hear you *****.  There are real people out there with real problems, and it is insulting to them to hear you whine about your crap when they've probably dealt with and overcome more in the last month than you have in the entire history of your existence.         Oh, and don't forget.  Jesus loves you.      Man, I am such an asshole.

The Adventures of Music the Ranger: The Fight for Prop 8      (November 5th, 2008. After Prop 8 passes)   DR. GAYMAN: Music the Ranger, why must you always muck in my mud? Oh look, I have a mask helping me too! We'll find out which one is more powerful soon enough!      (At SF City Hall, penultimate boss battle)   GAVIN NEWSOM: The doors wide open now! It's gonna happen... wheter you like it or not! So bring out the butter. I'm gonna make toast!       (Before entering the Supreme Court on March 5th, 2009)   DR. GAYMAN: So... you want to go a few rounds! When this is over, we'll see who is obsolete!      (After Prop 8 is upheld)   DR. GAYMAN: I'm sorry. This is the part where I'm supposed to be angry. Filled with rage. Insensed beyond belief. Once again, you have outsmarted and outspun my best henchmen. I should be rather upset, shouldn't I?   YANG-YANG: And in fact, we're furious! But we seemed to have overlooked one small little detail, you little delivery boy! Now that you have Prop 8 in your hands, all we have to do... take it from you!      FINAL BOSS BATTLE: DR. GAYMAN      (After Gayman is defeated and the sanctity of marriage is saved)   DR. GAYMAN: Defeated again! This is not fair! Maybe I should retire... to a nice, big beach, with a nice big drink.

20090505080342AA4XJwf	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Is it immoral to give thumbs down without even reading the answer?	There are some people here who (historically) answer questions in the most inane, uninformative way that I never even bother to read their answers before giving them a thumbs down. For example, when a question is asked about a passage of scripture that is unclear or a concept of God that isn't fully defined and the answer is a Bible verse, it's a thumbs down. Answers with a lot of uppercase words get a thumbs down. Answers from particular people (I think there are three so far and they're all hard-core Christian) automatically get thumbs down.      Presuming, as I do, that everyone is entitled to their opinion - and I very frequently offer mine whether it's warranted or not - does it make me a hypocrite for doing this?

20090227065105AA3E6cH	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	What is Islam? WHO is Allah?	If the muslims call themselves the law keepers of the Jewish G-d Yahweh, why are the ten commandments not in the koran Word for word?   Why Did Yahweh then change is name to Allah and create a whole new religion?    If God said that his word is sacred and holy why woud Mohammed take bits and peices including names and parables to create the Quran?    Did Yahweh not say that it was a sin to add or take away from the word of G-d.       Additional Details      ELOHIM is hebrew   Yahweh is G-ds name Meaning I AM WHAT I AM.   Yahweh did not give His name to Moses as Lord. Lord is a title, not a name; just like the word GOD is not a name. There are different kinds of gods, and each one has their own name. This is why Moshe said to Him, "Indeed, when I come to the children of Israel and say to them, ‘The Elohim (GOD) of your fathers has sent me to you,’ and they say to me, ‘What is His name?’ What shall I say to them?", for the God of Egypt had a name; the God of the Canaanites had a name, too. "Which God sent you, Moshe? Ammon, Anubis, Nimrod, Zeus?" So Elohim spoke to Moses in Hebrew and told him, "You shall tell them YAHWEH sent me." (Exod.3:15). For most churchgoers it does not matter what is what. But I'd say that those who do not care to know will die in their error.

The language of scholarship in Palestine in the Mishnaic period was Hebrew and the Mishnah itself is in Hebrew, but the language of the common people was Aramaic.

Has society learned that it's better or worse to take children out of the abusive homes & institutionalize them until they reach the age of 18?      I think it was more acceptable for people in times gone by to allow abuse because it just may have been a "necessary evil" that kept the old world concepts of gang mentality that came to America with the families trying to escape their homelands to our so-called "New World".      What are your thoughts on this topic of "Old World Mentality"?
20090307140614AAjNO5T	Society & Culture;Etiquette	What to do when the level of discussions in the office is low?	And I mean really low. At first, I said what I thought. Now, I only intervene gently if I see that they misunderstood stuff in a serious way. For the rest, I shut up and keep working. The truth is I am less conventional than some of my coworkers: I traveled a lot, tried many things, met people from various backgrounds, volunteered and so on. I follow world & major national news, listen to talk-shows and know about local cultural events. One colleague doesn't follow the news at all & another sometimes listens to the radio news, but the lack of information doesn't stop them from talking. I don't wanna seem superior or like I am showing off. They are generally curious of what I think, but the gap between how we see things is huge and I just don't wanna accentuate that.

When someone compliments me, I always blush(well since im african american it would, well, yeah u know..) and I say thanks but I feel awkward receiving it. It is not that I am not used to it it is just it is very uncomfortable. Maybe it is because I am way too modest aboout myself? I have  high self esteem so it is not that. =] Thank you!

Ok i know i have a problem with women over the years due to not getting dates when asking them out, or hanging out with women when i ask to just lets go to the movies, so now i am just so fed up with them not giving me a chance and dont careless for them.. Anyways, last week i was with a friend who acrouse is a jerk to his girlfriend, i was driving them home from school and they started arguing in the back seat to the point when he started to hit her in the face a couple of times and broke her nose it really didn't faze me as i didn't even turn around to help her as she cried and was kicking and screaming, because i just didnt give a damn about women at the time. And there was another time where i was walking home from the fun park and saw a guy, which i know i would beat him to death with me being 6'8 258 pounds and him very small hitting and kicking his girlfriend because she locked the key in the car. He basically beat her into the ground as i just passed by and look and kept on walking with saying anything because i just didnt care about saving her and watching this Rihanna crap i guess it is true that women like jerks, so should i continue being a jerk?

20090109161816AAjyh3m	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Which came first the chicken or the egg?	Trick question... They are both contingent. You can't have a chicken without an egg and you can't have an egg without a chicken. It is really a segway to an age old theological/philosophical question that is... It appears as though every witnessable thing in the universe is contingent in nature, that is it derives its existence from some previously existing source. So the question inevitable arises; "How does a universe consisting completely of contingent beings come to exist at all?"

20090307110341AACk7pD	Society & Culture;Other - Society & Culture	Is sexism getting worse?	I mean, nowadays i hear girls getting refered as b*tches by men all the time. They say something like "damn, look at those hot b*tches!" or "That b*tch is fly"....women are not dogs. we are human beings. sure, some women may act doggish aka b*tchy, but the female race in general is not. so why do we get refered to as b*tches? Sometimes even by other girls! and then if a girl overhears herself getting refered to as a b*tch and tries to stand up for herself...most of the time the guy will say that she really is a b*tch or say something like "d*mn, chill...what are you pmsing?"    most of the time i hear this by guys who dont even know the girls they are talking about, they dont know the girls personality, life story, ect, but they still call her a b*tch. why? or even worse, they refer to them as h*es. Guys may think its no big deal, but your basically calling women dogs (cause thats what a b*tch is), so youre saying that women are unhuman. that they are on the same level as dogs and other animals. i mean, would you want some random guy calling your girlfriend/mom/sister a b*tch? and how stupid does it sound if girls went around saying "Dang, look at that a**hole, He's hot!" or "I wonder if that a**hole has a girlfriend" talking about guys they don't even know. its just stupid. Why do most guys do this?

I am not a conservative, but am also not part of the great non sovereign    self-assured  culture elite.  It seems that from middle school on I have been force feed a menu of causes that I mostly don't buy without at least questioning.  I believe we live in a leftist pop-culture of designer ideas parading as lofty enlightenments. It's in news, school, film, music and TV, that one must somehow cipher through this muck to get at the truth of things.  Most all my friends are unquestioned liberals and seem to not see the overwhelming liberal slant on the world that has been my generations environment. If I even suggest that we consider the source of information being slanted I am excoriated.

Now I am not really into shopping unless I need something specific (aside from browsing in bookshops). But I am not really a fan of these massive out of town shopping centres (bluewater/ trafford centre et al)      These places have meant in lots of towns the heart and soul has been ripped out of the traditional high street. Lots of empty shops or maybe even worse lot of "pounds shops"      It is a joy to shop in a town/city centre that has both the normal good branches of high street shops and smaller specialist shops. For example Chester does this well and has a reasonable indoor shopping centre in the City centre.      These out of town places are impersonal and simply a result of an obsession with consumerism.      Thoughts? Defence of such places? Where do you like to shop?

20090307141816AAbURCM	Society & Culture;Other - Society & Culture	Does stereotypes annoy you?	I don't understand why people give themselves labels. I'm not saying I hate people like this - I used to call myself Punk, and i hang out with a load of emos. I don't necessarily dress like them. I wear black skinnies and colorful jumpers, but I don't listen to their music or have their hair cut. I would wear track suits like "chavs" do because they're comfy. I don't give myself a label; I'm my own style. People say that "chavs" are all the same - foul attitude, ASBO's, lots of make up, etc. But if you look at a group of emo's, they'll all look the same as well. Does it anger any of you when there's websites instructing people on " how to be emo?" Like the only way to be one is have that crazy back combed haircut or something. I love that style - I've done it before, but do labels annoy anyone else? (Chav/Grunge/Punk/Goth...) x

20090307142940AAk8O2E	Society & Culture;Holidays;St. Patrick's Day	Possible to face paint at St.Patrick's Parade in Boston?	I'm a freshman in college and about a year ago I bought about $100 dollars in professional face painting supplies hoping to get some practice and be able to do face painting as a side job but it never happened. But I really enjoy face painting and I was thinking about doing it when I go to the parade during my spring break. I'm not looking to make serious money or anything, and I just wanted to walk around and watch the parade and let people know that I could paint their face for a couple of dollars. I think it would be really fun but I have a couple of problems; I'm not sure if I will be able to do it without a table and chairs set up (are there places to sit around the parade? can I bring a table and chairs to the parade?). And also, I don't know if it is legal, or whether or not I would need some kind of license. If any body can answer those questions for me, or if you have an opinion on whether it is a feasible idea or not, or any tips, your feedback would be greatly appreciated.

Once everyone has got over his or her caffeine addictions, switch to espresso.    **Walk into a very busy person's office and while they watch you with   growing irritation, turn the light switch on/off 10 times.   **For an hour, refer to everyone you speak to as "Dave".    **In a meeting or crowded situation, slap your forehead repeatedly and    mutter, "Shut up, damn it, all of you just shut up!"   **Repeat the following conversation 10 times to the same person: "Do    you hear that?" "What?" "Never mind, it's gone now."   **During the course of a meeting, slowly edge your chair towards the    door.   **As often as possible, skip rather than walk.   **Ask people what sex they are.

I could report to management about it but she will find out it's me and become very violent and angry like she has with my other housemates before.
