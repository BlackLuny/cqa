That paired with some Gold Standard 100% whey protein before workouts, he saw about 30-40lbs in only a short period of time.. I think 6 months, which is amazing considering he has a fast metabolism..    If you wanna gain some mass man, do squats, deadlifts, bench, limit cardio, and make sure and eat 3000-5000 calories a day, depending on if you're training..    Also, sugary foods won't get you where you wanna be even though you think you'll gain weight..    When you workout, the refined sugars in those foods and artificial juices/sodas lower you testosterone levels.. basically meaning you won't produce as many hormones to gain size.. Squats are the most mass-building exercise so I'd try some of those and see how they work for ya..    A diet somethin like    8am: 1 whole egg/ 3 egg whites, protein shake, 1 cup oatmeal, 2 cup watermelon    9:30am: cup of blueberries and a tuna sandwich    11am: Cliff builder protein bar    1pm: 2 cup brown rice, 8oz chicken breast, 6 asparagus spears    3:40pm: 2cup brown rice, 8oz chicken breast, whey protein shake    6pm: peanut butter sandwich, banana    7:40pm: 2 cup brown rice, 10oz salmon    10pm: mass gain shake, 2 handfuls of green grapes      I'd try to get all your protein, fiber, carbs, and healthy fats in..    I workout when I eat this much, but after working out if you wanna see size, add some carbs like potatoes or brown rice.. carbs spare protein, and instead is used as energy, and also help fuel your muscle building process..  if you didn't eat the carbs, protein would be burned instead as fuel and you wouldn't have anything building your muscles..    good luck on the size, stick with it brother|`|w6QXlMP1aa	make your own...    whey protein 30g  superfine oats 100g  cup of berries/banana  1/2 pint of whole milk    800 calories...give or take.      for an extra calorie kick, add in some peanut butter.
MIAMBVD4aa	Reduce your time in the gym. When building muscle, more is NOT better. Muscles need time to rest and recover before they will grow for you. 3 or 5 days a week is the most you ever need to be at the gym, with an hour and a half tops each time.    Give your muscles plenty of rest. Your muscles need time to heal in between workouts - the average person needs a week in between workouts before the muscles have recovered enough for another workout.    Get plenty of rest yourself.|`|0I9Fm00Naa	Give the muscles you work out a day to rest ,before exercising them again, I usually work my upper-body 3 day's a week and the lower-body  for the 3 day's between, make sure you eat healthy , And that your calorie intake contains less than 30 % fat.Drink plenty of water and keep yourself hydrated.|`|Z8d9ipxmaa	More than an hour of exercise a day is excessive - it does harm rather than good, because it wastes muscle. Eat a high protein snack after exercise to repair muscle.
Z8d9ipxmaa	In time the fat should reduce, but bare in mind fat storage places are controlled by hormones, which you can't alter. Some people find it difficult to loose fat from certain places, and are unhealthy when the areas where they do loose weight easily get too slim.     Fast weight loss usually doesn't last long term. Loosing weight rapidly causes the metabolism to slow down, and the body becomes primed for weight gain. Try to drop the weight steadily, so your metabolism stays high, your body expects the changes as a stable weight, and the it stays off long term.    To loose weight, the basic rule is eat less, exercise more. You should loose weight by eating 500 calories less than what you'd need to maintain a healthy weight. The average man needs 2500 cals daily. So if you consume 2000 and do 45 mins to an hour of exercise everyday, you should loose weight.     You need to eat enough carbs so your body can function without fatigue (otherwise you won't burn fat optimally in exercise, you'll slow your metabolism and prime the body to store carbs when you stop dieting). Just don't eat too many, otherwise they'll be stored as fat. Too much of anything can be stored as fat.   150g of carbs daily is the ideal amount for the average man keeping a healthy weight, so eat about 100g to loose weight. Go for wholemeal versions, and eat potatoes with their skins on; these are low GI (steadily released, keep metabolism higher).|`|E3yOmel9aa	When belly fat will not go away with diet and exercise the only thing you can do is liposuction.  For your height and activity level you should be eating more calories in a day.|`|a7fc3089d9e7ba174faf16c6aa239694aa	Forget your average cardio routine.  I suggest interval training.  You can look it up on the net.  It is cardio that your body cannot adjust to.  By tricking the body constantly with interval training you will start to see a drop in weight.  If you are already doing interval training then I would suggest heavy weight training consuming the same calories you intake now.  You should be taking in about 2000 calories a day.  Any less than that and you might not be feeding the muscles.  Your diet should be 30% protein, 55% Carbs and 15% fat.  Your carbs should be nothing white.  No white bread, no potatoes, no white rice, no pasta.  Go for whole wheat and whole grains.  Your fat should be the good fat.  Avocado, olive oil, nuts and protein shakes which have fat in them.  Heavy weight training at 6 to 10 reps with heavy weight will build muscle that in turn will burn fat off.  Alot of rest and alot of water should do the trick.|`|jSKfz3R4aa	its a sign of cancer  hahaah im kidding  we all know cancer is a joke|`|yagl1sOcaa	Roma wasn't made in one day... just keep working out|`|A3HObJUeaa	I really think the problem may be that you're not doing ab specific exercises. Cardio, while helpful in burning calories and increase your general fitness, does very little to help fight that tummy flab. And weights simply work your muscles, primarily arm and leg muscles. What you need is to come up with a routine that really involves your stomach and ab area. My absolute favorite for an all over AWESOME body workout, which really targets abs and hips is to do Carmen Electra's Fit To Strip disc 2. Although you would think these DVD's are targeted for women (which the first one is...) this second disc doesn't involve stripping moves/routines at all (the first disc does though) and it would certainly be suitable for men and women. It is a workout with Carmen Electra, but she's using a trainer in it. He's phenomenal! I would recommend this DVD to anyone looking for any kind of work out. I seriously couldn't even finish all the workouts, it's very intense. Plus, what guy wouldn't love to work out watching Carmen? Come ON! LOL

Rk46lIBwaa	I am only going to repeat Rhianna's valid concerns in support of her answer.     Dianette is not licensed as a contraceptive pill, although it functions as one, and should never be prescribed for that reason alone. As its data sheet clearly confirms it is only to be used for (a) severe acne, refractory to prolonged oral antibiotic therapy; (b) moderately severe hirsutism.     As she rightly points out it has twice the clot risk of standard pills and, assuming it is being used for the appropriate indications, doctor and patient must understand that this risk is justified before it is prescribed.    It is also clearly stated on the data sheet 'It is recommended that treatment be withdrawn 3 to 4 cycles after the indicated condition(s) has/have completely resolved and that Dianette is not continued solely to provide oral contraception.'|`|9cba094486c6e7ab49a59ac5ea44682faa	In the UK Dianette is only prescribed to those who are looking for a solution to acne and who also require contraception -it should never be prescribed just for the sole purpose of contraception. Dianette has a much higher risk of DVT than other contraceptive pills.    I have my reservations regarding Dianette. As I said above, it has a much higher instance of DVT than other contraceptive pills. With other contraceptive pills the DVT risk is about 25/100,000/year. With Dianette it is about 50/100,000/year- the same DVT risk in pregnancy.    Many GPs are reluctant to prescribe Dianette and the favoured contraceptive choice for acne management is now Yasmin. Unfortunately some Drs fail to explain the risks of Dianette to patients before prescribing- I trust your GP has already explained the risks to you so you are aware?    The prescribing Physician must explain Dianette's risks to the patient and the patients' agreement must be noted on their medical file. 5 years is indeed a long time to be taking this pill- if it hasn't yet had any effect on your acne, it isn't going to. If it has resolved your acne then you really shouldn't be taking it. Speak to your GP again.|`|OgaJqkSQaa	I can't answer this, and I don't think doctors can either. I was on it for five years for mild acne, and when I came off I had a horror story. I developed severe acne on my face, neck, chest, back, arms and stomach. I put on a stone in weight I'm usually very tiny (just over 7 stone) so it was a lot for me. I developed coarse black body hair, and was diagnosed with pcos. I think it was a reaction to coming off that pill, and I wish I'd never taken it. I had a break for a few years but my symptoms got worse and worse so I was forced to go back on it. But it didn't work as well the second time round, and my acne was still bad enough to be offered roaccutane by a derm. I now have added Spironolactone and wish I'd never got into this mess.  But it doesn't happen to everyone. You might be fine if you decide to come off.  My suggestion would be swap to a bcp such a yasmin or yaz. If you want to stay off the pill, do some reseach on the herbs vitex (agnus castus) and saw palmetto. Google Spironolactone as it's a very good alternative to Dianette. It's not a contraceptive but it's an anti androgen and is good for acne.  Check out reviews for alternatives on acne.org
NPzDQmlQaa	One thing that brought my dieting and losing weight out of the plateau I was in so long was the Acai Berry.  I was stuck at my weight loss goals and this brought me through it and made me lose a lot of weight.  So in my opinion it helped me lose weight tremendously.  I know a lot of that dieting stuff is expensive but I found a free trial of Acai Berry(I think it only cost me like 7-8 bucks at the time for shipping.)  The site was http://starturl.com/efblc -  All I did was try it out for a month and I was sold,  I saw the results I wanted to and like I said I was in that plateau with my weight loss.  This kicked it up a bunch.    Good luck and I hope this helps.|`|ypGtSfZqaa	I guess it depends on where you live - but it shouldn't be a problem getting it at a store.

Because it is so hot right now I am sure that they are not letting anyone else sell it.  It may cost them more to allow others to sell it then selling it directly.  I tried to find out if there were a store that sells it but cannot.
Rk46lIBwaa	I am sure Rhianna's diagnosis is correct. GORD/GERD ( gastro oesophageal {esophageal} reflux disease) is the likeliest option.    It might be worth your while going to your GP for a 'Breath Test' or the slightly less reliable blood antibody test, for Helicobacter Pylorii. Both are quick simple tests to exclude the 'ulcer bug'.    Antacids may well reduce your symptoms as may a number of mechanical measures. These include being no more than your ideal weight,  taking small meals, not eating late at night, and elevating the head end of the bed.    In the longer term, you may need regular acid lowering drugs called PPIs ( proton pump inhibitors) to keep your symptoms at bay. Your GP will discuss these with you.|`|9cba094486c6e7ab49a59ac5ea44682faa	This sounds like acid reflux/heart burn- antacids should sort the problem out.|`|kXmsT70zaa	Sounds like acid reflux.

rypsRNs0aa	I am afraid to say that I had 3 brothers who died of Lung Cancer, they were all heavy smokers.  Their symptoms were very different.  One of them had pains in the back of one leg which his Doctor treated for months for Sciatica, it turned out he had bone cancer by then but original cancer was in his lung. He never had any other symptoms and felt fit as he had stopped smoking for 4 years before.  The second one had breathing problems and was instantly out of breath when doing some minor task. the 3rd one had a very bad cough, never went to a Doctor and chocked to death while coughing. Sounds gruesome but is true.  X-ray could show a change from the previous X-ray and any change would have to be investigated further with a CT scan.

As other's have said your periods can be quite irregular and change when you are still young.  Even older women experience changes in their cycles.  There are many things that effect it.  Physical activity, stress, emotions, eating habits, and our health is a major factor.  The reason a lot of the symptoms associated with pregnancy occur is because of hormonal changes in our bodies, hormones are also responsible for other things in our bodies the major culprit of similar symptoms being our mentrual cycle.  Many women get cravings and tender breasts and abdomens at different points in their cycles.  These are due to hormones, not necessarily pregnancy.  So don't worry.

So just be patient.|`|bfb88160853edd441f13c069712a5c16aa	Menstrual bleeding lasting more than 7 days or bleeding that is much heavier than usual is called menorrhagia    There are many possible causes of menorrhagia, including:  ?hormone imbalance, the most common cause (the imbalance is sometimes caused by improper use of hormone medicine)  ?polyps, which are growths on the cervix (the opening of the uterus) or inside the uterus; polyps are usually noncancerous  ?fibroids, which are noncancerous growths in the uterus  ?endometriosis (uterine tissue growing outside the uterus)  ?a cyst (a sac full of fluid or blood) on the ovary  ?use of an IUD (intrauterine device) or birth control pills  ?cancer of the uterus or ovary and sometimes cancer of the cervix  ?chronic medical problems (for example, thyroid problems, diabetes, and blood-clotting problems)  some medicines, such as blood thinners  stress.  http://www.med.umich.edu/1libr/wha/wha_m...    I give you the full list, but since you're 17, I would think that you wouldn't have cancer.  So it's probably one of the other things.|`|WlTlYMJxaa	wow thats unnormal..    are you taking any medication that would prolong your bleeding??      thats the best think i could think of  then again all womens menstural cycles are different..    you should try a different doctor|`|ph8lttZBaa	Go to another Doctor!!|`|AK7rEpl8aa	I would go to a diffrent doctor getting a second opinion is always great|`|u8IUPlECaa	Aiee, get to another doctor! In fact you should go straight to a walk-in if you can. Don't worry, i'm sure it'll be fine, periods can be weird. and I agree, I think your doctor sounds like a right moron|`|89Qejqx0aa	well, this happened to my sister and she was fine.......but she isn't regular so if ur regular already and it happened I would see a different doctor because it could be bad|`|DEkQe6Zpaa	YES go to a different doctor!  Long or heavy periods could be a sign of Anemia.  Might wanna check it out just to make sure!!|`|rxIx8K1Yaa	I would be pretty upset if they did nothing and gave me no answers. My advice to you would be to see another obgyn. I would be worried if I was you too. There a few problems that could cause this and you should get checked out by a doctor that wants to listen and help. Some just don't care. It's sad.|`|r1nKp9ELaa	hmmmm well thats not normal. i say go to another doctor. maybe the gyno. i guess you just have to wait it out till then. its not like they can do anything magical to stop it but the can put you on birth control so it wont happen again|`|l7vDiKDzaa	It could mean that you have fibroid cysts which can be removed or possibly you're anemic and need iron.  You definitely need to see a GOOD gynecologist.  I had this problem some years ago|`|STjfxYfDaa	This just happened to me last month. I was on my period for 27 days. I've never had a normal period though.. There was nothing I could do but wait it out. I would try a different doctor.
8e35cfeded3c3b900607388410347b4caa	Lower means your heart can push more blood with less effort, and thus doesn't have to work very hard when you're not doing anything.    Note to tis me:  Mine is high 30's to low 40's.   There's nothing wrong, although it panics doctors and nurses who don't know me (or about my triathlon training).|`|ec76af399c519dad926a10430304f541aa	lower|`|aXnVFFUkaa	lower|`|gXt0wdLuaa	72 is average. about 50 means you are extremly fit. lower than that means there is something wrong. more than 100 means you are unfit.|`|8RQCa3SXaa	Lower, although people with a lower heart rate tend to have a lower metabolism too. (unless they are just really fit, and have alot of muscle)    and some are prone to fainting attacks, as a result of low blood pressure.
Rk46lIBwaa	It makes no real difference either way, since they don't actually work.    In fact 2 in 3 so called dieters who try for a quick fix or look for something to lose weight for them actually end up heavier, ( University of California study 2007).    Diet + exercise offers the only hope I am afraid.|`|MJt1xeQ7aa	i bought some hoodia tablets before and they are rubbish! they do not take away ur appetite or make u feel less hungry!! i took one and my belly was rumbling 20 minutes later. dont waste ur money and do what i have to do now! join a gym and eat well.|`|JSEYLvaHaa	The real Hoodia, the Hoodia which works (as discussed on the BBC and CBS) is available from us.    In the last 3 months - 92% of our customers re-ordered.    Yes it's a little more expensive than the 'fake Hoodia products' but that makes sense. Real, unaltered, pure Hoodia is scarce and expensive to cultivate. But it's worth it because the results are incredible.
1TPGdaXJaa	It can be an ugly and serious withdrawl period. You should seek professional help if the addiction is serious.|`|AA11209233	It depends on the person and their addiction.  And for most people, the addiction lasts longer than the habit.  It isn't that hard to clean yourself up and stay off it for a few weeks.  Not going back to it is usually the greater challenge.|`|207dFmdHaa	depends on how long and how much you are taking. You cant do it by yourself, you can get very sick. You need to go thru rehab....it sometimes only takes 7-10 day with help to get off of it, but most people go back in less than a month abusing it again|`|DQHK6vWSaa	it depends on your habit. How many milligrams you take a day and how long you have been addicted are how you can know how long it will take to be clean. My friend took about 200 mgs a day for a year and a half and he went to detox.they gave him subutex for about 5 days. I think he started @ 4 mgs of subutex every 4-6 hours and was tapered down over the 5 days. After those 5 days you will be pretty much clean but you will probaly suffer muscle cramps and pain in your bones for maybe a few weeks. The big thing though is the mental part which will last longer than anything physical, although the mental part of the disease differs from person to person, 99% of the time the mental part is the main problem. You just have to be mentally strong and really, really want to quit, with 100% of you focus on staying clean.
HMhUKAgkaa	Well, to be honest, any form of jumping is difficult exercise but is amazingly good for you! Keep it up! Try different kinds of jumping exercises like jumping rope, ski jumping (jumping side to side with your legs together and slightly bent), hop scotch, pogo stick, jumping jacks, etc. It's fun!|`|0f775e26d3587f949c9ef9e1e099d45caa	u have to start somewhere,just keep adding to the length of time u do it each day n you'll soon get up to half hr|`|aXnVFFUkaa	increase your time by 2 mins everytime you skip and you will find it becomes easier|`|jw6Lpt37aa	please don't skip eating  you can eat carrots and cucumber slices that contain a very little calories and will make your stomach full for long time and try to eat normally and in between eat the snacks this will help your metabolism to work and lose weight quickly
AA10766729	Men have a very minimal formation of breast tissue and a few glands.  Men CAN contract breast cancer, but I've never heard of men being able to nurse (primarily because the body would need to produce a hormone to stimulate the milk glands, and that is only produced during pregnancy).  Men CAN form overly large breast masses, a condition called gynocomastia.|`|u8IUPlECaa	Actually I have read that some men can lactate O_o but yes in a way, they do have nipples.

Xsa3pd2jaa	the best way to get defined abs is to add wieght to your crunches. you dont want tone antmore you want definition. start holding wieght an front of your chest. as you get better move it to on your head then finally behind your head. i do these on a decline bench. work great. also leg lifts and hanging leg lifts are good for getting your lower abs. regular crunches wont come close|`|jw6Lpt37aa	to tone your abs you need to cut the intake of calories with workout this will make your abs firmed and toned no exercises alone can do the magic 6 abs packs

They offer all procedures on a sliding fee basis depending on your income, etc.  For future reference they also have the morning after pill available.

Good luck!|`|89Qejqx0aa	never had an abortion never plan on it but thats your choice......try planned parenthood|`|oMna3EOnaa	Yes, of course you can they are done on the NHS though so you will be put on a waiting list, i have had one done by them they are very understanding and it was done in my local hospital which i was referred to by my doctor, if you don't want to face your gp you can still have one done you will just have to find a clinic that does them on the NHS, Marie Stopes have loads of clinics everywhere that do them so have a look on the website. Good Luck Hun|`|pD329JO2aa	yes NHS|`|GCm6wlSZaa	I do believe that women can have free abortions, but I don't think they're very safe.

Sorry to hear about this, you need to get some advice from a planned parenthood, a friend, family member, womens clinic somewhere you can have time to think about your decision, how far along are you? it depends on this, it is totally your choice and no one else's you need to remember that, no one should judge you on your decisions in life because you are the one that has to live with them, i hope you get the help you need and make the decision you need based on yourself and your fetus.    Good Luck girl on whatever happens, and i wish you well.|`|0OUcJvYJaa	i don't think there are free abortion places but most places have pregnancy crisis centers who will help you decide what is best for you and get the help you need whether it is keeping the baby or putting it up for adoption or something else. please reconsider before you abort, there are millions of people who would love to have a baby and can't. you could make one family very happy.
XHnpraaxaa	Why are you screaming?  First off you have to be over 100 pounds over weight before this surgery could be done.  This is a requirement by all insurance companies. Do you know how many people die from this surgery or have health problems after?  Do you know this is just another form of a diet.  After surgery you will feel so sick you won't be able to eat so you will loss but within a few years if you do not stay right on this diet you will have the same problem you have as today.  Surgery is not an easy way out.  Changing your eating habits is the only way to go. Also your surgeon will want you to loss weight before he will touch you to see if you have it in you and make sure you are in some what better health before surgery so he can get you though it.    Make changes in your life that you can do forever.  Do not pay for anything like pills or drinks.  Most taste like crap and are not healthy for you.  Stay with healthy foods like lean proteins, veggies, fresh fruits.  All diets are Eat Less, Exercise More, and drink your water!|`|Vk4mZi5Yaa	Eat    Sleep|`|LFlr6n6Aaa	why you wanna go for a surgery :( you can get what you want wthout getting your self under knife . well i was at the same stage about 3 months ago then a friend suggest me to try acomplia 20mg and i have lose 20 pounds in just 40 days and i am still using it , its safe and give fast results give a try may be that can help you . here you can get it with free shipping .|`|cPRuJQ1Paa	I had my weight loss surgery through Forerunners Healthcare Consultants in India I don't regret it at all I had a baby since then and I'm still able to take the weight off so far i am very happy. The key is to use a reputable surgeon. You want to be carefully screened beforehand to make sure you are a good candidate. Since my surgery I can walk without getting tired, I can play with my son; I can walk down the street with my head held high. I feel pretty for the fist time in years. I was given another shot at life. The surgery is a tool and how well that tool works is up to you!!    I would do it again in a heartbeat. I would recommend to every one who is suffering from the same problems as I did before but I would urge anyone who is interested to seek the best surgeon possible and make the decision based on the surgeons recommendations and your own personal goals!! Make sure the reasons for the surgery are the right one. The surgery isn't for someone who just "wants to be skinny". Do it for your health, for your life, for family. FOR YOU.

3059c69d713a3b3f99a4757099599918aa	The thing is generally you already have good abs. What you need to do is lose a bit of weight. Crunches and work outs don't define your abs they only strengthen the muscles for actual use. I would suggest jogging or running of some kind. It strenghthens your entire body including the abs, keeps you fit, and helps you to lose weight so you have more defined abs. Just remember you don't have to work out the abs you have to lose body fat.|`|369e91b88a719de2a84f6529dcc1a5e3aa	Try to google your subject and see what ideas they put out there. I'm sure there are many that you could do at home.
lypA8ATeaa	Try Lenscrafters online.  They accept almost all vision plans.      There is also a program called "FrameConnect" that allows VSP doctors more variety in what type of frames they can offer.  Perhaps you can research that and find a doctor who is synced with that program.
8NPXQerUaa	That's part of the answer.  The other part is that in addition to suppressing appetite, lots of small portions increases one's resting metabolism.  It also makes nutrients available to the body as they're needed, instead of forcing the body to store them for use hours or days later.|`|aXnVFFUkaa	yes you wont feel hungry if you eat lots of small meals|`|369e91b88a719de2a84f6529dcc1a5e3aa	This is the reason why.....I'm not hungry if I eat every 2 hrs.
XFlb3zlSaa	this question is going to depend on how people set their standards. people are most likely going to say no to this question because they do it or they see it as natural. religious people may say you are. whether it's wrong or right everyone tries it or gets addicted sometimes. but it is a good idea to have it under control. a doctor will most likely say that it's natural and that sometimes they might even recommend it. in my opinion psychologically i believe it can kind of create lust. so just make sure your thoughts are under control. like if you have a gf or a wife. then don't think about anyone else. but like i said. it depends on your moral standards|`|7d281f9b4fc45d76f68621de3af55bc7aa	You bet your sweet Bippy, Bubba!  You're hooked!  You'd better figure out how to disengage yourself from that garbage before you get so wrapped up in it you can't perform without it.|`|u9RwzLPnaa	No! I knew guys that masturbated 3 times A DAY! You're only doing it 3 times a week. Call us back when your doing it 5 times a day and then we can talk about addiction.

I bet the masturbation is the answer.  Porn only helps with the masturbation.  Normal addiction, not a problem, just a healthy male.|`|FttLjeWYaa	No. Masturbating is natural.|`|rd6eRnzTaa	not at all. It doesn't matter how many time you masturbate, even in a day. The only time it matters is if you are beating it so much that you can't get a job and have no friends.|`|3e342b4c35254658976e2faf3d9365f0aa	Below average I would say, go easy on the porn, it can get out of control.|`|VIRmI5ozaa	everybody needs to get horny once in a while  mayb cuz u probably dont have someelse to get you horny  well all i know is that i masturbate alot and ima girl!!!! and have a b.f too    get a girllll|`|CLB32006aa	If you cannot stop then you are may be psychologically addicted but, you cannot become physically dependent on masturbation or pornography.|`|IM3QwSS2aa	no. this is the addiction: watching porn in the a.m. before going to work; waiting to get off from work and then when you do - porn, porn before bed that's the addiction.    /Jerome|`|4PK0hiWeaa	No, twice a day isn't even.

Wait no longer than 30 mins after eating to throw up. (& make sure you brush your teeth rlly good afterwards..)  & you just need to throw up once after eating. Don't make yourself throw up any more than once or it'll just be acid and $hit and nuthn more. You won't gain any weight. :)    Xx|`|tpG1KBj4aa	uhm instead of throwing up, start a 1200 calory diet- wat healthier.

AHk1r9wbaa	I really don't know how these people are trying to help, but listen man..    If you wanna get your bench up, you gotta work for it.. have you ever heard the term, You gotta eat big to get big? Well it holds true in strength and size..    You wanna get your bench up, you can't just do bench all day everyday.. You gotta space your workouts to twice a week, with 2 days in between in you wanna see any results.. back-to-back days seem like a good idea but will wreck your results with over training..    If you train anywhere near a hard intensity rest 72 hours instead of the usual 48..    Also, if you wanna badass chest and a bigger bench, you gotta work all your weaknesses.. this includes things that help support your body, like..    Grip: With some added grip you'll see a huge different, try doin dumbbell wrist curls  Arms: Being able to handle more weight on your arms is a good reason to wanna do some bicep curls, some chinups, maybe some dumbbell pullovers  Triceps: The main muscle you work.. tri-extensions and close-grip bench help.. Dumbbell bench and varying it with incline/decline/flat bench will work both parts of your chest a lot more..  Back: Your back is very important..Think of all that weight you lower and your back has to support it when you're benching.. If you have a weak back, not only will your bench be weak, so will your posture and you will look disproportionate.. try some deadlifts and different variations of rows.. pulldowns/pullups will boost them, just make sure you feel it work your back with light weight, otherwise you're not working your back, just your shoulders..  Shoulders: Shrugs.. handling more weight on them will see some gains too..    And a very important part, your core.. Doing stability exercises like placing both hands on a ball and doing pushups, or doing the plank for 2 minutes.. If you can't do those, or twenty nice, good-form pushups I wouldn't bother with the bench yet..    If you wanna see some strength, do 5 sets of the heaviest weight you can lift 5 times on bench.. then do some incline dumbbells 3 sets of 6-8 for some added size/strength..    5-8 reps build strength, but I wouldn;t do them very often  6-8 reps builds size AND strength  12+ adds size..    Also, adding squats with bench will boost testosterone and you'll see some changes in your strength..     Just make sure you eat enough calories or your muscles won't repair, especially protein/carbs after a workout.. somethin like a whey shake and some potatoes or brown rice..    Eat big, work hard, and you'll get what you want.. Stick with it brother, everyone started at some point and they sure weren't all benchin their body weight..|`|Cp502oJNaa	you should be able to bench your weight at least but if you cant use body weight exercises like push ups|`|4582a857fe73584c0fff40c4f1537198aa	It's not that you're weak it's that your arms aren't used to that kind of activity since you don't do it often.|`|0rpN2419aa	Maybe you started out with too heavy weights.  You need to start with what you know you can lift to build up your strength.  Gradually build up to the heavier weights and you can do it!  Good luck and keep at working out on the weights every day.|`|rT1UfftQaa	Benching your body weight is quite a feat and takes time and dedication.  Don't put so much pressure on yourself, especially if you've not lifted before.  When I first started lifting I could bench press 95 lbs maybe 10 times, but that was long ago, and I can now exceed my body weight in bench press easily.    Weight training takes time and dedication.  Don't expect instant results.    As for your arms being weak, they typically will be the weakest link in your lifting until they are strengthened.    I suggest visiting www.workout_run_box.com and checking out the weight training programs they have there, including the "Bench Blast Off" which has information on the best routine to boost your bench press.|`|0I9Fm00Naa	Its not the weight your bench pressing that counts, the technique is what will help you the most. Try to do it with the proper technique and the strength will come to you , and you won't have to hurt yourself trying. I weigh 156 lbs and bench press 325.25. Time , Patients, healthy diet , and a day to rest between workouts will go a long way in  helping you to obtain Your weight lifting goals. I work out 6 days a week: mon. wed. and fri. are upper-body tues , thurs, and sat. are for lower-body workouts. Iam 54 years old and have been working out for 38 years.|`|GzHKUeNXaa	You're 6'1 and 162 pounds. You are TINY. You won't be able to bench your body weight itll you gain some more muscle weight.    I'm 5'5 163 pounds and I benchpress 325.    but I'm also 8 inches shorter then you. The rule of thumb is add 7-10 pounds for every inch you add to your height. Reverse. so if you were my height you would weigh around 95 pounds.|`|rsnuqTfzaa	do lighter weight 12 2 15 times each every other day unless ur really sore u will see good results. im 16 125 pounds i can bench 210 pounds its all about comitment u can only get big if u set ur mind 2 it
qfvqOHnyaa	go to the gym|`|Bt7asQEVaa	I am also a vegetarian and some great healthy snacks are Kashi granola bars. They are low fat and taste great. to tone your arms i would just lift weights. do sit ups to tone your tummy
8RQCa3SXaa	Its about the right amount of calories, but you need more carbohydrate. A bowl of cereal (weetabix or cornflakes, no sugar) with a piece of fruit or yoghurt would be far healthier, as you're current breakfast is mainly water-based. (fruit and veg is 60-80% water, depending on what it is) and the dip is likely to contain too much fat for your stomach in the morning.   This way you would also have more energy.    Hope this helps (:|`|7vk4xoKZaa	Its an ok breakfast but try adding some good whole grains for more energy. Like oatmeal with fruit and flax seed or some whole wheat toast/english muffin with whatever on it. Bananas are great for breakfast and snacking throughout the day. You could also add lemon to your water it helps clean out your system. There are many breakfast ideas to choose from out there. Try switching it up a lot so you don't get bored. And remember breakfast IS one of the most important meals. It starts your metabolism for the day and gives your brain fuel to start you off. Have fun with your choices.|`|aIYNCnedaa	Hard boiled eggs is a good source of protein and a banna would be perfect|`|Xsa3pd2jaa	every morning i have 4 eggs with a bannana and a glass of milk.
ikm8hJYZaa	Eat high quality chocolate.Very effective.Speaking from personal experience.      Cocoa rich chocolate.Cocoa contains natural substances that reduce stress and pain and create a feeling of pleasure in your brain and increase your brain activity.How long effects last depends on how much you consume.Only a few pieces of high cocoa chocolate reduces your pain,anxiety or stress for most if not all day.Lindt exellence is my recomendation.The best chocolate you can buy and affordable to most people.You can find it in any store with large selection of items.The applications of cocoa are very wide ranging from consuming it before a dentist appointment to reduce pain and fear from the drill.It is very effective.    A 50g bar costs around 5$ to my estimate.    Only high quality chocolate will have the highest effect in small amounts.|`|GbDAfs5Yaa	This is what I do.  I do something nice for myself...take a nice warm bath, take myself to a movie or out to eat or buy myself something I want within my budget...do something nice for yourself or sit down and watch a funny movie or show that you like, also a nice cup of tea always helps.|`|bc440202ee9d2423974a61a0588cabf7aa	I play MMORPGs like World of Warcraft and interact with other people online.

But really, get away from the computer, walk some where. Maybe just go a sandwich, walk... bike... heck even just going to the car might start to work. You need to get your blood flowing and you will start to pick up... the more you exert yourself the more endorphins you will pump which will help you on the right way. Then all you need to do is laugh, at something.    If you aren't too self-conscious I suggested the running and jumping randomly because you will probably start to laugh at yourself for being odd in public, but if you can't do that just watch some funny movies or something.    If you can, add friends to any of this, family works too, heck any one will help catalyst it...    Just tell yourself you will be happy, and whatever happened is in the past now so you move forward.|`|1a5be627b850e833c95c0e781eaac7a1aa	Aw, sweetheart.  I hope you feel better soon.    Lately I'm having a long drawn-out job search, and it can really pull me down.  Here's what I do!    --Write about it.  Sometimes venting helps.  --I love crafts.  Making something makes me happy!  --I call my Grandma!  Grandparents and other family members always want to hear from you.  And old people sometimes get lonely, so it's a great pick-me-up to talk to them!  --Bake something yummy.  --Get out of the house!  I live in a cold climate, and sometimes I know I'm spending too much time indoors.  If it's too cold to enjoy the outdoors, go shopping or people-watching.  --Watch a stupidly funny movie.    --Count your blessings.

iAv9P3HTaa	here are the best exercises for hard core abs:    Side Bends    * Holding a dumbbell in you right hand, stand with feet shoulder width apart and your knees slightly bent.  * Place your left hand behind your head and slowly bend sideways to your right lowering the dumbbell down to your knee.  * Return to an upright position and repeat for the desired number of reps.    Medicine Ball Sit Ups    * Lie on your back with your knees bent and feet flat on the floor.  * Hold a medicine ball (choose a 5 pound ball to begin) to your chest and have a partner stand at your feet (not on them).  * Push your lower back into the floor flattening the arch and hold.  * As you curl up throw the ball to your partner. Hold the crunch as your partner catches the ball and throws it back to you.  * Catch the ball and slowly return to the start position.  * Tip: Don't sit right the way up as you wait for the return pass. Your shoulders should be no more than 6 inches off the floor.    Weighted Curls with Medicine Ball    * Lie on your back with your knees bent and feet flat on the floor.  * Hold a medicine ball (or weight plate) to your chest (start with 5 pounds).  * Push your lower back into the floor flattening the arch and hold.  * Curl up just enough to lift both your shoulders off the floor a few inches.  * Hold for a count of 2 and return to the start position.    Cable Crunch    * This exercise requires a triceps pushdown machine with a rope attachment.  * Knee down in font of the machine holding the rope just above your head.  * Slowly crunch down to your right knee and hold for 2 seconds as you breathe out.  * Return to the start position slowly and repeat to the left knee.    Abdominal Exercise Guidelines  Perform several (3-5) abdominal exercises 3-5 times a week. Start with exercises and repetitions that are comfortable for your fitness level and as you improve increase the number of repetitions. You do not need to do all the exercises; simply select those that work well for you and vary your routine over the months.|`|gmvW9cvEaa	Eat the right foods, and gain the right knowledge, dont waste too much time in the gym, make sure you understand fully the correct way to do your workouts to maximize your build! check out the blog below also, me and my brother ran into it about 4 or 5 months ago, you just have to read it.|`|jtz1WFQsaa	For starters, you need dedication and persistence.  Abs and pecs don't spring up over night.  You need to start first with implementing a healthy diet - no junk food or high sugary, fatty foods.  And...    Abdominal: crunches, sit ups and oblique muscle exercises - LOTS of them.  I'm sorry, and yes they suck - but there's no way around them if you want abs.    Pectorals: Push ups, pull ups, weight/strength training.     I've included two web links to my answer you might want to check out.  They really helped me.  Good luck!

8RQCa3SXaa	If you really do eat 800 calories a day, then you must have an extremely low metabolism and find it hard to burn off fat.|`|YSoBO3tpaa	thats pretty good... hopefully only ten lbs...|`|BYzCfzVZaa	Its impossible to calculate a number given a metabolic analysis is needed.|`|LABVwWKraa	your BMI is in the healthy range. But with the way you are going with your calories is extremely dangerous. Over time, your body will go into starvation mode and slow all your processes down, and it will hold onto every little bit of food (energy) that it can because  it thinks there is a famine. with this diet, you will probably stay the same weight, or slowly gain some more.  You need to eat at least 1500 a day to keep all your processes going at a healthy rate, and you will probably lose weight.   But, you really shouldn't worry about your weight or get hung up on it, it's not healthy, and everyone was made differently and all our goals in life, as human beings, isn't to see how thin we can get. We should all learn to just be happy with our bodies, and have healthy body images. The media sure as hell doesn't help with that.|`|0Ngi2keVaa	well your body will think it's starving because you need at least 1000 calories a day to survive. and when our bodies think we're starving it makes it harder for us to lose weight, because our bodies try to hold on to our fat. I'd up your calories to 1000 and work out 5 days a week and you'll get better results. You could lose probably 8-10 lbs.

Why not instead of learning how to cause vomiting you would learn how to stop overeating or binge eating by recognising and controlling your emotions, changing your eating habits and finally - changing your life???  There are plenty of reasons why we overeat: stress, fatigue, boredom, emptiness, confusion, anxiety, jealousy, loneliness etc. Once you realise it, you are on the way to success! Don't start a diet or this useless bulimia - start a new life!!!!!!!! You know what you want. Go for it.    Feeling emotions is natural. We are all human beings. But you have to find other ways how to deal with them. We cannot always get what we want, that's life.. But we can sooth our emotional explosions in other ways, e.g. taking a bubble bath, talking to a friend, go for a walk, read a good book, learn how to dance or sing, WHATEVER YOU WISH! If then you will listen to your body instincts and eat what it tells you to (what BODY tells you, not your brain), eat mindfully and stop once you feel your hunger is gone - you will be thin. I will repeat that - you WILL be thin!    It also seems like you don't love yourself at all. As if you want to punish yourself or revenge to yourself... But that will not do, darling. That is not the right way to achieve anything in your life, including a good sexy look. You will be dead before you are thin enough if you become bulimic.   If on the contrary you will treat yourself with love and tenderness like a child, then your eating patterns will definitely change to ones of a naturally thin person.     About your relationship with mum - it is clear that YOU are not allowing her to take care of you. She wants to be closer, wants you to feel her love or as you are getting older, she does not want to let you go. That is why she is "feeding" you with food, either because of the aforementioned reason or because she does not know an alternative way to express her feelings. And when you refuse, she perceives it as a refusal of her love. Try to tell her more often that you love her and like what she does, love when she smiles, anything what is suitable!! Hug her more, touch her hands more, try to find time to have a friendly chat with her or go for a walk or to visit a cinema.     By now, I would strongly recommend you Paul McKenna's book "I can make you thin" (He can, trust me!)    AND    online programme http://www.shrinkyourself.com  You can subscribe to a free programme, which will help you to understand what reasons lie within your eating disorder and help you to understand your emotions and suggest a new way of handling them. Once you subscribe, you will receive a weekly articles to your e-mail address, which "speak right to the heart".   If you wish, you can join chargeable intensive programme. This is definitely worth doing it!!     But whatever you do, you need to speak with a professional in addition to the aforementioned. There is no reason to doubt in their ability to help you. I have a few girlfriends who suffered from anorexia, however, despite the severity of their diseases they were successfully cured. (And are now naturally slim and healthy).

As to iron intake, most women under 50 need 18 mg. per day of iron. It's not good to take any more though, unless your doc has said you need it.  Also, store vitamins out of reach of children.

So th difference isn't that big|`|AHk1r9wbaa	It's 95 on each side because the bar weighs 45 and you can lift more, usually, on barbell bench..    Your strength should be higher on the barbell because the added strength of both arms, and your core isn't focusing on 2 seperate weights, just one smooth motion on one weight.. You can get more on the barbell, even if it's only 5 or 10lbs on each side, you can..     It might have something to do with your grip, or how far down your going.. Shoulder width apart is best. And you should go down to your chest on both exercises..    keep up the good benchin brother|`|P3MLLjCRaa	First off, 25 lb plates on either end of your typical olympic lifting bar will either total to 100 or 95 lbs. Now I must say that your case is kind of unusual. Dumbell bench is harder than Barbell bench because it takes more coordination, balance, and strength to lift and stabilize the dumbells. For example I can rep 160 for sets of 8 (Barbell), but I can only do about 120 lbs for sets of 8 (Dumbell). Your body might just be used to dumbell bench and not used to barbell bench, especially if you just started benching with a barbell.

P3MLLjCRaa	If you can't get up one time than you have to start with some assistance. Stand on a chair with one leg and use that leg to help you do pull ups until your body is strong enough to do them unassisted.|`|iEHdNepJaa	Grab something, preferably a bar or some sturdy object located a small height above your head. Grab on with both hands, and pull, thus moving your body up.|`|BYzCfzVZaa	pull up|`|b959c1bacc75d8acf50a00e99fc88981aa	Heavy Rowing will help. Pullups are mainly a back exercise, so you can sabotage your technique by trying to use too much bicep.    Make sure that your breathing is large and relaxed (don't hold your breath; you need the oxygen), arch your back as if trying to lift your nipples to the bar (NOT your chin), and think about pulling your elbows down so that they will touch together behind your back.    If you can do some pullups, but not many, then the best thing you can do to improve your performance is to make each movement as 'full' as possible. Descend to a relaxed 'dead hang' position, and rise as possible so that you can touch your chest to the bar.    If you can't do any, try to increase the weight you can move on the Lat Pulldown pulley machine. When this matches your bodyweight, you'll be able to pull the same weight up to a fixed bar.|`|0ac58ca0197c7e667aca099936d121d3aa	You might need to stick to pull-down machine for a while. At least until your arm and upper back muscles get strong enough to muster a pull-up. In addition, what I found helpful in the past, is the negative pull-ups. What you do is stand on a chair in front of a pull-up bar. Then, while holding the pull-up bar with both hands, get your neck over it. Now, from this finished pull-up position, descend slowly (try 5-8 secs.) down. When you lower yourself that way, you'll feel your whole body working, trying to balance itself. This is very different from the pull-down machine, which only works arms and upper back. After you are done, climb back and do another, until you are exhausted. At that point, take around 90-120 secs. (you need more rest, because you are trying to get stronger at this point, not gain muscle or lose fat) rest and do another set. You should probably start with chin-ups (reverse grip pull-ups) or neutral grip pull-ups they are usually easier to perform.

If so, there are many things to consider.    First, what is your sleep hygeine like?  Here are some tips to improve sleep hygeine.    1.  Try to go to bed the same time every night.  2.  Do not fall asleep on the couch or in front of the TV.  When you feel tired, go to bed.  3.  Try to avoid stimulating activity before bed.  Instead, do some leisure reading or listen to soothing music.  Video games and/or exercise right before bed are bad for sleep.  4.  Try to avoid eating spicy foods or caffeinated beverages before bed.  Also avoid stimulating medications like those with pseudoephedrine.  5.  Avoid smoking or chewing tobacco before bed.  6.  Once in your bedroom, make sure it is dark and quiet.  No TV's in the bedroom.  If you sleep with someone who snores, well....    Other things to consider:    1.  How long does it take you to fall asleep?  2.  Are you waking up frequently? And if so, how long does it take for you to fall back asleep?  3.  Is it restful sleep?  Do you feel refreshed in the morning?  4.  What time do you wake up?  What is the total amount of sleep in hours?  Most of us need about 7-9 hours of sleep to become fully rested.  5. Do you snore?  Do you wake yourself or others up with snoring?  Do you stop breathing when you sleep?  Do you wake up with a headache? These may all point to sleep apnea as a possible contributor to poor sleep.  6.  Are you taking naps during the day?  A 5-20 minute cat nap may be helpful during mid afternoon, but anything longer could disrupt your sleep cycle.    These are just a few things to consider before approaching your doctor about sleep problems.  Most of the time, just altering your sleep hygeine can be helpful.  Sleep apnea, narcolepsy, excessive daytime sleepiness, or sleep-behavior disorders should all be treated by a specialist of sleep medicine.  Medline Plus has some helpful links for you to browse.

You'll lose weight, but along with fat, a good percentage of that weight loss is going to be muscle.  Also, this few calories can trigger your body to go into starvation mode which actually inhibits fat loss in the body.  This combination can actually lead to you gaining even more weight back once you go back to a normal diet.    You should try to consume between 1300-1500 calories a day spread over the course of 5-6 meals.  This keeps your blood glucose levels up and will help you feel more satisfied.|`|020c8b995f845d51e6a78d1ec529d405aa	You are not eating enough fruit for one thing and your breakfast is pretty poor.

nSp1GmaWaa	MIra primero es fundamental que revises, cual puede ser la causa de tu insomnio.?Porqu te pregunto esto? Porque el insomnio se puede deber a muchas razones, puede ser por estrs, por exceso de cafena por malos hbitos al dormir, por eso sera necesario que medites acerca de su origen. En general la mayora de la gente sabe porqu no puede dormirse cuando no lo hace, pero hay personas que no tienen la menor idea de que es lo que les causa el insomnio. Si t eres uno de estos ltimos te sugiero que: !o Medites acerca de cuando comenz y trates de localiazar la causa   2o Tratar de tener buenos hbitos para dormir:  ?Qu puedo hacer para mejorar mis hbitos al dormir?    He aqu algunas cosas que usted puede hacer para ayudarle a dormir mejor:        *Acustese y levntese a la misma hora todos los das, inclusive los fines de semana, a pesar de que no haya dormido lo suficiente. Esto entrenar su cuerpo a dormir de noche.      *Establezca una rutina a la hora de acostarse. Haga lo mismo todas las noches antes de acostarse. Por ejemplo, tome un ba?o en tina con agua tibia y luego lea durante diez minutos todas las noches antes de acostarse. Pronto, usted establecer una conexin entre estas actividades y el sue?o, y el hacerlas le har sentirse con sue?o.      * Use la alcoba slo para dormir o para tener relaciones sexuales. No coma, hable por telfono o mire televisin mientras est en la cama.      * Asegrese de que su cuarto sea oscuro y que no haya ruidos. Si el ruido es un problema, use un ventilador para   enmascarar el ruido o pngase tapones en los odos. Si debe dormir durante el da, cuelgue cortinas oscuras en las ventanas o pngase un antifaz sobre los ojos.      * Si an est despierto despus de tratar de dormir durante 30 minutos, levntese y vaya a otra alcoba. Sintese en silencio durante 20 minutos antes de regresar a la cama. Haga esto tantas veces como sea necesario hasta que logre quedarse dormido o dormida.  Por ltimo puedes ir al mdico para que te recete pastillas pero antes de esto trata de probar con la melatonina, es un remedio natural, se trata de la hormona del sue?o o sea cuando sentimos sue?o es porque nuestro cuerpo nos pide descanso entonces se eleva el nivel de esta hormona en nuestra sangre, esta hormona es la responsable de hacer que nos quedemos dormidos, por lo que te sugiero que adems de la rutina mas arriba detallada tomes un comprimido de melatonina antes de la hora de dormir.  Si nada de esto te resulta tendrs que ir al mdico para que te realice un chequeo pues la causa puede ser de origen fsico o psicolgico.  Besos y Mucha Suerte!!!!!  Que resuelvas tu problema!!!!!

My take is that it is best to savor a good smoke via a pipe.

YYycnXXuaa	First of all, put the scale away and take out the tape measure. Take all your measurments. And instead of trying to maintain a number on a scale try to maintain the number of your measurments.   You don't say which kind of diet you were on.   If it were adkins or some other diet where you've got to deprive yourself of certain foods, try switching to a reduced calorie/portion diet, like weight watchers. You don't need to give up anything, you just need to reduce the size of your portions and when you eat fattier foods, supplement them with low fat/ low cal foods, to make up the for the extra intake of calories. It's one of the easier ways of dieting. It's a lifestyle change, but it doesn't force you to give up anything. It just teaches you to eat right, control your portions and recognize the difference between eating for hunger and eating out of boredom. Even if you're at your desired weight, you can start WW at any time to maintain your current weight.     Also you need to add a daily workout regimen, try to do some toning 2-3 days a week and walking or running about 3 days a week.   WW can also help you track your activity. The more active you are the more calories you can take in without worrying about gaining.    Good Luck!|`|94fec27ff257b9c0ad61eefc98b2b503aa	Just gradually increase your calories until you start to notice weight gain.  Then stop and try to change your lifestyle to only eat that much.

Vedrai che ti s'aprir un mondo nuovo, pieno di luce, di gioia e la fiducia in te stessa, man mano, aumenter.     Coraggio.

Lo que s se sabe es que antes, en la poca ms lejana de los primates, las cosquillas se usaban como vnculo social (que cositas...)  Pues simplemente las cosquillas se producen por el roce de cualquier objeto (una pluma, una tela, etc.) y producen una reaccin nerviosa.  Nosotros podemos sentir cosquillas en muchas partes del cuerpo, los perros, por ejemplo, slo en las almohadillas de las patas (xo creo que no les gusta...) aunque no somos capaces de hacernos cosquillas a nosotros mismos, porque el cerebelo predice la sensacin y lo emplea para cancelar la respuesta...

La ms aceptada es que es un sistema de autodefensa del cuerpo que nos permite reaccionar cuando algn tipo de insecto se mueve por nuestra piel (ara?as, etc...). En ese caso, el cerebro da la se?al de alarma y el cuerpo responde rpida y enrgicamente.    Sin embargo, aparte de esta posible explicacin que podra remontarse a los albores de la humanidad, las cosquillas tambin se relacionan con los animales sociales, ya que se ha observado que los monos tambin se hacen cosquillas dentro de un mismo grupo como medio de estrechar vnculos.    As, podemos ver cmo las cosquillas siempre se las hacemos o nos las hacen personas cercanas a nosotros: padres a hijos, parejas, amigos, etc... con lo cual podemos ver claramente que se trata de una manera de socializar. Si no estamos convencidos de este extremo, probemos a hacerle cosquillas a un extra?o y nos daremos cuenta que la reaccin no es precisamente positiva.    Volviendo a la pregunta original, la sensacin de cosquillas est relacionada con la sensibilidad de la piel. As, la gente que no tiene cosquillas puede tener bien una piel poco sensible o bien un frreo control consciente de la sensacin de pnico y risa descontrolada que viene asociada con las cosquillas.    Cuando a un individuo se le hacen cosquillas, por lo general no las espera y por ello no controla la sensacin. Este punto se reafirma con el hecho de que es imposible provocarse las cosquillas. Aunque el movimiento sea igual, el control ejercido sobre el cuerpo las anula.

AA11463345	yes you can have them burned off. whether insurance will pay depend on your plan. keep in mind sunscreen doesn't cause cancer, the exposure to the sun causes cancer. next time you go out apply the sunscreen.|`|AA11298562	Yes, it's a fairly easy procedure, but you will probably have some scarring.  Even if you don't want to use sunscreen, there are other ways to protect your skin.  Carry an umbrella, wear long, light clothes, etc.  As for why you're getting so many moles, you'd have to ask a dermatologist.|`|oNEyajNwaa	I got some moles removed and I am so happy that I did... but my doctor would only remove the raised ones - the ones that were flat on my skin he said would cause more damage to be removed that was worth it.

My scars are very minimal.|`|d4ab2ca4753647af0404b27370d43127aa	yes, you need to go and see a dermatologist, they can usually  remove most moles in the office, without major surgery.

lazMSMAFaa	Cerco di spiegartelo in 2 parole (vado un po' di fretta):    il nostro corpo, fisiologicamente,  un insieme di soluzioni ISOTONICHE (che hanno le stesse concentrazioni in ambiente sia intra che extracellulare).    Se ci immergiamo in acqua di mare, che ha concentrazione MAGGIORE di soluti rispetto al nostro ambiente cellulare, il nostro corpo PERDE acqua per bilanciarci (perde solvente) e ci raggrinziamo.    Stesso ragionamento, all'inverso: immergendo un globulo rosso (es) in soluzione IPOtonica, l'eritrocita accumla acqua e scoppia.

257a9d946714a8f4501691ae483c49c5aa	I had this done and as everyone else said they numb it and cut it straight down but I did not have the medicine applied to make  what they cut not come back. I had this done 6 months ago and my toe nail is almost grown out.|`|df378c28318ff6097f7f272b0367e6cbaa	I had a nasty ingrown toenail for nearly a year before I went to the doctor to get it cut out.  All they did was shoot my toe up with tons of numbing medication and cut out my entire toenail!  It didn't hurt too much, and I didn't need bandages after the first week.  Well, after I got that one fixed my other large toe began to hurt.  It too oozed puss, swollen, and bloody but I felt stupid going to the doctor for a second time.  All I did for that toe was take a cotton swab and stick it under the corner that was digging into my skin.  I changed it every day and put antibiotic ointment on it.  After a few weeks it was nearly completely healed.  A few weeks after that and I didn't need the cotton any more.  Good luck!  BTW, the toenail that was taken off grew back completely normal!  After a few weeks the skin hardens and you can't hardly tell you had your nail removed.|`|b1f3cf60104ab87b5af1ad622e8bc4a9aa	My sister and husband had this.  You can't tell at all.  All they do is numb the area (like if you were getting stitches or a cavity filled) and cut off a part of the nail (even though they technically call it surgery).  They cut all the way from the top to the bottom, so your nail will still look straight.  The only difference you may see is that it looks slightly skinier than before, but nothing abnormal looking.  A chronic infection could mess up the growth plate in your nail which means it will grow rigid and funky forever, so get it done before the infection gets out of control.|`|0f94a0446ef41fc35c6a1ad63c613630aa	My mom had her toenail operated one when awhile ago and it doesn't really make the nail look any different than before. It can, however, be very painful if you forget to take your pain medication.

inPuETp9aa	La primera de ellas es practicar el ejercicio aerbico. Este no solo aumenta la circulacin en el cerebro sino que tambin beneficia nuestro sistema cardiovascular.     En estos casos tambin es muy conveniente eliminar el alcohol. Este mata las clulas del cerebro o neuronas. Un vaso de buen vino solamente, es lo recomendable. Ms de eso no solo nos desconcentra sino que tambin da?a nuestro hgado.  La cafena es otra de las sustancias a eliminar. Provoca insomnio y eleva el colesterol generando placas en las arterias y as impidiendo que la sangre llegue al cerebro, al margen de otras complicaciones.     Tambin te recomendamos ocuparte de la alimentacin de tu cerebro. Hay muchas vitaminas, minerales y amino cidos que ayudan en este sentido. Nuestro cerebro no es precisamente estpido, necesita protenas, frutas, vegetales y todas las Vitaminas B, minerales y amino cidos que puedas brindarle. ?Piensas que es fcil ser cerebro?  Para el cerebro trabajar correctamente no es sencillo si lo alimentamos con azcar, carbohidratos refinados y toda la comida basura a la que mucha gente est acostumbrada.  Algunos minerales importantes para el cerebro son el zinc (semillas de calabaza) y el Boro que nos lo brindan los dtiles, las pasas de uva y las ciruelas disecadas.    Otro elemento: hagamos de cuenta que el cerebro es un msculo. ?Qu sucede si uno no lo trabaja? Simple: se atrofia de a poco. Por ello, hay que hacer lo mismo. Ejercitarlo leyendo o utilizndolo de diversas maneras, mediante ejercicios o juegos de rapidez mental es muy importante.     La melatonina es una excelente sustancia para el cerebro. No solamente ayuda al cuerpo a descansar correctamente tambin impide el deterioro del cerebro. Una buena siesta tambin ayuda.|`|GAQiSiuzaa	Lo mejor es la relajacion cerebral. La gente dice que el cerebro es un msculo, pero luego nunca hablan de los ejercicios de ese msculo, y el mejor que se conoce es la relajacin. La vida estresante a la que sometemos nuestro cerebro, lo pone evidentemente en un estado de tensin. ?Cul es el opuesto de tensin? Relajacin, con la relajacin de nuestro cerebro as como nuestro pensamiento se alcanza el arco de mayor amplitud y fuerza de nuestro msculo. Lo dems viene dado.|`|jDUJNgbPaa	no beber alcohol ni fumar ni drogas, leer mucho, hacer ejercicios mentales..|`|EvJa7Ptbaa	Hola Esperanza. Segn conozco, las neuronas son las nicas clulas del cuerpo que no pueden regenerarse, por lo tanto, cuando una neurona muere, sus funciones tienen que ser sustituidas por una neurona vecina, de tal manera que, una misma neurona pasa a realizar sus propias funciones y las de la neurona muerta, forzndola ms de lo debido. Es por ello que se hace necesario que procuremos evitar la aceleracin de la muerte neuronal. Segn entiendo, el ser humano posee alrededor de 100.000 millones de neuronas y en condiciones normales perdemos diariamente alrededor de 50.000 neuronas a partir de los veinte a?os de edad. Sin embargo, cuando frecuentamos vicios como el alcohol, el tabaco, etc. excesivamente comenzamos a perder ms de esas 50.000 neuronas diarias. Por eso te recomiendo lo mismo que te han respondido anteriormente y recuerda, sobretodo, procurar una buena alimentacin, sobretodo en alimentos que contengan vitamina B  y realizar actividades que no sean ni deficientes ni excesivas.

PM5t6LIPaa	El estrs.... lo peor es cuando has llegado al punto donde te estresa ests estresado, juajua.    En realidad el tema de terminar con el estrs es algo complicado, sobre todo por que no se puede terminar con elo, es una reaccin de nuestro cerebro que nos ayuda a funcionar mejor (hasta cierto punto, claro).   Para reducirlo, hay muchas tcnicas, ya depende de cada persona lo que mejor le funcione, en esencia todas tiene que ver con alimentar a la mente con estmulos que la hagan desenfocar la atencin en el agente estresor..    Bien, te doy algunos consejos muy prcticos    En el trabajo  -Trabaja menos. Ponte metas de horario, "hoy salgo a las 7, pase lo que pase" Realmente lo que puedas lograr en una o dos horas ms, no ser el avance del siglo.   -Vagabundea un poco, tmate momentos de descanso total, sin pensar en nada ms  -Sal a tomar aire fresco. Cada hora, toma 5 minutos, camina y bebe algo (alcohol no, obvio, jeje)  -Delega responsabilidades. Ense?a a tu gente a ser como t, confa en ellos, permiteles asumir sus riesgos  -Pide ayuda. Si no puedes con todo el paquete, lo mejor es que hables con la gente de la empresa, para que tengas alguien que te asista. Si el negocio es tuyo, considera la opcin de contratar a alguien.   -Define tus responsabilidades. No eres la nica en la empresa, cierto? Entonces deja que cada quien asuma su problemtica, y no "compres" estrs ajeno e innecesario.    En tu mente  -?Qu es lo peor que puede pasar? Cuando ests en una encrucijada, detente y reflexiona LA PEOR de las consecuencias de que todo salga mal.. Seguro que luego de reflexionar, te dars cuenta la improbable de ello, y que no hay consecuencias tan grandes como para no poder ser solucionadas.  -Desmenuza y vuelve a armar. Quita cada parte el problema, una a una, y luego vuelve a juntarlo, sin paja de relleno. Te dars cuenta que la solucin estaba ah delante.  -Pondera la problemtica. Lo que te sucede ?realmente es un problema de vida o muerte? ?Es imposible tomar una solucin? ?Es lo peor por lo que has pasado?  -Todo, TODO, pasar. Cualquier situacin, por negra que pueda parecer, est destinada a pasar. Todo tiene su fin, y eso es inevitable, hagas lo que hagas, completado o no, bien hecho o mal hecho, todo llega a su momento  -Concentrate en una cosa a la vez. El camino de Santiago se se hace en muchos pasos, sino uno a uno. Pensar en "todo lo que tengo que hacer" o en "el poco tiempo que tengo" usualmente consume tiempo y nos agota. en vez de estar pensando toda la problemtica, enfcate a realizar acciones concretas que te vayan acercando a tu objetivo, sin pensar demasiado. Al final del da habrs logrado mucho, ya vers-  -Evita el estrs "Nostradamus" Cuando algo te aqueje, date cuenta si es una situacin real o algo que "puede pasar" La mayora de las cosas que nos estresan, tiene que ver con situaciones que "esperamos que no sucedan". Piensa claro, se visionaria, pero no te estreses por cosas que an no suceden. A veces es inevitable que algo te estrese, pero puedes ahorrarte el estrs antes de tiempo.    Fuera del trabajo:  -Deja "el saco en la puerta" Cuando salgas del trabajo, cierra los ojos y piensas que metes todos los problemas en un saco. Luego, lo dejas en la puerta de la oficina, y te vas a casa. A la ma?ana siguiente, lo recojes.  -Camina. Caminar libera la mente, relaja el cuerpo y te distrae. No importa el lugar, 20 minutos bastan.  -Aprende algo. Estudia algo que te guste, cocina, pintura, canto. Aunque sea una o dos veces a la semana, vers como te ayuda.  -Evita a los compa?eros del trabajo. Crea una red social ajena a tu empleo. Si vives con personas que ves en el trabajo, empieza a construir nuevas amistades  -Bebe un poco de alcohol. Una copa antes de ir a la cama... vers como relaja.   -Consigue una mascota. Los perros, principalmente, se convierten en grandes aliados, su compa?a es impresionantemente liberadora, adems de sus capacidades para saber como y cuando hacerte sentir bien.  -Ten sexo o mastrbate si no tienes con quien. El sexo, seguido de un buen orgasmo, libera endorfinas, que te harn sentir como nunca.  -Acude a centros sociales. La iglesia, una piscina o un club deportivo son una herramienta genial, ya que vers gente diferente, situaciones diferentes y el calor de su compa?a te harn sentir mejor.  -Toma una infusin de tila, melisa y miel con leche tibia media hora antes de dormir. No te da sue?o, pero en cuanto llegas a la cama te relajas de una forma... que hay que verla!  -Haz ejercicio. Tambien libera endorfinas, ni importa lo que sea! Actividades que requieren picos de esfuerzo, como el gimnasio, liberan la energia del estrs con gran xito.  -Sal de compras. Comprate alguna cosilla, incluso entrar a un almacn a mirar un poco ayuda bastante  -Come ms carbohidratos. Estos tienen la capacidad de hacernos sentir bien. El chocolate tambien tiene agentes que mejoran el estado de nimo. Ojo con tu dieta!!!  -Sal de casa!! No importa la hora, lo importante es que te expongas a nuevas situaciones, que pongan tu mente en otro sitio. Quedarte en casa el tiempo libre, no es muy saludable, sobre todo si te quedas a dormir.  -Toma un masaje. Puedes ir a un SPA, o pide a alguien te lo haga. Pon msica ambiental, una vela aromtica.... mmm  -Cambia de ambiente. Renueva tu oficina y tu casa. Mueve los escritorios, cambia de lugar la cama, abre ventanas para que entre toda la luz. Siempre hay tiempo para todo  -Fija tu hora feliz. Establece un momento del tiempo, ya sea una hora, un da, o un espacio, que sea tuyo y slo tuyo. En ese tiempo no programes citas, no hagas llamadas, slo deddacate a lo que te apetezca! Pase lo que pase, evita que entren contaminantes a tu zona.   -Golpea la cama.

1JCtMcu6aa	Existem diferentes formas de se abordar a "Depress?o" que est?o relacionadas com os diferentes entendimentos que existem em rela??o a origem da mesma. Em muitos casos se faz necessria a interven??o conjunta psicolgica-mdica no atendimento a pessoa deprimida.    Tratamento Psicolgico- O Psiclogo trabalha junto com o cliente (indivduo/famlia), acompanhando-o em sua busca pessoal. Procura facilitar o processo de auto-percep??o, o que passa tanto pelo racional como pelo corporal, na medida em que a conscincia envolve sensa??es que se expressam e s?o captadas atravs dos sentidos. Em um processo psicoteraputico ao mesmo tempo em que o cliente amplia sua percep??o a respeito de si prprio, aumenta sua autoconfian?a e capacidade de se orientar criativamente em seu meio na busca de seu equilbrio.    Tratamento Mdico - A especialidade mdica responsvel por este tipo de tratamento  a Psiquiatria. O Psiquiatra procura controlar a "Depress?o" atravs de medica??o e aconselhamento.  O indivduo em um quadro depressivo quando chega para procurar ajuda, encontra-se deprimido a maior parte do tempo. Com o incio do tratamento come?a a ter alguns momentos com sensa??es boas, alternando com sintomas de depress?o. Ao longo do processo teraputico esses perodos de normalidade v?o ficando cada vez mais duradouros e constantes, e os momentos depressivos cada vez mais raros e menos agudos.     muito importante que o indivduo deprimido tenha essa no??o de que  comum e muitas vezes esperado ter algumas recadas para que n?o abandone o tratamento diante de pequenas regress?es.|`|4nbEuQt8aa	tente mudar de rotina, procure sair ou?a boas musica. deixe os problemas de lado, se ache a pessoa mais linda  do mundo, mude o  visual se n?o funcionar procure o medico|`|2hLSxWlvaa	A Melhor dica que posso lhe dar  para procurar um mdico... n?o tome remdio sem orienta??o...

We have anti-bodied our children to death.  There is something said for having our bodies fight off the illnesses  themselves.  All 3 of my children have had chicken pox, me too, big deal.  I am so against the over immunization of our children.   It's another ploy by the pharmaceutical companies to make their pockets richer. Fortunately I have a doctor who does not believe in over immunizing our children.  I also did not have my kids vaccinated for Hep B.  They give that to babies right from the start!  The only way you can get Hep B is the same as HIV, through blood transmission.  So, I told my son that when he starts having promiscuous sex or starts shooting heroin then we should probably go get the immunizations.  In so many cases the public just blindly follows the norm.

On someone that has such a small frame such as you, that large of breasts can give you neck and back pain. On a non-medical note, and as I bet you already know this, clothes designed for a girl your size dont go well with your chest, and vice versa.    There isnt a really definate time when your body stops, mine are still going and I'm 18. (size 34B).    Maybe you might want to talk to your doctor.    Hope this helps!    ~C|`|AA11155768	Unfortunately, you have many years to go before that happens. Make sure you are wearing supportive bras at all times...even at night while sleeping! Buy good sports bras for activities, leisure bras for sleeping, and cute but supportive bras for everyday wear.     After your 18th birthday (preferably after your 20th to ensure they don't grow back), you can consider a reduction.    Good luck and God bless!

Se observa en ciertas afecciones gstricas que cursan con hiperclorhidria, parasitosis intestinales, acromegalia, adenoma basfilo hipofisario, diabetes mellitus, hipoglucemia, estados degenerativos nerviosos o en los gorditos que es un defecto en el Hipotalamo , que en ocasiones es facil controlar con medicacion  Bueno yo siempre cuento lo que me funciono (PODRIA SERLE DE UTILIDAD A TI Y A OTROS)  MI PLAN EN SINTESIS:(Lo dcidimos con mi colega la Dra.Richtman)  Aclaro que en ocasiones el medico me reemplazaba la sibutramina en periodos de alternancia con MAZINDOL.  La sibutramina fue desarrollada originalmente para el tratamiento de la depresin, aunque su efecto sobre el sistema nervioso central hizo que creciera el inters por su aplicacin en la obesidad. Se trata de un medicamento que suprime el apetito aumentando la disponibilidad de un neurotransmisor llamado noradrenalina.  Esta clase de frmaco, que en el pas se introdujo en el mercado con el nombre de Aderan, debe ser recetado por un mdico.  Pero no solo saca el apetito desmedido por los hidratos , sino que ademas quema grasas por termogenesis esto da un equilibrio entre saludable manejo de cualquier, dieta ,tornandola raoida y sin esfuerzo aunque algunos adicionan triacana de accion prolongada para complementar la quema de grasas y disolucion(lipolisis) y tisanas de potenciadas hierbas diureticas y laxantes(de origen natural para reducir los efectos colaterales de la hipertencion y eliminar tambien el exeso de lipidos, liquidos y la constipacion.  A mi me funciono de maravillas aunque muchos dicen que la experiencia es intransferible, los amigos que fueron con esta misma doctora siguieron controles y metodos similares y obtubieron resultados favorables  pd: un gran interrogante?existen buenos y malos remedios o gente mal medicada?  segundo interrogante ?que tiene mas efectos colaterales los farmacos citados o el sobrepeso?  ?es bueno ser prejuicioso y decir "medicacion noooooooooo", o es siempre lo mas sano es lo mas operativo en materia de regimenes alimentarios.  pd: he dejado ya la medicacion y no existio el tan temido por muchos efecto rebote(creo que el unico rebote es el que hace uno si viendose bien comienza a comer y entonces se vuelve como pelota rebotina.sin ofender, las dietas ?yo yo? o los pacientes ?yo yo?  Tambien hay que ser menos hipocritas y que nos traten a los gorditos como a cualquier otro enfermo,los deabeticos saben que la insulina tiene efectos colaterales, pero igual se utiliza como complemento a la dieta, y creo que la obesidad no escapa a estos ejemplos.

AA11808736	Quando a toxoplasmose causa les?es que comprometem a vis?o, os sinais variam de acordo com a regi?o atingida. A toxoplasmose pode provocar coriorretinite, uma inflama??o no fundo do olho. Se o surto for leve, pode passar despercebido; se for intenso, a vis?o fica turva e diminuda. Caso a infec??o pelo Toxoplasma atinja a mcula, pode causar a perda da vis?o central. Em geral, a coriorretinite se manifesta na adolescncia ou no adulto jovem. Os sintomas da toxoplasmose ocular dependem da localiza??o da les?o na retina e da presen?a de inflama??o, explica o oftalmologista Edson Branzoni Leal, que tambm integra o corpo clnico do IMO.    As les?es na periferia da retina geralmente n?o causam muita baixa de vis?o, a menos que haja uma inflama??o ocular exacerbada, explica Leal. Muitas vezes, os pacientes iniciam o quadro com o relato de pontos pretos, manchas escuras mveis ou fixas que podem evoluir para uma diminui??o importante da vis?o, se a doen?a n?o for tratada. Assim como pode ocorrer com a toxoplasmose aguda (que acomete o corpo inteiro), a vers?o ocular chega at a passar desapercebida. Caso a les?o acometa reas perifricas da retina, a doen?a pode se desenvolver de forma assintomtica, diz Leal.  comum que o oftalmologista detecte uma les?o cicatrizada que o paciente n?o percebeu. Quando se manifestam, os sintomas mais freqentes da toxoplasmose ocular s?o vis?o borrada, floaters (manchas na vis?o), dor e fotofobia (intolerancia a luminosidade).|`|lp9smnUeaa	A toxoplasmose pode se apresentar por todo o corpo ate memso nos olhos ,mas normalmente a pessoa nao percebe, existem sinais como visao borrada ou compontinhos pretos etc.    Bem a toxoplamose  transmitida pelas fezes do animal de estima?ao (gato,cachorro), entao aconselho sempre quando for limpar as necessidades do seu bichinho mesmo que use luvas lave as mao para que assim possa colocar as maos em seus olhos sem maiores riscos a sua saude,pois se a toxoplasmose atingir seu olhos pode danificar a crnea e pode sim te levar perda da visao, mas na se preocupe ate esse ponto tem um longo caminho se esta preocupado procure seu medico, e a questao da sua idade nao influencia muito se a doen?a vai ser pior ou mais branda em voce,mas fique tranquilo pois ela pode vir e ir sem nem memso vc perceber.  abra?os!!!|`|J9nE29xQaa	 a forma mais comum da toxoplasmose,  tpica em  paciente com boa imunidade, inicia com dificuldade para enxergar, inflama??o, podendo at terminar em cegueira.

And some people are naturally skinny-- I'm 6'0" and 125 lbs!  As you grow, your body will go through times when its fatter or skinnier, that's normal, it's how bodies grow.  Eat healthy (lots of protien at your age), get plenty of excercise and rest, and don't worry about your weight unless your doctor says to.  Everyone's body is build differently, as long as you're healthy, that's what matters.
GFSxvJRjaa	sit ups? idk..|`|ovdJCLIRaa	Many people have a belly bulge. It's actually pretty normal. Do crunches and sit-ups everyday. Stop eating junk food, and fast food restaurants. Eat foods that have high fiber contents in them (i.e. All-Bran Buds is a great cereal with a lot of fiber.) This helps drain the system. Do you daily exercise. Drink lots of water, and drink less unhealthy beverages.    If it's a softer bulge, then it's probably fat.  If it's a harder bulge, then it could be water, or fat that's harder to get rid of.    I hope this helps!! Good luck!|`|54P0TxR5aa	Sit ups, really you're perfect weight, trust me I have the same problem. I'm 5'4.5  and 120.

You could try using that on the cuts to push out any infection going on.  However, if it continues to not go away, and you notice signs such as yellow crusting, oozing, drainage, redness, tenderness, and pain, you will probably need to see the doctor.  Also, if you cut yourself fairly deep and the fence was metal, then you should see your doctor, especially if you have not had a tetanus shot in the past few years.|`|bRe4XvpSaa	dead skin dont worry its not infected if it was it would really hurt and it would be red|`|zPMkDREwaa	show your parents and ask if they think you should go to the doctor. hopefully you are current on your tetanus shot. |`|AA11298562	Infection generally causes swelling, pain, and redness, and maybe a green discharge.  It sounds like they're healing OK.  Also, itching is a normal part of the healing process.

It just may be the time of the month.|`|3LRQfdx3aa	Nope just  induce throw up|`|k9CJIXezaa	once it did for me.i think its the high attitude or somthing that a roller coaster makes you feel that starts your period|`|RiLmN8Q2aa	Nope|`|VrdJpxqKaa	Absolutely NOT!!.... riding a roller coaster will not determine or make your period start it just depends on the time of the month
sQu3LLqtaa	Your ideal weight would be 125 lbs so above 145 lbs or below 105 lbs could be regarded as overweight or underweight.  Your weight is at the high end of normal.|`|AA11155768	Kudos for being concerned about your weight. This is a good question for your doctor on your next visit. In the meantime, make good food choices and work in 15-30 minutes of exercise a day to remain fit. Get your family and friends involved to make it fun and to ensure all of your loved ones are healthy as well!|`|w6SQST3daa	Your fine. I really think your fine.
AA11155768	Assuming you started your menstrual cycle within the last 2 years, I'd say you are fine. But if you usually have regular cycles and are now having problems, you may need to see a doctor. No one here is qualified enough to make that diagnosis without more information.    Good luck and God bless.    |`|DGAsiTBHaa	You're 14 so you will have irregular periods.  Relax -- it's normal.|`|8580a00b8928b21b7e2a1300aeb99f4faa	Your normal|`|DtwqUqPTaa	hi..    normal don't worried ..|`|b698c36eb69ca7c1ee56cc564c80134aaa	It is not unusual for girls periods to be very irregular for the first two or three years after they first start.  Even missed periods are okay when you are getting your cycles established.  I wouldn't worry about it, you are okay.|`|nAK8bm91aa	Might be pregnant|`|RbPEwvTaaa	A lot of young girls are irregular for the first 1-2 years after first getting their periods.  More than likely there is nothing wrong with you.  ((((((((hugs))))))))|`|viO5I3Jbaa	First off, good for you being a virgin!!! Second, you are still young and your body is going through changes. The first few years that you get your period, they may be irregular.  Nothing to worry about if you aren't having sex.  Also, keep a journal of when  you have your period...this will help you spot any patterns.  I have been journaling for years and it have found several patterns..and I'm 24!  |`|NTpVAhhqaa	It's okay,when you first get your period it might be irregular for about a year or two.
2Ml05azZaa	While your probably fine (all girls worry about weight going through puberty) here are some tips to lose weight in a healthy and safe way    Cut down on excess sugars (pop, candy)    Reduce carb intake after 3pm ( or 6 hours before you go to bed)    Eat a good breakfast    eat smaller meals more often (same amount of food eaten in 6 sittings digests faster then when eaten in 3, also boosts metabolism)    Drink more watter instead of juice + otehr calorie dence drink    be a bit more active, you dont have to be a gym rat, a simple 15 minute walk everyday can do wonders.       |`|NVolwDkNaa	Your steal Young so practically anything you eat wont get you fat, but i would say to stay away from cokes ( that includes no calorie cokes) and stay away form the junk food, seriously, that's the  1 reason americans are fat is because of junk food.|`|AA11155768	Telling it how it is gave a great answer but I just want to add, get your family and/or friends involved. It's much more fun when you have support.
AA11155768	First, stop the Fad dieting! Yo-yo dieting only makes it harder to lose weight. 2nd, consult with your doctor to make sure there are no limitations to dieting or exercise. Third, focus on improving your daily habits, one at a time. Don't feel you have to cut out all treats because that is what makes you give up. If you have no other choice but to eat out, make sure you do your research. You CAN eat out and eat healthy at the same time.     Learn portion sizes and keep track of calories, fat, and sugar content. Walk or jog for 15 minutes twice a day. Also, boost your metabolism by eating smaller portions more often. Instead of 3 meals a day, eat 5-6 times per day. If you can't do fruit, try veggies. Carrots are a great finger food, especially during those times when you find yourself munching mindlessly.  Good luck and God bless!|`|Fhtzok3Baa	I use the Fat X program.|`|tdRZvkEraa	Hi, there is no need to go on a diet. Slowly change to a healthy diet totally eliminating all the junk, processed and fast foods as you did with soda. Increase your cardio exercise with bicycling, jogging or jumping rope. These changes won't be felt overnight, but in a year from now you will definitely have slimmed down and will have more energy too.|`|xg5HAFRkaa	you should cut out sugar. you will feel crappy for about 2 days or so, but once you level out, you feel better. my husband and i use splenda instead. we are doing a low carb approach to jump start our weight loss. anyway, most restaurants that have salads will have a sugar free dressing of some sorts. I know dining out is hard on a diet, but you need to go in there knowing what you can have. ask the waitress questions, thats what they are there for, make substitutions, exclusions, whatever you need to do to get something to fit into your diet. we go to barbeque places and ask for everything plain! it's pretty much about will power, if you can't say no to the stack of pancakes at iHop, you're only cheating yourself.
2Yijblbaaa	see a doctor asap, sweetheart!|`|TORBP6QIaa	Seems like you may be having issues with retaining water...you should probably go see the doctor if it happens again as its rather unusual to just reatain water in one ankle/foot, and it doesnt usually happen for the whole month either.|`|l6XvHv4Uaa	Your foot being swollen has Nothing to do with your period.. It is two separate parts of the body that in no way relate to each other |`|AA11155768	Seek advice from a doctor. We don't have your medical history or even your age. You could simply be retaining water. No one here is qualified to make that diagnosis. You'll be fine once you speak to your doctor.    Good luck and God bless.|`|Qk0Utjc9aa	swelling is caused by added blood flow to an area, while you have your period that flow is concentrated at ur vag would be my guess. maybe you will get lucky and your foot will not swell up again, but i have no idea. sorry |`|Bptxl9g0aa	You may have a thinning blood vessel in your foot.  Try to have a half Asperin every morning to keep the blood thin.  |`|b5ppFsn2aa	if you are taking any medications there could be complications, especially if youre taking birth control? Sometimes this can lead to blood clots and swolen feet dont seem too far off, since it is a circulatory problem youre having. . .
OrK59gCyaa	it really annoys me when people say 'you may be pregnant' or jump to conclusions. this happened to me, people said 'oh you may be pregnant' and it resulted in my being scared for my life for 10 months, stupidly, about a virgin birth, i hadn't had sex. assumptions cause paranoia.    anyway, this is totally normal, your first few years will be slightly irregular and its fine. i started when i was 12 and im now 16 and still not in a regular pattern, though im sure yours will settle down soon enough. same with my friend.    hope i've helped!|`|lagDQ9lTaa	if u has sex the u mabe prego. talk to your mother and go se a docter.|`|7VucAyUvaa	yes dont worry about its just normal. but besure you have not engaged in sex because it might possible you are pregnant.|`|kOaPv8Cjaa	its normal   because when you first start your period the first two years you could  have irregular periods|`|nmu6coapaa	Yea it's normal when your so young! It takes it a while to regulate itself!|`|AA11155768	Your menstrual cycle will be very irregular in the first couple years of starting it. You'll be fine as long as you have a healthy diet and exercise and are not experiencing any other symptoms.     If you do decide to engage in sexual activity, speak to your parents/guardian FIRST.|`|XeoH8ILAaa	wow, the exact same thing happened to me. it came back though and its starting to get regular. it was heavy for ages when it came back, just be ready for it all the time but don;t stress. |`|S1Cjz9oyaa	The menstrual cycle can be VERY irregular and even be left out a few months in the beginning when you first get it. I'm 20 and I STILL have irregular periods, but mostly because I also have rheumatism    And if you've had sex (unprotected or not), better go see a doctor or a nurse|`|Qk0Utjc9aa	this is very normal. your body is still getting used to the changes and stuff.  some girls get there 1st one and than not again for another year.  It takes a while for it to develop a schedule that you can more or less count on.  its a good idea though to keep track of it.
AA11298562	I doubt it, but it would be a VERY good idea to look up the laws and/or consult with a lawyer.  I seriously doubt they can fire you for using a medically perscribed substance, just like I can't get fired for using my allergy medicine, even though it makes me dopey sometimes.    Once you talk to a lawyer, don't wait for the test!  Go to your employer and say, "Look, I've heard rumours that are pointing at me as a drug user.  I wanted to let you know that I have this perscription, it's legal and was issued by a doctor, and I never come to work high."  By addressing the issue before they do, you get points for being honest and for resolving a problem before it comes to a head.|`|BbXxbjcLaa	Ha...I posted an answer, and it didn't post. Anyway.  No, if and when you are tested for drugs, simply state that you are prescibed medical marijuana by your doctor. So they can call your doctor to verify it. Medical marijuana is not illegal. So you're good!
c6ddd8d84109c67904f75d246cbfa6d3aa	hi.   don't get tensed at all. the front permanent teeth erupt around the age of 7 yrs, but we take 2yrs ahead in the normal range also. that means your child is normal...   also keep checking the inner side of the front milk teeth. if a permanent tooth is erupting behind the milk tooth, then its a matter of concern. in that case go to a dentist immediately.  one thing more, don't use some gels being publicized which boast to cure all teething troubles, they might complicate situation.    if you still are conscious then go to a dentist nearby you and get a full mouth X- Ray (OPG)  done for your child to assess the development status of his\her permanent teeth.  don't worry n gud luck|`|AA11298562	Don't worry about it.  Milk teeth fall out at different ages for different children.  Some start as young as age 6, some don't begin until they're 9 or 10.

You shouldn't pop your arm in and out (I can do that too, and my dad, a doctor, says that's a good way to ruin the joint).  But yeah, the popping as you move is normal, it's just bones and muscles moving against each other, little air bubbles popping, etc.  As long as you're not forcing it, and it doesn't hurt, there's nothing wrong with it.|`|B24W8w43aa	I have the same but it's not normal - it could be signs of malnutrition or arthritis.|`|7a8qCNU2aa	I can pop almost every joint in my body. It really eases up a lot of pain I get in my lower back... but I wonder if I'd have those pains if I'd never started doing that. Oh well. My husband's the same, so at least I have someone to talk about it with. =D

I know it's probably the last thing you want to do, but the best is to tell someone you can trust.  Don't keep it inside, there are people who want to help, I can guarantee it!  It's definitely important to tell your step mom too.  She has to live with this abusive man and should know what he has done to you and your sister.  If you don't tell anyone, it's only going to get worse.  Please get help!  I'll be praying for you!|`|sAooxSglaa	TELL YOUR MOM FIRST. This is a big big deal. If she's not aware of this she NEEDS to be. Also, call the police and the Department of Human Resources. Ask if they can do something about getting him removed from the house; you can even get restraining orders on him through the court without a lawyer, although I think your mom will have to do most of that. If there is an issue with Dad, he needs to be out of the picture. It may mean losing Mom (in a way, you may be relocated) but I'm hoping that, if he's done this she'd be decent enough to get rid of him, because it may happen to her. It may have already happened to her. All three of you need to be away from him.|`|BWmSvTZ0aa	Tell your step-mom! If she sees the truth and is sane, she will call Dyphus or file for divorce.

I love Super-Growth Height Enhancer. I've been using it as a growth booster for several months now This stuff is great, It is rare for a product to live up to its advertised hype. But this one actually does. It Works as advertised. Also, this specific product advertises improved joint health. I injured my knee and could find no relief, but after 3 weeks of using the Super-Growth I no longer have knee pain. I have tried other height gaining products, but I have seen the best results from this product. My height continues to grow              |`|slKPLRLaaa	Two things:    1. No you cannot increase your weight unless you get Limb Lengthening Surgery (extremely painful check it on wikipedia).    2.

Also, your fiance loves you and your body so you should consider whatever opinion he has.     And when you decide to go for the tummy tuck (let's be serious, after having Quads, you have no other option), please wait until the babies are at least 2 years old. It will be difficult to recover with babies around the house.    God bless.|`|r8hBvWEQaa	Well a tummy tuck is less dangerous than starving yourself to death. Tell your fiance you respect his opinion but it's your decision and he should respect it.|`|kx09Jr55aa	Do what's right for you.  After all, you have to look yourself in the mirror every morning and live in your body.  
aAkjmKDXaa	if your tall, and that old, ur not really that fat...You should go to a friends house that has a scale and try and see if theirs a difference...you should also try and get on a balanced diet.I know most people dont like the word diet, but try and eat a salad a few times a week, and drink more water, or eat out less and think of meals you like to eat at home...|`|AA11155768	Obviously the first 2 answers prove you shouldn't be here asking that question. The question was 'Am I unhealthy?'     There isn't anyone here qualified enough to make that determination but I will say, it sounds as if your diet is unhealthy. Being thin does NOT equate to being healthy. It only proves your metabolism is better than others.    Good luck.|`|Z7ILDphGaa	Just because the scale doesn't show it does not necessarily mean that eating a ton of junk food isn't having an impact on your body. I have a number of friends who were always thin, no matter what they ate, but when they got to be about 18 (I'm talking about women here, so it might be a little older for you if you're a guy) their metabolism adjusted to adulthood and slowed down, causing them to gain a bit of weight pretty rapidly. These people also tended to get sick more often. So try hard to be a little more conscientious of your weight so that your health doesn't suffer.|`|gFanFnETaa	i don't know enough about you to say if you're healthy or not. but please keep in mind that thin people can still be very unhealthy. if someone thin is eating fast food everyday chances are they aren't. you're only 15 but you should still not have all that junk..|`|Qdi6DkgJaa	Well, you're unhealthy for the fact that you eat unhealthy food.

If you consider it a no, you're probably not as healthy as you think. You are what you eat, and if it's junk you'll be in a world of hurt.
uTW2KW9raa	As she gets older, she will lose the weight. Some people just have faster metabolisms then others. Its just genetics.    If its come off over the years, it will continue to come off over the next years.    She might just have a really athletic body - its probably just muscle, not fat. And remember, eating too much of the right foods can cause weight gain too.|`|AA11155768	This is something for your parents and your sister to worry about.

Most of the charts and stuff you see online doesn't account for serious athletes and therefore shouldn't be used to show that she's overweight unless a doctor says so. I was a DIII basketball player last season, out this year due to knee surgery, and I was working out hard for 2 hours per day 6 days per week, significantly more than the average person. Since muscle weighs more than fat she is most likely perfectly healthy, but if you two are that worried you could always speak with your doctor about it.|`|d90Pg33Zaa	her body is still developing - finding itself.  If she is eating right and exercising then I would not worry about it.|`|l82yIgeFaa	well, sometimes ppl are just built differently. if she's really athletic and eats right, then i'm not exactly sure why she'd be overweight. but as long  as she's active and eating healthy, she'll be in her best shape, which is better than being some couch potatoe. :)
18cfe4ae9bfb2f9c9d7167a8c4484e79aa	The only way to tell if you are pregnant or not is to take a pregnancy test. So, please buy a test kit and try it.    I think the things you describe here can be an indication of your period cycle. But you can always take a test and make sure that you are not pregnant.    ***UPDATE: "Anyway, is it true that some people do have their period the first few months of pregnancy?" Yes, it is true. Some women get "a period"(not really a period) in the first month. After that time, there may be vaginal discharge, not actual periods. Oh one more thing, there is such thing called implantation bleeding, which may occur during the first few months. But it SHOULD NOT be excessive. If it is, the pregnant women need to see a doctor ASAP. (It should not be that much blood.)|`|AA11155768	You sound really young and paranoid. Nausea, weight gain, and breast tenderness are also signs of a menstrual cycle...not necessarily a pregnancy.     Take a pregnancy test, get some condoms AND birth control! Better yet, stop having sex until you are mature enough to handle the possible consequences.
BRDqfAy3aa	Sometimes young girls have difficult period from first menstruation up to fully developed regular menstrual cycles. It will take some time to fully develop your mature regular menstrual cycle. Please be also informed that in general menstrual cycles are very sensitive to stress, emotional situations, infections, medication, etc.  Just be patient. Usually by 18-20 year the menstrual cycle will be fully development, your hormones will develop your own (personal) cycle and your menstrual cycle will be regular.  Read more below about irregular periods|`|AA11155768	The above answers are great but I have to add, please talk to your mom. A teenage girl really needs to be able to talk to a woman and your mom is the best choice.

Good luck!|`|ACR40sTCaa	your still irregular |`|BhX5Mj6jaa	if your still a virgin and you missed 3 periods in a row there is no way your pregnant?

Please talk to her about it and she probably take you to the doctors.|`|mXZ4825aaa	My friend went through that same thing to. She told her mom and her mom took her to the hospital.

Cp6BIZvhaa	Oh hun, you're so young, don't even think about it.     Oral sex is using your MOUTH and TONGUE on someone's gentials. Not words; that would be talking dirty. You can get STDs in your mouth that way. Though getting pregnant is pretty impossible.|`|kgfFGl0paa	First... the only way to get pregnant through oral sex is for the guy's mouth to have semen in it, and that's really not very likely unless he just finished ejaculating in *your* mouth and then kissing you before putting his mouth on your genitals.    STDs are another matter entirely - they're transmitted by moist contact... not just by penetrative intercourse, but by any infected moist tissue (such as even a mouth) coming into contact with any other moist tissue (such as a vulva, penis or mouth).    Safe sex?  The *only* truly safe sex is masturbation.       Intercourse or oral with barriers *and* contraceptive pills or spermicides is safER sex than going natural, but those things are not 100% effective, and there's always a risk that they'll fail and leave you either sick or expecting a baby.    EDIT:  "isnt oral sex when they just massage the you-kno-what with their words basically"    NO... it's when one of you uses your lips and tongue (licking, kissing, sucking) on the other one's genitals|`|Bcxb2tBRaa	no offense but, of course there is physical contact.  I dont want to put a description of it o here though.  sorry, that probably didnt help but yes you can get std's but no pregnancies|`|F9Q5Far8aa	oral sex is sex using your mouth, you can definitely get STDs possibly even AID, because there are disease that can be transmitted through the salivas, that's why you have to use s condom to give oral sex to a guy and use plastic food wrap, a condom cut open, or a dental dam (a thin square of latex) |`|lqxTD0E5aa	You can't get pregnant from oral sex, but you can transmit STDs.    To get an STD, no sperm needs to meet an egg.  You can get STDs in your genitals and in your mouth.|`|06cCap0Oaa	oral sex IS physical contact. although pregnancy is impossible, you're still vunerable to STD's through oral sex.    unless you were to blow him while he had a condom on...|`|b698c36eb69ca7c1ee56cc564c80134aaa	Were you aware than many people that have incurable genital herpes caught it through having oral sex.  Also HIV can be caught through oral sex.  If the person has HIV and you have a cut, sore, or dental bleeding you can get AIDS from oral sex.  If you want to have oral sex, treat it just like you would sex and use a condom.  Also, they make the same type of thing men can use over your clitoris to give oral sex so that they don't catch something from or give something to you.  Refer to the following website:    http://sexuality.about.com/od/saferse1/a...    Since most people who engage in oral sex also have other kinds of sex, it's difficult for researchers to know exactly how common it is for STDs to be transmitted only via oral sex. At the same time, we do know that many common STDs can be transmitted via oral sex (fellatio or cunnilingus). These include:     Chlamydia   Gonorrhea   Herpes   HIV   Human papilloma virus (HPV)   Nongonococcal urethritis (NGU)   Syphilis   Yeast infections     Above is a list of things you can catch through oral sex.|`|iFTa9FqZaa	you can't get pregnant, but you can get std's. |`|BRDqfAy3aa	you cannot get pregnancy but you can get STDs - read below which STDs you can get after oral sex|`|GA9WEsyCaa	no you can not get pregnant but you can get an std if you want to know more you really should go see a doctor so they can explain it to you |`|3af30c08175e2bc96bcd85540e09d175aa	Of course you can't get pregnant from oral sex. However, you may not understand oral sex. It involves mouth to genital contact. It is very easy to contract diseases through the mouth, and in fact pretty much all STDs can be spread via oral sex. Many STDs, including HPV and syphilis, are spread by direct skin contact with an infection.|`|JnWzHVnEaa	pregnancy isn't possible.  STD's are.

iNCn0HUzaa	Yes. But if your going to do that, then eat a healthy dinner. See, after you fast for so long, you body gets hungay and goes into starvation mode. When this happens, the next thing you eat your body stores it so that if it goes inot starvation mode again it will use that. then you eat again, your body stores what you ate as fat, and the process just keeps repeating. sometimes people fast before getting tests done at doctors so the x-ray turns out better. others fast beause they are trying to lose weight. Basically, fasting is just going without food for a period of time.|`|LpXbD5T1aa	wtf? dont fast. eat breakfast and dinner for sure. you could skip lunch if you want, but breakfast jump start your metabolism. it would be better to eat several small portions, like yogurt or a ham sandwich for lunch.|`|V2AYtP9iaa	its possible but if you want to loose weight than its better just to eat very healthy and exercise because if you skip meals except fro dinner you don't get all the proteins, fruits, vegetables, and carbs you need it all. and if you starve your body it will get a different message that what you whant it to think? don't do it?|`|JZrgnhr9aa	No! Do NOT try this! Starvation is never the answer! This will only result in a skeletal appearance. And believe me, skeletons are very unattractive. Eat healthy and exercise. It's the only way. You see a lot of advertisements on pills and special treatments or weird diets or people getting plastic surgery but that is not what you need to do. If you wanna look good, you have to work hard. It's the way of life! And don't try the no-eating-breakfast-or-lunch thing; Even if you're just doing it until you've lost enough pounds. Because of lack of food, your body will cling on to any food it gets when you start eating properly. Making you look chubby. Stay healthy! |`|5f98495e74af5c0cddd4eb405f568400aa	Yes, but it's not a good idea because of three main reasons.    1.  Your body will train itself to store fat, so you may loose weight, but chances are you're body fat will increase while your muscle mass will decreases.  Basically, it will slow your metabolism.  You may weigh less but don't expect your body to look all that great.    2.  You'll be more prone to eating large meals.  One of the worst things someone who wants to loose weight can do is eat huge meals.  Our bodies are not like gas tanks.  You can't just dump a bunch food in your body and expect your body to store and burn off calories the way way you'd like.      3.  Breakfast really is the most important meal of the day.  Not eating early in the day is denying your body energy for the entire day.  If you just eat dinner you're basically just eating food to make it through sleep.  |`|Zsal42jEaa	Yes and No if you skip eating you will lose fat and muscle. then when you do eat your body saves it as fat right away as fat. So you body will think your starving it. so it will save it as fat|`|cOI6L48Yaa	well i just saw the new and it u work out all day and eat high carbs its not worth it|`|AA11155768	People fast for religious reasons, not to lose weight. Starving yourself will only slow your metabolism and make it harder to lose weight. Instead eat smaller portions 5-6 times per day to boost your metabolism. Watch your carb and fat intake. Good luck!

H3AmTA8eaa	oh have you gotten it yet for the 1st time?    i remember getting discharge like a half a year before my 1st period. It definitely means its coming soon but not necessarily tomorrow      but if you have had your period discharge is there like the whole time in between periods and gets heavier throughout the time in between. |`|4lSujBcHaa	well for me it is a pale white.   Yellow usually mean infection,   pink/red: blood.   Have you had any other signs? such as cramps? or big mood swings? or you get annoyed or mad, or weird emotions really easily?  You prob. have one on its way!  You should prob. watch out for a while. wear a pad, and bring some in like a little pouch to school just in case.(you can get cute little decorative ones at walmart for like 3 bucks, and no one will have a clue what it is.  if your umm crotch starts burning, itching or stinging you should prob change your undies.   make sure to take a shower everyday, and change your undies everyday.  ask your mom when she had,  her 1st period, and what her symptoms were too.     go ahead and msg me if you have any questions, im good with questions about it.  ecsp. with young girls cuz i got mine at 10.|`|c319c1f6090c4e43a1d95dd27b249dfeaa	Usually yellow means infection.  Tiny bit pink means blood.  Just keep an eye out if doesn't come within a few days, see your doc.  |`|9UoTJ6oyaa	seems like some bacteria is in there, its usually white like cottage cheese|`|188c27e529458534721e046b3a4deaaeaa	mine is yellow whitish too, but i've never heard of it being pink, you might want to get that checked out. your period should come in 6 months to a year.|`|AA11155768	It could simply be a sign that your menstrual cycle is coming. And not having an odor doesn't necessarily rule out infection.|`|WlliZdy1aa	Clear-ish.

Hope i helped :)|`|nMER7RqYaa	yep yellow whitish is the normal colour!! your period is usually on its way when ur discharge becomes rather heavy. I recommend to use panty liners, they keep ur knickers clean and you cant even tell you're wearing one! If its starts smelling or gets a really yellow colour to it thats when you might have thrush or an infection in your vagina. But you sound all nice and healthy to me!! :)|`|7NzWyWkbaa	You will know when you get it, some get acne, others crave chocolate, and somtimes  you get cramps.I know this is gross but if your vigina stings you may have it.|`|85uDg57Gaa	your going to get it again soon unless you just had it because discharge is either a way of clenaing out your vagina afteryou had your period or a way of letting you know that its coming....|`|r1EkNCETaa	its white.        or cream colored        it can sometimes be yellow.....................................    it uhhhhh u should expect it in like 4 months??????
AA11155768	You are the only who can determine if it's 'normal' by asking yourself  'is this something new I'm experiencing?'. Normal for you is not going to be normal for other people. And discharge doesn't always smell. If it's something new, see your doctor.|`|0UTeO8HBaa	For some women it is normal to have a clear sticky-like discharge when they are ovualting. Could be that. Everyone is different. As long as it's not smelly,weird color or thick. It can be normal.
AA11155768	Birth control helps stabilize your hormones so once you come off, you may experience weight loss or gain, irregular periods and/ or lack of periods in the beginning, acne, irritability, cramps, and/or bloating. Especially if you have PCOS (poly-cystic ovarian syndrome).|`|o8HJ17hMaa	I started taking birth control too but when i stopped i started feeling sick missing periods, the best thing to do is go to your doctor before u stop taking birth control pills .

My husband has had hypoglycemia since he was 2 years old and has to eat every 4 hours.  Up until the last year he was always the perfect weight for his height, not too skinny.

95oEmw5paa	     Any chance of your being pregnant? Nausea, headaches, disturbed sleep, missed period with just some spotting - all point to this.       However, if you are sure that you cannot be pregnant, then try to see a gynecologist. The developing fibrosis could cause all the pain and interrupt the menstrual cycle ( almost missed periods, or extremely heavy bleeding with possible clots). I have been through it - it was long time ago. I was confused and sort of sounded totally dumb.        I am not sure whether congratulations are in order, but I certainly sympathize with your worries and sufferings. I wish you speedy recovery from all physical and emotional turbulence and a stage of celebration. |`|JUzN4wCtaa	u mite be pregnant !!!|`|AA11155768	Funny how people yell that you might be pregnant just because of nausea.     How old are you? Are you on birth control? Have you been under more stress than usual lately? Are you taking any medications? You said your period is normally late so I'm guessing it'll just be 'late' as usual. 
WB8Hpfqkaa	it could be panic attacks, but it sounds more to me like diabetes like your blood sugar is too high or low. you need to get checked out.|`|yKXxtrhsaa	It's either two things...Hypoglycemia or Anxiety.  Actually, Hypoglycemia can cause anxiety, soo yeah.  You mentioned being pale, which IS a symptom of hypoglycemia. I don't think you have diabetes, because you're not fat, and you didn't  mention anything about peeing a lot.   To dispel what other people are answering, hypoglycemia is different than diabetes, even though they both involve blood sugar. And contrary to what some guy said, being hungry all the time would indicate low blood sugar, not high blood sugar. Get some blood tests done, or ask yourself if you are anxious about something, because again, it could be anxiety, but I'm betting on hypoglycemia. Hope I helped.|`|I8szWmVMaa	Check your family history and see if there is Diabetes. When you have diabetes and you have a low blood sugar it can get like that. I would go to a doctor. Another thing you could have is Anemia. It is where there is not enough Iron in your blood. I would see a doctor.|`|AA11298562	I hate to say this, but those sound like the symptoms of diabetes.  I'd recommend a trip to your doctor to have it checked out.|`|Zjm2S9Xsaa	Possibly type 1 diabetes. That can happen if you're not overweight.    Actually the cool sweats are usually low blood sugar.    Hungry all the time and blurry vision are high blood sugar symptoms.    You can usually buy cheap blood sugar meters in drugstores and do a little testing, on empty stomach, and then one hour and two hours after eating.    Also possible adrenaline disorder/thyroid.    Check your blood pruessure at some of those automated machines.    Panic attacks, and too much caffeine could also be causes.    I'd also recommend seeing a Dr. if you have access to one.|`|LTdegD41aa	You are not diabetic, unless you are constantly thirsty and peeing a lot. You could have a million things all of which need medical attention asap. Please go tomorrow. God Bless You|`|7d0d302bef52f1187580c3d6f022e46aaa	You could be having panic attacks or you have heart palpitations (nothing horrible, I have them too, on meds for it). 
AA11298562	Are you stressed?  Could you be clenching your jaw unconciously?  Pay attention to that and try to relax.  Take some painkillers (tylonol, advil, etc.) for now.  In any case, leave it alone for a while.  If it doesn't get better in a week or so, or if it gets worse, swells, or you get a fever, go to the doctor.|`|69cyDmifaa	ARE YOU STRESSED? DO YOU CLENCH AND GRIND YOUR TEETH WHILE SLEEPING?|`|YNxEUqlvaa	Go to the doctor.
iN0cyZoTaa	If you're not sick then it probably wasn't your cooking. He probably just has a bug. It's that time of the year anyway. |`|F292ghfQaa	Yes, maybe your cooking is horrible, and so he had to puke it out and he didn't want to hurt your feelings so he made it seem like he was sick but really, he just wanted the nasty taste to get out of his mouth. |`|AA11298562	If you both ate it, and only he is sick, then it wasn't the cooking.  And I'm sorry, but I can't think much of a guy who would automatically accuse his wife when he gets sick.|`|wH0edJoBaa	I don't think it is YOUR cooking, considering that you are not sick.  However, it is possible that he just got a bad piece of chicken or it was cooked as thoroughly as yours was.  Maybe his fork or something got put in the raw chicken juice or something on accident.      Find out what else he ate for lunch.  Maybe the lunch meat he had was old...?  Or, it could be that he just picked up a little bug somewhere.    If it is just food poisoning he'll be miserable for a little while, but recover soon enough.  Does he have a fever or any other symptoms?  If it's a stomach flu he's likely to have a fever and be complaining of aches/pains in addition to the pukes and poops.|`|kQEnJpOvaa	I think its probably just a bug. And food poisoning doesnt usually show up until 24 hours and last 24 hours.       EDIT: YES! lol|`|nhr9pN7Maa	Maybe one of the pieces of chicken wasn't as well cooked as yours. Usually if its the food, he would start to feel sick within an hour of eating the food, not three hours.|`|E3h4hHVXaa	if it was the food it would have hit him a lot sooner than 3 hours later. most likely a bug he got.|`|GEOamw3paa	Probably just a bug or something was wrong with the sandwich he had for lunch?  That's possible.  I just don't think that he got sick from the food that you cooked and both ate, if you are still ok.

f39bb7e67117f442a6630c6d09215570aa	The most common option used as homemade teeth whitening agent is baking soda, which has a mild bleaching action. Given that it is used in baking, it also implies safety. Baking soda is sprinkled on the toothbrush, and teeth then cleaned using a gentle, circular motion. Care should still be taken though, especially for people with gum sensitivity. Old wives recipes often state that a paste of baking powder, a little salt, and a few drops of white vinegar, works effectively.    Salt, used exactly as baking soda, is also touted as being a good teeth whitener. However, it might just be its osmosis, dehydrating action that makes teeth appear whiter, since dehydrated teeth look whiter.     Lemon juice is often used, but it had high acidic levels, so teeth can weaken in the long run. Other natural, fruit options regard rubbing the inside of an orange peel on the teeth. A strawberry cut in half and the inside rubbed on teeth also works. Mashed strawberry can also be applied with a toothbrush. Apple cider vinegar is also said to be effective. Dried orange rind, and walnut bark, is also good.

329e16bd855db48d292d1afce685f07aaa	No. It's not dangerous every day. I used to go out with a woman who was a reflexologist and she was always doing it on me. Many times a day. We'd be at a restaurant and while waiting for our food to come, she'd do reflexology on my hands for example. She usually had me drink water afterwards because there are some oxalates or some toxins that get broken up under your skin when you have reflexology...those are the hard spots under your skin that the reflexologist tries to break up and soften.     But I suspect even if you didn't drink water right after the reflexology session, you wouldn't suffer any real problems as a result. Depending on how sensitive you are, you might feel a bit of stomach malaise or queasiness I suppose, or slight headache, although I didn't always drink water after my girlfriend did reflexology on me and don't remember feeling any effects from any toxins being released into my system.    Think about it this way, if you walked barefoot a lot on the beach, or in thin sandals, you'd sort of be doing a form of foot reflexology all the time....they also make "reflexology" sandals and inserts you can put in shoes, etc. with bumps on them which you can wear everyday. These are putting some degree of constant pressure on the bottoms of your feet when you wear them...the heavier you are, the more pressure, I suppose.     I used to enjoy walking on hiking trails in sandals or sneakers because i could purposely step on rocks, etc. embedded in the trails and get some "foot reflexology" in while I was enjoying the hike.     I suspect that the person who "warned" you of these supposed dangers of receiving reflexology everyday does not know much about it or is generally a bit wary of "alternative" therapies. Reflexology has been practiced since Ancient Egyptian times....personally, if I could receive chiropractic, or massage or reflexology or acupuncture treatments every day...if i could afford the time and the money...I would be extremely happy. I think these types of bodywork are fantastic. Go for it!    BTW....I take issue with the answer above which says that massage and/or reflexology will "only make you sicker" since they can't "cure" anything. Even on a purely logical level that doesn't make sense since something that couldn't "cure" you would not necessarily make you "sicker".      Such a comment suggests a lack of experience and/or research into  massage and reflexology and other well established and scientifically validated forms of alternative treatment. Whole body massage is even more pervasive than reflexology and think of all the people who go for massages on a regular basis. Why would they spend the money and take the time if it didn't enhance their physical and emotional well-being??     What about "medical massage"?. This is used in "regular" hospitals, where they sometimes won't even let you take vitamins if you're an inpatient. Maybe certain people feel it's only legitimate if it has the word "medical" in front of it. I guess that is a convincer for them.      The fact is that massage and reflexology and a lot of other body works do indeed cure certain conditions...as do other modalities such as chiropractic, acupuncture and so on. I had a friend whose father was a fairly narrow minded traditional doctor and happened to suffer from chronic back problems. The only thing that really helped him was acupuncture. I suspect that he didn't mention this fact to his patients however, as it wouldn't have been in his best interest to do so, financially speaking.....    Reflexology is somewhat akin to acupuncture without the needles. Acupuncture has been used to cure ailments that traditional Western medicine is unable to.     Practitioners of reflexology, acupuncture, chiropractic, massage, etc. wouldn't waste their time and money to go to school to learn their healing arts if those arts were bogus and didn't heal people. Nor would the millions of people who seek out these forms of treatment waste their own time or money if these types of bodywork had no basis in physiological science.     "Alternative" does not mean ineffective. Quite the opposite. That is why some very rigid, traditional mainstream Western doctors feel somewhat threatened by these other forms of treatment. They know that they work and are afraid that if more and more people find out, they will not be able to buy their wives fur coats and drive around in Porsches anymore.      Personally, I am a longtime user of homeopathic remedies and am aware that at the turn of the 20th century in this country there were hundreds of homeopathic hospitals in this country, and they were all eventually forced to shut down because of a disinformation campaign launched by the AMA, which was threatened by the fact that a lot of people found homeopathic medicine to be more effective than allopathic medicine in the treatment of many ailments.     The AMA , FDA,  pharmaceutical industry and allopathic mainstream doctors have historically had a very cozy relationship based on mutual financial enrichment, often at the expense of people's health and even lives.      Drugs and surgeries approved by the FDA and pushed by doctors have killed many people at worst, and often not proven very effective at best.  I'm not aware of anybody ever dying from homeopathic remedies, or reflexology or many other alternative healing practices. That should tell people something.|`|wml6FnfQaa	no it isn't dangerous, it's just massage. there's some suggestions that it could release a blood clot in the foot, but in most normal healthy people this should not be a concern.  most articles calling reflexology "dangerous" are referring to the fact that relying on it to actually cure diseases will only make you sicker since a massage, while it feels nice, can't actually cure anything.|`|lhbZOrlbaa	No it's not dangerous, it's good for you.

Here is how I did it.  1. Every morning get up and walk for 45 minutes.  You can start with less time, but you want to get up to 45 minutes, and it must be fast walk. You want your heart rate to go up.  It must be in the morning, it kick starts your metabolism.  2. I cut out Red Meat, and fatty foods.  Boneless skinnless chicken breast, baked, or grilled, rice and vegetables (steamed).  3. Eat half.  Just eat half of what you normally eat.  Put 1/2 on your plate, and put the rest away.  Cook less.  When you go to fast food, get salads only.  Or grilled chicken.  No fries,  only diet soda. Or water.    It will work, once you get into a routine, you will get hooked on the results, and you will keep the routine.  It has been over a year for me.      A sight with some really cool diet calculators and interesting calorie counting calculators is here.  Check it out.  http://www.caloriesperhour.com/    Check out my before and after pic at my yahoo 360 page  http://profiles.yahoo.com/gorillamyke    Stay motivated, and get up and walk every day.  I seriously lost all my weight starting off my day on my walk.     Good LUCK!|`|AA10176456	Burn or use 70000 extra calories than you consume.  You'd have to have a net loss of calories per day of 909 calories per day.    Riding a stationary bike everyday at your maximum heart rate for more than an hour per day might get you there or doing a very brisk walk for two hours per day.  You could also cut your calorie intake per day.  If you were consuming 2609 calories per day and you cut that down to 1700 calories per day (along with SOME exercise), you can do it!  You have to do that everyday though.  Allow for the holiday meals and days you might be too busy or get sick.  The more you weigh, the more calories it takes for you to do something than someone who was lighter.  For example, if I ride a stationary bike for an hour at my maximum heart rate (around 125 RPMs), I could lose 600-700 calories.|`|AA12301547	Cut your calorie intake by just a little, 10%-15% and start on a regular exercise regime 3 times a week. It doesn't have to be extreme, just more exercise than you normaly do. Aim to lose between 1 and 2 pounds a week but no more than that.    Losing weight slowly like this will help you to burn fat while keeping your muscle and it will also give you a very good chance of maintaining your lower weight for as long as you want.

I finally tried diet pills on the market are made from Hoodia. I saw this stuff on ABC News. It's all natural and safe, and it works! My wife took it for a month and dropped 20 pounds. I took it for a month and lost about 13 (but I didn't exercise).    I bought the natural hoodia from this website: http://www.alllsite.info/free-diet-pills... . I checked the web site address so I can post it here and I saw they're running a promotion now to get a free 2 week sample for only $4.97! I'm going to order this supply for my wife and give it to her for Christmas =)

AA10141928	An arm and a leg! lol! Seriously though, a friend just had his done and it cost a little more than 5,000 dollars. His insurance paid it completely. This probably won't help because I would imagine there's a whole lot of factors that will determine how much your surgery will cost! Good luck and I hope you feel well!|`|28f7f9ba7491241c13be028cf15cb4b8aa	The cost of the procedure may be in thousands, but most of the insurances may cover it. Your part may be just copay or deductibles depending on your insurance.     If you are looking for low cost options it can be done in Thailand, Mexico, Singapore or India. The cost savings are 50% to 80%. Recently, there are many people from USA / UK / Canada are traveling to India, particularly for Orthopedic procedures like knee surgery, total knee replacement, Birmingham hip resurfacing. Not just for low cost, but also for experienced doctors. For example, Birmingham hip resurfacing is approved by FDA in USA only this summer while it was done for many years in India and other countries. Hence, the surgeons there have done the procedure for many people and more experienced.     Deciding to traveling abroad for medical procedure is not an easy task. It needs lot of research, homework and planning. Healthbase (www.healthbase.com) facilitates medical travel. Healthbase does all the research and arranges the complete travel. Healthbase partners with only internationally accredited hospitals (JCI / JCAHO / ISO accredited) and doctors with USA / UK trained. Healthbase has hospital partners worldwide in many countries like Thailand, Singapore, India and Mexico. They take care everything from booking with the doctors, hospitals, travel tickets, passports, visa, medical records transferring, accommodation, sight seeing and also financing.     Good luck with your procedure. Get well soon.|`|82b4ebb213694762e4c46f8b10acd0baaa	The price of knee  surgery is very low in India as compared to USA, UK and Canada. My cousin also got her hip replacement surgery in India through the forerunners healthcare .She is more than very happy with the results. She is totally pain free now. She just paid 25% of the amount she was quoted in USA and is all praise for this forerunners healthcare company.      Forerunners Healthcare is very famous in India. I read a lot about them in the Newspapers and magazines. I have read a lot of their patient stories also. They arrange financing for USA, Canadian, UK and other international patients who plan to have surgery abroad for low price, as all joint surgery is not covered by insurance in USA or by NHS in the UK. They also have photos pasted of their International patients. You can checkout their website. There are huge cost savings. As a doctor I personally believe that your surgery can be easily handled in India, as the quality of healthcare available In India is simply best in the world. The surgeons are USA/UK trained and facilities are 5 star.    http://www.forerunnershealthcare.com  Hope this helps.

You can see my before and after pics here:  http://dreamsincredibles.blogspot.com/20...    Now, I specialize in helping people lose weight easily and quickly using the detox program i used.    If you do a detox, you will be able to:  - gain better health and  - better vitality and  - even more radiant skin and  - the loss of some excess pounds as well,    All you need to do is three things.    Number one, follow the detox programme which requires you to change your diet a little bit. Eg, take more vege and less meat and seafoods.    Number two, use 1 minute a day to take some natural health foods consumable even by babies and pregnant women that will enhance the speed and the effect of the detox.    Number three, drink lots of water to flush the toxins out.    If you exercise by either running or swimming, it will furthur enhance the results.    And that's it.    The rest is up to you.

Segundo Guidugli-Neto (1997), o conceito de morte somtica envolve a "parada definitiva das fun??es organicas e dos processos reversveis do metabolismo". A necrose  a morte celular ou tecidual acidental em um organismo ainda vivo, ou seja, que ainda conserva suas fun??es organicas. Vale dizer que  natural que a clula morra, para a manuten??o do equilbrio tecidual. Nesse caso, o mecanismo de morte  denominado de "apoptose" ou "morte programada".        Corpo apopttico (seta) de clula epitelial em neoplasia maligna em lngua. A desrregula??o do sistema gentico celular devido  desdiferencia??o (volta ao estgio embrionrio), caracterstico do processo neoplsico maligno, pode explicar a observa??o da morte programada dessas clulas.    A etiologia da necrose envolve todos os fatores relacionados s agress?es, podendo ser agrupadas em agentes fsicos, agentes qumicos e agentes biolgicos:     1) Agentes fsicos: Ex.: a??o mecanica, temperatura, radia??o, efeitos magnticos;     2) Agentes qumicos: compreendem substancias txicas e n?o-txicas. Ex.: tetracloreto de carbono, lcool, medicamentos, detergentes, fenis etc.     3) Agentes biolgicos: Ex.: infec??es virticas, bacterianas ou micticas, parasitas etc.       Veja leitura complementar sobre  o processo de autlise    Esses agentes provocam o comprometimento dos nveis celulares de respira??o aerbica, de sntese protica, de manuten??o da integridade das membranas celulares e de manuten??o da capacidade de multiplica??o celular (RNA e DNA). A a??o das causas sobre esses sistemas provoca a perda da homeostase e da morfostase celular de tal forma que a clula perde a sua vitalidade. A necrose, assim, abrange altera??es regressivas reversveis que, em algum ponto e por algum estmulo desconhecido, passam a ser irreversveis; instalada a irreversibilidade e a necrose propriamente dita, inicia-se o processo de desintegra??o celular (autlise).        Transforma??es nucleares e citoplasmticas observadas nas clulas de ba?o que sofreram necrose por coagula??o. Em A, observam-se as clulas normais que comp?em o ba?o; em B, ncleo em picnose, com diminui??o de volume e intensa basofilia (hipercromatismo); em C, cariorrexe, ou seja, distribui??o irregular da cromatina, a qual se acumula na membrana nuclear; nessa fase, o ncleo pode se fragmentar (D); em E, dissolu??o da cromatina e desaparecimento da estrutura nuclear. Observa-se tambm granula??o do citoplasma, o qual se torna tambm intensamente eosinoflico (HE, 1000X).    As mudan?as na morfostase se d?o, principalmente, nos ncleos, os quais apresentam altera??o de volume e de colora??o  microscopia ptica. Essas altera??es s?o denominadas de:     1) Picnose: o ncleo apresenta um volume reduzido e torna-se hipercorado, tendo sua cromatina condensada; caracterstico na apoptose;     2) Cariorrexe: a cromatina adquire uma distribui??o irregular, podendo se acumular em grumos na membrana nuclear; h perda dos limites nucleares;     3) Carilise ou cromatlise: h dissolu??o da cromatina e perda da colora??o do ncleo, o qual desaparece completamente.    J as modifica??es citoplasmticas observadas ao microscpio ptico (essas modifica??es s?o secundrias s nucleares, sendo visveis mais tardiamente) consistem na presen?a de granula??es e espa?os irregulares no citoplasma. Este torna-se opaco, grosseiro, podendo estar rompida a membrana citoplasmtica. Intensa eosinofilia  caracterstica, decorrente de altera??es lisossomais e mitocondriais.     O tecido necrtico  caracterizado por intensa eosinofilia, devido  diminui??o de pH oriunda da autlise. Nesse campo, ainda  possvel visualizar a estrutura celular e alguns ncleos em diferentes estgios de perda de estrutura; com a evolu??o do processo de autodigest?o, a tendncia  a estrutura clula desaparecer completamente (HE, 1000X).    As mudan?as na homeostase ainda constituem captulo obscuro na patologia segundo Guidugli-Neto (1997). Estudos moleculares tm mostrado que o primeiro evento observado  a altera??o na bomba de sdio e potssio, provocando edema intracelular. O metabolismo celular  mantido gra?as  gliclise; acabando-se a reserva de glicognio, cidos s?o acumulados no interior da clula (principalmente cido ltico), o que leva  diminui??o do pH. A acidez provoca a libera??o de enzimas lisossomais, o que gera a hidrlise de protenas essenciais para a clula (processo denominado de autlise) (Guidugli-Neto, 1997).Observa-se que a perda da homeostase envolve o sistema respiratrio celular (as mitoc?ndrias), o sistema enzimtico (os lisossomas) e o sistema de membranas, o qual parece ter um papel crucial para o estabelecimento de les?es irreversveis na clula   ei acho q mere?o melhor resposta...|`|c60cb72869669cb3322a74fd1f2b42b8aa	NECROSE  CAUSADA PELA MORTE CELULAR.

Wear dark colored jeans and NEVER white pants the first few days.     Ask your Mom or an older sister for help if you need it...they know what you're going through, and don't talk to guys about it, they're too  immature!

You need some Advil every 8 hours for the first few days.  You need to wash yourself 2 or 3 times a day.  If you use tampons, don't leave them in longer than 4 hours.|`|a3b042808066f545bc648cc3eb16bb77aa	it will happen ever 28 days or so......you'll be irritable and all that crap....and when u get married....you'll jump on your menstral cycle and run your husband over.|`|d5abde070e9276f7bc98f0271e691652aa	check urself regularly, dont where light colored espcially white pants.

Good Luck|`|5219c959f7440e1b4052bc03fb91affdaa	Ok don't worry at all it is no big deal, and it does NOT hurt. Basically what is happening inside of you is that you are releasing an egg, and it causes you to bleed outside of your vagina. If you are not ready to use tampons yet, which is not unlikely, just have your mom take you to a local drug store to buy some extra strength pads, and also some panty liners just for when your period slows down. Be prepared for your period to be irregular when you first start out, for example you may have it for only 2 days or maybe even more like 12. Also, you may not get your period next month,  but then you may get it the month after. Everyone is different so dont worry, and relax.    -B  hope I helped and good luck!|`|d54ca0045c06e3a3de3a6c82812cdf39aa	Congratulations!! Starting your period is a scary, but exciting, milestone in your life. First and foremost, know that you are now physically capable of getting pregnant. If and when you become sexually active, make sure you talk to someone you trust about protection (from pregnancy and STDs). In regard to your periods, know that yours may be different from your friends' and may change over your lifetime (it's normal for your period to be a couple of days or almost a week long.) The best girl advice I can offer you is to never wear your "good" underwear when you're menstruating -- it's almost impossible to keep them from unwanted spots. You will probably feel some angst about tampons and how they are inserted. Should you choose to try them, relax, read the instructions, take your time and practice -- they will never get lost inside of you. If you have cramps in your low stomach or back, try putting a heating pad on the area or taking a hot bath. There are lots of good resources out there for young women -- don't be embarrassed to ask an adult for advice. Good luck! In a few years, you'll be the one answering these questions for other girls! :-)|`|50440c785cf752aff7f6573cb9515d8caa	relax, figure out which brand of pads will suit u the best- if u're not a really heavy bleeder go for always thin w/ wings- all pads are uncomfortable but those are the best- i wouldn't recommend tampons with u being so young but ur period is ur secret so the discretion of a tampon would make sense. u're gonna get cramps i suggest tylenol every couple of hours, and change every time you use the rest room. u don't want to walk around smelling like old blood- avoid caffeine it only makes the cramps worse- and lastly enjoy ur transition into womanhood|`|AA11175139	you'll hear people telling you it doesn't hurt and it does hurt.    the process itself does not hurt.    cramps are different for every girl, so you may get them bad or may not get them at all. (fetal position works well in making them feel better :])    the pms does suck though.  you'll start feeling moody before you get your period.  etc. etc.    good luckk. welcome to womanhood :)|`|e67d25d35e91227e989ca73bc58d3a92aa	Mark down when you started your period and keep track of it. It will help you from being surprised by it and not being prepared. If you have a locker at school keep pads in a bag in your locker with an extra pair of underwear just encase. Oh also keep a bottle of Advil or pamprin in that bag. Also your first couple of periods will be short and a little off schedule.|`|ed8ff18f21a09ebdcb0a483af113f79aaa	keep clean!|`|f42a26dff8929b6066c10698f99fbfadaa	best way to learn how your body is going to react to this new circumstance is to monitor yourself for 6 months to a year... keep a log perhaps... how many days... how intense the flow, the pain... new stuff can be scary - getting to know yourself will help you adjust... for the first few months, you may not be regular... you might skip a month or get it in 28 days rather than 30, the next month not for 32 days... your body will adjust    being tense and scared about it can increase both the pain and the flow so try to relax...     when I first got mine, my mom made me up a bag with an extra pair of panties and a few napkins to keep in my locker in school just in case I got my period ahead of time    welcome to womanhood, little one! :) the best is yet to come|`|ed0db8c7b5518aaaf301aeff231a5f3faa	There's actually no need to freak out so badly, it's not going away until your officially old. Anyway, typically darker clothes are the best, tampons could come in handy but are not comfortable unless you insert it right, pads are much easier to use but some brands could feel like cardboard. Always double check before going out in public for stains or visible pads or anything like that. Cramps sometimes aren't a problem at first but will happen, hot baths, midol, or a heating pad usually does the trick. PMS is also another thing that will happen, personally, I get very emotional so tend to think before I speak and avoid arguement, I definetly tend to eat more while PMSing and while on my period, just something you'll have to get used to. For the first two years or so they'll be irregular, skipping a couple months in between each period, it's a natural thing but not something you want to anounce to the world. I use the site below to keep track of when I will get my period, it's easy to use once you get used to it, after recording a couple of your periods it can tell you when you'll get your period for the next two years! But for now it will be off a day or two because your still irregular, but it is VERY useful, try it out, make an acount.        www.mymonthlycycles.com    P.S. you can I.M. me with any other questions about it or if you need more help at  chikk230@yahoo.com , I hope this helped, feel free to I.M. me for any help.

f8b4519132fca3ad3610535a5221ae78aa	Complications associated with cirrhosis include:   Variceal bleeding. Variceal bleeding is caused by portal hypertension, which is an increase in the pressure within the portal vein (the large vessel that carries blood from the digestive organs to the liver). This increase in pressure is caused by a blockage of blood flow through the liver as a result of cirrhosis. Increased pressure in the portal vein causes other veins in the body to enlarge (varices), such as those in the esophagus and stomach, to bypass the blockage. These varices become fragile and can bleed easily, causing severe hemorrhaging and fluid in the abdomen.   Confused thinking and other mental changes (hepatic encephalopathy). Hepatic encephalopathy most often occurs when cirrhosis has been present for a long time. Toxins produced in our intestines are normally detoxified by the liver, but once cirrhosis occurs, the liver cannot detoxify as well. Toxins get into the bloodstream and can cause confusion, changes in behavior and even coma.     Other serious complications of cirrhosis include:    Kidney failure.   Reduced oxygen in the blood.   Diabetes.   Changes in blood counts.   Increased risk of infections.   Excessive bleeding and bruising.   Breast enlargement in men.   Premature menopause.   Loss of muscle mass.
98dd9c89857f5b0f936290a198749040aa	Getting your heart rate up for 30-60 minutes a day is very important.  If you are overweight and have been for a while then you will have developed muscle to carry around the weight, so if you diet you also have to work your muscles so that they don't deteriorate.     My workout;   stretch  get up early and take a run / walk.    ( it's easier to lose weight if you do 8 minutes of running then 12 minutes of walking )    do 25 push-ups and 25 sit ups. work your way up as you progress  ( it helps to do it to a cd, i find eye of the tiger good. it's also a good idea to have a picture on the wall of what you wish to achieve, it might be your dream girl of the body the you want to have )     at night before bed;  skipping is an good way to lose weight ( 8 second fast 12 second slow repeating for about 3 minutes )    And don't forget that to build muscle AND lose weight you need to eat properly, don't starve yourself but don't eat pizza every day.  Eat good meals 3 times a day including meats and vegetables   and fruit as snacks in between.   Also allow yourself ONE meal a week to have whatever you want, WHAT EVER you want.  Good Luck|`|23c29ffe0b37caf3f16d0ec3d3b9c0ddaa	first off u need to step away from the scale. just drink plenty of water , run and hit some weights. the easiest way to get back in shape is join a gym membership and get on the ball|`|818701e47e4f42a1977e9935121da4deaa	You bet!  Try doing some weight training.  I used a video a few years ago by Rachael McLeash (sp?).  There are a lot of good ones out there.  Don't worry about if they are by a man or a woman.  Combine that with some cardio like jogging or aerobics or step aerobics or stair climbing- anything to get your heart pumping.  Then add some Pilates basic training untill you are ready to advance to more difficult pilates.  That will help your body by elongating your muscles to give them a more lean look as well as improve your strength and balance.    Another thing you can do, if you haven't already, is cut out any soda you might drink, including diet sodas.  My bf lost 13 lbs in a month just by swithching to water, milk or tea.  Include raw fruits and veggies into your diet.  Munch on raw carrotts, celery, apple slices, berries etc. to help boost your metabolism and overall heath.  Drink 8-10 glasses of water unless you doctor advises you otherwise.  Some people have issues with edema that can be compounded by drinking too many fluids.    The final thing I can think of is to get on-line and look up fitness training.  I can't think of the name of hand, but there is one out of southern California that trains you over the internet.  I looked into it and the lady was so wonderful, she was willing to help me for free.  There are more than that one that can help for little or no money.  Good luck and keep looking for answers to better health.|`|25f69de6352f65f9c5e9d9a4977de063aa	You should run for a bit to warm up your muscles before you lift weight's or before you start any calisthenics (sit-ups, push-ups).  When lifting weights you shouldn't keep adding heavier weights unless you want to bulk up.  The more weight you lift,  the more muscle mass you gain,  therefore the more weight you put on.  You probably shouldn't pay attention to the scale.  It may seem as if you're not losing weight,  but it's probably because you're burning fat.  The more fat you burn, the more you put muscle in its place.    Overall running is pretty much one of the best and easiest exercises because it works all the muscles in your body. If you're not a big fan of running,  riding a bike is an alternative. It takes time though.  The more time and effort you put in,  the greater the results.  Good Luck!|`|e7011e3865a56d2561e8e365d2fde8bdaa	stop driving for a while.

870cf8fc919e9e77bf463960442999aaaa	Zoloft  Pronounced: ZOE-loft   Generic name: Sertraline   Why is Zoloft prescribed?    Zoloft is prescribed for major depressiona persistently low mood that interferes with everyday living. Symptoms may include loss of interest in your usual activities, disturbed sleep, change in appetite, constant fidgeting or lethargic movement, fatigue, feelings of worthlessness or guilt, difficulty thinking or concentrating, and recurrent thoughts of suicide.     Zoloft is also used to treat the following:     Premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD), a condition marked by a depressed mood, anxiety or tension, emotional instability, and anger or irritability in the two weeks preceding menstruation.   Obsessive-compulsive disorder (unwanted thoughts that won't go away and an irresistible urge to keep repeating certain actions, such as hand-washing or counting).   Panic disorder (unexpected attacks of overwhelming anxiety, accompanied by fear of their return).   Social anxiety disorder (extreme shyness in social situations that interferes with an individual's work and social life).   Post-traumatic stress disorder (re-experiencing a dangerous or life-threatening event through intrusive thoughts, flashbacks, and intense psychological distress).   Zoloft belongs to a class of drugs called selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRIs). Serotonin is one of the chemical messengers believed to govern moods. Ordinarily, it is quickly reabsorbed after its release at the junctures between nerves. Re-uptake inhibitors such as Zoloft slow this process, thereby boosting the levels of serotonin available in the brain.     Most important fact about Zoloft    Do not take Zoloft within 2 weeks of taking any drug classified as an MAO inhibitor. Drugs in this category include the antidepressants Marplan, Nardil, and Parnate. When serotonin boosters such as Zoloft are combined with MAO inhibitors, serious and sometimes fatal reactions can occur. In addition, you should not combine Zoloft with the drug pimozide (Orap).    BEST THING IS NOT TO TAKE IT, DOES NOT SOUND GOOD AT ALL.|`|6ce05586ee87f9f0287532a104c9115baa	I think Libby didn't know what you were talking about.

Good luck to you!!    http://www.dietitian.com/ibw/ibw.html    But Wendy, I'm even more concerned about your fears about not getting a job because of your weight. I don't know where you live, but the weight won't stop you as much as your fears.     You will NEVER get a job if you stop trying. But quite honestly, a person who shows that they are friendly, willing to work hard, and willing to overcome obstacles, and is willing to keep trying has a good chance of finding work.    While you are working on your weight, I want you to also work on self-efficacy. Do some research on this topic. Once you learn that you are capable, smart, and definitely able to work hard, you will make it.

Also, you do not need a pap every single year.

ITGQoxrwaa	other things can cause symptoms  May 28, 1999     Hello: i would like to take the time to tell your readers that there are many other things that can cause the same symptoms of aids.Including: diabetes, cancer,leukemia,lupus,stress and anxiety,poor nutrition etc. If people continue to test negative but are still obsessed with hiv they maybe doing irreparable harm by not trying to find out the real cause of their symptoms. Theres a thousand things that can weaken the immune system out there.                Response from Dr. Holodniy     Agreed. MH      What are the symptoms of HIV/AIDS?  I am making the following recommendations to persons concerned about symptoms that they may be having.   Carefully read all the information found on The Body's Safe Sex and Prevention Forum. It should answer the vast majority of questions regarding symptoms.     If you are having flu-like symptoms or a rash, I cannot tell you whether these may be due to acute viral syndrome (AVS) or not. Only HIV testing at six months can determine whether a person has HIV.     If you are having any symptoms that are not going away after one to two weeks, or if your symptoms are very severe, see your physician, regardless of what you think the cause of your symptoms may be.     If you have been exposed to HIV, consider getting tested six months after a possible exposure to the virus. This is true whether you are having symptoms or not. This is the only way to know whether you have been infected with HIV.     Remember that I cannot tell you whether your symptoms may be due to HIV or not. Because every symptom associated with HIV/AIDS looks like the symptoms of other illnesses, I cannot tell you if your personal symptoms may be related to HIV/AIDS. Again, only HIV testing can determine that.  I have seen a lot of people convincing themselves that they may have HIV, based on their symptoms. Many people have tried to "match their symptoms" to that of acute viral syndrome and full-blown AIDS. Please do not do this! It's very easy to convince yourself you have HIV/AIDS based on symptoms, when in fact you may not even be infected. I have personally seen many cases where a person convinced themselves that they had HIV (based on their symptoms), went through major stress and anxiety (for months or even years), and then turned up HIV negative six months or more after the exposure that they were concerned about. I'm trying to keep other people from going through the same unnecessary mental torment. The only thing that symptoms tell you is -- if they do not go away, or if they get very severe -- that you need to see a doctor. That's all they tell you. Please do not diagnose yourself based on symptoms!     You will also note that nobody, not you, me, or anybody on the Internet or at any AIDS hotline, can tell you if your symptoms may be HIV-related, without having laboratory tests done.     That said, let me review with you the symptoms of HIV/AIDS in detail.     The following information compares the symptoms of both recent HIV infection, and the symptoms due to full-blown AIDS. You will note that the symptoms of AIDS itself tend to be chronic, long-term and can occur over and over. This differs from the symptoms of recent HIV infection, which are acute, only last for a week or two, and do not occur over and over.     When we're talking about symptoms, it's important to remember that there are actually two periods of time when one may show symptoms.     Within the first four to six weeks after infection, some people with HIV (up to 70%) show symptoms due to acute viral syndrome (AVS). This occurs during your bodies initial response against the virus. During this time, a person may show symptoms that look exactly like the flu (headaches, body aches, fevers, fatigue, etc.). These symptoms do not appear as cold symptoms (coughing, sneezing, congestion, runny nose, etc.). A rash is sometimes seen, primarily in the upper portion of the body. The rash may or may not itch, and can be raised. There is no such thing as an "HIV/AIDS rash," and if a rash is seen at all, it resembles rashes seen from many other skin conditions. All of the symptoms last for a week or two, then go away by themselves. They do not persist for many weeks or months.     In some people with AVS, the symptoms can be very severe. In other people with HIV, these symptoms may be very mild. In still other people with HIV, they may not show these symptoms at all. A person may, or may not, show positive on an HIV test during this period of time. I must strongly emphasize here that all of the symptoms of AVS look exactly like the symptoms of other illnesses, so having flu symptoms or a rash does not indicate HIV infection, in of itself. It is also important to remember that not all people will get acute viral syndrome, and in those that do get it, the severity can vary significantly from person to person. Because AVS looks exactly like the symptoms of many other illnesses, nobody can tell you whether or not your symptoms are due to this syndrome. Only HIV testing can determine if a person has HIV or not.     I have had a lot of people come to me concerned about AVS, and exactly when it occurs. Can it happen in the first hour after an exposure? The first day? The first week? The first month? The first year?     Because the symptoms of AVS are so non-specific, it's difficult for anybody to determine the exact time that this syndrome occurs. The fact is, nobody can give you an exact time, since it can vary from person to person. Also remember that during this time, a person may or may not test positive. This makes it even more difficult to determine if symptoms are related to AVS or not. All anybody can say is that the symptoms occur within the first month or so (that is, within the first four to six weeks) after infection. Th|`|26579cd948025959525b8deeec60d638aa	HIV Symptom Free Period   Becoming infected with HIV and becoming sick from AIDS are two different events. For most people, it takes many years from the time someone is infected with HIV to the time that they develop symptoms of AIDS. Some people get sick sooner and others stay well longer, especially with treatment. However, there is almost always a significant period of time after infection when an HIV-positive individual will have no symptoms at all -- often 10 years or more.   Keeping in mind the two separate events (becoming HIV-infected vs. actually developing AIDS) can help you to remember that there are also two separate time periods when someone may show symptoms related to HIV-infection.         HIV Early Symptoms  What are the early symptoms of HIV/AIDS?   Many people do not develop any symptoms when they first become infected with HIV. Some people, however, get a flu-like illness within three to six weeks after exposure to the virus. This illness, called Acute HIV Syndrome, may include fever, headache, tiredness, nausea, diarrhoea and enlarged lymph nodes (organs of the immune system that can be felt in the neck, armpits and groin). These symptoms usually disappear within a week to a month and are often mistaken for another viral infection.     During this period, the quantity of the virus in the body will be high and it spreads to different parts, particularly the lymphoid tissue. At this stage, the infected person is more likely to pass on the infection to others. The viral quantity then drops as the body's immune system launches an orchestrated fight.     More persistent or severe symptoms may not surface for several years, even a decade or more, after HIV first enters the body in adults, or within two years in children born with the virus. This period of "asymptomatic" infection varies from individual to individual. Some people may begin to have symptoms as soon as a few months, while others may be symptom-free for more than 10 years. However, during the "asymptomatic" period, the virus will be actively multiplying, infecting, and killing cells of the immune system.     Once HIV enters the human body, it attaches itself to a White Blood Cell (WBC) called CD4. Also, called T4 cells, they are the main disease fighters of the body. Whenever there is an infection, CD4 cells lead the infection-fighting army of the body to protect it from falling sick. Damage of these cells, hence can affect a person's disease-fighting capability and general health.     After making a foothold on the CD4 cell, the virus injects its RNA into the cell. The RNA then gets attached to the DNA of the host cell and thus becomes part of the cell's genetic material. It is a virtual takeover of the cell. Using the cell's division mechanism, the virus now replicates and churns out hundreds of thousands of its own copies. These cells then enter the blood stream, get attached to other CD4 cells and continue replicating. As a result, the number of the virus in the blood rises and that of the CD4 cells declines.     Because of this process, immediately after infection, the viral load of an infected individual will be very high and the number of CD4, low. But, after a while, the body's immune system responds vigorously by producing more and more CD4 cells to fight the virus. Much of the virus gets removed from the blood. To fight the fast-replicating virus, as many as a billion CD4 cells are produced every day, but the virus too increases on a similar scale. The battle between the virus and the CD4 cells continues even as the infected person remains symptom-free.     But after a few years, which can last up to a decade or even more, when the number of the virus in the body rises to very high levels, the body's immune mechanism finds it difficult to carry on with the battle. The balance shifts in favour of the virus and the person becomes more susceptible to various infections. These infections are called Opportunistic Infections because they swarm the body using the opportunity of its low immunity. At this stage, the number of CD4 cells per millilitre of blood (called CD4 Count), which ranges between 500 to 1,500 in a healthy individual, falls below 200. The Viral Load, the quantity of the virus in the blood, will be very high at this stage.     Opportunistic infections are caused by bacteria, virus, fungi and parasites. Some of the common opportunistic infections that affect HIV positive persons are: Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC), Tuberculosis (TB), Salmonellosis, Bacillary Angiomatosis (all caused by bacteria); Cytomegalovirus (CMV), Viral hepatitis, Herpes, Human papillomavirus (HPV), Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) (caused by virus); Candidiasis, Cryptococcal meningitis (caused by fungus) and Pneumocystis Carinii pneumonia (PCP). Toxoplasmosis. Cryptosporidiosis (caused by parasites). HIV positive persons are also prone to cancers like Kaposi's sarcoma and lymphoma.     The Center for Disease Control (CDC), Atlanta has listed a series of diseases as AIDS-defining. When these diseases appear, it is a sign that the infected individual has entered the later stage of HIV infection and has started developing AIDS. The progression of HIV positive persons into the AIDS stage is highly individual. Some people can reach the AIDS stage in about five years, while some remain disease free for more than a decade. Measurement of the viral load and the CD4 count helps a doctor in assessing an infected person's health condition.         Later Symptoms of HIV  Following are the later symptoms of HIV:   Lack of energy   Weight loss   Frequent fevers and sweats   A thick, whitish coating of the tongue or mouth (thrush) that is caused by a yeast infection and sometimes accompanied by a sore throat   Severe or recurring vaginal yeast infections   Chronic pelvic inflamm|`|HcBJQ2DAaa	its hard to tell if someone has aids or not. aids victims can be alive for up to 10 years or so...you could only really tell when the virus  is really advanced....im not an expert but i suggest if you have doubt go immediatly to take a blood test in a clinic or if you suspect someone else might have aids ask him/her to take a test  ware protection when haveing intercourse(for your protection and your partners) and dont let or touch any blood or semen specially if you have an open cut or sore on you... unfortunately there is no cure for aids but an early detection can help ..|`|BEGRO6N6aa	Once full-blown or frank AIDS takes over when t-cell count dips below 200/mg of blood: symptoms may include, but are not limited to: kaposi sarcoma-cancer of the nerves       Pnuemocystis Carinii-a really bad infection of the lungs       Oral thrush-yellow white yeast on the tongue       Neuropathy-Dementia, Forgetfullness, swelling of the brain                                 nerves       Severe waisting-weight loss       A form of TB       Hodgkins Disease-lymph nodes are affected       Salmonellis-like salmonella poisoning        severe diarrhea-up to 20-30 times/day       Shingles       Epstien Barr Virus-like Herpes  There are plenty others because these are all opportunistic infections that people with AIDS succumb to, especially because AIDS is the effect of HIV completely weakening and ruining the immune system.|`|xAt7b75Qaa	It is not possible to reliably diagnose HIV infection or AIDS based on symptoms alone.    People living with HIV may feel and look completely well but their immune systems may nevertheless be damaged. It is important to remember that once someone is infected they can pass on HIV right away, even if they feel healthy.    As time passes without effective treatment, HIV weakens an infected person's immune system, making them much more vulnerable to opportunistic infections. These infections are caused by germs that are around us all the time but which can normally be fought off by a healthy immune system. Once HIV has broken down the body's defences, such infections can take hold and produce any of a wide range of symptoms - some of them very severe. Certain cancers also become more common when the immune system is weakened.       Such symptoms are, however, not caused directly by HIV, and they can't by themselves be interpreted as definite signs of HIV infection or AIDS. A diagnosis of AIDS requires signs of severe immune deficiency, which cannot be explained by any factor except HIV. This generally requires an HIV test.    The only way to know for sure whether a person is infected with HIV is for them to have an HIV test

To find out whether a hard patch of skin is a callus or a wart, your doctor will scrape some skin off the affected area. Warts bleed, but calluses just reveal more dead skin. The distinction is useful because warts are viral and resist treatment. Most calluses are easily correctable. Hereditary calluses can be more difficult to correct.  What Are the Treatments?    Most corns and calluses gradually disappear when the friction or pressure stops. To avoid corns and calluses on the feet, wear correctly fitted shoes and moisturize skin to keep it soft.    Most foot doctors discourage the use of over-the-counter salicylic-acid corn remedies. Applied improperly, corn plasters can kill healthy tissue around the corn. Properly positioned moleskin pads can help relieve pressure on a corn.    A doctor will often shave the top of a callus to reduce the thickness.    Oral antibiotics generally clear up infected corns, but sometimes pus has to be drained through an incision. Over-the-counter antibacterial ointments generally don't work on infected corns, because most staph bacteria are resistant to them.    Hydrocortisone creams may help remove cracked calluses. Apply the cream and cover the area overnight with a plastic bag or a sock. In the morning, rub off as much of the callus as you can with a coarse towel or brush. Using a pumice to rub the dead skin from a callus after showering, then applying urea-based cream, can also be effective. Do not try this with corns! Rubbing will just make them more tender and painful.    You can consider surgery to remove a plantar callus, but it is likely to come back anyway. A better approach is to keep your feet dry and friction free. Wear properly fitted shoes and cotton socks, not wool or synthetic fibers that might irritate the skin. If a podiatrist or orthopedist thinks your corn or callus is caused by abnormal foot placement or hip rotation, orthopedic shoe inserts or surgery to correct foot deformities may help correct the problem.|`|6xkCqYNsaa	sport boots|`|db17230ef5f985482e63c7790fee8dd1aa	You will get corn caps in any medical shop.

The Health Minister is absolutely clear on this matter.    The alternate belief is that  in some matters Governments, elected by the people, have a duty of care to ensure that people, especially the vulnerable (Yes I mean kids) are protected from exploitation and disease.    This is the demand economy facing off to what we might call logical decisions about government.    Kids are getting fatter and will die younger. Of course junk food shouldn't be allowed in schools. However I guess that there is a lolly lobby contributing to Liberal Party fund raising. Only with a change of Federal Government could this happen.

Loosing weight is simple, Try to eat a bit better, and smaller portions, and increase excercise. Now, dont go down to 200 calories a day, and 4 hours on a treadmil. Youll never stick with that, Just eat less than normal, and excercise more than normal. That could even be something simple, like always parking your car in the far end of the parking lot. If you do anything to drastic, youll never stick with it.|`|5IKrjCHiaa	I have lost almost 100   in a year, I quit eating bread, chips etc. Eat more whole grains-but be careful if you eat lots of whole wheat products you may get gas!! Drink water, not soda including diet soda, if you drink coffee or tea switch to decaf. Caffeine makes you crave carbs. Eat lots of fresh fruit and fresh produce not processed foods if at all possible. Exercise will help too but I am not really into it and I have lost alot of weight!.  Sit ups may be old fashioned but do flatten the tummy, walk a dog or ride a bike, go swimming just get out there and have fun!|`|ojUIx2Bhaa	Heck let's trade; I have to lose 60lbs by Oct 6 to attend a wedding where tons of family who haven't seen me fat will be at!

Try to eat about 7 times a day.  3 medium portion food meals and 7 meals like protein bars, non-acidic fuits, and even popcorn.  Hit the treadmill.  A good treadmill will let you set it so that you can lose weigth and simply hold onto the bar and walk.  Be sure not to eat anything over 5 grams of fat.  Jamba Juice can be a life saver.    Good Luck!|`|rD89CgbQaa	Losing weight is an indivual process that is very unique to each person. While there are some general guidelines to consider, I have found that is also very much an 'inside job'. As a Wellness Coach, I work with individuals to assist them in creating and sustaining new thought and behavior patterns in support of optimum health and wellbeing. I offer a free initial session for guests to be able to see if this is something that would be a fit for them. (Scroll down to the bottom of the page of www.impactyourlife.org) I also found a really neat program, that is FREE, called www.joesgoals.com. Another reasonably priced program is www.accountabilitybuddy.com. You CAN do it! Simply take one small step at a time! Each step taken, no matter how small, will lead to the next...and the next....You CAN DO IT :)|`|AA12256283	you cannot ,unless you deprive yourself , not on diet alone .exercise is the key .believe it from someone who's been there . i"ve lost weight fast and gained it all back .slow and steady wins the race.|`|uAigWviWaa	1) Don't eat sugary foods, because they will mess with your blood sugar levels.  Human bodies weren't made to process massive amounts of sugar.  Your body will be tricked into thinking you ate a huge meal based on the small amount of sugar you actually ate, and it will overcompensate by lowering your blood sugar too low, and this will soon cause you to be hungry again.  This is especially true of Diet Soft drinks, they actually cause you to gain more weight than regular soft drinks in this way -  so don't let the 0 calories fool you.  It's better to drink water, but if you insist on it you might as well drink regular Coke.    2) Eat slowly.  You won't have to cut too much stuff out of your diet if you just eat more slowly.  It takes your body about 20 minutes to process signals from your stomach telling you that your full.  If you eat more slowly you will become full before you've eaten too much.  Just make sure that you put your fork down in between every bite, and chew your food thoroughly.  Just think of it as you're savoring the flavor.    3)  Put smaller portions on your plate.  If you load up your plate you will feel the need to eat it all so it doesn't go to waste.  All the food that you need should be able to fit on the palm of your hand - so use as your benchmark.  If you are still hungry after eating it very slowly then you can always go back for seconds.    4) Don't eat after 7pm.  Your metabolism slows down as you get ready for bed, and any excess carbs/sugars will be turned into fat.    5) Don't associate eating with other activities that you will do all the time.  For example, if you eat all of your meals while watching TV. you will associate TV with eating.  Soon, every time you watch TV you will want to eat.  Try to set meals apart from other activities and places as much as possible to avoid becoming hungry when you don't really intend on eating.    6) Avoid obvious unhealthy food as much as possible such as fast food and other greasy or sugary foods.    7) Exercise!    There you have it, you don't have to go on any crazy diets where you eat only tofu and you don't have to kill yourself exercising.  Just eat slower, eat less, stay away from the obvious bad food choices, and stop bad habits before they start.  Otherwise you can basically eat what you've been eating already.  Everything in moderation!

27de7d1ba64806527f175af6ca27ea90aa	There are a lot of factors to consider when making this decision. If you choose to be with this person, wait a while before having sex. When you do have sex, make sure to use a condom. What STD is it? If it is HPV...it is very common and there is no test for males. If it is herpes, you can lessen the risk of transmission by using condoms, taking Valtrex, and from abstaining from sex during obvious outbreaks. If it is HIV or AIDS...that is trickier because it is the most serious of STDs. You would have to be sure that you could be devoted to that person for the rest of your life...because both of your lives could be drastically shortened by that disease.    Bottom line...think long and hard about YOUR health before making that decision. But love can definitely overcome any STD.|`|2cb6e1f0dbb7f2f45af49db79f400cb3aa	Honestly. sex isnt everything !! love and relationships are far beyond JUST SEX !!! that being said ... if the relationship is at a stage where sex can take a back seat ... stick to the person they need u more at this hard time than anything else .... and if the relationship is not somethin to die for ... be there as a friend but .... explain why !! simple ... cheers and take care|`|34d0d2df147f28eaf79577b97444ed97aa	Are you saying STD or DST?

A lot means - atleast one and half litre per day and if you can drink two litres will be better. I can gaurentee you that your problem will go away. Every hour if you drink one glass, it helps. Please try it and see, it will go away within a week.  Any medicine you take there is a side affect and Indian medicines are poor quality and no one is there to check them, please do not blame doctors if the medicine doesn't work.  Water works fine with almost any kind of stomach problem.

But if you are a tall guy then you've got a huge problem. It's good to here that you are running 3 miles a day and plays basketball too, but if you really want to have a bigger or more built kind of body, try adding push-ups and sit-ups in your everyday activities. Sorry, not everyday, put a one day distance each time you have your exercise. You see, if you are going to do it everyday, your muscles will become numb to the exercises that you are performing. Try doing 50-100 sit-ups, and 50-100 push ups. Then rest for the other day.

I have worked in health care most of my life, mostly in the elderly population. I have seen more than once a perfectly "normal" elderly person go in for surgery and come out with dementia. I have also seen perfectly normal middle aged people come out of surgery having associated panic attacks. It doesn't make a whole lot of sense but it truly does happen. Anesthesia is a necessary evil and as one of my professors (an MD) once put it...If they listed panic attacks and memory loss or impairment on the possible side effects page...it would be a huge liability, one the medical profession is not willing to take on..|`|8RWZRhJSaa	Well i can honestly say I think it does alittle. My 10 year old daughter had open heart surgery last year, and after she woke up from surgery she started freaking out and crying because she didnt realize where she was, why she was there, and so forth. Well I calmed her down and after she woke up again she asked me where she was and so forth again. I told her what happened and she was ok, but for weeks after that she didnt even remember the 5 days she spent in the hospital before the surgery or the surgery itself. So i am a firm believer that it does to a certain extent. Good luck!

Nunca habia fumado nada antes de llegar aqui pero descubri que la shisha no tiene ningun ingrediente danino para la salud asi que dije: por que no probarla?

La Chicha es el nombre de una variedad de bebidas alcohlicas derivadas de la fermentacin del maz y otros granos originarios de Amrica, pero tambin de frutas como manzanas y uvas.   Son bebidas en toda Amrica Latina desde antes de la llegada de los espa?oles.   Por lo general es una bebida suave, de no muchos grados alcohlicos.  La Chicha, se elabor en Amrica del Sur antes del surgimiento de Imperio Inca.

xXhuxyMkaa	You didn't tell if you are taking something now? Bioforce has a very effective medicine called Plantago. Well equipped pharmacies sell it, and health food stores sell it for sure.    If you are on a medication, ask your pharmacist if Plantago could interfere with your medication. Naturally, pregnant women should always consult a practitioner/ doctor before they supplement/ use any remedies.    If your symptoms continue, visit a doctor.

Children with chronic ear infections really don't improve using antibiotics, as proven in their own trials.  Many chiropractors treat children with ear infections with very good results.  When the 1st cervical vertabrae is out of place it causes pressure on the eustacian tubes, so the middle ear can't drain properly leading to infections.|`|707gOCvbaa	Hydrogen peroxide is great. Just pace a cup full in each ear. Tilt head sideways and pour cap full in ear. It will bubble so you know it's working. Repeat until bubbling is gone. hold head upright and wipe ear canal out with a piece of paper towel or tissue. Repeat this twice a day to whichever ear is the problem. If your ear feels too wet you can warm dry it with the blow dryer. Hydrogen peroxide is so inexpensive and it's great for gargling when you have a sore throat and it removes blood stains. I can tell you a million things to do with it. You have to mix it with water to gargle. Just read the directions on the back. Use full strength for your ears. good luck.|`|zqYdkP2Waa	A proper diet and good health are always recommended when concerning your health. Garlic is a good remedy for ear infections.

suVispAAaa	I know there are a lot! I guess there are a lot of unhappy people. These are tough times, & instead of dealing with it they think they can take the easy way out. That is not the way is goes or the ways of life. God never gives us more then we can handle,so people should deal with it like the rest of america instead of taking the easy way out. It is sad & i hope those people change their minds..there is a lot life has to offer & the only way is to live life through the good & the bad..there is a reason we are all here..so deal with it..people should not say they are going to take their life every time something bad happens or life doesnot go there way, that is what life is. Life is not fair.

4PK0hiWeaa	I really doubt you have walking pneumonia with just the chest pain as a symptom. You need to see a doctor.  Chronic fatigue with chest pain is something that needs to be investigated thoroughly.|`|Z0GfGZtJaa	Go to a Dr.  and if you want entertainment go to symptom checker at Web MD|`|v2xUy1dXaa	go to the doctor or the school nurse.

I am not a heart specialist, but I have bradicardia, which has symptoms like yours.      Your heart seems to be slowing down.  Go see a a doctor and/or a cardiologist, NOW!|`|Wxvyh4xgaa	Sounds like Thyroid! I have hypothyroid.... wow,TIRED,dizzy and just out of it.

0MUwB3Czaa	I think you answered your own question.  You need to do cardio to keep slim and remove excess fat around the abs.  And you need to do lots of sit-ups, crunches.  My two cents running along with doing sit-ups and crunches will help get that six pack abs.  Don't obsess over those pics of models with six pack abs.  Most are altered or they fast for a few days to get that definition.          http://yourmetamorphosis.blogspot.com/|`|c5fdd1055ef5c13d92a60f82e7ed0c16aa	first off, take a look at your diet. you can do all the exercise and crunches in the world, but if you are not eating properly, it will not matter. eat  6 small meals a day, every 3 hours (healthy food), do cardio 5-6 times a week for 45 minutes to a hour. every 2 days do ab work. do different stuff, change up every 2-3 weeks.|`|uurgL3oZaa	You need to have something like 2 percent body fat. That's pretty hard to achieve.
dgRTkccBaa	usually it's every 3 months.  Yep, just get the medication from the pharmacy and go to the doc to get it done.  If you're not sure when you're due call your doctor and ask, they'll be able to tell you.
WjPTqIdUaa	Just ask your parents dude.    Also a lot of the time with people being uncircumcised, the foreskin doesn't go over the head because they have a large pennis. Like I myself am not circumcised, so soft it covers it, but erect the skin pulls back all the way cause it can't stretch that far.|`|i3pn4jNcaa	some peoples foreskin isnt as stretchy as others. if you were circumcised then you wouldnt see ANY foreskin at all|`|lCvJHS13aa	The foreskin length can be of different lengths naturally, some only cover part of the head, yet some extend past the head maybe more than 10-12mm.  Usually the longer it is, it is less likely to automatically pull back during an erection.|`|zOIgzIy4aa	it won,t when your erect.|`|PAvYZJK2aa	yes you could and you can do it now|`|3jFm0rWdaa	You can be circumcized as a child and an adult.

SZdVYrSSaa	Almost any reputable dentistry will recommend you to an Oral Surgeon, who will remove the wisdom teeth ONLY if they are endangering the surrounding teeth, or if they are impacted and rotting inside the gum.    They will not ask you to have them pulled today, and likely this will just be a light cleaning and some X-Rays to see if the procedure is needed. If it is, don't panic, they will schedule another date for the procedure, and on that day they will walk you through the process, give you a little twilight gas, pull the teeth without you even knowing, and the next thing you know you'll be awake 4 hours later with a hand full of pain killers and plenty of nice soft foods to eat.     I had 6 impacted teeth removed (Yes 6, not 4, I have a rare condition commonly known as "Vampire Syndrome" where I grew a third set of very long, sharp, K-9 teeth that needed to be removed as well) and it went swimmingly.     No need to worry at all.    (And most dental insurance covers the surgery)|`|PPFonRYdaa	I had all 4 removed. It really wasn't that bad at all. They knock you out and you don't feel a thing. Afterwards they'll give you some good painkillers and you'll feel fine.     Yes, they'll send you to an oral surgeon if you need them removed.|`|0le6RYndaa	It is common for wisdom teeth to be pulled out if there isn't enough space for them to come in properly.  They most likely will not have to take you to another doctor if they need to remove it.  Don't worry, I have had teeth taken out before and it isn't painful after you are numbed.|`|WNB4Vojsaa	just think, that by Sunday you won't feel a thing|`|dd1c8373d258bab9181f891f88ea8dafaa	A dentist cannot remove teeth, only care for them and fill them. Exractions are made by an oral surgeon.    They wont do anything today you dont want them to.|`|AZRj3vaLaa	they will probably look over the x rays with you and refer you to a oral surgeon. you can request to be put to sleep while having them removed but it cost more and sometimes insurance wont cover it. i have anxiety to about going to the dentist so i have to be put to sleep or  i have panic attacks.|`|M7lOK6DWaa	i had to go to an oral surgeon to get mine out. They most likely wont do it today because you are most likely going to be put to sleep unless u request to be awake. what they will do is you wont be able to eat or drink for a certain amount of time and they will take you in and put you in a dentists chair and put an IV in you. they will keep talking to you until you fall asleep. they will extract the tooth and wake you up. you wont even remember what happened after. They will take you to a waiting area cuz you wont be able to walk barely and you sit til your okay to stand and  walk. everyone reacts different. i had 2 different appointments the first time i was all giggly and cooky and the second one i was crying hystarically for no reason.   its okay to be nervous. i cried before my first appointment because i was scared. they will give you extra gauze to put in your mouth to help with the bleeding and they will give you pain killers most likely vikes. thats what they gave me. they will also give you a special mouth rinse you have to use every day for a week. just remember that after its over you need to not drink out of straws or eat hard foods for a few days as this will increase the chance of dry socket. they gave me a coupon to get a milk shake at mcdonalds bt i had to eat it with a spoon lol.   anyways its nothing to be super worried about...almost everyone has to have theirs out at some point.   good luck =]|`|f4zHMZ1iaa	If they're just now looking at doing x-rays, probably not. They will probably be able to tell you if it needs to come out and then reschedule.|`|7ygicWvzaa	No they won't take it out TODAY.  But they can recommend that you set up an appointment to have it taken out.  So relax for today.    I keep being told I SHOULD have my wisdom teeth taken out.  They are not bothering me but dentists want you to get them out because they are hard to brush and can be a breeding ground for bacteria which in turn will cause problems later in life.  They recommend to get them out while you are young (as in teenager) because the older you get the more painful the recovery.    I heard the recovery is not that bad.  They give you enough drugs to deal with it too.|`|Kkxl8jchaa	I had all mine removed any the only thing that hurts is the needle and that really wasn't that bad but if the tooth is growing in fine then they can leave it in but if it is impacted then you have to pull it. as long as they give you pain killers you will be fine just make sure to take them before the Novocaine wheres off!!!! or you will be in pain. but its really not that bad at all|`|nvbhQb95aa	if they are taking x rays today they probably wont pull it today. i had my wisdom teeth removed all at once they sent me to an oral surgeon and i didn't feel a thing during or after  don't be scared.|`|jLyzs7aXaa	omg i had my wisdom teeth taken out and im only 15. When they took them out....OUCH!! I had surgery on them and after the anesthesia was wearing off..the pain started to freakin hurt really bad. I actually and honestly looked like a puff ball on my face...:[ so i didnt go to school for about a week. i felt like i lost 5 pounds cause it was sooo hard for me to eat.i stayed in bed alot and i fell to asleep alot too.    But the good thing about it is that when you turn older, its harder for it to heal which i mean by, it might take much longer than teens. And also when you take it out now, you don't have to take it out when your an adult.Yes they will bring you to an oral surgeon like me. Don't be scared just take it out now so when you have your wisdom teeth forever it starts to hurt and it also makes the teeth next to it, cricket. So don't worrie, get it over with.|`|8HnLYjK4aa	best to get it done and have it over with. if you get some pain killers and sleep a lot it isn't that bad depending on your tolerance for pain.|`|44eaCT4Zaa	I work in a dental office.  True that for wisdom teeth extractions, you are referred out to an oral surgeon, however extractions of molars, etc can be done by a general dentist.    As for your procedure today....  They will not do the work unless you are having the extraction on just a local.  If you are being put under (which you will be unless the wisdom tooth has fully erupted), they will schedule an initial consultation to get the x-ray and do a medical history... Good luck!  don't drink from a straw or rinse for a few days - you need to let the blood clot remain to keep from getting dry socket.  Dry socket is extremely painful..|`|YnzCyaWuaa	I doubt they will do it today.  They may tell you they need to today while you are there.  I had all of mine removed at once and it gets better.|`|TDJsIjfyaa	Don't be scared at all,you wont feel much pain at all but allot of pressure and a pinch ,it will be over in then 10 mins .

CLcGxHpAaa	I take 300 mg of Seroquel every night.  I have read that this is sometimes used off label for Tourette's Syndrome.  I take it as a sleep aid and a mood stabilizer.    The worst side effect I have experienced has been weight gain.  About 20 - 30 minutes after taking my dosage, I become intensely hungry and will eat almost anything.  I try to control this by retiring to bed almost immediately after taking the dosage and keeping only healthy snacks in the house.  I have had a few scary experiences with blacking out (after moderate amounts of alcohol were consumed, I should not have been drinking any alcohol so this is entirely all my fault).  I also experience drenching night sweats and vivid abnormal dreams (but am not sure if it is due to the Seroquel or Effexor XR).    The good outcomes are that I can get a restful nights sleep and my racing thoughts and paranoia are pretty much nonexistent.    I personally believe the positives outweigh the negatives.  I credit Seroquel for giving me my life back.    I wish you luck!|`|bvoZZY3uaa	My Wife has Tourettes and she takes haloperidol, she only takes a small amount due to side effects, she still has tourettes but not as bad.

Flossing removes bacteria between teeth and under the gum line where the toothbrush is unable to.Brushing everyday is also essential in order to remove plaque and tartar buildup which can cause bacteria to enter the gums.|`|0q2B11ygaa	well i read something that said the stuf in the toothpaste is no good for our teeth at all anyways so ... my gran is 91 and still has her own teeth and she always used ashes from the fire and that must work and how they say to soft bristle well she begs to diefr she used hay as a toothbrush so take  that u dental people....     and as for me i brush my teeth like 3 tiems a day to make sure they're clean b.c i wanna still have mine when im 91 years old if i live that  long..

OWtx0a8taa	hey,      there is an easy way to lose weight, swap all the bad habits for ither stuff, like swap full fat milk for non fat or very low fat milk, swap chocolate, potato chips and candy for fruit and vegetables. also incorporate this with exercise, at first start walking, and gradually build this up to a jog, and finally a run, i know you must be thinking its impossible, but i weighed 230lb and i went by this and in 8 weeks i was down to 185lb (and im 15). the exercise is most important - when exercising you boost your metabolism by 8 times! and it stays high after exercising, and exercising gives you that "feel good factor"  hope it helps :)|`|3d1XRIzkaa	First, Quit drinking Soda Pop, even Diet Soda. Start drinking water.  Cut back on your portions. When you eat, take small bites and chew your food slowly.  For breakfast, eat a bowl of Special K or Cheerios, using Skim Milk.  For Lunch, have a salad or a  turkey sandwich.  For Dinner, eat some type of Lean Meat, a vegetable, and a pasta salad.    Between meals, if you get hungry, drink water, or eat some dry cereal.|`|CGaIacw7aa	The best thing I can recommend is make sure to get at least 1 Hr a day of solid exercise. Drink tons of water and cut back on ALL soda it helps weight to drop quicker. Try to drink green tea because it speeds up your metabolism! Hope all works well!
P3MLLjCRaa	10 sets of 10 reps is way too many. Add more weight and don't do more than 4 sets. And no, you'll plateau (when your body gets too used to a workout regime) and you'll stop seeing gains.

Ctu4vtTwaa	I always thought these kind of days would make me gain weight.

But anyways I weighed myself this morning and i didnt gain a single pound so i dont think you will either.    Oh yea and before the party i ate oatmeal with cereal on top|`|niZBsn9Qaa	you'll notive a weight difference on the scale, but it will be water retention. Not fat, I mean, worse case scenario, maybe half-a-pound because it takes 3500 calories of excess calories to gain one pound of fat, and you burn at least 2000 calories a day with normal body functions so that's an excess of 1500....no more than half a pound.    relax
kCM1counaa	I am 6 foot 2 and 183 pounds or 13 stone.  I am a little on the thin side and would like to build up a little more weight, but here is what I am:  Chest 39 inch  Waist 33 inch  Bicep 13 inch    Ideally for 6'2 i would be 205 lbs or 14.6 stone with 44 inch chest, 33 inch waist, and 16 inch bicep, so for you at 6'1 it would be a few pounds less, like 199, and the measurements about the same.

kj507W26aa	This is a very hard thing to do but it can be done. Everyone gains weight after quitting cigarettes.  I'd rather gain the weight and be healthy then to have lung cancer, and an aged wrinkley face.  Exercise to take that temptation or urge or habit of having something in your mouth away.  This will take you up to a year.  Snack on healthy stuff not foods loaded in sodium like sunflowers seeds or corn nuts.   But really do exercise, walk, jog, run, do aerobics, swim, play sports, start weight lifting.|`|TP5hXhVDaa	I have done:     the patch, didn't work really bad rash around the patch, makes your heart race.      I have also tried wellbutrin - which was prescribed by my doctor..  they say it helps with quitting smoking, did not work had weird dreams, plus if you look it up on wedmd it has a lot of horrible side effects.    I have attending the smoking support groups - no go on those either.. everyone is talking/supportive in the class and as soon as they got out to their cars they lighted up.    I have tried hard candy, gum, putting a rubber band around your wrist and snapping it when i wanted to smoke. sore jaw from chewing gum all day and a red wrist!    I quit for 1 year while I was in the Army.  it was hard and did not work for me.  I guess you have to have the will power to do it!  I wish you all the best in the world.. Save all the money you spend on smoke and put in a coin jar or account you will be surprise how much you will have in one year.    the gum - taste like licking an ashtray! gross  I want to quit someday my self, but i have to want to do it for my self. You should not do it for anyone else.  Once you are ready you can do it!    best of luck to you!

AA10131801	The healthiest way to lose the weight is gradually with diet and excercize. You don't want to come off unreasonably fast. So that being said, I wouldn't try to loose more than 2 lbs a week. 1 to 1and 1/2 is reasonable and you won't have to worry about putting it all back on once eat something indulgent. Good luck and don't forget to eat healthy with veggies and whole grains.|`|ej6OdnDBaa	oh yes it is very possible   do cardio workouts 3x a week and eat healthy   eat veggies, fruits, and grains   you can count calories and try not to exceed 2000

MyMCIzOlaa	IF your brother hasn't committed any crime, he has nothing to worry about.  Seems like your parents are worried that he might not be innocent, or that there is something else to hide.  There is A LOT of stigma attached to this type of thing, but imagine the stigma when your brother is caught, tried and convicted!  Much less emotional pain involved if he gets help now.  If your brother or parents have the means ($$ or insurance) I would recommend your brother get evaluated by a mental health professional (therapist, etc).  Contact your local county mental health department if they don't have the resources.   I don't know how well pedophilia responds to treatment, but I think it would be better treated the earlier it is confronted.  Once a person crosses that line, it makes it a lot harder to not cross again.  If your parents aren't able at this time to call it what it is, it's important that somebody does.  Avoiding your brother's pedophile tendencies is the same as enabling him to continue down this path.  If he wants help and your parent's aren't able/willing to help him, who will?  (Check out the wikipedia link for TONS of great information, including specific treatments)|`|YO1w7gpiaa	The day your brother asks for "help"   is a good day.  Look in the blue pages in the front of your phone book, or simply dial 411  "Mental Health" is the listing you are looking for, in your area.  If for some reason you can't find it, call your local hospital ER and ask for the number of Community Mental Health / Behavioral Health.  These people are professionals, and usually the ones the court refers people to.  Go there.    As far as getting your brother to walk through the door for the first time, consider driving him, and sitting with him in the waiting room.  This will not be an easy thing for your brother to do.  While you're with him, try to talk little, and listen much.    You are doing the right thing.  Yes, this is the best thing you can do for future victims.    A word about the police.  I've learned by experience that they will take a report, but as far as court goes, the District Attorney may only take the most "winnable" cases to court.   Part of what they are looking for is a "track record" of similar complaints on the same person.  1st timers often get off.  So, diligence at reporting every incident is necessary to get the court to help your brother.|`|Fq3vo0kOaa	Your brother has a sickness that only intense therapy can help, the thoughts of touching children is unnatural & it stems from many things, was he ever abused as a child? that you know of?  People just don't "become pedifiles", something in their minds tells them that they can get the love & attention from someone younger without judgement or ridicul...   Have your brother get help, see a psychologist or psychiatrist, if there have been no accusations against him then he can't be locked up for having these types of thoughts, but if he has taken his thoughts to actions then they can lock him up if there are victims that will come forward..   Sounds like your dad is ashamed of him, thats not supportive at all & at his age he doesnt need your parents to go get help, left alone his thoughts will turn to actions & he will act on them when he gets weak, he will turn to molesting children & will end up in serious trouble & destroy many lives.. before he gets caught & put away..

He's 19 now, and legally an adult.  Talk to him yourself and see if he'll let you help him.  If he wants help, please help him get the therapy he needs.|`|jWmnSXlLaa	I don't think he can get into trouble if nothing has happened he needs to tell someone he has these thoughts. I am sorry but your parents are very irresponsible. If they ignore this it will NOT make his feelings,temptations or urges go away. It will only make them stronger. One day he WILL hurt a child and your parents will be just as responsible. I hope you never leave your children alone with him? I agree he needs help. He is old enough he doesn't needs parents consent to receive help or treatment.
73nTYgdraa	Being active EVERY day and stop stuffing your face, meaning eat healthy.  Wouldn't hurt to have at least three days a week where you actively work out.  The problem with most people is their eating habits. Even if they try to work out they still have their food which cracks their plans. Eat healthy, but don't forget to actually eat, which is the biggest issue, people stop eating, thinking it will get them in good shape. Not only will it make you gain even more weight/fat when you do start eating again, you'll ruin your body by starving. You might also fall into eating junk food and shitty food cause of your hunger.|`|9AT3RPyVaa	sit-ups, pull-ups, jogging|`|IFs6MWDJaa	Walking/Jogging/Running   Followed by  Sit ups/Crunches   and  a proper diet|`|c5fdd1055ef5c13d92a60f82e7ed0c16aa	eating healthy and doing  cardio 5-6 times a week for 45-60 minutes, but remember you can not spot reduce|`|N7YeTlGWaa	walking  or bike  skipping rope.

Here's something for you:    If you starve yourself your body thinks that it will not be getting anymore food, it's defence against this is that any food in your body will turn into fat, so you will actually add your fat content not reduce/stop it. It's simple; Don't eat less, eat healthier!

I always used http://www.nhs.uk/Tools/Pages/Healthywei... previously, as it's the NHS website, but they don't give you a number anymore just show you on a sliding scale, presumably for psychological reasons.  If anything, you should eat more.

Maybe you join the circus.|`|6sPcYQr0aa	It doesnt really matter what you eat (besides the obvious junk food) and when you eat it, as long as it has the nutrients your body needs and you give it to your body when it needs it.  You cant forget protein, which is not only a main building block for your body but for your mind as well. I will explain.  One of the worst things you can do to your body is stop eating. Your body needs fuel just like your car needs fuel. And just like your car, the better the fuel and oil is, the better the cars performance, the better the food and liquid is that you put in your body with too make you "run" better.  If you are trying to lose fat. Try to raise your metabolism by eating smaller meals, more nutritious meals, and about five or six meals throughout the day.  Also, remember that if you are working out you are also building muscle, and muscle weighs more than fat does. So as you lose the fat and gain the muscle your weight might not adjust for a while until your muscle building reaches a plateau and your body begins to really tare away fat.  If you do not want to eat five or six small meals a day. Eat three meals a day, smaller portions, then between breakfast and lunch have a healthy snack or meal replacement shake, and another between lunch and dinner.  The idea is to teach your body to get rid of all extra fuel it doesnt need, which are fats, carbs, and simple sugars for the most part. And once your body begins to understand that you are giving it the fuel it needs when it needs it, then your body will no longer store fat cells as a fuel reserve.  It is also a good idea to use a body cleanser, or detoxify before beginning any change in diet. Especially if you are going to begin eating healthier. The process might cause head aches or muscle cramps depending on what your body has become used to. Also diarrhea is a common side effect of most cleansing programs, but dont worry this is a sign that your body is getting rid of the toxic substances. The cleans will help your body to easily extract the nutrients it needs from the food you intake and bypass the rest as waste.  To expedite the process it always helps to concentrate on full body workouts to keep energy storage empty. Also, drink water, water is used to clean your body inside and out. Stay away from caffeine and soda.  This will take time. But once you are able to achieve routine with your eating habits it is one of the easiest ways to keep the fat off.  So with this, your diet can be very flexible as well. You can have sweets and things but for best results I would stay away from all simple sugars, like candy.  Good luck and God bless.|`|Lq1OjNfeaa	is this a serious question?

I0B0trk6aa	I f'cking hate that drug. Took it for 2-3 years and quit a year ago. I'm all the worse for it; slow and robotic and constantly dysthymic. That's not to say that any other antipsychotics are better.     If you are bipolar, they will certainly get you off your high, but Sero suppresses dopamine and serotonin, which are key for maintaining happiness. This will maybe stop you from being manic, but it may launch you into depression.    I'm sorry for your situation, truly; but I'd advice against all antipsychs. They were designed to replace lobotomies, and to that purpose they work. They destroy the brain in more than one way. If you must take one, don't take it for more than 1-2 months.    This may sound futile, but maybe you should take a blood test, see if you are lacking any minerals. Eat less red meat and take Omega-3 (which is often lacking in bipolar/schizo/depressed people) with some vitamin C or D. Take a mineral supplement. These are all harmless, yet can potentially correct a deficiency which might be causing some of your probelms.|`|zauQuf29aa	My daughter who is in her twenties has taken seroquel and found little improvemnet.

YEd9Q5KZaa	I honestly do not understand how people can **** or piss without washing their hands. Like, most of you who said you don't wash your hands are saying that everything is dirtier than your dick but like, how do you think everything got so darn filthy? If taps get dirty from people going to wash their hands, then that is just proving that your hands need to be washed!|`|E64juLwJaa	Studied Biology:what do you think?

But when I'm in a public / work toilet(s) I see so many guys go out without washing their hands. I've even seen surgeons in changing rooms go to the toilet and leave the changing room without washing their hands. I can't give a percentage but often it seems like 60% wash their hands. I don't watch people in the toilets but I've seen people on their way out do only a very cursory hand rinse which to me didn't seem worth the bother. Many who do wash their hands don't bother to dry them properly. People all seem to have different standards. Thus, I always try not to touch the water tap after I've washed my hands and I try to get out to the toilets / changing rooms without touching the door handle. Sometimes in public toilets I don't want to touch the manky taps but when I have to I let them turn themselves off rather than me turning them off - or I use a paper towel to turn them off. I'm probably obsessive!  Actually I often wash my hands before going to the toilets as well.|`|uiVEaxjqaa	eww that's nasty every body should wash their hands after that but I herd that only 45% of people wash their hands after going t the bathroom.|`|yijmoNbSaa	Of course!  Not doing so is nasty!  Granted, it took me more than 25 years to come to this realization.    There is a "deeper" explanation for washing one's hands that everyone, so far, seems to be missing.  It involves the First Commandment - Do unto others...You would want someone else washing his/her hands before he/she accosted you.  So, you, being this way, should wash your hands before accosting someone else.    This also means that you don't go looking to shake everyone's hand after you've done the deed until you've had a chance to clean yourself.    The Harvard/Yale joke someone else used as an answer makes my skin crawl.  THAT is so wrong on so many levels.|`|ClCQIjZHaa	I do Doc|`|cpQU51teaa	I always wash them after taking a leak|`|a1566efb5533aa90596e330bc315a547aa	it's so dirty when you know a co worker doesnt wash. u just want to yell at them!|`|e9YFTyzZaa	I AGREE with, 'eqaddix'!

I know it might seem gross but think about everything you touch in public that is probably more dirty than someone's junk and no one ever asks anyone to wash their hands then.....|`|DIxbib1paa	Yes - Personal Hygiene, I wouldnt have it any other way!|`|3AY5lS9saa	Yeah I agree with the guy about the taps although my penis is cleaner than public bathrooms it has been inground in me from my chilhood to wash your hands afterwards|`|jXK0YZvfaa	i think i saw this on 20/20.... i would do a quick yahoo search for it...    ....and yes, i do wash everytime|`|0OZ9dsUjaa	about 75% of the time peeing and always for anything else.

y4SUDnpaaa	Since this  problem has been going on since childhood it's past time for help.You say you feel if you were in a cocoon. That's a sign of depression.I used to feel as if I were encased in a bubble or something and no one could reach me and I couldn't reach them.  Also when someone has suffered from depression they sometimes begin to identify themselves by the degree of depression.  In  other words if someone were eo ask you to give your biggest trait it would probably be depression. If that's how you see yourself, that's how others will see you too and be kind of standoffish, making it even harder to make friends. Im not naive enough to think I just solved your problems. You need professional help for that. If for no other reason that you;re keeping all this sadness bottled up and one day it will explode. Sit down with your parents and tell them honestly how you feel, without being accusatory. If you have to  print and let them see this question. You've acted this way so long they probably accept it as normal for you. How do you expect them to read what's in your head and heart?|`|MD5VMBqraa	i am not normal,what am i? ... depressed. no seriously. i know.      ask for help. which is easier said than done.|`|AA10264002	you need to go to a psychiatrist and tell them what your telling us.|`|nr96BgWfaa	you are obviously experiencing some type of depression, which is not unusual and nothing to be ashamed of.  life can be a letdown especially, when you have overcome obstacles.  the other side of conflict isn't always what's its cracked up to be.  there are millions of ppl out there going through the same thing.    go to your doctor, tell them what you are experiencing and how you are feeling.  i'm glad you posted.  it is time you reached out for help.    good job!  and good luck to you!|`|Fq3vo0kOaa	You have to 1st ask yourself-- What do you think is normal???  What Society thinks is normal may not be what you think is normal!   You have to do things in your life that make you happy, don't let others dictate your happiness.   Your not clueless you sound very intelligent..  You need to search what makes you smile, what makes you happy, what makes you feel good about you!!   Don't try to "fit in", be yourself... let people like you for WHO you are not who they want you to be!!   If you knew me........ you would understand why i say this....   I was pregnant at 18....... married at 18......... divorced at 28 because  i was told "it is the proper thing to do is marry the father".... i was beaten, abused & let a wreck.. but i picked myself up... made my life w/ my children (2 by the end of a 10 yr mess of a marriage).. and i live happy as a nurse, with my boys....   Make people like you for you... don't base your happiness on others or you will be disappointed my friend|`|5C2OAukqaa	Simple, You are probably Clinically depressed if you are saying all of your life you have been like this.|`|wQOBzTexaa	wow this is sad you are not very normal but try to make some friends life is life try to live every moment of your life or you might have a depression try to see a doctor but you cant live all your life like that. and don't try to kill yourself because you hate life|`|aIiGOudwaa	I am in nursing, and what you describe to me first of all sounds normal in the sense that many people feel they do not fit in.  The issue that sounds unnormal to me is the fact that you always feel this way, and you say you are always unhappy.   Many people show symptoms of this when they suffer from depression.  Depression is not like the media and movies make it sound.  It is treatable and is nothing to be ashamed of! Now I cannot tell you if this is one of your problems, however I would really suggest going to talk to a doctor or nurse about this problem.  Could you go to a walk in clinic? It's likely that you could be depressed and this could be affecting your relationships and feelings.  And do not feel as though you have no reason to be depressed, because this is not always the reason one is.  Sometimes its just because we have a chemical unbalance in our body.  Almost like someone having diabetes.  There is no shame in it if this is your problem!   Please talk to a health professional about this as maybe they can help.    And if it is not depression I would suggest that maybe you feel this way for a few reasons.  But I really could not tell you anymore suggestions without talking to you more.  I would suggest talking to a school counsellor or again going to your doctor so he can refer you.  It is wonderful to talk to someone like this about our problems, because they are so knowledgeable is helping!  Good luck and don't give up! And seriously consider my suggestions to you... it might really be a HUGE help!|`|BvHb1mpqaa	You answered your own question...  You described yourself as not ugly, nor a bad student, nor crazy, nor retarded, nor autistic... It seems to me that you are in the situation you're in because you chose to be there by not hanging out with more people or just doing something that will help you have friends, etc... You have to stop making yourself feel bad and start thinking positive things. Enroll in a sport or something you would like to do, once you are doing that, you will come across people who have stuff in common with you, hopefully you make some friends, hang out, express your feeling, do whatever makes you happy.   GET OUT OF THE COCOON, IT'S TIME TO ENJOY LIFE!   Best of luck.|`|iKD1JUg1aa	your just different then other people you see life and everything else different from everyone.....im really different from everybody i know it ok i like to be different you just need to find people who think like you.....i also think you might be depressed a little....you should try going out and leave the cocoon your in go out and see life ....go to a night club or any place besides what your not use to....and dont worry about your future  worry about the present you only live life once dont have it be a unhappy life that you lived make it the best you can by being who you are not like everyone else... cause what makes you happy might not be the same as what makes the next person happy dont worry about what people think....you are who you are and if that different then better for you it makes you unique and not a follower like everyone else in the world...|`|Cq5y5cgJaa	it sounds like depression, u need to ask 4 help, my dad is going through the same thing. u need to please. ur a human being, God loves you so much, u need to get help before it turns into something horrible!

SErhF1OSaa	Please get yourself some help!!  Talk therapy would help you alot I think.  It helped my Husband when I was depressed(major), right before my manic episodes.    I don't think that MI is contagious per say, however, I believe that if you are living with someone with a MI, and not getting help, you can become depressed-severely.  I believe that it is a situational depression, and once you remove the situation, the depression starts to release.    PLEASE for yourself(and children??)  Get some therapy for yourself....maybe your spouse would even go with you a few times if you tell her it's for you, because you need help.  I know that this sounds like tricking her into going, but maybe that's what she needs.    Good Luck  Momma P    May Angels Walk Beside You|`|ERaIVdN8aa	Like you said, you can't "catch" it, but the constant stress of dealing with somone who has a mental illness can cause symptoms in yourself.    If she is a danger to herself or others, you can have her admitted, during which time she would get a proper evaluation and possible diagnosis.  If not, I would pick a time where she seems stable enough to carry on a normal conversation and explain that if she does not seek help, you are going to leave.  I know it's a hard thing to do, but it may be the only way to "force" her into getting treatment.|`|7P3TSjaZaa	Admit her to a counseler and keep it a secret to. Dont mention it, but this is a last resort. Heres what to do first. When she screams and yells say very nonchalantly very easy and calm no matter how mad you are at her, tell her how could we make that better. If she pushed it off on you ask her what can she do to make it better. Try to get her to admit that she hs a problem it will take some time i promise. But sometime is better than no time. Just try and pray about it. Youll know what to do just trust God to show you. He will I promise.|`|C4AUC5vGaa	Believe me, they can make you feel like you are losing your mind.     If you share the same doctor, you could go in together to talk and see if the doc can help.     Make sure that you try and stay as mentally healthy as possible. You may need to join a support group, so you have the skills to deal with your wife.    Even after your wife gets treatment you have a long journey ahead.    Good luck and stay strong.|`|6x2fLyvMaa	That is pretty serious and you really should be getting professional advice. I'm not saying your the crazy one and need help or anything - I'm saying that you need proper advice on this question. I seriously recommend you seek pro advise ASAP, and one more thing  - unless you are 100% sure it is the right thing to do, DO NOT DO THE THINGS PEOPLE ON HERE RECOMMEND YOU TO DO UNLESS IT'S SEEK PROPER ADVICE! - because the last thing you want to do is the wrong thing, right? :) goodluck.|`|f757ce8d8c9cc22eb2e7163ea2ef4196aa	wow dude im so sorry. yes you can go sort of crazy. actually what will happen is her stress will become your stress. you'll start feeling tired and agitated. try this. i have depression and this totally helped me. try giving her saint johns wort. twenty first century brand if you can find it. this stuff is awesome.from what i know from experience is people with bipolar think and think and think and think. so theres so much thinking going on that their thoughts get all confused. its really easy for them to go from super happy to totally bummed. try this herbal supplement. its cheap and you don't need a prescription. and the cool thing is it works immediately. so start her off slow. only give her one pill each day for about 5 days. if its not enough go to 2 a day. this was sufficient for me.there are no sexual side effects. its got a similar strength like Prozac but its not Prozac.  but still this is like an antidepressant and should be monitored. the only possible side effect is photosensitive. but i haven't experienced it.     what i first noticed was the racing thoughts went quiet. this was almost immediately after i went to 2 pills. then i noticed more energy. i didn't feel so weighted down from stress. then it actually helped me sleep. its to me the perfect pill. id really like to know how it works for her. so email me at skysmama77@yahoo.com. remind me of your situation and let me know how it works for her.|`|nKLc64FIaa	you can't "catch it" but being around someone who has a mental illness can cause extra srtess on you and stress effect us all different.Being around a person who is Bi- polar can be chanllenging. I would know i am Bi-polar... if she really is Bi-polar she needs medication it will help you both a lot... if she is truely Bi-polar not only is her mental health is at stake but my pyshical health is at stake too. Its an illness in the brain and futher damage can be prevented thru the right medications.    So my advice to you is to have her evaluated and see whats up with her... if it turns ou she's not Bi-polar there are other things that can be wrong something may be bothering her, she may need to seek help from a counslor... and if worse comes to worse its just who she is... you may have to learn to deal with it or you may have to leave her... but you have to do whats right for you. If you can't get her evaluated because she doesn't want to admit her problem you have to tell her that she needs to do it for you because thats what love is. And if she still denies there might be a problem then you have to do whats right for you and your own mental health
1634875a2112f90de61c5b890983ed03aa	I worried about being infertile at 13 so I don't think this is abnormal.  I think it's very natural for a girl to dream about being a mom someday.  Think about it - we played with dolls when we were little, we pretended to play "house", we dreamed about our weddings and acted it all out.  Girls, we've all been there.  Now I'm a mom of 2 beautiful children.  My worrying was for naught, but I do understand why you worry (especially if you have a family history of infertility).  But, don't let it consume you.  The chances of you being infertile are pretty small.  And, the technological advances to help with infertility are amazing.  Just enjoy being 13!!  From my own experiences, I hope you can enjoy your teen years, and I'm sure you'll be a happy and successful mom someday (just not too soon).|`|UZxeBrxQaa	Most 13 year old girls on this forum need to worry about fertility, not infertility.  Especially the ones who brag about giving their virginity away and wonder what they should wear.|`|fk9AvB25aa	13 is too young to be worrying about infertility. It's when you get older you should worry about things like that. Your fertility usually gets lower when your past 35. It's usually painless and has no symptoms. There are things that you can do to keep your fertility levels up but once you pass menopause (if your female) then you usually are infertile after that.|`|9CCXPGXqaa	I would say No they shouldn't be worried about it right now.
KPtrfsEYaa	calorieking.com is pretty good, but my favorite is livestrong.com has a sister site call mydailyplate.com and it tracks everything for you from calories to carbs and protein.
ed05090e60ffb81604e4d4052b697bd6aa	Yes Bronchitis is contagious. I remember bringing it home and getting everyone sick. Even though you are on antibiotics now, your brother caught it from you when you were still contagious. When we catch colds it takes a few days to actually show.|`|9MoqnvWRaa	It shouldn't be contagious because you've been on antibiotics.|`|bfb88160853edd441f13c069712a5c16aa	Bronchitis usually comes on after the start of a cold.  The Bronchitis is contagious, because the cold is contagious... bronchitis is just part of the cold.   And sometimes then, the viral bronchitis turns to bacterial bronchitis.  Both can heal without antibiotics but some doctors will prescribe antibiotics.
SDiNKp8oaa	Get a new one. I still smell my deodorant from yesterday. Really, I just did a pit check.|`|bqdeD8JHaa	The odor is from bacteria breaking down sweat and skin secretions, it becomes worse if moisture is present. Each person's body/skin is different, unfortunately some provide the perfect conditions for strong B.O. to form quickly and deadly. Switch to an antibacterial soap, ensure that you thoroughly and completely dry your crotch and armpits before getting dressed, there's anti-bacterial talcum powder you can buy that will help keep you dry, and use an anti-perspirant deodorant rather than the regular kind.  Do all these things and you should be rid of the odor (provided you're not "recycling" your undies, lol).|`|E64juLwJaa	You sweat during your sleep and cover that with a spray:that does not work  Shower in the morning and use a stick deodorant.  If you want your body to smell nice:spray EDT on it.  Planets.|`|60ApQsGOaa	try shower in the morning! wash off all the nasty crap you sleep in.

Deodorant just kills the germs on the surface of the skin and leaves a little bit of scent. It doesn't stop you from perspiring. So, when you perspire again you get more germs and hence more smell. So, you can put the deodorant on several times a day or just use antiperspirant.|`|rNdun1V7aa	yikes, you need stronger deod. and or to reapply it often. it's your hormones...talk to your doc. also maybe some powder for the crotchal area???|`|NEA9bsbdaa	christ|`|LvdP3xX5aa	i think ur just naturally smelly u cant help it embrace ur smellyness    SMELLY FKKAAAAAAAA|`|cWjrtIlKaa	Get a stronger deodorant, or bring some with you.

If that doesn't work, just don't go in public.|`|73U1wJmnaa	Deodorant works by absorbing odors. But once all the deodorant you put on absorbs all it can, it doesn't work any more. You also might be going through puberty. I don't know how old you are but this can be a cause for your body odor. Try using like acne cream in your armpits, and around your penis, NOT ON!!! It can really burn if you rub it on your penis. But by putting on the acne cream, it dries the skin and keeps it clean for a long time. Then when you get out of the shower, put your deodorant on. And you can spray body spray in those areas also. If you don't want to put cream on, use talcom powder I don't really like this because im sexually active and don't want powder in that certain area. But it does work. It keeps you dry in those areas so sweating doesn't occur. Sweat causes bacteria to grow, making body odor. I hope this helps.|`|QePbhS8Caa	When you're a teen hormones can go a little crazy and you put out more body odor than normal. So it might be a temporary condition.    Like everyone else said, stop using the spray. You need a good strong antiperspirant and you should probably carry it with you so that you can reapply it as needed. Change your sheets every day. Shower in the mornings, not at night. If you want a little scent maybe try a body spray that's not too strong. If you've got a lot of hair going down there, it wouldn't hurt to trim it. Hair holds scent. Hell, that's the whole purpose of hair in the underarm and crotch area. Smell used to be very useful in attracting a mate.    Talk to your dr about it. Sometimes excessive body odor is due to dietary issues, bacteria in the body or illness. Couldn't hurt to get checked.|`|5msDR7hZaa	don't use the spray....
YEd9Q5KZaa	I had no friends all through high school, I know what it's like to be lonely. All I want to say to you is suck it up, and deal with it. Don't kill yourself over this, it isn't worth it, and you're so young. Stop looking back at how things used to be and change how things are going now...you need to make an effort to get what you want, don't just expect people to come your way. Life isn't about friendship.|`|UIDfTmbcaa	hmmmm. Lets see... I have tried that route twice. Once in the woods where I knew no one would find me. Had a homeless guy walk right past me as I was bleeding out. Imagine that a homeless person just happened to be out in the woods where I thought no one would be. 2nd time was worse and was hospitalized longer than the first time both in the hospital as well as the mental institution. Point is I am still here. I must have a purpose. The best way is top find professional help. Thinking that you can fix the situation is wrong. Just pick up the phone and dial 911 and tell them what you told us. That you want to die. They will get you help. They will give you a support system until you are able to  resurrect your social life and become productive.|`|MpKU6BPgaa	aww thats sad! i will be your friend. dont kill yourself! you should see a therapist to help you out. you can talk to me any time you want. good luck|`|3OzLxd4Laa	Hey man I know how you feel about your break up. I too had the same exact situation and I was really depressed. I know you probably heard this a billion times but, time will heal everything. I thought this was bull *** when I heard it from my friends but it's true. Also, she's not out of your league. Don't put yourself down like that. YOU are too good for her and SHE is missing out by not being with you. Think positive. I know it's hard to do if you're depressed, but try. When I was depressed, I went to North Carolina for 2 weeks for vacation over the summer. That little time there was like a rebirth for me. I had a new sense of direction in life. I started to work out, get healthier, study more, and do things that I always wanted to do (Mixed martial arts is one of them).     Bottom line, the dark is always the darkest before dawn. Hang in there man.|`|CBCEyns1aa	hmmm two options...one of which is your own...and im sure you can guess what the other is:  just make some new friends...its not that hard, not everyone is an asshole in this world  just ask around, if people dont wanna be your friend then fine, **** them    your 2nd option is to find a gun and shoot yourself...whats the worst that could happen after death?    burning in hell for all eternity...but the chances of that are very small...god would have to be a sick bastard to do that to someone    you'll probably just feel nothing, wont be anything, then again everyone else will be gone too...in fact you wouldn't even notice everyone being gone because you wouldnt even be able to think.    ~Oh and as a akward side-note:  don't you already consider yourself dead? you've lost your friends and apaprently all you do is mope around all day, killing yourself won't accomplish anything but if it's really your only resort then go ahead.|`|y2Uks58paa	join the club lol same thing happend to me, in highschool I had tons of friends, star football player, and was invited to all the parties. Then highschool ended along with all of that. I finally realized that everyone goes their seperate ways after highschool its just life.You now have a chance to start all over and should be excited. dying is the easy way out, not to mention selfish. if all else fails dropout of college and move out of the country, at least thats better than death haha|`|RoUqUimwaa	DUDE, I completely understand what your coming from.. Ive been in the same boat. Ive though about death alot and feel lost and useless too sometimes, but you have to stay strong and positive. Are you religious? A good way to fulfill your spirit is by faith.. faith in yourself and faith in what you believe in. You say your a athlete, try to join a team.. Or join some clubs, there are so many things you can do to meet new people. Just don't get in with the wrong crowd, at this point in your life, it sounds like you need to put yourself with people that are interested in you and who you are. And there are people out there in the same situation like you that will do that.. Keep your head high, life is hard sometimes, but not always. You control your life.

GKn6S9ycaa	Ola Kael, minha sugest?o  voc pesquisar em Fitoterapia e Agronomia. Para cultivar plantas medicinais algumas informa??es s?o importantes. O tipo de solo onde voc vai fazer sua planta??o (muitas plantas medicinais perdem % de principio ativo quando plantadas em estufa e isso afeta a rentabilidade porque  necessrio fazer doseamento antes de coloca-las  venda). Verifique tambm as plantas que podem ser plantadas juntas, tempo de crescimento, necessidade de gua, colheita, etc, para n?o cometer erros simples que p?e em risco toda a planta??o. Antes de come?ar, verifique como voc vai escoar a produ??o, se tem a inten??o de revender voc mesmo ou se vender para terceiros, veja a documenta?l?o necessria junto  ANVISA porque exatament por serem medicinais voc tem que comprovar teores minimos de principio ativo (vai precisar de um controle de qualidade prprio ou por laboratrio terceirizado). V conhecer um revendedor de plantas, entre no site da Santos Flora, e depois entre em contato com eles.  Boa sorte e n?o desanime porque  um negcio extramamente interessante e prazeiroso.

Energy In/Energy Out    Food Intake: 1,200 Per Day    One Pound equals 3,500 Calories    To loose one pound per day, You need to burn your food intake plus your one pound of fat    1,200 (intake) + 3,500 (Outtake) = 4,700 Calories Burn    You must burn at least 4,700 Calories everyday to loose one pound at least. It is very easy to go up and beyond 4,700 calories each day.    Best way to do this is to track your progress on a calorie counter monitor watch. If you do it by the numbers you can loose the weight. It is just a matter of changing the way you think about weight loss.    Once you start wearing your calorie counter you can see the numbers increase and you fill find yourself doing extra things in your day, like tapping your foot while waiting at the light in your car, chewing gum, singing out loud and so on onto of your workout routines. You begin to see that everything you do in your day contributes to the overall numbers needed to loose that pound.        Water Intake/Less Storage    Most people do not get enough water in their system. Water is your body's principal chemical component, comprising, on average, 60 to 80 percent of your weight. Every system in your body depends on water. For example, water flushes toxins out of vital organs, carries nutrients to your cells and provides a moist environment for ear, nose and throat tissues.    Lack of water can lead to dehydration, a condition that occurs when you don't have enough water in your body to carry out normal functions. To determine if you are getting enough water use this simple formula.. Take your weight, for example 150 pounds and divide by 2. Take your answer which is 75 lbs and change it to ounces, in this case 75 ounces. That is how many ounces of water you need a day. Your body performs mostly on water. If you make sure you get enough water everyday your body will perform at top notch and your body will no longer have the cravings of junk food. You will have a better performing body system to help you work out and feel better thru out your day.    Good Food    My favorite things to eat:    Avocado Wraps    Simple: Low Carb Tortilla, Half Avocado sliced, alpha sprouts, lettuce, soy bacon...Just wrap it up and eat. You can vary the things you put inside so long as you keep it to approx 4 or 5 items. You want to make sure they are fresh, low calorie and filling. Avocado and mushrooms can replace meats in your meal and still have great taste.    Special K Cereals are fantastic. They have that sweetness that one craves and is so good for you. Calories are low. Great for even just dinner.    First thing in the morning...A Glass of Chocolate Milk. Yup!! Chocolate Milk. We all crave that "got to have" item in the morning. Milk is the best thing you can have for yourself while working out. The chocolate (and you can use Carnation Instant Milk for this but I simply use Nestle dry mix) will give you that sweet "snack" that you need. If you give your body a little bit of it and its in a control way, you will not crave sweets and junk the rest of the day.    Lean Cuisines    Fantastic food! Each meal is approx 180 t0 380 calories per box. So think about your calories. 1,200...You can still have several of these meals a day and still be under your intake requirements.     Its all about the numbers and watching what you take in and what you burn out. And you know what..If you go over your 1,200 mark for food intake...thats okay...you simple up your total calories burned for the day by what you took it. So long as you burn off the over all calories to be more than your food intake. Just make sure you stick too it so you can reach your weight loss goals.    Fruits and Veggies    All you want on the schedule listed below.   Bananas are my favorite. They are very filling and can make a meal all on their own.    ____    Vitamins    My favorite is ONE A DAY WITH ENERGY...I am in love with this vitamin because I am just like everyone else who loves those quick fix energy drinks. But what people do not realize is that energy drinks can contain 120 to 440 calories in just ONE Can. If you think about it..That is HALF of your allowed calories for food intake. The best alternative I have found is One a day with energy vitamin. Easy to spot, it is packaged in a green label bottle. Just One vitamin a day will give you as much energy as approx. 1 1/2 cans of red bull...WITHOUT the calorie intake.   WoW..now your making progress already because you have made more room in your intake calories for actual healthy food.    _____    Soda/Carbonation    Carbonation is terrible for your system because it bloats your stomach. And when your stomach bloats, your jeans just don't fit. You can drop one pant size simply by NOT drinking any carbonated drinks all together..Take away the bloat and you have instantly just made it one pant size lower. Besides, Sodas dehydrate you and with that One a Day Vitamin, you won't need the Caffeine in the soda and it will also cut out those extra calories that you don't need.  So remove that soda and the energy drinks and just think how much calories you just instantly removed from your daily intake. I normally consume what...four sodas and two energy drinks in one day...that is a total of .... 900 calories. Of what??? Nothing...Those are horrible calories and calories that can be replaced by food which will fuel your body for your day and your workouts.    ____    Your Body    Your body is like a computer. You must program your body to do what it is suppose to do so it won't crash and leave you with a virus. Your stomach is only the si|`|lWi989Tqaa	Losing weight (and inches) is a simple equation: if you burn more calories than you eat, the weight will come off. Start off by estimating how many calories you burn each day using the daily calorie needs calculator http://straighthealth.com/pages/tools/ca...  This will give you an idea of how many calories to eat. Healthy weight loss is 1-2 pounds per week. To lose 1 pound per week you need to create a calorie deficit (burn more than you eat) of 500 calories per day. To lose 2 pounds a week, you have to double the deficit to 1000 calories per day.

Da geh?rt die KV dazu. Dazu musst du bei dem zust?ndigen Sozialamt, oder wie immer das in deiner Stadt hei?t einen Antrag stellen.  Aber vorsicht: wenn Du mit Deinem Freund zusammen in einer Wohnung lebst, kann es sein, dass ihr als Bedarfsgemeinschaft zusammengefasst werdet. somit w?re sein Einkommen dann das Haushaltseinkommen.  Du hast aber nach dem Sozialgesetzbuch, Band X einen Anspruch auf beratung in solchen Fragen. Mach darum einen Termin mit dem zust?ndigen Amt aus, die sind verpflichtet dir Deine Ansprchen auszurechnen. Schlimmstenfalls stellst du dann halt keinen Antrag und alles bleibt wie es ist
AubmEoYgaa	He's just trying to scare you into sex, don't play his game. Tell him to do what he has to do, but you are not giving in. I don't know how old you and him are, but if he has any love and respect for you, he should understand. If he doesn't, time to look somewhere else. I admire and respect what you are doing young lady, and I hope the best for you and that things do work out, but only in your favor.|`|5debee918420491ae93ce443dfcac6d1aa	this sounds really common.  a plea to get you to put out.  perhaps what you should do when he tells you that he's going to kill himself because he can't stand the pain of not having sex, is inform him that you feel the need to tell his mother and father about your fears that he may kill himself if he doesn't have sex.  etter yet, let him know that you're going to tell your parents so that they can talk to him.  that might change his mind.  or if you put out, he can always use that line to get you to put out anytime he wants sex in the future.|`|kOO4pGGPaa	well ussualy alot of guy just want sex him straight up hey i dont think im ready for sex and as for killing himself i think he is just saying things to get you  to do it  maybe you could look up couples masterbation or something that isnt that serious you know|`|aOzRusojaa	It sounds to me like he is desperate for you to put out....  I don't know a single guy that doesn't masturbate, it shouldn't make you want to kill yourself.   Just be honest and tell him that you care and would like to help. Make it clear that you are not ready to put out, but you don't want him to feel the way he does.... what can you do?|`|yPqk8diuaa	omg. typical adolescent ploy to 'score'.  You should know that by now.  Tell him he's better off with Rosie and you need some space.  Find someone who understands and respects your choices.  I've never ever heard of anyone killing themselves because they couldn't get laid, LOL!  What a lame excuse.   Dump him yesterday!|`|7RwuzQmJaa	Your boyfriend is just playing at you when he said like that. No guy ever say that he hates himself being so horny that he almost kill himself. Surely, your boyfriend wants you badly to have sex with him and that's it! But don't make him feel that you know his motive, just try to give him some advice and words that might divert his mind from thinking so much about sex.|`|k1abFBVHaa	just have a sex with your boyfriend that's the best way to do and masterbate his penis and lick it|`|gYVYKTZ5aa	Its normal just give him something to excite him like watever you want.|`|AA10698872	Well I don't know you personally, maybe you would like to do it for him once, or perform oral on him meanwhile your fully cloth and he is not he he.  Anyway he sounds young 14-18 he is in his sexual prime he will never be this horny again for the rest of his life after about the age of 18.    If you 2 are not in love he will leave you or he will cheat on you.  If he is a good guy and will not cheat on you, he will masturbate with pillows, small dogs, cats, stuff animals And i would bet he would hump you with your cloths on. Its up to you do what you want, be he will be nothing more than a horny puppy dog for the next few years.|`|enoCg5nyaa	maybe get a little handsy with him. but you have to draw the line somewhere. make sure he knows your boundaries and that he respects them.|`|tLzsZb0Zaa	If he it is getting really serious I recon its probably hes got sex addiction.    Or maybe he does want to have sex and is just saying that he "doesn't want to" but actually hinting you to make the first move?|`|zw7tqvzmaa	theres no way to stop it just try and keep him from suicidal thoughts. Like asking him how much hed miss u and stuff
Y8rB9iuHaa	Yes, they can use it again, but the recovery of use depends on the condition of the tissue and the amount the nerves can grow back again.    Ideally the digit or limb is placed in ice soon after severance so as to preserve the flesh.    This kind of surgery has been around for a long time.  I knew a guy who had his hand cut off back in the 60's, but it was re-attached and he recovered full use of his thumb and 2 fingers.  In fact he went on to become a bass player in a local band!|`|AA10119874	with today's medicine it is possible to re-attach a limb.  It would take a long time for the nerves to reattach, so it would just 'hang' there for a long time.|`|o7KAh1XLaa	i don't know how it works but sometimes they can reattached and make it work but not as well as before they may only have a little movement.    |`|loPSF48Waa	Yes you can, sometimes in a limited way.  The finger needs to be wrapped in clingfilm and put on ice (NOT in water - it will shrivel up).  Make sure all parts are gathered up as we cannot grow another nail.  Success depends on the amount of muscle damage and it needs to be re attached within 6 - 12 hours.   The rest is up to luck and the skill of the surgeon.
mkhUwgsUaa	i really dont know i just started going to the gym i only go like three times a week because i only need to loose like 5 pounds but i dont know thats the question im wondering 2!!|`|AA11548204	sounds pathetic but its the fact...when you start hitting the gym,you got to be smart enough to find and plan alternative workouts that you can do at home to maintain yourself so that you can actually avoid gaining fat if a necessity arrives in future to forego the gym membership...and yes,portion control of food intake with calorie shifting techniques implied with enough discipline is equally vital for the same objectives...|`|yPqk8diuaa	No, that is not a truth.  It depends on your metabolism.  If you have a high metabolism (biological process that breaks down fat cells basically)  then you don't have to exercise as much as someone who has a lower rate of metabolism.  That's why some people can eat anything all the time and not gain weight (or as much weight) while other people have to watch what they eat, diet and/or exercise to lose weight.|`|FdF06btraa	Yea its actually true!! Because your used to it and your body has a sudden stop and all the weight that was about to become muscle gets put back on your stomach! This is what  heard!
tUT4y84maa	Yeah I would say you are fine.  If you can do all that then you are just in tip top shape, like olympian shape.  If you are eating healthy and don't get sick much then you're okay.   There isn't anything wrong with being small either, if people are saying stuff to you, they are probably concerned too, but they have a touch of jealously associated with that as well.  If you have doubts ask your doctor, but you sound as healthy as a thorough bred horse.|`|RI2u8MH0aa	You are small for your size but if you like how you look who cares what other people think. Usually 5'4 116 is a healthy weight for you. I envy your ambition to work out so much. I am jealous, I wish I could say what you just did.|`|IUbQLNllaa	I would echo Jennifer's comments, right on.|`|0eIIhokiaa	yeah you're fine, but i think you knew the answer to that
bb5e7e2013f001f52c989dc5d8402748aa	That depends on what the problem with your speech is (voice, articulation, motor speech, stuttering, breath support, etc.).  Speech therapy also varies based on the individual's very specific personality, environment, needs, wants, prognosis, etc.  Maybe you should start with going to a Speech Therapist to get a diagnostic and a home program.      You can find one for adults by going to the American Speech-Language Hearing Association (ASHA) website's "find a professional" section.  Here is the link:  http://asha.org/findpro/|`|SYD8v6P2aa	You might be able to get speech therapy at school thats what i did.  
ciXSjbCiaa	You haven't established a diagnosis of diabetes yet. I would do that first. Was your blood sugar 186 when you were fasting? If so, yes, that is high. However, if you had eaten a few hours earlier, etc then obviously that result means nothing.   You need to get a diagnosis first. Diabetes is not something you can manage w/o a doctor. If you do have it, they will figure out what type (1 or 2) and give you a management plan. |`|7z7de65zaa	Go to your doctor to see if you are truly diabetic. Until then cut down on sugary snacks and food. I drink water and unsweetened ice tea. Both will not affect your blood sugar.    When I had gestational diabetes one of my favorite snacks was peanut butter and whole grain toast. Best advice I can give is to eat healthy and cut down on carbs and other sugar and see your doctor.    Want more healthy snack ideas check out my buzz blog in my sources.|`|C9H0hQbPaa	You should see a doctor|`|AA10815957	Try diabetes.org     they have alot of info. Also go see your doctor for a a1c reading, that is your bllod sugar level over the past three months. Your 186 could be ok if she tested  after you ate a meal. But your A1C will really see where your blood/sugar levels are at|`|BhFeii5Xaa	Check out South Beach phase 2 or Atkins phase 4 food plans. Some of the foods your grandma listed will send me over the moon such as the cottage cheese and banana!!    You must do some very careful reading and shopping.    But before that, GET THEE TO THE DOCTOR ASAP!!! Your grandma nor I want you to have to deal with things like nerve endings in your feet giving you he**, or your eyes going all to he**!! High glucose numbers do a thing to the tiny blood vessels and nerve endings first.    For breakfast I eat bacon and eggs and a slice of Oat Nut toast with butter!  For lunch usually a chef salad, different dressing every day to keep it interesting.  For dinner we have a small piece of meat cooked anyway I feel like cooking it, a salad, and sometimes fruit.   For bedtime snack I have half cup of real ice cream!!    But do check out the South Beach food plan. I have lived with it for the past 12 years!!

As for not being able to get pregnant after having your appendix removed! Only if they take your girly bits as well|`|d1099196c69e4cab121ff3fed73860e9aa	your appendix has nothing to do with getting  pregnant unless the surgeon cut out your ovary as well (very unlikely) The appendix is part of your large intestine, and really has no purpose.it just is a 3 inch long finger sized appendage.|`|XzmCtu81aa	The appendix does serve a function - it harbors a population of 'good' bacteria.  When you get sick with diarrhea and the gut sheds its lining, its contents (including the good and bad bacteria), the appendix is a large source of the repopulation of good bacteria necessary for digestion.    It has nothing to do with pregnancy|`|AA11744038	The only thing your appendix can do is just hang there unless it bursts.  The only time it is harmful is if it is to burst and leak infection into your body.  Sometimes people who experiences it bursting and this poison has reached certain parts of their body they may experience trouble.  Let's say that by chance this reaches one of your ovaries, it may cause it so that this ovary doesn't produce eggs anymore.  That's okay, though! You still have another ovary that is capable of producing eggs.    Although in some cases some ovaries don't produce eggs.   So, if the other one is damaged somehow, this may cause you not to become pregnant.    If the toxins from your bursted appendix reaches your abdomen to where it's damaged both ovaries, it can cause you not to be able to produce eggs- which therefore means not being able to have kids.    I wouldn't worry yourself too much.  Odds are you'll be able to have kids just fine.  It's a slim possibility that if it did burst and the infection spreaded, that it reached both ovaries.  Though, it has happened.|`|eEZnCvaAaa	Your appendix does nothing, just a useless part of your body at the end of your intestine.    There is no way that would change your ability to get pregnant....|`|AA12305031	no, it was prob referring to a problem with the procedure, and the surgery went wrong etc.  The appendix has no function in pregnancy.|`|PXplwKsVaa	The appendix has nothing to do with pregnancy. |`|6Z1fZvwpaa	Your appendix does nothing....its obsolete. thats why it gets clogged, then removed. whoever came up with that myth is a ******* idiot.|`|e3aae293c8a87fddef9fd7171c3274abaa	If it were true, then it would certainly be a miracle that my mom had two pregnancies after having an emergency appendectomy!|`|f7yoKUU8aa	that is not a sex organ!!  that has to do with storing bial in ur digestive tract.

0qFKEmnLaa	Auf jeden Fall schneiden!    Gegenber Lasern hat dies den entscheidenden Vorteil, da? das entfernte Gewebe untersucht werden kann, ob da Zellver?nderungen vorhanden sind. Da auch junge Menschen heutzutage gar nicht so selten dank Sonnenb?dern und Solarium Hautkrebs bekommen k?nnen (ja, auch mit 20 Jahren! sic!), ist eine solche Gewebsuntersuchung unverzichtbar!    Beim rausschneiden wird lokal bet?ubt mit einer kleinen Spritze in die umliegende Haut. Dazu werden feine, dnne Nadeln benutzt und du merkst nur den Pieks (ev. sind auch zwei oder drei n?tig, je nach Gr??e des Muttermals), danach in der Regel nichts mehr.     P.S.: meiner Erfahrung nach machen Haut?rzte die "sch?nsten", sprich unauff?lligsten Narben. Darum, wenns geht, einen Hautarzt bevorzugen, nicht HauSarzt oder Chirurgen ;-)    bye|`|wXzhUgQjaa	Fast jeder von uns hat ein Muttermal oder einen Hautauswuchs, nicht alle k?nnen wir aber unter der Bekleidung oder mithilfe von Make up verdecken, abgesehen davon, dass einige solche Merkmale medizinisch gef?hrlich sein k?nnen.

Wenn die Spritze nachl??t kommt es natrlich zu leichten Wundschmerzen besonders wenn die Wunde gr??er ist. Dann la? dir vom Arzt Tabletten mitgeben. Bei mir ging es aber immer auch ohne Tabletten.

If you eat more it would make you gain weight everywhere and then extra fat on your boobs.    Second - I recommend you get professionally fitted at a lingerie store. It costs nothing and it's very important to have the EXACT size so that your boobs can be properly supported. This will allow them to grow too. although not increase it.    You are ONLY fifteen - I emphasize only because our bodies don't fully develop till we are around 22. People will tell you eighteen but,they are wrong - I know women who have had boob growth at 20!     Plus, you have only started your period - your boobs will continue to grow now that you have.    I am eighteen. When I was 14 I got my period - I had very small boobs and still do - this does not mean to say you will be like me. I compared my self to everyone around me - I hated my feature and became really self concious because of it. Then I realized that if i wanted to be really happy, I needed to stop comparing myself with everybody else - Enhance what you have got - maybe you don't have double d's like jenny* in your math* class but, you probably have another feature that you like better.     If - when you are 18 you are still not happy with your boobs you can take herbal supplements to aid growth.    Also, you will hear that the contraceptive pill makes your boobs bigger  - only because it makes your body think it is pregnat and gain a hell of a lot of weight. There is no quick fix.    Try to enjoy your teenage years as much as you can and focus on te things you do like about yourself.    I'm sure you are a lovely girl - boobs aren't everything - you are unique, even though you may hate it now - it is so important.    Good luck, until then, keep enhancing your good features and wear padded bras. They probably will grow!!|`|6qsocyK3aa	When I left school at nearly 16, I was an A/B. Within the year, I'd gone up to a D and now (aged 20) I'm an E. So you see there's still hope for you if you want bigger boobs. They change size throughout your entire life anyway. But even you don't, smaller boobs have a certain perkiness to them which is nice - a good proportion of men actually prefer them smaller so don't worry about not being seen as attractive (a good guy will love you for you though, not for the size of your knockers!).    Squeezing them or eating more meat won't make them grow, and nor will special growth creams or pills or anything like that, so don't be fooled if anyone gives you that rubbish. It's often a genetic thing. If you mum has big boobs, chances are you could too. The best thing to do is just wait and make the most of padded bras for now!|`|8RQCa3SXaa	you'll find that a 34A is the same boob size as a 32B,     try that and see how it feels.    the number at the start (32,34,36 etc) is just how many inches you back is.    the letter (A,B,C etc) is how big your boobs are in comparison to how wide your back is.    hence and 34A is the same as a 32B. Just with a smaller backstrap.    Hope this helps (:    so many people don't know this.|`|GZ88jyP4aa	What the hell are you doing squeezing them?|`|ILw3Rw3Jaa	mine grew like a whole cup when i was 17, so youve still got time to grow, but even if they dont be happy with what youve got, ALOT of really beautiful models have small breasts but id still bone ;)|`|gmrH0sNBaa	I was late too.

God made everyone different.  the appearance of your breasts sound perfectly normal.|`|SiSplXXsaa	Nothing actually makes boobs bigger (excluding surgery), but if you work the chest muscles through exercise, it can give the appearance that they're bigger.     You're still young, they might grow more, but even if they don't count yourself lucky! You'll never have back problems.|`|VpQ5ZmsMaa	Dont Squezze them it will cause them to sag. Ur only 15 u r still growing.  When I was first turn 15 I was an A and at the end of my 16th yr. I was a 34B. Now that im 24 im 38B. It also depends on ur weight. U gots to know that breast is made of fat. So when I was young like 16 I was 114lbs with 34B. At 18 I was 125lbs and my size was 36B until I turned 24. I gained 10 more pounds n now 38B;)    It also depends on Genes n the individual itself. Me n my mom got the same size of everything ;)|`|oy7mNHJNaa	I started my period at 12 years old and didn't get boobs at all til closer to 14.  I was 34A at 15, 34B by Senior year and after having kids Im now 36C.  You could definitely still be growing.    There really isn't anything you can do at this point to encourage growth.  Its all in your genetics.|`|apzX48W4aa	I am the same age, and I have the same problem. : (  It hurts alot.

Best of luck. : )|`|lkDouqK2aa	you have plenty of time left to grow if you have only just started your periods, i was exactly the same when i was younger. you may suddenly have a growth spurt or they could gradually grow over the next few years, there is no rush! i'm sure it feels like everyone Else's are bigger but trust me everyone willl be just as self cconscious about their bodies as you at your age.|`|YJXhc8noaa	Ok your boobs probably havent stopped growing and boobs are boobs they come in all shapes and sizes trust me, I have an okay sized boobs like there 34B but look like C's because of my height and body kind of thing I dont know its weird, but my mom told me that she didnt start growing breasts until high school and was very late and has D's so it all depends on gene's

You could try Retin-A if they are not too deep.  Otherwise, you will need to go to a plastic surgeon and have them laser'd off.|`|rHAiO9Ghaa	Nope honey, unfortunately it doesn't make them completely invisible. After having my gorgeous daughter I had a load of stretch marks. I tried spray tans, and also sunbeds. But it doesn't work, it just minimizes the appearance of the stretch marks and they look lighter. They aren't so obvious but it doesn't remove them permanently. However, stretch marks do fade over time just like all scars. You could also try using Vic's Vapor Rub many people say applying it to a washcloth or paper towel and rubbing it forcefully into the scared skin on a nightly basis for a few weeks. Cocoa butter, Rose hip oil, Emu oil, Jojoba oil also works wonders for stretch marks !    Hope this helps, Phoebe.
uX4FDZnvaa	Well i have very bad period pains. There are a few things you can try.    1. going on the pill ( i got advised this and done it, it did work and made my period lighter and less painful but i stopped taking it because i didn't like my period messed up at that point.    2. hot water bottle    3. Going for a walk ( helped me alot !! )    4. Deep breathes    5. tablets that are pacifically for period pains    6. Heat pads for periods    I hope this has helped period pains are so painful and   irritating.    EDIT:     well for school you can still have the proper period pain tablets and the heat pads do work it just depends on the person who uses them really. They would be diferent for everyone.    i would recommend going and getting some heat pads as its worth a try to help them pains.    also the walking you can do at school so thats good.    hope i have helped i have tryed anyway lol.|`|lnUrm4sGaa	yes through out the month take one capsule a day of evening primrose then your period pain wont be so bad i use to get it terrible but evening primrose really works|`|v2xUy1dXaa	go to the doctor...if you want to.

They are a strong painkiller that contain paracetamol and codeine to relieve period pain, cramps, headaches etc.  Also, using heat can be affective ie. a hot water bottle.|`|nUu7tUiqaa	Take Aleve. It contains Naproxen sodium which is a very strong pain killer. It will also help reduce the heaviness of your period.   A hot shower will also help, greatly. Try not to take a bath, as it is bad to be laying in hot water for too long.  As much as you probably don't want to, exercise helps a lot, as well. Try jogging in place for a few minutes.|`|107405bbcdb915439a0fd322a6701663aa	My doctor prescribes me a stronger pain medication when this happens to me like vicodin or darvon. but these can make you feel sick or kind of out of it, so you may not want to go that route. you can try exercising, reducing caffeine and salt from your diet and a heating pad. i never had a heating pad, so i filled a sock full of rice, tied the end and microwaved it. that worked well as my ghetto heating pad.|`|Avbh2QEeaa	ugh! i know what u mean! i would get them so bad that  i wouldn't be able to get out of bed. i would always take midol and it wouldnt really do anything for me.Then i tried midol extra strenght just to see if it would work a little better, and it actually worked a lot better. Have u tried that? i recommend u do|`|2XrkIlMCaa	Hi!     Have you tried Midol or Pamprin. I use Midol and it works really well for me. Just use it every 4-6 hours as directed on the box. Also, excercise it great for cramps. Get up and walk on a treadmill or something instead of just sitting. Also, bananas help, eat one. Birth control is a good one too. A lot pf people take it just to regulate heir flow and help with PMS symptoms. That is always a possability. Oh, and a heating pad could help. Hope this helped!!! = ]|`|xpRj7d0Jaa	hiya! i know how u feel i get real bad pains sumtimes n i cant move. different people will give u different advise... things will work on some people and not others.   i find eatin chocolate and other sweet stuff causes really bad pains, it makes them 10times worse..this might not affect some people.  stayin curled up n keepin warm normally makes u feel more comfortable. ive tried feminax,they seem 2 work well. the feminax ultra gave me a dizzy turn n i felt awful.   try different pain relief tablets n see what works 4 u.heat pads do work for a little while  keep urself warm :-) x|`|hkbWhfCiaa	I also have really bad period pains.

(yes I used to do this!) They are about $5 a box but well worth it...tip: you should wear "bigger" underwear, like boy shorts not thongs because the pad needs to stick to something.|`|Dkg7sqxIaa	I am exactly the same and i hate it, nothing i use ever completely gets rid of the pain but things that make it bearable for me are:  Panadol tablets  Hot water bottle  A hot bath  Massaging/rubbing the area it hurts most  Sitting with my knees up to my chin  A hot drink  Some chocolate    When the pain is lighter i try to:  do a little bit of excersie because this also help  also i find that if i am having fun, or watching a good film ( basically not thinking about it) can sometimes help.    When i have to go to school and i am in pain i sit with my hands on my stomach where it hurts because i find the light pressure helps to relive it slightly, also i take a good dose of tablets :) Never get off PE because the exercise will help. Also i find walking around sometimes helps so get signed out of class for the toilet and walk round for a bit.     Hope this helps xxx

nUu7tUiqaa	Less is more. Only take off what you need taken off to hide stretch marks or scars, or else your skin will be pulled too tightly and it will be very uncomfortable. Choose a good doctor, check their references and make sure to look at before and after photos of their clients. Be sure to have someone who can take care of you, as you will be out of commission for a good 4-8 weeks, depending on what all you get done. Do not take aspirin or any other blood thinner before you go in to surgery, also do not drink any alcohol, this can cause serious complications. Make sure that your doc marks the spots on you that will be removed with a thick, black line, to assure that everyone knows what is going on. Expect pain, it does hurt, you will not be able to bend, or twist your stomach in any way. It gets a lot better by day 5. Good luck.|`|nAvTMXmgaa	Good choice, I think if I got my skin too strech and there is nothing I could do to make it normal. I will do it.  You have to look for the best doctor.

Z0GfGZtJaa	Well the problem is ...You have a soar throat, stuffy nose, clogged ear lost voice, fever,and cough,|`|bxlYleZkaa	You have a bad cold?|`|MGGuYmAHaa	My best guess is a respiratory virus.  Take some mucinex DM and it will loosen things up.  Also take a long hot steamy shower it will help loosen things up.  It will probably just have to take it's course.  If this continues onto a couple more days or the fever gets higher you should see a Dr.  Also I suggest you take some Tylenol, and ibuprofen, you can alternate them the dosage every two hours.  One is filtered through the liver and the other through the kidneys, but if you are not sure call your pharmacy and they can discuss this with you.  You might also check into a cool mist vaporizer.  Sorry you have this junk it isn't fun.

yc2WWZZ4aa	I've had this too.  What helped me was xanax (knocks you out when all other sleep aids can't).  But that's addictive, so if normal sleeping does not return in about 3 weeks, you can also try trazodone, and anti-depressant taken at night that helps with sleep too.|`|eAarsjjMaa	Stress could be causing it, or some other medical problem, go see a doctor. They can also give you sleeping pills.|`|giCUEYsJaa	I suffer from insomnia and like you, it is always unpridictable.    Best thing I ever did for myself was purchase an 'Alpha Stim" device.     It is an electrical stimulator that you clip on to your ear lobes at night for 20 minutes.  It triggers the brain to produce seratonin.  I did a lot of research before I bought it, and what sold me on it, was it's being used at our Military Hospitals to treat our wounded soldiers for insomnia and post traumatic stress disorder.   Look it up online.  It's expensive, but worth every penny.      I now sleep better then I have in years!
BG8vMyZjaa	Impossible to say, the operative word is 'missed'.  I had one very heavy very painful period 2 weeks late when before and after this my periods were regular almost to the hour on day 28.  was it a missed abortion?

About 1% of pregnancies end in a missed miscarriage.     A missed miscarriage is not the same as a miscarriage. A missed miscarriage occurs when the baby dies but the woman's body continues as if it is still a viable pregnancy.     I had a missed miscarriage last month. We saw our peanut's heartbeat at 7 weeks and then 2 weeks later it had stopped and there was no growth. I completed the miscarriage naturally 2 weeks later. I had a feeling things were not right. I spotted a very small amount of brown after seeing the heartbeat. My doctor said it was common. I then lost all of my pregnancy symptoms. Each are common separately but spotting and loss of symptoms are a sign of a missed miscarriage. Most women experience no symptoms. I pray this is not the case for you.

EBmadtixaa	For 1200 calories a day, I'd go for:    65-70g fat (15g saturated)  100-120g protein  50g carbs    You need fat when on a diet.  If you're not taking in enough fat, your body will hold on to all your fat stores.  Personally I'd change your workout a bit as well.  Try interval training instead of hour long sessions a couple of times a week, and weights/bodyweight sessions a couple of times a week.    Hope this helps.|`|FTs2py0kaa	1200 calories a day..........this is short term a few months..........eat anything you want............just stay with the 1200 calories.....after you gt down to 140 or so, then start a fine tuning diet...................staying with the 1200 is hard enough  good luck..........

YSmYkc5Yaa	I hope you realize you're just over the target weight for your height... You probably don't even need to lose weight.    Anyways, you need to eat more. With that "diet" you're not getting enough food and not keeping your body properly well nourished. When you are constantly feeding your body, it keeps the metabolism running well so your body doesn't go into starvation mode. You should be eating at LEAST 2000 calories a day at your age.    Eat more for breakfast because that cereal is definitely not enough. Eat small snacks throughout the day whether it be vegetables, almonds, fruit, or a protein shake. Your lunch looks okay. A sandwich is a fairly balanced thing to eat along with fruit.    As for dinner make sure you eat a balanced dinner with protein, carbs and vegetables.    Keep exercising, that will help. But you need to eat more and drink tons of water throughout the day. And maybe try to change up your exercise a little bit because your body gets used to doing the same thing over and over and you're going to find that you might not be losing as much weight as you could be. Change it up and do something different every once in a while.|`|qlO6UZZyaa	If there is no eating between meals you will consume about 1000 ckal per day. If you are active you will probably utilize about 3500 ckal per day. That leaves a calorie deficit of about 2500 ckal every day or 17,500 per week. One pound equals about 3500 calories so you should lose about 5 pounds per week, or 20 pounds per month.
VdaQ2Vo0aa	I would say your body temperature is elevated but not a temperature.  Over 98.6 is a temperature.    I am like you and have a lower temp than most but still when I go to the doctor it must be over 98.6 for them to consider it a temperature.|`|AA11388527	96.3 isn't even a normal body temperature.  Find out why yours is abnormal.  A one degree elevation isn't a true fever.|`|6QkHAeXYaa	if your normal body temp is 96.3, and your temp is 97.3 then no,  you do not have a fever. If it gets around 98 or so, then you do have a fever.
FzPIt6V3aa	Loosing 20 pounds in one month is NOT healthy! On average, you should aim for 2-3 pounds a week. This is not only healthier, but more permanent. It takes 21 days to form a habit, so find an exercise routine that works for you and STICK TO IT! Don't even skip one day, because that will make it easier to quit! Your workout dosn't have to be 4+ hours to be effective. Break up your normal intake of food into 6 smaller meals throught the day. Do not eat after 7:00 PM. You don't have to count calories, just think and make smarter choices. A nutri-grain bar is healthier than a candy bar etc..  When exercising do your cardio first and then do your muscle building exercises. You'll use more energy this way. Just be smart and stick to it!

The weight will either be measured in pounds or in kilograms, depending on the measurement system used. A BMI calculator such as the one at the Partnership for Healthy Living does accept decimal numbers for extra precision (see Resources below).    Enter your height into the BMI calculator. A BMI calculator using metric measurements will need to use the height as measured in meters, while a BMI calculator keyed to United States measurements will need the height as measured in inches.    Hit the enter or calculate button located on the BMI calculator and observe the results. If you have followed the steps correctly, the resulting number should be somewhere between 18 and 40. A number below or above that range means that you are extremely underweight or extremely overweight, respectively.|`|niZBsn9Qaa	honey honey honey you are UNDER WEIGHT at 117 pounds...unless you calculated wrong, you should be 135 pounds...which is like 9.6 stone    your BMI is under 20 which isnt healthy...if anything with those figures you should gain weight.
aQ8o4w3Xaa	That all depends on you. Are you ready? Do you want to keep it? Can you give it up for adoption if you carry it to full term?   You need to really think about this and make a decision A.S.A.P. If you wait too long, it may be too late. How many weeks are you? You can have an abortion up to 24 weeks in the UK, although after 14 weeks it can be difficult and problems can occur. In the USA, it's 16 weeks I *think*. But you'd have to check your state laws. I think it's the same as the UK for Australia. You're best to go to planned parenthood to find out the exact dates.     Just think about whether you want this to happen. You're only 15! You have SO much ahead of you, you're hardly out of school. Still a kid yourself. What's inside you isn't a baby. It's just a zygote, a clump of cells. Nothing that could live outside your body. You can't think of "it" as a baby or you won't be able to live with yourself, I promise.     Don't you have a friend to confide in? That would really help you come to a decision.

Its not nice to think about what happens in an abortion but being realistic, keeping this baby will result in you completely ruining your life and the babies wont be too good either in a situation like this.  Good luck, i dont want you to ruin 2 lives in one xx|`|yTAqjJ7aaa	my friend was 15 when she fell pregnant, and she kept it she now has a baby girl of 1 year and said she is so glad but to be honest i think it was mostly coz of her religious beliefs so abortion was not an option.  However i cant really say a straight answer yes or no to you because it might be different if i was in that situation. U need to think in the future, are u ready to bring up a child for 18 years when ur stil a child yourself. My friend has managed amazing and shes a great mum, but if its not what you want then i don't know, you need to speak with people close with u.    EDIT: Also, my friend sat her GCSE'S..got good grades, now goes to College, just has someone to babysit her child ..the college days for her dont last long. She still does her studies while still having her beautiful baby to love.|`|Rk46lIBwaa	It is 100% her choice.

When will girls learn? I wish society didn't encourage everybody to be having casual sex. It depends what you want out of life. Do you want to carry on with your education and meet a man who respects you for more than just sex or have a career? I don't think adoption wouldn't be an easy option as you would know you have a child out there with who knows who bringing it up and it would keep wondering why you abandoned it. An early abortion would be best if you don't want a baby, so you should arrange it as soon as possible as a late abortion would be traumatic. If you want to keep it, in the UK you would get more state benefits than everybody else.    Don't listen to the idiots saying abortion is murdering a baby etc. They only pretend to care about fertilised eggs. They only say it to make themselves look good. They couldn't really care about living people. They don't care about any of the children born into bad situations and they don't care about life, as if they did they wouldn't get off making women feel bad.|`|tPOvhDOVaa	NO ABORTION that is murdering an innocent child that hasn't been given a chance in life and it will be your fault!!

I would suggest getting a large suport system and becoming educated on all options.  Abortion may be the logical decision, adoption may be, keeping the baby could be.  Either way its a hard choice for such a young person to have to make and without knowing them personally and knowing their situation, there is no cut and dry answer.|`|EYg62yNVaa	It's up to you. (I know that's not the answer you're looking for, but no one else can decide for you)  Think about this:  Will your parents support you if you were to have the baby?  Is the father still around?  Do you want to go to college & uni, or do you want to be a stay at home mum?  If most of these answers are no, then in my opinion you should abort. Talk to a close friend, i'm sure they'd come with you.  Good Luck in whatever you decide   xx|`|MbofFgD0aa	at 15, abortion.    the baby won't have a good life.|`|koAaPXKQaa	It is completely your choice. Do not let anyone else influence you as this is a really hard decision. Alot of people have very mixed views about it, so I really wouldn't ask that on here...    Seriously though, have a good think about it and think to yourself, could you be a mum at the age of 15? On the other hand, could you deal with the emotions experienced after a termination? You really have to just measure up the pro's and con's in your own mind. If you're in the UK you need to have 2 doctor's sign the decision to terminate a pregnancy, so you must be really sure about what you want to do. Because you are 15 you will get a bit of a lecture about contraception I'm afraid....     Maybe you should talk to your mum or dad about it? It may really help having someone's perspective on the whole thing that is close to you...    It is a really hard decision and you just need to take some time to think about what is best for you.    I wish you all the best.|`|6qsocyK3aa	This is a very personal situation and only you and you alone can work this one out.    Ignore any answerers that tell you what to do.

Or just go with what your heart says - I don't think anything can beat human instinct. Just make you sure thing long and hard so you don't do anything you may regret.    Good luck hun. x|`|nv011NQVaa	you should really do no abortion and try others sources like adoption or call like a pregnancy agency they will really help you out.... even though you are young you should not have an abortion god put a life in you for a reason dont kill it.|`|FTtusq01aa	abortion|`|Awo7g1K4aa	No abortion.

Do something sensible and give the baby to a proper home where they're perhaps not as fortunate to make baby's at the drop of a hat.|`|UHb5GFIIaa	Hi there, i hope you are ok, you must be going out of your mind with worry, you poor girl, i really think you have to discuss this with a professional, or your parents, don't be scared, yes they may be disappointed in you, its only natural and you should be willing to accept what they have to say to you, they will give you the support you require, many people are against abortions, and i am one of them, but i also believe it is a personal choice that only you can make, but remember whatever decision you make i will have an effect on the rest of your life, an abortion can cause infection and can make you infertile so in the future when you are properly ready to become a mum you may not have that choice. My best friend became pregnant at the age of 14 she is 26 now and she has another 2 children now, but she is a very good mummy, yes her mum was disappointed at the time, but she was supportive too. My friend despite having a baby while she was still at school she still managed to do something with her life. It might seem as if it is the end of the world for you now, but it not really it is the start of a new life for you and you have a little life inside you right now with a little heartbeat, please think about this before you act on  an abortion, something you may regret for the rest of your life, a little baby is something you wont regret, if anything it will make you proud..................take care my friend and i wish you all the best, remember it is your decision what ever you decide.............

KRm5thODaa	alignment is huge in feeling good, I believe as long as your chiropractor is reputable and not in it for the money but rather to help. you will do good by getting yourself aligned. I have been to good chiropractors and bad ones. also I would find out what is causing the degeneration in your discs  could be a nutrition problem.|`|46f08ffa5c76fa0a99f7bd318d1d05d2aa	You need to see a spine specialist, either neurosurgeon or an orthopedic surgeon. I don't trust chiropractors. I had my back manipulated once or twice, it always hurt worse after they were done with it. As a nurse, I've also cared for a few patients who required surgery after seeing a chiropractor because the chiropractor actually caused nerve damage.     In most cases, scoliosis is not painful. Be sure to see a spine surgeon to rule out other causes of back pain, which your doctor will want to look for as well.     Strengthening your core muscles can help with back pain. Anti-inflammatory drugs, physical therapy, massage, exercises, and yoga can help with pain relief. Cold packs can be used as well. Some have better results with cold for chronic pain. Some alternate between heat and cold.    Ask your spine doctor to check the status of your scoliosis. Following the appropriate medical work-up, ask for a PT evaluation, so you can be placed on an appropriate PT program.    Phase 1 focuses on education, posture, and flexibility to decrease pain. Phase 2 emphasizes strength and fitness activities to improve function by working on your core muscles. This will help with the pain.    Good luck!|`|b09a95122fd9bc36dd862d2d74cf004faa	Quack, quack.
ZKo2M8qOaa	Well I have tried a lot of different pills and only had GOOD results from a couple different pills. I have tried all the ephedrine pills before they were illegal but those types give you a "Speedy" type feeling. I have also tried a lot of the mainstream diet pills you see advertised everywhere and haven't had much luck losing more than five to ten pounds with those. There are two different pills I have had good luck with in losing a lot of weight instead of just a few pounds. One of them I have mentioned before in a different post and that is the "Acai Berry Select." (By the way; I will post some links at the end.) The Acai Berry comes from the Amazon and helps you lose a lot of weight PLUS give you the health effects of green tea. It is a very good one to try out.     The second one is called "Caralluma Burn." This one has the "Slimaluma" plant which has been used in India for thousands of years as an appetite suppressant and weight loss tool. That one worked good to in curbing my appetite. The first one can just be taken and the weight will shed. The second one is best to use along while doing daily and regular exercises. This will also help you lose A LOT of weight. So basically I would recommend either one or even both because for me at least, those worked the best out of all I tried.     Also, just so you know; the links I will post are through a health company I use and they have these both for free trials. So that's pretty cool because you can get both if you want and try them out to see which one works better for you. I can't complain when the stuff is free!! :) Well, good luck and I hope these work for you like they did for me. Let me know how it goes.|`|NPzDQmlQaa	I have been through it all and know what's it about.  The main thing is to stick in there.  You can't be an addict to food and never exercise if you want to live a healthy life and keep the weight off.  I've worked out, done every diet, and all types of classes.      Nothing works,  besides dedication and intelligence towards the subject of losing weight.      First,  depending on how much weight you need to lose,  your diet is the first concern.  You can't eat 10,000 calories a day and expect the weight to come off,  even if you are exercising a lot.  Which brings us to the next thing.  Duh,  Exercising...    This is a must especially if you need to a lot of weight.  Get at least 30 mins of some good hardcore exercising.  Do some cardio,  in the long run,  it's good for the heart.    However,  I find the most hardest part of losing weight/keeping it off,  in my diet.  It's so hard to keep your fingers out of the cookie jar or those chocolate goodies.  I've found a great addition to help any one out,  it's a natural weight loss supplement called Proactol.  Now don't get all crazy on me and say diet pills don't work.  That is true,  but not in this case.  This one isn't meant to burn pounds while you sit on the couch.  It's an appetite suppressant,  along with being a fat binder.  I saved money on the pills at theweightlossplace.com along with getting some good info.  It basically makes those fingers not go towards the cookie jar.  For me it's the best pill I've tried and I've tried cupboards full.  Now this doesn't mean you have to follow my foot steps but I've successfully lost roughly 70 pounds and keeping it off til this day.      Well good luck and remember what I said,  Dedicate.|`|RC88KUXPaa	Hey Stu,    I've tried just about every diet pill under the sun, and I can tell you that the only things I've ever had success with were natural supplements like acai berry. I tried a lot of the products like Hydroxycut, but they only made me dizzy and nauseous, not skinny! :) lol    I'd recommend you check out things like acai berry or colon cleanse products that help to boost energy levels and speed up metabolism naturally. Add them to a strictly healthy diet and a lot of exercise, and you should start to see results pretty quickly. Remember - there are no miracle pills, so if you want to lose weight, you can't just sit around on your butt all day eating pizza!    Anyways, let me know if you have any other questions. I'd be happy to talk to you about the plan that worked for me.    Sara|`|qmXVJNFyaa	a placebo....    or the one that has you living in fear of anal leakage! my friend has lost about 13 lbs in the past few weeks on that one... but he lives in fear every meal! lol
yY2Czxy2aa	As far as I can tell, there are no proven weight loss benefits from the acai berry, juice, or capsules.    It does seem to be a great supplement (I take it, but don't sell the stuff!) and is full of anti oxidents, which help prevent damage to your body. But that's what you should take it for, not weight loss or fat burning.     The acai berry itself is an amazing thing - has a lot of anti oxidents etc and is really good for you.    But there's nothing really to suggest in scientific terms that it helps with weight loss.     And there are a lot of scams out there, be careful where you buy it from!    I take it, and I think I feel healthier and better. But it's not some type of magic formula, sorry.|`|q0DBGlAoaa	I don't know much about acai berry but I think there is a scam going on with some of those products, I just asked a question and got a pretty general response that was advertising acai berry. The website looked funny though, and I looked at the user and they had sent almost the exact message to other yahoo answers but with a different website. You may have gotten caught up in this, most likely you won't hear anything more since these scammers can't get anything else out of you. Any situation where they tell you after the fact that they will charge you every month is fishy. Good thing you just used a gift card.|`|S730dpLfaa	WARNING! Livyx3, Read this blog before trying Acai Berry!  http://acaiberryscams.wordpress.com/2008...  Thanks to this blog, it helped me a lot to choose the best.

I was stuck at my weight loss goals and this brought me through it and made me lose a lot of weight.  So in my opinion it helped me lose weight tremendously.  I know a lot of that dieting stuff is expensive but I found a free trial of Acai Berry(I think it only cost me like 7-8 bucks at the time for shipping.)  The site was http://starturl.com/efblc -  All I did was try it out for a month and I was sold,  I saw the results I wanted to and like I said I was in that plateau with my weight loss.  This kicked it up a bunch.    Good luck and I hope this helps.|`|c4kOwX0eaa	You hear about it all the time so it must work for some people at least! This site reviews different brands of Acai  http://acaiberryreviews.webexpresslane.c...    .
Tx9LdrADaa	I am a certified personal fitness trainer and fitness instructor so I routinely set up fitness programs for clients.  Any good fitness program will incorporate elements of the 3 fitness components - weight/resistance (which uses resistance training to tone and build muscle), cardio/aerobics conditioning (which strengthens the heart muscle and makes you more efficient and increases endurance for aerobic activity, like running or playing rugby), and flexibility training (stretching to decrease the risk for potential injury).      Based on your specific fitness goals, ie building muscle and using gym to prepare you for the rugby field, you will want to focus on resistance (weight-lifting type of actvities) and cardio (any activity that increases and maintains heart rate in your target heart rate zone for the duration of the activity.)      In developing a resistance program it is good to know how much you should be lifting.  This will be individual to you, based on your fitness level, your body type, if your muscles are somewhat conditioned already etc.  Most modern gyms have either trainers available to help you find what weight you should be lifting, or have pre-programmed machines that will guide you towards the weight you need.  If not, you can figure it out yourself by trial and error.  You should find the weight you can lift 8-12 times or reps before reaching muscle fatigue.  That is probably about the weight you should be lifting at.  (Most people start with one set of 8 reps and then as they get stronger, increase to 2-3 sets of 8-12 reps.)  A few other things to remember about resistance training:  1.  You should not work the same muscle group on consecutive days.  In other words, if you do biceps curls on Monday, skip exercises involving biceps until Wednesday or later.  Repetitive resistance training actually causes tiny tears in the muscle, which can develop into big tears if not given enough time to repair themselves.  2.  Introduce a resistance program slowly.  To start with, shoot for 3 days/week of resistance training, and then based on results, increase days.  If you're lifting at your appropriate weight, you will be sore at first.  If you do too much to start out with, because of lactic acid buildup in the muscles, it may discourage you from continuing.  Challenge yourself, but go easy and be careful!  3.  Make sure you incorporate some stretching, as well as warmups and cooldowns.  This keeps your muscles flexible, improves range of motion, and seriously decreases your chances of getting hurt!      In developing a cardio program, you want your heart rate to go up (your Target Heart Rate Zone - calculated percentage by factors such as your age & weight) and stay there during your workout.  Both indoor and outdoor activities count as aerobic or cardio: running/jogging, vigorous walking, elliptical, treadmill, swimming, dancing, and yes, rugby!  If you use gym cardio equipment, they will most likely have programs built into them that can help you find and sustain your target HR.  There are also Target HR calculator sites where you plug in your data and it will tell you your *estimated* target heart rate for your age group, such as this one: http://exercise.about.com/cs/fitnesstool...    Unlike resistance, cardio/aerobic activities can and should be done on consecutive days.  If you're just starting out, try to go for at least 15-20 minutes 3xweek, increasing to 30 minutes, then 45, then an hour, 5x week.  You want to give yourself at least one day off every week for your muscles to recover, as it is possible to overtrain otherwise.  It is not a bad idea to get pointers or advice from a local personal trainer.  They can help you develop a tailored fitness program based on your needs and goals.    Hope this helps!|`|Unz3W0EEaa	yeah, there are lots of plans out there. check this out for some ideas.|`|gmvW9cvEaa	hey, check out this blog, it helped me so i hope it helps you!  http://musclegain4you.blogspot.com/

You can't let snow stop you from exercising. Alternatively, have you got a fitness dvd, or do some things like sit ups, press ups, punches, squats, etc. You could also just try dancing around. Hardcore dancing around burns off lots of calories. I'm sure you can find something on a website.
x15GsmEiaa	from deep penetration sex (when his penis reaches the wall of the womb)    Basically especially if your a smaller girl, your vagina canal is only so deep, i have read 6-7 inches, so anything past that is hitting stuff that will cause a little sharp pain. i usually notice it more of doggy style or when her legs are really spread far back. this is because their is maximum penetration so just have him not go as deep for a while and it should be fine. other positions may be more comfortable and he can go deep.    One thing you could do (as in an althernative position).. spread your legs (whatever the position), let him enter you and then put your legs together. This way you control how deep he goes and the walls of your vagina massage his penis. It is probably even better for him when your legs are close and he is inside you.    Goodluck!|`|Bgzq0K1Iaa	I'm pretty sure sex isn't supposed to hurt or make you feel sick...  Maybe he is just being too forceful.

Terry met a cute hot babe in Latin America in a bar. brought her back, married her. She was lazy as hell, thought life here was shopping and patying like on TV.  Not happy.  She cleaned out the bank and loaded up the credit cards and disappeared to her country twice. Even bought property down there in her uncle's name.  Dave picked up a hot skinny one down there. She came back with her (surprise) jackass son, spent the days at dancercise and TV and would even show up at church with see-thru micro 'clothes'. She left him.  Andy brought a hot one back for another Latin America country, well, she's now a fat diabetic that won't take a job and complains too much and their son is totally neglected.  I married a sweet bikini model from another Latino country - she lies about me to her family and friends, is way way overweight, sleeps in front of TV from 3 pm to 1:00 am daily, has been unemployed for 5 years, yet we keep paying for her family in various ways.    Point is - the body fascination wears off after  the honeymoon. But the cultural differences last for-ever, and when children come along, the worst things can happen.   Don't be a fool like us. Stick with your own kind.  The 'private' parts are all the same, smell taste shape etc. But the ideas of right and wrong can be totally different.
FzPIt6V3aa	It sounds like you're doing fine to me. You may get better results by doing all your cardio before you do your muscle building exercises. And make sure you never go below 1200 calories! If you do, your body will go into survival mode and store everything! Also, try to eat breakfast whenever possible. Eat like a king for breakfast, a peasant for lunch, and a pauper for dinner -- or so I've been told|`|ErvhPYlbaa	Hmmmmm...    It'll work, if that's what you're asking.  I also think it's going to be short-lived.  That's a pretty intense workout as an every-day routine.  I did that for a while and totally wore myself down.  I've cut back to 30 minutes of cardio every day.  It's much easier for me to keep up with it.    Also remember that your body is going to need more calories if you're wearing it ragged.    Good luck to you!

y6jPCsi2aa	The Anshar Diet    As an American I've seen enough crazy fad diets in my day to fill several weeks full of infomercials and advertisements. As such I'm going to give you the benefit of many years of health and nutrition classes and do my good deed for the year.    I'm going to tell you how to not only lose weight but change the composition of your body, increase your health, and best of all.. keep it off.    First, let's dispel some common myths.    Myth 1:  Eating less calories will make me lose weight.  Unfortunately this isn't always true. A lot of different factors program your metabolism but one of the key things is how OFTEN you eat. If you fast all day long and then have a 500 calorie meal at the end of the day almost ALL of it will be stored by your body.    Myth 2:  I can have a diet with no carbs and be healthy.  This really is a testament to how much Americans want a quick fix. Diets like the Atkin's Diet cause your body to start devouring itself, increase your cholesterol, and in certain cases can even kill you. One thing I WON'T argue, death will indeed cause you to lose weight, permanently.    Myth 3:  If I go on a diet I will lose weight.  99% of people who go on diets will end up putting on MORE weight than they lost from a diet. This is because diet is supposed to be a LIFESTYLE change, not something you do for 2 weeks. If you starve your body it will make fat cells and increase their size even faster.    Myth 4:  I need to go out and exercise to lose weight.  This isn't actually true but it's important to say that having daily activities WILL keep you healthy. If you burn almost no calories every day what else do you think your body is going to do with them? Balancing a healthy lifestyle with a good diet is what you want here, not killing yourself by running every afternoon.    Myth 5:  The scale in my bathroom gives me a good idea of how healthy I am.  The dreaded bathroom scale does NOT tell you how healthy you are. Let's say I have 10 lbs of fat, don't drink water, and have little muscle mass. Then I work out for 3 months and hydrate every day. I lose 5 lbs of fat but gain 7 lbs of muscle and 3 pounds of average water weight. What will happen when I look at the scale? Are you being fair to yourselves? Judge yourself by how you feel, not what a spinning number under your feet tells you.        With these common myths out of the way I'll tell you the secret. It's five simple steps.    ~~The Anshar Diet~~  1. Only eat until you are no longer hungry.  This does NOT mean that you starve yourself. It means after you take a few bites of food ask yourself if you're still hungry. If you're not, into the fridge it goes. While we're at it, CHEW YOUR FOOD. at least 10 times per bite (using common sense if you're eating applesauce, this isn't an excuse to be an idiot).    2. Eat at least 6 (more if your schedule allows) meals a day.  I know this seems counterintuitive, but hear me out. If you eat 6-8 meals a day the meals are very small (often around 100-200 calorie "snacks"), provided you are only eating until you are NOT HUNGRY. When your body is not hungry your metabolism will not try to store energy as fat. It really is that simple. Smaller meals aid in digestion, they increase the nutrition you get from your food, and they keep you from being lethargic. If you eat when you're hungry your body stores MORE of it as fat ("Hmm. I'm hungry, I don't know where my next meal will come from! I'd better hold onto this.")    3. Eat BEFORE you get hungry.  Schedule your 6-10 meals throughout the day and stick to them. If you're waiting until you get hungry to eat you've already screwed this up. Your body stores energy if you're hungry, if your body sees food and just takes what it needs then you're running at optimum efficiency. This is called programming your metabolism.    4. Eat breakfast. Always.  Your first meal of the day is also the meal you have no choice over being hungry for. Your body has been replenishing itself all night and needs fuel. Since now you KNOW that hunger means you store your food then that means you want to keep breakfast LIGHT. A cup of cereal and a banana. A granola bar and an apple. LIGHT does NOT mean you skip breakfast. If you skip breakfast you are telling your metabolism to turn ALL of the next meal you eat into stored fat.    5. Drink water.  (I'm a big hypocrite on this one, but I can't stress it enough) Most people think that if they pick up a glass of orange juice instead of a soda they're doing themselves a favor, and that's not entirely true. A glass of orange juice can have just as many calories as some sodas. Try looking at the label sometime. If you're thirsty, drink water. If you love your soda then have your soda (real soda, not diet, artificial sweetners have been argued to be one of the worst things to ever happen to western civilization). If you decide to have a drink to treat yourself, pour yourself a half glass, don't take a can or bottle with you and for go|`|zLsj2NGmaa	There is a great free resource over at http://www.fastweightlosetoday.com - they have a whole lot of free articles and information where i am sure you can find the answers you are after - check it out.|`|C2M2StR1aa	Your body burns a certain amount of calories each day whether you exercise or not. We each have what is called a Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR). This rate gradually decreases with age.  To the BMR you add the total calories used during the day due to all exercise and activity, which gives you your Active Metabolic Rate.     I am 6', 170 lbs and 52 years old. My basal metabolic rate is about 1700 calories burned per day. To that number I can add whatever calories I burn during the day due to activity and exercise. That will tell me approximately how many total calories I will burn up in a day.     Once you know this number you can eat however many calories you choose in order to lose, gain or maintain your weight.   You burn about 3500 more calories than you consume to lose a pound.     I have a page posted at my website that explains this further.  You can also input your own info to see your own numbers as far as calories used in a day.     www.diet-and-exercise-for-health.com/b...     Good health and good luck!|`|niZBsn9Qaa	yes it matters what you eat. You will lose more weight eating 1500 calories of fruits and vegetables and lean protein than 1500 calories of pizza.    for 7 pounds a week you have to lose 7000 excess calories (more than what you take in). You have to calculate your BMR, which is the amount of calories your body burns to just maintain normal body functions, which for most people is about 1500 to 2000 calories a day. So, 7000 calories / 7 days of the week is 1000 calories a day. Lets say that you burn 2000, to lose 2 pounds, your maximum is 1000 calories a day, which is a little dangerous....that's why its good to do some sort of exercise.    there's your answer.|`|N7YeTlGWaa	try and eat under 1000cal  try to restrict the amount of salt eaten in your foods as that will make you hold water,   and make you feel bloated  also try and do light exercises such as go up and down  your stairs a few times,  drink ice cold water, your body burns calories to make the water body temperture,    Good Luck...x|`|1qYHuPXqaa	You can easily lose 9lbs every 11 days its Guaranteed.....

95b3c1cab8a1f1f08d03b46eefc17755aa	You're not overdoing the exercise, but you might need to drink more water.    I suggest upping your calorie intake by 200 calories a day, what you have seems a little much.    4 pounds a week is rather a lot, I think.     If you're not feeling well, just have light things like soups and toast until you feel better, and don't go worrying about calories anyway. It could be a touch of the 'flu, so take a day of do just resting (no WII) and eating light food.|`|LElTSYaFaa	Not too sure.. you should go to your doctor to be sure.. well done for the weight loss so far tho :-)|`|PdItdJkKaa	yes|`|ZcAvP92jaa	your calorie intake is really low for a man. you should consume at least 1800 cals|`|K71ZlPWgaa	You need to slow down check with the good old doctor. It might just be flu but I think your overdoing it. You can check your symptoms online and see your best and worst case scenarios.
8ph53q0Qaa	start out with 70 pounds and see if u can get 10 reps if u can easily. then work your way up to your comfortable at the wieght u like but dont try larger wieghts until you have been working out or awhile, but dont try to show off to people by lifting your max u will strain yourself|`|D9D8Ezybaa	dude i have the same problem, idk how much i should lift and cant lift near anyone cause i feel super weak so i end up stopping my workout, its a real problem|`|MRk1w2dCaa	ez just start wit the pole its 45 pounds lol and if you think you can do more add 10 pounds everytime|`|QQbbReRAaa	Do you have a spotter?. If theres no one there to watch you and help if needed, then 0. If you have one, you should only be able to to 3 sets of 10-12 repetitions, and only get to say 9 or 10 on the last set, before your arms 'fail', and you can't lift any more. Thats when your spotter helps you lift the weight back onto the holders. We have no idea what that weight would be, just start off with a weight your comfortable with, and work your your way up/down from there|`|AA11988604	start out around 50 lbs and see how that feels.  gradually add weight.  If you are lifting to get stronger and bigger, lift weight heavy enough to have you reach the point of failure at around 8 or 10 reps.  Then rest and do another set of 6 to 8.   Obviously you need a spotter or be using a machine if you are going to lift to the point of failure.  Always have a spotter for bench pressing with free weights.    When I was your age, I weighed 155 and could bench 255 three times on a machine.  But that was after a number of years lifting 3 times a week.  It would have been less on free weights, maybe 225 or so, because your body is using energy to keep the weights aligned that you don't need to expend on a machine.    Again, that was after years of training.  So if you get to 100lbs fairly soon, I'd feel good about that.  But don't start there.  Start at a lower weight and work up to a bigger number slowly over time.|`|hI59Ywnyaa	Well if you're just starting out, you shouldn't lift too much. It shouldn't hurt you when you are lifting, but it should push you. Be careful and make sure you aren't working out the same muscles everyday, or else you won't get any bigger. In order to grow, your muscles need time to grow. Take a day in between working out the same muscle.    And don't feel bad if you can't lift as much as other guys, it's nothing to be embarrassed about. :]  I'm a girl, obviously, and to tell you the truth, it doesn't matter all that much if a guy can lift a lot compared to another guy. Just keep in shape, you don't have to be some huge beast.     :]
p6pESvHDaa	I'm a fitness professional....you would lose 2 lbs.  Because after 3 days of only eating 20 calories your body will shut down and stop burning fat for survival, instead it will burn muscle and cellular tissue from organs.  That will result in malnutrition and can lead to permanent health issues involving the kidneys, liver, and intestinal track.  This is all because the human body has a built in survival mechanism, people fail to realize it's only been 110 years since our ancestors had to hunt daily for food.  Our bodies still have this trait, it'll be another 500 years before our bodies adapt to the "grocery store, fast food, don't have to hunt" lifestyle.    If you want to lose weight, exercise and eating healthy is the only way.  No shortcuts exist.  If you are serious about losing weight, feel free to message me and I'll give you some work out tips and eating tips.  Don't try eating 20 calories a day, it'll destroy your insides.  People like me care about people like you, listen to us.|`|qyhbnZqjaa	oh boy..10 points|`|cb2NxPERaa	18 pounds.|`|r8H65RmLaa	Good luck with that! If you can stand just eating that many calories without giving into temptation you'll end up with an eating disorder! Don't do it, it's just plain stupid. Diet the healthy way: eating right and exercising regularly.
CqoTqEu6aa	you aren't over weight; if people are telling you not to lose weight then you shouldn't. sometimes it can be hard to look at ourselves objectively chances are what you see when you look in the mirror is a figment of your imagination. you might "feel" fat but you definitely do not look it.     I suggest you talk to a school counselor about your body image issues. The worst part of what you are going through right now has nothing to do with your weight but with your "feelings" a counselor can help you overcome your concerns, and free you from constant worries over your appearance and your weight.     If you are still worried a school counselor could also refer you to a nutritionist who can make sure your diet and exercise routine is a healthy one.     don't diet without speaking to a Professional first you could get really hurt or develop an eating disorder, take action now to make yourself feel happy and be healthy!|`|NUzvrOMaaa	This might sound stupid but the answer depends on your age and if you are male or female(not sure from the details) . How can you say you are fat or feel that way?. If you are over 16 you can probably start doing free weights but I must warn you, you must eat more calories and make sure you are eating quality foods high in protein to add muscle along with healthy carbs like whole grain. Eat plenty of fiber such as flax seed and green veggies.Healthy fats like almonds and olive oil. You have to eat more to put on the mass of muscle, yes you will gain muscle and fat. Do low reps 70% of your max lift 2-6 reps working 2 muscle groups daily. Like 3 days a week monday back and bi. Wednesday shoulders and legs. Saturday Chest and tri. You can work stomach each day. you should have a workout partner to spot you and if you don't know the exercises you should have an expert so you don't get hurt. I would recommend doing this for 1-2 months more calories and less reps and you can cut out cardio during this period. Most women want to work thighs and glutes. I recomend hack squats and squats and leg press. I actually think squats are the best exercise for overall body strength for the core for both men and women. The next month increase reps with lower weight three days a week with atleast an hour of cardio(5-6 days). This is where you lower protein intake and eat more veggies and complex carbs lowing calories.  I have found this to be the best way to gain mass and shape. You should get rid of the scale as muscle weighs more. Your teacher is correct 10-20% is ideal.|`|Ii5BojSlaa	Man you are skinny, people with 10% of their body fat are skinny enough!|`|8ae38a2ac6a77dd4a25ba0e15d91e256aa	you are sickly malnourished and should seek medical and psychological attention.
q0DBGlAoaa	I bet if you found some good baked vegetable recipes you'd like them better than raw. For example, mashed cauliflower tastes and has the feel of mashed potatoes, but it is much better for you! Just google recipes for it. Also, try making soups with lots of vegetables in it. You could try getting the freshest vegetables too, which brings out the naturally great flavors, such as a fresh tomato and just dip it in a little mayo, it is delicious. Adding cheese to stuff always helps :) Broccoli & Cheese is great. Putting veggies on pizza is good too.|`|nCbtZAIoaa	I don't no if this helps,  but it helped with me as a young.    Try combining it with different foods.  Worked for me.|`|oojO4WAraa	Disguise them.  Puree onions, celery, green pepper, etc. and add to meatloaf, tacos, meat balls, sloppy joes.  Eat zuchini bread.      Eat lettuce and tomatos on your sandwichs.    Don't discount fruit.  If you truly hate veggies, eat fruit instead.  Fruit contains fiber and vitamins just like veggies.  You can have strawberries on your morning cereal, or make a smoothie with fruit and soy milk.
Ii5BojSlaa	Do 50 reps of different ab exercises - which can be found super easy on the internet every evening before you go to bed. Then increase the amount of reps you do.. and maybe try different exercises too... have day breaks in between sometimes to let your muscles rest and grow!  Make sure you do lots of weight loss - even though you dont have to - but they only way to see muscles is if you lose body fat.  Good luck!|`|27bc701367843ae2833d9bcda8c0f992aa	Sure you can go to the Packie and pick up one..|`|V8GrFx0jaa	I usually just go to the beer store. It's pretty much instantaneous.
UpPWXRK4aa	Every single day?    I drink about 3 cups a day and noticed that:  -headaches if I don't have caffeine one day  -I get irritable and impatient  -Even if I'm super tired at night I will only sleep 5 or 6 hours then wake up    While caffeines not addicting like crack or those other things are (haha) it still has a level of addiction and your tolerance will go up, so if you all of a sudden want to stop drinking 3 cups a day you have to go to 2 then 1 cup each day.|`|N9nJWYa5aa	2 - 3 cups of coffee per day is good-ok, much more and it starts to become problematic.|`|IFs6MWDJaa	Plan Black Coffee ? not bad at all  It's only bad if you load it up with Cream and Sugar    in just plan coffee there are 0 Calories|`|0MUwB3Czaa	It depends on what you put in it.  And if you have too much caffeine you can become dependent and have withdrawals such as headaches, stomach issues, and a overall feeling of not being well.        http://yourmetamorphosis.blogspot.com/|`|b77c2aa72e0d0d360129311f88b3a5c0aa	No, in fact it's very good for you and keeps your kidneys flushed out as coffee acts as a diuretic.|`|BRT2teSqaa	I wouldnt go above 3, and I would definitely try to keep it at 2.  Too much caffeine can cause irregular heartbeats, life long dependency, and has a strong link in developing osteoporosis..  Try to mix half caffeinated with half decaf.      Besides the caffeine, it's great as long as you dont pile it with sugar.  It even has antioxidants, and a few studies suggest it helps prevent Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease!|`|PdItdJkKaa	yes
ky3msQeyaa	That is your clitoris.|`|AA10024068	I'm no Dr. by any means, but I have had that problem before when I had my period, & I believe it's irritation from all the moisture when you have your period....Best advice I can offer is --- Change your pad more frequenty if your flow is heavy, put vagisal on it, & see if that helps...Also try eating some yogurt..be patient, & the less you touch it, the better....if it doesn't clear up, go see the Dr....    Good luck!|`|31dec6023a584d5995a2753c27f8b6b3aa	If your sexually active, I would get it checked out by a doctor. Also, it could just be a zit type lump. I get those and my doc says their nothing. It is probably nothing. Hope this helped!!!
dd2fcce45bca9663bd888e1e275174f6aa	No way.  But balance it out with strength training if you're concerned about staying bulked up.|`|PfBMvX1caa	Yes, it can, because your body will eventually cannibalize muscle for energy.|`|AA11627044	NO|`|SaKf9NU9aa	It depends on what kind of muscle you are referring to.  Cardio will build lean muscle, but not the bulky type.  If you are looking to get ripped, you will need to hit the weights in addition to Cardio.|`|Plqh5tRWaa	Yes, it's possible that it will do that.      Your body metabolizes fat sources, then carbohydrates, then at the very last, protein.

zvAfMgf3aa	NORMAL|`|iRlm3mOuaa	Masturbating may enhance farting, however it's not the cause of it. Flatulence is caused by what you eat and drink; fruits and vegetables, fizzy water and beverages, etc, all cause you to fart. Being lactose intolerant and consuming cow's milk  products anyway causes you to fart too.|`|AA11478827	Actually yes..gas may be being produced while you masturbate because your doing physical exertion while sitting or lying down in a relaxed position. But it's not the masturbating that's "producing" the gas. It's what your eating in the hours before time. Eat foods that produce little if no gas. Or since your only 14 most likely you either can't or won't change your eating habits, then you need to take an anti-gas medication. Which you can easily buy over the counter. Take an anti-gas pill about 2 hours before you masturbate and you won't produce any gas.   |`|iPe9i9tnaa	thats maybe because you r suffering from dehydration. drink lots of water and eat soybean products if u r masturbating excessively. try keeping a time or a mit maybe, something like that.   good luck.  |`|XiBsccF9aa	farting is great, never stop doing it|`|7f065a5f8c99309ffaeba42afcaa6331aa	bloat and gas caused BY the fun thing ? i wouldnt think so.. lay off the corn chips... bloating ?? i never heard of that from that.. gas well it gets pushed when the... gets pushed...but to answer id say no|`|COtoLFxEaa	dude, i pray to allah that any of your future girlfriends never find this.

You either put the soap on the cloth and scrub that baby or put a lot of soap on your hands and scrub that baby. Contrary to what a lot of men understand, washing your backside is very important and soap does absolutely no harm whatsoever and is good so no parasites form. Wash your bum ring and you can even get inside a little to clean off any lingering unwanted bacteria. Don't stick your fingers way up there just do the outside and a little inside and then rinse. The bum ring is very durable it is a coated muscle on the outside. Like I said just don't go way up there, but even if you did just wash it out. That's your anal tract believe me soap won't hurt it.

Go to the store and get some dry scalp shampoo and see how that goes. Also, are you eating enough? Not a lot of calcium or protein can make your hair fall out as well.|`|FbXJPGbeaa	Think its probably time to pop of to the doctors, we could give you loads of wrong advice here.

That was the last time I ran away. I'm now 26 and realize how retarded I was for running away cuz I couldn't go to a party....

b698c36eb69ca7c1ee56cc564c80134aaa	If you are going for your first pap smear, it is uncomfortable but not painful. They will take your blood pressure and weigh you. Then they will ask you lots of questions about your health and when your last period was. Then they have you put on a paper gown and get ready for the doctor. When the doctor comes in he may ask some questions about your health. He will discreetly check your breasts for lumps. There will always be a nurse or lady in the room with you and if there isn't and you want one, ask. Then they will put your feet in stirrups with your legs open and he will put two fingers into your vagina and push on your ovaries to check them. Then they will insert a speculum into your vagina and take a long q-tip and take a sample from your cervix. It doesn't hurt but is a little uncomfortable. Sometimes they will put a gloved finger into your anus to check to see that everything is okay there. Then it is over.    During the procedure, the doctor will probably talk to you about your life or family and try to keep your mind off what he is doing. If you try hard to relax and take deep breaths, it is less uncomfortable.     Don't be embarrassed, it is nothing compared to giving birth and being in labor, when it seems everyone is checking your vagina.    hope this helps..|`|piDDZ6Ywaa	It's over within about 1 minute! You've nothing to worry about at all. Smear tests save your life, it really does. So relax, and just think, this is only a quick life saving procedure and it's better to be petrified rather then not have it at all ;o) xxx|`|q1LwC1Ayaa	really its over and done with i 1 min. try to relax, easier said than done i know.  you will be asked to lay on the couch (with undies off obviously),  and put your feet together and relax your knees to the side. just look at the ceiling. a small spectrum is inserted (sometimes cold but not wholey uncomfortable). it should not be painful, although a little spot bleeding afterwards might happen. it really is very quick.  it can help to wear a loose skirt, as its sometimes less embarrasing to hitch it up and remove undies, than sorting out your jeans and all hat fumbling.  good decision to have it done , well done|`|zCWcoFhZaa	HI I know how you are feeling I havent had a smear yet but I have had a baby 5 months ago and I think I would be nervous as well, because when you are in labour and your diginity goes out of the window you dont really care as the pain takes your mind of it and you just want to have your baby in your arms, plus you dont have any choice weather or not to give birth as you body just goes through it naturally etc so you have no control, but you do when having a smear.    All you have to do is think of it as you need to have it done and its for the best and dont worry as nurses do it everyday etc and its over in a few mins and thats it. Way less painful than labour and quicker a no one is staring at your down below bits for more that a min lol|`|JU351q6Naa	there is honestly nothing to worry about. it just feels a little uncomfortable but you won't feel any pain. please don't worry over this just relax and do not tense up. good luck. remember smear tests can save your life it is worth it
b698c36eb69ca7c1ee56cc564c80134aaa	It is kind of a predicament when a guy has a sexual response to a relative, but if  you are a teenager, then contact with a female body belonging to anyone might cause an erection.  It may be inappropriate to have this happen, but the touch, smell, etc., of a female body does cause a response.  As you age, you will learn to control these feeling, but its probably not rare to have this happen.  Just try to hide it so that people don't think you are strange.    best wishes..|`|USsDzaIsaa	Why are you even slow dancing with your sister?|`|VerfhAQcaa	ew thats just wrong!|`|Y32OhOVoaa	Dude!!

ufgv7oTjaa	Well, I don't think you'll find an herbal company that sells a lot of products for infants because most herbs haven't been researched for safety in infants and commonly aren't recommended for anyone under 18 years old.   For a child as young as 6 months, I would only give them an herbal product if the label specifically listed a dosage for that age or if a doctor said the proper dose for an herb (although it's hard to find a pediatrician that knows about supplements, unfortunately).    There are several good companies that sell herbal products that have good quality, but they would have those same recommendations. http://www.swansonvitamins.com http://www.puritanspride.com and http://www.vitacost.com are a few of the better ones. Good luck and I hope I helped!|`|b3f4f6798be929d658ec38c5b998d657aa	Listed below is a sampling of a few distributors of herbal products, however there is very little in the way of medical tests on adults using these products and virtually no research for children. I would not advise giving anything outside of vitamins to children.    Herbalife  http://www.herbaldiscounter.com/?crcat=p...    Wholesale Herbal Products  http://www.eyefive.com/    Herbalcom  http://www.herbalcom.com/store.php3?list...    REMEMBER:  If you are going to have surgery, be sure to tell your doctor if you use herbal products. Herbal products can cause problems with surgery, including bleeding and problems with anesthesia. Stop using herbal products at least 2 weeks before surgery, or sooner if your doctor recommends it. (familydoctor.org)

d7a1c44095d30967ff1dea1e9716039baa	It's hard to say. But it's possible it is just a tightened muscle. If it is, then this stretch works wonders (I have that pain you described all the time & it got so bad that I was worried that something was terribly wrong, but it turns out that is all that it was): Lay flat on your back & bring your knees to your chest. Hold for 60 seconds. Put one leg back down, holding just one knee to your chest. Hold for 60 seconds. Switch legs. Hold for 60 seconds. Next, still laying flat on your back, put your legs straight out in front of you. Bring your left leg over to cross your right leg, keeping it as straight as you can, pulling it up with your hand as far as you can (even though your body will rotate slightly, try to lay as flat on your back as you can when you do this). (I know this doesn't sound like it has anything to do with your back & hip, but this stretch actually pulls up your thigh, to your glutes & hip area, & your lower back) Hold for 60 seconds. Then switch legs. Hold for 60 seconds. You may need to hold for longer. You should feel some relief right away, but sometimes if a muscle is really 'knotted', it  will tighten back up within 8-10 hours of being stretched. So you may need to try this once or twice a day for several days, before you get long-term relief.    If it is a muscle, this stretch will work. Hope it helps!|`|9ZeiFzwJaa	if u r having this pain for a prolonged time then u need to go for a check up to ur DOCTOR|`|j1jysy6baa	No its nothing to do with gastric.

7be554591e8c040c7b5bfa762a5a2560aa	Logically, it hurts just as much as being hit anywhere hurts.  Not as bad as being hit in the testicles....that is a whole other story.  But the genitalia  of a female on the outside is just flesh....but inside it is different...and can be tender.  But you can't hit it...it is well hidden (the part that is tender).|`|hNa5oHxQaa	It may not hurt as being hit in the berries, but it still hurts a lot.  There are lots of nerve endings there and the clit is surrounded by many nerve endings and that's why it hurts them almost as much as men.|`|BNAzjSO1aa	As the female part is made up of the same sort of things that the male parts are then yes they do hurt a great deal if they get hit. Saying that pain is not the only drawback of a guy getting hit in the crotch so I would say yours might be worse but not by much. Both areas contain a large number of nerve cells|`|dd1c8373d258bab9181f891f88ea8dafaa	It does hurt very badly. Very very badly. But the male genitalia has more nerve endings in that area than a woman's.|`|it3B2Y45aa	YES VERY MUCH SO...I was snowboarding a few years back and my foot came out of the strap(cheap snowboard) and the way i landed the snowboard went right between my legs and hit me in the female part...i couldn't get up out of the snow for almost 1/2-1 hr. and then when 3ever i had the guts to get up i was so sore i couldn't even walk straight for about a week i was so badly bruised and sore it was crazy....so yes it Absolutely hurts.|`|AA11903455	Yes it hurts terribly and can leave you feeling sore for days or weeks depending on how badly hit.

Please dont ever contemplate doing that to someone, and dont get hit there too.|`|SJisSKUqaa	Hell yeah
HEQc83d9aa	Yes it is sad, you see how they are loved and encouraged in every aspect of their children's lives.  when the parents are, lets say indifferent to their children it has a massive impact on them not only as a child but when they grow into adults. It knocks their confidence,attitude and most of all, the feeling of self importance.  Having parents that really love and support their children is the best start to life; another human being can give.    What a fantastic question.|`|M4nXH7DTaa	it hurts to see all my friends have great partents that actually care and $hit but what i realized is now i know what to do to be a great parent.

But over the decades, I've learned it wasn't so bad.    My parents didn't drink, my parents paid for our education, they never split up or had huge fights, my parents and siblings, aside from the occasional rift, all get along and support each other.    I have envied my sister - she loves her two kids, they're smart, they do lots of stuff together, as a family.    Two days ago I find out that one of the kids is estranged from her mom.      I had no idea.  They had seemed so perfect - and we live in the same town.|`|39x9tNJzaa	No, I'm not envious of anybody else's parents at all.  Mine weren't "the best", I was almost removed by CPS when I was very young, and my little brother and I spent our after school hours at home alone.  My parents were alcoholics and fought all the time.    But they were still MY parents.|`|gC8xO53Oaa	I did feel very sad that I had a bad childhood, but because of this I made sure my children didn't experience what I did. Some go as they were taught and others make sure they don't make the same mistakes. Just remember, being a parent doesn't come with instructions and most times the parents lead how they were led. My parents are both gone now and instead of hating or feeling sorry for the way I was raised, I turned it around to ensure my 3 were given and treated with love and understanding.|`|ra69rxxgaa	I had a shitty childhood, lived in poverty, abusive father... but I don't envy other family's. All i can do is use my negative experiences to give my children the best childhood possible.|`|8lzBktaeaa	I felt the same way when I was younger. My parents didnt really raise me, I basically had to raise myself. But what I did realize is how spoiled other children are, compared to my life, I struggled a lot, overcame a lot of difficult obstacles in life  ON MY OWN, and this has made me a better/stronger person in general. Im kinda glad my parents didnt spoil me like other kids do, but I do wish that they could have loved me more. More affeconate I guess. I hope to be a better parent then what mines were. Good Luck|`|cDjWONryaa	Family is a very important source of support and is definately a plus in life.  But we also must not let the fact that our parents were not the best effect how we will turn out in life.  You can make your own family with friends and loved ones and always remember not to blame anyone for anything in life.    I didn't have the best family in the world growing up very disfunctional and I finally married a wondeful man with a great loving HUGE and caring family.  My children have wondeful grandparents and aunts and uncles and we do tons of activites together so it definately made up for my short comings with family as a child.    Just remember you always have choices and you truly do make your own happiness.|`|1d4f066127a4debbe9480a24c479ac16aa	I am diagnosed with having a very severe child abuse.I was beaten and neglected to the point of having greasy hair and boils all over my body and being placed in bathtubs of ice water to reduce the swelling from the beatings.I was raped and molested by more than eight people in my family and was forced to have sex with the family dog.    I do not regret my past because my children son now 20 and daughter 19 claim they couldn't have asked for a better child hood which makes me one of the rarest people on earth in a sense I changed my stars which only 1% of people really do.I am who I am because I was able to over come my circumstances and did not cir-com to them.|`|556f6a84a1e72fa5f9fa440c37251fe4aa	Yeah.  It does make me just a bit sad, maybe jealous...    And honestly, with the way some younger parents act, it also makes me wonder how good families are possible in this day and age.  So many kids grow up *messed up* these days: ranting with foul language, shooting up schools, cutting themselves...WTF?    Really.  I'm not going to be stupid and suggest that being a parent is easy, ok?  But even *I* get it that to be someones dad, I have to actually *be there* and show up.  That's just the least you can do: be there and know what your child is doing and up to.  Anyone not in a coma should be able to understand this.    But I digress.  Point is, when it works out, I'm sad, but more and more I'm just amazed that parenting, as task, and having a family, as an endeavor, actually still works for people.  In spite of it all, sometimes it still works.    And yeah....wanting better for yourself happens.  It's human nature.  It's especially human nature to want better when better is what *really ought to have happened* in the first place.    I hear you.  It's a sad thing, but it also gives me hope.  Maybe the human race isn't going to go extinct or go to crap right away.  Maybe we aren't all destined to be Soylent Green after all.  ^_^    Maybe.  ^_^  Hell, it sounds weak but some days it sure beats "no, never".|`|cwzH7DVvaa	Oh, dear. I know exactly what you mean. My family is extremely dysfunctional. Abusive dad, conflict at home, poverty, etc. It hurts so much when I see simple things like my friend's dad giving her a hug, a girl and mother going out for some bonding time, people going out on a family outing. It hurts so much that everybody can't have those special Disney moments.    But then, just think, people from dysfunctional families will be stronger than those with perfect, twinkly childhoods. They'll be stronger to face problems and difficulties in life, instead of running away at the first hardship because they've never had to face anything that wasn't right out of a musical before.    (: Sorry for the rambling, it's a weakness.    xxx|`|PCsW0gbPaa	Yes, of course I do.  But you have to turn that thinking into something positive.  For example, it makes me really sad and angry that my dad doesn't see how important a supportive and loving family is, but I learned that it's important because it was missing for me... so I can use that knowledge to be a better parent to my kids.   If you get too hung up on thinking about what you didn't get and being envious of others, then it can turn into a problem where you actually take steps to make sure that other people, including your own children, don't get the kind of nurturing that they need.

cCZyXV6caa	Do you, by any chance... mean IgA nephropathy?      Ah... I figured as much, but I thought you might know something that I didn't.    I don't really understand the doctor telling you that this is a "terminal" condition. Essentially, a terminal condition implies that the disease will invariably cause your demise and there is no chance of treatment. Neither of these diseases is terminal, per se... however, they are chronic (is this the term they used?). There are treatment options available for each one, but no outright cure.     As for these diseases killing someone... it's not likely, but... there are complications that can arise from each disease, and your brother needs to stay on top of these. For instance, Crohn's disease (though having a low mortality in itself) puts one at an increased risk of cancers of the colorectal region and the small bowel. IgA Nephropathy, though originally thought to be fairly benign in nature, has been shown to greatly increase risk of end stage renal failure (although this condition is treatable through dialysis or kidney transplantation...) which is always fatal without treatment.|`|I83sYbARaa	I typically research any illness, on the web ... getting various perspectives and info...  Doctors dont normally say something is terminal unless they have run the gamut of western medicine  techniques.....     So from there, I would start looking at alternative healing techniques, which there are a lot of, but I dont know enough about iga neuropathy, I KNOW that asian medicine treats and heals crohn's disease....  so you could look up articles by dr. subhuti dharmananda along with whatever illness you want to read about... these articles are for practioners , but will show you what you can expect...  I would find out more information from western doctors also, and search support groups, info on the subject....and get other opinions...  to help you deal with the emotions you are going thru, and a technique you could even apply to your brother,   go to www.emofree.com and look at the free how to manual on how to apply the easy to learn and apply technique...  there are numerous stories there of great healing both emotional and physical thru the use of this technique.....  read, learn, apply...  Good luck,  remember, how long anyone lives is not up to you, it is up to 'God'.....   but we can all do things that help that along....   Take care, and I wish you, your brother, and family well....

ximWtKVuaa	I don't know about the NuvaRing but I suffered from terrible menstruation cramps for a long time until I went on the pill (I know swallowing pills is hard but these are just little and if you put them in with a bite of yogurt or applesauce it's not that bad) AND ALSO discovered that consuming caffeine helps a ton since it's a vasodilator .  If you haven't got a good tolerance for caffeine try buying a loose Rooibos tea ... it also helps and gives you a lift that is not caffeinated.
E64juLwJaa	Men can grow till their early twenties but there is nothing you can do to maximize it.  Planets|`|7ygicWvzaa	You have no control over how tall you will be.

Then again, I've seen guys have one last growth spurt between 17-19.  All you can do is wait and see.      Thing about it like this.............it's better than being 5' 2.
FicyC2TXaa	You asked this yesterday and got several answers; you weren't so specific then though, you just asked about cancer in general rather than ovarian cancer.    The answers remain the same: as a female you have a one in three chance of developing cancer in your lifetime. You are very young; the majority of people diagnosed with cancer are over 60.    None of the things you mention are relevant; there's no evidence that diet and exercise will affect your chances of cancer, and most cancers aren't hereditary - fewer than10% of all cases.    This is true of ovarian cancer; only around 10% of cases are hereditary. And most cases of ovarian cancer are in women who have had the menopause.    You have no symptoms and no reason to suppose you have cancer. Stop worrying about it and enjoy your life|`|4jOaN0WIaa	I don't understand why you would worry about ovarian cancer so young especially if it doesn't run in your family.|`|UZxeBrxQaa	Why not worry about something more likely to happen, like getting run over crossing the street, being hit by a drunk driver, or contracting influenza.    You are wasting perfectly good worry hours on this nonsense.    Focus on living your young life, not dying.|`|QvrhmdAtaa	Stay off of the birth control and hormone replacement therapy all of your life. These are largely to blame,also never having children.Breast feeding when you do have children is a deterrent against breast cancer. Going against nature,ie.stopping the natural course of your bodies functions it was created to do, is the biggest reason for 9/10ths.of the cancers in women. Never smoke and start to pray if you don't already.Get with God and ask Him to show you His will in all of your doings in life and it sounds like you are already healthy otherwise. There is not enough known about various cancers yet to be 100% in all you may do in avoiding it with all assurance but sounds like you're already going in the right direction. Sounds like you have strong family genetics on your side too.

79001534b8f79771dce5eae9d3d448a7aa	Absolutely normal. You are not loosing your mind.

Meanwhile you think, you see nothing around you, so concentrated you are.    Normal.|`|39x9tNJzaa	No.  Sounds like social anxiety or something along those lines to me.  Some depression maybe too.  Talk to a therapist and see what they can do to help you.|`|Fq3vo0kOaa	It doesnt sound like you are bi-polar, it sounds like you need someone to talk to.  We all have strange childhoods, i moved multiple times in my childhood & felt maladjusted as well, but through highschool i did have a large group of friends, during my highschool years, i lost 5 of my best friends 2 in a car accident the other in a motorcycle accident, then we had 1 overdose the year we graduated... 1 commited suicide  You need to step back, take a look at life, focus on the positive things in your life, do you have a g/f? or b/f? do you work? do you have goals & aspiration? Your not coming unhindged, you are scrambling for answers to questions that you may never find. YOu need to look at your future & make plans........ plans to do things that make you happy, find another band? Or something else you enjoy? try something new??   YOu have alot of things that you need to get off your chest... that would be my 1st suggestion, if you don't have anyone to talk to , find a counselor, if you don't want a counselor, find a family member or a close friend that will just listen..  you arent crazy or loosing your mind, you are struggling with the loss of something that was comfortable to you..   You can email me if you want to just vent... I know where you are & have been there, I am a nurse now.. 20 yrs after highschool & have 2 great kids.......... a wonderful life,, getting over this is possible.... you just have to be willing to talk about whats bothering you!!!|`|HigxGZbYaa	It's understandable that you might have some problems adjusting when you've had to give up an activity and a social group that you enjoyed.    I suggest reading this book--  The Feeling Good Handbook, by David Burns  http://www.amazon.com/Feeling-Good-Handb...    If you can't find it at a library, it's worth the investment for a used copy.    And if that doesn't help, don't be afraid to seek therapy. It can help a lot. If money is an issue, there are probably clinics that offer discounted prices if your income isn't very high.    The therapist may recommend that you also see a psychiatrist, who can prescribe medication to help. Be patient with this-- Different medications work for different people, and it may take several months of trial and error before you and your psychiatrist find the right one for you.    Good luck!
PzSgRA1qaa	You could try Rose Elliot's "The Low Carb Vegetarian Diet"    http://www.amazon.com/Vegetarian-Low-car...    It's full of recipes and helpful information. I've been vegetarian for 17 years and just thought I'd give low carb a try after all my holiday indulgences. I've had the book for a couple of months, but just jumped into the official diet plan 5 days ago. Elliot outlines a 14 day 'carb cleanse' which allows 20 grams or less of carbohydrates per day. I'm actually considering aborting the plan. Apparently these are common side effects of low carb diets, but I have had headaches, dizziness (to the point of not going to work out), and my hands were shaking this morning before breakfast. I don't think cutting to this low level of carbs is really healthy (for me anyway.) Sure, I've shed a few pounds really fast, but it's probably water. I'd rather get back to working out and feeling normal!!! I will continue to use some of the recipes (which are very tasty) and include more high protein foods, but I think it's time to up the carb level from 20. Good luck!!!|`|OySU2oAkaa	Protein Protein Protein is key not the carbs : http://i-dietandfitness.com/2009/01/19/t...    And in terms of carbs fruits have a lot. They are rich in fiber and will energize you most definitely!    Fiber yogurt is great for that too!|`|oIdwxlutaa	Lots and lots of fruit and vegetables.  Why are you trying to do a low-carb diet?  Trying to lose weight?  Have you tried exercise?|`|nbChnDIBaa	"Carbs are our friends"    Just remember to cut out anything that emulsifies in water, ie. breads, pastas, and anything that has been processed into a pulverized form, beans, wheat (flour), corn (flour), hummus, etc.    Good luck, and remember that you can hurt yourself by starving your body and brain cells of sugars that come from carbohydrates.|`|uxKnZtRKaa	Low carb, vegetarian.. It's rough, but possible.    Different types of nuts are great.  High protein, and healthy fats.  Low carbs.    Protein shakes and bars would be an ideal food for this choice of diet, but you have to make sure you get the right ones..    Off the top of my head, anything  by Dr. Atkins is good.  Some Atkin's products include bars, shake mixes, drinks in cans, bake mixes, and a bunch of other stuff.  I think Vitamin shoppe has the best selection of his items.    Also, Metr-X would be good for your diet, and a bunch of other shakes mixes, and baked goods.      Go into a Vitamin Shoppe, or GNC, and just tell them you want low carb products.  As they do not sell meat in either establishment, anything they tell ya about would be good.    Also, remember, it s hard to avoid all carbs on your diet, so just make sure that the ones you do take in are complex carbs.    And if your a vegetarian who eats fish, that s good too,,    Another good thing if you like it is avocado

Then I would research this from the alternative medicine view and asian medicine view, which often have cures or treatments western medicine doesnt have....

(:|`|ALbWt2ylaa	Bananas - they're about the easiest food for your body to digest. They also have a good balance of nutrients, including potassium, that your body needs right now. (Just make sure they're fully ripe - no green left on them.) Take just one or two bites at first, and if it stays down, about 1/2 to 1 hour later you can eat a little more. Make sure you start it gradually - you need to get your stomach used to food again.
ItJzrvQ4aa	jogging is an excellent exercise because it let you lose weight  evenly throughout your whole body. If you want to lose weight in  specific areas, you should target them with exercises. If they are  your problem areas, they will be very difficult to tone. You will have  to work double on them. The best approach is this:  1. Lower/control your daily calorie intake (control for normal  weight, lower for overweight).  2. Run/jog to lower your overall body fat percentage.  3. Target your problem areas with exercises.  an  excellent  exercise,  you  can do it in front of your TV: sit on a  stool,  and  put  your toes under something (piece of heavy furniture,  for  example). In your hands hold a little dumbbell. Please, make sure  that  it  is  not very heavy, start with one kilo, for example, or you  will  damage  your  back and spine! Slowly move the upper part of your  body  back, until it's parallel with the ground. Stop for a second and  move it back to the sitting position. Repeat ten times. Every week add  to  the  number  of  repetitions.  You will see the results in a week,  guaranteed! You will see or feel under the fat - if you have any - six  pack  and  muscles.  Dumbbells  do  wonders.  Much  better  than these  crunches  -  I  came  up to three hundreds and there was no results AT  ALL. With the dumbbells you will see it in a week.|`|OySU2oAkaa	Drink lots of water to help break down the lipids (fat) in your abdominal region. I would also suggest eating a lot of protein and vitamin B since they will increase metabolic rates!    Last but not least, running and crunches. Interval training is key especially for running (jog for 2 min then sprint for 30 sec) and 100-200 crunches a night. You could do more but that's how many I do.    Hope that helps! For more advice check out http://i-dietandfitness.com|`|UZJ7wVc8aa	Getting a nice set of abs is such a misunderstood process. It's actually a lot easier than most people think which is why most people are in a never ending quest to get that perfect six pack - it's because they're doing all the wrong things.    When you eat more calories than you burn, your body takes those extra calories and stores them as fat somewhere on your body. For some people, the  1 fat storage area is around the thighs and for others it might be around the stomach - it differs from person to person. Sometimes the fat is perfectly distributed around the body so it's not as big of a concern.     If an excessive amount of fat is stored around your stomach, the reason that you're not seeing your abs is because your body fat percentage is too high. What you need to do is create a calorie deficit (take in less calories than you burn) so that your body is forced to use its fat stores for energy. After a few weeks of doing this, you'll notice that your abs will start to show.    You first step is to figure out how many calories you burn each day. Use this calculator http://calorieneedscalculator.com for an estimate. Now you need to increase the amount of calories you burn by exercising more and decreasing the amount of calories you eat. Cut out junk food such as fast food, candy and sugar. Eat foods that are high in fiber: bread and pasta made from 100% whole wheat, brown rice, oats, fruits and vegetables.    You shouldn't ignore targeting your abs with sit ups, leg raises and twists but doing hundreds of sit ups won't do anything about the layer of fat that is covering them. Cardio and calorie restriction should be your main focus. If you need more details on getting a six pack, visit The Guide to Getting Nice Abs - http://www.straightabs.com|`|48oRO9lPaa	Best way to lose weight is running and swimming.  I typically do my running at the gym, and then I have an ab workout program I do before I go to bed.

Also make sure you are eating healthy or else you are defeating the purpose of exercising/working out.

Makeup tends to make it more noticeable. The only thing I can suggest is this. Get a very light concealer, one that is even lighter then your neck shade. Then apply a foundation that matches the area where the hickey is at. Then to match the shadowing (contour) of your jawline, try using just a little bit blush all the way along your jawline.

Virgin coconut oils is great as a moisturizer too. If you google benefits of virgin coconut oil you'll see they are endless. To name a few:   - It is anti-microbial so it not only doesn't cause pimples but it actually gets rid of them. - It has been shown to help wrinkles. - It is loaded with lauric acid which is great for your immune system. - It is the best oil to cook with, it does not go rancid & it does not turn toxic at high temps.

Sometimes the dentist will have to cut the gum to make the tooth come out easier and if that is the case then a stich or two will be put in. However once the loal has worn off, the pain can be uncomfy but they usually sen dyou away with painkillers or advise you what to buy.    I had mine taken out under a general so i didnt have much of a local, i also dont tolerate any kind of pain very well and i managed without the painkillers. The pain wears off after a few hours but you will be given advice on what to do after. if you are a smoker then you should avoid smoking 24 hours after the tooth is removed to avoid infection as it will be an open wound, even with stiches|`|w9vw82PIaa	I had three extracted at the same time.  They do not break your jaw, they put a large clamp in your mouth to hold your jaw open (after you are asleep).  You will remember nothing.  I'm really fearful of needles and those weren't bad.  They numb your mouth and put you to sleep, so a double wammy of pain meds.  You'll have to get someone to drive you home, you will be really drugged up and want to go to bed afterwards. Your cheeks will be really swollen, you'll have cotton stuffed in the back of your mouth and usually an ice pack wrapped around your head (vertically, by your cheeks).   It'll take about 2 days to feel all right.  It is a little painful but not excruciating.  They give you pain medication to take home.  After you start to eat hard food again,  you have to clean the food and particles out of the holes left befind where the teeth are removed (which close up after a while).  This doesn't hurt, they'll give you a large plastic water syringe to squirt back in your mouth.  That is the grossest part, but you can eat real food shortly after.  The first few days are the hardest but by the end of the week you'll be fine.|`|PgFYPZg2aa	Only during and after, but other than that its great.  You don't have to go under, but the wisdom teeth tend to not be very "uniform" in people, the dentist isn't going to know how they are going to come out until he gets in there.

Q4ggnG0waa	Have you been to an ent? I have some of those symptoms, minus adams apple, often and have found zyrtec-d to be very helpful. It will take a few days to get relief.
zGKmgwofaa	Yes, you are indeed dying.    The symptoms you have are related to Chronic Severe Lymphatic-Brussels Syndrome. It proves to be fatal unless treated quickly.    It's common in animals too, so speaking to a veterinarian may be a cheap alternative for advice.|`|lCzBONU1aa	No more than the rest of us.    If you really thought you were dying, you would be in your doctor's office right now, not on the internet.|`|I83sYbARaa	Yes, it sounds like it could be a serious illness, but I think you should get it checked out by someone familiar with autoimmune and neurological illnesses...

I would see a doctor. My guess is that you my have Asthma or perhaps Bronchitis, which may explain the "tightness" in your chest and the runny nose. As for your tingling/ dead-weight extremities and frequent headaches, you may not be getting enough oxygen into your bloodstream and up to your brain; therefore, causing the sensations in your arms and legs, the explanation for your headaches, and the reason your eyes feel heavy. So, to conclude, I think the feelings you are experiencing are due to a lack of oxygen in your bloodstream. I would strongly suggest you see a doctor.|`|Tc23KWgzaa	A doctor could determine whether your symptoms are important or you just have the flu.  I'm not a doctor, sorry.

nAYqN4xBaa	i've had the same experience before, it will wear off as you get used to the medication so don't worry. Unless you feel like this medication isn't working out you could talk to your doctor about getting a different anti-depressant. I usually take my prozac at night before i go to bed because i don't want to be sleepy and tired during the day time. Try taking it at night and see how it works.|`|AA10500537	throw them away and dont take them   they are dangerous to take|`|gC8xO53Oaa	When I was on Prozac, my doctor told me to take at bedtime. Did your doctor tell you to take it in the daytime? Call and ask him if it's ok to change to night. I'm sure it won't make a difference. It's important to try and take it every day around the same time and bedtime usually doesn't change that much or often.|`|UIDfTmbcaa	Prozac doesn't er didn't make me tired. It is also known as the happy pill. Are there other medications that you take in the p.m. that could have a lasting affect into the a.m. could you need welbutrin(???spelling???) to counteract those affects? make sure you talk to your psychologist/psychiatrist before doing any adjustments no matter how simple the change may seem. oh yeah um Prozac takes at least a month and sometimes more or less for others to come to fruition. the level needs to build up in your system before the real affects are seen.|`|bvoZZY3uaa	Prozac has a very half life of 6-7 days so it will make no difference what time you take it.

They have something from the doctor to put on it, I tried some stuff lying around the house with good sucess.  The first thing was Neosporin, helped get rid of it, and when the times were bad and it itched more than I could handle, I put a clear anti-itch lotion, something like calamine but clear.

683fba774a10fec8e7e8b8ea4c6b7561aa	It is possible that etreme nervousness may cause a raise in the blood pressure; which may get stabilised and come down when you relax for a second reading.  But what causes this extreme nervousness is important to be eliminated by an ECG, investigating for a thyroid function test(T3, T4, TSH), diabetes etc., by a cardiologist, before concluding the same as functional for necessary treatment.|`|I83sYbARaa	Yes it could....   it could be anywhere from 140 to your 151 just by nerves|`|3V1U3wxeaa	Certainly, the nervousness and the large cup of coffee could both raise your blood pressure.  Likely the coffee caused the shakiness.  You did not mention if you had eaten or not, but I presume not, which is also a factor in both the shakiness and the elevated pressure reading.  Some mild meditation techniques designed to reduce nervousness (deep breathing and calm mind) will help you determine for sure if you have hypertension.|`|RY1xuwzoaa	Absolutely.  Some people have what they call "White Coat Hypertension" which basically means that when you're at the doctor and nervous and they check your blood pressure, it's always high, but if you check it at home or in the supermarket when you're relaxed it's completely normal.    My blood pressure in the last year has ranged from 115/71 at home and resting to 155/99 while at the doctors office and really stressed out because I was missing work and I was at the doctors office because of anxiety attacks - so in short - YES ...   nervousness and anxiety can make a HUGE swing in your blood pressure.    It's not a bad idea to check it a few times when you're relaxed and alone at a CVS or something just to confirm - but based on the info you've given it's very unlikely that you have high blood pressure.  It was a mix of 1. lack of sleep (makes it go up), 2. caffeine (makes it go up), and 3. nervousness (makes it go up)...    Viola!|`|5MgxhF7waa	It is very possible that anxiety caused a brief spike in blood pressure.|`|AA11415608	Yes, "white coat hypertension", but it sounds like you are generally a  "worry wart"  The length and detail of your question is a testament to that.  That's ok,  one is nervous about things they don't necessarily understand. A systolic of 151 is not critical and definitely can reflect an anxious moment.    Something  you can do is go to one of those automatic BP machines, drug stores often have them, and sit down for a few minutes to relax, then take your blood pressure calmly.    Good luck.|`|gMHwrbRlaa	You should take your BP at a drug store or buy a home monitor. The home monitors are accurate for the higher number. Then see your doctor. Make sure the BP is taken in your dominant arm. For most people that's their right arm of course.    Not to alarm you, but all of the statistics on the harmful effects of high blood pressure are for blood pressures taken in doctors offices. So if you find you BP is much lower at home or anywhere other than the doctor's office you may still have a problem.

Some substances should only be withdrawn from in a medically supervised setting, as there is always a chance of having a seizure during the withdrawal process.    Okay, now you gave good info.

I'm tired of all the stupid "white lie" comercials. Smoking does not brake up a family like dranking does. The problem with the taxing of smokers is because that law has not changed since when smoking was accepted and now that its not they don't have enough smokers to support the cause.

Here is the Vitamin  Max N?Fuze? Product  Max N-Fuze?, the third and newest product from Max International,represents a radical new approach to nutrient supplementation. This breakthrough, patent-pending product design represents the fusion of established science and forward-thinking nanotechnology to ensure your cells are receiving the nutrients they need to perform and communicate to their full potential.      Heres what Max N-Fuze? offers:   Promotes the production of the bodys natural cellular functions, including the endogenous antioxi-dants (originating from within the body) superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT); as well as supporting leptin sensitivity.*   Provides needed nutrients to further optimize glutathione (GSH) production.*   Delivers both minerals and herbal ingredients to support optimal cell function, cellular communication and cellular defense mechanisms.*        Max N-Fuze? Whole Food Comparison  To find the equal value of nutrients in a single serving of Max N-Fuze?, you would have to consume:     1 cup of spinach to equal the amount of vitamin A   4 oranges to equal the amount of vitamin C   8 glasses of milk to equal the amount of vitamin D   6 pounds of avocados to equal the amount of vitamin E   150 cloves of garlic to equal the amount of vitamin B-1   6 cups of almonds to equal the amount of vitamin B-2   5 large potatoes to equal the amount of niacin   3 pounds of raw cauliflower to equal the amount of vitamin B-5   70 eggs to equal the amount of vitamin B-6   40 spears of asparagus to equal the amount of folate   2 gallons of yogurt to equal the amount of vitamin B-12   28.5 cups of Swiss chard to equal the amount of biotin   3.5 pounds of raw tofu to equal the amount of selenium   4.5 cups of green peas to equal the amount of zinc   6 cups of garbanzo beans to equal the amount of manganese    Nutritional equivalents based upon data from the USDA Nutrient Data Laboratory     Max N-Fuze? provides the needed nutrients to further support the function of MaxGXL?. It contains D-ribose and CoQ10 to support ATP (energy) production and function. Exogenous antioxidants sources ease the burden of endogenous antioxidants. It also provides the vitamins and minerals needed to support leptin sensitivity making Max N-Fuze the perfect companion to MaxGXL and MaxWLX.   Here is some info on Max GXL  Glutathione  Simply put, glutathione (GSH) is the body's master antioxidant. It is a small protein produced naturally in our cells when certain required elements are present. It functions both as an antioxidant and an antitoxin and is a major defense system against illness and aging. Our glutathione level actually indicates our state of health and can predict longevity. Although there are more than 60,000 published papers on the beneficial effects of glutathione replacement, it is still largely ignored by mainstream medicine. In the near future the importance of glutathione will be widely recognized because it has the ability to boost the immune system and fight off the damage of free radicals on the cells.    Modern research has shown that individuals who have low levels of glutathione are susceptible to chronic illness. Decreased levels of glutathione can be brought about by continual stress upon the immune system. As we now know, a lowered immune system can bring about illness and disease. This is a ferocious cycle. While you need glutathione for a productive immune system, a weakened immune system hampers the production of glutathione.    Glutathione has been shown to slow down the aging process, detoxify and improve liver function, strengthen the immune system, and reduce the chances of developing cancer. Glutathione also works to help improve mental functions, increase energy, improve concentration, permit increased exercise, and improve heart and lung function - just to name a few.

Get as comfortable as possible and make sure the room is as dark as possible and free from noise. If you don't fall asleep within say, 20 minutes, get up, leave the room and go read or watch TV for awhile until you feel sleepy again. Then go back to bed and keep repeating this routine until you finally go to sleep. If you don't sleep at all that night or only for a few hours, maintain your routine anyway and do NOT take a nap the next day. Sooner or later your body will crave the sleep it needs and you will fall asleep. Routine is the important thing here, and once your body gets used to this routine you won't have a problem falling asleep. It's tough at first, but it is well worth it once you establish it.    Make sure to "wind down" a good few hours before your bed time and try to stop eating at least two hours before bed time. Make sure your bed is comfortable, and the bedroom is as quiet and dark as possible.|`|10AvUf8Jaa	Relax and listen to soothing music about 30 minutes before bead.

(usually I have cottage cheese with fruit after I get up and eat a protein bar @ about 10am)  Lunch=A small green salad or piece of fruit, a sandwich or 8oz soup or ravioli cup,  yogurt (or other dairy protein)  Mid-afternoon snack @ about 3pm: an apple & cheese stick (or any other protein & fruit)  Dinner: salad or fruit, small portion 4 oz meat meal, cup of vegs,   Desert: small low calorie pudding  This will help you lose about a pound a week or if you get regular fat items you will maintain your weight|`|ZjEEg7JWaa	depends how hungry am but tbh i normally just snack loads yupp im very unhealthy but i just dont have time for anything else....sometimes get 1meal in though =]|`|8dhe15MUaa	only one that why i only 9 stone|`|mh0QRDE9aa	Breakfast, mid-morning snack - lunch - mid-afternoon snack - light dinner - light snack 2 hrs before bed time.

If you're not sleeping around then try some antifungal creme and/or some hydrocortisone and try not to scratch.  If you've had the possibility of being exposed to an STD then you probably want to get to a doc to have it checked out just to be save.  Most stuff is curable if caught early but can sterilize you if  you let the infection sit in your body and do damage.    Good luck.
ZTki9Xh5aa	HMOs have taken over and made health care and customer service a business.  With insurance you have a chance.  Without it, plan to have issues.  Either way, using the ER is a waste of time unless you are on your death bed, as they are normally understaffed and overworked.  There is no urgency in the ER unless you are about to die on their premises, which is not what they want.      Money talks, that answers your double standard question along with the insurance information above.   Best wishes.|`|9pLdhuBnaa	The ramifications of a patient using the ER as a primary care clinic is that of having to wait hours on end, especially if their case is not a major emergency like that of those who are dying.  The ramification to the provider is that by having these non-medical emergencies come to the ER for primary care problems it takes away from the patients who are having the major medical emergency.    I do think that there are some issues where there can be a double standard when it comes to the issue of ambulatory care because not everyone can afford to pay upfront for the care, even with the help of insurance.
AA11404742	MK, it's OK - this is part of the process to help you get past this point in your life.  The psychiatrist will only talk to you right now.  If he asks about things that upset you, stay calm and work with him.  If it's so upsetting that you simply can't talk about it, tell him that.  Tell him it's too upsetting to talk about it now.  Understand that you may have to talk about these things at some time, of course, but don't stress over it now.    And I'm no doctor, but my guess is that the reason they want you to go off your meds right now is so that the psychiatrist can see you as you are without them, so that he can help decide what's the best way to handle your depression and bipolarism.      You can get through this.|`|ec76af399c519dad926a10430304f541aa	afraid of what?  seriously, he isn't going to roast you on a spit, he isn't even going to touch you, all he will do is talk to you and listen to you talk to him... what on earth is there to be afraid of?

Also, he is the one person in the world you can tell anything. he can not repeat what you say to anyone without your consent.

wXGO15Puaa	Don't be so hard on yourself. Many people stay back sometime during school. Keep working at graduating with your class, though. Nothing is impossible though. The school year is only half way done. Let's say you have 2D averages in each class.A D is usually about a 69. Lets say you can pull off 2 Bs. Bs are about an 85. 85x2=170. 69x2=138. Add them together and you get 308. 308 divided by 4 is a 77, which is a C+, which is passing. There's still hope. We all have rough times, and so many people are having a shitter right now. Keep trying. I have had times where I wanted to give up on life too, and kill myself, look at my qnas. Don't do it. Get on your teacher's good sides and show them you are trying to work with them. They honestly aren't out to hurt you, they care about you, and want to see you graduate. They will help you do it if you meet them halfway.|`|ec76af399c519dad926a10430304f541aa	pretty obvious you worry too much about what other people think of you, you need to get over that.  And you need to think better of yourself, if you don't, no one else will either.  You haven't said anything about why you think all these "changes" occurred in you... suspect you need to address that with your counselor/therapist.|`|tmL3zyVyaa	Did something happen to you for you to be like this?|`|WJjr2E0haa	Well, what has changed over the past 2 years other than you going to HS? Did you move? Are you using any type of drugs? Did you lose someone close to you? I kind of understand what you are going through because I get those same feelings every once in a while. This is not your fault (unless you are on drugs). I suggest writing in a journal. This way you can write your true feelings down and you don't have to worry about being judged. Really, you need to try to remember what happened in your life when you started feeling this way and if you work hard enough and show your teachers that you are trying I bet they will be more willing to work with you so that you can graduate with your class. Good luck and I hope this helps.

You could start finding out about nutrition and healthy diets, and take the test at michael thurmonds site to find your body type and the best diet for you.... the best all you can eat foods and the ones you should avoid...  On the surface it may not seem like much problem, but you are actually headed in the direction of having serious digestive problems with these symptoms....  so , change your diet, and find a really good probiotic formula from a health food store and start taking that...  as western medicine fails you, you may consider looking into asian medicine called traditional chinese medicine, because they are experts on fixing and rebuilding the digestion, and other things.  Stop eating processed food, shop health food, have yourself checked for food sensativities, usually a naturopathic doctor does this, not regular medicine and some chiropractics....  and next time you see a doctor ask for a simple blood test to check your thyroid, and read up on thyroid and its symptoms at www.about.thyroid.com  because digestive problems is a symptom.....  start taking care of yourself better..... good 'luck'|`|10AvUf8Jaa	Fried foods, beans, food high in fiber can also.|`|XLsnuAqmaa	salt and salty foods|`|Q5gG3R0Saa	Salty foods.

D0JsiC0Paa	Well, there's no such thing - but in theory, it woul be the donor. However, it would not be 'entirely' them as there are other types of memory that exist outside the brain, like 'muscle' memory and reflexes, many people believe there to be a mind/body distinction, a distinct seperation between the head brain and the 'gut', as well as aversions to certain substances and intolerances in the overall biology of the receiver - perhaps a craving for cigarettes etc...but the conscious mind would be that of the donor. The donor would not also be bound by all the physical limitations of the receiver.|`|biFCKGAcaa	Brain Transplant is practically not possible and not done at all. As there are many thousands (millions?) of nerves in the spinal cord, which must connect to the brain, reconnecting during a transplant would be extremely difficult. A brain transplant is a hypothetical operation that would move the brain of one being into the body of another. It is a procedure distinct from head transplant, which involves transferring the entire head to a new body, as opposed to the brain only. Unless the brain is declated as dead no organ even is transplanted.     Coming to the point of transplant of any organ, the organ in question will go and activate the system of receiver. Hence it should be taken as receiver got the life. -|`|5ad5598dc77782773e361b3821253d4eaa	There is no such thing as a brain transplant or reincarnation of any kind. Ask your self in reincarnation of a soul ( and the brain is part of this hypothetical soul) what happens to the soul (mind) of the animal (person) into which the individual is being reincarnated (brain transplanted). Is he/she (it) completely replaced or destroyed? How can one destroy a soul or a mind? It is commonly believed in many religions that reincarnation takes place but I think if your study them and find out the answer to the questions posed above you will have the answer to your question.    Good luck.
3PuKXEwZaa	You should not wait before going to the dentist.  Your first visit you can find out why your tooth is hurting and what will be needed to fix your tooth.  This appointment will not be very expensive.  Then when you get your refund you can go in and have whatever procedure needs to be done.  You may be in need of some antibiotics for an infection.  I would not want to see your tooth become worse and you be a lot of pain because you waited a few weeks.|`|QUCIdBp5aa	Listen to Dan.  Go to the Dentist.  I didn't go for many years due to my financial situation and any excuse I could find.  I waited until the pain was so severe I couldn't sleep and the painkillers weren't even taking the edge off.    Go ASAP.  The longer you wait, the worse it will get.  Guaranteed.    Although I don't know any dentists in NC, I highly recommend asking people you know that have had any work done.
HPpdcAtAaa	First, you're a good boyfriend to help her through this.      Second, she needs to see a therapist, this is more than anyone can handle alone and she really sounds like she needs professional help (which your school should provide for free).

Understand that she is going to think she is just fine, and she doesn't need her medication.  Along with the ups and downs, this seems to be a never ending cycle.    Talk to her parents.  They may not be seeing the same signs that you are seeing.  Take your parents with you, and make it clear that you care for her and only want to see her safe and well.  Make sure she is not there during the first conversation, but include her in conversations after that.  Her parents will need to be the ones to get her the help she needs.|`|mOayTJDmaa	It's hard.  I've been married to one for 15 years.  And I feel like I need to just go with the flow.  My only advise is to take care of yourself, don't expect anything of her, and be by her when she needs you.|`|MyMCIzOlaa	As a mental health nurse, I have this to say: Bipolar disorder is misunderstood by a lot of people.  Educate yourself about it.  Is this diagnosed by a doctor/psychiatrist/mental health nurse practitioner?  Or did your GF diagnose herself?  Is she on meds?  If so, she may need to see her prescriber for adjustment.  If not, she should be.  Bipolar disorder is highly treatable with medication when used properly.  It is very important for people with bipolar disorder (or any other diagnosis) to take responsibility for their behavior, and not blame it on their illness.  It does not sound like she is doing that.  It also sounds like she is manipulating you and others, creating chaos, and being melodramatic, which are not related to bipolar disorder.  It makes me wonder if your GF has any other diagnosable mental health issues.      Now, as the mother of a 15 year old boy, I have this advice: Your girlfriend is melodramatic and manipulative.  A diagnosis of bipolar disorder does not forgive that.  It sounds like she has a personality disorder, and those are VERY hard to treat and very hard for the person to change.  Get out now!  If you accept this type of treatment from a girl at 15 AND IT'S CAUSING YOU TROUBLE, the amount of emotional abuse you will tolerate will increase as you get older!  You deserve a happy life!
4vLt3SqFaa	I must confess as a medical professional that there is rarely a need to do a pelvic on a virgin let alone do it multiple times over the years.  If  woman denies vaginal sexual activity I would not do one routinely. There is a slight chance of cervical cancer at a young age but so rare you must weigh the discomfort you wil inflict upon a virgin against the very minimal risk.        In today's suit happy society I think your doctor is just covering themselves but there is a heck of lot more to caring for someones physical needs than making sure you don't get sued.  You placed your trust in the doctor not to hurt you or at least to warn you if she had to and she failed to live up to that trust.      It was not malpractice but it does indicate that the person she is really looking out for is not the patient and anytime there is a questionable call to make she will error on the side of protecting herself and your discomfort and wishes be damned.  I expect a partnership with the doctor and the patient where the concerns and wishes of the patient are considered as valid and important in deciding what needs to be done. Infections rarely require internal visualization to determine -a simple swab without speculum works.    Maybe because I am a male I am very respectful of virginal conditions.  However hymens break in many ways and you are not less virginal because of it.  I do suggest a new doctor|`|45hecz6laa	I don't know if it happens a lot, but if I were you I would switch doctors and ask them about it.|`|6pw9BAz7aa	you can get a law suit against them i would be mad and take action|`|V27IROySaa	Personally, it hurts everytime I get a pap smear and I am not a virgin.  Plus, I don't mind pain, getting tattooed is a favorite past time of mine.  I think that it is normal for some girls to have their hymens broken at the gyno's.  I have had friends that had that happen to them as well.     I know its upsetting but so many girls have theirs broken in ways that do not involve sex and some girls barely have one to begin with anyway.  Maybe you should talk to the doctor about it or from now on find someone else who is more gentle.|`|cDhOPpWfaa	My gynecologist has more than one size speculum.  When I went for my first exam, she used the smallest speculum that the office had so that there would be little to no discomfort.  (When she used the smallest one there was actually no discomfort or pain at all)  The next year when I went back for another visit she used the next size up.  So, I think you need to either talk to your doctor about using another size speculum or get a new doctor.  Your GYN doesn't sound very caring and I know that if I was in pain my doctor would stop immediately and find a way to lessen the pain because it shouldn't hurt that bad.  I was a vrigin when I first went and it didn't hurt at all.  As far as the bleeding goes, a little blood is to be expected, but if there is a lot of blood there is something wrong.|`|GpitqYxcaa	Well the pain obviously came from your hymen being broken. It can be broken from anything from climbing a tree as a little girl or playing softball out with some friends. It depends on the girl. So it is possible that it could happen to other people.    Good luck though,    -Billy|`|zLGOQQs5aa	omg! im sorry! but ive never been to a GYN.|`|MhpccWpmaa	You can break your hymen from putting a tampon on so it doesn't surprise me that her inserting the speculum broke it. It's normal for exams to hurt and not feel pleasant.  I'm not a virgin and they hurt everytime, and the last time I went he made me bleed by doing a pap.  If you're not satisfied with her, swtich doctors|`|224cm8qtaa	Her breaking the Hymen explains why you were in so much pain. That doesn't feel good.|`|xo1Lbui5aa	sorry, she doesnt really know what she's doing. When I was a virgin, I never got hurt like that.  Consider goin to another one because nobody deserves to be treated like that, or needs to have a GYN that doesnt know what he/she is doing|`|y8HyP1bzaa	I would definitely consider switching to a different gynecologist!
MhpccWpmaa	He sounds dangerous, if I were you I would move out while he's at work.  It you don't want to do that then you need to tell him that he scares you and that he needs to stop controlling you because you're not his property.  If he ever hits you, call the police.

Go back to that orthodontist and explain the situation.    I'm sorry to hear about your mom and the financial situation.  I have a suspicion that your family may owe the doctor's office money.  However, they should still take of the braces on request.    If you've moved away or are too embarassed to go in, try a local dental school; work there is always cheaper.    I spent three years working in a non profit clinic and got quite good at removed braces that had been on for 5,10, even 15 years.   Please please...even if someone is charging a couple hundred bucks, come up with the money and GET THEM OFF!   Call around and get someone to feel sorry for you or call your state's dental society or association and ask what can be done.      otherwise,  you will get decay under the bands and brackets and will have bigger and bigger problems with cavities, toothaches and gingivitis.       In the mean time, brush carefully 3 times per day, get flossers to get UNDER the wires and all and rinse twice a day w/ a fluoride rinse like ACT.  That will help put off the damage.|`|af164a3b6e946847180b9f2270d5bdcaaa	find a dentist. PRONTO!|`|80d6d2dcb2a23de87ed67082213ca743aa	If you have some sort of a financial situation, you should explain it to the orthdontist and ask if you can pay once you get the money. But they will absolutely take off the braces! There is no question about it. Now if your mom can't drive you or something ask your friends mom,  or a relative that lives close to you. Because having your braces on for too long can very much DAMAGE your teeth. Make sure you are brushing very well. Also, I don't think your orthodontist could be that careless. They will call you and notify you if you missed an appointment. Im pretty sure they would notice if you were supposed to get your braces off 2 years ago. Sounds pretty fishy...|`|7ae612d040903b28f82075fdfd31fb8daa	Did she not pay the orthodontist 2 years ago in full?  If she did, you can still go back there and have them take them off no charge.  If the bill was not paid, you still should contact the orthodontist and ask if they can at least remove the braces for you.  Explain your financial situation to them.

cee773308960576c4eff032efec9f92baa	Yes, crooked teeth can be straightened. Keep in mind that these procedures are often very costly and insurance may not cover it all or you may max out your ins. for the year on only a fraction of the cost. But a pretty smile is priceless!    But first let me assure that while sucking your thumb can contribute to teeth not coming in straight, it is most certainly not the only cause. And thumb sucking mostly effects the front teeth. Braces are almost always a must. In my area, they range from $4000 to $8000, depending on how many sets you need. People often have uneven teeth b/c their jaw bones are not large enough to support all their teeth w/ even amounts of space. When this is the case, the Orthodontist may need to extract a couple or several teeth to give the others room to straighten out.   There are more options, but the are the most common.

Also , try cough drops . Get non-medicated ones so you can constantly keep them in your mouth . Medicated ones , like sucrets , you can only have one every 3 hours or so . But Halls fruit breezers, you can pop one in after the other and they taste good too ! They're my favorite .  Taking motrin or tylenol may also help reduce the pain .    Motrin will help your fever too . Cough drops or cough medicine can help your cough .    I also hear gargling with salt water helps your throat , but that's disgusting . I've found that gargling with a minty mouth wash such as Listerine helps my throat feel better temporarily , but I'm not sure if that's just me . Haha , it's worth a shot though , right ?    Get well soon , and know that I'm fighting one as you are !

Chicken doesn't make boobs grow big.|`|96f241b3264f0a185f94d5e85bb3e90baa	The only reason I can see for your boobs to be getting bigger from eating chicken is the fat content because our chest is full of fat. After all that is what boobs are. The chicken itself will not enlarge them, but the skin will. If it is that much of a concern for you, try skinless chicken- also depends on how much you consume. If your body is not able to convert the chicken into the energy your body will use, then it will store as fat and be deposited thoughout your body.
6c24bd09d5554084f9dcc2b1547b01d3aa	It definitely doesn't sound like autism. I would think more along the lines of a form of schizoprenia. Autism is hallmarked by antisocial behavior and developmental delays. Often people with schizophrenia are very bright, and many of the symptoms can mimic many of the symptoms you would find in a case of Autism. It doesn't sound like Tourettes either. In any case she needs to see a nuerologist. Also at the age of 12, it would fit into the age of onset for schizophrenia. There is clearly something going on with her though and she needs to be looked at by a doctor. Good luck to you both|`|f07fcbc73167e1f53e0b4e1137fd8122aa	That sounds more like OCD, or a mild form of autism.

It is the easiest activity among all the exercise programs and does not involve stress to the body. Apart from the activity of walking, a systematic dietary pattern should be followed so that you are always free from the obesity symptoms.    Generally people, who are overweight, are usually not interested in physical activities. They prefer doing any type of work but without moving from one place to another. They usually enjoy watching TV and having something to eat. For this category, fixing a program like aerobics or floor exercises would require great efforts. Therefore walking is the most recommended form of exercise. For the beginners it is ideal to walk for 15-20 minutes daily. Gradually, the time can be extended daily until they are capable of walking 60 minutes a day.    When the doctors prescribe pills for the patients, they advice the patients to spend some time walking around. The tablets are effective only when combined with the healthy dietary patterns and a daily exercise activity. Losing weight is a difficult task, and people who are disciplined and take exercise seriously, would lose weight. So take your exercise activity seriously and be active throughout the day.

My cousin got her breast reduction, tummy tuck and facelift surgery in India by the company called Forerunners Healthcare .The Price for the surgery she paid in India was very less. She paid 30% of the cost she was quoted in America.    Forerunners Healthcare is very famous in India. They arrange cosmetic and plastic surgery for foreigners in India. I read a lot about them in the Newspapers and about their patient stories. They arrange financing for USA, Canadian, UK and other international patients who plan to have surgery abroad for low price, as the breast reduction, tummy tuck, facelift and other cosmetic surgery is not covered by insurance. They also have photos pasted of their International patients. You can checkout their website. There are huge cost savings. As a doctor I personally believe that surgery can be easily handled in India, as the quality of healthcare available In India is simply best in the world. The surgeons are USA/UK trained and facilities are 5 star.    http://www.forerunnershealthcare.com  Hope this helps.

dgL8IMGfaa	Hi, i think you have answered your own question XD  "I eat sh*t all day and just keep putting on the pounds!"   Don't eat as much, and eat around 2300 calories a day and cut them down when you loose more weight, and count them properly, be quite strict and you should loose the weight in 8 months... to be realistic :)  " I do belong to a gym right now, but I don't go."   Go to the gym about 4 times a week, and do as much as you can, take some water too, spinning classes are really good for burning fat! And swimming is perfect for toning muscles!    If you like snacks, and spicy things, here is the snack for you! (it is 100 calories, and really filling. It may not sound like it but you need to try it to find out.)    Rivita mini cracker + jalapenos, they are really nice, and if you don't like them too spicy just add less jalapenos and more of the juice :D.    I  I really hoped i helped :) good luck xox, hope you loose what u want!|`|8df61e6bfe8263f863d58536e87602e0aa	since you are so overweight and have such a large goal i would reccomend seeing your docotr. she can provide you with a nutritionist or diet plan as well as a group like weight watchers to follow. no one on yahoo! answers will be able to give you the correct plan for your large goal. it will probably take a few years so start soon!|`|mh0QRDE9aa	Ok, first thing to do is get with a personal trainer at the gym.  Ask them about nutrition, because if they have the proper credentials they will know about it.  Don't take any supplements they offer, they make commission on selling things you don't need.  You could also use a nutritionist to help create a healthy eating plan for you.  ONLY you can make the difference in your life, and that would depend on how much desire and determination you have.  You may find a buddy to work out with to make it fun and enjoyable.   It will take you about 1 yr to lose 110 lbs.
f23220e7160e721cb2f13e79a0ec89b4aa	sounds like you are having genetic testing done, where are you having it done at? Number one for genetic testing in the u.s. is Maryland, number 2 is Wisconsin.

The most common of these is hypokalemic periodic paralysis, in which attaks are triggered by sweets and salt as well as exercise. Patients note that the disease is worse in teenage years. in paramyotonia congenita if weakness occurs it happens after a bout of myotonia(when muscles are stiff and won't relax). these are associated with mutations in calcium, sodium, or potassium channels causing muscle dysfunction..these are not always inherited.

You could try the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota or St.Jude's childrens hospital or in my state Barnes Jewish hospital/Children's Hospital which has an out of this world facility for kids. The doctors are great and they love the kids. when you say you have had genetic testing are you testing for an inherited problem or mutations in just his make up...becaue your son has a 50-50 chance of inheriting what i have stated above...sometimes it is not inherited.

2bf0afb576f3b1843272a3d582d8496eaa	I went through a very severe trauma after my husband made a violent attempt on my life.  I was able to call friends and stay with them.  Every one of my husband's friends came over to see me every single night for weeks and made me talk.  We talked and talked until all hours of the morning.  We talked, I talked until the words could no longer come out of my mouth.  If it had not been for those friends, I would have never made it.  If I had not talked I would have never made it.  I spent so much energy talking that much of the pain spilled out of me.  Talking saved my life and those friends who made me talk saved my soul.  Talking is so very important.  You hold in you all the pain and fear and anger -- and when you  talk they can all be released.  It is energy.  It is hard to hold things in you.  And holding things in you will cause you to withdraw into a shell you may never want to crawl out of.      Living is the most important thing to do.  Pope John Paul II once said, "Fear not, Fear not, Fear not."  Three times he said it.  He wanted to impress upon us that fear is not living.      I won't say that everything will be rosy afterwards, because you are not the same person since this happened.  But you can find life and joy again.  And talking is really the first step.  You must let the pain out.  Please, believe me, listen to what I've said.  Please, find a way to get help.  You are asking for help here, so I know you want to move forward.  Please do counseling.|`|043fb49c9cb84a23b4abd645432df79aaa	They do have support groups to help.  I know you said that counselling isn't an option--but in time will help.

Living with PTSD is not an option.      I was in your position 10+ years ago after being beaten & raped by a boyfriend.  I had been abused by my father as well and thought that this was the life I deserved, that somehow all the bad stuff was my fault.  I bottled all the hurt inside and tried to be tough.  I didn't start seeing a counselor until my husband insisted on it just a few weeks ago.  True, without counseling, the nightmares & terror may ease a bit over time, but you will never be able to get over this by yourself.  This is not a matter of being strong enough to "get over it".  If you cant talk about the event, perhaps you can talk about the way the event has changed your life.  If you can type about it, maybe you can talk about it.  Eventually you will be able to talk about the actual event.  When it comes to getting help, surprisingly, the details of the attack don't matter as much as the way you are dealing with it.  I actually found it easier to talk to a counselor than to someone I knew.  My counselor has made a huge change in my life in only 3 weeks.  I was actually amazed at how much better I felt simply getting it all off my chest in one long cry.  You have to figure out how to function normally again.  If you cannot bring yourself to talk to a counselor, maybe a change of scene would help.  Take a weekend trip to a nice bed & breakfast in the country.  Take walks in the woods, sit on the porch and drink cocoa, etc...  Barricading yourself in the house (aka scene of the crime) is the worst thing you can do right now.  I know.  I've been there.  I had a baseball bat & a big *** rock!   If I had seen a counselor back when I first needed to, I could have avoided the decade of self-destructive behavior and misery.  And, I wouldn't have hurt my husband, the only man I have let into my life since the rape.    I assume that you filed a police report.  Check with the police.  There may be a victim's assistance program that can provide free counseling.  Your health insurance may also cover counseling.  Hope you feel better!

yjXUE8bWaa	PLEASE OH PLEASE GO GET CHECKED FOR A THING CALLED PID(Pelvic inflamitory disease) this infection will destroy your uterus given time, and can hide, very well I might add. Dont wait. PID can hide for months and cause very strange symptoms. Not the kind you would expect from a regular infection. Believe me I know. I had it about 15 years ago. I almost lost my life. I was dating a man, who I thought was faithful, but he wasnt. He gave me PID because he was having sex with mulitple partners. I was young, scared and very ill. If left unchecked, untreated, it can scar your uterus so you cant have kids. Inside your uterus the lining is kind of like a crumpled tissue, PID comes along and makes it smoother. So when you decide you want to start a family, the egg has a hard time sticking to the uterine wall. Etopic pregnancy is higher in PID survivors, because of  the scarring damage it can cause. Caught early prognosis is FULL RECOVERY. But you need to be seen by a DR. Tell the DR you suspect PID and that your ex bf was unfaithful, and describe the symptoms. Usually you only have 5 to 7 min to talk to a DR in an appointment so have your thoughts organized to make the most of your visit with him or her. Heres the breakdown of symptoms for you.      Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) is a serious infection of the female reproductive system that can develop when certain sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) go untreated. In most cases, it occurs when bacteria from the STD in the vagina or cervix move into the uterus and upper genital tract. The most common organisms that lead to PID are gonorrhea and chlamydia, highly contagious STDs.  OR FROM A MAN WHO WAS HAVING ANAL SEX AND DIDNT WASH, AND THEN HAS VAGINAL SEX.    Untreated PID can damage the fallopian tubes, ovaries, and uterus, leading to chronic pelvic pain and serious damage to the reproductive system. PID is the most common, preventable cause of infertility, and can also lead to ectopic pregnancies.    The good news is that when PID causes symptoms, it is easy to diagnose and can be treated with antibiotics. The essential part is to detect it before it leads to serious health problems. About 2 out of 3 cases of PID are unrecognized and, therefore, may be untreated if people aren't screened for STDs. So teenage girls who are sexually active should take precautions to keep from contracting STDs, and eventually PID, and be screened for STDs regularly.    Symptoms  Signs and symptoms of PID often appear during or after menstruation but may appear days, weeks, or longer after exposure to an STD, or not at all.    The most frequent symptoms of PID include:    vaginal discharge with an smell-OR no smell  pain during urination   aching pain in the lower abdomen   fever and chills   nausea and vomiting   hot flashes  flush or pale face skin  irregular menstrual bleeding   pain during sex   fatigue-tired all the time-(but can't sleep)  diarrhea     Unusual smptoms can occur too:  strange colored discharge-without period  odd colored menses-red with orange streaks-with or without period  cant sit down without pain in glutes- (your butt)  pains shooting down your butt and legs  legs can seem to settle-(like rls*restless leg syndrome)  lower back pain-like right under the kidney region    VERY RARE, BUT CAN OCCUR-rapid heart rate(racing heart)almost like panic attacks    And if you find a Dr that wont listen to you, get a second opinon.If they say you are fine, and wont do bloodwork to check you white blood cell count then go to a different DR its very important that if you have PID that it is treated, if you are given anitbiotics, TAKE THEM ALL AS PERSCRIBED, EVEN IF YOU FEEL BETTER. PID Will hide and it will flare back up if not completely destroyed. Also if you have been diagnosed with PID always protect yourself, make sure your bathtub is clean everytime you soak in the tub, make sure your partner has just showered, or is fairly clean. The chances of you getting PID again after you have had it once, is higher and you are more vulnerable to getting another infection again. Even if there is no introduced (stds). Like dirty tubs, unwashed toys, partner with foreskin and hasnt washed that day. ect.  Don't wait, get seen ok?  Protect your body, you only get one.:)     PS A good DR will recognize the signs and symptoms of PID without bloodwork. I'm just giving you all the extra details to arm yourself, because I had to go to three DRs before they found the PID. I did make a full recovery, Thank God, disease free, and my husband of 10 years and I have been blessed with two beautiful children and one on the way.;)|`|F6jBrNmuaa	???????|`|TTvTarVdaa	it could be your appendix, which side is it on? if it's on your right I would go to a doctor.

I probabily think that may be the same with you, however, if you really mean "Knife~" in your words then i suggest you see GP straight away, it could be serious, but if you exaggerated a little then do what im doing, just stay calm, relax and keep your mind of it, this will help you mentally, physically (if constipated) eat plenty of apples, grapes, prunes and any food high in fibre, remember to drink plenty of water while doing so; as too much FIBRE with no FLUID can cause further constipation. Whatever happens god bless, and like me be a warrior fight it out, and im a guy :P  Oh and another note, if you feel the pain is within your abdomen, then the problem can be either via the Stomach, Intestines, Liver or Gallbladder, if i were you i would personally write a days notebook of how the pain has progressed throughout the day and compare days after that, if you feel it is unbarable every 40-50 seconds then it could be an Ulcer (damaged tissue) or internal bleeding, just keep having hope, i really hope this works out for you.|`|hN2j60pgaa	pregnant?|`|2Gve5Xigaa	preggo?|`|HrSnooIGaa	this happens when woman do not have enough sex..|`|xfZeJAQPaa	sounds like something is seriously bothering you: can't sleep, stomach pain... whatever it is, just get it over with.

9YiPxyqxaa	As you age, your body makes small changes as you walk, run, or do anything, really.   If you've leaned on that foot a lot recently, then it could be a result of the hardened skin to protect your feet was pressed too hard too long for a long time, resulting in a weird "folding." I don't know how it feels, so I can't know for sure.    Is it soft? Is it hard? Does it have a scaly texture?     Everyone has different ways of dealing with the stresses of every day life, and this may be your body's way. Don't stress over it, it's most likely nothing. :]

It's the muscle that moves your head from side to side. You probably slept on it wrong & it will take time to heal. The worst thing to do is to try & stretch a muscle when it hurts, but that's what we usually tend to do. I can not prescribe traetment, but if it was me, I would use an ice pack, it will help it heal faster, 10 minutes on each side, then let the area warm back up to normal body temp, then apply ice pack again. I'd do this several times a day for a couple of days. Heat is always the worst thing for a strained muscle, it is only good for tight muscles.|`|6gmLk9jHaa	my neck was starting to hurt on the back.

Y32zA5Mfaa	If it is occurring only when you are hungry (or a couple hours after you have eaten) and goes away after you eat, then yes the doctor will take you seriously (doctors should always take your concerns seriously!  If they don't, then they are not a good doctor).  From the description you have given (including where it hurts), it could be a duodenal ulcer (the duodenum is the part of the small intestine that is right after the stomach).  Your stomach closes the sphincter between the two after you eat, in order to digest the food.  It re-opens a while later to pass the digested food onward in its journey.  When the digested food/stomach acid hits the duodenal ulcer, it will cause pain/nausea etc.      This may not be what you have, but the doctor will still take you seriously with symptoms like these.  Ulcers need to be cared for, because if they bleed, it can cause complications.    Also, if the pain is in your stomach area (high up, like directly under your ribs), then they probably won't do a colonoscopy.  Perhaps they might look from your mouth down, though.   And if you do end up needing a colonoscopy, they are not too bad.  Both my mom and I have had one, and we agree that the worst part is the laxatives you take to clear out the colon beforehand.  :)    **MAKE SURE YOU TELL YOUR DOCTOR EVERYTHING YOU HAVE MENTIONED HERE!  With all of your information, especially location of pain and the fact that it subsides when you eat and gets worse when you are getting hungry, it will be easier for your doctor to make a proper diagnosis.    So, definitely go to the doctor.  Even if it turns out to be a bug, symptoms like those lasting this long should be checked out by a doctor.|`|EQydFhzmaa	Any self-respecting, good doctor would not make fun of you, turn you away, or call it gas; if they do - get yourself a new doctor. When you say: "no good bacteria left", I believe that to be false. First of all, the are antibodies and white blood cells that protect your body, and secondly, I think that would be almost impossible to loose all of them - unless you underwent serious medical treatment, like chemotherapy or something. As for the diagnosis, it may be IBS (Irritable Bowel Syndrome - which is a very generic diagnosis), "hunger pains", acid reflux, or in fact food poisoning, or something different all together. I would see a gastroenterologist.|`|wYTDwWnEaa	I get that ALL the time! I have no idea what it is. I'm guessing its just heartburn or hunger pains because my mom gets Acid Reflux.

bNA5BuKCaa	Go to a walk-in clinic and get BC pills. It may be a little wait but at least it will be worth it. You can take the pill right away and when you do, the body will think that it is pregnant. Don't do the morning after pill. Although it my prevent pregnancy AFTER,  you will be stressed to even risk it. Plus, I do not think that the Morning After Pill is going to prevent your period and depending on how long after you have had intercourse, the effects of the pill could change. I have tried the BC pill way twice and it worked both times. One more thing, if you have time to pick up the morning after pill, you should have time to pick up the Birth Control pill. Either way, they both have to be prescribed by a certified doctor. I would suggest the BC pill so that you don't worry about it throughout your entire trip.     I hope I have helped...

UZJ7wVc8aa	If you want to lose weight, you need to two things: eat less and exercise more. Weight gain happens when you create a calorie surplus (eat more than you burn). Your body takes the excess calories and converts them to fat which get stored around your stomach, arms and thighs. The longer you remain in a calorie surplus, the more weight you'll gain. To lose that weight, you need to do the opposite. You need to create a calorie deficit (start eating less than you burn).     Your first step is to figure out how many calories you burn on a daily basis. This calculator will help you out http://calorieneedscalculator.com The number you get from this tool is what your body burns on a daily basis. To lose weight, simply eat less. It sounds a lot easier than it is but making small changes helps you adjust to a new lifestyle. Don't think of this as a diet, think of it as a new life. Instead of eating foods high in sugars, white flour and saturated fat, go with fruits, vegetables, whole wheats, fish, lean meats, nuts and beans. In addition to eating less, you also need to exercise more. Start off at 1-2 times per week and work your way up to 3-5 times per week.    Don't make all of these changes at once or you won't be able to properly adjust to them. Generally, eating healthier foods will decrease your calorie intake. Compare a doughnut to an apple and you'll see that healthy foods are lower in calories. You can find some more information at the Beginner's Guide to Dieting - http://straightdiet.com|`|t92F9YwTaa	Do the bike exercise, the one where you lay on your back, stick your legs in the air, and pretend you are pedaling a bike. That was voted america's  1 abs exercise. It also helps out a little bit on your thighs.    Do squats next to your desk, and if your mom walks in, say that you were picking up a pencil or something. I don't know... But yes, Crunches work well, but I find them rather boring so I never do them. Umm... before you go to bed, lay on the floor, put your lower legs up on the bed(so that your thighs are going straight up), and lift up your abdomen withought your hands/arms. only use your legs and your stomach.    Use less sugar/splenda in your tea(congrats on drinking tea!!! I ? tea) drink plain whole milk instead of chocolate milk(unless you use Nesquik or something).   Dance around with music blaring   Go for a morning jog a few times a week.|`|vwoqIUR6aa	you are small. what you really have to watch is calories. if you have access to internet, you can find a free site where you count calories|`|Do3YeonMaa	DO NOT DO CRUNCHES,DO HIP HOP ABS!

The easiest way to restore the look you had before is to be sensible.  Be reasonable about what you eat, and especially what you drink.  You may be eating very little, but soda, fruit juice, iced tea, and chocolate milk are high-calorie drinks that can destroy any diet.  Try drinking water, and diet soda, and cut out all liquid calories.  (I did this once, and lost ten pounds in a month).  That said, be sure you're eating enough!  Starving your body puts it into survival mode, and your body will store every calorie if it isn't getting enough to work off of.    Be sure to exercise, too.  Even going for a 30-minute walk every day would help you lose weight quickly.  (And it's something you can do with a friend or parent, so it's also good for your well-being!).    Most of all, don't put yourself through stress over this.  Everyone gains weight, especially during puberty, and your body may just be readjusting to becoming a woman!  :)|`|kZOwhsgYaa	Honestly, you're still so young, within the next few years, your body's going to change dramatically!

b3f4f6798be929d658ec38c5b998d657aa	If you are a self-absorbed super model, you may have eaten too much. If you are a real person, you may not have eaten enough depending on your age, body size and activity. Don't make arbitrary diet plans. Eat enough to satisfy and that gives you the energy to do all of the activities that you do during the day.    So many people worry about eating too much. Just remember to eat until you are satisfied. Never continue eating after you are full; remembering to chew your food slowly as when you eat too fast that by the time your body tells you that you are full, you have eaten too much as well as not fully enjoying what you are eating.|`|6sPcYQr0aa	Seems alright to me but you might need a little more.  It doesnt really matter what you eat (besides the obvious junk food) and when you eat it, as long as it has the nutrients your body needs and you give it to your body when it needs it.  You cant forget protein, which is not only a main building block for your body but for your mind as well. I will explain.  One of the worst things you can do to your body is stop eating. Your body needs fuel just like your car needs fuel. And just like your car, the better the fuel and oil is, the better the cars performance, the better the food and liquid is that you put in your body with too make you "run" better.  If you are trying to lose fat. Try to raise your metabolism by eating smaller meals, more nutritious meals, and about five or six meals throughout the day.  Also, remember that if you are working out you are also building muscle, and muscle weighs more than fat does. So as you lose the fat and gain the muscle your weight might not adjust for a while until your muscle building reaches a plateau and your body begins to really tare away fat.  If you do not want to eat five or six small meals a day. Eat three meals a day, smaller portions, then between breakfast and lunch have a healthy snack or meal replacement shake, and another between lunch and dinner.  The idea is to teach your body to get rid of all extra fuel it doesnt need, which are fats, carbs, and simple sugars for the most part. And once your body begins to understand that you are giving it the fuel it needs when it needs it, then your body will no longer store fat cells as a fuel reserve.  It is also a good idea to use a body cleanser, or detoxify before beginning any change in diet. Especially if you are going to begin eating healthier. The process might cause head aches or muscle cramps depending on what your body has become used to. Also diarrhea is a common side effect of most cleansing programs, but dont worry this is a sign that your body is getting rid of the toxic substances. The cleans will help your body to easily extract the nutrients it needs from the food you intake and bypass the rest as waste.  To expedite the process it always helps to concentrate on full body workouts to keep energy storage empty. Also, drink water, water is used to clean your body inside and out. Stay away from caffeine and soda.  This will take time. But once you are able to achieve routine with your eating habits it is one of the easiest ways to keep the fat off.  So with this, your diet can be very flexible as well. You can have sweets and things but for best results I would stay away from all simple sugars, like candy.  Good luck and God bless.|`|6sAbs2iiaa	I also eat a lot just be carefull to not eat after 9;00 pm cause that's when you accumulate fat.|`|0dd9ce8bc5332fb84c503aa81dea46fcaa	All of that stuff is healthy.

If you are myopic you should use your glasses for distance and remove them for near work to eliminate eyestrain.

Myopia is just one of those things that gets on a roll- I have 40yr old patients who are still getting more myopic (though at a slower rate that when they were in their teens..)    It's like asking 'how long is a piece of string?'. It's impossible to say. However on AVERAGE most people slow down or stop towards mid to late 20's, in my experience. Some are still going at 40 as I said, some are stable by 18. But you just can't predict.    The best way to help yourself it to take regular breaks from near work such as reading and computer use, even if it's just to make a cup of coffee or just look out the window for 5 minutes- this will remind your eyes that the world isn't 30cm in front of your face...

AA12158031	hi, you dont need a diet. to lose weight, just eat less and healtily and excercise. Dont try diets, as they dont contain all the vitamins and minerals you need, so they could hurt you. Also, diet lasts only for a short period of time. When you lose weight, you start eating as you did before. You need to change your lifestyle and keep it during your whole life! If you wont, youll gain weight again, thats for sure! Ive tried both diets and rational eating and excercise, so i know what am i talking about.   Dont eat low-fat food, it contains lot of harmful chemicals and because of lack of fats your body is not able to use vitamis it contains. (some vitamins must dissolve in fat in order to "do their job". If there is no fat, your body cant use them!)  Eat lot of vegetables, fruit and drink non-low-fat milk, eat as few sweets as possible (you dont have to exclude them completely, because it may happen that after a long time you havent eaten them, youll buy "tons" of them and eat them at once! This is not very healthy :-) Eat 2-3 small sweets per week and know that its no "sin" :-) However, the most important part is excercise! You cant expect to lose weight if you dont move. You dont have to do any special things, just forget about your car if possible- walk or use bicycle instead, dont use elevator- walk, at least 2-5 stages, dance and swim.   I wish you good luck and strong will. Im sure youll be happy, healthy and feeling great soon!|`|671e0057cfa29cad4ad58833c596c36aaa	Just eat less and excersice more.

b845752fe1a81266746c1f68e850090baa	I use three methods, because it drives me nuts. First, with my head tilted to one side, I slip the meaty portion of the palm of my hand tightly against my ear until it is sealed against the ear canal.Then I slide and pull my hand away in a manner to create a small vacuum. That usually pulls the water out.    Phase two, I use a cotton swab. Not the fuzzy round guy, the pointy ones used for make-up application. Then I CAREFULLY  twist this into the ear canal, drying it out. (be careful not to force wax back into the ear canal)    Phase three, for major jobs, I use an infant's nose mucus extractor, which has a bulb that is compressed to form a vacuum. You have to be VERY careful with this to avoid poking your ear canal, or worse, the eardrum.    Afterwards, I always swab my ears with hydrogen peroxide (3% solution) to insure a sterile environment.    Some may say that I am a barbarian, but my ears are free of wax, water and infection at all times.|`|34e9088a5d29796dae0fd4777890ef8baa	Just do nothing...It will eventually flow out...even not from your ear, it will flow out from somewhere else.|`|e15884f7a6818e281d7742a642f0ca39aa	couple drops of rubbing alcohol  that all swimmers ear meds are|`|14c1f4480afd8ff32def8db02f554b88aa	Lean your head to the side that the water is in and eventually it will roll out.|`|1ec80cbeea415336667cde17e43c37adaa	lean your head to the side and jump|`|e74eaaa5778edb14f29610b39900f70eaa	Ask your pharmicist.

Consider a healthy lifestyle change.    The following healthy living recommendations will help you if youre trying to lose weight, tone up your muscles, have aspirations of building lean muscle mass, are attempting to get a wash board stomach, or just want to feel better:    *1) Burn more calories then you're consuming everyday and measure your results using the following formula: Calories Consumed minus Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) minus Physical Activity minus the Thermic Effect of Food (TEF). A website that explains this formula in more detail and will help you determine how many calories you need to reach or maintain a certain weight is at http://www.primusweb.com/fitnesspartner/...    Get an online, desktop, or cell phone diet and fitness calculator. This will allow you to easily calculate the above formula, set goals, log your daily calorie consumption, and register your physical activities.     Set realistic goals for your ideal body weight. Here are two websites that will calculate a suggested body weight:          Adults: http://www.halls.md/ideal-weight/body.ht...  Teens/Children: http://www.kidshealth.org/kid/exercise/w...    It is difficult and unhealthy to lose more than one or two pounds per week. There are 3,500 calories in a pound. If you eat 500 fewer calories per day for a week you will lose one pound. If you burn through exercise 500 more calories per day for a week you will lose one pound.     Here are two articles on how to break through a weight loss plateau:  http://www.webmd.com/content/article/86/...  http://www.webmd.com/content/pages/18/10...    *2) Eat natural and organic foods found on earth versus something created by a corporation to make money. Eat meals in small portions throughout the day and take a good multi-vitamin supplement.     Do not try fad diets or diet pills. Avoid High Glycemic Load Carbs (sugar, pastries, desserts, refined starches such as breads, pasta, refined grains like white rice; high starch vegetables such as potatoes) and drink lots of water. Read this article for more information on high GL Carbs:  http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsou...

We all hit plateaus.  If you are exercising, increase your intensity.  If you have changed your eating habits, add more veggies.    Diet pills do not work.  And YOU don't need them.  You are about a size 10 and that's a good size.|`|e40bc97966e4391c4a321bba59972cf9aa	no|`|AA11331337	Diet pills are not the way to go.  Not worth it, especially since you obviously are on the right track already with food and activity.    Plateaux are common in normal weight loss.  What happens is that as you lose weight, you need less energy to sustain your body, and less energy to move yourself around.  So, what worked when you were 190 pounds won't work so well at 170.  Cut a little more food, exercise a little more intensively, and that mayl do the trick.      Sometimes, all you need to do to get off the plateau is to mix it up a bit.  Been eating the same old low-cal foods for 3 months?  Buy something different, try a low-cal cookbook (I really like "Looneyspoons"!)  Try a new activity.  Been walking each day?  Try swimming instead!  Your body welcomes the change, and may get back into gear.    Another possibility is that you may have been eating too little.  Your metabolism might be slowed down to a point where it is not burning the food as fast as it could.  If you eat 200-400 calories less that what you need to burn in a day, weight loss will be maximized.  Too many diets get you eating 600 or more less than what your body needs, so the fat-burning process slows down, as the body is going into "prepare for starvation" mode.

One cannot fully comprehend what is going on inside (emotions, anxiety, thinking...), and outside (atmosphere, the partner, distractions).    however, one must bear in mind that imitation is not real - you are just fooling yourself if you dwell on it too much. accept the fact that you exist on the real world, and you must adapt to it.|`|3a4001349b7b5cc03df59bf4f8b34767aa	I have dealt with wanting to stop masturbating, simply because i felt it was a sin adn thats not healthy.

Actually i read in an artical that it has no effects on the "normal" human, no it doesnt make you bad. Sometime alot of guys have this confusion that by masturabting early it makes their penis larger later when the get oldeer, but thats actually not true, well atleast tahts what the article said. Anyways If its addition, meaning it bothers your eveyday life becaseu you need it or you cant stop, for exaple your at work you have a meeting to get to but you really need ot masturbate well if your addicted you would probably go to the rest rom and masturbate even though you know showing up to this meeting is very important. Ask yoursefl if that is something you would do? Of course tone it done a little. My senerio would apply to the very addicted. I would say stop Masturbating but just try and fight your urges. Like slowly tone it down, something realistic like first 1 time every day, the the next time 6 times and ect. Of coarse adjust it to the level of addiction like if you have to masturbate 5 times a day then go down to 4 then 3 then lower and lower also dont do teh lowering everyday. You dont have to stop watching porn just do the same thing.

There is a gene that  causes thinning of hair.  Until scientist find out  how to reverse, or turn off that gene, there is no permanent way to get hair to regenerate permanently.

Das zweite, die Menge und Leistung der Geschmacksknospen und Geruchsaufnehmenden Knospen in Mund und Nase ist genetisch vorbestimmt.  Das Riechen lernen wste ich nicht ob das irgend wo unterrichtet wird. Zu mindest ist es kein Lehrberuf.  Ist aber bei der Ausbildung zum Lebensmittelprfer zum Beispiel in Teilen mit enthalten.  Du kannst nur eines machen um feinere Gerche besser war zu nehmen:  Vermeiden in Bereichen von Extremgerchen zu arbeiten oder auch zu stehen.  Beispielsweise wirst du nie erleben das der Aromaprfer in die Mischanlage fr die industrielle Produktion geht. Grund dafr ist das dort die Belastung fr das Organ das er zur Arbeit ben?tigt viel zu belastet wrde so das er eventuell einen oder mehrere Tage nicht mer fein genug riechen k?nnte fr seine Arbeit.   Die sinnvolle Schulung ist das Vermeiden von berlastung.  Bei Aromatestern oder Perfum- Dyseignern und ?hnlichen Berufsgruppen wirst du auch feststellen das sie kein oder zu mindest kein aufdringliches Parfume verwenden.   Rauchen ist auch etwas was die Geruchsleistung mindert.   Anders ausgedrckt, das schulen der Nase und der Geschmackszellen beginnt mit dem vermeiden von berlastung.  Erst wenn die weck ist lohnt es sich sich ran zu machen und einzeln bestimmte Greuchsstoffe zu Testen, im geswissen sinne seinen Geruchssin zu schulen. Aber auch da, Feinstmengen.  Zum schulen warscheinlich so gering das du den Duft gerade so wahrnimmst, sprich fast nicht identifizieren kannst.  Gru? Mathias

e56f4af0392a97bead7ec4a8be859bbaaa	Pap smear: Screening test for cervical cancer  Understand the importance of the Pap smear, including how it's done, what it means when it's abnormal and why it needs to be part of your regular health checkups.    A Pap smear, also called a Pap test, is a simple procedure that collects cells from your cervix  the lower, narrow end of your uterus. Named after its developer, George Papanicolaou, M.D., the test effectively detects not only cervical cancer, but also changes in your cervical cells that suggest cancer may develop in the future. Detecting these cells early is your first step in halting the possible development of cervical cancer.    Since women started having Pap smears more than 50 years ago, the number of deaths from cervical cancer has dropped dramatically. What was once the leading cause of cancer death for women in the United States now ranks as No. 15. According to the American Cancer Society, about 3,700 women die each year of cervical cancer  a figure that could drop even further if more women had the Pap smear on a regular basis.    If you get regular Pap smears, you substantially decrease your chances of getting cervical cancer. But even if you develop cervical cancer, the chances of a cure are as high as 90 percent  if discovered early. The Pap smear is the best tool to detect cervical cancer in its earliest stage.  Who should have a Pap smear?    The American Cancer Society recommends that you have your first Pap smear about three years after first having sexual relations or at age 21. After age 21, the guidelines are as follows:  Age Frequency  21 to 29 Once a year using the regular Pap smear or every two years using the liquid-based Pap test.  30 to 69 Every two to three years if you've had three normal Pap smears in a row.  70 and older You may stop having Pap smears if you've had normal results three tests in a row and you've had normal Pap smears over the past 10 years.    Regardless of your age, if you have certain risk factors you'll need to be screened annually. These risk factors include:        * A history of sexual activity as a teenager, especially if you had more than one sex partner      * Multiple sex partners now      * A partner who began sexual activity at an early age or who had many previous sexual partners      * A history of a sexually transmitted disease      * A family history of cervical cancer      * A diagnosis of cervical cancer or a Pap smear that showed precancerous cells      * Infection with human papillomavirus (HPV)      * Tobacco use      * Exposure to diethylstilbestrol (DES) before birth      * HIV infection      * Weakened immune system due to such factors as an organ transplant, chemotherapy or chronic corticosteroid use    If you've had a total hysterectomy  surgical removal of the uterus including the cervix  ask your doctor if you need to continue having Pap smears. If your hysterectomy was performed for a noncancerous condition, such as fibroids, you may be able to discontinue routine Pap smears. If your hysterectomy was for a precancerous or cancerous condition, your vaginal canal still should be checked for abnormal changes.  Preparing for a Pap smear    To ensure that your Pap smear is most effective, follow these tips prior to your test:        * Avoid intercourse, douching or using any vaginal medicines or spermicidal foams, creams or jellies for two days before having a Pap smear, as these may wash away or obscure abnormal cells.      * Try not to schedule a Pap smear during your menstrual period. Although the test can be done, it's best to avoid this particular time of your cycle.    How is a Pap smear done?  A Pap smear is performed in your doctor's office and takes only a few minutes. First you lie down on an exam table with your knees bent. Your heels rest in supports called stirrups. Your doctor will gently insert an instrument called a speculum into your vagina. Then he or she will take a sample of your cervical cells and smear them onto a glass slide for microscopic examination.    Your doctor will send the slide to a laboratory, where a cytotechnologist  a person trained to detect abnormal cells  will examine the sample. These technicians work in cooperation with a pathologist  a doctor who specializes in cellular abnormalities. The pathologist is responsible for the final diagnosis.    A newer approach uses a liquid to transfer the sample of cells to the laboratory. Your doctor collects the cells in exactly the same way, but then he or she rinses the instruments in a special liquid, which preserves the cells for examination later. When this sample reaches the laboratory, a technician prepares a microscopic slide that's cleaner and more easily interpreted than slides prepared in the traditional method.    Usually your doctor performs a Pap smear during a pelvic examination  a simple procedure that allows your doctor to examine your external genitals, uterus, ovaries, other reproductive organs and rectum. Although pelvic examinations can screen for reproductive problems or abnormalities, only a Pap smear will detect early cervical cancer or precancers.  Your test results    The Pap smear doesn't diagnose a disease but instead acts as a screening test to alert your doctor to check further. The words used to describe abnormal cells are carefully chosen to send specific messages to your doctor about risk.    Here are some terms your doctor might use and what your next course of action might be:        * Normal. Your test is negative  no abnormal cells are detected. You won't need any further treatment or testing until you're due for your next Pap smear and pelvic exam.      * Atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance. Squamous cells are thin and flat and grow on the surface of|`|603178cdfd806fea6b556b47b7e84a7caa	you might need to go in and actually see a obgyn|`|d03f13720474327a964d136e0f9f2381aa	i dont know what they can do for you online, you need to get yourself to a doctor and let them examine you. they will know for sure. sometimes you may be pregnant and not show signs, sometimes you might not be pregnant and have false positive signs related to stress & hormones. if you want to be absolutely sure, go see a doctor in real life.|`|32fb94506f192b6388a4929263e499d0aa	im not a gyno but i am a hypochondriac who has been to one enough times to maybe help you out......
bedc8bb5be7e500ab26272f96a6d7ae6aa	Have you had this tenderness only around your period or all month?  Most women have tenderness before and during their periods.  Is the tenderness in both breasts?  Bilateral breast cancer or a bilateral infection is extremely rare.  Have you recently started a weight training program or increased the weights you have been using?  This could be muscle pain.  If the tenderness is in only one breast and is not associated with your periods, that may be a symptom of inflammatory breast cancer.  This type of breast cancer is extremely rare, but also difficult to diagnose.  At any rate, since this is obviously not normal for you and it is causing you concern, you really might want to make an appointment with your GYN.  They know a lot about breast issues and can refer you to the right specialist if need be.  Good luck!|`|AA11311441	As far as I know, breast tenderness/pain is not a common sign of breast cancer.  I'm not sure how old you are or what your menstruation history is, but oftentimes, breast tenderness is something some women might experience a few days/weeks prior to getting their period - I believe this is referred to as Fibrocystic Disease.  So if you notice that the tenderness comes and goes in relation to your period - this isn't breast cancer.  Pregnancy may sometimes cause breast tenderness as well.  As far as breast cancer, I think some common signs are...you feel a lump where you never used to feel one before, skin dimpling on the breast, pink/bloody discharge from nipple, nipple retraction.  It's very rare to have breast pain as an initial sign of breast cancer.  As always though, see your doc to get a full evaluation and some questions answered.|`|3efd39fa8759fec3a1c0e98dcdf8457daa	lumps under the arm pit or on the breast look up some self breast examination that will help|`|3bf402955c1d2a2cb03bdace6499ffbfaa	go to the web site below & read up on the factual information, follow their tips & do a self-exam, then make an appointment to get a test. you should do this no matter what!!!    sometimes your breasts can be sore because they are growing & due to other hormonal changes. sometimes people develop cysts &  other such problems that have similar symptoms. i'm not a doctor, but i do suggest that if you have concerns that you should just make an appointment & get a mamogram so you can sleep better at night.

The conversation did not involve me personally but I did learn a few things that may help you.    There are people receiving disability benefits who do have Fibromyalgia and Chronic Fatigue Syndrome.  My understanding is the monthly benefit is around 900 dollars and you were also allowed to work a few hours each week for additional income.    You would start off my going to your local government offices - Ministry of Social Services and then they would tell you what to do from there.  Obviously you would have to fill out a bunch of forms and your doctor would have to verify your condition.    I kinda got the idea from the conversations that it would take about 6 weeks in total from the start of the process until you would receive benefits.  Of course every situation is different.    Good Luck    gogglesgreen

15e5786baaf7d40b1fc6955511fbaa1caa	INTRODUCTION  AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome) was first reported in the United States in 1981 and has since become a major worldwide epidemic. AIDS is caused by HIV (human immunodeficiency virus). By killing or damaging cells of the body's immune system, HIV progressively destroys the body's ability to fight infections and certain cancers. People diagnosed with AIDS may get life-threatening diseases called opportunistic infections, which are caused by microbes such as viruses or bacteria that usually do not make healthy people sick.   More than 900,000 cases of AIDS have been reported in the United States since 1981. As many as 950,000 Americans may be infected with HIV, one-quarter of whom are unaware of their infection. The epidemic is growing most rapidly among minority populations and is a leading killer of African-American males ages 25 to 44. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), AIDS affects nearly seven times more African Americans and three times more Hispanics than whites. In recent years, an increasing number of African-American women and children are being affected by HIV/AIDS. In 2003, two-thirds of U.S. AIDS cases in both women and children were among African-Americans.    TRANSMISSION  HIV is spread most commonly by having unprotected sex with an infected partner. The virus can enter the body through the lining of the vagina, vulva, penis, rectum, or mouth during sex.   Risky behavior    HIV can infect anyone who practices risky behaviors such as    Sharing drug needles or syringes   Having sexual contact, including oral, with an infected person without using a condom   Having sexual contact with someone whose HIV status is unknown   Infected blood    HIV also is spread through contact with infected blood. Before donated blood was screened for evidence of HIV infection and before heat-treating techniques to destroy HIV in blood products were introduced, HIV was transmitted through transfusions of contaminated blood or blood components. Today, because of blood screening and heat treatment, the risk of getting HIV from such transfusions is extremely small.    Contaminated needles    HIV is frequently spread among injection drug users by the sharing of needles or syringes contaminated with very small quantities of blood from someone infected with the virus.    It is rare, however, for a patient to give HIV to a health care worker or vice-versa by accidental sticks with contaminated needles or other medical instruments.    Mother to child    Women can transmit HIV to their babies during pregnancy or birth. Approximately one-quarter to one-third of all untreated pregnant women infected with HIV will pass the infection to their babies. HIV also can be spread to babies through the breast milk of mothers infected with the virus. If the mother takes certain drugs during pregnancy, she can significantly reduce the chances that her baby will get infected with HIV. If health care providers treat HIV-infected pregnant women and deliver their babies by cesarean section, the chances of the baby being infected can be reduced to a rate of 1 percent. HIV infection of newborns has been almost eradicated in the United States due to appropriate treatment.    A study sponsored by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) in Uganda found a highly effective and safe drug for preventing transmission of HIV from an infected mother to her newborn. Independent studies have also confirmed this finding. This regimen is more affordable and practical than any other examined to date. Results from the study show that a single oral dose of the antiretroviral drug nevirapine (NVP) given to an HIV-infected woman in labor and another to her baby within 3 days of birth reduces the transmission rate of HIV by half compared with a similar short course of AZT (Azidothymidine). For more information on preventing transmission from mother to child, go to http://aidsinfo.nih.gov/guidelines.    Saliva    Although researchers have found HIV in the saliva of infected people, there is no evidence that the virus is spread by contact with saliva. Laboratory studies reveal that saliva has natural properties that limit the power of HIV to infect, and the amount of virus in saliva appears to be very low. Research studies of people infected with HIV have found no evidence that the virus is spread to others through saliva by kissing. The lining of the mouth, however, can be infected by HIV, and instances of HIV transmission through oral intercourse have been reported.    Scientists have found no evidence that HIV is spread through sweat, tears, urine, or feces.    Casual contact    Studies of families of HIV-infected people have shown clearly that HIV is not spread through casual contact such as the sharing of food utensils, towels and bedding, swimming pools, telephones, or toilet seats.     HIV is not spread by biting insects such as mosquitoes or bedbugs.    Sexually transmitted infections    If you have a sexually transmitted infection (STI) such as syphilis, genital herpes, chlamydial infection, gonorrhea, or bacterial vaginosis appears, you may be more susceptible to getting HIV infection during sex with infected partners.    EARLY SYMPTOMS OF HIV INFECTION  If you are like many people, you will not have any symptoms when you first become infected with HIV. You may, however, have a flu-like illness within a month or two after exposure to the virus. This illness may include   Fever   Headache   Tiredness   Enlarged lymph nodes (glands of the immune system easily felt in the neck and groin)   These symptoms usually disappear within a week to a month and are often mistaken for those of another viral |`|9db09958436c7b40d03884884294b2c0aa	ur immune system shuts down and any cold or virus u get can kill u.U will have no white blood cells to fight infections.|`|4b037dc02241c3257854fdeb49ddbbd4aa	a disease that weakens your immune system. remember:it isn't AIDS that kills you, its common diseases (cold,etc.)that kills you.|`|AA11309242	Death|`|2f2208c22d249492fbe4b11f4aced1e4aa	it stands for "Acquired Immunity Deficiency Syndrome" it weakens your immune system so that any small disease you acquire can be fatal,it is presently one of the leading causes of death in the world.|`|fa7013a55715c48bd23f4f8a08dc0d7daa	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AIDS

The difference is that diseases are something that is caused by an outside effect such as bacteria or virus. Disorders are a result of something gone awry with the neurological system and can't be caught by another person. There have been some links to Autism and immune system difficiencies, but they have not been researched enough to conclude that Autism is a result of immune system problems. The problem with Autism is that it's cause is unknown, though experts have concluded that it is most definitely genetic. The underlying cause remains unknown at this time. It is classified as a neurological disorder and research shows that the brain of Autistic person is not wired the same as the brain of a neurotypical(non autistic )person, and the brains of the two work differently in certain ares of the brain.|`|AA10512500	no

3ef51330186f522835d3d64d62a553d6aa	O AZEITE DE OLIVA E A SADE                As gorduras representam 33% do total da energia ingerida diariamente. Para uma alimenta??o saudvel, seria essencial substituir o consumo de gorduras saturadas por monoinsaturadas, como  o caso do azeite - chave para uma sade melhor.                As ltimas novidades nutricionais coincidem em assinalar que o uso de azeite de oliva reduz o colesterol e ajuda a prevenir as doen?as cardiovasculares.

O AZEITE DE OLIVA E A PELE                A oliveira e o azeite de seu fruto tm sido parte da cultura mediterranea desde suas origens. Alm de ser utilizado na alimenta??o, servia como remdio e produto de beleza, entre outros. H cinco mil anos, as mulheres egpcias descobriram os efeitos benficos do azeite de oliva para sua pele e passaram a utiliz-lo como emoliente. A partir de ent?o, criaram o primeiro sabonete, misturando azeite, essncias e cinzas. Os gregos o utilizavam para massagens, confiando em seu poder para aumentar a beleza e a virilidade.

Quando se fala de azeite, vem  nossa mente a idia de uma dieta mediterranica, saudvel, que inclui feij?es, azeite e vinho tinto.    De acordo com os especialistas da Universidade de S?o Paulo, "Ao estudar os hbitos alimentares das diferentes popula??es, a comunidade mdica internacional verificou que a alimenta??o rica em azeite dos pases costeiros do Mediterraneo podia explicar os nveis reduzidos de colesterol no sangue e uma baixa incidncia de doen?as cardiovasculares dos povos mediterranicos, em compara??o com os habitantes da Amrica do Norte e Europa Central".    Infelizmente, com a invas?o da fast food e a aquisi??o de hbitos alimentares diferentes, assim como o aumento do poder de compra, come?amos a abrir m?o das hortali?as e as leguminosas e a colocar no prato maiores quantidades de carne vermelha e doces. O que se recomenda  que use o azeite para temperar as refei??es e abuse das saladas e legumes para se ter uma alimenta??o saudvel.|`|7d272d44aa7e98caab4a0a1f4a08610faa	[editar] Dicas de consumo  Uso culinrio do azeite por acidez   Tipo Acidez Utiliza??o   Extra Virgem   Virgem fino 1,5% Saladas e molhos   Semifino 3,0% Saladas e frituras   Refinado >3,0% Frituras de imers?o   Puro >2,0% Frituras, assados e marinados   Ao consumir o produto,  aconselhavel que se verifique sua acidez e data de validade. Normalmente o azeite deve ser consumido em 12 meses. Antigamente era possivel encontrar no comrcio azeites de primeira e de segunda prensagem mas atualmente o processo  nico e o azeite  prensado uma nica vez a frio ou pela varia??o de press?o e temperatura.     muito mais comum encontrar os azeites extra-virgens engarrafados sendo aconselhavel que se procure azeites engarrafados em embalagens mais escuras, j que a incidencia de luz cataliza a oxida??o do produto. J aos leos de oliva  muito mais comum que sejam comercializados em lata. Para estes, o ponto de solda da lata pode em algumas vezes oxidar o produto. Ao estoca-lo, leve em conta que a luz, o calor e o ar s?o altamente prejudiciais ao produto, que deve ser armazenado em locais frescos, com pouca ou nenhuma incidncia de luz. Pode-se evitar a a??o da luz ao se embrulhar o azeite com pano ou guardanapo. Apesar de comumente usados os bicos dosadores tambm podem facilitar a oxida??o e devem ser evitados.  aconselhavel que se consuma o azeite o mais rpido possvel aps sua abertura, e portanto  melhor que se armazene-o em embalagens menores, que sejam consumidas t?o logo sejam abertas.    A cor do azeite algumas vezes pode indicar nuances em seu sabor. Normalmente os azeites mais verdes tem aromas e sabores mais frutados. Quando degustado, normalmente s?o utilizados frascos pequenos e de tamanho especfico, de cor azul cobalto que evitam que o profissional seja influenciado pela cor do lquido. Antes de degustado o copinho  aquecido por alguns segundos na palma da m?o, de modo a provocar a liberta??o do aroma do sumo. O degustador em seguida absorve um pouco do lquido da mesma forma que faz uma degustador de vinho, puxando-o atravz do ar e espalhando-o com a lingua por toda a boca para que se possa sentir o sabor.    O aroma do azeite n?o deve indicar a presen?a de defeitos como ran?o ou mofo. O seu gosto deve ser frutado e pode conter outros aromas como o de ervas, plantas ou pasta de azeitona, pode ainda conter alguns tra?os importantes, tais como gosto amargo ou levemente picante, indicando a presen?a de polifenis. Elementos como sabor metlico, avinagrados ou acidez perceptivel s?o fatores negativos ao paladar e indicam um azeite de baixa qualidade.    Normalmente, os azeites mais leves e doces s?o mais prprios a serem usados em saladas, legumes e carnes brancas.

A data foi escolhida para homenagear o nascimento de  Frederick Banting, que em parceria com Charles Best, foram os responsveis pelo descobrimento da insulina em 1921. Existem uma enorme popula??o que tem diabetes e tem pouca sintomatologia, por isso a doen?a passa despercebida. Alm da medica??o o tratamento nutricional dos pacientes com diabetes deve ser individualizado, respeitando seus hbitos, preferncias nutricionais, perfil metablico, tipo de medicamento utilizado, peso corporal e estilo de vida. A esse paciente deve ser dado o direito de entender como conduzir sua dieta e a possibilidade de ser feliz, convivendo com o diabetes. Quanto mais cedo for feito o diagnstico, mais precocemente o paciente poder estar livre de complica??es cr?nicas como o infarto, o derrame  cerebral, as les?es de retina e a insuficincia renal. Quando o endocrinologista ou a nutricionista recomenda a ingest?o de protenas em 15-20% do valor calrico total, n?o est fazendo nada de diferente em rela??o  prescri??o de dietas para pessoas sem diabetes. O maior tabu na dieta dos diabticos j caiu por terra h muito tempo: o de que eles n?o podem comer carboidratos. Eles podem, inclusive, comer os temidos a?cares simples, como a glicose, a frutose e at a sacarose, com modera??o e sob orienta??o. A primeira preocupa??o da dieta do diabtico  o valor calrico. Se ele tem peso normal, as calorias ser?o calculadas no sentido de manter o peso, ou seja, em mdia 1800 calorias para uma mulher jovem, e 2500 para um homem jovem. Esse clculo  varivel, na dependncia do paciente praticar ou n?o exerccios fsicos. Se o paciente tem sobrepeso ou obesidade, o mdico ou a nutricionista, geralmente, calcula um dficit calrico de cerca de 500-700 calorias. De acordo com a maioria das associa??es mundiais de diabetes a dieta recomendada deve ter cerca de 50-60% de carboidratos, 15-20% de protenas e o restante em gordura. Na orienta??o nutricional para esse paciente devem prever 3 refei??es e 2-3 lanches. Esses lanches tambm podem ser negociados com o paciente. Uma vez que dependem de sua fome, preferncias e disponibilidade. As frutas, muitas vezes, s?o uma armadilha para a dieta dos diabticos.  comum o paciente classific-las como alimentos muito saudveis, que podem ser ingeridos  vontade.  O consumo do lcool n?o precisa ser abolido do cotidiano do paciente com diabetes compensado. Doses seguras s?o de at duas doses dirias para o  homem, e at uma dose para mulher, o que representa uma mdia de 15-30g de lcool.  importante lembrar que eles nunca devem ingerir lcool sem comer, devido ao risco da hipoglicemia e que o lcool fornece cerca de 7 calorias por grama consumida. Os doces n?o devem ser abolidos de seus cardpios, a menos que o paciente esteja descompensado ou obeso, bem como no caso dos n?o diabticos. O diabetes gestacional  a altera??o das taxas de a?car no sangue que aparece ou  detectada pela primeira vez durante a gravidez. A doen?a pode persistir, ou desaparecer depois do parto. Os alimentos diet e light, s?o uma alternativa para variar a alimenta??o. Diet s?o alimentos produzidos para atender s necessidades especficas de indivduos. Para o portador de diabetes, o alimento diettico n?o deve conter a?car. Lights s?o alimentos modificados que devem ter uma redu??o de no mnimo 25% de alguns de seus componentes, comparados ao produto convencional como a?car, gordura, protenas e sdio (sal). H.King e colaboradores, do Centro Europeu de Estudos da Diabete, Fran?a realizaram em 2246 pessoas adultas, escolhidas ao acaso com 25 anos, ou mais exames para detectar a diabetes. Metade da popula??o vivia na cidade e metade na zona rural. Encontraram 5% das pessoas na cidade, e 11% no campo com diabetes que as pessoas nem sabiam. Quando foi feito um teste de tolerancia a glicose (exame mais apurado) a prevalncia foi de 10% na cidade e 15% no campo|`|68d1b15479b779dcd0e63a1babd54bc3aa	...

807896964b6a149310aa786e3a57e292aa	Hoje, aps muitas discuss?es, muitos livros e reportagens, a dieta da protena vem sendo seguida por muitas pessoas que visam o emagrecimento, o bem estar e em resumo a sade. Mas ser mesmo que nesta dieta das protenas o que se est visando  a sade do indivduo?    A dieta hiperprotica e hiperlipdica (muita protena e muita gordura), surgiu nos anos 70 pelo cardiologista Robert Atkins que prega que o que faz as pessoas engordarem s?o os carboidratos (arroz, p?es, massas, etc) e n?o as gorduras e protenas. A dieta do Dr. Atkins visa o emagrecimento por via destes dois macronutrientes, com ingest?o de apenas 40g por dia de carboidratos.    O que todo mundo j sabe  que muita gordura, e principalmente a saturada (presente nas carnes, frangos, laticnios, leo de coco, etc) provoca muitos males  sade como o aumento do LDL-colesterol, "colesterol ruim", que conseqentemente causa a aterosclerose (depsito destas molculas nas artrias ou veias causando um "entupimento" das mesmas). O que a maioria das pessoas n?o sabem,  que um aumento exagerado no consumo de protenas, levam estes nutrientes a se transformarem em gordura, e tambm causam um aumento de substancias txicas ao organismo (am?nia).    O crebro usa a energia dos carboidratos (glicose) para se alimentar e assim realizar suas fun??es, mas sem o consumo deles, o corpo promove uma srie de rea??es, onde o pancreas libera o horm?nio glucagon, para que este aja no tecido adiposo (na gordura depositada no organismo) e assim no fgado este tecido  transformado em glicose.    Analisando este quadro voc me pergunta: " Mas ent?o se eu fizer esta dieta eu vou emagrecer, pois vou estar queimando a gordura corporal, n?o  mesmo?" Sim,  verdade, voc ir perder peso. Mas, outro problema desta dieta  que quando isto ocorre (quando apenas a gordura  utilizada e quebrada para alimentar o crebro), surgem substancias chamadas de corpos cet?nicos no organismo e o indivduo entra em estado de "cetose". Isto , o indivduo elimina muito destes corpos cet?nicos pela urina (cetonria) e tambm pelo ar expirado o que causa um imenso mau hlito. Estas substancias quando encontradas em muita quantidade no organismo podem provocar intoxica??o. A falta de glicose no organismo, em casos bem avan?ados, pode levar a um coma (exemplo: diabticos).    O que vale a pena ressaltar tambm,  que a maioria das pessoas que fazem este tipo dieta, depois voltam a comer os carboidratos novamente, o que pode acarretar num ganho de peso se esta ingest?o n?o for controlada juntamente com os outros nutrientes.    Depois de tudo isto que coloquei aqui, ainda vale a pena se submeter a este tipo de dieta? O que vale  um regime alimentar correto, com todos os nutrientes: carboidratos, lipdeos e protenas. O que vale  uma vida SAUDVEL!!!|`|7d272d44aa7e98caab4a0a1f4a08610faa	D uma conferida no link  http://www.pesologica.com/dieta_proteina...|`|3aef8d21a27b6c48f9036544b61d7c5aaa	S carne!|`|50391e2572befe3df89fd54c4a85deaeaa	protena, u!!!!!!
c84eba3732dde2344b17c692c362d41eaa	i used to have pretty ripped abs (then stopped working out...)  here's what i did... i'm not sure how strong your core is right now, so depending on where you are starting from, you might have to make adjustments in sets/reps/resistance:    5 sets, 20-25 repetitions each: declined sit ups with 10-25 lb plates.  you lie on the declined bench (angle, about 30-45 degrees?) so your head is lower than your feet. Then you hold the weight parallel to your body at chest level. I would do 1 regular sit-up, then 1 sit up twisting to the left, followed by 1 sit-up twisting to the right and that would be one repetition. I would do this every day.    After a while, this will give you the muscle. But, you also have to tone to get the 'cut' look so you can SEE the muscle. You said you're skinny so this shouldn't be so hard. Cardio exercise is good for this. I highly recommend paddling - I did outrigger canoe paddling but not sure if that would be available in your area. Swimming is also good - especially butterfly stroke. If you're in snow country, I'm guessing snowboarding would do good too but I have to admit I've never tried it.    Definition on the lines of 6 packs takes time to build so be realistic with your expectations. It is absolutely possible, though, especially with your body type (sounds similar to mine) from what you say.

6e3468d8eea5f17ad50943086af2515faa	What I know is that it is a hereditary condition, with clusters of cysts forming on the kidneys. I believe that eventually most patients need dialysis and then a kidney transplant. Your best bet is to talk with a nephrologist.|`|1a34d86d5ba3aa989e504d8050c0abe8aa	http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/polycys...    http://www.pkdcure.org    http://familydoctor.org/142.xml|`|687c495a1ae52eb70cbb37ff130b3e4caa	Polycystic kidney disease (PKD) is a genetic disorder characterized by the growth of numerous cysts in the kidneys. The cysts are filled with fluid. PKD cysts can slowly replace much of the mass of the kidneys, reducing kidney function and leading to kidney failure.  The kidneys are two organs, each about the size of a fist, located in the upper part of a person's abdomen, toward the back. The kidneys filter wastes from the blood to form urine. They also regulate amounts of certain vital substances in the body.  How is autosomal recessive PKD diagnosed?  Ultrasound imaging of the fetus or newborn baby reveals cysts in the kidneys but does not distinguish between the cysts of autosomal recessive and autosomal dominant PKD. Ultrasound examination of kidneys of relatives can be helpful; for example, a parent or grandparent with autosomal dominant PKD cysts could help confirm diagnosis of autosomal dominant PKD in a fetus or child. (It is extremely rare, although not impossible, for a person with autosomal recessive PKD to become a parent.) Because autosomal recessive PKD tends to scar the liver, ultrasound imaging of the liver also aids in diagnosis.  How is autosomal recessive PKD treated?  Medicines can control high blood pressure in autosomal recessive PKD, and antibiotics can control urinary tract infections. Eating increased amounts of nutritious food improves growth in children with autosomal recessive PKD. In some cases, growth hormones are used. In response to kidney failure, autosomal recessive PKD patients must receive dialysis or transplantation (see End-stage renal disease).  Genetic Diseases  Genes are segments of DNA, the long molecules that reside in the nuclei of your body's cells. The genes, through complex processes, cause chemical activities that lead to growth and maintenance of the body. At conception, DNA (and therefore genes) from both parents are passed to the child.  A genetic disease occurs when one or both parents pass abnormal genes to a child at conception. If receiving an abnormal gene from just one parent is enough to produce a disease in the child, the disease is said to have dominant inheritance. If receiving abnormal genes from both parents is needed to produce disease in the child, the disease is said to be recessive.  The chance of acquiring a dominant disease (one gene copy is enough) is higher than the chance of acquiring a recessive disease (two gene copies are needed). A child who receives only one gene copy for a recessive disease at conception will not develop the genetic disease (such as autosomal recessive PKD), but could pass the gene to the following generation.  Acquired Cystic Kidney Disease  What is ACKD?  ACKD develops in kidneys with long-term damage and bad scarring, so it often is associated with dialysis and end-stage renal disease. About 90 percent of people on dialysis for 5 years develop ACKD. People with ACKD can have any underlying kidney disease, such as glomerulonephritis or kidney disease of diabetes.  The cysts of ACKD may bleed. Kidney tumors, including kidney (renal) cancer, can develop in people with ACKD. Renal cancer is rare yet occurs at least twice as often in ACKD patients as in the general population.  How is ACKD diagnosed?  Patients with ACKD usually seek help because they notice blood in their urine (hematuria). The cysts bleed into the urinary system, which discolors urine. Diagnosis is confirmed using ultrasound, CT scan, or MRI of the kidneys.  How is ACKD treated?  Most ACKD patients are already receiving treatment for kidney problems. In rare cases, surgery is used to stop bleeding of cysts and to remove tumors or suspected tumors.  Hope Through Research  Scientists have begun to identify the processes that trigger formation of PKD cysts. Advances in the field of genetics have increased our understanding of the abnormal genes responsible for autosomal dominant and autosomal recessive PKD. Scientists have located two genes associated with autosomal dominant PKD. The first was located in 1985 on chromosome 16 and labeled PKD1. PKD2 was localized to chromosome 4 in 1993. Within 3 years, the scientists had isolated the proteins these two genes producepolycystin-1 and polycystin-2.    When both of these genes are normal, the proteins they produce work together to foster normal kidney development and inhibit cyst formation. A mutation in either PKD1 or PKD2 can lead to cyst formation, but evidence suggests that the disease development also requires other factors, in addition to the mutation in one of the PKD genes.    Genetic analyses of most families with PKD confirm mutations in either the PKD1 or PKD2 gene. In rare cases, however, families with PKD have been found to have normal PKD1 and PKD2 genes. As a result, researchers theorize that a PKD3 gene exists, but that gene has not been mapped or identified.    Researchers recently identified the autosomal recessive PKD gene (called PKHD1) on chromosome 6. No genetic test kit is yet available to detect mutations in PKHD1.    Researchers have bred mice with a genetic disease that parallels both inherited forms of human PKD. Studying these mice will lead to greater understanding of the genetic and nongenetic mechanisms involved in cyst formation. In 2000, scientists reported that a cancer drug was successful in inhibiting cyst formation in mice with the PKD gene. In 2003, scientists also demonstrated that another compound, one that blocks function of a kidney receptor, inhibits cyst formation in mice with the ADPKD or ARPKD gene. The scientists hope that further testing will lead to safe and effective treatments for humans.  Points to Remember  The three types of PKD are      * two inherited forms:            o a common form that usually causes symptoms in midlife           o a rare form that usually causes symptoms in early childhood

You eat what's on your plate and wait 15 minutes before going back for more. It takes 15 minutes for your stomach to tell your brain that you're full. This way, you don't count calories, don't deprive yourself of foods that you like, and you can eat anything that you want.    Overeating is 95% mental and 5% the foods that you eat.

Nail polish remover/thinner is very harsh on the skin. You are probably suffering from a chemical burn right down.  Clean the area with 3% hydrogen peroxide. Put on a thin layer of hypo-allergenic cream on the affected skin. Check with the pharmacist when you purchase the cream. Make sure it is hypo-allergenic, fragrance and alcohol free.  Repeat the above procedure at least twice a day. Re-apply after a bath too.  Next time if you have to masturbate. Use a lubricant. The hypoallergenic cream you have left over is good.

However, I highly recommend that your husband not stop any medications without the direct advice of his doctor, or cardiologist.   If he stops suddenly it could be life threatening.    Good luck!|`|1c26a3dced3572ae68608024a821163daa	Web MD has good information on medication.    www.webmd.com  If your husband won't listen to you, call his doctor and have   him tell your husband what will happen if he stops taking his medicine.  Men are so stubborn.

For example, hours of dancing (that make you sweat a lot) a night, can easily make u lose 1 kg. I should know :) It is possible to lose 2kg in a week.    Do something that makes you sweat a lot (you will lose lots of liquid that way), but try to eat at least something light - no sense in not eating a thing, you might just pass out. Try salad without any sauce.|`|808b5224d4703f34ef348aaa491c1d64aa	Yea, but you'll just gain it all back when you stop fasting, and even more.
7eb52389b4c763f55ffc519cf533b690aa	There are actually mixed reports on this.  The original thought was that cracking your joints harms them and would therefore increase your likelihood of arthritis.  Recently a report came out (can't remember who did study) that showed people who crack their joints are actually less likely to get arthritis.  This study was not cause and effect though, so it could merely be that people who are able to crack their knuckles are less prone to arthritis for various other reasons.  Regardless, correlation or cause-n-effect, it sounds like you can crack away.

Don't worry about it, nothing will happen.|`|7bf7b03650cf42bc67d4cc402fb62d0eaa	Why do you ask?  Do you think your period is related to weight gain?  Not necessarily.  If you do in fact gain a little weight during your period, its most likely water retention that will reverse once your period is over.|`|AA10292176	I never gained weight when I got my periods. If you're talking about that "bloated" feeling talk about, yeah, it's just water retention. Some women feel bloated before or during their periods, and sometimes it's not every month. It's different for everyone. Your hormones get back on track at the end of your cycle so it does go away pretty quicly ;)    It's awkward isn't it? :) it'll get easier to deal with in time.|`|2d480ca415340d90a29b5cd3addcddb4aa	what does your period have to do w/ weight gain? and how would we know if your going to gain any weight? anyone is different|`|773423912135c7df27e7d885f006f8fcaa	At 14, i think your body is still "growing". You could be gaining height and weight - more boobs, stronger bones, shapelier figure :)) As long as it's proportionate growth, it's good sign.    Healthy diet, exercise & you will do fine!

Here is some more about it.       Definition:   Folliculitis is a superficial infection of the hair follicle. Hot tub folliculitis is an infection that develops after exposure to certain forms of bacteria that reside in warm, wet environments such as hot tubs.         Causes, incidence, and risk factors:   Most folliculitis is caused by the common organism Staphylococcus aureus. However, hot tub folliculitis is caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Pseudomonas survives in hot tubs, especially hot tubs made of wood, unless the pH and chlorine content are strictly controlled.    Hot tub folliculitis becomes noticeable within several hours to 2 days of exposure. It first appears as itchy bumps, some of which may be filled with pus. It may then develop into dark red tender nodules. The rash may be more dense under swimsuit areas, where the material has held the contaminated water in contact with the skin for a longer period of time.
7ebb82e4dda39b22cb2d5fc6c3150ff1aa	I am so sorry. I was date raped twice.    I guess it kind of depends on who did it but I think since you are of age--18--I would go to a professional first because you will really need that person to help you deal with whatever happens after you tell the person that you think you need to and if you don't go to a professional first, you might not ever. Also, the professional could tell that person with you so it would be easier to try and heal.    PLEASE do this. It will effect your whole life if you don't. Especially any kind of relationship you may ever want to have (husband).|`|773423912135c7df27e7d885f006f8fcaa	pls dun be afraid...talk to your mom & best friend.  better voice it out sooner the better.|`|ca27b7f3591b6a841f37f697b88d5f52aa	Please talk to your friend and she may help you to open up and tell your mother.

You need to be tested for any possibility of disease. Go have a pap test and aids test. You need to get some emotional help as well. I don't know if you have insurance. You should be covered under your parents plan if you are a full time student. You can use that ins. and talk to a therapist as well as go see a doc. You might be able to press charges as well. You need to protect others/children. There a signs sometimes that you might be able to re-call if something happened to you.  Also, remember the only way to make sure you have control over the situation is to try to not put your self in one. Go out in groups that don't drink/do drugs and some of this can be avoided. Let your friends know in advance to NOT let you go away with any one alone. Don't except drinks from people.  Remember there are alot of nice guys out there. Don't classifiy them all in the same group. Stay with in your own age group. If a older guy want to date you it's most likely cause he wants the upper hand in the relationship with you and will also propably use try to use you. He can't handel a real woman. You will be a woman some day and you will see what I mean. I've been there. I've always looked older for my age, not to mention I attracted a lot of MEN before I new why , Like age 12. It was awlful. I was so flattered and thought they really liked me. No, they just wanted me if you know what I mean. Telling your mom is besides the point unless you think she will point you in the right direction. She might surprise you.   Maybe try the link below. Try some kung fu classes and be positive. Always protect yourself. Don't be the victim. Take back your rights and don't be afraid Good luck.|`|fbacd97f307e1d923790b3e5fd43d803aa	sweety i was a virgin and at the age of 14 i was raped by an 18 year old guy who i thought was my best friend...i was also drugged by the date rape drug but by luck nothing happened....If you trust your best friend then go to her....you may want to seek counseling to...your are having panic attacks when a guy gets close to you...go  out with your friends...don;t stay in the house...please remember this is not your fault!

You DID NOT ask for it.   please talk to your friend.  at least tell him/her.|`|AA10558237	Depending on how your friend reacts or it was that molested/raped you, just keep in mind the friend might tell your mum.  I don't know if that would be something you want or not. Maybe she could help you tell her, maybe you'd prefer her to tell your mum for you but I just wanted to point that out that it's a possibility.    Good for you speaking up. There are rape helplines you could try phoning one of them for support and advice.   Otherwise go straight to the authorities. They have special officers trained to give you emotional support whilst you make your complaint against your attacker, which I hope you will do. This will help in coming to terms with what happened.|`|10a639d2e873e4496606d4efa1d33cbbaa	No matter how close you are to your mom, you should talk to her.

How can that be better than making love with a real woman?    He's doing this because you no longer turn him on.

Try role playing, anal, whips, ect.  See what could spark his interest.  If he is still poopin' out on you, you might suggest counsiling.  If worse comes to worse and this situation truly drives you up a wall, perhaps it is time to move on.|`|5368c90d6bb78266619f2cb5328a408eaa	I'm not sure why he would do that..... BUT you can take a off the wall approach, Tell him how you are feeling, also that your needs are being neglected and has been for almost 2 years. Let him know that something HAS to change. Tell him that either he starts to fulfill your needs as a woman. Ask him if he has a problem with doing that and if yes, What is the problem. Then tell him that if he does not take care of you and your womanly needs that you will be left to find a man on the side that will.... tell him he can watch and get his fetish fix while you are being satisfied..... See how he likes that one. Maybe then he will talk to you seriously about it. Sometimes you must play hard ball with some of the men out there.... and if you can't beat them, have him watch.   I know it is not conventional but ya never know maybe it will work out one way or the other. I hope this helps, and yeah I know it is thinking out of the box, but it seems he has been doing that for almost 2 years now any ways.|`|1776d38b31f640b96f92e960088296d6aa	why don't to start a new episode by offering your hand to shake him?

As someone who has had a child while alone and recently a child while married I can tell you that hormones do play a part in it, but only a PART which is why 'justme' was correct when she said PART of it is environmental.     And it may be more difficult for single moms because of that environmental factor. Single moms are less likely to seek help or have the support because they don't have anyone close by to observe out of the ordinary behavior. Also, if that is the case then the studies might be skewed because the studies only work for the people who report the PPD.|`|dc77a0259ecd837cc49537696fbec4e7aa	I was diagnosed with post partum depression 11 years ago, after the birth of my son.

759b251cb1f96062263eb5c2b92cf46eaa	You can lose weight, but I wouldn't do it with pills. For starters, it is dangerous and secondly, when you stop taking the pills the weight will just go back on again. You just need to eat healthily and exercise reguarly and it needs to be a lifestyle choice, not a diet.    Because your proportions have changed due to having your baby, you may not be able to get to the exact same measurements as before. If you lose 5kg, you can expect to lose up to a couple of inches of your waist and hips.

Cut down your portion sizes, and eat the right portion of everything.  For example...  I went to see a nutritionist. She told me that on my dinner plate, The biggest portion should be vegetables. Then there should be some kind of whole grain something (Whole grain pasta)...and then a very small amount of protein. ....    If thats too difficult, simply cut down your portions ..... substitute cookies and chips for fruits and veggies.     Also, for exercise, walk!. Its free. Walking for about a half hour a day. You'll burn off extra calories, its great for your heart, it'll boost your energy and your mood.     Dont forget, if your craving chocolate...dont deprive yourself. Have a hurshey kiss.

ee689657ab2345c3da2971f0e1247051aa	well there is a cough reflex from the laryngeal nerve (off of cranial nerve 10- the vagus nerve) that synapese in the medulla and causes excitation of the motor aspect of the CN10 and thus you experience a cough... now here is where it gets tricky.... in your ears you have afferent (sensory nerves) that send info back to the brainstem and let it know what is going on in terms of touch and pain/temperature... so as these nerves are coming back to the medulla also as part of the vagus nerve which supplies the sensory to the external auditory meatus (ear canal where you stick the q tip) and the tympanic membrane (where you shouldnt jab your q tip) and thus these incoming fibers give off some signals..... this confuses your brainstem and the cough reflex goes off !!! this is similar to what happens when people having a heart attack say they feel pain radiating up and  down their arm and up through their chin....it is because of a little bit of crossover in some of the nerves  and thier nuclei in the medulla (lowest part of  brainstem)|`|8275b64e180d41e17c349f175e4299d4aa	my wife has the same problem.  one makes her cough, the other dry heave|`|AA11829516	I know that your ears, nose and throat all have a shared opening.  It could be that when you use a q-tip (which you aren't supposed to be doing) you could be pushing wax further into your ear causing that to close the airway that are shared by your ears nose and throat and your body's reaction is a cough.  I'm assuming the cough is kind of like a tickle cough?  If that's the type of cough your experiencing, then yes, you're tickling your throat through your ear... funny sounding huh?  To prevent this, I would take a good hot shower.  The second you get out of the shower, tilt your head and tug on your ear, this should help to promote draining of the wax in your ear. I would then take some t.p. or kleenex and wrap it around your pinky and clean out your ear this way.  I was told never to use qtips because it can push the wax further down into your eardrum which can cause bacteria to become trapped which in turn causes infection.  So be careful when you do this.|`|b2262d42964ec0455df89544e2a8ff9aaa	It is a common phenomena, which occurs due to common nerve supply .,i.e.: a branch of vagus nerve , which also supplies the external auditory meatus|`|a781bc434ae321dd9513d859b0eee56baa	There is a sensory region in the ear canal for the 9th and 10th cranial nerves which are responsible for the gag reflex.|`|020c8b995f845d51e6a78d1ec529d405aa	Never stick a q-tip in your ears.  You could puncture your eardrum or push the wax in farther.  Your ears produce wax to help trap dirt and debris so it doesn't get into your ear.  As new wax is made it pushes the old wax out.  You should not have to worry about the wax in your ears unless it is excess.  If the wax is excessive or starts to harden use debrox drops to help soften it.  If you feel you have wax that needs to be removed from the canals then see your doc and have them flushed out if needed.|`|ac5d379447ce789db851dafaedda2dcdaa	It does happen to me!

15a0ebc8249c2e86a3626505fbea1010aa	Hi    You are suffering from what is known as Psychotic Depression. It is a form of depression which is accompanied by Auditory and Visual Hallucinations. You do not have Schizophrenia because in that case you would not know that what you hear is true or not. In your case you are aware that what you hear does not truly exist.    Do not be afraid of a psychiatrist. Psychotic Depression needs to be treated quickly or else it can worsen. You psychiatrist will prescribe medicines for both conditions the psychosis (voices you hear) and depression.    You do not suffer from situational depression but Psychotic Depression. Please do not make the mistake of not visiting your psychiatrist as this can worsen your condition. Furthermore, if you need help with your depression feel free to contact me. Thank you.|`|de37364d964854e7e7086fb9474ed378aa	Sounds like you are having auditory illusions...which is the false perception of an external stimuli.  This is a first as usually i hear about auditory HALLUCINATIONS (flase perception without an external stimuli).

Definitely get it chekced out by a psychiatrist for it could get worse.|`|d457397edb676a651fa189f94cc72b2aaa	Maybe it's a calling to become a musician.|`|9baab1f124a713b8b295ac00a7a5cab6aa	I hear "music" sometimes, and my mum has on several occasions. You can hear the tune, but words are muffled.     Scarily, i have recently discovered that whenever i turn on a tap, i can hear voices screaming at each other, however i believe it to be part and parcel of having PTSD rather than a form of schizophrenia.    But don't worry, its quite normal!!    From what I've been told,our brain stores snippets of audio, and sometimes visuals, and can randomly replay them to you, which can prove to be annoying and at times can be distressing.    The only advice i can suggest is the minute the music starts find something to distract your mind, such as playing the "color game". In the room you are in, tell yourself that you need to find say, 5 things that are green. Really focus on finding those things and once you have, set yourself another task, for example.to find 4 red squares or a picture of a car. etc.   If by 5 goes, the music is still there, wait half an hour and try again.     oh, and a tip, i know its hard, but Don't think about the music, even when it goes, try not to think about it.  This technique helps to distract the brain. Often as not your brain will forget what it was doing prior to the game and you will have peace, but if you remind it in any way, any progress made will be lost and you will have to start again.    I use this same technique when i feel paranoid or angry. Its a slow process, but it in most cases it works!    Another suggestion would be to try some relaxation. Sometimes these audio hallucinations are a result of an over stimuli in the brain caused by stress and/or a hyperactive mind. Taking time to calm your body and mind on a daily basis is very beneficial to your physical, mental and emotional health.    Hope this helps!  Cheers,  Brittany
bf1024b1f5157eaf225de76b644af03caa	Tummy tuck and Thigh lift surgery has become very common now. My cousin got her breast reduction, tummy tuck and facelift surgery in India by the company called Forerunners Healthcare .The Price for the surgery she paid in India was very less. She paid 30% of the cost she was quoted in America.    Forerunners Healthcare is very famous in India. They arrange cosmetic and plastic surgery for foreigners in India. I read a lot about them in the Newspapers and about their patient stories. They arrange financing for USA, Canadian, UK and other international patients who plan to have surgery abroad for low price, as the breast reduction, tummy tuck, facelift and other cosmetic surgery is not covered by insurance. They also have photos pasted of their International patients. You can checkout their website. There are huge cost savings. As a doctor I personally believe that surgery can be easily handled in India, as the quality of healthcare available In India is simply best in the world. The surgeons are USA/UK trained and facilities are 5 star.    Many patients travel from United States of America and UK to get low cost surgery in India. Indian corporate hospitals are comparable to hospitals anywhere in the world. In fact, India has medical facilities that are comparable with the USA, UK and Canada. India offers World Class Medical Facilities, comparable with any of the western countries. India has state of the art Hospitals and the best medical experts. With the best infrastructure, the best possible Medical facilities, accompanied with the most competitive prices, you can get the treatment done in India at the lowest prices.    http://www.forerunnershealthcare.com  Hope this helps.|`|68edad4826bc75b2b9f39ed5a85d8cf5aa	Have you had a good endocrinologist check you out for Cushing's or thyroid problems ?    www.cushings-help.com    Good luck.|`|9baab1f124a713b8b295ac00a7a5cab6aa	If there was a way i think everyone would be asking for donations!!!!  I don't think there are many people out there who doesn't want something fixed on their body, Fat or thin.   I personally have around $25k worth of plastic surgery i would love to have done, but know that financially i cannot afford it, so let it go.    I think its actually quite rude to ask for any donations as it is a shallow cause. If you had been severely disfigured in a fire and needed a facial reconstruction I'm very sure we'd all donate to you, but not so you can conform to society's view of beauty.    Plastic surgery will not give you a better life or make you any happier. Infact, in most cases, it tends to do the opposite as the standards of what is beautiful changes constantly and you end up with a distorted body image.     Perhaps what you need to be focusing on is learning to love yourself for you and not focusing on your dimply thighs or flabby arms - then maybe your "problems" wont seem so big after all.    Plastic surgery is just a bandaid that covers up the problems, but it doesn't get rid of them, and unless you are completely comfortable with yourself prior to surgery, your view on your body will not change. Age gets the better of us all in the end and eventually the surgery undoes itself.     You can either continuously put yourself into financial and emotional debt trying to achieve perfection - Or be comfortable and proud of who you are as a person now, and get on with living!

Peace and Blessings|`|64252df152665aa16763c1469220fa56aa	When threatened or stressed, our bodies mount a chemical response, and while this response affects our emotions and outlook (and is, in that sense, "in our heads"), it begins and ends in the body.   This is often good such as when you are fearful and must react quickley due to an impending danger for example or more simply just to get out of bed to be on time for work. We need these reactions but if in chronic mode and on overload than there can be negative effects on our health.  The body reacts to stress first by releasing the catecholamine hormones, epinephrine and norepinephrine, and the glucocorticoid hormones, cortisol and cortisone.  Basically, what these hormones do is affect many bodily functions such as the heart and heart rate, blood pressure, blood vessels, blood sugar. However, when a person is under continuous or frequent stress and these hormones are at high levels over long periods of time, they can begin to damage the body leading to many physical illnesses.   Basically, it is important to understand what is stress, what causes it in you, how does it make you feel and if you believe you are often in a very stressful state then seek effective ways to reduce your stress like exercise or an enjoyable hobby.

Many of my friends in college did it when they were in high school too, and they are all happy with it.  We all pretty much had the same experience. Our skin got incredibly dry. I would buy whatever moisturizers your derm recommends. Your lips will peel. Many say the top layer of your lips will peel off on a daily basis. Gross? Yeah. Also, since you have to go off other acne meds while you're on it, and it doesn't start working right away, you acne may get worse before it gets better.    It's kinda like braces though. Once you go through all the discomfort, you will be more attractive for ever.|`|6e9c23fd5dc7af9217a1c29a4c6d704caa	Treating Acne With Isotretinoin      Isotretinoin has become very popular for acne treatment. Isotretinoin is a retinoid, meaning that it is derived from vitamin A. Chemically it is known as 13-cis retinoic acid. Isotretinoin generally gives relief in severe acne and is a drug of choice for acne patients who may have lost hope about cure of their acne. Isotretinoin should always be taken under strict medical guidance as it can produce birth defects in fetus. You should also discuss about any possible pregnancy with your doctor if you are sexually active. While taking isotretinoin, you should be always in contact with your doctor and report any side-effect. Isotretinoin may also be used for some other conditions that include- folliculitis, seborrhoea, chloracne and other diseases that look like acne.    Prescription:  Isotretinoin is prescribed for acne treatment. Isotretinoin works by shrinking the sebaceous glands and reducing sebum production. Isotretinoin is anti-inflammatory and removes comedones. The treated skin is dry and inhibits the growth of acne bacteria.    Isotretinoin is prescribed in case of severe acne, scarring acne, moderate acne that is not responding to other medication and every case of acne where doctor feels that isotretinoin should be prescribed to get rid of acne. The dosage of isotretinoin will depend upon the severity of acne, body weight, other treatments being used at the same time etc. Your doctor is the best person to decide about the dose. Normally the treatment begins with small dose and as body adjusts to isotretinoin the dose is increased. Doctors also monitor the cure during this period and if they find that patient is not responding, they may stop the therapy. As isotretinoin needs fat to help its absorption in body, it is taken after food. Follow your doctor's advice about these.    Side-Effects:  The common side-effects of isotretinoin are dry mouth, dry nose, thinning of hair, fatigue, dry skin, red itchy eyes, sore lips, etc. If you experience any other side-effects such as muscle aches, difficulty in walking, depression, vomiting, etc. talk to your doctor immediately. Discuss about side-effects with your doctor before beginning of the treatment with isotretinoin and report any expected or unexpected side-effect immediately. Note that you may not be able to wear your contact lenses for some time in the beginning of treatment with isotretinoin. You are also not supposed to donate any blood while you are taking isotretinoin and for one month after you stop taking it. Please talk about do's and don't with your doctor. You also must tell your doctor about any medicine or vitamins that you are taking. You are not supposed to take any medicines orally nor use any topicals without consulting your doctor while taking isotretinoin.    Isotretinoin And Pregnancy:  Isotretinoin can cause serious defects in the fetus. Therefore you should inform your doctor if you are pregnant. You should also tell your doctor if you plan to become pregnant or are already breast-feeding. You will have to test yourself for pregnancy before you begin isotretinoin and continue getting tested while taking Isotretinoin. Your doctor will explain the details to you. If you get pregnant while taking isotretinoin you should stop taking it and call your doctor immediately. You must adopt two reliable methods of birth control for one month before taking isotretinoin, continue with two methods while taking isotretinoin and till after one month of stopping isotretinoin. You should talk to your gynaecologist and dermatologist in detail before taking isotretinoin. more- http://www.doctorgoodskin.com/ds/acne/tr...|`|8a3abd59e2bc09c855bfe710c7733784aa	accutane is one of the stronger medications you can use for acne, usually reserved for severe acne or if nothing else has worked. it works as a chemical similar to vitamin A (which is really important for healthy skin) and works (in most patients) really well. on the basis that accutane is usually reserved for severe cases or if nothing else worked...you've got nothing much to lose! it's one of the last drugs you could try taking to help with your acne.  the problem is, there are lots of side effects. dry skin is the biggest one. if you do decide to get this prescription ask the pharmacist to recommend something for your face. you need to use something thats not oily but will help keep your skin moisturized. if you're planning on becoming pregnant or if you're sexually active, it's highly recommended that you use double protection while you're on accutane because it causes big problems with babies.    like other acne medications this wont work right away (may take up to 2-4 weeks to see any effect and 6-8weeks to see maximum effect) and will probalby cause a worsening of your acne at first. the good news is, for most people after they go on accutane to clear up their acne they can stop taking it and go back to something like a face wash or another topical drug.

Those are usually caused when you're fighting an bacterial infection or virus, which would make your throat sore.|`|7fd1e26c1d33580417bf2ccf5d1bc71baa	You say the area below the chin is puffy? Is this the areas off to the side of the chin? If so, there are glands there that swell sometimes with infections.  They could be viral or bacterial. The sore throat and swollen glands often go together.  Until you can get to your appointment, you can gargle with warm salt water (two teaspoons of salt mixed in a glass of warm water) this will help with the sore throat. You can also take a tablespoon of honey and lemon juice. But that just coats the throat for a pain relief.  The swollen glands and sore throat plus fatigue could be anything from mono, strep throat to just an ordinary sore throat. If you aren't having fever, you can probably wait until the 10th for your appt and you may even be over it by then but if you are running a temperature over 100 degrees, you might want to check into a walk in clinic for treatment.  Also, if you have post nasal drip draining down the back of your throat, that can cause a sore throat.|`|aca040cf74dd69c8d77644403e83195eaa	it could be swollen glands caused by an infection somewhere on your body that you dont even know about like from a new piercing on even your ears or a zit gone wrong. if thats the case it should go away after a couple days its just your body doing its job this happens to me all the time.     if you shine a flash light down your throut and you see white bumps and really red then you probably have streap throut, also not big deal but for that one you'll have to wait for doc|`|AA11670356	you don't say how old you are...it is probably a swollen saliva gland, but there is an outside chance of being a lymph node.....that might spell trouble.  my advice, move your appointment up.

ecefa11527b3e3afca210fcfeed446b9aa	I have the perfect answer to this question, trust me!  I hate sore throats with a passion.  The key is to get rid of it fast.  The infection causing the soreness must go.  The way to do that is to increase blood flow to your throat so that the infection will be carried away.  How?  Hot sauce, tabasco sauce, chili peppers, Mexican food.  Douse everything with Picante sauce.  Yes, it will hurt a little, but buck up!      You don't want to use those smarmy little anesthetic sprays.  The pain relief only lasts a short while and the alcohol will dry out your throat, thus extending the time you have a sore throat.    If you are really tough, gargle with spoonful of chili powder in a glass of warm water.  But DO eat that Mexican food.  Just what the doctor ordered.  :)|`|05b198db1991f0d898b6239262e3b22daa	Scope or Listerine.

The only thing that i might add to this is that both smokers and non-smokers need to respect each others right to smoke or not to smoke. this means that if your around non-smokers you should refrain from smoking around them and if there's a group of smokers than a non-smoker shouldn't complain about them.|`|a68301db1749d71894ea5022bfa7573daa	Of course everyone dies!!! There are 2 questions you have to answer:    How soon do you want to die?  How much do you want to suffer before you die?    Smoking is unbelievably bad for you. It affects you in sooo many ways, none of which are positive. Have you ever gone running as fast as you can and then felt the extreme discomfort whilst trying to catch your breath? The pain in your chest and the constant feeling of pushing yourself to breathe? Because if you smoke, that is how you will live out the last few YEARS of your life, 24 hours, 7days a week.    I've seen people who have had bits of their throat cut out because of cancer, with tubes to breathe. Yet they still smoke with a cigarette in the tube, and do they regret smoking...YES!

The best way i recommend is to face the situation head on. If you are scared fine, just accept it and start from there. Think what you can do to fix it. Maybe prepare better. I have done some presentation recently and the best way i found was to prepare as much as possible. A majority of the time the only reason people are scared is because they don't know their material.     Once you have prepared the next step is to have confidence in yourself. Tell yourself that "I can do it" and I believe that you can.    Good luck with the presentation.  Feel free to leave me a feedback after the presentation

People who are occasional/social smokers, normally smoke while they drink to increase their buzz without getting sick from alcohol. When you become an addicted smoker, your body's chemicals become out of balance due to the tolerance from nicotine, that's what causes the addiction. Like when your hungry, you crave something to eat because your body needs food to function normally, only with nicotine you won't die if you stop smoking, most will just wish they did since it takes your body a few days to produce and balance the chemicals naturally in your body.|`|a525eea0fa5f8a1809e61c39b38dbec2aa	"Taste" isn't really the big deal with smoking.  Just the actions of smoking are relaxing, as is watching the smoke itself after exhaling.  Many people, while trying to quit, have to find something that keeps both their hands and mouths busy, like suckers, because of this.  I've never smoked a cigarette that actually "tasted" good, it's more the fact that after a while you just stop noticing any taste at all.      Howerver, by talking about taste, they could be referring to how smooth the cigarette is, how much it burns the throat, ect...  I've heard that done many times, as well as done it myself.  The smoother the cigarette, the better it "tastes".|`|AA11416432	Well, I probably have a cigarrette once every couple of months or longer.  Clearly not addicted.    But a ciggie is not just a whole batch of addictive chemicals you know, it is also a habit.  A physical act linked to another act - for me its usually required with my 5th glass of wine.  For others is might be with coffee after dinner.  Its a mental link more than a physical crave.  It feels nice to draw the smoke in, usually tastes fantastic, and the act of holding and smoking and ashing is repetitive and really quite nice.  Relaxing.  Kind of comforting.  Feel awful next day though.  Ick.

b3f4e18d70d1b2a692cd33e70309e56caa	I dont believe panic or anxiety is one of the side effects listed. However, there are some withdraw symptoms that may make you feel that way i suppose. Some do report increase heart rate. I Love Chantix, I quit a 15 year habit in 5 days with little pain. I used smokeless tobacco, which users of that generally have much higher nicotine levels than smokers. I have surveyed lots of people, and the side effects are all over the place. Some people have crazy dreams, some cant sleep, some cant stay awake, some have gas, some have dry mouth, some dont want food, some cant stop eating(ME), some get rashes and some get heart rate increases. As for me, I got a small stomach ache that would pass shortly after taking the pill. If I ate something (as directed) before taking the pill I felt no ache. A friend of mine just quit smoking and had NO side effects whatsoever. Most people's side effects I've heard about are mild. If your insurance doesn't cover it, you can find a 30 day supply for about $100 at Wal-Mart or Sams with Doctor prescription. Some drug store were in the $150 range, so I shopped around. I thought that seemed high, but now I would have paid much more. It worked great for me when everything else over the years has failed. You still have to have will power, but I discovered it was way less than the will power needed with patches, gums or cold turkey. I'm on my 4th week of being nicotine free and feel great. It was like saying goodbye to a good friend initially, but in just a few short weeks, I no longer miss it. *Oh, I also had an online support that sent me an encouraging email daily, kept track of the money I was saving from quittting, reminded me of the reasons I was quitting, etc. Go to the Chantix web site for more info on that. www.chantix.com. There is also a video that shows how Chantix works by blocking nicotine receptors in the brain, but still releases dopamine. Basically the "nicotine fix" feeling you are seeking is being provided by the pill while your body sheds the addiction to the nicotine. I had Mild cravings the first few days (you can still smoke then) but the pill took the desire totally away by the end of the first week. I'm sure results vary. The hardest part is not having something in your mouth or hands. So I used sunflower seeds, but the smokers I have spoken to used cut straws. I was shocked - it works! I love it! Best of luck to you!|`|675499f90412803792f9c27f3e0452adaa	I took chantix and it didnt do a thing for me. I also tried Zyban which didnt do a thing for me.

Perhaps you need to switch over to smaller quantities, such as 1/8 of an ounce, 1/4 of an ounce, or even a 1/2 ounce.

Even u can not wear/hold the condom if you are not erect. And even if u manage to wear it, it will be slipped out after urination.    You can use diapers instead of this. There are so many diapers in the market (for big babies, for older people etc.)    But in my suggestion you should not use anyting. Whenever you have urge for pee, try to hold it as long as you can. As it will help you  after marriage (the more you will hold pee, the more you can hold your *** at the time of sex..... ha ha)  I am not joking, its the best exercise for long last sex, prescribed by doctors.    So Dont use anything, just go to toilet whenever its necessary..... ok... bye|`|f14c9fc295203397dbf05adb5f0f62f3aa	There are other devices besides condoms that can be used for urination purposes.

8c643a48148981e73f897b3569fc6e5eaa	The program is based on increasing your self-esteem, basically. It's going under the assumption that your anxiety, depression and phobias are all in your head, and you are the only one who can work through them. I think the idea would work for a lot of people who simply haven't learned to cope or manage stress/negative emotions.  Don't expect miracles- you'd need to invest at least 3+ months working through the program step by step. Changing your thinking isn't easy, and you'll have set-backs and plateaus. You really need to commit to the long-term - it's not a quick fix.    I think the program is doable and will be successful for certain people facing certain levels of depression/anxiety. Go ahead and open the box- you can return it with refund money-back, can't you?|`|AA10144167	I think it mostly depends on how severe your anxiety is.  Do you suffer from panic attacks or agoraphobia? My husband bought this series for me quite a few years ago, and though I depended on medication a lot to help me, eventually I was able to put to use the breathing and self-talk techniques and give up the meds. If you are truly committed to the series, it will probably be a positive thing for you.  There are a lot of people who share their feelings and experiences on the tapes, and it helps to know that you're not as "whacked out" as you think!! Give it a try. It definitely won't hurt and you can always refer back to it if you slip backward for some reason!

6c24bd09d5554084f9dcc2b1547b01d3aa	It depends. Most STDs are transmitted through bodily fluids, so if either the condom or the penis has been exposed to bodily fluids other than your own (meaning his) then yes. Also if the person has a either a herpes or genital wart outbreak on that area of the penis that is exposed, and you come in contact with that area, then you could get either disease as well. It is also possible if the penis has broken skin in the exposed area. Also, if the condom rolls down halfway, it is probably not covering the tip of the penis very well, so semen most likely would escape from the condom and end up on his penis or even inside you.|`|cea6060ca469f8c63d8312d13d06b971aa	Yes.

AA11431188	Well, first of all 5'8 and 140 isn't fat! but i understand you feeling like you could lose a few pounds. soft drinks have a ton of calories in them! i can of regular softdrink has about 150 calories. so five of them is 750 calories (that is more than most meals should have!)! if you cut out just the soft drinks, believe me, you will drop pounds even if the rest of your diet stays the same. start drinking diet soft drinks, water etc. instead. the weight will start coming off. also, watch your portions! it's ok to have a cookie or small dish of ice cream. just don't have 5 cookies or a huge bowl of it! tell your mum how you feel. even if she doesn't want to stop buying soft drinks and lollies, ask her to buy some healthier things for you to have. the rest is up to you.|`|1f1a01000ac84e6de88faa95b8cd9b83aa	Definitely stop drinking the soft drinks...stick to water instead....you already have it in your house, so you can't blame that one on your mum!  Maybe ask your mum to buy some healthier foods for you...she can't really argue with her daughter wanting to be healthy, can she?

e70e42429c333fa029abdbcdae37f2a2aa	He doesn't, but unless you're dancing in skates there's nothing to support your foot and ankle until it heals. In hockey the foot and ankle are encased in hard plastic which keeps them relatively safe.    In your case the pain will likely decrease as the swelling does so that's your first priority. It really is quite difficult to break a bone in the foot, and there's not much that can be done once you do. Physio for a foot break? Not unless it's affected the musculature.    You can 1) keep the foot elevated as much as possible 2) keep it iced 3) after the swelling reduces, apply heat to relax the surrounding muscles 4) do not wrap it unless you're trying to walk on it when a light, supportive wrap should be used.|`|AA11053499	You might consider a second opinion (find another doctor).

AA11220927	You can just use both skin treatments, oily and dry, when you feel your skin needs it. Our body changes, so does our skin, so you need to adapt your skin regime to your skin condition. It sounds like you may have sensitive skin. Have you tried Neutregena for sensitive skin? My sister uses it and it keeps her face under control. If your skin is too oily sometimes, then you blotting paper to absorb facial oil.

That is why some women have period acne, like my older sister who breakout before every period.     So go for sensitive skin products like Neutrogena for sensitive skin or try Cetaphil cleanser.

My thighs are slimming down, but the calves (with more muscle definition) are looking larger.  However, there is definately more definition between the calf muscle and my ankle.  If what you are truly worried about are cankles, then don't worry about it.  I run on hills, which are notorious for working the calves - someone else said it, but running on flat surfaces decreases the work load of the calves.    Bike riding made my leg muscles huge (along with maxing out the leg press machine).  Running is really toning them up and has been great cardio for burning fat.  They look pretty good in a skirt with heels too.    I'm not sure if ANY exercise will really keep you from gaining muscle mass or definition in your legs.  Unless you are really thin to begin with, any additional definition to the legs will be offset by the loss of fat from the layer on the the skin.

fc7ec66131fad928efea00305e218a7daa	You are absolutely right.  Treadmill is easier than running outside - primarily due to friction coefficients.  A treadmill is a perfectly flat, exactly paced run with no headwinds. It is a myth that treadmills are easier than running outside because they pull you.  Einstein's theory of relativity means that you are running 5 mph relative to the belt and 5 mph relative to the earth.  If you think about it, the earth is spinning 1,038 miles per hour beneath you (if you are at the equator) - but you don't call that cheating.  When you walk in an airplane, you're not burning less calories because the plane is moving 500 mph.     However, friction is a real issue.  It IS much harder to run outside, to go up and down micro inclines and try and balance yourself on imperceptably uneven surfaces against a 5 mph wind (or however fast you are running).    ADDENDUM:  Ahah!  You added a very critical point, which is that you hang on to the bar.  Yes, it is MUCH easier when you hang on to the bar.  Here's the physics why.  Let's say you set it to 6 miles per hour (10 minute mile). As you say, the treadmill belt is indeed "pulling" your leg backward by 6 mph. But the pulling motion is relative to you and the stationary part of the treadmill (e.g. bars). If you are running faster than 6 mph, you actually move up the belt and if not, you move back on the belt.  It becomes easier not because the belt is pulling your leg back, but the bars (if you are hanging on) are "pulling" you forward.  The bars, relative to the belt (and you if you decided not to move your feet) are moving forward at 6 mph. Remember from your physics classes that Work = Force x Distance, where force = mass x acceleration.   The Force of the bars (and the treadmill that it is attached to) is equal to the weight of the treadmill times the acceleration power of the treadmill's motor (which is quite strong). In other words, the treadmill will help you along as much as you want it to when you hang on.  The ultimate is if you decide not to move your legs at all and let the treadmill bars pull you forward at 6 mph on the belt.  The other extreme is not using the bars at all and you get to "run" with a lower friction coefficient.  In between, you are getting assistance from the bars as much as the difference between your speed relative to the belt and 6mph.    Good luck on your workout.  I'm proud of you in your efforts!|`|ZVyoid22aa	In addition to the "help" you get from the treadmill's moving platform, it also provides a bit of extra shock impact for your joints.      When you are running outside, you do burn slightly more calories.  This is due to the varied terrain which your muscles and joints must adjust and balance for, and toe-off phase of running where you exert slightly more energy.  Similarly, running on a more varied trail would burn more calories than a flat sidewalk.      If your goal is to eventually run outside, I would suggest running half of your workout on the treadmill, go outside to run the next quarter of the workout, and return to the treadmill for the last quarter.  You will find that you can gradually increase the amount you run outside and decrease the amount you run on the treadmill.  And congratulations!  Running is such an amazing and rewarding excercise.  Good luck with your training!|`|c8cf49c7a47fbaa7750871d16821a0c0aa	Congratulations on trying to become healthier.  I took up running several years ago and do a fair amount of treadmill running and outdoor running.  I personally prefer the treadmill because I can keep an even pace easier and it is safer than running in the street.  But I agree with you that running on a treadmill is a bit easier than running outdoors.  Primarily due to the fact that you are not dealing with the elements (heat, cold, and wind).  Also outdoor running forces you to adjust to grades (although most good treadmills can simulate hill running with the exception of the "downhill" part).    In any case, with you current weight you may want to run on a safe surface as to not promote injuries to your tendons and ligaments.  You are much more prone to damaging these tendons until you drop some of the weight.  So basically running on a good surface is very important.  I found an old article from Runners World magazine that states the top ten surfaces to run on.  The link is here:    http://www.runnersworld.co.uk/news/artic...    Basically, running on a treadmill is a better surface (in their opinion) than running on asphalt or cement.  Below are their comments on treadmills:    Pros: The smooth surface is generally easy on the legs, and hitting a desired pace is simply a matter of adjusting the machine (as long as you can keep up!). Additionally, you dont have to worry about external factors such as dogs, wind and bad weather. The precise level of control makes a treadmill ideal for speedwork.    Cons: Effectively running on the spot isnt very exciting, and if you dont concentrate on keeping up your pace, you could be unceremoniously dumped behind the machine. Without the benefit of a natural breeze, treadmill runners tend to sweat profusely. The machines are too expensive for most individual runners, and gym membership may be uneconomical if you just go there to run.    Conclusion: Not everyones cup of tea, but fine if you live in an inner-city area with few trails, little grass and freezing weather. Also good for rural runners when the days are short, and for runners who find it hard to keep up a steady pace.    In any case, congratulations on your fitness regimen and good luck to you!

A minor form is used widely in Indian homes, for curing day-to-day illnesses like common colds, etc - called home remedies.     An ayurvedic soap - well, is not COMPLETELY ayurvedic, because to be a soap, it will have required chemicals. Typically in ayurveda, certain powders are used for cleaning the body while bathing. I have used these and they feel heavenly.     An ayurvedic soap probably differs from others in that it might contain all plant based extracts/ fragrances, and minimum amount of chemicals. (Almost all foreign soaps contain animal products - these are not present in such soaps)|`|bc4fb562634fe1263a037ab037c5d014aa	The term 'Ayurveda' is a Sanskrit name , Ayu='long life' Veda= 'knowledge' which means 'the knowledge of long life'. Ayurveda is therefore a 'way of life' rather than a system of medicine. Ayurveda uses herbs with medicinal properties , for treating diseases. There is a new trend in society to go for natural things and therefore manufacturers of cosmetics are now adding one or two herbal extract into soaps and call them as 'Ayurveda' soap or herbal soap. This is common for toothpaste as well. There are many herbs like 'neem' that are provan for their germicidal properties and good for 'skincare' and used widely in Ayurveda. But, do not expect miracles to happen, after using them because  the amount of herbal goodness in those soaps are minute. Do not be carried away by the term 'Ayurveda' in soaps because they are mostly marketing tricks.   Wisdom of Ayurveda is invaluable and is a blessing to the mankind.|`|fc49c21691e39a0333658afdb706dba3aa	It means disposed of toxins and acidity in excess.  Diaphragm surrendered (pali, sanskrit and hindu).  Get those beans complaining, do care not for their words, though, they are already full of you. Vitamins and all what is good for you. As some might say all your work conditions.    That line about all your body needs is about rigveda.  Disposal surrendered|`|fcde95c8708ee7e9b02f9a16e334327eaa	Ayurveda means science of life. Ayur means life and veda means ancient science in india. Ayurveda is an alternative medicine. You can know more about ayurveda from the website http://www.ayur-vedic.com

Aso an easy portion control is a simple handful of cereal\steak\beans\whatever your body dictates.   Observe other people when they eat----the bigger they are the faster they tend to eat-----you can stuff yourself way before your brain says to the gut factory-"That's 'nough" Eat slowly and chew well [ you need the saliva provided by thourough mastication to effectivly digest what you eat ]  If you can work your way thru this you can redefine your food budget and buy/afford better choices and get healthier in the process.  The biggest secret--don't think about it or make it a continual topic of conversation-just do it for yourself-nobody else cares.
AA11390361	Youre on the right track.Add som weight training-not necessary to have home gym-some dumbells of weight from 5-20 will do-can buy at any Sport Shop and even Wal Mart or Target. Dumbells(free wights are even better for allows free total range of motion.)Be sure and take in some dairy esp milk and cheese-fat free for calcium plays a role in weight reduction-I take a daily MltiVitamin -Mineral Supplement since certain nutrients like also b-Vit  etc  are needed for weight loss. Eat Breakfast for skipping puts body in a saving/storing calories mode and it does this by slowing metabolism-which you do not want.(working out with weights increases metabolism.)Breakfast can be a glass of milk and banana  or green tea and a bagel- best would be a small amt of salmon(Protein-should be main part of what you eat)some fruit like strawberries-any berry is good  and green tea.The idea is to put food into body so it will not go into storing mode. Also the foods you do eat make sure nutritious and protects from diseases-cancer esp.  Dark green vegggies,appls,oranges FRUITS-No meat but if must only White baked-Not Pork for is red meat.-like turkey and chicken.Red Meat has bad fat and a lot one can;t see.Some fat-that comes for veggies is good-all fat that comes from meat and animal sources is bad.   Good Luck|`|7a326a9433f8664c5d4f0f061cf8a2ebaa	Sounds good to me. As long as you do 30-60 mins of cardio each day, you will get that weight right off!   I would also recommend cutting down on the bad carbs. Replace white bread, potatos and white rice with Wholegrain Bread or sourdough, Pumpkin and Basmati rice.    This will really help your body burn longer and you will notice positive changes sooner.    Good luck!|`|422a4549168fb81ddfa696480de8d0a3aa	just eat right and break a sweat.
1835ede949a6acde8708a0418fc6fe7eaa	I would honestly estimate about 6 weeks. My friend is your size and he waited that long until he applied to his new job and passed. You already know it depends how fast it can work through your body based on your size....diff for everyone....I have a slowww metabolism :P|`|OLm0qkB4aa	1 month to be sure it will come out negative.

04224b55dbe6d25a34730fdddf5252b9aa	no.and iv'e helped quite a few ppl with speed addiction.speed/ice/meth is the worst drug as far as internal damage and getting of it is concerned.if the person takes it internally ie:eats it or drinks it it's very hard as the internal organs become accustomed to working with it,so in essence it becomes a physical and mental addiction.if your friend isn't ready for help you will be wasting your time,but that doesn't mean give up.but be careful you dont bring yourself down to.the best thing you can do for your friend is get them away from thier current enviroment and ppl they know and thier sources.a change is as good as a holiday,anyway?the good news is the mental problems are only temporary and abate fairly quick the physical side is a bit different.depending on the level of addiction,or more specifically the amount there using it can take up to 3 years. i would offer to help but i'm a bit tied up trying to help 2 other ppl at the moment plus 1 other for another problem.  PS>if there ready they'll do it themselves(they still need support though)but they will just keep falling back into it while they still run with the same crowd and stay in the same enviroment.|`|40ecf6eacbfc518d65853847ec5c73baaa	HELL NO!! I hear its harder to quit METH than coke. Dont even try it!|`|8a981bb18bea54e8b9c8c912b361b7aeaa	depends on how long theyve been using. the best way to help is most likely rehab for heavy users or if the use isnt toooooo bad just quit cold turkey. You can help by giving them all the support in the world and letting them know they can do it.|`|056de883a53947426c86ee3a00a42304aa	Your friend needs help and you probably aren't enough unfortunately. He/she needs some form of professional intervention. You could try talking to your friend, but, don't be disappointed if he/she is still using. It's a tough thing to watch someone you care about go down the tubes. Sometimes these people need to hit rock bottom in order to realize that they need help themselves.|`|AA12386014	Sadly, the only thing that would work is probably rehab. Good luck.
8c643a48148981e73f897b3569fc6e5eaa	Not smoking is great! I can't believe I once used to light a roll of chemicals, stick it under my nose and suck on it. Pretty gross. I'd suggest you get the patch, You don't smoke while on it- you apply the patch and call yourself a non-smoker.  You'd be surprised at how many people secretly think you stink (your hair, breath, clothes, home, car) right now, so don't be afraid to quit.|`|4b4ae51e22f7a1ccbb2ef6e5f920f5e7aa	Yes chantix works.  you can still smoke when you take it.  it actually makes you dislike the smell and taste of a cigarette.  it will stop your actual mental cravings, but not the actual "habit" of smoking.  so the hardest part is to still try and find something to do with your hands, but you won't crave them anymore.  it does work different with different people, but you should be smoke free within 2 weeks.    good luck.|`|ae4afccd58f1ebbb8504d0dea2b6cd7faa	you have to accept that you dont need that cigarette, you dont need to smoke anymore!|`|AA10255422	It scares you because it is an addiction.  Don't take medication.  Just take it day by day.  Start cutting them out until your down to one a day, then just try to keep your hands busy.  Find a project or hobby and don't hang out with people that smoke.  I bought a bag of tootsie roll pops and everytime I wanted a cigerette, I would eat one of those.|`|f204f9a2a08b07906da7fcc16e34e34daa	Eight months and 22 days ago, I was thinking the same thing you are.  I tried the patch previously, to no avail.  I tried wellbutrin previosuly, to no avail.  This time, I did it cold turkey and found a few non-smoking, supportive friends I could call and vent to or go out with when I really felt like the cigs were gonna kick my ***.  It wasn't easy, but if you're truly ready, it will happen.  Best of luck from someone who knows you can do it!|`|85201c7b2eeef449a770eef820ddb4e7aa	i have been taking chantix for a little over two weeks, and i am finding that my cravings are going away finally! But i still have a mental urge to smoke, but i think with this stuff i will be able to quit, my quit date is 1/25 which is thursday, i am excited!
