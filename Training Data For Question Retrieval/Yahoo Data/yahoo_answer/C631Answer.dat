lcj1AKt1aa	That is your decision but I do not see anything wrong with it.|`|76f80c73e4bfcb1026dd5ae2d1da3f18aa	no I hear what you're saying.  it may make the wedding night more exciting if the anticipation is built up for a month or more!|`|wMWfCjBpaa	I think it's a great idea! We became stronger Christians during our relationship so we no longer live together. We also have a 2 year old daughter. There will be no "lovin" until the wedding next January. We're getting married in church and I think it's appropriate to live that lifestyle. I love your thinking! There's going to be so much to look forward to once you're married. =)|`|sGP6s7uraa	Not dumb.  Anticipation can spice up things a bit, ya know?  Best of luck!|`|AA11100518	there is a reason you need this and asked him.  it's probablay because you want to emphasize and renew the sacredness of marriage and sex in marriage. it's not stupid.  you are yearning for something and this is an idea on how to get it.  abstinence can help people see things differently and appreciate what they abstained from.  i think it's a great idea but you have to talk to your fiance and explain how you feel and help him understand why you want this to be part of your marriage process.  good luck.  listen to his feelings too.|`|2f2338425d995c6d00e32cb38d57ee7faa	Makes no sense to me.|`|9a056324e084aa96722167b89dc65ce2aa	This is a good idea. Not only is it a traditional good luck thing, it will prove to you that he isnt just in it for the sex, and the opposite too.|`|jF3XaAwNaa	Well it might be a little more intense if you waited...|`|crFl8m26aa	If your purpose is to spice things up on your wedding night then it is not a silly question at all.|`|e5k8Bsxpaa	It's not dumb at all. It's creative!  Religious Jews don't have sex or even touch each other for two weeks out of a month, every month! This helps build anticipation and passion in the relationship. (Btw I'm not a religious Jew but I think this is interesting.)  In any case go for it.... Assuming your fiance is ok w/it!|`|29I8PWrxaa	If you already have sex, why hold off for a month before the wedding?  You are only going to end up fighting about it or giving into temptation.  Just ignore the people telling you to wait ... and it's not like any of your guests are going to be silly enough to think you are a virgin if you have a child, live together, and are expecting!      Personally, I wouldn't advise waiting til marriage to anyone even if they are virgins.  Sex is an important part of a relationship and intimacy.  How would you know if you are sexually compatible if you wait til your wedding night?  Why put so much pressure on each other on your wedding night to meet such high performance expectations?  Plus, I have yet to hear a logical explanation from anyone convincing me as to why it is "moral" or "righteous" to wait anyway - it used to be so that children were not born out of wedlock in a time when there used to be no birth control, and to limit the spread of STDs.  But we have all kinds of birth control methods now, and protection from STDs!  I do not believe in waiting til marriage necessarily, however I do think that women should share themselves with someone special.    Don't worry about conforming to other people's standards.  Your wedding night will be special no matter what because it will be the first time you are intimate as husband and wife.  Congratulations on the baby and the wedding, and please don't put your fiance through that!|`|n68tCJ7zaa	of course it's a good idea!  my and my boyfriend have sex now, but we have decided to stop once we get engaged until the wedding night.    this will be great because on our wedding night, we'll remember how much we love each other and how special our intimacy is to each other.    sex in marriage isn't about gratification and how "compatible" you are. it's about intimacy and love. and believe me, the best feeling sex is when you really love each other.|`|AA11961524	My fiance and I did that. We thought that it would make the wedding night really exciting and it did.|`|8p31dENPaa	When I get married, I'd like to go a month without sex. I think it makes it more special b/c we are already having sex.
a1566efb5533aa90596e330bc315a547aa	Don't get into the situation. Let it ride out!|`|racnq84Vaa	Your mom should be held accountable for choosing a penis over her children.  Plain and simple.  She slept with a man who violated your sister after she knew about it.  Talk about sick in the head.  Your mother is the one with the issues.  She needs professional help and she owes your sister more than an apology.  I wouldn't speak to her either.  No normal person would want to be around a woman who slept with their abuser AFTER he abused them and AFTER they were made aware of the abuse.  That is sick.  And the fact that you back your mom and make excuses for her just shows that you are in need of help to.  Your sister is right.  She is the only one holding your mom accountable.  You are so starved for love that you think it is okay and make excuses.  You need to butt out of your sisters business and get some help so you don't end up with your own screwed up love life.

iufAPDeWaa	Guys always want there cake and to eat it too! Tell him he's not getting free sex.. then going and sleeping with whoever he wants or dating whom ever. You have feelings too. And you never know, plenty of people break up and get back together unexpectantly. But if you're giving him everything he can get in a relationship why would he come back. He can just have you and live the single life too. Men are so selfish. And they'll continue to do whatever you are willing to allow. Tell him no sex and thats it. My boyfriend did the same thing when we broke up for a short while. But he didn't get any sex from me until we got back together. I don't play that!     Girl you know men mostly think with their other "head" ;)  People on here have given you good advice don't go out and do the opposite! You'll regret it. Like my mom always says... don't learn the hard way. Good Luck|`|7VfWz7zyaa	I'd say ignore him but judging by your Y.A name....   'lost without him' go riding with him, it doesnt have to lead to anything more... lol.|`|Q27cXlGbaa	do not have sex with him. the best thing is to just not see him or talk to him for awhile or youll never get rid of those feelings|`|UHc3Nvaqaa	k babe, well you kinda screwed yourself.  Upon hearing the title I was def gonna side with you but after reading that I cant help you.  No offense but you should have more self-control, alot more.  Ill catch you on next months Springer to see how it went, I already have an idea.|`|mzkfSwLwaa	How can you have sex with someone random but not him? Im glad hes not with you.|`|jbxGEdVbaa	First of all, The Hamburglar was quite impressed that you were able to fit your entire story without using a single puncuation mark to finish a sentence. Quite impressive. To answer your question, I don't think you should do it. It seems like your ex wanted to break up with you because he wanted the combination of smacking cheeks with you and getting some strange from someone else without all of the emotional babble mixed in. Unfortunately, you gave him a taste of his own medicine by smashing out one of his friends and not giving him any action. It was a brilliant move on your part even though you did it by accident through your drunken incoherance. I say you continue in the debauchery that you have been accustomed to which shouldn't be a problem since you have ALOT of guy friends. Kudos!    -You've just been sacked by The Hamburglar|`|Q2BvzUO5aa	well, commit your self. do not drink and do things like that.|`|yj7Nndilaa	don't give him the milk if he won't at least claim the cow. love yourself first and everyone else will want to also! good luck!|`|CSkd41ELaa	tell him to F*ck off|`|dOeE9GCcaa	If your having sex with him then the feelings are still gonna be there.. I wouldnt do it. You are just going to hurt yourself.|`|mmAjpMX1aa	What you do is ignore the loser.  Broken up means just that...broken up.  Meaning you no longer have any commitment to him whatsoever and are perfectly free to do whatever you like.  If he gets mad, that's his own damn fault.  If he's ranting and raving and acting like a child over your breakup, let him.  The guy's obviously got emotional issues and needs to learn better ways of dealing with them.  He's a person you need to avoid at all costs.|`|ahjqc9Ifaa	If you want to be to go-to girl for every horny guy you know, keep putting yourself in situations where your inhibitions will be lowered by alcohol or emotions, and you're alone with the guy or guys.    If you want to be a girl who's valued for who she is rather than how she'll permit guys to use her, change the way you act. Find something to keep yourself busy until a decent guy comes along.|`|hLWy1evQaa	Ditch him. You are not lost without him. It will suck for a while, but you will get over it. People are amazingly resilient if they just allow themselves to be.     You are extremely vulnerable to him because there are emotions involved. Luckily, you recognize he won't give you what you want, beyond sex. So just don't interact with him.     What you do with other guys is none of his business either. It doesn't detract from how you felt about him, and how much you're still hurting over him - hence the drunken rebound hookup with your guy friend. And you should tell him so if he ever brings it up. Tell him he lost the right to have any say over anything you do when ya'll broke up.     Don't go riding with him. Cry over him. Hang out with your girl friends, eat chocolate ice cream and boy bash. Hang out with your guy friends and let them make you laugh. But stay away from him and let the natural grieving/getting over him process occur. Before long you'll be wondering why you dated such a d**k in the first place.     Good luck!!|`|lsZDiqavaa	If he only want sex and you want more let him know how you feel. And if  he can't respect the way you feel he don't really care. And if you want more than sex you shouldn't have sex with him, Sex only complicate things. And you need to let him know that you are not going to settle for any less than you deserve. And everyone deserve to be with someone to love them for them,so if he want to change you he don't deserve you.Don't let anyone change you as the person you are, live for you not him if he can't except you as you tell him to build him a Robot,Cause people can't be programed. And if he want to change you he should change your last name and become one, and marry you.|`|9pYEHVHPaa	This guy broke up with you because he wants be available to other chicks, however he doesn't want you to have any freedom. What a loser!!! You just need to ignore him and forget him ASAP!! The more time you waste on this jerk, the more time you waste finding a guy who really cares.|`|8KGJj67aaa	Don't spend time with him. You know in your heart that he just wants sex, so tell him to go find it elsewhere.    You don't need to be his crutch. If he wants sex, he can go find some other woman to give it to him. He's not willing to give anything to you, so why should you help him out?    Don't let this jerk get one over on you. I say stay as far away from him as possible. You'll find someone that will want more than just your body and you will be grateful that you saved it for him.
AA12274507	You are 14. So in another four years you can do what you want. As long as you live with your mom, you do what she says. Simple as that!     Maybe when you are sixteen or so, some of the sanctions will be lifted. Until then you will have to deal with it. I know how I was when I was that age and now that I have my own daughter I can understand why parents are protective.     Being a Christian has nothing to do with wether you have sex or not. It has all to do with how determined your boyfriend is to have sex with you. Wether you like it or not.. Your mom is just looking out for you cause she loves you and don't want to see you screw up like so many other kids do..    Be an example not a statistic.|`|rOv1wowLaa	enjoy life do whatever u want, i mean come on sex is good just be responsible about it...and i know u say ur christian but that has nothing to do with not having sex, alot of christians do, but i know what ur saying, ur mom is one of those uncool parents who is way to protective and doesnt understand that in todays world once u are a teenager sex is a big part of life, but thats a option, ne way yes parents shouldnt be like that if u wanna date do it, if u wanna have sex do it, but use a condom...just dont be stupid by doing drugs and having a baby|`|AA10942089	She doesn't want to be a grandma. I can't blame her.    I think traditionally most girls start dating at 16 anyway.

Until the age of 18, you are legally a kid in the eyes of the law. She probably doesn't want you to date because of boys your age being immature and all these teen pregnancies and STDs. She doesn't want to see you ruin your life. There is plenty of time to date.|`|DcVoq5Tuaa	Nothing wrong with waiting. I agree with your mom age plays more into than anything else. I wasn't allowed do date until I turned 16 and that will be the same way for my daughter|`|a1566efb5533aa90596e330bc315a547aa	You are too young to be jumping into relationships.

d748d8e10f1d98d96305ada8117301ebaa	What nasty answers!  You have this responsibility heaped on you at far too young an age, and have put your own needs on hold.  Start teaching them independence and life skills.  Is there not another relative who will step in for a weekend to give you a break?  Give yourself a few treats for a change, I'm sure they are now old enough to cope for a few hours on their own.  You could ask a neighbour to pop in to see if they are coping.  I'm sure they will think you deserve a night out!|`|a1566efb5533aa90596e330bc315a547aa	Be mature and stay with them until they can support themselves.

UZxeBrxQaa	Lucky!    You are the female.  All you have to do is be there.  He'll take care of the details.  Just relax and don't tense up.    It's not humanly possible for a woman to "...do a really bad job" when having sex.  Even if you were dead when he finished, it would still be good for him.    That's part of our male charm!!!  We are SO easily pleased sexually!|`|7n4rtfp6aa	making love,not sex when your in love :)  He will be very gentle and supportive,as you have never done it before. Relax and enjoy it.... !|`|tOdjjeAmaa	It's a sucky feeling sometimes but will probably not come between you two. I'm married to my "first" and I was his first as well. But we broke up and both dated other people. When we got back together it was a little weird, and sometimes I still wonder if he compares me to someone else, but I don't let it get to me. He never talks about them and acts pleased with me lol. Not to mention once you get married you'll learn a whole lot and eventually you'll be really comfortable with yourself. Learn what he likes and do your best to do it. And he should do the same with you. Those thoughts will likely on occasion come into your head, but just remember sex is not everything in a relationship, and he obviously cherishes you!!|`|MT0gw2hmaa	Let him take the lead, he's probobly more worried than you are. Since now he has to worry about disapointing you.  Anyway, your new husband will only think of you, right now its probobly all he's thinking about.

It's make it all the more special .|`|WwCBomTMaa	Thankfully most guys don't have standards in this department. If you love this guy and he feels the same to you the experience will be wonderful for both of you. However, losing your virginity hurts so be prepared for that and ask your guy to be super gentle. Also, I do kinda agree with some of the others here. If you are getting married soon you should wait, it will make the experience even more wonderful.|`|L3byzh3Gaa	This is my advice. You should go and have sex with someone random; i mean someone you know, that wouldn't have STDs or anything like that and have a few practice rounds. Then I would have sex with this guy your about to marry. Do you really wanna be stuck married to a guy that sucks in bed? The same thing goes for this guy your marrying, do you think he'll stay with you for the long haul if you suck in bed? I am sorry to say this, but contrary to popular belief, sex does matter, and a bad sexual relationship will ruin your marriage.|`|hXQjnPuGaa	I agree with Bisop C. and B-luved.      But I totally understand if you're not willing to try either of their suggestions.  I'm a virgin too, and I would actually rather be with someone experienced. He'll be able to tell you what he likes, and all that. Be open to any suggestions of his, but don't do anything that makes you really uncomfortable. It will probably be painful the first time, and from what i've heard the first time is usually not very good for most people. But it will get better later.     I would just not worry about it. I'm guessing he knows you're a virgin, so he knows that he's the teacher, and you're the student, and he'll understand that I'm sure.|`|ad1b001dc05d77bbec05a443aa74ca50aa	He will have a sense of confidence from this, which is very key to a guy getting his erection.  You on the other hand have nothing to worry about.  It is easier to follow his lead than dancing.  Everything is easy.  Just don't rush it.  Don't rush into it or it will won't mean as much and one or both of you might not be ready, and not just maturity wise, but ecstatic and climax wise.  Don't rush through it either as a guy can climax easily and only once.  Spend lots of time kissing and caressing and work before, during, and after clothes are removed, working toward the sex or in just a few minutes you will realize what is meant by a quickie.  For that same reason, don't touch his member much.  Maybe a couple rubs on the pants before it is out and after it is out just one two finger stroke with the pressure as if you are turning a page in a book.  That will be exhilirating and anything more will decrease the time spent in actual intercourse.  Also, once you are into intercourse, you need to be more passive.  You can caress his back and kiss whatever is in front of you, but let him do the gyrations and pumping during intercourse or you will bend it and let me tell you that hurts!  If he has a steady rhythm, then you can match his thrusts with a few subtle ones of your own for more penetration.  To delay his climax, do not let him start too fast and maybe get him to make minor adjustments (leaning back a little, leaning up and forward a little, or turning a few degrees to the left or right) every half dozen thrusts to give each of you different sensations.  Some will be more pleasing while others will delay his orgasm.|`|fGE7hL12aa	If you are going for a ride, it's better if one of you knows how to drive.    Sex is actually a lot of fun, and you will get the hang of it right away. Because you two have never been together, it will be new for him too.|`|79F1VhEJaa	i think it will be okay, just as long you guys aren't marrying each other for sex or anything along those lines lol....Good Luck :)
vj2pOgT7aa	TALK to your boyfriend.  Show him exactly what you have written here.    Take a stand.  If he pushes ahead with this, refuse to move in with him.    =0)|`|k73IxCHaaa	You didn't indicate if you and your boyfriend are presently living together or not. If so stay put, if not, stay put. The situation he is putting you into could not only be annoying, it could also be dangerous. If your boyfriend doesn't see that, you may need to open his eyes.    This whole situation is a disaster waiting to happen, you need to be very careful and consider the choices you have to make. Love is one thing, survival is another.

AA10942089	I can't answer your first question without knowing what region you're in.    As for the second, a wedding is really a big ball of emotions, including stress. You'll probably have a few fights before it, but try not to take them personally.|`|76f80c73e4bfcb1026dd5ae2d1da3f18aa	I would go for the later date in Oct.  Sept may be too early for fall colors.  check an almanac or something to see when the average peak weekend occurs in cinci.  and your fiance is right, sometimes people go overboard and have a huge circus celine dion wedding and that's uncalled for.  donate your money to charity instead if that's the route you're going.  but it doesn't sound like you're doing anything that lavish so find out why he's being so tight all of a sudden.  maybe he lost $$$ in the stock market.|`|AA11100518	you need to talk about it a lot more - share your values and hopes and dreams and expectations, share what is important to you - ie  having food for guests - yes it shows off money but it also is hospitality to your guests...talk about how you see things differently.  you need to communicate more.|`|lYjweuZmaa	I think october is the best time.     yes ... im sure its normal for him to have occasional mood swings. weddings are stressful!!!    ;p|`|LxvA4vGpaa	I would go for October.      Yes, he will go through different emotions as well.  There will be some days when he is all about the wedding, and others where it is the last thing he wants to talk about.  Heck, I was the same way when I was planning my wedding and so was my husband.  Wedding planning is a very stressful process and there will be some days that he will resent it because it is taking time away from you two as a couple and it does feel like the real importance of the event is being lost in this favor or that decoration.  What might help is allot only certain times to talk about the wedding, that way it isn't consuming every single hour of every single day.  He may just be getting overwhelmed with it all, especially when it is all coming at once.|`|sGP6s7uraa	I think October would be perfect for an Autumn Leaves theme.  Moodiness with your man?  Comes with the territory.  They get just as stressed as we do.  Do what you can afford and leave it at that.|`|8xDOEr63aa	Either will be fine. You better decide quick because venues and vendors will be tough to find for either date.    The groom: When he says stuff like that get him to share his core concerns and frustrations and lend an understanding ear. Listen well and let him know he is being heard. He is not saying something about you or your relationship. He should be eager and willing to do the same for you. Such moments build great relationships much more effectively than a fancy wedding.    In the end, it's not irrational to call out some of the irrationality of weddings. Do you really need to blow $30,000 (ave. wedding cost) for what is essentially a party?     But you're only doing it once, so some of the hassle is worth it. He probably feels that way too.|`|M7CdgSNSaa	oct 10/09 is my wedding day.

As for men ...Who really understands them anyway...LOL  I wish you the best.  Congrats|`|ML1zkPibaa	Weddings nowadays - much like Christmas - are blown out of proportion.  It becomes a chance for one person's parents to show that they can throw a better and more expensive wedding for their daughter than another's parents.  In doing so, it loses the true meaning of two people dedicating their lives to one another.    So, in that respect, your fiance is correct.    Start off dreaming big about the wedding and then cut it down.  If you haven't spoken to Great Aunt Mildred in 10 years, is it really necessary to invite her?      Just be sure to compromise on some things that he wants.  He's probably not going to care what color the tablecloths are, but he might want to take control of the DJ's song list or the beer selection.  Find ways for him to help in the planning that don't involve doing the girly stuff.

If he will not go with you, go alone. It really sounds like he might be suffering from depression. Try getting him to talk about work, life, or just anything to see if you can draw him into a conversation and figure out what's wrong. A counselor can help you with that.|`|ByUS0k8waa	I would say if he wont go to counseling then you should tell him your going to leave and see what he thinks about that.

qYKQgR9Saa	You can't talk someone into something that they don't want to do.  You need to ask him if you can talk to him - just the two of you - and you need to tell him everything you want to say to him and then if he still truly wants a divorce there is ultimately nothing you can do or say to make him change his mind. Just make sure he knows that you are committed to the relationship and you want to make it work.  If he is not committed to that then honey you have to move on.|`|AA10199189	your marriage is dead, the best thing for everyone is a quick, decent burial.    listen to your head.  soothe your heart. do something xompletely different and enjoy your life.    if you actually got him into counselling he would likely dump all over you and still leave you.  are you ready for that?|`|F0LgeWs5aa	Find out if your state has a counseling clause for divorce.

Bottom line you can't make someone go to counseling but you can go and hope and pray he will come ...if there is no will or desire to stay in your marriage he won't come....Have you asked him if he still loves you?? has he said why he wanted a divorce?? if so what was the reason he gave you...has he done something stupid that he just assumes you'd divorce him for so instead of telling you he is doing the chicken s*** way..I have a friend whose ex husband cheated but was to scared to tell at the time so he filled for divorce and didn't give a really good reason...now years later he told her the truth...she spent years trying to figure out what she did to cause him to do this...nothing he was drunk and ended up sleeping with some girl at a bar....he only remembered waking up in a hotel room with a naked girl next to him and the girl trying to get him to do it again....I guess the point is ask some questions and read between the lines if need to....|`|AA10700334	I'm sorry.

Plus, if this man is a police officer he probably has a lot of stress at work. I would expect that he might lose his cool every once in a while.
wZvbotxtaa	I can understand your bf doesn't want his family to misinterpret your personality, however, he needs to back off and if anything for warn his family that you are a quiet natured person and it may take a minute for you to warm up to them.  I am the same way so I completely understand.  He was probably joking about drinking especially since he knows you dont drink..he's paranoid of what his family is going to think of you when in actually his concern should be how you will feel about them if anything.  Bottom line dont sweat it and dont let him stress you out.  Be yourself since thats all you can do anyhow and I guarantee his family will appreciate and respect you for it in the long run no matter how they feel abuot you initially...and if they dont then hey, its their loss!|`|2ve7ZbGVaa	first answer! :) and no one is going to read that|`|xVJMB280aa	Just be yourself.

Try not to hesitate and stumbling is fine.     The family should understand that you're meeting them for the first time. Shyness is expected. Don't worry! They'll be nice.|`|12xQlgr7aa	Some people aren't loud all the time, that shouldn't give them any assumptions. Just be kind, smile a lot, if someone talks to you make sure you look interested.

You don't need to be shouting to show them you're a good person. Good Luck :-)|`|83be5a2ec73f29b6ac458679572bbb6caa	Yeah i read it!    I think you should just be yourself. If you bf told you that they may not like you if you don't warm up to them quickly then screw them. I wouldn't make myself uncomfortable for anyone. Just go and be yourself and don't drink anything before you go. Unless they are just big jerks they are not going to give you a hard time of judge you quickly. remember your bf likes you enough to let you meet his family so I am sure they will like you too. Just be thankful if they are normal, my inlaws are crazy!  Good Luck!|`|tJDOt6fgaa	Well.. Your boyfriend must be really nervous because it's a huge deal for him, maybe that's why he's being such a pain... Tell him you'll do your best and ask him to STOP bothering you, you are not a 2 year old.     To make it easy for you, I suggest you to bake a shortbread or some cookies and bring them to the family's house, it'll break the ice and you'll be seen as sweet and shy rather than hostile...     You can ask your boyfriend what kind of cookies or breads they like so you'll be even more appreciated.  Smile as much as you can, pay attention to the one that's talking and ask a question every now and then, it has worked for me every time.    Good luck..!|`|HdUc2ZHgaa	RELAX- Be yourself. And just focus on being polite. If all else fails, just WOW them with good manners. Say please and thank you for everything. Also, be sure to write a thank you note after your visit. Remember, it is natural to be nervous, but  once you break the ice, you're in! And it's kind of like learning to ride a bicycle...At first you are shaky, then you eventually just hop on and peddle your way to the destination. If they have dominating personalities, just let them dominate. That way THEY feel comfortable. Remember to give them plenty of compliments on their home, on the meal (if any) that is served and even on their outfits. Don't go over board, just a sincere compliment. Don't take them for granted, because they might be nervous to meet you as well!!!!  If you are uncomfortable to have a conversation, ask them about themselves, their jobs, or HOW his parents met and fell in love. That is a good story usually! People usually love to talk about themselves...and if you are a good listener, you will be able to get to know them that way...BY LISTENING!        It sounds as if your BF is making you more nervous (He's probably nervous too!)  Just ask him quietly for his support. Maybe decide on a signal in advance just between the two of you, a subtle way that you could let him know that you need a little extra back-up. That way, he can come to your "rescue" if you really need it! Maybe he could offer to do something simple like just an arm over your shoulder or something, to remind you:  "He's got your back!" while you're in their environment!|`|JXppj7Z7aa	that's probably the same thing that happened to me when i went to my bf's house for the first time...on saturday he told me that his mother and g-ma thought i was slow because they asked me if i wanted to go to the store with them and i started laughing! im not used to ppl being nice to me especially when i dont know them. like im a nice person too i am a little bit shy...but it was just so unexpected for them to invite me like that especially without him going... but just be yourself and dont think about it too much. you know that you dont have a bad attitude and just do you.|`|Q0Cq3G2Taa	u know what i have the same nature as yours i am very very friendly but not with the people i have just met so just tell ur bf to inform his family that u r a little reserved and very imp do not forget to  smile this  will help u out|`|lKVQ6OXYaa	hey...its gonna be fine...i'm sure they are not judgmental...especially if they know that their son is into you...there must be a reason he likes u...u dont have to impress them...they will like u naturally cause their son likes u for a reason...let it take its natural course...believe in yourself...dont try too hard....take it easy...  i know meeting parents can be daunting...like the movie'meet the parents'.. but u'll be fine...and remember this night is not about you ..its about the house...so the focus is not gonna be on u too long...do what your heart tells u....dont go out of your way to seem friendly...u are who u are....be ok with it...go for it....it'll be smooth....u'll see...start with talking to the kids...it always works for me...kids are easy to get along with...and that will give u confidence as the night progresses...good luck...  :)|`|wqchA8B7aa	Just relax, smile, and let them know you're kind of shy (be honest - reserved and soft-spoken = shy).

There is nothing wrong with shy. just smile and chit chat! No biggie!|`|s30Duwdraa	Just be yourself.  Obviously your bf likes you the way you are, or he wouldn't be with you.      I'm sure his fam will ask you a bunch of questions... answer them politely and maybe add a little story that applies.  Or compliment his mom on something shes wearing, or her hair.  But be genuine about it.    Another thing you can do is offer to help with something.  Set the table, pick up dishes, serve coffee or dessert.. anything like that will be instant brownie points with a mom.    You don't necessarily have to talk a mile a minute to show your personality.    Good luck!|`|DgePrR9daa	be yourself|`|92yiQo7uaa	He's telling you to drink before meeting his family? Classy guy! How about telling you to smoke some weed too? This is going to go badly if it stays on the course it now is on as no one is relaxed and everyone is panicking. You are on a course for a fiasco.    The only solution is to not get a few drinks but to be yourself but I am not sure if that can happen with all the bad vibes around.|`|8bf22a7b300866a77ba08f820aaefdcaaa	I'm the same way. You don't have to be totally social. If someone asks you something, try to chat them up. Like "Where do you work?" don't just say "The grocery store." Tell them where you work, what you do there, and if you like it or not. Try to get a convo going.    He should...  1. Accept you as you are. If he doesn't like you for being shy and can't get over it, he needs to find someone else.  2. Not care what other people think of you. You will warm up to his family and they will warm up to you. It takes time - he needs to understand that.|`|b7WEVGzXaa	hm thats pretty tough   i would just be your self  if you are goofy and silly with your boyfriend   be like that  i was shy at first too but   just dont think about it too much cause it will stress you out more and then youll end up trying to be something your not and say or do something wrong  just relax :)
6c1639b085f1a5fa992d7054377ac71faa	the only way to find out is to ask them.  However, if I were in your shoes I would just not visit them so often.

You don't have that much in common as the others.  The others are 'family' like and you aren't.    I used to be 'you'....My family revolved around my sister and her kids.  I didn't get the same recognition as she did.  Same with hubby who never had kids until the age of 38.    Just the way it goes.
0rpN2419aa	I don't know why your mom would even bring up the fact that one necklace was from Tiffany's and the other from argos, however, if she shows love and care for you otherwise, let it go.  It isn't worth getting upset and dwelling on it and I wouldn't let it hurt my relationship with my mom or sister,  We nerver know about when life might end, but you don't want angry thoughts about your mom and feel regret if something unexpected happens.  Smile, be happy.  They way you treat them will be returned to you.|`|AA10199189	no  it is not right that it upsets you    you should be happy with the gift and not try to find out whether a person with whom you compete - sister - got something "more valuable".    if you can't get over this, seek some counselling.|`|EKqbfJFKaa	no it should not. that is something really petty. after your mom passes, you will regret all these little petty things you were upset about. i say forget about it and only thank her for getting you anything at all.|`|hK2ix05faa	no it shouldn't that just being jealous
mxtWuadraa	I have exactly the same problem!! I'm 15, and shy, although not very! I find it soooo hard to perform, or even just pick up the phone!!! My heart starts pumping away and I almost feel faint! I do the same: i'm always imagining scary situations that make my heart pump like hell!! it freaks me out, but when i went to the doctors for a normal check up, he said my blood pressure was fine!! To be honest, I think that it is probably just a thing that shy people, or people with low self esteems have! (i have an incredibly low self esteem! =S) It even happens when I'm just slightly angry, or excited about something, to the point where everything starts swimming in front of me and i can't focus on anything. It's really scary, but i think it's just something we have to work through!! I know that's easier said than done...     I have been trying something though.. every time something sets my heart racing I close my eyes (even if it's just for a split second) and take a really big breath and let it out slowly and smile! I know this is hard, but I have found it's easier than when i first started! And the good thing about it is that you can do it anywhere! When someone calls your name, you can do that little exercise! it helps with me, so maybe you should give it a go!     I hope I've helped you realise that you're not the only one out there with this issue! I don't think it's anything physically wrong, i think it's more mentally. Breathe, smile, and maybe try and use other things to take your mind off of things, like music, or reading, or anything that you can get absorbed into!!    Good luck, and i hope i helped!!!! =D|`|YFqUGRuGaa	Hey Kid,  You need to boost your confidence... nothin else...

Using upper case letters to begin a sentence or show a proper noun.    It's a start.  And I'm serious.    You are all over the place.  I bet right now you have twenty thoughts in your head, going off like firecrackers.  You're guessing at things BEFORE they even have a chance of becoming real.  Like trying to know the score of a game before the players get on the field.    You say you are shy but you are going on a stage and singing/acting.  Shy people don't get that far.  Shy people don't even TRY something like that.  I don't think 'shy' is your problem.    How do you eat an elephant?    ONE bite at a time!    It's impossible to stop thinking.  Just can't be done.  Even in your sleep your mind is chewing things over.  So what to do?    Try this. Just for a minute or so... okay, 5 or 10 seconds.    Set up a rope line, the kind you see at trendy nightclubs or on TV where the bouncer cracks wise to the LawnOrder cops and gets roughed up.  Forget that, just think of the rope line.    Now.  Line up all your thoughts, the ones trying to get into your head all at once.  MAKE THEM line up!  Only let one in at a time (couples okay if they are reeeely connected.) I know, that thought is going to seem lonely and you WILL have other thoughts saying how unfair you are.  Tough it out.    Examine that ONE thought.  Give IT all your attention.  When you're sure it's okay (not packing a gun or selling X), then move on to the next thought.  Point is, make them stay behind the rope and not rush you all at once.    Pretty hard to do, right?  And silly, to boot.  So let's try a more mundane approach, one that actually works.  Seriously, this really DOES worlk.    Go back to your long 'question'.  Take each sentence and give it a capital letter.  When that sentence is done, put a period after it.  Leave two (count em) two spaces between each sentence.  Arrange the sentences into paragraphs where sentences about the same topic or idea or subject can get together.  At the end of these paragraphs, write one (maybe two) sentences that sum up what you wanted to say and ask the question that is on your mind.    By doing this, you slow your thoughts down.  Each thought becomes the center of YOUR attention.  Each thought has a chance to be recognized and understood before you move onto the next sentence which contains the next thought.  And by doing this (arranging your thoughts) you will be able to evaluate them and put them in an order of importance.    This is good exercise for your brain and after awhile will become habit.    Now.  If you have read this far that's in your favor.  Even if you think I'm full of apple pan dowdy you've shown some needed discipline.  And discipline is what your thinking needs right now.      I can't tell from what you've written just what you're problem is.  I suspect you might not know either. So if for no other reason, you should do what I advised above.  Send me a draft (scepticalbear@yahoo.com) and let me see it.    Or maybe this is just the fad way of writing that all the Tube/Face crowd is doing.    skep, who thought  for a long time that 'grammer' was his dad's mom.|`|naequcqlaa	It honestly sounds just like you're having anxiety attacks.  That's exactly how one reacts when you have one.  I for one know, as I had it but now am on a medicine for it.  I really had it bad tho.  One thing you can do when you feel it coming on, is take the deepest breath you can take.  Then let it out slowly to the count of 10.  Do this a few times, & you can actually feel your body relax.  PLUS, you're not thinking of the "problem" either.  Try it even w/o feeling that way & just see how much it does help relax your body tho.  I seriously think that's just what it is tho.  Best to you...:)|`|EVtLlSEwaa	First of all, it would really help if you used punctuation. It was hard to read that.     But, it probably isnt a physical health issue. It sounds like you have a social anxiety disorder. I dont have a degree in this field, so dont just diagnose yourself or think I am saying that is what you have for sure. But it might be a good idea to see a psychologist or something. I have anxiety and it really sucks, but if you work at it, it can get better.    Good luck.
rnL04k7waa	Just pay attention what he telling and suddently kiss him on his lips.|`|oZpqEdI7aa	Try doing something to your hair, wear something that will catch his eye(I mean nothing that will overdue it of course), be more passionate, tell him something special, and the one thing i always enjoyed and came to me as a surprise with my girl was when she would say: "I love you"-but only if your really into him|`|dbd851f4fb33947f044b04f172364a39aa	Make him something.  My Boyfriend and I (who have been together since 2002) were only dating for about a week and I got a picture of us developed and bough a small frame for it.  I put it under his seat in his car when he wasn't in there and called him later and told him to check it.  I put a sweet note in the back and he still has that picture and frame today.    Do something that he wants to do that you normally wouldn't want to do.  Go see a horror flick, or go to a game for a sport that he likes.  Take just a little more interest in him.    You don't have to get sexy clothes and stuff to make him speechless.  Sometimes doing some thing that they would least expect is enough to make them speechless.|`|k1FenuRLaa	bake him cookies. but that is so corny|`|UVeT0nmTaa	buy him something you know he will really like and tell him you bought it to say thank you for just being him|`|tMON93tnaa	Take him out to eat at a classy restaurant.

It's time to man-up!  Peace, Prosperity and Responsibillity!|`|k73IxCHaaa	It is legally required, once the father has been determined.

You're right dude. Women are all like that. They lie, cheat on you, then try to blame you for their actions. Women will not accept responsibility for their actions.     Women say that not all women are "like that", but they are lying. It makes them feel better about themselves, like they are good when they know that they are not.    Forget church and the hypocritical Christians. Just be selfish. Live for today, because you don't know what tomorrow brings.|`|GOvZ1wi0aa	No there is nothing wrong with that but mabe you should try to get your life put back togather before you get into a relationship some girls are like that but honestly not all are. your not in jail so take a vacation save up some money and go somewhere FAR far away and stay as long as you can. your just at one of those hard times in your life just dont let it get to you. but take a break from it all it will get better.|`|9UoG75b1aa	let me be real mean and say stop whining. yes u had **** happen to u more than u deserve. but all women aren't b*&^%$s like u seem to have dated.

Go slow, learn to read people. Don't let people take advantage of you.|`|p9t9mzuraa	A woman, no matter if she is your soulmate or a goddess, could ever pull you out of your current state. Suicide, or the feeling of having absolutely no place to turn, is entrapping you - and no woman can ever be that kind of saving grace. Women have become only one of your issues - and I know its hard, but you gotta forget about that for right now. All I can say is - focus on you, yourself - examine yourself and who you are. If you don't like what you see....you can either wait till you get the pitiful need to end it all or do something about it.  What is it that is so important to you that you feel that you can't loose it? You could loose your life in a second from now, does it really matter in the end? Does it? Examine yourself.  With love, Jen.|`|besndn9laa	"I man without a plan shall perish", (The Bible).  You need to focus on you.  Treat yourself and have social friends stop looking for someone to whine to all the time.  Depression loves companionship therefore deal with your angry in another way like walking or jogging.  Get a pet.  There is something in your life that you can manage therefore start with that.  You are not the only person by yourself; if you want friends then they are out there.  This society of people has worst problems then yours.  What I am trying to say is change your attitude on life for you.  Change your appearance, cut & dye your hair, because this is the new you.  You have to love yourself before anyone else can love you.

I broke up with my boyfriend, and then he asked out my best friend, and she said no. But after that, he found out that I still liked him, now he wants to go out with me, but I don't want to 'cause of my friend, but we [my boyfriend and I] love each other; we were making out today after lunch. When I came back to my class my friend that likes him was acting weird and she wasn't talking to me, what should I do? I love this guy a lot, but I don't want to hurt my friend or lose her but I can't get that guy out of my head; when I kiss him I feel butterflies in my stomach, I really need help. I think she found out and right now I feel like crying but I don't want to...But to the people that answered my question before she is a good friend at times, she's let herself get caught with this bullshit my two-faced friend tells her and I think they keep talking crap behind my back (And sometimes I hear them for myself), so please people, help me!    I think your friend is a horrible and jealous person, and you should just go with your instincts. If your friend is being so obnoxious and pathetic over a boy, dislocate yourself from such a person.|`|8DDK2K5baa	oh my GOD    spell out words, please!    diz, plz, wit, dnt, yu, nd.    it makes it impossible to read|`|esGTdnC0aa	First things first, learn english    Second thing ask your question in english and shorter|`|NEH7JWNMaa	You should be arrested for raping the english language.|`|pgJ9lvyMaa	You know, you should stop making out with boys, and start paying attention during English.

AA12268495	You say you have booked a registry office ceremony at 1:45pm. Are all of your guests attending the ceremony? If so, is there a way you can do a receiving line & greet them after the ceremony? That usually takes up quite a bit of time. If you offer cocktails & some appetizers between 3pm &4:30pm ~ you & your husband arrive at the reception site in time for dinner at 5pm, that really isn't that long for guests to wait. Just be sure to include on the invitation the time that cocktails will be served & the time that dinner will be served, so guests know how long their wait will be in advance. If you want to save money ~ rather than a full open bar, just offer wine & beer. Save the champagne for when you arrive.     I have been to some wedding with a 3 hour wait in between the end of the ceremony & the start of the reception (and that doesn't include the wait for dinner once the reception started!) Yes, a long wait does suck ~ but most people have come to expect it. I think everyone understands that the couple plans time for pictures, etc. between the ceremony & reception.     Whatever you decide, be sure to include full details on the invitation so everyone knows what to expect. Best of luck to you :)|`|76nTvO4iaa	If you estimate that the people are going to arrive at the venue at 3 p.m., why not have an early dinner?     You can have drinks & appetizers from 3-4 and then serve the evening meal starting at 4 p.m.  That way you won't have your guests looped for the meal and will finish early so hubby and you can have more alone time on your wedding night.|`|58EydBwwaa	An open bar is always entertaining.|`|AA12041870	Let them entertain themselves.  It's going to be your wedding day.  They should respect the fact that they are there to see you get married.  They can have a few drinks, a little dancing, and talk amongst themselves.|`|QzWHMGHJaa	People aren't going to hang around waiting all that time!  You need to schedule it better so there isn't so much of a gap between events!  Why are you getting married so early when your dinner isn't til 5 or 6?  That's just crazy!  Make the wedding later in the day so guests can go directly to the reception!|`|26cae2932c19d290ec2e4570f9542e0baa	You can't. Guests don't like gaps and you will have some people skip one or both events for that reason.|`|lcj1AKt1aa	If the reception is for 5 or 6 they should not be there at 3. Nevertheless, you can buy some beers and the men will drink them while the women will drink wine, juice or sodas.  That is the norm here in Barbados.|`|jF3XaAwNaa	I personally would have people come at about 4:30 or 5:30 if its a six. Just let people know thats when the reception starts. People are going to be hungry and not want to hang around for hours without eating..|`|C2h2f4cdaa	When people arrive at 3pm make sure there is alcohol, soft drinks and light canapes available. There should also be some music (possibly a live band) to liven things up.    With the above elements most people will happily entertain themselves.    Best wishes
uBssj3Znaa	he doesn't text you as much because you have a boyfriend. Yes, he probably thinks you are a hoe and yes he probably lost interest after the first time you had sex with him but definitely after he found out your are also an unfaithful person who apparently will give it up whenever.|`|rNdun1V7aa	yup. it's all about the chase. your too easy. he's probably chasin another tail now. that's just how guys are. (wow you have really really high self-esteem heh?)    *-I am very beautiful, smart and popular vs. he's not too attractive but well known for his great bball skills (your loose and stuck up also.)|`|AA12109238	i think it was when u told him u had a man.. that just kills it all. no matter how pretty u are,|`|58EydBwwaa	A hook-up can become something more, but a booty-call never will. You sound like a forthright, honest girl who knows what she wants and does it. That intimidates men, which is probably why he stopped texting.|`|92yiQo7uaa	What is he supposed to do when after you slept together you told him you had a guy!|`|LA5VwAvIaa	He thinks ur a ho cuz you are.    He thought you were pining for him and maybe looked at him as a catch --  then he finds out that he may have got sloppy seconds that night.... NICE ONE SCHIBOTZKY !   LEGENDARY !    If he wants anything to do with you it is as a recepticle for his load.  Which you have probably become acustomed to....|`|pgJ9lvyMaa	You can't call your self a decent girl if you are cheating on your boyfriend and using this guy for sex.  That's not a cool thing to do. He doesn't text you because he got what he wanted, and he's over it.  He probably does think that you are a hoe, and no guy really wants a relationship with someone like that.|`|X9cGsOq8aa	did you just say you were a preety decent girl? cuz if you did your worng! how can you be having sex with him and then telling him its just sex!and then you have a man!  yeah he may think worng of you and is trying to forget you!  ugh COCHiiNa!!!  PS:now he prob lost interest in you because bow he knows your unfaithful and youll give it up easy!|`|AA11706291	He sees you as he's f buddy, nothing more nothing less and he won't text so much anymore because he's not emotionally involved with you and sounds like he doesn't particularly want to be.|`|Y1ZBFcvsaa	Sound like you just liked his b-ball skills!|`|DtcuaIWmaa	He probly doesn't like the fac. that you didn't tell him you have a man back home and doesn't want to be a 3 wheel. And the fac. that you cheat on your man|`|Y7ZSaTOtaa	You will not like this answer but its the truth and the only way I know how to say it! Been there, done that.  This is what I think and this is also what he probably thinks! I had this EXACT instance happen to me minus the drunken sex part and I was more infamous than popular. My school was small but nonetheless EXACT with everything else hunny.      You are a bootycall, that is all you are and that is all you will ever be.  if he really liked you he would not have had sex with you and asked you out to be his gf first then proceed to the rest.  The fact that you have a bf already is pretty lame.  I mean now that he knows you have a man or when he finds out he def will not want to chill as much but he still may want to have sex its a physical attraction thats all it is.  He will not have interest in you because you have made it way too easy for him to hook up with you.  You are no longer challenging and once a guy has conquered the chase he moves on to a new one.  He hasnt texted you as much because he has lost interest but he still will continue to have sex with you because of the physical attraction.  If you are beautiful it is a boost to his ego to be with you in a physical sense plus you are popular so thats a boost for him in that way.  Its shallow but true.  Sadly  that is all it sounds like it is.  Does he think you are a hoe? I am not sure, I dont think he thinks you are a hoe unless he tells you or decides to drop you altogether out of nowhere.  Once the chase is gone, its hard to seem interesting to him.      You need to move on.  And if you do not believe what I have said try NOT hooking up with him and see if he wants to still hang out with you. My guess is he probably wont because thats all he is interested in.  Try bringing up a relationship but dont be too overt because it will scare him off or at best he may say he doesnt want it now but maybe in the future etc and so on.  You need to move on and find someone who has an interest in you, your mind, spirit and soul not just your body! Value yourself more hun.|`|hLWy1evQaa	Well, I would say, as a general rule, it's best to assume that once you've given it up, the interest will only last as long as you continue to have sex with him. I would not expect anything beyond a booty call or friends-with-benefits type of deal.     Now, I don't know this guy. Doesn't really seem like you know him well either, so I would apply that rule. But he may not be like that. The question is, do you want him to like you? I would also venture to ask, why are you sleeping with him if you have a boyfriend? (Not judging, just posing questions you should ask yourself). Would you want a relationship with this guy if he were to offer it?     Once you ask yourself those questions, and figure out where YOU are at, go from there. If it's just sex and you don't care if he likes you, don't worry about it. He'll tell you if he wants more. If it's more than sex, you might consider breaking up with your boyfriend. Keep in mind though, that this booty call knows you're cheating on your boyfriend and may or may not be interested in a known cheater.|`|TyLBzdOnaa	aye been there myself, I'm a guy btw, well I've been the guy in a situation like that. best friends with this girl since high school in college still friends but shoot I guess I had more feelings than I was willing to admit. So she gets a bf she keeps flirting to me and kissing me. While I never took it more than just kissing because I didn't want to get more emotionally attached to her.    sometimes I would stop talking to her because well I did like her a lot and reason for not talking was because I wanted to move on since she had a bf.     Long story short it didn't work out that way she'd come to my house see why I wasn't answering her calls we'd make up we ended up having sex several times I fell more for her. I guess you could say I love her but in the end I told her bf what we were doing and she stopped talking to me and she is still with her bf haven't seen her since a year now they are still together.       Maybe he does like you and needs time to think it over since you have a bf. some of us guys don't just want to be a booty call..O_o same as girls don't want to be just a booty call either.|`|WQkNgof5aa	Simply put, he thinks you might be good for a lay. If he had a reason to want to be in a relationship with you before, you messed it up when you slept with someone else when you were in a relationship already.|`|oVCjgL1taa	Guys don't like to be shared. try to stick to one guy at a time >.|`|T2ffyx5Waa	He thinks yu are a hoe ... yess   And he dont wanna get beat upp     Duhhhhh x|`|oZpqEdI7aa	I personally think what you did was wrong, and maybe that could be going through his head as well|`|cq4ng6QLaa	Maybe he doesn't want to be the olther man he wants to be your man and not share you. Then what you told him was knida like a insult you said it was just sex. He proably really liked you and wanted to get to know you. So he may have figured if you have a boyfriend why waste his time. I think he moved on.|`|pGjD5TTxaa	ha, look he likes your booty...if he like you for you he wouldnt be a booty call he would be your boyfriend , come on lights off no conversation at least not one you have to remember...your convienient   and there's no weird silence you know what he came to do...do think too much into it...|`|m6x72zgqaa	You pretty much already said no to romantic interest but gave  him a blank check more or less for meaningless sex whenever  he wants (and others are busy).  a lot of guys aren't as easy with  the hoe word as girls are-however he does know that you aren't  faithful to your present boyfriend so why would you be with him- what you are is convenient and fun.|`|49eca06e2ee9d5ec20ff9ad5786b073aaa	I am not understanding what the problem is.  You wanted "just sex" and that is what you get, why are you asking for more?  I do understand that life can get busy and the only thing one has time for is "just sex" especially since some men are not boyfriend material but they do make good sex partners.  Reevaluate what you are doing--this guy may be only good sex but nothing more.  Good Luck!|`|tS0N6zQVaa	how in gods name will a decent girl have sex with a guy she has not been dating for long u dont even know if he has AIDS or any adnormal stuff like cough staph infection etc am sure u guys did not use condom|`|qegWdsNLaa	Does your guy know about this sex on the side?  Is he okay with it?    If not, then I question your contention that you're a pretty decent girl, and this guy probably does too.  If so, then did you explain that to him?    He probably isn't as interested because he knows you have a boyfriend.  Maybe he doesn't like being involved in cheating.  Even if your boyfriend knows and is okay with it, he might not be comfortable with that situation.
vj2pOgT7aa	You should talk to him and let him know your feelings and that he hurt them.  This was a mean comment.    =0I|`|AA10106002	I'm guessing your response to his statement will keep it from happening again. Pretend it never happened and see what happens.|`|eG5W05Pbaa	LOL, chill out he was prob just having a joke around. i can see why you took it the way you did, but make up|`|oojO4WAraa	He probably thought he was being funny.  That cmment isn't as degrading as it could be.  I can understand why your feelings were hurt though, after working on dinner and being sweet, and then the little jerk insults you.  It was very insensitive of him.  He should realize you might be even MORE sensitive now since you are without a job and all.     Don't let it get to you too much.  He was just being stupid and probably didn't really intend to hurt your feelings and sound like an *ss.|`|EevMUAqJaa	He was just joking. Clear the air and let him know calmly that you got upset.  It's no use finding someone else over. Someone near and dear to your heart only comes around every so often. :)    Rachel|`|VSCYTZ38aa	Maybe he was trying to be funny? I've noticed that when men try to be funny on purpose, it can sometimes come out as either really stupid or completely inappropriate.|`|X4U36dHzaa	it was rude to say that,but he probably was mucking around don't take it to heart,LOL,you read in to it to much.  dont worry about suck it up!  im sure his package doesn't smell like roses either!|`|hmhrHqD1aa	That was a bit rough. Tell him how you feel, that it was very upsetting and your just need a friend to get you through this depressed period of your life|`|a1566efb5533aa90596e330bc315a547aa	Ignore him.|`|04a31323aa0674874fbc03558306d39eaa	just have a word with him about it, tell him exactly how you feel. It would make you feel better to say it than what advice we give you on here.|`|JAXziu1baa	he was probably hinting at what he wanted to do later in what he thought was humorus way|`|U5IigAByaa	he is very rude and insensitive..you must make it clear thats not acceptable. stick up for yourself, don't just give in for an easy life|`|gF6LRuP1aa	I think the question we would all like the answer to is, was there any truth in his comment?|`|hHndD5SEaa	ok it WAS a bit insensitive, but Im sure he meant it as a joke so I dont think its worth falling out over!!  xx|`|rftEZA50aa	Find a new partner is my advice|`|1qZuIk70aa	That is very rude, I'd be upset too. You should just break up with him if hes willing to be so insensitive when he knows that comment is obviously going to hurt you. If he loved you, why would he hurt you?|`|8ut0e6BDaa	poor you, that was really mean. try and explain how much he hurt you.  without it accelerating into a row.|`|MfSSEoxmaa	god,that would have really nagered and upset me...men eh?no respect for our efforts.im sure youll get him back if he cooks!!!dont take it serously.just make him learn his lesson and refuse to cook!!!|`|6Ur0KEHQaa	Lighten up. He's only having fun. If you dont have a sense of humour you're gonna make your life seem worse...just dont take yourself to seriously :)|`|PVSmchW8aa	thats disgusting hun...what a d**khead|`|AA12057913	i feel ur pain that was abit mean- tell him how u feel n u wont tolerate it|`|LbyRB4qhaa	I think you have every right to be upset by this. Of course it depends on how he said it in a jokey way or seriously. Although it's not really funny if it was a joke. Men just don't know where the line is in these kind of things. As they're used to talking like that amongst themselves.|`|uu8DPp59aa	He was probably having a joke, men are always like that.   But still that was a very insensitive to say that to you. How dare he.   Sit him down tonight and explain how upset it made you when you'd spent all that time making his meal and he comes along and makes a comment like that. Try not to let it escalate into a row though.   Good lock  Nina x|`|KqIDH7oVaa	oh dear you are sensitive, i call my other half '' halibut '' but she is a laugh a minute. and i wouldnt call her that if she was remotely sensitive. I would imagine he was only joking with you, it may need you to explain how deeply he hurt you, and if he doesnt respond with warmth and regret, you could call him a name along the line of names of cheeses, like stilton knob.|`|d6tu9AGUaa	What's good for him is good for you...wait til you get some friends around, get out a few nibbles and some vino....as you go grab a cocktail sausage say 'oh look...looks like your d**k'    Bet he'd think twice before he opens his mouth to you like that again.     ;-)|`|QIwhMrBraa	if you are the sort of woman who ends her question with 'any abusive answers will be reported immediately' then no wonder u are where u are    run screaming, everyone, i smell a bunny boiling|`|x7sOwhNdaa	maybe it does?  jk {=  but if he did maybe he was having a bad day at work and needed to joke around, or wanted to maybe take it out on someone.  let him cool down and ask him,   sulkin is the WORST way to solve anything,  you both dont talk,   and the problem isnt solved,  and your relationship is put on the line over a possible missunderstanding.  ask him, be the bigger person,   and if you tell him it hurt you [but be tactful and NOT defensive]  he'll probably apologize and make it up to you too!

pgJ9lvyMaa	I think it's disgusting.   We all call them "Girl pants".      Look, my advise to any guys who care, wear pants that fit.  Not ones that you have to belt around your *** to stay up, and not ones that hug every "mancurve".  No matter what you think, it's gross, and all us older girls are laughing at you.|`|NAqfPvmHaa	no!skinny jeans and men do not go well together!!!leave something to the imagination!!|`|BtKTJwTnaa	No....|`|oNmgW1Ukaa	i love wearin my skinny jeans. me n my bff both sport them!|`|owGsQdYraa	Love it!|`|hrHG1aVxaa	noo|`|28150f85aa74b0c749419bb1358d012eaa	I guess yes if the overall look is alright and if the jeans really do flatter his figure.

bqEohNXHaa	well, i'd kinda have to say yes.  guys are just like girls, but more masculine.  and we all have feelings.  but i understand that guys do more the heart breakingg.  i would just think of it both ways.  if a guy or girl would lead me on, i'd do the same and then just forget them completly to let them know how it feels.|`|Utd1VOJCaa	if he is a real "party type" then he should be ok and looking for the next girl to party with|`|ChumKhP4aa	yeah...|`|ZOTw9XMmaa	ummm yea it would but he has to say it cool cus yall werent together|`|26197953794d6971c6f12cc73f471d5faa	yeah but he would pretend he wasnt|`|12xQlgr7aa	That is so grammatically incorrect. confusing.

I don't suggest it.|`|tMsCXngvaa	yeah but thats a bad situation to be in|`|cFktUueyaa	Nope, if he's a party guy, then him and his friends know the rules. Pass the ho around, Pimp Rules|`|wmtbNdO0aa	Yeah, it sounds like you're leading him on.|`|3Zqc29ueaa	I guess after making out with you she realized you weren't the guy for her, is it normal feeling jealous because she's into all your friends, of course its normal, forget about her and move on, she sounds like a flirt, if she's into flirting with your friends you'll never trust her anyway, some girls just want to see how many guys they can snag its like a game, but it's a game with no winners.|`|TYgQHhThaa	yes guys are just like girls but i dont get like that am not the jealous type but guys get really mad|`|hbrpRysjaa	yeahh???!!!|`|pZevjTXGaa	a guy would get jealous, guys have feelings too just like females.

Some guys would get jealous then other guys would be like rght on. HIgh fives all around. If you know the guy gets jealous easily then he probably would get jealous because of that.|`|UOIvSlgcaa	My guess is yes, and I asked my husband and his response was OH God yeah|`|bcZo6CUGaa	definitely
cwsYM2F4aa	Wow.  You really screwed the pooch this time.  And you better tell your girl.  Because if I know women (and I'm pretty damn sure I do), the other girl is going to start thinking about what happened and get really mad and bitter towards you since you aren't with her anymore and she had to get an abortion because of you, and she's going to tell your girl for you.    Mark my words.  I recommend telling her now because if you don't someone else is going to.    Plus, it really is only fair that she know and has the right to decide whether she can stay with you after this.  You can't blame her if she decides to leave.  After what's happened, would you stay with you?|`|SLeX0gGaaa	haha that's what you get. and yeah you should tell her she will find out eventually. Might as well tell her rather than her finding out from someone else. She would probably be even madder if you don't tell her and she finds out.|`|JJ70xdpKaa	its better if you tell her than her finding out from another person..|`|cZjpPuPLaa	If you want an open and honest relationship, then you should let her know.    If you truly love her, you won't hide things from her.|`|uKFgRHeqaa	yeah, that would be good.|`|biKMQ2I1aa	wow, you're a catch....use a condom|`|4npjIcPaaa	no. that would just make things worse. you'd only have to tell her if she's going to have the baby, but she isnt so dont tell her|`|872fcc76954a83920779a9df510b118baa	DEFINATELY; TELL HER EVERYTHING!!!|`|glAfpnVkaa	i wouldn't unless your *** beat because if you were MY boyfriend i would never talk to your sorry butt again...that's right, mhhhhm|`|TJiGs8S4aa	Between your first question (5 minutes ago!!), and this question, the "other girl" now knows she is pregnant and has changed her mind from having the kid and is now having an abortion?!!    I really doubt the whole pregnancy situation, assuming that anything you have said here is bona fide.  I think she is just trying to manipulate you into leaving your gf and being with her.  Sounds desperate.|`|feb0df556be60b6ae1592e3a13327aedaa	Nope|`|5rKxG62Paa	Only if you don't want her|`|GUVxGNMqaa	No, but you should stop cheating!|`|dMGNPyCgaa	Never, and if she finds out, deny it.|`|VvKJUCYgaa	If you really feel that you should tell her, then tell her.|`|mYA7rbIwaa	YOU ARE EVIL!|`|CkSHu8Ooaa	Tell her! You cannot have a relationship with some thing like that going on. You need to be honest and open and you will feel better. You need to communicate. Your girlfriend should be happy your open and honest and if she isn't well then at least you were honest.|`|rfIQ2UTGaa	yes or she'll never see you as the same person again. Also why did you cheat on her in the first place? If your with her then only be with her not another girl at the same time. But still tell her, don't keep anything from her.|`|ecb4d1d52882fea6727c1028e33601b4aa	the right thing to do is tell the truth, because it may come out later.  If it was me I would take it to the grave|`|iVLSc5owaa	haha thats quite the situation.    do NOT tell your girlfriend... infact do everything in your power to ensure she never finds out... better "eliminate" the other girl for good measure.|`|kX7PSvBSaa	yes and ur an idiot|`|mRDwsQcEaa	No... why does she need to know that the other girl is having an abortion???? I'm all for honesty, but really, that means nothing to her. I think it would hurt her, and she'd think why the f*** do I care? I dont want to hear anymore about things that involve you and her...     Second, your name....? Are you just a jerk or what? I think you need to change your attitude toward women and toward the role sex plays in your life... it should be a positive thing for everyone... you're abusing it.     When you cheat, you are CHOOSING to be an absolute POS. That's lame.|`|Vlkcfgn0aa	Oh wow your in deep ****. Sorry just dont cheat, its trashy. I would tell her, girls like it when you feel guilty, just make sure you stress the fact that your sorry. Also it will let her know that your in the relationship and she might start trusting you again. Oh and i sugjust listening to the song Confessions by Usher. It will help.|`|PumDOQC9aa	IF YOUR A REAL MAN WON'T YOU TELL HER. IF SHE FINDS OUT ON HER OWN. YOUR BE IN SOME DEEP **** .|`|uzJmQdIAaa	You really should be more responsible and not let this girl have the abortion. People who can't take care of a baby should not be having sex in the first place. You could at very least give it to a family that cannot have children that want them, and you should be the person to convince her of this. Many people can't have children and you are just throwing yours away?    I can't stand this irresponsible world we live in today. Abortion just gives sluts an easy way out, and guys like you, a reason not to care about who they have sex with.    When a man murders his pregnant wife he gets charged with 2 murders. Have fun being an accomplice to this "legal" murder. you will only have god to answer to in the end, and there is a special place reserved in hell for cheating baby killers.|`|4LSrx8L0aa	huhee. well good luck with that.|`|YyiTGyuwaa	yOU HORRIBLE PERSON|`|hnCDmgyEaa	NO only tell her if the other girl decides on keeping the baby.|`|T2Wtd2Evaa	yea u should. fag!|`|R7ePV320aa	Yes. Because if she finds out though the grape-vine, you're more screwed than if you tell her yourself. Have to say, though, doesn't look good either way for you.|`|plmKaNxSaa	Yes she deserves to know everything you've put her through if she was nice enough to take you back.|`|kaA1rbUVaa	I dont think so.

pLkeooJ1aa	Well, I take anxiety meds. A shot or two of tequila will clam the nerves as well.<br>  <br>  Assuming you don't want to be hopped up on meds or liquor, I would suggest you prepare a little greeting or something and practice in the mirror until you're comfortable with how you come off. Practice your smile and small talk, and as soon as the first door bell rings, try to let all your worries go. Come to terms with the fact that the carpet stain is going nowhere, and that the number of horse devours is what it is, and hope that there's enough to go around.<br>  <br>  When I get really nervous, I wait until there's a large enough group for me to slip out unnoticed. I take a breather and head back in as fresh as can be.<br>  <br>  Good luck. It'll be fine.|`|7CmkRkEMaa	Nervousness is a part of introversion and the only way to avoid it is out-flow. Still when people let loose, usually they cannot cope with their own vibrational repercussions later. It is an old problem that also includes coming late and leaving early, but really wishing not to do either. <br>  <br>  When man evolved from primitive animals and was not being part of the quick smorgasbord survival of the fittest in natural selection, he had time to reflect on his life. In other words, he started to think about the past images he saw and stored in his memory. Lower animals did this as well, but really had no time to think because they would be eaten if not always vigilant. Hence, man then became self-conscious as of the time he had on his hands now. Image became everything because other humans also reflected upon what went before. They say themselves and wanted to be better in the future creating anxiousness for perfection. The first floccinicinauhilipilificator (critic) came about as well for commentary about the past images occurred and floccinicinauhilipilafication (critism) arrived. Therefore, man's self-consciousness occurred as of this criticism which could not be avoided. <br>  <br>  Hence, knowing that one cannot elude criticism, it does not matter what image is projected. But making the best attempt can be seen and I recommend that. That is all anyone can do and then what is displayed for better or worse. At that point, nothing can be done. If it is not good enough and repercussions come about, you can either try to do better in the future or stop participating.|`|pre1k4Pqaa	hi just be friendly nice really theres no need to be nervous just think be nice smile all will be ok youll see.
pyWY5FcYaa	Unlike some of the other responses, I think you DO have the right to be concerned.  You're living with this guy, and you're now pulling 100% of the financial load.  You ABSOLUTELY have the right to (politely, respectfully) inquire about his job search and offer opinions and advice.  True, the economy stinks.  And he might have to go through a period of being "underemployed", taking a lesser job that that for which he is qualified.  But he should be trying every day, and should be interested in sharing that struggle with you.  And if he's not, hmmm.... do you really want to be involved with this guy long term?  But be respectful, tactful, and sincerely interested.  Voice your feelings of concern (they're yours, nobody can dispute them), but don't heap criticism on him or attack him.  There is a difference.|`|hXQjnPuGaa	The economy is really bad right now. I've been looking for a job for 3 months, and the only place thats been willing to hire me is Arby's. Even McDonalds didn't call me for an interview.  My point is, that there really aren't many jobs available right now. Any place that does hire him will probably be the worst ****-hole he's ever seen anyway.     It might be a good idea for him to try a temp agency, but he will probably just get laid off again in a few weeks.  Has he tried getting unemployment?    Try not to pester him about it. He probably feels worthless enough without someone making lists of places to apply at. You'll just make him depressed or start a fight if you bother him about it.      EDIT: I dunno where you live, or what kind of businesses are in your area, but pasta is selling really well right now. Noone has much money, so they're buying the cheapest food available, and in many cases that means pasta. So if there's a pasta factory, or warehouse anywhere near you or a place that deals with anyother sort of simmilar cheap food, GENTLY suggest applying there to him. My dad works in a pasta/rice warehouse, and they're giving him overtime, and hiring new people all the time. He can make about $1000 a week if he wants to (that's right a thousand)|`|ze7xiJwTaa	I understand and I can relate to you wanting to come across as supportive and not bitchy (some people responding seem to be missing that).   My live in bf lost his job in Oct. It was really hard on him and hard to stay motivated. He wasn't skilled at job-hunting but was resistant to help. I tried to be supportive, handle all finances (mortgage, utils, food etc.) until he got on his feet. He finally got a job at Christmas and it doesn't pay well (he also has child-support and bills to pay). I'm thankful we both have jobs, but I'm still paying for ALL of our living expenses and it is a tremendous amount of pressure to the point where it's hurting our relationship and causing resentment. I've tried to talk to him gently, asking for help but he shuts down too.     It can be hard on a man to be dependent but we have to take care of ourselves too. Yes the economy sucks but I would work at McDonalds if I needed to and so should he. Unemployment takes forever. I'm sure you are still waiting, but it will help when it comes.     My guy picked up some freelance design jobs and also did a few days of construction and odd jobs. Every little bit does help.|`|lgxE5nUoaa	Hopefully he is getting unemployment pay.  If not, he needs to file with the state for that.    When my husband was unemployed, I updated his resume and I would also search daily for jobs for him.  Unfortunately, there's not a lot out there right now.  If he's willing, maybe he should get a job as a waiter - he can make decent tips and at least that way he'll have some money coming in until he finds what he's looking for.    It's really a hard time - I know exactly what you're going through - just try to hang in there and hope that it passes soon.|`|NeTNnvSZaa	Make believe that you're the one out of work and he's supporting you.  Would he have treated you like you've treated him?  $100 a month isn't much, he could probably make that collecting and returning deposit cans and bottles.|`|UNZuciedaa	feel sorry for that poor bastard having you nag at him all day.  you should be proud that he will let you support him and you should give him a generous allowance|`|Jn7bt3JTaa	You're not his wife, you don't have kids together.

This is the EXACT same complaint I hear from a lot men, about having to work long hours or more than one job, just for their wives to sit home and do nothing- oh, I forgot they clean up here and there sometimes. Your attitude is soo typical of that I've heard. It seems that women don't want to do what men are expected to do. Not all women, I'm sure. But I'll be damned if you aren't echoing the sentiment of a whole lot of women I've come across.     You didn't say what kind of job your boyfriend had before getting laid off. So, I'm just suggsting in general. He could sign with the dept of employment services in your area and find work that way. I'm not sure how it works where you are but I'm in DC and the DOES here have relationships with business owners and government agencies and can assist people with finding jobs easier than those people could on their own.|`|Bc4udMhUaa	Whoa don't get involved with his job search unless he asks. You shouldn't make lists or redo his resume or anything like that. That is terribly emasculating.     I would try giving him control of the bank account for a month or even longer if he does well. Let him see what's coming and what needs to go out. If he is truly a responsible guy this will light a fire under his butt.    I would also lay off asking him about his job search for a while. The more you bug men the more they shut down.    Ask him to drive you and pick yo up from work. This way he has the car if an interview pops up and you know if is awake at a decent time.    Your being kind of controlling (sorry). By controlling him you are only enabling him.|`|3d2dbfe624a4971313c2e9183de21b00aa	i think your being to hard on him!   yes it sucks when you have the load of supporting others on your paycheck sux when you have to give up little things sux more so when you have to pick what bill to pay this month!     but the times out their are HARD!  most companies paper work is backed up at least 6 months!  so maybe they didn't get to his app yet!   you harping on him shows me that you don't trust him!   your not trusting his word when he says he is looking!  if iwere him i would say a lot more then "not my choice i got laid off"   contiue to support him by finding "Word of mouth" jobs side jobs even!   and don't have him call... give the person looking for help his number then ask him if he had recieved the phone call yet!     if your this stressed you should feel free to  not worry about this on top of your work load!  your only adding more to your plate!     but most importaintly!   you need to tell him what you typed here!   tell him while you BOTH are in a good mood how you feel!   don't point fingures just print this up and ask him to read it as this is how you feel!|`|8txWayVnaa	Wow. . .you must be pretty young to post something like this.    Now, don't get offended.  What I mean is, that men have pride, and the last thing they want is their girlfriend or wife finding a job for them.  It's one thing if it's an opportunity that you heard about that your significant other is well-suited for, but quite another when you "give them a list."    You said he looks every other day because he has his daughter on alternating days.  It doesn't sound like he's playing Xbox all day, so quit kavetching already.  I know it's a well-kept secret, but the economy is BAD right now.    ADD:    As other posters have suggested, he should apply for unemployment if he hasn't already done so.  He could go to bartending school for a week, which would cost about $400-600, but after his first week on the job, the course could pay for itself.  It would bring in a heck of a lot more than $100 per month.  Just a thought.|`|OBCvewW2aa	This problem seems to be unique to men.  You won't catch me out of work for too long.  I live in America dammit, and if I can't get a temp job at McDonald's ringing up fries, then I'm not worth my damn citizenship.      He's being lazy and there's nothing wrong with that, but he needs to own up to it.  Think about it.  Exactly how long would YOU be out of work?  I'm guessing- not long.  Women are the new men.  We don't eat off the backs of others.    ADD:  All these people saying you're emasculating him... his lack of money is emasculating! You have nothing to do with it!  A man who can't feed his kids is worthless.  Absolutely worthless.|`|tCiVuFK9aa	Get a clue sweetie.  There are over 3 million people out of work and out there looking for the same jobs your boyfriend is looking for. There just aren't any jobs.  My husband was laid off the first of November and answers every add he can.  He recently stood in line for 3 hours just for an application at a place where they had 1 opening and 3,000 applications.  I'm working and paying the bills and sooooooo glad of it. The company I work for is having a major layoff tomorrow and I'm praying I'm not one of them. Hang in there, wait until this economy gets better and then hope he can find a job.  Maybe if you and he could compromise on some chores he could do at home to make your time off eaiser would help.     Bottom line, just be glad you have a job. And if you love this guy, give him a break.  I'm sure he would like to be working too.  Red|`|pkdDEJd4aa	How old are you? I suspect you shouldn't be in this relationship. You need to grow up and he needs to focus on his daughter.|`|263434b6fe9b827cbad3893e796d8d18aa	Temp places are always hiring, he may not work everyday, but at least it gets his foot in the door.|`|4181fz5Oaa	Tell him to spend more time on looking for a job and less on other issues lol :)|`|5ViTUTyZaa	You are being a biatche.  Just hang in there, he is trying.  He can sit there and be depressed or make the most of it.  You better find a way to deal w/ it cuz he could be out of work for 6 months to 1.5 years before he finds anything.|`|9ae557afae8c72a2f03fc0f5b4f78564aa	How long has he been out of work? Isn't he getting unemployment?  It is really tough to find a job right now, however have you thought about suggesting to him to get a paper route? Those jobs are easier to get (if your in a large town or city) I'm not kidding, I had a friend (She was 38, husband 42) that did that for a while. It's surprisingly good money for a job that leaves you the rest of the day to look for another job or take care of his daughter.|`|MhhoX1Yuaa	i have gone through this many of times with my spouse. It is hard, i feel for you. I know it's tough.   If he is telling you he's looking, then all you can do is believe him and support him. It's good that you bring him a list of places that are hiring, but don't nag him, he has a mom he doesnt need another one.   He will eventually start feeling less of a man, depressed, angry, sad all the same time. It'll be an adjustment for both of you. What you can do is sit with him and discuss the finances now that he's out of work, so he can get the big picture.     It's tough out there in the job market, my spouse has been out of a job for almost 8 months now, it was hard and frustrating on both parts. and i totally thought like you did, well it must be nice to sleep in, and watch tv all day, and go out, but just be patient, and every once in a while ask him how his search is going.     He can look in the paper or craigslist for side jobs, they have them all the time, and i mean an extra $50 here and there is a HUGE help.     Good luck!|`|lYZ71zYAaa	Your treating him like he is your kid, Stop , and give him a choice, either get a job or you done with him. That is an option, Your not married ( thank the lord). He has found it to easy to stay home and do nothing. You deserve more from him. respect, commitment and loyalty And you seem to be a very independent person who can take care of herself.

I could understand completely if you didn't love somebody for most reasons, but because you don't like her body is pretty poor.<br>  <br>  Either way, it's just going to take time.

aDIPIu7xaa	I hate to say this, but I have totally noticed that the women "I" have known that have gotten them, turned into total whores afterward.    I think that is because they were so insecure before, and now they are cashing in on their "insecurity investment"|`|0ne87Q96aa	yep, anything is possible!|`|UZxeBrxQaa	Possibly, but not always.    The one sure way to deal with this situation is for YOU to get breast implants as well!  It equals the playing field and would help your self esteem.|`|91ACjB5eaa	do men with big ***** screw more?    COME ON!    that's so stupid|`|5Wr9Mlwoaa	Absolutely true.     Because the reasons a woman who have breast implants has everything to do with vanity. I could see legitimate reasons for implants, i.e. breast cancer victims, or a poor girl who is essentially flat chested.    This is sort of similar to the common scenario where a overweight woman loses a lot of weight, suddenly becomes a "hottie", and lets it go to her head, soaking up as much male attention as she can handle.    How often do you hear, "For valentine's day gift, I am buying me a set of breasts, for your eyes only" ?|`|WrUTuQdlaa	Yes. Because they have low self worth.|`|5ViTUTyZaa	I would.|`|8758df9720f7d094342fbcef3c91a629aa	Is it possible, yes - but then again anything is possible.  If the lady gets implants and her S/O does not pay more attention to her and other guys do, then there is a possibility that she might consider cheating.  So if the guy helps her or lets her get implants then he should be paying a lot of attention to her.|`|i1rDJY2aaa	No, I was the opposite after I got mine. I became more withdrawn because of all the extra unwarranted and unsolicited attention from horny perverted men who wanted absolutely nothing to do with me when I was flat chested, but all of a sudden wanted to be my best friend once I was a C-cup.|`|688848d500e8dd2311ecc4f3b039b60eaa	I will give you my short story. I was married but unhappy already in the marriage. I got them and I like the way they look and did notice more attention(32b to 32d). I had an affair with my co-worker with whom I am still dating (8 months)(divorced now) and don't regret getting them. I feel I would have done the same without them. Just don't understand the negativity about implants...|`|d20mM90uaa	NO but she may get more attention, don't mean she will cheat! but if they bf or husband starts acting like a freak over it, jealous and all, that may end it and lead to her bopping someone else  you never know
0MO6wMqoaa	I think it sounds like he is dragging his feet. Move on to someone who will appreciate you and is not afraid of commitment. good luck|`|twVyisGnaa	He's the one who's taking it too slow.  8 months is good enough time to make good progress.    VIVA LA RAZA!|`|XhpLwjCuaa	too many unknown variables|`|Y1QsF40gaa	idk i really dont think its bad to move slow but maybe in that case|`|xWdBGitfaa	i think he is just scared of commitment. If that kinda stuff doesnt bother you then stay with him but if not then i would def leave him. why should you have to wait around when you could be finding someone better??|`|LsHkgexvaa	8 months is slooooow enough!  Sounds like he's not willing to commit...|`|6CAsx3jaaa	what are you doing thats pushing him? are coming over without him asking? if thats it dont come over unless he asks. people move at different speeds and sounds like he has some fears to get over. the good news is that if hes calling you his girlfriend hes getting comfortable. give him some space and let him process his feeelings about you. if he is a good guy hes worth waiting for ,if not have a talk with him or hit the highway|`|7X0hHq1aaa	My ex-boyfriend was the same way. We were together for about 10 months and he finally started calling me his girlfriend about 7 months into the relationship. It really depends on how old he is. If he is in his 20s he should be more open to a commitment and he should know what he wants. If he is younger, he probably just doesn't know what he wants yet. If you really want to be with this guy maybe you should try spending less time with him and if he is really into you he will realize how much you mean to him.
KuDD7qt3aa	well first of all hes a guy and guys send out wierd signals sometimes. they cant help it. its in their nature to be stupid. and no! you did nothing wrong. from what you said it sounds like he likes you but maybe still somewhat unsure. give the dude some time. hell come around if he is really interested. =)|`|ZOTw9XMmaa	not at all you just need to give it time hey well call you back and if you keep calling him it well get him mad|`|1HcHsLFlaa	he's just not that into you. plain and simple. if he liked you, then he would make sure you know. but it sounds like... you know.|`|MyUFqFx9aa	you should ask yourself that question again did you do some thing wrong?or did he see you flirting with someone else?or maybe you never know he might be seeing someone else.|`|oDTzW46maa	Well, he may feel a little awkward because you know. So, sometimes guys get scared and don't really know what to say. Also, he may be going through tough times in his family or other friends. Or he may not like you, and realized he was leading you on and is attempting to avoid the whole situation.|`|YVdIs5B2aa	i think u did somethig to turn him off   or he hurd n belived something negativa bout u|`|AA10106002	Ask 'im.|`|0ne87Q96aa	he is waiting for u to touch his cock ASAP don't wait, now!|`|hEAuWYYjaa	you didnt do anything wrong but maybe you should start talking to him again before he moves on|`|oOyXJtNvaa	He proberly doesnt know what to talk to you about.  Try ask him if he wants to hang out some time after footy or something?  :)|`|JHYwzWSbaa	i think he is "playing" and started speaking to a new girl or something..sorry to say :| but it's common!|`|Asm4AKOOaa	has to be some reason , maybe something happened . maybe he meet someone else . but something definity happened to change his mind .
5V5L9DoBaa	There was a hot greek girl in my school who loved to play soccer, or football as we call it in England, and also Basketball. It was fun cos you could really bond and always had conversations about it, n she was very dateable at the same time, so it's not weird. N she was good at them too, she used to kick our assess in the crossbar challenge.  It's not weird, but it's not normal in a good way, it's a bonus. Just as long as you dont kick all the boys' assess n make em feel bad haha|`|m99D31vTaa	NOOOOOO ! I LOVE SOCCER TOO =] ITS LIKE UGHH THE BEST THING .

pRklTpuFaa	BAHAHAHA well my dear, you  know who this is....!! :D<br>  tell him you dont want to..the truth might hurt but sure..wtf??!! LOL ttyl|`|VYS1VfFXaa	First mistake was tellin him you were single.  If they ask if you're single you know the next question is gonna be asking you out on a date.<br>  <br>  Tell him no and don't answer any more of his texts because the guy code is like the telemarketer code: the longer they keep you talking the more chance they think they have with you.|`|hdO6CNQ1aa	Just say you dont want too, Let him down easy if it helps.<br>  But you cant make yourself want to go out with him.<br>  <br>  Hope I Helped :)|`|pa8vbP5taa	Tell him you are a Lesbian.|`|WZAyT1WEaa	justt say the truth say for him u dont want to go out but u really like him an d dont mean anything by refusingg and make sure he is not sad|`|hX9cHdyMaa	just dont put him down, dont eva make him feel bad by dissing him and his qualities cos we men all have them... just dont ignore, but at the same time, make it clear u dont wanna relationship right now cos u got so many things going for u at the moment<br>  <br>  seb<br>  x|`|II0CWitXaa	like you said ur happily single at the mement tell him ur not looking for a relationship atm.|`|Wg0VteZ9aa	LOL<br>  just tell him.<br>  Or obviously you could just go out with someone you dont even want to and waste your life during that period with him.<br>  Whatever you want.
8445498a066182908045258b3eca3b35aa	If you're not out yet...how are you going to date other guys?<br>  <br>  I would focus on sharing with friends and family and your studies...|`|b23ac589c655b9f48a90e2fb2ffe9f58aa	u r shame on men|`|gF92tdqxaa	you need to solve the coming out problem first? or use this situation to do so
a9OwtN7faa	your birth certificate states the same through out  your life because it is a record of your birth circumstances, for example your name, date of birth biological parents and so forth. You can always find out if its a fake by looking closely at the certified stamp that it should have almost embeded into the paper.         of course the designs for birth certificates always change as does the times but the most valuable part of the certificate is and always will be is the embedded stamp on the corner of the document.         no, the state does not give your adoptive parents new  birth certificates with their names as parents.    the papers that they would give your new adoptive parents would be certified adoption papers but never a new birth certificate they are two different types of legal papers that cannot be substituted for the other.  I hope I answered your question.|`|Jzr8UmFKaa	All birth certificates have a notory seal on them - Stamp|`|UQWusO1waa	if you contact the city your were born in you can get a duplicate of your BC.      http://www.ehow.com/how_2002271_copy-bir...|`|4c5c7b48be73986cea1de97bf94553abaa	Adopted kids do get new birth certificates.  However, it's difficult to spot a fake.  Why do you think you have a fake?  What state are you in?  Each state has their own procedures for obtaining birth certificates and each state's looks slightly different.  You could order a copy from the state and see if they look the same.      Good Luck!|`|MPavjXO6aa	all states either have a vital records / vital statistics section or department of health and human services that handles birth / death certs / adoption certs. Check with them to see if your book/page number at the top of the birth cert is legitmate. if not, you can order a replacement birth cert or transcript of birth (like a birth cert) for a fee. some states require that only the parent, guardian or applicant themselves are the only ones who can order this|`|vj2pOgT7aa	Can the state actually give parents certificates for adopted kids?    YES.|`|b81H0vlYaa	Your real birth certificate will have an imprinted seal on it.  Some hospitals will give out a keepsake resembling a birth certificate.  I know my husband's cousin has a 2 birth certificates.  She was chosen to be adopted by his aunt before the woman gave birth to her, so she has one with her real mom's name on it and one with her adopted parent's name on it.    If you suspect you are adopted and are over 13, ask your parents.  They will either laugh at you or tell you you are.  I asked my parents if my sister was adopted :)  because she is so different from the rest of our family, but she isn't.|`|beQfszKKaa	If it is written in crayon. LOL|`|9GLsCTdhaa	yeas the state can but if your adopted then you will be able to have two birth cert. the one from your real parent the the update with your adopted parents and how can you tall one fake? if it dont have a seal and water makers hold it up to the light to see them and signature its should have one from the state registrar of vital records at the bottom
uRqm4Bxcaa	When you like a chick:  You have probably known her for awhile and there's more tension.  But, you like her so usually all the tension isn't resolved.  The first time you won't talk dirty to this chick at all, and it'll be probably slower and it'll seem like the chicks idea and the guy won't pressure too much to take it all the way.<br>  <br>  When you don't like a skank:  Probably just met her or never liked her when you did know her so there's not that tension in the air.  It's almost like a job you force yourself to do.  Seems to me like there's more animosity when it doesn't matter.  Plus you don't ever expect to see her again so you're not polite at all.  And plus you might be putting a paper bag on this ones head.  Haha just kidding.<br>  <br>  PS:  Like someone said above, looking into a girls eyes is a HUGE indicator of whats going on up there in that head of his.  I've been in situations where I couldn't even look a woman in the eye, and I've been in a situation where I had to look directly in the woman's eye the ENTIRE time.  Huge sign there.|`|oyljTnxPaa	If hes having sex with someone he loves it will be more than just pleasure and ******** it will be a passionate moment. Especially if he is more interested in looking at your face rather than your other areas|`|mYkinxsQaa	Nice girl: he makes sure she is pleased.<br>  <br>  Skanky girl: he makes sure he pounds the crap outta her.|`|dJoE8yedaa	Good answer jeX. Though with guys sex is sex. I doubt it makes a difference as long as he cums.|`|mvrygTYTaa	When a guy sleeps with a woman he doesn't love he is able to experiment with the woman, and do things he wouldn't normally do with a woman he loves.<br>  <br>  However, with a woman he loves he places that woman on the same level as his mother. He treats her well and wants her happiness too. Over time, a good man will be willing to speak to this woman and ask her to do those "nasty" things and find out if she wants to do them as well. He will get over that shyness and try to find something that pleases them both. He will learn that it's not degrading to the woman he loves and that the woman can enjoy it. He also learns that things that happen in the bedroom can just stay in the bedroom.|`|TtMKPBR3aa	when with a skank he is thinking, "man i gotta get the show on the road and finish this gig and get the hell outta dodge"<br>  <br>  when with a nice girl he is thinking, "this feels like home i think i might wanna swish around in this gusher after i am dun until i get a rash"|`|3r1TwMCQaa	Guys don't care. They are getting laid - that's all that matters
szVvf7Nkaa	I think you really need to get over this. If you don't then you are going to ruin your relationship with your fiance. If your fiance really wanted to be with his ex he would be with her and not you. But he wants you and that is why he proposed to you on Valentine's Day. Your fiance's ex is not a treat to your relationship with your fiance. But if you continue to put pressure on your fiance then he's going to resent you for trying to break up that friendship that he has with her. Your fiance has moved on with you and you should try to focus on that.|`|MkfAD8Y2aa	dump him, he's not worth it.|`|4wAqwL3Caa	If he still does have some sort of feeling for her deep down, you cutting him off from her wont stop them.<br>  To him she may always be "the one that got away"<br>  <br>  sorry if thats not what you wanted to hear.. :(|`|1NcVu5v9aa	.............................??

oTWpoIJdaa	Through prayer and family counseling.  You can only change yourself and your response.  He has to work on himself.  From what you've mentioned,  he has acknowledged in the past when he is wrong; that is a start.  He has to overcome a habit that has become part of him - this is going to take time -- a lot of time.  While you are working this out, don't get sucked into his emotional vortex by responding.  Tell him in a calm tone what you will allow and get up and leave.  When he insults your girlfriend, defend her calmly without returning insults, get up and leave.  Even if he apologizes, don't hang around; just leave.  It has to hurt for him to get the message that if he wants a relationship with you, he has to change.|`|CkpzuduCaa	well tom. its tough. well asked god to help ya.|`|GMsLRStiaa	give him an ultimatum. Tell him either he starts accepting you as his son or he won't see you again. You have a right to see your dad and he has a right to see you, but don't give him that right until he proves worthy.<br>  He probably feels lots of regret and its easier for him to deal with that regret by putting the blame on you. So try saying to him that you're willing to wipe the slate clean and start over but this is his only chance to see you. <br>  As for the insults to your mother, you and your gf that's not acceptable. He should stop that. Just try telling him that it hurts you.|`|SCg3kDz2aa	All the time when he starts his lamentation tell him the next:<br>  <br>  "Dad, I need, you know Dad?,  I NEED, a loving Dad and not an always criticizing one.

Guys always want what they think they cant have. Play a little hard to get even though that is hard it will pay off.|`|DhS639RNaa	Ignore him, enjoy life. Have fun (for real) laugh pretty loud when he's around. Try a new look to show what he's missing, get a new haircut. If you have class with him or something, do something special to make him want you. Works for me when I'm with my crush. Flirt with guys in front of him, then occasionally glance his way, making sure you make eye contact, then raise your eyebrows and look away.|`|JXppj7Z7aa	dont even worry about him he's going to do him and you just gotta do you, there's nothing else left to say. sure it's going to take some time for you to get over him but dont worry about him...

oZpqEdI7aa	I think that he does want to see you, and no it wasn't bad for you to be honest with him, he seems to have feelings for you|`|5LEE91CGaa	well if he is really straight up about what he says then you'll see that he said "i hope you STAY beautiful forever.|`|JHYwzWSbaa	well you gave out your number  and why would he have "dissed" you, then wanted to have dinner with you?|`|URAvkeDPaa	Well it seems like you don't want to meet him so don't! You don't even have to talk to him again. Just block him on MSN|`|5V5L9DoBaa	It sounds like he still has strong feelings for you. He persisted meaning he's lookin for more than just a hookup, and even after being honest with him but he still wants to meet up is a good thing. He's accepted his flaws n hopefully will change for the better.  As well, any guy that desperate for a relationship without sex, he knows he wont get it, is a damn decent guy. He may have his flaws in your eyes but trust me he's much better than most guys you'll meet. Maybe he's gonna be better this time, but it's up to you, only you know him personally, but i'd say go for it!|`|LaczJGJ7aa	DONT DO IT   I think its a trick to meet up with you so he can   do it but you really wanna save that for marrige so you wont be a pt.  (pt=Pregnant teen) or adult without marrige|`|oackIYgCaa	I think he might still have feelings for you and he rlly wants to see you. Why dont you ask him these questions urself. Sometimes guys say something that comes out different then wat they had in mind. ooo and how did u break up. That could have something to do with this. I think u should let no even more than wat u told him. I think its great that u want to save sex till marriage. That tells me that u r responsinsible and dont look at sex as some one night stand. OOO and it was probably not a diss. ? Hope this helps. ooo and srry that im not a guy and i answered it just seemed like i should say something.

Trust is earned, not given. And not many people easily forgive people who slept with their boyfriends behind their backs. She's not being a drama queen, you're a bad friend.    Oh, well what did you think we were going to say? You did an awful thing! Ten times! That's ridiculous and you don't deserve her.|`|qUyBV6zLaa	I know me and you wouldnt be friends no longer either. You made a mistake. You are sorry. You will never do it again. Okay, thats fine. But she doesnt want you in her life anymore so maybe you can make new friends and remember this past mistake and never make it again with your future friends boyfriend/husband.    I dont think you fully understand just how much it hurts to be cheated on, now think of how it will feel to be cheated on and it was with your best friend. Not good. Let her live her life and move on.|`|ykeCqwfoaa	You don't deserve her trust! You slept with her boyfriend 10 times? You're such a slut ***** who deserves to burn in hell! Maybe that's a little harsh, but come ON. Yeah, you made a mistake. That's one thing. Even that deserves for you to lose her trust. 10 times! She has nerve!? You're the one who has problems? Maybe the question should be "How do I stop being a whore and a *****?" I think that would fit better. She's not a drama queen, she's just smart for not associating herself with someone like you.|`|oJCXM0jDaa	You slept with her boyfriend 10 times? You know, I don't think there is enough forgiveness in the world for that.  I'm sorry, but it's true.|`|x1zOGQMGaa	I don't blame your friend, honestly.  That was a terrible thing to do!  I hate to break it to you, but I don't think you'll get her trust back anytime soon.  It's not worth it; if someone did the same to you, would you be able to forgive them?

You obviously dont want her to be your friend or to trust you. put yourself in her shoes how would you feel if see did that to you.

And STOP sleeping with her boyfriend.|`|IflwJyUqaa	YOU DON'T!!!! Not even after one time let alone ten. You are the reason women hate each other.

wzpCMI44aa	Trust me, "cheap" is not a good word when you're talking about wedding photography. If you hire an "extremely cheap" photographer, you will end up with pictures similar to what your uncle would do.    Try looking for a student who has just graduated or is almost ready to graduate, they will do it cheaper than a professional because they don't have business expenses yet.     And if you can possibly trim your other expenses down so that you have more for the photographer, do that. The pictures are what you have long after the wedding is over and you want to have good ones that make you smile every time you see them, not pictures that make you wish you'd paid a little more for your photographer.|`|FD8I4zthaa	You buy cheap, you get cheap.

But you can't repeat it if the photos are all rubbish!|`|Y8kjVeLyaa	I advise you to go to the nearest college or University and put an advert on the photoraohy students notice board that you are looking for a 3rd year photography student to do your wedding pics and you will pay 600 pounds.....also add that you would like to see their work...put an email address so they can send jpegs...when you have narrowed it down arrange to meet them seperately and interview them...they will be some very good photographers and students are alwys cheaper...they need the money!|`|43df0b4a9c6483ef52c3528781726646aa	You could try one of those booths that do passports.Whats on for the meal,jam sandwiches??|`|95b3c1cab8a1f1f08d03b46eefc17755aa	Get your friends and members of your family cheap digital cameras and let them loose in the wedding.

If u feel that it wil get 2 overwhelming for you to let him go afterwards, then dnt do it. Be prepared to protect your heart. If u want this to be the one special sweet way to say goodbye, then go ahead. No, i dont think its wrong to have sex with him if u can both move on from this point.. But i want you to knw dat if dis is d first time u r gng 2 hav sex, then dnt hav it with hm. Sex cn b unpredictable nd u cn never tel hw ur mind nd body wil react to him.. Jst hold on nd dnt get 2 temptd..|`|SRzL2Wexaa	No, it doesn't sound like there's any future in it, so why would you want to?  Sure, he'll have something to brag about but will you want to brag about that to your future boyfriends or husband?|`|63Ac7vDyaa	In this day and age its pretty common to have sex before marriage and even with someone who isn't your bf/gf... But you should really think about it though because if you guys are already trying to not get attached well adding sex to hooking up might just get you attached... Having sex is a big thing and for most girls and some guys you do get attached and with him leaving for college its going to hurt you a lot because it sounds like you already like him a lot if your considering having sex with him... So be careful and really think this through and maybe even have a talk with him about sex and maybe getting stronger feelings afterward and see what he thinks... Be careful because he could just want sex from you and whether you want to be with him or not that could also hurt you. And also be careful because if you guys become more, long distance relationships are really hard to make work specially when your young and in college... If you decide to have sex then make sure you get on birth control pills or some other form of birth control and use condoms every time. If you are a virgin then I say no don't lose your virginity this way, lose it to someone who is actually your boyfriend who cares about you and who you will be with for a long time. Good luck, hope I've helped some..|`|oyljTnxPaa	NO!!!

If she is then, you may want to rethink your desires.  I realize that in some cultures is best, like incest is best put your sister to the test.  But serious problems can arise from a union such as this.  First off, your poor children could suffer terribly from genetic deformities.  Second this union would never be sanctioned by any clergy nor judicial system.  In essence, marriage to your biological sister is taboo.  Find someone outside of your family reunion to fall in love with.  I recommend the same for your sister.  Good Luck!!!

Move to Kentucky, buy a Mobile Home and marry this girl of Your dreams. Just understand if you start making babies you may have some scientific experiments for kids. The gene pool will definitely need a filter. Yee-Haa ya all!!|`|WiFVIq3Iaa	yes you can|`|m5iMdiqgaa	first u sex with your mama's daughter and after she is pregent after u r marry.|`|BfQzBD4aaa	That is wrong in so many ways|`|lP04jzv6aa	Um, not going to happen.

You will think about him for awhile if it's someone you saw yourself being with. Personally, I just try and focus on schoolwork, go out with friends, or possibly try and find a new guy that could work in a relationship. Best of luck to you-- I know how hard it is.|`|e7302da69a66d35643b221f8f86ec06daa	Every time you think of him imagine him taking a poop and picking his nose while he's doing it.  Then he eats his boogers.  And then he starts singing Pink songs in a girly voice.  That should cure you.
y4zYkceEaa	That's not being overprotective!! Believe me, I've seen worst. He just misses you that's all. ;))<br>  <br>  edit: Good luck with that. He must really like you.|`|Likst1Mxaa	Just stay away from him. He's ruining your chances with other guys.|`|e7302da69a66d35643b221f8f86ec06daa	Would you rather he ignore you?  Maybe eventually he will after the newness wears off.  Enjoy the fact someone thinks so highly of you.|`|VYS1VfFXaa	That's not overprotective, that's being clingy.|`|c6g92RRVaa	that isn't being over protective that is just showing he actually cares about you|`|SRzL2Wexaa	Wow, enjoy it while it lasts.  Don't ***** about it.|`|IwN6nLgkaa	this guy is clingy....if he's like this now how is he going to be if you decide to start a relationship with him. think before you take the next step with this guy.|`|II0CWitXaa	he must really like you then, i kinda like the overprotective kind makes me feel warm nd bubbly lol weird i noe...|`|AL4Q6Agraa	Its ok, enjoy it lol. He sounds kinda clingy but sweet. Just talk to him nicely if it bother you. :)
RdiLWfDdaa	alright mate. i'll go as far as to say that she is interested. but i think its more that she wants to break out a bit. if u are looking for a relationship out of this then i would say you are looking in the wrong place. but if u want a root then i think u got it!|`|VYS1VfFXaa	Sounds like what my husband did to me.  Flirted with someone at work even though he was married to me.  Eventually started cheating on me behind my back.<br>  <br>  If you're smart you won't do it because her 15yr partner will be on you like stink on $hit.  I know, because I still have my husband's balls in a jar, and his whore's ovaries in the jar next to it.|`|sIX1nhCFaa	Maybe she's lonely and needs someone with her :) Just follow ur heart, if she is, and she wants to be with u, do what u feel is right Goodluck!! follow destiny.|`|Xv2p94pXaa	If you like this girl, and she likes you back then there shouldn't be anything to stop you from being together. Just don't go behind her partners back, because it could get ugly. You don't want to be accused of stealing her, and people accusing her of cheating. She'll know when the time is right to break up with him, if she doesn't feel he treats her right. Leave it to her to make the descisions about him, and don't get involved. <br>  <br>  But also, if she is pushing you to be with other girls, then maybe she doesn't like you as much as you think, or just doesn't want to make you wait when she can't be yours...|`|jTEB2cgsaa	ASK her!|`|7twWHSJYaa	Sounds good. follow your instincts!
DybOqfGpaa	i really dun knwo anything abt internet date ??<br>  r u talking abt online date  sitting infront of pc ??|`|veeC7Rvvaa	Just like offline!<br>  <br>  It's best to start off the conversation by mentionning a gig or an event or a place that you know they like. Simple, really..|`|ZIqJ3Hzlaa	Just do it, find a neutral place, mall or restaurant and set up a time to meet them there.  If there is no chemistry then either one of you can walk away and call it off.
y4zYkceEaa	Would you actually waste all that time? You stayed with him for 5 years for a reason. You still love him! Yes, he wasn't there for you when you really needed him, but we all make mistakes. Its all up to you really. Just follow your heart. Tell your boyfriend that he needs to change. If he thinks otherwise, he's not worth it. You deserve the best. Good luck ;))|`|AA11349881	If your long term bf wasnt there for you during family crisis then i would say he doesnt care that much,i been there and done that and in end i realised he didnt give a damn about me,so i moved on.|`|7twWHSJYaa	Go back to your long term bf. Sounds like you still really like him!If u do then accept him!|`|JhJs2cnmaa	It's better leaving that relationship. You want to get back with him because you remember how it was and because he is familiar. But, if it went downhill before, there is nothing stopping it happening again and then your back to square one.<br>  <br>  I know it horrid to hear but you've got to put your best interests first. It's better to move on|`|DybOqfGpaa	go for ur heart <br>  but if some one is there for u wen u r in crisis and u felt good with him then why to loss him buddy and this ur x-bf could b change again then u will not have anyone to come and rescue u again<br>  what do u think??|`|VvNKTFhJaa	One should enjoy the colors of life.|`|aZDlPpKpaa	You need to ask yourself, 'do I really like this guy?'. Think about how he is a good boyfriend (the pros ;) ), and how he is .. bad (cons). In reality, there is someone out there for everyone, maybe you just havn't found the right guy yet :) If you dont think you're in love with your long term boyfriend I would leave it, but stay good friends. I'm sure you will find a different guy who is perfect soon x :)|`|ZIqJ3Hzlaa	Let me tell you from experience, go with the gut feelings.  First of all if he is not nice to you and treats you bad, ditch him!!!  Everyone deserves to be happy in life, I take it you are young so be careful and choose accordingly.|`|Xmp4261Xaa	by you even asking this question, perhaps means that you have mixed feelings,so i would move on with the new one..|`|0UOiAZrpaa	I pretty much lived your b/fs life..... I was with a girl for 4 years and we were planning on getting married.... We broke up, talked about it the next day and decided to take a week off.... We got back together after a week and the fighting began again. We tried to solve the fighting but there was always tension because of the thing we though was soo strong fell apart on us and we weren't the same people that we were when we first got together.... So we broke up again...... There was some tears and some arguments but she moved away for school so it was easy for us to try and move on. Well when she came back there was a friendship that started but then she got scared that we were rushing things and she never knew what she wanted. Well we stopped being friends and didn't talk much... Well I met another girl and started to date her and it killed her when she found out. I gave her the option to be with me but she still didn't know what she wanted. I will always love my ex and she will have a place in my heart always... I was able to move on and find someone who I get along with and I now plan on marrying.... Never thought I would be able to move on but i did and I am glad I was able to...<br>  Thats my story and yours could be totally different but just wanted to let u know that things happen like that every day and u have to look out for your happiness and not others!<br>  <br>  Goodluck!|`|4ef505315e6714cd6a174d1beb0546f0aa	You are running off of feelings. Long term relationships take lots of hard work to be successful. Feelings will grow and fade through the journey, but the harder you work, the stronger your love will become. <br>  <br>  Don't waste time on waiting for that feeling of "love". It's usually just phase anyway. If your long term guy qualifies to be your absolute best (guy) friend, and you have complete trust in him, then make it work.<br>  <br>  And don't break things off with him if he's putting his guys first. That's selfish and possessive on your part. He needs his guy time just like you need your girl time. Trust me, it's better if he makes his guys a priority sometimes, versus smothering you by making you number one and letting his personal life slip because of it. I'm a guy and I learned that one the hard way.<br>  <br>  "he wasn't there to support me" - He didn't *have* to. He should have, but don't hold an expectation like that to him. Maybe this "crisis" of yours didn't involve him in any way. Maybe he didn't want to be a part of it. You need to let him have feelings, and you need to respect them. Don't make it all about you; that's an easy way to end up all alone in the end.|`|b5be50fedc55289736f6c2d830f978d6aa	Only YOU can actually make the all important decision to stay in this relationship or move on!<br>  <br>  You need to ask yourself:<br>  <br>  1. Do I want a Serious relationship?<br>  <br>  2. Do I Just want  a bit of Fun?<br>  <br>  3. Is it time  to settle down yet?<br>  <br>  If number 3  is definitely not you -then you need to carefully leave him if Love isn't what you are feeling! And don't get into serious-type relationships until you are sure that's what you want.<br>  <br>  One more thing.. Hey! Be Careful Out There.|`|hX9cHdyMaa	a-duh?????<br>  1st cos u might've done somthing to him u hadnt realised.<br>  although 2nd sounds appealing, u dont kno him well and it'll end up just bein a fling. 1st guy was with u for 5 yrs and he's probably kicking himself now for not handling the situation correctly. he's probably just a hopless romantic who watches too many romantic movies and wants that moment between u guys to happen..lol<br>  <br>  anyways<br>  do wat u think is right..<br>  <br>  cya|`|xBDMqCL1aa	See how the #1 relationship goes. He had better treat you right!! *shakes fist*<br>  <br>  Also, please stop thinking of guy #2, you're making yourself miserable. You have to sort it out with #1, cause it's one more thing to make the relationship simmer to ashes. You loved the #2 relationship. But now that you're stupidly back together with #1 despite having started something with #2 (aww, your commitment sucks!), you better tell #2 that, very sadly, you guys have to 'have a break'.<br>  <br>  Also, if #1 ain't gonna talk to you AS FRIENDS, I'd say he's using you so strike him off your (create one now if you don't have one!!) "My Life's List of Buddies & Associates"...<br>  <br>  Maybe I'm just too bossy at times... :/|`|u0TvUKPeaa	It's really up to how you want your boyfriend to be<br>  -Keeps you happy (physically)<br>  -Will be there for along time<br>  Because there could  be other reasons why he wasn't there for you at the time you needed him most, but people so often aren't there for when you need them and could change during a long period relationship<br>  It's just if you want to try some one new or stick with your old boyfriend who could possibly change back to how he used to be before the changes happened<br>  I my self would pick the ex because I wouldn't  want to risk what happened to happen again, when the old boyfriend apologized and said things would change, if they don't change after a while then forget it. but if they do happen to make you happy as they did before then it was a good choice
a05818703edf627a70c2368c5b12f69daa	when my ex husband left me for the other woman, at first it looked as if everything was coming up roses for them, it was me who lost my home, had to leave the area, i was the one who was devastated. later learned all was not going well in paradise for them, i have to admit it did bring a smile to my face. wondered why his uncle had contacted me on the internet through e mail wanting to know what i was doing. funny how when i lived close that none of his family even cared to contact me and see how i was. i think your ex as well as my ex isn't happy, and remembered when they were happy. It is that she's unhappy, and it shows regret too. she may want u back, i know my ex wanted me back, but the [ast is the past and if they did it to u once they will do it again.|`|Kh5o3QCcaa	I think you have high hopes.  How long have you two been apart?  It's really unhealthy to dwell like this, you should really have moved past it by now.<br>  <br>  I would suggest stop caring about or hoping that she will drive by, or Come back, forget her, and go have some relationships of your own.<br>  <br>  Not trying to be mean, just honest.|`|AA11198190	l think you are loving every minute of it....and you still miss HER.|`|GqTSa85daa	I think she found the grass is not always greener on the other side of the fence. Maybe she wants to talk to you, but because the way you guys broke up (her fault?), she can't figure how to approach you.|`|KOXcw4klaa	your ex probably is having a rough time with her new guy.she also probably regrets breaking up with you but doesn't have the nads to call or knock on the door.with her pulling up and then taking off tells me she wants you to initiate a conversation,contact her.but if i were you i would ignore the whole thing.she is your ex for a reason.getting back with an ex never works out and you will just get hurt again for nothing.|`|djUMvICoaa	I might not take it as lightly as you are.  When someone starts stalking you it can lead to different results but none of them in your favor.  I would make a police report out of it for your safety.  She is probably looking for something she had in your relationship that she is lacking now, security, something she needs badly now with a child.  She knows that is something you offered her but now is having trouble finding.  If it weren't so damn sad it might really be funny, the big loser in all of this is going to be her child.  Yet there is some satisfaction I'm sure that she now has to lie in the bed she made.|`|uKr6TFxNaa	can you say "stalker"|`|uBXYugNYaa	story's to long.................is this a novel or what?
pLkeooJ1aa	It means let out the w-h-o-r-e in you.<br>  <br>  For one night, be a ******.<br>  <br>  I promise you, it's not nearly as fun as it sounds. You act like a ******, you get treated as a ****** and then you feel like a ******<br>  <br>  No bueno
JFJF3GPWaa	Try to keep calm while your waiting, there nothing you can do right now so try and relax. Try doing something that will occupy your mind like reading a really good book, playing a computer game or listning to your favorite CD. Try to not think about it because you will get into a nervous state!! There's nothing you can do until you hear something so keep yourself busy so you don't have to think about it.|`|95b3c1cab8a1f1f08d03b46eefc17755aa	How awful for you, love. Your whole family must be frantic .... <br>  <br>  Light a little candle and focus on it and visualise your sister coming home, safe and well. For safety reasons don't leave that candle burning when you leave the room!<br>  <br>  And of course contact the authorities, like the police.|`|HUhheZWtaa	Call The police and think of the places she will go to<br>  <br>  i hope you find her|`|MlCWsBcwaa	It is very scary.  A lot of things could have happened, like you say, but hopefully the odds are that she has wandered somewhere and some people will find her and bring her home or call the police.  Little kids can wander off so quickly and even following a dog or other kids or something like that.  Until you know though, I can only imagine all the bad things you could be worrying about.  I think you should just do what your parents have asked and wait at home.  The others are doing the looking, and you have an important job too.  Maybe if you are able to, you could start preparing dinner for when everyone gets home, or do some household chores that would not stop you listening and looking out for her, to help keep you a bit busy.  Good luck, hope things work out well (and you can update this later and tell us that).  P.S. great to hear she is back again and safe.|`|CB15kchkaa	The best thing you can do is sit and wait. You will be the first to know if she comes back and will need to alert the others. But how did a 4 year old go missing? Sit tight and leave it to your parents to take the next step if she's not found quickly.|`|VEgv5NhSaa	Print out posters and go to different streets and stick them up on lamp posts.|`|Ixb3nCIDaa	contact the police asap|`|20da7e19a185ca8c01b2a311761afcd6aa	I know its hard to stay calm in these types of situations, but stay home and do what your told. keep an eye out for any suspicious people. If your sister doesn't come back within a day I would call the police.  Make flyers with a picture of your sister, and what she was wearing the day she was last seen, and post them up everywhere. The police will help you with this. Good Luck!!!|`|4WlkDzLeaa	If no one who is out looking for her finds her soon, report this to the police!<br>  <br>  There is a good chance she wandered off and just got lost, but if you are in a city this could be very dangerous for a four year old! Seriously, report this quickly!!|`|sIX1nhCFaa	I pray for u sake and hope she will be allright, maybe you could ask a very trusted friend to come to ur house and stay there so u could help, or defentely call the police!!!!!! do wat u must to help, goodluck :(<br>  but u should stay where u r.

I think it's really important that you stay put so that someone she knows is there at home when they find her.  Also, your family needs to concentrate on finding her right now, and if you leave they'll have to worry about you,too.  Stay positive - I'm sure she'll be found quickly.|`|TjcTKyWhaa	i realy dont know, try to go to places that she knows, please call the cops, this has got to scary as hell, i'll keep you in prayer|`|MzCLomc0aa	How long has she been missing for if she has been missing for over an hour u really need to call the police and get proper help<br>  <br>  Hope u find her xx|`|rLCx5ljQaa	Calling the police is your best shot.<br>  <br>  Just remember - you dont have to wait 24 hours before you report someone missing.<br>  <br>  hope u find her.|`|RP6Xmvxsaa	GET A CARE GIVER SO THAT YOUR SISTER WILL WELL TAKE CARE ANYTIME OF THE DAY|`|AA11964833	call the police|`|eRCLtUZ2aa	call the police|`|L5MuRNVsaa	im so sorry...

AA10663684	it sounds to me like you are the one that has changed. and really its not a bad thing.<br>  <br>  it sounds like at one time that this behavior was acceptable, and now its not. nor should this be acceptable. <br>  <br>  but it appears that from the short brief desription that you gave, that you are the one that changed, finally realizing that this is not acceptable, and that you deserve better.|`|jBigEy0Caa	Marriage counseling.  Sometimes when they hear it from someone else it makes more of an impact.|`|djUMvICoaa	You should have told us how long you've been married.  But it seems you are married to a bankrupt lover, he has nothing in that department and it shows in everything else.  He was kind and understanding in your courtship I take it, otherwise you wouldn't be in this situation, but the wedding changed that.  You have now become a slave to him to do all he commands.  But you have also reached your breaking point.  If you can't get him to move on anything, and I don't think he wants to change if he's tuned you out to the degree he has, you know what your option is.  It is a hard decision because you know it will hurt him no matter how he has treated you.  But you have to take care of yourself, you deserve better.  Even living by yourself can be better, you don't have all the dramatics going on.  But even if you do this, you have to question why you let yourself get dragged down this much, why you passed all those llittle markers that told you something was wrong.  It probably started because you said you loved him enough to overlook it, but that is why you are here now.  Pick up your self esteem and move on.  Watch what choices you make in the future.|`|wia9SXCPaa	Wow I am sorry to hear that!  My marriage has been there and back so I thought I could be of some help.  However now were on our way back to that place so maybe you should take the advice for what its worth.<br>  <br>  Love takes time and nurturing.  If you have to ask him to tell you he loves you he cant do that johnny on the spot.  Telling someone you love them shouldn't be a chore it should be something they want to say and feel.<br>  <br>  Be patient with him.  Show him the love you have for him.  Don't smother him you will not like the outcome.<br>  <br>  If all else fails get some counseling and see where that takes you.|`|09k5GLLkaa	It would seem that the Honeymoon is over. You either picked the wrong guy to marry or he picked the wrong gal. Either way you two should at least decide if you want to continue to live like this or get divorced from each other.  Divorce is not all that easy and neither is staying in a rotten relationship. If the guy won't even hug you shows me that he no longer loves you. Do you want to live like that without mutual love? I don't think that anyone wants to live that way. (smile)|`|pOCabUMvaa	I would say you are unhappy kick him to the side.<br>  <br>  You tried your best, there is nothing you can do about it, you have done the best you can so move on. <br>  <br>  Find the man you deserve.<br>  <br>  Marriage is 50/50, not just one person carrying the whole marriage on her shoulders.<br>  <br>  Time for you to be happy!!!|`|AA10240683	One of the facts of life is people will change. One of the problems with marriage is coping with this eventual changes. There may be an underlining problem which he may not/cannot discuss for some reason therefore, has that "brick wall" put up. Professional counseling may help.
eTTkAv9Yaa	Common story I'm afraid, sorry you had to find out that most boys are jerks that way, lead by their testicles!|`|BaNrweQ4aa	i don't think you have any other feelings for him; you are just shocked at the way your best friend has acted - and it's like he has suddenly changed or something. i think you should try talking to him about this; but he's obviously become much more confident (in a bad way) after one night; and his ego is a lot bigger. people change like that; but if you want to sort things out - talking is the best policy. if you're angry then you need to speak to him about it; or his lad best friend - and see waht he says :)|`|dvA9ttLIaa	I don't think your over reacting. When guys become around 15 having had sex makes them look cool. You should talk to him and tell him how you feel|`|gC8cNMQ8aa	it seems like he changed around you since he had a shag (loser, he thinks he's a man now)... if he makes you feel uncomfortable keep a distance to make him aware that you do not approve his new attitude and if he's your true mate then he'll learn and stop. if you dont want to do that then just simply sit him down and talk to him about how your feeling, and if after he still continues then i guess you'll know that hes not a mate anymre. <br>                                 Hope i helped out XD tkcare.|`|hN08l7tLaa	you are not overreacting. it's just that he might be doing something quite overboard. i agreed with you that he shouldnt show you the video that he had. but if the other girl is willing to allow him to video, i guess the other girl is also not someone good. in the meantime, try to keep a distance with ur friend. if you were to go out, go to some crowded places like the mall or something. just in case something might happen and u might regret it.take care.
LtVQH5jDaa	yes i have, only a few people. If they have betrayed me and stopped being kind and a good friend then i have thought that they are bad people but I always make up with them and then i don't think badly about them. If people are selfish, rude or not very kind, then I feel that they are not very good friends. I hope that answered ur question xox|`|YG7nHfLCaa	yeah.<br>  when i'm angry.<br>  when we fight.<br>  when she does something that makes me think badly of her....|`|ejuJiZAAaa	yes<br>  <br>  my answer from exp<br>  <br>  let the feeling be. just mull over it . eventually it will take a higher turn if thats the thing to be<br>  <br>  relax, its normal|`|Gj5WkwG4aa	This is a wrong sentence. <br>  Because if we start thinking bad of a friend, he will be no more a friend. And if we are saying that he is our friend, we cant think of bad about him.<br>  But remember this sentence is right in the case of Bad frienships as well as Pseudo Friendships.

Yes trojan is a good condom, make sure it has spermicidal in it, that will help to prevent pregnancies.   You don't have to shave down there, she has pubic hair as well.  If she wants you to lick her, then do so if you want to.  No your skin will not peel away<br>  Tips:  Did you ever take a sex ed class, if not maybe you should consider it before you have sex.  Have you talked with your Dad or Mom about sex, if not perhaps you should.  Sex is a big step for both boys and girls.  Don't get caught in the cross fire.  Know your information before you jump in the sak.  Good Luck.  I'd wait personally before I jumped in the sak with someone.  Another opportunity will present itself, especially on this topic of conversation.|`|72wkMfr6aa	How old are you man...?<br>  <br>  Dont shave down there it will itch like crazy, just trim it with clippers.<br>  and condom's make it longer but you can't really do anything to make it longer.. you dont get any sickness by licking her spot.. and yah the foreskin is meant to be peeled back when you put the condom on, and it might hurt at first but you'll get used to it..<br>  <br>  Good luckk''|`|VvNKTFhJaa	do lick the spot. it will ease the things. it will hurt her if it is also her 1st time.|`|8Cqv5RDeaa	Its better being a virgin coz your future wife is worth tht fun not any girl who will ditch you.|`|BY2pyHv8aa	first of all are you so shameless to open your personal stuff to every body shameless|`|pL98H8y6aa	How did it go
WzKrZoHQaa	Sorry I disagree with Lisa G on this one I don't think you told us anythng here except you can't talk to her and don't know what to do!  You haven't said why you feel the relationship has broken down which may help us understand how you got here to this present day.  It sounds like it has always been this way - which is quite odd if you have kids.   If so then 8yrs in a one-sided relationship will undoubtedly take its toll.   You mention financial but it can't be that she is about to leave just because you are short at the moment.  No one is that shallow surely or has she got another reason which you are unaware of and maybe using the money angle as final excuse?    Why did you put her on the pedestal in the first place?   If she is THAT good then you will surely try everything in your power to stop her but it sounds like you won't even start to communicate !!!   I don't understand you are about to lose your family here ................ <br>  <br>  The Devil is in the Detail here in your Question  - The price for this non-communication of yours is going to cost you very high indeed - the price of your girlfriend and your kids.  Is that honestly worth it ?  Well just ask yourself that one question.  As it says in the Mastercard Advert - price of communicating with your girlfriend and keeping your kids ????   PRICELE$$     <br>  <br>  Surely just opening your mouth and spilling your heart out to her as to how you feel NOW is the best price to try save your little family ?  Only you can answer this one.  If she still leaves then at least you TRIED but so far it seems you have just let thing progress to rock bottom level and are now trying to salvage the last knockings.  Imagine what it must have been like living with someone that just says he can't communicate all the time and doesn't know how to express any feelings?    This can't have been a good relationship - relationships are meaningful, trusting, caring, close, helpful yet this sounds everything but.  Who makes decisions like where do you go for your annual holiday then ?  Does she just go book it without any consultation whatsoever ?   How on earth did you have kids?  Is she that hard to speak to?  I know I will get slammed for this but WHY do you guys wait until the very last minute to then realise you should have done something long ago ?  Then it is often TOO LATE and you wonder why women need to go speak with a male colleague or a friend's husband and wonder how or why they became close - doh !!    You say you do not argue well where is the problem, if you don't argue then there can't be too much wrong in the first place ??!!??  <br>  <br>  Writing letter is one thing ok but then how does she respond to that ?  So she talks and you write back !!!   Wow great relationship - can you see what I mean here ?   You need a wake up call now before it's too late, I'm sorry but you did ask and I'm trying to be very frank with you here.  Do you keep your entire relationship alive by being penpals in your own home - sorry there is more to this I think and you need to be honest with yourself first.   Has she tried talking to you in any way ?  If you cannot do the most basic of human contact (communicate) then there is little hope for you I'm afraid and you may have already missed the boat so just sit back and wave from the shoreline - after all it doesn't sound like you are even going to try stop her, you'll need to communicate with her so START SHOUTING LOUDLY so she can hear you at the top of that pedestal - I'm sorry to sound full of doom here but it is SIMPLE your girlfriend and your kids are either worth it or not. <br>  <br>  Can you get granny to have the kids for evening and stay over?  Or perhaps a friend can have them especially under the circumstances?  You say money is tight so arrange to cook her a meal, (yes even microwave food is decent and most men can use one)  and a bag of pasta & tuna is pence.  Give her a note - well an invitation really to dinner, get candles, nice music - nothing slushy just a very open, non descript sort of CD and just tell her that you will be cooking tonight.  Run her a bath so you can do what you need to in the kitchen and go over in your head what it is you REALLY want to say to her.   Keep it simple it is not about the food - it is the opportunity for YOU to TALK to her that is all important here.  Ok so you don't drink anyway otherwise I'd say keep alcohol to minimal - you both need a level head.  <br>  <br>  I've tried to find suitable sites for you to browse over - see I am really trying to help you honestly.  It's down to you now NO ONE ELSE.  I wish you luck.  Keep us updated when you choose best answer|`|WDs4fRoxaa	I am not from the UK, but I have a suggestion.<br>  <br>  Write her a letter. <br>  <br>  You seem to be good at expressing yourself in written<br>  form.<br>  <br>  Best wishes|`|7iEk06aDaa	As you NOW know, communication is VERY important in a relatioship. If you can't talk about your feelings, then all your partner can do is guess, and because men and women a re so different, what your thinking  and what she's thinking are not always the same. Are you willing to go to counseling together to save this relationship? Tell her that. She probably feels like she's living in a silent void with no one to talk to. If your both willing to save the family, then get counseling.|`|yQ1UfuZWaa	tell her what u said to me. i have failed miseravly. i have failed not only her and the children but also myself. i am in such a dark place without a light. i dont know what to do. i desperstly want them back. life without them is no life at all. & then throw an apology out there. shes got to know that u really do care and that u can changa. maybe u could go to some kinda family counciling.|`|rVzsV76aaa	stress your love for them
O7ST6Da0aa	He probably thinks you like him but doesn't think you should. What i'm trying to say is he doesn't know why you would like him so he is trying to find out what you are thinking before he puts himself out there afraid that he will make an *** out of himself. Just answer his question then ask yours again, be casual and relax him so he will be comfortable with you.|`|724cUk75aa	i have no idea, but i have noticed that most boys are like that like almost all the boys i know are like that :o|`|95b3c1cab8a1f1f08d03b46eefc17755aa	Because he's nervous, he's a little on the defensive. I would say he's nervous because he really likes you and really wants to make a good impression.<br>  <br>  Be gentle with him. Rather than trying to talk, why not suggest going to a film and watch something silly and funny, and if you are both laughing, then you are both far more likely to relax. And when the date is over, even if he only thaws slightly, give him a kiss on the cheek, and thank him sincerely for a lovely evening. He'll like that.|`|ilbMPWmzaa	insecurity, and they don't want to open up to you, esp. if they're only interested in just a friends with benefits relationship. make sense?|`|sLwQxcNBaa	Guys are idiots at times, they don't know what they are doing, but, act like they do so they don't get made fun of. Only the ones worth it are the ones who don't care what people think and act how they feel.|`|b5be50fedc55289736f6c2d830f978d6aa	He wants you to see he's confident in the conversation, but he is really nervous -perhaps he's an insecure person, so is on the defence.|`|0IG3lEpaaa	It's a defense mechanism.  The guys feels vulnerable. Or, maybe you are asking too personal a question.|`|DmzM4X1Aaa	because they want attention.

And no never too tired. I like head as much as any guy but I like to like the pie and it doesn't take any energy to do either. It sounds like you should try to switch positions half way through, start on top, once you get him started then if he is a normal male he wont want to stop. I love doggie so I have no problem switching to that. If he doesn't bother and is just lazy with the sex then expect it to get worse. You may have to find another guy that will treat you the way you like.|`|3jqcLj7Saa	If your that tired then you that tired. Sounds like someone is just wanting to get a free ride and not put nothing into it. Don't be used, its a two way thing.|`|o91A5r8taa	and yet they say all men care about is sex? <br>  its the other way around apparently ;)|`|XsXokO9paa	Whats the point of this question?|`|Qlyh3pG0aa	Depending on the job, if it is hardlabour for the guy I'd understand that he'd be too tired to pump on top or from the back... speaking from experiences with the Mister. haha. I enjoy it coz then I rape the sh*t outta him and drain all his leftover energy. Then he falls asleep. Then I draw on his face with a permanent marker.

You won't have to wait long anyway since she likes you so don't worry.|`|EsVjwKPAaa	just wait for her.|`|dsqm0x9Waa	you would let her take the lead. when she feels comfortable chasing after you she will. but if you were to chase after her. then she might feel traped between two boys. and she might have said she loves you just to get you off her back. then again it depends on how she said it. if she said it in a long manor, looking straight into your eyes then she really meant it. but if she said it in a email or something then she said it to just get you off her back. but if it has been 3 months and she still is hooked up with her other boyfriend. forget it. there are better girls out there than her. hope i helped!|`|5cKlXUdKaa	I will never understand why this is even a question...why do you want someone who is with someone else...first she is taken, second if she leaves him for you, guess what..she'll leave you for the next guy...I also believe in karma...what you do will be done...so you steal a woman and one will be stolen..find someone available..not a cheater..its a set up|`|hN08l7tLaa	i think you should wait for her, standby her whenever she has problems. dont chase her, if she is going to leave her current bf becos of you, she might do it to you.|`|dSMb8JDvaa	Leave her alone, will you? If she loves you, why she still with her boyfriend and tries to be with another man...Wakie wakie....Step out before it become trouble, is it fare for her boyfriend?..put yourself in his shoes and Think before act stupid..|`|4ILA5CDzaa	Waiting could cause her to think you don't like her ..<br>  Don't get too close though, because if she loves you like she says she does then she would break up with her boyfriend for you .|`|JAR0e43uaa	don't love who have a bf,and if she loves u then she who can comes to u

And, it's not really normal because most guys would want sex, but he's just being a caring man.|`|KOXcw4klaa	well first of all you should break up with your current bf before you even think about another guy.this new guy you like is doing the right thing by waiting.and no not all men want woman just for sex.|`|EsVjwKPAaa	definitely YES! coz that kind of guy has a big respect on YOU! and he is right. he doesn't want you to cheat your bf and he has a respect w/ your bf. <br>  <br>  you can't easily find that kind of a guy. coz as what you've said, most guys only want sex.|`|sLwQxcNBaa	He really likes you and respects you to where he doesn't want to be the guy you cheated with. It seems he wants you to himself. In conclusion its a good thing.|`|Giun40wPaa	he probably doesn't want to start any problems with your boyfriend. he's being careful. not every boy is sex thriving pig you know.<br>  he's respectful. be pleased. lol|`|hN08l7tLaa	maybe he really likes you.|`|jdsRkyKzaa	I do not agree|`|ccde40b80ab5dd4bbd26544e0b567c7eaa	Hi there my friend.  It's because u are still in a relationship.<br>  some men are that way. Not all men want sex,actually it depends<br>  on the manner they were raised. Honestly , the man was right in not having sex with you because you are still in a relationship. You might want to examine your " honest to goodness intentions" towards the nice and shy guy . Do u like him and wants to go on with a serious relationship with him? or do just want to have fun with him?  Knowing your true feelings about the other person might help you discern<br>  the intentions towards this person.|`|d94b5be55d9ee5bb2401ce3ea78773dcaa	He cares about you.
ks2oieV0aa	I think he may be a little controlling.  As far as the exes #.  You probably don't want that anyway....Right?  xox|`|KOXcw4klaa	i can see him not wanting you to have relations with your ex bf.but to move so the ex wont know where you live is very extreme.id be careful with this guy.|`|b3zGfYMpaa	My ex did similar things when we first started dating. He constantly went through my phone for no good reason checking texts and questioning who the guys were. He'd always ask me past questions about ex's and demand answers even though it upset him everytime. Things did escalate when he started getting angry and upset over nothing. Most contact with my friends was shut off because if I wasnt with him I was "screwing him over" and or "cheating", which I wasnt. This is definitely a sign of an insecure guy and where theres insecurity there can also be over protectiveness.<br>   For me, these things werent so obvious in the beginning..I had never dealt with a controlling person plus I was blinded by my feelings for him which alot of girls tend to do. It might not be a surefire sign of disaster in every case, but if any girl asked this question I'd tell her to just beaware. If things do escalate or this type of behavior continues, either tell him how it makes you feel or else reconsider the relationship. In some cases, controlling men can also become abusive, girls need to cautious of this so that they dont fall into the trap. Keep me up to date and I'll help in advising you..Im up for e-mail. Good Luck.|`|3ggolLgQaa	I think its perfectly normal for him to not want u to see your ex.<br>  <br>  All this "we are friends now" is bullshit, sorry, exs cannot be friends.<br>  <br>  As for the moving away, that just plain dumb and unnecessary.<br>  <br>  And you calling your ex is ok but not the other way round? hmmm <br>  So he is not ok with you having contact with your ex but he is ok with you calling him first? <br>  <br>  That does not make sense|`|shvhgzXeaa	Well yes it is. Many of my ex's live around my area and occasionally I bump into them but my fiancee is not bothered by it because she knows its her that I am with and her that I going to get married to. She trusts me that I have no feelings what so ever for my ex's.|`|AA11108018	Yes those are the signs of trying to control you. Next comes any G/ff who can see when can see.  Get out of the relationship before it is to late.  Those kinds of guy like to hit there woman if they don't do what there told|`|j3YRIJafaa	ok with the ex thing, he may really like you and doesnt want there to be a chance you will go back to him therefore he wants you to delete everything to do with him, However if you want to be friends and talk to your ex then he shouldnt have a problem so that does seem a little funny and for you to call him then the other way around is wierd - i dont know this does seem very wierd, if it was me i would talk to him to get a few things clear that if you dont want to delete his number then you wont and if you dont want to move out then you wont and you wont call him all the time he'll have to call you - see how he feels about that - so just talk to him get a few things clear - hope this helps good luck|`|e1owUSxRaa	In a nutshell yes and well spotted so soon.<br>  <br>  The first is a reasonable request, no one wants exes in the picture but the others are definately red flags and need watching if you choose to stay with him.<br>  <br>  Experience is the thing which makes most people notice the small signs that get overlooked in the early stages.  You should be very pleased to have such a good radar that you noticed these seemingly little things early<br>  <br>  I wish it was different but frankly these are warnings and you do well to heed them.<br>  <br>  All success and best wishes sweetie.|`|O7ST6Da0aa	I would say he is more insecure then controlling. It sounds like he is afraid that you will go back to your ex. He may have jealous tendencies that could make him become controlling or even abusive in the future, it may not, but it is a possibility. If you cant reassure him and that be enough then keep your eyes open, you may have to cut him loose.|`|ijPMG5Lwaa	Okay, I can understand he doesn't want you to talk your ex, but moving away is too extreme, unless your ex was abusive to you, which you haven't mentioned.<br>  I would understand then.<br>  I think the phoning part should be both ways.<br>  In fact I'm used to the guy phoning me more than I phone him (but be careful on this..sometimes guys get annoyed if you never call).|`|724cUk75aa	i think you should stay w/ him right now, but be careful. it could mean controlling behavior, but it might not. and i understand about the not hanging w/ your ex, but moving? just a tad bit strange.|`|rdn1lUeTaa	well theres nothing wrong with him wanting u to get rid of that ex's number as ive recently lost my guy to his ex :( but let him call u, maybe put ur ex's number under a girls name

Who talks more about you than any body or anythig else and who cares you a lot.<br>  He will be your real hero..Take care.|`|WCf1thFYaa	As u r having 2 boy friends so they are having u as GF <br>  after all friendship is friendship. <br>  unless or untill some worm enters u r brain to home u want marry.<br>  untill then u r their GF|`|XBmCRRiNaa	just make both of them realize that u r their friend and wil always be a good friend to them|`|YNKakLMraa	choose the right and the person whoom u dont like that
jROpVbrhaa	In a relationship its not all that we want it to be.Love is sacrifice most of all. If you love him, give him space, dont think too far that he will ruin your relationship always.Maybe a one on one , serious talk can do.Just be calm and understanding.Guys like girls a lot who are forgiving and also there for them.But if it becomes worst and you cannot handle anymore.Then go.Dump him .Never look back.Good luck.|`|pLkeooJ1aa	You're comfortable with your life, but he makes you miserable?<br>  <br>  Yeah, dump him.|`|DybOqfGpaa	hmm i think give him a lill space try to find some new hobbies engage ur self so that u will have lill time to think abt him when u will do this he will feel curious and get back to u and start caring for u|`|dJoE8yedaa	He's not worth it. Dump him and find someone better.|`|g2XbXYyraa	haah|`|VYWh9iyjaa	being miserable and second best ...how can that be comfortable?<br>  <br>  I know i've been there... a lot of fighting for a few years [we were very young] two kids and 20 years later and we're still together. God knows why sometimes, but like you it's to do with having a place in the universe... comfort/convenience or maybe not being able to live without them??? who knows. oh! I guess it could have something to do with love and you don't feel wanted or appreciated when he does these things, but when he's not doing these things it's all good and life is on track, it just derails every now and then, pick yourself up and dust yourself off and get ready for a bumpy ride or do something I never did and make a life for yourself first and then find a nice who will treat you right.<br>  <br>  Why don't you start going pout with girlfriends get drunk and do some stupid things and then he will want to stay home to keep you out of trouble he he!!|`|8udo6hImaa	girl, im with you.. but regardles how serious the relationship a man always seems to put himself first and then his girl.. <br>  i hate to say it but a man will always be a man and when you see the true person they are, they will NEVER change ive tried with mine and its been almost 4 years.. not a change has happened.. and i know not to expect one although im still trying.. <br>  <br>  goodluck|`|NPlB39Ekaa	try to cool off for a while then ask him why did he do that?? if his reason is because he is drunk.. that's not the reason..he should think the right of yours..we'll go for it ^_^|`|ise05jjUaa	Ok first of all were these his plans as well, that you were suppose to come over and stay the night?  Or were these your plans?  If they were your plans then obviously his plans weren't the same as yours & therefore you would have no reason to be mad, but if you planned this together then yes he's a jerk & he should have at least invited you out.  At the same time, maybe he just needed to have some fun with his friends.  I think if you were comfortable with your life & being with him you wouldn't be this upset about it as you said its happened before so it shouldn't be any surprise to you.
zGFiWSPtaa	Hey don't worry about it, the same thing is happening to me and it's all okay. Maybe if your school's guys don't like you, go out more. Go to camps, go to parties, go to clubs and smile at guys and let your inner flirt out!!! I haven't had a guy, and my school has guys who aren't interested, but when I went to a party I talked to a guy the whole time and had a great time. Also, I went to another country and there was this supersweet guy who said he'd protect me at the beach (the waves were reallly strong)! YOu will get a guy, you rock!!!!<br>  <br>  GOOD LUCK!!!|`|nbtZ4ixoaa	I have completely gone through this stage, trust me its normal, everyone else will be feeling exactly the same want for a boyfriend<br>  <br>  primark guy may have been lovely but would will (probably) never see him again so lets be more realistic<br>  <br>  a great way to meet new people is to join some local club, such as a sports club, or drama, or choir depending on your interests, and even if you don't meet a great guy there you will make more friends, and its always nice to get more friends.<br>  <br>  at your age quite often guys aren't looking for girlfriends as they are quite immature so just give it time and i'm sure you will find someone who will appreciate you for who you are :)<br>  <br>  keep me updated :)
RN1wGlWWaa	Next year - the taxes you file this year (2009) are for your income, living arrangements in 2008 - not 2009.|`|CPxmHjx4aa	you can file taxes together for 2009 as a married  couple..|`|THWHHHRWaa	you will have to wait until next year, as in 2008, you were not married, and thats the taxes you are filing.|`|8tGAE1Nmaa	If u lived together u can file taxes but to do it under the married status u have to be married before january 1st..|`|T3BXC8qXaa	Next year. :)|`|uBXYugNYaa	You'll get more if you file apart
pLkeooJ1aa	You don't have to stop being her friend all together, just pull away a little. Let her be with this douche, let her justify the relationship to herself. Let her make these mistakes. If you keep stepping in and pointing out the flaws before she can recognize them herself, she will never find a good guy on her own.<br>  <br>  If you love her, and want to be there for her, then be ready to catch her when she falls, but let her fall. It's the only way to learn.<br>  <br>  You're a good friend.|`|80bc9ac3af8ceeb5b69ac3461ec5d0f7aa	You have to realize that you can only do or say so much as a friend. She has fallen into an abusive situation, and he is now isolating her.  Like the above person said ....pull away.  It does not have to be drastic.  You have to set some limits with her so that you are able to keep a handle on yourself and deal with her at the same time.
CkAU0Tcpaa	stay friends but try to give each other space
zOWLZkXraa	Well, buy a gym membership together at least you can spend time with her doing healthy activities, show her you care about her not only her looks and she will see you are spending time with her.  Gym has lots of equipment this i recommend.|`|Qlyh3pG0aa	A whip. So you can whip her when shes eating something wrong.|`|IPS3hWweaa	Yeah, some clothes, put them on, take a picture, and change that one with the one you have for an avatar right now. Thanks! Now that I don't have wang in my face I can answer your question.<br>  <br>  Most treadmills are solid so go with one, but if you want a cheaper way, try going on walks together. Maybe she thinks you aren't worth working out for, so show her you're serious Mr. Man.|`|d8yrvK4waa	A jungle gym.. yay!<br>  <br>  SteveC
ise05jjUaa	The way I look at it, a lot of men & women especially when we're younger go for looks first because that's what usually attracts us to the person to begin with.  If you think about it, lets say I'm walking down the street & I see this girl who I think is gorgeous, other than what she looks like I don't know anything about her personality other than maybe the type of fashion she's into by what kind of clothes she's wearing.  For all I know she could be an alcoholic, she could be a lesbian, I know nothing about her so there's no way for me to really judge her on her personality right from the start.  Once I've introduced myself to her, that's when I start to take an interest in her as far as her job, family, friends & so on.  I think with some people as they get older & they've struck out constantly in their love life looks aren't all that important anymore, they just want someone who's going to be there to love them & love in return.  I like a girl with confidence definitely, shy from the start yes when it comes to dating but in all other aspects of her life as far as her job, school & other things like that I would like her to be confident.  A person's personality will make or break a potential relationship, just because she's gorgeous doesn't mean I'd stay with her if she's got a really bad personality.  Her looks will only take her so far, that's probably to the bedroom & that's about it.|`|shvhgzXeaa	Looks obviously has some factor in it but personality is priority. I like a girl with confidence but not over the top like she thinks she is gods gift or a celebrity. If I date a girl who is shy and she doesn't have confidence then over a slow period of time I hopefully can give her that confidence.|`|OOwUlO4Jaa	Hi and hope you are well, let me start by saying guy's only like a confident woman because they don't have to worry about their shyness. Over confident women can be so intimadating for a guy as well. this sounds a little confusing but the best and most respectful advice I could give you is simply be yourself. CAPE DIUM, if an oppertunity arises for you to take, then don't leave it for the guy to take advantage of, make your own destany. Love is a wonderful thing and not a fashon acsessory. when you truly find it, it is the most precious thing you have and the most valuable. answering your questions, Personallity is by far the most important than looks and laughter is more important than any physical relationship you may want to have. So many people on here are looking for a BF or GF to make a statement or because it's cool to have one, I remember when the excitment to getting a girl would fill my mind, I would stay awake at night thinking of different ways to express my feelings to her, where to take her so she could be free to be excited about what I would do next, hanging onto every word I would say, I would be looking at her responce to see what she likes and dis-likes. building on a firm foundation of fun and innocence before taking anything to the next level. She was "In Love" with someone else and now she is my wife, not because I stole her from her man, but cos I connected with her as a person and we had fun. Hope this is helpful, best of luck in all you do and all you talk to.|`|CX7o9faQaa	Looks and personality are great in a chick and if they are confident it helps
wia9SXCPaa	I think it would be a very fun and interesting life if your not the real jealous type.  Musicians need to put on that front that they are available to some extent to keep interest.  That's not to say that they would be unfaithful it just means there would always be temptation.<br>  <br>  Give a woman several drinks over the course of a night and if the situation is right of course its possible that she would offer herself to one of these types of men.<br>  <br>  Like I said if your in that type of relationship it would help if your not the jealous type.|`|IDrA6gMxaa	I am sure it will be OK, as he will only work there. There will be many temptations, but usually people who work in such places want to leave once the job is finished. It is fun only for customers :)<br>  <br>  So I would not worry much, as this is a job like all the others.|`|AA10240683	Sometimes they do, sometimes they do not. The real question is would he take advantage of these women in a drunken state. If you are insecure now about this, I suggest you put the marriage off for a while.|`|dOPYcWj0aa	Some women do throw themselves at musicians. Your best bet, if you want to be with this man, is to go along and see first hand what goes on. Dont wait until after your married to go to one of his gigs, and then decide its not something you can live with.|`|6cm6MB66aa	LOL well yes woman come on to guys like that all the time . I don't care if the guy is fat with zits covering his forehead  something about a band and alcohol that drive woman right into there arms .
seMpUL8Kaa	Well, I know when I first started dating guys, I always settled for what I could because, being bullied most of my life, I considered it lucky that any guy would even notice me. I now realise how stupid that was of me but that's life, you make mistakes and hopefully learn from them, which I did and now, I'm with the most amazing person ever. I love him so much and he loves me back. I never thought I would ever find someone who I could say "I love you" to and mean with so much conviction. I could never settle for second best ever again after experiencing this.|`|Y8kjVeLyaa	I did...I ended it and met my husband within a month...we've been together for five years now.|`|YlS8gnCiaa	i have<br>  It was a bad relationship , i didnt even want to kiss him , i'd flinch away <br>  <br>  but i stayed because I knew there was no one else and I hate being single|`|8db85fd4b33941a8f3ba450c709d9159aa	i stayed in a relationship like that, but there is someone out there that might love you but you got to try until you are successful, i did and found somone|`|qy07K2k5aa	I have been in such a relationship before, but I now realize that it's foolish of me to have such a mentality. There are others who love me too.|`|KOXcw4klaa	i never felt that way.sure im single now,have been for a while.but eventually the right one will come along.|`|9ua9hwImaa	Been there a few times early on, but not any more!<br>  <br>  There's plenty more people out there for everyone!

pLkeooJ1aa	Is it possible to retaliate?<br>  <br>  The next time she hits you, knock her to the ground and sit on her.<br>  <br>  Be the dominant sibling.|`|Shp5riE6aa	Since she is so small, I don't think you should do anything back.|`|oTWpoIJdaa	Well, when I was growing up.  You did not hit, push, insult etc. anyone unless you wanted that back commensurate with their size and age.  There was a hierarchy in the family.  First came the elders, parents, older siblings and younger siblings.  The older is responsible for the younger which means if your older brother or sister corrected you, it was swift and painful.  Parents only intervene if it is excessive or unwise.<br>  <br>  You should choose a parent that is most understanding and explain how your younger sister is not only attacking you but your friends and how they have been hurt.  (Parents are more likely to respond when there are witnesses.)|`|RKMxAKDIaa	tell your mum and dad maybe also try explaining to her what she does is wrong and say if she continues to do this you wont talk to her|`|xBUNpdgIaa	try sitting down with you parents and telling them that its not right for her to be so violent, especially if its to your friends.
BXaAhMOKaa	yes .... if the person has a lot of self respect and self esteem in herself .....someone lyk me....and i'm proud to be that....because showing someone ur naked body is not a very good idea.....because the real beuty is in your thoughts!!!!|`|JAR0e43uaa	Virginty is not what u think.....virginty is the clearness and the purity...some people haven't make sex but they think about sex all time long....when they meet girl they smile to her but they hide they think how to jump on bed with her...its not virginity.....but when u meet a girl and smile for her to look at her beautifull eyes and enjoying her presense and the sound of her laughter then its realy nice,also if making love in that way could mean virginity...becuse its something clear....so people who don't think dirty can still virgin till them death,even if they make love milion times....thats what i think about virginity:)|`|5j4n87R2aa	yes its good to be virgin to offer yourself to your life partner :) in india sri lanka they do it|`|M5RU6jMVaa	Yeap!I am a virgin , and I will stay virgin till I get married.|`|CWiQE0rvaa	Unfortunate ...!|`|Vq1pCqMuaa	bro practicallly its nt possible <br>  but sm1 must doin fuckin wid u<br>  <br>  <br>  so who is ///////////////?|`|WiFVIq3Iaa	in india they do|`|59cnZfTeaa	They can... whether they would want to is a different question.|`|CgqQLj2vaa	yap! absolutely one can . dude' don't get inspired by seeing hollywood movies. well! i think a virgin is more cool than it's opposite. <br>  <br>  hey! waise what's the opposite of virgin.|`|OEv8gjPxaa	yes you can be a virgin at any age, i only lost mine when i got married at 21|`|77mFvGFuaa	i'm 14 and i want too!<br>  i don't want to  have sex till i'm married.|`|6GLxkNNIaa	of course why not? its depend on their mental balance even i was virgin till age of 23|`|3eff3a7feb2cf562e15e886a846418f4aa	I dont see why not.. i know a girl whos almost 31 and shes a Virgin.|`|jp5lfmzTaa	Whats wrong in it. Tere are many , even at 60, 70 or above and remaining virgin.|`|xsvDrtrRaa	maybe if she has a self respect and really believe in preserving herself for the right one. or if shes a nun|`|3lKAR9G2aa	I'm a guy and stayed a virgin until 22 or 23.  I respected my gf and waited, then broke up with her before getting any.  Sex is a decision that everyone has to make on their own.  My virginity was the main topic of my friends for years.  Just be comfortable with any decision you make.|`|z9WXNOsWaa	You can stay virgin till WHENEVER you feel like.<br>  Virginity is not smth to be ashamed of and also it's not smth that you should get rid off just like that. <br>  But it all depends on you|`|scmlFlDhaa	yes. staying virgin has nothing to do with the age, it relates to the person's preferences.|`|jROpVbrhaa	Why not? Me i lost my virginity at age 26.Just when i married my husband now for 18 yrs.Nothing wrong with me.
0UOiAZrpaa	How would he know... unless u were going around announcing ur a virgin or ur going around sleeping with guys and people are talking how would he find out?|`|qdsVS1dDaa	Charlotte, hymens are like gals-they are all different. It is not always a traumatic, bloody event when a gal looses her virginity. One who has a very thin hymen may break it before having sex through some exercise or athletic event, such as playing badminton or tennis, or whatever. I would guess that this last applies to you. In any case, your virginity is gone forever, and I hope that you celebrated this event. <br>  <br>  Regards,<br>  Dan|`|3CXfqxcgaa	Might of been his first time and didn't know|`|DZ23afDLaa	He did not know because you were doing things in bed that a virgin would not know how to do. you were probably acting like a Professional .|`|hX9cHdyMaa	cos ur probably really hot and he never figured to that a girl like u wold ever date a guy like him<br>  <br>  lol<br>  hope i helped<br>  cya|`|VvNKTFhJaa	he may be 'too small & thin'.
mDQZnI7gaa	You could say "maybe". I would think that was cute ;)<br>  <br>  But if you see him glancing at you, you should look back for a little longer than a glance, smile and look away. That would drive ME crazy! and I would get me even more interested if I was a little interested.  This would only work if he's attracted to you though. Just dont stare because thats a little weird and can get annoying.  But look at him long enough so that its not a glance and not a stare. Make sense? lol|`|ikS4bAg9aa	LOOK AT HIM BACK!!!<br>  so that he will know you like him..<br>  otherwise you might miss the chance,<br>  as when he looks at you, it mean he likes you.. :D<br>  congratz!!! =D<br>  <a href="http://poemspoemsforlife.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://poemspoemsforlife.blogspot.com/</a>|`|HqpIfE3caa	Nah eye contact is good.

When your eyes meet give him a little smile.  It will tell him you are interested.  If he doesn't get the message, try a big hammer.  But be careful, the bigger the hammer you need to get his attention, the more brain dead he may be already.|`|dJoE8yedaa	Have the guts and hold his gaze. Make it like a game. Whoever looks away first loses. Try it and see what happens.|`|VvNKTFhJaa	Look into his eyes directly if you want to know he is interested or not.
MQKscLn6aa	Give him a tight slap! LOL|`|jROpVbrhaa	Give him some braintwister books.They are not that expensive and yet it gives him the time to relax.Like (Sodoku book)
MQKscLn6aa	Start going out with boys. Lesbian is not secuality, its a frame of mind developed by always staying close to girls. Get a life. Be outgoing. Guys can be much more fun than girls.|`|DybOqfGpaa	sorry no comments|`|djUMvICoaa	Give her a chance reschedule, if she cancels again, rethink.|`|zD1kqEgnaa	i think that no one should judge you or make you into thinking that you have to be straight just like an answer on here which i think is wrong and no i am not a lesbian but i totally think you should give her another chance and maybe ask her out another time next week and if she cancels one more time then just forget about her.|`|ewbt4HYjaa	i think that you should give her another chance and let her reschedule because she obviously gave you another chance when you had to cancel on her

iogL3GFVaa	yea, it is true. For me at least sex meant a step up in the relationship, so that meant that I had to care enough about him to have sex with him. Although I actually waited until marriage to have sex, so there was that extra commitment as well.|`|t7jiSmjVaa	That is true for women. If her heart isn't into the act of sex then it is called rape !|`|AFGxrXSyaa	technically its your brain. it releases chemicals into your body that make you feel good.|`|DWW9Ri8Jaa	Sex isn't everything.|`|jROpVbrhaa	Well thats true, because your heart is the powerful art of the body when it comes to love.So yes.|`|3lKAR9G2aa	Women need a reason to have sex.

YtT9uGOSaa	Say NO, you are already sounding insecure about this potential relationship so why put yourself through unnecessary drama.  You will always be wondering if he is thinking about her and it will drive you crazy.|`|6wYD6Z7Faa	I mean you can answer yes but you will be wonder whether or not he really likes you and you have to ask yourself if you want a headache like that.  It is kinda hard to be in a relationship with someone who doesn't really like you.   Good Luck|`|ccde40b80ab5dd4bbd26544e0b567c7eaa	Hi there <br>  <br>  The greatest gift of all times is LOVE. I can understand where you're coming from . Sometimes despite the beautiful feeling that love can offer, it can also offer bitterness, or confusion.   Love is simply love!  Before I continue, you must remember that You are vested with the most incredible gift within your heart, the POWER TO LOVE!  There are two ways that u can use that power.  First U can satisfy your heart in order to experience what it dictates u.  In the case that you are in right now, you are being chosen as a ' heartache relief" , the question however is are you willing to put up with the consequences of it? If ....the answer is YES, then  only you can answer the question.  The second way is letting go and letting be, which means in the right time, at the right place with the right person, love will find it's way to you.   Take care gurl and sweetest happy thoughts to you|`|Sz4HyuL7aa	I think you should not say yes even though he asks you cause he still loves that girl! The best way to get him is make him forget that girl by asking the girl to reject him. Maybe it makes him despressed but by that time, you can encourage him or give him some power or support. Then slowly he'll love you. Good luck!
sN0MYpFfaa	I went through something similar like this.  I got a no for an answer, and we decided to stay friends.  We weren't just friends... more like great friends...she would usually give me a daily update on what was happening with her crush, and would look to me for support.  After a month of this, I couldn't take it anymore, and I said I needed a "time-out".<br>  <br>  I always felt that I'd rather have her in my life as a friend, than not at all.  But, it proved to be too difficult.<br>  <br>  In my experience, the feeling that you are experiencing will not go away soon enough if you are in touch everyday.  The only thing you can do is keep him out of your mind and out of your sight.  If you don't actually see him with another girl, maybe it won't hurt as much.<br>  <br>  The time-out kinda numbed the pain for me.  My friend was so offended at my suggestion that we haven't talked since (over a month now).  But, the heartache is virtually gone, and I can't wait to end this 'time-out'.<br>  <br>  After the time-out, to ensure that the pain and the jealousy doesn't come back... make sure you have a boyfriend.  Obviously, your first choice is NA, but get someone on your top 5.  Despite having a boyfriend, if you still feel any heartache, there is a chance he will too.  If he does, then there is a chance that the two of you might be together.<br>  <br>  And... a word of advise.  Talking about your pain never helps.  When you do the talking... you'll start feeling petite, like you are at his mercy or else the complete opposite (arrogant, and controlling).  But at the end of the day, it will make it more awkward for both you.  <br>  <br>  If he shared your feelings, he wouldn't put you in such a position in the first place.  So, try to accept the fact that you two won't be together.  That is kinda what I am trying.|`|Likst1Mxaa	listen:<br>  HE DOES NOT WANT TO BE WITH YOU.<br>  <br>  And if he doesn't... there's not much you can do. I'm not saying find someone else... just try to get over it. Also, don't hang out with him, it will help cure your crush :)|`|SxgOy9uPaa	Get two tickets to somewhere,a movie,car race,a goddamn opera,anything.. Then ask can you help with this,i got two tickets ,2 nowhere,would you please come with me..One off deal,no shame,no blame type thing..IF he says no, go with your girlfriend or perish the thought,maybe your mother or brother..Still only one off deal..Have known this to work,in the past..The Guy thinks not costing me why not..For what it's worth little one,think you a bit hasty with the caps.."NO I WILL NOT"is pretty positive..Think you got a lot of growing up yet to do,am i wrong with this thought???MY very best wishes to you & jolly good luck with what ever you decide..Stay well & enjoy life..|`|Giun40wPaa	well firstly. i would not ask him again to go out with you. <br>  i suggest you just talk to him, be friendly with him. let him really get to knoo you. you cant force him to like you, so just be friendly nd stuff.<br>  when he really gets to see you really and for who you are, he'll probably end up really liking you.<br>  hope this helps!<br>  x|`|fCPocLtGaa	well, since u like him so much, why not try the 'art of seduction' method. like, one moment u appear just like that, but the next moment you're really talented, the next moment you are sporty, blahblah. let him be 'surprised' each time he sees you!|`|CyHJlCZXaa	I hate to say it, but there is nothing else you can do. He's made it clear where he stands and you shouldn't force him to change his mind.<br>  <br>  Just be yourself around him and he may change his mind.|`|uGHV15mPaa	You should just wait and hopefully his feeling will change, wait for 2 weeks and your feeling will cool down|`|YFokFwKfaa	Well You Should Say Hi TO him Here and There To GEt your Attention and if you guys have class together you should talk to him|`|UUmtygTEaa	you already did all you could do. just stay friends with him i guess. make him chase you or something. or you could just try to impress him.|`|lsfVytmkaa	JUST EAT AN APPLE AND ULL FEEL BETTER LIKE SOOOO|`|k1xebxJ0aa	wel... just tel lhim how u feel all u can do and if nothing happens nothing happens|`|5t55youaaa	I know how you feel.. I've had problems similar to this in the past. And as amazing as the thought of being with the guy sounds, when they don't want to go out with you, it's probably better to leave it that way. <br>  <br>  It seems a painful idea to try and get over a guy who you think is absolutely fantastic, but I've found in my experience that its for the best. If the guy can't see how awesome you would be to have as a girlfriend, then that must prove that he shouldn't have you. <br>  <br>  Maybe he is scared about what would happen to your relationship that you had before you were going out if you broke up. <br>  <br>  Its a sensitive subject, and having been through this kind of thing before, I can definitely say that it's the best idea. You'll find another amazing guy who is willing to be in a relationship with you.<br>  <br>  My advice is, at your own pace, find other guys that will treat you nicely and like you for who you are.
AA11717874	a gift is a gift and gifts are supposed to be given with no strings attached. you don't have to give anything he has given you back to him unless you want to|`|shvhgzXeaa	If he hasn't asked for it back keep it and like you said he was abusive so why even meet him. I am glad your out of this relationship and hope you find someone in the future who is deserving of you.|`|3lKAR9G2aa	Mail him a box of ashes.  Then mail him some 4 day old food you pull out of a dumpster.|`|6wYD6Z7Faa	yeah keep it as a memento of why you don't need to be in an abusive relationship.|`|pre1k4Pqaa	hi it depends on how u feel about keeping it some would just give it away because that part of there life is past so has he .|`|AFGxrXSyaa	keep it.|`|O9ulG3Thaa	Keep it!! He gave you the present whilst you were together and you should never return a present, plus it could mean a way of getting into contact with one another again.<br>  <br>  If you don't like it or reminds you too much of him then just get rid of it, but never give a present back once you've broken up!|`|TqdT2PAgaa	Your being way to nice for all the trouble you have put up with.

pLkeooJ1aa	Don't write a letter, it comes off less professional and more snotty (you can't read inflection).<br>  <br>  Just sit down with her one day and tell her that you can't afford to split the enormous bills, and feel it isn't quite fair that you should pay for half when you aren't even home half the time. Keep a level tone and keep the conversation professional. There is a lesser chance of an argument that way.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|EsVjwKPAaa	that's really hard and that happens to everyone who leaves in a shared apartment / room... why not talk to here in person. don't be afraid to face here. but if you really can't, then try to find another apartment.

5a59f2926e5aa514f16aceb0fdd90804aa	I am sailing in the same boat with you. I just found out that my best mate is Gay. We time to time joked about being gay but he had a move at me and tried to kiss me. It has not sank into me yet. We still talk but when I visit him I can't sleep over. <br>  <br>  I would say being Lesbian is not bad as long as she don't make a move on you if you differ with her on sexuality.|`|Tjr9aObNaa	No, just treat her the same and be there for her. She can't help what she is.|`|BaNrweQ4aa	just treating her exactly the same could make her feel a bit better :)|`|asAWGIgnaa	one of my best mates is bisexual, she loves girls and likes guys lol. some of my mates were totally freaked out and were like, wat if she fancies me, an i was like, yeh dont think your her type, dont count yourself so lucky and she thinks of u more like a sister, so if thats what your worried about dont be. my mate found it really hard at frist, thought everyone would judge her, so youve just got to be there for her and talk to her about it. just be a good mate. i love my friend whatever she does and what ever she is, she has bad trates, she is a dirrty ****** an is a slight alcholic, that bit she takes after me, and its funny that these trates have nothing to do with her being gay. who you like doesnt make you the person who you are remeber that, and just be there for her!!!|`|cYsPx9sSaa	my friend told me that too, at first i was so freaked out, i couldnt help it i stayed away from her, then i realised that shes still the same person i dont agree with her sexual preference but im not going to give up our friendship|`|Likst1Mxaa	lol.<br>  if she's came out then she's probably depressed because she's worried about how other people will react.<br>  just treat her like you used to. still talk to her about guys and whatever else you used to :)|`|NPhepcBkaa	just dont treat her any differently <br>  and she needs to accept what she is.|`|Y60IEiqWaa	just be supportive, keep telling her that she's still your best friend, and that you;re glad that she feels she can be totally honest with you.<br>  <br>  also, keep reminding her that it's just who she is, and no-one can change that, help her to see that being a lesbian isn't going to stop her having fun, or being happy.<br>  <br>  this happened with me and my best friend, and she was the same way, but now she;s fine, and even has a girlfriend, hope this helps. =]|`|xbwrht2Haa	Just be there for her , tell her theres loads of people like her and theres nothing to be scared of and that she is who she is and she should be proud .Tell her everything gona be the same as always .|`|vmgeXHsraa	She is your friend, just be there for her and tell her its just a matter of acceptance., once she learned to accept that, she will feel better...|`|SOx6VwYCaa	Treat her the same and dont be awkward around her.|`|1iOsKZvIaa	Just treat her the same.

ilbMPWmzaa	thats a tough question...i'd be worried too. i think driving to his house would be fine, it shows that you care and are concerned. he'll basically have no other choice but to talk to you. but pick a time when you know 100% that he'll be home so you dont waste time and gas. good luck, i hope i helped!<br>  <br>  he may have thought about what you did, and after letting it sink in, became really angry with you. you invaded his privacy. he's probably cheating, so maybe this is his way of saying the relationship is over....but still go to his house for some closure.|`|0sJ7nsJ4aa	It depends what the disagreement was about.<br>  Does he have a right to be mad at you? Then I would understand his reaction and do anything to get him back (which includes driving to his place).<br>  If he doesn't have a right to be mad at you, I would be very pissed off & probably move on.|`|CkpzuduCaa	i know how you feel. my ex gf lives in kansas. i wanted to see whats the town is like.  but she thinks it would be uncomfortable of havin me over. i guess i can/t. well go over and find out whats wrong.|`|PdW09cmOaa	First how long have you guys been together? I think if you go searching be prepared that you might find something you wont like?|`|a05818703edf627a70c2368c5b12f69daa	no its not a good idea to go there, as u really don't know whats going on with him. give him time to get over the argument, u can't push someone to open up to u. plus what if u did go there and find out something u didn't want to, it would hurt u more then had u left it alone for awhile.|`|jROpVbrhaa	Well it depends if how long is your relationship? Are you at the right age? And are you ready to face the consequences.Coz ive gone tru this too.We are really committed with each other, but when we had an argument i dint expect that he will not visit me nor ans my calls.So what i did , i went to their place only to find out he is still angry with me.But when i explain my side all things end well.And he told me , that bec of what i did, he loved me the more.Oh so sweeet. Good luck.
AA10051241	It sounds like he wants to spend some time with you since he has already said he wants to meet up with you privately. So, ask him what he likes to do for fun. If he mentions anything you like, ask him if he would like to do it together. Arcade, skate, study, movie??|`|8db85fd4b33941a8f3ba450c709d9159aa	they mostly say the boys should ask girls out but if so then ask your friends to tell him to ask your out or you can just ask him out right away if he olny talks to you more and meets with you the most then yes he likes you.|`|Jo7CoNXEaa	Hey =]<br>  To tell you the truth, I think he could be interested in you but it sounds like he might be using you.<br>  See if you can have conversations, if you can only do physical stuff with him he isnt right for you .<br>  get to know him better first =]|`|bCXrluMQaa	If you like him i think you should but it's your choice. sounds like he likes you. pokemon rules!|`|ObZChw3paa	Ask him U idiot!|`|NFvZDiNSaa	r u stupid!? he loves you! go from him babe! :D xxx|`|sLwQxcNBaa	You gotta risk it to get the biscuit...Go for it and see what happens or spend your days wondering what could of happened.|`|3wnmupJtaa	yeah just ask him but style it out dont ask to blaytantly or looks like your begging trust he blatz likes you|`|724cUk75aa	sure totally. if he asked u to meet up privately......... snogged twice..... you should go for it!|`|QYC6n7pLaa	hahah, ask him out. it makes it easier for us. :P|`|8ChAefLOaa	yez|`|b6RqNpV9aa	ya ask duhhhh no brainer......... im blonde and even i kno that. lol
V8dXKTGzaa	Well... You can always try to get a job and help him with the gas problems from there, just hope that you get the weekends off ;)<br>  <br>  And I don't think he will be insulted by it, but he would be pleased by it if he is nice enough. I sure would be ^_^ (Gas is too much nowadays)|`|shvhgzXeaa	Just tell him that you feel it is unfair on him and that you would like to contribute to the gas. Or maybe once or twice a month try and get to his place.|`|rijndrSQaa	XD Wow.  Be glad it's only an hour.<br>  <br>  Now, if you're in a nice happy relationship, he shouldn't be insulted by you wanted to help out- tango takes two to work.  So, just discuss it with him.  Maybe you can get a gas card, give him some cash, or just pay for the meals when you go out.<br>  <br>  I was in a similar, slightly farther situation for a while.  Basically I just let him know I felt bad, payed for some of our dates, though he wouldn't take cash for gas most of the time (but he had enough money) and got my car and license ASAP (after about 6 months).|`|3zg7oBA5aa	My boyfriend and I live far away from eachother.  He has to take a plane to get here (from new zealand, to the US) so I pay for half.<br>  <br>  we see eachother every 6 months or so.<br>  <br>  For the times that we aren't there for eachother, we play online MMO's together to keep in touch and help the distance not seem as long. (We met on an MMO)  <br>  <br>  I think offering to pay for half of the gas money isn't a bad idea, why would he be insulted?  What's the worst that would happen.. he'd say no? Big deal.  Ask him, and if he says no maybe you can do something else for him.  (take him out to the movies or cook him va big fancy dinner) whatever you can think of.<br>  <br>  the best thing to do to maintain a long distance relationship is communication.  if you can't communicate, then it wont work. <br>  <br>  good luck honey!|`|cd0AdJpDaa	hi mercy . i m pretty much in the same situation as u. i live 90 miles from my girlfriend and visit her once a month. i dont have the luxury of  a car as your partner. i think he might get offended if u offer him money for gas.<br>  The best idea would be to make the trip worthy of the money for him. you could show love and extra care for the efforts he takes to meet you.            a simple thanks would be the best thing he will hear from u after the trip. <br>  good luck and be happy.|`|Ieq0zzdeaa	through letters, through phone or even through net and if finally you want to marry, then consult some expert in international law.
oQkwZhXpaa	Okies first off it sounds as though you had some real problems with your ex..she sounds horrible...so do not under any circumstances let her or the thought of her ruin what you have now. Just because your ex was like that doesn't mean all girls are..I think you are insecure because of the way you were previously treated..i think you and your girlfriend need each other..she sounds a genuine nice person, someone worth keeping :) <br>  <br>  My feeling is she'll stick around..you obviously think the world of her..giver her lots of cuddles and treat her nice..just be a nice guy and she'll appreciate it..nice decent guys are hard to find so i think she'll want to hold on to you. <br>  <br>  As for the texts or calls..sometimes the network lags ad texts dont go through for hours.. or she may just be busy..don't take it as she is ignoring you or wants to leave you when that is most probably not the case..you sound like you really love her and im sure she can see it.<br>  <br>  I do have some idea of how you feel..I cry myself to sleep some nights coz I think the guy I like doesnt like me back..but hey..life's too short..get out there and enjoy what you have.<br>  <br>  Good luck..You'll be OK =D|`|95b3c1cab8a1f1f08d03b46eefc17755aa	Get professional help with this, because your ex has really messed you up big time - and not all women are like her.

HfoO77gpaa	i think you should have a nice cosy meal at home just the two of you. romantic candles over a home cooked meal. <br>  just enjoy a nice evening with good food, not much stress and pamper each other. wear something nice. get some balloons. bake a cake. write a nice card. put up a banner in the hall that says happy birthday. you could go out for a drink before dinner or something. that's not expensive. laugh enjoy yourselves despite the significance of the time of year for you. i'm sure your dad would be happy seeing you laugh instead of cry too! :-)|`|20da7e19a185ca8c01b2a311761afcd6aa	Have a picnic.

0tU4jkS9aa	it sounds like he was shy and was scared to talk to you because he might say something stupid to embarass himself.<br>  <br>  can someone answer my open questions??|`|ks2oieV0aa	Maybe he isn't interested in a relationship right now. and he doesn't want to lead you on.  Good Luck  xox|`|HRdhOacDaa	Well...has anything happened before the incident?<br>  Maybe he doesn't want to lead you on or something like that. Maybe...you could confront him? Like ask him nicely first and not launch into a whole accusation.

a3422bad6666b60894e80bace0f14387aa	That's about average to high, in my opinion, but it would also depend on how the dress is constructed. That type of alteration would run ~$75 in my mom's shop. Like your mom said, if you take it down to the fashion district you may get it done cheaper. If you can't find anyone to do it for less, $100 is not a crisis price, it's fair-to-high. <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|mkrKHQvFaa	Yes that is a very good price for that type of alteration.  I am paying 100 for them to just bring up the length in my dress and yours requires alot more time!  Good luck.|`|6utUL9Hiaa	That is actually REALLY cheap for the alterations you need done.  I would go for it if you like the alterations person's work.|`|FnMH7tREaa	that is an awesome price- if the work is done correctly.  my alterations were over $250 and all they did was shorten the length and sew in some bra cups.|`|nDHyeDVoaa	Yeah, that's a pretty good price. When I had my wedding dress tailored at the bottom, David's Bridal charged me $50. Just to shorten the bottom!|`|3Rr5SAhhaa	Thats a great price! Jump on it before hse changes her mind! David's bridal charged me $100 just for the hem!!|`|q8eue7CRaa	SUPER cheap! Make sure they're good!!!!!!|`|lgxE5nUoaa	That's a great price.  I'd say go for it.|`|AA11380378	That is a BARGAIN! Take it and run with it|`|JtEBaOdjaa	That's a GREAT price.  ESPECIALLY in Manhattan where everything is always more expensive. lol<br>  Check with David's Bridal first.  You may be able to get free alterations because you bought the dress there.  If not, the price you have is GREAT!|`|AkUhaMm9aa	that is cheap but be careful..ask for references or ask her to show you anything else that she has made..just so you know her work is good quality..then you'll know if you are actually getting a good deal..|`|b328a9d35b4d38f11fb5ea37fe0b727aaa	I think that is extremely cheap.|`|sGP6s7uraa	Sounds really good!

cuIX13BKaa	Your friend or contact is alerting you to the fact that you have been noticed and that he person in question does perhaps fancy you. Immature here to me indicates shyness...and there is a LOT to be said for that.....often shyness can keep us all from making a move or connection that we so desire...it sounds very positive to me. Sounds like, or as though you have made an impression on someone! This sounds as though since you have made an impression it is indeed a great start don't you think? I do!<br>  <br>  Garbo
AA11032586	First of  all, you cannot change him in any way. Also the Bible says to not unequally be yoked. You would be better off finding someone else. If you really love this guy, continually pray that God will change him or bring someone in your life that has the same beliefs as you. I would recommend not getting too involved in the child's life. She was a consequence of their decision. Getting too close will not only cloud your judgment, but it really hurts the child as well. We are dealing with that ourselves with our 21 YO Daughter that is divorced, and changing men pretty often. She is old enough to make those decisions, but my 2 year old Grandson is the one that suffers after getting used to these guys for several months then just getting out of his life. As far as complexion issues go, as long as he treats you right and truly loves you, skin color should not be a problem. I hope this helps. God Bless. Good luck.|`|U8v8RXvQaa	I read that question,<br>  and i think if you love him you should say yes.<br>  i mean,<br>  his beliefs can change.<br>  or who knows,<br>  maybe he can change his way without chaniging his beliefs.<br>  he obviously love syou enough to stop while around you.<br>  maybe marriage isn;t the right thing at this time,<br>  but tell him how you feel,<br>  don't think he HAS to love god,<br>  you can.<br>  in fact, you should.<br>  you should always love god, whatever you believe in.<br>  but he believes in whathe believes in, and you can't change that.
1os95dHZaa	Depends on what brand you want.|`|ITOBWVakaa	You should order from middle eastern countries. Those guys have harems, so obviously polygamy is A-ok. That means they'll be more likely to have 2-for-1 specials!|`|Amkmles0aa	usps
X9XYf7Jxaa	well to be honest, she doesn't like you. she may like you as a friend but not in the way you hoped for. how old are you? if you're like grade 8 or less, then that's just how girls are at that age, they're very shallow and look for any guy that has the looks.<br>  <br>  yes you mention she smiles a lot, but she's just one of those nice girls. that's the harsh reality.<br>  <br>  bottom line, this doesnt really have to do with ur situation but: if a girl looks at a guy sometimes and the guy catches her glimpse at him, THAT DOES NOT MEAN ANYTHING. (unless that happens a few times)|`|hlvdPjeFaa	Girls are hard creatures to understand. One moment they seem like they like you, the next they're playing hot 'n cold. The best thing to do is to ask her what's up with the behaviour. Tell her how you feel about her ignoring you. You get a direct answer and the problem is solved. If she says smth you didn't expect/wish to hear, it doesn't matter. You'll get over it. Girls like that aren't worth our time.|`|T4AWDxA8aa	well bud i am going to tell you the truth she  probably   has either heard something bad about you or she has gained status meaning that you are now below her in the hierarchy  i would suggest that you find someone less shallow   hope you find someone worth your time and heart good luck|`|SSukoZ1Caa	honestly bro, she was either fuckin with yea or she is just a big flirt and moved on. don't worry about it and just drop her. shes not worth your time|`|L2RzKcpcaa	I have done that before, what happened with me is i kinda liked this guy but once i started talking to him regularly he was becoming more of a friend then someone datable so i backed off to avoid him thinking i was really into the idea of a relationship and this way i wouldn't have to turn him down technically, though through all this i still kinda liked him. that might be what she is doing...
NvW6voPJaa	Hi.  It's fine to wear black to EITHER a religious ceremony or, as in your case, a non-religious one.  I (and and number of others) wore black to my own sister's wedding and it was held in a church (Catholic.)<br>  <br>  Black is simple and elegant.  It's not reserved for funerals anymore!|`|2eoAqicdaa	Better check with the bride just incase...<br>  she may not wanna have people wearing black at her wedding its up to her but if your sisters are saying that then maybe its best to leave the black until another time x|`|F8iYNurEaa	Ignore Strawberry_"whine"cooler. It is absolutely fine to wear black to a wedding. I have been to many weddings where guests or bridesmaids have worn black and virtually no one batted an eyelid. I am getting married next year and I don't care what colour people wear. I certainly wouldn't be upset if someone turned up in a black outfit. It can look chic. <br>  <br>  If you feel worried then speak to the bride about it. If she is fine, then it doesn't matter what other people think.|`|e8de2966baaeb88154b07130842a8179aa	It's ok to wear black, of course.  The rules aren't the same as they used to be, heck I wore a black bridesmaid dress once and that was fine.  Some older people may object but it is pretty common today.  My future stepmother in law asked me if she could wear black and I don't care.|`|Jnv47zQgaa	I think you should wear it, but just cheak with the bride if she minds you wear black first. its her day who cares what anyone else thinks. OHH and btw it sounds realy pretty. i would wear it|`|8840f90d1236990da5c34043fc11245faa	Yes I think black looks classy and as long as you feel comfortable thats all that matters.<br>  Have a good time.|`|jsIjyDEPaa	You should never wear black to a wedding. This is the most important day of your cousin's life. You will be in her wedding photo albums for years to come and when she shows them to her grandchildren she will have to explain to them that you were inconsiderate enough to think that just because the wedding wasn't in a church you didn't have to follow wedding etiquette. People will tell you the notion is outdated just because some brides choose black for their bridesmaids but the fact of the matter is that black is associated with bad luck and death and anything you do to take away from the brides special day will be reciprocated at your own wedding some day.|`|ee0d5392d404921277604008a24d4060aa	Go for it.  As long as you are dressing in an appropriate style, you can wear any color that isn't white (or ivory, or maybe even beige, that's a little too close to white).<br>  <br>  I wore a gorgeous black dress to a wedding and no one said anything.  Plus, you are balancing it out with color.  That makes it all right.|`|WCKeOsFkaa	Black is fine, providing it's in good taste.  The red shoes need to go, you'll look more like a call girl then a guest.  If you want a splash of color, perhaps a red wrap with red jewelery, to accessorize.  Your right it's not a funeral, but it's not a night club either.  Remain respectful.  Brightest Blessings|`|WKgvwCNZaa	Yes, it sounds very pretty. But yes, you should check with the bride and groom! As long as they approve, your good to go!<br>  <br>  <br>  Have fun!|`|4yFDVPhQaa	its sounds like a really cute outfit. i would.
tbrvyLb0aa	Ok, the week on/ week off thing may work for summer, but in regular life is difficult, especially once the child starts school. For a lot of families I know, every other weekend works well. (Try to avoid her being taken every single weekend, that leaves no real fun time for you!) If the dad wants her more than that, then I think he should move closer so he could have a night during the week and still take her to school. Before school starts, he could take her for a night during the week, right? And for the present time, I think it would be fine if the baby was away from you for a day, but a whole weekend is too much. (I'd say overnight is pushing it.) Do you have a breast pump? That's crucial. <br>  <br>  Good luck and just try to be patient and see what works for all three of you!|`|onbwN4csaa	He is her FATHER. for gosh sakes. He loves her to.<br>  Why do you think that you have any more rights than him.  Your really going to dictate his time with HIS daughter. shame on you.<br>  <br>  You sound like your going to be one of those CONTROLLING ex- wives.<br>  <br>  That alone will make your divorce much harder<br>  than it will have to be.<br>  <br>  When a guy knows they are being controlled<br>  they will dig there heals in the ground and can make things difficult.<br>  <br>  I HATE MY EX-WIFE FOR DOING THAT.|`|ZgBdeZnvaa	Depending on how much you trust him I would definitely get a court arranged custody agreement. Which is usually every other weekend rotating holidays and sometimes one day a week for a couple of hours. In the summer the time is split for school children I dont know about babys. Every county has different friend of the court guidelines. And if you don't live more than a Hundred miles apart he has to pick up the baby. Emotions run high after youve just had a baby.Also theres joint custody which can be every other week if you want. I think that the every other weekend is good the baby is little.  congrats on the new baby hope it works out for you|`|srAP6Vzvaa	Weekends i think is fair. 2 days a week is the least father of the child should have.   I always find it interesting how a woman before being pregnant always tells the man how "I want to have YOUR baby." But then when she gives birth to the child it slowly turns to this is MY baby and you can rot in hell.|`|ftSsVFQNaa	Well I have no magic answer for you. It is always hard when parents aren't together on the a child. It is very important that a child is in one home most of the time because, they need a since of belonging somewhere. If a child is shuffled from home to home to much the baby will have a lack of connection and belonging. Honestly the best thing for your child would be for the two of you to live under the same roof. The baby needs a two parent home. Good luck.<br>  <br>  Love,<br>  Michelle
8Trv4fqnaa	Ok, holy crap this is like 10X harder to read cuz its 4:00 am here LOL. <br>  <br>  I think you should talk to him and tell him to take it easy, and that you are watching him so he better not try anything stupid. Also maybe talk to your cousin about it too so she will be care full as well and not get sucked into pressure. <br>  <br>  Sorry if this is not what you wanted to hear... im pretty much brain dead right now.|`|r2j2PgIBaa	I'm sorry, but with something that serious you NEED to tell a trusted adult.  She doesn't have to know that you told on her, but that is something to to be playing with.|`|qSFtNZ1jaa	I think you should just talk to the person directly about this issue before it gets worse. Theres no other way to really do it and revenge isn't exactly tasteful as much as it is fun.|`|zZYShwgqaa	i would normally say embarrass him somehow but you can't really make that effective unless you tell him the reason why and make sure that your cousin was ready to face some crap that she will most likely get from him or his friends. and seeing as she is shy she most likely wouldn't be able to handle that sort of situation. so i think you really need to chat with your cuz and make her to understand that she doesn't have to let someone walk all over her like he does. tell her and make her realise that there really are guys out there that won't force themselves onto a girl like he his. hope this helps somehow
2U0BtIZ8aa	idk. but good luck.|`|bC5XeVEIaa	Just how many people in this world do you think have those names? If you cycled through a picture a second trying to find the guy, even assuming that he exists, you won't find him in your life time.<br>  <br>  Of course you don't want the truth. All you really want is to follow your delusion. Logic escapes you because emotion gets in the way.
4720e061dbc6fdbef8f758c349c36002aa	Probably because it makes him feel good to know you are not over him, and it's a boost to his ego. Either that, or he feels bad about the breakup but doesn't know how to tell you. <br>  <br>  Either way, it sucks for you and you should tell him it's driving you mad and he should stop calling you.<br>  <br>  Or, just sleep with him again and get it over with.|`|DZ23afDLaa	I see that in some of the answers there are a lot of romantics in the house you guys/gals need to get over it.  this is a plain case of I don't want you and I don't want anyone else to have you and it is working because when he calls you get all screwed up. As mentioned in another answer this is a booty call if he gets the feeling that you are available than he will come at you full steam. answer this question since the breakup have you slept together if the anwer is yes you will never get rid of him.|`|H3WfJY5Eaa	Block his calls sweetie...<br>  <br>  :/ His a manwhore, and he wants to put you in the "pocket". <br>  <br>  He wants to make you a backup...<br>  <br>  Don't fall for it!<br>  <br>  *** Do you really want to start dating a guy, that soon after your break up, went and had sex with 2 other girls? Maybe even tried to pursue a relationship with both (or had one)?<br>  <br>  Even if it was mutual I'd be pretty heartbroken from the break-up...<br>  <br>  ****'em sweetie.

That sort of thing reflects how the relationship is, to me at least. <br>  <br>  If the guy is bitter and constantly complaining about his job, I find he is not happy at home either and treats his wife the same.<br>  <br>  If the guy is happy with his job and feels secure, he feels the same at home.<br>  <br>  The same way I look for a guy to date that treats his mother well, without being a mamma's boy, I look for a guy that has good work ethics.<br>  <br>  Mind you.. I dated one guy that loved his job because he could do basically whatever he wanted, he delivered pizza's, and he felt the same about the relationship too, so he cheated on me and took drugs (neither of which I knew about for a long time). <br>  <br>  So.. Yeah, job = reflects on the person you are as much as your friends reflect on your personality.|`|f8ON3dRfaa	1) It's definitely about the money.

Good for you."<br>  <br>  3) Security. A steady stream of income helps alot in the household.

I'm sure they both love you, they tried to make things normal for you although they weren't, so you have that going for you.  But you need to find somebody to talk with to help you through your grief, because that's what it is, so that you will become a well adjusted adult.  That is the best way not to make the same mistake as your parents did, but there are so many reasons why people grow apart you can't put them all into one little spot and say I've got the answer.  If you would like some on line help email me and I'll get back to you and try to help as best as I can.  It will at least be a first step in working through your problems.  One last question, you did know something was wrong with your parents relationship for a while, didn't you, or were they able to hide it that good?  The trouble with hiding something like that is that the affection is out of the marriage, the love and tender parts, the parts that we learn from, how to treat someone and how to be treated.  We do what we see, why good role models are good for us.|`|pOCabUMvaa	I am so sorry you are going through this, you have your own life, the decisions you make in the future are yours, and only yours, it has nothing to do with the fact that your parents got a divorce when you were younger, just like me, my parents got divorced, and then as I got older, I got married, in my late 20's but I got married.<br>  <br>  I realized that their life was their own, and my life and my decisions I made throughout my life was my own, what I wanted was a marriage not like my parents, and to be a parent to my child like my parents never were to me, (they were terrible).<br>  <br>  Your life is your own, I suggest you talk to your mom, and tell her how you really feel, make her sit down, and tell her your feelings, she has to listen to you, make her listen to you, do not have her shut you out, and say that to her if you have to, get your feelings out, make her listen to you!!! She has to, in order for her to understand you and you to understand her, you have to talk.<br>  <br>  And them getting a divorce, believe it or not does not mean they do not love you anymore, they just don't love each-other.<br>  <br>  Believe me when I say this.<br>  <br>  Take it from someone who has been there and done that.<br>  <br>  Now, I have been married for 17 years and have an 11 year old daughter. Proof that I am my own person, and I have learned from my experiences growing up.

You sent him a note to let him know the reasons for you adding him as friend and he accepted it for the reasons you stated.

4qL7oRrVaa	Your obvious aversion to your wife's suggestions probably made her uneasy about going to this other church in the first place, and then now that your interested she doesn't want you to ruin it for her.<br>  <br>  Stop asking where she went, if you two are happy and believe you are both within the same religious, moral and value frame of mine, then you should continue to be a supportive and respectful hubby.<br>  <br>  She will tell you when she's comfortable, but I don't believe she's comfortable. Who cares if your sister in law is around, you should put some trust into your wife and open your mind to what she see's in going to this other church. Perhaps if you go as a family as you've said you'd be OK to doing, regardless of having the sister in law there, when you get home you can have a discussion with your family on how you feel it went, what things you liked and disliked and weigh the options. <br>  <br>  Maybe there are better things there, maybe not, but if you don't see for yourself, you'll never know!|`|IvMPh09baa	wow... geez... to think people have real problems out there, like gee i don't know maybe a spouse at war in iraq, maybe a spouse with a terminal illness, maybe a spouse that is disabled.... and to think, your problem is where your wife goes to church.  what has the world come to when your wife no longer tells you which church she went to.  <br>  thats it... im convinced... the world is now going to end because of this problem.|`|x8dDKH3Maa	this is only my opinion: I would have no problem telling my husband what church I went to however I don't see what the big deal is...except that the fact that she won't tell you is making it a bigger deal than it should be. Stop asking her for awhile, maybe she'll spill it one day when the pressure is off.

c27920620869d3d5b40c4f7c78b6b42aaa	As long as you are really organized an Oct wedding would work just fine. My husband and I got engaged in July and married at the end of October. It was a beautiful wedding. <br>  <br>  The important thing is to make out a list of everything you want and delegate things out. <br>  <br>  I looked for a dress, venue, and such while my mother searched for invitation and my husband for cakes (He did a really good job on finding affordable cake places.) <br>  <br>  You might have to change your budget a little to get the wedding together in that amount of time, because financially it might be too soon if your parents are helping out with the wedding. Ways to cut cost are to look at less expensive venues, have it be a light lunch, or cake only, don't have a dance floor. <br>  <br>  If you choose to do the fall wedding, buy little pumpkins and hollow them out, then put a tealight in them. They look so cute!|`|Xzvoz6mcaa	October is totally doable.  It's 8 months away, and I planned my wedding in 7 months!  It was easy!!!  And the good thing about getting married in October is that when you go on your honeymoon, it will still be somewhat warm (depending on where you go) and it will be off season so the prices of everything will be cheaper!  I don't think anyone should tell you to wait if you think you can do it.  <br>  Anyway, as far as cutting costs, what really helped us, was that everything was done by friends.  The cake, photography, decorating, flowers, etc, were all done by friends, so we didn't have to pay expensive vendor fees.  There were costs, but it was definitely less.  Plus, we had an outdoor wedding, so we didn't have to pay for a venue.  We also didn't have a band, I had a friend play the piano, and other friends sing, and that was all the music I had.  Also, if you don't plan on having expensive jewelry and shoes, I bought my jewelry and tiara off of ebay, and my shoes at payless for $12.  <br>  I hope I helped!!|`|k07IyDvwaa	if you love the fall then you should totally get your wedding in october!<br>  after all its your wedding not somebody else's, and you have to make the decision for your own<br>  <br>  and congrats on your engagement, and hope u have a happy life with your future husband!|`|aipChC3haa	I'd go with October 2010 because the longer you have to plan usually the better the wedding is better, and you can really have a GREAT time planning.<br>  If you do it this year you'd only have 8 months to plan, would be too hard.<br>  <br>  Congratulations =)|`|LAyigK5Aaa	My sister got married in in march and it was sunny and the temperature was great! if you really want to get married in May then do it1 Don't get married in October because it's not good for you.|`|pub2GLZPaa	I planned mine in 3 months. October is plenty of time, providing you have somewhat of a vision for what you want.|`|JgT3k7Ocaa	i say if you want to get married in october you should get married in october - you have time to plan a wedding - just stay focused and on a schedule and you'll do fine.  besides autumn is my favorite time of the year.|`|qRIMM2ycaa	October this year is still doable, you just have to get started real quick.<br>   The main problem with trying to book a wedding on short notice (which yours really isn't) is that during peak wedding season, (again which October isn't) the best or most ideal places are booked way in advance.<br>  <br>  It may be a bit trickier if you want to have your ceremony in a church, because some are anal about booking far in advance, but it really just comes down to being flexable.<br>  <br>  Basically what I'm saying is, October should be plenty of time, but you won't really know until you start looking for places to get married.

He hasn't come out and told me that he looks at porn and such things, but I know he does.... He's a man... They sometimes do that. No I don't or wouldn't get jealous, I think I can be just as hot as some of the girls in the pictures or movies, which ever he is watching or looking at. I might be married, but that doesn't automatically turn me into a hag....LOL...  I get way too many compliments to worry about my husband daydreaming about another girl...LOL... I know that's blunt of me to say, but I would also let you know if I did look like a hag.... But considering that all of my 18 year old sons friends constantly telling him how hot I am and when they first meet me, they think Im his sister...So, I must be doing something right...LOL...

You had some very strong feelings for that guy but you got hurt.  In that hurt came some self doubt about yourself and you threw yourself at every guy trying to make yourself feel better.  I bet you felt worse after each one.  The problem you were going through after the break up is your head was spinning, your emotions out of control.  It is the very one reason why a person should take a breather before moving onto another relationship, to be able to approach it with an open and clear mind, not carrying any extra old baggage from the last relationship.  Those guys did happen for a reason, to let you see how little sex has to do with a relationship, it's the very thing to ruin a good relationship, and that it should never be entered into lightly.  With your breather and having rekindled your spirit you will be making a healthier choice the next time and making the choice for the right reason.  good luck

6b8cbbdcbfb34ad6e49d598a03f113a0aa	Sexual abuse involves forcing, tricking, threatening or pressuring a child into sexual awareness or activity. It can be physical, verbal or emotional, and occurs when an older or more knowledgeable child or adult uses a child for sexual pleasure.<br>  <br>  The use of physical force, known as sexual assualt is rarely necessary to engage a child in sexual activity because children are trusting and dependent. Children are taught not to question authority and they believe that adults are always right. Perpetrators of child sexual abuse know this, and take advantage of these vulnerabilities in children. Sexual abuse is an abuse of power over a child and a violation of a child's right to normal, healthy, trusting relationships.<br>  <br>  Incest and sexual abuse are at epidemic proportions. Statistics state 15 percent of sexual assault and rape cases occur in children under the age of 12, with 93 percent of juvenile sexual assault perpetuated by someone they know. Of those assaults, 34.2 percent of attackers were family members, 58.7 percent were acquaintances and only 7 percent were complete strangers.<br>  <br>  Symptoms - Because most children cannot or do not tell about being sexually abused, Physical evidence of abuse is rare. Therefore, we must look for behavioral signs. <br>  . Depression<br>  . Eating Disorders<br>  . Sleep disturbances<br>  . School problems<br>  . Withdrawal from family, friends, or usual activities<br>  . Excessive bathing or poor hygiene<br>  . Anxiety<br>  . Running away<br>  . Low self-esteem<br>  . Self-destructive behavior<br>  . Hostility or aggression<br>  . Drug or alcohol problems<br>  . Sexual activity or pregnancy at an early age; promiscuity<br>  . Suicide attempts<br>  <br>  Additional Symptoms (Children and teens who have been sexually abused frequently) have more specific symptoms:<br>  <br>  . Copying adult sexual behavior<br>  . Sexual play with other children, themselves, toys or pets<br>  . Displaying sexual knowledge, through language or behavior, beyond what is normal for their age<br>  . Unexplained pain, swelling, bleeding or irritation of the mouth, genital or anal area<br>  . Urinary infections <br>  . Sexually transmitted diseases<br>  . Hints, indirect comments or statements about the abuse<br>  <br>  and  Self-hatred, alcoholism, drug addiction, depression, eating disorders, the inability to trust and suicide are common results of incest and sexual abuse.<br>  <br>  Advice ur friend to get some counselling.<br>  <br>  Please do not become a party to any such act/activity.<br>  <br>  If need be you may have to alienate yourself from this person least you may become an accessory.<br>  Good Luck>r|`|RYLkjYkIaa	i thnk he is abused in his brain, be careful girl awkward  things start like that

Things may change, and you just have to take it slowly. Sometimes, you won't know if it's the right person, so you just have to get to know them, and don't asume that it's love at first sight. And if you do fall head over heels in love, if that person isn't crazy about you, then you can't persist, because, if they don't exept you now, then nothing you change will have them execpt you.

Do you think love is all fluffy kittens and red, red roses?    I've got some good news and some bad news for you.<br>  <br>  Bad news first.  Love hurts.   It always has.  it always will.  Love gone wrong is some of the most painful emotions you will ever experience.<br>  <br>  So, does that mean you should avoid it?   Nope.   And this is where the good news comes in.  When love hurts you the most, THAT is when you know that you weren't faking it.  You were really in love with...whoever.   When you breakup with someone and you feel a sigh of relief.... that's not love you were feeling for them.   When you breakup with someone and you feel like your soul is bleeding .... THAT was love.   <br>  Yes, it hurts.  But rejoice.  Know that you are capable of feeling that "in love" feeling.   Not everyone gets to experience it.  And those that DO get to experience it, don't always learn the right lessons from it.<br>  What's the right lesson?   When the love fails, you learn what NOT to do in the next relationship.    Yes, the next one might fail too.  But you will learn ANOTHER lesson about what not to do.   Eventually, you will "get it", and the relationship after that will be the one you were looking for all along.<br>  <br>  So,  how do you fall in love again with the right person?   <br>  <br>  *smiles*   You fall in love with the right person when you stop picking the wrong people to call the "right" person.

szVvf7Nkaa	I really don't want to offend you but if you don't know what to wear or need to do to have sex with this guy then you are not ready for this. And if this is something that your boyfriend wants then don't do it. You are still young and you would be foolish to have sex now. You don't even know if this relationship is going to last. What happens to you if your boyfriend decides after he had sex with you that he no longer wants to be with you? I think you need to really think about this. Would you not prefer to wait until you were much older? Or wait until you got married. The most beautiful gift you can give your husband is your virginity. Sex is not something that you have to give to someone because you think it’s the best thing to do for your boyfriend. And if your boyfriend leaves you because you don’t want to have sex with him then he was not a boyfriend to begin with because all that he is looking for is to have sex with someone. Please think twice about this because you could be making the worst mistake of your life.|`|bvwYVGJOaa	Don't know if you're a young girl saying this so hear me out. If you and your b/f like each other a lot, you care for one another and respected always. Make sure you use a condom both of you, rather having people saying "You're to blame for this and that!" Because it's your first time, talk with a doctor he/she will give you free contraceptive protection including pills and condoms. You won't be sorry if you don't want unplanned pregnancy or risking both yourself STI/STD. so please be careful<br>  <br>  Secondly, find yourself a nice lingerie but keep it simple and be yourself and relax, it's a special feeling too. Get chocolates too if you want and dim the lights..|`|nwNkXEO3aa	Most importantly, wear what he likes you to wear. I do hope that he has told you in the past about what he likes you to wear. Or maybe he has given a different positive look at you when you dress a certain way. It'll make both of you feel great.<br>  <br>  As for what to do,do let it naturally. I believe you have heard some stuffs about sex. For example, the different styles, the building up to have sex etc. Just let nature takes its course.

What to wear:<br>  <br>  These are some practical options:<br>  <br>  1. Condom <br>  failure rate:<br>  * to avoid pregnancy : 26% on women during fertile period (about 4 days in a month)<br>  * to avoid HIV : no publication. FYI: HIV size is about 20% of normal sperm, and you can get infected even not on your fertile period.<br>  <br>  2. Birth control pills<br>  failure rate:<br>  * to avoid pregnancy : 98% if used as instructed (beware of side effects)<br>  * to avoid HIV or STD (Sex Transmitted Diseases) : 0%<br>  <br>  3. Morning after pills:<br>  failure rate:<br>  * to avoid pregnancy : 0%, they are aborting the pregnancy, not preventing<br>  * to avoid HIV or STD (Sex Transmitted Diseases) : 0%<br>  <br>  These are some not so practical options:<br>  <br>  1. Vaginal sheath / Female condom:<br>  failure rate: a bit worse than male condom, must be inserted by skilled person. I don't think a virgin can do it.<br>  <br>  2. Spermicide:<br>  as an additional to condoms, to decrease the failure rate (to avoid pregnancy) up to 15%. Not protecting you against HIV / STD.<br>  <br>  3. IUD:<br>  must be installed by doctors/paramedics. you will lose your virginity when you do. Side effects including vaginal bleeding, cramps, anemia. Not protecting you against HIV / STD.<br>  <br>  B. What to do:<br>  <br>  1. Ask your boyfriend to take health test to know whether he has HIV / STD; wait for the result. Make your final decision after knowing all the risks of having sex with him (including pregnancy).<br>  <br>  2. Ask him to promise to give you the same pleasure he will get from you. If he get orgasm, he has to make you feel it too. It is a fair deal. Only trully loving men willing to do (or a professional).<br>  <br>  3. Personally i suggest it is better for you to wait until he is your husband. People say "easy come, easy go", the easier he gets you, the easier he dumps you; it doesn't matter how much you love him, but how much he love you.<br>  <br>  Hope this will help<br>  GBU|`|oyljTnxPaa	Go slow<br>  wear something not to skanky but not like granny panties<br>  put some nice candles around make it nice make your first time memorable|`|IH0kLuwZaa	it's not about what you are wearing just make sure you are very relaxed and if you are really ready your body'll tell you what to do just go with the flow
OKIw5kcLaa	well thats a hard one but to me going to europe is to much because you have to think about how it will go wrong once you are there. and how will you be able to go back if you run out of money? i think they should not jude your friends because we have been told by jesus that we should not jude others unless hey have proof if they really are a bad influence.<br>  <br>  the only thing i can say once your 18 you can do what you want its by law and you can get a job and raise money for your trip but you have to make plans if there should something go wrong.

nBQeSu2faa	You need to tell your " friends " that you are not interested in anything your ex does and you would appreciate if they didn't tell you anything about him...because he hurt you so much , and now you just want to get on with your own life...they will understand I'm sure. If your " friends " don't understand how you must be feeling...then they are not true friends.  You must realise , you are better off without this ex in your life...it seems he is a very weak person also if he really loved you ...nothing would stop him from being with you. When you meet other men , don't be in a hurry to get to seriously involved with them...take your time . There are lots of men out there who can make up their own minds about the woman they want in their lives.  Sadly your ex was not one of them.|`|NQFV2AdZaa	I'm sorry to read of what happened to you, it must have been heartbreaking for you. Your ex couldn't have loved you that much if he allowed his family to dictate who he could and couldn't marry. You deserve much better than him and tell yourself that it was his loss not yours. I bet he'll regret losing you one day and you'll find a much better man and forget your ex. Your so-called friends are inconsiderate to want to get a reaction out of you, knowing how much you loved him. Just let them know that he's not your concern anymore so you prefer not to be told anymore news about him. If they are decent people, they'll understand that. Maybe you could organise an evening out with a close friend to help take your mind off your ex, he's not worth it believe me. I hope that one day you meet a man that truly deserves you, good luck!

AA11136246	You remind me of myself when I was married then...sometimes men become insecure when they see their partner is more successful, they become lazy rather than stand up and fight.  You should do something about it before your love turn into hatred.  You should do something that will make him realize that you are not happy with your situation.  Before its too late.  With me then, i moved out with my two kids and never went back, now i thought to myself that i should have left him when i had only one child, i never should have waited for him to change.  I waited until he learned to physically abuse me...so you should love yourself and be wise.|`|HKQqJeVBaa	Well, its a difficult situation, but i think you need to sit down with him and tell him exactly how you feel.

I'd put quite a lot of emphasis on her sitting on that guy's lap though, your best guy friend doesn't deserve that. I'm not sure if you should tell him about her and that guy though, because if it ends between them over that and then you tell him that you have a huge crush on him he might think that it wasn't true, or that you did it so that you could be with him instead, or something. <br>  <br>  I'd tell him how you feel about him if I were you, but not about Caitlin and that guy...

oGoWz511aa	I have a feeling some of that allergic reaction is psychological.  If you were truly allergic, you would have broken out in hives long before you found out he was smoking again.  Hive-like rashes are often caused by anxiety, and that may be the reaction you have because you strongly dislike cigarette smoke/smoking.  Your boyfriend has probably been sneaking smokes long before he got up the nerve, desire, or need to keep a carton handy, and long before you caught him.  <br>  <br>  He probably really liked you when you first met.  Back then, he was willing to make the effort to win you over.  Now that he's comfortable, he's going back to his old self.  Maybe he'll quit again, just to keep you quiet.  Maybe he'll quit again, and do it for good.  The man is addicted to nicotine, so you can never really be sure what he'll do at any given point in his life.  <br>  <br>  If it's going to bother you so much that you know you'll never be able to stand living with it, you should probably find yourself a REAL non-smoker.|`|4qL7oRrVaa	Catch him. <br>  <br>  Sounds like he's got something to be defensive about, who knows what it is, but people don't normally get angry like that if they are innocent (unless you've asked him every day for two months and he's strickly annoyed, from your question though, I doubt that.)<br>  <br>  Get home early when you know normally he wouldn't be expecting you.<br>  <br>  Take out the carton and put it on the kitchen table, he's your husband, and you live in the same house, he shouldn't be able to hide things so easily for so long from you.<br>  <br>  You might be frightened of the confrontation, however, it is for your health and the health of your relationship that this subject becomes something you can discuss.<br>  <br>  Tell him all the things you love and care about him for, and that you will not leave him because of this (well, I wouldn't, I would support him in either trying to quit again or to keep his habit outside the home). Sometimes when people make mistakes, they fear the absolute worst, so reassure him that won't happen.<br>  <br>  Hopefully he will open up and tell you why he started again, and perhaps you can both move on with whatever plan you make between you to correct the issue (even if it means comprimise).|`|AA11587827	then u should have found someone else if u knew he smoked, instead of trying to change him|`|qXBSNIjcaa	(",) be assertive and confront him/her in a diplomatic way that doesnt invite an arguement|`|HvaRGRNUaa	look at him in the eyes and say to him, "do you see my body?! you're doing this to me! if you love me, you would care that you've done this too me." seriously, your health comes first, and he should man up and admit his wrong behavior.|`|IA5uBGFkaa	Not to be mean but when you met him you knew he smoked and you were allergic to it.

If he can't stop smoking ask him to please do it outside. This is not an unreasonable request.|`|9lBe1JGAaa	Well in my opinion. If he doesnt love you enough to kick the habbit even though he knows how much it physically hurts you, then he doesnt deserve you. <br>  <br>  Throw away the stupid cigarettes, or give him the choice between you and lung cancer.|`|i6zSUjVoaa	That sounds like a very tough situation.<br>  I would calmly ask him if you could set aside a time when you two could talk one on one. Maybe over dinner, etc. First ask him if you could just explain what you have noticed and how you feel, without any interruptions. Stay calm and don't become angry and start to point fingers, but explain to him how it is very important to your health and your relationship that he be completely honest. Explain that you did not mean to snoop, but noticed the cigarettes and that it worries you. Be clear that you aren't accusing him, but simply curious to why they are there, and hoping to find an answer. After all, your health is important. Look him in the eyes, don't be angry and be open to what  he has to say too. <br>  I hope this situation becomes easier for you, and good luck!
jeHTjvbaaa	Get rid of him, sorry but it's the truth.  If he won't listen and is trying to force you into his faith than think what his parents are like.  I have had way too many conflicts with relationships with different faiths, one, the person thinks there is something wrong with you because you don't believe in their deity, two, if their parents are hardcore, they will make your relationship a living hell.  If he won't respect your beliefs then he isn't worth it.  Good Luck|`|NmfEaN3Uaa	An age old problem... I hate it when a person tries to force their beliefs on me. You just have to talk to him...don't try to convince him to see your way or anything but just tell him this is how you are and you can't pretend to believe something you just don't. Its one of those things you have to just be serious about. Explain how you feel when he forces it on you and ask him to stop.<br>  <br>  I'm Agnostic so I know where your coming from.|`|ZcUZySAbaa	Tell him that the world's religions, including Christianity, are nothing more than rewritten versions of an older story held dear by the earliest sages and priest of mankind that can be found on this planet; namely, the story of the birth, death, and rebirth of the Sun as it makes it circuit through the sky and the Zodiac once a year. Ask him to investigate this. Start with zeitgeistmovie.com if he's too lazy to read. If he's too rooted, leave him, he's a goner. Good luck.|`|srAP6Vzvaa	there is not gentle way about it. just sit him down and tell him EXPLICITLY what is up. he's a big boy he can take a NO on religion. but if u ask me in the long run this relationship will not last.|`|B0y9aO1Laa	Tell him if he really loves and cares about you then he should respect your beliefs no matter what.|`|5emkoFawaa	Tell HIM you don’t believe that people are bad enough to be separated from God because God says bad things are EVIL.<br>  <br>  Tell HIM you don’t believe in LOVE that gives everything to others WITHOUT demanding a Little in return.<br>  <br>  Tell HIM you don’t want to learn why people sit in church and learn nothing.  They sing words and do not understand what the words mean, or, or, or repeat the same words several times, YET their Savior told them not to repeat their words, WHO told them to just be sure to repeat your prayers for asking for change.<br>  <br>  Who needs a SAVIOR?  Lies are not sins, are they?  Beating up someone with one’s fists?       SIN?<br>  <br>  Not working so other people can give me money and housing with blankets, that’s not a SIN, is it?<br>  <br>  Screwing up my education, so I can have more babies and work at MikkiDees or elsewhere for minimum wage?<br>  <br>  Grabbing a joint or drink and then driving erratically, really a SIN?  Lack of Accountability, a SIN?<br>  <br>  SEX is for ENJOYMENT – nobody is selfish, nobody has hurt FEELINGS and nobody gets DISEASES for sex that is EVIL!      = = =  SIN?   = = =  What for?<br>  <br>  Just because I don’t hear about the MILLIONS and BILLIONS that “religious” people spend on RELIEF for the WORLD’s poor, because I was asleep in church and don’t contribute but a BUCK to the offering plate, can that be a SIN?<br>  <br>  WHO WANTS to hear about an Almighty Being who brings JUDGEMENT on the EARTH for the EVIL that MEN and WOMEN contribute in HATEFUL DEEDS that the ALMIGHTY states are EVIL?<br>  <br>  NEVER give a thought to REPENT for my deeds, I never hurt anyone, or myself, THAT the EARTH needs floods and fires and storms and ICE and wars and hunger and disease that wipe out the innocent children.<br>  <br>  Who needs understanding for how this LIFE is supposed to FUNCTION?   I have my Wii and X-Box in competition with the EVIL guy next door!<br>  <br>  You would have THOUGHT that GOD would have revealed HIMSELF to someone!

He is not following you around,  he is not flashing you, he has not made obscene gestures towards you nor came to your house look at as a compliment for now.  if he does any of the above mentioned than tell the police and your brother and hope for the best good luck.|`|GB8tHYxRaa	I'm with Maria S.  Probably need to call the cops. Telling his friend probably wasn't the route to take at least it clearly didn't help.  Maybe the police can talk to him.  Even if they don't talk to him you can at least have it documented that you reported to them.|`|ise05jjUaa	There's nothing you can really do other then tell your brother & hope that he gets scared of him.  Other than that he isn't doing anything illegal, he's just looking at you constantly but it doesn't sound as though he's following your anything like that.  That would be stalking.  You know how many female movie stars would claim stalking just from all the men who look at them constantly.

If he senses you are bored, perhaps he needs to spice things up a bit so you won't be bored!|`|HUUZgDppaa	maybe its just some look you have on your face i dont know it seems like your doing fine just ask the guy what he means like ask him how do i look bored|`|w4XbSuB5aa	U get top for once and go fast and moan he may buy it and think ur enjoying it or u really r enjoying and moaning forreal whichever one idk.|`|S7RN9mKUaa	I definantly think if you were doing what you were doing he wouldn't think that.

aWEybdDFaa	He is being nice because he is an old friend of the family. You shoul NEVER date your brother's friend(s) because whenever it doesn't workout than your brother would be in the middle. You don't need conflicks, plus this guy--has a girlfriend. <br>  <br>  Maybe you should just ask him, what he thinks about u. But you should never like someone that's taken because KARMA isn't a good feeling.

x3g9IlhVaa	Maybe you could say to them that you love what they gave you but you dont want to wreck any of it just wearing it everyday.  If they say thats what it was meant for spill glue or something on a top when they are around.<br>  <br>  Either that or just say that you love the gifts but you feel embarrased because you know how much thought they put into it and expense and you dont feel that you can equal that..makes you feel like a bad friend.  Perhaps you could say you would rather they spent their money in going out for dinner or lunch rather than buying you an expensive gift.  If you all agree to celebrate that way then its easier than hurting anyone's feelings.|`|vgsK2fr5aa	i dont get y u dont wear the tshirts you wouldnt be a poser and it is probly hurting your frieds and just say i would rather have jewelery or gift vouchers or something lyk that becuase you hav 2 many clothes or something lyk dat|`|f5WU05Fraa	You should really tell them what you want instead of accepting gifts that you don't like. You should say to them what you would really like , even if it is something little. Just don't come off as ungrateful.|`|yVIb7zjiaa	Well next time you are with your friends and your talking about gift giving just mention "hey I would love gift cards over an actual present" and maybe they will get the hint..|`|4ef505315e6714cd6a174d1beb0546f0aa	I'm sure continually accepting gifts you secretly never liked would hurt their feelings more than just telling them straight up.<br>  <br>  Just tell them. You're just over-dramaticizing the situation in your head. They won't get all offended or anything and refuse to buy you another present as long as you live. If anything, they'll appreciate the feedback and try finding something you'll like better next time.<br>  <br>  Don't freak out about it, just let them know how you feel. They'll be a little uneasy, but that's because they will feel like they made a mistake, and the feeling will last only seconds. They'll get over it. It's all good. Being open and honest with your friends is great!|`|oDkL7fRNaa	if it was me, i would tell them stuff that you do like in  away so when they do decide to by something, it would be something you do like. but, i would try to tell who ever is buying you stuff that you don't want or need. little hints here or there that you don't really like some of thing they got you, that way it doesn't come out all at once and they wouldn't get mad.|`|uly3aFqtaa	Sometimes I dislike gifts that my friends give me, but I have learnt to suck it up and enjoy the presents.<br>  <br>  I think that you are the one with the problem - you don't like wearing the big-band merch cause it makes YOU feel like a poser. Maybe you're just being paranoid. How are your friends supposed to know that you feel like a poser?<br>  <br>  I like Amanda Palmer, too :)

CJpDgs6Xaa	I don't have a problem with arranged marriages as long as both parties consent.

LOL  I have never seen or known anybody who fell in love after they were married.  A couple has to have chemistry and an emotional connection to make it.  If you have those, than yes, marry and build on that if that is what you choose.  Otherwise, if you don't have those to elements, the marriage won't work out.  Never settle.....NEVER!   <br>  Good Luck|`|kV9GlWDFaa	Me and my husband knew each other for like 3 months only one of which we had actually spent time together. i know what your thinking and no i didn't met him online. lol. actually he is marine. but the point is that we got married and our thing is we have the rest of our lives to get to know each other. i admit things are not over the top o my gawd but what marriage is...I believe that if you come into contact with the person your destined to be with. you will know this someone is special. maybe i'm wrong but taking that intutive side into effect and the outcome can be a spontanous adventure my good friends!!!|`|bmwTSnBfaa	In the years before the 1950's, thats what often happened & to be honest, it seemed to work better!|`|yVIb7zjiaa	whats the rush on getting married?

afkygHMgaa	People generally say they are "nice" and "forgiving". The fact is though, people ususally don't do anything without a payoff. Clearly you wanted a payoff of him texting you back and were not simply showing kindness. There is nothing wrong with it, however you should not have expected him to do what would be considered kindly reciprocal. He ALREADY used you and then dumped you fully knowing his feelings for his ex. He ALREADY ignored you for a month. He ALREADY texted you like a coward instead of talking to you face to face or by phone. <br>  <br>  Put his idiot in your past. He will probably text again when he is bored or things are not going well with his ex or some new person he is stringing along. If you respond then, you are being a fool. You know the old saying "Fool me once shame on you, fool me twice shame on me"? It applies here in a big way.|`|l195kTc6aa	he will respond, they always do.|`|2iWr2fkLaa	you did the right thing. it one thing to forgive and another not to forget. so chill on having taken a smart approach|`|AA10494978	Well... why are you worried about how he is perceiving you if you are being nice to him?  Don't make it a competition, its not a race.  You said so yourself, he is embarrased, he wants to keep his distance, just say hi and move on.  <br>  <br>  Sorry, don't mean to beat up on you, but don't think of it as a race as far as who can ignore the other person first.  Its silly.  You are not in high school, are you?  Then move on.  Don't worry about it.  Besides, if you are not interested in him anymore (which I don't believe) why do you care if he is ignoring you?  <br>  <br>  Hey, its ok to say, "the bastard called his ex's name out - I am so pissed, I never want to see him again" - you have some anger about it, as you should.  If you hide behind this phoney "I'm so nice, nothing can bother me" routine, you will explode from all the insecurities and anger.  Hey, my advice, be pissed off.  You have the right to be.  So get angry, get it out of your system (or go through the stages, whatever you want to call it) and move onto someone else.  Good luck!!|`|831e735ba92bb0dfd3b16be0d4995ccfaa	Forget him, he's got some inhibitions that need a consular to straighten out, get on with your life.

LMAO!<br>  <br>  Men can do it too, of course.<br>  <br>  You need to learn that very often people's affections wax and wane.

vY0ScgeXaa	it really depents, sigh.<br>  <br>  it's always a shame for parents to leave such predicament to their children. and as a child, you can never predict the next to happen.<br>  <br>  leaving them alone or intervene don't matter, they could still get back together or get a divorce, i mean think about this, your 15 some, their grown ups, who know better? would your opinion even be considered in the first place?<br>  <br>  but just for the sake of it, i encourgage you to give it a shot, to intervene, tell 'em how much you love them, and how hurt you are becoz of the fighting. and how much you wish them to get along with each other, cuz for christs sake, they get married in the first place didn't they? they must love each other to do so.|`|JPTP71IWaa	If I were you I would go in the middle of them when they're fighting starts to escalate and say loud and clear that you can't take it anymore, look them both in the eye and tell them to grow up. Then I would walk out of the house, and go to a friends or something.<br>  <br>  How this would help:<br>  Your parents hearing their child tell them to grow up would open their eyes to their child like behavior. You leaving the house would give them the only option to talk to each other and focus on their behavior and influence on their child.<br>  <br>  When you come back home ( give them a few hours) they'll probably want to talk to you about what you said and apologize for putting you through it, as they are talking to you tell them that you know they are going to fight, but they need to make sure YOU are out of the house, and away from the argument AND UPSTAIRS DOESN'T COUNT!<br>  <br>  Tell them that you have to leave or they have to leave, but they can't keep arguing right in-front of you because every time they do that, they are taking a piece of your innocent childhood and forcing you to face adult problems, and grow up.That's just wrong.<br>  <br>  I hope everything works out.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|MlCWsBcwaa	I think only if intervening will stop someone getting physically hurt or a younger sibling is very upset by it.  They are both adults and need to sort this out for themselves.  You might not really know or understand why they are fighting (might be more to it that you can tell).    If you want to say something, maybe do it when everyone is calm and tell them that you are worried about them both and love them.  It is their business at the end of the day, and if it the arguing is upsetting you and you can't go out, maybe you can listen to music to drown it out, or talk to another family member that is wise and will not interfere incorrectly (they can be someone for you to talk to and know what the best thing to do might be).  Good luck, hope things improve.|`|yQ1UfuZWaa	interact deffinitly. tell them to stop. idk but u can't wait for them to stop you have to make them realize they're being stupid for fighting over stupid things.|`|kRJ7Liu4aa	You should confront both of them rationally|`|x4RnrSOMaa	Tell them to stop!<br>  If their age difference is like a couple of years it's just probably becuase the are going in different stages and some things they may not agree on... But the throwing thing need to STOP because someone could get hurt if they have problems with eachother they need to see a therapist.|`|dgqRfcYMaa	U should confer them and try to speak with them that the fighting is making u sick .and they should decide what to do|`|vh1c0Sstaa	i know how u feel and i would just say to stop|`|VP7KAe12aa	I would just walk out of the house leaving them a note saying: "Gone for a LONG walk. Won't be home until you BOTH stop yelling and throwing things at one another. Bye ________<-----your name"<br>  <br>  I wouldn't like it at all. Maybe what you should do is also go and talk to them about this. It's not at all healthy for you to be in things kind of atmosphere. It's not healthy mentally or physically. <br>  Tell them that you are getting pissed off on how they are treating each other towards the littlest arguments and that they need to grow up and understand throwing things is not going to solve anything. If they want to through things they can do that outside but not around you.<br>  <br>  I went throw something similar to this and I'm only 15 (turning 16 in a few months) so I know a little bit more then I should.<br>  Goodluck with everything:)<br>  Rebekka
y4zYkceEaa	I wouldn't be weirded out by it at all. I've heard worst. ;))|`|JEdP02Oeaa	thats a little strange...<br>  but if it really made him happy, sure i'd go for it. <br>  its not totally weird. just make sure its not like a huge obsession, cause those get creepy.|`|af160a8fd6d84d201b88d510eaeb3ae3aa	I would put on high heels and burst me some balloons lol. Heck yeah I would do it for him.|`|znvx2NMQaa	if i could treat her boobs like balloons and pop them then yes.|`|SR1FN2nqaa	lol......first time ive heard of this one, but yeah if i really loved him id do it for him.
3TobPBDOaa	I'm the same. 18 years old and attracted to guys over the age of 35.<br>   <br>  Plus I never lived with my father, hardly ever saw him. <br>  It seems that this question gets posted a lot, and it's normally by girls who don't have fathers in their lives. Which is somewhat troubling. <br>  <br>  I'm hoping it has something to do with my mental attitude as well. I tend to find guy around our age immature and boring. They tend to have nothing interesting to tell me or teach me, or much depth. <br>  <br>  As for the "sex stuff." It's very much possible. I know that a lot of guys who reach their 30's become very insecure about their age, thinking they're now old. When they see a young girl who is interested in them, it can probably be a real ego boost. I lot of men (apparently) have fantasies on the subject and would boast about it to their friends if given the chance. After all sex is just sex to some guys (and girls), whether you are 18 or 50. <br>  <br>  But, i don't think this is true for all men. I think, if you have the right personality then you could genuinely get along with someone older. People say there is too much of an age gap, generations and such, but i think it depends on the context. I think it is possible, if talking about the right subjects, to find you have a lot in common. If given enough time i think a relationship could develop and so could some very strong feelings. Whether or not the two of you feel you would want something out of that on the other hand, is again, dependent on the individuals and their situation. <br>  <br>  But that's just my opinion, through experience.|`|PHhKrdqsaa	are you married? you are normal and its possible to get attracetd to old men...what you need to know is if whether you get along well with them...|`|1Z0Lmrk1aa	Hi Purple, not having your father around is definitely a reason why you like older men Plus women generally like more mature men and us older guys feel that need. Don't worry honey your not abnormal, and some older men will just be after sex so you have to be cautious. I am 51, and my father abandonned me and I love to date younger women so go figure. If you would like to chat email me at jerry_wesst@yahoo.com.|`|zUdxoRbyaa	really? you are attracted to older men? um, how much older?lol. to be serious love can strike any time any age.
Tu7UOK3Waa	I didn't know most guys are like that<br>  <br>  im not its kind of the other way around for me :/ so i understand what you mean, its irritating when the person you love or even like doesn't like to talk to you<br>  <br>  i think you have to find out how to make him open about talking bc guys open up about things without noticing it|`|wI5SU7ykaa	I find it the opposite in a guy I like- we communicate a lot when we are together- but when were apart he has lack of e-mailing me but I figure since were both in college it doesn't matter because I do that to my friends. - As for your situation I think some guys just aren't the talkative type - They don't delve into conversation much unless its a game- music-sports-beer-or a killer movie- but then again I don't hang out with guys that much.

8103f5a386f35ec2420460c4f3b3dcabaa	The ending of a marriage is an extremely important and difficult process to begin, but living one day at a time, support love with family and friends..one can walk through this process.<br>  I divorced my abuser..too many legal and criminal justice system issues at the same time. But today I am glad that I did.|`|AA11447210	A big decision, but not a difficult one. The marriage was an "oops" in the first place, I was unhappy, I tried to talk to him about it and work things out but for him everything was fine. When I decided to leave and told him so, he told me I was phuquing up the best living arrangement he'd ever had...<br>  <br>  ...that comment validated my decision and I never looked back or wondered if I'd done the right thing.|`|RP6Xmvxsaa	IT S A VERY BIG DECISION THINK IT OVER AND OVER AGAIN|`|7f1gz6JTaa	Its a big decision.I think about it everyday.

You broke up for a reason and you can't force her to have the same feelings you do.<br>  <br>  As far as your friends go, take the high road at all time. Don't discuss her if possible and be civil to her in person even if she is dating another guy and brings him around the group.

Try and get to know him better ask him/and his friends if he wants to play with you and your friends with the ball games. This will give you and him a chance to be nearer each other and get a chance to talk and know each other.

lBSYvBGwaa	Well, it really depends what kind of things you guys are into. Look for an activity that you both enjoy. A cruise would probably be a good idea. My girlfriend and I have been dating for 3 years, and we loved it! It's pretty affordable... only about 400 dollars a ticket, and even for as little as 4 days to Mexico. It isn't the best sightseeing place to go for a cruise, but being in the middle of an ocean is just as exhilarating as new sex ideas. The mood is right for it too. On top of that, the cruise ship offers a buffet, fine dining, pools, miniature golf, piano lounge, comedy shows, etc. There's always something to do. It was a great experience for use, it might work for you guys too. =)<br>  <br>  Here's a link to the cruise we took:<br>  <a href="http://www.carnival.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.carnival.com</a><br>  <br>  Seems like they have some good deals going on right now too!

szVvf7Nkaa	I think the biggest problem here could be that you are so stressed out about being pregnant that it's delaying your period. If you took a pregnancy test and it turned out negative then you have nothing to worry about. The only thing I can advise you to do is go see your doctor. There could be something else going on with you that you are not aware off. So in the meantime try to relax because you are going to make yourself sick over this. Good luck.|`|0OsZubWsaa	I would go to a doctor or a local health department to get a test done.
svrrbZU0aa	Your no player you keep her around for when you can't get any. You will spend you life chasing this girl. You won't amount to much.
BdlGBdE5aa	If you are in the same room with smokers it is the same as if you smoked.  So put your foot down and tell those stupid nuts that they must smoke somewhere else.  Any amount of smoke is bad for your health so get things fixed now, not later when you are carrying around an oxygen tank.  Or, even worse, dying from lung cancer.  You can choose to get this fixed or you will be fixed.

syLCg7f3aa	The chances are slim. Its normal to be late...especially if she is stressed out. But, whatever the case may be, worrying won't change the circumstance. So, give it time...another week or so. If she still hasnt gotten it, she should see her gyno. Good luck ..and p.s if she isnt on birth control already...tell her to GET ON IT! If you don't want a baby right now, don't count on condoms alone.|`|DJXW96d0aa	On any given month, unprotected sex will result in a pregnancy about 18% of the time.<br>  <br>  A ton of factors can affect a woman's cycle.  Is she usually extremely timely, as in, she can predict when it's coming within a 2 day window?  If not (which is the case with many women), 4 days isn't a huge deal.  If you're *sure* the condom was on properly, on the entire time, removed promptly, and didn't break, then you have a good chance that she's not pregnant.  Make sure that's the case next time, and it won't be so stressful for you two afterward!|`|uAZlvHgiaa	I really doubt it. A lot of women do not have perfectly regular periods.

GaHkxtU9aa	There is nothing wrong with living at home if you get along with both your parents and you have your own space.<br>  <br>  But unfortunately as we get older we tend to need more of our own space and need to expres ourselves more openly. You get to the stage where your opinons and feelings will be different to everybody espcially ur parents.<br>  <br>  When it gets to that point - where your not getting along on anything and your feeling cramped and caged - then its time to move on with your life. Its nature's way of saying its time to move on and assert your independence. <br>  <br>  Your parents will understand. They had to do the same thing once themselves. Go and see any friends who have moved out of home or are struggling to pay the rent - and ask them if they need a room mate. Give it a 6 month trial and see how you go.<br>  <br>  Dont create bad blood before you go. Sit down and discuss it with ur parents. Leave on a good note and a positive feeling thats its the best idea for everyone. Otherwise its harder for you to come back and feel good about it if things dont work out. Which sometimes they dont.|`|PkDokr8Iaa	I think you've answered your own question.|`|j3YRIJafaa	if you feel ready to leave then leave but remember there is nothing wrong with you still living in your parents house. to me you sound ready to leave and get your own place - but before you make anything defiant like buy an place talk to your parents first they will want a say - hope this helps good luck|`|z4jvx4Hgaa	If you really think that you can support yourself then move out because I think that you are old enough to choose your friends. a curfew at 20 is silly!
FX7lI4h5aa	Well do you still have strong feelings for your ex-girlfriend?? If so its only going to hurt your present relationship, and that's not good. So you need to figure out who you want to be with. You need to ask yourself "who am I happier with?", "who treats me the way I need to be treated?", "who actually cares for me and doesn't want to change me?" What im getting from your question is that your ex-girl might be playing games, because she broke up with you and got mad at you for not taking her back, that means she wanted you to chase her, which my opinion is silly. Why can"t people be honest about how they feel about each other? That is so much easier. Also, she never showed her emotions towards you when you guys were together but now that you guys are broken up shes calling daily telling you she misses you and wants you? That's pathetic. Obviously you moved on and seem happier, so my advice would be to stick with your new girl and get over your ex. <br>  <br>  P.S. you shouldn't let your ex keep calling you, unless you want a HUGE argument with your new chick.|`|YCrVZ5Rmaa	In my opinion, your ex should just get over it. The only reason that she is now calling up saying these things is shes jealous of your new girlfriend. You've moved on, and that is that.|`|hFnUAImYaa	hi gentleman,<br>  i think u have a great problem .<br>  my opinion is to have both girls as ur friends with their permission.<br>  if u broke up totally with ur ex -girl,she will unnecessarily worry abt it or she just try to cut the relation between u and ur new - girl.<br>  so it is better to have both.<br>  if u are in a case of having only one just go with a new - one bcoz she give u new thoughts . if u have ex - girl she just always suspect u.<br>  based on ur wish , u decide.all the best.thank u.hope i helped.|`|P0nkf64Taa	Don't get back together with your ex girlfriend, if she actually had feelings for you, she wouldn't want until you had a girlfriend three months later. She would of told you sooner. <br>  <br>  But it all depends who you have more feelings for.. your current girlfriend, or your ex. Feelings can be confused with past memories you had with your ex, you may miss being with her because the times you shared. Thats normal, but it doesn't mean you still have feelings for her.
CQPvngCeaa	You should try to wait till the end of this year before you decide to do anything. Maybe you should indirectly try to determine how she feels about you before you ask her out. And you have to show her that her opinion about boys are wrong, and that you are - um - worthy of her or something? Anyway, if you really want to be with her, just meet her up somewhere not too private, but not too public (like in school, so embarrassing) either, than casually but seriously tell her how you feel. Like the advice given earlier you must be confident, because that is one of the factors that win a girl's heart.<br>  <br>  Yeah that's about it. So simple! Just need some courage or motivaion. Good luck...|`|Ejw9Yf0jaa	shes probably attracted to badass type guys, and if ur like one (well probably not) go with it. approcah her, dont be boring, dont be too serious. keep her laughing, let her have fun.... and DONT show interest yet.

AA11678263	Hiya Maz,<br>  <br>  I am a Childline counsellor.  What happens is largely up to you.  When you call, you will get through to the switchboard, and they will ask if you want to speak to a counsellor.  They are there to stop calls from people with wrong numbers etc, so just say yes please, and they will put you through.  You will then get a counsellor who will tell you you're through to someone you can talk to.  Tell them what you need to, and they will listen and ask questions and help you to talk about things.  If there is a child protection issue, e.g. you are in danger, they may ask you if it's okay fro them to speak to their supervisor for advice.  The supervisor will help to make suggestions that the counsellor can tell you about.  If you are in IMMEDIATE danger, e.g. someone is in your house and about to kill you, or they think your life is threatened today, they may prompt you to contact the necessary services, or breach confirdentiality (e.g. trace your call), but they will tell you this before they do so.  This is only in very extreme cases.<br>  <br>  For the most part, if you are experiencing abuse in any form etc, or are severely unhappy etc they may help you to think over your options.  If you want to be put in touch with social services, they may be able to support you by staying on the line while you talk to them (3way call), or may give you the number so you can call later if you prefer.  You are always welcome to phone back, and Childline is open 24/7.  It is free to call from landlines, and I read on the web that it is also free from mobiles, and is open to anyone up to the age of 18.<br>  <br>  It may be worth trying Childline even if you're unsure they can help/you will be comfortable, as you can always hang up if you don't like it.<br>  <br>  I hope you find the support you're looking for. xXx|`|70TOo3vtaa	It is free. It won't come up on your phone bill either so it is v private. <br>  <br>  They listen and try to help you with your situation. But if your life is in danger because of abuse, you should call 999, even if it is your parent/guardian...<br>  <br>  Hope this helps
93m7LZCeaa	i would have started dating again after she explained herself<br>  however two years is too long for experimenting.<br>  i think it might be for real but than again you cant be suure<br>  good luck|`|aOx0U3wKaa	i dont think an experiment would last two years, she would have made up her mind already... and yea because she may have been unsure of her feelings at first|`|DjJwKc9Caa	that's so hot.
HzTFK1RNaa	I am 38 next month, my wife is 26. We have been together for just about 8 years. We have one of the best relationships I have ever had. Like any relationship, we have gotten angry or irritated with each other or had to apologize for something, but in 8 years we have not had one argument. I have never been happier with anyone else. Not saying it's best for everyone, but it makes us happy.<br>  <br>   Her sister was pretty against it though, and she still to this day doesn't treat me the greatest, but I have learned to just let the "little things" like that go. Her sister doesn't have near the relationship we do, they fight like cats and dogs(or should I say argue). <br>  <br>   Ultimately, we have to spend a lot of time "alone" with whoever we chose to be with, I say screw everyone else, and be with someone who makes YOU happy.|`|nJszzqRCaa	i think its ok if it isnt like marriage material its fine dont worry|`|3a516c8104546ce0a46e6f3599b7369aaa	Yes is too much and its not fair for the 21 ......|`|TbrVtUQOaa	age is just a number!!!!!|`|X7i59NeIaa	I am 11 years older than my husband and we have been happily together for 29 years.

Simple.|`|VsBFVS2naa	This is such an impossible complicated question. <br>  <br>  The perfect hug depends on the gender, age, culture, relationship, and current situation of the people involved. <br>  <br>  If you aren't getting positive feedback from the people you are hugging, then maybe you need to ask about a more specific situation so that we can help. <br>  <br>  Or maybe you're just asking a random question, and my sleep deprivation in making this more complicated than it needs to be... I think I'll go to sleep now.|`|sYSEYHAzaa	Well i only know how to hug girls... So when u go in for the hug make shure ur standing up strait... make sure ur arms go on top of hers and wrap them around her shoulders. pull her in and have her head press against ur chest.. if ur a guy with a hard chest its the perfect hug... if the girl u are hugging is intimate (girlfriend, close friend) with u place one of ur hands on her back and the other on the back of her head, then lower ur head so it rubs gently against hers and cradle her.<br>  Theirs the Anatomy of the Perfect Hug!<br>  Hope It Helps Bud|`|AY0LM4RAaa	There's different hugs for different situations.  But I like the handclasp-hug combo.  Bring your right hands into a handclasp, (not a handshake, cross thumbs and put four fingers curled over thumb side to back of hand).  Then come together and pat the back a couple times with the left hand.<br>  <br>  The handclasp puts a barrier so you're not too close.  This is not an intimate hug.|`|5HOyupgfaa	if your hugging a girl, wrap your arms around her waist like you never wanna let go, girls love that, trust me <br>  if your hugging a guy, put your arms around his neck or you could put your arms under his and then put your arms up and hold onto his shoulders, sorry if that doesnt make any sense.|`|21DRVtlIaa	for a guy, arms around the waist.<br>  for girl, arms around the neck.<br>  just dont touch her ***, for a guy, hands on the lower back. and u'll be fine|`|Ex2LDawXaa	well the last time i hugged someone i accidently touched there but and they never let it down hahaha!!! so i dont really give hugs to my guy friends anymore|`|1168l7WOaa	Wrap Your Arms Around They're Waist Or Torso, Which Ever's More Comfy  And Give Them A Little Squeeze.<br>  <br>  Hope This Helps.<br>  :)|`|fcNY5vLiaa	well when you are giving them the hug you grab their ASH|`|IsCiYVaXaa	lm0910's "perfect hug" seems to me like the RACIST HUG.

DqmMW2tcaa	technically yes. The age of consent in Australia is 16, so I woudn't tell her parents. They could tell the police  if they didn't like you or thought you had taken advantage of their daugher.|`|91a2b9fe0d0ef5781c3a0beca8dcdd82aa	she would be 14? 15? so im thinking YEAH! you would get into trouble. and her parents can at least tell the police what you did. but because of your age, they would go easy on you. but not too easy. so next time, think with your big head instead of your small head.
HH90Eghaaa	This is a tough one! He's going to feel rejected, if you'd like you can tell him the reason why you aren't wanting it so much, or you can lie! Tell him you had a pregnancy scare and are a little hesitant to have sex right now! I know its wrong but sometimes its better then having to deal with their ego!|`|bwKZ8MWWaa	tell him you'll share him with other women|`|0ZVAZ1R7aa	well is it "anymore" or just "not as much" you sound like you just are not certain of yourself....so that means he isnt making you feel important and possibly used?  you need to just tell him what you want really and if he doesnt like it then you know its not good...but if he is more understanding and kinda lets you approach then you know hes a good guy...maybe you are making him feel like you like it as much ??? be honest with him and you will know what to do!!!|`|QQhKa4fdaa	Just say you have AIDS|`|9s5duQmFaa	Sit him down..and tell him|`|Q2sy3BGOaa	why not?|`|Be6oUPd5aa	Just tell him you have different needs or wants.

Don't try. Taking clothes off her when she's sleeping is cheating, you need consent, and you didn't have it. <br>  <br>  She's 23. You're 13. Find someone your own age. It isn't that hard. <br>  <br>  In case that isn't enough, would you go out with a 13 year old if you were 23? The truthful answer. <br>  <br>  Wasn't being called a pervert and being told to get away enough?<br>  <br>  :/|`|QPVEL0NLaa	why don't you go back to your room and play with yourself while looking at the Victoria Secret catalog.

Besides i doubt a 23 year old would want to be in a relationsip with a 13 year old that's just wrong. move on kid i'm pretty sure there are other 13 yr olds in your school that might be interested in you|`|SvMKiVMkaa	LALALALA|`|BXLCiCUlaa	Hahaha, great story. Thats a pretty interesting present for your birthday: birth control, lol. "If your parents had some, you wouldnt be born, lololol."<br>  Anyways, i would say let your hormones cool off before you do something stupid and are perhaps a father at 14.|`|lvVHpPyvaa	first of all your toooo young and it sounds like you have some issues already. The right girl will come along.|`|q9rrZjDeaa	U got no chance u screwed up and she aint going to date a 13year old
nYzcP5V9aa	Well your first kiss won't be a big make out session but it's the best kiss ever [:<br>  You should just be yourself as corny as that sounds it's always best<br>  And make a lot of eye contact with the person to let them know your interested<br>  If you have anymore questions you can email me or IM me<br>  I'm 15<br>  So I kinda know what you're going through|`|jUXzm8u9aa	Your 14, your still growing. I'm 18 and I never kissed a girl, or have a girlfriend. I'm straight, just in case, lol. Your still growing. Maybe you should take some time, and try not to worry about appearance much. It's the inside that counts. You shold wait and get the right guy for you, someone that will like you who you are, not what you look like. The right guy will come, try to get your mind off of it like hang out with your friends more, and focus on school right now. Remember, get the right guy, and if this guy keep nudging you to do something, he probably isn't right. Especially at this age.|`|W6o3UQLkaa	flirt with some guys, talk to them.<br>  take it slow, dont worry about your first kiss, its usually just a peck|`|5HOyupgfaa	just talk to them and be yourself. hair flips always work =]<br>  and i would deff work on your flirting skills

I don't see what your problem is!|`|OOL4XdjPaa	if you're not ready then why are you asking why you haven't yet? you answered your own question.|`|6bMqZ6kcaa	Im 18 and still a virgin too my problem is Im too small and he's super big, and it hurts so bad, and just because your not ready now doesn't mean you never will be, just give it sometime, it'll come for you, good things come to those who wait. don't rush it because if you do you might regret it or it might not be so great the first time and you'll hate it.|`|JGpirCtLaa	It's totally fine. I'm 19, my boyfriend is 20. We have been dating for 2 years and haven't had sex. He is a virgin, I unfortunately lost my virginity way too young at 15, but still, we waiting until we were dating for about a year and a half...but I am waiting until marriage now. <br>  <br>  Don't ever rush that. And don't ever feel pressured. I would be so proud to be able to call myself a virgin. Don't do something you will regret, be proud of being a virgin. Guys will respect you a lot more and you will be a lot more likely to be able to get boyfriends later on if you haven't had sex.<br>  <br>  I personally think you should be dating a guy for at LEAST a year before having sex, I actually think it's pretty slutty to do so before then, it just makes you seem really easy. You need to gain respect, love, and all that fun stuff before having sex. It takes time.<br>  <br>  =) Good Luck|`|AA12135516	Don't worry about being 18 & not wanting sex because everybody is different & when you're ready you will know.|`|zUdxoRbyaa	you answered your own question. you are not ready yet.|`|01f0dac47a423ecab2421c4e39d16905aa	You aren't ready girl.  Just be yourself.  Don't be a 40 year old virgin though.  Go to a doctor and make sure you are OK.  Just saying because there might be a reason why you don't have a drive.  You haven't even lived yet.  Take your time.  If you are waiting for that perfect time something in your past might plague you so go check that out.  But don't rush.  Just be yourself.

I wouldn't have let you go. I would have thrown you out.
QKM3NLmaaa	yes. you are out of the loop. scene = emo.
nUqGDTvxaa	def boobs
8a8CZqGLaa	I would have the masks as favors on the reception tables so people can put them on before dancing, but not during the ceremony. Make sure you send out Phantom of the Opera invites so everyone might take the hint. I think the bride should also make sure she has a stand out mask and her husband should wear the phantom mask.|`|yhfG07Jtaa	My idea is don't do it. I wouldn't go to a wedding that they told me to wear white, red or black, and I would leave if they told me to put on a mask.|`|JtEBaOdjaa	If you want every guest to wear a mask I'd provide them.  Otherwise more than 1/2 of them will show up maskless.  If that doesn't matter then don't worry. Otherwise, have a girls day where you make masks for the wedding guests. (which it sounds like you are doing).<br>  I had planned to do this.  but I wanted the theme to be more specific to the Masquerade Ball scene.  Of course, no one will show up in a renaissance dress so we put the kaibash on that. lol<br>  Remember, even if you ask people to wear only red, black or white you can't force them to and many will show up in other colours.|`|AA11082914	Her flowers- red roses tied with black ribbon. Maybe incorporate that red rose/black ribbon on the invites. Set up the reception site to look like an opera house. Sorry but that's about all I got...lol. I like the idea though...I'm a huuuuuuge phantom fan.

NHE3Jb8daa	Don't even question it. <br>  <br>  She IS a mother to you. <br>  Don't question it. <br>  <br>  Keep in touch with her! <br>  It may even help your dad and her be on <br>  good terms in the long run. <br>  <br>  If your dad has a problem with it, <br>  Tell him just because his relationship with <br>  her has ended, doesn't mean your relationship<br>  with her has to. <br>  <br>  & If it comes down to it, tell him exactly what you've<br>  said above.. <br>  "she knows more about me and is more involved in my life than he is, and I feel like no longer talking to her would be like no longer talking to a parent."<br>  <br>  Because that is your truth! <br>  <br>  Speak it. <br>  <br>  It may be what he needs  to hear. <br>  <br>  Just because she is not your blood mother, <br>  Doesn't mean YOU have to let her go too. <br>  <br>  <br>  You might just have to ease it in, yknow? <br>  Like just going to see her once your dads settled,<br>  and seeing her more regularly after that. <br>  <br>  The worst thing you can do to him is see her <br>  behind his back though. <br>  So don't do that.<br>  <br>  HIS problems are his and his only. <br>  YOU don't have to become bitter =) <br>  <br>  Goodluck.|`|ise05jjUaa	Of course its fine, she's divorcing your father, not you.  What ever problems they had is between them, it has nothing to do with you & I'm sure you're stepmother would be happy to still maintain contact with you.  As far as your dad, if he's a mature, grown-up he'd tell  you the same thing I just did, he shouldn't have no problem with it.  She was basically your mother, your father can't expect to bring some lady into your life for that lengthy amount of time & expect you to completely forget about her, he'd be crazy to think so.|`|Shp5riE6aa	Of course it's ok.  She has been a part of your life for years, and she is still family to you.|`|1hciyvKdaa	She is one of your moms, it would be very nice to let her know you still love her, she took the time to win your heart and do a good job parenting you, let her know that. No matter what dad or anyone else feels, a divorce only ends a marriage, not feelings. You dont need to discuss seeing this person who now is not in his life. If he gets upset, remind him, that he had found a wonderful mom for you, and although they are now apart, that love will never go away and he should not want it to.|`|a05818703edf627a70c2368c5b12f69daa	just because her and your dad are splitting up, doesn't mean that u have to end your relationship.|`|K2QwEM4raa	Yes it is fine just because they are divorcing it has nothing to do with you children, love her as always.  Just don't run between the two telling them what the other one does. It is nice to hear of a young person such as you that has a mind of their own. In my opinion she will always be your step mom. Why should that change?  I am friends with all more former family members and even took my ex husband into my home with my current husband  helped me take care of him till he passed away and I am still close to my grandsons mom and my ex mother in law,etc.  And even the ones that I am not close to I still treat them the same.  I guess I just like real people. Can't stand trouble makers and people who judge others. Lucky you!|`|KOXcw4klaa	go see her when ever you want.but be careful that she doesn't try to use you to see what your father is doing,up to.if she does ask questions about your dad then tell her hes fine and leave it as that.good luck.|`|wzqahEqiaa	One of my relatives has been divorced and remarried multiple times.  Every time she gets divorced she expects everyone in the family to ignore her ex husband.  Members of my family were friends with one of her ex husbands before they were married.  My family continues to remain civil and friendly to all her ex husbands.  Relationships (like dating and marriage) are personal and it isn't fair to expect everyone around to stop contact just because of a divorce.<br>  <br>  I'm 25 years old and my parents have been faithfully married for almost 35 years.  It's always bothered me when people bring a person into the family, a bond is formed, there is a break up, and everyone is supposed to act like a relationship never existed.<br>  <br>  There is nothing wrong with loving someone that isn't biologically related.  I can never get pregnant because of medical reasons.  I hope to adopt children in the future.  If I do adopt children I will love them the same as I would biological children.<br>  <br>  I put a link below to a video about Mother Theresa of Calcutta.  Mother Theresa was a spiritual mother to all people.|`|SCg3kDz2aa	You MUST see her. This is not a question, this is an obligation. She supported you from your age 5, it would be an ingratitude to turn your back on her now.  Your father should say the same what I am writing now.|`|pYtXrnDfaa	You should absolutely stay in touch and close to her.  I would imagine she thinks of you as her own.  I'm sure she would be devastated if you didn't maintain your relationship with her.   I'm sure your dad would want t his too.|`|4bedkpvLaa	ya its fine and perhaps have lots of dates together to get to know each other better.|`|B5WbBKDOaa	sure flush dad down the crapper, maybe mom will put out|`|AA11969451	I think it would be fine. You and you step mom are not the ones getting a divorce.|`|1ac39fcfa274ce08e7a2111bc679183aaa	Yes, Yes, Yes, please do keep in touch with her. <br>  There are few step parents like this. <br>  <br>  She has touched you in a special way. It is not your fathers choice, he should be happy that he a woman in his life that really cared for his children.|`|AA11315360	There is nothing wrong with being in contact still with your ex step mom. If you feel like she was a mother to you and want that to continue then stay in contact. Visit her on holidays and whenever you and she wants to hang out. You were so young that she pretty much is your mother so you should stay in contact. She is still like your family. It's like having an adoptive mother.|`|cu8fUJbMaa	Yes, yes, yes it's not only ok but would be horrible for both of you if you chose NOT to remain in contact. This is a woman who has been part of your life and family for the last 14 years. She has grown to love you as you have grown to love her. The problems she and your dad are experiencing have nothing to do with you. <br>  <br>  As for how dad will feel about it.......well, I can't imagine a dad would expect or want his daughter to alienate someone who is a confidante, friend, adviser and mother figure. He may be a little uncomfortable with it initially and may not want to hear about it when you see her. I would just sit down with him and explain my feelings for her and that it would be very hurtful to me to have to end an almost life-long relationship with someone I love and feel is a member of my family. The bottom line is that you are a young adult and at 19, you don't require dad's permission to remain in contact. If he has a problem with it and you truly don't want to cause him distress but still want her to be a part of your life, then just don't make a habit of mentioning it to him when you talk to her or see her.  I have an ex-step father to whom my mom was married when I was 6 until I was 15. My own dad was in and out of my life and this man acted as my father. He and my mom had a very bitter divorce, but my siblings and I have always stayed in contact with him and he remains someone I consider a valued friend. It upset my mom, so my siblings and I just don't say anything to her when we get together with him or talk with him.

QQ2u0gi6aa	I think that you should ignore her or do it back and if she keeps doing it then go away from her and tell her what do you wn tfrom me please stop and if she dosnt say to her listen you might be first born and you, might be stronger but you still have feelings and f she still dosnt stop loudly say to her I am a human and I have a right to tell you to stop and then if your mum or dad comes back and shes still doing it that is BUSTED for her!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|b6cuytMyaa	you should get like a voice recorder and record her saying that she wants to kill you and then show your mom or dad. she will definitely get in trouble for that!<br>  lol.|`|8WdIEB9Aaa	Why dont you talk with your mother clearly about this matter and try to be her favourite one by doing things that your mother likes.
AA12059817	No-women can't ever be in the friend zone...because even if a guy won't date them...they will usually have sex with them anyway..even if they don't romantically like them. What I'm saying is women can change their "status" with a guy simply by initiating contact.|`|KTMousAOaa	I think women don't ask that question as much because a lot of them flirt. o_o Girls have their way a lot and often know what to do to get out of those friend zones.
xJS3BdUNaa	This is tough.  My dad smokes too and there is nothing that is going to stop him.  I know how you feel.  Just realize this is her decision and it is not on your shoulders at all.  If you ever figure out a way to get her to stop email me so I can try it on my dad ha ha.<br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|hYRP0x2Eaa	I know how you feel. My step dad smokes a lot and no matter what I have done or said, he will not quit. I have even showed him disgusting pictures of bad lungs and gums, it still does not work. I think it is so nice that you want your mom to quit, but she won't quit unless she wants to. Try and accept her decision. Let her know you love her and want her to quit, but i'm sorry if she doesn't. It'll be alright...hopefully she will see that smoking is hurting her and quit. Good Luck!|`|PJyrWmdfaa	Do an intervention by gathering everyone and making her quit.|`|cOce5YbRaa	I understand you fully because I am also a smoker. My kids want me to stop too and I want to stop but I have smoked for nearly 28 years and it isn't easy to quit. Cigarettes are an addiction just like alcohol and once you are hooked it just isn't that easy to lay the cigarettes down and quit. Plus when you quit you go through withdrawals from not having the nicotine and it isn't fun at all and most people get really moody too. I did go to the Doctor the other day and got a prescription to try to help me quit smoking and it is called Chantix. You have probably seen it advertised on TV. I have tried the gum and it didn't work. I tried the patches but I honestly got more nicotine from the patches than I did from the cigarettes and couldn't sleep at all. I have some friends that is taking the pill Chantix and they have had pretty good luck with it. But I have heard some people say that it made them smoke even more than they did before. I am hoping it will work for me and I can quit not only for my kids and husband but for myself. But your Mom has to want to stop smoking before she can ever do it. So talk to her and see if she might be willing to try this Chantix and hopefully it will work for her too. Good luck to you both. Just remember when I said that when a person quits smoking they usually get really moody and bit**y because I did quit for a short time and I was really bit**y. Be patient with your Mom if she is willing to quit smoking for you and herself.|`|Y4ZjGCr4aa	Try and tell her why she shouldn't smoke. If it doesn't work, try this: <br>  <br>  "Oh mom please stop smoking. Do it for me. I love you so much and I can't bear to see you do this. Just do this for me." <br>  <br>  And it will work better if you put fake tears or really cry while you're telling her. It works every time when I want to convince my mom about something :D|`|JvM44Bx5aa	Tell her how much you love her and ask her to think about the good memories in the old days.  You may convince and ask her to stop smoking as a special gift for you on your or her birthday.  Believe me, it should work!  As I already did it on my Dad's birthday, since then he never smokes again, that's very long time ago.  <br>  <br>  Besides, you may ask her to read my content; Mother is Another Word for Love; <a href="http://associatedcontent.com/article/1420649/mom_is_another_word_for_love.html" rel="nofollow">http://associatedcontent.com/article/142...</a><br>  <br>  Perhaps she may change her mind. Hope this would help.|`|0kseszAKaa	This isnt always the best thing to do but u could always say to her that she has to make a decision. Her family or her smokes ? And if she says that she loves her family more thats when u should help her to find something else to do better than smoking ... good luck :)|`|T63eolm6aa	My dad is 46 and he smoke since he was 11 years old... He had a heart attack 3 years ago (43)... I was a senior in high school and me and my mom were coming home one day and we was gonna stop and get some dinner so i called him to ask what he wanted, he sounded upset and told us just to rush home that he wasn't feeling good... So we did and we brought him to the hospital and come to find out he had a minor heart attack... They had to rush him to a bigger hospital and put stints in and all that mess.... Smoking had caused it.. The way we got him to stop smoking?  His doctor told him if he wanted to see me walk across the stage at graduation which was only in 5 months then he had to stop smoking (thats how bad it was)... So he unhooked the wires and all that and went outside and had one last smoke and he did it cold turkey just like that.... Going on 4 years now he is in better shape then he's ever been in.... The moral of my story, just sit down with her and tell her how you feel and explain to her what could happen to her....  I know my story was long; but hope it helped... Good Luck
dw440Lylaa	That's OK, women have been confusing men for years!<br>  <br>  If he wants to hang out, it means you'll be spending time together, if you take the opportunity to get to know him, and let him get to know you, you'll be able to figure out if the two of you should date.............or not.<br>  <br>  <br>  Got it?<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Luck|`|M0KLWw54aa	what's confusing? he wants to go out wiith you
TiN0pZjOaa	it seems like he really doesn't know what to do. maybe you should let go, and see what happens.|`|Eug52iQDaa	I read it all.  Sweetie, two things stand out.  He asked you to leave him alone and his mother doesn't want you two seeing each other.  <br>  <br>  Find yourself another guy.  There are very nice young men out there, honey.|`|0DdSoi4Maa	Let go, I know it's hard.  I was let go by my one & only love.  He'll either come back & we'll get back together or I'll find someone new.  You seem young, so if you are then yes move on & just do things that make you happy.  Don't revolve your life around someone that is confusing & not letting you in.  If he does want you, make him work for it that way you'll know he really wants to be with you.  Don't look needy, that pushes him away ever more!|`|DCnNSweXaa	I know that you are not very old at the most 16??  Your life is sounding very complicate and you do not need this, if he said leave him alone it is not your place to talk with him he should be calling you and kissing your feet.  You might think that you love him but, you deserve someone who is going to treat you like you are someone and if his mother does not like you and he is living under her roof you better forget it, because Mom has the power there and he will get in trouble and he will be mad at you for it...  Try to enjoy your life instead of worrying about him!!!  You will be with him if it is meant to be.  Slow down enjoy life because before you know it you will be old and married and thinking WHAT HAVE I DONE...Please enjoy life and have fun, I promise you will get over it and if it is meant to be he is the one who told you to leave him alone, so really he owes you an apology and if he is already talking to another, you need to move on and make him find and come to you.  You go girl! You can do it you can live without this guy, go live life and love yourself.|`|j6dNwOPVaa	Hunny, I think it's time to let go.  Please ask yourself one question...is he worth all of that?!?  If you did get back together with him you would have to worry about him cheating again, and that would just tear you apart, you could never trust him, and I know that that "once a cheater, always a cheater" saying is true.<br>  <br>  Second, you would have to deal with his mom, you don't need to be in a relationship where someone doesn't like you...it's just no fair to yourself.<br>  <br>  I do believe you need to move on and find someone with less drama, and you seem young so you have PLENTY enough time!   Good Luck and I hope you make the right decision! ;o)
JYgJD0Rwaa	Honestly, I did not prepare my own divorce documents. This is WAY too important to try to do it yourself, especially if you have questions or concerns about it.<br>  I used a document prep service. They prepared my docs and I took them & filed them at the courthouse.|`|AEN68aJgaa	Go to your local family court.  They should be able to help you fill out the documents and give ou legal advice for FREE.  They cannot advise you what to do...but they can help you fill it out properly and address any questions you have.<br>  <br>  There may also be clinics in which you can attend that will spend that hour or two filling out paperwork.|`|IvMPh09baa	oh dear... no wonder your divorcing... you can't even read.

(no offence), but those kinda girls lack personality so 10 pts to you! go for a girl that you know from school, coz other school girls will just avoid you. and go for a girl with a nice personality.|`|oNHtVHzsaa	um.. sorry to break it to you but u might need some really strong colone. im sure if you have a good attitude and they like ur personality, they will look past ur physical traits. is there any medication you can use to control this? otherwise just be yourself and hope for the best. good luck and say hi to your new girlfriend for me.|`|584RoCdAaa	awww I'm sorry cus yes hygeine does matter...but maybe explain the condition and some girls maybe a little sympathetic and understandable and maybe able to overlook it...Good Luck!|`|WQ3uCllqaa	Hmmm...what is it?

Have you tried taking a vacation from a far place? Just a bit of a time for scenery change. Not a pilgrimage on Bethlehem (too Holy^^) or something but where you can view things differently would do. Being skeptical is normal and i am still at that stage too, but i am learning now to trust because i thought that there is no point in doubting anymore. Every event has its purpose, i may or may not know why they'd hurt me (i don't care for those situations anymore), as long as I did my best to treat them the way I wanted to be treated then thats fine by me^^. I cant please them all. Let them worry about what they did for a change^^
AA12059817	I think most women are afraid..because if they let, or allow themselves to feel that love..they believe they will lose control..(and become dependent on him) Also..some women have never felt that kind of love, and it's scary.|`|nkaY8Fg1aa	maybe she's just scared of the unknown.. i don't think it's you she doesn't like, because if it was, she probably wouldn't be with you right now. girls are scared of relationships too sometimes, and leading them on any further. hell if someone knows, then it's ME lol..i'm scared to even start dating a guy. i always pull away when someone tries to get serious. So just give her the space when she asks for it.
GFWTgQjSaa	Well,<br>  <br>  I know that people will say this to you alot<br>  but seriously hun, just ask her. If she is your mum, which she is.. she will understand exactly what your trying to say or ask, justrememberr she has beenthrough it before when she was younger.. no matter how embarressed you gett. Its only a simple question<br>  so its all good :)<br>  <br>  i never ever spoke to my mum about that sort of 'stuff'<br>  but when the time came, and i actually got my period.. i just told her directly and she almost smiled.<br>  <br>  i'm sure it will be all fine|`|xQGCf8GGaa	you will know when it start|`|ZqXUduJMaa	Just ask her! She will be happy to talk to you about it.<br>  <br>  If you need a "lead in" say that one of your friends started her period, and you are wondering when you might start yours.<br>  <br>  Trust me, you will feel so much better when you talk to her, and it will open the door for you to ask other questions in the future.|`|WI1Mz9YTaa	oh my God, just ask her bluntly: "hey mom, I was wondering when you got your period"<br>  She'd love to talk about it, mom love to talk about this stuff with their daughters :).|`|sXpGfHWWaa	Wow. She is your mom, it is alright, I am asure you.|`|X2FrjG8Laa	dont be shy just ask|`|6ILILOtUaa	12 seems kind of young to get your period but it's a great time to start talking to your mom.  Really, your mom should be the one talking to YOU about this stuff.  Just tell her that you'd like to start talking about this kind of stuff.  She probably just needs to know that you're not a baby anymore - that's probably what's happening.  She still thinks you're her baby girl and you maybe need to remind her that you're not a baby anymore.|`|xEovmKfvaa	shaving is no big deal. i did it for the first time with my best friend in her bathtub and my mom didnt care because that way she didnt have to teach me! lol. as for the period, it shouldnt be that hard, just ask around what age she started getting breasts or something, that way her answer will be the age that she started puberty, which should be around the time she began her period.|`|W09LN9m7aa	just bring it up casually when you're alone.  "hey mom...i know we don't usually talk about this stuff, but how old were you when you got your first period?  cause i was wondering." and proceed.<br>  <br>  don't feel nervous- she's your mom.  she's been through all that stuff already.  it's completely normal for girls your age to be asking their parents stuff like that.  it's not a big deal at all.=]|`|U8v8RXvQaa	just ask her,<br>  it's nothing to be ashamed of,<br>  everyone goes through it.<br>  well,<br>  every girl:D|`|qazXVoYdaa	dude you fell out her vagina! i think you can talk to here about pretty much anything!!! =D|`|Hxbfg37Xaa	Don't be afraid to ask.

tBaCFTtBaa	you need to be honest with him.. he should have known before the cheating started that you didnt love him anymore.  he needs to know.. now!  he'll appreciate you coming to him instead of doing it (more) behind his back.. maybe you wont stay friends, but its better to get it over with.  good luck!|`|3e342b4c35254658976e2faf3d9365f0aa	Just tell him that you are a liar and have had some "activity" with another.|`|k6M48eUMaa	Well first you need to ask yourself whether its really worth hurting your boyfriend.

Unless you have a reason to distrust him (like had issues with him before) dont snoop, because im sure if he found out he would hate it.|`|PJyrWmdfaa	Not a good idea. If you trust him you wouldn't be doing all this.|`|Bp7Yfsqyaa	Would you think it's OK if he did the exact same thing to you?|`|tXk0oymyaa	one mistake you did right there<br>  make fake profiles of hot girls<br>  ....<br>  <br>  he's a guy of course he's going to flirt a little with them<br>  there a fantasy for him so that's not a good test<br>  <br>  it would be more better and more informative if you made fake profiles with girls that you would normally see walking around the mall/school etc<br>  <br>  I have a boyfriend and we have been going out for 4 months..not that long. But he does go to parties and his friends house. If you don't have a trust issue or suspect 100% your bf is cheating don't do it!!<br>  <br>  1. i changed his phone with mind when he wasn't looking and said it was an accident. He didn't have any suspicious girls or nicknames on his contact list<br>  2. if he went to a party or even to foot locker lol i would always ask if i could go [if not i would check his wallet when he's getting ready and then when he comes back make sure the exact change is left]<br>  3. He remembers the important things like dates and stuff i told him.<br>  4. If he tells me something, the next day he's not going to say something else like i went to the store yesterday no my friends house<br>  5. Calls or text at least twice a week. Either every other day or weekends.<br>  6. If he looks at another girl. That doesn't mean his cheating. His just looking and comparing. Girls do it too whenever you notice it or not [we just do it more secretly]<br>  <br>  there's many more but relationships in the future will bring more experiences that you can share to others|`|6HhF1Ctpaa	i did that once and he fell for it and flirted really hard with this fake girl and even though i suspected that he was a player, seeing it firsthand was absolutely terrible for me. i wouldn't advise it. i know i'll never do it again.
Pp4F6D5Waa	Yes there opinons do matter, its whats on the inside that counts. An ugly girl can still fancy a good looking guy.|`|0JGFv5PXaa	i think they do|`|AA11447210	Looks are subjective. What one person finds attractive may not catch the eye of someone else, or may even be unattractive to yet another person.<br>  <br>  Someone you find unattractive doesn't have a less or more important opinion than anyone else, however it is human nature to value the opionions more of people we like, are interested in, or find phyiscally appealing. That doesn't make them actually worth more, but they will tend to be the ones we put more stock in.<br>  <br>  People's standards for good looks is based on what they like and dislike, not so much what they see in the mirror.|`|3ab0562924ae58daee1fe664ccc36a9daa	Maybe in her eyes you are hot, not everyones taste in looks are the same you know, There maybe a girl that you think is good looking that may think your good looking while another girl you may think is good looking thinks your butt ugly. But i can give you a piece of advice looks are only skin deep its whats on the inside that really matters you may be hot but if your attitude stinks it makes you ugly on the inside and out. <br>     Most of the time those not so attractive girls have great taste, but beware just cause a girl isn't that great looking at the time doesn't mean she will never be good looking, maybe she just hasn't found herself yet? so don't treat a not so attractive girl like crap cause some day you may regret it.|`|SxgOy9uPaa	Mate "WTF" you coming from..Most ugly girls, your words not mine..Will tell you the truth,because they got no where else to go..SO if she says i love you,you better believe,it my friend.. I PERSONALY don't believe,that anybody is ugly..I think your problem,is you have a over,inflated idea of your,own importance,which to me is "crap".".NOBODY"lowers their standards,especially to accommodate,tossers like you..YOU want to be treated good,keep your hands off & be humble in what you do..|`|Qlyh3pG0aa	I think... If a hot guy said that to me I'd be thinkin' ew slut. If an ugly guy said that to me I'd be thinkin' awww I dont wanna hurt ur feelings.|`|n9HUANkiaa	look out ! some ugly girls i went to school with when i saw them 5 years later were very hot !! good thing i was nice to them<br>  i ran into the prom queen 10 years after fat and did not age well.|`|E0LkJMQOaa	You said she was ugly not blind.   Yes her opinion counts!  I worked with a man who said there was no such thing as an ugly woman. One of the other guys wanted to argue with him but to see a woman as ugly just wasn't a part of his character. And every woman there thought he was the greatest. Not one woman  had anything bad to say about him.  When i first met him i would have said he was average but we think he is top notch! Very classy!|`|3MBYUMMMaa	I guess..they're still girls. Their opinions should matter.|`|xeGaCDelaa	She's trying to rape you. Run.|`|AA11179568	yes they matter<br>  because they are still girls|`|JdRTGIUYaa	Well I think that you are ugly and your opinion doesn't matter! so how do you like that?|`|EO1lEP2Vaa	no, not at all

52otNiElaa	Call all the Homies and prank call the *****.|`|dWmT9pBhaa	Give me it|`|B0y9aO1Laa	Dont call her right away.  Use the 3 day rule, wait three days after you get her number and then call her.  It's cool if you txt her but if you call her its better so she could know you have confidence.<br>  <br>  It only should be you two when you hang out, you don't need a third wheel.|`|XRMNQPUIaa	text her just casually asking to hang out..<br>  make it so its just you two because you will get to know her better.|`|iflwrl1Gaa	txt txt txt|`|gFf8KiIIaa	calling her right when you get her number shows you that you dig her a lot, not that your desperate (a common misconception). You should definitely call instead of text. Do it tomorrow but not too early not too late. And lastly, hang out with her in private so you can get to know each other. Usually when you invite some other friends, you end up not really talking to your date much at all because it feels weird around your friends. I like your story, it's cute. haha. good luck with your girl :)<br>  <br>  -Paul|`|AA10989594	if i was you i would at least text her for a while<br>  then ask her out on a date or hang out.<br>  <br>  it funny cause there this guy..i kind of like live few blocks from me but our school is far.<br>  <br>  maybe it a sign|`|ds1rf8efaa	call her, maybe? ha.|`|Ucoj40DXaa	start out by texting her and once it becomes normal and daily, you can start calling her.  Or you can just casually say to her "call me" or "i'll call you" whenever you guys part or whatever, since you guys will proably start talking more often once you start texting.<br>  <br>  And since you guys have a lot of mutual friends, perfect!  You can all hang out together and that will be a chance for you to get to know her and for her to get to know you better.<br>  <br>  Key is, start out slowly and get comfortable.  <br>  Once you're comfortable and confident enough, take it to the next level. <br>  You don't want to be shy and awkward or anything, so go at your own pace, no need to rush :)
rO56gv3Faa	no, it must be herpes.
HKkbqlIuaa	Well, if you really have to ask this question, maybe you are curious? Maybe a small part of you wants to experiment with the same sex. No one can tell you if you're gay but you. I could look at girl on girl porn all day, but that doesn't make me a lesbian. No one else can tell you if you're gay or not.|`|hlvdPjeFaa	Maybe you feel a brotherly bond towards him. Maybe it feels like he's the only person you can relate to and so you enjoy his company more. It doesn't mean you're gay dude.|`|y76xRnbtaa	No pal,if you are attracted to woman,then you are not gay.You are perfectly normal.Your friendship with this guy is totally pure,don't listen to anybody,if you feel comfortable with him,if you think he is your best friend,then don't care about anybody pal.I also have a friend like the one you have,i'm really close to him,and he is only close to me,that doesn't mean we are gay,right?Just do what you think is correct.|`|Ggtccfhhaa	dude you are not gay....his just become your close friend....dude...trust me that is no reason to think you are gay.....if you are comfortable wit your sexuality ..(and you say that you are attracted to girls so you are straight......) it doesnt matter if you are close to you friend.....think of him as your bromosexual....most guys have one...dude your not gay|`|2gUDNUYuaa	If two men are spending time with each other like you just described  and aren't chasing women, then that sounds homosexual to most people. You need to ask him if he is gay to make sure.|`|3jOG5V5caa	If you say your attracted to girls sexually and not with guys then why are you asking this question.|`|j0G4Zz0Yaa	guess thats just your best friend or something. its ok for boys to get close. you dont have to be gay. trust me you'd prolly know if you liked him...just dont give in to what others are saying. they can have you really confused which seems like you kinda already are but good luck and dont stop haning out with that guy just because of what others say. dont worry about them.|`|BXLCiCUlaa	If looking at him gives you a b*ner, you may very well be gay. If your just close friends, congrats, your friends. I dont see why you are so concerned, it doesnt seem like your gay to me.|`|dY73jXc6aa	Nope, not in the least bit. You said it yourself, everything yall do is friendly. Ummmm think of it more as like having a brother.|`|9oz2xLUpaa	no ur not gay<br>  if ur sexually attracted to girls then ur not gay,it just guy love between u two.<br>  but please!!!! dont turn gay!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br>  i hate it when a guy is sexually attracted to girls, but chooses a guy!!|`|DjJwKc9Caa	'Fraid so
22479221292188a6607f3f3cc2c2b5a1aa	You are not gay. You are just a really good friend and you feel the closeness of your friendship. <br>  But no, you are not gay!|`|7z6BWoESaa	I dont think you are gay, you are emotional about this person because you have become close friends, he attracts you because he values you as a friend closeness between two men isnt wrong it is a good thing and you will probably be friends for a lifetime, you feel "love" for him so thats probably why you have pictured him with your arm around him I think you do not have to worry about being gay at all|`|OgQG7oNOaa	Thats really cool to have a friend you appreciate like that I would kill for a friend like that. It doesnt make you gay it makes you an emotional guy.
UQdqzLgfaa	NO NO NO!!  I had a guy like that, and he treated me like crap, and I kept going back, thinking it WAS my fault, and i did it again and again for 3 years..He never changed.  Talk to your man, tell him how you're feeling..and if he doesn't understand, get rid of him (no matter how hard it is) because if he won't listen, he can't change.  Good luck and if you need to talk my email address is<br>  Talia.R.Harper.3@sendit.nodak.edu|`|HBSyVp1kaa	well take it from me if he is all of a sudden just doing this to you then it seems he just finding any and every reason to fight with you maybe he is seeing sombody else and he wants to break up with you but he wants to make it seem like its you fault so just be super nice to him and see how he reacts he his trys to fight about something then you know|`|Ih4T0QpOaa	no it's not normal.  if the guy truly cares and loves you he will not hurt your feelings like that, let alone get annoyed by the littlest things you do.<br>  <br>  it's really clever of him to turn things around because now it's your fault and you have to apologize to him.<br>  <br>  it's not fair.  it's definitely RED FLAG.<br>  <br>  sorry to say but he may have just had a change of heart.|`|37xGYYH0aa	pms for guys.  he might be under a lot of stress. i accidentaly snap at anyone including my gf when im soo stressed out that i cant even sleep. i always appoligize though, and its rare when it happens. if he does it all the time he's just pissed off at the world. Talk tohim and find out whats wrong|`|0DdSoi4Maa	I'd leave him, he's being immature & stupid!  Don't stay with someone who treats you bad & don't stay with someone just to have someone there by your side.  Sounds like he's maybe playing games or testing you or he has problems.|`|BXLCiCUlaa	Maybe he wants to ditch you. If not, ditch him, hes a jerk.|`|nhfaPN0Iaa	yes, known as numbskulls.|`|71VRvldJaa	His response to you was rude and uncalled for.  Sounds to me like he doesn't feel the same about you as he used to!  Sometimes guys (and girls too) want to end the relationship but they don't want to be the one to do it......so they treat their partner like crap until they can't take it anymore and their partner ends up ending the relationship which lets them off the hook!<br>  If he hung up the phone on me after making a comment like that, I wouldn't be picking up the phone the next time he calls!......if he calls!|`|rPZFgiwLaa	I'm not sure why you ask if all guys act like this but the answer is "no" and "no, it's not normal".<br>  Since you've stated that this is your "long-time BF", I'd say that he's either had a recent experience which is making him act this way OR he's just now feeling comfortable around you to show you his true side.<br>  From the example you had described, I'd say you might be on the way to an abusive relationship, if you haven't experienced it already.<br>  Don't believe that it's your fault or that you're the one who's treating him bad.  This just shows his lack of accountability for his behavior, which is common in abusive relationships.<br>  If he thinks you're worth it and he wants to keep his relationship with you, then he should seek counseling ~ maybe even the two of you going together to work this problem out.  Otherwise, your choices are to move on without him or put up with it longer to the point where it may get worse and it's more difficult to move on without him.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|31e85e9ac811c5446c651b02e557f1deaa	I never heard of this before... a man can only do to his girlfriend is to be sweet at all times like saying "Hi sweetheart, have you eaten your dinner? are you fine today? i'll come over if you don't feel well."|`|DJOEV2TDaa	Guys are touchy little babies. You'll learn that. Your trick is to find the least touchy little baby.<br>  <br>  He sounds like a VERY touchy little baby... time for a new baby.|`|5oltZU5saa	Dump the loser! I've been married 18 years and I have never spoken to my wife once like that. If he was into you he would put you on a pedestal.
e9bv4ijlaa	stop comparing everyone to him then you'll get over him|`|M7r7gHNGaa	Keep reminding yourself what a player he is.|`|nYzcP5V9aa	Let me know when you find out please!<br>  Email me or IM me I would love it!<br>  I'm in the same exact position<br>  It's been over a year<br>  And it breaks my heart<br>  <br>  The only thing that occasionally gets him off my mind are my friends.<br>  They save me from being a total and complete loser|`|AA11584265	It just takes time...its different for everyone. There is no set amount of time that says "after one year you are over your ex" you just gotta get back out there and learn to take things slower. Appreciate the men that you meet for who they are because like you, each of them also have something unique to offer to a relationship. Just because this ex of yours was your "ideal fantasy man" doesn't mean that you should compare him to every man that you meet. It doesn't give the new guy a fair chance to show you who he is. Why would you want to be with one of the biggest players in your area and feel like you aren't important to him. You even said that he has no feelings for girls. Wouldn't you rather be with a man that would treat you with respect and dignity? Maybe someone that is proud to introduce you as his girlfriend? <br>  <br>  Try this just once...the next date you go on....do these 3 things: <br>  <br>  1) Give him a compliment. Tell him you think he looks nice or more specifically say "Oh I like your shirt...blue is my favorite color". You have done 2 things...you have complimented him and so now he will relax knowing that you like "something" about him already. Secondly he will learn that "blue" is your favorite color. <br>  <br>  2) Don't spend the whole evening talking about yourself and your friends and what you did last night. Instead, ask him questions like what is your all time favorite movie? Or, have you ever gone anywhere exotic? Find out what his interests are and if he asks you...be courteous enough to respond. This will allow you a chance to learn a little more about him before you judge him on the physical attributes that you always seemed to compare to your ex at times. After all, there must have been something that attracted you to this new guy if you are out on a date with him - otherwise why are you with him?<br>  <br>  3.) Look for signs that say he is interested in you. Does he lean in close when you are talking to him as if he wants to soak up every last word you say. Does he smile a lot, or try to touch your hand, arm or leg? If so, these are all classic signs that he is interested in you. If he is a decent person, you will be able to tell after talking to him for at least the first 15 minutes. If he starts out by talking about how he misses his ex, then he isn't looking for a girlfriend..he needs a therapist. So just try these 3 things. Like I said..in the first 15 minutes you will know whether or not you want to go out with him again. But give him a chance to warm up and give yourself a chance to learn more about him. Some of the best relationships start in the most modest of ways. Good luck.|`|7yUoLRDyaa	I was in the same situation! <br>  I promise.....Actually still is...<br>  All i do is try to stay my distance away from him and erase his number...o yeah it do my best not to pick up when he calls. I mean i talk to alot of other guys and to this day i still compare them to him but the good thing is it is slowly wearing off, im starting to not compare them as much and I actually think i am starting to like someone so, i knw its been awhile but i promise it will get better. I know it seems like its not but it will|`|eh47fie6aa	Chocolate. I swear it helps. Working it off, helps even more!|`|4ef505315e6714cd6a174d1beb0546f0aa	Do things for yourself. Go hang out with your girls. Start doing activities that you enjoy. Get things going in your life that are fulfilling.<br>  <br>  When you spend time thinking about the things you DO have in your life, you'll forget about the things you DON'T have.<br>  <br>  And what's up with you? Two months? There are people breaking up after 5-10 years. Besides, he sounds like a total douchebag that gives men a bad name, he's in fact just a boy still. Why do you want that? Exclusivity? He's available to all these girls, yet you want him all for yourself? Selfish. Get over yourself.<br>  <br>  If you want happiness, go out there and get it yourself. Don't wait on or expect someone else to provide you with happiness. It's all gotta come from you and only you, otherwise you'll NEVER be happy, whether you're single OR in a relationship.|`|rasrQ9mraa	Just meet other guys, spend more time doing what you like to do.<br>  <br>  I was in a similar situation with a girl who broke up with me. I was crushed for a week or so, and I realized how useless it was being so down. I picked up my guitar, played soccer with my friends whenever I could, and I even tried my luck with another girl.<br>  <br>  If the guy sees you having fun, he'll begin to like you more. From there, you can do what you like: go back out with him, or lead him on and get revenge.|`|xEwOAjJWaa	delete hes number... but incase you wanna be friends further down the track hand hes number to a mate to give you further down the track.<br>  and dating guys straight after the break up isnt such a smooth idea..<br>  in time you'll be over him<br>  :)

Definitely don't want too much tongue and definitely not too much saliva. At times I like for it to be slow, romantic and other times I want it to be more agressive.

How do you feel about him? If you are interested, tell me. Other wise ignore it. It can make things complicated and awkward if he tells you that he's crushing and you don't reciprocate.

NO Would you rather date a girl that is too fat or too skinny? id chose  the middle, but if you limit it to those i would pick B|`|EKM9AKc2aa	in the middle|`|fh8bQdGkaa	Honestly, it's got to do with how shallow a person is, and what their interests are. I personally think that really skinny girls are hard to watch. I don't think it's attractive in terms of dating. Maybe she has some major vanity issues that she needs to resolve, so I'd probably put that on the very long maybe list. Same with overweight chicks. They probably have issues of their own. Maybe both of them don't, but if I knew them personally, I'd know what the answer would be. People can change their body weight too you know. So it's not like that would be my absolute deciding factor in dating. All in all, I'd date a girl that was in between too fat and too skinny. Maybe a little to the skinny side, but looking very healthy. All that aside, it's what is inside that counts. I'm only attracted to girls with awesome personalities that know how to smile, even if they are a little too skinny, or a little overweight. I'd rather have fun during the date instead of trying to get to the finishing line or whatever.|`|DhCNKQ7xaa	too skinny is plain nasty<br>  i would rather have a girl thats a littleeee on the chubbier side than a girl whoss too skinny|`|6IuarYyOaa	most dudes will say in the middle, that perfect size but who really knows what that is. personally i like them more chunky than super skinny but thats just me|`|8TLKZHjIaa	i think guys like just normal girls, not skinny and not to fat.

o4F1v1mqaa	Wow. This question reminds me of my freshman year of high school. lol I was in the same boat as you are, totally unsure. But the only way you can be is if you ASK HIM directly about it. But do it when the two of you are alone. It'll proabably make him feel more comfortable, that way.<br>  <br>  But you should do it sometime soon. Don't wait to act on it. TRUST ME.

RYLkjYkIaa	Just go directly to her and ask her out for another return cup of tea, and things from there will turn brighter for u, sure she likes u because she is doing these things.
XSttLbMRaa	you should put some feelers out there first before you make a move. <br>  does she talk about other guys to you?? if so, she might not be into you<br>  in that way<br>  I'd say do some extremely light flirting first to see how she reacts.  If she doesn't seem to pick up on the light hints then you should leave it alone for now. dont ruin your friendship just yet.<br>  does she have a lot of girlfriends, but opts to hang out with you instead? if so then maybe she likes you too, but wants you to make the first move. <br>  If you really really like her I would offer her a single flower (her fav) the next time you have tea together and ask her if she is seeing anyone (flower not really needed for this) if she says no. then ask her if she'd consider seeing you as you seem to have a lot in common and the chemistry seems right. be sure to emphasize that you dont want to ruin the friendship!|`|6eNsc3y2aa	Do something creative.<br>  Or something that has to do with tea since you guys seem to do that a lot.<br>  Or an inside joke that you guys have.<br>  I'm pretty sure she doesn't like boring, so do something outside of the box.<br>  Good luck =]
ifvkj0Hbaa	well you say she has been your friend for many years, and friends do that sometimes, i mean ask out for tea and what ever... there are some odds that she is into you, but if i where you i would not try, because if you do, it may change your friendship forever<br>  ask her out for a coffee or something like that, but don't date her :)|`|neXoJrvkaa	yes she is|`|j3YRIJafaa	you two are extremely close, the one concern you have to think about is that if you two go out and things dont go well you could lose each other especially if u broke up. i wouldnt ask her bluntly out just sit her down with a meal at one of your houses alone and tell her how you feel if you get a positive reponse and you really want to go for it then do it, just put in 100% in the relationship and if you see it heading for disaster then say to her i love you to pieces and i dont want to lose you, i think we were better and stronger as friends etc, so just think with your head as well as your heart sometimes just being mates with this girl can be the best thing  - hope this helps and good luck|`|euYz39Epaa	well either she classes you as a realll iclose friend or yeah shes into you...<br>  you have two choices.. if u dont want to ruin your friendship.. then dont say nething and jsut see where it leads.. but if your realli into her.. and u think theres a chance.. than go for it.. let it out.. tell her how u feel- and say u dont want it to ruin ur friendship.. <br>  good luk buddy :)
ePEQcIz3aa	Sounds like he values you more than he does sex.  Perhaps he feels satisfied enough with where you two are at.<br>  <br>  Ask him if he is bored, maybe he wants to spice things up in the bedroom.|`|SRzL2Wexaa	Yeah, you should.  Or ask him if he prefers you finding it elsewhere.  He'll probabably wake up then.|`|nwNkXEO3aa	Have you ever asked him for sex? If so, was it very frequent. If no, then just go ahead and ask. I believe there is a high chance he want to do it. For the long term, try something different this time round. A session of sex that is different  from the rest. Maybe, allow him to suck your nipples. Or maybe do some mourning etc.|`|DZ23afDLaa	There are a number of things that come into play her lets investigate.<br>  <br>  1. Maybe he respects you and does not want to pressure about sex.<br>  2. If number 1 is correct snuggle up next him and make your play he may want you to ask him for sex to me it is a turn on but remember it is in the presentation.<br>  <br>  3. the last time you guys had sex did something go wrong did you attempt to do something and it did work out.<br>  <br>  4.  how is your hygiene no one wants girl that smells before or after sex.<br>  <br>  5.Find out if he is masturbating if he is that is why he has gotten himself off and now it no need for anything else until later.<br>  <br>  6. and last but not least he is getting sex from some where else.|`|KPUJMgrYaa	just be honest with him honey pie!<br>  <br>  tell him casually that you feel like he doesnt rally wanna have sex and much, and if this is so why? is there anything you can do to help?<br>  <br>  also tell him that you sometimes feel a little wierd asking him for it. i know that it can be a little awkward.. but its always nice to feel like a guy really wants to be have sex with you, and that ur not the only one whose into it. <br>  <br>  good luck<br>  xxxxxxxx|`|bIIyFFsbaa	women are worth millions .  Not to hurt your feelings maybe he is not interested to have sex for what ever reason. . it-sounds like you very into this guys .  Don't feel bad just because he doesn't desire to have sex like you do..  Be very careful don't get hurt when you feel that something is off and not normal those are red lights .  Im sure you are a very pretty person keep  ur head up it will be his lost not yours.  Stay strong and proud .  Do you think he has someone else ?
mvrygTYTaa	He is either lying about something or is just very shy. If it is the latter, he might be afraid that you will reject him upon seeing him even if he has sent you photos.|`|vFzhdHBqaa	Maybe it's cause u live in different states|`|SRzL2Wexaa	Wow, no clue.  I guess at least you had his address.  A guy I was talking to, who supposedly loved me, didn't want to give me his address.  I asked why, and he said he didn't want to, until we met.  But, in his eyes phone-sex and cyber-sex were okay with someone you haven't met yet.  Wierd freaking priorities and morals, I have to say. I wanted to meet him, but he kept putting it off, so I told him to leave me alone.  Are you sure he isn't a scammer?|`|ectaeydbaa	If it's not a money problem (with traveling between states)... then either he's NOT single or he is single but is self-conscious of how he looks.

This is a perennial thing, people won't approve others easily for several reason the first thing being the ego factor and if it is the same gender also it is considered as weakness therefore don't give much thought to it and go ahead how friendly you are to others also matters as long as it is not on material benefits.|`|WHwSU64Daa	Are you ugly.<br>  <br>  NO OFFENCE. but apparently i worked with alot of people who avoided the ppl who are'fat' no offence.<br>  seriously look at yourself.<br>  <br>  =\ my advice

Answers.  You won't find reasoning here, appropriate or otherwise :p|`|08IaFoRgaa	I do not believe any one of these to be any worse than the other.  Affairs are often the result of a person feeling some void in their life or relationship.  A woman has many needs that often times men can overlook.  <br>  <br>  All to often, a husband and wife end up living in separate worlds, even though they may live in the same house.  Their lives can become routine and they end up going through the motions in their relationship instead of trying to keep things fresh and alive.  Or one spouse may just not be putting any effort in it at all leaving the other frustrated and longing for the love and romance they knew in the beginning. Each of these types of "affairs" only show a different area of need in this woman's life.

Honestly, it seems like John was interested in you first, so you should be getting the better shot with him. To me, it seems like Jenna is treating you pretty badly, and real friends wouldn't do that to you, even over a guy. Her actions may even be a red alert concerning your friendship.<br>  But first things first, you need to talk to her, and get down to the point. That's the only way this will go anywhere.<br>  <br>  I hope that helps. :)|`|KYGGglowaa	1st things 1st....theres a million fishes in the sea...dont get tied up with that one fish...if you know what I mean. But...if you want to really straighten things out...talk with John first. It seems that your friend already stabbed you in the back...kinda sorda. I mean, she was being extermely jelous...which isnt right. If you feel up to it, confront your "so-called friend" My friends would never do that. Their way too loyal of friends to do that. But I would of left too.....I wouldnt want to crash the whole party or anything...it gives some time with stepping away and breath a little bit....and then I would've talked when I felt comfortable talking to John or Jenna....It all depends on how bad this Jenna chic hurt you....go with your gut feeling..you'll be fine...keep your head up.|`|uZDe2eM3aa	If this jenna is really your friend and she knows you like him too then she will leave him alone and i think if you cared enough about your friendship with jenna you would let him go. good friendships are much more rare than guys and i think you and jenna should talk to each other and sort something out that you both can live with and that wont sacrifice ur friendship.
zpAAVvaOaa	The good thing is you told him how you feel and that takes guts. Maybe he is a little shocked because he isn't used to girls telling him how they feel towards him. Just give him time, after all he is just a boy ;)<br>  <br>  Fern x|`|3890f326e072192e79ea3f718551dfb8aa	There is nothing wrong with being honest about how you feel. If he's not capable of handling that, he may not be worth your time. <br>  <br>  There are a number of possible reasons why he's acting different. Most likely he just needs some time to process it.|`|7Icg8uKraa	Don't worry about it so much!!! Just give him some time to think about it.

(And if you don't then find out).  It's not really fun to crush on somebody for a long time and not know whether anything can or will happen.  It's a waste of time.  If he likes you then cool, you two feel the same way.  If he doesn't then now you know so you can move on and hopefully you can still be friends.|`|2AYgpeNYaa	dear, you shouldnt have to be sorry for what you've said..<br>  you just said what you feel.. and thats good..<br>  if he acted differently after your confession, its not your fault,.<br>  <br>  its up to him to take it or leave it..|`|GB8tHYxRaa	Well? Different in a bad way or in a good way?  I've had girls tell me they like me and I was happy to hear it but I'm sure I acted differently afterward.|`|e5WdMvDZaa	no it's good that you did. you're better off knowing if he's interested or not, rather than sitting around and wondering if he is.|`|fV2RBwIJaa	Wouldn't you rather he knew rather than sitting wondering "what if?"

zpAAVvaOaa	It's up to you, if you feel your ready for a relationship then go for it.

Going back to your home (or his) where you might be on your own, is not a good idea until you've known each other for a few months and are sure he doesn't want you for One Thing!<br>  <br>  If he thinks much of you! He wont hurry you into doing stuff that you feel insecure about,  before you are sure that you are ready to. You need to know a bit about his relationship history -how many girlfriends has he had and how long  have these relationships lasted for??  Does he dump girls after he's slept with them?<br>  <br>  Good Luck in Love, and Hey.. Be Careful Out There.
8445498a066182908045258b3eca3b35aa	I think you need to look at your definition of love.<br>  <br>  I don't intentionally try to hurt anyone that I love.<br>  I am not act cold with them or try to make things intentionally hard for them.<br>  <br>  You two are just playing games...|`|1dP7Viiuaa	yup. forget him and move on. why would u want to be with someone whom u dont know where u stand with? why be with someone when u always end up quarrelling when u talk? isnt it soo much of effort and so exhausting? there are guys out there who will treat u btr, im sure|`|70576ab1b38f12b9364060a488f36a5eaa	well i do believe that you love him,but you also do not deserve to be hurt.try talking to him again either by using the telephone,letters text messages or so try to be calm this time and just explain your self tell him how much he hurt you and tell him it's because you love him you want to hold on.if his answers are negative then you have to forget him,see if he changes after about a two weeks if not sorry but you deserve better move on.
VRSUyeqbaa	yes, it is nice, no reason to be stuck in the house all night after being at work all day. if he goes out, plan on going out the same night with your friends.|`|eb37f16287577270e1e68cedbc30c1a2aa	no you shouldnt go out at all.you should be at home in the kitchen or scrubbing the toilet after your husband and all his mates have come around and used it.it is perfectley normal for your man to go out wenever he can and bring home stray women , that way they can keep him amused and you can keep cleaning without any interruptions.if you start going out you will more then likely be branded a whore by your community  hope this helps
K2QwEM4raa	If you both behave and trust each other then I see nothing wrong with this. And make sure that time is set aside for just you two. If done to often I do believe in could lead to problems because there is booze and the opposite sex always on the prowl. You may know the old saying they always look better at closing time!|`|AYfJWQuTaa	Sure, what's good for him is good for you as well; just have a girlie evening out & keep safe, some years ago some friends & I went abroad for a couple of long week ends, it was fun and great memories.|`|Kh5o3QCcaa	It is healthy to have time out with friends to socialize.  I do agree with the answer's above about behaving respectfully (That should of course be a given, hard to tell these days though), and with the fact that this shouldn't be tit-for-tat.<br>  <br>  Don't listen to what your friends say about it, this should be between you and your husband, and if he is loving and supportive of you he should have no problem with you going out I would hope..<br>  <br>  Talk to him about it, and get yourself a fun night out dancing with your girl friends!|`|xGI9z01Maa	Getting out is important for woman.  If you can't find yourself and give yourself time, then how can you be a good mother or wife to some one.  <br>  <br>  The old rule was that women did not go out with their friends, but note how many people were in bad relationships.  <br>  <br>  I find that getting out at least a few times a month makes me a better wife and mother.  I currently go hiking with my girl friend once a week.  It's my time to be away from my husband and children and do something for myself.  Otherwise, I am the cook, the nurse, the taxi cab, the maid, the "I have to have a ____ for school tomorrow?" at 9pm supply hunter, and all the other things that go into being a wife and mother.  It helps me center myself.  Please you can't miss what you have not left.|`|AA11198190	Yes...regardless of how loving and dedicated  a marriage is ....we all need space with our girlfriends.l have a night out with my friends once a month.We have a good time.....no guys...just good clean fun.|`|7d535ccd0098dd19bfe900035ca87c98aa	Its good to have girls night out occasionally.|`|xb1crStQaa	When you're married,there are certain things that you know you could do and you can't.Once in a while is ok.But know your limits. And make sure hubby know's exactly whom you're with and your whereabouts.If hubby is ok to let you go, than go.But if he says "No" you shouldn't fight it. Some guys need to go out and meet up with friends for a drink and talk about their stuffs or worked.I think that is normal. As long as not all the time. But for a wife to go outing, and without the kids around her, this may be a little bit difficult for the husband to accept. Wife has many responsibilities at home unlike husbands. We can always meet up with girl friends for a cup of coffee or meet up for gatherings or lunch one in a while.Just a day should be enough.Other than that why not we bring husband along? that case we can avoid any misunderstanding.It's actually not a bad thing to do as long as your husband is open minded and understands you.As a wife we know what is right and what is wrong. Yes,we can go out with friends but not until make the husband unhappy. We must always careful on what we do. And careful not to spoil our husbands trust...|`|DZ23afDLaa	Girls out are alright providing that you behave yourself while you are out.  I mean act like a lady and not some little slut chasing other men.Just remember that you have a husband at home.  It is healthy to get away for awhile you both need some space from each other every now and than you will find out that you really do love each other when you are out because you will always be thinking of the other person.|`|PkDokr8Iaa	Is this a "tit for tat" issue?  You do it, therefore so can I?  Is that why you want to arrange a GNO?<br>  <br>  If you want to enjoy time with your friends just because you enjoy being with them, then go for it.  But, if you wanting to arrange a GNO to try and 'get back' at your husband, then you're making a bad decision.
NmA0nJKHaa	Not enough information. Maybe he's just shy.|`|iVCo3lCvaa	one advice - STAY AWAY from weird guys. . <br>  <br>  otherwise - if a guy acts differently to you like he does usually, chances are he likes you.
a79b376f814b9b52daa5b96365dcd2caaa	Really annoying...now that is someone who pretends to be a friend, talks nonsense about "gayest Hair ever"  and who constantly says "like" and who thinks Nike's are gay.  Not only is that person annoying, immature and very boring, but probably uneducated.  I think you are the meanest person ever, not this other poor girl.<br>  <br>  I am sure this is not the answer you wanted, but you raised the "annoying" subject.|`|nYqtw9DWaa	What the hell is wrong with you? So you don't like her because she has the 'gayest hair ever' or she doesn't want to be like everyone and else and wear Nikes? Who cares?? Looks like you're judging her for her outer appearances which is very superficial.  And if you find her annoying, then don't pretend to be friends with her, thats just mean and immature.|`|ee4678869d4897b2132614f58b4c0ecfaa	What exactly does GAY HAIR look like?  I'm curious.  <br>  <br>  Sounds like you are the one that's annoying.  I applaud that girl for not wanting to be like everyone else.  <br>  <br>  If you find her annoying, then leave her be.  Don't pretend to be her friend especially when you come on the internet to talk about her like this.<br>  <br>  She sounds like a nice girl to me, but whatever.|`|20da7e19a185ca8c01b2a311761afcd6aa	Your kind of mean. If she wants to wear nikes, then ****** let her wear them its HER life. If you dont like her, then you shouldnt pretend to be her friend. She probably knows you dont like her since your so damn mean anyways. TREAT PEOPLE THE WAY YOU WANNA BE TREATED.|`|yQ1UfuZWaa	your r being kinda mean and judgemental. i mean seriously just because she wants to get a different brand of shoe and stand out from everyone else doesn't make her mean or gay or annoying!! it just makes you mean gay and annoying to put her down like that.|`|n4gnjjhCaa	she is cool she is drifferent not a robot like everyone else.|`|M6w0MMU8aa	Ask her what;s wrong. Sometimes this kind of behavior started out from a problem within family or any other things. Tell her gently the Truth or just show it to her without her noticing that your trying to show her something. For example, ask 2 girls to pretend to be her and you in a situation you had with her. Maybe she would realize what she's doing wrong and see the true her.|`|AA11275104	Why do people like you feel the need to pretend to be friends with someone? Your just as bad as everybody else. Every heard the saying no one is perfect?   I really think she isn't loosing anything by loosing you as a friend. Just tell her that you want to stop being friends with her and why.|`|gu2MmdRFaa	Dont lead her on a wild goose chase, trying to be friends with her. tell her if you have THAT bigger problem<br>  <br>  and dont you think its good that she has her own style, and shes not being a sheep following the Plimsol look..|`|njDZg2uFaa	well, u should just tell her. If you find her that annoying it wont be so hard!|`|qmMCGKl9aa	lmfao . ohkai ; let me ask you something.<br>  <br>  what's wrong with the fact that she doesn't want to look like everyone else?<br>  Just because you and your friends don't like Nike's doesn't mean that she can't wear them.<br>  <br>  I feel like you are judging her by her outer appearance. and not even taking a chance to get to know her and understand what she really is like.<br>  <br>  And if she annoys you so much, the answer is clear. Don't try to PRETEND to be friends with her. That's stupid, immature and makes no sence! if you don't like someone then you simply don't talk to them and end of story.
szVvf7Nkaa	Don't you find this a bit suspicious that he got rejected with all the job applications that he applied for but now has a new job in his hometown? I have a bad feeling that this guy is not honest with you. I think he's leading you on. And if you don't want to get your heart broken then don't waste your time waiting for this guy. I think this guy is a coward because he has no guts to tell you that you don't have a relationship. You say that neither of you has not brought up the topic of "us" doesn’t that tell you something. I think you should break off with him because if you don't then he's going to continue to make you believe that you do have relationship. And you could really fall hard for this guy and he will hurt you. If he got himself a new job then that means, he has no intention of moving to where you live.|`|djUMvICoaa	O.K., you've got a pen pal, I would leave it at that because what do you really know about this guy?  Do you know what he really is doing back home?   Is he just stringing you along?  Here's what you do know, you did something impulsive, something you don't usually do, it makes you question the reason why.  You know that he applied for a lot of jobs where you are and didn't get a bit on a one of them.  That should tell you something in itself.  You can't have a bunch of company's so blind as to a person's worth, something is hidden in here that must also bother you.  And it's a long distance friendship at the best.  If you can have someone you can chat with occasionally, that is nice, but I wouldn't pin my hopes and dreams that it's going to be anything more than that.

I see it now.  You checking his phone calls, trying to read his emails, standing around the corner when he talks on the phone.  Trust me hun, I know what you are going through.  Nobody should ever feel the need to do this to their spouse just as well nobody should ever make there spouse feel that it is necessary.  My ex husband did and was the same way yours is now.  I look back and could pinpoint the day I should have left.  All that sticking around did for me was make me a very angry, nosy, upset, paranoid, and difficult wife.  I just don't want you to end up the same way I was.  Understand that this is not your fault.  You can't change people and you deserve to be treated with respect.  It's no good for you, your husband, and especially your children (if you have any)!  I'm not telling you to run out and get a divorce.  If you have a chance at all and truly want to you should seek more counseling with him and try to make it work.  I even went as far as to go to counseling without him because I felt as if my self worth was shot to the ground when I found out what he had been doing.

It seems as though you did not trust your husband before you read the e-mails. If you had, when he left his account open, you would have closed it without searching thru it.  When you go looking for trouble, you usually find it. <br>  <br>  In relationships, everyone needs to have their own friends and hobbies <br>  seperate and apart from their spouses. Develop your own interests and stop worrying about what he is doing.<br>  <br>  Is he meeting these women in person? If not, I'd leave it alone. <br>  <br>  What are you doing? <br>  Build your self-esteem up and if you really don't care about him then don't delay. Pack your things up and leave.|`|z2TjjnxVaa	That's a horrible situation to be in. <br>  <br>  I don't think you can find out if he's still doing it, if he locks you out of his computer. If you ask him again it would mean that you don't trust him and he would probably become angrier.<br>  I was watching a sex show the other night and they were discussing how some people become addicted to things like this. I think some of them probably find it exciting, but I also don't think that many of them would follow through with it. It's just exciting and a bit of an ego boost to have all of these women adore you. <br>  <br>  You have to decide if you can live with that? It sounds like to me he doesn't want to change and he's not very trustworthy if he's locking you out of everything. It's a big problem with computers today. <br>  <br>  I guess your only option would be to try to talk to him, angry or not.

zGFiWSPtaa	She's not your real friend!! She's using you sweetie, and she's taking advantage of your kind friendly forgiving nature. I have had friends like that and all I can say is that it gets worse. She is not worth your time and your an awesome girl who deserves waaaay better. You're too good for her. Make other friends and ignore her. She can't stop you from being friendly to other people. Make friends out of school if you have to (be friendly and nice at parties, camps, clubs, sports teams etc). Ignore her and let her be nasty to you all she wants. She'll get tired and eventually be nasty to other people and no one will like her. Besides, she can't follow you around forever. After high school, you'll most likely never see her again!!! Let her be, but don't continue this friendship, you'll just get hurt in the end. YOU DESERVE BETTER!!!! GOOD LUCK!!!!|`|prjXvpL8aa	When you guys fight she's mean. Huh. would have never guessed that! She's mean because she is pissed off! Now if she's mean even when you guys aren't in fights, I would dump her, or tell her how you feel. If she keeps getting in the way then ignore her... its not THAT hard|`|hwR7FgkQaa	Dont hate her be civil with her but if she's mean to you just ignore it and hang with your other friends............it will get her jealous and she will start being nice|`|pmRsYHSvaa	JUST FORGATE ABT HER FIGHT N THINK ONLY HER FRIENDSHIP TIME

U5ba4q6Laa	well you lost some of his respect so the logical and mature thing to do would be to earn it back. Sit down with your dad and be honest about why you made a poor choice about lying. He just loves you and is worried about you and someday trust me you will be grateful. But for now just see it from his perspective and let him know that are going to grow from this experience and you appreciate the fact that he cares so much.|`|Nls2F1Uwaa	it is going to take time to earn the trust back As parents we need to "see" apology in behaviour Not just hear words|`|8lY97vE9aa	that's why you shouldn't lie.|`|pKzH1cFHaa	He is trying to protect you. You may be sorry, but sometimes sorry isn't good enough. Do not bug him about it, wait a month or so before bringing up seeing your boyfriend again.|`|s2Mbl533aa	Your dad is keeping you from him for a reason, respect him.
kz2futeQaa	well my first kiss was a little scary. If he likes you trust me this will be easy i would say be a little flirtacious with him why your there and maybe when you to get close say i really like your eyes and concentrate on them it brings emotion and then kinda get closer. I would suggest im wide open i would be like i really want to kiss you and if your in this moment trust me it will work. then lean in softly place your lips to his and turst me its amazing and ps. you probbaly wont have to worry about a makeout becuase it doesnt tend to happen that fast.|`|TE9I4Xr5aa	get yourselves alone in a ride or at a corner and say "I cant belive it's your b-day already.I havent given u my gift,because I've kept it here.Then you kiss him or continue to say something sweet.When you kiss, u should do it gently and not rush..TRUST ME..Just do it by how you've seen nomies.I know it sounds weird but practice if you really feel like you want to do this.No one's gonna look at u ,and u might feel rediculus,but it'll all be worth it.I hope the best for U,and good luck.|`|AGA8IkSXaa	practice on the bak of ur hand!!!<br>  it sounds crazy but thats wut i did!!!<br>  and u should start off slow and only kiss wit ur lips   then move 2 the tung<br>  good luck!!!!<br>  xoxo  :)

FSyFCHMHaa	First thought that popped in my head  when I read the title "poor sheltered thing." <br>  <br>  Of course the additional information changes my opinion. Women want a man to fulfill a role in their lives and a majority of women prefer a man to take initiative, to be successful and dominate. It's a cultural norm and thirty year old virgins don't fit that image. People by nature are going to be curious and concern by your decision of celibacy but if your a well rounded individual in all other aspects of life, I wouldn't see any problems ahead for you.|`|iLJFFvlEaa	This might not be the answer you are looking for, but I would actually just think that he's a good guy who is willing to wait and has enough self-control for the right woman.<br>  <br>  The additional info wouldn't really change my mind, it would just add another reason - he's probly really busy.|`|AA11566072	1st impression...wow thats something you don't see every day, he  must either be gay or is waiting for the right girl.<br>  <br>  2nd impression. He's had to work hard to get where he is and hasn't had time for a girlfriend, possible workoholic, would he have time for me?|`|Zano5kGaaa	First impression- It would be hard to believe, especially coming from a guy but it wouldn't be a turn off or anything. <br>  The additional info wouldn't really change my opinion about him. It would actually be a plus.|`|bsnIFwajaa	i think that i would respect you more then, because you give the impression that NOT being sexually active is your life. so if you found something else to do than think about that then yeah.|`|jFQQAKFuaa	I WILL RESPECT HIM<br>  I WILL BE PROUD OF HIM<br>  I WILL HIM TO BE MY FRIEND|`|kh9qs6qiaa	Are you the 30 year old virgin?<br>  <br>  If so, I think it's kind of sweet you waited so long to be with the "right girl."|`|CE6drypraa	Good for you!
q8eue7CRaa	Whoops! So you have to get it today?<br>  <br>  "A Contemporary or Modern 16th anniversary gift has a theme of Silver Holloware.<br>  <br>  This Wedding Anniversary does not have any Flowers associated with it.<br>  <br>  The Gemstone list shows Peridot and Aquamarine associated with this Wedding Anniversary"|`|F4k68ilkaa	Traditionally, the gift for the 16th wedding anniversary is silver tableware, such as vases, tureens, sugar bowls, etc.<br>  <br>  I seriously doubt your husband would want any of this. How about something made of silver he'll actually use, like a money clip or cuff links?|`|vHBvkROeaa	Well, as this is a very special occasion you can offer him a nice original gift like a canvas printed with your favorite photo together in one of the styles you like. This would really be memorable. Here's a source you can use: <a href="http://www.photo-print-on-canvas.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.photo-print-on-canvas.com/</a>|`|nDHyeDVoaa	I'd get him a nice silver watch. Nothing too pricy, but something classy that he can wear to work or out to dinner with you :-)|`|1b5728f019d41475becb84dd96477ca3aa	Silver Hallow Wear
QdCwBSVQaa	It would probably be a little odd if she were wearing a full-skirted ball gown while the bridesmaids were in sundresses, but that's a matter of formality, not skirt length.<br>  <br>  I'd say let her wear what she feels comfortable wearing.  If she's an older lady, she may feel better about have her legs covered.  It won't detract from you or the wedding party no matter what.<br>  <br>  In 36 years of attending weddings, I have never, ever, ever seen a MIL or MOTB upstage a bride.  No one is paying that close attention to what she's wearing.|`|KTNqah9eaa	Ha ha - sounds like the first occasion for in laws to be out of sync with each other. I would suggest a a bit of shuttle diplomacy between both families may be in order so that they are both wearing long, short - or the compromise,somewhere in between :)|`|1KfbgBupaa	No, it's not OK.  Her dress should also be short or tea length at the longest.|`|Wzws8v8daa	sure it is!  my wedding etiquette book says the mother of bride and mother of groom can pick out their own attire and can wear what they choose and do not need to match the wedding party.|`|aipChC3haa	Yup it's totally fine.|`|IE1LvgD9aa	Either would be fine AS LONG AS SHE DOES NOT OUTSHINE THE BRIDE!|`|qRIMM2ycaa	Yeah it should be fine.<br>  <br>  If the Mother of the Groom is not part of the wedding party, then the Bride really doesn't get to dictate what she wears.
yTJit4U8aa	As parents they should be supporting you no matter what, and if you forgive him for whatever he did, so should they. Also, you are 23! You're an adult and can make your own decisions, and they should support you, and if you've been dating him for that long, they should realize that he's "special", and should be thrilled to give you their blessing. So, just approach them honestly, and tell them how much their blessing and support would mean to the BOTH of you, and how ready you believe you are to get married. <br>  <br>  Sometime with parents like that, it's good to discuss your goals that you and your hopefully-future-fiance have like when you plan on buying a house, getting a job out of college, how you will pay for the wedding and such. If they see how mature you are in that sense maybe they will overlook you age, and truly see you as an adult.|`|JtEBaOdjaa	Never, you are not their property.  You are an adult. he should ask YOU not them.  I HATE that old tradition.  It's misogynistic and disgusting.<br>  <br>  As for telling them, tell them now before you start making plans.  Otherwise they'll be mad at the fact you hid it from them.  Even if they are mad, they'll get over it VERY quick once they realize you ARE doing what you want with your life and if they don't get over it they just won't be there to watch their daughter get married.|`|WxbPOmrFaa	Although you are already an adult, you made a right decision to ask your parent's blessing. and God will bless you too. Try to find a moment when you are together with your parents and everyone is in a good mood or talks about weddings..just have your boyfriend start telling your parents..|`|errJ7VL1aa	Speak to your parents first by yourself especially if you don't expect them to be gung ho over the idea.  Let them know that in spite of a "rough patch" in the beginning of your relationship, the two of you have the experience of working things out.  That is crucial to a long-term relationship like marriage.  Let them know now that your bf has proposed to you and you would like their blessing.<br>  I have to say one thing to you.  My mother never approved of my marriage to my husband.  She made up her mind she didn't like him and that was that, but she was never ugly towards him to his face.  He and I have been happily married for 35 years.  Don't allow your parents to make this decision for you.  You have your own life to live.<br>  I want to wish you and your fiance' the very best in life.|`|PAZWfnFtaa	He should ask for their blessing alone.  Whatever it is that he did to make them so upset, he needs to acknowledge.  Maybe he can ask them to dinner where they can discuss things.  He just needs to brag about how great you are, how you made him a better person, etc.  A few days before you should talk to your parents about how great things are going and how excited you are for your future with him.  Talk him up, let him talk you up, and hopefully they'll understand.  Congrats!|`|r7nm8TiNaa	Why not now. Invite your parents to dinner and tell them what you have told us.  I would finish school first. It's hard to concentrate on a husband and possibly children when you are in college.
71VRvldJaa	My guy would NEVER say that to me!......even if he thought I was!<br>  If your guy said that to you, I'll bet that's something you won't soon forget!  True or not, it's a very mean, hurtful thing to say to anyone.|`|q2POh1dEaa	no

2tqdTCPQaa	well in this day and age its okay for girls to ask out guys....first you need to find out which one you like better...and the friend thing maybe you should save that one cause relationships can affect a friendship....i mean you could evidually date all of them...i mean its not like you are going to stay with them forever...i mean you could...but good luck|`|pnlNNyfdaa	whoever you know the most and who you are more alike to|`|dx9AZ16Paa	1st guy!!!<br>  <br>  Please awnser mine<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AnAkvRzxqlcuE.Evo0ixDXrsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090220220157AAs2zjP">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|l0oDymHYaa	Hi Dear<br>  <br>  You can Just be friends with all three and as times go by see with who you would be happier Love cannot be planned.|`|vyq7IOukaa	The mind is crazy like watch this your answer is this:  the first thing that pops in your head after this question is your answer. So which guy do you really like now?|`|1zfwLsQpaa	1 or 3<br>  <br>  like with 2 u would wanna risk it|`|ALDeXn6Uaa	this makes sense.|`|WI1Mz9YTaa	I would choose the third guy, because you seem to connect with him the most - at least from your very short description.<br>  <br>  Just choose the one you like to spend most time with. If you were asked right now with who you would like to be talking - choose this guy. You need to enjoy your time with him.<br>  <br>  Even if you're friend (i.e. second guy), don't worry about ruining the friendship - if you're really close, it will grow stronger.|`|Kvj5Upzcaa	just by what you typed out it seems guy 3 seems like a good guy for you. apparently you to talk a lot which is great for relationships. if youdon'tt think you should risk it with guy 2 thendon'tt go for it. If you 2 ever eventually go out and then go back to beingfriendss it will never be the same like it did before you 2 went out. guy 3 sounds good|`|tHFY2hg4aa	I would go with the guy that you have the most in common with. That would be the most interesting relationship. If you and the 3rd guy talk for a long time, chances are the two of you have allot in common.|`|bEsoWSRbaa	to help you i would date the one that you have been friends with you longer and the one that chases after you if you chase after guys they wont like you so i would choose Second Guy|`|GsRpZJX5aa	well dont risk the friend<br>  <br>  and im not really sure<br>  <br>  i dont tlk to guys and wait for  them to tlk to me lol<br>  soo may take a while|`|RsT2rifSaa	guy one there is nothing to worry about with him|`|jKph4peTaa	yes|`|CkABSeYmaa	i know this is hard but you should go with the one that respects you, doesnt criticize you, not annoying, and just makes you feel good to be around. i like the first, he sounds desent! hope that helps and best of luck!!|`|b426b7619bcffa194eb8ef2a5aa16cfcaa	I'd say that first-off, having three people you are pulling options from is a bad idea. It may be hard to break it to some of them, but you have to fugure out who is right for you at this point in time... you have to narrow it down because if you string these guys along while trying to make a decision, you're only going to end up getting whacked by your own predicament...<br>  <br>  They each sound like you have an equal relationship with them, but I'd say number 2 need some more investigating... if there is a reason why you're afraid to risk it, I suggest finding out EXACTLY what that reason is... perhaps it's because he is the one you want to choose, but you're afraid it won't work out and you might lose him. If that is the case, I suggest you give it a try- even if it doesn't work out as a couple situation... there is always the friendship to come back to... nothing should be so complicated that the friends card gets demolished.
0LvWiESWaa	He is a user. Unless you want to live the rest of your life with a guy who puts himself before anyone else (including kids), it's time to move on.

Make sure that you give him like a month.  You shouldn't be spending all your money on him.  I don't mean to be rude but it sounds like he isn't the man for you.  If you really love him make sure you do before you get married.  I would hate to see you divorsed because you stay in the same situation later on.

This is not normal.  This is not healthy.  This is not just.  This is not fair.  This is not equitable.  This is not the way that marriage should be.<br>  <br>  If you want to stay with him, you need to set better boundaries.  You need to tell him honestly that you can't afford to support him, that he needs to pull his own weight in the relationship, that he needs to work or to live more modestly.<br>  <br>  He is taking advantage of you because you are letting him take advantage of you.  If you do not address this now, the love is likely to steadily go stale, become moldly, end in resentment and bitterness.<br>  <br>  You should make an appointment with him, but not not tell him under any circumstance what the appointment will be about.  When the time for the appointment comes, express your difficulty about the situation, and share with him honestly and openly the problems you're having.  Ask him to change.  If he doesn't, end the relationship.  As he's investing nothing into the relationship, he may be waiting for you to end it, but getting as much out of you as he can before that happens.<br>  <br>  He may be playing a real life version of "How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days" without the romantic, loving ending.
JziZDQv3aa	Yes this is normal believe it or not. There have actually been scientific studies where they tested the response (with machines) of straight women to lesbian porn and only a very small percentage didn't react the same as they did to straight porn. Just because you look at this doesn't make you a lesbian or bisexual. Lesbian porn (and girl/girl kissing, etc) appeals to most women because it is more sensual than straight porn. I find in straight porn it becomes all about the guy- like no foreplay for the girl but he gets a bj and then has his way with whatever body part he sees fit while he gives her directions on how to please HIM better. Lesbian porn (most i've seen some raunchy stuff too) is more give and take and seems more soft and emotional which appeals to women. Personally, I'd much rather watch porn with two girls than a girl and a guy for that reason. However, the fact that you say that you're 80% sure you're straight leaves the possibility of you being bisexual. You're at least bi-curious which is not uncommon especially for teens (i'm not sure how old you are). You'll have to assess that situation for yourself and decide what you want to do with it. But as for the girl/girl kissing vids, that's normal straight or not although some people don't/wouldn't admit to doing it.|`|eXSy6IwMaa	noo.. coz im doing the same thing too..<br>  i dont know why. but i just feel like wanting to watch it..<br>  and, i am also about 80% or 70% sure that i am a straight girl..<br>  <br>  and i also, like to kiss girls too.. ahaha i dont know if its wierd..<br>  but, i think, this is just normal..<br>  coz, i have some girl friends who are like me and like you.. :D|`|7fdeTRhPaa	To be honest this isn't weird at all.<br>  Lol.|`|SNgcvrrXaa	Umm...im not sure thats normal. well at least i dont look that stuff up....|`|62meQdw0aa	I don't think it's that out of the ordinary.

I swear, people: count how many times people say "like."

And you have to understand he loves you and doesn't want you to be hurt, get hurt or sure doesn't want you having sex right now. Maybe you aren't but in his eyes he thinks you and your boyfriend are having sex and any parent would think that when you snuck out of the house. I think the best way to approach this and maybe something that might work is for both you and your boyfriend sit down and talk to your Dad at the same time together. Tell him how sorry you both are for doing something so stupid and wrong(even if you both don't feel it is stupid or wrong) and to please give both of you another chance to prove you will never do it again. Get your boyfriend to tell your Dad he really cares about you and would never want to hurt you or anyone in her family ever. It might take a little longer, but I think your Dad will come around after that. Just be patient with him because he is your Dad and loves you more than life. There is no love more genuine than a parents love if you have the right kind of parents.

I was 16 when I kissed someone but had first sex much later. It is one of the most beautiful memories of first kiss as you are of very tender age, passionate, you feel like loving , caring someone and a nice relationship happens. Only care a gal of your age should take is guys may have hidden agenda. They may believe more in physical relationship. So ensure that you have friendship for a long time which is stable and then only you can go for hug and kiss, but not before 16 as per my advice. Also no thinking of serious sex till you become at least 18 and it should result in legal relationship, no point in having sex without commitment for marriage.|`|FJswVeqbaa	first kiss...at 17<br>  first time had sex...at 19..to my boyfriend who i ahve been with for over three years and who has just become my husband<br>  advice...don't rush into anything let time do it's job

tXZTi73kaa	I know it's frustrating.  My girlfriend never takes my advice either... even after I proove time and time again that she should have listened to me.  <br>  At age 19, your girlfriend is still young and rebelious.  She's going to want to do things her own way.  The worse part is, as we get older, our views and opinions solidify, sometimes making us even more stubborn than before.<br>  I guess what I'm trying to say, and you'll hear time and again, she's a woman... they don't listen.  But it's definitely not a trust issue.  My advice, continue to prove to her that she would have been better off if she took your advice, then maybe one day she will realize...|`|GsRpZJX5aa	she needs to stop acting stupid<br>  and sounds like she shouldnt be in a relationship<br>  ask yourself how much you like her and if your willing to stick around<br>  man....she sounds too much and needs to sort her stuff out (attitude)|`|sYSEYHAzaa	Dude Trust is the Number one Factor In a Relationship...

I really don't see this getting any better & you don't want to be with someone like that.  I know the type girl you're talking about, I dated one myself.  She'd never listen to a word I say, but when ever her sister or mother would tell her the exact same thing I did she'd listen, irritated the hell out of me.  <br>  <br>  Edit:  By the way you'd be a fool to listen to metalhead, she's only siding with your girlfriend because she the exact same way. Of course she (metalhead) should be scared when she's been compromised by her parents, she shouldn't be lying to begin with.  If she can't listen to you now when it comes to simple little things, what makes you think she's going to listen to you later on in life if you're still with her many years from now?

You both will fight about everything.<br>  <br>  Also very EXPENSIVE for both sides.<br>  <br>  I don't think you really want that.|`|QI36SaLhaa	You can't what you going to say oh he's cheating on me if you could do that I bet a lot of people would file cases like that so there's pretty much nothing you can do and come on he has a girl just  divorce him and sorry I wasn't trying to act rude if it seemed like it|`|XJ2BW5p7aa	If you are legally separated (meaning papers filed and he no longer resides with you) he can be with other people. Just not marry them.<br>  So can you. You have no case.|`|QCYad4jUaa	Your relationship was broken prior to this other woman...it hurts, but you need to move on. You have no children with this guy and that's great!|`|4hsrILZbaa	Yes...but only do so if you truly have reason to. If you two were getting a divorce anyway, is it really worth destroying him in the process.<br>  <br>  I don't know the situation, but here are the straight legal facts.<br>  <br>  Infidelity is against the UCMJ (I think its uniform code of military conduct.) Normally it tends to pertain to one military person carrying on a relationship with another military person. That said, you can still get his butt in a lot of trouble for adultery. It's also grounds for you to file divorce papers on him. (Although if you don't have a prenup concerning this sort of thing there really isn't much you'll get OUT of the whole mess.)<br>  <br>  You are also entitled to a portion of his pay, depending on how long you've been married, if you legally separate before the divorce (which can take a while.) We're talking a solid chunk, a third of his pay BEFORE taxes. This should be enough to help you get on your own two feet and away from him<br>  <br>  Go to your family support center at your command. Navy is usually a fleet and family services building. Navy legal MAY help you, but don't hold your breath. Their loyal to the military guys, not the spouses. The ombudsman for your command could point you to the right direction, but don't tell him mor her WHY. (Commands protect their own, and if he/she knows you're out for vengeance...well...don't plan on much help.)<br>  <br>  Again, only do this if there is true REASON to. If you need use it as grounds for divorce on your part, or you need the portion of his pay to sustain during the divorce trial etc. Adultery doesn't need to be proven in order to recieve the pay, however.<br>  <br>  Best of luck and I'm sorry for your situation. Do what's in your heart, and now you know your rights.|`|2iWr2fkLaa	think practically what du want to achieve by this. you can act legally but will this help u reslove your life|`|NmsuIXd1aa	just get your divorce and leave it alone, looks like he already moved on why dont you.
ise05jjUaa	Get out & enjoy all the things you've been missing from being tied down all the time, enjoy what life has to offer & try to regain all that time that just passed you by on a relationship you wasted your time on.

tBaCFTtBaa	yup, ive had an orgasm from dry humping.. i think a lot of young couples start out that way.. in fact i think its kind of hot.  :)  i love when my boyfriend dry-humps me with his boxers on. good luck!|`|hE9HDEJWaa	Dear Monkeyman,<br>  <br>  you'd be surprised, but even skin-on-skin, or quote-unquote "dry humping" could be enough to cause a girl to have an orgasm, especially if she is very aroused with you! <br>  <br>  Women have multiple erogenous areas in their bodies, so if they are feeling aroused enough, almost anything could set them off ;)|`|4ltupRctaa	its not embarrassing, kinda cute!<br>  id have to say no to orgasm from dry sex, (thats what we called it)lol <br>  its hard enough for most girls to have them ever!! so i really doubt it.. & you will know when she does. its pretty hard to miss. (: <br>  you will understand one day.|`|UsJDUm1Haa	feels good. but probably not an orgasm|`|92373c108e6ba225edeef58fe8d9e131aa	The quick answer is yes, she can. Mine did, before we started having sex. And here's the thing man, I'd recommend just doing the deed and screw the social(or religious) stigmas that go with it. It sounds like you and your girlfriend have been together a while, and you obviously want to have sex mutually, so stop torturing yourselves and go for it. Its amazing and your both missing out on the prime of your lives. Just use protection, be gentle with her, and enjoy life while you still got it man.|`|AA11852144	I believe that I have had an orgasm many times from, uh, dry humping. You just have to hit the right spot I guess. And I applaud you for waiting to have sex. It takes a lot, trust me.|`|8cOstTBoaa	Nooo, its NOT a sin, u guys r still virgins, and O YES, you SOOOO CAN get an orgasm from that he he o lucky her :)|`|XX3JMtxXaa	yes she could get an orgasm been there done that.|`|0N0ExMMAaa	yes it is very possible for her to have one in that kind of act.|`|QKM3NLmaaa	god damn. just finger her.|`|xEwOAjJWaa	im guessing she isnt orgasming..<br>  <br>  it just isnt enough to turn anyone on that much|`|bwKZ8MWWaa	I'm sure it feels good to her, but orgasim, she probably hasn't had one yet|`|UCQ2yr5Vaa	Both the female and male can have an orgasm that way.<br>  It's pretty fun.
YWVCaIqmaa	Just let him do whatever he wants with your feet. He'll "lead" you on what to do. He might lick your toes and soles or lead you to give him a footjob. And hey, it's not weird at all.|`|HUUZgDppaa	its a common fetish a wierd one but common<br>  ive heard that you should let him suck on your toes, or like rub them in his face or something i dont know those kinda guys are ******* a little wierd|`|xhDdYnHTaa	Foot fetishes are very common.  He asked YOU what you can do to entertain his fetish?  It's his fetish!  Ask him what would turn him on.  From what I understand, people with foot fetishes may enjoy many different things involving feet.  Find out what he'd like and as long as you're cool with it, let him do it!|`|gmm43gfpaa	depends on you, and what your willing to do in that regaurds. If he allows it to dominate the flow of the relationship then he's not good for you, I however as a foot, shoe fetish expert know it can be a great way to tease him or please him. If it is too weird for you then your gonna have to allow him to fulfill it in his own way, but ask him in detail what he likes or wants to try, if your open minded and love him at least try, but don't let it dominate the relationship, see what happens, and good luck. A foot/shoe fetish is nicer and cleaner than most and a great way for a girl to het nice shoes ^^|`|INJSpV4haa	It's a very common fetish. It's the most prevalet fetish in the world (right after breasts) so there's a LOT of people out there with foot fetishes. It's harmless, and should not be a problem keeping your b/f happy, if you love him.<br>  <br>  Wear open-toed shoes a lot. Wear flip flops a lot. Go barefoot around him as much as possible. Let him see the soles of your feet when they are a little dirty. When you are watching TV together put your bare feet in his lap and ask him to massage and kiss them. Surprise him by rubbing your soles against his face and lips. Ask him to lick them.<br>  <br>  There's tons more things you can do with your feet to surprise him - use your imagination! ;)|`|DfrXRtl0aa	Let him do whatever he likes... he will get bored about it shortly and will leave it..|`|tU7JVMinaa	let him kiss your feet, massage them|`|NQU7VoR2aa	I suggest that you should be asking him that question. Ask what he would like you to do, get to learn and understand the things he likes and what interests him sexually. In situations like this its important simply to talk about it and listen to the other half has to say. After some good communication on the subject, youll have a good idea of what particular foot activities he likes. Just remember, it is also important that you are comfortable with getting involved with whatever it is that he likes, nothing good would come out of trying to please him with doing things you personally dont like.|`|IfaU7mAkaa	well i personally have a foot fetish. if you were my girlfriend, this is what i'd like:<br>  first you have to make your feet look pretty. go to a salon and get a pedicure. if you dont wanna spend money, then paint it yourself. i personally like red the best. also, make sure your feet are nice and clean.<br>  next, do what every foot fetishist would like. let him give you a nice foot massage. both of you will enjoy it. he'll get to touch your wonderful feet and you'll get the massage.<br>  if you wanna go farther, let him lick your feet and suck on your toes. i love doing that. he'll definitely like it. it'll feel good for you too.<br>  finally, if you wanna get completely sexual about it, give him a footjob. some girls say its hard at first, but it gets easier with practice. i dont know what you wanna practice on, but try a dildo or banana or something. you dont have to practice. just go to this website and read it. <a href="http://www.ehow.com/how_2267552_give-foot-job.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.ehow.com/how_2267552_give-foo...</a><br>  <br>  thats all i would like. just ask him if he wants anything else.|`|tXZTi73kaa	Let him play with your feet!!!  You might like it!<br>  Then ask him to entertain one of your fetish/fantasies!!!  <br>  It brings a sexual relationship to a whole new level.  Personally, I can't get my girlfriend of three years to try anything new, and it really bothers me... it destroys my sex drive.  You wouldn't want to do that to your man would you??|`|KsKmomtxaa	a footjob i guess|`|ylHrqNvkaa	i agree<br>  give him a footjob and let him play/suck of ur toes?

It worx!|`|0mXQODsIaa	its up to you. it does sound like hes ditching you though. but it is your choice. i hope it all works out for you. i would do anything to spend time with my girlfriend if i had one. lol. i was going out with somoene but she cheated on me. lolz it sucked|`|OJAC44eTaa	yes, he's ditching you... he's only thinking of his own needs and wants. don't take i personally, he's just a jerk.<br>  don't waste your time on him, move on!|`|mLsP2M0taa	Dont yet. Dont be over sensitive about it, he must have a reason. Talk to him, spend a little bit more time with him. You might regret breaking up with him because of 1 simple thing|`|gWu693giaa	You were going out with this guy for a week.<br>  If he was serious about getting to know you better he would have found a way to hang with you this weekend. It's not like you two were in a long,loving,complex relationship. It was one week. So yes its ok to dump him if you want to. And don't take him back if he tries to sweet talk you so he knows that he messed up and that you are over him because he was a moron. <br>  <br>  Start flirting with one of his friends. Your young. Enjoy the dating world now because it sucks more and more as you get older.|`|pZxeStPpaa	i don't see a reason for u to break up with him. Just because he ditched you does not mean he has no feelings for you. Im sure there is something more to this. Yeah its awful how he can go to this party and not hang out with you, but you should talk to him about and see if he really went or was just flaking it. Talk to him before you decide.|`|6AtmwCMvaa	maybe he just wanted to spend some time by himself or with a  couple of friends. try to talk to him the next time you see him and ask him what he did right after you stopped talking to him.|`|nXloT3Iiaa	Yes i believe you should break up with him. He couldn't do anything with you yet he took the time to go to a party. Move on before your heart gets broke.|`|ZD3f6zxnaa	You guys just dated for a week and he's already lying to you...then he will continue doing that in the future..break it off before you get too involve and get too hurt..|`|8FbOtXAXaa	It looks that way, but you guys have only been dating for a week so I would just move on.|`|AAoV6zohaa	Yep he's a ditcher lol He's stupid break it off with him girl i don't even know you but i know you deserve better lol|`|aUIsuOEaaa	it's your choice in the end but i would end it.|`|vsOHewLMaa	break up with him...he is a jerk....and he is obviously not serious abou tyou...he is an ***...forget it man...u deserve better|`|YzDHh28Haa	just ask for his explination first..
8FbOtXAXaa	Actually, I think it would be easier since it is a long distance relationship. I mean if you had to see him everyday and try to break up with him that would be really hard. If you don't really see this being a forever thing and you don't feel like you two are right for each other then you need to tell him sooner than later. I know it will be tough but you need to just tell him everything that you wrote on here and explain to him your reasons. I hope everything will work out in the end for you.
i6zSUjVoaa	It doesn't sound like you two are close enough yet to start asking about that, You could be less specific, by simply asking if he is single, or if there are any girls he is interested in. If you two actually start going out or anything and she is still there, then you should ask him.|`|dHF0l6bLaa	ok 1, dnt ask him cause knowlege is pain...<br>  2: dnt play detective cause 9/10 times u will get it wrong<br>  3:girls can be awfully friendly, my chick mates always say they luv me<br>  <br>  just take his word for it..... for now ne waz|`|xEwOAjJWaa	move on... hes playing you.<br>  <br>  he sounds sleazy to me.

HtApr3l7aa	Sounds like you are both hurting right now, and maybe some time apart to think about things might be a good thing.<br>  Sounds like he needs to think about things, you both need to redefine your relationship. Now is definitely time to think, and it is probably quite scarey for you at the moment cause, you don't know if he means that you are both really over or not. <br>  Unfortunately you will have to wait, at least a day or even a week.<br>  Maybe he needs to miss you to realise that you mean more to him than to walk out like that.<br>  There are alot of questions and it is the time where you need to wait for the dust to settle before you will see clearly.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps. <br>  I don't think you can just fix this yourself.|`|fyKFnxCnaa	When men lose their jobs, they can go kinda crazy...<br>  <br>  I know, I have been through it 3 times.<br>  <br>  They feel useless and can get depressed and angry.<br>  <br>  The most sensible solution for the both of you is counseling.<br>  <br>  I think if you both actually want to work it out - that might be the best step.<br>  <br>  If it does work and you do work through it...<br>  <br>  Girl, you could do a few things...<br>  <br>  Try to go out with him more often.  Even suggest somewhere you can go... AND come onto the man from time to time!<br>  <br>  Let him know you want him too!|`|s8yCwPedaa	You guys need to turn this whole thing around.<br>  #1 Don't assume how he is going to react, which in turn prevents you from being interactive.<br>  #2 He seems to be under stress, not your fault...try to help as best you can.<br>  #3 You guys need to talk about all that is between you right now. And I do mean TALK, not fight.<br>  Seek help if you really love each other, you'll get past this.|`|ZzEAc5ecaa	you miss the point he was telling you  MORE SEX  and you say no. to him.. i would leave you as well.. i love you .. just is not sex  .. get it now .. ...how many times has he ask you for .. it and you say no .. then want him to go out with you and again you say no.. ..he had no other way of telling you thats it .. ... i would say ..

It is nothing to be angry about.|`|831e735ba92bb0dfd3b16be0d4995ccfaa	You know, what she did before you married her is none of your business especially so much as to get sore about.

I know how you feel & yes I would feel the same way.  I think its because someone who's this close to you, your boss knows probably just as much as you do about something personal in your life & what your wife likes in bed.  Its a hard feeling to get over!  By the way I hate to say this, but she's an idiot for saying it was nothing serious.  Obviously to her sex isn't a serious thing & it should be.  You can always forgive, but you'll never forget & I don't think this is something that is going to go away on its own without professional help.  To me I would feel as though my boss struck so close to home, its weird how it works had he been someone you never knew you would have had no problems with hit, but like I said he hit so close to home & in a way its bad enough he's your boss now it just feels like a slap in the face that he has something else over you.  You're either going to forgive her & get help, or end up leaving because every time you fight you're going to throw this at her.

08IaFoRgaa	Yes! Without a doubt this is abuse! According to Wikipedia, "Abuse refers to the use or treatment of something (a person, item, substance, concept, or vocabulary) that is harmful. It can be classed by the target of abuse or the type of abuse." One such classification is "spousal abuse (or domestic violence): Abuse, usually physical, or psychological abuse, directed at ones domestic partner."  No one has the right to put their hands on you without your approval but not all abuse is physical.  Sometimes the worst abuse is the verbal abuse and psychological abuse because of what it does to ones self-esteem.  The fact that you are scared is your mind telling you that you are in danger.  It's called the "fight or flight" reaction, and in this case you were obviously  feeling over powered and were wanting to flee to a safer and more secure environment.  There is a hot-line for women who have been abused.  The national number is 1-800-799-7233. I carry it in my phone.  The local number for my area is 701-293-7273.    Do not be afraid to call them.  Do not wait!  Your husband needs help too, but right now you must think about your own personal safety.  Call them right now!

Nobody is to lay any hand on anybody else.  Call your local human services office and they can get you the info you need... whether you are the abuser or the abused.|`|IDrA6gMxaa	Yes, it os considered abuse and if this is not the first time you should inform the authorities. If it is the first time, in my opinion you should just talk to you husband and ask him not to do it again. I am sure he will regret his actions.|`|eXwnWqROaa	this is abuse and this could possibly be the beginning of something bad.......<br>  <br>  call the samaritans if you live in the uk they offer lots of help and advice|`|SCg3kDz2aa	His above behavior may be an adequate response, but also a serious abuse, depending on the previous actions you two did.|`|AA11969451	Go to this site ... <a href="http://www.ndvh.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.ndvh.org/</a> or call 1-800-799-7233 (safe)

s7PxM001aa	You have no control over what other guys do to you, it's not your fault<br>  he's the one being immature :o<br>  <br>  He's jealous and wants you to himself|`|mBXu5G5saa	do you love this guy, because from reading this> your tone says that you do not! If your "Boyfriend" says that he does not like it when guys flirt with you, or you flirt with them,,whichever,, i mean there is nothing wrong with that.. you should be happy that he is saying this to you,, because others guys would be like okay other guys are flirting with her, so forget that i am going to look for girls to flirt with too, then it then into cheating!!!!!|`|n7hezV5aaa	Well I think you're both wrong here. It's wrong of him to say that he doesn't care about you. He's either trying to hurt your feelings or you've just put him off by allowing the flirting. I know that it feels nice to know that other people find you attractive, but how would you like it if the shoe was on the other foot? If he had some gorgeous girls flirting with him and he obviously liked it, talked to them all the time and turned to you and told you to shut up and deal with it? Some people feel secure enough in their relationship to not mind it when other people flirt with their significant-other and others DO mind it very much so. It sound like your guy falls in the second category. It all depends on how much you care about keeping this relationship, because this could be a serious conflict, I'm afraid. I mean are you so determined to pursue your happiness by maintining contact with guys who obviously flirt with you and possibly want more that you would sacrifice your boyfriend's happiness and relationship by doing so?|`|AA10910187	I'm not an expert on this but I think that you have the right to talk to any one you want to.  And if he thinks that you cant then hes not worth it.  He was easily put there he can be easily removed:) and you shouldn't have to give up your guy friends for him.|`|MX1shAbcaa	Well tell him what you said... Tell him well there asre other people in my life, it's not like i flirt back with them, i'm not doing anything wrong, and if you can't repect that i have other friends then leave.<br>  That's what i would say <br>  ~Will|`|AA11116901	all my relationships have been way open... he's just paranoid tell him to come off it or leave.|`|jxpa713daa	lots of guys like to know that their your one and only<br>  but alot of guys will let you talk to whoever the hell you want lmao<br>  just make sure you dont say anything wrong.... cause if you start flirting back then your in the wrong<br>  if your just talking then not only is he in the wrong but these guys are in the wrong for trying to flirt in the first place|`|9s5duQmFaa	There is nothing wrong with you having guy friends BUT what if he had a lot of girls who flirted with him...put yourself in his picture.Maybe you should talk to some of the people who flirt with you alot.|`|79aZQf4qaa	wow trust me that makes alot of guys jealous. it made me jealous and i dont care anymore trust me. he thinks he is all you need. if not then you can just go to hell|`|y5raXzHCaa	Tell him you will show his back history to his new grilfriend.|`|H3WfJY5Eaa	Well, dose he have a reason to be jealous?  I admit it is pretty immature, but I don't know his side of the story, but from what you present to us, yes his acting immature.  But we're guys, we have a fear, a deadly fear that someone is going to take the woman we care about away from us.  I know I do, my mother cheated on my father and destroyed my home.  And ever since then I've always been a bit jealous, I've learned to become rational about it.  But sometimes I can't be thats when I usually tell my partner why I'm feeling jealous.  <br>  <br>  If you don't want to stop talking with your friend(s) thats fine, your in the right.  But if you care about him, maybe try setting up boundaries.  <br>  <br>  No calls after a certain time.  Turn your phone off, when you and him are spending time together (that really pisses me off).  I always turn my phone off, **** that I'm with my bunny.<br>  <br>  Stuff like that.  If you don't want to do anything like that, then good luck I suggest try and work it out, but don't sacrifice everything, he has to learn to trust you.<br>  <br>  *** Well, if your male friend is giving you that kind of attention, seems like your male friend LIKES you... I'd be jealous too.  I'd actually be hurt... Because yeah its your friend, but his trying to steal you away from me and I can't do anything about it.

You friend should fight for her rights, she has not lost yet.|`|gCdP3NJGaa	He's trying to pull a fast one on her. It sounds like this will end up in court to decide who the kids live with, and they will always decide what is the children's best interest. Unless she has some kind of disorder that would make her unable/incapable of looking after them or was in some way proved to be an unfit mother ( drugs/alcohol abuse, for example) the courts still favour the mother as main carer- the most he could hope for would be shared custody. As for the house, the person who's name is on the rent book would usually stay there and if its in joint names, again, most likely the mother as the main carer- the courts wouldn't make the children loose their home. <br>  CAB can tell her her rights|`|ATyHswTTaa	humm who name is the house in?? is it hers or his?? if its both then going have to go to court but the mother normally gets the house due to haven the kids.. if its in her name alone, then i would say go get a barring order quickly and he has to leave the house no matter what.. he is threaten her of homeless and abusive so tell the court she is scared for her and the kids safety and she gets her barring order simple as.. but if its in his name then just ask the council for another house saying going be homeless with ur kids and see what they can do for her.. what i suggest is ur friend start keepin a diary and write down everything that goes on with her and the huby and also start recording her own tapes as i bet hes all bluff anyways.. so its shown how he puttin her down and haven her living in fear will have any judge comin down hard on this a-hole... goodluck|`|m81dfyOYaa	He'll have to do better than that.

So, when he thought of you he thought it would be a good idea to go and find you, as that seems a good idea at the time, then when an argument started he's also going to think he's done nothing wrong because he was drunk. He'll probably realize what he did and apologize.|`|SR1FN2nqaa	i dont think he should of showed up drunk. thats desrespectful. you may want to re evaluate if you want to see him anymore if he has a drinking problem.
b4c080d0f4c39aa94fde4b1f35a009fbaa	Married in India according to Indian Matrimonial laws (Hindu Marriage Act,1954 for Hindu Marriage amongst Hindus) means only the India courts will have jurisdiction to adjudicate for any dispute amongst the parties.<br>  Filing for divorce in USA may not be possible as the US courts are firstly not bound by the Hindu Marriage Act,1954,secondly in your case the provision of divorce is possible if you both have been residing for a provided (few months or years as the case may be) period of time in the State where you proceed for the divorce proceedings,thirdly even if you succeed in getting divorce from US court that may not be legally recognised in India if that decree of divorce issued by US court fails to be based on the provision of section 13 of the Civil Procedure Code & various Principles formulated by the Supreme Court of India on this issue. In such case the whole exercise of obtaining the decree of divorce from US court goes waist as again you have to obtain a decree of divorce from Indian court which is possible when you are here in India.<br>  As far contested or uncontested divorce is concerned no doubt the uncontested divorce is taking lesser time but it depends on your husband to do so or not. As far in India divorce by mutual consent takes six months time for obtaining the decree of divorce but for that this has to be filled jointly by you both & both your presence will be required for this in India for this form of divorce otherwise if you file for unilateral divorce which your husband fails to contest will require your presence only during the time of recording of your evidence/statement on oath, otherwise you can give power of attorney to someone to attend & get the court proceeding in the case carried on your behalf.<br>   As far financial resources are concerned that you require both in India or outside as no lawyer will provide you free legal services in the court case even if you have been here in 'Yahoo answers' provided this legal service free of cost|`|K2QwEM4raa	I really can't ans2r  like the previous poster because he knows much more about your situation than I, but I will add that some states will help you fill out divorce papers in the US and in my state I was able to do it myself sense it was not contested.

oIVtN4W4aa	There is a possibility that she likes you but don't be offended if she doesn't. One thing is for sure, if she doesn't know that you like her, she will not make the first move. Girls are definitely attracted to guys who are confident so try to drop the shy part. At the same time, don't be too cocky or "compete" for her attention. <br>  <br>  Try looking for ways to reach her outside of the classroom. Phone calls, IMs, etc are good but what you really need is to spend time with her. She will get the idea, don't be shy.
BptkAyrNaa	No. Whether or not you decide to have sex with your partner before marriage is your choice; there is no right or wrong (as long as you are a consenting adult and your partner is not blood-related).<br>  <br>  In my opinion, it's not the people who purposely have sex before marriage that have any regrets (though some do); it's the people who purposely stay virgins until they marry, then have sexual incompatibility with their spouses that regret it. <br>  <br>  I have posted answers to similar questions. If you want to read them, just click on the cat on the left.|`|gjtdLPIYaa	i think it is wrong. because if people are going to shack up and do all that then what's the point of them getting married or even if they don't want to get married.people that do this obviously don't have enough self esteem, or self confidence for them selves.lot's of people seriously lack morals these days which is sad. with all the disease out there don't people know you can still get std even if you were a condom disgusting . i choose to wait till marriage.|`|znvx2NMQaa	with the declining number of cupplees marrying due to the increasing rate of divource if people stoped or didnt have sex before marragge the human race would die out.<br>  <br>  this no sex before marrage is so yesterday.|`|djUMvICoaa	I don't think there is anything wrong with sex before marriage.  I think it may not be right if you are not in a committed relationship.  Sex should involve some deep feelings/meanings and when you throw them away you miss the important part of what sex is about.  When you have them and you partner doesn't, they are off after the conquest, you are going to be deeply hurt.<br>  I was going to say that for two adults it's o.k. but by the time I got through the last answer I don't think it is right.  Again, without the deep feelings/meanings you are detached from something, you are using sex as a drug to medicate something else.  It's not to say that a lot of people haven't done it, but what are they really doing, just going through the motions.   And then they have trouble in a relationship because they are used to having sex for recreation and can't attach the proper feelings towards it which is  why there may be so many divorces.  In a deep love you value being with your partner, that the security involved is your connection.  On a superficial love, you value your partner as a sex goddess, the sex wears off and you find a new goddess. You can't forget about the passing of STD's either, more likely to get from casual sex.  I hope that makes sense.|`|OKIw5kcLaa	dont let this kind of thinking get to you because satan is trying to convice you to do it because he knows that he wants to spirtiualy distroy you. sex should be used in marriage because we have been given the power to give life to new childern and its from god|`|heAH8iFoaa	in my opinion we shouldn't be engaged in sex before marriage, especially with an increase in the spread of aids|`|kgIccwR0aa	if u thinking of enjoying the moment no strings attached then your conscious wont get in the way.but if u thinking on self worth u will feel bad after doing it.|`|U3HdbzGKaa	The Bible clearly condemns them and they're immoral.

4j3CwEnLaa	dude. if u want her to love u, just tell her that u love her .  it will be left to her on  what she gota do .dont feel scared. just do it. . thats wat i did  to my past 56 ex girl friends.|`|NmG1FFSRaa	u dnt make a girl luv u, u earn her luv by  being a great guy being kind, funny, honest, and show u luv her|`|KG6E8br0aa	yes i've tried this and it worked give her something she will like ( surprise ) at a random time :D girls love that because they dont expect you to do that :D believe me
mbIbtkUEaa	dump the weirdo<br>  wth?|`|n0w7gISyaa	im sorry to say this but they say that the truth comes out when you're drunk|`|SR1FN2nqaa	he sounds abusive and they say a drunk mans words are a sober mans thoughts. either way id think twice about continueing a relationship with him . it doesnt sounds like he is a very good person to be with.|`|lTsONvwQaa	You both seem pretty crazy|`|AA10438993	what a jerk! ditch him.
rSaD6d8Gaa	If your daughters chart is afflicted by moon she has to chant mantras of moon,Fill a silver glass full of water before going to sleep and drink it the next day.Donate white clothes.Wear white clothes.Use white blankets and keep white kerchief always.|`|TzlNjkCQaa	I would love to guide your daughter, honestly I would.  Unfortunately, I'm not allowed withing 200 yards of her, her school or any of her friends until my parole officer gives the thumbs up.|`|d30f07a15879f4c7bb74b100b34135afaa	Do you really believe the moon and stars can help your daughter or is this just a hoax?  If you are sincere, see an astrologer I guess, or if that fails, turn to your religion.  See your pastor/priest.  He may be able to convince you that the moon and stars have nothing to do with your actions.  They may affect your moods, but substantially, you are in charge of your body and what it says or does (with God's help).  <br>  <br>  Good luck.
z0wy76Ewaa	the reason why ure moving out is that ure financially ready.....its dumb to ask ur parents to help u wit rents and bills n stuff...obviously ure not ready to move out|`|npWGkuwnaa	If you can't afford it , don't move out! No it's not normal!|`|AA10776535	Your not ready to move out...or get a few roommates.|`|AA10075228	You do not tell us what your age is.  If you cannot pay your own way, you should not go anywhere - as long as your parents allow you to stay, you should until you have the income you need to get by on your own, which is difficult in today's world.  Everything always looks so easy, but just try paying all the bills yourself and you will quickly change your attitude and your mind. It is not worth it.|`|j3YRIJafaa	i wouldnt - you cant afford it and you cant lean on your parents all the time because maybe when you lean on them this once for support you will do it again and again when your in a sticky spot. just stay for a little while longer and get your financial side sorted and secure before doing anything big like that - hope this helps good luck|`|vFFumojhaa	i would wait till you have the job that makes it so you can afford it because part of moving out is gaining independence so its really not a great idea sorry hope i helped @ least a little:) hope things work out

That is going too far and you should tell him to stop or just pull away.  You start kissing like that and things will get way too out of hand.  You will  have him around longer if you set some limits.|`|z0wy76Ewaa	some people would tease their partners tongue wit their own....but since i dun really like to put my tongue on my bf"s mouth.....i just suck his tongue n he seems to like it|`|uSPAw89faa	Only if you feel comfortable doing that.  I adore teasing his tongue with mine, sucking his tongue and bottom lip.  Kissing  is sensual and very intimate sign of affection; the most intense before the act itself.  so, do what is comfortable.  Don't rush it. let him lead.
Likst1Mxaa	find a line from one of his/your fave songs and then write 'love you with all my heart xxxx' or something like that :)|`|AcPq4Qd8aa	Anything to do with sex, men love it! They are so easy. lol|`|7c36320ff77a3d6c6df428c5b184e905aa	Yeh I quite like the sex slave answer, although it might give off slightly the wrong message.  Ah, what the hell, go with it.  And tell him you've done some shopping.|`|8nlZMygSaa	you owe me a nights sleep cause i can't stop thinking about you|`|pre1k4Pqaa	since its love ask him if you where making him a night to remmber and youll be so reddy what would hes reply be ???? if its a yess tell him youll let him know where and when to stand by.|`|NmA0nJKHaa	Its all in actions, make him dinner instead|`|euYz39Epaa	"i love you, you mean the world to me, i mean it"<br>  and wen u say it look him straight and deep in the eyes<br>  do something romantic|`|mYkinxsQaa	"Tonight, I am your sex slave"
pLkeooJ1aa	You need to tell someone. I know that's a horrible thing to hear, but if you bottle this up, let it go, or whatever it's only going to get worse. <br>  <br>  You WERE violated. You were not completely coherent, and he knew that. He took advantage of you, and he's not a friend.<br>  <br>  If you both actually had sex, without given consent (even if you weren't able to say no, not saying yes is the same) it constitutes rape. Just because you drink and smoke and are passed out on a bed doesn't equal free and easy sex. What he did was wrong, and he needs to be punished for it.<br>  <br>  If you feel uncomfortable telling your parents, the next person on your list of contacts ought to be a school counselor. They can tell you your options (make sure that you clarify your conversation is a private matter first). If that makes you uncomfortable, go to your local police station. Anonymity is no big deal with that, even as a minor.<br>  <br>  None of it is your fault. Seek help as soon as you can, don't just let it go!|`|6HyDE0i9aa	You were drunk and high at the same time, so you were vulnerable. Even though your friend was pretty sober, he saw that you were drunk and high, and he took advantage of you because of that. I would stay away from him and best of all. KNOW YOUR LIMITS!!!
NQFV2AdZaa	Does he know about your past abusive relationship? If he does know then maybe that's why he's taking things slow and steady, to consider your feelings. He's shy too, so unless you ask him where you stand, he may not speak about it. However it does seem like you two are dating, good luck with it.
gCdP3NJGaa	It sounds like he is as confused as you are. Try talking to him, but in my opinion if he can't give you a straight answer it's most likely you would be wasting your time to wait around for him|`|Likst1Mxaa	Yeah, you are seeing each other... just cozz he hans't officially asked you out, doesn't mean you're not together.|`|940aeb175b0facf00b53d83108c83e62aa	Guy never say he loves.. he is waiting for love remarks first from girl and you mentioned he is very shy... so it is hard that he provide you any clue.. I think it is a very brave step took by him to ask you again for date...<br>  in short he loves you...but he is waiting for your response first.<br>  wish you best of luck|`|JetaJF6Maa	if u feel that the guy is nice nd u have faith in him then go nd clear ur doubts nd be litle frank to him ....<br>  go carry on wid it as it can be of ur likings ....|`|eB7MFOW2aa	forget about th past <br>  if you feel good then <br>  its great

Dump him.|`|WYPEG8l7aa	There wouldn't be 6 billion people on this planet if not for us being like that haha|`|AA12050428	It used to be said that Frenchman didn't do this they only had eyes for the woman they were with. If that is true I can see why they are renowned as the World's best lovers. I do not have first hand experience though,   unfortunately. It certainly makes you feel very special when men do only have eyes for you.|`|GaHkxtU9aa	Men are dogs when they cant control themselves. Animal instinct takes over. <br>  <br>  Otherwise men should behave like gentlemen when they are with a lady. Especially committed men who have committed their hearts to a lady.<br>  <br>  If it gets you down - do the same thing to him - start looking at other guys and commenting how smart looking or attractive they are. One thing that pisses a guy off and gets him jealous - is when his own girl is 'flirting'. <br>  <br>  And then when he is pissed off, lay down the law.|`|AA11108018	We are not like dogs..

eB7MFOW2aa	if you feel that a girl likes you <br>  propose her<br>  and then ask her that whether she liked you before<br>  <br>  or<br>  ask your close female friend to ask her
QPVEL0NLaa	she's a player. Dump her butt now!!|`|djUMvICoaa	I think you both are equally at fault but that's because of immaturity.  She is having fun with someone on line and can be playing with fire.  You are going in and reading her postings, not a good thing to do. You just invaded her privacy.  People in love don't do either of the things you two are doing.  Like I said, immaturity.|`|lAnaNjd1aa	I can completley understand why this bothers you.. it'd bother me too! I think you need to confront her about it, you shouldnt be calling another guy pet names or saying I love you when your in a relationship with someone else! If my boyfriend was doing this then I would see it as cheating. Ask her why she still feels the need to keep in conact with this guy and why she calls him innapropriate names like "baby", if she refuses to change then i'd get rid and find someone who can give me 100%. Good luck <br>  x|`|BY2pyHv8aa	AWW.that means you love her ........................................... it isn't  your fault its that guys fault GET RID OF HIM SOMEHOW,good luck with that girl|`|eB7MFOW2aa	i think so hat she likes him but there's something in you due to which she is not leaving you or may be she is two-timing|`|sfhyZlMOaa	well..i say a "love yah!" to my friends in my comments,but i don't say it to boys..and "i miss you" is ok,but "baby" is definitely NOT ok!<br>  <br>  Well,you are too blind to not see that she is already cheating on you...tell her your feelings,tell her that she and that guys' comment on each other don't give you a good feeling..and you're not overreacting..its your right to react on those things...<br>  <br>  And if she still do that after you talked to her..then tell her you need space...maybe if she really loves you..she'll stop commenting on him and try to get you back
CyHJlCZXaa	You're getting to the age now where your piers get over the childish week long relationships and asking each other out over msn. Just remember that you don't need to be in a relationship just for the sake of it! Be in a relationship because you like the person you're with.|`|983a3a8efe5cb244e13ce535ec318f27aa	Chances are you may simply be too good-looking and guys are intimidated because they think they'll have no chance with you. You might like to try making yourself a bit more accessible and forthcoming, and be the one to make the first move on a guy if you like him. There is nothing stopping girls these days being forthright about what they want and then going for it, so don't wait for them but rather take it into your own hands :)|`|lAnaNjd1aa	In an all girls school it must be tough to have regular contact with boys! Try not to see it as being your fault why you havent had a boyfriend or your first kiss.. try and spend time around people your own age group out of school hours, your sure to meet someone eventually. Trust me love crops up when you least expect it, just try and chill out and you'll seem less needy to boys.. relax you only in year 9! youve got pleanty of time to meet boys! :) good luck x|`|gkItz4i9aa	maybee you should ask them out..i know it sounds like heapss scaryy.. but hey if you don't try you'll never know..<br>  <br>  <br>  i asked my boyfriend out and hes in year 12 and im in year 9..<br>  <br>  <br>  still..be confident..its the key to sexiness...(i think i spelt that wrongg..!) lol<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  goodluck..ox|`|IoHD4D7Zaa	ITS COZ UR IN AN ALL GIRLS SCHOOL!!!!!<br>  <br>  IVE BEEN THERE TRUST ME.<br>  <br>  LEAVE NOW!!!!!!!!!!!

KiI4qNQRaa	I kinda had the same problem myself.<br>  I could be playing and playing and look up and the clock and it reads three in the morning. I dont know how easy it is with him but im really into sports and ever since soccer started up again and still playing basketball,,, i havnt played xbox in a good 1/2 a month.<br>  before all this i was playing 4-6 hours a day some times more. Just ask him to join a group event. ( dunno how old you are, but thats what us teens do) ';)<br>  <br>  Tell him you care too much for him to sit there and accomplish nothing.|`|0tU4jkS9aa	tellh im you'll stop coming over for good if he doesnt get his butt off his video games. tell him your getting bored watching him play his x-box, and that you have better things to do.<br>  <br>  can someone answer my open questions??|`|8740c9d03300d2d76f91ceaf7a9ffc93aa	Takes a hammer to it!|`|i8FLbJ4Caa	This is a serious answer, the only thing that will get him off the x-box is if you get him off. Seriously the only way is for you to get naked. But since you guys are friends I'm guessing that you don't want to do that.|`|Ho4mZ6mSaa	Let him know that his Gameboy is effecting the relationship between you two, If he cares he will cut down on the time wasted with the gameboy and spend more time with you... Simple, yes.|`|skxhE5owaa	to be fair xbox > people<br>  :D<br>  ummm, I dunno, you could be sneaky and replace the batteries in his controller with dead ones ^_^|`|Vi0S0xbuaa	I was in my friends room when his roommate was playing xbox live--he doesn't even look up so i know what it is like. He never even really looked at me until I was trying to unplug my laptop from the power strip and all the power in the room went out cause I had hit the main power switch off.  He jumped up and was about to kill me. However his big screen tv and his xbox were plugged in two different places so he just waited for the television to come back on. After a million "I'm sorry's" from me and like three "It's ok's" from him I ran out of that room because I knew my life would've been over if the xbox's electricity went out too. <br>  <br>  With that being said you can just take the remote and turn off the tv (while still keeping the xbox on) but beware for some that's enough to get them enraged. Look on the bright side--at least you got his attention and now you have a platform to yell at him to spend some of his life with you instead of his xbox.|`|upaE1vKMaa	A good roundhouse kick to the face :) Just kidding of course. What usually works with my boys is bringing some snacks to steal their attention and then I convince them to do something fun. Dangle your keys and challenge him to a race to the car, etc|`|YSvARlWqaa	I am with account 30,   get naked or.....go get a 360 and a better game than he has and play it next to him and he will want to join. OR you can just wait a few years till he grows up.
x4RnrSOMaa	Wow very long question!<br>  You are soooo lucky to have a monkey how cute!<br>  Anyway, I think you and your mum should move to the basement because there are more of you and you have to do more thing and also because she has a baby she can't keep going up and down the stairs. Also, (I have a feeling this is going to be a very long answer :P) for the sake of the baby being healthy it need to be in a more suitable environment with nothing to put the baby in danger... I think it would be perfect if they could a room to themselves because it means your sister wont have to worry of her baby if she can she can easily go to it and knows where it is and even though you have cleaned the basement it still may not be a good place for the baby it need to be light and airy. Oh and the animals can't easily get to the baby if it's in a room whereas in the basement they could easily get to it<br>  <br>  I hope I helped...<br>  Not as long as I thought it would be  :P|`|3389acc7fbe9dbba8ee2124559e992ecaa	try out both once. you have a monkey! i wish i had too .  <br>  <br>  all the best.<br>  <br>  pls answer mine <br>  <a href="http://uk.answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=A0WTcZQi_59JZgYAIQwgBgx.;_ylv=3?qid=20090221021901AAPBdTF">http://uk.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...</a>|`|RKMxAKDIaa	i would show her this question and say that for the safty of the baby she should go in the rooms above the basement and the monkey is better off in the basement because she will be out of the way of the baby ! omg a monkey how cool What kind is it ? i live in the uk so i deffo cant have a monkey !! but i do have 2 ferrets Ferri and Mira i love them lol|`|MlCWsBcwaa	Well, I think the three of you should talk about this.  Ultimately, it is up to your mom to decide (seeing as it is her house).  I kind of agree that you should move in there as planned originally, from what you have said, but that is just my opinion.  Your sister is there for a year only, but you have pets and are home schooled, and you are probably going to be there for a fair bit longer than your sister and you need a place for school away from the baby, and the basement would give you that.   I hope your mom makes the right decision in the end and this year goes well for you all.  Good luck.|`|uzZuwtgXaa	Obviously you should have space as you live there already, the problem is having room for the baby, a baby needs a clean room and bay comes with lots of extra's such as toys, nappy buggy etc. ferrets should not be in the house anyway they smell and are unhygenic, can't you get a hutch in your garden? As for the monkey please be very careful with the baby they can turn nasty if jealous, it has been known for monkey's to rip baby's faces off and this is a fact. Any animal for that matter is unpredictable. it is very kind to let your sister in your home but the baby's needs must come first and its only for a year anyway.
OHs8yJiOaa	It depends on the degree, type, and duration of abuse and how seriously you expect to pursue the relation. It also partly depends on if this is someone you knew prior to dating or if you've just known each other 8 weeks, period. The big question is *why* you would be telling him about it now.<br>  <br>  It would probably be weird to blurt out out of the blue. It may also be the kind of thing that's too "intense" for someone early on, especially if you didn't know each other before. If it's something that's come up indirectly in conversation more than once or that you find directly hindering things for some reason, it might be appropriate to briefly reference it, and give him the opportunity to follow up then or leave it for another time, etc. Sometimes it can be good to essentially "ease into" that sort of thing over time rather than lay a spill your guts thing on someone all at once. 8 weeks into a relation is also a time when you should be generally focused on building with someone without necessarily getting *too* in-depth with them.<br>  <br>  I'd personally suggest focusing on laying a general trust foundation for awhile longer, and if it comes up at some point, try and make sure you're doing it for the right relevant reasons as opposed to expecting someone to play therapist for you, etc. Your priority is to build with someone now and moving forward, and unless there's a clear reason why you'd share that or any number of things now, I'd hold off for the time being.|`|ilbMPWmzaa	its whenever u feel comfortable and trust him enough|`|3jqcLj7Saa	sexual abuse is a very common problem. First off I want to tell you your not alone in this situation and I am sorry for your hurt. Yes 8 weeks seems to be too soon unless you have a problem enjoying sex. If this is the case tell him your not ready for that step and please, please get some help. So often the person who has been abused feels like she has done something wrong. No this is not the case but the abuser wants you to think that because this way he or she can get away with it. When you feel comfortable talking with him then you will know it.|`|zGFiWSPtaa	It is pretty early, but it might be right. If you feel comfortable and you think he's read to recieve that info then go for it. If you're unsure, talk to a friend or family who knows about it and ask them.  I already answered your question of how to tell him so yeah. But, if you are kinda unsure, then it's prob best to wait a few more weeks or so. Don't worry about it though, if he loves  you, truly loves you, he'll stay and support you.<br>  <br>  <br>  GOOD LUCK!!!|`|8hIUOajLaa	That will most likely depend on the level of trust in your relationship.<br>  If you are comfortable sharing such with him and you feel that he can handle the knowledge, then yes.<br>  If you feel it may be harmful and you don't think he can currently handle it, then maybe wait a bit longer, worst case scenario is that he cant handle it and you should consider another person.|`|ktDZjbH7aa	EMMA,,I FU FEEL COMFERTABLE AROUND HIM,,THEN U SHOULD B ABEL TO TELL HIM ANYTHING,,,AND IT WILL HELP U TO TELL HIM,,,HE WILL UNDERSTAND U MORE AS A PERSON,,,TALK TO HIM,,,IF HE REALLY LOVES YOU HIS GOING TO HUG U N TELL U HIS GOING TO LOVE U FOREVER,,,AND HE WILL NEVER LET ANYONE HURT U AGAIN,,,CAUSE YOUR HIS,,,,,PEACE|`|wI8cnFnIaa	not at all, especially if the experience is keeping you from intimacy with your boyfriend. You should always be open and honest with him and let him know about your experiences. If he's a decent man, he'll listen to you and be there for you. He'll also understand any intimacy issues you might have, due to the abuse.|`|UNsQC0DGaa	it depends on how serious your relationship is <br>  if your having sex and flipping out everytime you might want to let him know why<br>  If he's asked you to marry him you want to be open with him <br>  If it is just casual dating or casual sex than waiting would be normal no reason to disclose it if your not both serious deep serious into eachother as that is a deep subject to bring up ,<br>  if you want to know his feelings about certain things find a movie related to it to accidently come on tv and see how he reacts to it or bring up different things in casual conversation without it being directly related to you to get a feel about how he might react|`|QPiwb7hKaa	first off, i am really sorry about what you had to go through <br>  <br>  i mean, it depends on how deep your relationship is. if you guys have been 8 weeks kind of casual, on and off, etc. then it'd just seem weird and out of the blue. if you feel comfortable having a serious convo. with him and you are confident in his devotion to you, then by all means you should share this with him ^^ hope i helped|`|o91A5r8taa	sexual abuse?!!! WTF go tell the police !!! ffs|`|W913W7Vnaa	huh?<br>  <br>  i don't get it.<br>  <br>  give more information on what your talking about next time.
CyHJlCZXaa	I think that's a good way to say it but you may need to go into a bit more detail without telling him everything that happened, you could say something like:<br>  <br>  "If sometimes i'm weird with you, then it's nothing against you it's just, without going into it, i was sexually abused when i was younger and sometimes i find it difficult getting close to you"<br>  <br>  Yes you're doing the right thing by telling him, otherwise he may think he's doing something wrong.|`|5V5L9DoBaa	don't tell him "just some stuff happened with a guy when i was younger" bcos he might think that that guy was better or he did stuff to you that nobody else could. If you don't mention the abuse then he'll deffo take it the wrong way. If he really is boyfriend material he won't think any different of you, and infact take more care towards your feelings|`|EO1lEP2Vaa	yeah, it would be. If your aren't fully comfortable though you can wait and tell him when you are.|`|724cUk75aa	you should def tell him. you could tell him u were sexually abused, but he might take it wrong. and you should def see a police officer|`|zGFiWSPtaa	Just tell him, any way you can. Sit him down and take a deep breath and tell him, something happened when I was little that affected me greatly and I really want to talk about it with you. he'll prob. be confused and say um...okay? but he'll listen so go on and tell hilm your story. In the end, explain that you told him this to explain to him why you are what you are  and do what you do. GOOD LUCK!!|`|kWaAlV32aa	I would definitely tell him. You don't have to go in detail, but I think he should know in case you act 'off' with him at any time.|`|3ab0562924ae58daee1fe664ccc36a9daa	You should defiantly tell him you were sexually abused, there isn't a whole lot of guys who like to hear details about things like that. But giving him a heads up on you i believe is appreciated by him, makes him a little more aware he should take things slower with you specially if hes a gentlemen.
0AShsMsoaa	it is a fine idea, one caveat, you are going to be so busy on the day of your wedding that you may find that putting out food does not work well with trying to get ready for your wedding. that is the main reason most brides have caterers.  or help that does the food portion of the reception.    <br>  <br>  if you are a casual person and things are all done ahead of time, and you have help putting things out it could work, but if you are frazzled and upset and rushing around that will make people uncomfortable.  <br>  <br>  you may see yourself " putting things out' but it does not follow that you would, what, take your vows, then put on an apron and run around to the fridge to the tables stacking platters and plates?  <br>  <br>  think it through, have a plan and commitments for help and it will be fine.|`|1M90Aoytaa	sounds perfect for a garden/home wedding. make sure you have a wet weather back up plan. make sure you dont put too much stress on yourself becasue you will have lots to do last minute, if you put the food under a gazebo or in a marque it will protect it from sun/rain and help to keep of flys and wasps. sounds lovely. go for it - remember your wedding is about you and your h2b and no one else really matters!|`|haCssg2Laa	LOVE IT!<br>  <br>  everyone gets exactly what they want<br>  no moaning about not liking anything<br>  relaxed, fun & yum<br>  <br>  i think this is a great idea<br>  and people will be much more sociable as they prepare their plate<br>  instead of sitting next to randomers they hardly know<br>  <br>  good for you<br>  and congratulations!|`|y6gVmhHxaa	It's fine for a backyard wedding!    If you were in a formal ballroom, then tacky but for a backyard wedding it would be perfect.|`|NPnCuwhFaa	Thats an excellent idea, i like it.<br>  <br>  My backyard can take up  aprox..8 tables (long tables) soo yeah depends on your backyard how big it is, how many tables can it fit? and how much people are coming?<br>  <br>  I had my wedding at a beautiful garden which was called (The white Garden" it had lots of white flowers and white roses and veryyyyy greeny clean grass across it was the beach and the sunset was perfect!! <br>  <br>  I made the food with my mum and sisters and his mum and sisters helped, i had 75 guests. = ]|`|k77zSmTTaa	My Husband and I did something similar to that.<br>  <br>  We loved saturday morning cartoons and eating cereal and poptarts.<br>  So guess what we had an early morning wedding.<br>  Then for the food we had a Cereal Bar .<br>  We set out 10 different kinds of Cereals<br>  Fresh Milk from the Local Dairy in Whole, 2% and Skim<br>  Then we got Fresh Juice and Chocolate Milk<br>  we had a Toaster with a Variety of Toaster Strudle and Pop Tarts and Eggo's<br>  Fresh Fruit Plate<br>  <br>  It was very casual and fun. My Family's Kid's Loved it (we even had a couple of cereal box prizes)|`|Ulwy92DIaa	i think it's a great idea! not tacky at all!! and if someone thinks it is tacky who cares! it's your wedding! people are gonna have something bad to say about whatever you do so you might as well do what you want! if i went to a wedding reception where i could make my own sub i would think it was neat and i'd enjoy my sub!! congratulations!!|`|95130278e70b179674702bb6588b3b27aa	A friend of mine did that for her wedding. They had breads, cheese, meats, veggies, and condiments out so that people could make sandwiches, subs, and wraps. It was nice. People are going to be there for you and to see you get married. IMHO..... too much emphasis is put on the rest of the things.<br>  <br>  Good luck and have a beautiful wedding!!|`|wI7wyIB3aa	I think it is a great idea! I might just have to borrow it!|`|QPVEL0NLaa	I just asked Jared and he said it is fine!!|`|Q3ibC4Rnaa	After looking for caterers myself, I believe this is a great idea! Most of the time the food they serve is pricey and really not that great. Of all the wedding's I've been to, only one dish do I remember (some light pasta side dish)! For my wedding we're just using favorite local places and the price comes out great and we already know we love the food!<br>  <br>  I'm doing somethings in my wedding that are a little different as well, but I love the idea! What a way to have your wedding stand out from everyone else! I don't think it'll be tacky, and I bet people will remember this reception meal much more then others.<br>  <br>  I'd just research what are popular items and make sure you have enough. If your guests list is anything like mine, you may have some people there that can really pile on a plate, and you'd hate to run out of something before everyone got a chance through the line.|`|47af2fda89839c0ec02e273cff59d82daa	i think thats great.  everyone gets exactly what they want then, and since its a backyard wedding, it doesnt need to be anything over the top fancy.<br>  <br>    i personally love weddings where you get to pick exactly what you want. thats what my brother and his wife did, they had a pasta bar and ooo it was tasty. and everyone loved getting to pick what they wanted cause not everyone likes everything, ya know?|`|NG6eeCfuaa	For a reception in the backyard, no, that seems to make perfect sense. If I was in a suit at the Hyatt Regency, then yes, it would seem strange indeed. I think it'll work out for you. Just don't leave the meat out too long if it's hot out.
hX9cHdyMaa	its awkward becos we all want the opposite sex to react differently<br>  <br>  shy and shy<br>  eg.. a boy sees a girl walking down the corridor, he decides he likes her and will attempt to talk to her tomorow... next day he talks to her and finds that she's also shy and there's a lotta silences between them. (figures that girls are just the same as him OR figures that no girl thinks he's worth it)<br>  .......<br>  <br>  shy and ****<br>  eg. a boy sees a girl walking down the corridor, he decides he likes her and will attempt to talk to her tomorow.. next day he talks to her and he just wanted to say hi and finds himself pressed up against a wall and her grabbing his hang-downs. (figures that these girls are nothing but sex crazed bitches who just want sex and he'll end up being som pimp or somthing OR he'll think all girls are like this and he'll become a cocky asshole)<br>  <br>  u get the picture =P<br>  <br>  cya|`|xsvDrtrRaa	actually being shy with your opposite sex is really natural sometimes you might find yourself more lower than your opposite i mean if he or she has sometimes to be admired and you will feel down about it in some situation being shy with your opposite sex means you like him or her. Or you are afraid of rejections thats why you are shy sometimes. ive experiences shyness when i was in grade school with an opposite sex coz  think his so cute and afraid in approaching him shyness and afraid is sometimes feel the same hope i helped you|`|SRzL2Wexaa	Because you're a shy person.  I get that way too, even though I'm mostly a confident person.  If I like someone, I get all worked up and can't be myself.
BYQ2kHPjaa	Personally I believe that personality is alot more important than looks, and I think its ridiculous how some people go out with someone they hardly know just because they are hot. So I would go for the ugly guy with the personality.|`|ZYyzCeoeaa	Depends how i felt, in different moods or situations i would date both, it would just be that hot guy- wouldn't last long and since i would know this i would take all i could from the relationship. Ugly guy would probably be a better relationship last longer, be a lot more pleasant.<br>  <br>  This has never happened so this is how i presume it would go, can't know for sure.|`|6BvkqeRfaa	I'm a straight guy and I know my opinion won't matter for you anyway but I'll say it anyway. If anyone who answers says that they'd prefer to date an ugly guy with a great personality they're flat out lying. Both aspects play an important role in a relationship, you can't love a girl if you think she's ugly, and the same for guys.|`|TWm5Smlaaa	people always say looks don't matter, but how awful is it to say to your boyfriend, "yeah, your really ugly, but I like your personality." You can't have one without the other.|`|AA11179568	liars<br>  those above are liars<br>  when a guy is ugly they will not even mind him<br>  how would they even date<br>  dont take me wrong im not ugly i just felt theyre liars|`|EJWphb88aa	Personality always <br>  <br>  coz good personality makes an ugly guy look smart.. :)|`|teFKJflZaa	if someone can make me laugh, they begin to look hot in my eyes even if other people don't think so (but who cares about them)|`|EO1lEP2Vaa	ugly guy with a personality.|`|1VSChD00aa	Looks r great lets not lie, but personality is aloso a big thing id realy wanna date the hot guy but id really want him to have personality so id probs date the ugly guy who has the looks in the inside< personality!!!!|`|VN7j6RUlaa	Just ask yourself if you would date a ugly girl with personality or a babe without personality|`|vOcxM9Xhaa	I think the answer would be if he had money would be most applicable.|`|RyiYBemqaa	ugly with personality anyday|`|AA11441704	one with beautiful heart.|`|NRldAzrpaa	I would rather date a guy inbetween, may sound shallow but its the truth.|`|AA10457351	I agree with others when they say that looks does have some play in the matter, but I've always been more attracted to personality than looks in the first place. <br>  <br>  You can be one of the hottest guys/girls in the world with the worst personality, and I would consider you to be an ugly person. However, you could be one of the ugly (such a nasty little word) people with an awesome personality, and I would consider you to be the most attractive person in the world. <br>  <br>  Too bad many people cannot get past the looks issue and look at the person who is on the inside ... Goes back to the old adage "Never judge a book by its cover."|`|r7V2ZS7Vaa	My friend that all depends on the girl, I find like people make like choce e.g. a ditzy cheerleader whom is the talk of the school, you'll see with her male counterpart (usually the stereotypical jock of the school) and people with personality usually want the same on the othside<br>  <br>  all-in-all it depends on the person|`|iNzRRI70aa	well looks are not quite as important as words and right now i am dating a semi cute guy with no personality. so i would go wit the ugly with a personality because if they don't have a personality than they are boring.<br>  <3much love<br>  LuCkY|`|j8XFGoLFaa	Ugly guy w/ personality. <br>  <br>  =)
psmTrwT3aa	all my little cousins used to do that to me i.e they used to copy my hairstyles..trainers and ask their mums to buy the same designer clothes in the same color as me.... even my catch phrases grr!.<br>  <br>  and i used to try and do what you did but then i realised since these kids keep copying me and i can't keep changing my style and wants because they copy me so i thought why not teeach them something good to do...<br>  if people look up to you they are bound to listen and follow you so either keep being mean to her and she'll hate you forever or...<br>  be nice and teach her stuff like a little sister.<br>  <br>  be nice little cousins never forget things even when they grow up i can still remember my older cousins not letting me play with them because i was "too small".<br>  <br>  if she's still annoying well i always used to send my cousins to do long tasks like go to a shop and get stuf for a mini party.<br>  the shop used to be 30 mins away so i had a god 2 hours to chill.|`|YG7nHfLCaa	lol.<br>  u should be proud that your cousin wants to be like you.<br>  but yeah, it's really annoying.<br>  most of my cousins do that to me too.<br>  u should tell her that she should be who she wants to be.<br>  and WCS she'll answer i wanna be you!<br>  then u should say u know what? I'm not perfect. And list out ALL the bad things about u that u could think of ( ask her to keep it a secret, it'll make her think u're REAL bad ). then tell her that she should be like someone else ( another cousin, maybe?)....|`|MlCWsBcwaa	Well, it sounds like she really looks up to you and is imitating for that reason.  Getting cross with her is probably not going to help.  Also, being nice to your cousin is going to help her.  Maybe you could try taking more of an interest in her and asking her about things she wants to do and what she likes etc.  Try to look at this from her point of view.  If you approach this in a happy way, and show her it is cool to be herself and that you think she is good being herself (not having to copy her cool older cousin), she might let up on the annoying behaviour.  If she is doing it just for attention, reacting to her is not going to help stop her behaviour.  I think the best bet is to spend time with her doing things that require her to be herself and not have the chance to copy you e.g. do some baking together and you each do different part of the preparation and get her to do the mixing.  Listen to music and get her to make up some dance moves for the both of you to do etc.  Good luck.|`|b5be50fedc55289736f6c2d830f978d6aa	Your Cousin seems to think you are really Cool, that's probably why she acts like you.<br>  <br>  Try to ignore her -after a while she will get tired of doing it if you don't get annoyed with her every time she does it.|`|eeca9ac8f433c991f439f7c48c18958aaa	you should be flattered, she obviously looks up to you.she will grow out of it soon,just be patient with her.|`|Ib58NZUBaa	be glad u have a fan
BYQ2kHPjaa	That does sound really mean, and if someone is a part of your family then you shouldn't be ashamed of them but love them. If it bothers you then just have a little talk with your friend, about why she is so ashamed of her. Good luck xx|`|Iuy8RryRaa	it depends on why she is ashamed of her big sis. if its someing really bad i would be ashamed to.<br>   but if it is just because.. then yes it is wrong and very rude!|`|x4RnrSOMaa	Well it is wrong because it's her sister. Nobody is perfect she needs to learn that but if she really is ashamed then don't talk about her it is very unlikely that someone will just pop up and say do you have a sister??
AA11315360	I would be upset. If he did do the crime then I would divorce him if it is a serious crime. If he did something small like shoplifting etc then I would just wait for him to get out of jail IF he is sorry about what he did.<br>  If he did a serious crime like murder or attempted murder I would divorce him immediately and get away from him!|`|gYWDrHVFaa	Depends what he did and to who.|`|uR4EDZElaa	i don't know what i would do. cry at first. but suck it in so that i could be strong for us both
a05818703edf627a70c2368c5b12f69daa	seems your partner has his priorities right. myself i would be happy my partner was getting away unless it happened all of the time, then i would have issues with it.|`|b3zGfYMpaa	Its important with couples that they spend quality time with eachother, but also adequate time with friends. Your guys friendship with his buds may be different than the ones you have with yours, but which ever way the cookie crumbles you need to allow time for him to go off with his friends once in awhile without you even if your not doing the same. If it does really bother you mention it and than find ways to satisfy and accommodate both of you. Your guy should be telling you of his trips well in advance so that you can prepare for a weekend without him. It shouldnt be a regular occurrence and once in awhile he should treat you to come along.|`|AA11447210	It should go both ways, if both people want that. If the woman (for example) doesn't have the desire to go be away from her family, that's fine...her male partner shouldn't feel he cannot go away for a few days or weeeknd though, just because she doesn't choose to.<br>  <br>  The option should be available for both, if they want to take it. Most people like a little "me" time now and then...especially if they have kids.|`|pOCabUMvaa	For someone in the last seven years went twice on a vacation without you, it doesn't really seem to be a problem.<br>  <br>  It also depends on where he went.<br>  <br>  Maybe you should find something you are both interested in and then go on a trip together.<br>  <br>  That would end the phone calls, and him wanting to come home the next day, and you being upset because he is gone.|`|AA11920812	My husband doesn`t go out with the boys. But, does go on business trips. He has said he`d watch the kids if I wanted to go somewhere for a weekend. I just don`t want to go anywhere. Plus, he always feels guilty and brings me back lots of goodies!!|`|jBigEy0Caa	I would miss my husband, but would be ok if he went out of town for the weekend.  Plan a trip with the girls.  You don't have to stay gone the whole weekend, go overnight somewhere & shop or something.|`|hiroBX09aa	it should absolutely go both ways...<br>  you should be able to have your day where you go off to a day spa or something with YOUR friends<br>  <br>  :]|`|ZBc16tOvaa	i agree it should go both ways|`|H6QkoukSaa	Once my baby is over a year old I don't care what my partner does, lol. That sounds mean, but at the moment with 3 little kids it is full on at night times. He does nights shift every second week and I have the kids all by myself. While I cope it is easier with both parents there to help as often as possible.<br>  <br>  My partner has a love of motorbikes and he wants to do a motorbike run one day to fish holes which would take him away for about a week. I have no problem with that after bubs is over a year. But he wouldn't have a problem with me going on a trip to Melbourne for the markets etc.<br>  <br>  My BIL does something like this every month and my SIL doesn't mind, it means she can do whatever she likes with the kids without him feeling left out.<br>  <br>  I agree that each to their own........what ever works for your family.|`|bfc067ab537555ada57edd464a8dfb97aa	I love my home, its my safe haven, I don't understand people that buy homes but never live in them at all.  My guy commutes and works all week that is like 12 hours of the day gone right there, 8 of them is sleeping the rest is eating dinner and watching a movie or television. <br>  On weekends he does volunteer work with a youth group who are learning seamanship, they learn to sail, drive large and small boats,etc. One or twice a month they go out on cruises which takes them away a couple of nights. <br>   He loves that sort of stuff, he has invited me and the kids to go but we just aren't interested.  So like today while he is gone cleaning the boat for next weekends cruise, I will be making dinner and going to a class.  If he is happy then I am happy and that is the important thing, right?
H6QkoukSaa	Mine aren't in order either.<br>  <br>  My partner has grown up, he realises that I need help with the kids while they are little and he also wants to spend time with them.<br>  <br>  He isn't happy in his job, but he wants to support us so one parent can be home with the kids for the first 5 years of their lives.<br>  <br>  He can be a lazy bum around home but he will always help with the kids, making lunches, getting them dressed etc.<br>  <br>  He loves me no matter what and if I have a crap day and get nothing done, he never criticises how messy the house is, or that he has no clean undies, lol|`|8tGAE1Nmaa	1. he has a heart as big as he is..<br>  <br>  2. he is kind and considerate to my needs<br>  <br>  3. he makes me feel safe and secure<br>  <br>  4. he is honest... sometimes a little too honest<br>  <br>  5. he loves to clean the kitchen up after dinner<br>  <br>  6. he is a good father and loves our boys tremendously<br>  <br>  7. he is all about the lord first|`|BYQ2kHPjaa	I would have to say the thing I adore most of all about my boyfriend is how sweet he is and he always makes me feel loved. For example he sends me flowers, always tells me how beautiful I am and sends me really sweet texts.

Hes funny..we always have fun together. Hes respectful, honest, and trustworthy. He takes my stress away, gives me great advice, and gets along with people who Im closest to. Ontop of that, hes kind, fair, and puts my needs and interests first.

Have a good time!!! Speak with your heart and let your soul out. If they don't accept you, that's their problem. You did your part. Promote yourself as a good friend any way you can. Are you honest? Are you kind? Are you friendly? Are you trustworthy? Are you commited? Are you hardworking? These are all great qualities to mention. Also, make sure to tell people a little bit about you, do you dance? Sing? are you a cheerleader?

Non payment also goes on your credit report.<br>  I don't get it,  if your income only covers your car and home, then how were YOU caring for the child financially when you and his mother were together?<br>   It seems to me that, even with you, SHE must have been caring for YOUR son financially alone.  So what you are saying is<br>  1-  She will be caring for your child financially alone.<br>  2- she has to care for your child alone on a daily basis, except the "occasion" you have the child.<br>  3- she now has the added expense of rent too :(<br>  And all you can say is I cant afford it. How can I get out of this!<br>  She cant "get out of this"!!<br>  The courts do not consider your expenses or hers. They only consider your incomes ( hers and yours ) and make a judgment from that. They expect you to adjust accordingly, do whats right, get another job or cut the expenses you have, to care for your child. <br>  Your child should not suffer because you value your home and car more then him. Your greatest investment should be your son! You should be spending your last dollar on your son. Not a home and car, that clearly you cant afford anyway! You are the exact reason they made the child maintenance!|`|gPlUDaRoaa	WOW,aren't you just a proud daddy!Oh,and your monthly income is only $1290 a month  & your outgoings are $1200.But now did you say you own your home?Cool.But jeez,if you have to even pay $5 a week to help support your son,well then bummer,your gonna have to sell/lose the house & your car too! now it's back to mums &  now what are you going to do right?Well jeez dude,your going to have to suck it up & accept it,But  mostly LEARN from this.  Like USE condoms at all times.Oh yeah one more thing you need to go is MAN UP to your responsibilities  and stop whining about having to give HER money.You are and should want to contribute to raising your son .A lovely little guy who will grow up & love &respect you  and know how you are the greatest dad in the world.Come on dude ,their are worse things happening in the world  all your doing is becoming a father and that is wonderful.You are going to have someone who is always going to love and look up to you.Think of him as a blessing because one day you will realize how blessed you truly are.Good luck to you man.|`|sePbIUXiaa	You made a choice to bring this child into the world now you have an obligation to support your child, a duty. Honor dictates your take care of your own, if that means you go with out so be it. Sell you car, sell anything you have of value in your house, extra clothes you are not wearing, things you are not using, anything and everything sell it. And cut back, get rid of all the extra, cable, cell phone, going out anything that take food out your baby's mouth is an extra. Your child should be everything to you . If you can not afford to live it is because you are doing it wrong, make your child your priority and get rid of stuff and things and step up to being the best parent God made you capable of being when you made the decision to have this child. Stop blaming! Not only do what is right but do what is required of you for your child.|`|uKr6TFxNaa	you will pay or you will go to jail

It cost nothing to speak or smile, Nothing and it takes nothing away from you and your family a hi or a smile for a stranger. Try if you care for your wife show her you can be kind to a stranger and not feel anything is taken away but something is given to you. Because Kindness is free, and everyone matters to someone. Be careful the message you send to your family when they see you will not help a stranger because one day that stranger that needs help might be YOU. And no matter how independent we think we are everyone at sometime in their life  will come in contact with a stranger that will help just because with no expectation for reward just the joy of doing a kindness for another. Kindness is priceless and its own reward. So try a little Kindness today and make your wife Happy.|`|AA10240683	Being kind to others is a sign of good character. You show signs of good character with your family but, the stranger you may have disrespected before may become the boss of your new job; or the helping hand you need in a time of crisis.

I dont think that it would be unhealthy for the kids to see you guys together in casual situations. If the kids are having difficulty dealing with the divorce, perhaps this will help them see that things are different from how they were before. <br>  <br>  It might also be cathartic for you and your ex as well. I am personally going through a divorce right now, and I would be fine with going to dinner with my ex and the family. I think it would help the kids too--see that there is civility in the relationship. You might address the issue with her beforehand. That way--you both know what to expect.|`|WDs4fRoxaa	You should call and ask. <br>  <br>  Assuming is not the right thing to do.<br>  <br>  She might have the wrong idea, or she could just want<br>  family time to make the kids comfortable, or she could<br>  want to talk to you about something in front of them.<br>  <br>  Calling and asking could clear your worries, or help you<br>  to avoid providing false hope, if that is the case.<br>  <br>  Best wishes|`|YNDMwFEJaa	What the big deal my aunt and cousin's used to go out whit her ex husband there dad for dinner all the time, she prolly just wants to show the kids even tho yall are divorced yall are still a family and the both of still love them.Grow up and go to dinner with them.|`|P9wE9XZlaa	My husband made a mistake on going on a dinner with ex after all these years just for the kid and she started sending him text messages bout how he fell in love with her and how much she wants to be with him again....and hates it when he mentiong my name....it was bit of a situaton and even caused problems in our marriage ....and even the child got effected by this...so its your call|`|WzKrZoHQaa	How strong are you ?  Then try to get some clarity on the subject first.  Tell her you will come and have dinner with THE KIDS and make it clear it is for the kids.  Why does it need to be at Home ?  Why not go for a cheap & cheerful pizza on neutral ground ?  Maybe she wants to try get back with you and this is the first of many invites to things - bowling next etc etc.  It depends on how strong you are.  Can you do this and walk away again ?  How will this little family gathering be seen in the eyes of the children ?  Will they be happy only to be disappointed ?  Will she then say well they really enjoyed having you here maybe we can repeat it,   maybe you could stay over,    how can you leave like this when you know you leaving will upset the children ?  Be very careful.   You need to ask her outright WHY she is inviting you but keep a safe distance of you do go.|`|dOPYcWj0aa	If your gut instinct is that she wants you all to be a family again, and that is not what you want decline. But if you think she is not intrested in having you that way, maybe she just thinks it would be pleasant for the kids to have both their parents with them at the same time.|`|6cm6MB66aa	No don't do it . I don't know your circumstances why your divorced in the first place but i took up the invitation with my ex a couple times and it ended in disaster both times . If you moved on best to tell her to move on also.|`|uR4EDZElaa	Go and eat with them. maybe she just wants you to be around the kids . Maybe she wants you back, maybe she don't want u back and has something to tell u|`|HGnKhY0maa	Continue to tell her no, you don't want to give her the wrong idea or confuse the kids.|`|B5WbBKDOaa	watch your wallet, run like hell|`|HFHNxQ0vaa	why can't more men be honest like u??|`|0DyWTwYFaa	If the kids are yours, it is important to be civil to their mom. Make it clear that you would love to take the kids to dinner and that it would be nice if she is there. However make it clear that it you have no interest in her.|`|sePbIUXiaa	Ask Why she wants this could be this might have nothing to do with getting you back, she could be wanting to move forward. Ask the question if you want the real answer.|`|lgxE5nUoaa	Continue being honest with her.  I think you are doing what's right for you - keep being strong.  If she demands to know why you don't want to go, you can simply say, "I appreciate the invitation, but I don't feel comfortable.  Please respect that."|`|H41u0B8Jaa	As long as you see your kids there is no reason to have dinner with them with your ex along.  That would just make the kids hope you are getting back together.  I have no idea why she would want to keep inviting you to join them for dinner...could be she just feels friendly towards you or could be she is hoping you will join them and miss being part of the family and want a reconciliation.
F08qx2hgaa	It's comparable to a drug addiction. You have a hard time quitting it, and when you try, you only feel hurt and suffering. And it makes you feel so good.<br>  <br>  Ha, not that I'd know, I don't do drugs. Nor have I ever been in love...<br>  <br>  I can tell you what love isn't. It does not involve infatuation or lust. They are only a dependency of sorts, that we tend to get into by human nature. So it is pure.<br>  <br>  It forgives, while realizing flaws. If you can't see those flaws, it may be infatuation. And if flaws are all you can think about, it may be lust or a fading love.<br>  <br>  Love is kind, simple and wonderful. Or so I observe it to be. Think of love as the connection between mother and child. It is protective and caring... it opens eyes and moves mountains.<br>  <br>  I don't think there's any one way to describe love, and I can't tell if any other people in my life have really been "in love". It's that harsh of a world. I find my definition in older couples who are still together and other ways of showing love.|`|ilbMPWmzaa	its magical, unconditional, giving, generous, understanding, acceptance, support, and trust..i could go on btw!|`|o91A5r8taa	Dont listen to wat anyone tells u about "real love" it doesnt have at all a description....... it is A FEELING when u feel it ull know!|`|0tU4jkS9aa	you'll know it when ur in it.<br>  <br>  please answer my most recent question!!|`|jROpVbrhaa	sacrifice, understanding.

They are two adults and it is up to them to sort it out.  If anyone else should be involved, it should be your dad, not the kids.  It is his wife and brother/brother in law after all.  There could be more too it that just a political argument.  It the conversations are bothering you, then I think you should tell your mom and dad that, and say that you love both her and your uncle and it really bothers you.  Hopefully she will cut back on bad-mouthing the uncle in front of you.  That is family for you.  Maybe if some outsider bad-mouthed your uncle, she would defend him still, do you think?

However, if she went away for a few weeks when she came back you'd want to **** her again, its natural. <br>  <br>  Personally I think marriage is better suited to women than to men. For men its perfectly natural to lose sexual interset in a woman they've been with for a long time. This is one reason why if I ever get married it'll have to be an open relationship. Loads of peole have very happy open relationships. <br>  <br>  You must also remember that a lot of people are basically stupid when it comes to this issue, thats why u have a load of idiots on here telling u that theres something wrong with you. Theres nothing wrong with u, its perfectly normal. These people are just lying to themselves. <br>  <br>  Love and sex are two different things, fact. If you think you're wife is openmided ask her if she would mind u seeing a prostitute or even having an affair, or an open relationship. If not I would suggest seeing a prostitute. It would breathe new life into your relationship with your wife. <br>  <br>  The idea of falling in romantic love, getting married, finding your wife sexually attractive and staying like that until u die is a myth. It happens in maybe 1% of marriages. And anyone who thinks otherwise is just not looking at reality. I think marriage is an out moded form of cohabitation. We need to find new ways to live together, and have sex.|`|IDrA6gMxaa	It might bring problems later on once your wife notice. Try to think why you feel like this and how long it lasted for. With me, it usually passes after some time - yes, I have times when I can't look at my husband as a person I can have sex with. He feels the same sometimes (he admitted) and it usually passes. Tell her wife as well so she knows what is happening - she deserves to know.|`|Nq95TtCeaa	You need to go to a professional counselor. Your problem is too complex to be analyzed and resolved here.

X6rFPI2laa	I really like your idea about a photo!  If there is a box of old photos stashed somewhere at your house, why not go through it, find a really neat old one, and take it to Walgreens, etc (a place you can enlarge, crop, etc. photos at low cost) to enlarge, and then put it in a frame for them!  It doesn't need to be a formal portrait type photo, and you might find a snapshot with the two of them just doing something fun at home or on vacation, standing in front of a new car, with a Christmas tree or a pet, etc.  Since you can crop the photos on those wonderful machines you don't need to worry about the periphery stuff -- just pick a photo where the people look good!   You will see that you can get new frames that are "vintage", so one that would go with an old photo would be a nice pairing.  5" by 7" would be a very good size for the photo and frame.|`|HUhheZWtaa	Something they both like or make them go out for dinner alone|`|WzKrZoHQaa	This is a great gift for approx ￡25 - Buy a star and have it registered in their names.

D2JW4wKxaa	You may be in the photos, but unfortunately the pictures belong to the photographer. Ethically he should have lived up to the agreement, but legally I don't think you have much you can do, unless he publishes them. That would be a different circumstance that may be actionable. <br>  <br>  You are probably dealing with an amateur that either didn't have time or found out the post production work was more difficult than he was prepared for. You may eventually get the photos if you keep at it. You may also find that the quality is disappointing though. <br>  <br>  In the future you should use an established and reputable even if it means you spend a little money. In that case you are less likely to have trouble, more likely to get good photos and since you paid them, there is a legally enforceablee contract if they don't deliver.|`|t7jiSmjVaa	You agreed to let him shoot your pictures for free.

szVvf7Nkaa	If I was in your shoes I would run and not look back. This girl that you are sort of seeing has no respect for you. And the reason I say that is that because she cheated on you with this other girl in your home and in your bed. And it does not matter if they were drunk or not. Drunk is not an excuse for things that you do. If they had been that drunk then they wouldn't have been able to kiss and be all over each other. Your girlfriend is attracted to this girl and she made it clear to you that she enjoyed it. And you would be foolish to believe that she's is not going to do this again.<br>  <br>  If you still don't feel right about the whole thing then maybe you should stop seeing this girl. She is not the type who is going to stay faithful to you. And before you get in too deep over your head then break if off. And you need to remember that Valentine's Day is a special day for couples. But on Valentine's Day your girlfriend's message was clear that she preferred to be in the arms of someone else.|`|znvx2NMQaa	like i told u before<br>  <br>  ther were DRUNK.<br>  <br>  who cares they were drunk and there girls what would u prefer she kisses anouther girl or anouther guy.<br>  <br>  girls do this sort of thing all the time.<br>  <br>  now that i have told u twice please dont ask the same question again.|`|shvhgzXeaa	Don't read too much into it. It was a one off. Drink does make a person do stupid things. I understand you were hurt because it was Valentines. If you cannot see past this point of what happened I think its best if you call it a day with her and move on.

About her being shy, what could overcome this do you think? <br>  There are the obvious methods you could use to get her to hang out with you. Studying together could be one option. Another could be (this may seem quite stupid) but are there any reasons you could use to persuade her, in a way, to come round to your house? <br>  Like, if it's someone in your family's birthday coming up, you could invite her round to bake a cake, and you could be all, 'I have no idea how to bake! Help?!' where she would feel more in control because you're actually learning something from her.<br>  Or if you're totally sure that outside of school would be a no-go area (hopefully for the time being!) then you could just say to her that you should sit together at lunch. Sitting together would be a really good chance to get to know her more, and you'd also be able to flirt with her more easily than perhaps in class, as you're able to talk freely. <br>  I hope I've helped you some :)|`|F08qx2hgaa	If she likes you too, I doubt she'll say, "I'm busy".<br>  <br>  Just say, "Do you want to hang out this weekend?" away from people, away from distractions. It's easier if you get her by herself.|`|cqOOKv3Jaa	get her to loosen up. reel her in. make her feel comfortable by talking about things that you are positive shes intrested in, common intrests gets people to loosen up|`|Qlyh3pG0aa	StudyBuddys?|`|nbtZ4ixoaa	say you have two tickets to cinema, does she want to come?<br>  <br>  don't just ask her to hangout if she is shy, have something planned so she doesn't feel like it will just be you and her sitting doing nothing|`|JFJF3GPWaa	Arrange a group get together down at the park or something. Invite a few of your friends and invite some of her friends. if her other friends are there she'll feel more comfortable and may be a bit less shy.<br>  Hope this helps x|`|QDz0FBv1aa	Three words.

v3Y0Wij8aa	NO..I never cheated on my husband while we were married. And I never thought I would get involved with a married man, but I have recently have. It has ignited my world....he has a fiery spirit...and has lit a spark inside of me that has been out for a very long time. <br>  <br>  I have no intention of ending it anytime soon.|`|AA10240683	Extramarital affairs seem to be part of the culture. It is displayed in the soap operas, situation comedies, etc. The reality is the majority of these affairs only end badly. Technically, I did have one.

I left once for a year and a half. I went threw this crap for twenty years. I had to get him to divorce me,or he would become mentally ill. It had to be his decision cause he was such a control freak. So I had an affair.

I'm tired of society treating relationships and people like everything is disposable. I take promises seriously and I have every intention of keeping my commitments until death.<br>  <br>  I will never have an affair and if someone shows interest in having an affair I will defend the institution of marriage.  I will not intrude on a dating relationship.  I have never been married and if someone wants to be with me they need to be single.<br>  <br>  My parents have been faithfully married for almost 35 years. My grandparents have been faithfully married for almost 60 years. It's possible for marriage to last for a lifetime.

There may be a few people out there who can honestly admit to liking the taste of ****, but most will compare it to a bitter salt tablet. Most men wish their partner would swallow, and usually the biggest road block is the fact that their partner hates the taste. Here are some tips that will help to improve the taste of your semen<br>  <br>  Diet Influences Your Semen's Taste And Smell<br>  Like your other bodilly secretions, semen's taste and smell is affected directly by what you eat and drink. Like you may notice, the taste of your female partner's vaginal secretions is also linked to what she eats or drinks. Have you ever noticed that if you eat a meal consisting of onions or garlic, the smell seems to escape from your skin pores the next day? Your *** is the same way and although the specific taste or odor may be difficult to detect, it does have an influence on the overall taste.<br>  <br>  While there's no scientific evidence to back these tips up, there are anecdotal reports and common sense. Changing your diet and intake of other chemicals into your body will have an effect on your body's output, including your semen. Most techniques or supplements to alter the flavor of semen aim to increase the amount of sugars in it, and sometimes mask the saltiness and other tastes with another flavor.<br>  <br>  Passing The Taste Test<br>  It will come as a disappointment to most party animals, but the best way to produce better tasting **** is to live free of consuming toxins. You will need to take it easy when it comes to consuming your favorite vices - alcohol, cigarettes, drugs, and junk food will really put a strain on your production of great tasting man chowder. It's been said that vegetarians, both men and women, have better tasting bodilly secretions, so you may want to steer clear of red meat, fish, and dairy. The secret to great tasting *** is to eat plenty of fresh fruits and veggies. What should you drink? Loads of juice and water.<br>  <br>  Many people recommend eating pineapple or drinking pineapple juice to make your *** taste sweeter. Citrus fruits and cranberry juice are also recommended, possibly because they make the body's pH more acidic, counteracting the alkalinity of semen that contributes to its "bleachy" quality. Any fruit or fruit juice high in sugar content, like apple, melon, mango, or grape, may increase the amount of sugars put out in your semen. Parsley, wheatgrass, and celery have been recommended for sweeter semen as well, perhaps because of the chlorophyll in them.|`|8db85fd4b33941a8f3ba450c709d9159aa	no i really never heard that, if you been drinking it and nothing happen then what you heard was their Option and the truth is the really will not work.|`|NZg4hIrYaa	i never heard of it, but if she really likes you, whatever taste she will love|`|ABtqc2WPaa	Yes.|`|X7rPWJU8aa	yes but you have to change your diet. along with drinking the pineapple juice you need to cut out meats. all spices basically eat fruits and lots of them .its not worth it.|`|kJ4g1vujaa	I've heard that rumour, never tried it myself!

Basically your cheating on him, Are you kissing and other stuff with these guys? Are you lying to or not telling your guy about them? If he does know does he mind?

Sneaking around is wrong, leading people on is wrong but being friends openly is fine truthfully would you really want to be friends with someone who would only be your friend behind closed doors or would you want a friend who you can talk to whenever and wherever you see them. If your in a controlling relationship way carefully all your options you dont want to loose your identity but its usually a jealousy / fear issue , you should also be around the other guy only if your comfortable with them being around your partner also, if you can all be friends sure be friends but would you want your guy hanging out with a girl that he didnt feel comfortable hanging out with around you? think of it from both sides|`|nbtZ4ixoaa	i've debated this to myself many times, and i think i have finally found the answer! ask yourself these questions:<br>  <br>  1) is it a secret from your bf?<br>  <br>  2) do you like the guy?<br>  <br>  3) does the guy like you?<br>  <br>  4) do you spend the time as though you were on a date (cuddling, holding hands, etc.)?<br>  <br>  If you answer yes to any of these questions then you shouldn't be hanging out with them one on one, if you answer yes to all of these questions then maybe you should re think your relationship|`|mfmdFhsjaa	no not really..<br>  if you really committed then you need to keep in mind what he feels..<br>  if he feels insecure about it..then no..<br>  if he is conferable with it..and you know that you know you are not doing then go for it..<br>  <br>  be sure that its just a hangout nothing else..:)|`|Ho4mZ6mSaa	Depends, what you and these "other" guys do on your one on one time.

Personally, I think its possible with having a guy friend and NOT fall in love with him or grow fond of him etc. etc.|`|tZii7WTraa	it is if your doing things you know would upset your bf/gf.  just ask yourself if the other person would think thats cheating...and if you can answer it knowing with a doubt that they wouldn't mind then your safe.  :)

YOU should be his really nice birthday present. GOOD LUCK!|`|UNsQC0DGaa	you cheated on your bf which is wrong <br>  you prostituted yourself which is illegal <br>  you endangered your safety <br>  that is why people are bashing you <br>  you may of had good intentions but it is wrong on so many levels|`|6LKEWFPoaa	Girl, do you!

It will be selfishness.|`|jTEB2cgsaa	Depends on how much you LOVE each other!<br>  Limitations and aaaall!|`|SRzL2Wexaa	Yeah, doesn't sound like you're cut out for each other.

9c0829fc04d30a907d2a9892ddd6eac6aa	Alot of people will tell you school is the best days of your life but I too hated the place.  It is a really harsh environment - you get judged on all manner of things, where you live, kind of house you have, what your parents drive, how you look, how bright you are, how pretty etc etc - list is endless - so it is no wonder your confidence is really low.<br>  <br>  Most of these things you have no control over - you did not choose to look a certain way etc but the harsh reality is a very unfair hierarchy.<br>  <br>  As it hard as it is therefore you just need to realise that life will not always be this way.  Once you leave school - the real world is no where near as difficult in respect of you will not be judged on looks, being quiet etc nearly so much.  <br>  <br>  Children can be cruel and usually put others down to increase their own social standing - it might make them feel big and clever or it may be that they can get a laugh at someone else's expense and again means they keep their bonds with others.<br>  <br>  If I was you I would try and ignore it, realise it is not YOU, if you were not there they would be picking on someone else hun.  Put your head down and if possible speak to a teacher you trust.  It will be miserable for you mean time but if you can, start to get interests outside of school - make a new social circle of more mature, kinder pals (real kinds of friends) preferably with people who share your interests.  <br>  <br>  Also console yourself with the knowledge many of these bullies will not amount to much - no doubt many will have a screed of kids in tow in the not too distant future, others may end up druggies or in and out of jail etc (I still see some of the dafties from my school in the local paper up for various offences etc) - so just you keep being a decent person and once you meet like minded people your confidence will increase.  <br>  <br>  Being a teenager is really really hard.  It is a worrying time and you worry not just about school but always about how you look, what others think of you etc etc and so realise too that this will NOT be forever either - I bet you will look back in 10 years, having a great social circle, great boyfriend, good job etc and be glad those tough years were gone.<br>  <br>  Good luck. x|`|AA11812015	Just keep on being who you are.  People are either going to like you or they are not, but you have to like yourself first in order to know that.|`|O7ST6Da0aa	It is a little strange that your friends have shied away from you, but then again it is school. I have seen friends talk crap about one another not hang out for weeks then suddenly its like nothing ever happened and they best friends again. Dont fret about it, just keep being you and everyone will come around again. Call one of your friends when you know she is alone and talk to her, dont try to pry a lot of info out of her because you will put her on the defensive. Dont text either because kids will be kids and when they are in groups your text messages can become vicious weapons to embarrass you.|`|omZkCz5Yaa	1.Dazzling i think you should totally ask a teacher to sort this out.<br>  2.go to your so called friends and beat them up.<br>  3.ask someone to tell you wats going on, if it's okay just get your old friends back or if it's bad go up to them and swear then get new friends.<br>  P.S if i were you i'd take option 2|`|0VLirxVtaa	There is probably some stupid rumor going around about you or they are probably jealous of you. Don't give them the time of day. I would advise you to just ignore it. If they wanna act that way, then so can you. They obviously weren't your real friends anyway. Just walk around school, like you don't even care.<br>  -Good Luck!|`|bHNOAYPGaa	have more confidence in urself|`|AA12388091	little thing to gain confidence and respect of others is talk to them one by one but not for yourself about them self, but not to forget "one by one" it will increase your confidence and when you talk to them about their own interest they will respect you in favor of you respect them!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br>  simple funda but works.............try and tell me about it.
oTWpoIJdaa	Are you the older sibling?  Are you close to or in the age of "adulthood"?  If yes, then maybe your mom believes it is time for you to fly solo, be independent and live on your own.

She calls him from the airport of his city. He hangs up on her. She keeps calling, shes hysterical, he shows up at the bar he tells her to go to, he walks in says, Im married get the heck out of here and curses her out. She is devistated. She flies home and is telling my kids this and I come in from work, and listen to this, shes fired, on the spot. We do not go meet people from online.

You're good enough because I say so!"...That's the only way to snap somebody out of that, I feel, because their self-esteem is so tied to what you think of them...you have to reassure him you don't think he is a lesser person and eventually he'll start to believe it of himself...<br>  <br>  i find it amazing how many people prescribe the wrong solution for this...leaving him alone will only make him feel worse about himself...it's common sense!|`|9xICsp5oaa	Please don't just leave it alone, if he's worth it make an effort and help him get over his low self esteem.

I,m now in Malaysia, and we have a lots of frangipani here - variety in species and colours. It is one of soft item for landscaping in resorts and widely used in spas.

And from the answers you have asked this before. Not getting married or having kids is fine. But I think you think you missed something by making these choices. Which you did. But those of us who got married and had kids missed somethings that you experienced. Being a mother is something I would never redo or miss. Being a wife of 27yrs. I enjoyed allot of it. I wouldn't miss it either. It took work, commitment and strength. The rewards are great. <br>  Everybody has faults. Mr Right most likely passed you up. When you were consumed with you.

This is what you really want.|`|5b3uOQc6aa	There are people out there who feel sorry for you and people who envy you. It's the truth. It's not going to change. Might as well accept it while you're at it.<br>  It's too late to care what people think anyway! <br>  Personally, I think you're trying to prove something to us by your questions. That you're happy. If someone is happy, they don't need to prove it.<br>  <br>  And take a chance on love. It's taken day by day. It blossomes under hope. Many marriages break, many don't. It's a moot point.<br>  If you don't want people to feel sorry for you, don't bring marriage down. It's a beautiful thing. Respect works both ways.|`|AA11683646	It appears that your attitude getting in the way of your life.<br>  <br>  40 never married "moral" does not drink?<br>  <br>  I do view you as cold. It may not be true but that would be the view of a guy from this description.<br>  <br>  The messages being sent include,<br>  Cannot allow someone into her life,<br>  She is afraid of relationships,<br>  Her morality is getting in the way of her being a little fun,<br>  Probably will take many many dates before she is physical which is boorish at 40.<br>  Fear of failure does not allow her to try things much less the leap of faith to let someone in.<br>  <br>  Are any of these things close?<br>  These views may not apply but more often than not they do.<br>  <br>  I have known a woman for almost 30 years who had a checklist for her relationships. She is now 55 and never found that guy.<br>  <br>  Please don't do that to yourself.<br>  The fear of a breakup is no reason to avoid relationships.<br>  Take a chance on love.<br>  <br>  BTW- your profile on YA seems very much as you described yourself. Does not allow messaging, does not allow email, is not allowing anyone to become her contact.<br>  Why so guarded? <br>  There are plenty of people on the box with poor intent but there are many more who will be your friends.<br>  Be cautious in your communication but at some point you should consider letting someone in.|`|djUMvICoaa	Sometimes we can do all the right things and yet give off all the wrong messages.  Sometimes what one person feels is their security can be viewed by others as being snobbish.  Sometimes that is what can happen with a career, that we get so wound up in it that it just consumes our lives and we have no room for anybody else.  You can lose touch with feelings you should have, compassion, empathy, etc, because they get in the way of your way up the ladder.  That's what I would be worried about because you could have thrown away or lost an important part of who you are.  In either case you are better off without a relationship because you wouldn't bring enough of the right things to the table to make it work.  Then of course you aren't even going to put yourself out there for a long term relationship.  You are running your life like you would a corporation, cold and indifferent.  You say you are happy now but then why are you even writing?  It seems like you know somethings not right and you want somebody to wake you up.  If the crisis continues in our economy, you will see a lot of people out of work but so many of them will be happy because they have home and family to support them.  What is going to make you happy if you lose your job?  Is that why you are writing?|`|xp4mhkqgaa	I wouldn't view them any differently from someone who was married and had kids.  <br>  <br>  I take people as I find them, and don't judge them on how they live their lives (as long as they're not hurting others, of course).  <br>  <br>  I'm 35, and I do have a child, but I've got no interest in ever getting married, as I don't see any need for it.  I was in a relationship for 12 years with my son's dad, and didn't ever think about getting married.|`|0DyWTwYFaa	Getting into a relationship happens to most people but that does not mean that it is wrong if it did not happen to you. <br>  <br>  You seem to be a very level headed and balanced person, there must be some merits to your decision  not to get into a relationship, and if part of that thinking is that marriages and relationships do break down which causes much more pain then being single- it is a good argument.|`|6132f6a771683d80d47a4c23893dff7eaa	why are you asking this question now? by the way, engaged with 3 kids and 40 is far from too late to have kids. In my view life is for living and thats exactly what you should do but maybe you should just take a chance on someone someday who knows where it will take you. good luck.|`|gniKjoG8aa	"I don't do this, and I don't do that..."<br>  <br>  You sound extremely boring...  Just think of it as you've been saving some poor guy a never-ending life of CSI and Saturday evenings playing backgammon.|`|1a801978a3ed03fd7bfa2bc42f67b2aeaa	I think your doing the right thing, settling for something would be irresponsible and does not make for a happy life, I say if your happy and content with being single then KUDOS for you.|`|jbQOC5kJaa	You sound smart.<br>  If you are happy with your independence that's fine.<br>  No, you are not cold.  I'll bet there are some who envy you.   Enjoy!|`|FXZLNc1aaa	Lucky!!!! be thankful you dont have "baggage" so many women(and men) have @ that age.|`|D7ilQVcMaa	ok u sound perfect  where u from im 46 single male from uk , I have 2 grown up sons|`|dOPYcWj0aa	You can't put people in cookie cutter molds, everyone is unique, every situation differnt. You must be very independent to live as you have, and there is nothing wrong with that. Really who would want to be one of the many broken marriages, just to say they had had one, not to mention the damage done on their children. Maybe you have lived a little to strictly for your own well being, perhaps afraid to take chances? I would view you as either very independant or if I put myself in your shoes, very lonely. But then I am somewhat of a neeedy person and that life would not suit me. We are all differnt, if your happy then roll with it.|`|fePQ12Rfaa	I was the same as you - independent, living the high life, holding my own alone in London. What I realised most that was everybody around me settled and those who didn't were viewed as 'sad' for whatever reason. Although many people moan about marriage, I decided to take the plunge at 35. For what its worth, life is easier when you have somebody to share it with, warts and all. Its why most people decide to get married in the end. <br>  <br>  You have to think about your future alone. Most of the singletons I hung around with are still alone, age 40 upwards and most of them are  feeling it. <br>  <br>  I would say start dating and if you're lucky enough to find somebody, settle down. Don't forget we slow down as we get older and it never hurts to have somebody around to share the it with us.<br>  <br>  Research after research shows that those who are married people are much happier than those who choose to remain single.

4fc129ccfffdb16cb2d28a6fe0c55cdeaa	The same reason women are egoistic. Only they manifest themselves in different ways - men in a more 'animalic' way and women in a more scheming, revengeful way.<br>  <br>  Also, both men and women are god created creatures :)) so we should both be proud of ourselves. <br>  Don't get me wrong, acting like a$$holes is up to the person and it isn't ok.<br>  <br>  As for women kind - we made them, we destroy them!

Maybe her parents need to know what is going on.|`|qmMCGKl9aa	you need to talk to her and let her know that her changing herself for a boy is NOT ok. <br>  <br>  a guy has to accept you for you.<br>  and if she chose to start drinking and maybe even smoking, than shes just stupid.<br>  <br>  you shouldn't change yourself for none.|`|M6w0MMU8aa	You say something. Tell her gently that thing she's doing wrong which for the better or maybe for the worse. If she's a true friend to you she'll find a way to understand you. Your friends. She should care about what you have to say. About her parents, I think they should do every thing they can to control they're daughter to stop doing things that could lead to her own destruction. Boys like the boy your friend likes make me tick. He knows that your friend likes him. He should tell your friend to not do the things he do to impress him. Maybe the guy doesn't feel the same way as your friend feel for him. Because if he does, he will not allow to let the girl be in danger just to get his attention. That's all I can give.

y39iNwFjaa	I'm confused. Why on earth would you have set up this dreadful account for him? And no - you can't wipe the computer clean as your computer will have ghost files that the police experts can find. Why do you now want to alarm him when it was you that set him up in the first place? That's a strange form of friendship. I suppose you'll have to talk to him and share your worries and get him to see that these little girls are being abused vilely and by looking at the pictures, he's part of it.<br>  <br>  Edit<br>  the police don't randomly check PC's - what they DO (and this is the threat for your friend) is get details of all subscribers to these dodgy sites and check all the names and details. That's how he'll get caught.|`|rAa8bfhwaa	I don't think the police arrest you for LOOKING at child pornography.

That's whack.|`|8GDd6lrnaa	i don't know about the computer, you say serious health problem or mental health? if he is mentally disabled he needs to get counseling. he needs to learn why this not socially accepted. if this is the case please get him help before it can progress.|`|ZbxcHDh2aa	early stages of paedophilia..tell him to start taking therapy or threeaten to report him if he doesnt stop what he is doing.|`|ATh0ciALaa	your as bad as him that is so disgusting DELETE them and get rid of the site u deserve too be caught you both have serious problems if u even think about that|`|yuOuoCfDaa	you sound more like a desperate wife than a friend who is trying to cover up her sleezy husband and his degenerate behavior|`|rLCx5ljQaa	You can't wipe an ISP list - if the police find out your mate is in a lot of trouble.<br>  <br>  You need to shock him into stopping this behaviour - show him cases of paedophiles and what happens to them.<br>  <br>  This is a serious health problem and he can go to jail for it. he needs counselling ASAP to try and stop this.<br>  <br>  I hope your friend gets better
49niWB6Qaa	Your avatar is creepy. I think it's the dark eyes and blond hair. It's interesting, but it looks very alien. Not that that's bad.<br>  <br>  Anyway, I think you're reading too much into it. Maybe he just needed to go for some reason. Perhaps he had to go to the bathroom really badly or perhaps he was thinking about something and he didn't feel like talking to anyone or maybe his friends needed him. Who knows? If it just happens once, don't worry about it.<br>  <br>  I don't think your friend had anything to do with it.<br>  <br>  You should not use netspeak. For example, you should say, "go to college" not "go 2 college". It makes your writing hard to understand. Also, you need to read over your question before posting it and fix the errors, because it's hard to understand what you're saying.
dJoE8yedaa	No one must know absolutely everything about you especially in a relationship.

Keep some secrets otherwise they'll get bored with you and move on to someone else.|`|Wg0VteZ9aa	yea give us a scenario?|`|SRzL2Wexaa	Yes, you should know anything important or that pertains to the relationship with that person.  You'll find out eventually anyway, if you plan on having a future together, so you might as well get the garbage out of the way, just in case.  Why would you want a relationship based on lies or false beliefs? I don't know about you, but I want someone who loves me the way I am.|`|m3Y3KkRmaa	Personally, why bring past problems or secrets that would ruin your relationship. It's past. You shouldn't look back. It's a new start. Focus on the present and your future with your partner :)!!  But you could tell your boyfriend there are things that happened in the past which you're not happy about but would prefer not to talk about it. But if wants to hear about them, then you're willing to be honest with him. But let him know that it may ruin your relationship and you don't want that to happen.|`|Hvw1re0Haa	YES when you love some one you tell then ever thing before some else tell because it is Better if they by you then if some one tell so tell him whatever he don't know|`|82388b0078348e0dd7d5a4f4001f503eaa	well not everything! but should know all your Secret..|`|8e9718a3714dc906919f4f8f94450b65aa	I don't think it's necessary to tell everything about you to the other person. Like what happened before you met this person or about your past boy or girlfriends or anything is none of your new love's business unless he asks and you want to answer. Unless it's something about your health or something that could affect the other person.|`|djUMvICoaa	Secrets are the biggest killers of a relationship that I know of.  If you are carrying around something that big, it better be known if you think your relationship is going to go anyplace.  How is this going to be good for either of you if things progress for a couple of years and then it comes out?  Relationships are open and honest.  Without that you are building  a future on a lie. If they love you you will be able to work through it.|`|y8JQFCFtaa	I would Say "YES",cause then you will find out if the person really loves you to,if he accepts you for who you are....Even with you darkest secrets!!...;-)<br>  <br>  If the person leaves you because you told him the truth,the relationship would have lasted that long as well,cause if he/she finds out at a later stage that you didn't tell him the honest true,its going to result in an argument which can cause long term problems for you both...|`|CkpzuduCaa	well i felt bad back then. we were neighbors. we couldn/t get along. we broke up early in 74 or 75. in 1984. i watched iowa girls state bb on tv. <br>  she was a brunette.  she was miss basketball of iowa. ok kris huffman. but my ex and i. we buried the hatchet in march 2001. kris and i. only had 2 arguments.  we brokeup once. now were back together again.  were gonna love each other. down the road ahead. now were getting along very wonderful now.|`|nAGWojTVaa	i dont think they should know absolutely everything, but if something comes up to where they will end up knowing anyway then i would tell them.|`|Xmp4261Xaa	only if he asks or you feel guilty holding something in.

zGFiWSPtaa	Take away all distractions, find somewhere you can relax and work well ( i need to be comfy when I work, so I work on my bed, some people need a more disciplined environment so they use a clean desk). Make sure you have all your supplies needed before you start so you don't interrupt your work running around trying to find stuff. Don't give in to listening to music, going on the computer, calling/texting people, watching TV etc. Also, if you have a lot of things to remember, make a list so you don't forget!!!! Then cross them off as you finish! GOOD LUCK!!!|`|AA11441704	break down the tasks and deal one thing at  a time.

The areas that you were kissing or whatever are very sensitive and so the feeling for her was immense and many women react in different ways.

Well I won't lie and tell you that what u did was wrong.  See , any relationship , is always based on TRUST RESPECT AND LOVE.  Actually you're feeling that way , cause aside from the guilt , you also violated your respect within yourself . <br>  <br>  But don't worry , things like this happen. It is a lesson that you have learned.  The good news is your CONSCIENCE is alive! It's not DEAD!<br>  <br>  I say move on with it, and just remember never to do it again.<br>  Self respect is something that is priceless. When u grow up<br>  you will understand it yourself.

Simply is.
8NTXSKRiaa	YOu need to ask yourself these questions! Are the jokes harmful to you? Is she doing in to hurt you or just to joke around..

Maybe she does it in a lovingly way, that's possible.  Talk to her first before you make any drastic changes.|`|4ef505315e6714cd6a174d1beb0546f0aa	Maybe you should, for her sake. What it must be like to be in a relationship with someone as self-conscious as you...<br>  <br>  Is it a kidding around making fun of you, or is she verbally abusive? There's a big difference. <br>  <br>  If she's playing, stop being such a crybaby. Be strong and confident, no matter how long it carries out. It's ok to tell her when you're not really in the mood to kid around.<br>  <br>  If she's serious, stand up for yourself and let her know abuse will not be tolerated. Drop her immediately if she starts to become blatantly disrespectful.|`|9QyrW2iCaa	First of all you need to communicate to her that you don't like this behavior/what she says and tell her how it makes you feel.  Ask her why she is doing this.  Then once you've talked about it and you've told her why you don't like it -- like feeling disrespected for one -- it may be time to move on.

i10Dl2Staa	The answers you've received so far are pretty bad. <br>  This is a very normal scenario. The woman on to position, the woman has control over the pressure, movement of her clitoris on you.<br>  IT"S THE CLITORIS, <br>  Let me tell you that this is the most important part (besides the mind), of turing on a woman. I would google 'how to please a woman' and you will get plenty of info to sift through.<br>  But my advice is this. Let her show you with your hand on top of hers, how she touches herself. This would be considered foreplay. Also, tell her you would like to know if something feels particularly good.<br>  I highly advise you learn how to go down on her. Everyone likes this. Using your finger/fingers inside of her, like your pointer finger in a 'come here' motion, is allegedly where the g-spot is. If you do that while you are using your tongue lightly on her clit, she will go crazy.<br>  There are so many technique information tips online, it's limitless.<br>  I like the website 'Ask Men' dot com. Look under 'sex and dating' for many articles on this. They are very specific. <br>  It's also a good idea to get a vibrator to use with eachother.|`|6e9wMh6yaa	dude just keep it hard and THRUST|`|EsVjwKPAaa	do lots of foreplay.|`|LYeMqJIRaa	When she is on top she can control the movement/friction to get the stimulation she needs.  Many women do not get the stimulation they need through intercourse alone  they need a lot of foreplay (oral/manual etc.)  You need to take your time and concentrate on her bodys reaction to different techniques (We've been together 16 years and I am still learning)<br>  <br>  My wife swears by this stuff too.   It helps her reach orgasm much more quickly and she says it is more intense<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.zestra.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.zestra.com/</a>|`|jROpVbrhaa	More foreplay, touch her sensitive parts.|`|jw6OjQkEaa	hmmmmmmmmm i think ur GF have sick

Perhaps disclosing their feelings, if unreciprocated might drive your closeness to them away...<br>  Or perhaps, you have been too caring in such a way that they sense your brotherly pressence more than that of a romantic one (hey that could be a hint, you lucky!)<br>  Perhaps.. perhaps.....perhaps - you should make the first move & tell the girl you fancy that you wish to protect her like a brother, but love her like a lover... common... it's better to get a negative answer than to feel frustrated over unresolved one.. BEST LUCK! :)
2uXdXMO9aa	i know how you feel.TOTALLY<br>   i had a best friend, and we couldnt keep in touch because i moved<br>  <br>  then she just acted all weird. and i know whats going through your mind hun<br>  ' why is she doing this to me, i havent done anything wrong!'<br>  <br>  but you know what the best thing to do? sit down with her, and just talk. i mean , as you say you used to be very very close, so you can try to understand eachother and listen and stuf. try to arrange one day where you can visit her and just talk. Or call her phone, just any way you can talk to her. <br>  <br>  and just gently tell her, i feel that theres something between you and me thats stopping us from being friends again. are you mad at me? or did i do something wrong? but be very gentle and dont act asif your havng a go at her. thats the worst thing to do.<br>  <br>  you will be releived when you find out the answer. just take you time until you find the courage to confront her.<br>  <br>  your obviously care about your friendship alot enoguh to ask this tough wuestoin. your a very kind hearted person remember that, you care alot about her and you just want her and you to be happy. well done hun, so whatever happens dont put yourself down. your the person in the right in this situation. because if this girl is trying to avoid you, your ont loosing a friend, shes loosing an amazing caring friend<br>  <br>  i know it hurts, it really does, but this is all a learning experience in life.<br>  <br>  its hard to let go if she carries on like this, but its life. not everything in life is fair. i remeber when i was about 5 everything was amazing. i had a very close friend and my family was so ahppy and everything was lalala.  but as soon as i hit puberty everything tends to wiggle out. but like i said, its life.<br>  <br>  im sorry about your situation hun. good luck, im sure you will pull through.<br>  <br>  :) xx|`|pLkeooJ1aa	Well, you sound like a mature 14 year old.

That has helped me so many times- it takes some guts, but is normally worth it. Tell her exactly how it is, and if she feels that she doesn't want to be your friend after it- it's her loss. She shouldn't let guys rule her life.Friendship is more valid.She may be trying to grow up too quickly, or is experiencing peer pressure? Sometimes phases like this could be fuelled by a problem that the person doesn't know how to deal with. <br>  <br>  I wish you all the luck, and I hope I helped?<br>  <br>  Oh, and about the fact that your friend is overweight- I don't think that has anything to do with the amount of guys she should or shouldn't get.<br>  <br>   ''It doesn't matter what size a girl is, as long as she is confident she is sexy'' - Paris Hilton.<br>  <br>  Us girls should be judged by the size of our hearts, not the size of our jeans.<br>  <br>  xoxox|`|Qq95lN4xaa	I'm fourteen too and whoa she's been dating a lot of guys. I guess the only way for you to help her is to try to talk her out of her habit, but nicely, so she won't be so irritated. Why don't you try talking to her mom without her knowing? It's really not good for girls to go out and date every single guy that probably just want to touch her. You're in the right path and probably the only one who can help her. And you should too. Why don't you try to set her up with a good boy? A friend in need is a friend indeed.

Men are usually pretty pathetic.  They will sleep with anything to get their kicks, regardless of what the gal looks like.<br>  <br>  She is much too young to be sleeping around and disaster is going to strike any day now.  <br>  <br>  Tell her she is much too trusting with the boys she meets.  She is setting herself up for failure.  If you're not on board with her ways, just tell her up front.  She will love you or hate you for it.  But at least it will get the issue out in the open.

It's your duty to take care of yourself, if you are going to worry about him too much you aren't going to do a good job of taking care of yourself.

i10Dl2Staa	Sounds like your friends are, unfortunately, not having positive sexual experiences. Sex is not supposes to 'hurt' at at. AT ALL. I had my first sexual experience a week before my 16th birthday with a steady boyfriend. I wanted it to happen, and was ready. It was great. I find a lot of people I talk to, this was not the case. I find that this also set the tone for the rest of their life!! Seriously, you have got to make sure it is a nice man who knows it's your first time and is gentle and knowledgable about when a woman is ready for sex, You should have many dates of just kissing, etc before the sex. And you should want it and feel ready. <br>  Having a man inside you is the sexiest feeling. It feels delicious, for lack of a better explanation. When a man has his fingers inside you, it's kind of like that, but a more whole, complete feeling. <br>  Make sure you know how to work your own clitoris and you should masturbate either with your man and/or alone to know this to know what turns you on..the right pressure, etc. I highly advise you to purchase a vibrator.|`|IH0kLuwZaa	it feels like every nerve in your lower body is being touched in the best way. when they go too deep it feels like somethings is ur stomach that hurts for the girl but feels great to the guy hope i helped and its a great thing that ur saving urself good luck and be strong its well worth the wait...with the right guy|`|bFF02ezDaa	it feels so good first 3 times it kinda hurts the first time is a b@!%$<br>  but if u have had sex more then like 5 times it feels sooooo good|`|b71715958f2a0048f90fb2dbde344a83aa	It hurt the first couple of times.

3ab0562924ae58daee1fe664ccc36a9daa	Your making it sound as if a bomb is going to go off in 5 hours and what you should do about it..lol.<br>   First and fore most you should be sure he is the one you want to give that part of yourself to, not just someone you really like at the moment, when all the right feelings are there you shouldn't have to ask if it will hurt or not. And if hes the right guy he wouldn't pressure you into having sex with him in any way shape or form. If your having any signs that you may regret it after words, don't do it!  Make sure this is really what YOU want don't think about what he really wants.<br>   Sex is so much better when the guy is truly in love with you and your truly in love with him and there are no regrets after words.|`|DbVOtAIBaa	well its quite possible that your hymen is already split if you had been atheletic, say in sports and stuff or maybe even if you rode a bike. Its quite a possibility that you might of used finger before which could lead to splitting of your hymen.<br>  My point here is.....maybe its not going to pain at all. Even if its still intact....it will be a small pain...but just tell your man to go slow in that case....I hope you both feel comfortable while getting intimate...which will help the act be more lovey, pleasing and less uncomfortable.<br>  <br>  Wishing Your Boyfriend Very Happy Birthday..

3r1TwMCQaa	When you are doing it because it's something you want to do, not because you've been pressured into it. I can't really put an age to your question because there is no "right age" however I will say that the majority of people who have sex their first time are too young when they do it.|`|6F32sfLeaa	21|`|hN08l7tLaa	21.|`|VvNKTFhJaa	When you feel you are ready.

As long as both involved respect each other and know what they are getting into (as in STD risks etc) then age doesn't really matter. So a 14 year old couple that genuinely care for each other and are smart enough to understand what sex really means then I personally see no wrong. However two 14 year olds at a party who decide to **** cos they think each other is hot and feel pressured to have sex like all their friends, then no, that is wrong.|`|Ri0y2kVqaa	Personally i think whenever you feel ready and comfortable with your partner to do this, don't do it just because everyone else is because they will all regret it when they are older if they rushed into things. Always use protection (:|`|8udo6hImaa	as soon as you know about protection and consequences and you feel it is time i dont think there is a specific age that is ok..|`|dJoE8yedaa	Wait at least till 16.

You have a physical and emotional attraction but that isn't enough.  Give it time to develop into love and you will  know.  Don't let physical attraction carry you away.  Let your relationship develop into something great where you can have a best friend and good companion.  So, get married when you are both ready.|`|AA11846495	You should judge on what you feel, if you feel emotionally and physically attracted to someone then id say go for it, if its only emotionally, try speaking to them and telling them that before you make such a bold move as marriage, the same with if its only physical.<br>  <br>  Here's an interesting article i found, which may not be completely relevant, but its basically say the finical advantages to being in a couple or living with someone, (i don't mean to force money into the equation, but with the credit crunch and all i thought it might be  of general interest [Iv linked it as a source])|`|dOPYcWj0aa	the whole package. Of course you need to be attracted to them and of course you need to have an emotional bond to the person, they are like the criteria. Having said that, its not all roses.

It may be less intense in one area now but become more special in another.  In our society we often think "marriage" because that's what we saw our parents do, and many of them at a fairly young age.<br>  <br>  As you take the time to explore one another in as many ways as are appropriate to you the questions you asked will be answered.<br>  <br>  In short, there's no "magic" formula.

aKpIuNAFaa	ok heres the deal, its called the golden rule, if you had this guy as your boyfriend, would you want someone else sleeping with him? i don't think so, so if this guy is so great, why is he asking you to do something less than moral? secondly you're only 16, and you're worried about getting pregnant, there is only ONE way to stop from getting pregnant for sure, don't have sex, that also stops you from getting STD's, if you're not ready for the possibility of kids, then you shouldn't be having sex, PERIOD. if the big thing really is just losing your virginity, you say yourself it should be with someone special, and if thats what you think, you're right, BUT you're WAY too young to be able to say you know what love is, you need to wait, later in life you'll look back on this time and say, WHAT WAS I THINKING!?|`|0ef4b766bd32e9ac6d5202e8c84e53d9aa	you should absolutely not sleep with this guy the way things are right now. it really sounds like he is just using you because he knows how you feel about him, and he wants to sleep with you. but even if he has genuine feelings for you, then you should wait until the two of you are together. if you ever lose your virginity to someone whom isn't special, or whom abuses your trust in any way, you will regret it, so wait until you know he wants to be with you for you, not just for your body.|`|hN08l7tLaa	obviously NO. he has a girlfriend, and never left her b4, what makes you think that he'll leave her for good when u give in? and pls, u are only 16, dont say like you're old enough to understand things. think about it, dont regret after ur decision is made. it's ur life that u are going to live.|`|x0J8S5sWaa	NO, you should not. Even if I don't point out that in my personal opinion sex is for marriage only, this guys is obviously a jerk if he's planning on cheating on his girlfriend. An honest worthy guy wouldn't do that...he should just break up with his girlfriend if she's cheating on him. Also, you obviously do not know enough about sex or it's possible consequences. You can still get pregnant if he wears a condom and you can still get an STD. Wait till you are ready, goodluck! And have sex with someone who truly cares about you and wait till you are in a relationship.|`|Ri0y2kVqaa	Thats your choice no1 else can answer that, only you know how you feel, but as he is your bestfriend you need to think about what will happen afterwards, will it ruin your friendship with him? and if the condom breaks then theres a chance of becoming pregnant, and you made it sound as if you don't want to by writing " should i give in..." <br>  x|`|yWnAPyK9aa	this is being 16yrs you don't know what you want and having sex before you know you love them and you know he loves you.sex is all he wants!so i would not it will ruin it if he is not into you and you not into him.personally i would never give him sex|`|QXcbS8C1aa	does he have an STD? if he does, dont even risk it..<br>  yes a condom, always.<br>  <br>  yeah if he is your best friend i would. i lost mine to my best friend, and im not dating her anymore but we are still the best of friends.|`|Ed6oxtUTaa	as a guy who wants love more then anything, my adice to you is to stay virgin untill you know he loves you, and if he loves you he wont expect you to have sex with him.  Im not sure if i know what love feels like.. maybe i do maybe i dont... but i do know that love is the most powerful feeling in the world, better then sex. And if the girl i love didnt want to have sex, its her choice, not mine.  The thing that i keep in mind is, at the end (when youre all old and wrinkly) youre not going to be having sex anymore, so the only way to be happy is if you have a loving relationship with them.  Dont be the person that regrettes their life then they turn 50.|`|nU9cilZ1aa	If you don't already know the answers to these questions then you are way too unprepared to "give up your innocence".. a condom is a great first start but maybe you should see about some birth control. You're 16 and the stats on younger people do show that most of them have had their first sexual experience by that age but there isn't anything that says you have to be one of them. You need ask yourself why you are even thinking about this. Is it because he asked you and you want to try to keep him interested in you or are is there something else going on?|`|9701f5a04b0788301d3119e00ccedc0aaa	Do you understand NO.  He has a gf .

dsqm0x9Waa	i have too been through this experience, but made a huge mistake. i said no and regreted it till this very day. i think the reason we say no but think yes is because we don't know what that person is going to think about us. we have no clue if there going to say, 'you suck'<br>  or 'thanks a bunch!' it's really a 50, 50 chance. the anwser is always a mystery. hope i helped!|`|jp5lfmzTaa	The most complex creation of nature is homosapean females.|`|DybOqfGpaa	ago may b !!1|`|Vq1pCqMuaa	its nt nly ur prob<br>  situation is same everywhere <br>  gals are made to behave like this <br>  in our culture or we could say their mind is  made to set up to behave like this <br>  <br>  rest is we could say gals <br>  they are unsolved mistry <br>  their is famous saying <br>  god created himself he was happy<br>  he created man he laugh<br>  he created gal neither god nor man could understand her for rest <br>  mistry still continues|`|DVRSCYU1aa	y ru bothred , u may nt be fit for certain things in life ,dats y u did nt achieve it|`|dJoE8yedaa	They end up getting the worst men after they turn down a good one.

qvMYsDtZaa	Yes, all marriages have their problems and in healthy ones both spouses have a mutual interest and commitment to one another and the quality of their relationship.  Husbands and wives who relate to one another within respectful boundaries of good marriages  will recognize potential problems as they begin to develop and they are willing to work together on eliminating those problems.  Marriages are like like cars, when you want them to last and run well, you take the time and effort to fine-tune them on a regular basis....you don't ignore the oil change light just because your car hasn't produced enough symptoms to conclude the engine is damn near blown! .....You need to see that your husband (poor upbringing or not) is disrespectful to you at the very least and is actually verbally and mentally abusive.  You may not realize it but women who suffer from the affects of that kind of abuse don't even accept that they are being abused.  Total denial.  See a therapist yourself  even if he won't go with you, so that you can come out of the coma you're in and wake up to all the symptoms of abuse that you don't recognize anymore.  You can't and haven't changed your husband but you can help him to want to explore his unacceptable behavior and, if he truly loves you,  then he will make changes in himself.  No, it doesn't sound like you  have typical marital problems, but it does sound like you both love each other very deeply and no doubt, could enjoy a much happier and secure marriage if the two of you decide to work on it..... <TOGETHER> <br>  Your chatting at all on line with another man, knowing your husband would disapprove, is disrespectful, dishonest and a slight measure of unfaithfulness as well.  But, of course and not surprisingly, you don't see those symptoms for what they are either.  Good luck.|`|AA10075228	You will ruin whatever good you have in your marriage if you keep on flirting on the internet.  You have NO idea what the person you are talking with on the internet is really like, it can be a very disturbing surprise if you meet someone in this manner.  You sound like in all honesty that you are very unhappy in your marriage.  Maybe you should try to seek counseling to save your marriage.  If you want to continue the way you have been in your marriage, stay away from permanent relationships with other unknown people on line.|`|b3zGfYMpaa	I highly reccommend marriage counseling. You were right in saying that alot of married couples have their issues and from time to time those couples are better off seeking the services provided in order to address and solve those issues rather than contiously argue over the same things and or pretend that the problem itself does not exist.<br>  <br>  It seems as though your husband does have a problem with expressing love and affection if he needs to show his care by buying you things. Subconsciously, I think your husband knows this to some degreee and perhaps that is why he gets stressed over money situations and than later takes it out on you. You are lucky in that you have an otherwise great relationship, but why not improve it if you can help? If this problem continues you may only end up feeling worse later on and you dont want these problems to come out in other negative ways..that is why it is better to adress the problem with your husband first and than suggest counseling. <br>  <br>  Since your husband is able to talk highly of you to others than hes not afraid of showing how important you are to him, plus he already knows that he treats you unfairly. With that said, he shouldnt have that much of a problem putting the extra effort in and attending counseling sessions with you if he knows its going to better your marriage. A marriage counselor will be able to give you tips, advice, and excercises that the both of you can use to over come these obstacles. I hope that you take my advice and use it to both you are your husband's advantage.|`|20LnuCejaa	You are not alone.  This happens in a lot of marriages.  The husband will treat his wife as if she is a moron, where in fact she is not.  After a while the wife will start to believe she is inferior, where in fact she is not.  Men who do this are very insecure about their own abilities.  If they put their wife down, it makes them feel better and superior to their wife.  So....don't count on him taking the hint or changing his ways unless he becomes secure with himself.|`|6cm6MB66aa	It all sounds like a normal marriage to me . Guys are grumpy most of the time the ones that care are . I kind of enjoyed your story and was happy that there is normal couples still out there until i got to the part that you was talking contacting flirting with another guy this kind of ticked me off and i don't even know you . I can imagine how it made your husband feel . Just hope you don't turn into one of those flirty married woman that fall into bull crap of a womanizer such as the one you was speaking to . Don't say he was just a nice guy you yourself admits that he was starting to have feelings for you but what you don't realize this is what the perpetrator was looking for all along . The guy did know you was married as you stated but still trying for you . Please don't say it was Innocent . And stop trying to make your husband jealous he may take it wrong someday and he may find himself in the arms of another woman that understands what he is going through with your male friends .|`|AA10240683	No one is perfect therefore, no marriage can be perfect. His verbal abuse probably does come from some conditioning that happened to him or was exposed to growing up. ( His dad may have verbally abused his mom and his mom took it, therefore he is conditioned to think it is normal). At any rate, this kind of behavior should ot be tolerated by you, you deserve respect as a person, human being, his wife. It is tough for a person to change, but his behavior in verbal abuse should change, especially for the kids who may see and hear this.|`|AA11066099	Ok  from a outside point of view your husband is meant to be your equal! Sounds like a bully to me and you do  not sound like a happily married woman at all.Obv he wouldn't need to mention divorce because everything is going his way  and you comply to his demands and behave the way he wants you to!He sounds like a male chauvinist and a moron.x|`|HL8PEDFLaa	No, this is not typical marriage problems. He is a jerk off and you need to stand up for yourself or leave. Who cares if he's had a bad childhood? It doesn't mean that he can treat other people, especially his wife, like an idiot|`|AA11972752	You're right, all marriages have problems, and you work it out with each other. Nothing and nobody is perfect, but the point is that you're supposed to try to make yourself and your lives together better.<br>  <br>  My husband can be mean and petty like that sometimes too. At first, he didn't recognize that was the wrong way to go about things. He would say, "I'm just telling the truth." He didn't understand that sometimes the issue is not the content - for example, if you want to give advice on how to wash dishes, that's fine, but sticking an insult or two in with the advice is going beyond just telling the truth. You can state the truth in a kinder way that takes into account you're talking to someone you love, and you will still be telling the truth!<br>  <br>  After a separation and marriage counseling over this and other issues, my husband has finally figured out that he was wrong to talk to me like that. He's gotten better about that and it doesn't happen as often as it used to. Whenever he slips back into the habit of being mean to get his point across, he remembers that he's wrong to act that way and apologizes. And that's the important difference. I would find it intolerable if my husband were mean to me and he couldn't see how that was the wrong way to handle it. When you love someone, your first instinct should not be to say things in as mean of a way as possible to them.<br>  <br>  Your husband does these things, though, and he seems unapologetic about it. Your marriage has problems, but your husband isn't willing to work out those problems with you. That's above and beyond the typical marriage problems. In the typical marriage, you should have both 1) the problems and 2) the willingness to work out those problems. As soon as your husband can muster up the second characteristic of a typical marriage, then you can say that this is typical marriage problems.<br>  <br>  To respond to your additional details, I was not suggesting that your marriage was completely negative. It's fantastic that you can see the positive aspects, because it makes it easier to speak about this issue with him. He won't feel as threatened if you can throw in a bunch of positive things about him, too. However, this being mean is an obvious issue, and it's something that money and presents won't make up for. It's something that needs to be worked on. Hopefully you find some way to make him realize this, because him being mean to you at home only makes things miserable. I'm glad he doesn't put you down in front of others, but you spend more time at home with him and so how he interacts with you then matters too. It sounds like you're trying to brush it off, and pretend it doesn't matter to you, but it does matter to you. You went online to talk to other people in a desperate attempt to find some normal interaction (i.e., interaction with people that don't want to put you down at every turn). What you don't see is that you shouldn't have to do that! You should be able to solve this problem at home. Stop ignoring it and pretending it doesn't matter. Tell your husband that this is an issue and you need to work on this together.<br>  <br>  He may not know how to interact in a better way right now, but he is still alive and breathing, so to me that means that he can still *learn* something as important as this. "Upbringing" can only be a temporary excuse, an obstacle to overcome, but it cannot be the permanent excuse.|`|aDhZIhQcaa	I can tell you a lot about your marriage, I was in one earlier in my life that was just like yours.  And your husband, I believe, has the same problem that my ex had.  For one thing, your husband is very insecure with himself.  That is why he puts your down in front of others, makes you the brunt of his jokes, and makes you feel stupid.  This is because he is all of those.  Your husband is making himself feel superior at your expense.  That is called emotional and verbal abuse, and it tells your soul down and breaks you spiritually over time without you even realizing it.  He was probably raised by a very controlling and abusive father or mother and his behaviour is ingrained in him.  But the sad thing is, you trained him to believe that you would tolerate such behaviour from him by letting him continually berate you and emotionally rape you.  That may sound harsh, but think about it, you are feeling raped, even if it is emotional.  Your self esteem is in the toilet and you continually blame yourself or try to change to please him.  Trust me, no matter how much or often you change to make him proud of you, he will never appreciate you because you never commanded his respect in the first place.  And what is even sadder, your children are being shown the example of what a marriage is all about, in the wrong way, of course, and they are going to grow up to treat their spouses with the same disrespect or if you have a daugher, she will take the abuse too.  Is that what you want?  You need to learn to love yourself, again, and not put up with this treatment.  Find yourself again and show your children that their mother is not a doormat and that no one should treat another human being the way you have been treated.  Only you have the power to gain control over your life.  You seem lost and lonely, and I feel for you.  You are groping around in the dark trying to find the light that your husband turned off.  It is so sad and I will be praying for you and your children.|`|bEJHO123aa	I've had a little trouble like that myself. my husband and i have very different ways of getting things done, and very different political/social views. So a lot of the time he belittles me and treats me like a little girl because i dont do things HIS way. I'm trying to stick up for myself as much as i can. I constantly have to remind him that my way of doing things is not inferior and that loving me means loving all of me. So i think you should stick up for yourself and ask that he treats you with respect. <br>  <br>  But as far as the online chatting goes, that is what we call an emotional affair and it is just as harmful to your marriage as a sexual affair.|`|bIimm8fSaa	You were right when you said all marriages has it's problems.  And if anyone says differently, they are a liar.  Reason so, no one is perfect.  The two of you didn't find someone perfect, you just found someone perfect for you.  And he does these things because he is use to it.  You have let him for so many years.  What you need to do is sit down alone with him when you are going to have a few hours and no interruptions and talk to him.  Let him know how these things bother you.  Let him know they hurt you.  Chances are, you may hear some things that bother him as well.  If he talks so highly of you, he loves you.  No question about that.  But as you said, he didn't have a good childhood and maybe he isn't sure how to treat someone he loves.  As for divorce, I don't think your marriage is anyplace close to divorce.  But....if you weren't thinking it, you wouldn't have said it.  Sorry.  But that isn't the answer for the two of you.  Communication is.  Seriously, talk to him.  Be completely open with him.  But be willing to listen as well.  And then work on it.  Good luck.|`|dSMb8JDvaa	Ok..this my old friend story...She came to live in a new country and work very young. Collect all the money, in love with the man but have to bring him to the country, paid a lot of money to help him. Protect him everything and fight a lot, he was a play boy and gambling, behind her he has a girlfriends and kids, she found out but couldn't do anything love him so much. Has kid with him, business went down, she broght it back again with all the money she got(by eat very small, unheathy food, tried to save money) Business going good..but then she found out she got cancer..and now she is dead. Her husband get every things and end up have a lot of girlfriend and kids.|`|jBigEy0Caa	You need to constantly work at your marriage.  I would sit him down, without the kids & let him know exactly how you feel.  Bring up the good points about your marriage too, so it doesn't seem like you are saying it is all bad.  Ask him how he would feel if you would say some of the things to him that he says to you (give him examples using his words).  If he doesn't see the problem, go see a marriage counselor.  This has already escalated to you talking to another man, and if he continues to demean you it may go further than a phone conversation and then you will have serious problems.|`|0DyWTwYFaa	It would appear that he only knows one way to treat you and that he is very limited in his people skills owing to lack of exposure to the correct way people should be treated. <br>  <br>  Your flirtation on the internet , irrespective or what you intended, would have really hurt someone who is limited like your husband. Stop it.|`|DzTCqXRVaa	Good for you, Bunny.<br>  <br>  Sounds like a marriage like many others.  You're absolutely right when you say it takes work and it's not perfect.  But the bottom line is that you've stuck with it. <br>  <br>  It's kind of a shame that your husband is as intense about some things but I agree with you that he is probably a product of his upbringing.<br>  <br>  I admire the simple fact that, at the end of the day, you're still committed to your marriage.  <br>  <br>  And finally, to answer your question, yes, other people's relationships are in many ways similar to yours.<br>  <br>  I just wish that people would/could have a bit more respect for their partners and find a way to show it.<br>  <br>  Best wishes.|`|b2444f35a7f9696e20acbb1687b47466aa	First issue: <br>  Yes there are other couples out there that have similar situations.  And it goes both ways - the man calling the woman names, and the woman calling the man names, and sometimes both calling each other names.  <br>  It may not be "normal" but for some people it seems to work.  <br>  I'll give an example: a guy I work with is always praising his wife to us saying she is the best thing that ever happened to him, etc., BUT I have heard him on the phone with her and he talks to her like she is a child.  You know, like telling her that she should be doing whatever she is doing a different way, or why is she doing that when she should be doing this.  That kind of stuff. I don't really know how he treats her in a public setting. So, you are not alone in that situation. Do you think that your husband says good things about you when you aren't around to hear them? <br>  <br>  Second issue:  <br>  Yes, it is nice to talk to somebody who says nice things about you (and to you). <br>  However, if your husband told you to stop, and he finds out that you didn't (completely), he might ... well I don't know what he might do since I don't know him, (or you for that matter). <br>  I think you are right by saying that married people can talk and even do mild flirting, but you must pull back when it seems to be getting more than that.  <br>  Is it wrong?  Technically, maybe, but everybody does it to some extent, right? Do you think that he would admit it if he were doing the same thing? Or stop if you told him to? <br>  <br>  You seem intelligent to me from what you wrote here.  You can use correct spelling and grammar and punctuation, (unlike a lot of  people on here). And from this I conclude that he should not be so critical of you. But I have no control of this. <br>  <br>  But if you say you are both satisfied with your life together (for the most part), then just talk to him about how it hurts your feelings when he says bad things about you.  Maybe he just can't take a hint - tell him straight out. And when he does it right, reward him with something you know he likes. <br>  You know the old carrot and stick method. <br>  However, if he's been like this for 15 years, don't expect too much too soon. <br>  I don't know if I've been any help, but good luck. <br>  ======================================...|`|sePbIUXiaa	Talk to your husband, Really talk sit him down and tell him how you feel, if you have this soul connection. He already knows something is not right, Speak from a place of Love and ask him to listen with love get it all out then agree on  signals when he is stepping over the line in public use a word to bring him back. Work that out together. And promise when you need someone to talk to it is him. Stay off line, chatting with a strange man online while you are married is unfair to your husband, Stop it if you want friends make them out in the open.<br>  Do not compromise your husbands trust for a stranger, ever. Be as kind to him as you expect him to be to you. Talk and share get it out in the open where you and he can work on this together with Love.

Maybe shes bit angry too because you never said yes you liked her, but kept annoying .

But yea my main suggestion is to let her go<br>  <br>  hope it helped :)

7TLdeHFmaa	maybe he still thinks your not ready, because you said when you guys made out you got terrified, that might of made him want to take it slow, and about him not saying the same things I think that he thinks that saying those things is rushing it, don't worry though, he loves you because he's still with you.

aDhZIhQcaa	Oh Lord, I feel for your mom.  I, too, went through almost the same thing after my late husband died.  He didn't cheat on me but what he did do was worse.  He violated the sanctity of our marriage, and left me to clean up the mess.  I found the best way to handle it was to surround myself with people who love me and would let me vent my pain.  4 months after he died, I than, closed my door, shut off my cell phone, and talked with no one the entire month of October.  It was just me and God.  I read my Bible and prayed and cried, until God revealed a lot to me about what had happened.  I found forgiveness for my husband and than closure.  It was liberating and I was freed from the bondage that my husband put me in.  But I also found myself again, without him.  Your mom needs to learn to love herself, by herself and for herself.  And she shouldn't take the affair her husband had, personally.  And that is what she is doing, taking it personally.  She is asking herself what was wrong with her and what could have done to prevent her husband from cheating.  Sometimes there is nothing a wife can do.  She needs to accept that and heal her heart.  Your mom's self confidence has been sucked right out of her and has left her wondering if she ever knew her husband.  And that hurts her tremendously.  Tell her she shouldn't take it personally, a lot.  Comfort her, be there to listen no matter how much she may repeat something.  Just listen.  Over time, her anger, fear, and pain will ease up.  Just think about how bad her husband was feeling about what he had done and in laying there dying, there was nothing he could do to change what happened.  But she needs to find forgiveness for her husband to obtain closure.  But help her love herself and maybe even get counseling.  But a great emotional support system of friends and family is the best thing for her right now.  God bless you both and good luck

AA11102015	Emotional cheating can be difficult to wrap your mind around. It’s not like a “real” affair (with intercourse) or a “sort-of-but-not-really” affair (everything but the intercourse). Emotional infidelity doesn't necessarily break spoken vows, create unwanted pregnancies, or spread sexually transmitted diseases. Emotional cheating can't always be spotted in the traditional ways.<br>  <br>  Emotional infidelity can be as devastating to a marriage or partnership as sexual unfaithfulness - if not more so. Determining the difference between harmless flirting versus cheating is important to a healthy relationship.<br>  <br>  Don’t forget what brought you together in the first place. It’s so easy to forget why we fell in love. Emotional cheating can make you forget why you love your partner in the first place.<br>  <br>  Figure out your ideal healthy relationship. How do you want to be treated by your partner? What makes you feel loved and respected? To survive an emotional affair, envision your ideal healthy relationship, and make a list of the small steps that create that relationship. Share this list with your partner - and don’t be afraid of ultimatums or being left alone. Being single is a far better option than being in a relationship that causes you pain, anxiety, frustration, and confusion.<br>  <br>  Keep your expectations realistic. You won’t be able to completely forget about the emotional affair, but you can stop nourishing your mistrust, hurt, and suspicious thoughts. That means accepting your partner at her word, if she says she’s left the past behind and is focused on building a strong relationship with you. To survive an emotional affair, you need to nourish healthy growth.<br>  <br>  Understand and respect each other’s perspective. What does your partner need from you and your relationship? What do you need? To survive an emotional affair, be honest with each other. Don’t try and change your partner; instead, try and understand her.<br>  <br>  Practice forgiveness. This tip for surviving an emotional affair may be the most difficult one. She made a mistake, and it tore at the fabric of your relationship - but that doesn’t mean you both have to pay for it forever! You have to forgive yourself and her- and the same goes for her- in order for you two to move into a successful, healthy relationship. Forgiveness and love is a conscious choice you need to make every day. The more you choose to focus on love, trust, and forgiveness, the easier it gets.<br>  <br>  Consider counseling. Individual or couples counseling will help you figure out the difference between your own insecurities and your partner’s emotional infidelity. Most of the time, emotional cheating or fights between couples aren’t about one specific problem - they’re about issues that already destroying the relationship. To survive an emotional affair, deal with those issues.<br>  <br>  Focus on the present and future - not the past. Focus on becoming more connected emotionally, spending time together, remembering what brought you together in the first place, and building a strong happy relationship. To survive an emotional affair, refuse to stay stuck in the past.<br>  <br>  Focus on rebuilding your love and trust. You need to put the emotional affair behind you, because if you let your jealousy and insecurity affect your relationship, you’ll drive a wedge between the two of you. Marriages are plagued with “a thousand tiny betrayals” - and to prevent those hurts from wrecking your relationship, you need to forgive and let it go.|`|IDrA6gMxaa	It is up to you what will happen next.

Good luck|`|Atp5lOJ6aa	ive been there if you want to chat email me|`|GegQJNzSaa	I had one of those kind of affairs. My best friend was male. He was a friend of my husband too. My husband knew we went fishing together. Most of the time we took our kids and we all had fun. We would go to bed together like once one year.then not at all for a few years. It wasn't a love thing, But we did do alot of flirting. We liked hanging out. The sex wasn't all that,so I guess we just didn't do it. He was never married but had a mean girlfriend. Then one day he was suppose to go to jail and we decided to go ahead and do it. His ex-girlfriend walked in. To make a long story short, neither of us is with the ex's and we are not together because that's not how it was. I'm alone and very happy and he found another mean girl, lol. We are not allowed to be friends cause she came into the picture soon after all hell broke loose and she knows we were friends with benefitss. I miss him,but he was never that important.|`|ObZChw3paa	I don't know, in my mind, someone needs to be 100% committed just like I am.

What she's done is wrong..|`|DuqAsQyqaa	Ask Chirs brown! <br>  no really tell her to stop being a WHORE!|`|ise05jjUaa	The best way to rebuild a loving relationship is to get out of the one you're in right now & find someone else.  You don't deserve this, its been going on for 3 years dude come on don't do this to yourself.  Besides think about this, what if his wife hadn't found out they'd still be seeing one another right now.  Eventually it would turn into sex, move on man that's the best thing you can do.  As far as what's died, the trust & honesty, had she loved you maybe she would have seen him once & realized, I can't do this, I love my husband but obviously she didn't & she continued to do this for 3 years.  And honestly I think she's lying as far as nothing sexual happening, do you honestly believe that this dude just loved her being in his presence for the last 3 years?  If that was me & she didnt' give it up I would have left her long ago, come on now get your thoughts straight.  When a man strays from his wife, it usually has to do with having sex with another  lady otherwise we'd never stray at all if sex wasn't that big of a deal to us.  Dude, yes I know some people are saying she confessed & you should forgive her & try to give her a chance, but think about it like this, 3 years means she's had 1095 days to come clean, it shouldn't have even taken that long.  Maybe she was afraid that his wife would eventually tell you & that's why she confessed, I'm telling you you'd be a fool to continue on with this relationship.
Likst1Mxaa	Mmm.<br>  <br>  I would talk to him about how you feel. If he doesn't respect this or makes no moves to move out then I would look at ending your relationship.<br>  <br>  also, your best friend sounds like a total b!tch. I'd find a new best mate. Girls just shouldn't do that to one another.<br>  <br>  Sorry this has happened to you... similar things have happened to me and it hurts like hell, but you will get thru it.|`|WAEDIWz8aa	omg hun!!!<br>  <br>  i feel sorry for you! i would definately feel the same way.<br>  <br>  they r doing this on purpose. they obviously like him, and the other girl want him to be with her. and honestly girls like that, will do anything to get him.<br>  <br>  tell him that you r not feeling comfortable. the best way is to talk and tell him everything that is going through ur mind. hopefully he will understand. why dont u let him live in ur house instead? <br>  <br>  if he still wanna live in his friends house, just be patient, and see how it goes. if it still goes bad, in my opinion, if it was me. id tell him to choose. either live with u, or with her.<br>  <br>  there u can see how kind of answer he comes out with.<br>  <br>  good luck hunnie xx|`|shvhgzXeaa	Tell him if he is not prepared to say anything to them either you will talk to them or your walking out on him. If he knows they feel this way he would have said at least something. Unless he likes the attention and yet seems oblivious to the pain its causing you.|`|Y16olPxlaa	Say you don't feel comfortable with him living there and ask him to move into your house. <br>  Or tell your "best friend" that the way she's acting isn't very appropriate.|`|6wYD6Z7Faa	Well first I have to say the girl is not your friend and she is showing you how much she is not your friend right now.  Well your boyfriend is not totally oblivious to it ok.  He knows what she is doing  so don't think that.  I don't think you have anything to worry about because from the story you tell he seems to be handling it well.  And when it comes to living with a girl guys don't necessarily fall in love with a girl they live with.  She is being a back stabber and if your boyfriend is smart he will see that and not want anything to do with her.  That's what I think about the situation.  What I would do is communicate with him.  But it has to be at the normal rate you have before because he will start to feel like you don't trust him if you start to bug him about it everyday.   So you need to trust him because if you don't you will push him to her.  Because when he can't talk to you he will seek someone else to talk to and she will be there.  And she has showed  you her intentions already.   So be cool and if you feel like something is going on get evidence first before you ask about it.  Don't forget to love him remember you are his girlfriend he chose you over her so keep being that girlfriend he chose.  Keep that line of communication open and if you find it hard to control your jealousy talk to your mother about it first before you talk to him ok so that it will come out right and if you can't talk to mom talk to a friend or someone so that it will come out right and relay the message you want.   Main things is to communicate, stay cool, don't push him away and be yourself the girl he fell in love with.   I am not saying not to be jealous because he has to know it bothers you but don't over kill it.

Remind her how you was her friend even when you got in a relationship with him...you didn't let him get inbetween the two of you... She's on the verge of letting a man get inbetween the two of you|`|19pBM4GSaa	GOD !!!! that's awful !!, i know what id do, my fist would be in the girls face but we all know that would.nt help anything, you need to be honest with yourself and your boyfriend.... if you carry on like this its either going to eat you up inside or something worse will happen. your friend is NOT a friend if she can act this way to you. but i wouldn't even talk to her about this issue as she will see your weakness. you need to tell your boyfriend that your not happy, tell him what you see and make him understand that this cannot happen anymore.  i do think your right that when you say "but when you live with a girl wouldn't it be difficult to NOT start having feelings for her? ", try and get this out in the open with your boyfriend before it gets to late...<br>  <br>  i really do hope this works out for you. all the best xxxx xx|`|5j4n87R2aa	well, find another place for him to stay.tell him you don't want him to stay there.how would he feel if you are staying in his best friend's house , the friend hugs you,the friend buys you new cloths and the friend's mother is trying to get u and his friend together? act past and stand up for urself good luck sis|`|AA10043878	If your boyfriend does not object to what is being said to you and allows it to go on unchecked and uncorrected; then it can only mean one of two things. Either he agrees with the other girl and her Mom and just isn't man enough to "get off the fence" and confront you about it or he doesn't approve of thier actions but feels that he cant be real and say so to them out of fear of being kicked out of the house and ending up homeless.<br>  <br>  Since they are his providers, he has no choice but to go along with them. If he did anything else; then he'd be biting the hand that fed him.<br>  <br>  It sounds to me like this "live in" arrangement wasn't too well thought through before it occurred. But what's done is done.<br>  <br>  What should you do? Have HIM tell the girl and the Mom in your presence to "back off". Tell him that if he wants to keep you then he's got 45 days to find a new address. No excuses and no extensions. 45 days and that's it. If he isn't out by then; drop him!<br>  <br>  That's my advice to you. What would I do if I was in your shoes myself? I have no facts to prove it but I'd say that the reason men are faithful to thier spouses or girlfriends is NOT out of devotion to thier wife/girlfriend; but because they often don't have the opportunity to be unfaithful. Your BF has lots of opportunity here to "check the oil" on two cars! Proof or not I'd assume that he was having sex with the girl and the Mom and end the relationship with him now. IF he really cared about you and wanted to please you then he'd show it by moving out FAST, swearing that nothing happened between him and them and coming to you and asking you to take him back.

Where do you go from here? To whom can you turn? Don't despair. Your future is changed, but not finished. With careful thought and some help, opportunities still lie ahead. <br>  The logical place to begin and confide - of course, is with your parents, as difficult as that may be. You may think your parents will be violently angry, perhaps even to disown you. Expect that they will be hurt at first. Because parents tend to blame themselves when things like this happen, you could hear, "Where have we gone wrong? What did we ever do to deserve this?" Your pregnancy is a crisis in their lives as well as yours. Remember how you felt when you first found out? They will have many of those same feelings. <br>  Many parents will try to take over the decision-making completely. Some may even say, "You're going to have an abortion, and that's final!" They may not mean that — they probably don't. It may just be their initial reaction since they're so used to protecting you. No one can force you to have an abortion against your will. Remember, your parents are in shock as well. Give them time to sort through their feelings A possible way to begin a conversation with them is, "Mom, Dad, I love you, but I've really let you down. I'm sorry to have to tell you this ...."  Then again, maybe you will think it best to speak with one parent at a time, or even take assistance of your brother who will be more supportive than the Guy. <br>  <br>  Your boyfriend may also be in shock Have an open talk with him again, Questions to be asked - Will he stand with you or against you? -Deny everything? -Want to take any responsibility at all? -Or will he be pleased, proud, protective and loving? <br>  What ever his reaction is, it's important for the two of you to be alone when you ask him. He also needs time to sort through his feelings. However, he is not the person to decide finally what to do; that's up to you. If he insists you abort, patiently let him know his opinion is important, but that you are the one carrying the child. Does he still live at home? If so, then could you and your parents, along with him and his, sit down to discuss the situation? If and when the meeting takes place, that is the time to get your feelings out in the open and find out what support you have. In most cases, one set of parents will take a firm stance initially. When you gather together to discuss the problem, all parties involved can gain a clearer perspective of how everyone else thinks and feels. Ask your boyfriend and his parents if they will be responsible for any medical bills. What about the relationship? Will it be continued? This time together will help provide direction for both you and your boyfriend. You may have to prepare yourself for negative reactions from his parents. They may be uncooperative, feeling it's not really their problem. Of course, this isn't fair, but it could happen. You need to be ready in case it does. <br>  IT's UPTO YOU<br>  It is important to remember that there are now two lives to consider. The decision you make in the next few months will affect both of you for the rest of your lives. Sound scary? If your choice is based solely on emotions, it can be. Look at some of the decisions you've made in the past. Did you avoid the issue? Procrastinate? This is definitely one time that won't be possible. You can not put this off at all. Maybe you're the kind of person who sifts through all the possibilities, then stands firm. Or perhaps you're the type who impulsively changes her mind from day to day. <br>  It is dangerous to form your conclusion right away and then spend a lot of time trying to justify it. Unfortunately, some girls have tunnel vision. Their decisions are already made, and they refuse to look at other alternatives. Frequently, they end up changing their decisions at the last minute. The best choice will be one that solves more problems than it creates and the one most agreeable with your lifestyle. <br>  It is possible to make wise decisions if you know the steps to follow: <br>  1. Identify the problem. <br>  2. List alternative courses of action. <br>  3. Gather information helpful in reaching a decision. <br>  4. Consider the consequences of each alternative. <br>  5. Consider the risks in making this decision. <br>  6. Study your values in relation to how you make a decision and carry it out. <br>  7. Reach a conclusion you believe is best. <br>  Identify your goals - What are your goals in regard to education or career training? Have you thought about a vocational or technical school? Or is it more realistic to study for your Graduation Equivalency Diploma? Perhaps even think about completing 9th grade? Do you plan to attend college? <br>  How about employment - What are your aspirations: lawyer, secretary, beautician, social worker, mother? And what about a family? Do you want marriage? Children? Or have you decided to remain single? Have you thought about g|`|qlFEO5xNaa	KAthy <br>  it all depends  on how old  are you and how  you take or new life with a kid to grow alone.

szVvf7Nkaa	Yes I think he's telling you that you are breaking up but he's giving you another chance if you break up your friendship with this other guy. I'm going to be honest with you and I hope you pay attention to what I need to tell you. If you break up your friendship with this other guy then you are a foolish girl. Your boyfriend has no right to ask that of you. You are allowed to have a male friend like he's allowed to have a female friend. Right now what your boyfriend is doing is he's trying to control you and don't let him. You should tell him that you have no intentions of breaking up your friendship with this other guy. And also tell him if he can't accept that then that it's you that's breaking up with him. It's even ridiculous for him to say that he's giving you a second chance. Who does he think he is telling you what you should do or not do? Be smart and don't ever let a boyfriend try to take control of you this way.|`|shvhgzXeaa	It sounds like you have so move on because no guy who truly likes you would make you choose between your friends and him.

Love is sometimes built on trust, and I see most trust in friendship, so maybe it is preferable that you become friendly with him before really making a huge decision on this, that way you'll know him a little better and your judgement will probably be more accurate. Though I'm not sure it will make you seem needy because I've never really seen anybody as so.

I still love a woman I dated over 30 years ago, but I am married (and madly in love with my wife!) - the relationship that was years ago is no more, and I have the maturity now to know it. Things change over time, and there isn't anything anyone can do to change that.<br>  <br>  One thing that you can do is to smell something very pleasant right before you go to sleep - perfume, flowers, some incense. Studies have shown that pleasant smells increase the onset of pleasant dreams. Also, when you go to bed, actually think about what you are going to dream about while you are falling asleep. I know both of these things may sound strange, but try them - hopefully at least one of them will work for you.

YtT9uGOSaa	Because your mother sounds like she has higher expectations out of you.  She feels in her heart and mind that she raised you to be a good girl and the thought of you spending the night at your boyfriend's house just doesn't fit the mold she was working on for you.  Things that you do at your age reflect on her as a mother and it just isn't appropriate for you to be spending the night over at his house regardless of your past sexual relations.  Birth control is not 100 percent effective so do not justify this situation by saying you are taking precautions because when you get pregnant your mother will more than likely have to then support you and your baby.  It's called tough love and she only has your best interests in mind and in time you will realize she is right.|`|s8d7gg5Haa	my mums was the same with my ex <br>  but she lets me if i sleep in different rooms so tell her that :)<br>  x|`|BGY1TX64aa	If you are living at home and dependent upon her for your food, clothing and shelter, you are subject to her rules.

5cKlXUdKaa	This is the question of the year I might say... there is a constant battle between the one niter vs the relationship... I look at it this way...yes a one nite stand can be fun etc...however I equate it to drive thru vs a 5 star restaurant...when it comes down to it which is really more satisfying?  Ok so I like the drive thru, its convenient, I don't have to get out of my car etc... however...how healthy is it?  If I am at a drive thru its usally because I am rushing and don't have time to enjoy what I need..and I am usally still hungry later because I haven't had what my body needs.  A five star restaurant nutures not just my body, but my  mind, my soul and my spirit.  I am respected, I take my time and truly enjoy and cherish what I am given, I savor what I have...I feel satisfied and content because I have given myself the best...<br>  Humans need not just sex to thrive, they need emotional bonds, intimacy, there is tons of research on what happens to  babies when they don't get this...they become very emotionally ill...I think we have opted for drive thrus and are missing out of the fine dining experience of a great relationship..it what makes people not care about who they hurt, what they do and has put our financial world in the crisis we are in...without relationships we would be just like savages getting what we needed and not caring enough about others ...opps ok I am giving a speech...but its truly how I feel..|`|95130278e70b179674702bb6588b3b27aa	Stability, comfortability, having a companion.

Some people react like this and it is very difficult to change them. Another option is some problems she is having you do not know about. So all the anger ends up on you. If this is not the case try to convince her to get some help about how to control your emotions. also if you see the argument is coming, leave the house, or go out to do something in the garden for example.|`|sePbIUXiaa	Is her Love everything to you? or are you everything to you. Because if you are be clear, Hitting will never be acceptable. She needs help for her anger control, ask her if your marriage is important we need help then go see a professional. And if she will not agree to this then you need to decide if what you have now is what you can deal with till dealth do us part. Because where you start is where you end. Bad Behavior should never be a way of life especially in the life of a marriage. Get help or get out. But know that if you stay and she gets no help what you have now is what you will have later. Her Hurting and Harming YOU.|`|GLVMTMPfaa	If the situation was reversed and you were swearing and hitting out at her it would immediately be considered unacceptable so why should it be any different just because you're the man and she's the woman. It's not so much a case of physical harm but one of respect you need to get through to her that for her own good she needs to learn to control herself it will spill over into other area's of her life (hitting a co-worker will land her with assault charges) contact an anger management center in your area they will have tips for getting her in the door with hopefully minimal damage to yourself in the process. If you feel that it may not be safe for you to risk angering her then defiantly seek out help before confronting her. If she will not get help then unfortunately your only option is to walk away an abusive relationship is never worth it|`|AA11315360	Tell her that it is NOT ok to hit you. Tell her that it wouldnt be ok if you hit her so she cant do it either.<br>  You should get her into counseling or go to couples counseling.

Because this is an abusive relationship for you.<br>  Yes she can swear and get mad but she needs an anger management class to help keep her anger in control!|`|uSPAw89faa	I agree with Fruity Custard, no matter man or woman abuse is unacceptable.  She needs self control and anger management, before she looses you. You two need couples counseling and she needs individual.  Love shouldn't hurt. She needs to learn to re-direct her anger.

WzKrZoHQaa	Well it sounds like a formal decision as to the state of the relationship has not been even met yet.  I'm not even sure you are separated by the way you ask the Q.  <br>  <br>  Ok I can only suggest so here goes.<br>  <br>  Write a letter to her and ask her to read it and to offer you the courtesy of a polite and honest response as you at least deserve that.  Ask her to reply in say 48hrs.<br>  Give some bullet point Q's and ask her to answer everyone<br>  <br>  She cannot bury her head in the sand and just not talk about the state of the relationship - this is a cop out and is also abusive to your feelings too.  You don't really know where you stand here and you need some clarity on the subject.  Whilst still operating under the same roof then some boundaries need and must be set up and agreed.  Is it that she just doesn't want sex for a while and so has moved out the boudoir to avoid the contact?   <br>  <br>  Is she looking for somewhere else to live or just expects youto live as brother and sister for next few months or years because of credit crunch etc ?<br>  <br>  You say "otherwise we are just carrying on as normal" - well Hun this is not normal so yr relationship was already on a rocky foundation if this is how you 2 carried on.   You need to clear the air but is she won't talk then you can't challenge anything or get to the bottom of what has brought you both here in the first place.<br>  <br>  Can you get to couples counselling ?  Relate have a waiting list BUT do offer an email service now at ￡28.50 which some may see as pricey but if it saves a breakup it is money wel spent.<br>  <br>  You cannot go on living like brother and sister - this is just unfair and too much to ask.

Say to her that you will only invite a small number of people to cause less chaos. Maybe suggest that you will pay for party food or whatever.

It is hard I know but that would really happen, time will come and both of you will grow and eventually have different views and priorities in life, careers and stuffs.. then get married so seeing each other will be more harder so the best thing to do is get used to it, learn to face the reality of life.

b4c080d0f4c39aa94fde4b1f35a009fbaa	Law is very clear with regard to marriage under the Special Marriage Act, 1954, which is :-<br>   1) The notice for intended marriage can be given from any district where 'either of the parties has been residing for at least 30days or more' at the time of giving the notice.<br>  <br>  2)That at the time of giving notice for intended marriage 'both parties to be present in person before the marriage officer'.<br>  <br>  3) Since both parties are required to be present at the time of giving notice for marriage,the application/notice form for the same has to be signed by both as well both have to give individual duly signed & attested affidavit stating their age,marital status,fit mental status,& not related within the Prohibited relationship.<br>  <br>  4) As far allowing only one party for giving notice/application for the intended marriage which is duly signed by both parties along with their affidavits etc ,the marriage officer may be requested for this but that will be his discretion to allow it considering the circumstances under which the other party cannot get such a long leave from his job in a foreign country as in your case. The Marriage officer cannot be forced for this but only politely requested with a smile.|`|AA10240683	Marriage is complicated enough and you want to start it off with these rules too? Marriage is not worth it to begin with, consider these complications a godsend and do not do it.|`|wia9SXCPaa	sounds really really complicated.  I guess if you love her enough you had better pack your bags and physically be there.  They said both parties need to be present what more do you need to know?|`|0DyWTwYFaa	I am not au fait with the legislation you speak of but the literal rule of interpretation of statutes will mean that only one of you has to be present and meet the 30 days rule. I think you may be falling foul to incompentent civil servants who do not understand the law and are probably applying it wrongly across the board. I am not saying that this is the case in your case, but I have heard stories of bribery being the only way to get things done in some instances in India and maybe the civil servant/s dealing with the case wants this. <br>  <br>  My advice will be to pust the literal meaning to the provision and insist it is applied by writing vigourously and officially and quoting the provision. If that fails, appoint a lawyer.
HfoO77gpaa	i am in the same situation, all you can do is spend quality time with your mum and have fun with her. she will appreciate your presence and be happy that she has a great daughter who spends time with her. talk to her if she wants to, but if not just be around and be her friend! :-)|`|a8Pq2Lmdaa	What a wonderful child you are to care so much.  <br>  <br>  Help her around the house, help with the cleaning, laundry, dishes, cooking.

Either way, if you are young, maybe there is not much you can do to help with the actual problem.  What you could do is be there for her - give her hugs, do your chores and help her more at home so she has less worries, make her a cup of tea, tell her that you love her and are here for her - that sort of thing.  Not sure that this is any help, but good luck, hope things work out for your family.

Some very hard knocks indeed.|`|lfMJPZ67aa	You are just having a break down because she is pregnant and you wont be the golden child any more. Time to grow up and take the bib off. There's more to life than video games.|`|7iEk06aDaa	LOL,  your a childish little fiend who needs to grow up. Your sneaky, and then throw temper tantrums when you get caught. What you need is a good old fashioned SPANKING!|`|AA10075228	You need to calm down and stop thinking like a little child.  Of course, you must be a child to get so angry over a thing like a game.  Your family, your Mother and the rest of the people in your life are more important than any game.  No one hates you, this is just a misunderstanding, and the way to stop it is to have a calm conversation with your Mom and your family and act like a grown up while you are talking about it.  You are just frustrated right now, you will be o.k. violence never helped any situation.  If you continue to feel badly, try finding someone to talk this situation over with, even if it is a counselor at school.  You should not have such a bad temper.  Good luck and God Bless.|`|MlCWsBcwaa	It is normal part of growing up to want to be independent and resenting parents telling you what to do.  I think you have two choices here: <br>  1. feel bad (angry and guilty feelings) and make your mom and step-dad feel bad as well<br>  <br>  2. accept that even you were caught trying to fix something that you did that was wrong, and you are responsible for your actions and consequences, and you did the wrong thing in the first place.  Cop the punishments (which don't sound that bad really) and if you behave better, they will probably treat you better and put less restrictions on you.<br>  <br>  Your mom is pregnant you say, and that would make her tired and emotional.  Maybe also you have a lot to deal with with a new baby brother or sister on the way.  You can see what is going on, and while it is normal to feel angry, maybe you need to get this under control without having fights with your mom.  Go outside for a while, play sport to get rid of some of this, or get a part time job so you can buy some of your own treats.  Maybe you could try thinking about the good things in your life - your mom does love you and you will have a new brother or sister soon, and you will love them and they will love you.  You are in the position to be an important person in their life.  You can choose to either make the most of it or stuff it up.  <br>  <br>  Also, when you calm down, you might realise that your step-father was doing a good thing picking your mom up, and it was not his fault really.  Also, remember that things really could be worse and you have enough food to eat, clothes, shelter, family and education etc.  You are not dying from some disease like some kids are either, by the sounds of it.  Try thinking more about others and less about how bad you have it.  It might help - things are really not that bad, even though it might feel like it.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|8747ad5946dec06c50e2f01268404c87aa	Find a hobby other than video games and stop whining and stealing stuff.<br>  Do something constructive and maybe you wouldn't be so angry all the time.<br>  As far as hitting something, join a rec center and learn boxing.|`|RL0sef3Saa	dude just chill out and talk to your mom....you be nice to her and she will be nice to you and you will get all the games you want|`|Iuy8RryRaa	im not going to tell u to calm down cous im sure u got tht part.we all feel like that some times!  but u should REALLY talk to somebody and let it all out and trust me it feels really good.|`|JF0SIngqaa	Shame on you! You were stealing and got caught. She should take all of your games and really give you something to get upset about. You are spoiled and selfish. If you want money for school and games you need to get a after school job. God does not hate you. He loves you and wants you to be a good person. Your mom needs your love and not all this other stuff if she is pregnant. What would you do if she was taken from you. Be careful what you say and do. Somethings can never be taken back.

UyYoxd3waa	Sweety, all younger guys are jerks. it's mainly because we don't mature as fast as girls do nor do we seem to know what to say after "Hello?" so the natural thing to do is act like we don't care and say stupid things and in general act like disrespectful retards<br>   I remember at that age I was a real goof as well and it took me to allmost 16 maybe 17 to actually learn how to relax and be the gentleman  I was raised to be.<br>   Sad part is some guys never learn...|`|ktDZjbH7aa	HONEY,,SOUNDS LIKE THESE GUYS R REAL JERKS,,,U N YOUR FRIENDS DONT NEED THERE KIND OF FRIENDSHIP,,THEY ARE THE KIND O FGUYS WHO WANT TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF GIRLS LIKE U N YOUR FRIENDS THEN SAY REALLY BAD THINGS ABOUT YOU,,,SONT GIVE THEM THE OPPERTUNITY,,,,U N YOUR FRIENDS FIND OTHER GOOD GUYS,,,,PEACE|`|rijndrSQaa	Sometimes people aren't the brightest, and sometimes they don't come from social and family environments that teach them to act and express themselves in a polite, understandable way.<br>  <br>  But uh, yeah, these guys sound like jerks.  The one that's crushing on your?  Well, that may be so, and some guys act one way around females and another around their dude-friends, but that's somewhat immature, and are you really particularly interested in a guy who talks nasty about you to his friends, even if he does have feelings with you?<br>  <br>  If they act like jerks and make you feel bad about yourself, find better, maybe more polite, company that will actually give you a little respect as a person.|`|zYD30zyyaa	Guys(probably at dat age those guys r) like fun and open girls.

This is the only way I would see any difficulties.  It makes it hard when you are dating someone that is not in the same "stage" of life as you.

nbtZ4ixoaa	OK this is a bit of a tricky question as it's quite hard to explain!<br>  <br>  basically just start with a few basic pecks (mouth shut) and see whether the girl seems happy with that (cos you DON'T want to scare her away)<br>  <br>  Then if things are going well you can open your mouth and she will hopefully open hers too<br>  <br>  use your tongue, its not like in movies were they just suck each others lips (though that can be good as well), just use it really softly and slowly, move it in circles or do whatever feels right and gradually pick up speed and rhythm when it feels right<br>  <br>  don't be too slobbery, nothing worse than coming out feeling like you have been kissed by a fish<br>  <br>  don't worry, just relax and have fun, if the feelings are there, then the kiss will be perfect, trust me :)|`|60ba2c216103d031928abf198be1d4deaa	You have to be care full with the beak, also some of those chicks have bugs on their feathers, so make sure you use gloves with you pick her up.

Unless you want to just have fun without any responsibility, in which case leave the sweet guy and go for the player.  He'll say whatever to get what he wants.

What the girl looked like that he dated after you is of no matter, you may think she was prettier but he may not, tastes differ.

s30Duwdraa	She obviously has major control issues.  Was your mother abusive towards her as well?  <br>  <br>  You sound like a very intelligent and down-to-earth girl with a great head on your shoulders.  She should be proud of you instead of putting you down.  My guess is there is some jealousy involved in her behavior.  Thank goodness your other sister is actually that, a sister!<br>  <br>  If you are making the effort to re-connect with and she keeps putting you off, then just let it go.  I know it's easier said than done, but you deserve better  treatment than that.  <br>  <br>  She will probably come around eventually and you should make the effort once she makes the first move for a change.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|Pf0YUxWFaa	Just slap the **** out of her.

Best of Luck :)|`|95b3c1cab8a1f1f08d03b46eefc17755aa	I had something similar with my own sister recently. I agree with you, it's none of her business what you call yourself. As for her saying you shouldn't have kids because you changed your name, well, that's just plain ridiculous.<br>  <br>  Your two sisters are two very different people, stay friends with the other one and only deal with this one when you have to. Keep tabs with your father in other ways - phone, messaging, etc. <br>  <br>  One thing you must not ever do is let this sister from hell get your back up, let her upset you. Remember that she needs to feel she has some control over you because deep down she's very insecure. One way of dealing with someone like this is say 'yes' and just continue doing what you were going to do anyway.|`|el8yX5q3aa	Abusive family...dysfunctional family...fractured family.  That happens in abusive families.  Some cannot face the elephant in the living room so they keep as much of their life in denial as possible.  Your sister is one of them.   This is far deeper than you thinking your sister is older than you...and treats you like a kid.!  Your sister is defending her life right now...she does not want to come out of denial about family.<br>  <br>  there is NOTHING you can do about this.  Know it...understand it...and accept it.  I too was abused and left my family......none of them cared...and I have 5 brothers and sisters.  NONE.  You are lucky you have one sister.<br>  <br>  In my case...they all were abused too..but to this day none of them are able to say it out loud or face it.  I am 61...and it took me until I was 40 to do that.    I now looked up my parents and have a relationship with them.  It is quite superficial..but I needed to do that for myself.  My brothers and sisters think I move heaven and earth now and want to do everything with me.  I am not buying it.  I talk to them..and with one sister I occasionally do things with...but I am not being swallowed up into that  hole of deceit again.   I needed to forgive...I needed to settle things on my terms.  I am content with this.<br>  <br>  For you...you have to realize..unless the family realizes as a whole that you were abused...unless they accept that  fact..unless they deal with it...you will forever be the black sheep of the family.  Do not take it to heart.  I know that is hard...but this is THEIR problem....and you will eventually learn to forgive and move on.  IT isn't worth the time and energy you are putting in the to make something happen that won't.<br>  <br>  As for your father...there is nothing you can do about that either.  You can go over and see him.....and I would try to do that.  But do not talk about problems with family with him.  He deserves to die in peace if he wasn't the one who abused.<br>  <br>  Honey...get some counseling.  I can tell the anger and bitterness in your writing.  It is eating you up and you really need to DEAL with your past and get past it.  You have not.  You are still in co dependent stage....and you need to move on.<br>  <br>  Please get the book Co Dependent No More...and read it.  You will see what I mean and then you will see that you should help yourself.  You cannot control things..you cannot accept them...so you have to learn what to do.  <br>  <br>  Please read that book.  Also another one is called TOXIC RELATIONSHIPS.....by Susan something ..I forget.  VERY GOOD BOOKS that talk about family dynamincs and the group think of abused families.
zGFiWSPtaa	Take it and run with it!! Ask her if she likes you back, if so, that's fantastic!!! ;P If  not, though, back off, you can still be friends, but make sure you never make her feel like you will only be her friend if it turns into more. You guys can still be friends and it doesn't have to be awkward but leave the decision of becoming more  up to her. She already knows you like her, so if she likes you is up to her. If so, YAY!!! If not, support and respect her decision and have a great time just being a friend. Don't let her go if she doesn't want to be more. After all, true friendship is rare and should NEVER be wasted!!! GOOD LUCK!!!|`|td6WXhv4aa	Bad idea to fall in love with friends in this case she has a boyfriend who is also your best friend.<br>  <br>  Common sense.|`|sIX1nhCFaa	I think u should explain ur feelings too her, before something like that happens again, and don't be too scared, if u seems to have a reaction quickly tell her that she only want to be friends. Goodluck!!|`|JF0SIngqaa	if she is a good friend she will understand that you were drunk and talking out of your head. If you confessed to her about your feelings then you may lose her and her boyfriend. Just take a wait and see.|`|M6w0MMU8aa	Tell her its TRUE. You like her because of her. You should not lie about your feelings. Maybe she feels the same way and likes you.|`|HRdhOacDaa	Okaaay, if you don't want to ruin the friendship you two have established plus she has a boyfriend then you should just say that you were so wasted that you had no frikkin idea what you said and see if she buys it. If she asks why her, then say its because of the time you two have spent together and stuff.<br>  I really think that's the best idea. I mean, that's the only way she MIGHT forgive and you two MIGHT continue spending time together : )<br>  Hope it all works out...maybe you should get drunk next time. Not a very good idea.|`|1bIZ84gnaa	Tell her the truth, tell her how you really feel for her<br>  Maybe one day she'll wake up and realize that she loves you too :)
NclIWyDQaa	That's actually a lot more common than people realize. We like to assume that full-on vaginal intercourse is a no-fail way to make men orgasm. It's not true, for many reasons.<br>  <br>  Condoms and tightness aside, sex is simply a different sensation from anything else. It takes getting used to. If he can orgasm from other things like oral, then it's most likely not an underlying problem. He's probably just not used to that type of stimulation yet. Men like sex, and they don't necessarily have to climax to enjoy it.<br>  <br>  The best thing to do is to go with whatever he does. Don't bother him about not "finishing" for now. Let him get comfortable with what he's doing. If you're having sex regularly for a while and he's still not and you feel like you need to bring it up, then bring it up casually some time when you're not being physical.|`|HJEXk7Pmaa	yeah maybe he is paranoid about getting me pregnant.. i mean gettin u pregnent  lol|`|R760STfwaa	Ya, um, you should be paranoid too|`|b3zGfYMpaa	Unless, your on birthcontrol, using a condom, and or in a long-term relationship and actually want to have children, I wouldnt recommend that your boyfriend ejaculates inside of you anyway. Anywhere, but inside is good! So yes, your guy is probably paranoid and he could be under alot of stress if hes new too all of this. Give it sometime. If hes still have this problem after you've both had a fair share of the experience than maybe a doctor is a good recommendation. There could be other contribtutions that arent helping, but for now I wouldnt worry.|`|vc403uWPaa	He might be paranoid, but if you're taking all the precautions you can, and hopefully you are because there's nothing like a baby to ruin your sex life, then he should feel relaxed enough. Perhaps it is just because you're both new at sex, as much as it takes for women to relax, it takes men about half that to relax too. Lol!|`|52117dcb7416ab916ef6426b49b50ab6aa	I hope you are using protection cause we don't need anymore accidental babies.  But why would you want him to *** in you, the whole intention is to get you pregnant.  He probably should see his doctor to see what is wrong..if anything.  There might be a reason why he hasn't yet.  Especially you said that both of you guys are fairly new to the sex world so that could be a part of it.|`|rLCx5ljQaa	I had the same problem when i first had sex. The girl i did it with came but i didnt.<br>  <br>  I reckon i was just tired, but any number of factors could contribute.<br>  <br>  also - try using ultra thin condoms. The normal ones are like wearing a raincoat.
vc403uWPaa	Loosen up. If you're tense and expecting pain, then you're going to get it. You need lots of KY Jelly, candles, music, a nice dvd and lots of foreplay! And of course it's good for him, you've just lost your virginity, and you're obviously tense, and that's good for men (meaning you're tight love! Sorry but it's true!) <br>  <br>  Can't tell you how long it will take to stop being sore. I wasn't sore at all when i lose my virginity, mostly because i was too drunk to feel any pain (don't do that!!! it's not a good example). Lots of women are different. But the best advice i can give is to relax! Talk to him before hand, tell him everything that's bothering you, be it sexual or every day to day stuff, let it all out, snuggle and let things progress naturally and take your time! And tell him to be gentle! Men, especially first timers, don't get how sore it can be!|`|sV0fKe6jaa	i'm not sure, i know the more you do it, the more you get used to it.<br>  <br>  i kind of enjoy the pain--"rough seexx" lol<br>  <br>  i also think, for me at least, i orgasm, more when it hurts, and it kind of gives me an adrenaline rush|`|AA11447210	It varies...for some it's pleasant immediately, for others it may take many, many times before it's anything other than something to get through.<br>  <br>  I hope you are on b/c, he's using condoms, and you both have money in the bank to cover medical bills if your 'protection' methods fail.<br>  <br>  If you can't pay, don't play.|`|xaotgFvEaa	a couple of times, use plenty lube and make sure your wet, if your dry it will be agony!

kANR98tIaa	Brace yourself, your relationship is almost over. She is playing a game of Over argumentation. So whenever she argues with you, you never talk right? Good! keep it that way. Its best to let her be mad and you don't talk. Those things that she gets mad for, its so obvious! those reasons are no reasons at all! shes saying and getting mad at random stuff, so she can use those reasons to break up with you.<br>  <br>  Yeah she is definetly cheating on you, or she got bored of you and wants a new boyfriend. <br>  <br>  And that joke she played on you is a test, and she will use that reason to break up with you. Since you did not cry, she has expected that you feel nothing, why should you cry? <br>  <br>  If you want your relationship to continue, you best confront her what is up with you? Or tell her how you feel about this.|`|0tU4jkS9aa	i think she was on her period. you should talk to her about it.<br>  <br>  can someone answer my open questions please?|`|N3Ho6dqhaa	it's not normal girls aren't big fans of sex but that is weird that she wouldn't "do it"

09k5GLLkaa	My first guess is that he wants in your pants. Some men are that way. Then again, he may really think that you are special. Either way he is married and you should think about that before you get too involved.  Someone will be hurt, maybe even two people like you and his wife. It just isn't a good idea to mess around with a married man. Hang in there and soon you will find a man of your own.

Family problems sounds like an excuse to me (because i know people that have said that)<br>  And the reason he's suddenly acting all weird around you is probably because he feels guilty. He probably knows he hurt you and feels bad and now doesn't know how to react around you. So instead of talking to you he's trying to avoid you. He also might be worried that if he carries on talking to you you might get the wrong impression and think he's interested again when he's not.<br>  And as for the heartbrake, i know it sounds really cliche but you just need time. You will eventually move on but for now you just have to grit your teeth (soz) <br>  Hope this helps x
zGFiWSPtaa	Maybe your more outgoing with people from other schools and show more confidence because that's how you really are, but at school, you seem to lose that confidence because subconciously with the people from the other school, you figure if my confidence makes me look like a fool, oh well, i'll never see them again. But, at school, you know that's not true so you are more cautious and less outgoing. Then, you're less popular. Don't let that bother you, though. Get a group of friends and stick with them! Who cares if they're popular or not? As long as their true friends, it's all good.

469c6489c23d9264a9454703f8b8c28baa	You'd be in perfect good taste to not permit your unattached friends to invite a guest. The idea that this is rude comes from more informal settings, where the host isn't paying $150 per head for each guest the invitee brings.<br>  <br>  The only exception is when you have a guest who is in an official long-term relationship (married, engaged, civil partnership, live-in partner). In that case you must invite both members of the couple, and you must invite both of them by name. You can't send the invitation just to the person you know ("Joe Hu and guest"), you must address the invitation in both their names ("Joe Hu and Kelly O'Leary"). If they don't live together you can post it to the address you know.|`|1M90Aoytaa	I think it depends on if the person knows anyone - if you are inviting friends that know each other they dont need a +1, if they arent gonig to know anyone they might feel more comfortable if they have a plus one. jsut explain to people htat you are limited on numbers and you cant invite plus ones. people will understand. <br>  <br>  i have been to a wedding twice where my partner was invited to church, reception and evening and i was only invited to church and reception - that was awkward but i understood why.

Just consider that school friend that wont know anyone else!|`|y6gVmhHxaa	I think it's rude but if you are on a tight budget it's better to not have them invite a guest then to just not be able to invite them.

AA10408380	I don't think u can make her jealous. This is y emotional infidelity hurts more than sexual infidelity. Because u can get over the sex, but emotions run deeper. ANd she's attached to someone else because she doesnt want to be attached to u. So I don't see how u can make her jealous in that reguard since emotional connections take time to build...unlike sexual connections which take an instant. Since she's so attached for so long, I doubt she'd care if u found someone new....she might even be happy for u. OR u know, if u show up with someone, she might tell ur family and her family.

htWw0OlCaa	It does sound like you would be better off living away from her. You have tried to make it work with her. I would maybe try and give it one more chance for the kids sake, and just sit her down and let her know what she is doing to you, not to mention the kids...You know that they know what is going on. People don't give children enough credit than they deserve. Never underestimate a child.... This has effects on them as well. So let her know either she can work with you to work this out and maybe you two go and get some marriage counseling, or some kind of help, or you cant be with her. If she doesn't act like she wants to work it out, then pack your bags and leave. Maybe a little time without you might make her see that she was wrong and she may would like to work it out. Really, you have kids, so please try to work it out. I know it will be tough, but just see, one last time. If not, go to a lawyer and talk to him about what can be done, and get a divorce started. But please if that happens, make sure you get your kids when you are suppose to and make damn sure you pay your child support to them. Please make them understand that you are still there for them.

Also I see that I often start quarrels when I am jealous of his higher success in life or unhappy about myself, both problems I can not at all blame him for. My husband earns 3 times my salary and so sometimes I feel jealous because of this and I get grouchy and rude. I am just speculating but maybe she is jealous about your success or maybe she is unhappy with something in her own life. Have you ever asked her? Try waiting until a time when she has not started a quarrel and then you make the first move, take her gently and ask her what she's really unhappy about in life. Ask her what her dreams and goals are and pay careful attention. If she is not having good dreams/goals or if she isn't taking steps to achieve them, maybe that is part of the problem. <br>  <br>  I am sorry that she is doing this. It is a hard habit to break but it must be done. I have tried very hard to adjust and stop this bad habit as the poor husband suffers a lot and it's not fair. See for my husband it's not his fault that I did not do as well in education. So my solution is to study and try for college again and after studying I feel happy and relaxed because I am working towards my goal and then I am much more cheerful and so he also becomes cheerful.<br>  <br>  Also is she staying at home with kids? Are the kids old enough to be in school? See it is not easy doing nothing but caring for kids, she might be such a devoted mom so I am not criticising her, but might be she needs a vacation or maybe would like to work a part-time job and earn some of her own spending money. See my husband wants me to stay at home and have kids and be a housewife but I feel pride about my job and my salary so it's hard for me to think of giving that up. <br>  <br>  Be then also, life is all about adjustment. Nothing can stay the same all the time, things have to change somehow and they should change for the better as you both deserve happiness.<br>  <br>  I hope this problem gets solved, brother!<br>  <br>  Best wishes,<br>  <br>  Deepti|`|J7Mmo5Xmaa	Tell her you have had it with her behavior.Tell her you do not wish to destroy your children's home but it takes to to make a happy family.Then tell her she can choose a marriage counselor or a divorce lawyer you are giving her the option, then tell her you'll be at your parents until she decides.|`|x3bkJHBZaa	Take a step back & understand why she fights in a very aggressive manner.

Your wife gives all women a bad name.  It sounds like she is so unhappy with herself that she is taking it out on you and your children.  Think of the example your marriage is setting for them and their future spouses.  Oh God, what hell their spouses are going to go through, considering what kind of example your wife is setting as to how a woman should treat a man.  Your wife obviously has no respect for you or your marriage.  Maybe she wants you to leave and doesn't have the guts to be honest, so she is treating so badly till you do leave.  According to the Bible, the woman sets the tone for the home.  And with your wife acting aggressive, you go to work tense and come home walking on eggshells.  The same goes for your children.  They go to school tense and come home walking on eggshells.  I feel for all of you.  Your wife is a very bitter woman and it will only get worse because you gave her permission to treat you this way, by putting up with this behaviour, in the first place.  Why should she have respect for you, when you don''t even respect yourself?  I would leave and take some time and space to get yourself and your self respect back.  Then see how things go.  Just be honest with her, even if you put it in a letter and have her read it with you there.  That way, you can get your 2 cents in before she lambastes you.  Have your clothes packed and when she does start berating you, put her in her place and than walk out.  But find yourself again, without your wife making you feel so small.  You seem to have a lot of love to offer and what it looks like from here, she is unworthy of that love.  You are worthy of self love and love from someone who deserves you.|`|djUMvICoaa	It's wise of you to understand your mental health might is more important than trying to stay in a marriage that is total caos.  It's not good for you or for your children.  Your first step is to get out.  Then find out how the children are being taken care of.  If the caos remains for them you might want to get them out for their mental health, for even though they can't express it they have to be suffering much like yourself except that in growing up in such a situation it is normal for them and they will look for that in their relationships because it feels normal.  You all have a lot at stake here.  Find a good attorney.|`|CnqGu1Taaa	get counseling or Leave|`|cWuumdy7aa	you need to find what is the reason for having fight with you inspite of you are staying not with your family.If she wants separation then go for it or else explain her whats her problems and try to patch up as its question of the future of the children. there has to be valid reason. does she like some one else have an open discussion and arrive at a conclusion after involving both of your families.

IzztdPIfaa	Twice a week is not bad! Likely above average. Granted, you are young, so ...<br>  <br>  My perspective is that marriage makes you feel trapped. It makes every little thing much more important because you feel stuck with it for life. It alters your expectations of each other and you don't feel you live up to them. Not surprisingly, you feel bad, you row, then you can't show affection because you don't feel it. <br>  <br>  Communication is key. Spicing things up is, too.<br>  <br>  My wife and I tried this website ... Hundred sex games ... It is Erotic, in its noblest meaning. It was like falling in Love all over again.

There must be some serious problem with your husband; he either does not love you anymore or has some personal or mental/psychic troubles. You should talk to him about this for sure or consult a sexologist or a phychiatrist. Or he may be on some medication like antidepressants which reduce sex drive.|`|NWkC4cQKaa	I keep hearing this for whatever reason that sex is terrible. I think it has something to do with our  lifestyle, economic status. OUr culutre is so advanced that at a very early age, our kids are already taught things which I think kids in other countries arent even aware it exists.Reality bites. That's why premarital sex is not  encouraged among conservative families, why?this is because it is designed to keep couples busy exploring and learning each other in their lifetime. I assume kids are doing it at 12 by the time they reach the early 20's the fountain of well is dry and empty. =(.|`|1uRUaSblaa	Maybe he's tired, stressed ,overworked or...??<br>  Anyway,twice a week is reasonable.As long as you both are <br>  still communicating well.

Thats it. Simple as that. So you need to confront him. Tell him this is not normal. Any man I have EVER known even when they are tired tell me they always want sex. I have been told to just wake them up for sex if I want it. I have been told by men in their sleep that I could just jump on them!<br>  <br>  So he is cheating or gay. You need to confront him and get a straight answer from him. Make him go to couples counseling with you. If he doesnt change soon then divorce him because there is something wrong here! It is NOT you!<br>  <br>  The only other possible reason for having no sex with you is that he is having problems getting "it" up and doesnt want to admit it. So if that is the problem he needs to see a doctor.|`|djUMvICoaa	Has it always been this way or did it taper off after the honeymoon?  At twenty six I can't ever remember not wanting sex and I was running a business at the time.  I don't think work has a lot to do with it.  But what do you folks do for exercise or time out or do you even go out at all?  Sometimes a lack of exercise is a good cause for something like this.  We start shutting our bodies down because the lack of exercise isn't helping get rid of waste products which build up and then don't allow other body parts to function properly because they have no place to put their waste products.  When this all happens, it affects the body and the mind, and ends up with results like you have.  Get him out to walk with you, it will make you both feel better, sleep better, etc.  Do it for one week and see what happens to your whole relationship.|`|tPLZVDMWaa	Maybe he is depressed that will make your sex drive plunge.  Have you tried spicing it up a little to catch his interest? Candles,  lingerie, massages, etc. If you still are having sex twice a week obviously he is not cheating on you. Now that you are married he could of got too comfortable. Talk to him about see how he is feeling about all this. Try not to take it personal until you know that it's not something else going on in his life that could be affecting his sexual drive.|`|r23H0m30aa	hi gal<br>  i totally understand wat u re going through...im with the guy for over a year and lately i got sex same time as u..I think the reason is the guys are getting lazy...but they are selfish too when they want sex u always have to be ready and please them but when u want they just dnt want it,,,<br>  Just talk to him about it and try to find out wats going on.Or just maybe u guys have the diffrents sex drive which u need more than him|`|93a662df02550107e08ac64ecf6360eeaa	Please don't get confused.. <br>  Having sex with partner daily is normal in everyone's life.

If he can't means please check his health and ask him to undergo medical treatment..!<br>  one example: my age is 49 (04/01/1960 born); still i am working hard daily and have a very good sex with my partner daily (even 2 times in the week ends).

For u 20+ yo, twice is definitely too little k. When I was yr age, it's every other nite or sometimes, several times a day......Think abt it :)|`|o10Vmrzbaa	for new web, i do think twice is enough. Too much sex will result over stress and even will be more tired in workplace.|`|Pe3lyyxoaa	yep...thats it nothing you can do..talk to him about how you feel...but i've been doing that for 2 years...and no change...|`|RP6Xmvxsaa	YOU NEED COUNSELING ABOUT YOUR SEX LIFE|`|UUiOxEoVaa	How long does he work?  Does he do something physical that causes him to be exhausted?  Is he overweight (being overweight can cause men to have lowered testosterone levels which can effect sex drive rather drastically). One of these things (either stress or being out of shape) is the most likely culprit.<br>  <br>  Twice a week isn't that uncommon. I certainly wouldn't say it's anything to panic about unless it's simply unacceptable to you.   I wouldn't panic if you are fairly happy with the current level of sex.  Because you are doing this now doesn't mean it will stay like that.  Over the life of a relationship you will find that your sex life will wax and wane a bit.<br>  <br>  There are other things this could be as well.  First the problem could be emotional.  Women have a tendency to think that men are less emotional or that sex is less of an emotional thing for them.  This is patently false.    Sex is a massively emotional thing, his emotions are directly tied to it. and if he's feeling self conscious, unloved, or if sex isn't very caring or considerate...well they can lose their desire for sex just like women. Also, if you have had a time or two after a long day that he couldn't finish or couldn't perform he might now be afraid of not being able to do it again.  This is highly likely the case if he's out of shape which can not only effect his testosterone levels and ability to manage stress but also might have the added effect of him being self conscious. <br>  <br>  The last might be this... are you on birth control or trying to get pregnant?  If so, he might feel apprehension about that.  <br>  <br>  Keep in mind if you have been having sex for years that twice a week isn't really abnormal.  As I've said your sexlife will wax and wane especially if you're going through bouts of long work or stress.
Atm21O43aa	Girl. This "Joe" totally is into you. Just flash smiles all the time and act as confident as you can ok. Just let him make the moves. Try to act like hes nothing because that will make him try much harder to get you. Don't play impossible to get though. Be flirtatious on occasions so he dosent get board of you and so he craves you more. Be outgoing and then sometimes shy. If he already flirts with you than how much harder can it get? Just be cool and be fun and sometimes wild. It will work trust me girl! Send him funny little flirtatious texts too. Then when you text him in the future he will actualy be waiting for them rather then dreading them.|`|xs9L4eGpaa	how old are u <br>  <br>  u need to get this thing called a life|`|tEmJT3hYaa	Maybe he needs a friend as well as a girl friend and that is all there is to it.

I made sure to not let what happened between a girl and me make things awkward.  She has been a lot better of a friend then ever before since the entire thing happened.  I am going to try again.  I suggest that you do the same just don't try and push it too much.  Maybe just spend more time with her.  That is what I am going to do with the girl I like.  If you two really enjoy spending time together things will progress naturally.  On the other hand you don't want to be too clingy around her.  Especially right now you need to give her some space.  After some time has passed then you can ask her to hang out more.  You should hang out with her more than once a month.  And talk about her the whole time.|`|MNja3iwMaa	i'd leave things as they are.|`|FcZxmtCNaa	I think she really cares about you as a friend, and nothing more.

J7Mmo5Xmaa	you cant change him.<br>  I wont lecture you on marijuana because you are not mature enough to handle the truth that some people become addicted to it and your b.f is addicted it and always will be.<br>  Last thing, if he has to choose between you(or ANY girl) and his pot, the girls ALL lose hands down every time.You wont be able to continue your "once in a while social use of pot" and maintain a relationship with a pot addict.If he quits, he needs a girl who doesn't smoke it.Pot does calm people down and put them at ease, it takes away their drive and desire to deal with problems ,while making them believe everything "works itself out"and that is how it becomes addictive.|`|gNFPy6S0aa	Yeah, as with most drugs, it's down to the individual and how they use it.  Some people aren't very good at moderation.<br>  <br>  It sounds like your boyfriend has a bit of a problem, and it sounds like he knows he has a problem.  The next step, if he wants to fix it, is that he has to decide that he doesn't want to smoke weed at all, ever.  It's pretty clear he's prone to addictive behaviour.  If you know your drug use is harmful and out of control, and you make an excuse to take drugs anyway, then you're an addict - the only difference between drugs is the nature and severity of physiological withdrawal symptoms, the basic psychological mechanisms are pretty much identical.<br>  <br>  The only way to beat an addiction, is to stop engaging in the addictive behaviour, and recognise when you're making excuses.  It may not be easy, but it's fairly simple.  Want to quit weed?  Don't smoke any weed.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|angW1Lkfaa	I really don't think there is anything wrong with occasional use of it. This is not occasional use. It's out of hand. Sorry but it could have bad effects on you drugs alters the thinking process and if he ever loses that you could be on the wrong end of it. If you want advise there is only one like it or not. The question is what do you want more me or drugs. You need to put yourself first, I know|`|HoZYr3bXaa	I think there's some sort of thing you can get to quit drugs - methodone?<br>  But maybe you should get him to go onto normal smoking.. it's not as harmful.. <br>  Then he can come off that using nicotine patches or gum.<br>  You should tell him that he's gone back to his old ways, and remind him of how much happier he was when he'd stopped.<br>  - Good luck.|`|i8FLbJ4Caa	You know what they say, if you can't bet'em join'em|`|hn84KN3baa	i am sorry but you people are retarded!!!

I have a friend who's dad said her mom can't marry him until she stopped smoking. And she stopped. You should tell him, no matter what his best friends do, he needs to stop. Tell him the truth, and maybe find out some info about pot, and tell him. It shouldn't be hard for you, if you really love him.<br>  <br>  Best of luck!|`|6LKEWFPoaa	"And please, no lectures on marijuana, I know about the stuff.

They all scream and run just as fast as they can.|`|8cDd70dSaa	She would give him a men's ring. She's presenting the ring to him, so why shouldn't it be his? Also, I don't think it matters whether she puts it on or if he does, but traditionally, the guy puts the ring on the woman's finger.|`|yp8NtB0faa	ok i think if a woman proposes to a man, she should get the ring for him, but im not totally sure how that goes (good question! lol).  But when a man proposes to a woman, he should be the one to put the ring on her finger.|`|tWD175Pjaa	Im old school i don't think its proper for a women to propose marriage to a man but if a man dose it he puts the ring on. and its the ring with the big diamond the ring with the smaller diamonds is the wedding band.|`|zdpp7cubaa	I don't know how a woman proposing to a man a go, but if I were to, I don't think I would present him with a ring because the only ring he will be wearing is the band and you don't put that on until during the ceremony. I think the woman or the man could put the ring on her finger, just however, it happens. My fiance put my ring on.|`|1768faf9e5b2a30b04ec84addc43d163aa	When she is proposing I would think that the ring is for him.  And most likely the man puts the ring on her finger when it's the other way around!|`|2219815a5f68b0925e6613039b0922b6aa	If a woman were to propose to a man, I suppose she should have something for him, but I wouldn't do a ring because most men don't really wear "engagement" rings, and they usually like to pick out their own wedding bands.  If I were going to propose to a man, I'd maybe give him a really nice watch or courtside tickets to a Knicks game or something like that.  Something meaningful and expensive, but not necessarily a ring.    As for your other question, the man is supposed to put the ring on the woman's finger when he proposes, but if she takes it out of the box and puts it on herself, there's nothing wrong with that.  Just make sure it fits!|`|YcyT38OIaa	All useless technicalities and obsolete social norms if one wishes them to be.    I'm engaged to the best friend I ever had, and we love each to the extreme. We agreed that the primary thing we want in life to spend the rest of our lives together, to help each other grow to be our best, and share the joys and hurdles of life together. We'll probably get married in less than 3 years, and she'll get her ring once I can afford it. But for now, it's not really necessary. The spiritual bond and absolute commitment we have for each other is totally insurmountable, since without exaggeration, "we" matters a lot more than "me" to each of us.     A physical symbol, a possession, and "pretty thing" which is realistically just a rock and some metal, is not the most important thing to us. We don't need the symbol, since we constantly have the real deal right in front of our faces. A perceptibly beautiful chunk of physical matter is nothing compared to what we have for each other.     Eventually, I'll get her a beautiful ring, once I can afford it and other things that are more important to us are taken care of. A car, a house, and financial stability should be achieved, ideally. Since these provide functionality and will greatly aid in starting a family, whereas a ring wont. A ring is only a necessity, if it is desired to be a necessity.     After all, the point of engagement is to pledge future marriage, not to add to a jewelry collection for the sake of social recognition.     It is wise to be happy with what matters, than to be discontent by desiring the unimportant.|`|2f2338425d995c6d00e32cb38d57ee7faa	Being that it's a non-traditional approach, there are few, if any, guidelines - so, I suppose, it could be done however the couple decides to do it. One thing for certain, you don't want to propose to a guy with a woman's ring.|`|rlUUaSgqaa	I think a woman proposing to a man is a new enough thing that there aren't any standards that have been set yet.  However, I've seen several posts from women asking what they want to buy a man if they want to propose to him.  I don't think it would make sense to propose with a gift she'd bought for herself.    When my husband and I got engaged, I knew he'd bought the ring and could tell that he'd been wanting to propose to me that whole evening but that he'd been too nervous to do it.  I ended up asking him.  I just wrote the words in large letters in the sand so there was no need to get down on my knees.  Then he pulled out the ring from his pocket and slipped it onto my finger.|`|sGP6s7uraa	For a woman proposing, I don't really know.  I guess you would use a band for him.      It doesn't really matter who puts the ring on her finger.  My fiance put it on mine but I've seen other women put it on themselves.
YUjVFkocaa	Well, I'm picky, so I wouldn't even answer this question.  All my girls are sexy, both in bodies and in faces; and they're cool, popular, funny, and confident.<br>  <br>  However, with that said, here is the "right answer" you are looking for:<br>  ==============<br>  <br>  The correct one to choose is an ugly skinny girl.<br>  <br>  It can be argued that ugliness is unavoidable, correct?  I mean, if somebody's born with the ugly tree, they simply can't do much to avoid it.  Especially if they have a good body but a bad face, there's just nothing they can do.  NOTHING wrong with them as a person, though! Plus- they won't be vain, most likely.<br>  <br>  However, the reason I think most people subconsciously dislike fat people isn't because of their weight or the unsightliness, so much.  It's merely the MINDSET you attribute to a typical fat person.<br>  <br>  Most fat people tend to be associated as being lazy, not hard working, and dumb.  Considering 99 out of 100 people can avoid being fat, the first 2 are already proven.  As for the third, it MUST take a stupid person to WANT so many people to hate them!<br>  <br>  Also, fat pretty girls tend to be VAIN as WELL AS lazy!  They are too lazy to work out, but they can't get out of the mirror, or putting make-up on, or doing their hair just right.  Anything that makes them look better without actually having to work hard, they're fine with.  This shows that they have their priorities wrong, and put vanity over well-being.<br>  <br>  =====================================<br>  <br>  Lastly, with an ugly skinny girl, you can still have fun with her, do sports and outdoor activities with her, you dont have to get special things to accommodate her weight, etc.<br>  <br>  and you can put a bag over her head during sex... that always helps, and its ALOT EASIER than trying to stick an average-sized d*ck in some FAT girls punaner!  That HAS to be hard... never tried it, but i dont even think that'd work out.|`|33f4c852804fa42db9a7cbb912480080aa	There is no such thing as either...Fat is not pretty and skinny is not ugly...unless skinny means grossly anorexic skinny...<br>  <br>  But, weight can be lost or gained and these days there is plastic surgery if she's THAT ugly...<br>  <br>  Basically, neither...I'd go for the average looking girl...|`|Fe4Eixw6aa	whoever i felt more connected to|`|Hek7MUNYaa	fat one can lose weight and then be drop dead gorgeous<br>  skinny girl but ugly......she can eat a lot but it wont make her face irresistible as the fat one's face ;p|`|AA11752603	Depends how ugly and how fat...i guess i'd go with the fat pretty girl|`|6846a3395d16d18b95b001a1bda626a1aa	It depends on what goes on between their ears,|`|2keIEMFUaa	How about if she was just big boned and have really big Boob's too?<br>  Personally! I would hope that a man would just love the woman for who she was not for her looks, weight, body period, but for her enter beauty.|`|qQKOAdSjaa	let me just say this<br>  It is 100% impossible to be fat and pretty simultaneously.I would choose the fatty and then for a present i'd get her lypo :P|`|nv7Cofm5aa	I'd date none of them, period. Gotta love quality. You know? And the question you're posing here... is of no quality.|`|JCdBSULraa	ugly skinny, no contest.|`|LSXdwRDUaa	depends on how skinny she is. <br>  And also how much she weigh<br>  but I'll the in between|`|e86df6aeda098a41020c4baf4c81dcddaa	or how about just an average sized average-looking girl? <br>  <br>  :)|`|sCCjAKllaa	Neither. If I had to really pick, it would be a fat pretty girl.|`|fj1Tk8Nyaa	which has the better rack?|`|7tJNspGNaa	Well, if I was into girls I think that I would probably end up dating the one that was the most open. The one that let me know who she was, and had solid beliefs and an optimistic perspective. <br>  <br>  I wouldn't want to go for the one that was less open, and conformed more to please others. I would want the one who knew how to be herself, no matter who that self was.|`|JeAMY2Xkaa	wow...I never realized guys were so dumb...they would rather be with an ugly bony girl than with a full figured pretty girl..what was the book? i would love to read it. You should read Such a Pretty Fat by Jennifer Lancaster :) it's so funny|`|YTHmYqllaa	it depends on alot of factors. it depends on just how ugly/ pretty they are, the personalities play a huge role, because even the prettiest girl can turn me off just by being a snob.<br>  <br>  but given the choice, i'd choose the fat pretty girl|`|uzthUP9Faa	ugly = skinny <br>   i prefer curvy but not 2 fat as in fatty fat ,, <br>  but between fat and skinny it wud be fat pretty girl !<br>  <br>  O and its more cushon for the pushin|`|6CU00J1Yaa	I don't find fat girls pretty at all.

SS1FFafRaa	She seems to have zero trouble loosing weight.    She eats chocolate for every meal and weighs 120 lbs at 5'5".    Really kind of annoying.|`|oEOo9U7iaa	stop chomping down those twinkies and do some crunches for goodness sake. That's what I would say.|`|OG4410bdaa	well  I am 39 weeks pregnant  before I concieved our child I used to walk about 7-8 miles everyday  and it was important to me that I stay as healthy as possible while pregnant  so my husband has been my number-one support through all this:  he walks with me daily (I now only walk about 4 miles a day though)  and he helps keep healthy foods in the house so I'll be less likely to eat poorly  he keeps our fridge stocked with fresh fruits, and is quick to cut up an apple for me  of course we still occassionally have ice cream  but when we have ice cream, we make a point of walking the mile down to the shoppe    without his support I'd have probably gained 60 pounds from this pregnancy  (I gained 27 pounds, which my OB says is "ideal")  its hard to get off your butt and walk when you're tired,  but having him walk with me was just the help I needed to keep going  and I definitely appreciated having him be so supportive    we talked about what we want to do once the baby is born, as far as me getting back in shape  we decided that we'd stick to a similar system:  my husband will walk with me, increasing the milleage as I see fit  plus I'm signing up for a mommy-and-me yoga class when the baby gets alittle older    we both had weight problems as teenagers  but we both got in shape a couple years before we met and married eachother  so we know what its like to be "big" and neither of us wants to go back to that  thats why we are so supportive of eachother    everyone needs a support system when they are trying to better themselves  our spouses have the potential to be the most helpful person in our lives if we would just tell them what we needed|`|ze7xiJwTaa	Yes, his help and support is appreciated. But not from the couch :)   I like to stay active and fit. He doesn't seem to gain a pound and doesn't need much exercise. I try to make sure we eat healthy and encourage doing active things together like biking, hiking, walking the dog etc. I don't expect him to keep up with me but it helps so much if he gets involved. Sometimes he'll bike along next to me when I'm out for a long run and it makes me so happy.|`|d20mM90uaa	yes, i love to have someone there to make me MOVE! i would love my husband to do that but he could care less either way i guess, or he is afraid if i got hot i would leave his butt lol  i would never do that|`|W1rCsvTzaa	Before we got married we had "The talk".  I told her weight was important to me and that I wanted both of us to commit to keeping fit.  And we both have.      So I don't talk about her weight.  I push us both to keep junk food out of the house and I also invite her to come with me at night to walk dogs/roller blade.  She does weigh herself and has always stayed pretty close to her marriage weight.      I know this is a sensitive subject for many people.  But marriage equals sharing, sex is sharing bodies.  Marriage is sharing money too.  Making the effort to stay fit if your partner wants you to, is worth it.  Also, if I got killed in an accident my wife would have an easier time geting remarried because she took care of herself.|`|f02e697306fa9b0bd6517818970ff8daaa	Nope.  She is not trying so i have my peace.|`|803c63e1bdfd226d14f4e5cafdc52f7eaa	Unless he has successfully lost weight than I don't need or want his suggestions. Although I'm not overweight and am not trying to lose weight, I like when we encourage each other to go to the gym.|`|b26NgqOFaa	I wish my husband WOULD come out and say it if he has a problem with my body.  Putting what you can control (how much and what you eat, how much you work out) and what you can't control (genetics, bone structure, DAMAGE FROM HAVING KIDS) aside- it would be nice to know if he might like me better if something changed. Because right now he just says "I'm not complaining" which is very confusing.    However. When I have lost weight and gotten in shape in the past he did compliment me on the results. Which was nice.  In fact as I recall I didn't even have to fish for compliments in those days.    I also liked mem's answer (although that last bit was kind of grim)|`|RBQrgByeaa	Yeah, nothing works. I bought a great bike and everything. She'd just rather watch "Oprah" all day and I can't even suggest she put down the Oreos. When you marry trash...|`|6487bd61ef059cac042d49119a814a4aaa	This subject is totally taboo if you want to stay out of the dog house.  Besides, she's gonna cheat on her diet anyway.|`|GeruGGOQaa	Yep.  Usually you get crap like....    Didn't you notice I lost 1lb.?    Um, no?    Well thanks a lot!    Um, you're welcome?|`|uGFzzLYWaa	No. I want him to stay out of it and keep his mouth shut about it.|`|gZ5OI7P9aa	Happily married for 12 years to a size 8 wife who fights like hell to keep her weight down.    I support her by also worrying about my weight and agreeing with her about when we really need to have a low fat dinner.    I only mention her weight when she brings it up to compliment her on her having lost weight and looking good.|`|8dryRRiaaa	I try and stay away from these types of questions with the wife.  It's a lost cause as soon as the question is posed.  If I know she is dieting I just try and support her.
hcgaizJCaa	Everyone has strengths and weaknesses. I am definitely a dominant personality. I wouldn't consider my partner submissive, but he generally lacks a sense of urgency for most things. I like things done and decisions made quickly and efficiently. I don't think your situation is abnormal at all. As long as no one is feeling bullied or taken for granted, i see no problems.|`|NvOro0igaa	depends on the issue. Hubs decides on what cars we drive, I decide on what we do for entertainment.

His voice and presence is very commanding in his office and the kids but i step in when we don't agree on some.|`|RDgyb7W8aa	My wife and I have been married 37 years and each has a say in what we want to do, vacations, eating out, finances.. That why our marriage is great it shared responsibility.

Rock it girl!|`|GoEaSOSraa	That is completely normal. The guys your age are still immature and into dumb things. Guys take longer to mature than girl do. BUT and here is the BUT you should not be dating a guy who is in his late 20's. That is too old for someone your age. I'd say early 20's (20-22ish) would be better...once you are 18 then go ahead and date whomever you want, just be wise about it because there are some guys in their 20s who's ultimate goal is to "hit it and quit it".|`|W618lfZ6aa	Nothing wrong with you at all, you just don't like guys your age.<br>  <br>  I wouldn't pursue any of these guys till you are at least 18 though.|`|EkLJDcc7aa	nothings wrong|`|8SN7KiCkaa	There is absolutely nothing wrong with you... Majority of young women want someone older. It gives them a sense of security to feel like they are being taken care of, something no little boy can do... Older guys also have a way about them, a form of maturity that we long for. Besides... 3 years is definately no biggy!!!|`|XwMn6aY5aa	no there's nothing wrong with you. that's a good thing in my opinion older guys are more appealing.and know how to treat ladies.it's normal it's normal so don't worrie about it keep looking at them :)plus if you ever date on around 20 they are better then young guys that just play games..so don't worrie and keep your eyes open :)good luck|`|3MDY29gnaa	no not really young guys are immature and you probably are just attracted to more mature guys. However You being under the ago of 18 that is a problem. Maybe wait a year and you can date you who want.|`|ECe1rgsdaa	Your fine, It just shows that you prefer a more mature guy than what your high school has. When I was 17 I dated a guy who was 22 because the guys at my school were so immature. :)|`|bcf393e4db41afbc89350db8fced8a1aaa	Toya, that's normal for younger girls to like older guys
F47MyGDSaa	Tell them that you feel stressed out with school and homework, and say you don't want your grades to drop. Tell them the guitar is just a hobby you picked up, you learned a lot already, and you just feel frusterated and stressed because you feel like you have too many commitments. And with that being said, tell them you could always take up guitar in the future, but now you just want to focus on school.|`|rCqcF75faa	Don't quit, stick through it, in the end its worth it and will all work out|`|zAd8q8KQaa	No, it's not stupid at all.<br>  You are a very smart girl for realizing this situation and your parents will have a great respect for you if you just let them know!<br>  <br>  Sometimes, lessons are overrated anyway...lol just kiddin.<br>  There are plenty of websites and videos on the internet that can teach you and since you've already been going for 5 months, I'm sure you're not that bad anyway!

He probably said he had to work, spend the day with his mom or daughter, said he had to go on a business trip.  This way, he can have a delayed V-day celebration with all the women he has been stringing along and lying to.|`|vxjOpKruaa	I think they spend a different part of each day with a different girl and when their on a date with another girl, when the girl is not looking he will text another girl. or something<br>  I don't really know but good question.|`|2OqA5Fi2aa	my mom|`|5ulr9xLQaa	You have to be a true player for real to pull that off.  The answer to that question is they take out the woman that gives them the best sex.  The others they tell that they are going to take out their mother.  The other lines is that they are going to be out of town or working.<br>  <br>  Trying to go out with 2 women in the same night is tedious at best.  I have a "friend" who tried to convince his girlfriends that they should try being with another woman.  Then he invited them for some action.<br>  <br>  I can't tell too much because I will have my man card revoked.|`|DWLbXd79aa	the real gf, or do u mean hookin up with at one time, or actually dating, the real gf, if just hookin up with then stil his fave, but he knows or hers she's doin sumthing else than he will pick another, depends on the situation|`|SECmT3Tnaa	Well he would probably spend the day with one girl and the night with the girl he can get more out of...sometimes men are siick|`|6ADAAt6gaa	i think they will spend it with the one they like the most  OR the one they harley spend time with|`|8ea4731a729b705912f2536fb0cd0430aa	Probably the least expensive, but I am glad I can only handle one woman at  a time|`|HOVvKqxsaa	different timings|`|0dnfyDWqaa	i was sick so they all came and pleasured me at different times.|`|ibR6jJgHaa	finds a new one and adds on to the collection -.-<br>  them asses|`|izXIAxXGaa	Women who have their priorities straight do not have problems with men like this. <br>  Women who value money, social upward mobility, materialism, become victims of men who manipulate those needs. It doesn't take a rocket scientist or a brain surgeon to figure out that a guy that drives around in a BMW, is groomed immaculately from head to toe, is married and it's the wife's money that is paying for it all. <br>  Some women also put high value on a large male reproductive organ. A word to the wise, sometimes a symptom of an STD is swelling. That is not to say that some guys are not naturally bigger than others. Although many a woman has contracted a rather nasty illness from her vain attempt to catch the biggest trout in the pond.<br>  Girls, it's not about money and it's not about body parts. It's about love. Find a nice boy, like the one your mother and father wanted you to go out with, get married and have lots and lots of kids. <br>  When you start thinking Sex in the City, you will make your bed, lie in it, and spend the rest of your life with a male - cat.|`|ZQZf1iINaa	they spend the day with their "main squeeze"|`|dgDW0Pt5aa	The women they are dating are stupid whores.

You're the one that wore it and if you didn't want anyone to see it then you should have pulled your pants up or closed your legs.|`|JCdBSULraa	A dork is a whale's penis.  I guess if you bear a strong resemblance to the penis of a whale, that's fairly embarrassing.  <br>  <br>  As for the thong, it depends what you want them to think of you.  If you want them to think you're more sexually-driven, it's fine, but if you want them to think you're more conservative, that would be embarrassing.|`|szcA8CDyaa	Its cool when guys check girls things out when girls wearing stuff their using and why do u think ur a dork.

Kiss him every morning.<br>  2. Do something nice for him everyday.<br>  3. Ask him how he's doing everyday.<br>  4. Cuddle for 10 minutes.<br>  5. Listen quietly for 10 minutes.<br>  6. Compliment him twice a day.<br>  7. Share something nice twice a day.<br>  8. Ask for his help once a day.<br>  9. Smile at him 3 times a day.<br>  10. Tell him I love you once a day.<br>  <br>  And they're reversable. He can do them to you too. Or make up his own.<br>  <br>  The point is...there is no big thing to be done. You just have to get through a day, with only pleasant attitudes and caring for each other.<br>  <br>  Then two days. Then four days. Then a week. Then three weeks. Then several months. Then a few years.<br>  <br>  And so on. <br>  <br>  Remember, little victories.<br>  <br>  And if you can't convince him to do it....start doing it on him first. You'll find your kindness, affection, and respect are returned....<br>  <br>  ....with interest!!<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|D3hYbsVJaa	You don't fix trust issues. It never works.

My husband notices attractive women all the time and mentions them to me, but it's because he is a photographer and always has to point out features in girls that would "make a great photo." But anyway, I'm confident enough in our marriage that he is just a man who appreciates the beauty of women, and the fact that he tells me when he thinks a girl looks nice lets me know he's not being weird about it. I do the same thing when I see a good looking guy.<br>  <br>  My friend told me the quote, "You may be broke but you can still look at the menu."|`|AA10408380	Yes. It's normal to find others attractive...at any stage in life; wheather married or not. this is y couples tell each other to keep up their figures. Not saying the other will stray if their partner lets themselves go, but to say, I still want to see u at ur most beutiful, and usually, that's when the couple is first dating or first married. It just keeps u engaged. Women look at other men too. It's not the looking that's the problem, it's the acting. If u look and find someone of the opposite sex attractive, then fine, good, ur normal. but if u go over and ask for their numbers, then there's a problem.<br>  <br>  I used to haVe the same problem. I thought my guy didn't like me anymore since he thought other girls were more attractive. He set me straight. Plus, he also let me put myself in the situation...and therefore, I understood.|`|fMEypXDYaa	It's called girl watching and since girls are built to be noticed, we all tend to do it, it's the touching/playing part that causes all the trouble.|`|K3ZYWBr4aa	yea just dont sit and fantasize about them unless you dont mind your wife sitting and fantasizing about other men all day.
Xk2nBM8raa	It usually takes a while before the IRS to catch up with support arrears. He will more than likely get his return this year if he's already filed it, and there's nothing anyone can do about it.  If a judgment gets made between your gf and her ex that he pay arrears out of his paycheck they won't touch the return anyway, they can just add it to the amount he already pays. If however, he doesn't want to do that, then yes IRS can take his return, but the thing is your ex wont see it, it will go straight to the Child Support Office.|`|0KLu4hRaaa	Bye bye tax return.

2keIEMFUaa	I know how it feels and so does a lot of other people in this world you're not a lone, we all go though this at least once or more in our life.  You need to get your grove on Girl...I want you to go and stand in front of your mirror and tell yourself that everything is going to be alright and that you love that person you see in the mirror and you are going to take great care of that person so wash your face and put on your make-up and fix your hair and/or take a shower and then put on your make-up and fix your hair go get your nails done, etc. Put on that Big Smile and go out dancing and dance up a storm and tell yourself I'm free to do what I please. I just love myself and who I am... and when those guys see that big smile on your face and see just how happy you are they are going to want you to rub off on them.  Do you realize that people love to be around people who are happy and love themselves.  Girl you have the gift go out and use it.|`|Ey5ew3G6aa	ok..<br>  here's what you need to do..<br>  get over it!|`|uAw2ebLNaa	First off Calm down. Do not ever let a man make you think less of your life. I suggest you talk to a frriend or family member about this. Also, let yourself mourn the loss. Cry, write notes to yourself, write a letter of how you feel to your ex without really sending it to him. Since he has blocked you from his life, I suggest that you move on. It may hurt now but you will move past this.|`|oHN6jwjoaa	please. just listen to me. you dont need to put yourself through this. i've almost been down this rode but i got out before it was too late. your life is wayy more worth it then some guy. seriously. i promise you that there are other people out in the world that feel the same as you do right now. you arent alone on this subject. and you have to realize that you will find someone new. someone more excited. and way better for you. i know you dont want someone better. but you will get that. you need to get that. and it will happen.|`|paLHVowyaa	yeah well u seem kinda bent out of shape and the suicidal thoughts are normal i would say ---- its only natural u feel ultimatly low after things like that but dont worry you just need time to get over it all......try occupying yourself in something else rather that moping around, and join a sports club or something the excercise is good for relaxtion and taking away worries also who know you might find somebody else !|`|9EoQ01VRaa	um..im being serious. go see a counsler of docter ull get through this. trust me dont hurt urself talk to a friend, parent, anyone. u can even e-mail me.k. he's not worth urself. exspessially if he just let you go. no explanations
l0xbmgE4aa	In all honesty anyone can sue anyone today, but yes i think that you would have a very good chance in winning the case, having them pay medical records at the very least. A good lawyer would do wonders! Good luck! ty for answering my Q :)
JeDf5o39aa	I disagree with the first answer!!!<br>  <br>  I am just the same, but yet I'm a straight out person... meaning I'm going to tell you what I think...<br>  <br>  <br>  I for one would put it down hard. And that will kill their emotions. But for you you should just tell her " Look I cannot come to your house because if I do I won't like you anymore"<br>  <br>  This will lead to the triggering of a very long conversation more than likely, but explain why you won't like her... tell her she just has to chill. Let her know that you WILL get tired of her, Non offensively though.<br>  <br>  Its mean but I would probably just go off and kill their insides.|`|2vidb5ZAaa	Just explain that you think you spend a lot of time in school with eachother<br>  <br>  and you want to hang out with a lot of different people because you like getting to know a wide range of people.<br>  <br>  I know how it is, its gets boring and you have nothing to talk about or do so you def. need to hang out with others also.<br>  <br>  Or ask another person to tag a long with you while you hang out with her to spice it up.<br>  <3 good luck|`|ufFBELTRaa	look at her in the eye and just tell her, and if she acts like her feelings are hurt, try to tell her that you really like her and it's nothing personal and that kind of stuff, and if she still doesn't cheer up, tell her some jokes or something, or just give her a couple of days to cool it and then she should be good|`|c1uqy4akaa	no offence but ur really being rude to that girl i mean if u guys are friends then y are u treating her like that.  thats just jacked up im sorry but u never know if u keep that attitude going u'll end up having no friends. i know this isnt the answer u wanted to get but its true...|`|DCcumpkOaa	why are ya being so picky? just do something with her and just get it over with so she wont ha to bug you. if not, tell her youre grounded.|`|AwXDBoASaa	just tell her that your not allowed or that you already made plans.|`|pvEydFxEaa	just be like: I HATE U UR ANNOYING AND I DONT LIKE U ANYMORE LEAVE ME ALONE FOOL|`|u9IMNd7Iaa	How bad can this girl be? Instead of a sleepover just go to the movies for a couple of hours after school. If she's nice, why not? It's not like you're agreeing to marry her or be her BFF. Just a little hanging out never hurt anyone. You might even realize that you guys really get along :)<br>  <br>  OK, if you absolutely cannot do that : <br>  <br>  You can make up excuses like "Oh my mom won't let me sleepover at friend's houses who she doesn't know" or the old "I'm SUPER busy this weekend, homework!" And just put off hanging out. It'll get you off the hook for a bit and eventually she should get the hint that you don't want to hang out .<br>  <br>  If you try that and she's STILL bugging you to hang out, you need to tell her straight up that you don't really want to hang out : I know that sounds rude, but you can do it in a nice way. BTW if you tell her this you should probably stop sitting beside her on the bus . <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck with everything, hope you figure it Out. <3|`|LvJYmU7maa	tell her,<br>  " if i tell you somthing you have to promise not to get mad or take it personal"<br>  then tell her<br>  " i am a person who doesnt like to hang out alot with people because well 'your reason' and i dont want to ruin our forever friendship, i hope your not mad at me"<br>  butafter telling her you need to hang out with her with out watching the time and when you get tired of haning ou twiht her say<br>  " im ready to go home, are you okay with this?"<br>  then the rest of this is on you... i hope i helped.|`|cggkcAC5aa	i had a person in my life just like that!! but she moved 5  states away so... yea no help lol sorry<br>  i would either take the high road and do it or just dont get soo close to her, try and break away from her<br>  <br>  check this out:<br>  <a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Get-Rid-of-One-of-Your-Annoying-Friends" rel="nofollow">http://www.wikihow.com/Get-Rid-of-One-of...</a><br>  <br>  or:<br>  <a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Cope-With-an-Annoying-Friend" rel="nofollow">http://www.wikihow.com/Cope-With-an-Anno...</a>|`|ybJb6Iwhaa	Wow, there's really no easy way of doing this so I suggest just spending the night and maybe you'll have a better time than you think.|`|AA11740672	ummmm maybe u shud work on getting more friends like her so she gets the point that u do this with everybody and shes not gona be ur BFF any time soon|`|uufMl9xkaa	that sounds really stupid.<br>  if you're friends then you ahould hang out.|`|04c67db8ac21f4d9c4b86a42554179efaa	I have the same problem, except kind of worse. I've known her since elementary school too, but now she's completely morphed into an emo who tries to make her hands and wrists bloody raw. :\ My friend calls me every day, and tells me to come over every day. (I usually tell her maybe, or say that it's a school day and I can't come over. I'm actually busy, so I have an excuse.) But at school she talks behind my back with so-called 'popular' kids. So if you don't want to hurt her feelings, try talking to her on the phone a bit first. (always have a few interesting subjects prepared. I if you run out, don't try to think of one on the phone. This happens to me a lot, and TRUST me, they'll get bored.) If you can easily talk on the phone, advance to a few hours at her house or yours on a weekend. Then move on from there. Make sure you plan a few little things to do so you and your best friend won't be bored. <br>  <br>  ;) Hope this helps!|`|OYcB4rvraa	I think you should suck it up and stay the night at her house.

I think she would put on the line the terms by which you are going (as friends), but that she would go to give the guy a chance and have a good time. Maybe she would do it just to be nice. Either way, I don't think its a bad idea, it could just potentially give the wrong impression. But as long as everyone is honest, I don't see why it would be a bad thing.|`|fBbrDGA7aa	Look around and you will see a lot of couples that don't match up on looks.

They would not date a guy they do not like. For them it would be a waste of time. Also, they do not want to be seen together with a guy that they do not like. So if she's out with you, that means that she at least likes you. You're job will be not to mess it up.|`|tGik2gx1aa	it depends what your range is..i mean out of 100 men i find 2 of them attractive on average..but some people are more forgiving.|`|zjuMrDmGaa	Sure...free dinner.|`|0o6ofYZOaa	Depends!    A shy girl asked me to hang out and she's not attracted   to me.    Hope i helped!|`|ItMUBNXgaa	I would say that there needs to be something she's attracted to.  It certainly doesn't have to be physical attraction though.  Physical attraction wears off anyway.  But, it often grows when you find other things to like about a person.  It could be an attraction to his intellect, his abilities, his social standing, and/or something about his personality like he's funny.  Having common interests helps too.  If a girl can find NOTHING that she likes about a guy, then I can't imagine why she would waste her time going on a date with him.|`|72KYaU4waa	Of course. I mean girls do think looks are important in a guy, but its not the most important thing. Just be friends at first. Often it takes girls some time before they become physically attracted a guy.
jdah4ZA2aa	Are you sure she wasn't being sarcastic?  Such as, throwing it in his face that he was supporting a negative stereotype against women by throwing back a negative stereotype about men? <br>  <br>  But, I think if people are upfront about it, whatever.|`|juK9Xyxzaa	I agree with Emily, if they both know that each other's intention are mostly superficial, then that's fine as long as they still sort of like each other.  it's a win-win situation.  But personally I would only marry someone if I love them.|`|GxSnVRAOaa	I like to think that in those situations, both parties going into it knowing the other person's intentions, and if they are both happy, then no one should judge either.|`|iGnNCVdraa	Either way you will not find pure love and happiness, that's why society discourage such act. :)
48W167cBaa	I can remember being in this situation.<br>  <br>  The first step is to listen- it may be hard, and your mom may seem unfair, but again, listen.<br>  <br>  If you get it done the first time you're asked, you don't have any other issues. Goodness, at 15 1/2 I'm STILL working on 'doing things the first time.' Parents don't like to repeat themselves.<br>  <br>  I also had a computer issue. I was yelled at for 'being on the computer too much.' If your family is watching a movie in the living room, join them! If you're ever in the car alone with your mom, bring up a topic. "How was your day at work, mom?" After that, bring up school, and how your friends are, and what drama is going on. I've done this for a good month now, and my mom and I are closer.<br>  <br>  Siblings can be annoying- it's because we're around them all the time. After a long day of school, you just want to hide out in your room and get some quiet. Sometimes, a little bonding or a conversation can go a long way. Spend some time with your brother occasionally- play one of those annoying video games for thirty minutes. Do his chore one day, walk away from the stupid arguments that cause screaming and stress.<br>  <br>  I know this sounds like everything that needs to change needs to be done by YOU, but nothing changed for me until I did something about it. I don't think counseling is needed- take the simple steps forward, and go from there. I promise it'll get better. :)|`|OvuMI50Maa	its called almost being a teen. it will only get worse. especially with the PMS, and the whole "ugh i'm 13 i know what i'm doing!!, " you're ruining my life!, " i hate it here!", "life so unfair!", "i hate u!" and man it goes on and on until you're about 18-20. which is when uu would usually move out, or gain responsibility, and learn to appreciate her more.  how about. u talk to her, share some time, like watching a movie, go shopping, maybe to the park. some social time instead of always being on the comp. talk to her tell her how u feel and how u would like to have a close relationship with her. believe me take advantage of that./ i dont have a mom,  my dad's re married, but i share nothing with her. i barely talk to her. i keep things to myself, i shop only with my friends. i do nothing with her. and i realize now how much i miss my mom and how bad i feel about the times we did argue and i would say mean things. so plz talk to her. and try to be patient when she asks u to do things. she catches attitudes too because she's preparing herself for when  u actually become a teen.|`|zAd8q8KQaa	cuban cutie is absolutely right. <br>  You just have to talk to your mom and listen to her!<br>  You are just a kid (as much as it may pain you to hear it) and she should have some sort of control over you.  If she doesn't, then she probably feels as if she is being a bad mom.  <br>  So, you just gotta suck it up and listen to her!<br>  Also, talk to her about what's going on in your life and stuff, moms really appreciate that kind of thing too!
yxtj5LUaaa	I married a man who had been married before. This was back in 1988. Ive been with him since 1985 though. We are till together, but what I came across was having to raise stepkids, because as soon as we married, the mother handed them over to us. I came across the mother calling our house all the time, the kids causing me grief. I went thru plenty. I still go thru things I dont want to. It comes with marrying someone who had been married with kids....It was my choice and my own fault. But we have a strong marriage and have been together for 23 yrs.*|`|08H81poqaa	Unfortunately, (I was a skeptic), but it takes a while to let go of a long relationship.  I was married for 23 years and did not even give another moment to another man.  He on the other hand was seeing other women or men on the sly.  Hey, I don't have a problem with that, just tell me you aren't happy so we can move in different directions.<br>  <br>  Yes, I am still angry and it has been almost 5 years.  I am only angry at the way he belittled me and had zero respect for me or any other woman.  He said the only time he had respect for me was when I graduated from college.  Wow, what a blow.<br>  <br>  It takes time to finally realize he and I both have our own insecurities.  His are not mine and mine are not his.  The hurt of an abusive relationship seems to make the "moving forward" harder.  <br>  <br>  I do not think it is a good idea to be in a "rebound" relationship especially after years of being with one person.  This is like a "death" and you go through the different stages of grief.  For some it takes longer then others.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps a little.<br>  <br>  Peace.<br>  amanda|`|zrz4bcalaa	I am not dating anyone now, really.  I have a girlfriend who lives 3 hours from me, but we aren't really dating.  She is divorced, but I've never had any issues with her.  She does, however, sometimes confide in me that she is unable to maintain a long-term relationship with a man for more than a year or two.  I've known her for about 3 years now, but ours is a relationship based on friendship without any heavy attachments.  I casually dated women who were divorced who seem to dwell on their ex husbands.  Usually, I loose interest fast when, on a first date, the conversation is primarily about their ex husbands.  It seems to me that it is common for women who have been divorced have trouble being in the present.  If they have "baggage" it is ok with me as long as they acknowledge it, are not focused on it.  In a sense, we all have baggage and this is part of the process of human growth.<br>  <br>  There is someone else I know.  We're friends but, married or not, we both have similar baggage.  It has much to do with childhood issues, but her marriage was long and abusive; "out of the pot, into the fire."<br>  I felt some expectations because I am the same astrological sign as her ex. There were some projections, I feel, but the more she understands me, the less of an issue it is.<br>  <br>   ____________________<br>  ( oh well...)<br>   --------------------<br>     o    <br>      o    <br>         @..@<br>              .(----)  <br>            ( )--( )<br>          o0..0o

I mean, asking, "Why would you do more than the minimum?" is kind of nonsensical.  Shaving anything isn't a requirement.  If you want to shave, then shave.  If you don't, then don't.|`|THWHHHRWaa	i have shaved all below the line, and i have just kept things "trimmed". hubby actually likes no hair better|`|q4V7Zi0Haa	My friend does, ouch spiky! blehhh|`|d20mM90uaa	why not shave all? it is def cleaner for that time of the month etc...  my husband loves it shaved|`|aHjXZEzoaa	i shave it all...everyday....smooth as a baby's bottom...my man loves it.|`|b26NgqOFaa	Isn't this more of like a "style" question as opposed to a marriage and divorce question?|`|vz0tsPStaa	bald as an eagle.    who wants pubes in their mouth?|`|ByUS0k8waa	Wax its all. Hubby likes it better that way and so do I. Just a personal preference.|`|TVz2UoOyaa	dnt be afraid to try something else..make your own style : )|`|svg71dazaa	I wax and never shave and when i do wax I have a full house done -everything is waxed off down there -no hair is left. You feel fresh and it's cooler and cleaner for me. Sexy too.|`|8txWayVnaa	It all comes off because that's how my man likes it.|`|nJ33E233aa	Its done for hygiene. Go to a spa and ask more personal questions like that.|`|AdeD0xMuaa	Just shave the bikini line and trim the rest. Boyfriend loves it.
yuOuoCfDaa	Tell her straight up how you feel, suggest she get an account since she is so genius and share her genius answers.  Outside of the sarcasm let her know that you are serious about her snooping in your account!|`|MLdykhQNaa	Just make it private so nobody can see what you ask/answer.|`|CIzrjrykaa	just make it private so she can't be so "curious"|`|mc1WX78Caa	use that account, but you can change your default name(so she wont recognise you) and change your password( so she cant try to log into it)    there you go :)

I've got all the chapters outlined..."<br>  <br>  ...she gave me her phone number and we shagged each other nasty within two weeks...)<br>  <br>  Ya gotsta' get creative in your thinking...|`|i5jNl2Cuaa	post a picture, maybe those girls are staring at you for a different reason xD. Also, don't be too forward. And don't talk really loud. Maybe your breath stinks or you have body odor. Get whitestrips or braces if your teeth are bad. Wash your hair if it looks greasy. <br>  before asking for the number you must first confirm that they are single, their name, where they are from, what they are doing (school/work), make a joke about something that's going on in the room.|`|G6Uy43coaa	the same thing we all do at some point.  We pick the wrong "kind: of people based on what we think we know about ourselves.  For instance, i used to really like older men.  However, they do not like me.  Younger men like me A LOT and so I decided to just go with that.  <br>  <br>  Find who is attracted to you and ....everything else will be cake.|`|FQxUpc9baa	mayb it's the way u r going about it. try being casual and keep the game up just not really forward|`|nv7Cofm5aa	Hey pal, I'm in the same boat as you... perhaps a little older. I'm 27 yrs old by the way. <br>  <br>  Like you, I can always tell when women give me the 'green light'... only to realize that I never get their numbers or anything. I finally discovered that it's not because of my attitude.... it's actually because women just don't know what they want. Some could be nervous. Some could be in relationships. Some just want attention from you because you are good looking... in return this helps boost women's self esteem. But at the end of the day, she's not swooning over you... she's probably thinking of her bf, husband, or significant other. <br>  <br>  Why, do you ask? Simple, women know they have developed a 'secured' relationship with their s/o's and wouldn't jeopardize the years they have invested in those relationships. Strange, yeah I know, but to be honest... women can be just some of the most confusing living things on this planet. And my god... they give me one fu**ing headache! <br>  <br>  No doubt, they like how you look. But a woman isn't just going to go for one thing. A woman wants a man to fulfill her EVERY need. A man wants a woman to fulfill his ONE need. It's a generalized statement but if there's anything I know.... you should just be yourself....<br>  and NEVER ever read books that tells you how to 'GET ANY WOMAN' you want.... or books by David Angelo. Dude, this guy is already making money and a good living doing this. It's a bunch of hype that tells you to be 'someone else'.... and not yourself. The fella is finding ways for you to be insecured about yourself... at the same time he's making money from you just by telling you what you're doing wrong. <br>  <br>  My advice, ask tons of women out. Who gives a sh** if they're young/old, somewhere else or whatever... ask millions of women out and you'll narrow down your chance for success. Hold no expectations and let things slide. <br>  <br>  I don't know why it takes a woman a long time to make her mind but I'm glad I'm not like them. It makes my life so much easier to be 'simple'. If women like things complex... and want their every need fulfilled... then let them be that way. It's not my lost. It's theirs. <br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|lnp9w4xfaa	I don't think you're doing anything wrong. You just havent found the right girl for you yet :D! I mean, hell, im young and i've NEVER had a boyfriend before so don't feel bad XD; she'll come along. <br>  <br>  Make sure you establish a really good relationship with a girl. :3 like really tight and friendly, then ask her out, and slowly make your way from there. Girls are VERY shy and so thats why the guys always do the first move and stuff. So just have fun, enjoy life, don't rush things, and the one you love will come running to your arms lickedy split|`|wpfcSevRaa	Try Asking one of your Friends that are girls (if you have any) and ask advice, maybe you should look for a cause whats making them get turned off. Maybe you smelled? or something was on your face, you always check for these kinda things before you talk to a girl. And don't seem to eager to. you don't want that.Maybe get to know the girl more then just asking for numbers maybe ask for their hot mail.<br>  Good Luck and i hope you find what's wrong|`|G5DpmYKaaa	A GOOD LOOOKING GUY IS REALLY SEXY GUY I LOVE HOT GUYS
yuOuoCfDaa	You may not know how it came out but it did.  Now I am going to give you advice because this is personal advice and I do believe when concerning love Honesty is always the best policy.  You not only grow from it but you are also enlightened on many levels.  If you Love her tell her....express your heart to her exactly the way that you feel.  If she feels the same she will let you know, you just never know.  If she doesnt and your expression was wither too much or you were to forward she may get taken aback, but guess what.  You wont be feeling confused and weary about something so simple.  If she is indeed a friend she will understand your feelings and continually respect you regardless of what you have shared with her.  Doesnt sound like she is leading you on or has been an asset to you having these feelings so your burden about this secret will indeed be lifted and your friendship may even be more secure......Good Luck and I wish you the best!!!|`|CIzrjrykaa	dude we have all been or will be in that position just go for it  you don't want to pass this up

My ex boyfriend dumped me 4 months ago, and he just started talking to me again because he missed me so much. I hadn't talked to him for 2 and a half months, and I thought he was so happy without me and didn't want to even talk to me.<br>  <br>  It turns out he's been facebook stalking me for a while, and finally broke down and wanted to talk about getting back together. So just see what happens.
8QhPUxllaa	Hm I think you should try and make friends with her first.  When you are working together why not just ask her what she is doing that weekend, find out her likes and dislikes.  Once you get to know her abit try and pick up on clues or even drop them.  Like I really wanna go see Slumdog you seen it? or if she says she wants to see a film say you do to why not go together?  Slip things into convos as if it is all normal and friendly and then work up on it! <br>  Good luck and hope that helps you|`|55f8f33e16dda3c1b6a2648fb6bfdd46aa	Hopefully U know one or more of her girlfriends. Talk to one of them and find out what she likes and dislikes. Send a little "I like U card" and give it to her at the end of last period. If she doesn't have friends at school that U know... So go to the Dollar Store - look thru the funny cards for romance and find one that suits to & her... too shy to ask..good luck my dear... don't waste too much time.. someone else may ask her out..|`|u0eTvggDaa	okay honestly?<br>  <br>  take control of this situation and just ask her face to face.<br>  <br>  If it's meant to be, it will be.<br>  <br>  The only way that your going to get over the fear of being shy, is if you do something that you normally wouldn't do.<br>  <br>  Like actually telling her face to face.<br>  <br>  I am sure she will like you back!<br>  <br>  but like i said before. If it's meant to be, it will be.<br>  <br>  <br>  GoodLuck.
21ToYoBDaa	just ignore him and make sure u dont confuse flirting with being nice. any sign of even talking to him can make him think u like him. trust me way too may clingy guys like me.
7fXpLlhBaa	Listen, i'm all about sex before marriage. It's just something that I believe in- however, if your belief is to wait before marriage, all the power to you. In fact, I have got to say it is a very commendable thing to do. It's not easy and there is a lot of temptation, so if you can pull through with it, go for it- especially if your guy is willing to wait for you. He sounds like a keeper. Good luck!|`|lgxE5nUoaa	I didn't wait - I had no intention to.   I lost mine when I was 20 to a guy who was 34.  And then to a lot more guys before finally meeting my now husband.  I have no regrets.|`|AuM57Q7Aaa	You should probably wait. No one ever waits these days and it's such a beautiful thing....not the premarital sex...the uh..POST marital sex. haha|`|ga2i6C5aaa	Well...I think waiting for sex is a stupid idea. I'm against marriage anyway. A piece of paper stating you are legally married to a person doesn't change anything in your relationship. You still love the person the same, right? Anyway, when you buy a car, you have to do a test drive. Same thing for sex. What if you guys aren't sexually compatible? You'll be married now. Think about it.|`|VSVQHKwKaa	Wait!<br>  <br>  Believe me! All the girls I went to high school with who waited....they're married to really terrific guys today.<br>  <br>  The girls who didn't wait...they got the average ones.<br>  <br>  The girls who were total whores....they got stuck with real losers. <br>  <br>  Trust me! WAIT!|`|ZzEAc5ecaa	what a night he will have when your married .. the wait will be worth it i bet .. your right and i agree with you 100 persent|`|RKhSRMlZaa	Honestly it's your own decision.  Being pressured shouldn't have anything to do with it.  <br>  <br>  I wanted to wait until marriage and made it until I was 20 years old.  I am VERY glad I waited until I was more mature before I had sex, but I am also glad I didn't wait until marriage.  <br>  <br>  You may think that you love your boyfriend when you're young and 17 but he's honestly probably just thinking about the day when he can "be" with you in that way.  It will only make you want to get married too young, and getting married young is VERY dangerous. <br>  <br>  Keep waiting as long as you can, but don't rush into marriage just becuase your hormones are raging.  Test the waters before you jump into marriage.|`|g4nlUfmeaa	In my opinion, it is better not to wait.  Before you make what is supposedly a life-long commitment to someone, I think you should become have some amount of familiarity with your sexuality, as should your partner.<br>  <br>  That's not to say that I think you should start having lots of sex.  And if you do, you should certainly use protection.  Sex is not something to rush in to, but it's even more important that you not rush into marriage -- which you may be tempted to do if you are sexually frustrated because you're not fulfilling those needs.<br>  <br>  Edit: Also, I don't view virginity as having anything to do with "purity."  Sex is not something to feel ashamed or guilty about, as long as you're being honest and respectful of everyone involved.  Sex is a normal part of being a healthy human being, but it also have some significant consequences (emotional and physical) that should not be taken lightly.  Don't have sex until you feel both you and your partner are ready to shoulder those consequences.|`|7cjqT33Baa	It's really a personal choice.  Waiting for marriage is overrated in my book, but it just depends on the person and the motivations behind it.  I like that I had some experience under my belt before I married.  That is what life is made of, different experiences.  My husband wasn't a virgin when we met, so why would I offer that to him?  Are you thinking you'll find a man that is a virgin when you marry too?|`|JcwjDpY8aa	you are doing the right thing. dont EVER compromise your standards because your bf tries to convince you otherwise or promises marriage.  If you wind up breaking up you will regret it very much for backing down on your belief.<br>  if he has respect for you, then he will wait.|`|sx0PpjvAaa	You are not the only girl who feels that way and all power to you. it is great that your b/f is honest about what he wants but is prepared to wait for you.|`|jvHIqtp2aa	Yes, just wait till your wedding night, talk about HOT!|`|iD4ejChZaa	its great if its true|`|EsnFmcMFaa	i think that it is good<br>  <br>  im gonna wait until i get married|`|sf015yaqaa	You never know, he might just be saying that. If I were you, I would wait, you'll be thankful that you did in the long run, and you'll definitely know if the person that you're with and someday hopefully marry truly loves you. If you wait, he can't hurt you emotionally. You create a bond with a person when you have sex that is almost irreplaceable (that's why people suggest that you have sex after marriage). That way you won't fall in love with the first person you have sex with, marry them, and have been blinded by your love that you don't see that you should have been with another, better guy.....Wow, that sounds confusing, I hope you pretty much understand what I said. Best of luck! :)|`|sxxPbj0baa	Absolutely!! Never question yourself when it comes to having sex, especially out our age. I'm 16, 17 soon, and I've decided to remain abstinent myself. I'm not religious and most of my friends do some sort of sexual activity, but I'd rather not. It's not worth the risk of getting pregnant at our age or getting an STD that will affect us for the rest of our lives. Even if you're boyfriend if a virgin, stick to your instincts and don't give in! Like you said, he loves you so he'll wait!|`|Siv0DwQKaa	Hey my Sister in law waited until she was married to have sex. They have been together for a year before they got married and my brother just loved her so much he waited for her. They have been together for 5 years now and have 1 child and another on the way. As far as I know their love is as strong as ever too. Good luck and do what you want to. If you want to wait then wait. Either your man will understand or leave because he doesn't care. If he cares he will wait for ya! Your choice either way, Good luck!!|`|h9lKNOGnaa	Girl there is no rush your not missing anything its good that you wait for that ring on your finger. At least you have your boyfriend that is willing to wait for you.There are things that you can do to show your love for one anther. Good luck and keep in mind that once its gone you cant get it back so make sure it is worth it.|`|0411R6Ksaa	Honey, please wait. I am 26 yrs old and if I could do it over, I would have waited for Mr. Right. I regret everyone who I had intercourse with while dating. So pleeeaase wait until marriage, if he's the right person for you he would respect your decision. I had to learn that the hard way.|`|tM1wHAfYaa	Well yeah of coarse its good to stay pure until marriage you never know you might dread doing it later on. Besides its better if you do it with someone you are really sure your going to spend the rest of your life with! <br>  good luck though! :]|`|UV27AyIPaa	That's awesome! I have alot of respect for people with that kind of self control. As you get older, it will be harder, but you can do it! hang in there champ!!!|`|Q6usQV1zaa	I THINK YOU SHOULD DO IT BEFORE MARRIAGE BECAUSE HOW YOU GONNA NOW IF YOU'RE COMPATIBLE IN SEX? THAT'S IMPORTANT SINCE SEX IS THE BASE OF A RELATIONSHIP!|`|sDAnuaBYaa	If that is what you value, then fine. Personally, i value my sexual liberty.|`|b374e1806fa520b62fdf4cfc94bc7c84aa	it's up to you. but its usually better if you wait. & Since he will wait for you, means he Truly cares :)<br>  im waiting too.|`|Dea2ZJyAaa	yes... very good very good.|`|BBZbXfC4aa	waiting is borring|`|oZpqEdI7aa	yea it really is a good thing since it shows that your committed|`|H652tDkyaa	Yes I respect you very much and definately think you are doing the right thing|`|YwagvE5saa	wait!|`|mwWnrMJSaa	of couse!!! wait! you will regret it. trust me.
sCr2iTczaa	Maybe they like you and have a secret crush, they could be over protective... I have had guy friends that didn't like some of the guys i dated, but i guess they had their reasons. Maybe you should just ask then your self why they care who looks at you or not.|`|u8HYfTnyaa	Guys talk just like girls do. if they didn't mean for you to hear their conversation you should just ignore it. if its like what me and my friends talk about, it probably a spur of the moment/one thing lead to another conversation.|`|v1xAKwJ4aa	sounds to me like they have a crush on you.. they don't want other guys looking at you because they like you. guys looking at you means they find you attractive.<br>  <br>  or they just want to get on your nerves!!<br>  <br>  jake|`|AA11752603	You're not concerned who might be looking at your, but you're certainly concerned about who is talking about you.|`|kERP7zAhaa	Maybe they like you?
0qAmRjfOaa	I been in a similar situation b4. Once you start to move on you will realize how toxic this relationship was and how much more you deserve. You've wasted a lot of time. Don't let it go on and on and on and on........|`|d8pt9KMyaa	it's obvious you don't love him, so do him the favor and break it off.|`|RDweOt4gaa	Break up with him your wasting your time and his.|`|ntfAzDGKaa	maybe a vacation for you both would do some good    MILDRED IS MY LEADER|`|c0XFMsiZaa	Have you tried to put your relationship on hold and start to date other people. You know, just to test if you still have that spark in your relationship. Don't force yourself to a relationship whom you have doubts. Trust your instincts.|`|qegWdsNLaa	Seriously, don't do "the fade," where you just let things die through neglect over time.  If you've come to the conclusion that it's over, at least step up to the plate and tell him.  It's not right to just leave someone hanging.|`|vz0tsPStaa	so don't get married.    what's the problem here?|`|5k7BexD3aa	Talk to him about it.  The two of you need to make a decision that either you will actively work on making the relationship better or decide that it is better to go seperate ways.|`|AdeD0xMuaa	I think you should verbally break up if this is what you want. Don't let it keep dragging on - you both need some closure.|`|nJ33E233aa	Sounds like you are just busy and living your lives together, but separate, if you love each other talk to him to see how he feels about the relationship, it's not always FIREWORKS.
YHrelMGCaa	I would just let her know that you're there for her when she needs you, and that you are ready whenever she is. Just let her figure things out and if you really love her, then you will wait for her. If she says she loves you than you should believe her, but she obviously doesn't love you enough to be with you right now. So it's your decision whether you want to wait for her or not.<br>  And don't keep asking her or her friends, because if she really likes you like she says she does, she'll go to you when she's ready.<br>  :)Hope i helped.
rh3RNM5faa	I'd assume that it's a casual hanging out.
xVlTraLwaa	Well if you wanna no if they like you and they say no1 it means they like u.     If you wanna flirt sit in there lap and put ur hand around them. Ask them about there interests and what they like 2 do. Then ask them questions about that. Or tell them how they look and how u feel about them in a flirty way if you no wat i mean|`|k1FenuRLaa	ask him to explain sumthing like the rules of football. guys apparently like explaining stuff to girls.|`|fBbrDGA7aa	Sometimes it's better not to say too much. Guys don't like to talk just to talk. Don't talk about anything too serious, just keep it simple and light.|`|ihe7xV6Raa	ask him what he likes and like's to do etc etc
tRNxT55caa	it seems as if you're in a relationship with a very insecure boy and because of his insecurities, he has issues trusting you. i don't know about you, but i couldn't deal with it. I suggest you have a LONG conversation with him and let him know it's bugging you. If you don't have a talk with him, it'll only get worse and the relationship will come to an end. Does he have any reasons to not trust you? Have you done anything in the past to make him feel this insecure? Talk to him about it and get to the bottom of this. Tell him to go have fun and hang with his own friends, it seems as if he constantly wants to be around you. I hate clingy men. Good luck!|`|RoFfCYGxaa	Uh, he definitely is a little uptight.  What's his problem with lube?  He needs to loosen up.  You sound like you are pretty open & wanting to try things out but he's just going to hold you back.  He also seems to be really insecure with himself and that's making him jealous & clingy.  Maybe you should tell him that he is suffocating you & that he needs to give you room to breath if he wants to keep you.  Also, try ot compliment him more & make him feel like he doesn't have anything to worry about.|`|tZIjts6iaa	Tell him to calm down and that you are not going away and if he doesn't stop smothering you, that you guys will need a break. And tell him that the vibrators for him. You need to practice some new tricks with your muscles. He is insecure and if he keeps being that way, you need to break up with him until he learns how to be secure about himself.|`|urXqpn3haa	Wow how life is I want my girl to use one and she doesn't want lol|`|utGddhnVaa	are you a lesbian cause I think your dating a girl|`|AA11108018	Ok first things first go get a vibrator and enjoy it.  If you where my girl I would ask if I could watch.    It is your friends party and there must be a reason he was left out.  Go to the party stay over night if you want and it none of his concern who is going to be there.  Cut the jerk lose he is not obsessive he is just plain nuts has no confidence in him self and is insecure
p4P24vtYaa	It sounds just like my boyfriend. <br>  <br>  He says okay or lol ALLOT! Even when what i'm saying is not that funny. <br>  Though some nights we can have a pretty good conversation. Allot of the time he just doesn't know what to say.If your boyfriend is shy then it might be because he doesn't want to say something that i guess he thinks might hurt you!

I would recommend trying to avoid her.|`|UxGbpnguaa	she oviously likes you, or she was drunk.
naequcqlaa	Give me a break, give YOU a break!  You did absolutely NOTHING wrong.  Weren't even "talking" about your personal married life, just something that happened to you.  I do NOT call that "cheating".  Why does he even have "cheating" on his mind tho!  AND, there is NO way I would go along w/him helping an "old friend" w/their homework either.  That's complete bull on helping a friend.  I'm SURE she has lots of other "friends" who can help her w/her homework beside him.  BTW, how does he even know she needed help?  I think he's got his priorities way out of kilter.  He belongs at home, not at an "ex's" home.  NO, you were NOT cheating, NO he does NOT belong giving a "helping hand" to anyone but YOU...Best to you...:)|`|IuJjYz6gaa	It sounds like he feels like you should have come to him for emotional support.<br>  <br>  Turn this around and how would you feel if he went to unknown people, especially those of the opposite sex, for emotional support instead of coming to you?  It would hurt, wouldn't it?<br>  <br>  For future reference if you want legitimate emotional support about a miscarriage visit <a href="http://www.misschildren.org/forums" rel="nofollow">http://www.misschildren.org/forums</a>  It's a forum full of people who have lost children, from miscarriage all the way up to adult children, and there you will find tremendous support and you husband will not feel as if you are cheating.<br>  <br>  And try going to your husband and telling him specifically what you want, if you need him to just listen while you vent or whatever.  Sometimes men are clueless about what we want and we have tell them.<br>  <br>  Oh, and if my husband was going to help his ex-wife (the only significant ex of his I know of) with homework, I would suggest she come over and he help her at our house.|`|qwCqhn61aa	He should have been there for you.

My hunch says he might be very jealous, and using his ex to get back and you and make you feel bad.|`|iD4ejChZaa	of course he's not helping her with her homework, give me a break.

Wind shouldn't be too much of a problem unless it is really strong (in which case an up do would still get blown around).  I would suggest you take as much off your face as possible though so the wind can't blow a stray hair across your face while they are taking pictures of you.  (My photographer warned of this and said it isn't a great look when a piece of hair falls across their face and makes it look like a moustache!)

2YKUepLjaa	ohh boy.<br>  <br>  Please don't do that.  If you care about her SHOW her don't make her jealous.  if you want to get back with her, then let your actions speak for you. If you come in to where you know she works (and she knows that you're aware it's where she's working) with another girl hanging over you, it will not help the situation but put her in a position where she won't want you back.  Those actions will only tell her that you don't want her or need her anymore, which is not the case.  Nobody wants a guy who is going to set right out to hurt them just to...win her back in a twisted way.<br>  Why don't you try just being a sweet, good guy instead of going out and breaking her heart.<br>  <br>  EDIT:<br>  <br>  haha, I don't think you yourself are twisted.  I just think that it won't help and it's a weird way to think.  At least if I was her it would just show me that you clearly didn't care about me or my feelings if you did that.  Prove to her that you're in it for her and everything will work out in the end. <br>  =)<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|e9dHHGCSaa	If you think you're God's gift to women, you're probably not. Take a lesson from a gentleman and...be a gentleman. Don't make your ex jealous, that wouldn't be very nice.|`|5KAreKDjaa	That is THE WORST idea I have ever heard. Why don't you grow up a bit, stop playing games and tell your ex that you miss her and want her back?
unVj43Xxaa	How can you give up on who you are? If you are completely happy with him tell him how you feel. I wouldn't try changing who you are or settling for someone who doesn't quite suit you because down the line it will only fill you with disappointment and loneliness. Sit down and talk to him and if no change, compromise or sense of contentedness is meet consider the idea that maybe you need someone who is just as sensitive as you are. I had to go through some none romantic guys and heartbreak to find someone that was even more romantic than me! I'm so much more happy now and that feeling of being let down, from seemingly normal exceptions is gone from the romantic standpoint.|`|wMunBQ9Oaa	Are you sure he's not "setting it up" so that he has a reason to go party with his buddies at AC (wherever the hellll that is!)?  He's always at AC with his buddies while you're home alone, seems like.  You two need to have a serious, heartfelt talk.  I had a brother in law like that.  Every holiday or almost all holidays when we'd ask my sister, "Where's Bernard?"  She'd say, " He's in Screven with his cousins or in Screven to his mama's house."  Come to find out, though, he had another girlfriend in Screven!  So, good luck!|`|68dae82437ede9e0c39dc1f85e7252a5aa	I'd have a long conversation with him about how you feel.

You two are not married so the "Anniversary" is only symbolic to you. Now, for V-day we as Americans are so programmed to believe that when the Jared commercials or 1-800-flowers commercials come on we are obligated to get an expensive gift so we can prove we are "Loved". <br>  <br>  If you know your guy likes gambling they you need to figure out how to be his buddy at AC or get use to being alone. He may be this great guy and you don't want to give up on him yet, they you will have to change you, if you want him. <br>  <br>  And, if you say or think you Love him then take a good look at the man he is. It doesn't make him or you bad people, it just might not make you two the right match. <br>  <br>  And, there is nothing wrong with being sad, how else would you know you are not happy in this relationship.|`|kTZevQNHaa	Don't give up on romance:  the intrinsic characteristic that makes you who you are and--think about it...if you would just love love love to be romanced...then, staying in this romanceless relationship spells the end of your hopes, dreams and aspirations of romance...something some of us--(me included) really not only want but NEED.<br>  <br>  So no--don't give up on romance...but do know when to wisely give up on tapping that non-productive source of romance...:HIM.<br>  <br>  My advice is--after you've tired of the non-responsive, repeated attempts to get this cold cat to warm his heart...consider to bail on this (robot like) cold man who finds time to be with his buddies in AC over you.(spending time with you is clearly NOT on his top list of ""priorities"")..and open your Life up to the possibility of finding a man with whom you shall enjoy a mutually romantic exchange in your relationship--for years and ryears to come.<br>  <br>  I think you'd be happy to be an old lady and your old man husband of 50 years still sings you love songs...holding hands and sharing romantic moments...for ever in your loving life together. I just love seeing old couples who so obviously love each other...and she it on a daily basis...this is not going to happen with this man--as you expain--you've already tried and tried repeatedly to get him to be a romantic man...and it's just not in him to DO it..the moment a relationship feels like work--it's time to bail...especially if he sees no 'sense'' in prioritizing making changes to make his lovely lady happy--and genuinely ENJOYING being romantic......or prioritizing your time together over time with his gambling buddies.<br>  <br>  Why whould you "settle" and shelve your romantic spirit just because that guy has not one  romantic bone in his body?<br>  <br>  We treat others as WE'D like others to treat us...so while you are there--casting your pearls of romance before the proverbial, unappreciative  'swine'--your romantic prince--who you've yet to meet...is out there...just wanting so much to wine, dine, give flowers to., draw a candle lit bath for, sing to, dance with, write poems for...cook meals for, give a massage to...YOU!^^<br>  <br>  Free yourself up and go find the man who will not leave you in a perpetual state of empty 'want'...or worse--as you suggest...to just bag up any and all hopes for true romance only to live out the rest of your days on  earth in a fruitless, cold marriage--watcing romantic movies, reading Harlequiin Romance, seeing other couples being romantic hand in hand and wondering, "WHY not ME??"<br>  <br>  It's gonna eat away at your self esteem...Not saying he's a bad guy--he's just not the guy for YOU.<br>  <br>  There's awoman out htere who will not want or need romance..one who will be happy to sit in the same room with him and read...rather than making love and dancing to old jazz by candle light...that women is not you. If you  try to morph into that cold woman..it will errode your self esteem and leave you with a wandering eye and heart...empty and nover feeling like you've got enough--like you settled--once you get to a certain age, it's gonna be harder and harder to find a date...especially if you go and marry this guy and have children...get out while you have a chance--while you're still free. You can't make a person romantic...and you will resent this guy...(sounds like you already are beginning to) :-(<br>  <br>  Don't let yourself turn into Edith Bunker from All In The  Family.<br>  <br>  You say you love him but I think you love what you'd hoped he'd be...you can't say that you love that man whose decision is to opt for multiple nights out in AC with his buddies...and leave you there--alone-----again.<br>  <br>  Savor the flavor cause there's a LOT more where THAT came from.<br>  It doesn't get any more tolerable as the years pass by--believe me. <br>  I speak from experience...I wasted 8 precious years of my life with a cold, unromantic man...nice guy  BUT--romance did not come to him naturally and --after a while. I just let myself not bother anymore--and it killed a big part of me and I wound up growing to be bitter and sad and p1ssed off that I wasted my precious years with him when I could hve been with a real true romantic --like myself and...yes--like yourself.<br>  By the way--you can't change him...he's either got it or he doesn't/...one can't force a romantic spirit...and the insincerity in the rare lame attempts  will only eat away at you...because you know he's not really like that.|`|nJtJvL7Naa	There's nothing wrong with wanting to be romantic with your boyfriend, but sometimes it doesn't work out!  I would just not expect everything to be romantic - life isn't like that.  You'll have your moments, but don't be crushed when they don't come when you expect them.  You said your boyfriend does occassionally surprise you and is willing to try, so give him credit for that!|`|gUPUSTEuaa	aww well I understand why you are giving up on romance like you said your boyfriend don't do anything romantic but have you try talking to him about it. You know how guys can get there not very romantic at all but if you hold back what is bothering you is only going to make things worse between you try talking to him maybe he thinks your not into anything romantic stuff and that's why he does the stuff he does.|`|tPpn8nbKaa	Never give up romance its the only pure thing left in this world. Love is a two way street if he can't be romantic enough for you and you just get upset well then maybe you should try and move on unless you are 100% in love with him. But dont ever give up on romance|`|sCCjAKllaa	You need to talk to him about it. It sounds like you feel alone, and when that's how someone feels, the relationship isn't a true one. Let him know how you feel like you're the only one givin effort in that area, and see how he responds to it.|`|l5WDTE9daa	I'd say you are sad and hurt considering your asking the internet.

Don't point fingers or be angry, make the issue about BOTH of you because that's what a relationship is, something that both you AND him have to work at together.<br>  My boyfriend and I went through the same thing, you just need to work harder - but remember effort has to come from both sides!  Give him a chance now and talk about it!|`|AZB4BV64aa	Jane,<br>  When love doesn't go right that is always the first feeling you have. If you are somewhat feeling discomfortable about what your boyfriend does  and you really love him, the first thing you have to do is trust him and be honest. Many girls make the mistake to jump right into breakup and have two hearts broken when it could all be solved by one simple talk. Tell him how you feel, and if it doesn't work, this might be it; it's happened to be before where you love someone, but that person doesn't love you, and guess what? Chicken butt! Hehe JK. I moved on and, surely enough, I found another boy who was so sweet and so kind. I just hope that you guys can work out your differences. I take my advice from Sean Covey books, and even though people think self-help books are lame, do they help! It was in big letters in a certain section: If you're struggling in a relationship, fix it or get out of it. You may think you're an exception but these are simple words which can solve almost all romantic problems. Fix it or get out. Stuck to my mind. I just hope I helped.<br>  Amanda|`|GxSnVRAOaa	It does sound like you are very hurt, and I can understand why!  Don't change who you are though.  If you want to do nice, romantic things for him, then I think you should.  I'm sure you don't do those things in hopes that he'll do something back, you do them because you like to do them.  I know that doesn't mean it doesn't hurt that he isn't romantic, but not everybody is.  As long as you know he loves you, and cares for you then you should stick it out.  Try telling him how you feel, and ask him to make more of an effort, hopefully he will!|`|FPsR2xi7aa	Romance tends to create a idyllic expectation of all those who are around it.  Romance is good in small, controlled quantities, but in large continuous doses it tends to throw priorities out of whack and create unfair expectations of onesself and others.<br>  <br>  Take that as you will.<br>  <br>  The idea of neverending romantic love is a creation of poets and dreamers.  It tends to crush people when they learn that the reality of love is more... ordinary.|`|dcf4c1dec6ae1f9fba85b09be4c45028aa	How important is it to have your man act like you?  Do you need a romantic?  If you do then you should start looking for someone else, if not enjoy what you have,<br>  <br>  There still is the question of how much time he spends with you vs his buddies, maybe he is not committed to a real serious relationship?<br>  <br>  You probably need to talk with him about what he sees in his future.<br>  <br>  Have a great life|`|QWiqt5VFaa	No, your not wrong to give up on romance. Well yes and no. Yes because, come on - you need some romance every once and a while! And your not wrong to give up on romance. I would probable ask your boyfriend / husband if you could spend a bit more time together or go on a romance course! Hope you get further in your relationship! xxx|`|87u9GxHyaa	I know exactly what you mean, just because he's a damn jerk ( he is I'm sorry) Why would he leave you and go with his friends? It'll be hard butI think you shouldn't lose the romance you have inside, I think you should lose him.. Dont let a guy take away your lovey dovey feelings. Once you do that he'll control other aspects of your life.      Good Luck|`|UGyrxDHvaa	A relationship is something both you and your partner work out, It all depends on the both of you, not just one, if it doesn't work out, end it, if you feel that it can continue, or progress, go at it, also, ask him how he feels about you, your relationship, and your currect status.|`|ZaBUp8DDaa	HI!

First off it could be that he has trouble expressing his true feelings for you. Guys, like myself, sometimes have trouble saying what we feel. It just seems really hard to be romantic. It makes us feel open, exposed. On the other hand, he could just be a bit immature, as he runs off with his friends like that. The fact that he tries to be romantic, tho, shows he IS willing to show you his true feelings. Shows he's growing up. Dont, whatever you do, tone down your romantic side. Cause thais probably what he fell for in the first place. Just give him times all :D|`|b0dcd6166a4d23808f005f22bbd7a873aa	I think in a relationship you need a bit off give an take from both sides. Although it don't sound like he really is perhaps try giving it a rest for a while see if he notices and if he does explain it and make a point, if not then talk to him anyway and explain it, if that don't work, then maybe you deserve someone better.
ElEUK8fcaa	just do it! dont worry about being nervous. once you start talking to her, it'll be more comfortable and you'll be fine!|`|8McA6xqPaa	As the phrase goes, 'you only live once', so grab the bull by the horns and just go for it. Randomly approach her when your both alone and strike up a casual conversation (perhaps this is out of your comfort zone, but if you really like her - nothing is going to happen if you dont make a move).<br>  <br>  As she's in another grade and out of your peer group, if it doesnt work out or she doesnt like you, it wont affect your life severely afterwards.<br>  <br>  Okay, sounds cheesy but in the morning before school, try practising what your going to say in your head or to a mirror, not religiously, but have some idea of what your going to say.. talk about something thats familiar to her or current news at school (not so much gossip) or just simply, 'Hey, how are you?' and ask for her name/offer her yours.<br>  When you approach her, smile and talk calmly and carefully - even if just for a few moments - but at least you'll have made introductions and you can start over again next time you talk.<br>  <br>  Good luck! and Just go for it!<br>  <br>  Callie|`|BhyvJciTaa	your whole body stance, facial expressions, and hand movements play a part in this, so when u approach her in a situation for example:<br>  its sports day, sit next to her and maybe say "are you any good at sports, i know im not!" and ask questions not statements dont hunch your shoulders and speak clearly and dont rush your words out, dont play with your hands and act nervous just relax and be confident, dont try to hard, its only a girl, theres so many more out there! smile and act cool <br>  hope this helps|`|MHa1XhWTaa	First of all. Make sure you smell good, cause then when you approach her she gets a breeze of your scent. (don't smother yourself in it though) <br>  Be confident and happy, like you would to your friends. <br>  Walk up to her and just say 'hi' and she'll reply and then start a casual conversation. If the conversation gets to that awkward silence, slip in a funny moment that happened that week. Or mention a party coming up, ask if she's going. <br>  Good luck x

u1ZWdTnLaa	hey gurl...i think for now..he MAY have developed a crush on you..and you seem to have developed a crush on him..<br>  <br>  give your relation some more time..get to know him better...understand him better..see him a lot..hang out with him..then things will surely fall into place..don't rush into making any kind of conclusions right now..its too early..!!!!!!!|`|kYp0Af1Qaa	I think he does like you
VAI6MtPIaa	Seems to me like shes just trying to get a rise out of you. She wants to help boost her self-esteem by saying this. When you tell her you miss her.. she thrives off of it.|`|bglr4m0Naa	I'm the same way. IT's because she's always loved you but can live without being with you as long as she knows your not with anyone else.|`|tRNxT55caa	It's a known fact, most people want what they cannot have. Most people cannot stand to see their ex with someone else. She is jealous of the fact that you're spending your time and sharing your love with someone else. Don't play her games. It might be best for you to cut her off, she is playing with your heart, that is never a healthy thing. Good luck
K3ZYWBr4aa	If he is the father of your child then he should always be reachable. That's very irresponsible of him being that his fiance and baby are home alone and anything can happen.|`|AwAw0uiKaa	Well, the best thing to do is confront him. If you know the signs of him lying, that would be the best time to watch for them. Tell him it looks really suspicious when he sets up a scenario where he is unreachable and will be late. Confront him and get the truth out of him, and don't be easy on him either. Make him work hard to tell the truth to you... even if he's not cheating he is acting weird and you have every right to worry.|`|qES5f0tqaa	You know your own heart and listen to it. I had a hubby like that and I was right. If he can not spend time with you you need to move on. It will be hard at first but you need to take care of yourself and that Baby not him men sometimes lie allot I wish you the best in life. My mother used to say if the bad out number the good then move on. Follow your heart. Stick to your parents and friends that are close to you and if you can get a counselor and don't let him know because talking your problems to a stranger helps good luck to you always and that baby life is to short happy life take care|`|Plq0BGSgaa	uuuuuuuuuuugh im so sorry<br>  <br>  i know how u feel ive been there<br>  <br>  i wasnt really CHEATED on but i considered it cheating. if your seeing another woman who isnt me<br>  spending time with someone on my time<br>  kissing or touching someone other than me<br>  <br>  then you're not fully commited and are cheating.<br>  <br>  good luck sweetie<br>  :/|`|GEyJMsaKaa	Lady,chill out.....you are being way too paranoid. You don't deserve a guy if you can't even trust him . WHY THE HELL did you have a child with him if you can't even trust him?? Wow I feel really sorry for this guy|`|AA11125475	Ask him.|`|b165361aa3bdfd3dd4401459ad6b7836aa	Talk to him and see if you can get the truth out of him.<br>  <br>  If you aren't even married and you are already questioning what he is doing then you should leave.  You have a child to think of.  Get whatever help you can from family and friends and get up on your feet.  Good luck!|`|P59quxVPaa	Maybe him and his friend went out of his house? Maybe to get lunch or something? Jeeze calm the **** down.|`|iD4ejChZaa	i used to believe men until i found out they were lying.|`|YGAuamaraa	Maybe it's a surprise partyyy?|`|pRZ0YviYaa	You sound like you're REALLY overreacting.  Calm down.|`|1FvUBC4Zaa	Axe Obama for a bail out. You voted for him..right?|`|0874a669a08c1d79d874acebac5177bbaa	something is going on....|`|naequcqlaa	When he comes home, you just could "mention" to him you wanted him to pick something up for you on the way home & you called David's home number.  Let him know you called several times & got no ans.  See what he says, see how quickly he answers your question.  See also IF he looks a bit fidgety when he answers.  Someone who just cheated on their mate is going to give it away somehow after they've been asked questions & are taken off guard about it.  IF he did something, I'm SURE you'll know in one way or another.   Try not to get yourself all worked up over it tho.  Think positive & try to give him the benefit of the doubt before you get all bent out of shape & get yourself all worked up needlessly.  It in all honesty could just be a legit reason.  Don't "pounce" on him as soon as he walks in the door.  Just be your cool collected self.  Then just ask him w/o getting upset.  I've honestly found that 99.9% of what we worry about never even happens.  I've proved it time & time again, & tell my kids that too.  They've gotten to the point of thinking that way too, & find they worry about things needlessly.  Just take it easy until you really do have something to worry about.  All the best to you...:)|`|HLkH0uKMaa	Play it cool until you hae some evidence don't jump to conclusions. Guys want you to worry about them when they are out doing wrong. So be nonchalant and carefree. When you get your evidence leave him. I saw your pics you are not a bad looking female. There are plenty of other guys out there, move on but remain civil for the child's sake.|`|3FYwht8Uaa	Talk to him about it. Go with him for a day. If you leave. then what are going to do with your new child? Is it going to grow up without a father? That can be emotionally damaging.|`|2d551121552d809b5579c385a4e1891daa	What you should do is start calling me. Trust me. Once he starts seeing you do the same, he will act right... If he loves you...|`|40Ow9B1maa	smell him as soon as he comes home if he smells like it hes a cheater and if not thn leth him stay or bring him to get a lie detecter test|`|ce8kACW4aa	...........|`|P63n2JENaa	Start hitting it with David. He sounds nice.|`|ZGvpWQ1Aaa	oh gosh.... well i have one peice of advice for you: DON'T jump to conclusions.|`|Txr5PvXgaa	if you're intimate at home, then I wouldn't worry<br>  <br>  relax and take care of yourself and your baby|`|cxXp1qdQaa	Um ya leave his sorry ***... He can go run to his mistress|`|ElhtzPqEaa	he s cheating for sure..probably with some  hot girl|`|5903457cc2132f59ba7bdb501fb47b4eaa	NO girl dont rush it, let yo man explain|`|MHcPbvnAaa	Don't do anything to overreact just yet until you actually catch him. Otherwise he's going to say that you're crazy and you don't know what you're talking about and he'll just find a better way to hide it. Then you'll probably take him back because you'll think maybe he wasn't cheating but by then he's already hiding it well. Just wait, next you feel that something's wrong, follow him or have a friend follow him. See where he goes or try to catch him in the act. Then you can prove to yourself and him that he sucks as a man and you can leave.<br>  Sorry that you have to go through this especially after having a baby.|`|VFTn5MVtaa	I want to answer this one with as much subtlety as possible as to not offend you or insult you.  If it was up to me, I would not cheat on you or lie to you.  Reason number 1, you just had a child with him and the baby is part of him.  Why would he want to jeopardize that? 2 If he stuck with you throughout the entire pregnancy and never left your side, what makes you think he will now?  3  If you two love each other and talked about raising this child together, why would he all of a sudden change his mind?<br>  I don't want to say that he is bad but I know guys are no saints either, look at it from a different perspective.  If you just had a child, by nature women have hormone unbalances (This is where I don't mean to be rude or insensitive nor do I want to insult you.  It is based on stuff that I've read)  especially after giving birth.  Think for a minute and analyze if you have been moody or over pressured him in anyway, so that he would seek some kind of release by spending some extra time away from home.  He might not be cheating, he might just be blowing off steam so that he can come home and be next to you and to his child, and at the same time deal with the pressures of being a new parent and tolerate you acting up, if that is the case.  On the other hand, if he does have a history of being a cheater and a liar, then what can I say, you know him better than anybody else that can answer this one for you on yahoo!  Again, I don't want to offend you or disrespect you in any way, but if I did.  I offer you my most sincere apologies!  I just hope that it is nothing serious and I hope that you can find a solution to your problem!  Best of luck!  Enjoy parenthood, it goes so quick!|`|nC6qEW1Paa	I'm assuming there's more to this than just this one time. At least talk to him and tell him what's going on with you and if he doesn't want to fix it then it's time to walk. There is the chance that nothing is going on and you're reading too much into it, at least consider that possibility. Too many times do people want to jump the gun and make choices based on assumptions. His friend could have very easily turned his phone back on, who knows. If you don't want to talk to him about anything, then leave because you're both better off without each other.<br>  <br>  On the off chance this is the only thing he's done to make you think he's cheating, seek help.
SsfnitjXaa	I don't jump in bed willy nilly.  But if the guy I wanted to marry wanted to wait until the honeymoon to jump my bones I would think something was very wrong with him.<br>  <br>  Most of all you want your partner to be honest with you.  To many girls out there are just wanting a baby and will use you then go away with he kid, leaving you with a support payment every month for 18 years.<br>  <br>  Never marry a gal with kids unless her husband is dead.
qUDas0R4aa	ask him out what have you got to lose|`|SsfnitjXaa	Let the man be a man and ask you out first.  Since he is not shy that should not be a problem.|`|lb6jBcDiaa	ask him out :D<br>  dont you want some excitment? get your adrenaline pumping?<br>  take a challenge, something you would normally do<br>  OR<br>  make it a casual outing<br>  "hey me and a couple of friends are going to _______. want to come?"
unVj43Xxaa	More than likely you miss the idea of a relationship than him. Especially, since your gut was telling you something about being with him at the time whether it was him or just you not being ready. I would also consider his ignoring you to make it easier to get over you or he may just be immature and playing a game with you. Either way it's normal to miss someone and it's normal to think you want to go back because you come accustom to how things where. Now you have to get accustom to how things are and talk to him about why he's ignoring you and if you can just be friends for now minus the ignoring part.|`|VSw6eN4Baa	Have breakup sex.|`|lYjweuZmaa	you hurt his feelings and made him feel unwelcome in your Presence. you pushed him away and made him think you were through. he tried to move on... seeing and talking to you everyday would not help him get over you.... so he found the easiest way he knew how. why don't you try talking to him...<br>  <br>  but wait if you aren't ready you just need to leave him alone until you are. <br>  <br>  if you are ready now FOR SURE then you need to take the step and start talking to him again and let him know you are now there for the taking. <br>  <br>  good luck|`|x0J8S5sWaa	You shouldn't have told him you missed him, only to tell him you weren't ready for a relationship. Honestly, the best thing you can do is move on. Sorry to break it to you, but you did lead him on a fair bit so it's no wonder if he's ignoring you. Just be nice and normal next time you see him but try to forget about him. It wouldln't be fair of you to ask for him to get back together with you because you already broke up with him once...however if you do and he says yes, make sure that you really think hard about letting him go again.<br>  <br>  Goodluck :)|`|Q8YHZ5g8aa	Um not play with his feelings? You told him that you missed him and still liked him, then told him you didn't want a relationship. Figure out what you want, and don't mess with his head by voicing your confusion.|`|KtdlJbrOaa	Move on with your life.  You are still young and there are plenty of other fish in the sea.|`|509248920483afa8396e2237322a94beaa	think carefully before doing it.  either you want him back, or you don't.  make up your mind.  it is not a game, people have feelings.  he will ignore you as long as you are not his girlfriend.  he doesn't have any obligation to talk to you, especially you told him that you missed him but didn't want a relationship.  if you want him to be around you, there is only one way to do that, and you know what it is.|`|ns7p5hBGaa	if he is just stopped talking to you after you said that your not ready for a relationship yet, then either he's tired of waiting and is giving up, or hes hurt. I've been through exactly what hes going through, and i had two choices, i could either forget her and go for someone else, or try to stick with her hopefully wait for things to start looking up.|`|uzZuwtgXaa	A bit of a silly thing to say to him when you still like him, now he's had the brush off twice. No wonder he has had enough, you have to be truthfull take the bull by the horns and tell him you would really like to make another go at it. If you feel to stupid to do this then write him  a short letter explaining yourself.|`|wi6mkT30aa	The reason he isn't talking with you is because he likes you a lot and because you two aren't dating, and you probably hurt him...he doesn't want to be JUST FRIENDS because then its harder to get over you.<br>  <br>  If yu want a serious relationship with this boy then do it, if not don't mess with his feelings.|`|0DQStfUMaa	dude i went through that exact same thing. it's tough cuz you acted like you don't care, and that you are strong, maybe you are, but now he thinks you really aren't that into him. so he is going to move on if he isn't that into you also. but don't spend the next 5 months on him. ;)|`|9HyKCmpnaa	Get on with your life or do whatever it takes to get him back
3AXHItOqaa	Try having a heart-to-heart. Tell him how you seriously feel, and see if that helps. You shouldn't be guilt tripped into doing anything you don't want to, especially by your father. Besides, you're looking out for your child.  But I would recommend you doing something now, instead of blowing up over his controlling actions years from now. I can tell you from personal experience that it only gets worse. Plus it can definitely cause problems with your relationship; your husband may get tired of him constantly interfering in your lives. Just remember, you're an adult. You don't have to do anything you don't want to. Good luck, hope it all works out :)|`|U1CLX0p5aa	Babies definitely need to be in a home enviorment it makes the feel safe|`|2EobcGqqaa	Sorry to hear you are in that situation.  I am in the same situation.  My parents are extremely controlling!   I believe your dad and my parents have good intentions. However, they just haven't realized that this is our life and we are not going to be happy with someone else running it.  I believe you have to be honest and tell your dad how you feel. Tell him exactly what you said here. At first he will probably overeact and pout like you said but eventually when you don't give into him he'll realize he was wrong to act like a child. . I just hope we remember this when our kids get old enough to make their own decisions.   I wish you good luck in your quest for freedom|`|HyulW3aiaa	I had very interferring in laws. With hindsight,I wish I had told them to butt out years ago.Now they are dead and I live with the consequences of their actions and my desire to do the right thing and keep the peace.My advice to you is simple: follow your heart. If your Dad sulks then so be it.You tell him that you love him but that he must allow you to make your own decisions.You must do what you want to do, to please yourself,your husband and child.He is bullying you emotionally which you might have to tell him.No need for insults or harsh words-just a firm No thank you.I am staying home.If he sulks then so what.Stand up to him and tell him he is trying to have unrighteous dominion over your life.This will not be wrong on your part-you have a new daddy in your life called husband.Hell,my sister puts her in laws on rations if they do not comply. Your Father should want to see your child whenever possible and if his sulking keeps him away then he is a sorry excuse of a Grandfather.Just say no and change the subject.We are not coming and that is that. Hows moms back/piles/fibroids???|`|8ilHQMq5aa	just tell him straight up no. dont give excuses. tell him if he wants to see the baby he can visit but you arent driving 2 hours with a fussy teething baby. he can respond all he wants but you dont have to go. youre a grown woman with a husband. daddy isnt the boss anymore.
IrjEKZ2Haa	She is still very much in love with you!! and obviously you are still in to her!!! you should definitely sit down together and talk about it!!! She wouldn't be sending you those signals if she didn't mean it!!! I totally think you should go for it!!!! Don't be afraid of her response because I am sure it will be a great response and i bet she will feel the same way about you!!!! Good Luck!!!!|`|EkLJDcc7aa	i think shes interested.<br>  or shes a real b*tch.sorry.
rR9fqQOTaa	Well of course each situation differs. I was about 6 or 7 (I'm 17 now) when my parents got divorced so when my mom started dating it wasn't as weird for me. (It was still weird to think about but I got used to it, my mom was careful about asking with what I was comfortable with etc.)<br>  <br>  My brother had a more difficult time getting used to things. He is 5 years older than I am and when my mom told him she was getting engaged he had only met the guys a couple of times (he lives out of the house) and acting weird. After getting to know the guy better though he seems ok and happy about it.<br>  <br>  So what I'm trying to say is that it is perfectly normal to feel weird about you parents dating and it is important to make sure that you and your parents communicate about how you feel about it. <br>  <br>  Don't worry, things will get easier and less weird eventually :-D|`|BWM7NIA0aa	Well it is a fact of life that your mom will be interested in dating sometime.  Tell your Mom how you feel about her prospects of dating again.  It is a hard transition for both of you. You are torn between your mom and dad and that will take time to put in perspective.  How do you think they feel when you start dating and they may be uncomfortable. Just be open and honest.|`|dqMf8IeCaa	Hey kid 29f here. Of course your going to feel uncofortable, your only human. I mean just let your mom know that you feel this way, ask her for your sake not to do this in front of you. No one will ever take the place of your dad. And make it a point to tell her that. Sh*t if I were you, I would say somthing to the dousche bag like, hey this is all new to me I would appreciate it if you didn't do that in front of me. Good Luck . When you get older you will understand things more clearly. It;s life and good luck.|`|k4ViwHTwaa	life is hard stay true to your mom and dad know who tey are and love them both talk to your mom if your a teen your mom dont have long to go till your old enough where this wont matter|`|ZzEAc5ecaa	girl please just help her out .. she needs a little love to ..|`|sx0PpjvAaa	Your mom probably feels uncomfortable when guys hit on you too.

yOHCXiaMaa	Well..I think you answered yourself.  First, why would you consider marrying a man you think is an asshole.  And why is she a hoochie?<br>  Did you not ask for room and space.  So many times we ask for something and do not take in the consequences of our own actions.<br>  <br>  Look three monthes is not a long time out of your life.  Its not like spending 5 or 10 years to find that he's moved on.  Forget revenge and go on living.  Seeing you like this is just empowering him and giving him a swollen brain.<br>  <br>  If he calls again just be nice and polite but tell him that you have moved on beyond little boys with little toy's.  And as far as her looks whats ugly to some can be beautiful to another.  Don't blame her.  You never know what line he fed her.|`|u31B8Ycjaa	girl dont waste your time on some foo<br>  that doesnt know what a good thing he had.<br>  move on sweetheart dont mope around n wish<br>  he was still there. once a cheater always a cheater.<br>  find a guy who knows what he has when hes with you.<br>  good luck!|`|15e58edf21f33dd475298413b3cd6d8caa	if u liked what he did to you,you will answer his calls or even talk to him as 4 getting even forget it he isn't worth it! id say move change ur cel # so if he calls its not ur #|`|nv7Cofm5aa	Stop blaming the outcome over your bf. It's not going to help you much to move on and do something for yourself. You want to heal... then get on with it. Accept the fact that you both made a choice to 'take a break' from each other. <br>  <br>  It was your choice... and his choice... and now you're mad? He decided to move on. Blaming him will definitely cause you to feel worst about yourself because you're finding an outlet to let all of your frustration and anger out. <br>  <br>  So you find a better way to blame you ex bf for everything. But why? Stop the hate and learn to accept things as they are. <br>  <br>  Trust me, when you're an adult... you'll be going through this a lot.|`|IaaDgCgWaa	Be careful what you ask for...you just might get it.

It doesn't have to be expensive, just something that will make him happy and know you care about him.
JCAgvgTxaa	Unfortunately, the deceased cannot issue invitations.  I agree with your fiance.  It would be inappropriate to include his late father on the invitations.    To honor dad, make a mention of him in the program provided to guests at the ceremony:  "The yellow roses on the altar are in memory of the groom's beloved father, Mr. John Doe." Just an example.    You don't want to make too much mention of dad, as others will also be missing him on your wedding day. You don't want mother or grandmother or aunt or groom to be overcome with grief . . . at a time when they are already missing father's presence.    And father would be included in any newspaper announcements of your engagement or marriage.  As in, "The groom is the son of Mr. and Mrs. Timothy Smith, and the late Mr. John Doe."|`|cGbTJobeaa	Let your fiance's wishes dictate the decision on this one.  Honestly, let him set the tone of how his father will be remembered at his wedding.  Trust me, his father will not be absent in the thoughts of your fiance's family and friends.    My dad died before my wedding as well.  I miss him every day and frequently just talking about makes me miss him all that much more.  I miss my dad enough, I don't need nor want to have visible reminders about his death.  I certainly did not feel like making constant announcements "hey, my dad is dead. Feel sorry for the bride with the dead dad. Bride walking down the aisle alone because she has a dead dad."      I preferred to be very low key instead of being all maudelin about it and drawing attention to it.  Everyone knew about my dad's death anyway.  There were a couple of very quiet touches like when my dad's favorite hymn was played (no announcement about its significance).  My family took my bouquet and placed it on his grave while I was on my honeymoon.|`|29I8PWrxaa	I agree with Jaded ... include something about his father in the toasts.  Plus, since it is his father and not yours, the decision should really be left up to him.|`|LVNbP6VWaa	Its obvious he isn't comfortable with it: you can't let your feelings be hurt because it was his dad not yours.      Ask him and his parents what he would like to put.  Are you doing this to honour dad or because you think you should?  Don't pressure them into something they don't want to do: it is ultimately their choice. x|`|kN4EaiUDaa	You need to let your fiance make the choice if he wants his deceased father on the invitations. you have no room to get pissed off or get your feelings hurt. let him know your recommendation and if he doesnt want that then leave it alone and keep his father's name off. Have you ever thought that may be more painful for him to have to recoginize his father the day of his wedding. You need to give him alot of support and love him because the biggest day of your fiances life and his father wont be there to see it. give him a break and love him.|`|IGqMSCLjaa	Maybe you could word the invitations differently. Here is an example   Fiance's name the son of Mom and step dad and late   and   your name the daughter of mom and dad  invite you to their wedding    I have seen this done on my uncle's wedding invitations because my grandfather is dead. This might work for you. Maybe give your fiancee some time and talk to him about it again.|`|76f80c73e4bfcb1026dd5ae2d1da3f18aa	the reason the parent's names go on the invites is because they are hosting the wedding (which means paying for it).  blunt as this may sound, the deceased cannot technically pay for your wedding.  if you want to remember your late FIL at the wedding, light a candle for him during your ceremony or instead of favors, put a card on each table stating a donation in his name was made to a charity or something.|`|jZ03Zdjdaa	Only live people get to do the inviting on invitations.  If he wants his dad's name on there it should be as "Jason, son of the late George Johnson"    FWIW, both my husband's parents passed away years before I met him.  We did not mention them on the invitations.|`|HQsmRzPsaa	in your wedding program, if having one (or the back of your invitations) add a section titled "remember...." and just add a note about family members no longer with you and wanting to remember them on this day, list his dad's name, grandparents that you were close to etc.|`|0AShsMsoaa	please read the other question about invites, never put a dead persons name on an invite, they cant invite anyone to anything.  do refer to them in one of your toasts and in newspaper announcements.|`|f6ab3ae3fee781c3975ea305670f972faa	he's probably still hurt.  drop the "late" part and just list his dad separately from his mom and stepdad.    and uh, yeah, my cousin listed her late father on her invitation along with her mom and stepdad because her father's insurance policy paid for the wedding.|`|OIJ3JBkSaa	son of joann and [the late] arthur lewis  lets every guest know his dad has passed  if you drop the phrase [the late] your guests be going up to the step-dad and calling him arthur which will be embarassing for them and upsetting for him.|`|1sRqj5fhaa	he is acting like this cuzz he is hurt and probably doesn't like to accept the fact that his father passed away...|`|zdpp7cubaa	He probably isn't comfortable with putting late because he doesn't like thinking about the fact his father is gone.|`|agTCqkLDaa	Men tend not to think the way we do.  I think if you have something physical (like unity candles) symbolizing his father that might work better.  Chances are, if people are coming to his wedding they know his father passed away.    You could always word the invitations as such:    Mr. and Mrs. John Smith invite you to the wedding of Mrs. SMith's son and Mr. Smith's stepson   blah blah blah    and then in pretty writing at the bottom of the invitation write: "The so and so candles are in memory of the groom's father who is here with us in spirit" or something like this.|`|7jNYqtWOaa	You have to allow your fiance to grieve.   He's not over the loss of his father yet, and that may take a long time.      (It's been five years since I lost my own dad and I still miss him.  When I got re-married four years ago I had a framed photograph of him on the reception table where he woud have sat had he been alive.  EVERYONE at attendance respected that.)    What I would suggest is perhaps putting the father's name in a framed  box on the weddiing invite, with "In Memoriam" on the front.  That is always such a wonderful thing to see.     I agree that "late" is nothing more than a euphemism.  Late?  Late for what?  The wedding?!
Z9itluhvaa	I think it's a lovely idea - it's a really beautiful, evocative song and you'll have the delight of remembering the aisle walk every time you hear it afterwards!      If you're having it in a church, check with the priest/vicar that it's ok for it to be non-religious - I'm having an instrumental version of my favourite hymn because I don't like Here Comes The Bride or any other 'recommended' piece of music, think it makes a big difference that we have something we actually love while we're doing the most important walk of our lives ;)|`|ECe1rgsdaa	That's the song I am using too! If your crazy, then I am too! I love that song!|`|7CKipTZOaa	No I think it adds a nice personal touch to your day and will make it memorable|`|sGP6s7uraa	It's your day and your favorite song.  Do it!  My cousin walked down to "All My Life" so I see no reason for you not to walk down the aisle to "Moon River" :)|`|di6p10Ifaa	i love the idea. I think it would be a hit, especially considering it is your favorite song|`|LVNbP6VWaa	The melody is beautiful: didn't know the words 'til I looked them up.  The song is beautiful and very romantic: it would be really heart warming if you then had it as your first dance song!    Moon River, wider than a mile,   I'm crossing you in style some day.   Oh, dream maker, you heart breaker,   wherever you're going I'm going your way.   Two drifters off to see the world.   There's such a lot of world to see.   We're after the same rainbow's end--   waiting 'round the bend,   my huckleberry friend,   Moon River and me.    A lovely sentiment for a newly wed couple! x|`|tWD175Pjaa	its your wedding do what makes you happy. Id say go for it if that the song you like then walk dance jump your way down the isle just be happy doing it.

AA11841749	To me, dating is a very casual thing.  You can date more than one person at a time.  I personally don't like dating.  I am more of a "relationship" type person.  So if I guy says he doesn't know what we are...I tell him to DTR...define the relationship.  I don't like the whole "not knowing what we are" thing.|`|FSMpMA9saa	its not about the kissing or touching or anything..<br>  Dating is just knowing you have someone there, besides your friends who you know cares about you and someone you share same interest in or can debate with but not fight.. someone that can make you cry not of pain but of happiness.. someone that lets you know, you reallly do mean something, and confides in you.. someone you can trust|`|rbtO73eZaa	go to places we both like and just have a good time i guess|`|lYjweuZmaa	DATING DEFEATS GF/BF UNLESS YOU IMPLY THAT YOURE BF/GF<br>  <br>  YOU COULD GO ON DATES WITH 2 GUYS N THE SAME NIGHT AND IT WOULDNT B CONSIDERED CHEATING BC YOU ARE DATING.|`|aUDVBmZSaa	Hanging out with an intent.
k73IxCHaaa	I think there maybe two separate issues here. One the age difference and two the financial well being and stability of your mom. Lets take the latter first. I have learned that life is about one thing and one thing only its about the choices we make. When your Mom decided to be with this guy she had her reasons and motivations which only she knows. It may be a bad choice or a good one, only time will tell. However it is a choice she chose to make. I'm sure that during your lifetime you have made some choices in which you wish you could do over again. It appears that this guy may be using her or maybe he's just down on his luck in regards to his employment situation. At any rate if you are concerned about the welfare of your Mom and your sister, you should politely and respectfully let her know.    As far as the age thing, when I was a young man I dated older women who were 10 -15 years my senior. I've always been attracted to them and learned a lot from them. Age is simply a number and has nothing to do with male-female attraction. It may make you feel odd and weird, but the question you have to ask yourself is, would you feel the same way if the guy was 20 years older than your Mom and didn't have a job.    I never knew my Mom, but I do know that she have five kids with four different men (only one of which she was married to). When I was younger I thought pretty harsely of her, but as I grew older I began to realize that she may or may not have had different circumstances to deal with, which I am totally unaware of. Though I was abandoned at birth, I grew up healthy, intelligent and strong. Whatever else she was, she had great genes.     So I'll just leave you with this, be careful of placing people in judgement unless you know all of the circumstances, situations and things that they have had to deal with. You never know you could end up with a younger man one day.    I hope this helps.|`|rYhm4LN1aa	i dont understand it, i think its weird    i couldnt go with a younger man    i think maybe your mother is having trouble facing the fact that shes getting older|`|CIzrjrykaa	your mom is a cugar..|`|uGFzzLYWaa	I'm going to answer this question. I just turned 40 last year.  I like men, and their age doesn't have much to do with it, it doesn't matter to me. I don't consider myself a cougar, but I will not limit the age of the men I date, as long as they're over 20. I've dated guys who were 25, and guys who were 50. If you really like someone's company, age really isn't an issue.    As far as how they are choosing to live their lives, jobless and mooching off of others, I can't say I think that's cool, but I don't think his age has anything to do with being a jobless parasite.|`|0s93q8Ocaa	No, it's not realistic.  However, it's her business.  She will eventually get tired of him and move on.    Interestingly, I think she's looking for someone to take care and nurture...with sexual benefits.|`|CCINeyjZaa	how old is your mom? I think if she is over 35-40 that she is going through a mid life crisis maybe that guy makes her feel young and gets in her head and she just like dating younger guy (if she is around that age) because it makes her feel like she still got it! and she doesn't feel old if  that's the reason reality will kick in soon!|`|vgXGNAuCaa	that was there choice|`|W8R0FrROaa	I think that really you should mind your own business on this one as you are going to be the one in the firing line if it goes wrong, just be there for her and don't judge, she will do that aplenty when and if the time comes|`|YkseyT7zaa	It's not your problem its hers

8McA6xqPaa	Your being very mature and adult by doing this,<br>  <br>  write something like...<br>  <br>  I just wanted to write and send you a picture of my latest ultrasound.I wanted to say that I'm sorry for what happened and I know we've had problems between us, but I think for our baby's sake we need to be civil and begin communicating again. Although there isn't a future for us, I want and need you to be a part of our baby's life. I hope you understand and agree with this...<br>  <br>  <br>  I hope somehow this helps, just write it straight and from the heart, trying to avoid anything he could take wrongly. Just make it neutral.<br>  <br>  Good luck! <br>  CA|`|sy9QKNZaaa	Hi, I just had an ultrasound done and I thought that you might want to see it. I'm sorry, for everything that happened. I want you to want to be a part of our child's life even though I don't want to be with you anymore. I think its would be best for our baby if you were a part of his/her life. Let me know what you decide.<br>  <br>  Its short but sweet :)  hope this helps
wovoZ5Z0aa	You probably are a nice guy.  You may also be supplicating.  Women HATE guys they can walk on or who express interest before the woman has earned it.  <br>  <br>  Go into any interaction with women with the attitude that you are the one picking a woman who is worth your time and attention, and don't let her get away with any shenanigans.  Women often test men to see if they're strong enough to stand up to them.
SlR0Cp5saa	haha you sorta stole my question ;)<br>  <br>  number 1 only because that's exactly how my best friend is.|`|fBdtvrWdaa	Numero Uno<br>  I like a dependable guy that I know will always be there to make me laugh.

For some reason I like the wild bad boys...<br>  But, for marriage I would choose number 1.
mAorBf7saa	Hec yes!  Tell them you really like this guy, and want them to meet him - that will give them a reason to trust you together, and help them approve.  I think it would be a really bad idea not to tell them if you're dating him - if they find out some other way, without you telling them, they would look down on your relationship.|`|AwXDBoASaa	yea just tell them. i am not really supposed to date but i do anyway and when i tell my parents i always feel a lot better then sneeking around.|`|zAd8q8KQaa	Yeah, it's always nice to tell your parents about what you're doing with your life.  It will make them more comfortable to know you're not hiding it!|`|IxD8aNHTaa	if you wanna have him over your house and stuff tell them, if not just wait till they find out.|`|6FzQEempaa	girl im going through the same thing!!<br>  but just tell them! i know its hard but c'mon lets just get it over with and tell them lol
1pL6sg0vaa	if i were you i would let him go and find someone else. if he really loved you he wouldn't have done that to you. i mean if your ok with him doing that then you can still like him or whatever. if you aren't ok then i would let im go and find some one else. so.. ya do what you think is the best for you!|`|PyRxe9B2aa	WELL Did he tell you that you are the only one he loves??? GUESS WHAT He loves and wants you, your friend, and every other girl in town who looks good. He is called a player. The only one he really loves is himself. He wants everybody to love him and have sex with him and the more the merrier. Unless you are self destructive dump this guy. Better luck in the future.
Mq9z3qYEaa	I know you probably don't want to hear this cause its soo cliche, but just be yourself, if you seriously have to try hard to get a guy to notice you then its not worth it.<br>  <br>  So ya just be yourself, approach him if he doesn't approach you.|`|eae407c249076a56758cc99d008a9d3baa	Wear provacative clothes.<br>  <br>  Check him out (if hes that type of guy)<br>  <br>  Look sexy<br>  <br>  you know...anything really. just depends on the guy.|`|lYjweuZmaa	walk through the halls naked|`|hBr3nfaIaa	Really be yourself with him and make the effort to talk[:<br>  I know it's not great advice but that's really it.<br>  <br>  Make yourself up with like makeup/clothes, not for him but for you.

Look at your wardrobe, do you have appropriate clothing for every occasion?  Stand up straight, smile and act like you have a few secrets.|`|8MnLsQ32aa	Be smart, funny, sarcastic, be able to take and dish out a joke. Don't be close minded. Dress nice. SMELL GOOD.

WL6FP0F3aa	Women are only complicated because men make it that way. A women is sensitive, for the most part, so saying something stupid, harsh, or boyish is just out of the question, with most. Some like it. But women for the most part are willing to put themselves on the back burner to listen to what you have to say. Remember this...be real, be true, be sincere.<br>  <br>  As long as you treat them with respect, make them feel special, and as long as she knows without doubt or question that you are being real, there is nothing you cannot talk about with a woman.<br>  <br>  Ex: If you think a woman is sexy, you have to tell her, you are sexy, and remember sexy is a combination of decent looks and an awsome personality, not someone you wanna just bang. Get it.<br>  <br>  sexy is how every woman wants to feel, and at any given time any woman can be sexy, big, small, not so pretty, pretty, don't matter.<br>  <br>  You can make her feel special, by not telling her you have to call her back after you talk to your boys? Hint, a woman will put up with your sh*t potentially the rest of your life, your boys will come and go.<br>  <br>  Women are simple to figure out, for men who are willing to be real, and by being real, I mean, telling her how you feel in front of your friends, not being all sweet and sincere to her when your alone, and acting like a jerk when your boys are around.<br>  <br>  I could go on and on with this stuff man. Just be yourself, ask her questions about herself, and let her talk, women love a guy that listens, but make sure you listen man, remember, and store the information to wow her later. If she tells you she likes a certain flower, or stuffed animal, make sure on her next birthday, that is what you get her, and do not be wrong.<br>  <br>  So Listen, Be Real, Be True, Be Sincere, and if you get there, don't friggin cheat.|`|WeRVjgpMaa	MOST women, don't care what you talk about, as long as it has to do with them, or something they've done.

Also, make sure to always pay attention to what he says instead of thinking about the next thing you should be talking about, this way you can follow up on things he mentioned and have a longer and more interesting conversation.

zcE2pS56aa	i think you fill the place in her life as a 'trustworthy guy' she hasn't got her dad so she relies on you to offer support and comfort her. i don't see my dad and i have several close guy friends that i trust totally. it's a good thing. you don't want to confuse the issue even more though so i don't think you should like her, as she is moving away it will be hard enough for her, without knowing she is breaking your heart, i feel for you, as you seem to like her a lot but maybe it just wasn't meant to be. there are plenty of other girls out there, it's just finding the right one. i think she sees you as a big brother and that you are the person she can trust, because you have always been there. i would love a guy to be like you for me! good luck. i hope everything sorts out for you xx|`|5KAreKDjaa	Complicated eh? Well you should let her know that you really care about her, don't go in too heavy as you don't want to scare her off but if you let her know that you like her it might make her feel better.

UuAV4wVNaa	Its always better to be a friend then nothing at all// it gives you options..<br>  <br>  Like if him and his girlfriend break up it gives you a chance to go out.<br>  <br>  FASHO// :]<br>  <br>  so dont worrie... BUT remember.. keep your eyes open to other boys. You dont want to be stuck on just this one guy //<3|`|VXiMtwIsaa	He has a GF. But being friends is fine...if ya still wont him? Cause if they break-up your there!|`|CfviSBh3aa	If i were you, I would tell him how you feel about him. Or you could always tell him something similar by use of a light-hearted cover-up joke on msn, txt etc.<br>  <br>  If he knows that an amazing girl like you likes him like that, he will be forced to consider his standings with the girl he is currently dating. He needs all the options before he can make a choice. Hopefully, the choice is in your favour :)<br>  <br>  He will also appreciate the fact that you actually like him romantically. Guys usually have to "do all the work" to get girls to feel the same away about them. It will be a nice surprise to him.<br>  <br>  If you back up letting him know with some flirting and nice conversation which compliments him, then you have a good chance. Girls just don't compliment guys enough or at all sadly.|`|2keIEMFUaa	You need to be strong and tell yourself that he's not yours he is with someone else and you need to look else where.  Sorry! I know that's not what you want to hear but carma will strike you if you don't move-on.|`|0GdFoDfraa	dude if he has a girlfriend stay far far away cause if he leaves her for you that does not make him romantic it makes him a jerk!|`|FSMpMA9saa	you just gotta move on, dont get involved if he has a gf.. but play the friend role, get to know him cause maybe if something happens with them, you'll be his crying shoulder|`|5ua3E8lLaa	play with him... do the same eye contact but let urself down... be flirty, u dont know what could happen. my did what im telling you even knowing he had 1 but the been living together fo 4 years... just because she was around...|`|364815ba0e4e52ba14aa1cef4ad4e5a0aa	I'm going to assume that sum1: means someone. I think the best thing you can do is...get over it. You'll find somebody else.|`|maNrDAIAaa	Wait until he is single. Dont get too involved with him while he has a girlfriend, but give him and yourself some time.<br>  <br>  You might discover tht you dont rele like him, its just an attraction.|`|ju5hVva8aa	dnt get in between their relationship.<br>  b his friend, and give off the vibe tht ur the type of friend he can go 2 for his problems... =].|`|YTHmYqllaa	GO FIND YOUR OWN MAN, go find a single guy who chooses you first.
cydakP87aa	honestly you are reading way too much into this and way too early<br>  yes it is normal and i think it is a good thing that he is not glued to his cell phone<br>  yeah it sucks waiting ages for a reply but its probably just how it is<br>  if anything is to happen with this guy you will probably piss him off if you are bugging him because he doesnt respond immediately after recieving a text message<br>  try not to worry about it too much and just relax. :)|`|RIjL3cJqaa	my guy has been talking to me that same way for the last year and a half. don't worry much about it =)|`|4U76UK81aa	Guys don't really check their phone every five minutes like girls.  Esspecially if he is at work....you can't expect him to be at your becking call.<br>  <br>  I would suggest calling him, maybe he will respond faster...or even pick up the phone and talk to you =)<br>  <br>  Good luck hun!<br>  <br>  xoxo
QP28lnQEaa	I know what your saying. My father and I have been at odds for years, I am 21 and things still don't look like they will get any better. I never wanted to come home because he was there, I always tried to avoid him because all we would do is argue. He's your father and he does love you, but some people just are very bad at showing it. There's nothing more than having a good relationship with your parents, but sometimes they make it very difficult. Maybe when you move out in a few years things will get better...I can't say talking to him will help because its only a temporary solution to an ongoing problem. Just keep your individuality and find something that you love and maybe that will bring you closer to him.|`|TcDO2Dkyaa	Im not joking this is the exact same as me and my dad i swear its the same...!!<br>  <br>  Im 15 too , and everything u say is the same.......even if he's not in one of his moods i still have no feelings towards him only hatred . . !!<br>  <br>  I know what your going thru , i dnt really know what advice to giv cuz im still trying to decide what to do , things got so bad i just wanted to just give up completly . .!!<br>  Im soo sorry . . . <br>  <br>  If you need to talk tho , add me . .!!<br>  =)|`|3AJtk8Fyaa	You didn't mention your mom. Is there a mom or a female that you can talk to? I'm sorry to Say but things that you need to find out what the expectations are  from your father. You must remember that you are a child. S many things are going on in the world until parents are going crazy trying to keep their kids safe. You never mentioned wh mistakes you have made to make him not trust you. I think that you need to follow his rules and things will get better for you until you become independent.|`|ZOKS33uzaa	I really think you might need to talk to him and try to compromise with the way he treats you and your rules. If he won't budge try talking to your mom,step mom,aunt etc. Go to your counselor at scxhool and talk to him/her about it. If all else fails try seeing if youcan move in with another close realitive.<br>  I'm very sorry this is the way your life is going and if you know and or believe in god pray to him about it EVERY  night until something begins to change then keep praying that it will keep goig smoothly. (if anything changes)|`|dIlP17Gnaa	first off im 13 <br>  i had a problem a long time ago with my dad<br>  we got in buches of fights <br>  and i never went to visit <br>  till one day i was think about it <br>  && so i jsut called him up and we talk about <br>  it for like an hour or 2 and ever since we have been best<br>  friends all you need to do is talk about it with him <br>  tell him "dad i feel like your not giving me love. we have grown apart to much and i want to love you. you have so many unneccary rules i just wonder why and mabey we can work something out and slove it cause i feel like you dont love me anymore & i can tell you i really dont think we have as good as a relationship as i wish we could"<br>  if that doesnt work im sorry if you ever need to talk the email me<br>  cause i have a  mean mom so i no wat your going through|`|sxxPbj0baa	I feel your situation, I really do. But you can only do one thing, and that's talk to him. Write him a letter, telling him the way you feel. Write in a way that doesn't tear him apart, but just tells him what you think of their relationship. Be aware of blaming it all on him because once you let it out, everything will come out. Even if you don't give it to him, let it out. It helps a lot. Give it to him if you please, and if nothing changes, don't let him hold you back sweetheart. I can't speak for him but just because he doesn't show it, doesn't mean he doesn't love you. His reaction may surprise you.|`|XyOsRQvgaa	i'm 15 too and i know exactly how you feel. my dad has had 5 boys of his own, and i'm his first and only girl so he had no idea what he was doing. every time he has a bad day at work, or the shop he owns has few customers, he takes it out on me. our fights have become physical many times on both sides.<br>  when i tell my mom the exact same thing happens as well. he just gets mad at me that i 'told on him' and they become worse.<br>  but my brother and i are very close, so i talk to him. maybe if you're close to your brother you could talk to him. or a friend, if you have a best friend who you trust. it's best to get these things off your chest, i known from past experience things get so much better when you talk about them. if he's in a bad mood try to out of his way and avoid him. but you only get one dad, so try as hard as you can to patch up your relationship. be as nice to him as you can, that's what i do. when he's gone you'll regret never making an effort to mending your relationship.<br>  i hope this helps, i know it's hard but someday it'll get better ?|`|ZleVRevVaa	Ok, as i can guess what the problem is. Actually ur dad is a from a jatt family and basically in jatt families, father commands the whole family and others follow it. Its in their blood, they can't change it. If u want to make a good relation with ur dad, just go and sit with him and tell him politely that u love him a lot and u will try to not give any tension to him. And also frankly and politely tell him that you are grown up in a much advanced country like Canada, ur friend circle is like that so ur nature has developed like that. Tell him that if u lived in India, ur nature and ur friend circle have been different and then the situation would be different entirely. So ask him to adjust little bit and i guess he will understand.|`|ZteoS74raa	You should still go to therapy even if it's just for you cuz it will still help you.  I grew up in home just like you.  It was till my father got cancer in my late 30's that I finally knew he loved me.  So you're going to have to be patient. Sometimes father-daughter relationships are really hard.|`|UThG15FLaa	Wow,<br>  Maybe he shows your brother more love, because he's just that certain kind of "dad". There are certain Fathers out there, that show the boy's more respect then there daughters.<br>  <br>  Or it could be, because, he's a father. He knows what guys want from girls? because he is no doubt a guy right? .. Maybe he's just looking out for you, in Fatherly way? ...<br>  <br>  I can't honestly say why he doesn't say "i love you" Tuff love?<br>  <br>  ? Deee|`|mBTKYRPPaa	im 16.. i was 15 the first time i honestly stopped loving my dad. <br>  making your relationship with him better is not something that is reasonable until and IF he changes.. thats what me and my dad have come down to. I can't have a relationship with him and its taken a while to accept that, I still haven't completely but hey I have to look out for myself.  Everytime I have tried to have any kind of relationship with my dad, my life has been put on the line and I'm not willing to risk my life for someone who doesn't care. Email me if you want to talk or want to know more, I know I'm a stranger but sometimes talking to someone who is in a similar situation can be extremely helpful even if they don't handle things the way you do or would.  xfallengirlx@livedotcom|`|upIrlDm5aa	I have the same problem, My dad is a control freak, and he loves my older brother more. I never had a real relationship with him. I also had my share of problems because I did what I wanted and left. Nowadays I do not talk to my dad anymore or see him. I only live 40 miles from him. Didn't see him for christmas or he didn't call or anything for my birthday. I got over it in time, but you know what they say, once some one does not have something they realize they miss it a lot more when they don't have it.
eO4y3m1maa	I think you should proceed with caution, I would think by the 3rd date he would know whether he wants to date you exclusively.....dont sleep with him unless you absolutely would be cool with it being just that.<br>  <br>  He may just need alittle more time to make sure he likes you..dont bring it up again until like the 6-7th date..unless you start hanging out more then twice a week then bring it up!|`|L9htPRRhaa	THIS MAYBE WIERD BUT I THINK YOU SHOULD TALK TO HIM FOR A CHANGE ASK HIM ABOUT THIS WHOLE SITUATION LOL I TRIED IT MAYBE YOU SHOULD TALK TO EACH OTHER FOR A CHANGE|`|awdV68dXaa	That question sounded a bit like you were thinking about having an open relationship so he might think you want to date other guys. That would explain why he acted really akward, you shouldn't bring that kind of stuff up it should just be assumed.|`|1XcTZRemaa	I'm sure he definately likes you a lot, and doesn't want to see other people. I'm very sorry, but that's kind of strange thing to ask. You two are a couple, and should remain together - just the two of you. Perhaps in the future, you can talk him, and just tell him how you feel about him. :] Then he'll probably return the favor, and by the way he says it, you'll know his feelings.<br>  <br>  Hope I helped!<br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AvyCUOU_9Bof_PB7N44B5.nsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090219163918AArmEst">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a> Help me out?|`|XsLj9jERaa	He probably didn't really give you an answer because he was worried that YOU didn't want to be in a real relationship...calling a healthy relationship in which two people stay only with eachother being, "stuck" could have given him the wrong impression.<br>  It sounds like he really likes you though :D

Dump the girlfriend wait a couple of weeks and then make the move on your friend.|`|1XcTZRemaa	I think that first, you need to sort out who you like more, and who you'd be happier with in the future. If you love your girlfriend, and you know that she'd be perfect for you for a long time, then you should stay with her and leave behind your feelings for your friend. However, would she annoy you, or bug you? In that case, you should consider ending the relationship. And as for your friend, would she be sweet, and wonderful if you were together?

If she continues to do it and she keeps acting inmature then maybe you could try to see how things go with your best friend,but don't tell her anything until you've made up your mind so that she doesn't get her hopes up and it turns out you're going to stay with your girlfriend.|`|EiW6ocewaa	I think that's up to you, but you could date both of them for one day to compare, or talk about this with your girlfriend as a dull and mature person would<br>  <br>  or if you think you're going down with your current girlfriend, give your friend the message that she's next and you're interested in her|`|3ISGQ4Csaa	Um, i think you should break up with your girlfriend.

Is it REALLY making you happy and keeping you satisfied? or is there something you need that she cant give you?<br>  <br>  Now, lets turn the page to your GF. Is she really satisfied with you or does she flirt with guys because she also lacks of something? <br>  <br>  My current GF also has deppressive tendencies and I′ve found them to be quite an obstacle to my feeling comfortable with her. It has taken us time and patience to really get over this thing. And I can tell you from self experience, its tiring to have to support someone emotionally at this level. It really drains you. But if you honestly feel its worth to be such a support, then you can go the long way with her. <br>  <br>  Now, let me tell you, I wouldnt stand her flirting with other guys one day and then crying on my shoulder the next day. It just wouldnt be right.<br>  <br>  How long have you been with your GF? Do you think she is long term material? <br>  <br>  Now, after you resolved that side of the situation, the other one is really up to you. Dont tell her you like her, just make jokes like "you know... If I werent commited, you would be a lucky girl" (with a really serious face... watch how she reacts... ) "anyway!, Im just kiddin' ! Youre a just a good friend to me". <br>  <br>  Comments like this should help you read her feelings towards you. <br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|CzTy38JKaa	If you love your gf as much as you say you do, then you shouldn't be asking advice on choosing between the two. try writing pros and cons for each and compare if you really are stuck. <br>  as for your gf. being a flirty girl myself, she may not realize that's she is flirting as much as she is. the best thing to do would be to sit down and talk to her and explain how you feel. tell her how it bugs you when she is flirting with other guys. a girl doesn't know a thing until she is told. BUT do not break up with her, wait until you have told her what is going on and let her try to do better. other wise it could really hurt her. if she really loves you she will stop her flirting with other guys. <br>  do not tell you friend you like her. if you feel you like her more then your gf, then tell her after you dump your gf, or it could back fire.<br>  <br>  please help me...<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=Aqvb98TqFgbhKZm3gfkePkPD7BR.;_ylv=3?qid=20090217164716AAoJ0Cr&show=1#yan-answers">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>

You need to stand up for yourself and see what you can to make things better. If that means you need to talk to her, then do it; there is no reason for you to be so paranoid about doing that. But, if you feel as though you won't get anywhere, then either get someone, like a mutual friend to talk to her, or just end the relationship.<br>  <br>  No one wants to be in a miserable relationship for no reason.|`|jgU4g6kGaa	If she doesn't like drama and fighting then why is she treating you so badly?

If she can't sit and listen to your concerns then maybe this isn't the girl for you.

You should stand up to her and tell her she needs to listen or you're not going to take it anymore, I bet she wouldn't expect that and if she really cared she stop what she was doing and listen to your thoguhts and feelings.<br>  <br>  Ignoring her is good but it's not going to fix anything.  You need to sit down and talk with her. Express your feelings and let her know shes hurting you when she acts this way. don't hide anything!

He might be scared of what crazy stories about him his friends will tell you, and because of that he might think you are going to look at him differently after wards. If you are interested in some one you should want to be part of their lives such as much as you want them to be part of yours.  He knows your friends, now you should have no problems meeting his, when you go out just ask him if he would like to invite some of his friends ( just like mom and dad did when you went on a road trip).<br>  <br>  Either all that or he might have some one else on the side, One GF that stays at home and one that hangs with his friends,  We (guys) tend to be more faithful and honest to the one that we bring closer to our friends and family, and we look at her for a long time relationship. <br>  <br>  Hang out with him while with his friends and you might see a total different side to him, whether good or bad, don't be to judgmental, some of his friends might be a little to immature for your taste and he might know this, and maybe he is not ready to decide between you and his former friends, what ever the case is .... don't pass out the opportunity and let him know that you want to be part of his life (that includes spending time with his friends and family)|`|eIzv9Lwwaa	you should have said yes. he knows your friends why not get to know his? he did offer so that was an invitation.
wdKY8YYRaa	that's God telling you you are a sinner and need to STOP having sex. FOREVER.       become a nun.     i hear they have great convents.|`|f6ab3ae3fee781c3975ea305670f972faa	if you've been raped or have escaped a rape attempt then you may need to talk to someone about it and work through your fear, anger, and sadness over it.    that means you stop trying to have sex while you deal with this issue and you tell your BF what is going on.  If he can't understand why or how rape messes with your head and makes you not want to have sex or makes you fear sex then he's not the kind of guy you want to hang around and spend time with.    contact your local women's shelter and ask them if they have or know of any support groups for victims of rape.  Often the support groups are free.  you can talk to other women who have been in your situation and see what helped them.    right now your body is closing down to protect you and your muscles have clamped shut and this is why penetration hurts you.  Until you deal with your issues, you aren't going to be able to relax enough to allow sex to happen.|`|g7SsBZLuaa	Try on your back and him on his side. If you ride him...kind of lay down on him or tell him to set up. If he is getting that frustrated with you...KICK HIM TO THE CURB!! This is coming from a married woman with 5 kids!!|`|X5qOfvtwaa	First of all, if you are not comfortable, you need to wait.  If your bf does not understand this, he's not worth it.  If you are ready, then there are few things you can do to make sex easier.  If you are using a condom (which I hope you are) then lube is definitely needed.  Condoms make friction so if you use lube, it will make it easier to enter you.  Just make sure you relax and take things slowly.  I know when I first started having sex, the first few times were painful.  My boyfriend entered me slowly, which makes your vagina stretch and it will fit to snugly fit the penis.  After he is completely in, then it wont hurt once he starts going.   If you do missionary style make sure your boyfriend enters you very slowly at first or it will still hurt.  If you do girl on top, then you can take it at your pace but it's harder (I think) because you're new at it and will be nervous.

Le53Bggxaa	Every girl is different.<br>  <br>  But something you should focus on is to take you time. Go very slowly and tease her lips so she'll be craving for more. Girls also love when you touch their cheeks, hips, stroke their hair.<br>  <br>  (: don't worry, things will go naturally.|`|VBtzeVlKaa	Every girl is different, but I personaly love to be held tight in his arms, have one of his hands hold my face up to his and start out with a slow, tender kiss, kissing and lightly sucking on the lower lip first and then the upper lip....then let both melt in my mouth. I have full lips so that is easy to accomplish. LOL...Then slowly allow more passion to build into the kiss. But basically just go with whatever comes natural to the two of you after that, go with the flow.

I swear, guys don't understand how much girls would LOVE to be kissed in a sunset... (of course i AM a girl myself)<br>  <br>  Now how you would kiss her? Well, i highly suggest that you start by staring into her eyes, and if she stares back, slowly start moving closer to her, and start wrapping your arms around her and hold her tight and firm, letting her know that you want her to be with you and YOU alone. Start leaning in, and then start to close your eyes.<br>  <br>  Note: She MIGHT hesitate. like kinda pull back or gasp or something, that's just because she probabaly didnt expect it. <br>  <br>  Moving on, if she does that, then kind of keep yourself there, hold still, and then move in again. Then, when you're close enough, put your lips to hers. DON'T slobber in her mouth, hardly use any tounge, MAYBE use a little. it should be really really sweet and long and wonderful ESPECIALLY if its a first kiss...<br>  <br>  follow these guidelines and you should be set!<br>  <br>  Hope i helped|`|e8AuHDlYaa	Be gentle with her. Don't make it seem like that's the reason your dating her, you know? Be gentle and don't suck her face off like some guys tend to do. Take it slow, but make the first move and let her lead you from there to get more intese or to slow down. <br>  By the way: Nobody is a BAD kisser or a GOOD kisser. Nobody judges that. When you meet the right girl for you all imperfections in both of you will be seen perfect. No worries and good luck.|`|KloYiKDpaa	You have to move slow...not 2 slow but slow and sweet. Take her into your arms look her in the eyes & brush her hair back and play with it a little then lean down and kiss her softly...Not 2 rough and not open mouth the first time either. I promise that will get her to melt in your arms & help ya out some :)|`|a6bb1dae7c5d4987e64d93ef07d24afeaa	When you do go for it, do it with confidence- nothing is a bigger turn off than a guy who is unsure or visibly nervous.

Compliment her, let her know that she should wear something like that more often..it brings out her eyes etc.<br>  <br>  You also need to head on intimate dates. But don't do this immediately, you need to be sure that she knows that you want it not to be a friendship anymore, but a loving companionship.

He/she will make sure nothing happens to you.|`|Gn23IX6naa	it depends why, and hmm i think you should say hey i dont fight.  Because i dont.  But just watch out talk it out hopefully it works hope i helped a little.|`|5YKfhEJ1aa	i've dealt with my fair share of these things. what i did was make her look really stupid and immature, if you really hate her its even funnier NOT to fight her because thats what she wants and she will get really mad that she cant get it. be like "im not fighting you bc thats what you want me to do, and the last thing i want is for you to get what you desire" hahaha and try to get the popular people on your side, usually the girl will get intimidated by them and leave you alone.
NvOro0igaa	don't accuse them without some evidence. Of course, 'gut feelings' are valid lots of times. If you enjoy the walks, continue them and take it as a compliment if they are talking about you.  After all, you must be the most interesting person in the entire world if your friends can't find anything more exciting to talk about.|`|AA10739434	Get 100% positive evidence.<br>  Once you have it confront all of them one at a time. If you have to fight one of them, so be it. <br>  Trust me: when it is all over you feel better about it. You set an example out of them that they are $hitty backstabbing no good 8astards.|`|Wf8PbTraaa	try to get some proof. <br>  <br>  if they are talkin bout you behind your back then theres something wrong and maybe you should look for new friends but the worst thing you can do is assume they're doing it cuz they might not be.....try to get some proof.|`|FBUEi2Pnaa	hi everyone|`|5FVyVS9vaa	You think they do?

Hang out with them less, and when you do dont tell them anything personal.
rOxdhG85aa	cos they are easy and there in front of u. and u want some authority.<br>  u shud calm down, listen to slow silent type music and maybe take a hobby. i kind of did the same thing. M|`|BaNrweQ4aa	because of what has happened to you, you are possibly finding it hard to let people in. you find it hard to talk to people; and be nice to people when the closest people to you have hurt you in some way. just remember to try and keep calm when you're with her. she won't get sick of you; she's stuck with you all this time hasn't she? she just wants to help you - but just remember to show her your appreciation and care, and treat her really well. TRY not to lash out at her as much as possible, but she must know your feelings are all over the place at the minute - after what is happening.|`|RKQHRMusaa	because of your abuse, i think in a way yourve kind of built a wall around yourself and are very protective. you need to try and let her in because you trust her and she wont do damage like everyone else.|`|Mzrx4IDWaa	Firstly it's good that you have established this as a problem! What you're experiencing isn't uncommon. We all have ways of expressing our emotions but sometimes it can be in ways that hurt others. I think you lash out at your friend because she'll listen to you and you can express yourself to her, however it could be that what she says to you isn't necessarily beneficial if it sparks this behaviour. I would strongly recommend you see a counselor, they can help you with the abuse your family give you and you could find a more healthy way to deal with your emotions. I'm sure your friend will appreciate it too!<br>  <br>  All the best!|`|mC6mrOYiaa	Because you feel safe at that time to do so + you know she gets upset and therefore you got emotional response. Like with kids sometimes- negativ attention is better than none at all - so kids who feel ignored are often naughty---- that 's  how I think it works
5f232a0e5670e2a5079c788abe7190a5aa	You dont even know if what he has told you is true. these days the internet is not a good place to meet people. I would say if you do meet in person make sure to take some other friends or family with you just in case. You might be " in love" with something you wont be able to handle. people arent always what they seem to be especially people you meet off the internet <br>  be careful|`|dCmSA6r2aa	you don't love him hon you love what he has told you about himself you don't even know if it is true|`|I3jogjGHaa	Hey could be fourty, remember, anyone can be anyone online|`|e9JRcA35aa	That's tricky, because like that ^ person up there said you only know what you've been told. What you're feeling could be love, but it might be for someone whose a whole lot different than you originally thought. If you feel like you need to meet him in person, that's really the only way you'll know for sure. If you do that, you'll be able to size things up and figure it out for yourself. If you are truly that uncomfortable about his relationship with that girl then you need to talk to him about it. I wouldn't outright say DON'T TALK TO HER, but atleast let him know how you feel. If you don't, the problem isn't going to go away.|`|vTra7n5baa	You have not met him so all of this is imaginary on his part and yours.  It feels so good to you because it's a fantasy and you don't have to deal with any gritty reality which WOULD come from meeting the guy.  This is why fantasies are great:  they feel good and we get what we want.  But don't trick yourself into thinking this is anything but one at this point.|`|xOYGzkSxaa	oh no, this sounds bad.<br>  I'm going to agree with Tara completely, you don't love him you love the idea of him. He's fed you everything you've ever wanted to hear. Anyone can charm a person that doesn't know anything about them. He clearly doesn't care for you otherwise he would have never started talking again to that other girl. You need to understand that what you're feeling is infatuation. What you feel now is merely a passing illusion. Forget about him, erase all of the texts and his number and start meeting guys in person from now on.
ff545BLyaa	Guys don't show there emotions on their sleves so to speak because it makes them appear to be weak....  I certainly never show my emotions, not even anger because well a man who can control his emotions is well a man.  As for why he is acting this way exactly I cannot be sure its just a guy thing...
RPdBmJ9Caa	Well i have the same problem except with a girl, since i'm a guy. From a guys perspective, we try to sometimes conceal any type of emotions, so we don't get called "whipped" so we try not to make it to obvious, I know what you mean about the awkwardness that's why i don't ask out the girl i like. But not telling each other crushes can be a double bladed sword, some guys don't like girls they have an interest/crush/like to tell them their crushes.It makes them jealous and feel like they don't have much of a chance since your interests in types seemingly lye elsewhere.<br>  <br>  <br>  If you need more help or I didnt quite answer you tell me and i will try to get a better answer!<br>  Good luck i hope it works out!<br>  -Casey|`|KTtf0GLlaa	dont tell him till your certain he like you back trust me it can get awkward a guy also my best friend told me he likes me and i didnt feel the same way and its like hard to tell someone that u care about you dont like them itll make things awkward ask your mates to find out for you befor saying anything friendship before relationships always xxx hope it helps|`|fLHAZyVCaa	Check out VIDEOJUG's vid on <br>  "how to tell if a guy is attracted to you"<br>  <br>  www.videojug.com<br>  they have heaps on this website! its great!<br>  <br>  also i think that you should practice being ICE COOL. dont whine or whinge otherwise he will get sick of you. make him WANT to see you <br>  <br>  <br>  good luck!!!!!!|`|2hR9KKl5aa	tell him you like him|`|b0zcQZkKaa	why don't you just ask him?|`|FfTrEBfCaa	if u were true friends.....n things dont work out...then u wud still be friends|`|6E16tR6xaa	I think he likes you.

But make sure you act like you don't know anything about that. Make sure he thinks you're friend is just making fun of you two. Then have your friend tell you his exact response's. Also try just telling him your feelings. You'll never know till you try.|`|CXT1SecRaa	i would just stay friends, what if you dated and something happened and you broke up, it would be hard to go back to "the way it was", ive been in these situations before with girlfriends and i would rather have my best friends stay that way, and go out with other people|`|1BeKAfS6aa	tell him how u feel and if hes feeling the same way. if he does then go to a movie or somethin and if he doesnt...well usually friendshipis usually awkward after that. also give it sometime. if u want give a litle more flirty signals than usual and see how he reacts to those|`|ZQZf1iINaa	ask him. if he says no, tell him it was just a zap.|`|iRGC6bWsaa	you should just come right out and tell him|`|o7RgYN31aa	Send one of his friends to ask him if he likes u. then u will know|`|aeWy3eu7aa	oh gosh this sounds just like what happened to me...hopefully you have better luck though ^^. The thing is... guys are complicated! they tend to say one thing then do the exact oppisite. This happend to me in my scenairo though he was my friend and we talked on the phone like till 2 in the morning for like amonth and we told each other really dark secrets and well he ended up finding out i liked him. he said that was fine but he only liked me as a friend things from there got worse and well were still friends and i am just now starting to get over him... i meet him a year ago. well the thing is if you tell you friend this and he doesnt feel the same ... it will be a bit akward but if you are friends he should understand and still be your friend if he kicks you to the curb over this then hes not a true friend also he might like you you never no? if it were me i would be sutal don't out right ask him but be like so any good fish in the sea lately? wait if he is akward about it just start laughing and pretend it was a joke this could mean he likes you. you could also just be flirty when you hang out with him, drop hints when your around and let him no that your into him, see his response. Or you could use the direct approach and be like i like you as more than a friend but if thats to much for you then i still dont want to lose you as a friend either?! <br>  i don't no what else to say really i hope i helped i no where your coming from though MUCH luck to you hope you do better than me!
fTVhtE0maa	if you do not think you are ready, then dont do it. you dont sound very old. it does hurt the first couple of times and you may bleed a little, but everything will be okay. it is a very emotional experience for females, more than males. they are afraid to get dumped or something like that, but make sure you use protection so that you dont get pregnant. if you are not ready then wait a while. no one says you need to do it now, and if they do then say "FU[K YOU" i'll do it when i am ready.|`|wHTErwGgaa	Hello, i know exactly how you feel. I'd imagine your a teen yeah? So am I, i've only recently had sex in November and then again in February a couple weeks ago, if that helps. <br>  <br>  Anyway, I was terribly scared. So much so that I did lots of research & stuff months and months and months before. I was so scared, but then one day it just happened. I had thoughts like what if it doesn't go in, what if the condom breaks etc. <br>  <br>  But then, it happened. It didn't hurt at all, and it didn't bleed either, as some people say it does. I may just be different but I was very relieved to find that no blood, no pain, no pregnancy. Even though the condom was used I was still scared I was pregnant afterwards and that'll definitely be one of your concerns, but when a durex is used, you won't be. So if you're ready, go for it cause it's not as bad as it seems, you can barely feel a thing :)|`|9s0QPMmoaa	The pain depends on the person.  I know for me it hurt the first time but the pain only lasted for a minute or so and then it felt good.  If your too worried about the pain that may be a sign that you are not ready.  However, if the guy is a gentlemen he will make sure that you are comfortable and try to make the experience as pleasurable as possible.

JquoBRKJaa	why would you want someone who doesnt like you? it cant be love. because (and this is just my theory) you cant love someone truley unless they love you back. its only love both ways, if you have feelings for him and he doesnt have feelings for you, your just infatuated with him. If your mean to eachother you clearly dont have a good relationship. you want something healthy and happy, =) be strong, if he realized hes made a mistake and comes back to you then so be it, and you can work on making a real relationship that lasts, if he doesnt chase you it isnt worth it. hope I helped|`|ZzEAc5ecaa	it will be hard as he love you .. with all his heart .. and you broke it .. yu must give him time to heal .. then try again ...like in a month or 2 .. but just as friends at first ok ... good luck to you both ..|`|Hek7MUNYaa	may be b4 you dumped him, you though that you and him had a real relationship, but it REALLY wasn't <br>  <br>  so may be he never liked you and your just trying too hard <br>  <br>  oh but the only way you can get him back and DRESS SEXY <br>  make guys to flirt with you<br>  he will get jealous and will want you back

And I must commend you and your girlfriend for thinking so responsibly, most young adults in your situation would have most likely done the act and dealt with everything else after wards.<br>  <br>  If I were a reasonable parent I would respect that my child is growing up and that sex is an inevitable act. It is very closed mined for them to think that you will remain a virgin into your late adulthood -- that's just not the way things tend to happen today. <br>  <br>  On the other hand they could really flip out and think that you're too young. I noticed that mothers almost never want their son's to grow up and they get upset when their son's do become sexually active. While the father will most likely be understanding.<br>  But for the girl, I think it's harder. Fathers NEVER want their "little girls" to grow up, and would probably hate you if he ever found out, and mothers (especially old school ones) wouldn't be much better.<br>  <br>  It really depends, only you and your partner know your parents well enough to know.|`|dmEiFFGAaa	be carful wear the condom wear the condom because if you dont and a baby pops out you probably can't go to college because your going to have to stay home and then you will be flipping burgers do it back door but i dont know how you feel about it|`|58624ad5fd2dd57e6a4e665efe1fee92aa	I'm 35 years old... if I had a 17 years old daughter or son...

Having sex and using protect is great but that isn't 100% sure or PROTECTIVE in her becoming pregnant.<br>  <br>  I think the best thing for you two to do, is wait until you're engaged or even better marriage. You two have a long history together, don't ruin it. 4 months of a relationship isn't very long, I'd wait. Especially if you are both virgins.<br>  <br>  To answer your question though, If I found out my 17 year old had sex I'd be a litte hurt and let down because I thoguht I'd raised them to wait until marriage. Yet, that's just my background on life.<br>  <br>  Good luck with your decision though and everything else!|`|1oiUVWvYaa	my parents found out about me and my boyfriend when i was 16, and they didn't freak out or anything. they were more careful about leaving us alone in the house, but unless your girlfriend's parents are really religious, there shouldn't be too much of a porblem unless you get her pregnant. and if you use contraception, that is extremely unlikely to happen.|`|N9dbMxESaa	well, as parents obviously they have gone through the same as you, all they will probably worry about is the use of contraception. also your are at the legal age to do it.|`|mfZvg4rGaa	17 is a perfectly respectable age, and it seems it would be done with a lot of thought and love in mind, even if things don't work out.<br>  That would be something i could understand and accept if i were a parent.|`|Rm9pMntIaa	these days, your parents would probably consider that to be rather late.

I know you're way too young to be even thinking of those things, but just be sure that you KNOW that she's the one for you...<br>  <br>  I know people who have 'done it' with their girlfriend/boyfriend and like, a while later, they broke up. And like, they say that they wasted all that love making, expressing how they feel in the dark...<br>  <br>  for absolutley nothing.........<br>  <br>  nothing but a broken heart....<br>  <br>  So just be careful.. it is ENTIRELY up to you, but this is just one's opinion.... so... sorry if i offended, or anything.|`|Lk0noY62aa	Usa a condom and you have nothing to worry about.|`|NlhxkblIaa	i would obviously feel taken aback because they didnt tell me but if it was safe i wouldnt mind

(has nothing to do with you, she may have co-dependant issues)  you just enjoy your time with your friends and she will go away.  some females are into the me, me, me. and dont think of the outcome of what they are doing...... dont take the mad part personally, it really has nothing to do with you, it has to do with her and her own self esteem.|`|kGAu6wcWaa	Tell her that you don't have feelings and that you want to be friends.

8McA6xqPaa	Now if you feel her low income degrades you and you aren't happy to support her, either emotionally or financially then that is your call and your call alone.<br>  I must say that it is pretty low to dump someone for this reason. But you need to ask yourself, Does she ever ask/expect money to be given to her? Is she making her own way with what she earns or does she expect you to provide for her? Are you unhappy with a future with you as the sole earner (this is if your taking it further)? If yes, and this isnt what you want then yes, do dump her. If no, then give the girl some credit and perhaps look at a way of helping her access a higher paid career.<br>  <br>  Its sad to see money end a relationship. But then again, if thats of greater importance to either or both of you, then perhaps its just for the best.|`|sr0vZPQqaa	Well if you were hoping for that then yes.|`|AA11841749	Ouch. Depends.  Does she work all of these low paying jobs because she's too lazy to go do something better, or is that all she is able to do (with her education and experience)?  Do what makes you happy.  But that's kind of messed up to dump someone because they don't make a lot of money.  I think somewhere in the marriage vows say, "To have and to hold, from this day forward, for better for worse, for richer for poorer, in sickness and in health, to love and to cherish, till death us do part."  If you love her, it shouldn't matter that she's broke.  As long as she's not with you just for your money.|`|BYQ2kHPjaa	I have to be honest and say that that is disgusting and horrible. You shouldn't go out with someone or marry then just because of their money. Love means accepting someone for who they are. You should be at least a little ashamed! If you don't feel anything for her (which you obviously dont because otherwise you wouldn't be considering dumping her), then dump her and save her the heartache!!|`|cydakP87aa	well if this woman is not really what you were looking for then yes...<br>  but still that is a little shallow dont you think?<br>  i understand you not wanting to support this womans absolute every need<br>  but part of being married is supporting each other not just emotionally but financially as well <br>  so even though you are not married to this woman someday you will be married to some woman and you should be willing to help support her|`|IENH5cogaa	Dumpppp Her.<br>  You Want Someone Who Can Compliment Your Swagg Not Ride For Free & Cramp Your Style.<br>  Yesss Of Course Love Isn't About Money But Money Can Play A Big Part In HAPPINESS So Leave That Alone For Your Sake, And The Future Of You And Your Kids.

He may be new at it or you may be good at it ;-)<br>  You should take it at a compliment, but if you want him to last longer he can relieve himself earlier in the day or tere is some condoms and other lubricants that can help a guy last longer|`|vpNlm86waa	Nah, most men only tend to last on average 3-4 minutes.

If not he needs to train himself to control it.  Have him practice by masturbating and getting close and then stopping.this may help.  I'm not absolutely sure, I never had a premature ejaculation problem, not bragging just telling the truth.|`|pZevjTXGaa	I think it's because he gets excited too quick and once he releases, he needs time to recharge, that's probably why he can last a lot longer the second time. It's really not a big deal.

nv7Cofm5aa	I'm 27 yrs old and have never been in your situation but I met a few women who were in their 40's and 50's showing an interest in me. Some asked me out... a few complimented me... and I couldn't help but notice how much confidence these older women have as opposed to the very young (and often confusing) generation of women in their 20's we see today. The difference comes from their experience and the need to seek what they really want. The 20's are still confused about who they are (what they want, etc) and you will see a pattern of them jumping from relationship to relationship. <br>  <br>  So to sum it up... you're a 22 yr old guy who likes a 50 yr old woman. As we both know, this isn't very common but don't let that hold you back from deciding what you really want.<br>  <br>  I think an interesting thing this 50 yr old woman said was, "I figured he liked me... it's just too bad....." I think what she's saying here is that she fears the unknown. She's afraid she might cause tension in your relationship with your parents. In other words, what are your parents going to think about it... what are older adults (her age) going to think about it? It's taboo.... and people don't like doing things out of the ordinary. <br>  <br>  And I say this... because people who are afraid of taking risks... don't have the guts and confidence (like yourself) to do something about it. We have grown in a typical society and culture that glamours 'sameness' and not 'differences'. But I think deep down inside, and no matter who you are.... that we all have secret desires to be attracted to people other than our own kind. <br>  <br>  The challenge is to get yourself out there.... take risks... and to be prepared for a lot of backstabbing or negative views coming your way. But I admire your confidence. I appreciate the question you have asked here today. It shows how open and honest you really are. <br>  <br>  So what are you waiting for? Ask her out... but most of all... hold no expectations. Good luck and godspeed.....

He may be physically attracted to you still and just want to be friends with benefits, he is a guy after all. (Sorry guys no disrespect meant.) You're probably best off putting some space between you until you get over him, or try to move on, so that you don't get hurt.|`|f7f0fd5f021b5d1e4672cdbda2a11ffeaa	Time to move on. He knows you have a soft spot for him now and he is taking advantage of it.  Unless he is willing to get back with you officially, I would cut all contact with him until I was over him.  It really doesn't seem like he is looking for anything serious and you can't change a persons feelings.  At the very least tell him to stop acting like he is your bf (hugs, hand holding, flirting etc)  if he doesn't want to be your bf.|`|4e5b3604525939a6fa0e40c9b5f5bf7aaa	Love is pain. To experience true love one must feel pain so embrace the relationship that you two now have, enjoy being his friend, enjoy him holding your hands and then things will be better in time.

Sometimes we'll do the "Right" thing when we know its the wrong.  If you guys were that into each other as you say then I think some of the emotions are still inside that dude, emotions like that just don't go away overnight and they definitely don't go away in three weeks.  I don't want to set you up for failure but (oh this is hard to do when you're talking about us guys) try and get him to open up..sounds hard I know, and well just get to the bottom of it.  This WILL take time and If he opens up I suggest you prepare your heart cause it might be great news or the worse news.  The key is to get him to open up and make sure he's not screwing with your emotions because if he is...do me and yourself a favor...chin check that S.O.B

Your fear is well founded as it is the opposite of love.  If a man were looking for a woman with self-respect, self-esteem, integrity, and self-worth, he would not choose you.  These qualities are no exclusive of going out amd having a good time.  The next time you want to go out, spend some time from the source listed below.|`|8QhPUxllaa	It probably is a reaction to your marrage ending.  Wanna feel loved? Needed? And you always get guys when drunk maybe you feel more confident? Either way it doesn't sound good.<br>  Why not try and not have a drink? Drive down and then you can't drink!  Or tell yourself only to have 1 drink and then you will get yourself that top you have been eyeing up?  <br>  You don't want a rep so i say stop the drink!|`|SmFVG8eXaa	Maybe you need to stop drinking. It seems like that is what makes your decision making go out the window.  Its ok to go out and have fun, but try without the alcohol and see what happens.|`|AA10743159	A couple of issues popped into my mind, one, you have very low self esteem. Second, your behavior is very self destructive. It's as if you are trying to punish yourself, for something you feel really bad about.<br>  I don't think you will find those kind of answers on here, but if I may, I would suggest, you get professional help, <br>  I know that can be expensive, but I'm sure if you look around, and do some research, you may be able to find some low cost or free, therapy.<br>  You are heading down a dangerous path, so it's no wonder you are scared to death. Something is driving you,  and you need to find out, what the underlying cause is. So perhaps you need to sit down, with yourself and see what it is, that is causing this kind of behavior.<br>  This isn't the real you, or you wouldn't be worried about being some kind of "Ho", so you need to find who and what you are.<br>  good luck. At least you have taken the first step and understand you do have a big problem.|`|f7f0fd5f021b5d1e4672cdbda2a11ffeaa	My guess is that the alcohol is the root of the problem. It makes you lose your inhibitions and then you end up doing stuff that you regret.  Perhaps you should stop drinking when you go out, or find a better place to hang out.  Maybe you feel like you were missing out on playing the field during the time you were married and subconsciously you are trying to catch up or something.  Wouldn't hurt to talk to a therapist about it.|`|T272vObnaa	You're just lonely, scared and insecure about your future.  I did the same thing after I ended a long term relationship, going to the bar every night, getting wasted and hooking up with some random guy, and waking up the next morning feeling dirty and hating myself.

I suggest not going to a drinking establishment anymore, and finding another more constructive hobby, like going back to school, or joining a club, or something.|`|sCCjAKllaa	Wow.

I grew up without a strong male role model. I was wild in my teenage years until I survived a fatal car accident, was sexually assaulted by a friend, and dated a few abusive guys. I finally gained self-respect. I'm actually seeing a therapist to get some closure on my past. I would strongly recommend the same for you. They bring valid points to your attention to give you the tools to work past whatever issues you are struggling with. Good luck to you. Oh, don't beat yourself up. It will only make you feel worse about yourself. It sounds like you see the right path in by knowing what the problem is. Keep going in that direction to fix it.|`|91ba808e7cbaa05530f306c80d49a7f9aa	In no more than you have said, there are two problem areas that you need o consider; the first one is where you go, as bars, pool rooms and such are where people go to seek others that like to do the things that are bothering you when you do them.<br>  <br>  The other problem is the drinking! alcohol or any other kind of drug causes people to do things they don't really want to do.<br>  <br>  A good Christian counselor could be a big help to you as I am sure that there are many other unsolved problems in your life that need to be dealt with.<br>  <br>  Look in your phone book under Southern Baptist or Independent Baptist churches and call one of their Pastors; he should be able to direct you to someone who can help you.<br>  <br>  My e mail is open if you would like more information.<br>  <br>  Greybeard|`|9c16f104f9589fa27971d779def0ac39aa	Talk to someone you trust - preferably a friend or family member.

You do have self control issues and i highly recommend you talk to someone you trust or a counselor. It also may be that you are not ready to settle down but i also do think it's not right for a person to be so wild regardless of whether or not they want to be committed. You see, it seems as if you are dealing with some insecurities or a lack of something in your life, maybe direction and it shows by your lack of controlling your urges.

If you are not, seek God for help. You will change only when you're ready. Stay focused on the better things. A temporary moment of pleasure forces you to be hurt internally forever! So remember that. And no guy is going to sleep with you on the first night. When you go out, try not to drink. Or have one and be done. If you feel like you're wanting to kiss someone, LEAVE! You have to choose, your happiness, or his nut? Seriously...|`|F0NfKljZaa	Just don't let it get to you. Maybe you just have not found the right person to spend the rest of your life with.|`|YTHmYqllaa	i think you just need to find other ways to occupy your time....(honestly, kissing around wouldnt bother me if i was single) your not married, go have fun!|`|aZeiP116aa	I don't know, you sound like a ho to me|`|6gPCA7jHaa	So, what's your poison? Don't worry its on me.|`|55f8f33e16dda3c1b6a2648fb6bfdd46aa	First of all there is absolutely nothing wrong with U ... U R just a very sensual woman. U probably love bubble baths, good smelling food, romantic music ... U R just normal girlfriend. But.. the 1st thing U have to learn to do is to keep UR mouth shut!! Never, ever tell!! NEVER!! Remember the song "that's' my story and I'm sticking to it"... so once U get UR loose lips under control U have to control UR drinking... buy Shirley Temples' ... no one knows ... or a beer shanty, 50/50 beer & ginger ale.. Tastes great!!Now 3rdly.. if U put yourself in a Pool Hall, leaning over the table, with UR "tush" sticking out... what do U expect girl?? Men R Men.. they have a one track mind... straight to the bedroom... so unless U want to be known as the "one night wonder".. get in control!! Find another sport - go bowling... don't drink.. or at least drink in moderation... and only occasionally.. remember girlfriend.. everything, everything U do today becomes a memory when U R older... make them good girlfriend . U won't regret it...|`|eXpZD0vlaa	You seem to have some issues about self-confidence and self-image.  Confident people with good self-images don't get drunk and act silly.  <br>  <br>  You don't have confidence, so you get drunk and then seek approval from other men by getting them to show desire for you.  Clearly, this isn't a positive or safe way to deal with your issues.<br>  <br>  Firstly, with any behavior problem, you need to stay away from places and people that encourage that bad behavior.  If that means you lose certain friends or stop going to certain places, so be it.<br>  <br>  Secondly, you need to get to know yourself better and why you seem to have self-confidence and self-image issues.  Read books or seek professional help.  I don't know you well enough to help you there.<br>  <br>  Thirdly, find different things to do that will address your self-confidence issues by bettering yourself.  Take courses, contribute your time to charities, spend more time with family, take up a sport or hobby, ...<br>  <br>  You're not alone.  Many people reach a certain place in their life where they don't feel all that good about themselves and excitement or happiness becomes hard to find.  You just need to relax and take some time to find yourself again.
SHARt1k3aa	It's all about timing.  If some guy said those things to me after a month of dating him, I would be weary.  You can feel those things without having to actually tell her.  Show her instead and see where this relationship goes and you'll know just the right time to express yourself in this way.  It's very nice you feel these things for this woman, but you can't say them until you are sure the feeling is mutual.  And... I'm sure her friends have already told her.|`|tZIjts6iaa	Just do it. Take her to dinner and give her a note expressing all your feelings. I know it's scary to see how she may respond, but what good will it do you to keep it all inside? She may feel the same way but is afraid to as well. Tell her how you feel somehow. If you can't say it to her face, find another way to do it and wait for her to respond.|`|YTXoBgVsaa	You should go for it. You may get your heart broken, but there is a chance you won't. That way you won't live with the question: What if...?|`|QU26DsUhaa	ask her to marry you|`|AA11660242	You can't tell her romantic things up front because that is just too creepy. She will think you're a creep and won't want to talk to you. I would probablly start by befriending her and conversating with her. Be nice to her, smile, deliver a good, strong first impression. Dress well, practice good hygiene, and be polite. These things all play an important role in winning her over. It's kind of hard to give you more in-detail advice on how exactly to approach her because you haven't mentioned where it is that you see her. Could you please be more specific? I'm glad that you've found the woman of your dreams after 30 years, my fortunate brother. Good luck.
YTXoBgVsaa	There is no one type of body a guy should have. I've fallen for chubby guys, muscular ones, and super skinny ones. As long as your compfortable in your own skin you'll be noticed. Just remember: Confidence goes a long way.|`|e9dHHGCSaa	There is no right answer, only answers that young ladies find acceptable...|`|509248920483afa8396e2237322a94beaa	I know what kind of body a teen guy shouldn't have ... man boobs and a big tummy.|`|wuyjidC0aa	a nice one. lol. i dont really know what you mean?|`|CTE2eRgZaa	I like anything in the range of a little tummy to toned.  I don't like really buff or really overweight guys.  I want a teddy bear-like consistancy|`|a1iam8Zvaa	i kinda like tall skinny guys lol<br>  like skater boys =]|`|RoqxGbgRaa	a healthy one.
a2OeOFeMaa	Take it slowly. Speak to each other and you never know what might develop|`|2H0IbjRUaa	I think you should ask him. If he does not feel the same way but still wants to kiss you then it's time to move on. He might be using you.<br>  Seriously just ask him!!|`|4U76UK81aa	Sounds like he is into you...but you need to figure out what his motives are.  You have known him long enough to be able to feel it out.  Just spend more time seeing how much effort he makes to see you now that he moved.  If he continues the effort, he probably still likes you...otherwise he wouldn't bother.<br>  <br>  xoxo|`|rhA94L05aa	Okay,<br>  talk to him tell him how you feel before its too late.<br>  you have to find out if he likes you because he cant just use you.. thats just wrong. you should take him somewhere quite and talk to him and just say.. look i relli like you n stuff but do you feel the same way? This happened to me once i rellii likedd this guy we were so into eachother.. turns out he was useing me like O_o, but thats my personal experiense hope it works out for you :D xx|`|4q4jG7A1aa	sorry but it sounds like your friends are right and hes using you it he actually liked you then he would asked you out or something .x|`|IxR6Akpwaa	I'm sorry I can't get him to like you. Not even for 10 points!|`|tzeCf8MEaa	ask him if he feels the way u do
axCFlk5Zaa	This is a common thing, especially in younger men. <br>  <br>  He is probably extremely scared and depressed. Having a baby is a complete life changing event and a serious commitment. <br>  <br>  You need to sit him down and talk about it, he sure isn't going to want too, but you have to do it. <br>  <br>  Whether or not he sticks around is a matter of his morals and decency. A man that would abandon his own baby and the mother isn't really a man at all, just a scared boy. <br>  <br>  If he is already sticking around he does love you, but is probably very confused about everything. He probably had dreams and plans before settling down and having a baby that he won't be able to do now.|`|XSyvi6rOaa	let him go  make your own life with your family  wait for the right one  it seems like his interest is physical only|`|n7zMHNRWaa	Honestly, it seems to me like he isnt sure if he wants to be with you for the rest of his life, or wants that committment of a baby. if you really love someone and something like this happens you deal with it and start becoming happier about it. In this case, it seems like he doesnt even want to speak about it at all. Like he got the guilt trip for leaving you so he got back together with you, but then is still thinking to himself that he doesn't want to be a father. In this case, i think you are heading for more heartbreak than you ever deserve because nobody deserves any, and youve alrady been broken..<br>   <br>  And this is obviously going to stress you out- you don't need more stress then you already have.I am worried that he is going to stick it out till times get rough (around the time of the baby) and then just run. and leave you there all by yourself. <br>  <br>  So, with that said i think you should try to just focus on you and the baby, ( which is the most important factore anyway) because you can get help from people who really truly do care about you. <br>  <br>  best wishes!
gKMoAPZaaa	Most of the time you are only allowed to send letters, no pictures, nothing.  You would have to find out by contacting the place and then get his number in order that it arrives to him.|`|szcA8CDyaa	Maybe|`|364815ba0e4e52ba14aa1cef4ad4e5a0aa	definitely not! unless you are allowed to. maybe you should send him a letter asking him.
wW6NJk4jaa	ask her what she thinks about you two doing something alone, don't say specifically that its a date
VII5wup3aa	You can definitely make it work (: I've been in one for almost 2 years now and although everyday seems harder, we love each other so we make it through. Not getting to touch him is one of the worst pains I've ever felt. If you love each other that's not will make it work...I mean that's a big part. The biggest part in a LDR is communication....tell each other everything, don't give the other person a reason to doubt you on anything. That's what makes them work...that and the fact that if you're meant to be together nothing will stop it <3|`|u8HYfTnyaa	my experience was when i was dating a high school senior, she went to collage and a few moths later told me she fell in love with someone else. they may work, but only if the other loves you as much as you love them.|`|d3gc60wAaa	well i was in the same situation and it worked out for the two of us and if u love him and he loves u then it should work out for the two of u|`|FSMpMA9saa	well as long as your have trust in each other, i am sure you two will be fine|`|gO2YDnxoaa	I've was in a LDR as well once upon a time. What it did was create a trusting faithfulness between me and my boyfriend. There is also the painful longing that you will feel, but when you do see each other...Man is it awesome and it makes all the distance all that much more minimal. Distance becomes a minor detail when it comes to all the things you love and appreciate about your significant other. If fact it makes you love and appreciate your time together all the more. Only you can decide if it's worth the time and work.|`|hNzIaZLCaa	well, starters, do either of you go out? And if you do, do you trust him going out with his friends? and does he trust you with your friends! Sometimes long distance relationships don't work, even though you want it to work, so the only thing i can say is you both need to ask yourselfs can this work, and to you both need to have trust! :)|`|CM0C65dtaa	I think they can work out.  I had one (3 hours away) and the guy said he just got tired of having to drive all the time (I was unable to leave as I was caring for my Mom), and not being able to go out much, as well as some unrelated stuff.  We broke up for about 9 months, then circumstance changed and we got back together  - we have now been living together for almost 2 years.  I think he just couldn't see any end to being apart.  But it all worked out in the long run.  I think if you know its only for a while, it can work.|`|8McA6xqPaa	Distance tore my parents' relationship apart. They both cahnged as people and it just didn't fit anymore. But i hope you can make it work for you, just don't stay apart too long :)
QRbCnBgFaa	You pooped SOOOOO HARD that you blew off your duvet and your clothes and even blew off your vagina hairs.|`|DbfQuKeeaa	That is some freaky stuff. I don't know what happened to you but maybe you should get a big scary dog to guard your house of something.|`|CryNyW0Faa	hahahaha when you say your vagina hair was all clean, does that mean you had never washed it before, or had been shaved?|`|1NF6f4y7aa	LOL<br>  what do you say to that?<br>  <br>  That was the funniest thing I've ever read!!!!!!!!<br>  <br>  I think i shat myself too after reading that!|`|lTOeMNnraa	Are you sure you don't sleep walk?|`|EkLJDcc7aa	i have no idea:/|`|LYO0Y8lHaa	If I could give this question a thumbs down.....i would.......|`|pmkdQKEvaa	you messed up in some weird sh*t ladyyyy|`|p4P24vtYaa	Okay, so if it really did happen  =s         :<br>  <br>  Firstly do you have a pet. <br>  <br>  Like a dog could easily pull a duvet off, poo on your bed and do something to your V hair?   You never know! :S   <br>  <br>  Also look around the house to see if you got up in the night. Just because you haven't sleep walked before doesn't mean you never will. I mean if you had a bad dream, or a nightmare you could of even pooed yourself! I mean you might never know what you do when you are in a deep sleep. <br>  <br>  But yeah, if you really think it is that bad then move house.|`|ZaBUp8DDaa	HI!

5eIhjnNfaa	This dude sounds like a total flirt..<br>  Anyways, he's probably not at a place where he's ready to jump into a relationship. Or he may be waiting around to see how much he can get from you without actually dating you.<br>  Also, you might be scaring him a little with how open you are.. don't spill all your feelings so soon!
RKQHRMusaa	lol thats called being a male<br>  and if hes acting himself in that cruel way at home, he wouldnt want other people seeing him like that :P|`|LIye5Tvuaa	lol aw. it sounds like you're jealous of your twin brother. lol i find it kind of cute. he through a shoe at his twin sister, that is a bit mean =\|`|AA11742344	TOTALLY.<br>  <br>  my sister is quite the same. trust me, just wait until he's out of school, then he will have no time to make "funny" comments, and hang with friends all day or popularity to be around him, he should eventually grow out of it.
eO4y3m1maa	Dont trust him, especially since hes a player...he probably just wants to hook up with his brothers ex...|`|yKUYapAkaa	he might be a player, but who knows, you could be the one to change his player ways<br>  he could actually fall in love with you<br>  give it a try<br>  youll be surprised at the results<br>  more than you could ever imagine|`|wuZXqYPGaa	ya its hard when he is a player, and you know that he can do the same to you. plus it can wreck ur friendship.. i vote that you just take it slow, if he thinks ur worth it he wont take advantage of you :)|`|X05GAaLeaa	Tell him how you feel<br>  Hes probably just in it for the sex tho|`|MzeyhJ60aa	well it seems like you are in a pickle...um well you know hes a player and you can either go out with him if he still likes you and jus see how it goes and if it starts heading down that rode then tell him off nicely. u no....before that point comes to go farther jus say look i see you more as a best friend then as a bf an i jus want to be friends. that way he doesnt hav time to go farther an he really shouldnt be hurt bc you didnt turn him down right when u guys were about to go farther. and if he does end up getting hurt and trying to make more moves then you really need to think if hes a really good friend as u think he is. i hope this helps :)|`|1itmn0NOaa	Dear friend,<br>         you are in the wrong way, keep yourself safe from the guy.<br>  keep 2 things in mind <br>    1 you could have best frenship at least with him with sexual relationship.<br>    2.This is good If you can feel the sexual activities are normal natural activities then you should not be afraid of him.<br>   3 If you could not agree on 2 you should better considered him as aplayer completely. Doubt within you could be dangerous.|`|6kAtYLAdaa	welcome to the club of girls who fall for unexplainable boys.  you will be a member of this club until you no longer love this boy.  the membership includes, insecurity, second guessing everything he says and does, always waiting for him to change, always hoping for the chance that you'll be his girl.... among others which are too long to mention at the present time.  arent you happy your a memeber?|`|iTjZMSukaa	i think u should try talking to him to see if ur relationship is gonna work out. if hes gonna go out with U and be devoted to U and love U, there needs to be no other girl in that picture. and if there is, he's not worth it.|`|CV2NPBMAaa	this is a very confusing thing to go through! <br>  i see why this is hurting, i see why your seeking help. <br>  but honestly this needs to come from you. <br>  look deep in yourself and just think of the possiblities. <br>  only you will know what to do.|`|HC6rrHLDaa	i dated a player once. i thought i liked him but he turned out to be a horrible guy. if he told you he loved you then i think you should give it a shot. but if anything starts happening that you don't like end it right away|`|7y5u3Vxdaa	if your happy being friends then so be. don't ever think that you have to go out with a guy if you don't want to.|`|xo7MuX0Baa	well you obviously will love him to death if you keep going this way...he'll be the end of you. he's a player, that sucks . move on darlin'|`|6M6XhKDKaa	the only way you'll find out is if u ask him directly. then tell him your true feelings then i think he shud understand and maybe u can get ur date.|`|MAloAT8jaa	There is nothing wrong with testing the waters.

Go for it.|`|L9htPRRhaa	thats really funny u suck AT THIS LOL|`|VmuLzz0Waa	Don't do something with your ex brother because you want to get back no your ex and if you feel better by being good friends then leave it at that don't hurt yor self or anyone else and more with a player that maybe only want's to get in oyur pants so think about it.
WRJcALgtaa	be honest with him...i don't mean go up to him and say you have this super crush on him, but go up to him and say things that you notice about him that you can compliment him on (like, "hey, that's a cool ____...)  Or, you can try to relate to him with the same classes you guys are taking together.  These are good ways to start a conversation to let him know that you are willing to talk to him.  If he is willing to talk to you, you'll know it!|`|1XcTZRemaa	I would say, just make conversation. Say something like, "Hi, how are you?" or "Hey, what's up?" Start it up. And then talk about things you have in common, like crazy teachers or how your previous class was. Things like that. Have some fun, and joke around a little bit. You can also compliment him on stuff, and give him the occasional clue. :] Hope I helped!<br>  <br>  Actually, I'm at a similar situation, too: <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AvyCUOU_9Bof_PB7N44B5.nsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090219163918AArmEst">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a> Help me out?|`|6CAsx3jaaa	the real subtle trick is to get him to talk to you. you do that by wearing t shirts that get his attention or have something on them that he is interested in like a band. if you have seen the movie legally blonde try the drop and dip.the other option is ask his opinion about something.  like your a guy can you explain  the scoring of football for example|`|s4FEJiNHaa	anything that shows him that he's been noticed feels pretty good.  Just say "hi, noticed that u..." whatever, no matter how insignificant.  We dig that.  For example, this pretty cashier at a convenience store I regularly stop at recently asked me why I stopped buying mountain dew everyday and switched to bottled water.  Considering that she deals with what, 100 or more customers a day, I was impressed that she noticed that small detail about me.  It was a better icebreaker than u might think.|`|v42fQPyPaa	just like smile at him, but not in a creepy way,<br>  try to make him want to talk to you as well.<br>  you can even be strait forward and be like "hey, i see you all the time and it weird we never talk"<br>  something like that.|`|ZQZf1iINaa	smile when you walk by.|`|yid0jeX4aa	find something in common with you to and start a conversation about that. ask him out to a movie or sumthing|`|awdV68dXaa	The best way to do it is to bump into him or something. Bringing up something in common that you both have is good too like maybe if he is walking into a class you have you can ask him about homework or if he has a book or a t-shirt with a band on it. You could also make him want to talk to you. A smile and the flick of your hair sends messages.|`|H2yac1kUaa	Use sarcasm!<br>  But not insulting sarcasm to him, like, you can use insulting sarcasm, just, not insulting HIM.<br>  <br>  Find a common interest. Like, if you have a class together, ask for homework, or discuss that teacher, if she/he's evil, nice, whatever. I understand your pain, I really like this guy too!

pfm0wcEIaa	Don't sound upset or anything.  Being upset or angry is a sign of weakness.  It means he really got to you.  That will just feed his ego even further.<br>  <br>  The best way to make him feel like crap is to just not say anything.  Just stop picking up the phone, but when you do talk to him, send him mixed messages.  It takes a long time, because he is playing games with you too.  But if you wait long enough, I ensure you, that he will be the one calling you...<br>  <br>  It is hard.<br>  <br>  Honestly, the best thing you can do for yourself is just take good care of yourself and your things.  Be high maintenance.  Get a little more into yourself.  When you experience what putting yourself first feels like,  then all of a sudden you won't be seeking attention from pathetic fools.  AND he will be making a fool out of himself when he wants you back!<br>  <br>  But, I know, you can't stop thinking about it...<br>  <br>  Although, I am telling you, self-love is the best option.  People can sense when you love yourself and they will want to love you too...|`|af644b7256e7bf5a53974bb99a32d482aa	Do it on text. "Hey, I just dumped you because you have a giant ego.

OR cheat on him with one of his best friends :P|`|tZIjts6iaa	Those things that he brags most about will be his biggest insecurities. If you know other things he might be insecure about or something that he would be ashamed as a man for lacking, let him know. Say, that he isn't doing enough or he doesn't have enough of those qualities for you. Also that you found someone else who has what he doesn't, is genuine and doesn't brag about it....and that's how you know you'd rather be with the "other" guy.|`|r1qAItRyaa	Well, honesty is always the best policy.  That may sound simple however, it can be quite tricky.  Often times, you must rely on a white lie as a sort of blanket statement over the breakup.  Simple inform him that you are, in fact, sleeping with another man who makes you more happy than he.  Not only will the breakup be clean, but he will be left feeling less of a man.  This method is full proof.  Make sure to include the details so that he is left with no question.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|2keIEMFUaa	The best way is to kill him with kindness, Keep cool and at like a real lady would.  With a big smile and don't forget to say thank you for teaching me what I have learned from this relationship and move on girl.

You can join some clubs or something fun outside of school to meet new people like a drama class or something like that. <br>  Don't be too desperate. Who knows you could meet a boy on the bus and then he might be your next boyfriend. <br>  <br>  Don't be sad. :]|`|jdah4ZA2aa	I get jealous of guys sometimes too ... its usually when I feel powerless and helpless.  Although it'll be great when you do find a guy, do things now that make you feel more confident and in charge of your life.  That could be anything from a makeover to learning a new hobby to writing poetry to playing sports, etc.|`|3RjT6INzaa	i sometimes wish i were a guy too, but u never get what u really want do u?
JYDzjudGaa	Just be relaxed. Laugh when you find something funny, smile and just enjoy yourself. Most importantly act like you would normally do. Be yourself. xxx|`|ouIZdXdaaa	like yourself|`|g2XbXYyraa	Like Will Smith in The Fresh Prince of Bel Air.<br>  <br>  like normal your retard, how the **** do you think you should act?|`|UGHVDspjaa	Confidence is a must, you need to feel nice about yourself but not too confident as it could come across as arrogance but men love a confident women that can hold a conversation|`|Qe95LNxYaa	be yourself do not act like a little kid act like adult mature person|`|vB0IP2Uyaa	normal be yourself
Ym90xu59aa	I think you're just apprehensive. And no, babysitting other children will not give you the same kind of experience. It is easy to hate other people's kids.     If anything, I think when you're around 45+, you'll regret not having any children.|`|wdKY8YYRaa	i don't know. babies often turn into infants.. ARE YOU READY FOR THAT STRESS?!?!?!    i don't think you are.      [epic fail.]|`|DxdQ3F1iaa	adopt a child|`|wfMC742Naa	Well, there is no middle ground, but maybe this will help...  You probably don't want kids because of time and expense and most of all (and this is the most important part) other people's kids are obnoxious!      I have seen many guys say that didn't like kids, and didn't want any because they didn't like their friends kids.  It is different with your own!!!!!!!   All of these guys who ended up having kids have loved it, and found it really rewarding!  In fact, a couple of them have 3 and 4 kids now.    I understand that this doesn't really help you in the short term, but perhaps it will help you see that it might not be so bad as you think.  You might even enjoy it! ;-)    Don't rush into it.  Take your time, warm up to the idea, and continue to talk it over with your wife.    Best of luck!|`|sY6ZI2Ooaa	There is a feeling of "complete" when a child is born, I understand it's hard to fathom right now but when you see your wife grow and feel the baby move it's a surreal feeling. Yes a child consumes a lot of time & money but just to look into the eyes of which you and your wife have created is just breath taking. I am a mother ~ & so it comes with great strength that I tell you there is no other experience between a husband and wife greater than a shared child. Is there no tradition, no gift that you were giving as a child that you would want to pass down to your child? If not, and your parents were so uninvolved in your life that you don't want to pass those gene's down to your child and be the parent you had... here is your chance to be the person you always wanted in your life. All I'm saying is think very hard & be open mined on why exactly you don't want kids, you might miss out on something that you can never get back ~|`|7q2vh3mtaa	Try babysitting. This seems like it would be a good way to show you kids. They are funny, and rewarding, but are a lot of hard work.  Do you like kids? some people hate kids until they have some of their own. Do you really want to deny your wife motherhood? Do you really want to deny yourself fatherhood?|`|2rXWZkbnaa	You need to go with what makes you happy. You should of talked about this before you got married. But if she wants to raise kids and you don't then i think you two need to break up. I know it will be hard but its not fair to her or you. Say you have the baby, then now you are going to regret this because you don't want the responsibility of a child or you could grow to love this child and be the best dad. But if you keep your wife from having kids then you will make her life miserable. Do you really want to do that to her. I think you are just nervous about a baby. You could grow to be a good dad. But if you really don't want the same thing that she does, then i think it would be best if you guys broke up. Or you could just get a puppy!
wdKY8YYRaa	you should dump the boyfriend and go for the "cute" guy on myspace.      most def.|`|wGrRvFePaa	If you already have a boyfriend, and are happy, don't question it. Don't wreck a good thing. Is he coming just to visit you? Does he know you have a boyfriend? I would bring your boyfriend along with you so he knows you are taken, and that he is just a friend.|`|q4V7Zi0Haa	Wait for him to come, if you like him more than your current boyfriend, then break up with your current boyfriend (unless you dont like long distance relationships)
b7bb85526b028b7f92b16c8204ed4012aa	sometimes the best thing we can do is actually doing nothing at all and this may be one of those times. Its understandable what you want to do but do you think him hearing from you is really going to make him feel any better? Any one entering a relationship with someone who just broke up with another knows very well this is the chance you take and it does happen. He will probably be hurt for awhile but will get over you soon and be alright. It sounds more like youre unsure of yourself now and want him to standby in case you break up again and hes no where to be found which in effect, is "killing"you. If I were you, Id only contact him if you truly want him back or just leave it alone. Just dont be too surprised if he wants nothing to do with you anymore. Good luck|`|NeTNnvSZaa	Your rebound guy?!?  How insensitive can you possibly be?  People aren't there for you to use and drop whenever you feel like it.  I hope karma slaps you in the @$$ someday.|`|ma6Re8B1aa	LEAVE THE POOR GUY ALONE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I think he's had enough of you???|`|OBCvewW2aa	Can't you facespace him or something?  I can't imagine it's too hard finding someone these days.|`|2ikZxzBfaa	Sounds like your afraid of being alone jumping back in forth as much as you do.You must like playing with guys hearts you sick mean person.Make your mind up and just stick with it geez woman.If I was your ex I would have dumped like last weeks newspaper.To answer you question you sound pretty selfish to me , I would say, back up and reflect on how many people you hurt through your rebounds.If I was REBOUND GUY i wouldn't engage in your games.You  deserve neither of them.
AA10369144	If he doesn't put any effort into it, then forget him don't try to change a man that doesn't want to change, obviously he is much older than you and he thinks differently and wants things that you wont offer or give him like sx, or maybe he thought that it would be easy to get into your pants once you started dating. You havent even been together that long stop now while your ahead and have a chance before you make a mistake.|`|yorfmfiBaa	Ditch this loser.
cWKAoUcSaa	i m confused !!!|`|Zn7NNavKaa	if the way he hurt you before was cheating, and he said he's sure he'll hurt you again it means he is still uncapable of being faithfull|`|x7VuHfHJaa	can u believe i have the same problem!! wow  but i just found someone else even though it hurts to be with someone and still have feelings for another guy..try listening to music its soothing!!
5iKRM21Xaa	Yeah I'm about the same. You probably don't wanna to anything too drastic, that you may regret later. You can find ways to integrate your clothes in with some newer ones to make them more fashion forwardd without getting rid of them all. Sometime hair dying is a little drastic and a huge change - maybe try highlights? (And be careful so you don't end up damaging it. [One girl at my school i swear she adds a new color evey week... I think she'll be bald by age 20]). <br>  <br>  And if you want to join a dance team, go for it! That's a great idea. Sometimes trying new things is a great way to break out of your shell some. (I recently joined my school's step team, and I'm so glad I did!)<br>  <br>  And if you talk to more people, make sure they're the right ones. Don't hang out with people who are completely different from you or would compromise your values, just because you think they'll make you cooler. That's probably not the path to happiness. Also, even if you just have a small group of friends who you are close to, that's fine. You can still be friendly with other people and be well liked, even if the whole world isn't your best friend. Besides, if everyone knows your business and you're that close to so many people, the "best friend' thing isn't really worth much. <br>  <br>  So if you wanna make some changes, go ahead. Just make sure you don't completely lose yourself in the process. I hope this helped and shed some light on things. Good luck =)|`|OhqMdODUaa	if your going to do sh!t like that,<br>  then you have to do it slowly for a long period of time. so you dont just randomly change from one person to someone else. you'll look pretty much look like a f*g in the process.
u31B8Ycjaa	i have the same problem as you!<br>  except my ex isnt making a family n all that<br>  but i think the harder you try to not think about<br>  her the more you do. just try not letting it get to you.<br>  i know you love her like i love him but just think you <br>  want the person you love to be happy rite? shes happy<br>  so just let it be. youll find someone you were meant<br>  to fall in love with n then everything good will fall into<br>  place. this probably didnt help much but i really cant<br>  think of anything else that would help. good luck tho.|`|DiSOdCFXaa	just try not to think about her at all
xhqKLSwCaa	ready to run by the dixie chicks<br>  more about running before the alter but still works|`|m7O5Nyx1aa	i'm interested to hear a song about that too, what you've described reminds me of someone I know =)
PSaXWJAMaa	wow thats a hard 1! well there is 2 things u can do, u can go and marry this guy, or tell him hes engaged and needs to get married to her...... just go with your heart, thats all u can do|`|j3tqW0XWaa	Talk to him.|`|oIZnPGYnaa	tell wour friend that she is about to make a big mistake. tell her how you feel about her and him. the truth will always set you free.if you don't you will be caught up in a real mess. pray and trust god for the answer.
5613b2f0e3965fc16a2ce3623c6c5a78aa	if i were you i would not even try to regain his stupid, immature, controling trust over such a stupid, email that nothing was meant by it but a friendly email. trust is a 2 way street for any relationship and sounds like your so called b/f has insecure issues with you. i would dump him as if hes this childish now what does the future hold in the long term for you.|`|cgytTEOZaa	i think he wana b single always . he dnt wna b ur bf thats y he is taking that mail as a reason of getting seprate...its just an excuse. dnt leave him evr. make him realize his misunderstanding nd show ur lv to him...|`|AA10798898	well it sounds to me like this guy jus doesnt wanna commitment.

W3u8qCbhaa	take your time. everything will be alright your young, dont<br>  think of anything that will hurt yourself.|`|gYuJUyvvaa	If you kill yourself you'll NEVER EVER have a boy friend.<br>  <br>  I'm 17 and never had a girl friend, so I kinda know what you're going though.<br>  <br>  Just wait, and try to stop masturbating or you'll only be looking for sex in a relationship because of your addiction.<br>  <br>  Hope it works out for you.|`|T4N6a7MQaa	No you don't contemplate suicide until after you've dated the guy for awhile and he leaves you. JUST KIDDING!  Change your attitude a little. Make it a goal to meet and go out with someone. Relationships can be a wonderful thing. Everyone deserves them. And stop the worry about masturbation. There are two kinds of people in this world concerning masturbation. Those who do and those who lie about it. You are still young as well. Make it your goal to find someone and just do it. Good luck dear!|`|93cAUCbWaa	I'm 19, never had a girlfriend. Don't need one, i've almost got 30k gamerscore. Steak Sauce!<br>  <br>  I've been suicidal, but then I realized it wasn't very fun, so I changed and became a gamer, it rocks!<br>  <br>  Just cheer up. This might sound very harsh, but the best thing to do is to stop feeling sorry for yourself, that's what drags you down the most.|`|W618lfZ6aa	I wouldn't worry about it too much, I stayed single for a reason. Dating young generally leads to so much heart break and I didn't want to deal with it.  Consider yourself lucky in that regards. <br>  <br>  I didn't have a girlfriend till I was 22, lasted 2 months, and I was right.. maturity wasn't there.<br>  <br>  I think you might just need to get yourself out there, meet guys.  Do sports, activities or school.  The right guy will come along and sweep you off your feet.  Chances are there's a guy who is crushing on you, but is too shy to ask, look around once in awhile see if there's a guy in class staring at you.<br>  <br>  Right now, I would focus on school or a career, your mind is clear of the relationship bs.  <br>  <br>  Good luck!
W3u8qCbhaa	just tak eit slow! it is part of dating|`|xwNgEhKCaa	she probably likes you and is scared
Rn7zkS52aa	Run, run, run, run runnnnn in the other direction please. Not only is this totally unhealthy and an abusive relationship in many ways, there is also a CHILD involved. Whether you realize it or not, this child is effected by what is going on. Children are very good at picking up on situations, even if they are young. If you stay in this environment, it can really effect what kind of man your son becomes. <br>  <br>  Your boyfriend is not going to change anytime soon, especially because he doesn't seem interested to. You need to get out now before it gets any worse.|`|R0U4qy6haa	you have given enough of yourself and your time and effort-time to move on-he has proven himself to you already-he is not going to change
Qch1ClsUaa	It sounds like now that you have a life plan, you've both become complacent in the relationship. He's stopped making efforts to make you feel special (V-day), and you're beginning to let the little things bother you (everything except drinking, which can be a serious  issue, especially if he is prone to depression). I would suggest rediscovering the things and traits that attracted you to him in the first place, whether it be music, movies, activities. Don't forget to take time to spend together even if it has to be scheduled in. Lastly guys like to feel appreciated to, so forget to give him a kind word every now and again. Hopefully he'll get the hint and reciprocate.<br>  <br>  Now that this has become a long-term relationship, the game changes and take a little more effort to keep each other interested and attracted. <br>  <br>  I wish you all the best, goodluck|`|5PC8nZubaa	okey hun,hang in there,its not that big but I know how u must feel.<br>  <br>  so here try to do this and I hope everything will be fine :<br>  take time to calm down and try not to make a big deal out of everything, talk to him about the drinking ,if it bothers you then it must be a problem,tell him that you are afraind and worried about his helth , about v-day he shouldent have said that, I mean your the party! lol <br>  if he said anything like that joke about it,or flirt with yourself ,I feel it sometimes helps.<br>  <br>  as for the things that bothers you,the little things,you can tease him about it,that way you wont make a big deal about it when you try to say that it bothers you.<br>  <br>  and about you falling out of love with him,you need to go hang out for sometime with your friends ,do some fun stuff together (girls only would be better) and then when you go home you will be happy and it wont matter .plus after some time it will be easyer for you to be arownd him,what you are having is not falling out of love but its just the part between the waves,cus u know love is a crazy thing,some times its up and other times its down,so dont worry about it alot and enjoy it while you can,lol u wont be thinking about him all the time and stuff like that,and u could use that,try doing your stuff,that way you will keep the balance <br>  <br>  and dont worry ,be happy ;)<br>  <br>  I hope I helped<br>  good luck<br>  xoxo
AdeD0xMuaa	I hope she breaks up with you. You are hanging out with your ex and you told your gf she can't come? And she cancelled her plans to appease you?<br>  I hope this is a joke..|`|AA10622097	Then she is not really your girlfriend.|`|iRhxDwZ9aa	You really need to think about this, if you wan t a girlfriend or not in your life because after this she may break it off. That is a good thing that your girlfriend wants to meet your friend because other would not care and plus your ex-girl is going to be there it may seem like your hiding her or something to her... So you should take her to meet your friends and get a good relationship with them all then all of you guys can hang out and it not be weird|`|c9170bd63a22e0f46822769c350e867faa	obviously you aren't in this relationship 100% - if you were, you wouldn't have any issues with showing off your new girlfriend to your "buddies" -- if it was just hanging out with the guys, it would be different - because other  women will be there, she has every right to bug the heck out of you about it - take her, have a few drinks - the night might end up in a better spot for you if you take her --- and you'll get a ton of brownie points|`|e9dHHGCSaa	You should let her come anyway. She gave up something for you, so you need to return the favor. Unless you have something to hide, of course.<br>  <br>  If you don't, don't be surprised when, not if, she breaks up with you. Hopefully you make the right choice.|`|rO8P0NH3aa	www.goaskcarla.com|`|IuJcKGroaa	We'll first off your an asshole!

wW6NJk4jaa	i would be kind of upset too, she is probably just nervous about your ex being there, just reassure her that you have no feelings for your ex, maybe she'll chill out?
X9I8lAQ8aa	jesus.... He started with the negative comments but you were both at fault for winding each other up. If i was you i would find someone else , that is no way to treat you.  <br>  If you want to stay with him , the best way to get back on track is make him realise what hes missing . You seem to spend to much time together so have little to talk about . <br>  <br>  i would<br>  <br>  Delete his number , and write it on a peice of paper ... after that arguement he has to contact you first (in case of emergency) , HE was out of order more than you <br>  <br>  Next time you see him , sit him down and say how much it upset u, n that if he doest stop being negative about talking to you , you see nothing wrong with finding someone who is treats u right.<br>  <br>  The main thing is act aloof , by the convo he is insinuating you are clingy , you have to let him know the arguement was out of order with out pestering . mean it !<br>  <br>  Finally dont confront him over text .. he just wont reply! x x x x x good luck hun! x x x|`|rO8P0NH3aa	www.goaskcarla.com|`|dpOJwPJbaa	Jesus H.

93cAUCbWaa	Since you say you love a girl, i'd say you're bisexual.<br>  <br>  Just don't tell her you are into boys and it will be fine.<br>  <br>  By the way, you say you are 14 years old. There is no way in hell you can be sure if you are gay or not. Wait and see.|`|ZjM0ghSnaa	If you "like" boys, then you are gay.|`|ruczpWrGaa	If your gay or bi or whatever, its not a bad thing. dont force yourself to be hetero.  My ex husband did that and he was always angry, never happy.
OMNmsezraa	I would say that would be different to every person. If you are attracted to them, go for it! I'm a 2nd Gen. American of German descent whose girlfriend is South Korean. One really can't get any more westernized than that. If you are really attracted to him or her, give it a shot!
2MVG5StDaa	I've been carried by a girl before.  Didn't turn me on in the least bit.|`|GHnkKwl3aa	Yeah, I've picked up a guy before (I'm pretty petite so it was a big shock).<br>  <br>  I've given guys piggy back rides, and I've picked up guys (in basketball) and put them behind me to get to the ball.<br>  <br>  It's really funny to see people's reactions when a tiny girl picks up a guy. xD|`|RXe4guclaa	wait was this just like, while you were hanging out? or like, in the bedroom..?
Gb8cl8n2aa	he is a jerk..he is not at all in to you...your hunch is right..
yJZeRu5Vaa	yeah because if you obsess over it hes going to get annoyed with you.<br>  just happened with me and my guy yesterday haha|`|Fe9isgq0aa	Tell him how you feel and if you don't want the boyfriend title then leave him a lone, sorry but he might feel like hey i like this girl and i know she likes me but um she doesn't want the title as my gf so ill back off and try talking to this other girl. you can play games with your emotions it just doesn't work that easy i wish it did tho|`|7xnMr6zVaa	he can do anything he want because his not ur boy so he can date any one he want because ur like him as a boyfriend...if jealous he doing that then be his gf and he will stop doing all the stuff he doing stuff because he want to see if u get jealous and he want to know if u don't like him or if  u do u....|`|e9dHHGCSaa	If you don't have the relationship title, he can do whatever he wants. There is no binding line there, so unless you're in a relationship, you can't do much. it's his choice.|`|Di6FAQxRaa	Yeah just look elsewhere, leave him alone, y is he sleeping at her house. He probably boned her too.|`|2MVG5StDaa	Get looking girl.|`|HwcQYXxoaa	Yeah..  If you don't want a relationship "status" with this guy, you can' really expect him to only date you.<br>  <br>  I would start to date another guy and give him a dose of his own medicine, and watch him become jealous.
inUxZ7Xcaa	The best thing to do is sit her down and talk to her about it. If she doesn't tell the truth then bribe her. :p JK. Just follow what your heart says. Good Luck. and make sure you get the girl but thats if you really love her!\<br>  xxx|`|2MVG5StDaa	Sit down and tell her how you feel.  See if the two of you can arrive at some type of agreement where it pertains to seeing more of each other.  Sometimes it takes women quite awhile to decide what it is exactly they are searching for in a relationship.|`|CWrIAHQhaa	Mate that's tough.<br>  <br>  All you can do is give her time.<br>  <br>  But be careful. When a girl say's she needs to figure some **** out...well there's something going on.<br>  <br>  Firstly look after yourself. And don't take any bullsh*t. Once the lying starts your doomed.<br>  <br>  Good luck 2 u
xJBJn6dOaa	Well, who is the girl? Have you been dating for over a month? I wouldn't worry about it... she is interested in just you at this point.<br>  <br>  Is this the 1st-3rd time you are meeting her? I'd go alone and not with your friend.|`|a1iam8Zvaa	nooooo<br>  <br>  my ex bf brang his friend to hang out with me for the first time officialy bf and gf<br>  he was hotter than my bf<br>  and i kinda got into his friend<br>  so dont bring ur good looking friend lol|`|wMunBQ9Oaa	Hellll, Nawww!  That would be sexacide, not suicide!  You'd be throwing all chances of having sex with her aside to your friend, hence my word "sexacide."  She'd be eyeballing your friend and getting pissed at your being in the way of her getting with him.  She'd be having mental sex just imagining herself fukkking your friend!  Again, hellll naw!!!!|`|OHfZFR31aa	Whose to say who looks better. Everyone has different taste. But if you are going to meet a girl, why do you want another guy around?|`|WO3dtNB5aa	ehh i wouldn't---unless he has a bad personality.
VAI6MtPIaa	What was the fight about? You obviously feel that you are wrong and that is the reason you want to say sorry about it. You should take her out to dinner, or go somewhere with her and ask her to talk. Start out by saying you are sorry for what you said and explain to her why you were arguing with her. It might help. That's what I do with my mom. When we fight I always go out with her somewhere and have a chat with her. If she fights with me.. it's the same. =)|`|58005ca2aa97cde7abd291c8e309aaf0aa	Though the question is not related to Single and Dating but you seems sincere, so i would say.. cool off, help her, i agree.. i tend to wash the dishes and do chores more after fight with my mom, well who hasn't? ;)|`|lnp9w4xfaa	now now, ive been in TONS of fights with my mom.<br>  <br>  You need to calm down... take deep breaths, and if you need to cry, go ahead and do it :D crying is good.<br>  <br>  Just wait a while until she's calmed down too, by the time you're fully calm she should be okay. And when that times comes, you should walk up to her, and tell her you're sorry and you feel horrible for fighting with her. Give her a hug and hopefully everything will be okay. And remember, girls (haha i should know) take a while to chill out and forgive someone. So if she takes your apology but doesnt seem like she takes it, well, just give her some time. Because you gave her your apology and so then you just give her some space, and she'll come to fully accept it. Trust me.<br>  <br>  hope i helped|`|828e8681c299a009930f6174f5138b49aa	I'd still do it right away but back it up with an explanation for why you are sorry (i.e. so she knows you mean it / put some thought into it). If she was right,too, admit it and tell her why you realize she is right.<br>  <br>  What kind of cheesy things - like giving her a kiss on the cheek or a hug? If you aren't usually affectionate towards her, she might still appreciate those gestures.<br>  <br>  Next time, think before you lash out (since you say this isn't the first time this has happened).|`|HFn8M2KDaa	well whenever im in trouble from my mother i start doing the dishes,cleaning the living romm, cleaning the bathroom...after she seen all that you've donr for her..go up to her & give her a warm hug! & say,"im sorry mom..i hope you can forgive me.."|`|2MVG5StDaa	give it four or five hours til she cools off then go to her and ask her to talk about what happened then apologize.
Gb8cl8n2aa	you are just 15..of course its not right for you if you get pregnant..get some adults help on this issue..|`|a1iam8Zvaa	dont be ashamed of yourself<br>  your only human!<br>  you learn from mistakes<br>  so just put it behind you <br>  and dont tell anyone|`|4qT0TfMZaa	You screwed up, girl.  You turn up pregnant, he's going to jail!|`|tRNxT55caa	who are we to tell you whether or not you should be ashamed of yourself? do you feel ashamed? if not, then let it go. yes, you are young, but having sex is a choice you made. I am assuming you didn't use a condom since you are unsure about whether or not you are pregnant. If you are going to have sex at 15, please use protection, maybe talk with your mother about birth control. Be smart about it and ALWAYS think of the consequences of your actions. take care.|`|W618lfZ6aa	Question is do you feel ashamed? It's all about you and no one else. I feel 15 y/o is too young...<br>  <br>  He will probably want it again, do you care about him deeply? How long did you guys date? <br>  <br>  If you guys do it again, he should be using a condom.|`|lO6zgftaaa	As long as you know the guy and used a condom you shouldn't be ashamed just a bit gutted that you lost your virginity ..<br>  <br>  And whats done is done don't feel ashamed just carry on with life :)<br>  <br>  Don't worry :)
p0ioXUM2aa	its over as a normal relationship so I say try and remain friends but both move on, staying together will probably lead to arguments and frustrations that will spoil what you had - good luck|`|2c89cd9f9d087548a3d65a53e0d5756baa	Welcome to the real world. That is what happens when the real world kicks in after the romance phase has passed. You might look for a relationship with sparkle but it will end up the same way. Sparkle only lasts for so long.|`|7i6qj4OXaa	Do you really imagine that excitement can last forever?  Your relationship sounds good to me, you just need to talk to each other.|`|iqZUd5Fdaa	It is time to move on. Not because the spark has gone, that's always just an excuse, be honest with yourself and to him, the real reason is that you just don't have feelings for him in the same way anymore. If there was a future, there'd be no doubt in your mind, you'd still want to be with him even if the initial spark has faded, because, thats what you do when you love someone, it doesnt matter if the spark is gone, you're with them and thats all that matters. So if you want out, then the love has moved on, and no amount of working through it will get it back|`|tZIjts6iaa	This is a normal phase in a relationship. I've been in one for 8 years. Let him know how you feel and both of you make an effort to do something that doesn't include just sex, but intimacy. Like Write him notes, kiss for at least 10 seconds and don't do anything else. Try to hold off from the sex and see if the romance doesn't return.|`|2618b27ee1b1bc95bede9c4c3e930725aa	If you are stuck in a routine, make some changes, don't just give up so easily! Do something totally spontaneus, buy some naughty stuff, get some games for you both to try out, make an effort, do things you have never done before and you can make it so much better, he probably feels exactly the same right now, go organise something mad and surprise him! xxx|`|5eIhjnNfaa	I would sit down and have a talk about where you two are at, as far as the relationship goes. <br>  He sounds like a keeper..<br>  Passion fades. More often than not, unfortunately.<br>  Just remember what you two have had, what makes you love him. Try to work on your relationship & put more energy into it. <br>  Try to get that spark back.|`|3TCZtajKaa	Stay together and make it work. you obviousily have love for each other or you wouldnt still be together. It easy to give up but then what do you do when the next relationship your in is the same. I think maybe you just need to bring back sum fire in to the relationship, go on holiday or, book a room or somthing but dont give up. Hope this help and gud luck x|`|pM4OJ4iwaa	That kinda happened to me so i broke up with him and i havnt really regretted it appart from the fact that he still like me alot so he was really depressed so it depends on how you both really feel.|`|v1uNUcwCaa	well all relationships get less exciting the longer they last but if you dont fancy him and he doesnt fancy you you are best to split up and move on|`|Rzm20vLlaa	It is normal for a relationship to progress this way. Because, in the beginning, the "in-love" way you feel is due to oxytocin, and endorphines. These brain chemicals are in our bodies for a reason - to make sure that we procreate and keep the species going. They make us feel wonderful and in love and make the world look beautiful.<br>  <br>  When these chemicals wear off, which they do in about 1 - 4 years, many people are left wondering if they are still "in love" with each other.<br>  <br>  A strong relationship foundation will help to not have the relationship faulter when the feel-good chemicals wear off.<br>  <br>  It sounds like you miss the feel-good sparkle chemicals that the relationship had when it was new....<br>  <br>  Only you know if you want to keep the relationship going.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|WAEDIWz8aa	hmmmmm u hv to talk it with him, see what he thinks. if ure both feel like ure not lovers any more. whats the point??? ure just using each other for pleasure.<br>  <br>  i believe in ever lasting love.<br>  <br>  ask this question to urself.... do you imagine urself living with him for the next 20 years??? if u think that its gonna be boring and there is no spark in ur life. please move on.|`|XXbZAriNaa	if the sex is good then stay
WO3dtNB5aa	both. you should focus on having a good time now, and how it will effect your future. but don't stress yourself out about the big picture and your future.|`|AdeD0xMuaa	Both I guess.|`|828e8681c299a009930f6174f5138b49aa	Both. <br>  <br>  When things are rough in the present moment, think of the big picture (i.e. this, too, shall pass away).<br>  <br>  When things are good in the present moment, focus on the now & enjoy it (for tomorrow may not come).
CxVjw6XDaa	If you think he likes you back or if you just want to put it out there you can just IM him and just get to the point that you like him.<br>  <br>  If you dont want to tell him immediately then start a conversation in person. You could also start a chat room with you, your crush, and your friend or you could just say to your crush that your friend gave you his screen name and you just felt like talking.<br>  Just remember that you shouldnt fear rejection because he is a human just like you and he shouldnt have the power to make you feel bad.|`|B7srI5Mwaa	I have that problem but i usually just put hi im bored and your bthe only person online and start like that or i say stuff like how do you do the homework or stuff like that|`|HFxk3OuTaa	Well not yet. You have to have a casual converstration with him first.<br>  <br>  Welll since you have an inside source<br>  Like when you see your friend talking to him<br>  Go up to them and talk casuallly.<br>  <br>  Then you can IM him!
VXQFT341aa	Well if he likes you and thinks the world of you then he will miss you.|`|jslbu4Isaa	the only way to do that would be to go away and not talk to him for a while but why would you want to that it will hurt him from missing you too much i know cause my gf used to do this to me it sux just don't do it eventually i broke up with her|`|Dnrfo0bnaa	When you stop focusing on them, and focus more attention on yourself, they will notice you.  Then don't just run to them at first call, give them time to appreciate you then they'll start missing you.  It's psychology.
U3tZzGlgaa	The next time you see him, say, "Hi ____ !"  When you use his name all the time, it let's him know that you took the effort to remember him.  It has a bigger impact when you don't use other guys' first names when you say hi to them.  Doing little things only for him will make him realize that you're treating him special and give him the confidence to ask you out if he's interested.  At the very least, you'll make him think about you and how you feel about him.  What's important here is that you don't do the same things for other guys while pursuing him, otherwise it will give him the message that you're just a flirt.  Whenever I had a girl flirt with me, I started getting interested.  But as soon as I saw her flirting with someone else too, I lost interest.  My wife only flirted with me when she caught my eye.  I did the same with her.|`|tvWm1e4naa	just be nice to him and friendly. if he really likes you, he'll tell you.<br>  if he doesn't say anything, just take it as it is and don't assume and look for someone else who can say it to you. shy girls and guys don't  really work.<br>  you might end up waiting for something that's not going to happen coz some aggressive girls will snatch him. either you do your part or he does his part. goodluck.|`|sCCjAKllaa	You can't. If you're shy as well, you're no different then him. You need to at least try or risk never gettin anywhere with the guy at all.|`|ju5hVva8aa	if ur both shy, then jus like do small talk... but dnt make it uncomforatable... especially 4 him... jus keep it simple. saying "hey" or "whats up" or compliment him on anything u can. <br>  jus try not 2 make it awkward.. and once he warms up 2 u... then he'll start talking 2 u.. =]]].<br>  good luckk !|`|uzZuwtgXaa	Oh yes you can!!  He will like that go on what you waiting for?|`|helbMXn3aa	just try to talk with him about somthing Casual. : ] (good luck)|`|9J9bdLmxaa	Just go and start talking to him. If you guys have somethings in common then maybe he will feel like opening up. On the other hand he may be in a relationship and unable to pursue you. In any case the only way you will find out is if you do some small talk.|`|sEsL6P29aa	Why dont u make it straight forward n tell him u like him.... the best idea relly :D
ehMPOlefaa	Watc.h 'Love Actually' and follow the actions of the one guy in a similar position to you.  He rectifies in an a totally decent way|`|8QhPUxllaa	Don't do it!  How would you feel if he stole the girl of your dreams? Eh not so nice then!  I know this through experience.  I "stole" my best friends guy off her (he dumped her and went out with me the week after) and that totally ruined our friendship!  I can hardly look her in the eye now or talk to her as i did before.  It didn't even last long!  Believe me it is SO not worth it! I think found the perfect guy and she did the same thing to me but just a little more tackfully.  <br>  Sometimes you just have to swallow your own wishes and desires and think about your friend.  Which is more important, your friend and his happiness or you getting off with his girl?|`|cmfBO9cXaa	if your serious. . tell her- NOT HIM<br>  see what she says and make it clear you dont want it to become awkward!<br>  if she wants the same . let her break up with your best friend, then tell him that you are going to start going out with her!<br>  DONT ASK. . he wont mind as much if he isnt going out with her at the time and if he is a guy he wont let on he cares, even if he does- so its all good for you that way. . just dont cheat on him no matter what!<br>  <br>  xx|`|SHanivxvaa	My friend what i can tell you i learned from my life is what goes around always comes back around you do that i guarantee it will happen to you one day maybe not in the same way but it will trust me|`|RTCKiu03aa	whats more important your best mate or this girl experience tells me my best mate would come first or you could have the girl and no mates|`|fox5a3ePaa	hands off if you wanna keep your best friend|`|i4bjQbPcaa	Don't do anything, you will lose two friends over this.  Firstly your best friend will find out and kick your bum for it.  Secondly this girl will probably reject you and then think you are a prick for even trying anything.<br>  <br>  Or she might like you too, but will you ever be able to trust her if she does something with you?|`|3QpGoToWaa	Take her from him
fULZei1haa	she's trying to look like a big shot?<br>  <br>  or maybe one of her bf's friends was there and she wanted word to get back to him that she was on a date and make him jealous?|`|RnFpjFODaa	sounds like a psycho|`|uAw2ebLNaa	Nothing. Don't think too deeply into it. She has a boyfriend. If she is fliriting with you ignore her because if you get too deep into it, you will be setting yourself up for drama. I think you should let her know that her behavior is crossing the line a little. Please do not get caught up, it's not worth it.|`|IzPCsjXoaa	errr dont nooo!!
RWA0hLlOaa	There is nothing you can do<br>  <br>  If you've been together 2 years and he still has these issues, he is always going to have these issues.<br>  <br>  It's not you it's him.|`|W618lfZ6aa	That's tough, problem is your attitude could change once you are away at college.  But if you strongly believe you won't then good job, there's nothing he can do about you going away to school so he just needs to suck it up.<br>  <br>  He needs confidence in himself, compliment him every way you can and just love him.  That's all you can do.|`|axCFlk5Zaa	There isn't much you can do except try and make him feel like he is good enough for you. Insecurities in guys are a hard thing to fix, but it shows that he cares about you very much. It is basically a fear of losing you too someone else. <br>  <br>  Most guys do this when they love a girl, it will pass through more time and commitment to the relationship. <br>  <br>  Guys have this fear more commonly now because relationships end sooner and sooner. Serious relationships are a very rare thing, as most people are looking for a fling. <br>  <br>  Also, adultery is on a serious rise in America, as cheating is becoming extremely common in relationships.|`|mF0L5jMNaa	Jealousy is such a destructive emotion.  Tell him you will never cheat on him that if you are going out with another guy you will break up with him beforehand.  And do that!  If you find yourself attracted to another guy, you aren't in love.
ehMPOlefaa	no way for me to tell you.  despite all the details you've given it all feels superficial and i can't feel for what he (or you) are really like|`|sCCjAKllaa	He's really interested in you. If someone is that persistent, then it can't be read any other way. He wants you be with you, but it's up to you to give him a chance.|`|DybOqfGpaa	he really wana marry u
J9OUW7JRaa	its hard to tell but i would just try to talk to him more, but if he still acts like hes not interested then he probably isn't, so you should just find someone better who likes you alot more than he does :)|`|3RjT6INzaa	it sounds like he's interested in u. maybe he wants to move to the next level, but he's probly not sure if u like him back that much. give him an obvious hint.|`|1S9ZKgqVaa	I think you just have to break the ice, he might like you but doesn't know how to express it.<br>  Just try to be confident around him and try to talk to him or hang out with him alone.
pmkdQKEvaa	it depends i mean some people say it all the time i use it if i like them not just friends, more than friends to tell them also because it sounds nice..sweet|`|zYQtUuzmaa	It really depends on the individual. Personally, I don't call anyone babe unless i'm in a relationship with them. But others sometimes call anyone babe as a friendly term.<br>  <br>  If a girl you like has been calling you babe just see if she calls any other men babe. If not then she might like you.|`|2618b27ee1b1bc95bede9c4c3e930725aa	It's just a general term of affection babe, that's all, we girlies like to put people at ease and be nice to folk, well most of us anyway xxx|`|VlTGV9DUaa	it depends on the person, i usually do it if i like someone or im datin them<br>  <br>  but ALOT of girls round here (UK Essex) call everyone any sex babe!|`|iAdRYpLEaa	When they like the guy, or sometimes I say it to my guy mates to take the piss aha, but she probably likes you.|`|IeeaLYubaa	usually its just friendly. unlessu dating the person than it to show a slight care.|`|aLLmgGYlaa	i would never use the word babe to a male friend. would use hun but not babe. my bf had a text from another girl saying hi babe and i new he was cheating
tZIjts6iaa	It seems like you need to learn how to not take people for granted. The people you care about are in your life for a reason. Think about how you would feel if all these people went away and you had to start all over with new friendships and relationships. How would you feel? Treat your loved ones with kindness and the way you would want to be treated. You wouldn't want anyone you care about to make you feel like you were disposable, so don't do it. Put yourself in their shoes.|`|9c16f104f9589fa27971d779def0ac39aa	Because you're afraid to open yourself up.. be vulnerable enough that you could get hurt yourself, your heart is on the line.<br>  <br>  I think it's going to have to take that exact incident to happen though, someone breaking your heart, for you to fully realize how putting walls up only pushes away the people you hold dear.|`|3RjT6INzaa	just becuz people fight doesn't mean there's no love. u just have to remind urself what life would be like without that person u love so much, and never take them for granted.|`|x7CmpR6baa	Maybe you push people away because you don't want to get hurt, so you hurt other first before they hurt you.<br>  Relax a bit you seem really tense and stressed about this.<br>  Tell her how you feel and that you love her, and she may understand.
c5b488ff1d027aa50957b02bc976c5bcaa	No, you're just an immature little girl with no perspective on what is important in life. Consider working hard in school and/or getting a job to help support your family.|`|W618lfZ6aa	Could be, either way nothing wrong with it.<br>  <br>  You might just like kissing in general, sex is a different story.|`|JCdBSULraa	Depends on if you like licking girls' vaginas and the tastes of their juices.

I don't think I would even ask a guy to be my boyfriend.|`|3OeE8kMQaa	I'd propose, why not? It's the 21st century not the 50s.
b0dcd6166a4d23808f005f22bbd7a873aa	I think they are very shapely, lol I'm very sorry but I dont think they look quite right, because we are used to seeing blokes wear baggier clothing, it dosn't tend to suite them. Very sorry, but if him and you are ok with them, then don't listen to other people.x|`|RvFwmQOPaa	Sorry, I'm not trying to be mean but they really look gay!

u1ZWdTnLaa	if this guy is a flirt..he will flirt around with all your friends..he'll be sweet..extra nice..very polite..and will flatter all of them..<br>  <br>  if he is really a flirt..then he will surely flirt around online..!<br>  <br>  there are many good people out there for you dear..dont date him if he flirts around..in the end..you will lose everyting...and it wont even matter to him..believe me..he did it to me..i trusted him all the while..but in the end>>>>>>> it doesnt even matter!!!!!!!!

Give him a few days.|`|kERP7zAhaa	phone time varies from guy to guy. you can call him in a couple days if you have his number, maybe you should ask him to do something.|`|BiRujg8Baa	Wait a few more days if he don't call u should and c how's everything goin with him|`|ghtRbCdnaa	well.. i dont know. june is in 4 months. its easy for him to ask u on a sort of dat in 4 months cause this way he doesnt have to say that he doesnt like u, but he can surely avoid u.. i dont knw.. i think 3 days is the max u should w8 for a call.. and well.. if someone reeeaaally likes u, they call u the same day or the latest the day after.|`|xHqqZEXNaa	Call him. I dont know if you girls think that you calling us is desperate and weird, because its not. Just do it and if he really likes you he'll be glad to hear from you|`|3vxEXXeUaa	if he had a good time he will for sure call some people wait like 2 days to call others might wait a lil longer they dont want to seem to anxious..but dont worry :)|`|eXpZD0vlaa	In a day or so, text him something innocent about the flatmate, preferably something like "I saw <flatmate> and her boyfriend, they said hi." so he doesn't think flatmate likes him.

If nothing, the guy's a dud.|`|cOBsDBgqaa	he will call<br>  you are not the only one with a life <br>  he may be busy<br>  just dont worry about it...<br>  if he doesnt call in a few more days call hima nd say that some of your friends and you are going to a movie and you wanted to know if he will go|`|io1cRt87aa	just call him where does it say dont call?<br>  <br>  also he could be just using you for that other girl....|`|UAuSVBelaa	I would leave it another few days.

Text him.|`|zBAB2QVJaa	why wait ,waiting will get you no where,get out and about and start looking for others see you chick|`|mPuBm8Hxaa	The date's already over.  You may call, but just don't harass him.  ONE call and ONE call only.  Any more than that and you'll probably scare him.  And if he likes you he will call you.  If he likes you and is interested he wouldn't forget to call you.<br>  <br>  Remember the book "He's just not that into you" --it talks about common sense stuff.  And really, it sucks for us females in this world b/c we shouldn't chase any guys. In fact, we stand around and let the guys chase us.  From there on we have our options.<br>  <br>  You can't force someone to like you, so always be prepared for that.  And if that is the case, respect that.  Be mature about it and move on.
dcf4c1dec6ae1f9fba85b09be4c45028aa	Prove it = have sex with me.  The guy is a pig.  You are right, you shouldn't have to prove anything to him.  By the way, why do you love this guy?  He sounds very self-centered.  You don't need that.

That seems a bit mean, he should be so lucky to speak to you!

A girl should never give too much away!!! <br>  Tell him that the only proof you have is that, you know you love him because when you're with him, you feel complete... <br>  A little cheesy huh...lol!|`|BxD6bUizaa	Show him your boobs. Boobs heal anything.<br>  <br>  No, but you can do is cuddle up with him when it's cold. Purposely forget your jacket so he has to get closer to you.

Because that might play a big part in her reasoning. I think the best thing for your friend to do is to wait. She clearly stated that she doesn't think she's ready to have a relationship and so he should honor her wishes. Tell him to just stay neutral as friends and that if during the trial of time they're still friends, she will take note of this and eventually become romantically interested. Do however tell him that losing interest in her just because she won't date him only reinforces her reasoning as to why she won't date him in the first place.|`|7oMjnyycaa	maybe she really never had any one to talk  and probable has no ben asked out allot, my suggestion is to your friend, that he should go with her to the library and check out what she reads and try to get into her interests.

CkN4pgpCaa	Take it to a seamstress ASAP and ask for a bustle. Every bride that I've known has done this for the reception.  A bustle is a way of sort of gathering the train in the back and attaching it to your dress so it doesn't drag. There's usually a couple of different ways to do them, depending on the dress.  She'll put in some hook and eyes or other fasteners on the back of the dress, but they won't be visible unless you are up really close.  After the ceremony, a bridesmaid or your mother can help you bustle the dress.  Have a bridesmaid or your mother go with you when the pick up the dress so the seamstress can show them how to do it... you won't be able to help since you will be in the dress.  You can probably find a seamstress that can do it in a week, but I suggest you get moving!|`|aipChC3haa	A lot of brides also go through this delima.<br>  What they do, is wear the wedding dress during the actual ceremony, and then change into something cute and shorter for the reception when you PAR-TAY!<br>  <br>  By the way, CONGRATS!<br>  Are you nervous?<br>  <br>  BTW:  The shorter thing should still be white and kinda traditional, just easier to dance in.<br>  <br>  If you don't want to get a new dress, you can get it bustled?<br>  A lot of brides do that.|`|ae52cc9fbf40f195da2c44ba1bb751d9aa	So....I know you said you are getting married next week but if I were you I would try to find somewhere that will put a bustle on your dress for you.  Maybe the place you bought your dress does this??  <br>  A seamstress in your hometown would be able to do this as well.  They just put about 4 small white buttons on the lower back of your dress and then four small loops of thread on the bottom of your dress so that you can pull it up to be one length for dancing.  <br>  The place I bought my dress is bustling it for free so I am not aware of what this would cost somewhere else.  I would try and find someone quickly though, because it will make the entire night a lot easier for you!!<br>  Congrats by the way and I hope you have the time of your life on your big day!!!|`|bCWrZpvCaa	Dont stress-very easy fix. You dont need to get another dress. Take it to a tailor. My mother and MIL both had a dress with a little train on it. The tailor can put a little hook underneath the dress that way after the ceremony you can hook it up for the reception (like a small bussle). It looks pretty too!<br>  <br>  Good Luck! Congrats!!!!|`|O3iRGQ6Kaa	There is no bustle on the dress? If not, take it to a professional tailor or seamstress and they'll do it for you. It's not that expensive, probably around $40.|`|K119R72Caa	get it hemmed|`|lgxE5nUoaa	Most wedding gowns can be pinned up in the back so they are capable of being danced in.  For all the money brides pay for that one-time wear dress, I would wear it all night long.  I've been to a wedding where the bride changed mid-reception and I thought it was beyond tacky.  Please don't go that route, make the most of your beautiful gown!|`|LAXbJfvwaa	There are three options;<br>  <br>  1.  Buy a shorter dress to dance in.  (I wouldn't personally do this due to the cost and also due to the fact that I would want to wear the wedding dress for as long as I possibly could!)<br>  <a href="http://www.bride.net/2008/short-and-sweet-dresses-for-the-unconventional-bride/" rel="nofollow">http://www.bride.net/2008/short-and-swee...</a><br>  <br>  2.  Bustle it.  Any seamstress will be able to show you different bustles and show you how to button/tie the train up on the back of your dress to keep it out of the way.  This is very common these days.<br>  <a href="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v107/swingkitten9/wedding/2007_01060047.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v107/s...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.blogcdn.com/www.aisledash.com/media/2008/07/bustle.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.blogcdn.com/www.aisledash.com...</a><br>  <br>  3.  Add a loop on the back to go over your hand.  I did this for my wedding as I loved the romantic look it gives with the material drapped up.  It keeps it out of the way but shows off that you have a train on the dress.  Some people find it annoying to be 'carrying' it around all night but it didn't make a difference to me - it just hangs off your wrist so it wasn't much different than a bustle as far as I was concerned.  Mind you - if the train is not long then this might not work as it could end up pulling your skirt up too far so you can see the underlining!<br>  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/25906286@N04/2449807167/" rel="nofollow">http://www.flickr.com/photos/25906286@N0...</a>|`|FpwRrOwxaa	Wear the dress for the ceremony and then change into another pretty dress that's shorter. Hope you have a nice party.<br>  <br>  By the way CONGRATULATIONS! <br>  Are you scared? No need to be.<br>  <br>  Hope you have a good time!|`|YsiJiOqXaa	See if you can find a seamstress that can put a bustle on it in a week. they aren't hard. Then it will stay up.|`|UUQXNhMtaa	They bustle them at bridal stores.|`|8p31dENPaa	You should've had it bussled.
XsLj9jERaa	This sounds like my case lol. I had a lot of bad experiences with my physical appearance as a kid...so I go through constant phases where I think I'm ugly and unworthy of my boyfriend. <br>  What would fix her selfesteem would be to surprise her by taking her to the mall, getting her hair and nails done...giving her a massage, and getting her some nice new clothes and stuff...make her feel beautiful...end off the date with a piece of jewlery (if you can afford it) or a really cute stuffed animal and tell her that although the stuffed animal is cute, she's always the cutest and after getting her hair done etc, she looks even cuter than before and you didn't think it was possible that she could be even MORE gorgeous. <br>  yea...I would personally like that XD For me, feeling better about my looks only is solved through doing stuff to make myself feel prettier through...literally getting my hair done etc.<br>  Good luck and you sound like a great guy! :D|`|Cn1JFEBaaa	if your willing to go to the max<br>  <br>  pay some of your friends<br>  to smack her ***<br>  or get them to check her out<br>  and what not<br>  tell your guy friends to say she is pretty and what not<br>  maybe some rude comments|`|AA10988719	Well, I am sorry to say that she needs to be the one to do the work on this and you can be supportive to her; but there probably isn't anything you can do yourself to make the change in her.  Self esteem - of one's self.  Sounds like the girls family is pretty crappy and into only 'looks' versus what really counts in a person (their inner being or soul).  Maybe you could get her some books to read, help her understand, know and believe that it isn't necessarily the outer cover that makes a person worth something.  Success and happiness comes from within not what is reflected in a mirror.  here is an article with some good info to get you going.  Maybe it can point you in the direction of some other books and references.  <br>  <br>  Good luck to your girl friend, be strong and supportive, compliment her on other things besiders her looks.|`|uNJirnYoaa	keep telling her she is the most beautiful girl you have ever seen, show affection for her in public so she knows its just not talk.  hold her hand in public, kiss her, hug her, just show her that no matter what her family thinks, you think she is the greatest girl in the world and the best thing to ever happen to you|`|vxjOpKruaa	Write a poem that will make her feel beautiful. Say, "You're as beautiful as the fresh flowers that start to bloom in spring" or something really romantic like that.<br>  <br>  You could get a bunch of people to tell her that day that they really like her eyes or they really want her nose or she's got the cutest cheeks or something like that too.|`|l344RtC8aa	look her in the eyes and tell her she is beautiful.<br>  if you really like her tell her what it is about her even  beyond he rlooks that you like and that makes her beautiful.<br>  i hope that helped:(<br>  it's sad seeing girls think theyre so ugly and worthless. try to help her feel good about herself.<br>  good luck, you're a wonderful boyfriend|`|VPksp6SQaa	Some people just have self esteem issues. I don't take compliments well...people tell me i look good, I'm like "whatever" <br>  It got better in time w/ me and my boyfriend!<br>  So, maybe just give it time, but don't stop telling her she is pretty.<br>  You could also give yer compliments in something she is good at.<br>  (I'll just use an example)<br>  Say she's good at drawing. She shows you the pic, tell her it's good.<br>  When she is feeling down, remind her of all her qualites, is she funny? Trustworthy? Responsible?<br>  YES girls LOVE to hear their pretty, but they also like to hear the other stuff too! :)<br>  <br>  hope this helps!|`|MdUUGUPCaa	HAVE SEX WITH HER!!!!!!!!!<br>  <br>  Just kidding.<br>  <br>  <br>  Ask her what makes her feel this way and then tell her the positive things she has.<br>  Complement her.<br>  <br>  And then tell her that if she were ugly then why would u be with her.<br>  <br>  <br>  lol "lie to her"- other answerer.  (Don't do that to her)|`|6kAtYLAdaa	just be patient.   these things take serious time and so just keep the compliments coming no matter how much she protests or denies.  and remember one bad thing her family says cancels out like ten good things you did.. which really sucks but you sound like a really nice guy so just be nice to her, little gifts and compliments, kiss her while shes crying hold her etc etc. i promise it'll catch on eventually.|`|XFctazuhaa	if anything you should sit down  and have a conv with her about how her insecurity is eating away at you. and how you are dating her and not her sister. forget what her parents say cuz right now your opinion is the only one that matters.Because right now she is dating you and not her parents!!! :)|`|qDII8luraa	Give her space. Don't give empty compliments. But say how much she means to you and she should not worry about what her family or anyone else says.|`|PRgf7M6zaa	tell her you'd never go out with anyone like her sister because she, your gf, is so much prettier smarter and more interesting and you couldn't be with anyone who can't see how special she is.|`|6M6XhKDKaa	CHEER HER UP with different things - maybe a gift or take her to a movie. its different for each person so try whats best for her.|`|JHMK2g6taa	kiss her to prove it|`|m9MVvQwXaa	Wow, that is in no way fair, her family needs to understand that its not okay to judge there children and single one out. I think that you should just tell her how much you love her and point out that you are dating her, and their is NO ONE you would rather be with. Just reassure her that she is safe with you and every now and then slip in some comments about how good she looks and how beautiful she is. Eventually she may come around. <br>  I wish you the best luck!|`|bexmfHv0aa	Tell her to look in the Mirror, and be like look at you your beatufuil, your not ugly. i think you should talk to your gf family or her sister.and you should tell her to stop comparing yourself, to your sister. your unique and specile.<br>  get her to join self esteem group or something?<br>  maybe if she is with other people. who have the similar problems. then it might help her to talk, to others. who feel the same way.<br>  tell her? why do you think you are ugly? what makes you think that?<br>  be supportive. but not to pushy. if you understand what i mean.<br>  se shouldnt compare herself to others.<br>  take her shopping or something.<br>  and make her see her amazing she is<br>  or get her friends to talk to her.|`|fsuocQl0aa	just keep giving her compliments. That's  horrible that her family would tell her such a thing..(bad bad parents) Maybe she needs to see a councler for it, in a way it is abuse. <br>  <br>  <br>  Keep tell her she is pretty and eventually she will believe it, maybe u can try to talk to her parents or sister so that they can know what they have done to her self esteem.<br>  <br>  by the way your an amazing boyfriend for caring so much :)|`|WZgk58oGaa	i had this same problem to my sister was always prettier then me so i started to throw up cause of it and i changed my look. what you should do is everyday just tell her calmly that is is pretty and that ur turn on or something like that or you can say something like"i like the top or pants your wearing they look cute on you" tell her this every day or so and her self esteem will go away. thats what mythat's boy friend did to me and it work.|`|OTrQxlNEaa	Tell her you love her no matter what, you think shes the prettiest person ever and if she pleases you and your important to her thats all thats supposed to matter.. make that clear to her.. she is prob feeling this because she doesn't think shes pretty maaye if she's told so if could help her also talk about what you like about her and that beauty is skin deep.. <br>  Hope i helped! :D|`|SmwgLLd7aa	Teach her the "kill-a-boy" method: everyday when she looks in the mirror she needs to compliment herself. It's called killing a boy because that is the fun part. Every time a girl somewhere compliments herself, some retarded player turns to dust. <br>  <br>  Even if she just likes her hands or eyes or something, she might start to feel better.|`|4f021b7f6a669af817590f7d723651b2aa	well if she doesnt believe you then there is nothing you can do about it.  every day tell her she is beautiful. every day. and not in a way where she thinks its a chore for you or something, just when you talk on the phone and say goodnight, just tell her she's beautiful.|`|1J7rpwEdaa	Look into her eyes<br>  When she looks especially nice tell her<br>  Point out specific things that you love, like her eyes/bum<br>  Remind her that she has the whole package looks and personality<br>  Don't just call her pretty.. call her hott<br>  <br>  Stand in front of her... Look her in the eyes... Cup her face in your hands... Smile... and say... How did someone like me catch a babe like you... she'll melt!|`|ma6Imw4Qaa	wow she doesnt have much of a family. you might want to talk to the family about how they are treating their child, thats terrible! just be patient with her and tell her you always think shes pretty. <br>  "tell her it doesnt matter what other people think of her. its their loss on a great girl and friend."|`|vSCwIDCjaa	the only thing you can really do is keep complimenting her!!!when she meets up with you just say that you like what she's wearing that it makes her look exy or that her hair really suits her that way or stuff like that!!|`|RE81tMDtaa	tell her sshe is beautiful and someday when you see her sister tell her that way is everyone caomparing to her because she is sooo much beautiful|`|uHWFX7cMaa	Get your friends and you all in a group at your house invite her over and just have everybody say your beautiful :] Good luck <br>  ^^ I know random idea but i though that i'd just put that out there|`|mwWnrMJSaa	Get people to tell her she is pretty. like tell her friends to do it or somerthing....|`|sop6UrDOaa	lie to her

jBigEy0Caa	Awww, sounds like she is going through a rough time.  Keep being supportive, sounds like she needs you.  Ask her if there is something that is bothering her that maybe you can help her work through.|`|JcwjDpY8aa	is she in her 30s or over? if so, this could almost definitely be the onset of menopause, which would make all of these actions normal for a woman.<br>  birth control actually tends to "even" out a womans hormones and make her less emotional.  Woman are not supposed to take birth control of the same kind for over a year because it loses its effect.  She may even be on a low-dose b.c. that doesnt have any effect on her hormone levels.  Sounds like a woman to me, but who might be stressed out.  Is she having problems at work?  I would suggest sitting her down and telling her that her imbalanced emotions are taking a toll on you and you would really like her to open up to you about what is going on so that you can together tackle whatever problems she is having.  Just let her know you are there for her, and concerned of her obvious emotional turmoil, and she needs to open up and tell you whats going on so that you can understand it because it is hard for you to be on the receiving end.|`|3iNobwVraa	Hormones are the worst!  Usually, I rarely even notice them, but man after some chaotic stress and sadness, pregnancy, and miscarriage.  I'm beginning to wonder if I will ever feel like myself again?  <br>  <br>  Maybe I'll join the Prozac Possy. lol  (kinda)|`|sx0PpjvAaa	That all sounds like a normal regular woman to me.|`|UV27AyIPaa	Yes, my emotions control my thinking (but not my actions). But I digress, your wife probably needs to see a doctor with these symptoms. The hot flashes are a dead give away that something's definitely not right.|`|dqMf8IeCaa	does she do drugs? im not being funny. People might not do drugs all the time, but when she does she's weirded out. Sounds like someone I know.|`|yHJpLxtyaa	Pretty normal for us women...the week before we are very emotional and a little murderous...LMFAO|`|cHLhj3N0aa	no my box controls it|`|RKhSRMlZaa	I try not to let my emotions control my thinking.  Honestly, once I went on Seasonique (a birth control that goes on for three months straight) my hormones really leveled out and I rarely have PMS now.  <br>  <br>  It depends on the woman though.  She needs to try different things.  But birth control really helped me.  the first time I did the 3-month cycle, though, the emotions were REALLY bad.  But once my body got used to it I really didn't experience much PMS at all.  So give it a try and have her talk to her gynocologist about it.|`|iD4ejChZaa	I have learned not to let my emotions control me, I'm not passionate about anything anymore. [except my religion].
wpi36XBAaa	If she is just someone "...you have fun with and hook up with..." and have no commitment to either way, why does she owe you anything?  And why do you think you have the right to be offended when she should choose to just disappear for a while?  <br>  Do you want more?  Did you even know what kind of "...craziness going on in her life..."? If not then your not even a close friend, so why does she owe you more?<br>  It could be that she's either pulling away because you want more than she does, or trying to make you decide if you want more than someone to just hook up with or not. <br>  Who knows? She does, so ask her.|`|rFMRgHTdaa	I dunno if its over but she is the only person you can ask. Yes you are right what else does she expect?|`|7cjqT33Baa	I think your text made a valid point and was fair.  It's messed up to just drop communication for 3 weeks and then to come back like it's normal and expect things just to pick up from there.<br>  If she can't recognize that, she's probably not worth spending more time on.|`|7OTJW7fAaa	I think you responded appropriately.  It's obvious that she had someone else in her life that went away and she was considering her next option.  You and probably a few other guys were her next option.  So, she sends out a few texts and waits to see who will bite.  You won't hear from her right away unless she gets off on taunting you to get angry responses.  You will eventually hear from her again, when she has no active relationship and she will pretend like nothing bad happened between you.<br>  <br>  You are a source of amusement or someone she uses to alleviate boredom.  Your feelings don't matter to her, so hers should not matter to you.|`|JcwjDpY8aa	You did not do anything wrong and please dont back down about this.  she will continue to appear only when she wants to if you allow her to come into your life and leave whenever she wants.  Sounds like you arent the only man in her life.<br>  If she keeps texting you, tell her to call you if she wants to talk.  thats it, dont say anything else. if she wants to talk to you, she will call.  if it is just a spur of the moment impulsive thing and she is only texting you because her other man and her got in a fight, she wont call.|`|fMEypXDYaa	Well did you even try to contact her on your own? If you get text's and talked before she dropped out of sight on you, then that means you had her number, so why didn't you get in touch to see what was going on with her? She may feel that you didn't care enough to try and touch base with her, your question seems abit one sided and like you expect her to do all the work in the relationship, and you was sort of hard on her after she contacted you back, try calling her and talk instead of texting.|`|aSE7sihFaa	Forget about her!! It's obvious she's seeing other guys and may have had a falling out with one and is wanting you back now. If I were you I'd move on unless you're happy with a no strings attached occasional hookup. Sounds like that's all this chick is after.|`|23E3S11Laa	dude, i know exactly what you mean. chicks are so confusing. granted im kinda young, but you know what i mean. but to answer your question i personally dont think you were harsh i would have done about the same thing. if she really cared she would have at least let you know she was alive and stuff. good luck, bro|`|jBigEy0Caa	If you like her and want to give it a shot, take her out again.  People do get busy and maybe she has had alot going on.  The fact that she got in touch with you proves that she has been thinking of you.|`|ycNxVrUfaa	You were honest with her. If that puts her off, tough sh*t. She was rude and disrespectful. She could have called and said she was busy but apparently she couldn't even carve time out for that. She sounds like a game player.|`|UUrqECXIaa	I don't think you screwed up. She should appreciate your honesty. I bet she would've felt the same way if the situation was reversed. If she really wants you back in her life again, she'll contact you. When she does contact you, the two of you can talk the situation over. She owes you a better explanation than "she had lots of craziness going on in her life".|`|dqMf8IeCaa	f 29 here. I totally understand where your coming from. I mean personally maybe she has a bf. Only time will tell. Well she called you and that's a starter. So she is still thinking of you. The text message was totally called for. That was a straight to the point text. I mean you did grow feeling for this chick. Just take it slow. But always think twice with this chick. She might do it again. Good Luck in whatever decisions you might make.
zNjACkxpaa	I did my divorce online. I can't remember how long the whole thing took because I started the inquiry and then put it on hold til I got the $495 fee together. After that it was less than 6 months.<br>  <br>  Make sure that the firm is licensed in your state, check the Better Business Bureau to make sure they are legit. <br>  <br>  These only work if they are simple and uncontested if you have a complex or contested divorce it could cost you more in the long run.|`|f9sL3WgQaa	You can't! Atleast not where I am from. You have to take it to court and have it filed by them.|`|JYgJD0Rwaa	You cannot file for divorce online, that I know of. You can use a document prep service help you prepare the divorce papers then you will have to file them at your local courthouse.<br>  I used one for my divorce and it went pretty well. It has to be an uncontested divorce for the company to be able to help you.|`|sx0PpjvAaa	People hook up online so online divorce seems to be a logical consequence.

rFMRgHTdaa	Yes its unfair bring it up to her and tell her how unfair she is being. Or tell her your dad would be really mad, since that is why she let your brother.|`|sCuumWVTaa	'Well okay your brother isn't really doing anything that major. You probably already have your ears pierced and the whole brown hair with blonde on top is natural like he could've gotten that from being in the sun.<br>  Black and blonde hair does look like a skunk, and most(not me) think that facial piercings are cheap and tacky.
T55YPfXUaa	that's a good thing i believe. he is just concern about you and what you do. he wants you to be healthy and not starving. i wish i had a father that was so concerned and call teachers to check upon me or she if i was okay in class. don't be embarrass because he is your father not a stranger. enjoy his concerns about you. if the yelling part really bugs  you, then tell him stop yelling, you understand his view.<br>  <br>  peace. good luck!!!|`|OvuMI50Maa	so talk to ur dad, tel him how this makes u feel, and how it would be nice if ur life issues were kept at home.|`|NvOro0igaa	you think your dad embarasses you?

But, of course, if you want to kiss her, then you should take her aside - maybe during lunch or something - and kiss her. It's as simple as that.

Why would she dump you just because you havent kissed her? Thats not a true gf. True love doesnt mean that if you dont give your body to her, shes gonna dump you. Talk to her in person and in private, and tell her that someone told you she was gonna dump you for that. If your not ready to kiss, dude dont kiss. If your ready do it in private. If she just wants you to kiss her in public, then that means that she just wants to use you to look cool. <br>  But if you do decide to kiss her, do it in private.|`|MNjwTgWEaa	Ok calm down call or txt her now tell her wat happened ask her if it's true if it is ask her if she wanted to kiss tommorow who cares who sees u last time I asked this wikid hot girl named carrysa out I did it in front of my  friends and it was a yes plz listen to me just kiss her I'm kinds in a simmerler situation now so pls tell me way happened if u pick me. 4ur best answer trust me|`|hH76CdQ1aa	She really shouldn't break up with u for that.

That is a very immature and selfish reason for her to end things with you. She should at least talk with you about it before simply cutting things off with you. You are a freshman in high school - don't let her pressure you into doing something you aren't ready for. You can find yourself a girl who enjoys time with, and having a genuine relationship with you more than simply being impatient for a hook up.|`|WTH8GzXUaa	so here's what I think from experience.. if this girl is planning on breaking up with you tomorrow then you work up the courage to do it first.  Just simply say, "Hey, i really dont think this is working out, maybe we're better off as friends.".. When I was your age I remember planning on breaking up with my boyfriends.  I think it will really make her think, or even make her want you more if you break up with her first.  YOU BE THE BIGGER PERSON!!!|`|PXxbI1uWaa	wow you stupid as hell. why should it matter that your a bit shy? dudeee oh well she's obviously shallow if she's gonna break up with you bcuz yur nervous dude you suck. <br>  also have yu considered maybe yur friend is messing with you? and if he isn't and she's serious then dump her and just be friends or something, not too hard for you is it?|`|25ee9f178aa11dca53cb4c51e650799aaa	Im beginning to think this line of questions of yours are a complete joke!!, you had already posted that your "girlfriend" left you a break up text last week...whats up with you, and I also don't beleive that you are a "freshman in high school"|`|dIlP17Gnaa	if someone wants to break up with you cause she<br>  cant wait the she ovously does not like you that well|`|EhDLJAUYaa	problem: she wants you to kiss her.<br>  solution: kiss her.

They have every price range from very low to very high.  Take a look.  I would definitely recommend them.  I put you on the page for diamond solitaires but just click on engagement rings on the left for more options.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.jewelryexchange.com/productlist.aspx?catID=792" rel="nofollow">http://www.jewelryexchange.com/productli...</a>|`|jK9H6PHiaa	the thriftmaster: people give thumbs down because any ring that isn't a diamond isn't seen as a wedding ring, you should have seen the faces i got at the jewelry store when i asked for a colored ring for an engagement ring.<br>  <br>  i would do just as thriftmaster said and what i did, get an unoriginal ring. my ring is a real stone, real gold but it's colored, and it wasn't at all expensive, i paid $300 for the band and the ring and a lifetime warranty from j.b. robinson. i would also advise buying around holidays, they have huge sales.<br>  <br>  you could always go with a lab created diamond if you want the real thing kind-of look. they are just like natural diamonds but they are created in a lab. they only way to tell they are not natural is under a microscope you can see flaws, i don't know the name exactly but where they cut the ring there are tiny flaws but theyre are not any in lab created.<br>  <br>  good luck and congrats.|`|7R7e6yX5aa	i have never owned a diamond-my husband has never been able to afford one and we have been "married" for sixteen years and we never even had a wedding-stay single so you don't have to spend your money on a nasty divorce and abstain from having children for a long while|`|8kdjvWAxaa	Go to a jewelry store where they have less pricier jewelry|`|hVrfm4eIaa	Has he tried www.craigslist.org?

aO5ErghMaa	That depends on you. If you want to get your  Trust/and or love. I recommend you spend more time with him. Just tell the other guy that you aren't into him right now. That way you will not only have the other guy not feel sad. But you wont do anything to harm anyone. If you don't like him just tell him and do what you have to do to make friends. Good Luck.|`|3Y6E2EmMaa	get the guy you like in private. Don't avoid the other guy, just try to get to know the guy you like. Try not to be too flirty when all the guys are together. hav fun! :)
VSVQHKwKaa	You'll have to refinance. There is no other option. <br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|4POGapREaa	You can't do anything about that.  It's their money & they want security in having 2 people who qualified for that loan to be on it.  The person who said you should have him sign a Quit Claim has no idea what they're talking about.  A Quit Claim simply removes him from any interest in the property which you definitely should do since he's not going to be paying anymore, but that doesn't remove him from responsibility at bank level.  Your bank calls the shots on this one.  Qualifying again on your own is the only thing you can do.  They will not just remove him at request.|`|JYgJD0Rwaa	The only way to change information or mortgagees on the loan is to refinance. From my knowledge there is no other way to remove his name. If the company will not allow it, even with divorce papers stating his name will be removed, then other than refinancing there is no way around it. You may just have to wait until the economy/housing issue gets better to remove his name.|`|pRZ0YviYaa	You're going to have to sell the house, pay off the mortgages and whatever little money is left you'll have to split.

Google quit claim deed and divorce and see what you find.  Your mortage company should be able to send you the form for it.

IKsqsl9Paa	That's a pretty cute puppy.<br>  <br>  To be honest, I think your parents probably know best if having a dog is appropriate at all. You say you want a puppy really badly and that you want it to be yours only. Well I wonder if you realise what this means. When someone has the soul responsibility of an animal, well in short it means you do the walking every day, you clean up its mess, you pay for the food and the vet bills, you do the grooming, if it messes on the carpet you clean it up....etc. They is an awful lot more involved in having a pet then just playing with it when it looks cute.<br>  Also, I realise you are aware of this of course, but I just wanted to remind you that puppies do not stay puppies. It doesn't take very long before they are fully grown. Will you still be so crazy over having one then? I know this seems harsh, but they are all things you need to think of before taking on an animal.<br>  <br>  So my suggestion is to speak to your parents. Explain that you would really like to get a dog and suggest that you all sit down and come to a compromise. When you have all agreed on what type of dog you would like, then perhaps share out the chores involved. It may also pay off if you show your parents how grown up and responsible you are by organising and planning all of this. Trust be, bombarding them with "I want a puppy" really isn't the best way to get one.<br>  <br>  I hope it all works out well.|`|QxS0Kcg0aa	its a tuffy. try to convince them both when they are both present that you are responsible enough to actually take care of the puppy, and be able to feed it, walk it ,bathe it, etc. then try to negotiate an agreement and who knows, maybe you'll get your puppy sooner or later|`|zAd8q8KQaa	What a cute little dog in that picture.<br>  Raising a puppy is a tough task. We just got our parents a little one for xmas and it's a pain!  It's a good dog, but it's hard work!<br>  <br>  Good luck with your parents and show some maturity and keep up with school, stay out of trouble, etc...then maybe they'll let ya get one!
7fXpLlhBaa	There isn't a set-in-stone rule book about who people should be attracted to and who they should like. It's really all a societal lemming scheme really. There are so many people out there that don't pursue certain people just because they are worried of the backlash from society. I say, forget about what others think and do your own thing- to me, that's the bravest thing anyone can do.<br>  <br>  It's just a number.|`|hH76CdQ1aa	well i think it okay if there like super stars<br>  <br>  help me!!!<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090219171315AAcqSxc">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a><br>  <br>  PLEASE|`|Hek7MUNYaa	its a celeb crush and yes it is totally normal lol|`|PNnfXwNGaa	yeah|`|ZzEAc5ecaa	i know to well.. its call.. father syndrome   young girls get it all the time .. you will grow out of it soon .. and find a real man just for you .. bigs hugs just for you ..
Sn4zj9T3aa	Well, the only recurrent factor in all your disappointing relationships is you.<br>  <br>  Maybe you just go for the wrong type of girl....|`|cPTB57WMaa	Dude, what is wrong? I wish I was tall so that I could get the tall chicks as well (I'm pretty good with girls at my height and shorter).<br>  This MIGHT be one of your problems: Do you tell the girl that you like her on the first date or sth? remember, you never tell a girl that you like or love her not only on the first date, but not even on the 9th date. You can start paying more attention to them after the 3rd date, and kinda throw it there that you like how she reacts, or BS like that, but never express love or your interest early in dating. Be as cool as you can. Never act serious, and never boast about yourself or your job or about how successful you are, cos girls will run away if they feel they can't compete with your capabilites. If you are rich, successful, smart, or etc, let them discover it without telling them directly. Always keep some things secret and mysterious so that they keep being interested to find out that one other thing about you. Now that you are 25, never tell them that you have not had a gf before. If they ask, tell them you have had three for example since high school. If you look like a normal guy (which you said you did), and can act funny, I can't see how you wouldn't be able to find someone. Be confident and you will nail one soon. Good luck, and don't forget best answer.|`|6E16tR6xaa	Maybe its your personality.

I bet it turns out to be a night you won't forget- who knows, you might even meet the love of your life!<br>  <br>  And, as an end note, even if it doesn't go well- you said yourself you won't know anyone there- so chances are you won't see these people again!<br>  <br>  Good luck:-) Just go!|`|aez3cIkvaa	You got the dress already and the ticket.

Do you realize that you might only have one day left on the Earth?  None of us are promised another day.  So get out there and do some LIVING!   Be alive !!!!

5ZK9VGPCaa	He would have to dress very well (as in better than average... putting to shame all the badly dressed, "can't be bothered to take pride in their appearance", random guys that I see on the street everyday) and preppy (because that is the only style, other than a suit, which looks good on guys!). To be frank, I have standards and I also can't be dealing with "you are soo high maintenance" blah blah from a low-key, "laid-back", average type of guy.. so I want a guy who likes being and looking better than average and understands why I like to make sure I look good. He would have to be well mannered and courteous, but not straight-laced and boring like a high society British school boy. I really wouldn't care if other people think he is stuck up, because I rely on my own judgment and if I get on well with him, then that's all that really matters. He doesn't have to be the best looking ever by objective standards, because as soon as I fall for a guy he becomes in my eyes the hottest guy on the planet and I don't even look at other guys. He would also have to be intelligent and driven career-wise so that we have things to talk about. I would get frustrated with a guy who didn't want to move forward. Basically, I am ambitious so I need a guy who is too, so that we can be a good influence on each other and motivate one another. I also tend to like guys who are a bit older than me who I can learn things from and because they are mature enough to understand their feelings and not play silly mind games like being hot and cold or trying to make me jealous. In terms of personality, I would want him to be self confident, out going, sweet to me but not a push over. In the long-term, he would have to be polite and respectful to my family. My sister and my dad in particular would have to "approve" of him. He would have to appreciate me and appreciate my cooking skills and make me feel like I was the best catch and that he is glad that he has me. I would have to trust him and I would be loyal and would expect the same in return. I would also want him to have a good relationship with his mom. It is a good indicator of how he views women (whether he respects them) and how he is likely to treat other women in his life. I would lose respect for a guy who was rude to his mom.|`|BUET39wmaa	someone who knows me and respects me  someone who is considerate of my feelings  someone who is sexy and sexual  someone who is a good parent  someone who is ambitious  someone who is confident|`|ygimTNzoaa	Full respect, obsession is a HUGE turn off. Someone with the same interests in music, sports, outdoor activities and similar future goals. Someone who is independent who preferably has a job but understandable if full time in college or layed off because of the economy. Has a car (part of Independence). Loves animals, sensitive in the way of willing to communicate issues never hiding thoughts or feelings about situations that may make you uncomfortable. Know that if I'm in a relationship with you were in it together it's not one sided we both will have to compromise to fit each others needs in the end. I prefer a guy who is not overly friendly who doesn't party to much or have TO many friends as I found there is not much time for someone new in there life since I look for long term relationship not short term flings. Someone who's not just considerate to me but the people around them, selfishness is another big turn off. I like to know about my man and what his interests are, that's where obsessive guys go wrong too, I never know what they like I can never figure anything out because it's always "what do YOU feel" or "What do YOU want". I'd like to hear, "Well I like this, what do you like?". Grammar, someone who can speak correctly and someone who dresses like he cares so I can be proud to bring him home to my parents. Someone who can help and encourage me to accomplish my future goals as I for him. Generally that's the gist.

So i like a guy who is tall (since i'm about 5'11!), dark hair, and a great smile. My guy needs to have a great personality-i mean someone who sstands out from anyone else i meet. He needs to be smart, so we can have serious conversations. and also funny! thats my number one turn on and attraction when we first meet-if he can make me laugh!  Also i love it when my guy is masculine towards me/our relationship-meaning i love it when he can make me safe and take care of me (i love being babied sometimes i won't lie lol).

It might mean that I wouldn't mind getting to know her.|`|k3y2ViUyaa	its not staring it is more to glance at them...some girl finds it is really scary if a guy stare at them especially when u stare at one paerticular area(upper part of d abdomen)..so if u really want to look at her make it short and never watch her all d time or she will think dat u are a freak...|`|csO6gnroaa	i stare at girls when i like them|`|yM8NiXmLaa	i wouldnt say stare.... more like glancing continously... and whenever the other person looks back you always turn your head... or smile and then turn your head... so yea... you look at them alot... alot alot...

CGFAPKJOaa	Yes! OMG...my boyfriend & I got into our first arguement sometime in September. I kept telling him to leave it was over & that I didn't love him anymore. Finally, he quit begging and left. Then, a minute later he came right back. I was still acting that just to see what he would do. I kept telling him I didn't want to be together anymore, I don't love him to f cking leave. He teared up, said what he needed and left. That time I knew he was really gone. I went looking for him down the road since he walked. I couldn't find him. I panicked, thinking this was really it. I came straight in, put on the song "Hurt" by Johnny Cash and cried and screamed to myself while laying in the floor. I would get up and check the windows to see if he was really gone. And he really was. I made myself literally sick, throwing up from all the emotional screams and cries. About 10 minutes later he came back. Knocking on my door. I opened it very quick, jumped on him and said I love you and I want to be with you forever.    That was the day that I realized how much I truly did love him and want to be with him. I'll always remember that day.    I'm glad I stayed with him. He is the love of my life and the Father to my unborn child. I am pregnant with his baby now. I am 12 weeks and 4 days.|`|CIzrjrykaa	my name is jerry o.o wth?    and nope|`|AdIrjmV7aa	No.  If they walked away from me they lost their best thing ever. I say bye bye and don't come back.
W1rCsvTzaa	You have a great mindset about this.  In person, smile and simply don't reply or smile and say "is everything ok?".  On the phone if she is bitchy or irrational just ask "is everything ok?" in a friendly voice.  If she asks why you are asking you can simply say it sounds like she is: take your pick:  angry, having a bad day, upset, etc.    But really nasty people HATE silence so not responding works very well.|`|af644b7256e7bf5a53974bb99a32d482aa	Well, he's not your boyfriend--he is still her husband until the divorce is final. That's probably why she dislikes you.|`|CIzrjrykaa	just act like your her friend she'll get frustrated that your not getting angry|`|LgOOYyXIaa	just smile alot  and look HOT, like really hot (it'll make her jealous)  be great to her kids...so they'll talk about u to her lol  when she's around talk about how great her ex husband is  kiss him in front of her haha  um....compliment her on stuff  be bubbly and charming..  it'll drive her nuts!! lol  hope this helps!!!|`|bO2rzfISaa	Good for you.

Nothing you can do to change that.  "Revenge" is always bad for business.  I guess just treat her as one of your distant friends:  be polite when meet, but do not share anything personal.|`|yhEDUN6qaa	If she's so concerned about you (talking/lying about you) then the best way to get under her skin would be to not give a sh*t.

Answer mine please:)  http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...|`|eXj6Ro5Raa	Don't sink to her level. Just be civil when you see her. Once you start playing games you lose. Whether you like it or not she is going to be in your life because of his kids. She will get bored if you don't react to her nonsense. Take the higher ground and be the adult.|`|BJZeBBR5aa	Then be the mature one in the situation. Let her know that despite your differences for the sake of the CHILDREN you vow to get along.  Don't let ANYTHING she says or does to affect you or the smile you have on your face.  Her ex and your now bf will see how unaffected you are and also see the level of maturity you are keeping.  Don't fight fire with fire, water is gentle and it eases the flame.  so your word's kill her with kindness hold allot of truth, but BE SINCERE in your kindness even if at times it takes biting your tongue until it bleeds.  Never argue with a fool because from a distance no one can tell the difference. -jay z-  :)|`|wzAhxdpKaa	Even better than kill her with kindness is Kill her with Neutrality.  If you are going out of your way to be sweet then it's obvious that it's false.  If you are acting a part then she knows she is still affecting you.  Try to show her that she is of absolutely NO consequence to your life, simply meaningless, by treating her neither good nor bad.  When you see her, just picture the face of someone, some stranger, who means nothing to you one way or the other.  Don't voluntarilly join in to conversations about her or with her.  Let her feel invisible.  It will bug her even more than the kindness routine.|`|lgxE5nUoaa	I would avoid her and I would back off from the relationship until the divorce is final.|`|21Wk2mu5aa	Are you kidding? You are having an affair with her husband and regardless if it's true or not she will blame you for destroying her marriage for the rest of your life. You are better of to keep your distance.    Don't expect those kids to treat you like a mom, either.|`|O3fcLsKMaa	I don't know who made up that saying, but I've found that people hate to be ignored.  Ignoring someone is the best way to go.|`|DenLZAL1aa	You are doing right. Don't react to any slander or libel from her. If someone comes and tells you "so and so says this, or says that, respond, by changing the subject. You are doing the right thing by not letting this woman rent space in your mind.|`|b26NgqOFaa	Don't waste your time. I know you want to somehow get the better of her (harmlessly) but whatever you do, she's not gonna get it and she's never gonna like you so just move on and be happy with this guy.
60iESfwnaa	you don't want to be too forward as you will look like you are desperate..  you need to play it cool but at the same time you want him to know that you are interested!  flirt with him- smile at him a lot, giggle... etc  make conversation with him, general chitchat so that he sees that you are interested...   he then may ask for your number? then that wont be so embarassing and also a confidence boost for you.   personally i wont ask for his number as it may be embarassing if he isnt interested.   ask one of his friends if he is interested or get your friends to ask him!  hope thats helpful.|`|RTa3g9ZHaa	Grow up and ask him. Not to sound rude, but is the only reason you like him is because he's 'fit'? If so you sound like a very shallow person. If you want it ask for it; you don't want to go home at the end of the day without it because you couldn't ask him a simple question.|`|cn7gqmbaaa	go and ask him, i'm a guy and it's hard work doing all the asking    FAO Women - give us a break|`|KuNM2j9caa	Walk up to him and ask for it.

This will get you his number, address, where he works, etc etc.     Problem solved!|`|wXAPalgIaa	just be like oh hey whats your number?  or like whats your number we should meet up sometime.|`|JH9IMMDtaa	you should give your phone number to him!!!|`|HRNKJUYuaa	when you see him on the side  fall over accidentally on purpose  go over to the side  laughing with your mates  so its fun :)  all of youz get talkin to him  then all ur mates eill go toilet,,or to return there skates  while your still undoing your skates  say   i cant believe i just done that!  yous never fall over though  your to good at skating  were all goin cinema later  do u wana come?  hell need your number to meet up with you XD  then afta, send him a text to say   it was well good tonight!  also   add him on facebook  keep in touch!!   good look  btw  dont feel cringey  youll look daft :P|`|4jtf3MR9aa	LOL good question i think if you really want his number you will go out and get it.|`|1LTrZbxwaa	Ask for the number, but in a way that he ask you for it.    Innocently talk about what kind of cell phone he has, then sometime during the conversation say: "You know if you had my number you could give me a call".    That way he ask you for it, if he doesn't he is either too dumb or not interested, either way its all good.|`|9my9QYATaa	just say you wnt his number, for a quick casual one then suck his hard cock. HE WILL OVE IT, swear to god thats all boys think about|`|k8pjXNChaa	lol is he fitted as a mug?|`|3JfADTIDaa	Just say "Hey, can I get your number?" Guys are SO easy, he'll give it to you unless he's taken|`|hBxU3CAkaa	If a guy is feeling you he would most definitely ask for your number. But on the other hand he could just be a little intimidated with your friends around. Make eye contact with him when you're not surrounded by your girls (make sure you smile) and see if he comes your way. If he doesn't make the move then you should just leave it alone.|`|3203c9731cb9bf893f22dac9386a7f85aa	Well there are many ways.....    1) since you don't' mind, give him your number (may sound desperste)    2)Approach the person and let them know that you have lost your cell phone. (be sure to make them notice you, you want to be REMEMBERED) Ask them if they wouldn't mind calling it to see if you might be able to hear it ring. Trust me 99% of the time they would be more than happy to do this for you. A little Caller ID and there, Done!   Even one of your friends  can pop out with your phone (but it would look weird though.......)    3)Face book Method:-  Invite him to become your Face-book friend. Many people display their phone number on their Face book profile. (applicable for any other networking/ similar site)|`|bMa8gK3paa	Start up a conversation about Social Networking. Facebook, Myspace, twitter, etc. Don't ask does he like them, ask what he thinks about the concept, what they're good for, does he know anyone that uses them, etc.    If yes, ask him about his "layout" and if he uses third party add-ons, like music, graphics, etc.    If no, find out the "why". If you guys are really young it might be because his parents don't let him or he doesn't have any privacy on the computer at home; so don't press, he might be a little embarrassed about it. Just offer up, "I feel the same way."    Once you get him chatting, ask him what guys think about girls making the first move. Ask it like you and your friends were talking about it. "It's a new day...guys shouldn't have to ask all the time ... what do guys think?..." That sort of thing.    If he says," guys don't like it." You have your answer. If he says something like "it's a pain asking a girl out."  You have your answer.    But, I think, you should give him your number and tell him you'll be there after 8 o'clock. That is telling him you're interested, but isn't too forward.    Remember everyone likes flattery.  "Where'd you learn to skate like that? Can you show me that move? You're so tall. You have nice eyes, strong hands,  funny smile ..."
muk4bPPhaa	If your mother is still getting child support, your grandfather is not your legal guardian.  Correct this issue and your grandfather should get money instead.  This will be a long process with a lot of forms and your, your father's, AND your mother's legal consent.  It's great your getting As and Bs, Congrats! :)|`|hvcjyEmDaa	It is up to your Dad and Grandpa to go to court and have the child support changed. Your grandpa should become your legal guardian. It will cost money to have this done, because lawyers are expensive. The first consultation with a lawyer should be free. You need someone who practices family law as a specialty. If there is a social worker you can talk to, I'd do that, too.<br>  <br>   I wish you, your grandpa and dad best of luck. Congrats on turning your life around and getting good grades!|`|RDgyb7W8aa	Your dad should go to court and have the child support order saying $ to be paid to grandpa.  it's morally illegal|`|Hx2raTNQaa	it is illegal i think so i would call child support orsomthing to help out:) hope i helped:)))
hWX0A4u7aa	its best you forget about that person and move on find someone else and make new friends have friends the you have fun with and make sure you choose the right people.|`|u8sGVYdCaa	The best thing is to simply be civil. Don't speak about things not related to the subject matter. Treat him as a professional, not as a former friend. When you get older and enter the work force, you're going to have to do this with your co-workers, so it's good practice now.     It is fine to let go of your feelings and move forward, focusing on your goals. And it's also a sign of maturity to be able to "work" at school alongside people you don't get along with, so I hope you'll be able to cut out your drama. Don't give him a cold shoulder, but I wouldn't try socializing or joking around with him -- anything that may bring up possible situations for fights.    Good luck.|`|VALxlwYSaa	Mhm.   Just forget about him and move on. Really, if you guys are enamies or whatever you shouldn't care what he thinks. Don't give him any of your attention and walk with your head held high :P     though, if you have to work together just quietly do the work and only talking if it has to do with the work.

My life and everyone's life is great.|`|XRn0Ai3Naa	I am thankful for what i do have but i believe it can be so much better. That's why i am trying to make something of myself so that i can be a better person and when i have kids they can have everything that i didn't.

But I think it's perfectly fine not to have one. Another non necessary expense .|`|AaoclPYCaa	You can do whatever you want.  I think petals on the isle would be fine.|`|UUQXNhMtaa	Aisle runners are to prevent gown from catching or getting dirty. If all is smooth and clean you don't need them|`|76nTvO4iaa	If you're wearing a short dress, and aisle runner isn't necessary.<br>  <br>  Real rose petals can be slippery and could stain a wooden floor.

I'm sure he'll shave back and you'll have the naked face you love in good time.  Look at the bright side.  Alot of men shave off their facial hair during a mid-life crisis because they think it makes them look younger and they're trying to attract young ladies.  At least your dude is doing the opposite!

It should only matter what you think of them, he's your man.    I personally think most men look hideous with mustaches and they aren't fun to kiss someone with either.  I've seen men walk around with a booger in them before and not even know it's there.  Real attractive lol.|`|4IFXHz80aa	personally, im not a mustache fan. i like more a goatee w/o mustache or a beard. but beard only if the head is shaved. my husband thought about a mustache too, but i nixed that idea. now he has a beard. plus i think mustaches look creepy!|`|sVdQSMvJaa	Only if it's attached to a goatee..otherwise it's cheesy|`|eXj6Ro5Raa	I'm not a fan of them. Why don't you just tell  your husband that you aren't crazy about it in a nice way. He will probably get rid of it or grow tired of it soon.

It's completely normal.<br>  <br>  I was never like that, but I still don't think its weird or anything.|`|UUQXNhMtaa	Not having a groom is OK at 17. Enjoy dreaming!|`|7wQ5t5Psaa	nope, plenty of girls do that :)|`|8ilHQMq5aa	yeah you will change your mind before then|`|ePn3I3RMaa	No this is perfectly normal!! Just be flexible in case the man you fall in love with may have his own ideas or family traditions. But when you find a wonderful guy, you shouldnt mind some compromises.|`|cYa5blUJaa	definitely not odd at all|`|pMsMx817aa	not odd<br>  im seventeen and know almost everything about my wedding, except the food and some other small details, but i have the groom lol<br>  <br>  but no its not odd, alot of people love planning their future weddings, its fun :)<br>  <br>  ella|`|gjMJzfoeaa	No, especially if your mother read all those fairy tale books to you as a child. Girls basically begin planning their wedding from the age of 3 when they first hear Cinderella or Snow White living happily ever after. We're groomed to think about our wedding at an early age.|`|vtW3qPZmaa	As long as you realise that your wedding will more than likely be nothing like what you have in your head right now, you're fine.  As you get older your tastes will change, and once you do have a fiance you're going to have 2 people wanting to have input into your wedding day.  So many females think that men don't care about their wedding day, but most of them are going to want the day to reflect you both as a couple, not the bride as an individual.|`|AaoclPYCaa	Its not odd its pretty normal.  If you young girls put as much care and planning in finding the right guy that you do in putting your wedding together there would not be so many divorces.  Marriage is not about all the frills and fuss of the wedding its about the relationship between two people who have promised to cherish each other no matter what, for the rest of their lives.|`|OY8Z5vG9aa	no. some girls are just like that.  they begin planning their weddings at like age 5.  don't you remember that episode of everybody loves raymond where he asks his wife to marry him? she says yes and then pulls out a scrapbook she made of everything she wants at her wedding.  or in that movie 27 dresses.  the girl knows exactly what she wants her wedding to be like.|`|VsLSJ65Paa	Awww I think its adorable.  Most of my friends were like that too.. For some reason I always found other things to dominate my mind but its not odd at all~! Daydream away :]
BUET39wmaa	there is no should.    some are happy with 1x a week  my hub and I would never be happy with that and so we do it about 4-5x a week|`|21Wk2mu5aa	Two times a week is about an average. But it really doesn't matter, it just depends on the couple. Kids, work and everyday responsibilities usually have an impact on the frequency.|`|2f2338425d995c6d00e32cb38d57ee7faa	As many as they'd like. For some, it's several times a day, for others, a few times a month or a year.|`|f02e697306fa9b0bd6517818970ff8daaa	Depends on the couple.  They will have to come to that agreement.  Some like it hot and some like it cold. Some like it in the pot, 9 days old. Time to chat with the wife.|`|o6xLWwZvaa	This answer will be different for everyone.     The number of times a couple actually does it and the number of times a couple would actually like to have. The number is different for everyone.|`|k4mGOlwsaa	well an average couple would most likely have sex 3 times a week, me i prefer 5-7 times a week i guess it depends on couples work schedule, and there living situation.|`|7n4rtfp6aa	Some couples have sex twice a day! It depends on your sex drive, so just relax and have sex as much as You wish:)|`|mJbwemH8aa	As long as u both want. 5 times a week is not too much, when am ok and she is ok, we do it 3 square times a day...|`|6KpZ2fIRaa	Everyone is different and will have a different number in mind. I say as many times as it takes to please both parties involved. It could be one, two, or even twenty.|`|djAyXS9Iaa	3 times a year - lol|`|zoyw8CRKaa	Well my husband and i do every night and even once or twice during the day sometimes aswell. We have high drives lol|`|2ikZxzBfaa	3 times a week|`|GeruGGOQaa	As many times as they feel like it.|`|F8iYNurEaa	As much as they are both happy with. If he wants it every day and she is fine with twice a week then maybe meet half way (every other day).|`|gfHutvEFaa	Should? Every couple is different. Some do it everyday, some do it every other and some do it never.|`|ze7xiJwTaa	I'm with Greta...when it got to zero I realized it was over. Now I'm happy with 3-5. Sometimes we get it all in on the weekend and sometimes we stretch it out. I'm spoiled now. Any less and I think I'd be sad.|`|cJvoAS4Paa	It depens on their mood really. Most men would be up for it every night but women have to be shown love first and made want it. In my relationship usually between 3 and 4 times a week, sometimes more ;) i would say 2 in enought though. i believe in quality rather than quantity though ;)|`|uuMCGT9taa	sometimes we do it 3x a week or 3x a day , it just happens when it happens.    when we use to live alone 5-8 days a week    now we have  a roommate so a little less 5 x a week|`|VBtzeVlKaa	As much as possible I say!  ;-)  5 times a week is NOT too much!  Don't listen to anyone. Just do what feels right to you and your partner. If you are both happy with this, that is ALL that matters!    All the best!|`|5a699df0b1999b097464635a2fe75fd1aa	It varies from couple to couple!!  So cant really pinpoint to a fixed number.    :)|`|0s93q8Ocaa	Why are you EVEN discussing this private topic with your friends?    Show off!|`|T4N6a7MQaa	Why would your friends even know? Anyway, whatever amount works for you and your spouse is a good number. My wife and I have sex 3 times a week. I'm 58 and she's 54. In my 20's and 30's it was daily and twice on weekends. Some people just have a more active libido than others.|`|gdWXzQW6aa	10 times an hour.|`|aGwjf2y4aa	however much they want too id say the adverage is 3/4 times|`|40ed361ed7df354988fb96506fac28e3aa	You should do it whenever you feel like it . its up to you and  your  partner  your  friends    might just be  jealous because their sex lives and  libido aren't  the  same  has  yours.|`|vLgbjmI2aa	I think everyday.But i dont get that lucky.lol.My husband is tired alot from work so i am lucky if i get it twice or three times every two weeks.;(|`|SyR2ZlMHaa	I don't think there is a should. I would like 2-3 times a week but my wife would be happy months apart. Current last time is a month or so but it's sometimes 2-3 months. (Much to my frustration)|`|20tvJd4paa	once on the wedding night and then once again if they wish to have a child|`|lgxE5nUoaa	That is between two people.  What works for one couple, will not work for another.  There is no right or wrong answer here.|`|kbz5S3waaa	HA!! If i got my way it would be like 14, but I settle for 2 or 3 :(|`|aHjXZEzoaa	we aren't married but living together for over a year....6 times a week is what we do now....before it was more like 8 or 9 times a week... btw...we are in our mid 40's.
AA11208683	i am so sorry to hear this. it honestly made me want to cry. and i don't know exactly how to help you specially if her and your son live in a different country. All i can say is that i am going to be praying for you that things get better. but it sounds like she doesn't deserve you and you should leave but it isn't right that she is not letting you see your son. I wish you the best of luck. this is a very hard situation!|`|5CBOYaMHaa	Beat her up.<br>  <br>  Im joking... Or am I?|`|TfXKL4X1aa	Did anyone else read this with a chinese accent in their head??? lol<br>  <br>  You really need to forget about your wife. If she beats you then you don't need to be with her but you need to go and see your son. Its him who will bear the real consequences if his father isn't around|`|63e59b702150659952a33a58d86bde05aa	She does not sound right.  I agree with your father, she is sick.  Can you get custody of your son from her?  She does not sound safe for you or your son.|`|cCJvsEPsaa	She can only be helped if she wants to help herself. You could take your son and leave the country.|`|VygBNA0Waa	take your son and leave don't leave your son there leave with him and go move in with your family that's the only Choice i see you have|`|874EAxkfaa	If you lay on ground like a rug,everybody will walk on you!|`|XO5TY6tPaa	I Would Say sit down and talk with her tell her hoe you are being treated and say you dont like it but dont get angry because she would get and angry it would just make the problem worse! i f problems still occur i would advise a family solicitor maybe (s)he could find out  what the problem is but dont worry i would tell your wife your giong to get one first if you feel depressed go to a good psychiatrist, again (s)he would help you to get your life back on track im sure you and your wife would work it out ,but be4 you get the solicitor sit and talk it might work out after a chat and coffee!<br>  <br>  If it still happens have a break for a weekend or your wife <br>  <br>  If Desperately hope this works out between you and your wife yet again bad English from me  Good Luck :)|`|naequcqlaa	If she says you beat her, she has to PROVE you've beaten her.  NO ONE w/just take her word on this.  So don't worry about that.  She would have to have pictures of her bruises that she says you've done to her.  So she just can't say it w/o proving it also.  People know her & know what kind of a person she really is, so if they know the both of you, then they w/also know the truth that she's just lying about you.  And YES, YOU CAN get a divorce from her.  It's called "break down of the marriage, OR "irreconcilable differences"  These are two sure ways you CAN get a divorce from her.  Yes, it w/take a bit longer, but at least it CAN be done fo sure.  IF the two of you do get divorced, you surely CAN get visitation rites to see your son.  She does not have the proof she's threatening you with, & that's all she's doing is threatening you.  Since you are NOT familiar w/the laws, she is just trying to poll the wool over on you by scaring you,  Do NOT let her scare you, because she has No proof, at not the proof she needs,  You could say you ''are aware" of your rites, & that she cannot any longer try to trick you into all the bull she's trying her best to "feed" you  Just try to stay calm because she has nothing that w/stand up in court against you.  So at least you can know that for fact.  So you at least can feel better now that you at least know a lot of the truth.  I wish you all the best...:)
utOVoGo3aa	No, she does not like you, if she did, she would say ''hi'' and would want to chat with you on facebook. This girl sounds popular and I don't think that she would go for someone like you, but don't worry I know she MIGHT show more interest in you in the future. Just talk to her more and hang out with her, that will get her clicking, Hope this helped, Good Luck.|`|pQBjqMkoaa	How to tell if she likes you signs<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NNpyqY5f08" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NNpyqY5f...</a><br>  <br>  *watch video|`|4X4uRwqBaa	she's probably just shy around you cuz she likes u, if shes outgounig why would she by shy around u? she prob doesnt talk to u cuz shes nervous and doesnt want to mess things up!|`|GqL8VD9aaa	I'm sorry, but I think she doesn't like you. She might suspect that you like her, and so she's trying to stay away. <br>  I once did that, with meaning to, so she could also just be doing it without knowing....<br>  tell her how you feel!<br>  <br>  answer my question!|`|oX3ukKGWaa	she definitely doesn't like you. And you said you don't like her so why did u even ask this question? Anyways usually you have to talk to a girl and become friends before moving on to anything else.|`|Zqby1cXpaa	you didnt give enough info bro but do you like her, and have you told anyone or talk about it in public cause she might have heard or has a feeling you like her an is trying to avoid you sorry if that sounds kinda harsh dude|`|qkLqlW4Caa	i know that when i'm around a guy i like i usually don't say anything or im shy cause i know i'll either blurt out something stupid or i have nothing cool to say.|`|8QO17Xw1aa	its too hard to tell if she likes you from what you said... but just ask her out. if she says no then she says no and you can move on. <br>  she may be acting odd when you happen to be buying coffee where she works cus she may think you're stalking her... haha its ok though. everyone does it.<br>  but don't call yourself ugly. give yourself more credit|`|YtkX7u7qaa	she might like you, sometimes when i like i guy i act like that so she could like you or she thinks that you like her and she doesnt like you back so shes trying to show you that shes not interested. just give her some time and see if anything changes.|`|7YTXvoFiaa	hell yeah she likes u!!!! whats ur popularity status at school? maybe she thinks she is "below u" and is afraid she'll say the wrong thing to u and u will end up not liking her. it will make sense soon enough...|`|miMi9uH3aa	no i dont think she likes you. she hasnt made any effort to get to know you better, by the examples that you have given. or she could be shy, maybe just try to become her friend first.|`|92517655f5cdc0b04061c39c885a5811aa	Ask about the size of her penis.|`|sM7ab6Araa	Ya, dont become her friend first. Hope that helps, and im serious dont be her friend first,|`|GRCdqxQHaa	if she avoids you she doesnt like you...|`|ufu5DlQ2aa	when a girl likes you the usually tend to be flirty and youchy but some girls mayy shy away
ce8kACW4aa	well you would be buggered to working all day like he does|`|dRj9FoHzaa	Come on! Let the man gets some sleep and you will have your sex.  It's tough to be a man.|`|ZleVRevVaa	Don't worry, just cooperate with ur husband.|`|63e59b702150659952a33a58d86bde05aa	He is tired.  End of story. We women are so complex in our emotions, but men are really simple.  They usually say it like it is.  Food, Sex, Sleep, Respect. These are important to a man (according to my hubby and male friends).  The order moves around for different times and different men.  Accept the answer and love him and be glad you have a good man.|`|sDAnuaBYaa	She works all day too, don't forget that!!|`|fyXoVV6daa	if it happens again just talk to him, understand that he works alot and he would be really tired. try doing things to him so he doesnt have to use and effort,he can just lay back and enjoy. if its only happened one night dont stress. he loves you,you'll sort it out. if it bothers you that much,talk to him. he was most likely very tired. im still young and i want sex alll the time and am always up for it but everytime my boyfriend and i are finished im the one who rolls over and goes to sleep only coz im tired from the sex thats all.<br>  good luck.
ZSznCJhSaa	I know this seems like a tough dilemma. She is 17 and obviously in a bit of trouble, you feel like its your duty to tell her mother.     But be careful of this. It is not your place to use facebook to spy on your friends daughter and then tattle on her. You should only tell her mother if you really think the situation could lead to SERIOUS harm.     Otherwise it is in no way your place to interfere.|`|2oc6TDiGaa	tell she may be mad now but later it will be all good|`|aOtiIgYSaa	dont tell! thats mean|`|fCZKGBjBaa	No don't tell her Mom.  Get the hell off facebook, spy.    EVERY TEEN GOES THROUGH A PARTY STAGE. ITS A PICTURE YOU DONT KNOW THEIR DRUNK, AND YOU DONT KNOW HOW OLD THE GUY IS. DONT MAKE ASSUMPTIONS.     delete your facebook if thats all you have one for.  to spy. wow|`|55e3858ec5337970fbef5876fc1e5fe0aa	Do what your comfortable with ... If you decide to get involved .. then print out the pictures and pass them along to the parental units.    Do what the person in the mirror tells you too !|`|Xt7jo8bcaa	Do what your gut says....if this was your daughter..would u want someone to tell u?...we all need to protect and look out for our kids...rather they are ours...or someone else's...(Remember the old saying..it takes a whole village to raise one child)|`|a62b895e23928e2555a83a605626c900aa	Unfortunately in our society it isn't the person doing wrong that everyone gets mad at, it's the person that tells .  This girls Mother is not on the ball. That's what the problem is .  2 Timothy 3:1-5  tell us who to turn away from .  If you decide to delete her, be sure to tell her why .|`|vrACGkKBaa	Of coruse you should tell her mother not only because she could seriously hurt herself but because her mom is your friend and you sound like you care about her kid. So yea u should tell her ASAP.|`|jdah4ZA2aa	If she added you, she trusts you.  Perhaps talk to her yourself about your concern.  Do it in a girlfriend-to-girlfriend way, not as a parental type lecture.  Share some of  your own bad experiences, as you said you've "been around the block."    Know that a lot of teens experiment and turn out fine, though.  Good self-esteem means a lot more to what happens to a girl than her party habits.
pMsMx817aa	the only thing you can do, is be her friend and support her<br>  shes a big girl and needs to make these decisions on her own <br>  <br>  whether or not she got engaged too early is none of our business, every couples different.<br>  <br>  ella|`|gjMJzfoeaa	Leave them be. It's not your place to judge on their financial situation. if he wants her to work, he'd boot her butt from in front of the TV if he wanted to. <br>  <br>  When you first live with someone it is definitely tough, because most of the formalities are off at that point. From the sounds of it, she really didn't have a choice in moving in with him either if she was kicked out of somewhere, so the decision was not mutual and probably both were not ready. <br>  <br>  As for her rubbing in your face, be honest and tell her how that makes you feel and that she should be a better friend. If you don't ever want to hear from her again, tell her that you and your boyfriend see how she and her fiance act and have decided marriage isn't a good idea.|`|aez3cIkvaa	Your friend is a moron and shouldn't be engaged to anyone that early.  Tell her like it is and lay the smackdown on her, with words.|`|E2X6B1Iaaa	ignore her and stay out of her business.|`|D7JZPxDzaa	too early...nah she prob wont listen, but dont worry she'll get divorced|`|VygBNA0Waa	its her life let her make stupid choices|`|GIs1jMhHaa	Yeah, I think it may have been a little to early. It also depends on how old they are as well. It kind of seems like they met each other, got excited, thought they were in love, (I'm not saying that they aren't) and made a decision obviously without thinking about it.   <br>  If your friend doesn't realize how she's acting towards you or what she's doing then I think you should let her learn her lesson herself. Maybe after she'll appreciate you more.
vk1TcfTeaa	eh...it's kinda weird it lasted that long, but some women are chatters and if he's a nice guy, he probably didn't want to just jet out. I'd talk to my man and see what he thinks about her... maybe she was venting. open communication clears confusion.|`|SsfnitjXaa	He kept you waiting 20 minutes and you didn't check on him!!!!!! You should have waited 4 minutes and checked to see if he had had a heart attack.  Then when you saw them talking you could have said "why are you talking to that bimbo".  Heck in 20 minutes they could have had sex.|`|IuJjYz6gaa	The only problem that I see is that if he lied to you when you asked him what took him so long.<br>  <br>  If my husband told me that he got caught up talking to our female neighbor, I would roll my eyes and ask what they talked about.  If he lied to me we would have a huge problem.|`|b165361aa3bdfd3dd4401459ad6b7836aa	I don't think you need to be upset.  I'm sure your husband is just trying to be a good neighbor.  Tell him it bothers you and judge your response off of that.|`|iD4ejChZaa	this one time i'd cut him some slack, but i would be ticked off that she was watching while you got in the car and then she distracted him--to flirt of course.|`|50aafa74f4cd5c99db769abd5513ca2faa	why are you asking us if you should be upset or not?<br>  even a child know his /her emotion <br>  ask yourself this! Do you have reason to?|`|AA10832514	I really am worried for you.  I lost my partner to my best friend in similar circumstances.  There are a couple of sayings that come to mind: <br>  <br>  1.  If it looks like a duck, walks like a duck, and quacks like a duck, its a duck.<br>  2.  Familiarity breeds contempt.  (This means that someone who is close to you is more likely to treat you in a bad manner).<br>  <br>  If your intuition is telling you something's wrong, trust it.  Your husband may not be initiating this "friendship," but his ego may be reacting to the interest she's displaying.<br>  <br>  I would definitely be careful.|`|pMj2lt8Yaa	yes, you should be concerned that woman probably likes your husband I had a friend and her husband started talking to the neighbor all the time they found each other at the laundromat ,halls he ended up divorcing my friend and getting together with the neighbor becareful keep your eyes open|`|DgUq78nQaa	I would ask him if anythings going on, but dont make it seem like your accusing him of something.  I would keep a close eye on this situation.  If I had a female that only talked to my boyfriend I would be upset and wonder too.  So just ask about it.  I hope nothing bad turns out.|`|HLkH0uKMaa	Ha Ha, girl you a fool for sitting in the car for 20 minutes. What did you think it took him 20 minutes to get, the refrigerator. It took him 5 to seduce her 10 to screw her and 5 to clean up and get whatever he left|`|P63n2JENaa	Jello wrestling. It solves every woman-on-woman dispute.|`|ce8kACW4aa	He is sleeping with her watch him
u9IMNd7Iaa	You totally need to tell him how him how you feel, Let him know exactly what you typed: That everytime he gets a GF, he treats you like crap. Explain to him how. Don't get all emotional and cry (because guys aren't going to respond to that), but seriously say that he needs to start being a better friend to you.<br>  <br>  If you talk to him about it, be extra nice to him, and you get nothing back - or worse the same process continues - I'm sorry, but, that friendship might just be dunzo.|`|aCUTP68xaa	just advise him that it isn't fair to treat you bad and that it want hurt his relationship to have you as a Friend.  or he may like you in that way and don't wanna let you down by you seeing it
ijmcG1ziaa	perezhilton.com maybe? im sorry, I'm not too good with this.

I know that everyone else has said this, but it's more detailed than you think. My step-by-step guide is wonderful.<br>  <br>  <br>  1. SHAMPOO-OMG. How important is this? I used Herbal Essences Body Envy. It comes in an orange-yellow bottle. You can get the shampoo and conditioner combined in one. I prefer this because it's alot easier, takes up less space, and when you travel you only have to talk one bottle. I learned this when I was doing my cousin's hair [she's 7]. When she was 3, I was giving her a bath. I didn't know that if you "scrunch" it all up and swirl it around in a circular motion it makes it tangled. You should comb it out straight and then get in the shower and leave it alone. Shampoo it by starting at the roots. Make sure all of it is out of your face. Just make sure to have the shampoo on your hands and run your hands down your hair.<br>  <br>  2. DRY: Avoid towel drying. This makes it all curly and tangled. Comb it out again. If you want more volume, flip your head over and comb it down as you go/dry. Only do this for about 2 minutes or else it will be REALLY thick. I mean stupid thick.<br>  <br>  3. Pull out the straightener and start from where your hair is seperate from your scalp. I do this by feeling it and once I touch it and my hair can't feel it anymore, that's where it is.Start from there and do it straight down. If you do it at an angle [pulling your hair outward] it won't turn out right.<br>  <br>  4. PERMANENCE: Now, I reccomend Biosilk hair gel. If you use the right amount [2-3 dime sized amounts] you can't feel it in there. Just apply it to your roots and it will spread on it's own.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  xoxo ?<br>  Greek Green Dayy|`|lgM3xZkWaa	If you don't already straighten it or your hair isn't naturally straight,I would straighten it.I have long curly hair.I straightened it and it looked like it was 2 inches longer.|`|AA12274970	extensions! you can buy em for cheep at any beauty salon store like Sally's.|`|zNFqe8Iiaa	You can straighten it and umm wrong category!|`|Zqby1cXpaa	extensions|`|miMi9uH3aa	extensions|`|AwXDBoASaa	straighten it.|`|pgAcX782aa	let it grow or just straighten it|`|2c4oLCOqaa	straighten it|`|KTtf0GLlaa	straighten it out ... or get extensions|`|yJTaBGoEaa	Straighten it ! =)|`|hH76CdQ1aa	When ur hair is straight it looks logner. thats really all i can think of.<br>  <br>  help me please??!!<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090219175843AAzaH0t">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a>|`|gbYBkNpCaa	ummmm no such way..<br>  <br>  and wrong section.|`|ZkrIJtbTaa	weave|`|yNYZdlwkaa	There are two ways.  One of which is really easy, it is to flat iron or straighten your hair.  It  makes your hair the longest possible and by smoothing out all of the bumps, and helping it to lay completely flat on your head.  Which does make it the longest possible.  A way to add an illusion of longer hair would be to add highlights and/or low lights to your hair.  It helps to draw the eye up and down to follow the line of your highlights.  Thus helping with the illusion of longer hair!  <br>  <br>  Good luck!!  If not theres always extensions!|`|7V7iQBZSaa	hair extensions, are u stupid?|`|H61OKQJRaa	This question is not in the right place, however, you can make your look longer by melting on extensions or straighten your hair if its curly|`|XfhSYCtDaa	you straighten it.

ajgC0KPhaa	She is not crazy. I don't think you would be friends with her if she were crazy.<br>  <br>  She is a little stubborn. She obviously hasn't gotten over her depression.

Kd0kwQmUaa	Hey girl, Just tell the friend throwing the party you don't want the 2nd friend to get hurt. Maybe she'll understand. But if she doesn't (this is what I would do, but it might not sound like a good idea to you), go on "strike" and don't go to the second friend's party, and hang with the other girl. This way you will show loyalty and your friend will love you for this! God bless! ?|`|aCUTP68xaa	you cant make the person let them go. but you should talk to them and tell them she cant help how her parents raised her. she will come around

Ask for help.  Immerse yourself in German culture.<br>  2)  Look into the exchange program.  Who knows, maybe you would like to be an exchange student.  Where do they go?  Who do they stay with?  What's it like?<br>  You just need help all over the place with these mutual interests that you have, don't you?  (grin)<br>  3) Every time you see him, say a little something in German.  He will certainly notice that, and it will comfort him.|`|6weK7biNaa	Ask him a question like, hey! did you do the homework?<br>  <br>  I was interested in this one guy and I had no idea who he was, what grade he was in, or what his name was. I saw him in a classroom during lunch time and I decided to ask him what his ethnic backround was (it was hard to tell). He told me he was Irish and Chinese. We started having a conversation and we exchanged myspaces.<br>  <br>  So start to talk to him!|`|i60NTzqaaa	Talk to him in german if he knows any! Say this:<br>  <br>  Hallo! So sprechen Sie irgendwie Deutsches?<br>  <br>  Which means Hey!

XQe8rlH7aa	Congratulations on your engagement!!  As far as you fiance being open and "soft" in front of you, sometimes it is harder for men to open up, however, it can be done. Let him know that you are there for him completely by listening to him and being sensitive to the things that he does share.  <br>  <br>  Do you freak out when he says the slightest thing or are you constantly asking him what's wrong and what's going on? If he is one who has lived his life keeping his feeling close to his chest all of his secret fears and dreams are not going to be shared in one night.  So be patient with him, the fact that he has asked you to marry him gives you an incling of how he feels about you, he wants to spend the rest of his life with you!!<br>  <br>  Just give him more time, you have your whole life to share...SMILE<br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|ce8kACW4aa	maybe he does not miss u
RDgyb7W8aa	Warn her about STDs and tell her she should some respect for herself. The boys are making fun of her behind her back.|`|ijmcG1ziaa	tell her:<br>  whether you think you can, or you think you can't you're right.<br>  <br>  I know corny, but it's true, and she can always change no mater how hard or not.  It just depends on whether that's what she wants or not.  <br>  <br>  As her friend<br>  <br>  make it something she wants.<br>  <br>  best of luck<br>  <br>  EDIT:  pick the guy who answered below me as best answer, I agree completely.|`|MYO2k9EUaa	You should stop being her friend before you get in trouble. If she really really wanted to change, she would have changed by now. She's just leading you on.|`|69fa948353d1dbf575b7e1dd974f6570aa	Say " Don't put his dick in your mouth please" or some thing I would say that to one of my friends.|`|pcI25NXzaa	Tell her if she's trying to be cool, it's not going to be so cool once she gets a crazy STD.|`|YPaZEbulaa	let her do what she wants its her life most likley she does it cause she just enjoys it and doesnt understand the consequences in the long run it might just be a phase she is going through and wants to seem cool and it makes her feel popular  she might just grow out of it|`|UIRQ6hjPaa	that she will never find love|`|hvcjyEmDaa	Her problems are beyond what you can do for her. Tell her she needs to talk to a school counselor or school psychologist. She feels very bad about herself. She has low self-esteem, otherwise she wouldn't behave that way. Tell her you love her and want to stick by her, but you think she needs help since this is so hard for her to stop. Good luck.
QxS0Kcg0aa	sounds like some sort of stress maybe? or something big going on in their life?|`|7511595fc4d3e31538e8df239de8a7c5aa	it's a bunch of bunk.|`|XOgvpDiZaa	Are the two of them twins? The whole twin telepathy thing is true and such.
bID1Pd7Gaa	You just asked this question an hour ago.|`|AA12392755	Of course you are to blame.  If you didn't want to make him jealous and cause trouble, you would not have sent the first text in the first place.  You asked for it, now live with it.|`|CzAwjF76aa	Ummm..Yes! Who allows the freind of a guy who is dating her freind into a bed with her? Getting closer and closer. You were asking for trouble.|`|AA11603529	You should have told the other guy to get out of your bed. When he didn't get a message back he assumed whatever his mind could think up. He was upset and you should explain immediately.|`|T4N6a7MQaa	Yes you probably were. You weren't specific about what you were doing. Most likely he thought you were having a sexual encounter.|`|yM8NiXmLaa	yes|`|sUKKnd6Raa	yes. you shoulda slept on the floor. any guy would have been mad about this.|`|3YIjKQTEaa	Obviously he didn't know the full situation but from the info he got I can see why he reacted like he did. you said you were sharing a bed with some one else.     if you were not happy about it though you should of told the guy to get out. It's slightly odd sharing a bed with some one you don't know, no matter what happens.|`|XAd3gV6Zaa	You did it to yourself by telling him in the first place.|`|X9RBRqL2aa	dude, dont send that text if your phone is about to die. on the other end all he knew was that you were in a bed with another dude and then never answered so to him that meant that you were gettin it on or didnt care. you messed up big time. all you can do is ask for him to forgive you and just give it time.|`|lUSknAQtaa	I think you know the answer to your own question. Of course it was inappropiate otherwise you wouldnt feel so bad...and to say the guy was getting closer and closer then u know its triflin what you were allowing to happen.|`|HRNKJUYuaa	YES!  in general...  you've done something wrong  fix it    you'll know what to do ;)|`|3JfADTIDaa	I don't know, but now you see what happens when he is upset. He hates you now? Just like that? That sounds pretty immature!  It totally did seem that you were sleeping with someone else though, seeing that your phone died right after you said you were in bed with him.
