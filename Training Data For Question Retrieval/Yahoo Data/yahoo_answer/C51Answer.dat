owzmt7lDaa	The majority of Meth does come from Latin American countries, so in that sense YES.<br>  <br>  There are white hispanics, black hispanics, native american hispanics, mestizo hispanics, mulatto hispanics and even asian hispanics (japanese peruvians).|`|DFJ9m4WKaa	The majority of meth is controlled by white biker gangs and mexican drug cartels. While meth is mainly used by rual whites and hispanics, it is steadily gaining ground in Eastern states and large cities. It is cheap and easy to produce. Crystal meth (ice, glass) is a much more potent form of meth that is mass produced in super labs controlled by Mexican drug lords. But some chemist in the states can produce it in smaller quantities. Basically if you can bake a cake, you can make meth.<br>  <br>  I live in northern Colorado, a fairly rual area. And meth use is about 50/50 between whites and hispanics. Around Denver meth is more commonly used to cut ecstacy or mixed with cocain and heroin. This not some statistical event, I know because I was a meth user, until I saw first hand how it can destroy lives and families. Either way my experience with drugs in general as shown me that meth doesn't know any racial or cultural boundries. And it is steadily taking over marijuana as the cheif source of income made by drug cartels accross the states.|`|emNCaAq7aa	In my large city meth is mostly used by poor Whites only, not Blacks or Hispanics. <br>  My city did not have crack for years because one of the main gang leaders in the Black community refused to have his people bring it in, make it or sell it. so there was none because of holds on  distribution.<br>  I think the same thing has happened with meth. The manufacture is controlled by White gangs as is the basic distribution. They have not made inroads into the Black communities.<br>  There may be another factor. The Blacks in general seem to want an escape, crack and heroin give them an escape. The whites just want to get high. Meth is cheap and lasts a long time. Meth makes you think way to much and can be a very uncomfortable high.<br>  For that same reason PCP never had a big impact on the blacks in my area, it was a White and Hispanic drug.<br>  PCP and meth can be made in any rural area, population density affects detection.  Cocaine and opiate drugs tend to be urban since the basic drug needs to be imported.<br>  I'm sure in different towns there are different patterns.|`|4TD4xg5Xaa	I have seen mostly whites use meth. I have also seen Mexicans and one black use meth.|`|epbzW5N8aa	I see a lot of Blacks and Indians use it , I describe it as a equal opportunity destroyer.

SGwkPy62aa	In all seriousness, you do need to be stashing a certain amount of cash.  With what is occurring in the banking industry, many banks are of the edge of bankruptcy.  Now the FDIC insures your money, so it is not that you will completely lose you money, but there is a delay.  Look back at what has happened every time the FDIC has to step in and take over a bankrupt bank.  They lock the doors and freeze the accounts.  Once they have reviewed the records, the accounts are unfrozen.  If you do not have a cash stash, what are you going to do for money during the delay period.  Your account is frozen.|`|f4Yec6iNaa	The risk is mattress stuffing cash not viable as the government can easily confiscate the purchasing power of your money through inflation.<br>  <br>  Mattress stuffing precious metals is a much better idea, as the government cannot control it.|`|BQdXnCcHaa	I tried that but the liberals were squeaking too much so I eventually had to let them go.|`|ixOE0onnaa	yes to you thanks to:|`|6J899sxpaa	As long as you have a means of defending it(gun) it sounds like the best option left.

How on earth can you blame Nancy Pelosi for the economic crisis, the banking failure, the looting of the U.S. Treasury by George W. Bush and his willing cohorts?  How on earth can you invent and create, ignore and excuse, twist and distort facts to make the Speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi, responsible for this economic disaster, clearly caused by the lack of rules and regulation for the banking industry? <br>  <br>  What you are repeating is called "The Party Line," as developed by Rush Limbaugh.  It's called Utter Nonsense and can be cured by reading history books, magazines and scientific journals.

They did their worst to reward their special interests if not being indecisive altogether. Enjoy the kool-aid Obamabot!|`|2kgTdNRQaa	What plan?  Republicans were tripping into each other bashing Obama's plan, but when asked for their own republican plan, they couldn't come up with any. ...Lil....|`|t3QAaSN9aa	If they were truthful they would admit that it's because he was a complete disaster and his Republican economic policies put the country into this awful situation. Deregulation, record deficits, useless spending on unnecessary war, tax cuts for the wealthy, silly trickle down theories, letting businesses run amok without oversight, etc. all contributed to our current economic meltdown.|`|0jmVA50Jaa	Bush is fed up.  He has walked away and now loves being a Rancher.     He would not help anyone now.    Even some Republicans , stayed their distance.   Cheney has now  retreated to a Wheel chair.     Both of these two Republicans have brought shame to their Party.      Their Plan has never been presented or activated.     So now the Republicans continue to dog on the  elected one, thinking if they can shoot at Obama, it will take the guilt away from them .   Put Obama down to make them look better.|`|724634aa550e4f2aa216e83840f9e8a4aa	Well seeing how the left is letting Barny Frank, Chris Dodd and Maxine Waters tell us what to do.....and not even worrying they were the same three that said in 2005, 2006 and 2007.<br>  <br>  "There is no problem at Fannie Mae"..... when being warned that if not fixed would collapse the economy in three hearings..<br>  <br>  So guess we shouldn't even be ranting about blaming Bush for a plan...

Most say that Bush wasn't responsible for the economy failure, he has little control over what Wall Street does.|`|avcjtqGtaa	Awww, losing faith in the great black hope already?  What a fickle breed you liberals are.<br>  <br>  I've said repeatedly you can't have it both ways.  Either Bush was a brilliant mastermind who drug our nation to war in an effort to steal the mid-easts, get revenge for his father and create an easy opening for the saudi's to take over; or, he's incompetent.  Then again there's the truth that he was a mediocre president who put America and her interests first which enraged the far left who hates our nation and our ideals anyway.  <br>  <br>  Anyway, since you are such a narrow minded liberal (yea it's an oxymoron but it works) take what you want from this but fact is Dems got us in this mess and until obammy's out of office or we take back the senate in the mids it will continue to get worse.  You folks have pizzed off more than a trillion dollars in under three months and devastated this economy with things that won't get paid back for over a century without indebting ourselves to a foreign power.<br>  <br>  Have a day.|`|WL3KcegWaa	Because he isn't the president anymore....<br>  <br>  <br>  Unlike Carter and Clinton, the George H.W.

The people in the HMO can go outside their provider's, but the cost is more. That's the way it's set up.<br>  If I am  in a car wreck, I do not get to chose which doctor I get either, if I am in Nevada  (not my home state) for example I get what I get. <br>  <br>  I agree that doctors and patients should make their own medical decisions, yet everyone pays when a patient or doctor elects a test or procedure that is not necessary or excessive to the general care.<br>  <br>  I have a friend whose doctor wanted him to get a chest x-ray during a routine physical. (A procedure not necessary) and the insurance refused to pay because it was a frivolous test. Other doctors may make a "diagnoses" requiring an x-ray that will be paid by insurance when the procedure is not necessary. The democrats have held congress and the senate the majority of the last 40 years, so it seems a bit unfair to blame the Republicans as you are.|`|yvPA8FSsaa	You are being misled if you believe this is the fault of Republicans.  I am old enough to remember life before HMO's.  The original concept for HMO's was strictly a Democrat initiative lead by Ted Kennedy.  Before that, what everyone had was called "Hospitalization Insurance".  <br>  <br>  Hospitalization Insurance paid for your expenses if you required a stay in the hospital.  You paid out of pocket for your regular doctor visits.  Doctors competed for patients and fought to keep them once they had them.  This was what Private Practice was all about.  They charged what would be the equivalent to about $35 in today's dollars per visit but were free to charge as much or as little as they wanted.  Often, if you had a condition that required regular visits he would give you a discount or even free simple follow ups.  <br>  <br>  Large families often got a break.  Regular patients would be billed instead of paying on the spot.  You had a closer relationship with your "family doctor" and most would remain with the same doctor for many years.  <br>  <br>  As is typical with Liberal Democrat ideas, the HMO idea was seriously flawed.  Designed on the concept of paying doctors to keep you well, by providing preventative care the result was something far different.  Originally, the cost of an office visit was free.  As you might expect, no one stayed with their family physician were you had to pay per visit and clamored to join HMO's where you could see the doctor anytime for free.<br>  <br>  Soon, the offices were jam packed with patients.  People would go to the doctor for any minor malady.  Why not?  It was free.  Whereas people would think twice about going to the doctor for $35 a visit there was no longer any reason not to go.<br>  <br>  Participating Doctors took most all the patients away from those who were not.  But the level of care was nowhere near as good.  In a HMO the doctors see far too many patients to even remember your name.  You are lucky if you get ten minutes with the doctor.  <br>  <br>  As is usually the case in America, Government sticks its nose into private industry, spends loads of money and makes everything much worse.  Now they believe the solution is to have the Government take over Health Care entirely.  Well, if they do, if you think you would enjoy having your healthcare provided in a system akin to the Department of Motor Vehicles you will love it.  <br>  <br>  Me, I prefer the Government stop interfering in private matters.<br>  <br>  *|`|SGwkPy62aa	I have an HMO and was given a long list of approved doctors, of which I choose the one I wanted.  I also had the choice of three different HMO and a regular health insurance policy.  So, how was my health care rationed.

You wait in line in the clinics or emergency for hours, 4 or 5 usually. You put in an application for a family doctor, if he likes what he sees, he will take you as a patient. You have NO IDEA what you are getting into if the government takes control. If you think it is bad now, just wait and see. It will be ten times worse then it is now to see a doctor. You have 310,000,000 people, we have only 27,000,000. There is not enough beds in the hospitals, there is not enough equipment, there is waiting lines for operations.

Yet, oddly there is sympathy for turning over our most private, personal decisions, not to mention one sixth of our economy, to the same unresponsive, anti-entrepreneurial culture that gave us the response to Hurricane Katrina. Our two largest government-run health programs- Medicare, and Medicaid- are fiscal crash courses that make social security seem like a model of solvency.

It is already rationed by insurance companies to those who have insurance and those who have $$ to pay for it. If you cannot access it; it IS rationed! I am so tired of the horror stories about socialism and denied care. Our system is outright stupidity exemplified!<br>  <br>  Ever spiraling costs and rationing by insurance companies who are unwilling to pay for treatment if it negatively impacts their bottom line. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  You have asked a question that is rarely asked!<br>  <br>  The health care system in the US is touted as paramount. But, if the average person had trouble accessing it then how good is it really. It is only good for those who have access to it. I am hearing the same arguments already being floated around again that we saw in the early nineties when the Clinton administration wanted to do something about the state of the spiraling costs and rationing as you call it.<br>  <br>  Rationing takes place and people indeed die because decisions are now made largely by insurance companies who are reluctant to  turn loose of profits so that those that are ill can get care. Sometimes they die for lack of care that they have paid insurance for.<br>  <br>  The reluctance to tackle this problem must be overcome. The attitude of many Americans that each person must be left on their own, otherwise there is rampant welfare and unfair "redistribution" of wealth. We will have to overcome this if we are to get widespread access to health care for all.<br>  <br>  This underlying problem causes us to be unwilling to correct this problem and also stunts the growth of this great nation. This has helped to promote and secure this ridiculous "for massive profit" system. Thousands of the poorest in our country suffer and die because of our current attitudes towards governenment.<br>  <br>  It has to do with a fairytale that is perpetrated  that everyone has the possibility to attain vast wealth if they are only willing to work hard. It is indeed a myth. Simply research the stats. Almost no one moves more that a couple rungs on the ladder no matter how hard they work. The richest have been the richest for generations. This story is how the haves are able to convince voters that they should vote the interests of the wealthy and the corporatocracy. "Maybe one day I'll be one of the rich" is what they tell themselves. <br>  <br>  Until we stop voting for a government that actively works to destroy the middle class and make sure the wealthiest have every advantage, we are doomed to continue a path to third world status. The middle class, the life-blood of our Democracy, are dying and it is a quiet and little noticed death!

aYNoQvfMaa	Something I like specifically about the bill is it's going to create jobs. Looking back during the hardest economic time in our nation, Roosevelt basically created jobs any way he could, even if the job was just digging a hole, filling it up, and digging it up again. Any job, for any amount of time helps, it's not a permanent fix, but we don't need that now. I think many Republicans think we need to creates careers, but we can't right now, it's too early, we can do that when we are more economically stable.<br>  <br>  Something I dislike, we can all agree the foundation of our economic woes is the collapse of the housing market, correct? In the bill, though, no significant money is going to repair that situation. How can we resolve our issues in any significant way if we're not putting money into the foundation of the problem.<br>  <br>  It's not going to solve our problems, I think way too many people are expecting way too much way too early from Obama, but I think it will help.|`|3c91df9cab412a7ca4201cdaf64121e3aa	Well, the bill is a bill that is supposed to get some money moving in our nation as well as get some jobs for people and/or help people keep their current jobs.  <br>  <br>  The good part is that it is putting a bunch of money into the economy - the huge debate is how it is being put into the economy.  Many don't like the way it is being spent, and many would also like to see more tax cuts and not so much spending.<br>  <br>  The bad part is the amount of money that is being spent.  It is very expensive, and it is money we really don't have to spend.  But I think the economy is beyond the amount of money and more about getting things going.<br>  <br>  In a nut shell, the money is going to things like education, health care, and the environment (all of which Republicans see as "pork barrel spending" - a way of saying wasted spending).  How anyone can see those as a waste of money is beyond me.  But again, I look at the source, and understand why they think that.<br>  <br>  That is it - a very general overview.

Because he's Republican and is trying to maintain his popularity, rather than doing what is necessary to make sure that the peoples' wishes are actually carried out.

It's exactly the same way here.  Honestly, I don't think anyone wants to pay taxes, but it's the only way that the government (either state OR federal) is going to get money to operate on.  Despite what anyone wants to admit, we rely on our government for a heck of a lot.  I know lots of people gripe about the roads having pot holes, the problems with education, etc., but no one wants to pay out of their own pockets for it.  I don't see random people buying road equipment, gravel, tar, and everything else to repair pot holes themselves.  They expect the government to do it.

AA10719402	Bad idea.<br>  <br>  It would inevitably hurt the country you are trying to save.  If they have higher prices on their primary product goods, they will be less competitive and buyers will search out cheaper product.  <br>  <br>  Since they are primary product as well (oil, land resources, agri, minerals, etc.) they also have the problem with those goods having low income elasticity meaning countries do not buy more as they get richer.<br>  <br>  The only way this would have any "clout" behind it would be if all poorer nations developed a trade union similar to our NAFTA... free trade within themselves while charging tariffs on richer countries.

2elJq4THaa	This may be a bar to you being recruited and there's no point in you even trying until 5 years have elapsed since the caution, as 5 years is the time period for which previous cautions are considered in criminal investigations.<br>  <br>  Regarding your comment 'if I declare it', if you don't declare it then you will definitely be rejected as this will show an issue with your integrity if you don't declare it.  The Police checks go as high as possible when checking possible candidates for the job so everything about your past convictions will be revealed and its better that you disclose it than them finding out about it themselves.<br>  <br>  It may be however that this caution prevents you from joining the job as its a dishonesty offence.<br>  <br>  The best way to find out is by contacting the Police service to which you are applying and ask them.|`|ichCJlWyaa	Just keep your mouth shut and you'll be fine. A caution is "i think" only on record for 2 years but thats only relevant if you reoffend again.<br>  <br>  So chill your boots - your fully free to become a pig. oink oink :)|`|ARAYm7BLaa	As long as you declare it you should be o.k....we all deserve a second chance.|`|3y9AlP6Raa	There is a runout time for certain offences.   In your case I couldn`t specify<br>  Your best bet is to go to the Police Station where you were cautioned and ask them.<br>  If you are too frightened or embarrassed to do so then you won`t be much cop at being.........a cop (sorry)<br>  Whatever the situation you must nevertheless declare the caution.<br>  When I was in Police Training College, a bloke I knew was kicked out for a caution he had received at the age of 12 for flogging apples.<br>  The reason was...simply,because he hadn`t declared it.<br>  <br>  This may help.........<br>  <a href="https://www.askthe.police.uk/content/faqquicksearch.mth?searchtext=arrest#searchresults_toggle#searchresults_toggle" rel="nofollow">https://www.askthe.police.uk/content/faq...</a><br>   <br>  A caution is a formal warning that is given to an adult who has admitted the offence. If the person refuses the caution then they will normally be prosecuted through the normal channels for the offence. <br>  <br>  Although it is not technically classed as a conviction it can be taken into consideration by the Courts if the person is convicted of a further offence. <br>  <br>  Cautions are now covered by the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974 so will become spent immediately (apart from conditional cautions which will become spent after 3 months). This means that if you are asked on an application form if you have a caution you can reply 'no'. For conditional cautions it would be after 3 months since the caution was issued, up until that time you would have to reply 'yes'.<br>  <br>  This applies retrospectively so applies to anyone who has ever had a caution, irrelevant of when it was given. <br>  <br>  However, this does not mean that it will not be disclosed on a CRB check. It will not normally be disclosed on a standard check but maybe disclosed on an enhanced check and on a subject access request - see below for more information.<br>  <br>  <br>  Depending on the type of offence cautions are 'stepped down' after a set period of time (5 or 10 years). This basically means that they will only be visible to police staff and not other agencies who do checks. The exception to this is if a person is the subject of an Enhanced Disclosure and then if relevant it will be disclosed.<br>  <br>  Even after five/ten years the caution can still be disclosed if you apply for certain types of jobs, i.e. police, teacher, or jobs working with children and vulnerable adults. It will be disclosed if it is relevant to the job you are applying for.<br>  <br>  Cautions will always remain on a person's record but as explained above will be stepped down after 5 or 10 years. There are only exceptional circumstances when a caution could be removed from a person's record and it is anticipated that such incidents will be rare. Examples of such possible circumstances are that it was found that the original arrest or sample was unlawful or where it was found beyond all doubt that no offence existed. Any requests that fit the above criteria should be directed to the Chief Constable of the force concerned.|`|ASJlcmTgaa	They take this into consideration.  It will need to be put down on the application form (first stage of many) and since you have been clean since then I dont see why not.

As far as I know, the government can easily declare war by doing so.<br>  <br>  BUT: Unlike the US (where the government/president is head of the armed forces) in Germany only the parlament can give order to the troops. And it is forbidden to use the armed forces within the Germany.<br>  <br>  Germany is a very peaceful country after the shocks of two lost world wars. Parlament even is very hard on sending more troops to Afghanistan and would only do it for many allowences (e.g. only in north of country, more civilian help, no taking part in fighting missions...)

YOU NEED A BETTER LAWYER. If you feel that the lawyer is not protecting you, you might be correct that there are issues relating to these lawyers who regularly deal with that judge. I realize most persons expect courts to be "fair", but I am here to swear that there are places where what you describe, DOES happen. <br>  For one.. any modifying of primary custody has to include "best interest" of the children. If dad was not able to prove he was capable, and if the judge ignored you being JUST as capable.. then he relied on the wishes of the children, against evidence or proof. <br>  Children in cps custody CAN BE placed with the other parent, and unless they have evidence that you are a risk to the children, that would be normal. <br>  I'll agree that the judge might be attempting to cover up his bad decision from before. Proving this is going to take a lot. If your prior lawyer is the same as you have now.. he/she is not very good, considering what happened the first time out. <br>  To the best of what I know (am not a lawyer).. the state CANNOT allow your children to be adopted, without termination of YOUR rights. The ruling on custody to your ex, was NOT a termination of your rights, and they would have to prove you unfit to do anything further. <br>  start by getting full copies of all the paperwork behind the original ruling, and looking for a lawyer outside your locality.|`|zVFKk8eCaa	Before I can answer your question, I need some more details. Do you have an attorney? Do you trust them? If you don't have one get one, NOW. If you do and you trust them, talk to them and see if they can petition to have a new judge assigned to your case. If you don't trust them, fire them, NOW. Also, research child custody laws in your state. And contact your Social Services Director. It seems unusual that they would place children in a foster home if the mother was never claimed unfit. I wish you the best of luck.

PyDaH2wyaa	Here is an excerpt from the New York State Vehicle and Traffic Law :<br>  <br>  2. (a) Except as otherwise provided in this section, no person shall operate a motor vehicle upon a public highway while using a mobile telephone to engage in a call while such vehicle is in motion. (b) An operator of a motor vehicle who holds a mobile telephone to, or in the immediate proximity of his or her ear while such vehicle is in motion is presumed to be engaging in a call within the meaning of this section. The presumption established by this subdivision is rebuttable by evidence tending to show that the operator was not engaged in a call.<br>  <br>  So the question becomes: <br>  1) Was the phone "in the proximity of your ear"?<br>  2) Can you prove that you were not engaged in a call at the time?|`|uh2bkRrFaa	Yes, I agree with everyone else, you're clearly not telling us the whole story.

jJDN2Uhpaa	It's based on state ownership of capital, so you could cite the fourth and fifth amendments. We are protected from unreasonable search and seizure, and cannot be deprived of life, liberty or property without due process of law.<br>  <br>  If the government were to purchase capital during a recession, they could accomplish this without breaching either amendment. Simply putting strong controls on key industries could constitute acting in a socialistic manner.<br>  <br>  Public education and government health care services are both socialist institutions.|`|W1IYbXY5aa	As long as the constitution is still followed, it would not. The constitution guarantees the right to free elections and the 3 branches of government- judicial, legislative and executive. The founding fathers wanted to form a government that would not allow one person to have too much control. They did not specify in the constitution that America was to be free market vs. socialist. There have been socialist countries that had one person in control- "dictators"- and it worked out poorly. But it is possible to have "democratic socialism"- with the government being elected by the people. America can move towards nationalization of industries and banks, which woud be a trend towards socialism, but as long as our governmenntal structure didn't change it would not be unconstitutional.|`|rXUAUmt9aa	Yes, because the citizens who wrote the Constitution meant to keep the federal government in check by limiting it's power and keeping the states sovereign. With Obama in office, just the opposite is occurring at an alarming rate with designs of complete federal control over everything. 20+ states have reacted by enacting sovereignty legislation to protect themselves. He is running this country like a community organizer in Chicago.|`|o1PuFnWmaa	Yes, because full out socialism takes independent rights away from you and I, and it makes the GOVERNMENT in charge, rather than the PEOPLE.<br>  The first 7 words of the US Constitution say it all<br>  "We the PEOPLE of the United States..."<br>  <br>  Correction Dr T..<br>  That's the 10th amendment, not the 12th.|`|eafeb487799eda2a8dd4f1d8cb95f9c8aa	Yes.  The federal government is not supposed to have powers not enumerated to it in the Constitution.  Those powers go only to the state.  Therefore nationalizing banks, etc is unconstitutional.|`|ZZZgZ764aa	I would argue that re-distribution policy violates unreasonable search an seizure and eminent domain laws.|`|KcAehrrKaa	The ones who wrote it  didn't intend for your country to be socialist.|`|AA10429228	We already are, in SO many ways.<br>  It's not too late to stop it, folks.|`|rS9aIhxkaa	The US constitution only deals with the three branches of government (executive; legislative; and judiciary) and the legal status of the constitution itself, while the amendments primarily deal with the political rights of people. Therefore the US could adopt measures similar to the 'socialist experiment' of France in the 1960s & 70s, where changes are primarily economic, but could not go as far as the stalinist system of the soviet union which requires a fundamental change of government, society and the economy.|`|9w9UHyCNaa	Yes.

God, you people.....every time some official makes a decision, the first thing that falls out of your mouth is "recall them".<br>  No, they should not be "recalled".  Have you even bothered to read some of the information they are imparting about WHY they don't want those funds?  They have very valid reasons for refusing.  Some cite the fact that its like putting a bandaid over a severed artery; and once the funds (their state's portion) are exhausted, they will have to raise business taxes to pay for the extra aid.  And the "extra aid" is mandatory; not an option.<br>  I think they are making a judgment call based on their state's needs and abilities.|`|AA11928155	That's the same thing that is going on with the banks and the auto makers. Nothing is free.

It seems that medicine is the only industry where you can arbitrarily increase your rates 10% or more every year just to increase profits, without loosing customers. If a cable company tried to jack their rates up 10% every single year to make more money, their customers would all go to DirectTV. Only in the medical industry does this work.

fghgwE2waa	Hi. You might have noticed that there are houses that have foreclosure signs in or around your neiborhood. Well a few years back many people were buying house's that they really couldn't afford but the banks loaned these people money. Well that's when the housing market bubble busted. People stopped paying house payments. Many banks were bought buy other banks. That caused panic among all that had money in those banks & Stock Market. The bank asked for money from the government which they received but not all the banks are giving loans to people. They are taking exspensive vacations. Well then the auto dealerships asked for billions & the government gave them billions. The stimulus package now is to help the people to make house payments and much more. In the long run you & the next generations will pay higher taxes to pay all the money back to the government.<br>  There is more to it but I am sure I would bore you. Peace|`|3a082722cea27ba378a88a859b07202daa	It is all about prying the money out of the rich money grubbers hands and bringing a sense of confidence back to the those same people to invest in Americas future|`|b31dbdcb27d3c5c8df1a7f8d790d7ae8aa	It is basically short-term thinking which will entail a long-term debt load for tax payers. You simply cannot increase taxation in the midst of a deep recession. "The Package" relies heavily upon raising taxes on businesses (both large and small) to cover extra aid dollars. This is counter-productive in that these same businesses will react by cutting expenses through raising prices and yet more layoffs.<br>  TO PABLO: It is the "rich, money-grubbers" who create jobs for the public. Just some Econ 101 for you, if you punish small businesses through wildfire taxation they will cut expenses by way of raising prices and more layoffs. You'll understand this much better when you advance to the seventh grade.|`|4eLzY2hfaa	it's a collosal money grab,  steal from the doers, and give to the takers under the guise of fairness.  the government has created a massive debt, that you, as a minor will spend your working life repaying via your taxes!  remember!  regardless of what they say ANY elected official's top priority is to get theirselves re-elected.  advocacy  for the constituents is far down the list, if it is there at all!  power first ,and they WILL take any cash or perks that "fall their way". good luck, you'll need it!|`|e380b6c435d028a856da0ab58ab394f2aa	It's a $1.2 trillion reward to democrats for having a successful election.<br>  <br>  Even a minor will understand what printing $1 trillion would do to any economy.

um87XJvmaa	Our daughters went through an excellent public school system and both did very well in college.  It is the parents choice and responsibly to spend the money on private school.|`|a0ea30926acdfeb82a6d6f9ca13bcc69aa	Private.  Never public.  Our high school graduation rate is only around 50%.  Even the ones graduating score nearly the lowest in our state.<br>  <br>  Our public schools cried to everyone that they needed more money and the tax levy passed last November.  What did they do with all of this "needed" money?  So far they've hired a PR firm for over $100k to improve the image of the school to the community and they raised the new administrator's salary by $20k.  The kids are still failing tests.<br>  <br>  Ummmm...do you realize that some public schools have uniforms?  Some of our public elementary schools do.  Blue or black pants (no jeans) and a white or light blue button down shirt.  Dark colored shoes.|`|WTHTVJN6aa	If you can afford it, private school is the better option.<br>  <br>  I went to private school and I did not like the uniforms as a kid, but now as an adult I appreciate them.

I've known kids that graduate from the best private schools that end up selling drugs with no employment and I've seen kids who went to public school go on to excel in business or college and lead productive lives. At the end of the day . . it really will not matter one way or the other if a child goes to a public or private school . .what is important is that the child learn how to learn. That is the key.  <br>  <br>  Most people just decide based on how much they can afford . . most middle class people will choose to keep their child close by in the public schools and save their money to help their child go to college.|`|lMKy9Ho8aa	well, i had male relatives who went to private schools and did excel academically and morally.<br>  However, I myself went to public schools and STILL excelled in the above categories.<br>  I think it depends on how the child is raised at HOME, more than anything else.<br>  My daughters currently go to public schools; but, I wish they went to private schools; only because there is more violence and instability in public schools here in Los Angeles.|`|urpDar66aa	public, there's nothing wrong with them they have gifted programs,<br>  extracurricular activities, and Honor classes and they have a variety of students not just 15 people per grade like some (a lot) of private schools do, they also have high test scores, and at private school kids might be more prone to rebel because everything is TOO structured.|`|84726b724d7d1fd7da09652c50425c38aa	Well, I don't have any children, but if I have the money, I will send them to private school.

We looked at the curriculums and advantages/disadvantages of both and the decision was easy to make.  The private schools provided a far more extensive academic program, with teachers that were able to provide more individualized personal attention, and in particular, more attention to the individual academic needs of each child.  Children deserve the best that their parents can provide.  I am not degrading public school education, it just is what it is.  An inferior product right now in too many of our school districts.  And many parents who cannot afford to send their kids to private school supplement that inferior education at home the best they can.  <br>  <br>  Of course each child should be guaranteed a free education.  But it's not a reason to ignore that yes, private schools offer more than the public schools are able to do.  It's just fantasy to pretend otherwise.|`|M7uRUzSKaa	There are problems with both. A public school doesn't focus on every child as much but you will fit in out of school as a parent and not look like a snob unlike a private school, where they will focus on every child's education but out of school you will look like a snob and might become socially outcast. It's your choice|`|Dqk3uuwzaa	Neither, home-schooling is best.

However, the REAL issue is that we have banned gay couples from adopting in several states, so if they want a family, there isn't much hope through adoption. Unfortunately, many millions of people...gay and straight...will spend thousands of dollars to create an embryo for themselves....instead of going down to their local CPS office and applying to be an adoptive parent to a child in legitimate need of a family. Since 4 states now DENY gay people AND single people that ability, it isn't any wonder that more of them are turning towards in-vitro.|`|0f6a1cdae0a3ce3617b1109a091741bdaa	Although I am against gay marriage, yes, I would support the use of in vitro fertilization if a gay couple wanted a child. Homosexuality is not a mere lifestyle...it is inborn...so the child would not necessarily follow that same path. The only problem with it that I see is the stigma that is still attached to gays in general...and that could definitely affect the child when he or she got out in society.

I stand by what I have always said if you truly love a child then you can adopt many of the unwanted in our society.Bringing an infant into that extreme enviroment will breed more of them,not less.And if you can only love just the infant well you already have a problem with motherhood,and you are not fit.|`|96e391ed38447964faf042cf980c1571aa	I think they should have every right to.

As our population is aging, and the average age per capita is getting older, many gays and lesbians are feeling the need to become parents and have a family including marriage and raising children. Issues of gay adoption have been on the rise and now there are things like this addressing gay and lesbian needs to have their own children.<br>  There are some professions in which groups like the Catholic church are finding ways to weed out gay and lesbian teachers by being suspect of single teachers and teachers who do not have children. So there is an economic need among gays and lesbians to become married and parents out of economic survival. Marriage and parenting is a way for these people to assimilate. <br>  So this is a round about way of explaining the need for gays to have ornaments like kids. But straight people also have needs to marry and have ornaments. Many wealthy individuals get increases in family money if they marry and have children, and this might force a person who may be content to remain single to marry and have children out of an economic necessity. <br>  To answer your question, I would say no. But I might change my mind based on the circumstances. The idea of a gay man manipulating cells to produce offspring and using a female as a surrogate is too Sci Fi for me.|`|ksoMldqYaa	First of all, having children period is a selfish act, there is not one reason you can give me that does not have a selfish basis.  That being said, humans are selfish creatures, I, myself am trying to conceive.

I would much rather see these people be denied a child than a happy, loving gay couple.  Should they do in-vitro?

If you were meant to be pregnant, your higher power would have let you get pregnant. If you want a baby and you can't have any- there are plenty of orphaned and foster kids in this country who need a home.

Make sure it's thirty minutes even if you have to stop and walk a few times (but make sure you you put the maximum effort into running it all the way through, no pain no gain, the first week always sucks and you will have to push yourself).<br>  <br>  By the second week you should notice a dramatic improvement in your running and can probably run the whole 30 minutes without stopping.

I've started running on a treadmill, and then I will move to a track. Also, practice getting to  27 pushups in one min and 50 situps in one min. Dont just do them at your own pace, because of course you will timed when you get there.<br>  Good Luck!<br>  PS (i guess i will see you there) ( And yes, I agree pushups are evil!)|`|sgEloO1Jaa	just keep working on it i promise you wont be the worst one there. i leave april 14th see ya there|`|uZkod82Taa	Since you have a month left, I would do as much as you can to get yourself prepared before you leave.  Yes, it's possible to still pass when it's all said and done but if you are really bad off, you're just gonna make life tougher on yourself out there.  Trainees that come to basic really out of shape is a MTI's nightmare.  Everyone has the common misconception that because it's AF BMT, it will be easy as far as PT goes.  Believe me, they PT way more than most would imagine.

So, it depends on what sentence you received for the felonies (it's the sentence that matters, not how long you served) - but there is a chance you would be allowed to move to New Zealand, especially since they say "in most cases" - this suggests that they make exceptions (or that the Minister of Immigration may).<br>  <br>  If you think you may qualify, you can do most of the paperwork online - and you can also contact Immigration New Zealand in person at their branches in either Los Angeles or Washington if you have any more questions.  Good luck - and congratulations on turning your life around :-).<br>  <br>  Additional:  Also, social work qualifications are on the long term skills shortage list - which ought to be in you favour (do a search on the skills shortage lists for social worker - last link below).|`|N7G26k4Iaa	No.  Felonies basically mean that you cannot migrate to any other country.|`|f610fce787e6299e681ff222a3173ed5aa	Possibly, there is info on this website or contact the NZ consulate or an immigration lawyer (be careful as some immigration lawyers waster your time & take your money when they know you have no chance of immigrating):<br>  <br>  nzimmigration.govt.nz|`|5CPgTpXeaa	you would have to do some research on you rlocal laws. if you served your time for those felonies then you shoudl be fine. but you still need to check with the embassy because countries have their own lws when it comes to things like that

They have no authority to enforce local laws/regulations.  They oftentimes do get involved in situations due to their training and just willingness to help, but aren't considered law enforcement.  The flip side to this is that sometimes local agencies will employ base security forces as part-time officer, and if this is the case then they do act with the authority of local law enforcement due to their part time employment.|`|6cab2b9dd2c29354544accbd71ebe9baaa	No, military police are not considered sworn law enforcement officers.

While losses were substantial on both sides, heavy losses suffered by Serbia resulted in its reduction to a virtual vassal state with Serbian nobles paying tribute and supplying soldiers to the Ottomans Furthermore, in response to Turkish pressure, some Serbian noblemen wed their daughters, including the daughter of Prince Lazar, to Bayezid.In the wake of these marriages, Stefan Lazarevic became a loyal ally of Bayezid, going on to contribute significant forces to many of Bayezid's future military engagements including the Battle of Nicopolis which marked the last large scale Crusade in the Middle Ages<br>  <br>  The Battle of Kosovo came to be seen as a symbol of Serbian patriotism and desire for independence in the 19th century rise of nationalism under Ottoman rule.

We were in a COLD WAR. You spend more during a war. it is the way things work. Plus it was actually Franklin Delano Roosevelt who spent the most with the money adjusted to inflation and he had the biggest expansion of government in us history.|`|E9XL5x3Paa	The three biggest spenders in American history were (in order from most to 3rd most):<br>  <br>  1)  George W. Bush (R)<br>  <br>  2)  Richard Nixon (R)<br>  <br>  3)  Ronald Reagan (R)<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  And the biggest expansion of government occurred in 2002, done by a Republican Congress and approved by Republican President George W. Bush.  <br>  <br>  And in the bailout bill of last year, it started as a $700 billion bailout.  House Republicans voted it down, and were hailed as Conservative heroes.<br>  <br>  So the authors of the bill go back, ADD $150 billion to the bill to now make it $850 billion, and guess who votes for it nearly en masse?  That's right, the Republicans.  They didn't care about the spending, they just wanted to get their own spending added on.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Republicans are not Conservative, and have not been in about a half-century now.  They more or less just like the word.<br>  <br>  Bill Clinton was actually one of the lower spenders of the last century; not the lowest, but close.  Interestingly enough, the lowest spender of the last century was Herbert Hoover, and his actions led to the Great Depression.<br>  <br>  For all intents and purposes, while neither party is fiscally Conservative (not physically, fiscally), Democrats are far closer to it.  Democrats spend less, spend here when they spend, and cover their spending.<br>  <br>  Republicans cut taxes, but spend more.  They spend more elsewhere, and since they don't raise the taxes necessary to cover their higher spending they have to borrow the money from other countries.  At very high interest rates.<br>  <br>  For proof of that fact, look at BOTH Iraq Wars.|`|um87XJvmaa	Fiscal conservative..because he was...

AA11546221	It's the mess that former gov. Jeb Bush left behind too. <br>  <br>  Firms are now hoarding cash (in U.S. & abroad) instead of lending it, until they understand how bad the housing crash will become and how exposed to it they are. Any institution that seems to have a high-risk portfolio, regardless of whether it has enough assets to support the portfolio, faces the double whammy of investors demanding their money back and lenders shutting the door in their face. From my perspective, the Federal Reserve doesn't seem they can do much with this merry-go-round: Cutting interest rates to save economic growth hurts the dollar or raising interest rates to help the dollar would hurt the economy. And I don't think oil-producing countries want to keep all the dollars they are getting for their oil, since it's worth less, so they are diversifying and converting their dollars into euros or other currencies. That pushes more dollars back out into currency markets, which in turn pushes down the dollar's value. So if foreigners want to go shopping here in the U.S., now is the best time since they can buy stuff for less.<br>  <br>  The ones who are not immune to this recession are those developing countries & the wealthy people.|`|AjPbtm7oaa	They're elitist, capitalist pigs.|`|KX1R4OQfaa	Some people have not lost their jobs or their homes, so it is hard for them to relate.<br>  <br>  I do not think we should begrudge those that chose a home they can afford, and a career that has not been hit by the recession.|`|ncSd9jXDaa	california is in the pooper....<br>  <br>  <br>  its a depression... and socializing the country wont make it any better...|`|lvBUl3Zdaa	Remember that the policies that drove the economy into the ground were based on the idea that what's good for rich folks is good for everybody. <br>  <br>  While many people who are well-to-do still have enough money to live as comfortably as they want to, the fact is that the majority of Americans have seen a drop in their income and/or the value of their investments. <br>  <br>  Now if you were an investment banker or derivatives trader raking in millions in bonuses every year, I bet you'd think that poor, homeless people were a bunch of whiners, too. ∠°)|`|4eLzY2hfaa	some people aren't bright enough to pour p**s out of a boot, but that doesn't change reality!|`|IFVrLCNOaa	People who have don't understand 'have not'.|`|Qc59JvE1aa	some people lie,we are in a crisis,to hell with what some people say

General knowledge of how credit reports work.  The Fair Credit Reporting Act is federal, hence California can't change it.  The state also can't prevent companies based in other states from reporting defaults.  A credit report is a single document, when it's requested the credit bureau that's asked sends it, there's no pick or choose what goes, the person granting the credit who determines what's good or bad.
261e200ff9afed850c06278f61c34b85aa	A very interesting question.<br>  <br>  Republicans didn't support Bush because he was a moderate. They didn't support McCain for the same reason. You should have seen how true republicans supported Reagan! Other true Republicans like Gingrich and Palin were targets of smear campaigns. For the Morality of the republicans, men and women who have some area of "immorality" in their past, are not suitable and we tend not to trust them. Democrats, on the other hand, assume all politicians are corrupt and their questions are - What can my country do for me? What will my country do against those whom I envy? When Republicans mention their corruption democrats just laugh, they don't care. I believe McCain must have wanted to be elected but he was frightened of it. Every time he came close to getting ahead, he did, or said, something stupid. Republicans care about such things. They refused to give money because he was a moderate. Obama got money because he was corrupt and told people he would screw the rich. He fostered envy of the rich at every possible opportunity. He Used the color of his skin shamelessly, to get support. He had at least 100 ways to mention it. Let any republican mention it and they were called a racist. McCain ordered his party not to attack Obama in any way, lest he be called a racist. So, while the Obama attack machine continually called attention to McCain's first wife, no one asked where the money to get Obama's ecucation came from. No one insisted he divulge his college papers. Not one paper delved into his true connections to terrorists. He didn't get 5 hard questions during his whole campaign.  Republicans were hamstrung because we care about morality.|`|70DZWz2Baa	We need to seperate from the republicans so they can form their own middle road party.

The answer you are looking for is a slur against our current President.  You've gotten that from the conservative drones rambling on below.<br>  <br>  But, for some reason, I'm going to give you a logical answer anyway.  God knows you won't listen to it, but here it is:<br>  <br>  1)  The money is not set aside for specific people.  It is set aside for a group of people who are declared (by their banking institutions) to be "at risk of default" on their mortgage.  This is based on their income and employment, debt to income ratio, and various other factors.  It is not based on their race, and it would be illegal to base it on their race in any way.<br>  <br>  2)  If you want the details of what's happening with the stimulus so far (the mortgage portions aren't in effect yet, thus the lack of full information), simply visit <a href="http://www.recovery.gov." rel="nofollow">http://www.recovery.gov.</a>  It gives full disclosure, and will give full disclosure on the mortgage bill if and when it is put into action.<br>  <br>  3)  There is no way to know at this point what the exact demographics are of the group receiving the bailout.  It has yet to be determined or distributed.  There is a greater amount of poverty (statistically) in minority population, so we are likely to see fair numbers in the minority population.  The numbers are likely to correlate more to the current demographic percentages of those in lower income-brackets than the demographic percentages of the overall population.  However, since the minority and majority population are both effected by the difficulties in the current housing market, this is definitely not something that's going to be a "bailout for the minorities."<br>  <br>  You're asking for fortune telling, not statistics.  There are no reports or studies that show what percentage is going to minorities, because that's not the point at all.  Why waste our resources finding irrelevant answer?  The point is getting our housing market revived again, and assisting those who are making good-faith efforts to pay their mortgages, but are unable to due to pay-cuts or lay-offs.  <br>  <br>  Yes, minorities are part of Barack Obama's constituency, but racism works both ways.  Many people didn't vote for Obama because they were uncomfortable with the idea of a black president.  Many voted for him only because he's black.  Both are unfortunate.  We should now move past race, and stop trying to create the illusion of racism where none exists.<br>  <br>  Rob - <a href="http://www.utahliberal.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.utahliberal.com</a>

Qmgn6JHLaa	Actually, in a court trial, the attorneys makes an opening "statement" and a closing "argument."  The opening statement describes for the judge or jury what the evidence will show.  The closing argument tells how the evidence presented by both sides supports the attorney's client's case but doesn't' support or refutes the opposing side's case.|`|icRwgQ7waa	I am not sure what you mean by "the victms deserve to be justified for their murders....". Did you mean to say that these people's lives were lost in this madman's quest for satisfaction, or something like that. Also this sounds more like a closing statement. An opening statements says that what you will hear is a) b) and c) and we believe that we can prove the elements necessary for murder which are 1) 2) and 3) and that when this case is over you can and should return a verdict of guilty. Something like that. What you have sounds like a good closing though and it should mirror what you said you would prove in your opening.

I think it is the right of the victim to know if they were exposed to something deadly that could harm them or their family (or someone in the future).

tNyCZykqaa	Of course, and not necessarily every immigran that pays taxes or uses a "social security" to be employed is stealing someone else's social security. Don't you know there's a number they can get LEGALLY to use for their employment in order to pay taxes????  I've seen a whole lot of immigrants use this, I can't believe everybody in here doesn't have this knowledge and think that they are all stealing our social security numbers.  IGNORANTS.  Even if you THINK that they should not have the right to stay in "our country", guess what? you have to learn to deal with it, otherwise you to are wanting to violate "your own laws", just like you say they do.  Being illegal is a crime, okay, but you just can't compare an illegal alien to a homocide, it's just not the same, yes, it's violating the law, but it's not the same subject.  They are very different cases, I'm sure if you're dying of hunger in another country and see your own opportunity in another, why not go for it???  <br>  <br>  Anyhow, you can all keep saying what you want, but like I said, deal with it!

The last one did such a crappy job with the state's finances that the voters kicked him out.<br>  <br>  Arnold is a symptom of the disease, not the cause.|`|cWmx0J4jaa	Arnold tried to cut spending, he was protested. He tried to lower taxes, he was protested. Finally, he had no choice. How did he ruin CA? By not allowing Dems to spend and tax even more?|`|AA10429228	You weren't paying attention.<br>  I left California.<br>  I saw Arnold trying to reign them in and got shot down every time.<br>  Who do you think you're kidding?|`|utbfT0APaa	Thanks " Pro-Con" has IT right. The only thing The Terminator can do is either, sign the bill or, Veto the bill. He should have Vetoed the bill.|`|teeQmWsBaa	Illegal aliens are the cause of financial problems in Ca.|`|6OzEsanAaa	because there all stupid! and this whole society is screwed up!|`|avcjtqGtaa	Arnold is a RINO (look it up) and as such has always leaned a touch left of center.  That however has little to do with California's current predicament.  Mr. Davis managed this state so poorly that not even a liveral could get elected the year he was recalled so in an effort to win votes Arnie went with the Republican party.  It was believed at the time that the current senate would be willing to push through an amendment that would allow naturalized citizens to run for president and the Kennedy's, as usual, were manipulating things to achieve that goal.  <br>  <br>  Shortly after arnold's election liberals mysteriously backed him on several issues and as they reclaimed the house, after all commiefornia wasn't going to slip away from liberalism for long, they returned to the old tax and spend doctrine.  Thus a decade of throwing money down the drain, sucking up to illegals to save fair wages, and the majority of other ignorant programs commiefornia is now the toilet it always strove to become.<br>  <br>  So whine, cry and proclaim ignorance all you want but it was not a Republican that created this situation and not one that raised the taxes.  That was solely the morons who sat impotently for so long that it created the issue we now deal with.|`|3ixmHSwmaa	You mean why did our liberal assembly and liberal senate bankrupt Kaleefornia and then raise taxes don't you?<br>  <br>  Answer: Because liberals spend and spend and spend some more. Then they raise taxes.<br>  Then they spend and spend and spend some more. Then they raise taxes again. <br>  It's a never ending circle until the people manage to vote them out of office!<br>  <br>  Who said Gray Davis? That guy is a real schmuck! I have a $42 surcharge on my electric bill every month until the year 2024 because of him. We are paying back the Gray/Enron electricity deal. Thanks Gray Davis.<br>  Like Barny Frank, Gray Davis has never apologized to the people.|`|e19ukSO0aa	He didn't - there has been a huge running deficit for years, starting after the dot-com bust and the energy rip-off scheme, then more recently some of the highest foreclosure and unemployment rates in the nation, thereby drying up funds and creating an even larger problem.<br>  <br>  I'm not a conservative, btw, just telling it like it is.|`|b0f0f231555e5da9d455a8890388f3cbaa	Because he has no ability to do perform the job of Governor. That is, build alliances and consensus with a legislature composed of self serving, petulant and mostly cowardly preschoolers. <br>  <br>  Political analysts wrote that If he had done the job even tolerably, California would never have faced this crisis.|`|AA11765933	the man is an actor not a politician.  He should have made another terminator movie and left the job of running California to someone who actually could do it.  Yes my state is going down the toilet and no it is not Gray Davis's fault.  He is been out of politics for years.  When Gray Davis was in office the state was doing very well financially he made the grave mistake of wanting to raise the auto tax and the state rebelled.  Arnod ran on his Charisma and not on his ability to do the job and this is showing on how my state is going bankrupt.|`|6t76bgS3aa	Arnold's like the people who keep racking up credit card bills they can't pay and pay the minimum.  All the spending was financed by borrowing, and now with the economy down so are tax revenues.  It's like when someone with massive credit card debt loses their job, it's when the sh** hits the fan.  <br>  <br>  The tax increases are going to send the state into a death spiral when more and more productive people leave for states where they will not be taxed to death.  Nevada has no state income tax.  Tom McClintock warned them but they didn't listen, so now Californians are paying.  In the middle of the devastation I hope Californians at least realize they made the wrong choice in the recall.|`|159d24ded141300e0c13cc0b9dc7f716aa	He did not do it. The State Legislature controls the state, and it has for decades.<br>  <br>  Governors and Governators are helpless in their fight against the fully entrenched socialist domeheads in Sacramento.|`|S0iqDSSPaa	Because he doesn't have any choice. Illegal immigrants are bleeding California dry of resources. They should send them all back to Mexico or where ever else they came from and they should do it NOW!!!
um87XJvmaa	Because of the loud mouth pundits on talk radio and TV.  They spew liberal this and liberal that 24/7.  McCain  was a liberal republican in 2000 and has tried to be what the party wants, allowing Palin as his running mate, but the pundits only want far right  wing conservatives in the GOP.  Any one who speaks out against this is shunned by the tribe and is made to publicly apologize.<br>  <br>  Anyone who votes for a non-republican is branded as a <br>  dreaded liberal who wants to destroy the US.<br>  <br>  Add:  good answer, Erin.<br>  <br>    On Meet the Press this morning a statement was read that some republican stated that  a GOP governor who was planning on taking the stimulus money for his state, was 'wearing the jersey of the other team.'  In the GOP you are supposed to be part of the collective and resistance is futile.|`|E9XL5x3Paa	Because for whatever reason, the Republican Party constituents (overall, of course, not all of them) have a view of the world that holds that everything is black and white, right or wrong, good or evil.  There is no middle ground for them.<br>  <br>  I personally believe it has to do with the Religious Right's influence, who have seriously taken the Bible to levels that I doubt God had intended for it.  King David is held up as an example to be followed, and he sinned with Bathsheba.  He compounded the sin by killing her husband.  Yet God still held him in high esteem.<br>  <br>  Jesus Himself protected a prostitute from being stoned, even though God's law held that she be stoned for her actions.  So there is a gray area, even in the Bible.  God does not hold us to that all-or-nothing standard; yet the Religious Right usually does.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  And I believe their influence has now affected the Republican Party to the point where they only see the world as all-or-nothing, good or evil.  And so they completely ignore any evil out of those they agree with, because their mind cannot accept that something they think is right might be flawed.  They completely ignore any good coming out of those they disagree with, because they cannot accept the idea that they dislike something that may have God's approval, or at least not His hate.<br>  <br>  And to them, no one can exist in the gray area where someone can disagree with their side, but not agree with the other side.|`|aGNjZmyJaa	I agree with Republicans on more issues than Democrats, but because I didn't like McCain or Palin, and voted for Obama, I must be a liberal. lol<br>  <br>  <br>  And my first candidate I supported was Mitt Romney, a Republican.<br>  <br>  Actually, the answerer above of me is Republican.|`|yrDqtazLaa	All Republicans must have the same beliefs and the same feelings on everything. If you disagree with any of them, you're not a real Republican.|`|jauizC6Vaa	I see more liberals who confuse conservatives with Republicans.|`|AA10429228	Same reason I'm an honorary NeoCon for daring to speak up about the name-calling, rumor mongering, gossiping, slander, libel, etc., aimed at President Bush.  I got the same thing when I spoke up against the contemptible behavior aimed at President Clinton, but in that case I was a lib.<br>  I am a democrat, old-style.<br>  <br>  Free speech, including for republican talk radio.<br>  Free expression, including for Christian fundamentalists.<br>  Equality, including for white men.<br>  <br>  I'm none of the above (part white).<br>  <br>  Funny how many people have abandoned those principles after Democrats made them household values, one of our greatest successes.<br>  <br>  Let's get back to them, shall we?<br>  <br>  You keep speaking up, hear?|`|cWmx0J4jaa	I am an Indy and I find you go against a Lib you are called a Republican. But I have only seen Repub's call peple Liberal when they say something that only a Liberal would say. Key phrases that let you know, this person thinks they aren't Liberal, but guess what? They secretly are! I've seen it time and time again.<br>    But, that's me, I don't know why Repubs do that.|`|gQYIphZtaa	All the names they use have lost true meaning, because they label everyone that disagrees with them. Socialist,Terrorist,Communist,Antichrist... Their misuse of all these words have made them all toothless and damaged the credibility of anyone using them.|`|gYNDNXAkaa	Because anyone who disagrees with a Republican is probably sane and sane=liberal.|`|9093de6692223005aee5cc23526be087aa	Because their blinders prevent them from seeing peripherally!|`|wdBY1fWaaa	That's true. I think it's when someone thinks the stimulus plan is a great idea though....that's a liberal.|`|pRpgbuqiaa	To some people, anything to the left of far-right is liberal.|`|AA12070828	Why do liberals believe if you have any morals in your life you are a stupid *** redneck?|`|8C9PTGxNaa	well, why do liberals like you until you disagree? <br>  <br>  it's the same thing...they're opposites...duh.|`|5KjvNg2oaa	im a libertarian i disagree with both parties on most issues|`|3c91df9cab412a7ca4201cdaf64121e3aa	It is the "all or nothing" mentality they have.  It is the very same thing they are doing currently in congress.  They won't give at all because either it has to be done their way or no way - no compromise for them.<br>  <br>  And they think that if you disagree partially or with one or two platform issues, then you must be liberal because you don't fully agree with them.  Crazy, but it will be the downfall of the party. . .

367926de3fa96492022d3fae80bbab42aa	Navy Sailor is partially correct. Submarine service is not open to females as of now. Neither is SEALS or any other special operations units in the Navy.<br>  <br>  However, pretty much all jobs (with the exception of those mentioned above) are open to females. If you go active duty you will have a sea/shore rotation meaning that you have to be at sea for a number of months and shore for a number of months. Some shore commands will count as sea time though. You will have the option of volunteering for certain assignments but that does not mean that you will necessarily get it.<br>  <br>  Depending on what your specialty is, i.e. engineering, JAG, aviation, etc. will be decide the majority of your assignments. To be honest, the thing that will limit you the most is yourself.

367926de3fa96492022d3fae80bbab42aa	If you don't want to deploy overseas, the National Guard is not for you. In fact, no form of military service would be for you. Even the Coast Guard can deploy overseas. If you were in the National Guard, there is probably a 100 percent chance (depending on your job mostly) that you will be deployed. There are some units that do not deploy but they are few.<br>  <br>  I'm not here to judge anyone. Every one has a right to their own opinions, likes, wants and needs. The military isn't for everyone. If you interested in perfoming some function protecting national borders, national emergencies, or something of that sort you might be interested in a different agency such as the American Red Cross, Border Patrol or something of that nature. It all comes down to what you are looking at getting out of being in the National Guard. Find an organization that offers the types of services you are interested in participating in.|`|5ewSifMraa	Yes, unfortunately you will be sent overseas if you join the National Guard.  My friend has joined last year in June and he is scheduled to go to Afghanistan next year.  Though I believe you are doing the right thing, to help out this nation, both domestic and foreign.  But you should still consider going because after the overseas you can still help out around the USA.  So joining the National Guard? Go for it.|`|iJQqX37daa	Well the National Guard is for each state, but if need you have a Federal mission too. I've deployed with my National Guard unit. the best group of people you will ever meet.|`|n2oEhdZiaa	This isn't hateful: We don't want you.  We are a component of the Army.  We train part time mostly, but we have duel missions.  In natural disasters like the recent ice storms or Hurricane Katrina, the Guard is mobilized to help people and clean up.  When our Nation is at war, we mobilize to the Active Army and deploy to anywhere in the globe.  When it's over, we return to our home, go back to our families, our jobs, or our schooling.  We just don't need people that are unwilling to commit to the full spectrum of missions.  If you have a problem with Iraq, take it up with your politicians.  Your state's representatives and senators most likely voted to support the Iraq war.  Did they ever hear from you?  Did you tell them how you don't think invasions are right?  Probably not.  I'm guessing you're only concerned about the military and the military deploying is if you are in it.  We don't need that kind of selfishness either.

Msd9PiRGaa	Roosevelt by far.|`|5Ho518J9aa	FDR, but in the context that a falling comet makes a big impact. JFK was a hero killed for telling the truth.|`|70DZWz2Baa	I'd like to put this answer in a political and economics context. We know socially the effects of the "New Deal" on society. Americans were using the "Classical Model of Economics." Every country chooses a 'model' they feel will give them the best results. Following Adam Smith's advice, we adopted a 'model' which was driven 'by the supply side.' FDR needed to get people to start spending money FAST. If you look closely at the programs, they were all about getting people money, so they would 'buy' on the economy. We switched at that point to Keynes Model of economics were the economy would be driven by the 'demand side of model.' We used this model til the 70's when 'stagflation occurred' (the model didn't predict a rising economy with a simultaneous rising unemployment, so it was switched to a monetarist system) Interesting is the President asked for and got a substantial increase in presidential powers, 'as if an enemy was attacking the US' (something similar to that statement). This is the very first time a Sitting President had enormous amounts of power. Since that point presidents try to accumulate more power sometimes referred to as "presidential imperialism."<br>  <br>  <br>  At your after-school job, you probably earn at least the minimum wage of $5.85 an hour. Your grandfather may get a Social Security check every month. And if your room works late, there's a good chance she s paid overtime.<br>  <br>  The minimum wage, Social Security, and overtime pay are just three of the countless aspects of American life today that are largely the handiwork of a single President: Franklin Delano Roosevelt, who took office 75 years ago, in March 1933.<br>  <br>  During his 12 years in the White House--a period that included the Great Depression and World War II FDR revolutionized the role of the government in business and the economy, and by extension, in the lives of all Americans.<br>  <br>  The legislation he pushed though Congress as part of his New Deal not only helped ease the Depression, it also formed the underpinnings of the modem welfare state.<br>  <br>  Admirers credit him with rescuing capitalism and America's way of life at a time when widespread economic misery made socialism and Communism more appealing to many. Detractors argue that he opened the door to a government that was too big, too powerful, and too costly for taxpayers. But few deny his impact on the United States United States, officially United States of America, republic (2005 est. pop. 295,734,000), 3,539,227 sq mi (9,166,598 sq km), North America. The United States is the world's third largest country in population and the fourth largest country in area. , then and now. <br>  "No other President affects our lives today as much as FDR," says William E. Leuchtenburg, author of The FDR Years. "There is the growth of the presidency, the welfare state--including old-age security--and government regulation of so many areas of private life."<br>  <br>  Here are some examples of how FDR's legacy influences American life in the 21st century:<br>  <br>  MINIMUM WAGE<br>  <br>  * If you work weekends or after school, at Wal-Mart or McDonald's, you're entitled to earn at least the federal minimum wage. In 1938, the Fair Labor Standards Act Fair Labor Standards Act or Wages and Hours Act, passed by the U.S. Congress in 1938 to establish minimum living standards for workers engaged directly or indirectly in interstate commerce, including those involved in production of goods bound , part of Roosevelt's New Deal., established the first federal minimum wage: 25 cents an hour. This past Jury, it was raised from $5.15 to $5.85, as part of a three-step increase to $7.25 in 2009. (Some states and cities have their own minimum-wage or "riving wage" laws, which set the minimum higher than the federal level.)<br>  <br>  9 T0 5<br>  <br>  * The Fair Labor Standards Act--which Roosevelt called "the most far-reaching ... program for the benefit of workers ever adopted in this or any other country"--not only set a minimum wage, it literally created the 9-to-5 workday we're so familiar with today. Until. 1938, many people worked six days a week. The Act mandated a 5-day, 40-hour work week, with overtime pay (usually time and a half) beyond that. The idea behind a shorter work week wasn't to give people more time off, but to spread the work around and make it available to some of the millions of people who were unemployed as a result of the Depression. By the 1950s, "9 to 5," Monday through Friday, had become the standard work week for most Americans.<br>  <br>  [ILLUSTRATION OMITTED]<br>  <br>  THE NUCLEAR AGE<br>  <br>  * One of the key events in the history of nuclear weapons was Roosevelt's decision in 1942 to greenlight the super-secret Manhattan Project Manhattan Project, the wartime effort to design and build the first nuclear weapons (atomic bombs). With the discovery of fission in 1939, it became clear to scientists that certain radioactive materials could be used to make a bomb of unprecented power. U.S. , which built and tested the first nuclear weapons during|`|s25Dh5RVaa	FDR.<br>  <br>  If it weren't for him, we wouldn't have Social Security. [That's not necessarily a good thing]<br>  <br>  The New Deal prolonged the Depression, so I'd say he had a large impact on gov and society.|`|hiCSVwchaa	Roosevelt.<br>  <br>  Kennedy was president for too short of a time to have much historical impact.|`|um87XJvmaa	FDR|`|e9duTSZXaa	JFK<br>  <br>  JFK's pick of his VP was his downfall.  Now that we know that LBJ was behind the assassination, we can blame JFK for the GREAT SOCIETY problems, the Viet Nam War which led to the stagflation of the Carter years, and his distruction of our trust in the US Government.<br>  <br>  How do we know it was LBJ?  The answer starts wtih the first trick used in the deception of "we'll never know who killed JFK."  There's more, LOTS more information coming soon.|`|UWkEHOGfaa	FDR lives on with social security. JFK with leadership.<br>  <br>  Ironically, if JFK were around today, he would have stopped the Democratic Party (including his brother) from turning so far to the left. In fact, JFK and Barry Goldwater of all people had an extremely cordial friendship.|`|KjBXFr9Raa	Choosing between my 2 favorite presidents is very hard, but i would probably say FDR because times were worse when he was in office|`|1RYFVtnWaa	That's right Bret.....JFK was going to blow the whistle on the "secret societies" members in the fed

An aptitude test.  It measures your strong suits.<br>  <br>  You haven't specified what job fields are showing as compatible NOW with your score NOW.  Why not consider those jobs?  Note that even IF you attain your desired Electronics scores and IF you get accepted to your desired electronics job fields, guess what?  You'll be in a classroom filled with applicants who probably sailed through the electronics portion of their ASVAB no sweat.<br>  <br>  How's that for competition?  Are you up for that kind of challenge? If you are, go on your current path but realize that if follow on billet assignments are limited, guess who gets the prize billets?  Usually the top scorers in the class.<br>  <br>  Additionally, since an electron is an electron is an electron, why not consider the electronics ASVAB requirements of the other services?  Their scores may be within your grasp already.  You do know that all the services all have their own air forces, right?  Why limit yourself?  They all require avionics techs.  Once upon a time, the U.S. Navy actually had more aircraft than the Air Force!  <br>  <br>  You also need to consider where these services' bases are located.  Are you satisfied by the locations of Air Force bases?  Due to the nature of aircraft, plus their continuing maintenance of missile silos, their bases tend to be in remote locations.<br>  <br>  Realize as well that USAF actually encourages homesteading so the most desirable bases are harder to enter since they don't rotate their personnel as much as the other services.  Furthermore, this 'good life' tends to make Airmen stay on longer in their current jobs.  This saturation means that advancements and promotion are slower compared with the other services.  Years slower.<br>  <br>  Keep doing what you are doing but please don't blind yourself to the vast opportunities available in the entire Dept of Defense spectrum.<br>  <br>  Good Luck.
CowgOqXTaa	Um, here's a geography lesson. "Europe" is not a country.

I did not vote for Obama because he was inexperienced, from Chicago (the most corrupt city), because of his past associations with questionable persons, because he could not directly answer any question ask of him, and because he was making promises that no one could possibly keep.  He started blaming Bush for everything, sucked up to the Clinton's, has shown that he has no instinct whatsoever in judging people that he appoints to his cabinet.  The stock market has no confidence in him whatsoever.  The result being that since it looked like he was winning in Sept, -08 the stock market has been in a steady decline ever since and millions upon millions have been totally wiped out.  And a democratic program called Fannie Mae collapsed after Barney Frank lied to Bush and McCain about the solvency of the program.  When it crashed it took us all with it, and now we are paying trillions to bail them out because they abused the system.  But good old Barney made his millions from Fannie Mae, and his corruption ruined it for everybody.

Jose Serrano, D-N.Y., earlier this month introduced the bill, H. J. Res. 5, which, according to the bill's language, proposes "an amendment to the Constitution of the United States to repeal the twenty-second article of amendment, thereby removing the limitation on the number of terms an individual may serve as President." <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  In the past, some presidents have been critical of the 22nd Amendment, including Eisenhower, Clinton and Reagan. <br>  <br>  In 1807 Thomas Jefferson, however, warned that presidents not bound by term limits could use their popularity and power to become kings. <br>  <br>  "If some termination to the services of the chief magistrate be not fixed by the Constitution or supplied in practice," Jefferson wrote to the Legislature of Vermont, "his office, nominally for years, will in fact become for life; and history shows how easily that degenerates into an inheritance."|`|o1PuFnWmaa	He won't ask.

But people nowadays have this backward inside-out notion that it's okay to have as many kids as you can afford, but when somebody else who has done the same thing loses their job or their spouse, it's okay to scream at them that they should never have had the kids. You can't have it both ways. ∠°)|`|3f308ad35b130f4de8c4f88bfa8abd64aa	No,we have enough laws. If the government stopped supporting all these children this matter would take care of it self.|`|Gew6pZhbaa	I agree with you. I don't feel that you should be able to recieve benifits for having children. Mistake or not, if you're mature enough to have sex, you best be mature enough to raise a child. I don't feel the government should pay for these children when the parents don't work to the fullest of their ability. It's wrong, because you see so many honest americans trying to make a living for themselves and their family, and the government seems to help lazy people more than they help the people keeping this economy going. I don't believe there should be a law on how many children you have, because it would be difficult to put a punishment to that. If they take the child away, that's one more innocent life in foster care. If they arrest you, that's still another child in foster care. I believe they need to stop handing out OUR tax dollars to people who don't deserve it. People who sit around collecting checks for all their children, and turn around and waste it anyway. I'm not against government support. I believe that if you truely do everything you can to be financially stable, and you just flat out can't do it, then you have every right to accept help. It's so sad that people bring children into this world for such petty reasons.|`|T0pkW783aa	No, absolutely not.  If you are talking about welfare moms, then I do agree that they should not be paid to have unlimited children without providing some support from the fathers of their children.  The government pays for all these welfare children and all those of the illegals who are here; for food stamps, housing, health care, schooling, college funding and it is insane.  There should be a limit on how many can be covered.  You play and keep reproducing, then you are on your own.  Welfare assistance should be temporary, just like unemployment; you get so much and then you are on your own.  We are struggling to make ends meet and all of the welfare cases are breaking our backs; we can't keep doing this.  Obama is putting out more money for this cause and it is insane!!  I work two jobs; my husband is laid off and can't find work; we have no hospitalization and don't even think about trying for welfare.  We do the right thing and don't sit around waiting for the government to supply our every need.  We are responsible and they should be too.|`|O6x1CTd4aa	While I don't think there should be a law saying how many we can have I like your idea of laws stating the government will only help financially for ONE child.|`|XFZmAMOAaa	Pretty sore subject as the maternal instinct is to have kids yet our world is getting crowded and getting to the point where it will be unable to feed those kids.We should be thinking about it though,soon.

I work in an emergency room and there are laws that protect the uninsured in such instances, but it is such a reach to have put it in those words, playing the uninsured as the victim, in which they would be in the case of an accident, but what alot of people do not relise is that is normally not the case. I do not beleive in debtors prison, but something has to be done and UHC is not the answer. people complain and wonder why healthcare is so exspensive, well i'll tell you, over half of the people (about 65%)i see in the ER are on some kind of wellfare and or uninsured, the problem being is that medicaid for example will only pay 30 to 35% of the visit meaning that the hospital takes a hit everytime such a patient comes in, hence the raise of healthcare costs, and it's a battle between the two that nobody exspecially the patients win. The pure abuse of the system is screwing everybody else, i'm not saying that some people arn't justified to be on welfare, but from my prespective out of the 65% of patients only 5 to 10% are really emergencies, meaning that we get literally alot of patients seen for headaches and "I just feel wierd" or I wanna know if i'm pregnant or my kids are driving me crazy or i got hit in the back with a waterballoon a week ago and i just want to see if it's ok. These are real complaints that i see all the time and are nothing but a waste of time and taxpayers money. Its funny that almost 100% of people who are seen with insurance have legitimant complaints, emergencies. and the sad thing is the people on welfare feel like they are owed something, they will be the first to complain and be nasty, yet the patients with insurance are usually very curtious and understanding, i've had some patients complain about the wait saying that the Dr. should see the less severe patients first so they can get in and get out, then see the more severe. Anyway i'm rambling it's just so frustrating. theres nothing wrong with being poor but there is something wrong with leeching off the system and to be perfectly honest My wife and i do not mak very much money, and could definatley be considered poor, we live in a 30 year old trailor thats falling apart and were both paying for our college tuition without government help we couldnt even afford a hotel for our honeymoon i'm using my father inlaws internet, and out sorce of entertainment is ourselves as in we can't afford cable, but thats ok because thats what it takes to make it in todays sociaty to many people want to get a free ride and plea poverty and what not, get off you butt and do something, your jobs not cutting it for you get a second job the government owes us nothing and we our in control of our own lives!|`|3ebb87ed0f276343bd04001d7c181545aa	Hmmmm so your somehow arguing, that the high cost of health care,<br>  <br>  is the fault of republicans.<br>  <br>  And not Liberal doctors charging to much ?<br>  <br>  If you bought a corvettee and didn't pay your payments, the same thing applies.<br>  <br>  You wouldn't be able to pay the bill and would default on the debt.<br>  <br>  So now are you saying that the government should cover the bill ?<br>  <br>  You somehow go from, you cannot afford to pay, to the government should then pay it for you.<br>  <br>  You do know that UHC has been before Congress 5 times already,<br>  <br>  Under Truman, johnson, Nixon, Carter and Clinton.

Teaching is an occupation that is more appealing to liberals than conservatives; it's a lot of hard work for very little pay.  Also, since parents are so disengaged from their childrens' lives, more pressure has been put on teachers to make their lessons more engaging.  Teachers have to tie in their lessons to the real world to motivate kids to learn since parents are no longer applying pressure on them at home.  Of course, their lessons will then take a liberal slant; teachers can't get away with only teaching the facts anymore.|`|RcCJSSMPaa	Neoimperialism.

There are many good teachers but they are caught in this union mentality where dead weight and poor performers can hardly be fired.<br>  5. Private schools can be divided into parochial and non-parochial. The parochial schools by virtue of religious affiliation would represent more traditional values. Non-parochial and monied schools would tend to go towards the liberal side. Military academies would be conservative on a whole.<br>  6. Often in colleges, liberalism is the only espoused politics.

AA10083573	My introduction into politics was when Mr. Kennedy was shot. I was in grade school, and remember John-John saluting the casket as it went by. I remember hearing my dad talk about Mr. Johnson taking over, and I was upset about it, though I don't know why. As the years went by, I seemed to like what the Republicans had to say more than the Democrats, even though I couldn't tell you how my parents voted. Those things were put in the same category as money, religion and sex...it just wasn't spoken of in my house. Mom was old fashioned that way. But, I listened to what both sides had to say, and the Republicans (back then) seemed to make more sense to me, and seemed to speak to how I saw America.<br>  <br>  What made me get more involved was when I worked in a factory, and we were allowed to have radios with headphones at our work stations. I operated a screw machine for 10-12 hours a day, so it was pretty boring work. And working in a metal pole building didn't give you much choices for radio stations. It was either the oldies station, or the Christian station. For a while, I chose the oldies station. But one day, it was off the air, and I turned to the Christian station. The main reason I never liked it 'cause it was mostly all preachers, and when they had music, it made you fall asleep. Well, I listened that day, and heard my first Christian talk radio program. That was eye-opening! I learned some things that I never knew about...things I didn't know were happening right in this country. Why wasn't the media reporting it? I learned that the most feared thing to a politician was a housewife with a phone and a pen. I listened to people calling in, and being encouraged to get involved by calling or writing to their representatives. I wasn't even aware that that was an option. I began to realize that the world was much bigger than just my own backyard, and that I could make a difference.<br>  <br>  As far as how old I am...well I'm as old as the '57 Chevy, and just as classic as that car!<br>  <br>  Ever since I turned 18, I've always voted Republican (see above for reasons why).<br>  <br>  And the older I get, the more involved I am in the political process. I attend county board meetings, city meetings, town hall meetings, and volunteer for Habitat for Humanity, as well as donate to our local food pantry & thrift store. I figure if I'm not involved in these things, then I don't have the right to whine about stuff when things go wrong.

VjgqZetcaa	Many factors to consider in the trade-offs.<br>  <br>  1. A security alarm does not provide any physical protection; it is up to the responding personnel to take action.<br>  2. A security alarm does nothing to deter an intruder until AFTER the alarm has been triggered, assuming that the intruder fears some physical person to respond to the alarm.<br>  3. A dog can deter an intruder before the intrusion.<br>  4. A dog can stop an intruder during an invasion.<br>  5. You don't have to feed or walk an alarm system.<br>  6. You can get an insurance deduction for an alarm system.<br>  7. An alarm system won't keep your feet warm in the winter.<br>  <br>  Fences, motion-sensor lighting, window bars, secondary door locks, etc are all physical barriers that may be sufficient to deter intrusion.  An armed guard, or armed citizen, is difficult to properly train, unpredictable under duress, raise liability insurance costs, and of questionable use during a surprise attack.  Security cameras may provide some deterrence, but are more useful for awareness of threats and for identification of suspects after the fact.|`|pIvN6TY7aa	Statistically speaking, you'd be safer without the guns.<br>  <br>  What kind of dog, and what kind of security alarm?<br>  <br>  I have read that the police recommend that a little, yappy dog is a greater deterrent to home invasions than bigger "guard dogs". The principle in action here, I guess, is that people engaged in illicit acts do not wish to draw attention to their acts. And an effective deterrent is the best security. (I've heard about "guard dogs" pulling off some pretty amazing manoeuvres, but "... don't try this at home, folks!")<br>  <br>  I have also read that one of the most effective mechanical security alarms is a motion-activated light. I appreciate mine at the doors when I'm coming in with a load of groceries.  An invader doesn't like to be put under the floodlights.<br>  <br>  "Mustang Sally", my little mutt, can sense alien critters (2 or 4 legs) long before any person or machine around here. It's a good thing we have very few strangers, or she might be a real nuisance.<br>  <br>  In my own case, I'm much more concerned by bears that come to my garden in the fall. Rather missing a 'clean kill' - a wounded bear is not a good thing to contribute to the community! - I use Air Bombs. They're sort of like firecrackers, with flashes and loud noises. <br>  <br>  Now, if you're talking about home security systems intended to bring the local constabulary to your home, that has a lot to do with how effective your local constabulary would be.  <br>  <br>  Where I live, the Mounties, even with "pedal to the metal" couldn't get here in less than half an hour.  And there are two of them to cover an area about as big as France. (I'm not exaggerating.)<br>  <br>  And I was reading that in Beverly Hills a year or so, poor police response was criticized after some major thefts.<br>  <br>  The most effective security system I ever had was a boyfriend who was known as a very loving and protective person, when sober.  When he wasn't - utterly fearless.  Twelve feet tall and bulletproof. Only one homicide, but that was accidental.<br>  <br>  Sometimes, I almost miss him.|`|BQdXnCcHaa	Studies have shown that most thieves are scared off by a barking dog, no matter how big the dog is.

For the times you ( and dog? ) have to be away, alarms are better than nothing.<br>  Any dog is territorial, and will alert you to visitors.

The typical burglar looks for homes that have no outside lighting, have a lot of privacy measures (high fences, shrubbery, etc), have no sign of security alarms, and where there is no sign of a dog. Even a smaller dog can be a great security system in and of itself, because most burglars would rather find a place where they have no chance of being bitten.|`|dpSr0icwaa	absolutely.<br>  <br>  This is what a criminal knows about a security alarm.<br>  #1 it is easy to determine the type then take steps to get around it.<br>  #2 if the alarm is activated, you can threaten the residents to put in the disarm code or say the right things to the alarm company.<br>  #3 if both #1 and #2 fail, the alarm company will send out an UNARMED person to LOOK and see if anything is going on.  Even if this person would see your children raped by a single person, that security guard...no, not security guard...'alarm scout' cannot intervein or he looses his job, so no way he is going to lift a finger to help you beyond calling 911.<br>  <br>  Now, what does the criminal know about the dog.<br>  #1 Higher chance of getting the owner to notice exactly what is exciting the dog. (with some alarm systems, hard to tell the difference between a bug and a specific point being activated)<br>  #2 unlikely that the dog can be 'deactivated' without killing it, which would be a noisy and long tactic.<br>  #3 unknown if the dog is small or big...or, if hearing an obvious small dog bark, unknown if it has a less bark inclined larger dog with it.  Unknown how agressive the dog is.  Obviously no home invader wants to catch a pitbull or rotty jumping for his face teeth barred, but a pointer, german shepard, colly, black lab, golden retriever, etc, can do a heck of a lot of damage too.<br>  <br>  I'd take a small dog over just an alarm. Heck, I'd take 2 large dogs over 1 large dog PLUS an alarm.  I think 2 large dogs plus alarm is probably the best you can get, but I think dogs are the best thing to turn too...especially if you are a dog person. <br>  <br>   I'd go 2 dogs.  1 large and  1 small is fine, as the small one will often be the one who is more barky and more likely to alert you, and dogs instinctively work well together, the small dog can often give just enough distraction to a human to give the large dog a real juicy opening...and often small dogs are dumb enough and unaware of their size enough that they are overly bold on the attack.<br>  <br>  Also, when you get dogs, please consider the pound as a source for them.  Also, please take some note of what breeds you are getting, especially in small dogs.  Realize if you get a Terrier or a Terrier cross, those guys have it imprinted on their genes to DIG DIG DIG DIG DIG and then DIG SOME MORE!|`|TnIsuYqYaa	Get 2 rottweilers,that way when 1 sleeps the other one will be active.You will be covered that way.I have never seen a security alarm bite off an intruders face.Forget the alarm,get 2  big viscous dogs and have them trained properly.Then sleep in peace.|`|lWZi2p70aa	Well, you need to train a dog.  I once has a Rhodesian Ridgeback who would accept food from no one but me, and her friend was an Anatolian Shepherd who was capable of destroying an intruder on his own, and would, to protect the Ridgeback.<br>  <br>  He might have been fed drugged meat by a determined intruder, but she would not eat it and would raise such a ruckus that the Shepherd would be on attack.<br>  <br>  I needed them only once, and I had to amplify my voice to prevent a couple of intruders from losing their southbound ends as they headed north.  The pups strutted around with clothing in their mouths for a while.<br>  <br>  A really determined intruder would have scoped the house and used cyanide guns, but not before there was enough noise for me to unlimber my other defenses.  I have this 416 Rigby I use to keep locomotives out of my back yard.<br>  <br>  If an alarm system is bypassed, there is no ruckus.<br>  <br>  But the chance of amateur intruders  gassing dogs or bypassing alarms is about nil.  It is only the professional crooks you would need to worry about...  And you need to worry about them with any sort of alarm system.  Keep your insurance paid up, and make a safe room for yourself and your family.<br>  <br>  But if you need to choose00dogs are an active deterrent, and alarm systems --well they discover them when the home is breached.  Usually a few barks from a thunderous Anatolian or Kuvasz or Pyrenees will send invaders elsewhere in a hurry.<br>  <br>  Of course the flip side of that is that dogs require care.  Care includes being a firm but loving master to a social climber.
fAaLjlI0aa	Laws must be written so that nothing, no detail, is left "open for interpretation". This is intended to prevent the manipulation of laws.|`|RkfIPD7Iaa	The reason they seem hard to understand is that they DO say what they mean.<br>  <br>  The problem is, that laws must explain in exact detail what they are intended to say.  A simple misplaced comma can change the meaning of the sentence, so it is necessary to explain in great detail what the authors of the law want it to say.  There can be no vague or unclear terms, everything must be described.  They cannot rely upon 'commonly understood' terms or words, because those tend to change over time and distance.  What you mean by certain words is not what someone else might interpret.<br>  <br>  So legal documents must always be very specific, which makes them difficult to understand for laymen.
Qmgn6JHLaa	It's unlikely the judge will force the new lawyer to proceed.  But it will depend, for example, on the nature of the case, whether there have been prior continuances and delays in the case, or whether the other party will be prejudiced by further delay.  Bottom line is it will be up to the judge.
jauizC6Vaa	That is why actually creating jobs is important. Health benefits go hand in hand with having a job. Spending a trillion bucks on welfare and fixing crap that isn't broken doesn't qualify.|`|AA11313983	Millions are not without health care.  They simply choose not to visit the nation's many free clinics.  There's a big difference.|`|AA10382849	The poor, the old and the infirmed, all get health care (often free) provided by the federal government and states. As a result, the cost of care for those that work and pay for health insurance is unaffordable except to those with good enough jobs to have employer sponsored plans. Government employees usually have the best plans? Its the working Americans that need some help.|`|fDuCamMraa	No one is without "health care". Just ask all the illegal aliens that are receiving their "free health care". Are you willing to admit they are smarter than you are? Whether you realize it or not that's exactly what you are doing with a question like this.<br>  <br>  Also, people with socialized health care abuse the system to the point that the ones being treated for a hang nail are preventing the ones with heart attacks from getting treatment in a necessary time frame.<br>  <br>  I think the hardcore Republicans are more humane than you are.|`|7PGxqRfZaa	Why is it my or your problem to support the people without health care. that's not my problem, that is there problem. I am a two time war vet without health care. I can not or will not ask the American tax payers to pay for my medical needs. Its also the illegal aliens that are costing the tax payers the bulk of the high health care costs. the tax payers have to pick up the tab for them. it costs billions of dollars a year. That money could be better spent in the schools and pay for the working Poors health care that people that are working poor could use. But we give people who should not be here in the first place all that money instead of legal Americans that kind of care. Why don't you bring that up? oh i forgot, you have to nitpick America about everything that is not perfect in your eyes. Well good luck and never trust the government.|`|oO4TUkVkaa	Health care is the sole responsibility of the individual not the government.  If you need healthcare either get a job to pay for it or go to a free clinic.|`|e9z5oVKPaa	What you don't seem to get is the only ones that are really getting any help with health care are once again those who refuse to work, they are getting even more and those who just lost their jobs are getting part of their premium payed, if they can come up with the rest. Once again the working people who can't afford or who are denied insurance are screwed. So what the **** is obama doing?

Plus health care is not denied to anyone in this country. You are still treated even if you have no health care and many never pay it back.<br>  <br>  Yeah, let the government manage health care.

For most of us, the answer is a laughable "no". Yet, oddly there is sympathy for turning over our most private, personal decisions, not to mention one sixth of our economy, to the same unresponsive, anti-entrepreneurial culture that gave us the response to Hurricane Katrina. Our two largest government-run health programs- Medicare, and Medicaid- are fiscal crash courses that make social security seem like a model of solvency. Steep benefit cuts or much higher taxes will be required to sustain them anywhere near their current form.<br>  <br>  The government can't baby all of us.<br>  Also I'd like to add that i don't have health care, so I'm not being biased.|`|2BWyZOy5aa	I live just fine.  If you really want healthcare you can get it.  The communist media loves to make imaginary crisis out of things.  If we can only get rid of these leeching frivolous communistic liberal lawyers and illegal aliens that are driving up the cost of healthcare it'll be even more affordable.|`|uspTM9cuaa	There is no one who is in serious need of medical attention without it.

S6FLJ64Qaa	The answer is YES!!!  Most branches don't want to admit it, but an MP platoon of 30 soldiers has more fire power than a company of light infantry.  MP's are the only branch authorized to call for arty support in the Corps Rear Area.  We are trained to fight and delay any enemy advance of up to a Level II threat.  (In lay-man's terms, we are called to defeat any enemy action of up to a Brigade sized element of tanks.  If tanks do happen to out flank the Corps, or as in the case of the US advancing faster than expected, it's the MP's that have to HOLD the enemy until our Mech Inf and Armor units can maneuver to engage.)<br>  <br>  I type all of this say, that as an MP you will get more combat training that you'll ever expect; but you'll never the credit for it that you deserve.  If you need something to stroke your ego, then go Cav Scout.  However, if you want to be part of the best, then MP is the answer.|`|n2oEhdZiaa	Not compared to Cavalry, Infantry... or any other combat arms, etc...<br>  <br>  If you want combat training, go combat arms.<br>  <br>  If you want to learn a civilian trade, use your GI Bill to learn it when you get out.  Do something in the Army you can't do anywhere else.<br>  <br>  A platoon of MPs have more firepower than a company of LIGHT infantry because MPs are mounted and LIGHT infantry walks around.  Mechanized or stryker Infantry will cut through an MP Brigade like butter.  Combat Arms are set up to engage Level 1 threats.  Have fun patting yourselves on the back about your Level 2 threats.  Do you really want to be a Combat Support loudmouth talking about how combat arms you are?  Don't be that guy.  That's the attitude that gives MP's a bad name.|`|jH8hIB0kaa	Get an MOS with skills good for employment after service.

q4EXFhV7aa	9 million children died in 2008 from starvation. Many millions of poor all over the world have no access to health care, education, social programs, etc. We've seen the results of your way.....see: Any 3rd world nation. I don't condone or support lazy people, but the many millions of Americans who do everything they can to provide for their families, yet still come up short. We are the party for the working class. That is the majority of Americans. The working class in America is 1-3 paychecks away from being in poverty and needing assistance. Perhaps, from your lofty perch, you  can't see the ground. We, on the other hand, know just how lucky we are to be where we are at.....and we know that one screw up, one lost job, one bad recession, one visit to the emergency room, one injured child would put us in need of temporary aid as well.

You don't think those Unions give the millions and millions of dollars a year they do to Democratic politicians campaign funds in order to see the government actually hold their members liable for their own incompetence, do you?<br>  <br>  NOTHING that goes wrong is EVER the fault of ANY government agency. Whenever anything goes wrong that might 'appear' to be the governments fault, the response is always MORE government, not less.<br>  <br>  As a perfect example, look at 9\11. Every single government agency that had anything to do with air travel safety failed in its duty - from Immigration, to the FBI, to the NTSB to the FAA. The *only* people who did everything perfectly were the privately employed security screeners at Boston airport. They detected every single weapon - but they were all on the list of things that the FAA said were allowed so they had to let them through.<br>  <br>  So... the government agencies failed, the private employees did their job.... so what was the government response? Easy, of course - fire the privte screeners and replace them with more government employees.<br>  <br>  Richard

Above budget spending as for wars or stimulus or bailouts don't appear.

He promised a $500 tax cut, now nobody pays attention to the fact it's not a cut, and it's going to be $400.

It makes for a cute quip, but is no where near the sentiment of all blue collar workers.  I am a union member and do not support Obama or his liberal views.  I am not in the majority where I work and the drumbeat is loud for Democrats every election year.  Those of us that consider ourselves conservative are like a secret society.  That is just something that isn't discussed openly in places like that or you might find your car keyed, tires slashed or encounter open hostility among the more liberal coworkers.<br>  <br>  My husband on the other hand is a typical UAW member.  He doesn't think for himself and if his union "brothers & sisters" support the Democrats (and they always do, no matter who it is) that is who he votes for.  He, like many many like him do not want to give credit where credit is due.  Between the two of us under Bush's administration, our income rose each year.  Our 401K's were going strong and the economy was humming along.  That was due to 6 years of growth that Bush's critics don't want to admit.<br>  <br>  I do not blame Bush for the high prices at the pump or the people that are losing their homes that most likely couldn't afford them to begin with.  We can blame Fannie & Freddie for that.<br>  <br>  Even though this president's ideology will affect me drastically, because the "majority" spoke, I must suffer along with them.

qwaWd14vaa	A Miranda warning (rights) is given only during a custodial interrogation.<br>  The problem that we have to face is that if the warnings are not given upon arrest, and a suspect is arrested, then on the way to the jail starts talking, is this an elicited response or a statement without a warning can it be used? <br>  See Rhode Island v Innis 446 US 291 (1980) a case of subtle coercion by the police and the question of what constitutes interrogation and self-incrimination.. <br>  It is best based upon a situation such as above case that all be given the warnings and if they speak, then they are at their own liberty.|`|TtI7VtTfaa	No|`|u6ALw1gAaa	No.  Your Miranda Rights only have to be given to you if you are in custody and being questioned about a crime.

This is not about the baby. What do you suggest, give the baby citizenship and deport the parents? You're implying that the parents should continue living in the country as illegals, which I am against (because who else would look after the baby?).<br>  <br>  There is no simple solution. But giving citizenship to children of illegals is definitely a step backwards in the fight with illegal immigration. It would then be an even better idea to try to get to the US...<br>  <br>  I think the US should have a 1-year period of lets-grant-all-illegals-citizenship (Sweden had something similar) and then put enormous efforts into closing the border. Then it's a win-win situation. The US would have control of its population and the ex-illegals (especially those born there) could live normal lives. Too bad I'm not American (not even in the US) so I can't run for office. =D

The housing/real estate market which has not bottomed out yet. The retail markets, the bank failures and credit/lending problems globally, unemployment rates, etc. Until the domino affect stops, which it hasn't yet, the markets are not going to just suddenly correct themselves simply because one person makes a statement.<br>  Wall Street does matter, as far as an indicator. It's hard to interpret all of the time because we are so global. I'm expecting to see large drops as well as some spikes back up again. Things are not going to get straightened out for a good while yet. A climb in the market does not mean the economy is back on track and all is well. It simply indicates investors here and world wide, have found comfortable spots for themselves, leaving one area to invest in another, or taking the risks to invest in something that will hopefully make a big comeback, like the housing/real estate market etc., or something they know will be a growth area in the future.<br>  <a href="http://www.marketoracle.co.uk/Article7585.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.marketoracle.co.uk/Article758...</a>|`|ejluOCdTaa	You're right, every time his purple lips move, the DOW falls another couple hundred points....because Wall Street doesn't like his ideas and neither do I.

qwaWd14vaa	A detective would be able to send better samples into lab, but as a toxicologist, you would best use your skills in forensic sciences.|`|b423d42c76a871f7b36abba90dc4c41daa	That would be a good major for a criminalist,not for a cop.|`|DFJ9m4WKaa	It wouldn't be a bad thing. But I think a degree in psychology would probably be more useful. Toxicology would be more useful for someone who is a medical examiner or coroner.|`|emNCaAq7aa	A science degree of any sort is fine for your homicide detective goal. Anything, be it philosophy, a science or even English lit. can be good. Why? because they all teach and practice critical thinking, an essential skill for a detective of any sort.<br>  Some other things that will serve you well is having a general knowledge about everything, learning to keep an open mind and maintaining an interest in life.<br>  All of my most successful colleagues were always learning. They were generalists and often auto didactic.<br>  I always advise people wanting to go into police work not to major in CJ. Takes some CJ classes to get a feel but not as a major. Once you are a cop and see what you need you then take the classes that will help you. Most departments pay for further education once you are through with probation.<br>  So if you like toxicology, go for it, Satisfy your curiosity. A good detective is curious and dogged.<br>  As far as requirements go no police department cares what you get your degree in, just so the school is accredited.|`|amRr8Xstaa	Coming from someone who`s family revolves around Fire,Ems,And Police/Sheriffs`s you want a degree in criminal Justice.|`|W97g4Kwgaa	I think it would be useful if you were going to be a medical examiner|`|qubLyvcRaa	You're probably not going to like my answer, but if you plan on being a police detective, you're going to want to major in criminal justice.  I can';t think of one instance where someone becomes a detective without spending some time in uniform.  Detectives are promoted from the ranks.  You might have better luck at the state and federal level finding a job in forensics with the right credentials.  Forget CSI...you won't be a cop...you'll be a scientist.  Just be aware, a city like New York might have 20,000 cops but only 2 forensic toxicologists, and in most cases they're affiliated with private, contracted labs.  Take criminal justice; minor in forensics or organic chemistry.

2425cc2cee9552b0f1a53567bfd23012aa	This is a great question, but I think the best people to ask are families of victims.  Take a look at what some have said at<br>  <a href="http://www.nyadp.org/main/70308Statements.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.nyadp.org/main/70308Statement...</a><br>  www.mvfhr.org and www.mvfr.org.  You can find links to more at <br>  <a href="http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/victims-and-death-penalty" rel="nofollow">http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/victims-...</a> particularly at news and development from previous years.<br>  <br>  Families of murder victims are nowhere unanimous about the death penalty in principal.  But even those who support it have testified that the drawn-out death penalty process is painful for them and that life without parole is an appropriate alternative.|`|E70A7aqcaa	I can't see how a question can be true or false.  I thought a question was to assist in determining whether the subject addressed was true or false.  If you said, "I think that the death penalty gives 'closure and justice' to families of victims.  What do you think? (or, "Don't you agree?"; or "Isn't that true?")", then you might have set up the question for a true or false answer, but, not as you've asked it.  That having been said, I think that the death penalty does give SOME closure and justice to families of victims.  It will never give total closure and justice, but it's sure a big step in the right direction.  If you want evidence, listen to the families of victims tell you that exact thing.  Sometimes some  tv program will show that, sometimes you'll hear it in the news, but, being a mental health professional with 20+ years experience, now retired, I can  tell you that professional journals are replete with such stories / evidence.  God Bless you.|`|2qQPBDlkaa	it depends on the family...<br>  <br>  some do want that form of closure.. others just want to not talk about it anymore.. still others are happy if the person is captured.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  so in short it depends on the victims families it certainly CAN provide closure for some.|`|KKh8rikGaa	How can taking the life of another give closure,that's BS.

80f46f96ec87da284c65875f2a90422daa	Lets say you join in July before senior year. You will be in the Delayed Entry Program or (DEP). Once you join the DEP you have one year to go to boot camp. (as soon as you graduate). During this year you will not drill like reservist would do. Youd more than likely go to your recruiter office once a week for some kind of training. Basic stuff like physical fitness, basic drill, and Marine Corp history. Now this dependes on 1. If there even is a recruiting station close to you and 2. If you have a good recruiter who cares about sending someone with a little advantage to boot. I am speaking for the Marines. Im sure you do the same for Army. You wont get payed but you will get something better. A slight edge. Once you actually go to boot camp then you begin to get paid. You would join for 4 Active and 4 In-Active. If you have one year of DEP then you would only have to do 3 years in-Active. Good Luck. Join the Marines!!|`|wrLu93C9aa	Only the Army has the split option enlistment.|`|AGQI3NuXaa	You would have to be part of a Reserve unit or have gone through Basic between junior and senior year to recieve pay.

Either you trust him or you don't.<br>  <br>  It's his life and only he can decide if he will trust you not to cheat on him like most do.<br>  <br>  A lot of doubt will be placed into his head.

Many Dear John letters get sent while a soldier is in Basic, or Deployed|`|nDOWKhwCaa	At your age, honestly i doubt you would be able to stay faithful. He's your first true love, which in a roundabout way means you are very naive. You might be able to last a year, maybe two. But eventually 95% of girls in that situation would break it off. <br>  <br>  You really need to think long and hard about this. Is he worth waiting for? And are you REALLY able to wait for him? Don't lead him on if you don't know. Last thing he needs is in 4 years to get out and come home to you only to find you're married with 3 kids.|`|htaxf1jJaa	well it's not easy being a military girlfriend, fiance, or wife. My boyfriend is at Air Force basic right now and it's pretty tough without him, but all you can do is just tell him that you won't cheat on him and that you'll miss him every day and think about him. When he's at basic training, he'll be able to write you so write him as much as possible. you need to support him and be behind him and be with him every step of the way. you cant really "prove" yourself to him, that you won't cheat on him; all you can do is tell him, and he needs to believe it. even if he tells you that he doesn't, deep down inside he really does believe you, he's just scared. and so are you. he'll know that you told the truth when you said you wouldn't cheat on him when he comes home and sees you waiting for him. email me if you need someone to talk to, cause it's always nice having other girls going through what you're going through to be able to talk to you know =)|`|kg3wV0Czaa	He should trust you, but just give him some time. He's probably worrying about it just as much as you are.<br>  Support him through it because once he graduates from basic training, you're going to be SO proud of him!<br>  and he really needs your support because he wants to know that you're making the right decision.<br>  Just give him time because he probably already knows that you won't cheat on him, he's just really worried.|`|bac0c08d67448ca69e882615d8e3b333aa	If he was serious with the question and response, then you need to let him go.

Just be there for your boyfriend if he needs any help (especially emotional).  I know my boyfriend was really upset and nervous right before he left, so for two or so weeks I was constantly reassuring him that he made the right decision.  I've pretty much been my boyfriend's number 1 supporter since he's joined.  I just constantly tell him how proud of him am I.  It's hard being away, but it's all happening for a good reason.  There is a fine line between supporting him and pushing him out the door.  Again, saying how proud you are of him shows your support.  As long as you don't say "I can't wait for you to leave", you should be good.<br>  <br>  As for the cheating thing, I've gotten the same question.  The best you can do is not give him a reason to believe you're cheating on him.  If he continues to ask, be honest and say that you wouldn't.  Even then, some people just have trust issues.  My boyfriend constantly asks me, and I constantly say no I haven't/wouldn't.<br>  <br>  And believe me, it is possible to stay faithful.  I know a few girls that have boyfriends in the Marines and they haven't cheated.  I haven't either and I've been in a long distance relationship since last August (between college and boot camp).
JlNzxOzTaa	Yes even though you are a tenant you still can and should call the police. When they come back don't go out or tell the kids just get on your phone and call the police they will send an officer out and I am sure the company will appreciate you doing so.|`|Gew6pZhbaa	I would recommend mentioning something to the landlord, as well as calling the police next time they come around.

First, is the person being chased because it is believed he or she committed a felony?  In that case the county line can be crossed and the party arrested.  If the chase pertains to a traffic infraction, in order for the authorities to cross the line, they must have an agreement/permission from the county the vehicle is about to cross into, otherwise the unit must break off the chase.  This happened often between Culver City Police Department and the Los Angeles Police Department, back in the 60's.  They were at 'war', which resulted in both entities having to break off chases once the offending vehicle crossed the, in this case, city lines.|`|amRr8Xstaa	Yeah in Georgia we are not to nice to fugitives and yes If you run the Police/Sheriff's`s office or whoever is chasing you is by all means follow you unless you are a dangerous felon and the officer is by himself then it depends on what the supervisor requests but most of the time the officer will keep going emergency while making an attempt to apprehend you or follow you until an available unit is able to assist in your arrest.Or if you are being chased by certain agencies i.e. Las Vegas Metropolitian Police they advise you to continue the pursuit non-emergency if you are threatening human life/property.<br>  But whatever happens one way or another you will be caught.|`|4af080f759d6efef5b302ef31e62b04daa	Try that in Georgia and you will be lucky if you are just arrested and not shot.<br>  So quit running from the cops and acting like a criminal!|`|H652tDkyaa	AS LONG AS YOUR LICENSE PLATE WAS NOT IDENTIFIED AND AS LONG AS NO PESKY PORK CHOPPERS WERE IN THE AIR TECHNOLOGY IS WHY THE PIGS ARE OVER SOPHISTICATED|`|JlNzxOzTaa	Yes as long as the crime happens in his county or it is in plain view he can cross county lines.|`|HHVfLd6vaa	Short answer...yes.

jOucOtVwaa	You were probably going to fast or to close. I was in a parking lot once and i was kidna zipping through and i came up on this cop going the other way and he just flashed his spot light in my face as a nice way of saying "slow the **** down or ill pull you over". You do not need to stop for a police officer unless they are behind you with their lights and/or sirens on. a spot light means nothing.|`|B9YZ9wYUaa	What would I do? Determined if what the cop hand signal is indicating whether I should pulled over or Proceed with my own destination.<br>  <br>  The cop throw his torch to you most probably telling you to get out of here and not cause more traffic, that is what I would think. If on the other hand he wants you to pull over he could give you either the torch signal ling the left or the hand signalling you to go left side and stop there. YOU ARE NOT GOOD ON BODY LANGUAGE do you? Especially if a woman wants you when she first saw you on a given place by her lips or her own eyes, you probably couldn't tell the difference. Next time do not panic once you seen a cop down the road, treat him like ordinary as like anybody else. One of the reason I figure out why you couldn't tell the difference is that you are too SCARED most probably when you seen him down the road pulled over a cop didn't you. So when he held that torch you couldn't tell whether he wants you to pulled over or not. That is why you had waited for 3 minutes to let the cops come to you but didn't happen.|`|btdgVKGbaa	Maybe you passed to close or fast while he/she was pulled over, a gesture to probably mean to watch out next time.|`|qubLyvcRaa	This is probably an answer that's going to get me some flack from my law enforcement brethren, but shining a flashlight at me when I'm doing nothing wrong is NOT going to make me pull over.  Were there any hand signals?  Did he shout as you were going by?  If not, it's adios time!  You're probably right about him wanting to make sure you saw him.  Maybe you came a little close.  In any case, in the absence of any other indicators, I would have kept on going.  As a matter of course, I try to move into the left lane when approaching a cop/vehicle on the side of an interstate and I slow down a bit both for safety and as a courtesy.

0pXBYo4paa	Talk to your recruiter and make sure you research the jobs you would like to do.You will have to take the ASVAB, pass a military physical, and other stuff to get in.<br>  <br>  First you go to Lackland AFB for 8.5 weeks of basic. This is the toughest part of your career. It is similar to any other boot camp, running, inspections, lots of marching, yelling, and exercise.<br>  <br>  Then you go to tech school where you learn your job, this is different for different people depending on what job you picked. There is also some military training here but much less severe than basic.<br>  <br>  Then you go to your first assignment. Here you will gain experience at your job. This part of your career is more like a regular job in the civilian world. You might be a med tech, a airplane mechanic, a cop, an IT specialist, etc. You will also have PT (exercise) three times a week but it's not that bad, just like hitting the gym and doing some running. <br>  <br>  The main difference than a civilian job is that you will wear a uniform, people will have ranks, and you will deploy. Don't worry about deployments, for most AF people, they aren't bad at all. You will have air conditioning, internet access, TV, decent food, and phone calls home.<br>  <br>  It isn't a bad decision at all. I did it for nine years and loved it. I got out so I could use my GI Bill to finish my college degree.  I am going into the Army as an officer now.|`|3xTNOevjaa	theres just too much to tell that you want to know everything.

In some states you can do "repair and deduct:" give the landlord 30 days to take care of repairs, or you will take care of them and deduct the cost from your rent.  <br>  <br>  Do NOT stop paying rent without this.|`|579276f1a955ed5c170f87a86360c3b2aa	IDK where you live but your best bet would be to contact your local housing authority. I wouldnt just stop paying rent though. In order to do that, there is a procedure.|`|icRwgQ7waa	In most states there are certain things that a landlord has to provide - heat, running water, etc. and if those things are not provided you can deposit your rent in the court registry and sue for constructive eviction which lets you out of the lease and the court can determine if you should have to pay rent. If the place is not up to code or the heat is not working, let your landlord know. Get a $2 thermometer and ask him to come over one evening when it is cold to make your point or ask him to have a repair man come over to fix it or if you can hire someone to fix it and deduct it from the rent. If someone is on him to pump the septic tank, that should be fixed soon.|`|enWGuc6taa	Yes, you still have to pay rent. You could have charges laid on you if you don't.  I suggest contacting your local housing authorities and letting them know what's going on.  They would then, issue a citation where the land lord would have to bring up the faulty items up to code, not only for your apartment but the entire building.

They will be sent back or killed based on what they say.  Gangs will run rampant in lawless rage.  Vigilantes, militias, and mercenaries will rule the land except for the cities which they will raid from time to time for supplies until some sort of bartering system can be established.

I'm already ashamed that I sat back and did nothing while Bush stumbled around and:<br>  <br>  1. Walked all over the Constitution by trying to wire tap the American people without warrants.<br>  <br>  2. Bush invaded two sovereign countries (Iraq / Afghanistan) because he wanted their resources.  In doing so, he bankrupted the middle class, raised the national debt, wasted the surplus, killed more American soldiers than people who died in the Twin Towers and killed more Iraqis than Saddam did in his ethnic cleansing programs.  The  Afghanistan puppet, um, leader he put in at first was murdered.  I think that was a clear answer.<br>  <br>  3. Bush promoted torture, which was against the Geneva Convention rules.  OF COURSE our enemies were going to torture!  But that's like Super Man rushing into a house and killing Lex Luthor or a suspected enemy because he was powerful enough to do so.  Super Man proved that he wasn't above the rules...and neither is America.  Also, the torture was on people who hadn't been tried yet.  The same thing happened on US soil with cops on the street.  I think its' safe to say that torture is wrong. <br>  <br>  4. On Bush's watch, the Twin Towers fell.  As one fell, he continued reading to kids.  Another plane took out the Pentagon.  Another crashed in Pennsylvania.  Suppose it had taken out the White House?  Oh, and if this had been another country that attacked us instead of terrorists, we would've been vulnerable.  Communication was cut off.  The media was taken out.  Money and businesses were destroyed.   Cheney was left in charge while Bush took cover.  WE COULD'VE BEEN DESTROYED!  <br>  <br>  5. Bush and Cheney ignored intelligence that told them that Iraq had NO weapons of mass destruction and they also ignored intelligence that told them how the Iraqi guerrillas were going to fight.  They caused thousands of deaths in their oil / gas for invasion scandal.  Oh and they also ignored intelligence that told them that the terrorists were going to attack using planes to hit buildings.  Yes.  Absolute truth.<br>  <br>  6. Bush sent a rescue effort to New Orleans DAYS after the media reported that the storm had hit.  Pictures surfaced showing people being raped, businesses looted, homes as landfills, people living in a stadium... Bush should've been impeached immediately.<br>  <br>  7. Cheney and Scooter Libby released Valerie Plame's (the CIA agent's) name to the press.  The reason?  Her husband spoke out against Bush's policies.  Yes, that's it.  She could've been killed by vengeful criminals.  She had to retire and probably still has to be looking over her shoulder.<br>  <br>  Unemployment rose.  Unions fought for living wage increases.  Wall Street got fat while Main Street begged for the crumbs. <br>  <br>  Know what I think?  I think if Al Gore had become president, we would never have gone to Iraq / Afghanistan.  The tower tragedy wouldn't have happened and jobs would've increased.  We probably would've had a second renaissance.<br>  <br>  And as for Obama...he's cleaning up the stains on America left by the dirty, greedy, corrupt hands of a Republican, so he has to make some hard choices that the Republican Party was too self centered to make.  <br>  <br>  Who exactly should we be ashamed of again?|`|h9BELHOTaa	Why worry about being ashamed 50 years from now. We should be ashamed now of the administration that just left office. Torture, unnecessary war and a ruined economy aren't enough for repubs like you to be ashamed of?|`|GXxC8CIfaa	Hopefully in 50 years we will not be ashamed because we will have ran Baraq Hussein and his liberals out of office and went back to what made the USA great to begin with....FREEDOM, LIBERTY AND CAPITALISM!!!!|`|oWih3AFOaa	I am now.

PWvS7vqPaa	Depends on what route you take and your background.  If you go as a commissioned officer through ROTC and go Guard/Reserve, it is almost guaranteed as long as you can find a unit that will take you in.  This is also assuming that you have passed both the AFAST and Class I flight physical which is what weeds many people out.  If you go active duty and try to get in through aviation, it will be a hit or miss and whether or not you get it will also depend on how well you do in ROTC and school.<br>  <br>  If you go warrant, it will be near impossible to get without prior service.  About 95% of warrants are prior service and not "street to fleet" meaning they just joined the Army.<br>  <br>  EDIT: To guyjones.  Actually you yourself are mistaken about the regulations for medical standards for aviation.  You actually need uncorrected vision of 20/50 in each eye and not 20/200.  If it is 20/50 or better, then it must be correctable to 20/20<br>  <br>  To aaronb.  You do not need ANY previous flight experience in order to fly helicopters for the Army.  In fact, about 90% of new Army aviators have zero previous flight experience.|`|58TDAT1zaa	Everyone else here seems to have forgotten about the requirement for flight hours in a rotor wing aircraft in the neighborhood of 2,000 hours.

Like you should be able to run two miles in less than 14 minutes, and do at least 70 push ups and sit ups in two minutes.

You can also become a commissioned officer but I hear they don't get as much flying time, Warrant Officers are the kings of helicopters.<br>  <br>  You should have no legal or financial problems. <br>  <br>  Basically, you then go to your recruiter and tell them you want to be a Helicopter pilot. They will then give you a list of stuff you need to do. Be prepared for lots of paperwork. <br>  <br>  You will need to take the ASVAB and score high on it. Buy a study guide. There might be another test for pilots, I'm not sure. your recruiter will fill you in.<br>  <br>  It sounds tough, but if you take the steps to prepare, you'll be fine.|`|pFlmFv2Waa	NO its not as easy as some of your friends before me would have u to believe it is to get into flight school you first must be either a warrant officer or a commisoned officer ( sorry no enlisted boys in this part of the house ) also u must at least 20/200 vison without glasses or contacts or laser vsurgery. And meet all the other requirements to get into the army. you can;t of course be afraid of heights or have any toher mental issues that would enable u to pilot an aircraft.

The Heritage Foundation's Center for Data Analysis estimates that by 2011, under the Obama plan, an additional 10 million filers would pay zero taxes while cashing checks from the IRS.<br>  <br>  The total annual expenditures on refundable "tax credits" would rise over the next 10 years by $647 billion to $1.054 trillion, according to the Tax Policy Center. This means that the tax-credit welfare state would soon cost four times actual cash welfare. By redefining such income payments as "tax credits," the Obama campaign also redefines them away as a tax share of GDP. Presto, the federal tax burden looks much smaller than it really is.<br>  <br>  The political left defends "refundability" on grounds that these payments help to offset the payroll tax. And that was at least plausible when the only major refundable credit was the earned-income tax credit.

mSUTWLYeaa	This is a great job. Are main job is to protect protection level  resources 1-4(you wil find out more what that is) but its like planes important buildings and weapons. Its funny cause they usally make the lowest ranking person have the most important job. Le comes second but its fun but sometimes you want want to act like your from lapd but you really cant there are so much gray areas behind it and paper work for it, but giving tickets sure is fun. The main reason i like le is cause sfs responds to like everything on base and sometimes goes off base plus you can drive really fast when you want sometimes you get to drive with your sirans on . Security part of the job is easyer being on the flight line with a car (not sure if all bases have cars) so you will be driving around planes "DONT HIT THEM" for about 8 to 12 hours it could get boring but thats good, you could bring things to work just dont get caught. hmm i think being overseas is better then being state side cause we never never do gates and thats what everbody says thats the worst part of the job, i never did it. plus you get something called cola not soda in easyer terms you get money for living  overseas and you dont get it in state side. For positions  im a a1c and i worked all of them the thing they say about being a sra then you got different positions thats a lie i know airman basic working the senior patrol with somebody higher. (but thats how my base works every one is different, but they your going to have you work lowest one more often but it evens out unless your a dirt bag airman then your going to be having the lowest position all the time) O yeah one bad/good thing about our job is that we get deployed alot, most likely you will find out that your goin to deploy very shortly. i know people who been here for a week or two and got deployed it aint that bad im leaving soon and the good thing about deployments is that you get paid alot of money. One thing that does suck when your new you got to complete your cdcs 4 books not to big not to small and do a qc thats to see if you know how to do your job by the books, for the beginning months of work you should be hitting those books after that i dont know im not there yet haha. but working such long hours with people you get to know them alot better make better friends one rule dont tell on other cops. and there are so many more to the job alot.but if you dont mind being bored for hours then your good, and you can retain alot of information then you got nothing to worry about|`|cdQ59jawaa	Security Forces is not that bad of job. I will tell you that you will not be doing very much LE. Alot of bases are starting to contract civilians to conduct the LE portion of our job. this is because our deployment tempo is so high, all our time at home station is starting to be for training to deploy.We are taking alot of army missions because they don't have manning. If you happen to go to a base that still has SF doing LE you will have to wait to start riding these patrols. As a new airman you will usually start off work the gate, once you get proficent in that then you will move up to a security patrol and the eventually to LE patrol. In my experience you need to be a minimum of SrA to even start riding these patrols and that is usually as a alpha not even the leader of the patrol. You will also deploy quite often. Alot of SF units are on a 6 and 6, which is 6 months deployed 6 months home. This usually turns into 6 to 8 months deployed, 4 months home, 1 month at a training facility and then all over again. We are doing convoys, detainee ops, door to door combat, sniper missions(yes we have snipers) route sweeps with EOD, and just everyday security. The exception is if you go to a nuclear base, and even those are starting to deploy. But there you will only do security.

Similarly, I don't know of any law relating to possession of weapons that is applicable only to minors.<br>  <br>  Depending on your local laws, and the circumstances in which you have the knife on you, you may be breaking laws relating to weapons; but your age would only effect your punishment, not make a crime were wouldn't be one if you were older.<br>  <br>  There are usually laws relating to the type (folding/fixed, one handed opening/two handed opening, locking/non-locking etc.) and/or size of knife you can carry though, so make sure you find those out beforehand.|`|CDe5bEA6aa	If you are referring to a switch blade they are illegal at any age in the usa.|`|pkTE0YwOaa	I dont know many countries outside Usa where people can carry knives apart from the Swiss army knife.<br>  <br>  There are bans on switchblades, legal only in Honduras, and that is criminal offence.<br>  <br>  Swiss army knives are legal to anybody 16 and over so long as you do not kill somebody.<br>  <br>  But that last bit should be obvious.|`|u37jksU0aa	18 years old, and it cannot be a knife that can be opened with one hand|`|1HQavOGOaa	seven and one-half years old|`|aZxzY4Xzaa	my brother does... he's 15

JuCdw9dcaa	Yes it is. The main reason is because the justice system does not punish the person but instead just puts them on probation and then again the same and again the same until they turn 18 and then the real criminal activity starts because now they can't erase the record of an adult. The people need to realize that these teens need to be held accountable and have real punishment. I run a dollar store and see it every day. I even stopped a 14 year old who was with her mother. The teen had stolen some candy and some nails and nail glue. I approached the two and figured to help the mother put the teen on the right path. I asked the mother if the child was with her. She said yes it was her daughter. I told her what she had done. She looked at her daughter and said do you have anything and if you do just put it down. The teen denied it but when I told her I had it on video and described exactly what she had done she admitted it. The mother then looked at me and said whats the big deal. Family Dollar has lots of money so why bother us and then they left. She really taught the kid a lesson. I see this all the time. In 5 years I have had to prosecute over 500 teens and not one had to do any time or have any real punishment dealt to them. All you have to do is go to a Walmart and sit by the cosmetics, or electronics, or hang out by the clothes and you will see them stealing constantly. This is something that should start at home but if we dont start with the young now how can it ever be taught at home. We need to teach to get results. When I was teen I ripped off my grandfathers drug store for 50 grand of drugs. The first time I was caught I got a month in a hospital watching tv and playing ping pong. They gave me a trial visit home as if I had learned a lesson and I wasnt home 2 hours when I did it again. This time I was sent to a maximum security juvie place. Here you did not street walk, use street talk, or laugh. You were here to be rehabilitated. They told you when to pee and when you could get some water. You had to respond with yes sir and no sir, yes maam and no maam. You went to school in the place from 8am to noon. After that you ate lunch and then you were either exercising non stop or sawing huge logs in half. They would make us run around a fenced in area for at least an hour and then tell us to run backwards, then you did situps, pushups, etc. In other words you had to work the whole time. They told us, dont think about getting out and going to a reform school to get it easy because you are in reform school. I knew that if I got out of here I would not come back. Not only did I not go back but almost everyone that was in there turned their life around too. The punishment I got made me turn my life around and probably saved my life. That is what we need today. No tv, radio, video games. If you get caught you lose these and have to work and learn. In other words you learn to respect yourself and also learn what it means to have to work.

For the record, Bush also did a stimulus plan for Iraq.  It totaled $500 billion for 12 million people.  And it worked.  While Iraq's government is now under the control of Iran, it's economy is doing extremely well and is now making multi-billion dollar surpluses.  Obama is doing the same thing, but he is doing it here and with far less money per person.  And as a bonus, we won't be under Iranian control when he is done with his stimulus.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  And not once did I attack you for being racist.
