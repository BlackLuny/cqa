20090202171611AA0iAvF	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	How long till your doctor told you something?	So i am eleven weeks 4 days currently, have gotten my blood drawn twice and asked questions but that is it. my next appt is not until the 17th. i will be almost 15 weeks and they are going to do a pap and the doplar for the heartbeat. My husband is in the military so i go to an on post office. When my blood test came back positive on new years eve they couldn't get me an appt for 2 weeks, plus they never told me that the prescribed my vitamins. They said they will do one sonogram but this prob won't even be until 30 weeks at the rate it takes them to get me an appt. Does anyone else thinks that this is crap? i know this is kind of venting and kind of a question I just get so mad.... thanks for your answers.

20090202163330AAxq5kw	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Why does this keep happening? Im confused? ?	So Jan 20th I was 35 weeks and 5 days. I ended up going to the dr for really bad cervical pain. She sent me to the hospital to be monitored and I started having pretty bad contractions. Since I wasnt 37 weeks they gave me two shots of bethine and sent me home. Then this last Friday Jan 30th I started getting contractions for most of the day so I waited till they were close, about two minutes apart and went in. I was also throwing up non stop since the contractions started. When I got there they were indeed pretty bad and two minutes apart. But didnt change my cervix at all. So they gave me a sleeping pill and sent me home again. Now Im confused why my body is doing this? Why am I just not going into labor. What the heck was the other day then?       With my other two babies I never went into labor on my own. My cervix would get to 2cm and not change even with contractions so I have always had to go onto pitocin.       Some insight?

This is my first time seeing this doctor (new insurance).  My other doctor did not do the prenatal workup as I did not have insurance coverage then.

This is my first pregnancy and I am 34 weeks pregnant and I've known for a long time that sleeping on your left side is most beneficial for the baby because nutrients are more easily delivered to the baby. Before I was pregnant I loved sleeping on my stomach! So sleeping on my sides and back is kinda uncomfortble. But I sleep much better on my right side and back than I do on my left side. My bf is always wanting me to sleep on my left side more and I do try, but I always end up on my right side or my back. So, I was wanting to hear from other women who have had children. Did you sleep in whatever position made you feel most comfortable even if it wasn't your left side and did your baby come out okay?

20090202195917AAx9nod	Pregnancy & Parenting;Toddler & Preschooler	Need to find out the owner or manager of a chuck e cheese?	I called the phone number of my local chuck e cheese to ask about a party. I am almost positive the number I called was a central operator.    The deal is this: My daughter wants to have her birthday at Chuck e cheese and my funds are limited. The smallest bday package is 10.99 but I only need the table, tokens and pizza. She wants all her table ware to be pink and I could care less about her getting a medallion. They have a organizational package that is just what I want for 5.99 but the lady on the phone says it is only for daycares, scouts, etc.    My other option is to just show up but we aren't guaranteed a table, we may have to wait. I don't want to do that on her birthday.   So I figure if I can get hold of the owner or manager, they would surely book it like I want. But try as I might, the only number I can find is the "central" one. Any help?

20090202200946AA3EfKy	Pregnancy & Parenting;Baby Names	The name Gaelic name Innis / Inis / Ennis?	I was looking up names that mean Island and came across Ennis and was  rather surprised to find that Babynamesworld, a generally reliable site, has it listed as female. I do not find it feminine at all, not only because of the sound; but also because of the male's name Dennis and also because of the male character, Ennis, in the movie Broke Back Mountain.      Ennis seems to be an alternate spelling to Inis, which is an alternate spelling to Innis. Both Inis and Innis are listed as male.          What do you think, male or female? I personally think all three sound male. Spelling does not change the sound or make it feminine.

20090202210517AAlXfQY	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Does this sound like teething to you?	My son is 6 months old (born 2 months early, adjusted age is 4 months). These are his 'symptoms':   - He has started waking through the night again - he had been sleeping from 10pm-8am almost faithfully since November until about 3 weeks ago. It started as just a random night during the week, but most of the time still sleeping through and progressively has gotten worse and it's been 4 nights straight of waking now.    - major drooling and trying to put everything into his mouth   - loss of appitite. Tonight he flat out refused his bedtime bottle so I tried nursing him and he didn't seem overly hungry or interested (more of a comfort suck than anything).    - new cry. He has started this new cry that sounds like a cross between the "I'm bored or pissed off so I'm going to just yell at you" cry and the "uncomfortable gassy tummy" cry. (I hope this made sense)   - very 'needy'. today he would cry (this new cry) anytime I put him down for longer than a minute. If he was laying down or in his exacauser I was having to fully entertain him and be close enough for him to touch me or he'd have a little meltdown.       Teething tablets seem to give him a little relief, as with Tylenol. I am not a huge fan of oragel because it tastes like garbage and he hates it. Teething rings and other teething toys seem a bit big for his mouth and he loses interest very quickly.       I feel like I have a new newborn again with him waking through the night and not being ok with being put down during the day. Does all this sound like teething to you? And when your child was teething how long after the 'symptoms' got progressively worse did you see a tooth or improvement in temperment?? Any pearls of wisdom here would be wonderful!! Thanks!!

Since ovulation I have been having a sometimes dull cramp and other times twinges on the side I ovulated from this month (left) that goes through my abdomen down to my  lower back.. I am about 10 dpo and me and my DH was having sex until he penetrated me so hard that I got this extremly sharp pain in my lower left abdomen. I had to make him stop. Because a few seconds after, my entire lower abdomen began to cramp up so bad but mainly on the left to the point where I was about to go straight to the ER. I kept checking for blood because I knew my period was about to start but it never it came. The cramps have calmed down alot except I still feel a dull ache near my left ovary Has this happened to anyone before? What could this be from?

I'm 16 (17 in May) and My boyfriend is 17, and we've been dating for 7 months.  and about 2 weeks ago, I lost my virginity to him.    I was completly ready, he actually wanted sex much earlier than that, but he waited around for me like a true gentleman. and Of course, we used protection.   The thing is, I just told my mom yesterday about it, because I wanted pills; I'm going to be sexually active, and she yelled at me and told me I was too young, and this was all a mistake.   It really hurt me because I thought she would support me, especially because I came asking her for pills and for a gynecologist.       Do you think it was too early, that I am too young?   because I really don't know what to make of this situation.         thanks!

This week, while using the restroom, as I went to wipe, there was blood, a good amount of it too. The weird thing was that, my last period was only 14 days prior to this, it came way to soon. Well it got even more weird. The next day the blood was completely brown like it was old, and then it just stopped. Could this be a sign of pregnancy? I've heard that some women will have an irregular period that will last a day and then the following month they will miss their periods. Is this true? If so, is it to soon to take a pregnancy test?

This entire school year has been nothing but fights to make her go to sleep and fights to get her up in the morning.      When she was living with her mother, she would stay up 1/2 the night and had multiple abscences from school becuase either she would not get up, or her mom didn't want to get up and take her to the bus stop.   To make matters worse for us, our school district was out for almost a month because of Hurricane Ike.      I understand that going from one parent to another is difficult for any kid. But we do not allow her to miss days just becuase she didn't want to get up. And her teachers keep reporting that she is sleeping in class.      We have tried everything that we can think of, grounding, eariler bed time, loud alarm clocks, and everything  we could think of. We tell her it's bedtime and she just goes in her room and lays in her bed but does not go to sleep. She mostly does it when it is just me, becuase her dad works really odd hours, but is home a lot of the time. And if this is not weird enough she has known me longer than her dad has known me. I don't think that she is doing it so much on purpose but it is more in her nature since that is the way her mother is.      Does anybody have any other suggestions that you can offer to help me get her to go to sleep. When she does manage to go to sleep early she gets up without any problems, but those days are few and far in between.      Help anyone

I having a little problem with being in horndog mode 24/7 also, any suggestions with that one. It is not good to be in a meeting and my mind is always on that. I am very distracted.

20090203000330AACOqmk	Pregnancy & Parenting;Toddler & Preschooler	My 3 yr Son won't potty train...Help Plz!?	I have a 3yr lil boy whom we have been trying to potty train for over a year now. At first he was doing good, was telling us he had to go pee, or he had an accident and would go by himself. He never did the other one we figured one at a time right? So I found out I'm pregnant and had a hard time trying to potty train him by myself while raising my other kids and taking care of the house. He starting slipping but was still okay now months after the baby is born he won't tell us about an accident, won't go on on, refuses to go when asked or told. Sometimes when we say he's a big boy now and needs to learn to go he gets mad and says he's till a baby. I need help trying to get him trained normally I would have more patience and let him go at his own pace but my days are so busy and full I don't the time to do it 24/7.      Got any tips? Advice? Could there be any other reason other than he wants to be babied? Are boys different when it comes to potty training than girls.      Also: His sisters trained pretty fast (easy when they want to wear pretty clothes and don't want them *dirty*) he's my first boy and ONLY lil boy in the whole family so no big bro or older cousins to set good example.
20090203011922AADweKj	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	How would you feel if your child had cancer?	i have a little cousin called nicole, who is four years old. she is a very spoiled little girl, who always gets upset when she doesn`t get her own way. she was an only child raised by her single mother. aunt rose had recently got married again. her husband is a man called harry, who was a single father. he has a six-year-old daughter called jade. jade had also been greatly spoiled by her father, who doted on her. after the wedding, the two girls did not get along. nicole often tattled on jade and got her into trouble. jade thought nicole was an annoying little sister. unfortunately, jade got cancer and was in the hospital for ages. she had to undergo many treatments, including chemotherapy, which made all her curly hair fall out. when she got home, people gave her most of the attention. they let her have her own way because of her illness, which made nicole jealous and bitter. nicole feels ignored and left out. she threw temper tantrums and became greatly attention-seeking. she had even tried to fight with jade on some occasion.. there were times when she was mean to her sister. nicole had teased jade, called her names and took her anger out on her. when they go out as a family, jade might not feel well and they have to hurry her home. nicole would cry and scream because she wants to stay and play. aunt rose and uncle harry would just comfort her, saying"we have to go home now because your sister is tired. we will play later." what can i do to help them?

20090202220722AA9JFjA	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Sending my baby to China for a year?	Yeah, this may seem like a strange question, but my in-laws, who live in China, offered to take care of my daughter for a year in China once she turns 6 months old.  Apparently, this is not unheard of in China, or at least for first-gens living in America.  My wife knows a Chinese co-worker who did the same thing.  One thing that we all agree on is teaching my daughter Chinese as early as possible (even earlier than English, since she'll have plenty of time to learn that here), and they really would take good care of her and all that.      I'm just wondering if I can get some professional/experienced opinions on whether or not this might be traumatic or emotionally scarring for the child.  I really hope people can be culturally open-minded when answering this question, as I'm sure a lot of people might be shocked at this question.

Hello all,          Ok so here it goes, my husband and I have bee trying for another baby for 8 months now.

20090202223531AA9l7sc	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Health crisis- what should I do about my cats?	I'm 5 months pregnant and just found out that my cats have 3 different types of worms (which I have been infected with as well) and I'm still awaiting results on the toxoplasmosis. Oh yes and they have fleas too. They were healthy cats for the 7 years I've had them, but all of this junk has come up just since I've been pregnant. What luck.     I live alone (husband is overseas) and my mom came to help me clean my one room apartment so that the cats, who are now on medication, don't re-infect themselves. I haven't been treated yet, and once the other results come in, I will have to make the decision whether to continue the pregnancy, take dangerous drugs to try and fight the infections, or opt out of treatment and see what happens.     I'm scared to death of my cats now. They live in my bed, on the couch, and one just ran through the dishes I had drying on the counter. And after everything has just been decently decontaminated I'm worried about living here now. I mean- should I get rid of the cats, or see them through treatment and myself through mine? I feel bad because they are such wonderful creatures. Plus, nobody is willing to watch them or adopt them, and all shelters in the area are full. If I got rid of them, I don't know where they would go. They have never been outdoors a day in their lives, and how they got these things, we have no idea. I'm devastated though. What on earth should I do?

My periods are irregular and have gone as far as missing my period for a month. I have never had sore breasts before my period started, ever. Since the 22, I have had sore breasts, and since yesterday have been extremely sore! I only get some relief with having a bra on; they are very sore on the sides and my nipples are sore too. I also have had this feeling as if Im about to start since the 22; they come and go. On the 23, I took a First response test, negative. I took another one on the 28,negative. How long do I wait before I take another pregnancy test? Or can breasts hurt for 2 weeks before starting your period. Like I said before, I never have sore breasts before I start. And usually when I get that feeling like Im about to start, I start. HELP!!

So im now 10 weeks along,For the last few weeks i have felt so depressed.And the reason is my bf.First off i am almost 19,My bf is 27.We have been together a few years,And plan to marry.The day he found out i was pregnancy (8 weeks ago) He basically told me to give it up or he will pay child support.After a few weeks i noticed he seemed to change.He finally excepted it and got over it.But he still doesn't want children.He still hopes i miscarry.He says its the best for us.It really hurts knowing that he doesn't really care for his child.He said he loves me to death and he will be with me even if i keep it.He will do his job and take responsibility .But it still just kills me knowing deep down he just doesn't care.He thinks this child will ruin our lives's.I never get to share my excitement with him.I feel all alone.But this is his reason why he feels it will ruin our lives's.He lives with his brother,I live with my parents.I do not have a job,And since last year most people cant get a job,or have lost theirs.I have no car because i cant find a job.I do work,i work about once or twice a week with my mothers company.So i do have ways to make money.Those are his reasons.I have all the support i need from my family,everyone is so blessed that this has happened.Because of all his negativity it just has made me so unhappy.I hate to say it but he has taken away my excitement and happiness about this pregnancy.I love this baby already,And im just so hurt by him.Hes a good man,He just wants the best for me and him.I just don't know what to do,Im happy in-till the baby is brought up.I just don't know what to do anymore.

I think that unless a student can get B+s in ALL of their subjects, they should not allow them to play in sports teams. Most of these boys are VERY happy when thy get to leave for matches against other schools (chanting things like "No homework") yet we have to stay for lessons and we get homework.       Who agrees that unless someone can get a B+ with a 1 for effort, they should be banned from sports teams?

And had intercourse the 18th (day before), 15th and the 13th.   All last week I thought I was having pregnancy symptoms. My breasts were heavy, a little swollen, and a little sore. I had some nausea, and a little cramping.      I've also been keeping track of my BBT, and before I ovulated it was anywhere from 96.2 - 96.8. And now its anywhere from 97.2 - 97.7. I've been surprised to see it at 97.9 for a few days.      Normally I dont get nauseated or swollen/tender/heavy breasts before my period. Just some usual cramping.      The past 3-4 days now, I have not had sore breasts at all. I was a little nauseated and light-headed this morning tho. I also had killer cramps this morning too. I had to take some Tylenol to ease the pain.   Is it normal to get cramps like that during early pregnancy?      I'm supposed to start my period today or tomorrow, but there's no sign of it yet. Except maybe the cramping.         I wasn't stressing about being pregnant or anything. Just excited.      I thought for sure I was pregnant. But maybe I was wrong? Does this mean I'm not pregnant? AF? :(         What do you think?   Advice or Help would be appreciated :)   Thank you.
20090202200240AAHE34S	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	I have started letting my 11 month old "cry it out" am I going to scar her for life?	I always let my daughter sleep in bed with me and my husband, but she is getting bigger and it's not working for either of us.   We now have her sleeping in her crib. At first I would rock her in my arms, she would go to sleep and then I would move her to the crib but she always woke up. So not I am letting her cry it out. She always goes to sleep on her own after 5 minutes. I meet all her needs first. Is this ok to do? I've read so many things that say she is going to be emotionally scarred.

20090202210032AAydnTV	Pregnancy & Parenting;Toddler & Preschooler	Be Honest...will I be doing this when she's a toddler?	My daughter is 7 months old, and currently, she sleeps in a crib next to my bed (I live in a small one-bedroom apartment).        She goes to bed every night at 7:15pm, but will wake up several times during the night.  I have to either pat her back until she falls asleep when she does wake up.  I can't stand to let her cry, so the cry-it-out method just isn't for me.        Will I have to keep doing this "pat the back till she falls asleep" routine even when she's a toddler?  Do any of YOU have to stay with your toddlers until they fall asleep, and have to pat their backs or whatever whenever they wake up during the night?

20090202211837AATEfYU	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	I am an OVERPROTECTIVE MOM!?	I spy on my children! I love them, but I do not trust them. I follow them around.?   I track their cell phones with GPS and secretly monitor every single thing they do online. I follow them around the mall after I drop them off and I did a background check on their friend's families. I love them and want to keep them safe. I read all of their texts and get all the numbers from their phones when they are in the shower. I accompany them to the mall, call all of their teachers every week to make sure they are behaving, I also read their diaries every week. I do this to PROTECT my children from the world because I LOVE THEM!   Is this good parenting, or am I crossing the line? Some parents believe that I am intrusive and crossing the line. I, however, do not. I believe that I am doing what needs to be done in order to protect my children because I love them.

20090202205508AABrnFg	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Is my son teething, or is he sick?	I know it seems silly that I'm asking this, when none of you have actually seen my son, nor can you currently see his teeth!      But for the last few days, he has been cranky, something my son is not usually (He has his tantrums of course...but the last few days have been HELL! )   All he has done is eat (reluctantly...it took about 2 hours for one bottle, I expressed as he is biting now...and it hurt like hell) and scream...and sleep.   No happy medium! He's play times have just been a lot of biting things, and tears.      He has had solids before , two weeks ago he went to town on pumpkin, he absolutely adored it, and now when I go to push the spoon near his mouth, he pushes it straight away...same goes for the bottle.      He doesn't have a fever...but he has a tiny cough, and a bit of a raspy, nasaly cry. Although no runny nose...extra boogers etc.      I know I should talk to the doctor, in fact I have an appointment at 4, I was just wondering what other mummies out there are thinking, and if they have been through the same thing!

The ER doctor said I was not to do anything until I saw my doctor on monday. So I went to the doctor today (there was an improvement! baby still looked good!)and they said I am on bedrest until further notice and it will be for at least the next two weeks.    The problem is I have a 16 month old son that I am not allowed to pick up :( My husband is being very supportive but we cannot afford for him to be off of work to take care of me and the baby. I don't really have anyone that can come sit with us during the day.    I have been staying in my bedroom with the baby gate up to keep the baby in... and he can climb up on the bed for diaper changes and stuff like that. I have also been feeding him on the bed (which is awful as he makes a mess and he won't always stay still long enough to get his belly full).    Have you been on bedrest with small children? Have any tips for me?

Hi All,      I have been in the process of trying to get pregnant for a while and have been looking out for the obvious signs and symptoms... Some which are noticeable, others which aren't!    But one thing has popped up that I'm not quite sure about. I have been getting this fluttering feeling in my stomach Quite similar to an nervous feeling but a bit stronger and a little more uncomfortable.       Now I had never heard of this before. I looked it up on Google and it came up with a few people saying they had it when they were pregnant. Most saying they didn't get it til the 3-5 months. However a small selection of people were saying its part of the implantation process.      Can anyone please tell me if they have had this same query before, if so did anyone answer it for you.      P.S. I worked out if I am pregnant, I should be about 5-6 weeks

20081031114811AAODLJ2	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Pre- Eclampsia stay in the hospital?	I have been in the hospital since October 3rd. And I have a mild case of Pre Eclampsia. When I was first admitted my protein was 306mg and 2 weeks after that it was 336mg. So it is still very very mild. However I am getting extremely upset staying in the hospital, its been almost a month. The doctors both say my blood pressure is good. When I was first admitted it was 210/110 but now it is down to anywhere between 120s-140s for the top and 70s-80s for the bottom number. I just feel like I should be able to go home and not stay here because nothing really has changed.       I am 36 weeks right now and they are talking about inducing me at 37 weeks, but I really do not want to do that because I have gestational diabetes and there is a chance of when she is born at 37 weeks her lungs may not be strong enough. I have been doing a lot of research on the internet and it says 38-39 weeks is a good time to deliver if the baby has had to been in control by insulin. But however the longer the baby is in my stomach is more of a chance for me to turn from good to bad with the pre eclampsia.    I am just so frustrated being in here when I feel like they are just trying to pocket money from me from this long stay.    Should I go at 37 weeks or what?

I am hoping to stay out for   only a months.  By the way I am a Registered Nurse.  Any suggestions would highly be appreciated it.

Its for my 2 year old But I put my daughter on it who is 11 months old and it seemed small so I called my 2 year old on it and I removed his diaper and sat him on and he was two big for it. I decided to Undo the potty and put it in the box to return it the only thing is I couldn't take the pieces off and I just left it. I was wondering if it would be wrong if I returned it knowing I cant get the pieces off and my son had his bottom on it. He didn't use it I was just measuring the area to make sure it would fit but it didn't. I need some answers on what you guys think about returning the Potty chair.

But now some mornings i wake up stiff,my bra is cutting into my sides, not uncomfortably but it leaves a mark. Today i woke up and the muscles in my lower back were incredably stiff., i was also constipated, so maybe it was from forcing stuff out?

What makes some people think that just because a girl has a baby young, that you're so much of a better mother than her at a later age? If she's going to school, and working at 16 to support her baby. How are you so much better than her? Why do you stereotype a whole group of people, cause of what a few have done? If a woman is 25, has no education and is living off of her husband. Why is she a better mother than a 19-year-old who's working and going to school? I'm getting tired of this crap just because of how old some are. A mother is a mother, so why are women being judgmental bitches just because of their age? Seriously, why?

20090202212427AAOe5Sg	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	What would you do if your son helped other kids smash his sister`s piano and rip up all her books?	my nephew, josh, is usually a happy, easy-going kid from a happy, normal family. he has a little sister called sapphire, who is two years younger than him. she is very quiet, shy and a bit withdrawn. the only thing she is good at is playing the piano. sapphire is hopeless at schoolwork, sports, art and almost everything else. she is always playing the piano and singing, both of which she does beautifully. it is very obvious that sapphire has a lot of talent in that area, but she has no friends or social life. one day josh helped a bunch of other kids smash her piano and ripped up all her music books. they even destroyed her cds! sapphire was devastated and in tears. their parents are shocked at what josh had done. it is so not like him. they don`t know how to solve the problem or what to do about it. they are really upset.

20090202212855AAREgoF	Pregnancy & Parenting;Toddler & Preschooler	Should I be concerned about my twins' speach development?	My identical twin girls are over three years old and they do not have good speach skills. They communicate with each other in a sort of baby "gibberish" that only people like me who are around them all the time can understand. So they have a lot of trouble communicating with a lot of people and do not speak the way a normal three year old would, they don't have the vocabulary. I try to tell them to use the right words for things but they always go back to talking with each other in the "gibberish". Should I be concerned? and what should I do about it?

Well i live with my grandpa and im 16 and he provides me with my needs and wants but we get into alot of arguements about education and other things he even threatens to kick me out alot, we fight almost every night and i think he is hurting me more then helping. I wrote this letter to him (http://instavpscom.com/dustin/letter.doc or http://instavpscom.com/dustin/letter.rtf if you dont have the program to open .doc files and what do you guys think of it and is it legal for me to move in with a friend at my age of 16 with his consent (the friends dad said to me today i was welcome anytime if i needed a place to stay) but my grandpa doesn't like the family, so when i am with them right now i have to hide it from him and i hate doing that. I drive a snowmobile for transportation and have a job at the restaurant in town, hoping to get a car soon. Thanks    Also make sure you read the letter or at least some of it, i need to know if its a good idea to give this to him.    Also the file is safe (i had some questions about it earlier) i made it in microsoft word and uploaded it to instavps free hosting.

20090202213012AAbGDAc	Pregnancy & Parenting;Toddler & Preschooler	Weighted blanket for PDD-NOS - Does it work?	My son has been diagnosed PDD-NOS.  I've been (successfully) working with him on his social interactions, but he has some stimming behaviors that I haven't figured out to change.  He chews on blankets, his shirt, toys, and yesterday I caught him chewing his baby sister's hair.  He also flaps his hands against his face when he's excited or learning something new. He also has a very hard time settling in to sleep at night.  I was just reading online about weighted blankets, and I think it may be a help to us.   I'm wondering if anyone has had an experience with them in a child with PDD-NOS and what that experience was.  (and yes, I know I should talk to an OT.. still waiting to be assigned one by the school district)
20090202213221AANGye3	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	I just found out that my son's Pee Wee Football Coach is a REGISTERED SEX OFFENDER...Who can I report this to?	My son plays on a pee wee football team in North Texas. I just found out that his coach is a registered sex offender. I called and talked to the commissioner about it and he says that he isn't required to check backgrounds of the volunteer coaches, and that he is aware of his record, but it wasn't against a child so he doesn't think there is a problem...   I know I can just not let my son(s) play in the association, but its still wrong. He said the man will be allowed to coach again.   I called the Editor of our local paper but who else can I talk to???!!      Any ideas about this would be great. I think parents should know who is teaching their children!

20090202213743AAVfBWl	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	My Dad found a condom in my room. What do I do?	Ahh. I'm fourteen and I was given a banana flavored condom. Hahahaha. It was a joke. So I opened it when I got home, smelled it then blew it up, like a balloon. Thennn I thought 'Ah, what a waste of a banana flavored condom.' So I rolled it up again and put it back in the plastic and left it inside my pillow case. Wellll, my Pa just cleaned my entire room, and he washed my pillows... and I had just remembered 'Oh. my banana condom is in there...' so when I went to check, it was under my pillow, not in my pillow case. He hasn't said anything, and the condom looks pretty used. Geeze, what's a good reason for having a used looking banana flavored condom in your pillow case?

20090202214101AA9rsSi	Pregnancy & Parenting;Toddler & Preschooler	WHat to Do When your 2 yr.old puts something in his mouth at the Dr. Office?	Today I took my 5 boys to doctor for their adhd check up.  That is on the 7,8 & 9 year old boys.  I took my 2 year old boy with us and my 15 yr old with  me to help  control the 3 middle ones.  While we were waiting on the doctor to come in, my 2 yr old opens the bio hazard can and pulls out a cervical broom that used on a woman to do a pap smear, and he put it in his mouth.  I just turned my head for a minute and that happened. It happened so fast it was unreal.  I asked the dr what it was and she told (after asking 3 times) it was used to do a pap smear on a woman.  They do a hepatitias test and a HIV test on him.  I don't understand why they would leave something like that where a small child could get a hold of it.  She did tell me that it was used last week, but why didn't they empty their trash can.  The other room that they put us in later, the trash cans were empty.  I am upset, and worried. I am upset with my self as well, but it happened so fast.   What if that woman had some type of STD?  I hope someone can help me understand.
