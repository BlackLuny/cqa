TRUST ME!!!!!!!!!!!!<br>  Anser mine? <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=Ardozow0HgoZJHs9rJZi3o7sy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090307173707AADd3Ve">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|kEZFplC9aa	I suggest that you<br>  use a pair of cuticle<br>  scissors and trim the<br>  hair as close to the skin<br>  as possible. this will prevent<br>  the hair from growing back<br>  in a wire-like fashion. plucking<br>  would make the area pretty red,<br>  swollen, and uncomfortable. veet <br>  could also react with your skin in<br>  a negative manner because of its<br>  chemical content. i reccomend that<br>  you just trim it, if you really think it's <br>  that bad. I hope I helped. (:|`|7z3N8Cafaa	dont shave it!<br>  depending on how bad it is u should either pluck or wax|`|hQNHzc6faa	I wouldn't use veet cream on the face. I'd suggest plucking, since you said its not visible from far, theres probably not too much hair there. Plucking might sting a little at first, but once you get use to it, it doesn't hurt at all.|`|3imLjQlHaa	You should either pluck it or wax it. Shaving doesn't make it grow back thicker but it WILL make the hairs grow back all at once (which then does make it appear thicker). Waxing and plucking lasts longer than shaving!|`|Zk5PTmrfaa	PLUCK IT.<br>  <br>  I pluck mines with a tweezer. I put ice to numb it and it doesn't hurt.<br>  MAKE SURE YOU DON'T PLUCK TOO MUCH OFF. Just ask your mom to watch your while you're doing it or pluck a little bit off at a time and look at it closely.|`|uRbeSOMwaa	You should honestly wax it, its the best way to do it. It wont grow back thicker<br>  only if you shave it.<br>  Waxing isnt really that painful, its the plucking that it<br>  good luck|`|ujnwIQhSaa	ask your hairdresser<br>  she could give you could advice on whether to shave or wax it.|`|q90ozSQ9aa	No, never shave it.. Braid it.
sZMa0s7Baa	Yes they fit SO strangely. I bought a pair a few years ago and they are so freakishly low-waisted that yeah you have to keep pulling them up. I hate them.|`|K4Pwd3kfaa	Umm, don't own Hollister jeans, and I prob. never will. I'm more of a J.Crew/RL/Lacrosse kind of gal. But ya, it seems to me that the girls that your talking about are just wearing them to show off their bod....even if they don't really have the kind of body type to fit into them.<br>  They should really consider Hudsons, or Citizens of Humanity! :)<br>  They fit the curves better (more flattering figure). It'll make it more comfy! :)|`|BCgp7GTpaa	no they dont fit me.  Those girls wear them for the brand name not the fit.|`|2WJQmnKzaa	i have one pair, and i lost weight since getting them, so they're a little big... but, they  make your butt look awesome. idk, i prefer american eagle jeans!|`|ZxD8kbzoaa	i dont see a reason why they wearing them then<br>  i personally wear them but not too tight|`|4t6nn7pwaa	lol i wear hollister jeans but they're always tooo big on me..soo the girls you know must be pretty big. (not to be mean) hahah.|`|rHKW1CJJaa	No! those jeans are made for girls with no hips, no ***, no figure. i cant put them on up to my thigh, and im a size 4 in other stores size 7 in hollister|`|OtluuQXhaa	I think one of the other girls meant 'Lacoste' not 'Lacross,' One is a brand, the other s sport, if you wear it, you should have the name straight. Chip and Pepper jeans fit nicely. I have a pair of Rich and Skinny jeans and they are seriously fabulous and show your butt, and never droop for me[but I wear a belt].

V2F8YCa2aa	It means that Edward had a great night with Bella; the best of his existence. But he doesn't want to think of it as good when he hurt Bella.

D20ue82Iaa	Victoria's Secret Very Sexy push-up.  Just the classic push up.  Works WONDERS.  Adds a cup size without making you look fake.  They're absolutely amazing.  I wear one pretty much every day and I used to have the same problem.  They help tremendously!!|`|1C123Xdsaa	Doesn't matter. Some guys prefer smaller breasts- I know I do. It doesn't make you less of a woman, and it shouldn't make you feel less of a woman either, as I know some girls small in that area can feel like that. It just means you will be more 'in proportion' to the rest of your body if you are a petite person anyway.<br>  <br>  Also, you are 15. You are still going through puberty, so there is still time for them to get bigger, if that's what you want. But if they don't, or do, but not much bigger, it's really no big deal.<br>  <br>  You look very pretty by the way. I really hope that doesn't make me sound like a dirty old man. I'm not that old- I'm 27, but you are only 15.|`|7Gf3kWdJaa	I am also a 32A and I am 15 years old. It's hard for me to find the right bra, but VictoriasSecret Biofit Bra fits great and is the only bra that gives me cleavage.  The pushup bras they sell dont even work for me, but this bra works really well! Also, you can wear bras that have alot of padding in them, and stay away from V-neck shirts, or any shirts that are lowcut.  Bras with racerbacks (criss-crossed in the back) enhance your cleavage. Hope this helps =]|`|GMIsOYYCaa	Oh please, who cares! From your picture you look incredibly beautiful! Why would you want a bunch of stupid boys looking at your chest when they should be looking at that pretty face of yours? "Hello dummy my eyes are up here!" ;)<br>  <br>  Also, you have plenty of time to grow. My boobs increased a whole size when I was a senior in high school and that is very common. Then you'll have a beautiful face annnd a chest and the boys just won't know what to do then! :P|`|pxuOuQGiaa	i'm 15 too and i'm 34 A :( and it sucks <br>  <br>  But you gotta live with it. I'm skinny so it looks like i got something but really i have like nothing at all lmao. If you work out and stand up straight your boobs appear bigger|`|P3OWfxi5aa	use a padded<br>  that should help<br>  :]]|`|7z3N8Cafaa	yeah im like the same as you<br>  so like i get bras at VS push ups<br>  and for like other occasions..like when i go out <br>  theres some that are like extreme push up<br>  just find those ahhah|`|0853971cb093d5dece221ce25779cb76aa	get bras with a lot of padding|`|e7WpIxuhaa	I'll make them bigger ;)|`|2K43LgeWaa	you are pretty hot..... thats all that matters :)|`|SBPd5W5oaa	lol so am i.<br>  and i'm 5'6 and you can really tell.<br>  i wear push up bras, it does a little lol.|`|e633afd58fd578ab66287bf7228318fcaa	I'd say, pad once in while for fun, if you like - but don't get into doing it always. That might just you shy and feeling inadequate (like you "ought to" have had bigger breasts or something).<br>  <br>  32A breasts really get joyful when their owner stands up for them - so I'd suggest just something very dicrete that feels really nice on your skin, but not try to create an impression radically different from reality ;o)<br>  <br>  It is much better if you can avoid the feeling of hiding away or having to hide. Nice inner smile, and a discrete bra (or none in informal situations I suppose is okay too - maybe depending on which country you live in ;o)<br>  <br>  I think there is a vast different between girls trying ornament themselves a little to look nice the way they are, and then girls who try to look something they are not.<br>  <br>  The first kind is by far the most fun to be with ;o)|`|ZvLmuCiOaa	i do have the same problem i'm a 32 AA ( and i'm 16) so don't feel bad.<br>  use badded ones or just ones that fit<br>  to make you look a little bigger wear tightly fitting t-shirts.|`|3Z9npp2maa	Don't even worry. Lots of guys don't even care about that.|`|NIHXUmN1aa	FYI, as long as you are cute 32A can be very hot...|`|3imLjQlHaa	I think that the size of a person's chest depends on genetics and also their body type. I was a 34 B in highschool, and then when I turned 18 and went to college I went up to a 36C! So it could be possible that your chest might grow more.<br>  <br>  If it makes you self-conscious, you should get measured at Victoria's Secret. No matter the bra size, they have a lot of really cute bras, push-ups, and padded bras that are good quality and will make you feel good about yourself. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps! :)|`|L4xSeRNzaa	i used to be the definition of flat chested when i was 15. now i'm 17 and a 32 E, it sucks!! being flat can be a miracle, you can still wear really cute tops. i can't fit into half of them, so consider yourself lucky!|`|NXLjk0uvaa	my little sister is the same age as you, and she is flat-chested too. dont worry, your only 15. give them time to grow. be glad there the size they are. because when your older, and you got big boobs, you will wish you never had any|`|1d189d211710842a2fef70f9f5dbf40baa	Same!<br>  (age and size!)<br>  But yeah, i use push up bras and they make you look a little bigger but yet its still your size.<br>  <br>  i got em at walmart|`|27hANXS4aa	Victoria secrets miracle bra is truly a miracle. Its worth every penny.|`|uRbeSOMwaa	who cares, you still could be beautiful|`|ArFFUPTBaa	yes|`|8XL8aC3Qaa	man, dont worry about that.. it doesnt really matter

6uzQB9OYaa	you scrunch the top part down so that it is just the feet and the scrunched part over it (if that makes sense). the stick your left foot in and pull it up and unscrunch it until its up to your waist and do the same with ur right foot. o and if i were you i would take it off in the bathroom at the dance and then put them back on in the last 5 minutes in the bathroom. unless ur mom is chaperoning. lol|`|bA5jbtJXaa	before u put them on bunch them at the toe and then pull them on. its so much easier|`|QxTIkv3Jaa	wear them|`|zX80VRbmaa	This seems to be the umpteen times you asked the same question.<br>  <br>  Answer is in the below website. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://pantyhose-legwear-fashion.blogspot.com/2009/03/how-to-put-on-your-pantyhose.html" rel="nofollow">http://pantyhose-legwear-fashion.blogspo...</a>|`|evG6zBBKaa	Bunch themto your foot, and pull it up; its easy. <br>  <br>  Or else you can take them off when youre at the dance.<br>  <br>  It's usually hard for everyone.|`|pHTSL3Ylaa	you should wear pantyhose they are really easy to put on|`|DnQn8Q2Kaa	I've got a technique, but it's hard to explain here.

TfJn3KJvaa	Hair typically grows 1/3 of an inch every month no matter what but if you take good care of your hair you can grow up to an inch a month.<br>  <br>  I suggest taking hair, skin, and nail vitamins, available at any drug store or wal-mart. Things to look for are vitamin B complex, vitamin E, and biotin (vitamin b7). Eat healthy and get plenty of protein and dark green vegetables. Hair is mainly composed of protein. Eggs contain a ton of protein. Also foods containing "gelatin" are good for your hair such as yogurt and jello. Google "hair growth foods" for ideas. Also try daily scalp massages using your fingertips to stimulate hair growth, it gets blood flowing in your scalp and feels great. Avoid frying your hair at all costs. Get plenty of sleep and excercise, especially cardiovascular excercises like running. Avoid caffeine, nicotine, and stress. <br>  <br>  A good conditioner is also important. Sunsilk is amazing and cheap, the kind I am currently using contains jojoba oil wich is AMAZING. Any sunsilk product is amazing and cheap.<br>  <br>  If you have fried hair, do not dye it anymore and try hot oil treatments, and do not use shampoo every day. I leave contitioner in for about 5 minutes before washing it out to keep mine looking healthy. If you have split ends get them trimmed to avoid it getting worse.|`|YwHl37Hgaa	Massage small amounts of fresh or canned coconut milk into the scalp and keep overnight if possible or at least for a few hours.

But getting trims once and a while actually helps hair growth and helps split ends. Also, eating grapes increases strongness of hair roots. That will also help.|`|Z94iLLamaa	Trimming your hair once a month helps A LOT.<br>  <br>  Also, a few of my friends have been taking pre-natal vitamins and they swear their hair has been growing like crazy.<br>  <br>  SO, try both of those out.|`|Cfe7NoTdaa	You can't really speed up the process any more than what is natural but you can maximize your hair growth by taking a multi vitamin and treating your scalp nicely. Vitamins are what your hair needs to grow, that's the most you can do aside from massaging your scalp and stimulating the hair follicles. But don't worry it's not too slow after you start taking them!|`|FVEXxD83aa	just be sure to take really good care of it, if you have any dead hair cut it off. don't use any heating irons on your hair or use blow dryers. also when you are drying your hair off don't rub it with a towel, you should let it dry naturally but if you have to use something to dry your hair use an old t-shirt b/c the fabric is less damaging to your hair.<br>  i also found this website helpful<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.longlocks.com/how-to-grow-long-hair.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.longlocks.com/how-to-grow-lon...</a>|`|vLAaeKmdaa	Getting your hair cut regularly is important.

Don't ask us to pick stuff for you, we don't know who you are or what would suit you.  Wait until you find something that really speaks to you, then put a picture of it on your mirror so you see it every day for six months to a year.  If you still want it, get it then.<br>  <br>  But seriously, don't just get tattoos to have a tattoo, it's about getting a design you love permanently etched into your skin.|`|hR3tXBSVaa	if your getting a tatoo you need to think because you cant change it when your old its permanently so choose wisely i would never do it the man or woman might mess  up and its permanent so choose your answer i dont answer people questions in life i give them decisions and its yours to answer|`|GwB74Dmwaa	i dont like tatoos<br>  but the one Nichole Riche has on her foot is rele cute

8cLuIxRmaa	Put a lot of conditionner.  Also, don't towel dry your hair, it damages your hair and it makes it frizzy.  You could also try Bio-silk therapy oil.  I use it, and its pretty good :)|`|RwRxrjLdaa	well i know a shampoo that keeps your hair straight i think it's pantene. Otherwise you can go to the salon and get your hair permanently straightened.

WewCtMpzaa	The first thing you want to try to do is "tilt" or "thrust" your hips forward slightly in one smooth motion and swing the pleats forward, just as you sit. This action takes a bit of practice and requires good timing. The idea is that the kilt should be swinging toward the back of your legs as you sit. <br>  <br>  The second thing you want to is sweep your hand from the apex of your buttocks toward the back of your knees in one smooth motion, smoothing your pleats as you sit. <br>  <br>  Both of these actions combined, can be done quickly, easily and without drawing attention. The end result will have you sitting on your smoothed out pleats and will be more comfortable and cause less wrinkling to the back of your kilt.<br>  <br>  Once you are seated, the front apron of your kilt should fall down between you legs as you spread them, particularly if you are wearing a sporran. If not, nonchalantly place you hand in your lap to weight down the apron enough to close the gap.<br>  <br>  Just from my experiences, and hearing horror stories, it's best not to go commando or regimental if you are going to be sitting around kids. Especially kids you do not know. Best to wear underwear in these occassions because if you ever get the wrong parent, at the wrong time, you might get a visit with the local cops from a complaint as they will not understand if you accidentally flash a child. There will not be any excuses, and many see wearing the kilt outside formal occasions as a little weird, so it will not be hard to make you look like a pervert, among a jury of your peers who will not really understand kilts, and will often stereotype them just for Scots, in Scotland. <br>  <br>  There are many American men who wear Kilts, and even watch Yahoo Y&A.|`|9556ce3b5bbc6563054ca4da2c6f3a96aa	very carefully|`|Sf6EkDGJaa	What are the chances that a kilt-wearing man who has an informed opinion on the right way to sit while wearing a kilt and going commando will just happen to be reading yahoo answers at the moment you ask this question? <br>  <br>  <br>  I couldn't even get any answers to my question about which computer monitor to buy.<br>  <br>  Maybe most guys who wear kilts don't care if people see their "packages."<br>  <br>  <br>  But now I'm curious. How do YOU sit while wearing a kilt?|`|YmyTWhsUaa	don't do those two very weird things at the same time!

e1434520b7d6b7db2b483084c9ad434aaa	You can have your hair "permanently straightened" with a chemical treatment at a salon.<br>  Pros:<br>  really straight hair<br>  Cons:<br>  not actually permanent (roots will grow back curly in 4-6 months)<br>  expensive (about $200)<br>  really damaging (esp. for permed or dyed hair)<br>  <br>  You could also invest in a higher quality flat iron (chi, sedu, fhi, etc.) and heat protectant spray to use while straightening. (This protects the hair as well as helping with the straightening process.) Your other option of course is to wear it naturally curly. Flat iron your hair perfectly, you're happy for a day; stay curly, you're happy for life!<br>  <br>  Here are some tips if you're interested:<br>  *Try to find a stylist who knows how to work with curly hair. A great tool for finding curly stylists in your area: <a href="http://www.naturallycurly.com/curlsalons" rel="nofollow">http://www.naturallycurly.com/curlsalons</a><br>  *Don't shampoo every day.<br>  *Comb conditioner through hair in the shower.<br>  *Apply styling products to dripping wet hair. Scrunch or twirl hair to achieve desired shape.<br>  *Use styling products suited for your hair type. Don’t know yours? <a href="http://www.naturallycurly.com/hair-types" rel="nofollow">http://www.naturallycurly.com/hair-types</a><br>  *Avoid terrycloth towels on hair; use linen, paper towels, or t-shirts instead.<br>  *Air dry or use a diffuser with your blowdryer.<br>  *Don't touch (or brush!) your hair while it’s drying.<br>  *Once completely dry scrunch out any crunchy texture.<br>  <br>  For hair type specific products check out these forums:<br>  <a href="http://www.naturallycurly.com/curltalk/" rel="nofollow">http://www.naturallycurly.com/curltalk/</a><br>  There you can find others with the same hair type and try out some of their favorite products. I would recommend something, but I don’t know your hair type. :)<br>  <br>  Lastly, it has made my hair so much better since I started the curly girl method! I used to almost never wear it down (it was a frizz/poof ball), but now I have pretty, shiny curls. ~:) It’s pretty radical—no sulfates (shampoo) or silicones—but it’s so great for curly hair.

TAKE GOOD CARE OF YOUR HAIR. don't dye it, curl, etc. also, your hair doesn't like braids. sooooo....good luck...<br>  <br>  LASTLY; eat healthy and take vitamins.|`|ExbiiL18aa	Dang, lucky!!

VenYUtH6aa	its easiest to put pantyhose on by first holding onto the opening but bunching them up all the way to the foot so you can just put your foot in and the pull the pantyhose up over your legs. its kinda hard to explain but its really easy this way!|`|QxTIkv3Jaa	trust rain, and they make u look hella sexyier|`|zX80VRbmaa	This seems to be the umpteen times you asked the same question.<br>  <br>  Answer is in the below website. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://pantyhose-legwear-fashion.blogspot.com/2009/03/how-to-put-on-your-pantyhose.html" rel="nofollow">http://pantyhose-legwear-fashion.blogspo...</a>|`|dBHbmPJXaa	Yeah, I wear them all the time for my job here goes....<br>  1. start with one leg, slip onto foot and pull up to knee<br>  2. go to the next leg, slip onto foot and pull up to knee<br>  3. stand, and grab both sides, and pull of of it up<br>  4. there usually a size chart on the back, so make sure you have the right one <br>  Good luck lol|`|AA11039144	If you're having that much trouble, first off get a size larger, even if the package says they will fit. Stretch them before you start.  Gather them in your hands with thumbs on the insides of both legs all the way to the toes. Pull each leg up to your knees, then pull  up each one a few inches at a time, going from one leg to the other. Pull the panty part up after both legs are up all the way.<br>  <br>  If you want to take them off when you get there and back on before you go home, take a second pair two sizes larger.  They might sag around your ankles and knees after a few minutes, but if you're just wearing them home they'll probably be fine.  Experiment in advance  if you can afford to.
3e0rDOWTaa	you may be mature and ready but your body isn't. The fact is, your body is still growing and as you grow, your skin stretches. If you get a tattoo now, by the time your maybe 18-20y/o your tattoo will most likely look smudged and stretched and it won't look so nice. You should wait until your at least 18 if not older... that way your tattoo will stay nice. :)|`|oE0ApHqPaa	I really, honestly think you are too young.  Not just because your tastes *will* change as you get older, not just because it is illegal pretty much everywhere, but also because your body is still changing.  Placing a tattoo anywhere right now is no guarantee that that is where that tattoo will be in five years.  <br>  <br>  Why don't you guys all get matching star necklaces or something until you are old enough?  Tattoo shops will still be there in 5 years, and the longer you think about it, the more you can be sure that you will love the idea.  Not to mention, a higher caliber of artist will be available to you when you are of legal age, not just the unethical, untalented trash that would tattoo a 13 year old.|`|YR9l82vmaa	yes you are WAY too young. i have 5 words for you...: that's. the. stupidest. thing. EVER.<br>  <br>  at 13, you CANNOT POSSIBLY be "mature and ready". <br>  you have NO idea what you're getting into. sometimes you can't get a job if you have a visible tattoo. are you "mature and ready" enough to have known that? i think not. you would do better to wait until you're like 17 or something to get a tattoo, because then you will truly be mature enough to know what you're doing.|`|ccfc74c2e86ff0eb10b0a97d88d52397aa	No one is "mature and ready" at 13. I think you are too young to get one, and who gives a crap about what other people have or don't have? Seriously, who cares?<br>  <br>  Even if you parents are allowing this (If you have halfway decent parents, I bet that they would say no...) I would still wait until you are 18 or so. It is very difficult and painful to remove tattoos.<br>  <br>  I take it back. Your mother agreed. I'm 17 fyi and your mom is a complete idiot. Complete idiot, I'm sorry...|`|6CMfKxiMaa	you can go ahead and think your done growing but if you want to risk growing more and stretching it out to look like the biggest piece of crap, you can go right ahead.<br>  pathetic that it seems like you have to get a tattoo in order for you to feel as if your "cool" or show something off to others that don't have it.|`|uKk3SycLaa	If you doubt it, or need people to tell you if you're too young, you're not ready for one. And you'll probably get something gay anyway, and look back at it when you're like 21 and be like "wtf why did anyone let me do this." trust me.|`|Dx9h0qkFaa	I think you are a little too young to get a tattoo, and I think you should put a lot more thought into this decision. Think about how it will look when you are older and your body changes, you'd have a wrinkly tattoo.|`|oJ9NpqALaa	yes i think your too young|`|bv0FRBsvaa	yea 13 is pretty young..thats about how old i was when i starting thinking about getting a tattoo.. never really got serious about it until 16 tho..when i found the perfect one for my first. i talked to my parents about it (in an adult manner). they suggested waiting until i was 18, that way i could do it under my own will..and to make sure i really want the design i picked out.<br>  so i'll always suggest to anyone thinking of getting a tattoo, to just let it sit for a while. because people changed their minds allll the time.<br>  i'm really glad i did wait.. <br>  always for the first tattoo, its a good idea to have it small..and in an easily hidden spot. i mean if you feel you're ready and your parents are okay with it.. i'd do it in your situation. just keep in mind that your body is still changing, and make sure its something you honestly want for the rest of your life.|`|e58544fb1f0f5ebf5d43bfd9902e3ebcaa	Sorry, but yes I do think 13 is too young for a tattoo.  I know it took me like 20 years to decide on my tattoo-since I knew I would keep it forever, I wanted to be sure what I chose.  Tattoo's have to be carefully taken care of at first too-you can get badly infected (I can't help wondering if your mother understands this).You can even ruin the tattoo itself while its healing(a friend had one done at 16 with out it being explained to her how to care for it and ended up with the center of it being empty/no color) by scratching too much while its scabbing over. Also, even though this is wrong to do, alot of employers wont let you have a tattoo showing-I hate that! In my case it meant keeping my leg covered all summer!|`|q84KT11saa	It may seem like a great idea now, but later on down the road you will likely regret it.  At that point there isn't much you can do.  So yes, I would say your too young.  You will think a lot differently when you are 20 or 30 or so on.  You change as you get older, personality, style, etc.  What you think is "cute" or "awesome" today, may not be so great in another 7 years.  Regardless of your decision, make sure it's not something you will regret later on down the road.|`|3qUrG9Uaaa	It's not even about maturity at this point, there are physical reasons you shouldn't get one at 13... as your body grows, your skin stretches, this will distort a tattoo you get anywhere on your body (except possibly the feet, but it's still a good possibility). It'll look distorted within a year. Also, if you've found an artist who'll touch you, congrats because nobody reputable will tattoo anyone under 18 for any reason. A star was my first of about 25 tattoos btw... so at least it's a good, non-specific choice, but it'll look terrible by the time you're 18 and ready to cover it up with a better looking one... please wait... maybe get a piercing instead.|`|x9p3bXpCaa	I don't think you should get it so early. i mean you may think you're mature but really you're not. just think that if you get a tattoo now and you don't like it in a few years, or even months, there's nothing you can do. it's gonna be there forever. unless you wana go through painful, expensive laser surgery which will leave you will a big scar where the tattoo was. i'm being so serious. wait until you're older. there's no real reason for you to have one now anyway. just think about it. do you really wana be stuck with some little heart or flower that says "love" or "strength" when you're 60?|`|dvZ7OyUKaa	Gawd! Im 13 also but i would not dare get one! They hurt and can not be helpful in life. What about when you are old and wrinkly and the tattoo is all icky and messed up. Grannies with tattoos are not cute. I think a tattoo is a big desision that you being 13 might not be able to make and you might regret it later in life. If you still want one maybe when you are 18! Im not judging you but i think you should wait.|`|Noi62Kk6aa	I'm not judging the idea, it seems cute.<br>  But I do believe your a bit young to be getting a tattoo.<br>  <br>  You can't get a tattoo until your a bit older [16...] I thought.<br>  I'm thinking the US and England. I don't know about other places.<br>  <br>  Its good that its a family thing but I really believe you should wait a few years.<br>  it will be even more special to you then c:|`|lgMZJQtwaa	heey<br>  um yeaah wayy to young fersure! i mean why would you even want to go through that pain and people will think you are a total skank and they will judge you and i guarentee when yuo are older you will change your mind i know my aunt got one when she was older then you a little rose on her toe and she got it removedf and wished she never did it.|`|RUBrEPCpaa	Well, if you have made your choice, I have 2 things to say.<br>  <br>  1. don't get one too big!!!!<br>  <br>  2. Your going to have that on you forever, so you should get a picture, and put it everywhere you go, if you don't get tired of it, then that's your tattoo!|`|E01GXmQeaa	if your tattoo artist agrees to tattooing you he/she is a moron and should lose his/her license immediately and have his/her arms amputated.|`|zDJ26bktaa	No reputable artist will work on you.|`|ZYi2ZlUnaa	Yes, I am 12 years old and I don't know KNOW a single person in my life with a tattoo.|`|9aLNaMP3aa	You're too young. A good tattooist wouldn't ink you at that age.|`|K3osgjgpaa	yes|`|0Wtm8Bh9aa	Wowwwww.....dude. I didn't even have my ears pierced at 13 let alone a tat...where do you live that you're getting these ideas? I don't think it's even legal to do that is it? You're still growing!<br>  <br>  And let me tell you something...I am 19 and I don't even know what I want from my life yet. I'm really still a baby myself...I just got a tat but it took me almost a year for me to confirm to myself that I was sure that I wanted it. I mean, I knew exactly what I wanted and it was in memorium to someone I lost and loved but just to be SURE, I waited. If you want a tat that badly then wait a few more years to make sure that you still want it but for godssake WAIT! I guarantee you will regret it if you don't...especially at 13. Who knows how Im even gonna feel about mine in the future, even if I lovee it now? My piercings can always come out and close up but a tat is forever...please choose wisely. And if you got it already, I guess good luck...|`|IS1F69mraa	Your mother should be reported to child services. This is extremely illegal and all of the children you know who have tattoos will live to regret their decisions. Wait a while until you are at the very least 16, if not 18, and then get it done.|`|m0yH6gokaa	Noooooo. Don't do it.<br>  <br>  When I was 12 I wanted a tattoo SO bad I begged my mom for a week straight, and then asked frequently for the next 2 months.<br>  <br>  I wanted a tattoo of the sun with an "A" in it (my name begins with A), on the small of my back.<br>  <br>  And now, I'm 19, and I'm SO glad I didn't do it. <br>  <br>  As I got older I decided that I never want to put something meaningless on my body forever. When I get my tattoo (soon!) it's going to have very significant meaning to me, and every tattoo after that will have very significant meaning.<br>  <br>  And when you're 13, you think certain quotes or things are cool, and then when you get older you realize how immature it was.<br>  <br>  How would you feel right now if you got a tattoo of the teletubbies when you were 5? You'd regret doing it...<br>  <br>  And in 8 years you'll probably think the thing you want a tattoo of is stupid, just like you think having a tattoo of the teletubbies would be stupid.<br>  <br>  If you want to do something cool, that won't be there for life, get a piercing. It'll be much easier to get rid of than a tattoo =)|`|E64uM9Hwaa	its gonna look like ****|`|SLzoK3f3aa	Maybe it’s just me but I’ve noticed that tattoos seem to be no longer “cool” like they were over the last few years and I live in Los Angeles which is a pretty happening place if that matters any.  <br>  <br>  I do think you are too young but you definitively sound mature.  If you go through with this then read the following tips:<br>  <br>  1. Get a small one.<br>  2. Put it in an area that only you and that “special someone” can see.<br>  3. Always go for a picture and never, ever, use someone else’s name.<br>  4. Google the tattoo artist and read the reviews. See what the other people in your school have to say.  Remember, you can take a crappy product back to the store but you can’t take back a tattoo. <br>  5. Talk to people of all ages who have tattoos and not just your classmates.<br>  6. Make sure the needle is in a sterile package and has not been used on someone else.<br>  7. After getting the tattoo, wait about 6 months to a year and get tested for Hepatitis C which is a high risk associated with tattoos.  <br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|jK9H6PHiaa	it really depends on your reason for getting the tattoo. if it's symbolic and you'll never regret it, then go for it. if it's something stupid that you aren't 100% sure of don't get it. also most work places now have a policy where you cannot have visible tattoos. and depending on where you live i think theres age restrictions. (in ny where i live it's 18 even if you have parent consent, most places are 16 with parent consent) <br>  <br>  just think of how your body will be changing too. i gained 60 pounds from when i was 14 to when i graduated highschool.|`|lTDeZ0Obaa	Yes, I think you are too young. I am not against tattoos at all. I have two, my husband has four. I waited until I was 23 before I got my first one, I was absolutely sure of what I wanted and don't regret it. My husband got his first one at 15, he regrets the design he got, and the designs he got when he was older are much more fitting of who he grew into. You change so much from the time you are 13 to when you are an adult, no matter how mature you think you are. I was always pretty mature for my age, too, but I still changed dramatically in my tastes and preferences and likes from 13 to 20. A tattoo is permanent. I would suggest waiting!|`|kCdISEGqaa	OK, you've already posted this question, got like 64 answers, and no one said you are old enough to get it.  Did you think you would get better answers if you asked again?  I will tell you again, no, you're not getting a tattoo.  It's illegal, and even in states that you can get parental consent, the minimum, legal age, is 16.  So no, you're not.  Well, unless you go to a dirty artist working out of their garage.  You know, your mother and father could get in trouble with child protective services for child endangerment and neglect, and the artist could get arrested, be fined, and lose their license.  I tell ya what, when you get it, post a picture to prove it, and when we see it, we'll tell you how to get rid of your infection.  Then, when you're 18, come see me in Ohio, and I will do your cover up for free, sine it will look like crap since you're still growing and you're getting it done by a scratcher.|`|AA12188347	Are byou in the USA?

GvokYrTvaa	i haven't tried that...but i have a method that works.  :)<br>  wash your hair with maximizing shampoo and conditioner, and blow dry it. then spray hair curler (i use Tresemme, but any will do), and divide your hair into sections.  Instead of clamping the hair in, wrap your hair around it, holding the curling iron (1-2 inches is best) at the base of your hair, and wrapping downward.  hold for about 15 seconds.  after doing all of your hair, hairspray it.  done!  :)<br>  also, i recommend spraying your hair before drying and curling it with heat protector (i use Tresemme for that too, but there's tons of kinds).<br>  <br>  :D|`|v2yxzKxTaa	Hey !<br>  Great Question :]<br>  To get some really nice curles there are a few ways:<br>  <br>  1. Dry Hair, do a few plaits. then go over the plaits with a hair straigtener<br>  2. Some curling irons work wonders. <br>  3. another really great way. pull your hair into a pony tail, then put the pony around ur finger and brush around ur finger.<br>  4. and last one. you could twist your hair around the end of a hairbrush or something round. get some hairspray and spray around the hair while its on the object.<br>  <br>  hope it helpd =]<br>  <br>  x|`|AA10898030	I bought pillow rollers awhile ago and my friend used mine today since she was going to a party. her hair looked really sexy and you would actually think that she had gotten it done by a professional. the name of the  brand is Goody and I've seen that avon.com also sells them, just type it in the search bar of their website.<br>  good luck|`|11QzdN87aa	instead of rapping it in a towel<br>  put your hair in a high bun, it will give you volume because its up high and give your nice waves and put mousse in it that definitely helps. And warning it might not be dry in the center so if you think your hair will still be slightly wet after leaving it over night put two small buns in your hair one above the other so it will dry faster overnight but have the same result. I can leave my hair in a bun overnight all day and overnight again and when i take it out it will feel like it still has a dampness to it..<br>  <br>  or if you think your hair wont dry overnight either way slightly dry your hair so its only a bit damp and put it up, it'll be much faster

Lol|`|BrWFGZlcaa	personally, i agree with your mom. Wait a little bit to see if its really something you want. you need to keep in mind it might leave a scar. So,if might stick with you for the rest of your life. It's a big decision, that you need to be completely sure about. just wait a year and see if its something you still want. If so, it will be worth the wait!|`|xB2wRYYBaa	mm maybe, im 15 1/2 i ive allways wanted it done even when i was 13, just wait like a year and i would look fine, maybe get it for your 15th birthday or something.<br>  :D<br>  <br>  sorry i know what its like to be told im too young.

hbkiYx05aa	hello!<br>  <br>  It is very possible to achieve this desired look, however. you should go to a salon, and understand that when going lighter you run a much higher risk of damage. When lightening hair you're stripping the hair of its natural melanin (the color molecules in your hair) which could cause hair breakage if not done appropriately. <br>  <br>  If you bring that photo to a salon they could achieve that easy in about an hour I would say, Hope I helped.|`|ku5NPnkfaa	Yes|`|b2ZwhOqsaa	i definately think that blonde would suit you. your skin is light so it will look pretty natural. you might have to start with highlights then wait until the colour u have now fades, if you dont want to strip your hair.|`|gaQzqBb2aa	they would totally bring out your features much better... except if you dye your hair blonde, i suggest you put some eyeliner on to make your eyes pop!!|`|8v40KEd0aa	How about blonde highlights. Your hair color is pretty now.|`|Ng7sF33Oaa	Honestly i think you would look really pretty. :)|`|MNuS31nsaa	i think you would look good!<br>  go to a pro. if you dye your hair yourself its gonna look orange|`|m2WGmGXjaa	You have pale skin and blue eyes, so it would look fine. Plus given that you're naturally blonde is obviously a sign that it'll work :) Nature wanted you to be blonde bby! haha<br>  <br>  If you're doing it yourself, you'd have to bleach it two or three times (Because red pigments are pretty hard to get rid of, so after the first bleach you'll go from brown to an orangey color) then you'd have to put on blonde dye over it.  If you don't want fried hair/falling out hair that's going to take AT LEAST two months and two weeks, because you'll have to wait a month between each time you bleach it, and I recommend waiting at least two weeks after you bleach it to put the dye on. And between every time you bleach/dye use ion hair reconstructer. You can get it at sally's beauty supply and it helps you hair tremendously after you do something damaging to it.<br>  <br>  It will be much easier to go to the salon though, they can do it in one day and they'll fer sure get the right color. Because when you do it yourself, if you're not a professional it can come out any which way. But even after they do it, I recommend the ion hair reconstructer, but it's not as important if you let them do it.|`|3LDjjpWZaa	Depends if that's you in the photo.<br>  And yes, probably.|`|avaglMJQaa	definitely!!! a lighter shade would also look great...go for it!|`|sKCxxdNBaa	you will look perry you known|`|Ndj9ln7Iaa	you look pale now, so having blonde hair would make it worse..|`|yhGz4sO8aa	you'll look cutee!|`|BcIdPSARaa	ya|`|i1JjJQQcaa	yeahh you'd look really pretty

Good stuff!|`|VTgGRzQAaa	True, there is no such thing, at least not yet invented, that will do everything in one. <br>  With over 40 your skin needs moisture and moisture and moisture but of course you also need some defense against the time. <br>  <br>  I have to say I used many creams but the Chanel product lines are I think very good. Unfortunately the beauty costs money and in this case is expensive. This line RECTIFIANCE INTENSE counts to expensive but very beneficial. Sublimage would be maybe to strong and costs over 200 Euros (depends where you are) and it is worth the money but I guess you can still get something less expensive and still very good. So look on the page of Clarins as well. Their products are also very nice and less expensive. <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|M3GDjEHtaa	Try: MicroDermabrasion. i'm in my early 20's, my sister is in her early 30's, & my mother is in her early 60's & we all use this, i highly recommend it. It's from Lancome....it's a cream that exfoliates your face but you have to rub it gently because it has like these tiny little crystals & if you do it too hard it'll hurt. Then after you wash that off you put on this Vitamin C moisturizer. You will feel the difference the first time you use it...your skin will be so smooth & it'll just look great in general...(it's also for wrinkles). i hope this helps you.|`|GFYkV8a0aa	There's a new wrinkle reducing cream out that's supposed to do wonders.

5vjUWV4Iaa	it will be smother for a while but you will have to keep doing that the rest of your life if you do that <br>  its just better to have it i mean everyone has it its completely normal<br>  and you can hardly see it|`|S4soZUFCaa	If it's your mustache, it will come in thicker, but not cheek hair. Laser removal is better.|`|KUQp6NKcaa	no it wont come back darker.. and just use the smooth away pads because it'll exfoliate your skin too.|`|6098ebd9c2c175997bc815b09ad17e01aa	use one of those rubber things they sell as seen on tv where you rub it back and forth and the hair breaks off|`|v6mQzSSbaa	I wanna do that too but I'm scared it will do that too.
lU8e0VQFaa	You don't need to have them pierced at a 14g that's only if you want to start larger. It's pretty simple but takes time and patience. First off, if your ears aren't pierced, get them pierced (NOT at the mall or with a gun, go to a proper shop and have them done with a needle). First you'll need to let them heal completely, so a minimum of 3 months but 4 would be better. It's easier if you pick up a good set of tapers, it makes it easier to get the larger jewelry in. When you get your ears done ask what size they're using, most likely 18g unless you ask for bigger. Sizes go up by 2, so it's 20g 18g 16g 14g 12g 10g 8g 6g 4g 2g 0g 00g. <br>  <br>  You go up ONE size at a time, use some emu oil or jojoba oil to lube up the taper, GENTLY slide it in (if it won't go, stop and give your ears more time to heal) bleeding or extreme pain are NOT normal, once the taper is in, put in the larger sized jewelry and treat as a fresh piercing. WAIT 4-6 WEEKS before going up to the next size. Generally the point of no return is a 2g but it may vary slightly for you.<br>  <br>  Also, gauge is a form of measurement, stretching is the act of enlarging a piercing, might as well get your terminology right.|`|2dya7YeKaa	Check out the forum on Body Art Forms.  The people there are very knowledgable about stretching and can answer all of your questions.  There is a "guide to stretching" thread here:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://forums.bodyartforms.com/forums/t/5641.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://forums.bodyartforms.com/forums/t/...</a><br>  <br>  The website is a great resource for a wide variety of reasonably priced jewelry.  My ears are 2G and it is where I buy all of mine.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|PMpvtKUwaa	if you are pierced at an 18, you need to go next to a 16. you can buy tapers to stretch with. never skip a size. and i'm not sure, but i think they say once you hit a size 0 you may never shrink back to normal.|`|9PI4U0Feaa	start out with an 18g then every couple months put a bigger gauge in. but it will be a small mnumber 20g is bigger than 18g 14g is bigger than 18g ect ect<br>  <br>  and they stink btw

But boys don't. Boys usually only like girls with long hair. Most guys find girls with short hair a turn off.<br>  I don't think you should cut it because it is more work than it sounds like you are use to. You have to fix it everyday, for example. You can't just pull it back and go like you can with long hair.<br>  And although I love mine, I'm growing it back out. You get tired of it very quickly because there is only so much with it that you can do.<br>  You don't have the range of hairstyles and cute little touches that you have when you have long hair.<br>  I say don't cut it.<br>  From a girl with short hair to another girl, I think you'll regret it. Plus, it takes FOREVER to grow back out if you decide you don't like it.|`|u0eTvggDaa	if your not 100% sure if you want your hair like that, then don't get it.<br>  <br>  in the end, it's still your decision.<br>  <br>  my opinion, i wouldn't do it.<br>  <br>  let the guys have the short hair, you keep yours long and pretty!<br>  <br>  <br>  but then again like i said. in the end it's still your decision!<br>  <br>  hope i could help!<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|aBwQ06A6aa	Umm, i wouldnt because alot of guys like long hair, and urs is great wavy, its more sexy. u could get hilights, or something.|`|aRYwnafWaa	If you wanna cut your hair shorter, then go for it. But maybe insted of taking a lots of your hair off, get it cut shorter gradually, like get a few inches off each time, and see if you like it shorter. I had long hiar once, but now its just above my shoulders, an inch or 2 longer then the style you want, and i really like it. And about guys likeing it or not, the guy u like should like YOU, not your hair, and if they dont like it, then they arent worth it tbh.<br>  Btw, if u do go straight ahead and cut it pixie style and decide you dont like it, perhaps consider Hair-Extentions.|`|t4mG3Ef4aa	Well, i adore pixie hair cuts and as long as you use jell and you spike it up in the back it will look very cutsie. I have many friends with the hair cut and i think its adorable. I personally love it. <br>  <br>  <br>  you only look like a guy if you get it to short.<br>  <br>  p.s. get side bangs with it, it makes it less boyish. xD|`|xDEYAUwGaa	No I don't think you should do it.  I think since your hair is already slightly wavy, if you cut it that short then it would get a lot curlier and wouldn't look so good.  Maybe its just that Im not a fan of that hairstyle, though.|`|Jx9iKMHvaa	dont do it girl ...let me just say you'll regret it and youll miss ur long hair...plus it kinda looks like a boy cut....well its up to you...i would ask random guys tho and see what they say...|`|ULGIvuFIaa	Well Me personally Wouldn't Get It Cause I Think That Long HAIR Is Better But Its Up To You x<br>  Hope I Helped =]<br>  Beckiie -x-

Since others have both oily and dry, basically combination, it's fine. Also, if you're using eyeshadow, it doesn't differentiate between types does it? No, it doesn't. Just the same for foundation. They might have foundations particularly for oily skin, but it's to make sure it sticks better.<br>  If you wanna be sure and to use a good foundation, try Revlon Colorstay.<br>  Good luck!|`|lgMZJQtwaa	heey def where not liquid foundatuion if your skin is oily becuase this makes it even more! i would go with mineral powder this works really good for some of my friends! and try oil sheets you cna get them at any drugstore they are blue and you blot them adn it gets rid of oil i do this in school like once a day helps alot! they are called -shine control blotting sheets

2dya7YeKaa	Sea salt soaks (sss) are the gold standard in piercing aftercare, almost everyone recommends them.<br>  <br>  Usually the "recipe" is 1/8 tsp non-iodized sea salt to 8 oz warm water (it doesn't have to be hot but it should be very very warm).  Some people say 1/4 tsp.  Mix a batch of each and taste them.  The mixture shouldn't be any saltier than your own tears since you are trying to approximate the saline that occurs naturally in your body.<br>  <br>  Once you've mixed the sss, dunk a cotton ball in the solution and hold it to your piercing for about 10 minutes.  3 times a day should be sufficient (once in in the morning, once midday and once before bed).  If you decide to supplement that with soap (though it isn't necessary) just make sure you choose a soap that is fragrance free (fragrance will irritate your piercing).  <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|BPrMusoLaa	Are you talking about that little tiny part on your ear...If so please contact me I want that soooooooooooo bad but nobody I know has it they are too chicken to do stuff like that. Im scared but I want it so bad what was the pain level honestly. Or I want the inside of my ears pierced, you know the like literally inside my ear lobe. I think I saw a female singer with it also . but please contact me and let me know how it was. I wanna go this weekend when I get my tattoo.|`|5DnRYxgHaa	The cheapest way to do it is to use the sea salt method a couple of times a day depending on how much crusties your ear produces. I'd say no more than three times a day though, because it IS true that you can clean too much.<br>  <br>  Make sure you clean it after you shampoo your hair though, so you can get all the shampoo cleaned off. This will get out all the soap and dirt that went into your piercing while shampooing.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|HclZKkMVaa	You can either use seat salt + warm water, or buy yourself an antiseptic spray especially for things like piercings. I used Savlon on mine and it was great. Don't just grab the nearest bottle of TCP, you need to be using special sprays. At first, clean in at night and morning, but after about 2 weeks you won't need to clean it as much. I found with mine that too much cleaning left it irritated and red. When you keep on washing it, it doesn't get a chance to dry out so it takes longer to heal.<br>  Hope this helps!<br>  x

G0ino2hjaa	Yellow would only make you look paler. Pink also is not a good color for pale people. You should go with a dark brown NO BLACKS and maybe some dark crimson reds!|`|9rz9XJdQaa	cool colours, like blues and greens, a darker brown would look really good. i wouldn't go with any warm colours like red yellow or orange, those would really play up on the whole pale look. so if you're trying to avoid that, go with the cool ones. =]|`|eD3sbeVbaa	Vibrant colors basically-like blue, green, red, pink (though I'm not a fan of bright neon pink), etc.|`|aXtwn7Usaa	if you want to look sexy and get attraction, then baige, if you want to look fashionable purple is the color, elegance black.|`|sdfGtlj4aa	brown pink looks washed out and bad i am very pale and honey blonde and have a pink swim suit i look horrible blue would look cute to bot nothing over exaggerating|`|l5BrK3WCaa	hot pink, or baby blue :D|`|WvIDTs4Paa	pink|`|4cd2c7649e1949de04b5f7bdd1c51814aa	I'd choose pretty pastel colors for now. (lilac, mint green, baby blue, hot pink, etc.)  When you're well tanned, yellow would look nice, but not a solid yellow. Maybe a yellow, with other pastel colors in it as well. Don't forget your sunscreen.|`|nbWO3IANaa	No, not yellow.<br>  Try: medium pink [ dusty rose ]<br>  lavender<br>  sky or smoke blue<br>  These shades look good on pale people, and will still look good when you tan.|`|89eff262f6bea247dc65af0dfdb2e666aa	Brown with yellow polka dots.

24sK6L2uaa	It will probably leave an itty bitty scar. I took mine out before and go it repierced and I can barely notice it.Depending on how close to the hole the new piercing will be you might not notice it.|`|AA11850523	It should close up but it will always show a indentation or scar where the other piercing was|`|PwD3slrTaa	<a href="http://www.lmgtfy.com/?q=mouth+piercing+heal" rel="nofollow">http://www.lmgtfy.com/?q=mouth+piercing+...</a>

You are a pretty girl and getting your lips done doesn't change the shape of them...it only makes your lip pop out and it looks all weird and fake. I hate fake lips. I know that fuller lips are very attractive but unless God gave you them in the first place then wear some lip gloss and flash your cute thin ones.|`|2hl89HUeaa	Nope you look just fine to me. wink, wink.;)|`|jmlAmr3gaa	Nice as-is.  If you want to look sexy, don't mess with 4 billion years of sexually based evolution.|`|QK7ssy2Xaa	No the lips you have a fine.

L6tW53cZaa	there is this thing called marrakesh oil but u have to use a hair dryer but it straightens some not as well as a straightener and there is this thing called special effects straghit and shiny extra strenght anti frizz hair serum but a blow dryer works and when ur hair is wet part down middle or close and comb throug hallot and lightly pull straight removing water and that straightens some but y not a stragitener if ur affraid it will harm ur hair there is this protection spray wou spray on ur hair and it doesnt do as much damage|`|fZZvTkVTaa	hair dryer + brush...the big circular brushes...i don't know what they're called. <br>  <br>  <br>  answer please :<br>  <a href="http://uk.answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090227101605AAHNpXB">http://uk.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...</a><br>  <br>  thanks|`|Vr7NR2LGaa	you can get a perm but thats really unhealthy for your hair. so those 2  are the only way.|`|rZUThLfMaa	if you have a big curling iron you can use it just like a flat iron, thats what i do|`|IowG78BGaa	an iron. or get it permed.|`|BcIdPSARaa	no not really|`|tRNtFNHLaa	no..|`|ITMUqdzOaa	permanent straightening.|`|OBuzcIDbaa	Not really. You could get it chemically straightened, but you would still probably have to work with it a bit. I wouldn't recommend chemically straightening it. It's awfully hard on your hair. You may just have to bite the bullet and do the work like the rest of us. Sorry! (-:|`|jd4MzIYtaa	mmm you will have to use one or the other<br>  you can get it professionally straightened but even then depending on the results you have to blow dry it straight.|`|eqhqnaogaa	Brushing obviously straightens it out a little, maybe use a fine tooth comb. <br>  <br>  Plaiting it a night leaves it straight or at least wavy in the morning.|`|vAtiLhloaa	Get run over by a steam roller.|`|mXHYjFM5aa	My mom used to use a steam iron when she was young

That will greatly improve your professional appearance.|`|ceebbd5b347bf3b3c44701e742d76f97aa	Creative jobs are made for you:<br>  Cutting edge salon, or graphic design.

They love gothic girls working there.|`|RikCftYKaa	well you don't have to abandon your style. don't look at it that way. cause that is not what your doing! you have to make sure that you look presentable. that's the whole thing about a service job. ok. like a store. if you work at a store then you have to dress the way the store tells you to, but if you work at a "Hot Topic" then that's different because everything that they sell there is probably something you would wear (i hope i am not insulting you cause that is NOT what i am trying to do, sorry if i am). <br>  <br>  i hope i helped (and did not anger you)|`|cec99146a72c0490860d8ff53310073eaa	Well, you can't have it both ways.  If you want to be goth, then suffer the consequences of having a very difficult time finding a "good" job that pays well.  Which is more important, having a "style" so you can get all kinds of negative attention, or finding a good job.  Maybe it's time to grow up?|`|HIwJFtNlaa	You can work at a gothic store, like Hot topic, Spencers or other apparel stores. You can also just tone down your apparel or work at home and play the stock market.<br>  I hope I helped!<br>  <br>  oh and my sister's boyfriend makes a fortune from working at home, and he's a college student, I hope i helped your motivation.|`|rd5468H1aa	I have no idea... you really outdid yourself this time.|`|SHoGWZWPaa	you made your choice to get tatoos all over your body. now unfortunately you have to deal with the people who think that's freaky and don't want to hire you. you can't make anyone hire you. if you have your college degree that always help, but no degree and a bunch of tatoos does not make for a good job applicant.|`|D9AUzmZRaa	didn't you think about that before you got your tattoos?|`|GDdTEEDZaa	long sleeve shirt , Turtle neck , take out ear rings|`|aLGe7JZEaa	Everyone has tattoos now a days.

You could try like Hot Topic, or Spencers.|`|b5f9eada2ae1ecabcb567944edea3c27aa	Hot Topic, Spencers|`|t8JlnuqFaa	walmart?|`|aeZZu1HOaa	Obviously you've attracted a fair amount of idiots to the thread.  <br>  <br>  In all seriousness, if you're interviewing for an entry level job (with or without tattoos) the best thing you can do is wear a suit (not a polyester "suit" from the Juniors department), a nice pair of shoes and carry a briefcase.  Seriously; most managers are looking for someone dependable and professional, and many will not care about your tattoos.  Wear some opaque tights and a collared shirt.  <br>  <br>  AFTER you're hired, if you want to express your goth style, you can still do so, just not in a very over-the-top way.  collarfactory.com makes beautiful leather collars that can pass as a choker, I recommend them.  You can wear goth earrings or accessories without too much trouble, although I'd draw the line at ripped clothing or t-shirts.  For example, you could wear a bun, your glasses, a white shirt and a black vest and pencil skirt, some wicked heels and a sexy collar.  You'd look like a hot gothic librarian, and I think still totally work acceptable.|`|XpHpeRGAaa	It depends on where you live. If you live in Nowheresville Nebraska, try long sleeves. If you have tattoos on your neck wear turtle necks and sweat it out in the summer. Cover it up. You have no other option. <br>  <br>  If you live in a city, Then get a job at a goth, punk clothing store, music store, local bookshop. warehouse, telemarketer, tattoo shop.<br>  <br>  You could move to a super liberal city that has a lot of youngsters with lots of dumb tattoos. <br>  <br>  Stop while you are ahead. They look cool now. but think of how much respect you will get at a PTA meeting someday. <br>  <br>  Tattoos are art. but unless you live in a tolerant community you are asking to be an outsider. Move or stop getting tattoos.|`|jLSH3kobaa	Work at Lush (cosmetics and bath stuff shop) all the people are scary there :)|`|fOQ2TDIeaa	Today employers are accepting this type of style. I went to Wal-mart the other the day. The cashier had some lime green hair, visible tattoos, and piercings. You know today there is no rules that apply to anyone. Everyone has rights. Rights to wear what you want, say what you want, think what you want. So, if you have the skills, knowledge, and great work ethics you should have no problem getting a good job that you are qualified for.|`|FiF7XXWqaa	There's always Hot Topic and tattoo parlors!  A good friend of mine has many large and visible tattoos and works at H&M.  A lot of youth-oriented retail places will probably hire someone with visible ink.  Your best bet is to search for job openings on Craigslist and call before you go in to the interview to ask how they feel about tattoos.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|GWJHRbxsaa	hot topic|`|zEnTzVnqaa	If possible try cover the tattoos with makeup or powder or something. Maybe wear lots of long sleeve/high neck tops.<br>  <br>  *sigh* My gothic style isn't even that obvious (hehe I'm still in high school and have no black hair or makeup) and it's difficult for me to get a cheap paying job at Maccas.

ZNSgjcxpaa	Cocoa butter is excellent for moisturizing dry skin. Go through your normal cleansing routine; after washing the cleanser off your face (thoroughly, especially by the hairline and cheeks; cleanser residue can clog pores and increase zits in half heartedly washed areas). Massage cocoa butter lotion on your entire face (massaging it in specific spots only makes your skin splotchy and oily), then after one minute of drying, dab off any excess lotion and massage antibiotic ointment onto popped or bleeding zits to eliminate bacteria and clean the blemish.|`|PgQui4jNaa	If you absolutely must and have no other alternative then sure. Otherwise, use a facial moisturizer especially since you're obviously acne prone.|`|zQXbO1D7aa	Nonono<br>  its a really good moisturizer for "body"skin<br>  but it will clog the pores on your face quite badly and cause white heads.<br>  The best to "undry" is just a good store baught facial moisturizer, a lot of it.<br>  If your skin is flaking, combing equal parts of honey and sugar and use it as a scrub.<br>  Be gentle though.<br>  This slaushes off all the dead and flakey skin and leaves you really silky smooth <br>  The sugar is an exfoliant and the honey is anibacterial, its fantastic.<br>  I use it a lot. <br>  A one time use will fix it for the next few hours, but to really fix it, use it once in the morning and once at night with plenty of moisturizer afterwards.<br>  After 5 days youll be all better :D<br>  Good luck,<br>  Dani <3|`|oESAvCmFaa	you can but coco butter works better as a tanning lotion so hope that helps|`|O7Hzsq8baa	It may cause your skin to break out.

BUT the clothes in their typical malls are basically overpriced, cheap, not-that-cute stuff.  Only the super-expensive stuff in Japan (upwards of $70) is truly cute.  So, looking through magazines or books that show off these clothes is definately and awesome style inspiration, but shopping at malls there isn't as cool as I actually thought it would be.|`|MRUuRTHeaa	I really like the less extreme Harajuku fashion, tho I would never actually wear clothes like that every day..maybe as a costume tho..I'd like to know how they can afford all those clothes, personally.

You can buy dye from Michael's, JoAnne's, and probably offline.  Always buy like 2x as much dye as you think you need, just in case! You may want to invest in a large sponge brush:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.ttfxmedia.com/vallejo/imagenes/pinceles/hs04.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.ttfxmedia.com/vallejo/imagene...</a><br>  <br>  so that you can paint the dye on your jeans and get even color distribution.  You will want to be working on a plastic-covered flat surface with gloves.  Here's an article with instructions (even though it's on lace, it doesn't matter): <br>  <br>  <a href="http://littleblackkitty.typepad.com/a_little_imagination_and_/2008/04/tutorial-diy-ha.html" rel="nofollow">http://littleblackkitty.typepad.com/a_li...</a><br>  <br>  Here's some testimonials on dyeing jeans: <a href="http://www.getcrafty.com/viewtopic.php?p=56654" rel="nofollow">http://www.getcrafty.com/viewtopic.php?p...</a>  It looks like there are different ways to do it, so read up.<br>  <br>  Finally the skinny-fying part!  You flip them inside out, making sure the front side is up.  Then, you take skinny jeans you already own and lay them on top (you DON'T have to flip these inside-out).  Use a pen to trace the outline of your skinny jeans onto the OUTSIDE EDGE of the flares.  Use pins to pin perpendicular to the line every couple of inches.  Then, get out your sewing machine and sew along the line, making sure you backstitch at the beginning and end.  Here's a whole tutorial!<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.craftster.org/forum/index.php?topic=87388.0" rel="nofollow">http://www.craftster.org/forum/index.php...</a><br>  <br>  Well, I hope this somewhat helps you!  Remember: test first on a pair of jeans you don't care much about.|`|R75tldc8aa	It's definitely possible, but difficult.

It can kind of tell what kind of person you are.  If it is vibrant than you are outgoing and really don't care what people think.  If it is done calmly and tamely you are wanting the crazy side to come out but did it tastefully.  <br>  <br>  I see nothing wrong with a little bit of color just not too much...<br>  <br>  Too much color, you are over the top.|`|EajrrzWjaa	not sure who they are but can be very confused.. depending on the person who they are "trying" to impress<br>  yes it maybe very immature if its like a teen trying to impress a parent of the person he/she likes=)

9PI4U0Feaa	are you sure you were peirced with an 18g? <br>  i had that problem, i just slowly pushed it through all the way<br>  and it was sore for a couple days but not too bad|`|BPrMusoLaa	If the 18 is too fat you need to go smaller not bigger! A 20 will only stretch the hole in your nose even wider. You do not want a permanent open hole in your nose that is ugly especially days you dont have it in or if you one day decide that you dont want it anymore. If anything you might wanna try a 16. Go to claires they have all of them and they are nice and small. I hate to see people with those big piercings on their faces. It looks tacky. Oh and FYI...I have my Nose and my Librae pierced and you would never tell unless some sun or light hit on my diamonds. Oh and you can go to a jewelry store or a high end pawn shop like I did and get one specially made to fit your style, width and length. My nose ring is coming in about 6 weeks but I had my custom librae for over 6 years and I havent had to replace the little diamond in it yet so you might wanna use that option if your willing to kick out some bucks. My librae was $225 but my special nose stud is only $185 and its worth it because its real gold and diamonds and if it does not fit right like you like it most places will fix it for you at no charge at all.

Are you a member of a certain tribe that tattoos for identification?  If not, why get one?  Because it looks cool?

XaKVwjtpaa	when you get your nose pierced like a little while after you will get this weird bump right next to your nose ring, it happens to about 95% of people that get their nose pierced. its weird and noticeable, but it goes away. though it can/does come back, you just have to clean your nose really well. it stops happening after the first few months. <br>  <br>  but its worth it, i love mine :-D<br>  <br>  ohh and dont use the nose rings with the little tiny ball at the end, they will rip open your piercing, use the screw nose rings.|`|5b5gOsIJaa	well basically i looked up on youtube and saw a few people getting it done, some got ....(how do i expain it) well you know the end of a wine bottle i think its called the cork ? but they put that up your nose and then they get this long peice of metal, obviously not too long and then they peirce it through your nose, nice and clean, all disenfected of course, and then they bend the wire (which i heard was the most painfullest bit) and they break off the end bit of the wire. and there you have your very own nose peirce. <br>  i havent got mine done but i wont it done soon.<br>  <br>  tip :- dont wear any mascara because your eyes water like mad, trust me,|`|BPrMusoLaa	Its okay. Im not gonna lie it hurts. When I got mine my eyes instantly started wattering. It hurts for the first maybe 3-4 days and its all over. This coming from someone who has 6 tattoos and counting and also my librae. You can do it just make sure you go to a good clean shop thats gonna take their time and place it in the right spot for you. Once you get it done youll be happy.

jd4MzIYtaa	sounds crazy but use laundry detergent-tide preferably and wash it a couple times it will take the color out a little<br>  <br>  then bleach it <br>  whatever you do dont strip it that is the worst damage you can do<br>  <br>  otherwise a less harsh approach is dye it light brown, this will lighten it a little.However it is hard to lift black without bleaching<br>  <br>  good luck|`|ITMUqdzOaa	get hair color stripper. it'll take the black out in a couple uses. i had to do it twice to get all my black dye out. but after that, i was able to go back to my natural blonde color. go to a drug store like wal-mart or rite aid to get it. follow the directions carefully and make sure you have a good conditioner!|`|6a0f5242e106e58c4ca1b110e61eb592aa	Honey, slow down! If you want to get rid of the black hair, you need to BLEACH it out. You can put 10 different blondes on your hair and it will NOT get rid of the black. Black dye is the worst color to try to get out of your hair! I never understand why people dye their hair that color, unless they are black-haired to begin with and getting grey. <br>  If you can, go to a professional, because they know exactly what they are doing. If you can't, go to a beauty supply store and try to get someone who has knowledge about hair color, They will tell you the strength peroxide you will need and the other products that are needed, too, to get the best results. Also get a good conditioner, like JOICO or OJAN for a deep conditioning. ...you will most definitely need it. Also a good conditioner for after shampooing will be needed, too. Good luck!|`|OBuzcIDbaa	Miss Broken, you sound like you've gotten yourself in a mess!<br>  My daughter just did some experimenting on her hair as well.<br>  My sister who is a hair stylist used Pravana to strip her hair with little damage. It was amazing how it took out the discoloration and evened it out. Most strippers are so damaging! I'd ask your hairdresser to purchase some if they don't already have it. I really think this is your best option. Otherwise you'll end up with very damaged hair for a long time. End with good conditioning and try not to use a lot of heat for a while. Good luck!|`|IHw2qUtcaa	Bleach it or wait for it to fade.|`|U6C4Bywwaa	2 options:<br>  grow it out and cut it off slowly like you said<br>  or<br>  you can strip the color out then dye it the color you want, but be careful-this could be damaging|`|8v40KEd0aa	You need to go to the Salon. Don't mess with it yourself. It's hard to get rid of the black.

You will be alot happier once its done.|`|yjFLHfkAaa	i was dying my hair black for about 2 years and the only way i could get it out was to have it professionally stripped. i had tried just to do it myself a few times, but it did nothing, its not that expensive and it wont come out green or not work at all. hope this was helpful.|`|2Urd6VLqaa	Black is the hardest color to get out of your hair.<br>  Maybe try Color Oops.<br>  I've seen pretty good results on the internet.<br>  It just strips the dye out of your hair, leaving you with your orignal color.<br>  <br>  ?|`|BcIdPSARaa	idk

zYcxMLcaaa	I found the following two paragraphs on BBC-Science & Nature-Human Body. I found the page through www.ask.com. <br>  <br>  Pubic hair is quite different from hair on the head. Instead of forming a round shape, the hair is oval. It is always short and has a coarse and curly texture. The growth period for pubic hair is short. Within six months, the hair follicle dies and the hair falls out. Pubic hair never gets a chance to grow longer.<br>  <br>  It is not certain why pubic hair grows in the groin and under the armpit. One theory suggests that it provides a large surface area for the natural smell of sweat to disperse from. Many animals use the odour of sweat to attract the opposite sex.<br>  <br>  Pretty much, it is to help you produce the pheremones that attract the opposite sex.  However there are other ways that the body does that too, so it seems to me that pubic hair really isn't a neccessity.  So if you choose to shave it all off or just keep it trim, then you will be fine and it won't hurt your body to do so.  I also read that in Ancient Egypt it was comon practice to shave all the extra hair on the body.  So it would seem to me that if they have been doing it for so many years without reprocutions then it would continue to be safe now.  Basically, do as you please with the hair down below, it is up to you how comfortable you are with what you do with it.<br>  <br>  Also, it isn't a gross question.  I would wager to bet other people have been just as curious about the hair below.|`|GOSMZMpwaa	Are you talking about pubic hair? Because pubic hair is meant to protect your woo woo from bacteria.

WEqRKZzyaa	definitely wait AT LEAST three months. better safe than sorry. i got mine done about two months ago and i can tell that it's not ready to be changed yet. you should definitely wait until it is healed, which if you are taking good care of it should be about 3-5 months after you got it and if you have not taken good care of it or wear a lot of tight clothes or play a lot of sport or stuff where you are moving around a lot in that region 5-8 months|`|HbvwG4INaa	Oooooooooh!!

C0HZ8ZB4aa	God it drives me crazy when people consistantly give that answer to this sort of question. Personally - I'm of the opinion that you should wait until something 'finds you', or means enough to you to 'need' it. But there is no rulebook, and you've asked for ideas, if people have no intention of answering your question and no ability to write something without involving their personal opinions then they should move on to a question which actually asks for opinions.<br>  <br>  Anyway as for an answer - it's difficult to give ideas without knowing what sort of imagery you like. I mean - do you like animals? If so, a tiger or a fancy looking bird (peacock, bird of paradise etc) would look beautiful. Or mythological creatures, such as mermaids, unicorns, phoenixes, fairies, angels, etc. can look great. What are your passions in life? Take things you're passionate about, whether it's people, places, activities, etc. - and see if you can find a way of representing that through imagery. Perhaps consider a scene tattoo - is there somewhere in the world you love? Perhaps something as simple as a beach - sand sea and sky, if done well, can make a beautiful tattoo. Something I personally love are tree tattoos. A thigh would be a good area for something like that. Cherry blossom trees are very common and beautiful but you could have anything. A simple floral design can also look great, or vines spiralling down. If you're religious you could use some sort of religious imagery. Or if there's a particular quote or lyric that you love - you could have it written in large cursive letters either horizontally or vertically on your thigh. There are all sorts of ideas you could go for. Have a look at websites like ratemyink.com, bmeink.com, the tattoo section of deviantart.com etc for inspiration. Never copy someone's tattoo though - but if you see something you like you can take it to a tattoo artist and have it reworked into your own style. As you're only just thinking about this and have no specific meaning behind it, I would recommend once coming up with the design to give it quite some period of time to think about it. Remember that you won't always be young and wearing shorts in summer. So get it for all the right reasons. Imagine every scenario in life from the present day until the day you die and make sure you want the tattoo in all of those scenarios. Then think about it some more, and then just a little bit more. It's boring to wait but it's very important, particularly with your first. Good luck.<br>  <br>  <br>  (by the way, when I say a scene tattoo, I mean a tattoo of a scene, not a scenester tattoo, haha...)|`|YtAkmjoyaa	I don't know why <br>  this might sound cheesy, but I'm feeling a cheetah or tiger, anything in the cat family.|`|80I1aHSGaa	Everything was almost said by Ink Mama. But what I can say is it will really be hard to give specific ideas for a tattoo design because tattoos are pretty personal stuff, you have to know the person up-close before you can make good and useful ideas for a tattoo design. However, I'd like to give it a shot. If you have thick runner thighs, chances are you're involved in running as sports. Did you ever compete and won or do you have memories of this sports that you want others to see? Maybe a good representation of these memories such as dates or award logos should make good tattoo designs.|`|xqtKODvbaa	"Cellulite City"<br>  <br>  "Thunder Thighs"<br>  <br>  "MOOOOO"<br>  <br>  "No, this is one leg, not 2"|`|zmfNXuwYaa	If you need to ask what you should get, you're not ready for a tattoo.

qQAl6S6Baa	Start wearing eyeliner on your waterline and upper lashline and maybe a light eyeshadow, just sweep it across your lid. Wear mascara, bronzer (remember to create a '3' shape on the side of your face so temples then go in under the cheek bone and then the jaw) if you practice in the mirror it creates a three! and let your hair down! straighten it or curl it! Also stand tall and make him notice you, confidence is the key!

Smudge it alittle with the smudging brush thinger.

e01bQd95aa	Brush with toothpaste and some bicarbonate of soda (baking soda) mixed together.|`|8IyZphFVaa	mix salt, baking soda, and water and brush your teeth with them but don't keep doing it because it's erosive. and just to warn you if you have sensitive teeth it'll probably hurt. it does the same thing that whitening strips does, just faster. some ppl also rinse with hydrogen peroxide before brushing but i think that this along with baking soda will damage your teeth over time. i've heard that rubbing the inside of banana peels in a circular motion on your teeth whitens it. you're supposed to do it for 2 minutes twice a day and then brush. i don't know if it works but you could at least try it. eating more fruits and vegetables, especially strawberries, cutting back on sodas/coffee/tea, drinking more water, and rinsing your mouth more often should help.|`|EV2LMaiLaa	you cant unless you bleach them<br>  <br>  crest strips|`|Or1AKzaoaa	lmao ur teeth arent going to be white over night unless u go and get them cosmetically whitened.|`|l5BrK3WCaa	brush.|`|5NU7Uh7taa	no quick fix im afraid....try products

jez0O0bXaa	I know of two women who shaved their eyebrows off and they never grew back but that is really rare.  Each hair strand has a varied growth cycle so it can take time.|`|DTg3USppaa	ouch thats rough! Waxing!?!?! Holy... but yeah they should eventually grow back, you should have at least a few stubbles by now. Sure they didnt use something else that could have possibly taken your roots for your hair growth??? I sure hope not!! It would be a very uncomfortable feeling for me as well, give it about 2 more weeks, if you have no results, I would go see your doctor.|`|AA11948754	100% Virgin Olive Oil!

First they grow in cycles and they grow alot slower taking months to grow back. Yes they will grow back but it could be 6 months to a year before they are fully or near fully back. Reason being they grow and shed. You have no idea where in the shedding process you were. If you were in a part of the shedding process that they are falling out or were going to. (not enough to notice,) then it will appear that they aren't all growing in. They will just give it time. And no, sorry there is nothing you do to speed it up.
nxFuiuaXaa	prenatal vitamins|`|9rz9XJdQaa	i use this stuff called nutra nail, you can get it at most drugstores (i get it at walgreens) and you just put it on to the natural nail like nail polish and it improves the growth. The brand also has other ones like strenghthing and repair for your nails. <br>  <br>  Definetly be patient, nails don't grow very fast normally so don't expect them to shoot out in like two days.|`|9d02fc7e13c75fc534b15ecc19820c8faa	take Biotin trust me|`|eXThzkqVaa	leave them in water or take 91 showers
xEZclTh4aa	the pain is up to you <br>  no one can really tell you if it hurts for real<br>  i'd say its more extreme discomfort and a pinch for like a second <br>  then its all good <br>  <br>  when they pierce it they will either put in a 16g or a 14g <br>  it doesn't really matter how big it is its really just up to you<br>  all mine have been with 14g and its not bad <br>  the gauge doesn't change between rings and studs <br>  when you get it done ask for a labret stud <br>  but it might be more expensive with a stud <br>  it really depends one where you have it done|`|fmeuE91Paa	Everyone experiences pain differently. Some are more sensitiveve to it and others can tolerate it much better. For me, it really didn't hurt at all. I actually pierced it myself without intending to do so lol. I was just bored and wanted to just see if it would hurt if I pushed the needle just a little bit into my lip. Well I ended up pushing too hard and it went all the way through lol. It didn't hurt, it just stung a bit for a little while but ice does wonders.  The part that really hurt for me was putting in and taking out the lip rings because I had to constantly put it in and take it out to hide it from my parents. But if your getting it profesionally done then you won't have this problem. Good luck and have fun :]

If you have really big breasts then you might have a bit of an issue.  If your lower then a C cup you should be good.

And no matter what curling iron you use they will damage your hair in some way or another unless you use heat protector spray which you can get very cheap at like.. wal-mart

zA98589Baa	Try Revlon Beyond Natural liquid foundation. It's white but when you put it on your skin it will change color according to your skin tone. But then again, it comes in light, light/medium, medium and deep, so maybe you'll have to buy all shades in order to match every skin tone.<br>  <br>  I strongly recommend the Bobbi Brown University Palette. Its retail price is $250 but you can get it at your CCO for $170. It might be pricey but it's totally worth it. The palette is designed specially for makeup artists. It includes 9 shades of Corrector for extra dark circles, 12 shades of Creamy Concealer for average under eye darkness, and 17 shades of Foundation Stick to give skin a smooth, even finish.<br>  <br>  Click here to see all the shades featured in the palette:<br>  <a href="http://www.bobbibrowncosmetics.com/images/popups/popup_BBUpalette.gif" rel="nofollow">http://www.bobbibrowncosmetics.com/image...</a><br>   <br>  For more details you can visit:<br>  <a href="http://www.bobbibrowncosmetics.com/templates/products/sp_nonshaded.tmpl?ngextredir=1&CATEGORY_ID=CATEGORY2781&PRODUCT_ID=PROD11208" rel="nofollow">http://www.bobbibrowncosmetics.com/templ...</a><br>  <br>  It's a limited edition product, so you better hurry if you want one.|`|WYWx9j8Maa	yes!  there is already one out for sale. it comes out white, like lotion and turns to the shade of your skin!|`|1vaqtRI2aa	Yes, the person above is right.

The second is good too but you will get criticism for it.|`|dfb84bcc0ace495064c7a83779aca384aa	i don't usually say this but i think you should totally try. you have a really good shot especially with the first photo.<br>  all the other girls on here all think that they can be a model just because they think they're "pretty"- but their pictures are just of them trying to look like a barbie doll. <br>  but i can tell that you definately have model potential! i loooove that first picture!|`|9d02fc7e13c75fc534b15ecc19820c8faa	A.

rgNP0Qo6aa	Oh yeah, all of it baby!<br>  Here's my normal laser answer in case it helps you any =)<br>  <br>  Okay... science answer:<br>  <br>  You grow in at least 80% of your hair during puberty. When you have laser hair removal the hairs it kills will never grow again. But you still have up to 20% of your normal thickness that will grow in throughout the rest of your life. So people get touch up sessions every 3-5 years after their big 6 treatments. You need about 6 treatments, one each 2 months for a year, because the hair grows in different stages and it can only kill hair in the active growth stage. The laser works by targeting dark color (the hair follicle) and passing through light color (the skin) the hair and skin have to be very different shades of color for the hair to work. The darker and coarser the hair and lighter the skin, the better results you will have.<br>  <br>  Okay... Personal Experience:<br>  <br>  I've had 2 out of my 6 treatments so far. It HURTS! It's like being poked with a sewing needle over and over, but it's not as painful as a tattoo, and that's not as painful as childbirth, maybe that can put the pain in perspective for you =) I've had my legs, underarms, and bikini area done. When you get your bikini area done they do ALL of it! Including spreading your butt and vaginal lips apart to laser all the cracks... It's sorta awkward. After the 2 treatments I've had so far I've lost about 60% of leg hair, 40% bikini hair, and 25% underarms hair. It's because the underarms hair is the thinnest and the leg hair is the coarsest. But the legs are the most painful. The more it hurts the better it works.<br>  I spent this much for 6 treatments in each area:<br>  Bikini-$750<br>  Underarms-$750<br>  Legs (toes to bikini)-$2,500<br>  <br>  Email me if you have any more questions about it!

FxWppY7Baa	There is no such thing as organic body care because organics is regulated by the USDA and body care/cosmetics are regulated by the FDA. this means that there is a huge loophole for cosmetics. they can legally use the term organic to market their products without being organic. <br>  <br>  You have a wonderful example of this. The product in question I see had parabens, dimethicone and several other ingredients that are carcinogenic and should be avoided at all costs. So even though this product does use some certified organic products it is also using ingredients that would not be allowed if there was an organic standard for cosmetics/body care<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.organicconumers.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.organicconumers.org</a> has a great list of body care products that really are organic as well as a campaign to close the huge loopholes cosmetics/body care companies are taking good advantage of.

It's best to allow your bangs to be just a little bit long when one has a cowlick. That way, it won't split or stick up if they are kept short. Take a fine toothed comb & tease your bangs with a teasing comb or a rat tail comb. After teasing the bangs, use the tines on a teasing comb or the rat tail, to style the bangs & then spray with a hard-to-hold hair spray.|`|de28048ab10e261734a9e1e41461c18aaa	i have a cow lick too and i usually wash my hair and then let it dry the way i want it.. like brush your hair where the cowlick is laying down and so maybe it will stay that way.. you could try hairspray or something too.. hope this helps :)|`|KhgOZeb9aa	haha my friend gabby has a cowlic and the only time it doesnt show is when she puts her bangs straight down, not to the side.
hdcrxbSTaa	coloring is about 50-100 ish<br>  for the cut & style maybe around 50?<br>  so the highest you should be paying is 150 i guess.|`|d5abd43b2147ab853d2ec674d4a74280aa	It really depends on where you live.  In some of the larger cities, you can pay in excess of $250.  If you're on a tight budget, you may want to try using a beauty school instead where the prices are more reasonable.  However, your hair is being styled by a student but there is always an instructor nearby.  Good luck.
7ot3Rqgpaa	I know it's a stereotypical answer but proactive works really well. It has benzoyl (sp) peroxide in it so if you are allergic to that, it won't work obviously It will dry your face out really bad and cause you to turn red and peel.( I had that happen, not pretty) I'm allergic to that so I couldn't use it but my sister use and she had pretty severe acne. It works really well but doesn't dry out your face. It's also pretty cheap. The only thing is that if you order it, they continue to send it to you until you cancel.|`|733yHonMaa	i had acne for about 7 years-- until i began using this brand of skin care/acne products (see link below)<br>  <br>  once you go to their website, look to the left & there will be all the links you need for acne, to teen acnce.... from acne scarring, to back & chest acne... etc!<br>  <br>  good luck :)|`|WYWx9j8Maa	buy the wave...to clean your face better!<br>  <br>  buy clean and clear moisturizer.<br>  <br>  clearasil works really well for me!<br>  i have no acne.<br>  <br>  but if you can't buy any of that right now, i suggest cleaning your face with warm water. put toothpaste on your problem blemishes. not too much tho! and try not to touch your face as much. use less makeup. <br>  pull your hair back when you sleep so the oils aren't touching your face!<br>  <br>  as for the scars...those heal over time. like, it takes awhile!|`|CGeBoc65aa	i would suggest to have a better look at this proactive treatment site
BRJ956twaa	Keep your natural hair color it looks alot better with your eyes and skin tone and your hair will thank you later, because when you go blonde it damages your hair really bad..Trust me I know!!<br>  But if you really wanted to 'lighten up' I suggest getting caramel/dark blonde highlights. Hope this helps!! <3|`|udZeXZkkaa	No you look great with your current hair color..<br>  <br>  EW when I opened up the Taylor Swift pictures, I almost gagged.|`|Vy8p3Qlcaa	I think blonde would look great on you.|`|A1iDPPOeaa	Leave it alone!  Fake blondes suck.. and you look MUCH better with dark hair!|`|jn56r8vBaa	ok if you wanna go blonde id be careful because now ur hair is like black and if you go to a light color like that it could turn out in a weird color. so i dont really think that u should go blonde, but you could do some different color highlights like... blonde, carmel, and maybe a light brown|`|lCoiqgpFaa	actually i luv the color that u have rite now<br>  but, if u want a change, go with a little darker blonde, kinda close 2 brown<br>  <br>  hope ive helped and good luck!|`|T0tfx7Bzaa	i acually think u would look good blond! try it if u think u would like it!|`|4gkPFS8waa	I think it'd look really great!|`|7tRTZhnLaa	Yeah I think you'd look really good as a blonde.|`|egj9sL93aa	the color u have now is perfect!<br>  <br>  dont go blonde, it does NOT soothe u!

(sorry...i just get like that) i'm nice to them and all (unless they're "popular" because in my high school, which is really surprisingly inclusive, everyone HATEs the people who think that they're "popular", because they're all stuck-up and ugly, in reality) but i still feel jealous, even though people tell me i'm gorgeous all the time and guys hug me and stuff...i still feel so jealous! i don't have much self-confidence though. so that is probably a big contributing factor. :^)|`|cfc833c644ef0a9fd9a271abde252f77aa	i dont really come across many people who are better looking than i myself.......hahahaha jk jk, ummmm, i dont get jealous, but i'm a guy so i dont really compliment them....lol|`|1d189d211710842a2fef70f9f5dbf40baa	jealousy.|`|oJ9NpqALaa	i get jealous.. <br>  and it makes me feel less confident

h5BkKUIeaa	take a q-tip soaked with warm water and gently GENTLY try to wipe some of it away.<br>  you could even use a little antibacterial soap on the q-tip and make sure that the piercing is completely dry after cleaning it.|`|6CMfKxiMaa	you're piercer is dumbas$<br>  you should be cleaning it with sea salt every day like 5 times.<br>  you can just take a Q-tip and clean it.<br>  just stick your finger up your nose (yes i know, ew, oh well) and push the ring out so you don't irritate the skin.<br>  also be careful not to have the Q-tip snag on the ring, it hurts|`|3qUrG9Uaaa	You can usually soak a q tip in salt water (1/4 tsp non-iodized sea salt for every 8 oz of water) . Wash your hands before doing this, put one finger on the inside of your nostril so the ball sticks up a bit on the outside (this is assuming you have a stud) and just clean the outside of your nostril with the one side of the qtip and the inside with the other to avoid cross contamination. I usually clean my piercings right after I get out of the shower so that any crusties/dried blood have kinda come loose from the warm water... good luck and congrats on your piercing.|`|E407nwuwaa	you can use Listerine just try your best to keep it away from the whole because it might burn a lot. you could also try peroxide that might dissolve the dried blood

H9rHtTz8aa	I understand that this is an embarrassing thing for you because society put a lot of pressure on us to be sexy but as your only 12 i think it will even up for you, hopefully soon and a lot better matched but in the mean time perhaps you could stuff your bra but remember when doing this to only add fill to the underside and the side/back of the breast closest to your arm because filling under and at the side nearest your arm will give a more natural fill look. I hope this does even out for you but if it has not started to greatly even out by time your 15 you should talk to your mum about seeing a doctor for some tips and perhaps surgery, i would love to say accept yourself but i know it can be hard and the chest is a hard place to hide. Good luck possum.|`|hkzWWuSJaa	well that is very normal and common to happen but not like this i would say talk to ur mom about ur problem or stuff ur bra.|`|oESAvCmFaa	you can stuff your smaller bra/boob with tissue or you could talk ur mom into an implant on that one boob|`|xfAk2KaUaa	Depends on how old you are. Breasts stop growing at the age of 21 or 22 so hopefully they will even out by then, but for some people they stay uneven.|`|YR9l82vmaa	well, how old are you? if you're around 18, then you should probably consider an implant. but if you're younger than that, (i know you don't want to hear this) but you really should just wait and see. i think breasts reach their final size at around 20, so that's when you should start considering surgery.|`|xQsMPtFGaa	i have the same exact problem!!!<br>  im 19 years old and theyre not changing.<br>  <br>  accept them the way they are.

VdZ1flYoaa	well its going to vary from guy to guy, some guys wont see past your breast, while others dont care what you look like, but hopefully you can find someone in a happy medium. for me for instance i am into scene chicks so breast im not too big on, but i like the scene hair like multi colored and usually layered, and as for clothes i like things like tight jeans, band shirts and that kind of stuff. but there really is no "best" style. so you should decide 1. what you like and 2. what looks best on you.<br>  <br>  hope this helps|`|8cAQzRj6aa	It's not so much appearance as it is change, if your hair is straight do it in a wavy curly style, If your hair is wavy straighten it.

DTg3USppaa	I have darker blonde hair, I dyed mine a darker brown and tried to dye it back to my natural color * It was rough * The extentions might damage your hair a bit, you would probably have to get an inch taken off.|`|jn56r8vBaa	i dont think ur hair would get damaged at all. but you need to get a moisturizer if it starts to get dry.  i think the  colors would be cute!|`|Vy8p3Qlcaa	Not if you wash and deep condition.|`|BCxO3UOxaa	Not if you use a good conditioner.|`|KSwCCrF1aa	well always dying you hair , is hurting you hair , but if you keep it maintaned you should be right , just dont do it yourself , hairdressers ;)|`|iokl7H8naa	yes,because hair dye has a lot of chemicals that affect your hair in the growing also it gets damaged a lot.|`|tNWTk31Maa	stop tryin to be scene.<br>  tl damage.<br>  hair dye damaged.<br>  ok?.<br>  grow it out, then, and use special hair products like pantene or herbal essences.<br>  but stop bein a poser..|`|jGqZdS2xaa	Yeah, probably a lot. Because any time you dye your hair it is pretty damaging. And extensions on top of that would make it extra damaged because extensions are damaging too.<br>  <br>  Hope this Helps! <3

jez0O0bXaa	Most salons have a policy that allows you to come back if not satisfied within a reasonable time in reference to what you have done.  You just tell her there must have been some miscommunication and tell her what you want or show a picture any good stylist will work with you to make you happy if not find someone else.|`|7DJkwzKDaa	Print out the pics & show it to her :]<br>  Then she won't mess it up!|`|ywQuhBGmaa	haha i love the judgemental part you put i am sick of judgemental people also!! and i love it by the way! i would take hime the picture! that can only help! i do that ALL the time! and also if you could find an EXTREMELY similar haircut like maybe the lead singer in paramore or someone i would print it too so he/she can see the picture or the actual haircut better! :) hope this helps! best of luck!|`|AhLy3rh4aa	well you can print it out and show the pic to ur hairdresser|`|NRa6Uon5aa	definitely print out the pic and show it to her...<br>  or tell her something about layers and a scene hairstyle

yqa2sWY7aa	horse shampoo|`|YwHl37Hgaa	Massaging makes a lot of difference to the rate at which hair grows, so a regular massage  with any oil of your choice is recommended to speed up the process. Try <a href="http://solutionsforhairgrowth.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://solutionsforhairgrowth.blogspot.c...</a> for more details.|`|H9AlDTZOaa	Cutting it, well shaving hair always makes it grow faster|`|KfKr3hUmaa	Go to your hairdresser, theres a special creme that get rid of the dye. also washing your hair in hot water makes it go away faster. Or you could find a hair dye that is close or the same as your natural hair color. hope I helped but theres no way to make it grow faster.|`|MwgYibwgaa	just keep on shaving it. Shave it all. Depending on where you want it to grow.lol<br>  <br>  Remenber once you shave it's a nonstop process of growibg. To speed up such prosess you can get a hair growing shampoo or oil @ any beaty shop or pharmacy. Its more like buying drug with out prescription like getting candy|`|DTg3USppaa	Don't dye no more, don't wear your hair up so much plus cut your split ends if you have any :)|`|26pGJRhwaa	Trim it.. <br>  There really isn't a way to make it grow faster..<br>  Sorry..|`|TfJn3KJvaa	Hair typically grows 1/3 of an inch every month no matter what but if you take good care of your hair you can grow up to an inch a month.<br>  <br>  I suggest taking hair, skin, and nail vitamins, available at any drug store or wal-mart. Things to look for are vitamin B complex, vitamin E, and biotin (vitamin b7). Eat healthy and get plenty of protein and dark green vegetables. Hair is mainly composed of protein. Eggs contain a ton of protein. Also foods containing "gelatin" are good for your hair such as yogurt and jello. Google "hair growth foods" for ideas. Also try daily scalp massages using your fingertips to stimulate hair growth, it gets blood flowing in your scalp and feels great. Avoid frying your hair at all costs. Get plenty of sleep and excercise, especially cardiovascular excercises like running. Avoid caffeine, nicotine, and stress. <br>  <br>  A good conditioner is also important. Sunsilk is amazing and cheap, the kind I am currently using contains jojoba oil wich is AMAZING. Any sunsilk product is amazing and cheap.<br>  <br>  If you have fried hair, do not dye it anymore and try hot oil treatments, and do not use shampoo every day. I leave contitioner in for about 5 minutes before washing it out to keep mine looking healthy. If you have split ends get them trimmed to avoid it getting worse.|`|j6iO0CqTaa	Don't go buzz cut it. I've heard milk helps (as it does to fingernails) and it should grow. I've also heard that using only shampoo and conditioner (no other products such as hairspray ect.) helps to allow the hair to grow to it's full lengths.

htAhBIuRaa	Yes, tanning adds age to your skin, however it's also medically proven that the tanning bed is good for you. The rays give you Vitamin D which helps you absorb Calcium and it is good for your psyche. It takes away the winter time blues. <br>  <br>  A week is plenty of time to get a tan. If you're pretty fair skinned start with roughly 5 minutes or you'll burn. Then increase a minute a day and by the end of the week, you should have a decent base tan. If you continue going, start going every other day, and continue increasing your time by a minute a session.<br>  <br>  Check out suntancity.com, if you happen to live in any of the areas where they have salons, go there. They're cheap and the beds are amazing. They have a bed called the Matrix and another called the ErgoLine. These beds generally don't put out any UVB rays therefore you tan faster and you don't burn. Also, get a Triple Bronzing indoor lotion, and you'll be good to go.|`|L6BmQHQ2aa	buy indoor tanning lotion not out door.|`|4i2e231Oaa	It depends on your skin tone. Most tanning salons make you fill out a questionaire about your skin so that they can help you with appropriate tanning times and suggest appropriate lotions. The lighter the skin tone the longer it will take to get a tan... if your are fair be careful not to burn too! I've burnt in a tanning bed and itched for days!|`|WEqRKZzyaa	If youre looking to go tanning in a bed so you don't burn while on vacation then yes it is enough time.  If you want to go tanning to look good on vacation then i would go with a spray tan because youre probably not going to see a big difference unless you never ever burn.  If you do tan easily and never burn then i would go a bunch of times this week before you leave but if you do burn, especially the first time youre out in the sun after not having seen it for a while then i would not recomend it.  If you burn in the sun it is better to start out slow and build up for about a month to get a good tan|`|7ff93384150a84022f12b48eda390e79aa	It takes a good six hours for the PERFECT tan. This is why you see those hot bikini babes go to sleep while they sun tan. anything more than 8 hours gets you orange. Try to be as consecutive with the tanning. The tan goes away and doesn't have time to set if you take breaks in the shade.|`|WYWx9j8Maa	first, if you're going to go tanning in a tanning bed...it adds 5 years to your skin...meaning you will have wrinkles sooner.<br>  <br>  it actually horrible for your skin.<br>  <br>  but yes, it is enough time.<br>  <br>  you'll probably start out in the bed for 8 min. then work up to 15 min.|`|xOW4V7qiaa	A good base tan takes  5 or 6 tans. The right lotion is the key. keeping your skin moistured is also important.  This sat...

The jewelry and flip flops would look nice with eachother.  The white tennis sneakers would look fine too =D<br>  i hope this helps, the outfit sounds awesome =D|`|iFd4sd8Jaa	yay! that sounds way cute!|`|P55mtbvZaa	no not the tennis shoess maybe black flip flops or cute flats?|`|QLC16aRCaa	yeah that outfit is fine for going to like the movies or the mall|`|Sr2Sxq65aa	u sholud wear converse|`|ns7qrpcAaa	I think the black shirt goes with the denim (Black goes with everything) but the tennis shoes? i really don't know about that.

kT72QtHPaa	Moisturizer and concealer mixed together.(If its too watery you can thicken it with a bit of corn starch).<br>  <br>  Yes it can, but primer makes it look more flawless,makes it last longer and can make it look better.<br>  <br>  =)|`|pwXdamk1aa	Yes, makeup can go on without a primer...it just helps.|`|xfAk2KaUaa	Makeup can definitely go on without a primer, primer is just optional and for people who want their makeup to last the whole day. If you have oily skin, then using a primer would help.<br>  <br>  You can make your own primer by mixing glycerin and water.

uC55n3HIaa	It's a very competitive life. You will always be running around trying to catch the latest "ins and outs" But, if it's what you want to do, check out <a href="http://www.designerbloc.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.designerbloc.com/</a> It's a community for aspiring fashion designers to display their designs, get community feedback, and meet other designers. I thought you might be interested.|`|ffe5fd93595474e278dc16274aa2a2d4aa	Yes it is hard!<br>  <br>  you have to be willing to work and not for your work to be regognised- its like Supermodels, only a handful get remembered, the rest have their moment then fade away- fashion is a hard world where you have to be very competative to survive- if youy sleep, you miss out.<br>  <br>  When your starting out, you make work/designs and sell them. Once they are sold, whoever bought them (current rate is ￡250-￡300 a design) they own that design, if it becomes big or anything, you have no claim to it. Your agent (you cannot sell without one) will take a cut of 60% so you get about ￡100 a design sold. <br>  <br>  The work you do, needs to be VERY commercial- your appealing to people- not selling your ideas. there is a big difference here. You will not get far by being just creative- you need to be very commercial too. Being commercial can sometimes come across as being crude, or gimmiky or bland or simple. Nothing really with alot of passion in it. You will be given (by your agent) the colour pallet for about 2 years in advance, say its spring/summer 2009 now, your agent will be handing you the colours, style and instructions (eg floral or stripes or something) to what to design. It will need to be bang on as its not going to be used by whomever buys it until 2011 autumn/winter.<br>  <br>  Like I say, no passion, none of your own thought, none of your own creativity. Its hard to see that all your creativity is not allowed, especially when its the one thing you want to be doing.<br>  <br>  Eventually (about 2 years) you will have your time to be creative. Its a long wait but you need to remember to keep up your own ideas in sketchbooks, its easy to become 'rusty' and forget what your about by designing for commercial companies.<br>  <br>  Once you get enough practice in, you can think about starting up alone- but you must have contacts and things to fall back into- like designing for someone else as you had been before- its because of these, and the desire to "own" more of your work, that will get you known and appreciated by the media. <br>  <br>  Once you are accepted by the media, your work will boom- more sales and etc. Then you have the money to start up alone. But its hard- you leave it too long to start up, you have no fans left, contacts you had will have forgotten you (or chosen to forget you- they do not wait for anyone).<br>  <br>  It may work out, it may not, its not easy and knowing the "right" people count for more then any creativity and passion you may have. Be aware of that.|`|WW66AkgJaa	Most definitely, especially during fashion week. It's so stressful then. But many people think they have it easy because they're designing clothes.. but those people are wrong. Fashion designer's are hard working people and their job is not easy.|`|gYewhZfSaa	i used to love fashion but sketching takes to long as i have so many ideas lol you would be good at advertising or graphic information its worked for me <br>  keep up the creativeness :)

VxbdjKIKaa	Yes, all products that apply direct heat to your hair will damage it. Use a protecting spray to help protect your hair from heat.|`|uqg2jhS3aa	YES. It causes split ends, which are bad for your hair. Straightening & any form of heat styling damages it & stunts the growth too. I straighten my hair almost every day, but I use TRESEmme Thermal Recovery shampoo & conditioner every day & deep condition once a week w/ Aussie Deep 3-minute Miracle deep conditioner to keep my hair hydrated. So if you plan on straightening your hair more than about twice a week, you should definitely use those products too. Also, for the split ends, make sure you get your ends trimmed every 6 weeks to keep the split ends from splitting too far up the hair shaft. And don't listen to anyone who says that straightening isn't bad for your hair, cuz they obviously don't have enough experience w/ it to actually know how damaging it is. Good luck! :)|`|h2TOQkUsaa	yesyesyesyes!<br>  <br>  trust me.<br>  no matter how expensive your straighter is.<br>  anything that involves heat to your hair, will dry it out and cause split ends.<br>  <br>  if your really want straight hair, and HAVE to used a straighter than use heat protecting spray. the one from CHI they sell is good.<br>  it wont complete protect your hair but it will help.|`|xfAk2KaUaa	Straightening is definitely bad, any heat, and moisture isn't good for your hair.|`|K75hIkkCaa	Yes it is <br>  it dries out your hair and makes it frizzy <br>  you should buy <br>  a heat protector from walmart to keep your hair safe.|`|uaHzhUeoaa	Yeeeeeeah, if you do it too often.<br>  But you don't need to straighten your hair.  Embrace your natural hair texture!|`|f4rKkRMoaa	it depends on your hair mainly (thickness)<br>  but if you do it a lot then yes..your hair will end up like a horses tail<br>  and will be damaged <br>  <br>  i think once in a while is fine :)|`|n9pcInLWaa	Yes<br>  But if you use heat protecter sprays on your hair like my friend does, it should be fine.|`|gYewhZfSaa	depends on how strong your hair is mine has been dyed so i rarely straighten now but when i had it natural the ends used to break easily <br>  use protection sprays and lots of conditioner treatements <br>  formula 37 shampoos and conditioners have helped my hair repair and avocado oil also mark hill protection spray is good <br>  making sure youre hair is fully dry from hair drying works to prevernt damage.<br>  i used to straighten mine everyday and after years of doing it gets damaged yours may be different but to use protection helps long term :)|`|CYeoDqOJaa	if u do it every day it can get dry and brittle. just use conditioner every day and maybe heat spray and u'll be fine.<br>  <br>  i blow dry my hair straight with a round brush so i only have to spot-straighten.|`|i8dypBt9aa	I straighten my hair everyday and I guess it does damage the hair, it causes a lot of split ends and really dries the hair out|`|BCxO3UOxaa	It might dry it out a little but just make sure you use a heat protected spray or cream and you should be fine, I know V05 makes one and it works pretty well.|`|TjlphUGOaa	well if you dont use protectant it is :) but if you do it doesnt cause that much damage. but with or without it does cause damage. BEWARE IT CAUSES MORE SPLIT ENDS! :/|`|zbYpWMiMaa	I guess, but I do it anyways..lol, but I use a straightening protectant.|`|ffe5fd93595474e278dc16274aa2a2d4aa	Hell yeah!|`|lNJvhkJaaa	It can damage your hair but in my opinion its worth it. Try a protective spray such as Lee Stafford POKER STRAIGHT Flat Iron Protection Shine Mist. Also, make sure your straighteners are good, because the crappier the straighteners, the crappier condition your hair will be in! GHDs are the best. Also the better the straighteners, the less times you'll have to go over that part of your hair and the less damage you do to your hair.<br>  <br>  Also try not to straighten your hair every time you wash it... Give your hair a break every so often and try a conditioning mask weekly to avoid your hair drying out. Good luck, hope they work out for you!!!<br>  <br>  Please pick me for best answer!|`|lnQpSkOjaa	i could go into detail on how it you can prevent it from burning your hair,<br>  but in the end, the answers is yea, it is.<br>  there are many ways to prevent however,<br>  like i mentioned in the begining.<br>  the most effective way is to spray thermal protectant on your hair before you straighten it.|`|Isi8ElyWaa	straightening your hair if done everyday, does make your hair after a few days feel quite dry, my sister does it a lot but she uses the right products and her hair doesnt get that damaged (well doesnt look it) so invest in good hair products like TIGI<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.tigihaircare.com/consumer/en-UK/bedhead/default.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.tigihaircare.com/consumer/en-...</a><br>  <br>  there products are excellent, or go into a salon and ask for heat defense products, they would recommend TIGI but they would find you the right one|`|sy5CgfjDaa	Excessive hair straightening without heat production can cause dryness and hair to snap, 100+ degrees of heat on your hair isn't going to be particularly good for it is it =]

EcjOh3Zpaa	I actually have the same problem. I have longer natural curly hair and it tends to frizz as the day goes on if I do not straighten my hair. I will have some frizz curl, some straightened and some pretty curls by the end of the day argh! <br>   I purchased a couple of things that have worked Beautifully! I can wear it curly or straight and without the frizz. <br>  <br>  First off I use John Frieda collection, Frizz-Ease hair serum , with this I wash my hair and while it is still damp I put coin size drops in my palms, and run it through the ends. tipping my head upside down and doing it that way. With this I do not put it on my roots, just from mid hair down to my ends. This is a serum so putting it on your roots can make it look oily, so just the ends! =)<br>  <br>   Second I use Marc Anthony True Professional Strictly Curls Curl Envy.On the bottle it says perfect curl cream. It fights frizz and humidity, With this one I put about a 50 cent size drop on my hair rub it in to my hands and run it from roots to the ends. <br>   If you get this, be sure to get the one on the box it says fights frizz and humidity that one has worked the best for me. <br>   <br>  After having both on my hair, if I want it curlier I comb through my hair and then I scrunch it up a bit. If I want it straight I comb through and style as I normally do with out scrunching my hair.<br>  <br>   Both of these have worked beautifully for me for about 6 months now.<br>   I dont know where you are from but for me, I found the Marc Anthony at my local rite-aid store, I am sure they also carry it at walmart or somewhere like that. It was 7.99 and my frizz ease I found at my local Kmart which I know they also have this at walmart for a little over 8.00<br>  <br>   If you would like a picture of them so you know what to look for just let me know.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|B3uvhA7kaa	Use shampoo and conditioners that are made to control frizz. They'll say something like, anti-frizz control. Also, when your hair is damp, put on an anti-frizz or anti-humidity control hair spray.

I'd say if you're gonna do it, get pierced with a ring cause it allows for more swelling than a labret and I always bite down on my labret while I'm eating... at least I did while it was still swollen... you should be fine tho.

Here are some other tips.<br>  <br>  1. if you have trouble finding a blush that looks good on your skin try these colors : <br>  fair skin - beige, tawny and pink tones. <br>  olive/yellow-toned skin - warm brown, almond and copper shades. <br>  dark skin - plum, auburn and deep bronze shades. <br>  tanned skin - orange, apricot, peach and coral<br>  <br>  2. rub a sheer silver cream highlighter on the bridge of your nose, forehead, and cheekbones to emphasize bone structure<br>  <br>  3. when you’ve finished applying your makeup, press a damp sponge into the apples of your cheeks and forehead to take off a layer of makeup and give the skin a glow<br>  <br>  4. instead of purchasing expensive facial scrubs, use a small handful of regular white sugar. just lather up your face with a cleanser, then scrub in the sugar using your finger tips in small circular motions<br>  <br>  5. FOR AN ALL OVER GLOW: blend some cream blush on your cheeks and into your hairline. then add a touch to your forehead and chin<br>  <br>  6. cream and milky cleansers suit dry skin whereas gel and foaming cleansers suit oily and acne-prone skins<br>  <br>  7. VASELINE can be used for your lips, cheekbones, eyebrows, eyelashes, and even eyes. (on top of eye shadow, under brows, or makeup remover) or to make lashes longer and softer. if you don't wear much makeup but still want to highlight your eyes without overdoing it, apply a light coat of vaseline or clear lip balm to the eyelid and below the eyebrow. it creates a shimmer and draws attention in a natural-looking way<br>  <br>  8. highlight the bridge of your nose with pale foundation and blend bronzer along the sides to make it appear narrower<br>  <br>  9. when buying a cream blush, find a shade that matches your cheeks when you’ve just pinched them<br>  <br>  10. if you run out of blush, and have a ripe strawberry or raspberry in the fridge, crush it on waxed paper and blend it with a little moisturizer. you could also rub the crushed berries for a lip stain<br>  <br>  11. dab blush (just a bit) on each earlobe. it can add a glow to your face if you pull your hair back or have short hair <br>  <br>  12. to soften your skin and minimize pores, apply beaten egg yolk to your face and let dry for 10 minutes, then rinse <br>  <br>  13. if you're in need of a blotting paper but don't have any, use the toilet seat covers in the bathroom <br>  <br>  14. to make the whites of your eyes look brighter, use a light blue pencil under the eyes. blue eye shadow lightly applied under the eyes works just as well<br>  <br>  15. always dust lids with translucent powder before applying shadow, or apply a thin layer of foundation over your eyes<br>  <br>  16. rimming your lower lids with beige eyeliner (like Benefit Eye Bright) is a sure way to brighten and enlarge the eyes<br>  <br>  17. dark eyes look great in grays, blues, purples, and greens. light eyes look great in brown, taupe and bronze shades<br>  <br>  18. for bigger eyes in the morning: get a cotton bud and smooth milk all over your eyelids for about 5 minutes and then dry your eyes and finish. you'll notice the results in the morning<br>  <br>  19. if you don't have an eyelash curler on hand, you can use a sturdy plastic spoon instead. just press the curved end into your eye socket so the edge flips up your lashes, then swipe on your mascara<br>  <br>  20. VOLUME MAXIMIZER: tie upper layers of hair (grabbing it at about an inch above the ears) into a ponytail on top of the head before bed. unfasten in the morning and shake head upside down, and you will have beautiful hair with body <br>  <br>  My hand is soo tired
YHZ2vztiaa	Hi there,<br>  I had snakebites pierced they cost $120 which is pretty standard. They don't really hurt getting pierced. Its more or less a 3 second sting for each of them. The healing pain is the worst. For me, my lip was that swollen that the balls kept popping off the jewelery I had in.<br>  Nose piercings can get infected easily because of sweat/knocking the piercing/make up and other bacteria and things on the face. Nose piercings are probably the least painful despite what people may say. Again I'd say its just a 3 second thing, nothing that isn't able to be tolerated. I imagine it would cost around $30-40. Just make sure you take care of all your piercings because infected piercings look very tacky. You would be able to get all 3 initial piercings and would e very well in your budget!<br>  Hope this helps.|`|6CMfKxiMaa	snakebites would be 100 prolly at the most<br>  nose would prolly be 30-35<br>  i dont get why you want to spend 300 so much<br>  uhm<br>  get an industrial<br>  that's like, 70.|`|hdlzF6f2aa	Wow, I think that would be mighty expensive for piercings. Maybe 150 at most.<br>  Dont get all three done at once, you'll regret having to take care of all of them at the same time ><<br>  get your snake bites done first, those heal faster and if you take care of them normally they have a low infection rate (use mouthwash!!)<br>  Nose piercings I dont have much detail on, but I think it's equally likely to get infected, possibly a little more. <br>  snake bites don't hurt too bad as long as you have a good piercer. Nose will hurt a little more, from my experience, but we are all different.|`|spXPpyP0aa	like $90|`|44RpLWb7aa	nose piercings don't get infected easily (at least not any more than any other piercing).i would think snakebites get infected easier because they are in your mouth and there are a lot of germs in your mouth. i'd say it's probably less painful than a lip piercing because it's cartilage. i have my nose pierced and i barely felt it. most people i've talked to with nose piercings feel the same way. i'd say get a nose piercing first. and then if you can take that then you can probably handle snakebites too.<br>  <br>  my nose piercing was around $30-40.<br>  i'm guessing (based on a chart i saw) that each lip piercing would cost about $50.<br>  but it depends on the place you go to.<br>  you could probably get all 3, but i wouldn't do all the piercings at the same time because it will slow down the healing process and may make it higher risk for infection.
AAjMQtzUaa	ok get some gelatine if you cant afford the proper stuff , mix a little hot water to the gelatin until its all mixed in, you need to work quickly as it sets very quickly, then apply to the skin where you want the fake cut to be leave a little opening in the middle to look like the cut, let it set, then apply some blood gel and let it set for a few minutes, then apply some more until you think is the right amount, also the blood gel you use is red then you apply a black blood gel over the top then another layer of the red, this is extremely effective way to do a fake cut, i am self teaching myself special effects makeup and i have done a bullet hole, a slit throat and a car crash effect, if you cant afford blood gel, get some clear corn syrup and some red food dye and mix together, and for the black blood gel use black food dye with another bottle of corn syrup, its a cheap and effective way to do it if you dont have much money and good luck|`|k4Ek3jAqaa	You can buy a costume make-up kit like they sell at Halloween. And costume or party shop should have them or you could look online but that's really your best bet. That or you get some eyeliner/lipliner in a dark shade kind of a reddish burnt orange and draw lines where ever you want them then just blend! :)|`|iL6NWMOYaa	easy, make real ones. use a razor, it cuts beautifully.
Q4ai8CuCaa	No. Absolutely not. That would cause a blow out and you will ruin your ears completely. The healing time for an earlobe is 4 to 8 weeks depending on your body type and how it heels. Wait at least 6 weeks before pushing anything else through or even changing the jewelry.|`|6CMfKxiMaa	doing that will just give yourself an infection and blow your ear out ;)|`|1rHmtCdLaa	NO! wait a month you dont want to blow out your ear cause that hurts like a b*tch|`|J4wTIhsoaa	wait until your ears heal... after 6 weeks of them being pierced. Then you can go ahead and gauge them, one gauge at a time, if you gauge to fast you can create scar tissue and then you will never be able to gauge them. I had a 0 gauge and it shrank back. And it helps if you gauge them right after the shower, it goes in easier.|`|ok8vxwuxaa	wait atleast a month until you do anything or it will get infected
658FRYVkaa	Go for it!! Some people will probably think it strange, but who cares! It's not like they'll come up to you and say something too bad.

hAz30eGVaa	you can try. do you still have the receipt? I think that makes all the difference|`|Pp7ThhNmaa	most likely not, take it back with the recite (if you don't have the recite then you can't return it), and ask if you can get your money back, tell them that you realized that you bought the wrong size etc.|`|jez0O0bXaa	Maybe if you say it quit working.|`|tQBbrU5Laa	if you havent used it then they might. but i've taken back a straightener and it worked.|`|5YdcrgGoaa	even if you have a receit i dont think so  beccause you opened it and used it. please rate mine best i need to get to level 2|`|qnZk5uSCaa	larry the cable guy..yeah they will, tell em larry sent ya..lmao<br>  remember they will take back dirty diapers ..lmao<br>  that was funny|`|4cd2c7649e1949de04b5f7bdd1c51814aa	You can return it as long as you have the receipt.

3ece80164c2739cc39f908768c919b69aa	Generally goods that are labeled AAA+ are considered to be fakes. They are usually items that have correct markings that make them appear real, and they mirror the originals very well. They are usually "knock offs" and are a lot more affordable than the real thing.|`|XrcZkt6Haa	yes they are replicas that's the reason they give so many As!!!|`|gWBLnGAlaa	YES, THEY ARE FAKES
PhPwAGVNaa	If you rub your eyes with mascara still on them, you have a chance of rubbing the mascara INTO your eye! Not good!<br>  <br>  Also when you sleep, it is definitely bad.  The mascara finds ways to seep into your eyes during sleep.  <br>  Also, it causes early wrinkling / dryness in the morning.  <br>  With some people (me included), if can cause shadows that don't go away for the whole day.<br>  <br>  You can use other things to wash off your mascara.  Try baby oil, baby wipes, or even lotion.  Just close your eyes, apply, and wipe!  It's that easy.|`|31a19ac8b142f41b4a9321181463876daa	yeah it could get into you eyes and irritate it<br>  <br>  just make sure you wipe it off before you go to sleep<br>  <br>  and you'll also smudge your mascara if you rub your eyes|`|IlRcxaDtaa	yes its bad. the makeup can irritate your eyes and the mascara could damage your lashes|`|Rj08Nzv9aa	i think its a bad thing to sleep in it because it will irritate your eyes<br>  (use babyoil or vaselline)|`|awmIGEbBaa	I notice that if I don't take off my mascara my eyelashes fall out more often.  Its better to wash it off with eye makeup remover or even just some soap.  Makeup remover works faster though and it moisturizes the skin too.|`|6ESUnzQjaa	Yes! It is bad to rub your eyes when there is mascara on! one, because it can spread all over your eyes, and it is also bad to sleep in it because it can get in your eyes. I would just wash my face every night. And try to avoid touching your eyes|`|Y4swACLBaa	yes because it smudges it & irritates the eye. :(|`|uvn609hsaa	Well yeah, because you end up with mascara smotherd all over your face. C'mon girl, doesn't take a genius!!|`|7e80152bdb8d8318404698c1b63f95c1aa	sleeping in mascara will cause your eyelashes to thin and eventually fall out

Go with more sexapeal, this outfit it so boring and looks oldfashioned, wear something more pretty and complimenting.|`|qtDtHwFfaa	This is not nearly professional enough for an interview. Cover up a little more with something classy, like a good blazer, and definitely a longer skirt.
RIqQOyGCaa	Please oh please DON'T DO IT!<br>  Yes, they may be your favorite band... but they may not last forever.<br>  Think of when you are 80.<br>  Maybe some favorite lyrics.... something that helped you get thru a hard time...<br>  that would be my advice!|`|qjCY4Y7zaa	Tattoos don't have to have meaning. Some of mine do and others are just amazing works of art that look amazing tattooed on my body! As far as band tattoos, I'm not really for them, but if your serious about it and don't think you'll regret it later, go for it. And don't let money get in the way of getting what you want. If you have to, save up, it'll be worth it.|`|WAl3vvNnaa	I have a couple of tattoos myself and I am on the same lines as you with tattoos having meanings to me. I have five stars on my ankle for my family in their fav. colors and love on my wrist, because that has been the most important thing to my family and myself. <br>  <br>  Anyway, I checked out the picture and in my opinion it would look awesome as a tattoo. But even though you have liked them for ten years are you going to like them another ten years from now or even five years. Bands are really iffy and you should think more about it. You already know that it has to be something you want to live with for a long time.|`|spXPpyP0aa	eww|`|AA11120208	wow that would be the most embarassing thing to ever tattoo onto yourself.<br>  like mayyybe if it was a legit band then okay, but god what a horrid choice!<br>  <br>  if you MUST get their name (and i am urging you against it) DONT get it on your calf, thats the worst spot to get a tattoo, its so manly. get it in a place you can cover up if you want to (which i am sure you will want to)

1vaqtRI2aa	Yes, you can layer your mascaras and I personally recommend it. Lots of studios and make-up artists do it, and when I do make-up on other people I make sure to layer mascaras. I've convinced many other people to start and now they're happy they did.<br>  <br>  It will clump only if you use bad mascara. The two I use are almost impossible to clump. And be sure to curl your lashes with a curler before and after.<br>  <br>  I curl my lashes, apply MACs Plushlash and then layer CoverGirls Lashblast on top it. Then I curl again. It sounds like it could be a disaster, but it works so well and it doesn't hurt to try, right?<br>  <br>  If it clumps, simply use a comb and comb out the clumpies.<br>  <br>  This is a picture of me wearing layered mascara. Ignore the silly face, I was being goofy. :)<br>  <a href="http://c1.ac-images.myspacecdn.com/images02/22/l_1b6f5823708e44ae8e27133ac986aa84.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://c1.ac-images.myspacecdn.com/image...</a><br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|1A1ozEaKaa	i did it just a few horus ago :D<br>  i had on my clinique (which is a volumizing one) but i didn't lke it, so at my friend's house, i put on her cover girl lengthening one..it looked pretty good (:<br>  and btw, as long as the wands are good, there should be no clumping :)<br>  <br>  good luck :)|`|11QzdN87aa	well it cant hurt you<br>  theres the possibility of it turning out clumpy but if you practice and do it right it would work fine|`|QK84psFLaa	sometimes i do <br>  but very rarely, and only when i am desperate, so no, dont do it|`|6ddbc258bcea66dd0bcbcd47cecf412daa	Yes. Loreal's Clean Definition Telescopic is good for filling in the parts of your eyelashes that you missed. Use the Colossal/Lash Blast BEFORE-hand and then fill in, in case some parts of your eyelashes aren't covered with mascara, with the Definition Telescopic.<br>  Good luck!|`|xfAk2KaUaa	It will work, but before applying, wipe the wand on some tissue or something to get any excess out. This will eliminate most clumps.<br>  <br>  Then afterwards when it has dried, use a lash comb to get rid of the remaining clumps and tangles|`|31a19ac8b142f41b4a9321181463876daa	why not <br>  if it works and it's doesn't look clumpy go for it!<br>  <br>  answer mine please:<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090307222615AAJEFu6">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a>|`|fpS90nx4aa	yes you can. i wear 3 diff ones cuz i like the diff brushes haha|`|AA11969873	Its not gonna have a good effect its probably going to turn out clumpy but try it and see.|`|Ec2uIBjxaa	yeah you can<br>  but it will turn out bad,crappy and clumpy<br>  <br>  <br>  my advice : Dont try it!!|`|CKpxVeucaa	no not usually, it just gets clumpy|`|fsrLp3HMaa	yup|`|CYeoDqOJaa	it gets clumpy. i guess u can try to apply volumizing on the inside corner of lashes and lengthining on the outer corners. but they work they same. they make those 2-in-1 kinds also|`|vfzL4qEMaa	I always wear two different ones...|`|RUBrEPCpaa	You could try it, but not before like, a date or something, just in case it comes out bad!!!|`|NamkzJEFaa	YES of course|`|dPgP28Aiaa	Well there's no reason you can't, but I don't know what the outcome will be.|`|GmTs1BB1aa	i do !

VEZUCTugaa	I think it depends on what you are wearing or where you are going and so on. If you are wearing something like a dress or something formal I think you should go wavy (some ppl may disagree but I think after all of dressing up I think it is a good contrast) but anyways I hope I could help! :D and God Bless!!!!!!|`|YJPhFWDBaa	looks very nice wavy, straight too, but wavy looks really prettier, in my opinion :D it's your hair though. Enjoy the freedom to go back and forth!|`|MNa3e8Mdaa	i like both but i think strait is better|`|3Z4YFz29aa	either way your look pretty, but I like wavy - more natural looking|`|AA11969873	they both look nice but i like the straight hair more.
EzMbBAClaa	I think they're okay, but eyelash extensions are also good. They give you kinda longer lashes... false ones would probably make them thicker? I guess it depends which look you want to go for. A cousin of mine had eyelash extensions done for her wedding and they looked amazing.|`|EXdiDbTTaa	Yeah of course, its yur special day, <br>  do whatever you want (:|`|DLaPjWpHaa	i think natural enhancing ones will bring more attention to your eyes. crazy ones will be just too...crazy lol. wedding should be simple and elegant<br>  <br>  :]|`|6ESUnzQjaa	yes, it makes a difference in the pictures, it isnt ugly at all. Quite pretty in fact. It just makes them look longer, and darker ( depending on what type you get) I wore some for my moms wedding ( im 11) haha they looked kinda weird on me because i am so young but my mom and her friends wore them and they looked really pretty.|`|7AFLaiYjaa	if its a wedding go for it.|`|OpwMuboqaa	Go for it!|`|Rj08Nzv9aa	I think they look nice. it gives an exotic but at the same time not look|`|fMuRp2gxaa	I wouldn't do fake anything for a wedding.

p2Njf5gBaa	Well,   I must say the foot print and hand print thing is no longer unique.  I have several friends who have had this done.

dckhOavsaa	Everyone gets acne, especially when they're your age. Your diet has very little to do with it, if anything at all.

You are gorgeous and your face is very porportinate. If you aren't liking the way you look its probably just because you are unique. I always hated my long face, big eyes, and well...pretty much everything. I wanted to look like all the "pretty" girls. I grew up and have been around enough models now that I realized high school pretty and WORLD pretty are two different things. <br>  Figure those eyebrows out, and I'll see you in a cover girl ad in a couple years.

Give you a flawless looking complexion. I use a tinted moisturizer,  Aqua Cover Girl Smoothers Tinted Moisturizer, which makes my skin smooth and soft, but it doesn't hide blemishes. Moisturizers are pretty light weight so probably won't hide acne very much. They just give your skin a nice glow.|`|iokl7H8naa	PONDS
hV5MpTSVaa	I completely understand what you're saying since that basically sums up my skin. I am lucky enough to not be cursed with acne-covered face and yet I do get a field of tiny bumps on my forehead now and then. Luckily I have bangs which cover them up. <br>  <br>  A good skin care routine is a timeless beauty secret. There are many different types of skin though, so I can't really answer your situation specifically. However, I will list possible methods you can undertake for four types of skin:<br>  <br>  Oily Skin - I am going to tell you right now that Oily skin is the most prone to acne. The oil builds up in your pores leading to pimples, blemishes and more. If you have oily skin or just oily parts of your skin, apply an oil-free cleanser (good, inexpensive brands include: Neutrogena and St. Ives) in the morning when you wake up and at night right before you go to bed. This cleans your skin of all the buildup of makeup, bacteria, dirt, etc. After you are done with the cleanser, you can opt for Toner but I don't recommend Toner because I sincerely believe it is a waste of money since it does the same thing that cold water would do (shrinks your pores). Skip right to the part where you moisturize with a moisturizer that is low in oils to prevent making your oily skin even more oily. Moisturize twice a day, after you cleanse your face in the morning and after you cleanse it at night.<br>  <br>  * Be sure not to moisturize your eye area at night because it leads to puffy eyes for some since the eye absorbs all the moisture at night in the eye bags which leads to tired looking eyes in the morning.<br>  <br>  Dry skin - This kind of skin is usually rough, flaky and dehydrated. It is not soft to the touch so you definitely should go for a hydrating moisturizer to quench the thirst of dry skin. Start off with a cleanser that preferably contains some moisturizer as to hydrate your skin from the get go. Next, moisturize with the aforementioned hydrating moisturizer. Since your skin is dry, you may find it to be constantly dry throughout the day. You could opt to bring your moisturizer with you to reapply throughout the day or just look for a new one that can suffice your needs.<br>  <br>  Normal skin - This means that your skin is not too oily, not too dry. Just about in the middle. This means you can use regular cleansers and moisturizers targeted directly at people with normal skin. Use cleanser and moisturizer twice a day, although you can reapply moisturizer throughout the day if needed.<br>  <br>  Sensitive skin - This particular skin type means your skin is extremely aware of the products you apply to it and reacts in ways that are unpleasant, for example: rashes, itching, spots, acne, and others. You must heed to your skin's needs and purchase products that are targeted to the sensitive skin demographic. Similar to all the other routines, cleanse and moisturize twice a day with the accurate products.<br>  <br>  Aside from your regular routine, it's good to give your skin a little R&R once in a while with masks (e.g. asprin masks, exfoliating masks). However, these are usually intensive and must be used infrequently to achieve desired results as frequent use can cause irritation or the fact that your skin will get used to it and the effect will disappear. <br>  <br>  And don't forget sunscreen! I recommend at least SPF 30 (most people say SPF 15, but thats definitely not enough). UV rays cause cancer as well as spots and freckles and are extremely harmful to skin!<br>  <br>  EXFOLIATE once a week in the mornings to get rid of your skins topmost layer (which is mostly dead cells) for a fresh new palette. The exfoliation should happen after your clean your face and before you moisturize. A good exfoliate is St. Ives Apricot Scrub that many people are recommending and I myself have had a good relationship with (it smells absolutely delicious). Also, I recommend you go on Youtube and search up MichellePhan . She has beautiful, flawless skin and has great tutorials on how to achieve it. <br>  <br>  And lastly, you must eat healthy and sleep! I know it sounds simple and is nothing new to you but it is imperative if you want flawless skin. 8-10 hours a day with the recommended food groups consumed along with these routines and methods should pave a great path for you for the future. The earlier you start your skin maintenance, the better you are prepared for wrinkles. In fact, these processes help slow down the aging process.<br>  <br>  I really hope this has helped! I wish you the best of luck on your path to great skin!|`|4cd2c7649e1949de04b5f7bdd1c51814aa	I highly recommend  Oil of Olay Complete. It comes in a white box & has a formula just right for your skin type. I buy it at Wal*Mart & it's not real expensive. It lasts a long time because a little bit goes a long way. I put it on my face after I wash it, before applying a foundation, & again before bedtime. It's not greasy, smells good, & makes the skin feel so soft.|`|AA12064281	I would go to a store that carries dermalogica. <br>  You can ask them just  to be sure. But active moist would probably work well for you.|`|Q4D48Sdvaa	For a mositurizer I like the biore moisturizer, you can find it at a drugstore and has an SPF of 15 to protect your skin from the sun and keep from damaging it and prevent aging. <br>  <br>  I would also suggest a tinted moisturizer during the day if you want to wear very little makeup. It moisturizes and hides blemishes and skin discoloration.|`|WSNNZ8zzaa	I highly recommend Kiehl's.  Any of their moisturizers!  I swear by that brand

qjaWgov8aa	Some cute stores to get pea coats at are Aritzia, TNA, Abercrombie & Fitch, Nordstrom, Nordstrom's BP(juniors). You can also try PacSun, American Eagle, and Hollister. I am obsessed with these and have em from Aritzia (2) so if you're looking for brightly colored ones, look here! If you're looking for something chic and cutting edge, but also neutral colored, check out H&M.<br>  Remember, they get kinda pricey so don't be surprised!! They're usually between 50 and 150 bucks.

gVS5gl4oaa	I'm not trying to be critical in a rude way, I'm sure you look at your face every day so you will know that I'm not just trying to be mean, just trying to be helpful.<br>  I agree, the bangs need to go. I think you should grow them out and if you have to pin them up until their longer, they make your face look too short for its shape. you have a very narrow jaw/chin and a brroad forehead, a heart shaped face, so you will want to add porportion, and although curls would do it, I think just with your beautiful features (I pay attention to bone structure and eye shapes mostly) you would want to have a long, almost romantic curl. Think miley cyrus's hair and how her hair curls.<br>  If you can pull that all togeather (but the color is too beautiful, glossy dark hair is a major DO) maybe try some extensions until you can grow yours out for the miley look, and you will be turnin some heads!!!|`|Hszh97y7aa	you're really pretty.<br>  i dont see much you should change.<br>  your hair really fits you. ;]<br>  gorgeous girl<br>  but if you want to change it try to curl it a little bit.<br>  hope i helped.|`|uIW16Rf8aa	your pretty and your hair is good already but maybe some high lights and put some curls <br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AuPlnfuIsDM4afhhEqMxeI3sy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090307210101AAbHwsL">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|0lHSFxsgaa	get a semi perm thing<br>  when its really wavy|`|Di50QbPTaa	try curling it and nice boobs|`|2iB5erd9aa	not much u can do|`|3YsvIXZ1aa	your hair looks dead and fried but utherwiste your a 8-9|`|eDAX46b9aa	I bet it would look really good wavy or curly.

6Q6m0MoHaa	I think Revlon Colorstay is WAY better than studio fix fluid. Studio Fix Fluid gets a lot more cakey and it comes off easier. And if you sweat or anything it looks weird become some comes off and gets all blotchy. It caused me to break out.<br>  <br>  When i use revlon colorstay its never been cakey. Well actually the first time i used it, it was a little cakey because i put too much on. You don't need a lot of this stuff. Plus it never rubs off and it provides more coverage for me.<br>  <br>  But everyone is different and even though Mac has more colors, none of them matched me. After 3 years of Mac i gave up because wasn't anything special at least for me but then i tried revlon colorstay a couple months ago and i love it. Im surprised its a drugstore brand.<br>  <br>  The studio fix powder is better i think its  the best powder foundation but it doesnt really provide enough coverage for me. But for all the mac liquid foundations and cream ones, they are just way to thick and cakey and take a long time to blend it in to look good.|`|5RjHESqyaa	yes, i swear by it!<br>  <br>  i happen to have Revlon's Colorstay Foundation as well and BOY DO I AGREE WITH YOU THAT IT FEELS HEAVY AND SMELLS REAL BAD! but overall a good recommendation for people who want something affordable and yet provides good coverage.<br>  <br>  MAC Studio Fix Liquid Foundation is a little pricey but it's amazing. apply it with brush #190 (very basic brush that's a must-have) or you don't want to just a regular foundation brush will do. not cakey at all, very smooth finish in fact.<br>  <br>  unfortunately it's known to cause massive break outs cause of certain ingredients they use. doesn't happen to every one of course but just be careful:)<br>  <br>  otherwise, it's one of the best foundations in my opinion<br>  <br>  <br>  hope that helped hun xx|`|AA12064281	MAC Studio sculpt is cakey if you don't apply it right.<br>  Studio Fix fluid isn't. Ive been using it for years.|`|NamkzJEFaa	yup, gives great coverage|`|AA10964869	Revlon Colorstay foundation and MAC Studio fix fluid is pretty much the same foundation. MAC Studio fix fluid is like painting 5 layers of paint on your face. It can look really cakey and it also clogs pores. It broke me out the day I used that foundation. It's one of the worst foundations I ever used in my life! <br>  My most favorite foundation ever is Make Up For Ever HD Foundation. It gives full coverage but looks and feels sheer on your face. I know, how awesome is that!<br>  <br>  Good Luck! =)|`|1A1ozEaKaa	YES OMG.<br>  it was a bit expensive, and teh firts time, teh stupid girl ruined teh colour >_> but it wokrs so well, like i hoenstly can't see where my skin starts an dthe makeup ends...it's way better than colorstay and smells liek nothing, ut you have to aply a THIN layer or it feels weird. like once i put on a regular amount, and it felt heavy..you know atht feeling? but the next time, i applied  half of what i usually do, and it works :)<br>  <br>  good luck :D|`|fsrLp3HMaa	mac is way better.<br>  revlon colorstay sets in too quickly.
QLt147Hbaa	How long is your hair now?<br>  <br>  Just use a ruler and then measure from your current length to about your sholders (according to the picture) then multiply the amount of inches by 2. That's about how many months it would take if your hair grew ~1/2 inch a month.|`|BAXwTEAvaa	it depends on how fast your hair grows some grow fast and some grow slow.

EzMbBAClaa	Ugh I know! So many people overdo it and it never looks natural. If you look at totally natural straight hair it does have a slight wave in it, otherwise it would just look a bit odd. And the amount of damage people do... eek.|`|hJTvbbKnaa	i dont know staright hair just looks better. :]<br>  ive always had straight hair. and staright hair looks good on almost everyone<br>  its like asking why did people in the 80's perm their hair all the time|`|dt2Vl76Gaa	Although I love my curly hair, I get tired of it and I get told that straight hair looks good on me by many. I wish I could go back and forth easily, but it's hard. My hair is not cooperative and will not stay straight without a fight. So...I need to learn to embrace my curls, I just want straight hair so badly! But I'm hoping for the day when super natural curls and waves are the norm and straight hair is an old trend. It would be so much easier for me!|`|AA10774810	I'm not a teen, but I flat iron my hair.  It looks cleaner, healthier.  Also, it only takes 5 minutes, not 2 hours.  I think it looks better than the weird wavy hair that's not quite curly enough to be cute, and its a fraction of the time it takes to blow dry it straight.|`|84bfe623838974188db70f3e01e4ea29aa	you arent a girl..so you dont necessarily know what every girl looks like in the morning. i know what my hair looks like if nothing is done to it...|`|c6oobrlAaa	I dont know, I straighten my hair almost everyday.

(dammit!)|`|8iB4EcxTaa	I learned a lesson about one week ago. For the past year, I have straightned my hair everyday. It was hard. Last Friday, I was getting ready for school and woke up late. I turned the straightner on high and put my hair up in a ponytail. Then, i straightned my bangs. Half of my bangs fell off! I'm done with that phase.<br>  <br>  <br>  To answer your question, we straighten it because we like the way it looks.(Well duh). I mean it just looks neat and makes us look and feel better for some freaky reason. If you really want to know look at a before and after pic of a girl with curly to straight hair. You will understand.|`|xhJIXseNaa	I have curly hair and flat iron it straight.  For years I've been battling the curls.  Curly hair is frizzy and unruly.  It gets so knotted up that you can't run your fingers through it.  The curls expand outwards instead of down, making your head look like a big ball of curls.  There's lots of hair products out there, but all they do is make your hair sticky and make your scalp itch.|`|UdICTUnaaa	well the flat iron is no fad... people have been hot ironing their hair since the middle ages... i think queen victoria had a flat iron<br>  <br>  i have naturally curly hair and i hated it for most of my life. but one day i just realized that this is how it is... i gotta live with it, and make the best of it|`|AA11969873	Yes.. i just recently stopped straightening my hair.. its terrible and damages your hair badly.. curly hair is beautiful.|`|GdgHSFY4aa	yaa. maybe its because if they dont straighten it it kind of looks messy... lots of people now days straighten their hair... including the poofing/ratting to make your hair look more volumeous.. and both f those things ruin your hair.. thats why i wonder how those people who look like their hair is perfect and shiny keep it that way because at the same time they poof it and straighten it... nd i have the type of hair that is wavy.. but its not a gorgeous wave plus i have semi-longish short hair so i cant just leave it down and not straighten it.. thats why im trying to grow my hair out so i can .... I personally think curly hair is gorgeous.. i have always wanted to have semi-curly hair... but i was stuck with the ugly wave.. ugh... and if you haev curly hir you can straighten it.. and if you want just not straighten it and leave it curly.. but the bad thing of curly hair is i think it probly gets in the ay alot.. but thats just how it seems.. ut otherwise i love curly hair.. i wish i had curly hair! haha.. oh ya.. if you want to hear an intersting story here is one: <br>  when i went to girls camp over the summer last year.. it was the day we got to take a shower and clean up.. lots of the girls blow dried their hair and straightened it.. and i was thinking OMG come on this is your chance to let your hair go.. and be healthy for a change.. and its not like there are any boys around anyways.. i was just like whatever.. and threw my hair up in a bun.. haha.. usually if i were at home gettiong readty for school i would straighten my hair.. i agree with you about evryone straightening their hair now days.. haha.. <br>  <br>  even guys straighten their hair now days.. hahaa|`|wybTIqXVaa	I definitely understand what you're saying. I'm going to clarify something first so I don't seem hypocritical. I got my hair chemically straghtened a while back (twice in my life) because I had the world's frizziest hair. You could not walk close to me without sneezing from my puffy hair. So I got it chemically straightened. My hair has since grown straighter than before and I don't plan to straighten my hair again anytime soon. Just to clarify.<br>  Now, to answer your question, I completely agree with you. I just don't understand if when people who have naturally curly hair straighten their hair everyday. And these people who I am talking about have beautiful curls; some even have ringlets. I can't imagine how much TIME it's got to take to straighten all that hair. I don't see the point. And then, once it gets wet, it's done for. AND you're right, it totally fries your hair. It's stupid and sad. And then there are the people with straight hair who think they need to straighten their hair. Sad, really.<br>  <br>  Edit:<br>  For those of your out there who enjoy straightening your hair everyday, I'm just wondering if you realize just how damaging it is to your hair...? <br>  And also, those of you with lovely curls, why do you straighten your hair? No offense, but half the time, if your hair is curly, when you straighten it, it just looks frizzy.|`|g4G9N2aiaa	I don't know haha<br>  I straighten my hair every once in a while, not every day but maybe every three days.<br>  But my hair's annoyingly half wavy, half straight and it's all uneven curls...it looks stupid!<br>  Us girls just like straight hair better I guess!<br>  And anyways, girls with straight hair want it curly and those with curly seem to want it straight!|`|KJBuqXf9aa	hey well i just happen to be a girl and i pretty much straighten (flat iron) my hair everyday.<br>  Same with all of my friends. <br>  Im not so specific on why but if one girl does it the other does and it just goes on ect. <br>  Thats how we get todays fashions,<br>  well plus it doesnt get frizzy!|`|B3bKR3x1aa	Haha, I noticed that as well.  I have no clue why they do it, I mean my hair has always been very straight but I still think curly hair is sooo beautiful so I have no clue why they would want to hide that.  I have tried everything to get my hair to curl.. and failed every time.
wRsSodTAaa	It frames the nails better if there isn't thick or ragged cuticles.  Also, cuticles can grow onto the nail plate an make the polish not last as long.  It looks more healthy and manicured to have the cuticles all nice and pretty. :-)|`|t4gjClN0aa	Well is what I do is push them back (easy way to make your nails look prepped and clean [: )<br>  <br>  then I cut off the exess that sticks up slightly because it just looks much cleaner.|`|2d2c8667a557c74f6ffcff7010ce1098aa	Most people think it looks better but I think the opposite, as long as they're left alone (not tore up like mine).|`|aKiuKWh5aa	Sometimes they get all nasty looking at stuff and you have nothing to do but cut them off.|`|IwQynLjtaa	Because it makes your fingers look nasty!|`|g5DOpdRDaa	It makes your nails look a lot cleaner, and nail polish goes on smoother and it looks more complete|`|BAXwTEAvaa	Because its excess skin|`|PgFGRVOyaa	so your nails look healthy .|`|Sxd0tXDwaa	um, so thier nails grow faster!
yMygExd9aa	Im afraid that if you had even silkier hair it might look greasy! Sometimes products do more damage then help. Any who there is a product that my hair stylist uses in my hair, also to lay the fly away hairs down, and its a serum. I am pretty sure that any of those could help...but then again like I had said before it might look greasy instead of silky. It might feel greasy too!|`|AA10052815	First a shampoo has surfectants in it, so it is going to wash out of your hair. Second conditioner might as well be like wax. You put it in your hair and when you rinse it out the residue gets left on your hair until the next time you wash it. Then the shampoo washes it off.<br>  If you want really nice shine, on my clients I would use Sexy Hair Concepts Shine Spray. DO NOT USE IT RIGHT AGAINST YOUR HEAD.. Use it like a mist it is a pump spray, just hold it about 12 inches from your head and pump alittle and then do the same on the other side. There really is not a shampoo that is good for your hair or conditioner that is good for your hair that will leave it shiny..|`|pce9POGZaa	I have DARK brown hair and its really silky too!<br>  I use Pantene conditioner after i shampoo with like ANY brand of  shampoo. its weird. pantenee is really good, i found it better than Tressemme.|`|87CJaxkuaa	any conditioner works great|`|NZ3rA9rlaa	bragging in disguise|`|o6tLojhlaa	what the heck boy!!! you already have silky hair. get over yourself. if your looking for more compliments, you should move.
VenYUtH6aa	heres a tip. buy them on ebay for about half the price. since aa is a wholesale shop too, companies buy their hoodies wholesale and sell them on ebay for like 20 to 25 bucks. I bought 3 on ebay for 60$ including all shipping.<br>  <br>  it may be harder to find the brighter colors as opposed to the more basic ones, but give it a shot. <br>  <br>  they are well worth it, the are way comfy and match with everything!<br>  <br>  good luck :)<br>  <br>  oh yeah, also if you buy on ebay just remember their sizes are unisex so if you normally wear a medium you probably want at most a small.|`|PYdWer6taa	You can get the same exact one on amazon for less than 30 dollars. <br>  <br>  They are very good quality and it's a trusted brand.

American Apparel is an amazing store but don't even waste your money when you can order a jacket like that from Soffe or something.<br>  I wouldn't do it. And how many times do you plan on wearing that?<br>  If you REALLY want it, I'd suggest looking around a little bit more for the same style but lower price. If nothing floats your boat, you can always go back and buy the AA one.|`|E4TQE4RVaa	Nope, I definitely don't think it's worth it.  I know it's just better to buy stuff from popular stores, but $45 is definitely too much for that plain sweatshirt.  You could find something extremely similar for much less, or you could always just wait for that one to go on sale if you REALLY want it.
UdICTUnaaa	do you have the big wax patches?  dont use a bunch of small facial wax patches, make sure they are for your legs<br>  grow your leg hair out for about 3 weeks to make sure its gonna stick well to the wax... warm the wax according to instructions<br>  apply to your legs and rub the strip towards the grain... rip it up fast against the grain<br>  you shouldnt have to shave for about 4 weeks...

That is the main part of the problem right there.  You know that, so why do you continue abusing your hair?  It's only YOU that can correct it, if you want.<br>  <br>  You need to put water back into the hair -- not oil, not wax -- but water. And you need to keep it there.  Find something with NaPCA in it.  Look for Nexxus or Focus21 products especially.|`|fYed2Crjaa	Invest in a a quality hair conditioner or hair masque. Don't wash your hair everyday and my miracle product is CHI silk infusion. It makes your hair amazingly silky and my hair gets really dry from time to time, but this is an amazing product. I use it on damp hair after every shower.|`|vhXbGB8naa	Don't shampoo your hair everyday.<br>  Buy a deep conditioner that is labeled "for over-processed overly dyed hair" or "extremely dry" or something along those lines. <br>  You can also try home hair masks, like putting eggs and mayo in your hair and letting it sit for 20 minutes.|`|NYJgiVxraa	i use this: dove shine therapy, for lacklustre dry/dull hair shampoo & conditoner. works great in mine! it is sold at shoppers too. try it out.|`|WnjjTvCPaa	the herbal essencess moisutre shampoo. works like a chaarm !|`|Qds6RXKoaa	a daily conditioner is not gonna work. for one daily shampoos & conditioners need to be acid balanced with a Ph range of 4.5 -5.5. if not they will dry out your hair. c b smoothe triple silk will work. promise. i use it every day in a salon. i have included a link to the product & you can find this in a beauty supply store just call around & ask who carries it first. also you can go get a good shampoo & deep conditioning treatment & your local cosmetology school dirt cheap & even get it styled. the school i attended it cost less than $5 & still does. i know people think student on thier head & go o no but seriously what harm can a shampoo & conditioning treatment do? they also use only professional products.|`|CsGj2DIaaa	Head and shoulders is really good! If u decide to buy it, start off using it 2-3 times a week. good luck.<br>  <br>  I also heard that shampooin it every day dries your hair out, it depends on the type of hair i guess.. idk if its true but it makes sense to me though...lol
ISLi7DF7aa	What a ugly ***** is she from Brasil?|`|YLgdMXiQaa	Yea she looks pretty much younger..|`|xqQO81Omaa	First of all I hope she said it was okay to post her pics.<br>  <br>  But I think she does look really really good for her age, so definitely looks younger than 58. In the first pic I think she could pass for late 30's or early 40's and the second pic late 40's or early 50's. That said with the right hair cut and colour she could pass for even younger!<br>  <br>  And please don't take this the wrong way, but I think she should get that mole on her arm checked out just to be on the safe side.|`|QQdOpG2xaa	she looks like she's only 50!|`|7AFLaiYjaa	i think she's trying to make herself look younger.

lbX75d1xaa	Bleach them and do not pluck any more!  The ones you plucked will probably start growing back heavier weight and darker, so do not do any more! Bleach costs less than 10 dollars at any drug store.  Just bleach them, it will take 10 minutes and you will be fine.<br>  <br>  I am just talking about Jolen or Sally Hansen facial bleach that you can find at any drug store or even at the grocery store.|`|jdZfzZUjaa	Shave it off. And if the dye is on your skin then go here: <a href="http://www.thriftyfun.com/tf415317.tip.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.thriftyfun.com/tf415317.tip.h...</a>|`|tQBbrU5Laa	you can't buy hair bleach unless you have a license, for cosmetology. tried it before.<br>  <br>  and if you ever dye it again, wipe it off before it dries.|`|4fL1PWwmaa	Bleaching would be your best bet. They sell products made for bleaching facial hair, arm hair, etc. <br>  Just take a trip to your local drugstore. You'll find them in the area that you'd find products such a Nair and Veet.
bfhsP4GFaa	Go to a department store in your mall such as Sears or The Bay. I got my prom makeup done at Sears for free (it's your choice to tip them).<br>  <br>  Concealer covers imperfects like pimples and foundation evens out you skin tone. I suggest using Annabelle Shimmer Dust in Mint and Ice, apply to the corners of your eyelids and blend. Use one layer of black mascara , no eyeliner. And maybe put some light, nude coloured lipstick on with clear gloss over top. I also think cranberry coloured lips would look great with a pale dress and natural eyes.|`|Rj08Nzv9aa	go to sears or macy's and get it done free or go to this store madee and they have makeup kits that are about $15-$7 and they have instuctions so you can learn how to do it yourself|`|6ESUnzQjaa	I would try MAC they have really pretty make up,and also crazy make up! if your going for the more natural look there is a kind there that is kinda pinky, but kinda brownish- not ugly brown lol. It would look good with that color dress, and style. I am not sure how much it cost, but if you ask for them to do your make up just tell them what you are going for and that should work. <br>  Hope you have a great prom!!!!

AA12350023	yes. my hair is auborn to darkish brown.. even blackish with red highlights at times.. <br>  and I used henna to color my grey..<br>  I definately notice the solid grey and black growing in in about 2 weeks.. its just like normal hair color, your roots will show in new growth.|`|VvD3UTXgaa	If you get a quality henna product then you shouldn't really notice your roots for about 4 to 6 weeks.  You can do the first application all over and then just do root touch ups when needed.  I do my hair every 8-9 weeks and just love it.  With the chemical dyes i would have to do it every 4 weeks otherwise i would have a skunk strip and that's not pretty.  I get my henna products from Henna Hut.  Heres a link
pzfTCjqyaa	Hey Carina!<br>  Hmmm...It's difficult to define beauty because it's pretty much all a matter of opinion.  But I think that beauty is not what anyone sees on the outside, it's what's on the inside.  If you are a nice, good person and have self confidence, I think that is much prettier than a model who can't break up with her boyfriend because she has no self- confidence and is a terrible person.  I mean, look at Rihanna.  She's SO pretty, but she got back together with Chris Brown because she has no self confidence.  If you have a great personality and self confidence but you're not so great looking, people will be able to look past the looks and see what truly lies beneath (and if they can't, who needs them anyway, right?) haha I'm rambling but, yeah, that's what I think beauty is :).|`|QodBCFL6aa	I would love to say i think it's about a person and who the person is inside, but to be truthful in modern day society the nicest person in the world could have a 'scary look' and some people would go nowhere near them.. i really think it has something to do with looks personally, or maybe i'm just caught up in the world of materialism?<br>  im not sure(:<br>  xox|`|9a8ad2bd74ef14daf7f98aee3567f253aa	something that is pleasant to look at for hours at a time<br>  =]|`|pfJorlTIaa	Inner beauty ~~first.<br>  Then how well you take care of yourself ~~last.|`|jWKg7fzTaa	pretty on the inside and out! <br>  a bad character can kill the perception of beauty|`|b1YBR9Pcaa	beauty is your personality but really its all in opinions|`|A6dpeGUtaa	Short, skinny and feminine girls.|`|0lHSFxsgaa	boring.|`|CKpxVeucaa	personality and little bit of looks|`|MVcvIiiaaa	My favorite saying when it comes to this question is: <br>  <br>  Beauty gets the attention, personality gets the heart.<br>  <br>  A guy or a girl can be the most strikingly gorgeous person you have ever seen but if they have a mean, condesending, superficial soul- their looks cannot make up for it. They make it hard to be around and in the end, they become ugly to look at.|`|7nrhPCf0aa	personality & some natural good features<br>  mine?<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AmbyfK3PMI9l9MEz6nls3KLsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090307132056AAkrnUs">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>

jez0O0bXaa	Just get a partial highlight. They can use a highlift blonde dye not bleach.  Only from your ear line up is done leaving the lower part of your hair natural and it will give you a sunkissed look. Just have them do light not heavy highlights.|`|PtSeJXnEaa	sun in will turn your hair red/orange. just mix some lemon juice and water in a spray bottle then spend some time outside.|`|WvHGtQhBaa	go to your stylist and ask for really thin highlights, that aren't on the first layer of your hair.<br>  she should know what you're talking about. <br>  it will look natural, and won't show the growth much|`|2d2c8667a557c74f6ffcff7010ce1098aa	I agree with the others that highlights would make it look like you spend time in the sun. As long as it's not drastic, you wouldn't need to keep doing it or change it all back. Because you want so little of a change you can choose either bleach or blonde dye.

2inq4zHZaa	Like the other person said, you should definitely try stretching in the shower, it's a good trick.  Do your thing in the shower for about ten minutes first, and then attempt stretching.  Just don't force it, if it doesn't want to go, it doesn't want to go.  Maybe you should try taping.  It's much more gradual.  Try using teflon tape and just add a small layer every few days, to go slow.  If you feel like you have to push really hard with your taper, then it is probably going to tear :(  What kind of taper are you using?  A lot of the acrylic ones are not very gradually and tear your ears up.  If that's what you are using than try  steel ones, they are usually a lot smoother and more gradual.  Tearing really sucks, and I'm sure you know the risks by now if you're already at 7/16'' so I will spare you the lecture, just take it easy on your ear, because too much pain is a bad sign.  Here's a link to a guide that is pretty useful, I have used it, and gotten good results, you might find some new info that could be useful to you.  Good luck, take it slow, hope it works out.  Happy stretching :)<br>  <br>  <a href="http://forums.bodyartforms.com/forums/t/5641.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://forums.bodyartforms.com/forums/t/...</a>|`|44RpLWb7aa	stretch your ears in the shower. i know it sounds weird but the warm water relaxes it and makes the ear easier to stretch. what i used to do was push them part of the way in every couple minutes.|`|Q4ai8CuCaa	How long has it been at 7/16 for?<br>  If it hurts its your body telling you to stop and take it slowly.<br>  Everyone has a different healing time/period/wait.<br>  Like the person above said; stretching in the shower does help because it relaxes the muscles and so on but if its hurting to the point where continuous pushing is only adding pain and pressure stop and leave it for another day when you're ears have healed completely and are ready for the next step.
POFdWpUzaa	Before you wash your hair, once or twice a week do this: <br>  <br>  Rub olive oil between your palms until it warms up then apply to the scalp and hair. First massage it into your scalp and then into your hair. You may need to use more than just the first bit, of course, depending on the length and thickness of your hair. Then wash your hair as you normally would. <br>  <br>  Another thing I do a couple of times a week is take a very small amount of olive oil, warm it up in my hands, apply it to my hair and brush my hair with a boar bristle brush. Do this while watching TV or reading answers on YA! I leave this oil in my hair overnight, wind my hair up since it is long, and wash in the morning. You can leave it in for any length of time, it wont hurt your hair. This is really only necessary to do if you have very dry hair/skin. It's a very good thing to do with naturally curly hair as our hair doesn't absorb things very quickly or easily.|`|xv3opX9Maa	yah just put it on your hair and put a shower cap on <br>  leave it for 20 minutes to an hour<br>  wash it out with a good clarifing shampoo <br>  ( =|`|4cd2c7649e1949de04b5f7bdd1c51814aa	No, it does nothing for the hair.

xjazE0xmaa	Actually, most diamonds acquire scratches over time with normal wear and tear.  All the people who say diamonds can't be scratched by anything are thinking about diamonds being cut--it takes a diamond to cut a diamond.  Please don't play around with scratching the stone.  It will not prove anything.  <br>  <br>  While the best answer comes from a trusted gemologist, here are some "at-home" tests you can try. I got them from an article "How Can You Spot a Fake Diamond" (link below).<br>  <br>  --Did any literature come with the diamond?  If so, look for the phrase “synthetic diamond.” While sometimes this phrase is mistakenly used for man-made diamonds, it usually indicates an inferior material is being substituted. <br>  <br>  --Look for scratches. While real diamonds acquire scratches, chips, dents, and the like over time, other materials show the wear and tear much faster. If you see visible scars, be on alert. And if you, a non-gemologist, can see visible scars on a natural diamond, expect the diamond to be priced much lower than Rapaport value. <br>  <br>  --Place the loose diamond over newsprint and attempt to read through the diamond. If you can read through the diamond, it is either a fake or a poor cut (“low cut”). <br>  <br>  --Breathe on the diamond just as you would to fog a window. If the fog remains more than two seconds, it’s likely a fake. Repeat the fog test on the bottom of the diamond; some fakes are crafted with a diamond surface and synthetic underside. <br>  <br>  --Place the stone under ultraviolet light, and watch for blue fluorescence. Medium to strong blue indicates a real diamond. If there is no blue fluorescence, either the diamond is of excellent quality or it is a fake. <br>  <br>  --Look inside the setting for any stamps. “CZ” indicates the stone is cubic zirconia. A stamp such as “10 K,” “14K,” “18K,” “585,” “750,” “900,” “950,” “PT,” and “Plat” describe a setting’s gold or platinum status. High-quality diamonds will be set in high-quality settings, not something gold plated or made of an inferior metal. Of course, a dishonest jeweler could set a fake stone in a high-quality setting—or could even stamp the setting to make it appear of higher quality than it really is. <br>  <br>  --Look with magnification at the stone. Facets should be joined with sharp lines, not rolls. The girdle should have facets; it should not be waxy or slick. Most diamonds have natural internal flaws; most fakes do not. <br>  <br>  --Moissanite, a popular diamond substitute, sparkles greatly in outdoor light but appears dull with incandescent lighting. <br>  <br>  --To keep costs low, fake gems are often machine cut, rather than hand crafted. Machine cut moissanite will not display the “hearts and arrows” seen in hand-cut, natural diamonds. <br>  <br>  --A jeweler may offer to prove a diamond is real by using his diamond tester. Be cautious, as moissanite will frequently fool a diamond tester—and a smart jeweler knows this. <br>  <br>  --When a cubic zirconia stone is submerged in water, the gemstone virtually disappears; a natural diamond is easily visible. The water enhances the two stones’ differences in light refraction. <br>  <br>  --Weigh the stone on a scale you trust. Cubic zirconia weighs approximately 55% more than diamond.<br>  <br>  Some of these are easier to try than others, but since you didn't mention whether the stone is in a setting or loose, I figured it better to include all of these.  As for the ultraviolet light test--if there's a party supply store nearby, they might have a blacklight (aka ultraviolet light) on display; one of the stores in our mall does, so that test was easier for me than I thought it would be.<br>  <br>  I hope these help.|`|3ece80164c2739cc39f908768c919b69aa	Cubic Zirconia can be scratched by emery cloth sandpaper the type that has silicone carbonide in the sand paper part.

wT6ZcHRyaa	Okay, first things first, if you put that much bleach on your black hair for a collective amount of 120 minutes, you absolutely need a conditioner. And if you're gonna leave anything in all night, it should be that. Also, I've never heard of anyone putting dye in their hair overnight. I mean, it's fine to put Manic Panic in overnight because you don't have to mix it with any damaging chemicals, but still, I've never heard of that. So here's what I recommend you do, in this order;<br>  <br>  1) Never bleach your hair again. Well, not for a few years anyway. And if you want to dye it back to brown, wait a while. Your hair is gonna be in horrible condition.<br>  2) When you want to bleach your roots, ONLY bleach the roots. Don't pull the bleach down through your previously bleached hair. This will cause a ridiculous amount of breakage, I promise you.<br>  3) Apply the Manic Panic dye to your bleached hair and leave it on for only 30-40 minutes. Putting it on overnight is excessive and unnecessary and it's just gonna make the pink darker than you want it. <br>  4) Go to your nearest beauty supply store and buy L'oreal Nature's Therapy Mega Moisture conditioner. (Make sure you've waited a few days after dying your hair pink before doing this, by the way.) Shampoo your hair at night. Don't condition it yet though. Comb through your hair and then apply the conditioner to your wet hair. Put on a plastic cap and then when you wake up in the morning, rinse out the conditioner. It will make your hair SO much healthier and it'll also make it feel nicer.<br>  <br>  Also, just as a side note, I highly recommend you use Special Effects brand dye as opposed to Manic Panic. I've had a lot of experience with Manic Panic, and it fades very quickly. I think the most I've seen Manic Panic's pink color last was a week and a half or so, and Special Effects' Atomic Pink lasts at LEAST a month. It really is a much better brand.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps you and good luck! :)|`|zlXofrG4aa	Manic Panic is a non-chemical dye, it's vegetable based, thus it's okay to leave in forever.  Not something I'd recommend and actually after about two hours it's not doing anything.  The depositing stops after it's had enough.  <br>  Btw manic panic is crap, get Special Effects Atomic Pink.  Atomic pink will go over orange hair, turn out hella pink, and stay for months and months and months until you decide to dye over or bleach out.|`|jez0O0bXaa	Maximum time bleach works is 1 hour. If you mix with 40 volume & add heat it will come up faster & lighter.  The pink will only work 30-45 minutes.  You probably have a lot of damage try Joico reconstuctor products, amazing!|`|oQ5oKILHaa	Manic Panic so sucks. I think its just little kid finger paint. Go ahead and leave it in. I don't think it is really dye just stains your hair.|`|FAAWwIQZaa	I wouldn't!! It most likely will either fry or completely damage your hair. I suggest taking a break for about a day, and then dying it the pink, and deep condition or do hot wax treatments every few days too keep your hair extra soft, because the bleach really strips all the natural oils out and makes your hair frizzy-er and dry.<br>  Good Luck!<br>  (:|`|kqTGQTfcaa	no no no! ur hair is prolly extremely damaged from bleaching it twice you should buy cholesterol conditioner you can find it any where and leave it on your hair for about a half hour itll re-moisturize your hair then you can dye it.. other wise your hair will prolly start to break off and itll give your hair a frizzy look to it.|`|CCRZfem0aa	Do not leave dye in your hair overnight.  I would wait a week or so before I touched it again.  Use lots of conditioner, and the black might turn the blond into green if you hair is really damaged.   Never leave any dye in your hair overnight!!!  Your hair might fall out in your sleep.|`|Q3lazu6Uaa	Honestly, I wouldn't Bleaching your hair takes all the natural oils out of your hair, especially when you do it 2+ times. I would wait a few days or so to put other dye in your hair.|`|4cd2c7649e1949de04b5f7bdd1c51814aa	NEVER leave hair color in overnight!!!!  Bleach is one of the worst things to use on your hair. Now, you want to color it & leave it on overnight? You need to let a pro do your hair before you end up with your hair falling out in gobs. Leave the bleach alone.|`|def913262af3ad74da15c66c2614ad09aa	yes manic panic is safe to leave in over night. to help avoid a big mess wrap your hair in saran, and sleep with a dark towel over your pillow.<br>  <br>  you're going to be so uncomfortable though!!!<br>  <br>  i know that most people prefer special fx (or close to that name) hair dye over manic panic. MP normally lasts about a week SFX normally lasts longer.
VGkyW5Mvaa	Unfortunately, community college alone isn't going to get you anywhere close to becoming a doctor. If going to a university isn't and option, maybe you could look into nursing?<br>  <br>  Nursing programs are offered at most community colleges, they make a good amount of money, and are very in demand right now.|`|aQRXXUcVaa	To become a doctor you have to get a four year degree and then get accepted into medical school. Starting off at a community college is not a bad thing its alot cheaper and you can get your gen eds out of the way. If this is something you really want to do then go for it no matter what anyone tells you. Don't ever let somebody tell you you can't! or put you down. Paying for college theres fafsa, loans, scholarships, grants, and/or working and with your G.P.A. you should be able to get some sort of scholarships and/or grants if not multiple scholarships/grants. If you can't go away to school are their universities close by to where you can drive, to get at least your bachelors? If so I would check into it.

Wait like a week or two before you tone it or dye it because it can cause serious damage. Good Luck!!|`|Q3lazu6Uaa	Honestly, I wouldn't buy bleach from Hot Topic.

PkDuKWfQaa	Although I am not a lolita, I do know some great sites for those who are interested in the fasion.  www.lolitafashion.org is a great site for the new and up and coming lolita.  It goes through the basic lolita questions, but also gives you additional information.  This site also has a very good brand shopping list, including stores with overseas shipping.  It also talks about shopping services incase the shop that you want to shop from doesn't ship overseas.<br>  <br>  And we all know about the EGL community at livejournal.  They can give you tons of advice about becoming a lolita.  They have a whole question and answer section to answer any other questions you had about being a lolita.<br>  <br>  I would personally only buy from namebrand stores, but there are some godd off brand stores like Jessie Kate mentioned.<br>  Some of my favorites are:<br>  Angelic Pretty<br>  Baby The Stars Shine Bright<br>  Metamorphose Temps de Fille<br>  <br>  Hope this helped and good luck!|`|NyyRuaVqaa	As far as stores go you should check out these.<br>  <br>  Anna House has the cheapest prices you'll find for good quality lolita clothing, (their prices are in Hong Kong dollars, don't let it confuse you) and it's not to hard to order. <a href="http://www.annahousefashion.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.annahousefashion.com</a><br>  <br>  If you'd prefer to order from somewhere in the country, (because of shipping prices or anything like that) In the Starlight would be a nice choice. <a href="http://www.inthestarlight.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.inthestarlight.com</a><br>  <br>  If you don't care so much about the prices, you should check out Baby, the Stars Shine Bright. They're definitely my favorite store. <a href="http://www.babyssb.co.jp" rel="nofollow">http://www.babyssb.co.jp</a><br>  <br>  As far as tips, make sure you join a lolita community.

Hot Topic sells clip ins and maybe you can play around with the position to get a better idea before you commit to the hair coloring.<br>  <br>  If you're going permanent with the hair dye I recommend a stylist instead of doing it yourself. Your hair is dark and it will take stripping that can really damage your hair even with only highlights put in it.|`|nVeGysnSaa	Put chunky ones not thin ones. Put 2 big purple on the side and 2 big pink then do the same on the other side and then like 3 big ones on the back.|`|KyShUk8kaa	Grow up and get real hair.|`|ae2bcecb00f1a2a0a37a6557f7ffdf3baa	You should put them on the under side of your hair, like a peek a boo style, but make sure they're streaks and you don't die your whole underside pink/purple! You should make thin streaks of pink and purple next to each other so they kind of blend together. Also put them on the very front of your bangs and one on the same side of your bangs but on the top layer, as opposed to underneath.

I never have actually owned a pair of high heels, only tried them on in the store. When I attempted to walk a few steps in them, I realized that they were the most painful, torturous thing that an individual could possibly walk on. The worst part? Women pay shoe manufacturers to wear those awful things! <br>  <br>  I think with so many fashionable dress shoes on the market this day and age, that it is possible to go your entire life without giving into the need to own high heels. As for myself, I will save my feet the pain of wearing high heels, and save my body from the long term damage that wearing high heels can cause to your feet, legs, and muscles.|`|pHTSL3Ylaa	never has a problem i wear 5" heels veryday|`|TaZvxS7Saa	I walk around in the store with the heels on. Not that it gives you an exact feeling of what it's going to be like walking with them all day long, but it gives a good idea as to whether I'm able to walk with them. Btw, I would tell your girlfriend to stop with the 5+ inch heels, that's a back problem waiting to happen in the near future. Heels can cause health problems.|`|XzsmYWOqaa	All high heels always hurt.  That's the price of beauty, it is painful to look gorgeous.|`|eyGAytOTaa	I agree with Eva. We still wear it!

And, I heels have worn heels without breaking them in- won't do that again!! and, I am barely 5 foot tall so all my heels are too high for me!!<br>  <br>  Tell your friend if she is dead set on wearing shoes like that, break them in first! I will buy a pair and wear them around my house a few times- load the dishwasher in them a few times, walk up a flight of stairs in them every day for a week- something like that. don't just put them on and expect to walk on clouds all day. <br>  <br>  Heels take tolerance- and some can't take the pain. I have worn heels religiously for 10 years now- I give birth in 2 weeks and still wear heels. And I own a pair of heels that are broke in and still hurt my feet. Some people can't handle it and some can. if she isn't used to the height, she should have bought something shorter, or with a large stacked heel for more support.|`|lGmyFOxiaa	Most women take time to get used to walking in any kind of heel and the higher they are the worse it is. Heels will always hurt or make your feet sore it just takes conditioning to adjust to it. Humans weren't made to hold their weight that way naturally. It just happens to a fashion trend some of us love. I personally can't wear them because of it.|`|XWDNzHe7aa	I will wear any heel that is adorable no matter what the pain factor!

7e4ddd94a48b83b020e18be38365a0baaa	Hi Ashley. Don't be discouraged about your hair.  I press my hair too, and I didn't see a real difference in hair growth until I changed my hair products and my hair care techniques. Visit my blog at <a href="http://ofranklin.wordpress.com" rel="nofollow">http://ofranklin.wordpress.com</a> and read the posts about hair pressing.  To get your hair to grow longer you need to use products that don't dry your hair out and make it brittle.  Products made from natural, gentle ingredients are best. Avoid products made with mineral oil, petrolatum, and sodium lauryl sulfate. These will dry out your hair.  Instead of using a petrolatum or mineral oil based grease, use a pomade or a hair oil made from natural ingredients. You need to also make sure that you are not using too much heat on your hair.  Pressing is fine in moderation, but too much of it (either doing it too frequently or at too high of a temperature) can cause hair damage.|`|ksh8xBO3aa	You're already ahead of the game because you don't have any chemicals in your hair will could lead to damage.  <br>  I would suggest going to a qualified technician and getting your ends trimmed.  Keeping the damaged ends only leads to them splitting further and your hair will never grow.<br>  Because of the texture of African American hair, you have to be extremely careful with it.  <br>  Here's a basic regime to follow:<br>  <br>  Once a week, wash your hair.  Only use a small amount of shampoo and wash just your scalp and your roots.  Using shampoo on the ends of your hair tends to dry them out.<br>  After rinsing, gently blot your hair dry with a towel.  DO NOT rub the towel all over your head.  This leads to breakage.  Wrap parts of your hair in the towel and squeeze the water out.<br>  Pick a nice, salon quality conditioner (one used for deep conditioning) and apply it to your hair section by section.  Be sure to condition the ends well.  The ends of your hair are the oldest parts so they need the most care.  Take a WIDE TOOTH COMB and gently comb your hair out.  Your hair is most vulnerable when it's wet so please BE CAREFUL.  Cover your hair with a plastic shower cap and sit under a hooded dryer for 15-20 minutes.  If you don't have a hooded dryer, you can take a warm towel and wrap your plastic capped head in it.  Your body heat will help the conditioner penetrate the hair shaft.<br>  After deep conditioning, rinse the conditioner from your hair.<br>  <br>  Since you are trying to grow your hair, you should try to use as little heat as possible.  I suggest doing roller sets and wrapping your hair.<br>  <br>  To do a roller set, you want to use plastic rollers.  Use water and setting lotion to saturate your hair (sopping wet) and gently roll your entire head.  You'll look crazy, so be warned!  LOL  Once all your hair is in rollers, you should sit under a hooded dryer for about an hour or so, depending on the length of your hair.  Don't take the rollers out until your hair is fully dry.<br>  Once dry, you should have a head full of soft curls.  <br>  At this point, you can wrap your hair.  Using a paddle brush wrap your hair around your head in sections.  Front right section, back right section, back left section, front left section.  Use can use bobby pins or clips to secure any sections that aren't quite secure.<br>  Use a silk scarf or headwrap and wrap it around your head.  To protect your hair, you will want to wrap it every night or AT THE VERY LEAST buy silk or satin pillowcases to sleep on.  I would really suggest wrapping it every night though.  Not only does it protect your hair but it saves time and effort on styling the next day.<br>  <br>  When you are ready to unwrap your hair, simply remove the scarf and the pins or clips.  Use the paddle brush to gently brush your hair down.  You should have shiny, bouncy hair.  <br>  Continue to wrap your hair every night and wear your hair up a few days a week to protect it from rubbing against your clothing and/or jewelry.  That can also damage your hair.<br>  <br>  I hope all this helps!  Good luck!<br>  <br>  P.S.  Try using Google to find some A.A. hair care forums.  There are tons out there.

Its really popular and looks very smart and fashionable for such a classic look!  Oh, and it doesn't really need to be any specific type of shirt, but one with fashion sleeves (e.g. puff) or 3/4 length sleeves and split ends looks good.  <br>  <br>  I wouldn't recommend wearing a dress like that without a blouse or shirt under - it'd look a bit silly, particularly at school :-) It could work with a polo shirt, don't think it'd look at nice though.<br>  <br>  This style also looks great accessorised with a waist band belt to match the rest of the uniform (easily removed if it offends the school) ;)|`|mcomAA2eaa	If you're 5 then yes !<br>  <br>  If not then no.|`|ZmU6ZNhBaa	white blouse underneath it.|`|kPmzj4Rcaa	underneath would be cute.<br>  but you could also wear one over, if it goes up the the line bit - cause then it would look just like a top and skirt, and you're uniforms so cute! <br>  i wish mine was like that, so jealous [; ?|`|qSQZD6Obaa	Yes, underneath would look so cute.

oE0ApHqPaa	Do you have any experience sewing?  Corsets or corset style tops can be pretty challenging.  I'm not trying to discourage you from trying, I experiment all the time, but don't let yourself get too frustrated when you do it!<br>  <br>  You need to check out Craftster.  They are my favorite craft website.  They have lots of step by step tutorials for all sorts of stuff, so you can probably find what you need.  <br>  <br>  I would suggest starting with a pattern from the fabric store (measure yourself first because the sizes on the pattern envelope are not always the same as store size, so know your bust, waist, and hip measurements).  If you are inexperienced, go for things that says "easy" or "beginner" on the envelope.  You can always modify the pattern at home to be exactly what you need.  I have had some luck with that style top looking in the prom dress section.  Look for either a two piece dress or just use the bodice section of a full length dress pattern.|`|su2FBS9Gaa	making a corset would be a little(pretty much) difficult<br>  cause its made of a special material which is probably not available that easliy...so its better if you buy on instead from some designer shop...or from anywhere but if you still wanna make one then i think you should refer to this site----><br>  <a href="http://www.elizabethancostume.net/corsets/materials.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.elizabethancostume.net/corset...</a><br>  plus! do you like fashion designing or something like that?? =)<br>  me too!....ok apart from that....why don't you try making something easier than a corset like a sun dress...or fancy shorts....or a Shirt...|`|RGItl14yaa	Why don't you just buy one...|`|aa35e095a615d2c9fa9251d229a3968aaa	The corset top looks like it has a high lycra content and is also boned.

It does not require the upscale hair products hawked by salons, handfuls of expensive vitamins, or any sort of sacrifice to the long hair gods. What it does take is common sense, dedication, and a lot of patience. Indeed, growing long hair is actually more a question of what you shouldn't do rather than what you should!<br>  . The first step to growing long, beautiful hair is by far the most important. It is absolutely non negotiable for anyone who wants healthy hair at any length, but it is also by far the hardest step you will have to follow. In order to have long healthy hair you absolutely have to start with healthy hair. You must cut off every inch that is considerably damaged. If you are going for extreme length, from that point on you will have to treat your hair like delicate, antique lace at all times.Never put your hair in any kind of style that will put undue stress on the individual hairs... no tiny braids, no extremely tight coils. If you pull all or some of your hair into a braid or a ponytail to create your hairstyle, make sure it isn't pulled tight enough to put stress on the roots of your hair. Pulling hair tight repeatedly commonly results in bald patches! If you go after the long hair "quick fix" and put extensions in your hair, be forewarned that your own hair will likely be significantly more damaged when they are removed than it was to begin with. Dreads almost always have to be cut off to be removed and are tremendously damaging to hair.|`|FLWuVKWnaa	Don't dye it! I made that mistake and I've been dye free for about 7 months now.

dQYU6bbjaa	(A) I suggest you start with the basics:<br>  <br>  1.Clean ,tone and moisturize your face.<br>  <br>  2.use sunscreen daily and moisturizer where you need it( dry joints or hands.)<br>  <br>  3.use chap stick when needed<br>  <br>  4.use deodorant daily and after you sweat<br>  <br>  5.put perfume on in the morning<br>  <br>  6.wash and slowly blow dry your hair every other day. Using the right shampoo/conditioner combo. dry, died, oily or normal hair.<br>  <br>  7.wax/shave/pluck/trim when needed, depends <br>  on your hair growth about every 2-3 weeks or once a week.<br>  <br>  8. Important to exercise a minimum of 20 mins of walking every other day.<br>  <br>  (B)If you want more you can:<br>  <br>  1. wear light makeup daily, a bit of foundation under dark circles, a bit of gloss and mascara or eye liner.<br>  <br>  2. Have your nails done once or twice a month. (If you don't like having nails just keep your hands and nails very clean, even if you bite them.)A Pedicure once a month makes you feel great too!<br>  <br>  3. You can style you hair daily(If you like your doings) or visit a hair salon twice a week.<br>  <br>  4. Get a full body spa treatment once a month.<br>  <br>  5. If you want to dye your hair or give it highlights and lowlights, visit a hair salon and visit once a month to maintain it.<br>  <br>  6. If you want to exercise more, you can walk 20 mins daily or 30 mins of any simple work-out tape should do the trick.(no need for expensive gym memberships) Just remeber to always stretch before and after you exercise.<br>  <br>  7. Remember to drink lots of water and introduce more fruit and vegetables into your diet.(your skin and hair will glow and you will have more energy)<br>  <br>  (C) If you are going out:<br>  <br>  1. Give yourself time to get ready from 1h-2hrs. Shower, use perfume and deo. Pluck yur face if needed and choose yor clothes before you shower.<br>  <br>  2. You can fix your hair after you shower or visit a salon. Make sure to put on makeup after you hair is finished.<br>  <br>  <br>  3. Use heavier make-up for night-time if you like. Use foundation all-over, blush and either eyeliner/mascara and eyeshadow with chapstick or lipstick/ mascara. Don't overdo both your eyes and lips. it always looks harsh.<br>  <br>  4. Always make sure you look good from behind too. That you haven't stepped in anything or their is none of your hair on your clothes. None of your clothes are stained or ripped somwhere you can't see.<br>  <br>  P.s. Always brush your teeth 2-3 times daily and carry minty or icy breathmints to eliminate any unpleasant smells. Not fruity ones b/c they mix with other smells. Which becomes more unpleasant.<br>   <br>  Darn ,this is a long-butted answer.

You just looked tired :) <br>  <br>  You've got amazingly clear skin, so when it comes to make up less is definately more for you. Go for a mineral make-up.

Only get what you feel comfortable with, not what the sales assistant is trying to force onto you. <br>  <br>  Clothes wise, sorry I'm from Australia so can't help you out with stores, but go for some jeans in a darker shade with a straight leg, get some pretty cami's and colorful tank tops you can layer and maybe a couple of pairs of cute ballet flats. <br>  <br>  I like your hairstyle (down) maybe go a darker more rich brown though?

And have fun shopping!|`|6HP348pAaa	For your hair, just get some headbands, all kinds of colors to go with any outfit,example:<br>  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/rebbecca_ro/2482564984/" rel="nofollow">http://www.flickr.com/photos/rebbecca_ro...</a><br>  <br>  For clothes,it depends what temperature it is for you, but here is some outfits.Jeans:<br>  <a href="http://www.lasplash.com/uploads/1/skinny_jeans_1.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.lasplash.com/uploads/1/skinny...</a><br>  <br>  Shirts:<br>  <a href="http://www.abercrombiekids.com/kids/onlinestore/collection/14466_01_d.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.abercrombiekids.com/kids/onli...</a><br>  <br>  (Abercrombie shirts.

I Love the full Lips!  A pink gloss should make your smile (that's a hint) Light up the room.  Nice hair, and I Love the dual beauty marks!  How exotic!  Beautiful eyes, too.  We of the not too tall variety will feel sleeker in darker clothes.  Jeans that hug the bod + thighs but flare below the knee are always flattering.<br>  Use geometrics to define your figure: use angles to your advantage, a v-neck top draws the eye up to your neck + face.  And have fun with the Lace + sequins so abundant now!  Most dry cleaners will hem jeans if you find some that fit great, but are too Long.<br>  And don't forget your attitude can be your best attribute!|`|SpwWW7vYaa	i think your not ugly. For hair just get some side bands and maybe dye your hair alittle darker. For makeup just wear alittle eye liner and mascara and blush. some lip gloss. For style just dress casual and cute. Wear some nice dark jeans and buy a nice jacket. just wear clothes you like. Just don't try and dress like someone your not.

You never know where your career will take you!<br>  <br>  Shoulder, foot, ankle... somewhere like that.<br>  <br>  Print out the peace sign you want and take it to the artist. Or, if you can explain it good enough, any good artist can draw it up like that.<br>  <br>  Have fun with your new ink! :)|`|ggfE4rlvaa	If it's just little get it on the back of your neck.

Since you're "not old enough" yet, do NOT get any tattoos, especially something like that.|`|E01GXmQeaa	of course you can... just make sure the artist is good and can do realistic. this is something that if you screw it up it's gonna look like someone drew on you with a pen. but i definitely like the idea. i'd play around with it some, give it a biomechanical look.

CHkgwiG3aa	I had a 32A, 5'2'' 115lbs.  I have a thin athletic build, but I wanted to be a C.  Because I was so narrow in the chest are, I had to go with a high profile round shape in order to be a C.  I had 300cc and 325cc (I had a slight asymmetry).  I wanted to avoid that fake look, so I didn't go too big.   I think they came out perfect and look natural.  They are not huge by any means, but had I gone bigger, they might not look as real as they do.|`|AA10774810	I haven't but my good friend had it done last year from 32a to a full 32C.  She wished she would've gone bigger.  Personally, I question whether they did it right because she doesn't look like a 32C.  But then again, knowing her she's wearing a crummy bra.  All in all, though, she's very happy with her decision to get the implants.

P5CyGvZuaa	Sexy Mother Pucker and Two-Faced Lip Injection are the only two I've used that actually plump and last.<br>  <br>  If you want soft, supple lips though, the key is moisture.<br>  <br>  Try this .. get an old toothbrush with soft bristles.  Run it under warm water for a few seconds.  Gently massage the bristles over your lips.  This removes any dead skin from your lips revealing, pink, healthy skin underneath.  You need a good lip balm to keep lips hydrated, which infuses them with moisture and makes them look plump, soft, and healthy.  I like the good ol' Burt's Bees and ChapStik brands.  They work the best and keep the moisture infused in your lips instead of just laying on top of them or (YUCK) making them flaky.<br>  <br>  If you do this routine, your lips with stay soft and supple.  I swear by it.<br>  <br>  Hope I helped.  Good luck.|`|Tx96cpvvaa	sexy mother pucker at target|`|xer9YwfQaa	I was gonna reorder a lip plumper I use when I found a review site that has like 5 different products.

Then put in some hair slides or something for the wow-factor!<br>  <br>  My hair's quite wavy, a bit like yours, and I have these really cute flower clips that I use to take back a little bit from my face on one side. I think it looks quite good!<br>  <br>  You're really lucky to have curly hair because it means you can style it immediately, and without damaging it by straightening, blow-drying or tonging.<br>  <br>  ~Mystic.|`|FLWuVKWnaa	Seriously, dye it all black but the very top layer. Very sexy and get some side bangs.
FLWuVKWnaa	If you really want your hair to grow, eat lots of gelatin and don't always shampoo it. Your hair grows about 1" a month (at least mine does) and you need your natural oils. Trim it at full moon.|`|911f168b7fa0b89caa5732f8b9174286aa	no current  product on the market  makes hair grow faster. it can stimulate roots to encourage!! blood flow etc and  nourishment  so that  the 'normal' rate of hair growth is restored but  not increased.  I would take a  large pinch of salt with any such claims and look to see where evidence and research  substantiates  this if at all ?
gO3aZ72baa	i dont actualy use foundation i think its best to use concealer maybe jst underneath ur eyes n any blemishes u wnt to get rid off it blends in much easier with ur skin tone n gives a more natural look. once u put it on ur face before rubbing in leave it for bout 30 secs to let it dry a bit then wen u rub it in ur not rubbing it away :)<br>  <br>  but if still prefer to use foundation liquid is better this wnt dry out ur skin compared to powder and it is easier to apply (powder can sometimes go patchy) get a good match for ur skin tho by asking for assistance over the counter the assistant will be able to tell u wot  will match ur skin n go well with eyes and hair, avoid having shiney skin by jst using a little bit blusher. boots will definately be able to help you maybelline, loreal paris and even maxfactor will fit in with ur budget :)|`|vHZVFNtHaa	personally i use liquid because it gives you that flawless look, whereas  power gives you that 'caped on' look.<br>  seeing as your 13, a dream matte mouse would be good as its not a power and not a liquid either its inbetween and creates a really good look for your face and is around ￡5-7 pounds in most stores like superdrug/boots.<br>  hope i helped.<br>  x|`|CaRKCpMqaa	Heye hun, Id use a liquid and a powder finish. If your lookin for a cheap brand head to the chemist and buy essence a bottle of foundation is about 4 euro and the powder is about 3.50!<br>  Mosterise your skin before using the foundation, wait until it drys. Then apply light layer of foundation as you don't want to looked caked for a young girl. Then brush the powder all over lightly dusting it.<br>  If you want a cheap brand from boots, Get 'the natural collection' a bottle of foundation is about 3 euro.<br>  Have fun, test them out see what looks best on your skin, Maybe ask a shop assistant for help :)|`|tCZkiYpgaa	I go in the middle and use mousse! (Maybelline Dream Matte Mousse).<br>  <br>  It works really well and costs around ￡6 in Boots.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|EayT8T5Gaa	I would say Liquid!|`|a89kqsJaaa	i say sort of between like dream matte mousse or something like that|`|MKtdkaYJaa	Ok, I have both because I have a skin problem. This is what I do:<br>  1-put liquid on troubled spot ONLY<br>  2-rub in<br>  3-put powder on whole face lightly with a brush<br>  4-blend all together with fingers (otherwise youll look cakey)<br>  H?p3 !

I think the best foundation out there actually is maybelline dream matte mouse, it is amazing and it looks natural and light. So if you have enough for that, i seriously recommend it =]|`|hKZ8lPcDaa	I use both...i used the pressed foundation...but i dont apply too much...a thin layer and then i put the foundation powder over it...again not a whole lot... i use a brush to brush the powdered one on...u should get good results by using both. the liquid doesnt look natural in my opinion n the powder doesnt cover up every imprefection so i use both n the results are always great!|`|UTb5chyJaa	I WAS VERY SKEPTICAL ABOUT POWDER FOUNDATION BUT I GOT A MAYBELLINE BARE MINERALS AND IT WORKS GREAT. I GET BETTER COVERAGE THAN I EVER DID WITH LIQUID AND IT DOESNT CAKE UP AROUND ACNE LIKE LIQUID DOES. I SAY POWDER ALL THE WAY...USE THE MINERAL MAKE UPS IT HELPS TO KEEP SKIN CLEAR AS WELL, IM 23 BUT STILL GET BREAK OUTS, SINCE YOUR 13 YOU MIGHT HAVE THAT PROBLEM AS WELL.OH AND IT ALSO LOOKS VERY NATURAL, LIKE YOU HAVE FLAWLESS SKIN WITHOUT THE MAKE UP LINES. HOPE THAT HELPS, GOOD LUCK!|`|AA11873364	Since you are only 13- don't use liquid foundation. Inly use powder foundation. They have the=is really cool, new product in revlon. The powder is white, but when you rub it in it adjusts to your skin tone- giving you blemishless flawless skin!!!!!|`|9bWCggMgaa	ABSOLUTELY POWDER.<br>  <br>  buy maybelline bare mineral powder foundation, you can get a natural look. liquid is bad to your skin, powder is much better.|`|OEOAN2yiaa	If you get oily skin...I would say powder is better because it won't make it oilier<br>  On the other hand, if your skin is dry, I'd use liquid cuz it could moisturise a bit if you buy the right one.<br>  <br>  =)
SHoGWZWPaa	Highlites, like any other color treatment do not go out of style. Maybe chunky obvious highlites. The best thing to do is thumb through a magazine and find pictures you like and take it into the salon and ask for that color. Works every time. But you must hold it up to your face to see if the color looks good. Example, not all people can go red..or black.|`|w5pqzgVdaa	Psh.<br>  Your friend doesn't know what she's talking about.<br>  Highlights are cute.. and a lot of people have them :]<br>  <br>  And if you don't like how it looks you can probably die it back.|`|8v40KEd0aa	Always in style!|`|lAmNQBunaa	yeah those are in style as long as they look very natural and blend in and not all chunky and streaky :P<br>  <br>  <br>  congrats on the marriage :)|`|rpVQpJA7aa	I think you should do what looks good on you. Where I live, highlights are still in style, especially for spring and summer|`|NsTdWhgkaa	just change your hair how you want it to be<br>  <br>  its your wedding day<br>  <br>  it should be what YOU want<br>  <br>  not whats in "style"|`|NFpaa7fJaa	depending on your hair color, hair high lights arent that bad<br>  <br>  they are out of style, but it shouldnt matter depending on what color you want, and your high lights,<br>  my opinion, for your wedding day, is that you stick with one color, and not have different colors in your hair. its your wedding, and high lights look tacty.
ELvhamMOaa	I think you should just get highlights or lowlights or only go a few shades lighter or darker. I personally think going darker would look good if your hair is light brown, but lowlights could give you the same effect. Please don't do the black, orange, platinum blonde, or other crap that the people on here are saying. Natural is best.|`|W6mVWqGFaa	i would stick wit light brown your avatar is cute and i bet u're even cuter|`|0Fl2WbWKaa	Go with orange, my ex-g/f recently dyed her hair like a "carrot-juice" orange color, and she's really beautiful with it.<br>  <br>  The great thing about hair is it always grows back.

HZqwuHPzaa	Hmmm, let's see...I am blonde, used to be natural blonde when I was a child but my hair turned light brown at 14...I felt awful and died my hair blonde. I have been a blonde ever since (brown with a lot of blonde highlights,so it still looks natural). For myself I could never imagine to be something else...and I have never had a problem to get guys...<br>  <br>  I think it is one thing what your hair color is and another thing if you are able to "wear it"- do you know what I mean? I have some friends with black hair and really shiny hair, the boys are just dieing to date them...also I have many blonde haired friends who look great,but guys don't just like them bcs of the hair, but bcs of the overall look.<br>  <br>  Although I do think ppl connect blonde hair with angelic but also sexy look. Like redheads with eroticism. And I think brunettes if they are natural, they tend to not do too much with their styles so that is why men might think they are boring.<br>  Maybe try to put some kick into your hair by adding some almost invisible nice highlights in your hair or some peekaboo highlights...and tell your guy friends they are just jealous bcs they cannot get into your panties:P:P:P|`|0l7Auiueaa	i'd say brunettes<br>  brunettes tend to have a more intresting color<br>  for example, i'm blonde and my hair is pretty much one colour, my brunette mate, however, has tones of red and auburn, it gorgeee<br>  <br>  she's never had any problems getting boys either<br>  <br>  so, hon, keep natural, and you'll get a guy in no time<br>  <br>  EDIT:<br>  as a blonde myself, i hate blonde hair, its so dull.<br>  i would dye it, but i'm scared it will go green<br>  LOL|`|QW4jdXGjaa	I say brunettes. It looks more natural and doesn't come with the negative stereotypes. But it's all just opinions. You shouldn't color your hair, though. If you got a boyfriend just because of that, it's like they'd only like you for your hair color. I say to stay a brunette.|`|PXuoxlwbaa	well it depends on the person.<br>  i personalyy have been both, blonde, and brunette. <br>  It didnt seem to make much of a difference in the amount of guys i've gotten|`|SHoGWZWPaa	You can't lump someone's face into the category of what color there hair is. Blonds do get noticed more, but that does not mean they are prettier.|`|764Hudunaa	its personal preference. id stay the way you are  changing hair color is not a way to make people like you real beauty comes from within|`|OP7qfOrBaa	it shudent matter what hair colour you have . if you want blonde then dye it blonde but i think natural is the best x|`|TN3U8KSBaa	both.....x<br>  <br>  =]<br>  ?|`|Bt8IxwCpaa	You shouldn't dye your hair to try to get a boyfriend. But if that's what you really want to do, make sure you get a professional to do it. It's a lot harder to go from brunette to blonde than from blonde to brunette. If something goes wrong and you have green hair, then that may make you less attractive. Do whatever makes you feel more confident. Boys like confidence, no matter what your hair color is.BUT in my opinion, brunettes are better :]|`|X5C5UhPFaa	Both are beautiful in their own way. It still comes down to how confident in who you are, if you like yourself,  personality and other attributes. Education, hobbies, common interests, religion. There needs to be a whole package. There are some men who only like redheads. Just be yourself. Be true to yourself. Enjoy who you are and the life you have chosen. The men you meet will be looking for the whole package. If they are dumb enough, to choose a woman for such a superficial reason as hair color, then you are better off without them.|`|iaZuIzJwaa	Stay natural if you died it it would probably look extemely fake<br>  Brunettes can pull off that sexy and sophisticated look much better|`|Qhyovyj8aa	I'm a guy and I personally like brunettes & red heads.

There is no such thing as blondes being more attractive than brunettes or brunettes being more attractive than blondes or redheads being more attrative than brunettes or blondes or vice versa! It's so incredibly stupid. <br>  <br>  There will always be blonde people who are pretty, and blonde people who are ugly. There will always be brunette people who are pretty, and brunette people who are ugly. There will always be redheads who are pretty, and redheads who are ugly.<br>  <br>  The flipping colour of your hair doesn't determine your attractiveness!<br>  <br>  When will people start using their brains?|`|M7lOK6DWaa	That is so dumb!

ggfE4rlvaa	You'll get every rating from zero to 10. Anyone who says a tattoo doesn't hurt is a liar. The only difference is some people handle pain a lot better than others. If you ask me my half-sleeve was everywhere on the pain scale. Hurt really bad in sensitive parts and barely hurt at all on my main arm. Varies with person. At only 15 you should wait to get a tattoo so you don't get one you will regret.|`|LqnWk9Ilaa	It depends on where you get. anywhere that is closer to the bone will hurt more. I have 2, the one on my back didn't hurt to bad maybe a 5, the one on my inner lip didn't really hurt at all maybe a 3.|`|hdlzF6f2aa	probably like a 5 or 6. not enough to cry, but if its over bone, on the top of your foot or other certain places it makes you cringe and go "owchhhh..."|`|UTh8eht0aa	You'll know when you get it. thinking about this too much might stress u ;p<br>  <br>  btw when you pick the best answer want to tell me how your getting it?|`|kwYbe4n6aa	Hurt like ur skin was tearing off by a knife....no just kidding never had a tatto|`|yUiydPReaa	depends on pain tolerance and the area. the first "poke" of the needles hurts but think of something else, most of the artists will have music just focus on that. if your pain tolerance is low do not get anything with shading because that's the most painful in my opinion!|`|fDp7io0Taa	it depends on where the tat. is. sorry, none are completely painless. any bony place hurts more.|`|vJkEF1kPaa	depends were u get it. i had one on my forearm that didnt hurt to much but on my upper arm i think he hit the bone on my shoulder

(Maybe too many girls just don't have the right bottom for it... go figure.)|`|2uZivThaaa	$250-$300 depending on how big you wanted it and if you want color or not.

What your getting is super cute! tramp stamps are only tribal crap and your ex boyfriends name. lol|`|jUdqsRfOaa	Aren't lower back tattoos tramp stamps?|`|cjS1g70xaa	Sorry I can't contribute as to how much it would cost but I know a tattoo like that would probably start from a minimum of $150.<br>  <br>  I think it's a beautiful picture though ^^<br>  <br>  Also 'tramp stamp' are you kidding me? It's one of the most ridiculous things i've ever heard and people who say that carry the same stigma of people against tattoos in the first place. So really you're just betraying your group of tattoo friends. <br>  <br>  I agree with the above that tramp stamps are mainly tribal and ex boyfriend names. People get so many tasteful tattoos there so get your tattoo and don't care what anybody else thinks. If you're content with it then it won't matter what ANYBODY says about it. :> xx
wDp3DZ7Iaa	I think it would look good to get fringe bangs but I don't think you should dye it lighter than bleach blonde. It will make your hair even thinner and it might make it frizzy and on most people I think it looks trashy. But I think fringe bangs look great on people with blonde hair especially really long hair like you have.<br>  Like this: <a href="http://images.askmen.com/galleries/actress/reese-witherspoon/pictures/reese-witherspoon-picture-1.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://images.askmen.com/galleries/actre...</a>
ggfE4rlvaa	Around here (as tattoo prices are completely different per areas) I'd say it's about a $500 piece, maybe somewhere between that and $700.

That was wrong of him.<br>  <br>  But you need to put a stop to it.  You simply say no, refuse to acknowledge any further communications from him, and you may have to stop going to him for professional services.  It can only end badly.  You can terminate it now, or go through a painful breakup later.  Your choice.<br>  <br>  He is not the only talented hairdresser in town!|`|jHOmAoFHaa	Tell him you want to be friends.

8lHsOVxqaa	Those are some great ideas peeps!<br>  <br>  Anywho, find out what she likes most. Something memorable<br>  perhaps from a fond memory of you both as a child? Does she<br>  have a favorite flower, animal, bird, color, music? Things that are<br>  sentimental to her, and both of you even.<br>  <br>  Your mom is a lucky woman to have had someone like you<br>  though. And you are a lucky man to have a mother like yours.<br>  <br>  Good luck! And let us know what you decide.|`|anfhcnWeaa	i don't know what should get but whatever you decide to do make sure you don't decide to get a portrait of her because they don't always come out very good most times they come out looking like cartoons.|`|O6lT2u2waa	If you're open to suggestions, I personally think it'd be cool to have like her signature like the other girl said, but on your left or right side, whichever the donated kidney is on.

54o0wQtNaa	If you are male try a tux if you have one, or try a costume store for a low grade one, you can also look online for a tail coat and were orange shoes. Try a homemade costume they are easy and cheep to make too. All you need is a long sleeve tee-shirt, some sweatpants, fabric paint, and a party cone hat. take a the t-shirt (preferably black) and (paint it black then) make a 3/4 white oval near the bottom of the shirt and make the other 4th on the pants paint your shoes and the party cone orange for a beak and flippers.<br>  <br>  If you are female and want something sexier try the same thing except with shorts and orange knee socks and just use face paint for the noes. Also you can order online a sexy tuxedo playboy thing and add some orange socks and face paint and such to make it a penguin. It is also easy to add a tailcoat type thing to an old black leotard, sew on some black pleats in the back and a white oval in the back add some penguin accessory's and voila. <br>  <br>  Also think creatively, you could try for "the Penguin" from batman and were like mittens sewed together. if you don't know who this is then you should either A watch batman ;) or not do it it may give you a few creative laughs from a scarce few but it will also take up a lot of explaining time. Good Luck!!

Did someone make a comment while you were having sex? <br>  <br>  You should read Eve Ensler's book "The Vagina Monologues" especially the monologue with the "Man who loves vagina's."<br>  <br>  If this is not what your talking about, your vagina should not be exposed in any bathing suit, thong or bikini, or wear some cute shorts over your bathing suit as everyone has mentioned earlier.|`|e9gsf1GJaa	uuh, if they look @ it then just shout PERV before they even get a chance to judge its appearance .<br>  ROTFL, but its kinda weird.<br>  buy the shorts version for the bottom half,<br>  or just wear shorts.<br>  just tell yourself, THERES BIGGER VA-J-J's OUT THERE.<br>  hahahahha|`|L2dxBXQRaa	No ones going to see it are they?

Don't worry, you're probably not the only one there that'll be worrying about how you look! No-one feels confident in a swimming cozzie! You could try wearing black swimming shorts/hotpant things over your cozzie, black hides everything :] and if they're shorts then they'll draw all the attention away from your crotch! Then you could try wearing a bright cozzie or something with a big logo that focusses people's eyes further up!! Alternatively, you could wear no cozzie and just the shorts... then i can guarantee it will not be between your legs that that they're looking! haha  Hope you enjoy the swimming though! When you're in the water people wont be able to see anyway|`|WDLnNm7Maa	i think you should wear what ever makes you feel comfortable..If you are embarrassed with that, i say don't worry.. everyone gets embarrassed with who they are. Try to wear a bathing suit that doesn't go up your crotch, and maybe a bathing suit with bright colors. There are bathing suit shorts you can buy, if you don't want the underwear type. Don't worry i don't think anyone would check out your vag.. unless their pigs. Maybe try waxing...|`|5y38Pdtiaa	what! are you scared you are gonna fill up with water and drown?<br>  i don't think you will. how big is it?|`|rDb9ZLyfaa	Well will you and your big va-jay- jay be swimming naked?

AA10135392	Do you wear your hair relaxed or natural? I'm assuming relaxed since you're considering half up, half down styles. Personally, I would recommend the updo.  I wore a white halter to prom my junior year and I wore my hair in spiral curls actually. I had all of my hair loose and down, and it actually looked nice. Just as a general rule, pick styles that focus upward onto your face; you don't want hair that hangs long and draws the eyes downward. Those styles will make you look somewhat frumpy or slouchy.  If you're doing your own hair and not going to a salon, you best bet is something simple like an updo because spiral curls hanging down are easy to screw up when you're doing them for the first time. Also, if you will be dancing, you might not want a down hairstyle because if you sweat at all the humidity will ruin your look. Updos stay nice for the whole night! French twists and simple updos are probably the easiest you can go while still looking elegant.  The french twist is one you will definitely need someone else to do for you. <br>  <br>  You probably would benefit from having someone else assist you in putting the style together. If you have thick hair, you will need to get extra black bobby pins.  Try decorative bobby pins with jewels and such or a pretty barrette for an extra touch (You can get these at stores like Claire's, Wal-mart, and even a dollar store).  If your hair is thinner or doesn't hold curls, you will need hairspray or hair gel.  Spray works better for beginners since it's not as easy to use too much of it. I prefer an aerosol spray that comes in a can because it tends to come out in a lighter mist.  What you want it to lightly mist your hair, not drench it: hairspray comes out watery but dries rock hard.<br>  <br>  Just as a note, you may need to alter some of the methods for curling your hair since you have black hair.  It is possible to use a curling iron, but that is also a way to do the most damage to your hair.  What I usually do is use sponge rollers to roller set my hair and then spray my hair with a little water  before bed to make the curls tighter.  Honestly, though, if you have a spare $10 or so, most salons will roller set your hair pretty cheap.  I highly recommend that you see a stylist who is familiar with black hair, though. Usually, those curls are very tight and will last long, so you can get them done even a few days before your formal.<br>  <br>  <br>  See the links I gave below for good tutorials on creating an updo. Some of the links come with pictures :-D.  Hope that all helps. Good luck with your formal!!!|`|AA10828189	If your hair holds a curl, then pull your hair into a ponytail at the crown of your head (where men usually go bald first). then pull some strands at the nape (by the neck at the back). Curl these either by putting them in spiral curlers or with a curling iron, your choice. <br>  Take the ponytail holder out of ponytail and twist tail til it spirals around itself at the crown. Tuck the end under the "knot " you have just made and pin "knot" in place. (If your hair is medium to thick buy the larger bobby pins, if thin the small ones will work. If you have bangs or like a little hair around your face to frame it then brush your fingers gently around your face at the hairline to put a small amount out. Curl any of the longer pieces to match the strands at the back. And you are done. You can spray it with hairspray if you like.<br>  If your hair doesn't hold curl, skip pulling strands out at the nape. It will look a bit more formal, but just as pretty.<br>  Do try this a few times before the big night, so you know exactly what you are doing. It will be easier that way and not add to your stress level.|`|4be91502f504f0191198e18e8c230848aa	I don't know what type of hair you have; fine, wavy, thick or thin. But if your hair is long and not very thick if you wash your hair put setting lotion on it and french braid it ina like 10 braids and keep it up for about a day when you take it down it'll be really long wavy and pretty. It looks really natural and way better than actual crimps. If you want smaller waves make smaller braids bigger waves bigger braids. Trust me it'll look beautiful especially if you have longer hair.
mhRcN4azaa	i'm a stylist and national educator for John Paul Mitchell Systems..... no matter what you do, you absolutely cannot have your hair chemically curled... no perms!!!!!  this will cause your hair to literally break off... the chemicals used in a relaxer cause a permanent restructure of the hair strand... which means in simple terms that it cannot be changed again. your best bet is to use a small barrel curling iron or to set your hair in hot rollers. this will temporarily curl your hair but your hair will revert back to its straight state when it is wet. hope this helps....|`|bc5e848b650f7c23320e43210b9e4538aa	Spiral Curls - if you go to a salon and ask for sprial curls they can do it before and it comes out really nice i have done it before|`|vGI4iN3Raa	do rollers and blow dry and wala....beautiful curls..|`|2353cf98fbef8063b560af8b1555cb48aa	Go to www.freshlookhair.com and they have a line that helps you with that look.

You can also do straw sets (atleast there are lots of naturals who do -- not sure how well it would  work on relaxed hair) to get reeally small, natural-looking curls. Or you can put your hair in twists or braids, then take them down to get a wavy look.<br>  <br>  Transitioning to natural hair is also an option, that's what I've done. You can blow dry/iron your hair straight if you want, and then wear it naturally curly when you want.|`|AA10491303	you cant do that with a relaxed hair.. u should wait for your hair to grow naturally, then you can make it curl like that.. otherwise if you curl it with relaxed hair, your hair would just damage more and youll end up regreting it..<br>  <br>  and if i were u, id rather stay with straight relaxed hair than having super  curls like that|`|AA12242438	The only thing you can really do is go natural. Let the relaxer grow out. I never relaxed my hair, but i have a lot of friends who did and now most of them are going natural.

262bba61094d84a24f7c58ba6ddb7473aa	I never used hot rollers....they seem too complicated for me. When using a curling iron use a spray on your hair to prevent damage from heat (try Tressame sp?) and finish with hair spray to set the curls.|`|1yl4VBoraa	Use a smaller roller or curling iron than usual.|`|AA10799832	I think hot rollers if you don't know how to curl your hair with a curling iron so it will stay. But they can both come out the same. If you are going to use a curling iron spray your hair with hair spray first. If your going to use hot rollers put a little mouse in your hair first. Hope I helped. Please add me to your contacts and email me w/ any hair questions you have via yahoo answers.|`|OMDJIt1aaa	For styling your whole head - hot rollers are it. Depending on the size of the curler and the amount of hair you curl around each curler, you can get great results from a curly look to a smoother fuller look.  You can even do spot curls with hot rollers and put your makeup on or get your clothes ready or have a cup of coffee while the curlers cool.<br>  <br>  A curling iron is great for touchups or curling a few sections of hair for effect.  Much more time consuming and tedious to style your whole head with a curling iron.  For ringlets around your face or to accent an updo, a curling is OK.

folicure obtendras una pasta granulosa espesa ya que tengas eso te vas hacer lo siguiente:<br>  vaporizaciones es decir vas a poner agua hirviendo y cuando este sacando humo le bajas a la estufa te cubres tu cara con una toalla y te acercas al vapor y lo tapas con la misma toalla para que el vapor no se escape.<br>  hasta donde aguantes el calor<br>  despues secaras tu rostro con una toallita facial<br>  y te pondras lapasta que hiciste anteriormente dandote un masaja hasta que este sece un poco lo dejaras reposar por unos 5 a 10 minutos.<br>  te lavas tu rostro y te vas aplicar locion

bloqueador solar <br>  <br>  para que en primera no te salgan manchas de sol y para que te limpie las manchas provocadas por acne. <br>  <br>  tips:<br>  compra toallitas humedas de bebe y siempre

por la cara  limos con sal y exfoliate y despues  deja secar y lavate la cara con agua fira y luego pone un poco de avena y agua y  revolv y ponete en la cara  deja secar  ylava con agua  te quita manchas y acne pero tenes que hacerlo por lo menos  4 veces por semana resulta en serio yo tenia granitos y ahora no tengo nada|`|YjZmnCnOaa	que edad tienes?<br>  <br>  mira, yo he probado con muchos productos y ninguno llegó a funcionar<br>  <br>  tengo 25 a?os y aun me salen barros y algun granito, pero ya casi nada, y se me estan quitando, y ni se me ve nada ya, estoy happy por fin<br>  <br>  mira, yo lo que hago es lavarme la cara dos veces al dia, con jabon neutro de aloe vera y glicerina (las glicerina aclara las manchas) que me compro en la farmacia... ni tonico, ni astringentes fuertes (queman la piel y salen mas manchas, y la sequedad hace que salga granos), ni alcohol ni nada de nada... te en cuenta que tienes un desorden de la piel y asi la pones peor... cuando menos caso le hagas mejor se pondrá<br>  <br>  luego me pongo cremita hidratante, ahora uso la de pure A de garnier, es muy buena y es verdad que funciona... a partir de ahi me compre tb el lapiz pure A y cuando me esta saliendo un granito me pongo y se me quita antes de salirme<br>  <br>  la mejor solucion, es no tocartelos, y dejar que asi desaparezcan solos, y hacerte un pieling un par de veces a la semana, y... aunque suene extra?o hidratarte muy bien la piel, porque la misma sequedad, hace que salgan mas granitos ya que la piel esta menos hidratada y mas sensible<br>  <br>  asi que nada, hidratacion y limpieza sin ser exagerada q la limpieza excesiva tb hace q salga acné y barro... la cremita q yo uso vale 5 euros y me dura tres meses... y la uso dos veces al dia, ma?ana y noche<br>  <br>  intenta no maquillarte, o no usar base, yo solo utilizo polvos, y asi tengo menos suciedad, la crema de maquillaje es muy grasa.... y la piel te agradecera q no la uses, asi q hidratante no grasa y luego ya si quieres polvitos y colorete q es mejor<br>  <br>  <br>  yo fui al medico y me dijo q era lo mejor que podia hacer, y me esta dando resultados, la verdad que despues de lo que tuve... un granito cuando tengo la regla no me asusta jajaja, ya no me supone un problema <br>  <br>  y recuerdad los potingues antiacne por muy caros o buen nombre que tengan son lo peor... a la larga traen problemas<br>  <br>  mi dermatologo me aconsejo aguantar y no echarte cosas raras en la cara, y si he aguantado y un par de meses como mucho y mi cara era casi normal .....<br>  <br>  Si usas los polvos talcos se secaran los granos por fuera, pero se obstruye el poro por dentro y se infecta y ahi puede salirte un se?or crater y granos mas feos.... intenta olvidarte de la cara... <br>  <br>  espero q te sirva|`|c3fc6bd2bf2523806cba968bc768e2a3aa	Husa un astringente para que todas las noches y las ma?anas te limpies la cara con el, pero si no sabes cual comprar te recomiendo que

hYCepRVOaa	Hi there, I have tried maybelline mineral foundation that just came out this month and they have pretty good coverage on redness and breakouts.  I also have sensitive skin and it does not irritate or have that cakey makeup look.  Usually they have them at local drugstores. I have seen them at cvs, riteaid. walgreens and ulta stores. I also have seen they have testers in all the stores that carry them which makes it easy to pick your color and test drive it on your skin before buying it.  If you have a walgreens near you they have them on sale this week too for like buy one get one free and they run around 10 dollars - a good deal! Oh yea when you buy it at drugstores if you end up not liking it you can always return it or exchange it for something else - nothing to lose =)|`|6dGt9xlUaa	try Sheer Cover or Bear Minerals. this stuff is a mineral foundation that is good for you skin. it has anti-oxidants and won't make you break out. go to sheercover.com or bearminerals.com|`|d012e5f0e32f0ae6ba01731124f4be5eaa	Try puritycosmetics.co.uk.

9176ced168f36be5278735505c86c8f1aa	Tattoo infections happen. Everyone is different and people heal differently. We give out aftercare instructions that we think will work well with MOST people. There are always exceptions to the rules. What works great for one person can work crappy on another. The thing about infections is that there can be so many reasons they happen that it's hard to say. A tattoo is a big open wound and ANY wound can get infected. If you get an infection it isn't necessarily the fault of the tattoo artist.<br>  <br>  Signs of infections : Red, overly swollen, overly painful to the touch, oozing any type of pus or strange colored discharge OTHER than a clear fluid with perhaps a small amount of ink in it, which can be normal. When I say red, I mean a darker red with a defined edge usually that slowly grows as time goes on. A new tattoo the next day can still be a little light red around it because of the trauma to the skin. The big thing is to go the doctor the moment you even think you have an infection...If it IS an infection, the longer you wait to get on antibiotics the harder and longer it is to heal and the more damage will be done. Hope this helps a little. |`|s7QVIZGXaa	If you went to a professional tattoo artist with a good reputation then i think you are ok.The only thing that might have happened is that the artist might have gone too deep with the tattoo needles. This isn't anything too worry about, it just might heal with uneven results.For proper healing and to keep as much pigment as possible in the skin use a tattoo balm. A great product is tattoo goo. I use it for everything.  It is amazing.I even use it as lip balm. If you are feeling a very strong sunburn then this is totally normal. The forearm is one of the most painful places to get tattooed. My sleeve killed for a few weeks after i got my sleeve finished on the bottom forearm. As long as you let the tattoo breathe, and use some kinf of ointment like tattoo goo you will be alright. I'm guessing your other tattoo is on a fattier place on the body,. back, stomach, breast, buttock. The skin is very thin on your forearm. Don't stress it. Just let it breathe. Use a good tattoo balm. And don't scratch or itch. It sounds like normal healing. Good luck with it. |`|c65e1091187dd6a476616030323b65aeaa	If your really worried don't hesitate to call your tattoo artist and tell them what's going on. It may feel tight if your not keeping enough ointment on it. That's when tattoos in the healing process tend to crack or feel tight and not heal the way they should. Either way, give your artist a call, I'm sure they would be more than happy to help. Good luck!|`|HLmd17r9aa	I think you should be fine. It depends how big the tattoo is. The bigger it is, more detail, colouring, etc., the more it will hurt. I have 11 tattoos, and 6 of them are on my arms. Some hurt more than others. I would just say moisturize a lot with something unscented, like lubriderm. If the pain continues or is getting extreme, go back to your artist and let them know you are concerned. I would say there is no reason to worry yet.|`|rNzmTRueaa	Is it more detailed than your first?  I found that my second tattoo hurt more because it is a lot more detailed and had a lot more surface area that had to heal.  It could have something to do with the location too, thought I'm not sure on that.

9qXHUkf2aa	Aww, I'm sorry! Which disease is it?<br>  <br>  AE currently has some knee-highs for sale for around $3-5. I'm pretty sure it's AE, but it might be aerie...Anyways they're a pretty good deal and they're cute too. Maybe they could go over the special socks you have? (I'm guessing they're medical, since you said they were expensive?)<br>  <br>  I think that pleated skirts, especially ones that are light-colored to contrast with your socks, would look great with knee-high socks.  Wearing a black top would pull together the outfit nicely.  Shorts would be okay too.  And long pants are always an option on colder days.|`|eKiDXLDtaa	You could wear a knee sock over the left legs knee sock, so you can make them the samee|`|JLRXDriRaa	Wear shorts/skirt with a bright graphic tee.

I love that! But just to let you know the link is broken on the second skirt.|`|EnAtAmHoaa	i really like the first top. however i think it would look better with a pair of fancy pin striped straight leg dress pants in black instead of a skirt. and i would off set all the black with a nice white belt and silver jewelery. i think that would look very classy and elegant for the occasion. and i know how hard it is to buy pants when you're under 5'5'' but you can always get them altered. there are places that can hem pants in less than an hour for a very good price.<br>  <br>  the third shirt would also work with this. i also think the 4th shirt and third skirt would go together nicely|`|ATry05n0aa	I like the first top and the third skirt because of the plain pattern on the top gets played up by the semi-edgy design on the skirt. Hope this helps!|`|dlA3e26waa	i really like the second shirt and the third skirt!<br>  have fun at the party!|`|0N2hv5nOaa	Yeah defo!<br>  I love the first two tops and the 3rd skirt :_=)|`|00hrUiQZaa	Tbh i dont really like any of the tops,but if i had to pick one the 4th one.Same with the skrts,and one of them didnt hav link.But best skirt first one xoxox
8IWw1Ij5aa	Hi there!<br>  <br>  If you want to be a model I would actually recommend looking for local agencies instead of just posting your pic on a modeling site. Those sites are generally saturated with people and 99% will not get jobs. Most clients will not go looking randomly on modeling sites for talent, and you never know who's really asking to take your picture.<br>  <br>  (Also, you need to know your EXACT measurements. Height, weight, bust, waist hips ect.)<br>  <br>  So! How to you get started in the world of fashion and modeling?<br>  <br>  Research!<br>  <br>  Yep- that's the first step. Trust me, I have logged HUNDREDS of hours researching modeling and I'm still doing it on a daily basis.<br>  <br>  Let me start you off with some basics.<br>  <br>  -Know the type of modeling you want to do. Fashion, fashion/runway and photo print (Meaning magazines, local papers ect.) are generally the top three. In order to do runway you need to be a minimum of 5'8, and even at that models really only get runway jobs starting at 5'9. Remember that many models are at 5'10- 5'11 and are considered average height in the modeling world.<br>  <br>  -Research local talent agencies. Local agencies is where you will get and agent who can book jobs for you. BEWARE OF SCAMS. Remember that you should never have to pay someone to work for them! A reputable agent not take ANY money from you because they make money when you make money. They may suggest local training programs and image consultants, but will not take money themselves.<br>  <br>  -Find out how to apply. Most talent agency websites will have a place where they tell you how to do this. Most are similar, a headshot (a photo of your face) and a body shot in form fitting clothing, (But not skimpy or in a bikini!) Good guidelines for taking pictures are to keep it natural and fun!<br>  <br>  -Think about this for awhile. Modeling is a tough business. You are CONSTANTLY being judged on your looks and being asked to improve on them. It can be stressful, time consuming, and physically exhausting.<br>  <br>  - If you're under the age of 16, in order to actually be able to work at your age you will need a *work permit and a **Coogan Bank account. (Look to the bottom of the post to see a description)<br>  <br>  -I'd recommend taking some posing and acting classes and see how much you like it. This will also gie you an advantage when applying and give you time to figure out if you like it before jumping into a binding contract.<br>  <br>  -Rejection is a HUGE part of modeling. Sometimes clients are looking for a certain ethnicity, sometimes they are looking for a certain height, and sometimes they are just downright mean. Know that you will get rejected FAR more times then you will book a job.<br>  <br>  -Unique looks and races are generally a total plus. But sadly, it does not guarentee anything.<br>  <br>  So! With all that said. Let me give you a check list of sorts.<br>  <br>  1. Research Research Research! Find local talent agencies, local classes, and find some poses to start practicing at home.<br>  <br>  2. After you know how to apply, have your brother and his fancy new camera take some pictures of you! Try for basic headshots and body shots, with the headshots showing your full face and the bodyshots showing clothing that is form fitting but NOT skimpy. (They want to see your build but not your bellybutton ring. ;)<br>  <br>  3.Booklet/portfolios are generally for AFTER you are signed by and agent. Usually you can submit yourself to an agency by email or written letter. If you manage to get an interview with an agent I would NOT recommend bringing a booklet with a ton of pics with you. This generally send the wrong message to the agent- that you think you're already a model. Just print out 1-5 of your favorite photos and bring them in an envelope. The agent will appreciate it because it's easier for them.<br>  <br>  4. It's sad to say but most agents will only spend a few seconds per submission. So make your photos stand out! Be friendly and unique and you'll have a good chance!<br>  <br>  5. Remember that there are MANY people who probably submit to the same agency. Have fun then don't worry about it once you submit your photos. If it happens it happens, if not- whatever!<br>  <br>  Good Luck!<br>  <br>  *A work permit is a permit for children and teens under the age of 16 to work for others and receive compensation. In order to get one of these your parents and school have to approve so make sure you have good grades! It's better to do this BEFORE you start go in to an agency interview.<br>  <br>  **All parents whose children work in the entertainment industry are required to open a Coogan account. It is mandatory that parents put 15% or their child’s gross earnings into this bank account where it will essentially be the separate property of the child rather than that of the parents. Parents cannot touch the money without a court order or until the child is eighteen. This law was passed in 2000 as a result of Jackie Coogan and other prior child stars whose parents had unlawfully spent all of their earnings. It's better to do this BEFORE you start go|`|AofhDwkmaa	A free and easy way to find out if you have a marketable image would be to launch a free Yahoo site.

t2LOcPkLaa	Jeans are good for skating. I like the grey tank better; I think don't like mixing navy with jeans. You can wear a cute long necklace with it :) You might also want to bring along a hair tie in case you want to put your hair up and an extra pair of socks for after you're done skating (& make sure you wear tall socks, those ankle ones are so uncomfortable with skates).|`|i01egybJaa	That's an awesome outfit :) I think the tank looks good in grey.|`|kZYEXGZzaa	totally|`|xg0L0li9aa	i would say to just be yourself|`|22RHxwVmaa	I think you should get the tank top in grey. For accessories I wouldn't wear anything except maybe stud earrings because they'll just get in the way and too much will be overbearing.

fBq6gCuAaa	1. Buy embroidery thread, sometimes called embroidery floss, at a craft or sewing store. Embroidery floss is thicker than normal sewing thread, and comes in many colors. You must have more than one color to create a striped effect. The more colors you choose, the wider the bracelet will be.<br>  <br>     2. Take the first color and wrap it around your wrist 2 times,or from your elbow to your finger tips(More accurate!). The length you now have is the correct fit for your wrist, but if you use more string than this it makes it easier to keep going at the end of the bracelet.<br>  <br>     3. Cut a piece this length from each of the other colors.<br>  <br>     4. Tie a knot at the top.<br>  <br>     5. the far left string (red) over the string to the right (green) creating a shape like the numeral four.<br>  <br>     6. Pull the first string through the "opening" in the four and then pull it up and tighten to make a knot. Repeat this step again on the same string.<br>  <br>     7. Pull the first string over to the right and repeat the steps above, but using the next string in each case.<br>  <br>     8. Work this way for all the strings to complete the first row of all the same color horizontally.<br>  <br>     9. Start the next row using the string to the far left (green).<br>  <br>    10. Repeat all the steps until you have the row finished.<br>  <br>    11. Keep going until the bracelet is long enough to fit around your wrist comfortably. To make sure it fits well, try it on your wrist, there should be enough extra room that you can fit about 2 fingers in next to your wrist, since the bracelet can shrink in water and become too tight (although it will stretch back out when dry).<br>  <br>    12. Tie the loose ends of your fitted bracelet with a square knot, just like how you started the bracelet.<br>  <br>    13. Tie the bracelet onto your wrist (or your friend's) at the right length with a knot, like the first part of tying a shoelace, but do it twice - this is a square knot. It helps if you can get someone to help you here, but it can be done alone.<br>  <br>    14. Trim any loose ends. You can also add charms or beads to the ends for decoration, simply slip them on the floss and tie a knot beneath them.<br>  <br>    15. Bracelets are excellent to show true friendship, so give your finished bracelet to a good friend!

You might want to go it alone because you don't want to get rejected in front of everyone.  If she is a myspace/facebook friend start dropping her hints, or text her and drop hints.

Go online at claires.com, an buy a pair of earrings or a necklace. They even have $1 stuff like headbands or sports bands or sometimes they even have $1 sales on nailpolish! <br>  <br>  I would reccommend going on claires.com, because other stores that also sell acessoriess like Urban Outfitters, Nordstroms, LF Laguna, Anthropologie, Forever 21, and others, are more than 3 dollars. <br>  <br>  Also, you can't pay with cash online! So, if you can spend $3 on a credit card that's okay, but with bills or quarters, that wouldn't work.<br>  <br>  If you don't want to buy jewelry, then just buy a pack of gum, candy, a smoothie, or even just nail polish from your nearest pharmacy! You can't really buy clothes for $3, so buy food, or of course, cute, cheap accessories, like I said above. <br>  <br>  Treat yourself to something good wth your...$3! haha. <br>  <br>  HOPE THIS HELPS! =)
ZLWAe4gBaa	You have a very pretty face, a nice complexion, and pretty dark hair, so you're already off to a good start. :)<br>  Try using a some black mascara on the top and bottom lashes (just lightly, and you could even curl them.)  Try a black eyeliner on the top only, and a dusting of blush on the cheekbones.  For your lips, a shade of pink would compliment you well.  Try to avoid dark eye shadows (but a purple would be ok.)<br>  You have nice natural beauty.  However, avoid covering your face in a ton of makeup.  It takes away from what you already have going for you!|`|kWYsXwnWaa	Definately need to do something with the eyes. <br>  Eyeliner, Mascara.|`|2U4U22cxaa	Keep your hair long and dress preppy because you have that look that would work well with preppy. Maybe try some cute colors like yellow and pink and get some ballet flats I think silver are cute. If you are into sports mix preppy with sporty but I would stick with cute preppy like jcrew,gap,banana republic stuff like that.|`|qWOvlh4faa	I think you're really pretty as you are, but if you want to be a girlygirl, then you should;<br>  Fix you eyebrows a bit (with some eyebrowfix, to hold them in place)<br>  Put on some eye-makeup.

Your hair and the camera angle in the second make you look sort of emo and sort of scene.  The third pic makes you seem more approachable because you look friendly without seeming stuck-up.  Little or no makeup and your relaxed style give an overall impression of non snobbishness while not classifying you into any specific scene.<br>  <br>  You look clean, well groomed and healthy.  Your teeth are very straight and you are a healthy weight, so I'd guess that you're from a middle to upper middle class home and are cared for.<br>  <br>  You have a decent sense of style and are possibly wearing a VS pink jacket in the first pic.  Means that you don't hate large corporations and that you would rather look cute than hard core.<br>  <br>  Your poses, hairstyle, clothes and backgrounds make you look north american, actually either Canadian or from the usa, probably the latter.<br>  <br>  The sparsely but tastefully decorated room in the background of your last pic show that either you care a lot about detail or that isn't your room.. or hasn't been for long.<br>  <br>  You have good skin and a small nose, no wrinkles or skin discoloration.  You aren't over 20.  From your question and your clothes, you're probably 15-17.<br>  <br>  Brown hair and eyes along with a lightly tanned complexion leave me guessing at your heritage.<br>  <br>  A rating of looks (obviously personal taste gets in here) is above average without being overtly striking.  7<br>  <br>  You aren't doing anything wrong, as far as I can tell, look-wise.  In order to appeal to a specific audience, you could wear different clothes or more makeup or do something less obvious with your hair.  I've found that small changes in hair color (streaking/highlights) can really change up your appearance.  The same goes for pulling your hair up or wearing a little eyeliner.  Of course, if you tailor your looks to a certain group, you'll possibly alienate other ones.<br>  |`|s75rtAOfaa	I could see you into music and art, you're clothing style fits you well and the way your face and eyes are oriented. You look to be about sixteen or seventeen. <br>  Seven. <br>  I like you're "look", you're hair would look good either as it is, long or short, but not too short. You can pretty much do anything with it though. <br>  More emo than anything to be completely honest, but a nice person that likes to smile. <br>  Yes, you look approachable to some degree, you look like you can have a strong opinion. <br>  Yes, you keep up your appearance well. <br>  I would say exactly the same thing I'm saying now.

Its fair to say that most black tie do's the girls will wear cocktail dresses, so basically formal yet pretty knee length dresses.  As ever, if you want, black trousers and smart top are always good too.  If the event is that much more formal then a maxi floor length dress is more appropriate.|`|YFmtHNkiaa	A semi-formal or formal dress or gown would work. Also, a nice suit outfit with slacks would probably be acceptable.
