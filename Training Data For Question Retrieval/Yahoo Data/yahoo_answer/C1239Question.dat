20090222130720AAoBrGC	Science & Mathematics;Physics	Anyone who is bored and would like to read my physics paper!?	My paper is about the physics of throwing a softball. This is only half and I keep revising it and i need a new set of eyes. So just let me know what i should change!! Thanks. Oh, and the more detail about the physics the better         Physics is the science that studies the relationships between objects with matter, energy, motion, and force. Most people are not familiar with the general physics that is always happening around them. Before ever taking physics as a class, I was a part of those people who did not know or understand general physics. I never gave it much thought or even realized how often physics was happening around me. I guess you could say that I was oblivious to physics and to how it affected my daily life. All though I may not have always been able decipherer when physics was occurring, I am getting better at knowing when it is happening. I realize now that physics has always been there helping me carry out daily tasks, like lifting a book off of the table or throwing a softball.    Force plays a big role in getting the ball to its intended target. When a player is getting ready to throw a ball they need to think about how much force they want to put behind their throw. If an outfielder is throwing to second base she is not going to use the same amount of force she would when throwing home. Obviously, the farther away the target is the greater amount of force that is needed to get the ball to where it needs to go. As the ball is in the player’s hand ready to start its journey, there are multiple forces that are waiting their turn to act upon the player and the ball. Once the ball is in the player’s possession, the girl will start her arm motion. As the ball and player are touching they have a contact force. The player continues through her motion and she releases the ball, and the ball starts to travel through the air to its intended target. This happens because the ball’s mass is significantly less than the player’s mass and because of this, the ball accelerates, just as Newton’s Second Law stated that it would. Throwing a softball is also great example of Newton’s Third Law, being that the action is the player pushing the ball forward and the reaction being the ball pushing back on the player. However, seeing how the ball’s mass is very little, the player does not notice the ball’s push back and she is able to finish with her follow through.

The Pangaea Theory      The theory of Pangaea, first introduced by Alfred Wegner in the early 1900’s, explores the concepts of plate tectonics and continental drift. While the theory is still being altered as we find more evidence, scientists have already found many reasons to believe in this ancient super-continent.      One major piece of evidence is the continents and, more importantly, their continental plates, fit together almost perfectly. The fit between eastern coast of South America and the western coast of Africa is the most obvious fit.       Another connection is the northwestern side of Africa and the southeastern gap in North America.    Another piece of evidence is that the Indian subcontinent and Asia are joined together by the Himalaya Mountains. Scientists believe this happened when India crashed upward into Asia, forcing the land to form mountains.      A third piece of evidence is that similar rock types were found on coasts of separate continents. __________      The fourth piece of evidence is that the same species of animal fossils were found on separate continents. Many of these animals could not swim long distances across the ocean, and the possibility of numerous land bridges that suddenly vanished is unlikely. Therefore the animals must have traveled across the land when it was still a super-continent to have remained there when the continents shifted.        Another piece of evidence is how the same species of plant fossils are present on several continents. __________      A sixth idea that assists in explaining Pangaea is sea-floor spreading. __________________________      The final piece of evidence is that glacial deposits from the glacier that once covered Antarctica also can be found on the continents that were believed to have surrounded it.

Let's say my boyfriend's name is..Bill. I know Bill's not lying. Rave's told me things that..i've never even heard of before. Scary things. He's taken away Bill's memory of me once,because I offended him. Trust me,it wasn't fake. It scared the crap out of me at the time,but after a few minutes he came back.      Rave's got an accent,much different from Bill's. Bill used to be involved in Wicca you could say.      But sometimes,whenever i'm having really bad problems with Bill,Rave..helps me? He takes over Bill,and well,he basically sort of yells at me when i'm doing something stupid,but he has saved me from a lot of akward situations. And a few times i've just talked to this..demon.      It's such a strange case,no,Bill doesn't have a mental disorder. No multiple personalities. I know the difference between the two. I could tell if he was lying,this is just so real.       I'm the only one he's ever told,and the only one that really believes him.       I know,it's so unbelievable to others,but you wouldn't really know unless you knew him.

I have 5 questions from a physics lab my teacher gave me, I am in high school and they are university caliber questions help as best you can without results      1) Through what fraction of a vibration has the prong of a tuning fork moved while the sound wave traveled down to the water surface and was reflected back up the fork again?      2) If a longer tube were available, would it be possible to find another position where resonance is produced? Explain      3) How could you modify this experiment to determine whether the water vapor inside the tube affects the results?      4) How does the amplitude of vibration affect the data?      5) How could you modify the experiment to find the resonant length of an open piper      BTW the lab was you had a tuning fork and you made it vibrate, then you place it over a tube which was underneath the water mostly and you had to move it up and down until you heard the loudest noise, if that helps      Thanks

20090222194329AAzMoUi	Science & Mathematics;Physics	Strange Mastering Physics question?	At first glance I thought this masteringphysics problem would be cake, but I'm getting the feeling that it's impossible.      While standing on frictionless ice, you (mass 65.0 kg) toss a 4.50 kg rock with initial speed 12.0m/s. The rock is 15.2 m from you when it lands. Take the x axis on the ice surface in the horizontal direction of the motion of the rock. Ignore the initial height of the toss.      What is the angle of the toss?      It seems as if the maximum distance of the rock is shorter than 15.2m, since d=v^2/g (maximum distance) comes out to 14.69m. Techniques with kinematics give me sin2theta=(something over 1), which is also impossible. What, if anything, am I missing? Is masteringphysics simply wrong?
