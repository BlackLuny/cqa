20090227113031AAWrXkP	Home & Garden;Garden & Landscape	I have three questions about planting sunflowers?	We live in Southern Vermont, and I was reading that you should plant them after the last frost.  Any idea when it's a good time to plant them?      My mother used to plant them all the time back in Jersey.  She always started them inside.  Is this necessary?  Can we just plant them outside?      The last year my mom planted them, they got eaten before they could grow.  Is there a way to keep animals away from them?        Thanks in advance!

I live in MD, so winters are not that cold compared to other states. From mid November to mid December, I used 108 gallons of propane. The beginning of Jan. I installed a programmable thermostat. We used 104 gallons from mid Dec to mid Jan. My last bill claimed we used 158 gallons I don't understand how I can be using so much. I keep the house at 67 degrees during the morning and early evening. During work hours, the house is at 64 and overnight it is 62. The house was built in 2001, so there is sufficient insulation and we have double-pane windows. My gas oven broke in early Jan., so we have not been using it. The hot water heater is kept at a reasonable temp. I just don't understand. Does anyone have any ideas?

20070820104857AA3KT6O	Home & Garden;Garden & Landscape	Is there any way to bring back a eucalyptus tree that appears completly dead?	Leaves just started drying and dying............I'm not sure if we weren't watering it enough, or giving it enough sunlight, maybe a combination of both.  But if I just watered the crap out of it and stuck it in the sun, could there be a posibility of new life?  I'm not sure how long they can remain dormant, and I hate to toss them if there's any chance of saving them.  They're not completely dry, I tried to snap of a branch and it still seemed springy.  It could just have been the way a eucalyptus dries though.......any help would be appreciated.
