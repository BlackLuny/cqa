I don't think this is available in the PH.<br>  <br>  Novatel Wireless MiFi<br>  <br>  Why hunt for a hotspot when you can carry one in your pocket? Novatel's slender, cigarette-case-size MiFi lets you build a portable Wi-Fi network around a high-speed 3G cellular connection. You can share a single mobile broadband account among multiple users and/or devices, whether you're at home, in a hotel room or in some dark region of the world where even a Starbucks hotspot can't be found. (You will, however, have to supply your own lattes.) Available for EvDO Rev A and HSPA (GSM) networks from selected wireless carriers, as yet unannounced.<br>  <br>  Available: By midyear<br>  <br>  Price: $200+|`|Kr2TIUsAaa	You can find Wifi hotspots abroad.

However unless you have $1000 to spend you might want to choose the altec-lansing speakers for computers.|`|AA11056614	You can't really tell from the specs alone. You can't even tell from price. For example Bose are high price but mediocre quality (despite what the other respondent claims).<br>  <br>  That said, more power is generally better. If there is a listed frequency response the broader the range and the flatter the response (indicated in the form "x-z,000 Hz, + or - y dB"). Signal to noise ratio is better as high as possible (form "x dB"). If distortion is listed (rare) it should be low.<br>  <br>  The problem is that power doesn't directly equate with sound quality or loudness, frequency response is rarely accurate (even if listed) or even meaningful in real life terms, signal to noise is usually low with all but the worst speakers, and distortion is rarely listed (and even then needs interpretation).<br>  <br>  The best way to pick computer speakers is to a) listen, and/or b) read reviews from a source you can trust. See the link for one listing.

Unless your friend wants to keep the music on her IPhone, she can''t do it. The deal is, if you sync any Apple product with ITunes, you can't sync with another computer.

F5fIBGCraa	Without writing an entire book about battery technology, a basic cell consists of two dissimilar metals submerged in an acidic liquid or paste solution.  The resultant chemical action provides an electrical voltage capable of supplying energy for a period of time.  Due to chemical composition, some combinations are reversible (rechargeable) while others are permanently depleted.<br>  <br>  More than one cell constitutes a battery.  For that reason, a D cell is just that, a cell.  But a 9v battery actually consists of six 1?V cells.<br>  <br>  Various combinations of substances (metals, electrolytic solution, etc) provide different voltages.  That's why carbon-zinc cells produce 1.5v, while NiCd only produces 1.2v.  And lead-sulphur cells produce 2.3v.<br>  <br>  Alkaline batteries are basically the longtime carbon-zinc cells that use a more efficient (and a little more expensive) alkaline paste for the electrolytic paste.  Commonly, they are not rechargeable.<br>  <br>  NiCd, or Ni-cad, are nickel-cadmium cells, and are rechargeable.  Due to the buildup of cadmium crystals during usage, heavy-duty NiCd's often required complete discharge and recharge to break down the crystals to undo "voltage memory".  Rarely was it a problem with light-duty cells such as used in consumer products.  Still, NiCd's have been replaced with the more efficient NiMh (nickel-metal hydride) cells that are not susceptible to such problems.  Contrary to popular belief, deep discharge and recharge are NOT good for the overall life cycle of rechargeable batteries.<br>  <br>  And lastly, lead acid batteries (or lead-sulphur) are another rechargeable type of battery.  This is truly called a battery as it consists of six 2.3V cells to make up your car's 12V battery (13.8V in an unloaded condition).  Again, deep discharge is not good for the extended life of your car's battery.

Although i am explaining you reliable source for mobile information. <a href="http://www.infibeam.com/Mobiles/" rel="nofollow">http://www.infibeam.com/Mobiles/</a> , <a href="http://www.mobileindiahub.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.mobileindiahub.com/</a> here you can find information, news, reviews on latest mobile phones. So you can take decision easily.<br>  <br>  I hope my information will be helpful to you.<br>  <br>  Best of luck
BhNP2P8Xaa	I've had my G1 since October. I love it. the phone does everything I want, and I love the way it syncs with Google apps (mail, contacts, calendar). You don't need to saddle yourself with Windows apps or other crap to use this. <br>  <br>  By the way, you will need a Google account just to get the phone set up, so you may want to create one on line ahead of time.<br>  <br>  The keyboard is great. Your hands have to get a little adjusted to holding it because of the flip screen and where the base of the phone is located, but it's pretty easy. They phone also had an SD card slot, so you can load up a ton of music and use it as an mp3 player.<br>  <br>  These are the only drawbacks:<br>  <br>  1. The battery life can really suck if you run a lot of stuff on it all the time. i turn mine off during the day because of where I work, so it's not a big deal to me. However, the android folks are working on updates that will improve battery life, and you can usually work around the battery issues. All phones like the G1 and the iPhone have this problem, so it's not unusual.<br>  <br>  2. If you want to use headphones, you have to use an adapter to plug them into the USB port. There is no standard headphone jack. They give you an adapter with a long cable, but you can pick up a short one on line for a couple of dollars.<br>  <br>  3. The camera is nice, 3.2 MP, but it has no built-in flash. I have a very expensive digital camera, so this wasn't a big deal for me, since I rarely use the phone camera anyway.<br>  <br>  I've owned Palms and Blackberries, as well as regular phones. I love the G1 most of all.
b536895bf6c779e662d180730661813faa	Starting? That doesn't really matter it all depends on the duration of your selling days,but I say monitor your prices, or make a fake account to help you boost the price at times. On ebay, the 3G 16GB brand new, unlocked can easily go for upwards of $500 American. Spend some time on a layout (or rip it off someone else) and let the bidding begin.<br>  <br>  Haha did you want to sell me one of these cheap phones?<br>  Can't get them that cheap here :(
GlnwRR4waa	Im not sure how to answer this...<br>  <br>  if you bought them from a shop like Game, then take it in to them, and show them, they may be able to fix it.<br>  <br>  but if they cant fix it, it might come with a warranty, so you can always contact the manufactorers.<br>  Hope this helped.|`|Xt31HyvWaa	To stop this happening again only charge through a surge protected socket you can purchase theses from---www.argos.co.uk----
kA55GdQoaa	honestly no  not really try to make some money off of it sell it to people at school advertise it the most they will give you at game stop is like 5 dollars they wont even post up a amount on gamestop.com  so i would rather you go to your friends who don't have the game or some one that isnt your friend and just advertise either way the games are pretty old and you can sell em for maybe 10 or 15 bucks  cause all gamestop will do is give you 5 dollars to sell it for 30. these are corporations we are talking about and they are not really interested in  losing money.<br>  <br>  good luck bro hope you take my advice and make some money off of the games and buy your self something great.|`|pl2SocVKaa	i think blockbuster does but its worth selling at gamestop they only take 10% off when assking for money so if its 20$ it will only be 2$ they take from you so yeah its worth selling and you should get at least 50$|`|GlnwRR4waa	Ebay is a good choice, because if you sell them to the shop, the wont give you cash, they will just give you a gift card, meaningly you will have to spend it in there shop.<br>  <br>  Or if you are up to it you can sell them easily at a car boot sale.|`|Xt31HyvWaa	nether give you much money so either sell them on www.ebay.com or swap with friends.|`|2y4f7Fbiaa	Not really coz they dont give u too much money for 'em<br>  its better to trade or swap with ur friends<br>  or u can try selling 'em on ebay/amazon if u want to get more money<br>  hope this helps :]

Ns6I7MmBaa	A regular ethernet cable is called a "patch" cable.  A crossover cable is called a "crossover" cable.  Get a different color (like red or yellow) than your other cables, or mark it with tape, so you can keep track of it, since you cannot easily tell by looking at it.<br>  <br>  It is sort of like a null modem serial cable in that TX on one end is RX on the other (and RX to TX), so it can work full duplex for 2 PC's connected directly together.|`|BhNP2P8Xaa	<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethernet_crossover_cable" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethernet_cr...</a><br>  <br>  You can't tell a crossover cable by looking at it.

The only difference is inside cable. The way the wires are connected inside is different. <br>  <br>  Take one end of cable. You will see that thin wire of different colors are connected to the pins of the RJ-45 socket. Identify the color of the first wire (at pin 1) . Now take the other end of the cable. The color you saw should be on the third position on this end.

A lot of the time, you can even fix the fault yourself, though I only recommend trying if your box is outside of warranty.<br>  <br>  You can actually check what the fault is, by the number of lights flashing on the console. I have provided a link which explains in detail what to look for.<br>  <br>  If you want even more explicit diagnosis, by holding down the controller sync button and pressing the eject button when the console is running, you can get the 360 to output a code which you can check against a list of known faults. Once again, they're all in the link, a little lower down the page (Secondary Error Codes).

wpeInOLzaa	you're right. honestly there is nothing all that special about the phone. I have it myself. the thing to remember is that boost mobile's phones (and all prepay phones for that matter) are "unsubsodized",  meaning that they don't re-coup the cost of the phone from your monthly bill - with post-pay, you are paying 3-5% of your bill to pay for that phone that was next to nothing or free. it is a nice phone though, and the camera quality is pretty decent, 3.2 mp.

ISO 1600 images that are actually useable, these are much better than ISO 1600 images from a pocket digi cam or super zoom models. I read alot of reviews about entry level DSLR's before buying. I chose the Nikon because I believed it is a better overall camera than the Sony DSLR's. The lens autofocus motor is very quiet, and the kit lens image quality is very good. The camera shoots multishot at 3 FPS, full 10mp images. Nice for amateur sports shooting, probably a bit slow for professional sports shooting but to get that capability you would pay alot more. <br>  <br>  I am very happy with this camera. <br>  <br>  Highly recommend you for this kit.<br>  Nikon D60 Digital SLR Camera with Accessory Kit<br>  KIT INCLUDES 8 PRODUCTS -- All Brand New Items with all Manufacturer-supplied Accessories + Full USA Warranties: <br>  <#1> Nikon D60 Digital SLR Camera & 18-55mm VR Zoom Lens<br>  <#2> Transcend 16GB HC SecureDigital Class 6 (SDHC) Card<br>  <#3> Spare EN-EL9 High-Capacity Lithium-Ion Battery Pack<br>  <#4> Nikon SLR System Case<br>  <#5> Precision Design USB 2.0 High Speed SecureDigital (SD/SDHC) Card Reader<br>  <#6> Digital Image Recovery Software<br>  <#7> Precision Design Memory Card Storage Wallet<br>  <#8> Cameta Microfiber Cleaning Cloth <br>  <br>  Price: $579.95 + $18.95 shipping<br>  reference: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Nikon-D60-Digital-18-55mm-Accessory/dp/B001JDL8M6/ref=pd_cp_p_2?pf_rd_p=413862901&pf_rd_s=center-41&pf_rd_t=201&pf_rd_i=B00154KTXI&pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&pf_rd_r=1G82T2NVFY08B3XRYFRW&tag=commentglitte-20&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=9325" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/Nikon-D60-Digital-...</a><br>  <br>  Hope that help.

Don't worry, your PS3 is within the one year warranty so call their number and ask them what they can do...<br>  <br>  But back up all your data on the PS3 hard drive because sometimes the laser is beyond repair so they must send you a refurbished one and that one has a new, blank hard drive.

xbQhnEzuaa	jailbreaking your ipod does void your warranty. but u can always restore it back to its original state. jailbreaking a 2nd gen ipod touch isnt worth it at this moment. i jailbroke my one, its a 16 gig 2nd gen with a 2.2.1 firmware, and i ended up restoring back because the 2nd gen jailbreak that is out right now is a tethered one. if you take off your ipod after jailbreaking it it wont be able to power back on. unless you connect back to your computer and follow the step that u did when u jailbroke it. plus it can cause some major problems. It would be better to just wait until a good jailbreak is out. when it does. then i'll jailbreak my ipod again.|`|aq0wOb6Waa	it does void your warranty but i dont think they can break it since its legally yours|`|0vsvd3YKaa	jailbreaking does indeed void your 1 year apple warrenty.<br>  Don't worry, apple can't catch you :P they know that people jailbreak their ipods all the time, and its impossible for them to break in to your ipod

Of course this was a major upgrade. It's great to have the speaker, which isn't that loud at the highest volume, if I just want to listen without earbuds. The volume control on the side is also a great feature. It's fun to have the applications. I love how I can download apps or songs directly onto the iPod via wifi. Then when I connect it to iTunes, the apps and songs are backed up. <br>  <br>  My only issue is not being able to use my old iPod car charger. It can only be charged with the usb cable. Luckily it has a battery life for up to 36 hours audio or 6 hours video. <br>  <br>  Overall, I think it's a fun gadget to have.

A7WMlKWeaa	Well, when it said a month free of rhapsody, it didnt mean downloading songs.

WmcXsIrhaa	When you don't have a jailbroken ipod touch the only apps you can install onto it are ones created by Apple. After you jailbreak it you basically get an application called "Cydia." This app is exactly like the app store on your ipod. But instead of apps from apple, you get apps created by people all over the world! These apps allow you to change  the sounds your ipod makes, change the way it looks, allows you to connect to it from your computer and add files to it manually, all sorts of stuff. And when I say you can change the way it looks, I mean everything, instead of sliding that little block to unlock it, you can make it looks like pacman! Or you can make it so you tap the bar instead. Or change the backround, the pics inside each little app, the volume bar, the volume icon, you really can change the way everything looks. It basically unleashes the full potential of your ipod, and in the end makes you want to pick up your ipod when you go somewhere a lot more.|`|ejGB0Thfaa	You can get third-party apps.

930a625eb301aae633a9b9d8e18e0752aa	The tab is koodo's form of a contract, and discount. You get $150 off the price of the phone initially, but you pay it back. A percentage of your bill goes towards paying off the tab. If you cancel your contract while you still have some owing, you pay it back instead of a early termination fee. You can also after a while have extra credit in your tab and get additional discounts on phone. You can pay for the whole cost of the phone, so in this case 224.99 plus tax, not have a tab and cancel anytime without having any extra fees when you do. <br>  It is a good deal. I have koodo and I couldn't be happier. It's an offshoot of telus, but with their own customer service, and cheaper rates. I'd check at Wal-Mart for their pricing on the same phone though. They have specials on phones that can work out cheaper. I got my husband the shine at Christmas, we had extra money in the tab and ended up paying only $7 for it, where it would have been $56. at London Drugs, or $50 at London Drugs.

You download a software from their website and sign up. For it to be free, the person you are calling also has to be registered with Skype. You can call someone who doesn't use Skype on their regular phone, but there is a charge then. So, you need to coordinate getting both parties signed up.<br>  <br>  I have used Skype once to talk to someone in Finland. We talked easily for an hour. The quality of sound was fine... and no charge. The downside is when you are signed up, you start getting emails from people all over the world who want to talk to you on Skype... and most of them seem to be looking for sex.

42179704f68b09bf27cb0b25a718c620aa	That's like asking how fast can a car go on the highway?<br>  <br>  It depends. The 9600 is a mid-level card (being a more expensive version of the 8600).<br>  <br>  As for a CRT, yes you should be able to use it just fine...now, if you're saying you want to upgrade FROM the 19" CRT...you should have no problems.<br>  <br>  It's not the detail settings that you'll have issues with, it's the RESOLUTION you'll have problems with. The more screen real estate you want, the more the card is driven. I've seen bench tests for 27" monitors next to 24" monitors that had higher figures because the smaller screen was set to a higher screen resolution setting. <br>  <br>  The best thing to do is keep the screen size reasonable. After all...a 20" monitor 18 inches from your face gives a better picture, and has a better RESOLUTION than a 52" monitor across the room.<br>  <br>  In any case, if you are going to upgrade...make sure you also patch your drivers. I believe nVidia has put out a couple (2? 3??) driver patches since the 9600 came out well over a year ago.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!

cc030d61dc9bcfd7d41ed6138df0d0b1aa	it helps a little<br>  it mostly helps with the videos|`|AA11256390	Yes it will help, your camera has an inbuilt buffer memory which allows for taking continuous shots but the quicker it can then write them to the memory card the more shots can be taken in a row. For example a camera that can take 10 shots per second will more than likely freeze if it can't write them to the memory card quick enough because there's not enough buffer memory to take anymore.

q3lzWKkXaa	Unlike the 'Airtel Live' WAP connection, such third party applications require a full packet data connection like GPRS or 3G. You'll need to activate Airtel's 'Mobile Office' GPRS service on your phone for that purpose. To do this, dial *#567# and follow the USSD menu and the 'Mobile Office' GPRS service will be activated instantly. After activation, restart your phone and save the settings you recieve. If you don't recieve any settings, SMS 'MO' to the toll-free number, 52567. After that, save the settings. Then, goto 'Menu' and select 'Settings' -> 'Configuration' -> 'Prefered access point' -> 'Mobile Office'. After that, those third party applications should work perfectly.<br>  -<br>  Charges and info:<br>  >Service activation- Free of charge.<br>  >Monthly rent- No monthly rent.<br>  >Data carrier charges- 30 paise/50 KB.<br>  >Accessiblity- All sites.<br>  >WAP Proxy- Not available.<br>  >Service type- GPRS.<br>  -<br>  NOTE: It might require many tries for the activation of the service or access to the USSD service (I had to try 12 times to get it done!).

pgRUuPJsaa	There's no better answer here. They both bring different things to the table. Both the N86 and N97 are slated to be released later on this year (soon) in Europe. No word on NAM version release dates yet.<br>  <br>  The N86 will be Nokia's new flagship imaging device. 8 megapixels is high for a phone, yes, and not as high as other new phones announced recently such as the Sony Ericsson Idou. That phone has 12 megapixels I believe. But don't be fooled by this megapixel nonsense; while it does say something about how large the photo is resolution-wise, it doesn't say ANYTHING about quality. The new camera in the N86 has auto-focus, a larger aperture and other camera nonsense that I don't fully understand; but I have friends who are experts in the field of photography, and they told me that by far the N86 has the most advanced camera of any phone they've ever heard of. Nokia has put a lot of blood, sweat, and tears into the new N86; its ruggedly built by adding metal trimmings, just like the N97. The sliding form factor of the N86 is also a plus for some people; I prefer the N86 over the N97, personally.<br>  <br>  The N97 is a communications mobile computing device. It comes with a large touchscreen and a slide out QWERTY keyboard. It's a very nice device; it will be the first to incorporate the new widget interface on the home screen. The widgets can basically do anything if someone develops it; there are facebook widgets, weather, and other widgets that will give you one-touch access to their full functions on the home screen. It'll also run S60 5th edition, the latest version of S60 optimized for touch screens. The N97 also has a unique widescreen aspect ratio; it's more widescreen than the iPhone or G1. It's true widescreen in that sense. Let's be clear though, the camera is not as good on the N97 compared to the N86. <br>  <br>  Each device will do it's own thing. I love the dual slider format of the N86, and I really want to be able to take decent pictures with my phone. Also, it's cheaper than the N97. Honestly, if you gave me either phone I'd be happy. If I were to purchase one, it'd be the N86. More practical for me.|`|fsrojbgQaa	Well not everyone has that much money|`|kposhq84aa	The N97 is better. The N97 is coming out in around march and it is supose to be better then the iphone. Faster, More efficient, and much easier to use. It's going to have accelerometer which is different from iphone because this time it will turn on anything. That means that u could be on settings and u want to turn it, now u can. N97 has 1 flaw though; it doesn't have app's like iphone which makes it not as fun. But it's going to have a qwerty board which allows u to press in things easier. Also the N97 is said to have a larger battery life and flash player and internet browser and wifi allowing u to have complete control on anything on the internet.

AA11256390	The only thing I can think of... Is your camera more powerful than the last and on top of that how many pictures are you trying to send? One or both of these factors may affect you trying to send. The camera being a bigger MP will mean the file sizes are larger with that and if you are trying to send a few at a time might preventing Yahoo! from being able to send them. Try sending individual files ie. one picture per email and see if that works. Even if it's not a more powerful camera it could still be that too many files is stopping it form working. It being a new camera shouldn't affect at all whether you can send them via email. Hope that works for you.|`|SY9OaAwbaa	just attach the photo file and all will be well|`|e871c3bc7828a54588e8b88635cfba63aa	Are you able to send mail without photos to your friends?

5VQrGtIIaa	The Wii and the PS3 are just the begining of interactive systems which have the ability to use motion.  In the coming years I think you will see more and more games that use this feature.  However it is a completely new type of programming.  That is why the only good games that use it seem to be directly from Nintendo or Sony.  That's cause they understand all of the programming aspects of their systems.  Third party programmers just write code and encode it for the system of choice.  So I would wait until it becomes more main stream.  Whether or not it comes out for the Wii or the next system down the line.  Think of the progression from the single atari style joystick to todays game pads.  Give it time.|`|ca1o8Ylsaa	no I like my wii a lot better than my ps3 that has nothing but dust.|`|Is3pmbbKaa	I enjoy playing Wii.<br>  I didn't read your paragraph because I have a feeling it's just nonsense ranting.|`|bVuqLJjJaa	Well i have the xbox 360 and the wii but i think the xbox360 is more fun but i still enjoy my wii so no i don't think Nintendo ripped us off|`|BjDBXyROaa	No not really but i think  3rd parties are thinking wii owners are stupid and try to rip them off with lame porly done games, and give the other systems awsome well done games it worked at first but now....|`|jtjISk6qaa	i love my wii.|`|N2rntAqvaa	I love my Wii.  But I understand what you are saying, since I also get stuck in this situation.  The Wii has many games, but a big pile of them cost less then 50$ (which means they are probably crappy)<br>  but some are AMAZING.  Have you tried the game: The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess?  If not, then I think you will be thinking about selling your Wii soon...  But the game, and you will see how good a Nintendo exclusive can be.  It also has movement in it, so don't worry.  <br>  The Xbox 360 and PS3 are consoles for people who most likely are fans of blood and violence.  They do have some good games for everyone though.  Nintendo likes to focus on the console for "everyone" so that everyone will buy it.  They don't really care about graphics that much since "everyone" don't look for that in a fun console.  The PS3 and Xbox 360 have great graphics, but most people that buy them are from the age 13+.  The others simply get the Wii.  I sometimes wanted to get a PS3, but I said screw it.  I can't afford it (bought the Wii instead) and don't feel like sitting on the couch rather then moving in the Wii Sports.<br>  <br>  Try gamestop, they have some pretty good games for the Wii.|`|JRRsjByCaa	wii is awesome.<br>  and it isn't supposed to be anything like xbox or ps3, its a total different kind of systen, hence why the games are mostly geared to a younger age group. i love wii and there are tons of really fun games, but there is also garbage games like other systems have also. if you like multiplayer games then i'd say just stick to xbox.|`|PhTKb3JUaa	With most things, they will gradually get better.  It's not because they don't have the technology, it's because they make more money this way.<br>  <br>  It bothers me I have to buy a somewhat thick GPS for my car.  They could make those things paper thin if they wanted too.  I guess I'll have to wait a couple years and buy ANOTHER one.|`|lJdrAzm5aa	yeah, it is a bit of a rip off. like, why would someone sit home alone and play tennis on tv when they could just go to the tennis court and play tennis.<br>  <br>  the xbox360 has better games also.|`|h4zlYkcwaa	I think they will keep it a "family" system (unfortunately)<br>  I agree, starfox for wii would be great|`|dYK1KPp4aa	The Wii is a wonderful system. You just have to be in the right mood for it.|`|Y78nbBosaa	Wii RULEZ!!|`|hwaTOBL7aa	I personally think the ps3 blows and the Xbox 360 is good but I like the Wii the best.|`|140d2cb6f23e38d9b4af65f92993c60faa	No... There's lots of good games.  You just have to open to things that aren't always bloodly and gory.<br>  <br>  Some really good ones<br>  Super Smash Bros Brawl<br>  Mario Kart Wii<br>  Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess<br>  Metriod Prime 3<br>  Animal Crossing Wii<br>  <br>  you don't always have to use motion.. when i play brawl or mario kart i just use the gamecube controller<br>  <br>  they COULD have invested in making better graphics.. i heard that they're gonna for the next one<br>  <br>  Note: A lot of the people who like the Wii are girls.  I've never seen so many of my fellow females get into videogames.  Like 5 years ago, it was me and a bunch of guys playing.. now, the gender demographic is more even.. nintendo has good marketing skills|`|7ydnDQl2aa	I love the wii!|`|1xr6T6h0aa	I love my WII, but I am female and like trivia games, racing games, and of course... my Wii Fitness (use it everyday).|`|9Z7Pl9fcaa	My Wii just got knocked off the 5 foot high shelf the other day. My cat got tangled in the wire :(|`|ZPVOzl8naa	no|`|L2Tvu7VLaa	Nintendo had a goal to make something unique as well as something that everyone could enjoy. The fact that my mother who hasn't played any video game since Dr. Mario, and my friend who is a game tester for a living both have a Wii and play all the time makes me think they accomplished their goal. <br>  <br>  Another aspect of the Wii is that you can download almost every game ever created for any Nintendo system directly onto the Wii. So in escense you have every Nintendo system created in one small box. So if there is a game you love on the Super NES and totally miss, add that to your colection. :D <br>  <br>  I do know what you mean about not have the type of games your looking for. But I have been an avid Nintendo gamer for the majority of my life and know that they do usually eventually hit everything people want. Just not always right away. One thing that should realize is the fact that Nintendo systems tend to last much longer than others (I own nitnedo systems older than me and play them all the time without a problem, I have friends with 6 month old Xbox 360's that have broken down completly) so even if they haven't come out with your favorite games yet they have plenty of time to develope them before your system try's to act up. So don't think they won't come out with more games for you. it's simply a matter of time. :D

AA11307345	If you have a certain Windows version, you may see in a small font that says Continue Anyways. If you don't try my other idea:<br>  1. Go to My Computer.<br>  2. Find the root of your PSP (E:/, F:/ etc)<br>  3. Right click the folder and select Properties.<br>  4. On the bottom right side, you might see a button that says Unblock.<br>  5. Click the button and continue.<br>  <br>  You may have a region encoded PSP (meaning it was not made by Sony) or have something wrong with it. If you could post the PSP specs, it would be useful.<br>  <br>  Good luck!
uctxzjIIaa	Unfortunately, you are out of luck. Composite (the standard yellow/red/white) and S-Video (the big round black one that looks liek a miniature microphone cord) cannot do Progressive Scan; you have to have Component (Red/Green/Blue with White and either black or another red) cables for that.<br>  <br>  The original Gamecubes (DOL-001) had two video ports on the back: one for the Component cables, and the other for Composite or S-Video. After a few years, Nintendo redesigned parts of the internal workings (DOL-101) and , as a result of their research which showed them that few people were using Component (probably because you had to buy them directly from Nintendo), removed the Component port from the back of the system, effectively eliminating Progressive Scan from all further Gamecubes.<br>  <br>  <br>  You probably could find a DOL-001 used at any of the major video game specialty stores. Or if you are wiling to splurge a bit, a Wii is always an option.

0DYvcX6gaa	Computer speakers have amplification to them which head phones don't.  Get amplification, get louder volume. Maybe think about getting a dedicated yet small sound system for your computer into which you'd plug your headphones into.

You CANNOT take the battery out of the iPhone, and if you manage to do so, you've got to use a screwdriver and can mess things up even more.<br>  <br>  The answer to your question is to try to do a reset of the iPhone. Press and hold the sleep wake button and the home button (sleep wake button is by the headphone jack) Press those two together until you see a ''slide to power off'' ignore that and the phone will automatically shut off. Then wait a minute or so and press the sleep wake button, the phone should restart it's self and be working fine again.<br>  <br>  Hope I helped|`|sRNgJ0e5aa	or with the restart, you can just keep holding until it turns on again|`|kFE7wL8taa	take out the battery.

RsjPhDoMaa	Well the c903 has a one hour longer talk time than the c902 and it also has gps, a tv output and is HSCSD supported (high speed circuit switched data, it improves the GSM net by like 5 times). The c903 is not as long as the the c902 but it is thicker and just as wide. Another good thing about the c903 is that it has scratch resistant glass.<br>  <br>  I mean the c903 is a better phone. It also has walkmate, youtube and a tracker, which the c902 doesn't have. <br>  <br>  If you are going to choose between them then take the c903 unless the price difference is bigger than lets say 40 euros.

You can also highlight everything else then right click and copy it to your collection. You can do the same for all of the other categories.
eAhz7Hptaa	Never heard of this one! Not very nice of you to destroy your aunt's records. Maybe the scratching sound reminds you of the swishing sound pantyhosed legs make when they slide along each other.

sdv81QXfaa	Experimentation is key.  However, it just so happens I can also give a few pointers.  In tennis, the timing of your swing can determine which direction (left or right) the ball will veer toward.  Example, if the ball is coming on your left side, and you swing early, it'll go right, and if you swing late, it'll go left.  In bowling, as you "roll the ball down the lane," twist your wrist, and the ball will get spin in the direction you twist your wrist.  Twist it as you are swing, not before or after.  As for baseball, use the directional pad to change where the ball will pass the plate, and hold A, B, or A and B to throw different kinds of pitches.  For swinging, all I can recommend is try to determine where the ball will come, and swing there.  I never play boxing so I can't help with that.  And as for golf, I do play that often, and I enjoy it, but I don't know of any tips or tricks to help you out there.  I may have fun playing it, but I'm not actually very good at the golf game.|`|i81cQUyhaa	Wii Sports is a great Game. Just play,you will get better and better. Welcome to the Wii community

Also, there is a wider range of games for PS2|`|CckCvJpyaa	It is totally your choice, ps1 they don't sell anymore although you may be able to buy one on amazon or ebay,the same as the ps1 games you can only buy them on the internet The ps1 nowadays has awful graphics because its around about twenty years old.  The playstation 2 is much better it has really good graphics and loads of better games and you can buy it now for about 90 pounds.  But the best of the lot is of course the playstation 3, it has outstanding graphics and you can watch blu ray dvds, serf the internet, listen to music but it is very expensive, it is totally your choice.|`|596N0bRXaa	ps2 of course ps2 can play ps1 games|`|BgClmJb8aa	you can play PS1 games on PS2, and you can get a PS2 for really cheap now, and I reckon they'll stop seeling playstation 1 games soon<br>  <br>  So just get a PS2<br>  <br>  Edit: ignore the guy below, they still make games for the PS2, but probably not for much longer|`|SY9OaAwbaa	<a href="http://shop.ebay.co.uk/items/__ps1_W0QQPlatform7397cc93ZSonyPlayStation1fab3fc38QQ_dmptZUKQ5fPCQ5fVideoQ5fGamesQ5fVideoQ5fGamesQ5fJSQQ_flnZ1QQ_ssovZ1QQ_trksidZp3286Q2ec0Q2em282" rel="nofollow">http://shop.ebay.co.uk/items/__ps1_W0QQP...</a><br>  <br>  heres the ps1, look, only 15 quid for a ps1 and a hellova lotta games.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://shop.ebay.co.uk/items/_W0QQPlatform7397cc93ZSonyPlayStation2fab3fc39QQ_dmptZUKQ5fPCQ5fVideoQ5fGamesQ5fVideoQ5fGamesQ5fJS?_nkw=ps2+console&_sacat=0&_fromfsb=&_trksid=m270.l1311&_odkw=ps1&_osacat=0" rel="nofollow">http://shop.ebay.co.uk/items/_W0QQPlatfo...</a><br>  <br>  heres the ps2<br>  <br>  not a whole lot of difference price wise, so id go for the ps2.<br>  <br>  bear in mind they are both obsolete and youll be lucky to get any games which arnt second hand.|`|xwEPYEqSaa	If you can afford it get a PS3 you can play PSone and PS2 games AND PS3 games on it.<br>  <br>  If you can't get it buy a cheap PS2 off eBay.|`|N2rntAqvaa	First of all, yes, you are absoluely right.  You can play PS1 games on a PS2.  So if you get a PS2, it's like owning both, with better graphics, and a DVD player.<br>  <br>  What I recommend getting is a PS2.  It has SO MANY good games.  <br>  And don't listen to all those people who say that they won't make PS2 games anymore, because they will, for at least 2 or 3 years.  After they stop making new games for it, they will just keep on selling games in a new condition.  After a year or two, they will keep selling USED PS2 games for a VERY long time.  So you got like 8 years of PS2 experience.  <br>  <br>  Now about the PS1:<br>  It has horrible graphics, I don't think you want that.  <br>  They don't make games for it at all, and they don't even sell used games for it, at all.  The only place you can find PS1 games is online.  Which means eBay, Amazon, Craiglist, etc.<br>  <br>  Now, there are two kinds of PS2's, but they are basically the same.<br>  <br>  One is slim: <br>  <a href="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/419bnlIf6LL._SL500_AA280_.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41...</a><br>  <br>  One is BIG, but that doesn't change ANYTHING about the graphics, games, DVD, or anything at all.  The only thing bad about this one is that it is a little uglier, older, and takes up more space.<br>  Here's a picture:<br>  <a href="http://cyber.vflyer.com/4/images/1254166_main.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://cyber.vflyer.com/4/images/1254166...</a><br>  <br>  So, at Gamestop (probably the best local store that sells used and new video games)<br>  A used and SLIM PS2 costs 60$.<br>  A used and BIG PS2 costs 50$.<br>  A new PS2 costs 130$.<br>  <br>  There is also a silver PS2, which is EXACTLY the same as the Black PS2, but it's silver.  Different color.  That's it. Period.<br>  <br>  Getting a PS1 will be really bad, since it is REALLY old, and used (you can't find new ones anymore).  It will be very hard finding games for it, since they are not on local stores anymore.<br>  <br>  Get a PS2, and you got yourself a DVD player, better graphics, huge game library, and also a BETTER game library.<br>  <br>  If you get a PS1, it will probably break after a year, doesn't play PS2 games, doesn't have a DVD player (I think) and bad graphics.  Also hard to get games for it.<br>  <br>  You will never regret getting a PS2.|`|LzgFAVWjaa	yeah u can play ps1 games on a ps2, and you should prob get a ps2, i mean tho u can pick a ps1 up now for less than ￡20 a ps2has a dvd player andlots of other features plus you will have an easyer time finding the games|`|HcZppReOaa	Get a PS2.<br>  <br>  Don't listen to the douche bag claiming that no games are made for the PS2.<br>  <br>  There's still lots of games being made for the PS2.<br>  <br>  And PS1 games will work on PS2.|`|cjEZEyQVaa	get a PS2 because you can play PS1 games on it plus u can chip your PS2 and get games for free as your not well off...|`|TmDabvoIaa	if you can afford it, get hold of a ps2<br>  you get the best of both worlds cos all games will play on it.|`|YlU2J35Aaa	Get both for the fun of it then get a ps3 so you have all sonys consoles|`|oZgDxBTGaa	Get a PS2 dude!

They will give it to you for free, they did it for me, and they'll do it for you too.<br>  <br>  If your provider is with another else, call them and ask for the unlock code. If they don't give it to you, you can tell them that they are legally obligated to give it to you. There's actually legislation on this, you can Google it if you want. <br>  <br>  If they still won't give it to you, ask to speak with a manager. Keep calling back until you get the code. Or maybe you can come up with a good excuse for why you need the code like you have to go overseas because your parent died and you need this phone to keep in contact.<br>  <br>  If all these fail then you can try any of the vendors on Ebay.

AA12021966	T-Mobile has a plan that's appropriate for just about any budget. Your minutes and texts are 2 different things, so you can change one without changing the other (ie. if you decide that you need 1000 messages instead of 400, you can change that without changing how many minutes you have).

Q4NFFBizaa	go to the wireless stores in your area and start playing with the phones and then you can find which one is right for you. Every phone is different. Also while your there look at what type of plans they have for that phone. I mean if you get a blackberry your gonna want the data plan right? cuz whats the point of having a blackberry without the data plan? some touch screens don't work well with nails some do, some phones have music players but dont have good cameras. Some phones look small in pics and then when you handle it you will see it is a lot bigger. hope this helps nobody here can chose the right phone for you only you can do that.|`|00608a2a5e8db089ab395c966629cdd4aa	iphone is cheap. 200 dollars and it requires internet which is 30 dollars a month. the 30 dollars is going to be about the price for internet on every carrier|`|xaKgiwUeaa	i have the samsung glyde it has all of those things, and its $120.00 from verizon, i got mine there for $70.00 because my dad had a discount because of where he works|`|TxIsbB4maa	LG Rumour.|`|rZUThLfMaa	Lg EnV2

The answer depends on the room. I little trick is to put the sub where your seated and then move around the room listening to hear where the bass is best. That spot is where the sub should go. This tends to put it in a place that you don't really want it (in the middle of the floor, for example) but you can then choose the closest location that does fit your needs.

It is a short term fix for the problem you have.  But you can activate it and not have any problems.  Just make sure it is the same carrier you use.  And before you get it call customer service and make sure the phone is not listed as stolen or missing.  it is fairly simple to get a new phone activated to replace yours on your account and customer service should be able to help you with no problems.<br>  I know you have your ringtones and stuff so maybe you could try a site named www.phonezoo.com.  You can get songs for free there (as well as pictures).  Again short term fix for the pawn phone for you<br>  When you can upgrade take in your messed up phone for them to get the info off of.  I would also maybe look for a different store to go to if you don't trust them.  You have a little while to look around and even go into a new store to see how the reps take care of other customers, plus you can look at some phones you might upgrade to. I did this when i was going to get my new phone.  I told them I was just looking and then observed them with other customers.  In the store i finally picked the rep said ok let me know if I can help  ( not pushy or in my face).  Then I got to overhear the reps talk to customers and see if they just told you what you wanted to hear or was it the same basic thing about the phone and then how it would benefit you and your needs.<br>  I hope this helps and good luck.

2ae80ff81188ccc128dfeb85edf626a8aa	"... my 3.2mp camera without night vision but it can still see the IR light..."<br>  <br>  Do you know for sure that your camera is sensitive to the near-IR spectrum? If you are then yes, but if you're not then no.<br>  <br>  Although CCD and CMOS sensors are sensitive to near-IR, most cameras have an IR cut-off filter in front of the sensor to block such light off. The absence of such a filter allows IR light, like that of an IR lamp, to pass through. The presence of such a filter will not allow that light to pass through.

Some other people I know tried to get a universal replace battery for the phone and they still had poor battery life. Its something about Kyocera branded phones, they all seem to have poor battery life. (the Switchback, the Wildcard, the Oystr, the Marbl, and the Tnt). Getting a replacement battery ($20) from Virgin Mobile, is more than the phone itself ($10). Although the  Oystr battery life is slightly better.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps =)

Nice design - Both are very nice looking, but I think the Zune is better. It's different, yet cool, and the iPod Classic has too much of a utilitarian look to it, and isn't as inviting.<br>  <br>  2. Hardware - Definitely Zune. The brushed aluminum backside is really scratch free (Apple uses the other scratch-prone aluminum back). The plastic front of the Zune has a nice solid texture. The Zune has a BIGGER glass screen. Makes video viewing great. <br>  <br>  3. UI - The user interface on the Zune is much more better and intuitive. The iPod Classic still uses that menu system where you have to keep "digging" in and out to get where you want. Zune one ups it by making it very easy to find what you want in one category, and gets you back to the home screen faster.<br>  <br>  4. Customizability - You can change the background of the menu(easy to identify and looks cool), get your Zune a nickname (you have to register, and hope noone else took it), get special laser engraving at Zune Originals ( <a href="https://zuneoriginals.net/" rel="nofollow">https://zuneoriginals.net/</a> ), cases, accessories, and the usual. <br>  <br>  5. FM Radio - You can catch radio talk shows, news, sports, radio contests, new music, and a bunch of other radio content with the FM Radio. You can also buy a song from a radio station, if there's RDS offered.<br>  <br>  6. WiFi - You can share songs and pictures with other Zune owners, wirelessly connect to your PC, access the Marketplace store, and instantly update your podcasts<br>  <br>  7. Software (computer) - I personally like to manage my music in the Zune software better. iTunes really looks like old spreadsheets compared to the Zune program. Again, the UI on the desktop software is pretty smooth, slick, and simple to go around. Nice transitions, and you can even change the background theme. Also, it uses LESS memory, so it's not as as bad on system resources.<br>  <br>  8. Store - iTunes does have more content, I'll admit. But the offerings on Zune aren't bad. It has almost all the tracks that iTunes has, and there's some TV shows and music videos offered (Increasing every week!). Browsing through Zune Marketplace is cool though! Popular artists have special pages and it looks really neat to browse through. Finding content is much more easier for me. You can also access the store on your device.<br>  <br>  9. Zune Pass - This is an optional way of getting music from the store. Instead of traditionally buying music, you can RENT music for $14.99 a month. You have access to almost all of the store's music tracks, and you can download as many tunes as you want onto your device. After a month, you do have to pay $14.99 to keep your subscription running, or else your songs don't work. But it's a great legal way to get tons of music, for a rather cheap price.If that's not your thing, each song cost 79 points each (99 cents). <br>  <br>  10. MixView - On the Zune software, there's this awesome visualization that comes up when you're playing a song.

xTioPxaVaa	I've owned both, and their both good.  Personally, I liked the Marshall a little better as in it had a little fuller lower midrange to my ears.  But, I was playing very blues based stuff like Gary Moore and Pat Travers with it.<br>  <br>  If you wanting the Metallica/Nirvana/Punk stuff, then I'd lean toward the DS1.  It's a little more piercing in the upper midrange, but that's a plus for what you want to play.<br>  <br>  Greetings from Austin, TX<br>  <br>  Ken|`|TXJLUEG7aa	Take the Boss. Being a guitar player in a band, I have used several different pedals. Boss is  the way to go. I own a Boss Flanger and it never lets me down.
RCbtRF4xaa	Here's how the Sony DSC-T77 breaks down: <br>  <br>  PROS: <br>  <br>  - Unbelievable build quality, the T77 has a truly solid metal case all the way around. You won't be breaking this baby any time soon. <br>  - Very small size, is actually much smaller than it looks in the pictures. <br>  - The touch screen works great for navigating and activating features. <br>  - Menu layout has the typical Sony complexity but follows their standard structure. If you know Sony's digital camera menus, you're good here. <br>  - Very bright flash. Incredible flash power especially for the size of the camera. <br>  - Good color saturation and nice widescreen pictures. I keep mine in 16x9 mode and the shots are great, clear, and highly detailed given the 10.1MP, one after the other. <br>  - The smile detection mode is fantastic. You essentially give control over picture taking to the audience once you go into this mode. Smile sensitivity can be adjusted and people are always amazed the camera can sense smiles and take shots automatically. <br>  - In-camera touch-ups are easy as can be, including adding smiles and removing red-eye. <br>  - Rear LCD preview screen is large and roomy, covering the entire rear of the camera. <br>  - Battery life is excellent despite the large rear preview screen, powerful flash, and other battery draining features. <br>  - The T77 has a generous array of accessories available. You can get an underwater camera housing, a variety of good cases, new batteries, extra storage, a digital dock and more. <br>  - Works great with 3rd party PictBridge printers and the T77 printed directly to my Polaroid portable printer with no issues. <br>  - I've had no issues with the zoom control. Some have reported it as being too small but I find that it's just fine and I've never had a problem. <br>  - Auto-orientation is one of the handiest features of this camera. Never have to rotate a picture again after downloading it to your PC or uploading it online. Sony isn't clear on how this is done but it must use a built-in accelerometer since it's pretty much 100% accurate. A big time saver since rotating lots of 10MP photos can really take time and was one of the big pains in picture processing workflow with older digital cameras. <br>  <br>  CONS: <br>  <br>  - The biggest problem by far is that the camera is so small it makes taking stable shots difficult sometimes. I often find that shake created while pressing the shoot button creates blurry pictures. You do have to *concentrate* not to shake the little T77 as you take pictures. <br>  - The slide down camera cover on the front is hard to slide down sometimes, especially in cold weather. It's not that it sticks, it just requires some serious pressing and pulling. The mechanism seems quite firm and is very rugged feeling so I don't worry about it wearing out due to the repeated stress however. <br>  - The on-screen menu stays on too long after initiating picture playing and I often have people stare quizzically at the screen when I hit the play button and show them the camera. A minor quibble but it comes up all the time. <br>  <br>  I can't stress enough how well built this thing is and what a joy it is to use. I'd buy it again in a heartbeat and is one of the best point-and-shoots available today in my opinion. <br>  <br>  Highly recommend this product.<br>  Sony Cybershot DSC-T77 <br>  Price: $199.99 free shipping<br>  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Sony-Cybershot-DSC-T77-Stabilization-Black/dp/B001CCJO8E/ref=dp_cp_ob_e_title_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1236522431&sr=1-1&tag=commentglitte-20&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=9325" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/Sony-Cybershot-DSC...</a>|`|aJGAXYUIaa	yes actually it is|`|UMRk2PoDaa	I heard that sony night shot sucks.
Dso7k3sjaa	You can try, but you will probably find that it won't work.  I know there are people who are smart enough to pirate the games so it must not be 'impossible' but EA uses Securom for the drm and it prevents you from being able to burn copies of the game -- even just a copy to keep as a backup for your own benefit -- which is supposed to be legal.|`|b588ea9ae577d8516ac0cfb6e137875baa	For copying cds/dvds you may need to install appropriate softwares.<br>  Try cd burner xp. It is free.<br>  <a href="http://cdburnerxp.se/download" rel="nofollow">http://cdburnerxp.se/download</a><br>  The process i believe can be figured out easily.<br>  <br>  If it is a pirated version of the game, then you just have to copy it and all is good. Otherwise you may need to download cracks from the net. It can be either a cd crack in which case you may need to insert the copied cd to play or a no-cd crack if you are lucky wherein you just have to install it and you can play after applying the crack.<br>  <br>  Beware, sites providing these illegal cracks are usually flooded with viruses. So do it with caution.
vkzkXWfzaa	No I'm afraid not. Your camera uses a small file to keep track of where on the card pictures and videos start and end. This file is not downloaded to your computer as it doesn't need that info. So when you upload it back to your camera, your camera can't 'see' it as it doesn't know where on the card to look. <br>  <br>  Chris
maOnda8Uaa	U can do this but you may ahve trouble puting them back on the camrea.. if u put them bak on the memory card itself then it shoudl be oki but u may not be able to view them on the camera itself although that may be just a fault on my cam....<br>  Or use a difrent memory card to take tot he rodeo??<br>  Or you could just dnt take out the me card and use the cameras own space to take pictures at the rodeo therfore when he loks itl jst be them piks cos the rest will be on ur card at home . Then simply put the card bak in after..?|`|82dfc8c5fdf36779ac231646803120f5aa	Yes, you get the usb wire connect it to you're camera then connect the other end to your computer.

oZqoxgc7aa	Nope, it's unavailable on Shop channel. Because  shop channel only offers VC (virtual console) games and WiiWare, you are not going to be able to get any published Wii titles on it. Wiiware is original content, typically from independant game makers. VC is strictly ports from other (older) systems.<br>  If you want to buy it, you should just go and buy it retail, if Wii were to offer it on Shop Channel, it would be 4500 points. You should be able to find a used copy of the game at Gamestop or EBgames for about $35-$40.<br>  That would even save you from having to buy 3x$20 cards for 6000 points.|`|oIcdt0FXaa	no sorry you can only buy it, Try and get it second hand from ebay or a friend as you will be able to get it cheeper
oZqoxgc7aa	It's one of the lengthier games in the Resident Evil franchise. Which is odd considering it was originally designed fot the GC.

oZqoxgc7aa	Austrailian systems use PAL games. Just look up any European games on Ebay.<br>  Given your situation though. For what it's worth I would recommend modding the console. Then you'll be able to run US games. If you are concerned about bricking the system, do a soft-mod. That way you can just change the region of your system to US. it will then be unable to play PAL games but it's easier than buying everything online and having the shipping and waiting time. PAL games are more expensive typically too, even before shipping.|`|3yNmclJgaa	I get my import games from www. xltrading.co.uk on the net - excellent prices and they export to other countries from the UK also :)|`|S6MQesQCaa	You can shop online from <a href="http://www.hotabuy.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.hotabuy.com</a><br>  Free shipping.

RUpd7JTqaa	Once you put the game on your hard-drive, it will automatically play from the hard-drive as long as the disc is in the 360, no matter how you start the game|`|brOCG7wcaa	I'll go through the whole process for you.<br>  <br>  When you install a game onto the Hard Drive, this puts the whole game onto it, but for security and copyright reasons, you have to put your game disc into the Xbox 360 for verification that you own the game, and thats all but even so, you cant take out the game once the Xbox has verified you are the owner or it quits the game like it would on disc.<br>  <br>  The benifits of this are good, in some games you'll get quicker loading times on some levels, areas, maps etc and you'll also cut down the noise the 360 makes because it doesnt have to spin the disc insanely fast, it also cuts down the amount of disc read errors you will get from a scratched disc or damaged.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.
RCbtRF4xaa	The best(for me) under $350,i recommend Canon Powershot SX10IS .<br>  So far I have taken around 600 pictures with the SX10 and have only one complaint. I am having trouble fine tuning the 'selecting ring'in SCN mode. I turn the dial and nothing moves and then all of a sudden it moves quickly to a selection I don't want and I have to begin again. I'm just not in control. However, the 20x zoom exceeded my expectations. I had originally wanted an Canon SLR just to use my measly 200mm zoom from my 35mm film Rebel, but this is much better for me (560mm w stabilization works well). I was also waiting for Canon to up their ISO ratings and by using the 3200 setting I was able to get some nice photos of Hula dancers and hope to do as well with indoor sport pictures. The 28mm wide angle lens is a plus I didn't know I needed until I began using the camera. I was able to properly frame many more single pictures than previously. <br>  <br>  Canon Powershot SX10IS 10MP Digital Camera with 20x Wide Angle Optical Image Stabilized Zoom<br>  Price: $339.94  free shipping<br>  reference: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Canon-Powershot-SX10IS-Digital-Stabilized/dp/B001G5ZTZO/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&s=photo&qid=1236523605&sr=1-3&tag=commentglitte-20&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=9325" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/Canon-Powershot-SX...</a><br>  <br>  if you want cheaper i suggest other.<br>  Canon PowerShot SD880IS <br>  10.0-megapixel resolution allows greater freedom when editing and printing <br>  4x optical zoom with Optical Image Stabilizer; 28mm wide-angle lens <br>  3.0-inch PureColor LCD II for bright, accurate color with wide viewing angle <br>  DIGIC 4 Image Processor improves Face Detection, adds Servo AF, Face Detection Self-Timer and Intelligent Contrast Correction <br>  Captures images to SD/SDHC memory cards <br>  Price: $239.00 + Free Shipping<br>  reference: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Canon-PowerShot-SD880IS-Stabilized-Silver/dp/B001G5ZTN6/ref=sr_1_8?ie=UTF8&s=photo&qid=1236523605&sr=1-8&tag=commentglitte-20&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=9325" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/Canon-PowerShot-SD...</a><br>  <br>  Hope that help.|`|aJGAXYUIaa	sony is the one that  i have and it is in the price range of $150 to 350

ckGHpMFmaa	You have 2 buy it|`|3yNmclJgaa	OK - first off you need a router with WiFi and a working internet connection.<br>  <br>  Then... you either purchase the Internet channel from Nintendo for 500 points OR... softmod your Wii using the Twilight Hack and then install the Internet Channel via WadManager.<br>  <br>  Simple :)|`|oZqoxgc7aa	Well the internet has to come form somewhere. I would say, use the wii, go through connection settings, see if there's an unsecured network that you can piggyback on. If so, connect to it. Once on the network, you have to get the internet channel, which is Opera's internet browser software with flash support. (Just like opera browsers on mobile devices but with the added Flash support) that will be 500points from the wii shop channel under "Channels".<br>  Once you've done that, you're good to go. The only problem is if the neighbor you steal bandwidth from likes to turn their router off, you will also lose your connection. Also if they are using a USB "Fingy" you'll have to be accepted onto their network and when they turn their machine off, once again you'll lose your connection.<br>  If you only see secured networks it's worth noting that many people don't know how to set them up, so try getting on using "admin", "password" or "1234" as possible passwords. These are some examples of defaults on many routers.|`|FwdYzU7faa	You have to buy it! With a wii points card or something it costs 500 wii points i think

3yNmclJgaa	It may be possible :)<br>  Check the source link.|`|oZqoxgc7aa	GTA games are not really suited to the Wii demographic according to sources at Rockstar games. They went as far as Bully Scholarship Edition, but to develop a game for Wii, they need to be confident it will sell. Because Wii uses a completely different control mechanism than any other system, it takes a lot more development. Also the GTA games of late have given much more of their emphasis to Graphics, High definition imagery and HUGE environments, none of which the Wii is suited to.<br>  Wii's only use DVD for their media, which means that essentially 9gb is as big as they can go. Also wii uses standard definition graphics therefore 520p is the best possible picture, and then that's only on PAL systems, US would bre limited to 480p.<br>  So in short, I really doubt the re;lease of a GTA title coming to Wii. Bully's going to be your best bet.|`|raEUval8aa	No. Nintendo has already had conversations with Rockstar.

kgTPnjhkaa	If you were looking for a fast paced action game, fighting off sharks and dueling with narwhals all while rescuing the damsel . in distress, try a different game. This game is slow paced, relying on it's exploration and massive game area to keep interested.<br>  <br>  You start play on the boat, choose where you want to go and dive there. The sheer volume of the play area is amazing. The controls are simple, point in the direction you want to go, and press B, with the occasional A to examine a fish or object. As you swim along, you may see a spot glowing. If you examine this you can find a rare fish, or if you are lucky, a piece of treasure.<br>  <br>  One important aspect of the game is the ability to pick a 'partner', an animal that you have befriended and will swim around with you. The partner will also find the glowing spots, which is hard to do on your own. There are several ways to interact with the fish and other animals you will encounter. You can poke them, pet them, feed them or even blow an 'underwater whistle'. You need to do this in order to learn about the fish. If you are nice enough, you can even have the fish follow you around for the rest of the dive, a nice little addition to the game.<br>  <br>  There isn't any incentive at all to use the camera to take pictures other than the odd request. The fact that you can only save 40 pictures in the first place only compounds the fact that the camera is sorely lacking from any real reason to use it.its not worth it don't buy it......

rOqbu14zaa	well i have both a wii and a nintendo ds, there are a wide variety of games for the ds and the wii,but I think you should get a nintendo wii because they are pretty cool..... umm.... OH! you can customize your own mii(a mii is a character that you create to look like you or anyone else) you can also have internet you can buy things on the internet(ie. games) the wii DOES have wifi connection and with the games you buy you can connect with other people that have wii's. im only 11 and i dont know how much you would like these games but i have my sims kingdom where you are the wandolier and you get  to build houses, complete tasks for people,and all around have fun!! I also have animal crossing city folk where you can invite friends over to visit your town, go fishing, catch bugs, ride the bus to the city,dig up fossils,go to other friends towns, there are special events, and sometimes people from other places (that are in the game already) come to your town to sell you things or ask you to do things for them. ( just to let you know, you have to have internet on the wii to have friends that have wiis come to ur house in animal crossing, and if you want to buy things on the internet ,you MUST have wii points which you can buy at best buy along with all of your other wii equipment!!)(I also have wii sprots which comes with the wii and the wii ONLY comes with ONE wii remote)well, thet about sums it up hope this helped!!! feel free to e mail me at ducky570773@yahoo.com if you have any more questions about the wii or the nintendo wii!!=)p.s. for animal crossing you can buy wii speak and when you invite your friends over, you can talk to them.|`|lhs3rkBFaa	wii. has more features and some what better games.|`|349e849aefd868c83f57e318b5cee8d2aa	wii i think its better cos you can have more fun with it|`|3FKMMoXkaa	wii is better get the wii definatly|`|UhnetgNkaa	I have a DS and its handier because you can being your games around with you and its great for those long travel journeys.|`|TU95i2R2aa	wii cause its more active and wen ur on the ds it gets boring cause ur just sat there but on the wii u can move round a lot more fun<br>  hope it helps!!|`|9LpP8HfQaa	wii.|`|OsHJ9Mcqaa	I have both but id definatly suggest the Wii!<br>  Its so much fun, i have the popular games (mario kart, wii fit etc) and seriously, they keep you entertained for hours!

Here's how.<br>  <br>  1) Try to get it replaced before you do his, as this will void your warranty even more. This is a last resort.<br>  <br>  2) Get some distilled water and completely submerge your phone in it. (if you can get it open, remove the battery)<br>  <br>  3) Change the water out every 2-3 hours. Do this for a total of 10-12 hours.<br>  <br>  4) Allow 48 hours to dry.<br>  <br>  This often works because most water damage to electronics isn't caused by water, but is caused by the impurities in the water, or whatever liquid your phone was in.

It takes amazingly crisp photos, and the low light capabilities are exactly what i was hoping for. <br>  <br>  The only negative that i have to say about the lens is just a result of using it with a D40. The lens is more like an 80mm on a D40, and because of that, is too much of a zoom to use in the instances i purchased it for. <br>  <br>  A D40/D60 will not auto focus this lens. I knew that before i purchased it, but its a bit more of a pain that i had thought it would be. Many times even though the focus light comes on, once i get the photos on my computer they are slightly out of focus. I often times find myself putting my kit lens back on there to avoid the problems... and only using this lens when i have plenty of time. <br>  <br>  I originally purchased this lens for portrait and 3/4 length shots. Due to the ~80mm equivilent on a D40, i have to get WAY back, and in an average size room dont cant get far enough back for a 3/4 or full length fashion type shot. <br>  <br>  Nikon is getting ready to release a 35mm f/1.8 lens, and even though its going to be around the $130 price range, i would recomend getting that instead. It will have a focus motor, and be much better suited for the DX cameras. <br>  <br>  Nikon 50mm f/1.8D AF Nikkor Lens for Nikon Digital SLR Cameras<br>  Price: $131.83  free shipping<br>  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Nikon-50mm-Nikkor-Digital-Cameras/dp/B00005LEN4/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&s=photo&qid=1236521278&sr=1-2&tag=commentglitte-20&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=9325" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/Nikon-50mm-Nikkor-...</a>|`|d55HYaktaa	For a normal lens (50mm equiv), you should get the new 35mm f/1.8 AF-S. It works like a 53mm lens on a 35mm camera.<br>  <br>  Or if you really want a short tele, the 50mm f/1.4 AF-S will work fine in the D40x, like a 75mm lens on a 35mm body. It would be great for portraitures.<br>  <br>  The 50mm f/1.4 AF-D and the 50mm f/1.8 AF-D will work in the D40x, but the autofocus will not work. You will need to use the manual focus. But the autofocus will work with 50mm f/1.4 AF-S and the 35mm f/1.8 AF-S.

Jn09dNMvaa	what kind of distortion are we talking here? <br>  <br>  there are more distortion pedals out there than i will ever be able to use. so you pretty much have to know what type of sound you want to narrow it down. <br>  <br>  light overdrive stuff is done really well with either a tubescreamer, or something like a Jeckyll & Hyde pedal by visual sound.<br>  <br>  heavier distortion is done well by something like a rat, or my new favorite pedal the Biyang ds-8. you can get it on ebay for $50 shipped. in my opinion it outperformed the proco pedal by a considerable margin.<br>  <br>  for really heavy some people like to use the Metalzone. decent pedal, lots of features. <br>  <br>  and for fuzz you can get something like a big muff, although i do feel that they are limited.

xTioPxaVaa	I'd run a bass through a guitar pedal.  The bass effects usually don't have as good of high frequency response.  However, the guitar effects may not have the bass response that the bass fx does, but that's easier to dial back in.<br>  <br>  You'll trade away some effects designed for the bass, but it's a better compromise to get the one designed for guitar.<br>  <br>  Greetings from Austin, TX<br>  <br>  Ken|`|4e11GJVZaa	Honestly, you should consider which instrument you have a preference for, and which you would be playing in a band. Not only for this purchase, but if you want to get a bigger amp, or a new guitar, you have to decide.<br>  <br>  If you go with a guitar effects processor, your bass can run through, but as mentioned before you will probably have more high end response and not enough low end(which may or may not be compensated). Plus the effects pedals are designed for a guitar, and a guitar plays on a whole other octave and has much more range than a bass, and therefore a bass will sound much different through, let's say a wah pedal for example, than your guitar will. There are reasons that pedal companies make effects for bass, because you normally want your  bass to sound, well, like a bass, and not a 1 octave down guitar.<br>  <br>  Hope I make sense.

qWicVoU9aa	Once a SIM card has been blocked by inputting an oncorrect PUK code in too many times then the SIM card is "fried" and you service provider will be of no help whatsoever.  You will have to go purchase a new SIM card and that is the only way to fix that problem|`|py0DpCh4aa	If your sim is blocked you must call Tracfone to unblock it.
k9Uxo6lWaa	I regret ever having left Verizon. I easily made 55K a year there as a lineman.I actually installed the fiber that makes up the Fios network for the area that I worked in. and Fios sells itself it is insanely fast.....<br>  the guys that install it at the home site are sharp and do as clean an install as possible.|`|AA11448039	sucks
mIx3mMQSaa	well it depends really.<br>  DSi would have much better games and the added fun of the camera and the face warp application<br>  but if you want a better quality screen for videos or more memory for music then the iPod touch would be better. <br>  also depends if you already have an iPod and/or DS.<br>  I have an iPod touch 8GB original type and both original DS and a DS lite and I have to say i use my iPod much more. if i want games i play my wii or 360 as they are better than DS i find.<br>  you could get one of them then start saving straight away for the other...|`|ohq6qrFaaa	I would choose the DSi. As it will have better games than the iPod touch, and will oprobably be less common. You can also listen to your music and browse the internet on it. Sure, the iPod can do all that, but you'll get a lot more enjoyment out of the DSi's games than the iPods.|`|VY7OuYhZaa	Well, I just preordered the DSi and yesterday bought an iPod Touch.  Since the DSi is not released yet, I am not sure I have an opinion on it, but the iPod touch is simply amazing.
9CKrP9Keaa	Call your provider, it should be covered under the warranty.
fwnqB0dTaa	There's no way for you to track it unless you have signed it up to a tracking service.<br>  <br>  Even that probably wouldn't help as most of them need a response to a TXT sent to the phone before tracking is enabled.<br>  <br>  You need to contact your phone company and get your account disabled, to stop anyone else using it, and also to get the phone blocked|`|mJqJ1sEYaa	you can call the verizon company and speak with them about it. make sure you disconnect your service, because if it was dropped while biking - you don't want anybody to use it. or you can call it just to see if anyone answers.|`|UbnKabQOaa	Im pretty sure you can't track it unless it has a GPS chip in it already. So you might want to check your house first and if you can't find it track where you rode your bike and if you can't find it you may want to put up signs and maybe even a reward. Hope you find it!<br>  Hope I helped :)

They're usually good about providing them to registerred users.<br>  <br>  The problem with using CD keys from sources other than EA is the risk that someone else has it active and is using it...which will cause your to freeze-up.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|At2JL4MVaa	I can't really help you with the disc but If you have limewire you can download the game as a torrent, and use daemon.

NFfR6o4Jaa	in your case guitar hero will be best there are a lot of old and new songs and You can play solo on different Instruments or in a band.|`|RUpd7JTqaa	Rock Band 2, better songs, better support from the company, overall prettier aesthetic, and its not made by the craptastic activision who likes to milk the dead, dry cow that is known as the guitar hero franchise.  The soundtrack on Rock Band 2 sounds like you'd like it too|`|MDxe7h2Paa	I did some research and found that a lot of people find the Rock band 2 instruments better made. <br>  <br>  I have Rock Band 2 for Wii and love it but have decided to sell it and get it for another system because the the instruments aren't compatible for Guitar Hero World Tour and they are compatible on the PS3 and 360.<br>  <br>  As for the songs you can google both for the complete track list and decide from there but for me I decided both were awesome and ordered them for the 360.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.

3ixmHSwmaa	Make sure your batteries are good. Moving the lens requires a lot of power. If the camera works otherwise, you might chose to not worry about the lens. If you can't stand it, try disassembling the camera and cleaning the surfaces that ride up against each other when the lens extends/retracts. Inspect moving parts for wear or damage while it's apart.
ohq6qrFaaa	I wouldn't reccomend an iPod nano. Sure there are lots of colours, but you have to deal with a bad sound quality (SQ), iTunes and poor battery life for that price tag.<br>  <br>  For the same price as a Nano, you could get a Sony S630 series Walkman. It has amazing sound quality, 40 hours of battery life for audio, is MSC and UMS (if forced) compatibile (meaning you can just drag and drop files onto the player), it has dedicated volume buttons (some players still don't, looking at you, Nano) and it comes with a pair of really good earphones.<br>  <br>  Trust me, you'll enjoy the Walkman more than the iPod, look at all of these posts with people having problems with them? Do you want to be one of them?|`|FTG6M0Luaa	The iPod nano is great if you are looking for a cheap music player, but if you  have some money to spare then go for the iPod Touch.  You will not be disappointed because it has many great features and you will never let it out of your hands|`|lIsFMcsfaa	PLEASE do not get a nano!!! they are retarded little devices that have VERY little uses for their price tag. you would be much better off taking your money elsewhere. please.
qWicVoU9aa	If If the word unlock or enter code is not showing on the display then it is not locked.  It sounds like your keypad has quit working.  With the device turned on pull the battery out of it and then put it back in.  If the same thing still happens then it is time for a new device|`|9CKrP9Keaa	Need more info, but this is what you should do. Call your provider or go to their store. They will tell you exactly what's wrong with your phone. It could be locked or have a software problem, either way they can fix it.

c231bbpTaa	Personally I don't think wii has any good survivor horror games. RE4 was more of a shooter then like it's predecessors. <br>  <br>  You might like Alone in the Dark. It isn't bad and if you get stuck you can go to a different chapter in the game if you want.<br>  <br>  There is also Obscure the Aftermath which is a good survivor horror but only if you have two players. Playing single player can be a bit tricky since the computer player is a bit dumb. The lines are also really cheesy. The game is kinda cheesy but fun.

D8BDhIGwaa	Your wireless adapter should work fine with your wireless router (which needs to support 802.11a, b or g standards to comply with the Xbox 360 wireless adapter).  Also, if you use security you cannot use WPA2.  Only WEP or WPA works with the Xbox 360 wireless adapter.<br>  <br>  The wireless password you may be prompted for when setting up the Xbox 360 wireless adapter is probably the wireless network security key (WEP or WPA).  Just match it to one set on your wireless router (if one is setup).  Your system password is probably just the admin password to access the router's admin pages.<br>  <br>  One useful step, make sure your router is setup to access your ISP's internet connection with your ISP account username/password pre-entered from the router (the correct way, and it's probably been configured to do this anyway).  Otherwise, all your devices (PC, laptop, Xbox etc.) will have to enter it everytime they need to login.

QEuhPEb7aa	Well your budget won't get you very far with a good quality guitar I'll give you that.<br>  <br>  But if you'd like a guitar for hard rock and metal, I suggest the Gibson Les Paul Custom or an SG. If you ever do go for the Custom, I suggest the one with 3 pickups. A lot more of tonal variety there because you have more pickups to mix and work with.<br>  <br>  The Custom is very good, it sounds great even without any effects, you get a good sound just straight from the amp. It would take a toll on your back though, Les Pauls are infamously heavy ! Fingerwork around the neck won't be that easy too, there's going to be a lot of finger stretching to reach all those notes.<br>  <br>  But the 3 pickup Les Paul Custom has a natural dark and crispy sound. This proves true even if you play it without any effects or pedals. <br>  <br>  The SG has a good crunchy and roaring sound as well. The pickups with that fast neck work wonders when you play riffs. I don't really enjoy the SG's appearance, but it's easier to use than a Les Paul and a lot more comfortable. The neck is much easier on your hands. Reaching all those notes becomes a breeze when you use an SG.<br>  <br>  If you can't afford the Gibsons, just go with the Epiphone counterparts, they're almost just as good. Just get a good amp and you're on your way.<br>  <br>  Just so you know I'm not exactly a Metal player. I'm more on Blues, Hard Rock and Alternative Rock.<br>  <br>  Ibanez may seem a good choice. But I don't buy dirt cheap guitars that are simply knock offs from leading brands !  <br>  <br>  Almost every single Ibanez guitar is a copycat of the originals which are usually from Gretsch, PRS, Gibson and Fender.<br>  <br>  But Dean and Jackson are really great guitar brands. Jackson really has that metal sound you might be looking for but your budget's too steep to get a really good model.<br>  <br>  You sound like someone who's on a tight budget. I suggest that you just keep to a Jackson or a Dean and not one of those Ibanez copycats. Then buy a good amp. Get an amp that maximizes output and minimizes bass so the sound is crisp and not muddy. <br>  <br>  Metal shares a fine line with Hard Rock. Metal and Hard Rock are different. But almost any guitar can play metal, given the right guitar specs and equipment.<br>  <br>  What do you need to produce the typical "metal" sound? All you need are humbuckers or double coils. Pack a Wah Wah pedal with the typical Distortion. Then bring a Reverb pedal for extra effect and there you have it !<br>  <br>  What do you need on the guitar? A comfortable thin neck for playing the quick riffs. Great pickups with a roughly high output  that don't have much of a bass. A very high amount of sustain. This sustain is something that Gibsons can really give you. Just eliminate that buzz and you're good to go.<br>  <br>  It's not really much with the guitar if you want to play and sound like metal. It's much much more on your amp. Playing metal is rarely playing clean. So the sound will really come from your amps and the pickups. I suggest the EMG pickups.|`|X4O7W1Vvaa	An Epiphone SG is pretty good. Tried a lot of guitars in that price range but there's nothing close the the Epiphone for rock/metal playability.|`|dduWesM5aa	omg, these people are all idiots, none of which play metal obviously. <br>  normally i would advise you to purchase an esp ec 1000, but those run around 1 grand. if you were going to spend 500-1000 i'd tell you to get a schecter. but for $400 bucks definitely an ibanez rg, they're great metal guitars. whatever you do DO NOT get a gibson, epiphone, fender etc...|`|XLnboFslaa	Epiphone Flying V or Epiphone Explorer.

But I'll try to help you! If u h8 blackberries so much try a palm or a chocolate. But if you only in it for texting or virals I suggest you buy an Ipod Touch instead.

j5Apt8hWaa	First changing camera systems is a waste of money.  DSLR's are not at all like a P&S were you can change brands every time you buy a new camera.<br>  <br>  That said, look hard at the Nikon D90.  Not only is it an advanced camera, but it has many of the features found on the $1,700 Nikon D300.<br>  <br>  The D90 has much lower noise at high ISO than any camera in its class and it has an "info" mode only found on the $2,900 D700.  It offers a lot of "scene" modes, for those who are still not comfortable being in complete control of their camera using the manual settings.  In addition, if offers a retouching mode that allows the user to actually use many tools to retouch the images in camera without overwriting the original image file.  Basically the D90 has all the pro features of the D300 plus a more advanced sensor and electronics than the D300 (this is evident in the D-Max setting options)<br>  <br>  To increase professionalism, you only need to enhance your skills, buying a new camera will not do much but perhaps inspire you to hone your skills or even take a class.<br>  <br>  Do not think that buying a new camera will make your images better, you are only buying a better tool, the skills you have will be the limiting factor as to how well you can use the tool<br>  <br>  Here is what I suggest.  Until you can produce the pro level images using your D40, at anytime, anywhere, save your money and keep using the D40.  You have the two lenses that will perhaps shoot over 95% of the subjects you tend to shoot and all you have to do, is produce professional quality images from it.  To do that, you need to hone your skills in composing your images and learn how to nail your exposures, so each one is perfect.<br>  <br>  If you are thinking that increasing the pixel count on your camera will make better photos, it won't. Unless you invest in a camera with 24 mp or better you will not see much of a difference between a 6 mp sensor and a 12 mp sensor except that your memory cards will fill twice as fast.<br>  <br>  I used a 6 mp camera for three years professionally.  It was only when clients thought I should have the latest and greatest camera model did I grudgingly buy a new body.  While it had more toots and whistles, they did nothing to enhance my abilities as a pro photographer.  We are only concerned with composition and control of the exposure.    Composition is all about filling the frame, choosing the correct lens and using aperture to control depth of field, whether using selective depth of field to isolate our subject to using a small aperture to pull a lot of focus when shooting a forced perspective shot using a wide angle lens|`|kvQIiG0Caa	i say spend about 700-800 on a nikon 105mm f2.8 macro lens<br>  it has vr and you said you want to do macro and portrait so this is a perfect lens for you<br>  <br>  this is a better investment than buying a new camera<br>  the lenses that you are currently using are good, but mostly for vacations and such things of that sort<br>  <br>  you might also want to spend that 1500 on the nikon 70-200 f2.8 vr<br>  that is really great for portraits ...but not so much so for macro(the closes you can focus is about 5 feet as with the 105mm its about 1 foot)<br>  <br>  the d40 is a good camera( i know, i own one along with a d1x and the lens mentioned above)<br>  <br>  there is also the nikon 85mm f1.4 for i think about 800-900 <br>  that is a great lens with a really small aperture <br>  <br>  so what i am basically saying is spend your cash on better lenses and not another camera
