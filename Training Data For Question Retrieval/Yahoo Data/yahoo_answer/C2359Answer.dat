AA10887916	What exactly do you want?  The problem here is that by merely posting the questions that you have been asked you appear to be inviting people to simply give you the answer.  It appears to the outside world as very lazy, particularly since all you have to do is enter 'homeostasis' into any major search engine and you'll get lots of information.  The fact that you don't give evidence of even having bothered to do this by asking a more focussed question suggests what you really want is the work done for you, rather than some help/ guidance.  the fact that you have already asked two questions in exactly the same way means that you seem to be after getting your entire science paper done for you which is very close to cheating.|`|IFS5LPHtaa	u have google.com and wikipedia to help u.

I am not familiar with uK immigration policy - having a family in Poland and living in the United States only gives me gossip - I know the UK viewed the Poles like the United States views the Mexicans for a long time, and that is starting to loosen up and people from the UK learn more and fall in love (my family told me they are desperate for people to teach Polish in the UK, so chaps can pick up Polish birds easier). <br>  <br>  The first step would be to check with the UK's immigration site online, and take it from there.

Ftkr9jqYaa	In social animals, the alpha is the individual in the community to whom the others follow and defer. Where one male and one female fulfill this role, they are referred to as the alpha pair. In some groups, the alpha males and females are overrepresented in the genetics of a population, because they are the only ones who breed successfully.<br>  <br>  Chimpanzees show deference to the alpha of the community by ritualized gestures such as bowing, allowing the alpha to walk first in a procession, or standing aside when the alpha challenges. Canines (wolves & dogs, jackals, foxes, etc) show deference to the alpha pair in their pack, by allowing them to be the first to eat and, usually, the only pair to mate. The status of the alpha is sometimes achieved by means of superior physical prowess; however, in certain highly social species such as the bonobo (i.e., pygmy chimpanzee) and humans, a contender can use more indirect methods, such as political alliances, to oust the ruling alpha and take their place. Canines use eye contact to establish and maintain alpha position. Gorillas use intimidation.<br>  <br>  In gender studies, the alpha male concept is sometimes termed "hegemonic masculinity," referring to the idea that a culturally normative ideal of male behaviour exists (i.e., that to which men are strongly encouraged to aim), which is calculated to guarantee the dominant position of some men over others, and /or the subordination of women.  According to the theory's proponents, it is not necessarily the most prevalent form of male expression, but rather the most socially endorsed or highly valued image of masculinity that always contributes to the subordinate position of women they perceive. Proponents point to characteristics such as aggressiveness, strength, drive, ambition, and self-reliance, which they argue are encouraged in males, but discouraged in females in contemporary American society, as evidence of the existence of hegemonic masculinity.<br>  <br>  Masculinity is manly character, and describes men and boys in personal and human terms.   Men or boys who are most masculine tend to be alpha males.  The opposite can be expressed by terms such as unmanly, epicene or effeminate.  A typical near-synonym of masculinity is virility, and the usual complement is femininity.<br>  <br>  Stereotypical masculine behavior is highly valued, as evidenced by the finding that men who are judged to be most masculine are also likely to attain leadership positions, and are thus alpha males.  Men who are less masculine tend to be less successful.  In conclusion, attaining alpha male status is likely to result in higher-level occupational advancement, higher income, and greater procreativity.
Ftkr9jqYaa	You probably mean VALEDICTION, which is an expression used to say farewell (goodbye), especially at the end of a letter. (Other meanings include the act of saying goodbye, and a speech made at such an occasion, known as a VALEDICTORY ADDRESS, which is performed by the highest-ranking classmate during the graduation ceremony) The word comes from the Latin valedicere, meaning "to say goodbye."<br>  <br>  The word valediction is often used loosely in English to refer to a complimentary closing, which is a courteous formula used to end a letter. This is normally a formulaic phrase preceding the writer's signature that expresses the writer's loyalty or best wishes to the recipient.<br>  <br>  A valediction is often related to the salutation (i.e., opening expression, such as "Dear Sir") used in the letter or message.<br>  <br>  Examples of valedictions:<br>  <br>  Yours truly,<br>  Very sincerely yours,<br>  Kindest regards,<br>  Best wishes,<br>  I have the honour to remain... your most humble and obedient servant,
W8F9PboZaa	If I have said this once, I've said it 100 times. Do NOT choose a subject based on scaling. There are those subjects which scale better, of course, but think about it. Say you're equally talented at Physics and Society and Culture. You do an hour of work for each and do an exam. With an hour work in physics you'll get, say, a mark of 70. You do an hour of work for Society and Culture and you get 80, because it's a much easier subject. Society and Culture will scale down to 78 and Physics will scale up to 78. Do you get what I'm trying to say? <br>  <br>  I chose chemistry and 3U maths because they "scaled well". I worked my *** off in chemistry. I was tutored and still couldn't bring myself above average. And as for 3U maths... well I got 6% in one test. Then dropped it. I should have just dropped all the way to General but I thought 2U scaled so much better that is would be better to stay in 2U. That was the stupidest decision. For all its good scaling I still got only 73 in the HSC and that was after being tutored and putting in twice the amount of work for Maths then any other subject. I was just not good at maths. A girl who consistently got the same mark as me in maths dropped to general and got 92 in it. <br>  <br>  However my other subjects didn't scale well, bar english advanced, they weren't bad but all were just slightly above average scaling. Modern, Ancient and Biology. I got 90, 89 and 85 in them respectively. I loved doing those subjects. I found them stimulating and therefore i took it in. Choose subjects your passionate about. You'll be more interested in them and more inclined to study them. I found studying for modern to be like a break. It was just so interesting that it barely seemed like studying. It's a shame it was the day after my maths exam so I spent all of 5 minutes on it in the few days before. <br>  <br>  Look at the dux of my school last year. She did Society and Culture, Legal, Modern, Ancient and English. No maths. No "scaling" subjects. She managed to get a uai of 98.9. <br>  <br>  Do subjects you WANT. If you're good at maths then go for 3U, you can always drop it. But don't struggle through it if you know you're going to go badly just because of the "scaling factor"<br>  <br>  Here is a list of subjects, from best to worst scaling. I beg you not to take it into consideration though.<br>  <a href="http://www.boredofstudies.org/scaling.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.boredofstudies.org/scaling.ph...</a><br>  Click on the third link, it doesn't link when I try and copy and paste it|`|zt0wLQzVaa	wow, alex pretty much said it all.<br>  but, of course 3u maths scales better than 2u. you also need to take into consideration your maths ability =)

A form of biological reproduction produces certain types of humans in batches – 96 identical copies of the same being. A social "caste" structure separates the citizens into five groups, the result being that a given individual is little more than a faceless, color-coded member of a larger group.<br>  <br>  From Shmoop/Themes/Brave New World

This link below is to a self help site (which I have used to get an e-book on parenting - NOT the speed reading book) but I liked the book I got from there so much that I bookmarked the site in case I ever needed any of the other books offered...|`|BLFduvnpaa	The way I picked up speed reading was to highlight key words in sentences and just focus on them only. <br>  For example in this sentence,<br>  Maria screamed as she ran out of the house, hot tears streaking down her face.<br>  <br>  I would highlight 'Maria'  'ran out', 'house' and 'tears'. These words are enough to let me know that Maria was upset and this caused her to run out of the house.<br>  <br>  You could try highlighting keywords as you read the passage slowly (at this point, it doesn't matter if you're not retaining the info just highlight) and then skim through the whole article again, just looking at the keywords to get the main idea.<br>  <br>  It is time consuming at first but it helps in the long run because after several times, you'll get used to it and while you're highlighting the key words, your brain kinda processes by itself what you're reading and soon you should be able to speed read.|`|0xBvybIxaa	first off the more books you read the better and faster, and even smarter you get.<br>  as for trying to get by reading fast, take mental notes...like for example...reading this question...you don't have to read all of the information...<br>  i saw increase reading speed and retain information...that simplifies that sentence...<br>  kinda skim through it but still memorize some things. <br>  maybe ask the teacher if he or she will give you the article before so you can read it. then when it's time to read it skim through it and get info. get down dates, names, and main theme and you pretty much have everything down<br>  good luck hope i helped|`|VlBncwFDaa	For me, I study speed reading with online course and it helps.

But the question is: How can one read efficiently, capture relevant ideas in a usable way, and keep the process sustainable and enjoyable? The rest of my post summarizes the best solutions I’ve found, but the most useful technique comes from Jason Womack, and synthesizes nicely the most common ideas. In a nutshell, he says he reads the book four times:<br>  <br>      1. Table of contents, glossary, index.<br>      2. Anything in bold, titles, and subtitles.<br>      3. First line of every paragraph.<br>      4. Entire book<br>  <br>  It’s a simple process. The first 3 steps should take around ten minutes [not much extra, hey?] and prepares your brain to take in the information. Because you’ve, essentially, already read the book three times, when you do finally read it in it’s entirety the information becomes much easier to sink in.|`|Gmhbly9Oaa	keep a notepad/paper and several color pens ready before you start reading.<br>  as and when you read jot down the key points/words in different colors preferably using graphical/pictorial representations.<br>  the 2nd time that you will read the article look at your notepad and try reconstructing the article in your own words.<br>  and if you are able to remember even half the article you have succeeded. if not read again and try again.<br>  <br>  we will always remember a picture more than text. so visualize everything you read and that should help.<br>  <br>  all the best!

1nL6p8zMaa	Your teacher is right, this topic is usually discussed in an informative way.  It will be difficult to make an interesting argument (especially with the detail necessary to fill 7-12 pages)  There are plenty of cons to discuss, but I'm not sure if you can come up with enough pros that are in direct opposition. <br>  <br>  What you need to do is discuss the pros and cons of mass media and the effect it has on those 3 topics. <br>  For example: Mass Media/TV can be (pros)entertaining, informative, educational, inspiring etc..  But does it brainwash, mislead or pressure people?  Pressure to be perfect/thin can be weighed against people rather see/watch  esthetically pleasing bodies/faces or that it persuades people to get into shape and think about their health.  Argue that persuasive advertising encourages people to be materialistic, But also urges consumers to buy and stimulates the economy (is good for business) <br>  <br>  What about the propaganda in politics- how much can you trust media information to be correct or true? What about mudslinging during election time? You can argue that propaganda is a tool for motivating the American people to get interested and get involved with current events.  Or it motivates the country as a whole to be patriotic or believe in a good cause. Maybe people need to be told what to think to create unison. Freethinking can be dangerous if it divides the country (united we stand-divided we fall) Stuff like that.  <br>  Make sure Both sides of the argument make a point that's valid and of similar weight/value.  <br>  <br>  First a broad opening statement about the mass media's important role in our lives(entertainment, news, advertising, etc..) but that there's some controversy over it's negative effects on people and in politics- Should or can anything be done to change things? And so on.... <br>  <br>   After your opening paragraph- You can discuss the 3 areas of the topic in detail One at a time. The important thing is to present both sides of the argument. It helps if you have an opinion of your own about it.  Then you can give examples of the opposing opinion and explain why you disagree.<br>  <br>  Closing paragraph just re-caps the main focus of the controversy.  (You can leave the reader with a lasting inclination to agree with your opinion, If you end your closing paragraph with a persuasive summary statement supporting your over-all opinion) <br>  <br>  Try searching for mass media controversy stories on the internet to help give you more ideas for your content.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|vmVF3S8Zaa	hmmm, what do you mean exactly?<br>  <br>  you could say the fashion world is trying to show girls the stereotype for a pretty person is a thin chic, and this shapes peoples ideas?<br>  <br>  also bring in stereotypes, and how they shape peoples minds, cos they do. say things like how before, the women were stereotyped as homemakers and the ones who stayed at home, and now things have changed and more females have careers.<br>  <br>  im not too sure about the second point, sorry.<br>  <br>  feel free to email me if you need any more help <br>  <br>  good luck :):)

mbXHkf1maa	There isn't a direct equivalent in English: it's somewhere between an architect and a surveyor.  If you put "Geometra (professional architectural/surveying qualification including draughtsmanship, surveying, structural design, BOQ)" that would cover it.<br>  <br>  PS I don't think "quantity surveying" is close enough; a quantity surveyor focuses more on the financial management of building projects.|`|tTLGVtLGaa	Quantity Surveying. <br>  <br>  Fare attenzione non pretendere per essere ' a Quantity Surveyor'  perché diventare un Quantity Surveyor di fide di osso lei deve completare un corso di laurea e l'allenamento ulteriori e l'esperienza di solito è poi richiesto prima che lei può diventare membro di un corpo riconosciuto professionale. <br>  <br>  Nel Regno Unito il sistema educativo, non ci è il corso di liceo che è equivalente al corso che lei ha completato in Italia.<br>  <br>  Qualora lei si domanda, sono inglese ma ho vissuto in Italia per un anno e lavoro nella costruzione.

zCOvQwQhaa	"He said..."  hmmmm<br>  <br>  Have you analyzed both application packages and found that the ONLY difference between the two of you is gender?  That is the only way that you could conclude that the decision is based on gender alone.  I very much doubt that's the case.

They often try to get a student body that is about 50/50 in gender division.  Many universities have more female students than males, so they are often more likely to admit male students than females even if the guys are slightly less qualified.  Schools with strong technical/engineering programs often have the opposite situation -- far more guys than girls -- so they are more likely to admit females.  In this case, the situation seems to have benefitted you.  If the circumstances were reversed and you were the one who wasn't admitted yet, would your boyfriend be seriously considering not attending the school he wanted on moral grounds?  Somehow I doubt it.|`|qErZwzOcaa	Well, I guess being a girl gave you an advantage in getting into this school, but if you want to go there, I don't think you should be stopped by that. Being a girl is part of you who you are, and if they like that part, then good for you! If you don't accept their offer, make sure it is not just because you feel sorry for your boyfriend. remember that men have a TON of advantages in a lot of other areas in life.

You can tell them that it shouldn't matter so much to them, but you can't truthfully tell them that they aren't important.|`|ORonhAuvaa	Why would you lecture them on something that is totally untrue?

You could also do programs like Americorps that help underprivileged people/areas. They're really for helping though, not for making money. If you have a career center in your school, I would definitely chat them up and see what you could do before you graduate.|`|ORonhAuvaa	Pretty much none.

zCHnMeXbaa	This answer is from an American Yank.<br>  Math tutors are always in demand.  This is what I did when I tutored Math and Science.  First, I looked for newspaper ads for tutors, called them up and got an idea of the going tutor rate.  I checked for ads at the university to see what other students charged.  Using those rates I then determined a rate per hour that was an average of all of the above. I found tutoring is largely word of mouth.  Help one student and they let others know about you.  <br>  When I tutored students I required that they had to be prepared: pencils, paper, books, and at least one attempt to complete their assignment.  Their problem solving skills are much easier to determine if they at least try to solve the problem.  I also required a parent be present in the home.  That will negate any ethical problems while tutoring; plus, the parent might learn something too.  <br>  MAJOR POINT OF TUTORING--you are there to lead the student to the answer; you are not there to give the answer.  That is for the student to figure out. <br>  Any questions, just email me through my profile.<br>  Need more info, email me through my profile|`|ZAg0XAvkaa	I reckon tutoring is a great idea. You could start of charging $20 - $25. If you have a group of friends who also specialize in an area, you guys could come together and form a tutor group; like 'Trilogy' if you have ever heard of them. If you're thinking of tutoring by yourself you might want to advertise in the papers.<br>  <br>  Good luck!

ORonhAuvaa	Your relationship must stay on the adult/student level. This means that you can share things with her and ask for her empathy. However, she cannot share her own life frustrations with you. It is not ethical. <br>  <br>  She can tell you about her dog or her kids or an experience she had in school, but that is as far as she will go. She has your best interests in mind and she knows that a personal relationship with a student cannot work out. She has given her agreement that she will treat you in a kind and caring manner, but she will draw a line. It means she really cares about you.<br>  <br>  That may be hard to accept, but everything we do had to be in the best interests of the children we teach. What we say and do can impact a child's life for the good or the bad. We have to really toe the line.|`|eeP9Xp8Laa	My parents were not the type I could tell anything to. My 6th grade math teacher and I became really close. I could and still can talk to her about anything. My parents went through a lot of stuff and have split up twice since 7th grade, and this teacher was there for me the whole way to guide me and be there for me. I consider her basically to be my adoptive mom, sortof. She has even said that to me, because I do not really care much about my parents.<br>  She knows more about me than a lot of my friends and my own parents. But, you just have to be careful what you tell them because there are certain things they must report no matter what. And, you have to be careful how personal you get and not ask them super personal questions about their life.<br>  I still talk to her. A few of my friends know, they think it's cool that she is there for me anytime and would do absolutely anything for me, because she cares and knows I confide in her.<br>  This teacher is also not well liked by many students. But she is an amazing person who will have have a great influence on my decisions and my life<br>  I would not suggest ever kissing a teacher.<br>  But I text this teacher, email, and I moved away and moved back, but while i was still away i came to visit, and we were going to see eachother but it ended up we couldnt<br>  I know that because this teacher is much like a mom to me, I've told her I love her, and she has said it too.<br>  I don't know if she could get in trouble for this.  I know not to push her or ask her personal things, and I woulldn't taking the relationship any further than what I have. We've never done anything close to illegal or anything.<br>  So. I don't think doing anythign I've mentioned is too far. It's perfectly fine to have a teacher to be there for you and support you like this teacher does for me. So, I hope this helps you|`|cjoSeWUmaa	Well, I would say a relationship that is stronger than a friend is going overboard.  Its not so bad because you both are females, but you must remember that ANYTHING can be misconstrued as sexual contact...even a hug is pushing it...<br>  <br>  But I think that you will be fine...but out of curiosity, what is the age gap?
AA11564697	I'm sorry your parents said that. Parents can be very critical sometimes. You're either too thin or too fat...argh. Well, if they don't like Abercrombie and Hollister, you can definitely find cute clothes at other places like Delia's, H&M, Wet Seal, etc.<br>  <br>  And you are normal! Middle school can be a difficult time to fit in for many people. Check out the after school activities at your school. You can join clubs or sports that interest you. Or do volunteer work. Then, you will meet people who have something in common with you. Also, in class, maybe you can talk to your neighbor. You could ask someone about the homework or if they want to study for an upcoming test. Above all, just be friendly and be yourself. A true friend will accept you for who you are and not try to change you. It's also not about the number of friends you have but the kind of friends.<br>  <br>  As for the boyfriend thing, first you have to be confident and feel good about yourself. Just remember all the good qualities you know you have. As for appearance, put on an outfit that makes you feel good and happy. Then smile and be approachable. As long as you stay positive, other people will be drawn to your positivity. Hope this helps!|`|QmRL8U0Vaa	Please email/IM me at peacelovejuicy515@yahoo.com and i will help u|`|V1hxvQukaa	just have some more confidence. go up and talk to someone....<br>  <br>  friends shouldn't like you because of the clothes you wear or how much you weigh anyway...
6AjqyBTFaa	Confucius is famous for his philosophy because he made many wise sayings in ancient China that helped many people learn about nature, the world, and the human behavior. <br>  <br>  <br>  Confucius, or Kung Fu Tzu, (born Kong Qiu, styled Zhong Ni) was born in the village of Zou in the country of Lu in 551 B.C., a poor descendant of a deposed noble family. <br>  <br>  As a child, he held make-believe temple rituals. Later on, he   worked as a keeper of a market. Then he was a farm worker who took care of parks and farm animals. When he was 20, he worked for the governor of his district.   As a young adult, he quickly earned a reputation for fairness, politeness and love of learning, and he was reputed to be quite tall. <br>  <br>  His mother died in 527 BC, and after a period of mourning he began his career as a teacher, usually traveling about and instructing the small body of disciples that had gathered around him. <br>  <br>  It's not really eight but I hope I helped :)
trKgx3Ukaa	Uni life does take a bit of getting used to, that's for sure, so don't let this get you down in week one. <br>  <br>  A few things to do to create some friends:<br>  <br>  1. As you wait around to get into the lecture or tutorial room for example, look for anyone that tends to be by him/herself most of the time, a bit like you! Approach them and ask them something like: "how are you finding uni so far? or this course etc". <br>  <br>  You can do the same to anybody sitting next to you in the lecture while waiting for the lecturer to rock up and get started. <br>  <br>  <br>  The first few weeks of uni are the best times to make friends easily and you can get away with simple introductory questions like this.<br>  <br>  2. Check out all the clubs and societies. There are so many of them, surely there is one that will suit you. Get involved in them and find out who is doing the same course as you - it does not matter if they are a few years ahead of you - in fact, that's great since you can ask them about how best to tackle the course.  Anyway, it's a great way to make friends and not feel lonely. <br>  <br>  3. It is very important that, despite you currently feeling a bit lost in the crowds and not fully understanding the lecturer, that you keep up with the lecture notes and to do all exercises and readings as set by the lecturer. It will just get harder if you fall behind schedule, and uni becomes a nightmare. <br>  <br>  4. Don't get unsettled by others seemingly knowing all the answers already. Maybe they are repeaters? If not, maybe they are in fact reading ahead so that they already know what is being covered in the week's lecture. You should endeavour to do the same: prepare for each lecture so that you are primed for it. It will make understanding the lecturer so much easier. <br>  <br>  Don't get discouraged. Most freshers feel lost in week one ( or even most of the first semester), but eventually, if you get involved socially, prepare for lectures and make friends, it can become quite an enjoyable experience. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|oLj0VTX5aa	Hang out at the coffee shops and try to find people in the same boat, or try to find people on the campus message boards in your classes to study with - it's a great way to make friends.  The freshman year kind of sucks, because the kids still have that lame high school mentality of grouping together like sheep.  <br>  <br>  I didn't get along with many people my freshman year, because I wasn't really into much of what most other students are into - the clubs on campus were not in my league and I was more of a geek for a girl - I liked anime, comics, drawing, soccer and i had a morbid sense of humour.  I eventually found my groove and made some friends in my elective classes.  I just forced myself to talk to people and I migrated to other people who seemed alone in the class.|`|rhhg7xNqaa	enjoy the university life. not everyone can get the chance to be there.

IGT62xMNaa	Hey there, I am a fellow applicant to NCSSM. I actually was at the Discovery Day yesterday 03/07/09. We have to wait until April 18th to find out if we got accepted, that is going to be a very long wait...<br>  <br>        But anyway, about the test at Discovery Day; there are actually 2 tests that you must take. The order in which you take these tests depends on the group you were in. <br>         But the Math test, which I was extremely nervous for, was simply basica algebra 1. Just isolating the variables, factoring, graphing slope & y-intercept, graphing number line, one with a quadratic formula, and there was one with a negative exponent. Two questions regarding geometry, basically about triangle-triangle ratio, and pythagoreon theorum.  Most of the questions are simple algebra 1, some algebra 2, and a little geometry.<br>      The test on writing was just one essay, as well as the top 5 reasons you want to come to NCSSM. The essay prompt I had to write about was a time when i was stressed out, or under alot of stress, and how i overcame that adversity. they basically spell out the stuff they want you to talk about in the essay prompt. then the next section is just to list the top 5 reasons you want to attend NCSSM.<br>      You have 30 minutes for the math test, it is only 25 questions, and none of them really are too tedious.. In the writing test you have 30 minutes for the essay, and ten for the top 5 priorities.<br>  <br>      I hope this information was helpful, I just wish that someone would have told me all of this. I am very sure you will do fine, i am still taking algebra 2. Just don't sweat it.<br>  <br>      Good luck, and i hope to see you at NCSSM next year.

You might get hired by a company performing a job that is totally disassociated with your degree. Most companies prefer that. If you're going into business management, for instance, there's nothing wrong with Sociology. Take some undergraduate business classes. Accounting so you know how to read a spreadsheet.

It features Peter fishing from a boat, a symbolism derived from the tradition that the apostles were "fishers of men" (Mark 1:17).

2rdXW293aa	Great question!<br>  <br>  There has to be a change in men's minds before there can be revolution. If you go to the Colonial Williamsburg site (history.org),  they have a treatise on there someplace about the phenomenon of "becoming Americans." (See link, below.) Because the idea of transferring their allegiance from the British king to the colonies was pretty radical at the time. These men put EVERYTHING on the line - their lives, their property, their position in society.<br>  <br>  Gradually, at some point, they felt more allegiance toward one another - the communities in the colonies - than they did toward a remote monarch who kept insisting on taxation without representation. George III lost the colonists' affections. It didn't happen overnight, of course, but there was one insult after another.

(9) so (9*1=9) ok put the second one down while still having the first one up don't count the finger that's down what does that give you? (18) so (9*2=18) and so on hope i helped theres tons of others|`|hnEjYV3Iaa	okay so i know its slightly festy but buy/print off a big A3 poster and stick it on the back of your toilet door.<br>  <br>  plus, there are some little tricks you can learn depending on which numbers youre multiplying. you'll start to see some patterns. like this<br>  <br>  1 x 11 = 11<br>  2 x 11 = 22<br>  3 x 11 = 33<br>  <br>  see how if its times 1 the answer only consists of 1's and if its 3 the answer only consists of 3's

Mdk7DmiAaa	As a teacher...<br>  <br>  Discuss this with her while others are present and voice your concerns in a mature  and well thought way.<br>  <br>  This may change her behaviour. If not, discuss this with the school principal and again have witnesses to verify your story and that you tried to resolve the situation with the teacher first.  <br>  <br>  Then if this fails...go to the school board and address your concerns.  Again bringing witnesses to verify.<br>  <br>  If that fails, contact the state board of education, ethics department.|`|BddRfJ2caa	Don't even bother with starting a fight with the teacher, go straight to the principal and have her fired (yay).|`|OEZ57OUZaa	Grow up. What she's doing isn't even bad.|`|k57Kvgn8aa	look her in the eye<br>  and use an aussie accent<br>  then say " oi... run at me you gay k u n t!"|`|MXgrlSd0aa	It sounds like you are obsessing over this teacher too much.  You're going to do something you'll regret for a long time if you don't cool down.  Are you doing things to inflame the situation because you enjoy it?  Why are you late for class if you're at school so early?  You don't sound very responsible.  She shouldn't call the class names, but she could still make you feel like an idiot using different and appropriate words.   If she asks if you need extra time then raise your hand and say so.  With your attitude, she could part the seas and walk on water and you'd find fault with her. I know you don't want to hear this, but I think your attitude is the problem. We all have difficult people to deal with in our lives, but the key is our perception of the situation and how we choose to let it anger or not anger us.   This is just middle school & life is so much bigger than this.  Grow up and be responsible.|`|8IfePMa3aa	Get together with some other students that have witness her inappropriate behavior. There is power in numbers - I had a high school teacher that flipped out, after her long string of profanity towards how "stupid little s---s" we are, the entire class went to the principal and that teacher was fired the very next day.|`|ORonhAuvaa	No matter what time you get to school, if you are late to her class, she can legally lock you out.<br>  <br>  Sure, go ahead and deck her. Then you can have the fun of riding in a police car. You can find out what Juvie is like. You will become intimately knowledgeable about the court system in this country.<br>  <br>  This isn't a video game and no matter how much you hate this teacher, you will be in the wrong if you hit her. Sorry you don't want to hear that.<br>  <br>  You seem to be determined to take this course of action. Try to think of it from her perspective. It really hurts when someone hits you. Just imagine your fist smashing into her soft face. She drops to the ground crying and screaming. Have you made your point? Is this going to make you happy? What are the other kids going to think?<br>  <br>  Your response to her is over the top. Put on your big boy undies and act like a man. Do what you have to do to exist in the class. You will be a better person for it. We have all had to suffer idiots. This won't be the last. <br>  <br>  Also, I wonder if you would consider hitting this person if she were a big muscular man. It is a lot harder to kick a German Shepard than a poodle.

8db0578320f91700d4ffe30d808f456eaa	I think you should have a discussion with the whole class about how the sub-teacher may have felt. Maybe personalize her a bit... Talk about how she got the call to come in and she had to rush to find a sitter or get her kids to school (whatever it may be)...maybe discuss how she might have been feeling - excited, maybe a little scared, nervous etc. Then she came into a strange class and people were not nice to her. Talk about how she must have felt at the end of the day - what she might have said to her family etc. Really try to help the kids feel empathy for this teacher. Maybe some role paying would really help. I don't think an unrelated punishment for everyone is going to help the kids behave better next time but I would definitely invite the kids to work on a big card with some nice messages to give the teacher.|`|TanAU2aAaa	my teacher made me right a one page letter to the substitute explaining why i did it and to say sorry, she also made my parents sign it.|`|nqbcJjHyaa	You have an interesting situation. I am a retired teacher and I pick up some "extra" money to treat the grandkids by subbing. I just filled in for quite a few days in many grade levels, the flu was hitting the staff. Maybe because I was experienced, the 5th grades weren't that difficult to handle. The 8th graders though, were a different story, hormones I guess. My suggestion would be to discuss the substitute situation with your class and see what suggestions they would have to improve their behavior the next time they get a sub. And then hold them to it. Make sure your sub plans are workable, you have seating charts, names of "helpful" students, & students to watch out for. In your plans explain to the sub what you expect them to do to control the class with suggestions on behavior management. Odds are it wasn't all the kids fault.|`|hYRP0x2Eaa	What ever you do, don't punish the whole class. I remember being in High school and I would do absolutely nothing and get punished for someone elses actions. After that I would stop being a "nice" student and not give a damn anymore. Punish those that deserve it. I don't know how you would be able to guess who deserves it though. Try not to guess though, because even the well behaved kids act out when a Sub is present. It's just what happens. Not that it should of course. Maybe ask some of the students that you trust what happened. Ask them after class if they can explain to you every thing that happened while you were away. That way you can get a summary of the day and see who was acting out.|`|ORonhAuvaa	Don't punish anyone. You have no idea what she was like. Also, as a teacher, it is your job to set up a system so that subs can control your class. <br>  <br>  Instead of punishing them, teach them how to behave when you have a sub. Let them no your expectations and let them know the consequences for not meeting them. Also, promise them a reward as a class if they do well for your sub.|`|Yc6eUIW9aa	Make them feel ashamed.  Let them know that you thought they were growing up and could behave for someone else.  And that you are very disappointed in them.  Tell them that you thought you would come back and be able to praise them for being on good behavior with a sub and that they might have gotten a surprise.  But not now.|`|0UV0PwDLaa	DO NOT punish the whole class, and unless you can get names from the substitute, don't punish anyone.<br>  <br>  The girl above me is right, when an innocent student is punished they stop caring and misbehave, after all, whats the point of doing good if you get punished anyway? Might as well have fun if you do.<br>  <br>  Also, don't make mental labels of "troublemaker". I wouldn't suggest talking publicly, but rather asking for names/descriptions of the most disruptive and talking privately, one at a time and asking things like, "why did you act this way?" and asking them to stop. Be diplomatic about it, and be respectful towards the kids. <br>  <br>  Alot of times certain students have some authority, or respect, if they're popular or athletic, and students look up to them. If you can talk to one of them, and get them to talk up front(not force) then you will have a profound impact. It will be extremly hard, but the benefits will greatly outweigh the cost.<br>  <br>  Good luck, I will pray for you|`|cad2e212b08a4fdc796050ed1cb2df55aa	I was a substitute teacher for four years before getting my teacher's certificate and misbehaving for a sub is the class' main way to show their anger/distrust/uncertainty at your absence.  Whatever you do as a punishment should not be too drastic but it should encompass all of the students and not pick on a few perpetrators.  Perhaps an extra set of math problems with only a pass/fail grade on something they were to have learned when you were absent - then if they all do poorly, you could give a short lecture on their responsibility to "help" the sub be a better classroom manager since they already know the routine and s/he might not.  I don't always recommend guilt but making them accept some responsibility now might keep down their lack of future misbehavior.  And, you might explain your absence - although they might not ask, they are curious and giving them an explanation shows you have respect for them and understand their behavior without condoning it.|`|8ZPchcEgaa	Have them write a paper on the proper way to behave when they have a substitute, or a letter of apology to the substitute. Grade the papers as an assignment and it will be taken seriously.|`|IY7malv1aa	You should make each of them write an essay of your choice. They all need to write it because its a class effort.

6WjUi3M5aa	The same as any other teacher, it depends on the district. A beginning teacher will start around 30,000. This can be lower in some districts, and a little higher in others. They will max out with a Master's or PHD in about 12 or so years except for small increases per year for time in service. Their top salaries will be around the high 50's or even as high as 70 in some district. <br>  <br>  What is funny is it is assumed on here by many people that high school teachers make more than middle school and elementary teachers. Not the case. They are all teachers in the district, and get paid the same. The only difference is a master degree, PHD, and time in service.

Here in New York I was forced to take at least one year of Spanish, even though I already did 3 years of it in Florida.  <br>  <br>  I've fought with my guidance counselor on plenty of the stupid requirements for credits, and I can tell you for a fact that you're just gonna have to deal with it.  It sucks, I know.<br>  <br>  But try your best to balance the both of them, but you don't wanna fail Spanish and have to take it again.  So if the two languages really conflict that much, you should seriously consider just getting through Spanish for the year and then continuing with the Japanese.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|daD4BbwXaa	deal with it;<br>  be glad you get an education at all|`|91b27b540655ebe4e66c72274b49dd33aa	spanish is the second language comes in handy learn it you will be glad later|`|9ad17317f64f8bb8c54035f89a3929f9aa	My niece is in the same situation as you.  Only she is a anime junkie!  Unfortunately, you would need to take to your school administrators.  How are you learning Japanese???  If you are taking lessons you may be able to make a case for yourself.  If you are teaching yourself, sorry to say, you will be learning spanish.|`|XpWjdPg2aa	So... maybe just suck it up? I don't know, but if you're planning on changing schools soon it can't be all bad. First year Spanish is really, really easy. They won't be hard on you, and then you can just try to forget all of it later if you really want to. And who knows, it might prove useful. There are many Spanish speakers in the US, and not many Japanese.|`|3swZV9uUaa	It may be a requirement at school for you to do so and its okay if your a little bit stress im still in high school and i know 7 different languages not including spanish and english so its really difficult buy hey you just need to study a little hard...

yaVoRsnJaa	Teachers and students should NOT be friends.  That's final.  Their relationship should ONLY be that of teacher and student.  That's not to say that a teacher should be mean to a student, but there's a line to draw at when to stop being nice and friendly.<br>  <br>  And the woman is completely to blame.  No matter what actions the boy was taking (making advances, flirting, etc.) SHE is the adult, not him.  And SHE knows what is right and wrong, not him obviously.  So she is to blame and deserved what she got.|`|ZllkWRIOaa	damn... lucky guy if she was hot|`|wTYPomqQaa	SHE! she has more authority than him she is an adult she should know what he is doing, hmm he aint that much of a child he is just driven by hormones well my opinion is that if a child is 15 and up they know what they are doing is wrong! they are young adults and they shouldnt be doing that i mean come on imagine if it was a 17 year old how would the 17 year old not be to blame to? they are old enough to drive get a job see an r rated movie right?|`|chnydMqAaa	How come none of these teachers are at my school?
1505a95e660275609c4bb43c388cdf1aaa	Go talk to your teacher.  Find out how many assignments you have left and how much they are worth, and how well you'd have to do to raise your grade, if it's still possible.|`|Yc6eUIW9aa	Ask if you can do something for extra credit.<br>  ..

But I agree well this semester and next semester work really well and don't miss a lot of days! Oh and if you have a final grade on your report card than that will determine if you get your credit and your final exams.
C4YVzOfzaa	Yes, it is.  A lot of people go to school while still working.
JoyIIiZ6aa	Since Pell is income based, you would have to check how much you made that year, because that would have affected how much you got.  However, when there is a discrepancy such as this, it might be a good idea to make an appointment with the Financial Aid office, preferably not with just any underling working there.  Pull up the data, make sure you have all the info correct, and it shows how much you were awarded and what the disbursement was, your income for that year, and then ask where the other 2500 went.<br>  <br>  Good luck.  Pulling money out of a college is just about as easy at taking away dinner from a pack of wolves.  They get you coming and going.|`|mnm3jpjqaa	collegefinder.imess.net - try this site.

zJIv8EoQaa	Sure you can. All you need to do is look at your school's requirements for getting these majors and minor. Sometimes, you can satisfy both major and/or minor with one class. Try to find an adviser in the school and ask them for the requirements. Usually, they can also help you plan the schedule you need to graduate for your whole time in college. Good luck!!
plhfe5Zaaa	I'm not sure how to get around the problem but my schools use Microsoft products and none of my computers came with the program. My family couldn't afford it so I ended up downloading it illegally and used a random key code. This was the only way I could complete school work. There wasn't enough time given during the day and I wasn't gonna stay after school as I didn't have a ride home. I doubt they are doing anything about it. I think schools or the government should offer people the programs used in the schools for a discounted price.
AA10461474	The ASVAB is supposed to demonstrate what job you'd be best qualified for in the Army, not whether or not you're qualified to serve (I suppose there's a fine line there). I agree with you...if someone without a high school diploma or GED scores well on the ASVAB and wants to serve & is in every other way qualified (physically fit, etc.), why not serve? My father, who is now 87, quit high school, lied about his age and joined the Army in 1942, then fought in WWII. At some point he got a GED,and graduated from college on the GI bill. He doesn't recommend taking that route anymore. But, clearly one can serve successfully with or without a diploma. Just my opinion.<br>  <br>  P.S. The Navy was an excellent alternative choice!|`|ETqZU5D9aa	The point of having a diploma is that it shows you stuck with school and didn't quit which they think means you'll stick to military without quitting. It's just that they want to make sure you can focus and do what needs to be done, regardless of intellect.|`|ec55348158c3fd8764f5daba79c0af3daa	Right now the military services in general are doing fairly well with their recruiting.  There are enough volunteers that the services can afford to be a little selective.<br>  <br>  A diploma or GED is just one of several criteria.  A failing ASVAB score will also keep a potential recruit out of the service.<br>  <br>  A good recruit will perform well in basic training and in the specialty training which follows.  High School graduation or equivalency is just one of several indicators of a good recruit.<br>  <br>  <br>  In different times with different needs the services might well be less selective and might drop some of the current requirements.
X7PQJQvMaa	Scout is a very innocent character. She is a young girl who only knows what is around her, and yet she isn't exactly the "pristine" southern belle most might think she would be. Scout's a tomboy, so if you were to dress up as her, I'd wear something kind of boyish. If you have overalls or ripped jeans, I'd bring those out. A plaid shirt would work wonderfully!<br>  <br>  For Atticus, you're best bet would be the exact opposite. In the novel, Atticus is a well to-do lawyer. He is proper while not proud and stout while not overzealous. Something formal would be perfect for Attitcus's character. If your brother/father has a suit that would fit you, that would be good to wear. However, if your out of luck with that, a simple dress shirt, slacks, and dress shoes would be fine, too.<br>  <br>  I hope your project goes over good!!!|`|DAbx7mq9aa	dress as scout...she was a tomb boy so.....wear some rolled up overralls and dirty looking striped **** tome boyish) i guess or wear a dress with tennis shoes two tonytails and a football purse something like that!!!! or easier dress as calpurnia just get some dress with flowers a smock and sliver platter (dress like a maide)|`|OuwzKFOdaa	Just dress up as Scout.

HymZPYNpaa	Well, A* - C is basically what you need. I suppose a grammar school student should aim higher than a C but there are no expectations that anything lower than an A* is bad.

Even if you wanted to do a job or a course where you needed latin at GCSE they'd normally only require a C, definately not more than a B. The most important subjects for you to get C's or more are English Lanugage and Maths. But a B's and C's are great, just remember that only about 50% of kids in this country get 5 C grades at GCSE, so you're doing realllllllllllly good to get mostly A's and A*'s! But I didnt find GCSEs as hard as I thought they would be, but still revise loads, I did and it was so worth it on results day! Good luck / bon chance (french will have to do as i dont know any latin lol) x|`|A9NBtUy6aa	No B is not bad at all! C is not even bad.<br>  <br>  There is often too much pressure put on us to get As and A*s, but GCSEs mean very little in the real world, and one B amongst As and A*s will not make a jot of difference!|`|HgZo9GlFaa	Bs are fine, you know apparently the average amount of gcses someone gets is only 5, so you'd still be beating everyone else. :)|`|m4nKkFDUaa	Start getting worried when you get Cs or Ds!

5bcd24aaf56518f68f3b66519c581d5caa	tell her that you want to go to a school that has afterschool activites. tell her your teacher is pushing things on you that as nothing to do wiht school it has to do with a personal choice and she is mean about it when you tell her nicely that you are not interested. tell her the pros and cons of a school that you already looked and did research on. that you can actually prove to her that it will be better for you. you have to do your research and if you do that and you do it well she will take you seriously you can not just go up to her and say my teacher hates me and this school stinks. you have to have evidence to back you up, YOu have to have your homework done about the school you want to switch too. <br>  good luck|`|rZ9qhj2daa	Change your habits.

09d9750d5acfccad87d87bf60d3f5d97aa	Depends on the state you live in and the school district.  I teach and it is one of the cardinal rules here...NEVER have a student in your car that is not your offspring. Why?  The school's insurance will not cover you and the teacher will be personally liable for anything that occurs as a result of the ride.  If the parents accuse the teacher of doing something to the student during the ride, the teacher is on their own, no support from the school, district or state agency.|`|ORonhAuvaa	Isn't this a sad state of affairs? I remember giving kids rides back in the 80's when it was hot or if they missed their rides. I also used to take kids who had few opportunities, with me to go fishing, to basketball games and state fairs. In those days, parents trusted teachers. Now, you have to ask if someone is bad for asking to help you out.<br>  <br>  I don't understand. Because a few bad apples have spoiled our reputation, we can no longer have fun with kids outside of the classroom. Too bad.|`|WQcxODKLaa	creepy .<br>  yeah, good job for turning down the offer .<br>  <br>  you're parents would have went crazy .|`|kSZx9cY5aa	I teach, and on occasion I have given students rides in instances such as them missing their bus, if we are going to the same place after school (such as a rehearsal), if they are coming with me to set something up or if they have stayed behind after school for a rehearsal, performance or to set something up. In most of those cases I have to get it approved with the principal and sometimes their parents. The main reason is that if I have an accident, the school and myself would be held liable. Also these days teachers have to be really careful about being alone with students. <br>  2 of my children attend the same school (though one is on a different campus) and if they have friends coming over after school i'm fine to drive them.<br>  <br>  I'm sure your teacher was just trying to do a nice thing by offering you a ride, but it was probably a good idea to turn her down. If your parents became angry at her she could get in a lot of trouble. Also if anyone saw you they might assume there is "favouritismsm" or something more going on.<br>  Cheers :)|`|Sz3nMAcaaa	Well, i guess it isn't a great idea to offer a student a ride because if another student saw you, they would think that the teacher prefers you better than everyone else.

A9NBtUy6aa	It's really hard to fake intelligence. The best thing to do is start to increase your vocabulary- that's best achieved by reading books, or if you want to do it the hard way, learning one word at a time from a dictionary, or an online dictionary that emails you a "word of the day" every day.<br>  <br>  Here's some words to start with that i like: <br>  Opisthodomos- back porch of a greek temple.<br>  Ultracrepidarian- someone who pretends they know everything and bullsh*ts a lot about stuff they don't know about.<br>  Vocabularian- me, someone who has a wide vocabulary.<br>  Oxymoronic- contradictory phrases, like "sweet and sour" or "burning cold"|`|o8o689x5aa	Just be yourself.

4c2cb618b8c167d7beb0c2cc5a36fe4faa	Solids and liquids transmit forces differently. When force is applied to one section of a solid, this force is transmitted to the other parts to the other parts of the solid with its direction unchanged. Because of the fluid's ability to flow, it transmits the force uniformly in all the directions. Therefore the pressure at any point at rest is the same in all directions.<br>  <br>  So, D - 'Liquids exert pressure in all directions', is one of the correct options.<br>  <br>  Liquids transmit pressure because they are barely compressible. So when a force is applied the liquid molecules cannot be "squished" together, and they move their neighboring molecules who likewise do the same to their neighbors, and so on.<br>  <br>  So, C - 'Liquids transmit pressure but solids transmit force', is the other correct option.|`|48WkXo1Taa	D.

ORonhAuvaa	Here is a list of characteristics of gifted and talented. From what you listed, you would not meet the criteria for gifted but for significantly above average. I include these characteristics to see if you can read them and see how many match you. The reason I did this is that I have many of these characteristics, but I didn't know I was gifted until fairly  late in life. I made friends with a gifted teacher and she told me that I was! See if most of these fit.<br>  <br>  By the way, your parents can ask that you be tested for gifted and the school will do an IQ and a checklist. Ask your guidance counselor about it.<br>  <br>   *  Advanced vocabulary for chronological age<br>      * Outstanding memory; possesses lots of information<br>      * Curious; asks endless questions ("why?"

Finding people to relate, just open up!  Try to be easy to read.|`|Xtqq71KGaa	sounds gifted to me|`|DTkAVdk4aa	I think you are both gifted and smart.  What grade are you in?  <br>  <br>  I have a hard time finding people to relate with, too.  I get picked on a lot by kids my own age because I am so smart.  So I feel more comfortable with older kids and grown ups.  Then there are times when grown ups forget that I am a just kid and that makes me feel weird, too.  One thing I can’t figure out is my Mom says I’m smarter than her, but she still gives me spankings!<br>  <br>  I think it is cool that you like to read lots of books.  Like you, I love math and science.  I like algebra, calculus, and physics.  My TV doesn’t work now that the signal is digital so I read sci-fi novels for fun.<br>  <br>  It can be hard to make friends sometimes unless you go to one of those special schools.  If you go to public school you can still have friends, but you just have to act like a regular kid as best you can, have fun and do kid stuff.|`|3d7f120f2bf9906d7333799542b3a295aa	You are normal.  That's the way everyone should be.  But  most people are lost in their emotions, video games, tv, drugs, you name it, so they miss the gift that is in them naturally.<br>  <br>  However, these are all achievement things. There is so much more to life, and there is one thing everyone needs before they pass into eternity, and I don't see that on your list.|`|8ZO8o6Hdaa	well i mean you shouldn't have to ask other people if you think you're smart, especially people that don't know you.  You should be able to determine your intelligence by yourself.  I mean it's almost like you asked this question expecting everyone to agree with you, and yea I agree that you are smart, but we barely have an idea what you're like.  My suggestion is ask people that actually know you i.e your teacher or parents or brother or peers.<br>  <br>  Sorry, but most of what people say on here are going to be highly inaccurate due to the fact that we have no idea who you are.  I'm NOT putting you down at all and i'm NOT saying that you aren't smart, know that, but I just feel that you shouldnt be asking total strangers.

RjFn6QQDaa	I did Art in 2004, got an A, I didn't too half as much work as my classmates yet got the same grade - my art teacher always said it was down to QUALITY and not QUANTITY. So just make some notes next to some of your pictures, do some research on what artists you are going to emulate - copy some of their pictures and make notes on them. That's all I did.<br>  I was on AQA.|`|A9NBtUy6aa	Just keep going at it. Try to think further into your subjects that you are studying (for instance barriers- emotional barriers- abuse- apartheid), and, if you are stuck, just go for quantity!<br>  <br>  What is your exam title, it will help us help you?

AA10101934	If you hold on to angry feelings you get hurt more so than the person you are mad at.  You have to get your feelings out, try yelling or punching something like your bed, not at someone and you'll feel better, because sometimes just talking your feelings out aren't enough.|`|dCtTXwACaa	Straight forward. If you try staying angry at someone not only will it affect them but you'll get harmed as well.|`|mrysAOpGaa	holding on to anger is, pointless. Staying angry at someone is pointless.  And in the end, you're going to be the one to get burned, not the person you're mad at.

The cost of in-state college tuition has grown 35 percent over the past five years. Health care costs have risen four times faster than wages over the past six years. And the personal savings rate is now the lowest it's been since the Great Depression.<br>  Tax Cuts for Wealthy Instead of Middle Class: The Bush tax cuts give those who earn over $1 million dollars a tax cut nearly 160 times greater than that received by middle-income Americans. At the same time, this administration has refused to tackle health care, education and housing in a manner that benefits the middle class.<br>  Barack Obama and Joe Biden's Plan<br>  <br>  Jumpstart the Economy<br>  Enact a Windfall Profits Tax to Provide a $1,000 Emergency Energy Rebate to American Families:Barack Obama and Joe Biden will enact a windfall profits tax on excessive oil company profits to give American families an immediate $1,000 emergency energy rebate to help families pay rising bills. This relief would be a down payment on the Obama-Biden long-term plan to provide middle-class families with at least $1,000 per year in permanent tax relief.<br>  Provide $50 billion to Jumpstart the Economy and Prevent 1 Million Americans from Losing Their Jobs: This relief would include a $25 billion State Growth Fund to prevent state and local cuts in health, education, housing, and heating assistance or counterproductive increases in property taxes, tolls or fees. The Obama-Biden relief plan will also include $25 billion in a Jobs and Growth Fund to prevent cutbacks in road and bridge maintenance and fund school re pair - all to save more than 1 million jobs in danger of being cut.<br>  Provide Middle Class Americans Tax Relief<br>  Obama and Biden will cut income taxes by $1,000 for working families to offset the payroll tax they pay.<br>  Provide a Tax Cut for Working Families: Obama and Biden will restore fairness to the tax code and provide 150 million workers the tax relief they need. Obama and Biden will create a new "Making Work Pay" tax credit of up to $500 per person, or $1,000 per working family. The "Making Work Pay" tax credit will completely eliminate income taxes for 10 million Americans.<br>  Eliminate Income Taxes for Seniors Making Less than $50,000: Barack Obama will eliminate all income taxation of seniors making less than $50,000 per year. This proposal will eliminate income taxes for 7 million seniors and provide these seniors with an average savings of $1,400 each year. Under the Obama-Biden plan, 27 million American seniors will also not need to file an income tax return.<br>  Simplify Tax Filings for Middle Class Americans: Obama and Biden will dramatically simplify tax filings so that millions of Americans will be able to do their taxes in less than five minutes. Obama and Biden will ensure that the IRS uses the information it already gets from banks and employers to give taxpayers the option of pre-filled tax forms to verify, sign and return.

He will stand firm against agreements that undermine our economic security.<br>  Fight for Fair Trade: Obama and Biden will fight for a trade policy that opens up foreign markets to support good American jobs. They will use trade agreements to spread good labor and environmental standards around the world and stand firm against agreements like the Central American Free Trade Agreement that fail to live up to those important benchmarks. Obama and Biden will also pressure the World Trade Organization to enforce trade agreements and stop countries from continuing unfair government subsidies to foreign exporters and nontariff barriers on U.S. exports.<br>  Amend the North American Free Trade Agreement: Obama and Biden believe that NAFTA and its potential were oversold to the American people.

kCqBRu0Zaa	LOL try speaking spanish, dutch, french or something i could help you lol i speak spanish dutch and english fluently<br>  or you could try and say everything about technology cuz boys are intrested in technology lol<br>  oh and here are some complicated formulas:<br>  You can compare two cells, A2 and A3, like this:<br>  <br>  =IF(VLOOKUP(A2, E2:F3, 2, FALSE) - VLOOKUP(A3, E2:F3, 2, FALSE), "A2 is larger", "A3 is<br>  larger") <br>   heres anothere one:<br>  minimizing x + y + z,<br>  if your answer is 55, then there should only be a packet of 50 and another packet of 5, so x+y+z = 2.<br>  <br>  we should establish here that z < 4, for 4z = y, AND y < 5, for 5y = 2x.<br>  <br>  11 = x + y + z, so x is at least 4.<br>  if y + z = 7, then y = 4 and z = 3.<br>  N, number of copies = 4*20 + 3*5 = 95 > 50.<br>  for 95, 95 = 1*50 + 2*20 + 1*5 is a better way to dispatch, since (1+2+1) = 4 < 7.<br>  <br>  so we need to find 20y + 5z < 50, while MAXIMIZING y + z.<br>  y = 1, z = 3 is the only solution.<br>  (x,y,z) = (7,1,3)<br>  so answer, N<br>  = 50x + 20y + 5z<br>  = 50*7 + 20*1 + 5*3<br>  = 385|`|6t76bgS3aa	much to the scientist's consternation, the rock that he thought was igneous turned out to be sedimentary, lol|`|AA10409832	Throwing big words around doesn't make you smart, it only tends to make the person you're talking to think you are "talking down" to him/her.  If you really want to make yourself better, in an educational sense, start by reading the newspaper or magazines.  Read some articles that you find interesting, and then incorporate them into your conversations.  Make sure, in your conversations, you allow the other person to talk (and you must listen).  Don't monopolize the conversation, just to show the other person that you've read something interesting.  Find out what interests him too.  Good luck.

EdNNmM7jaa	You'll hate it now and love it later.  If you hate it, it means that you are doing bad or not telling your parents about tests.  It encourages students to be more responsible whether they like it or not.  Later in life, when you have a better grade in high school and hopefully go to a better college and make more money, you'll be glad for the relatively small amount of stress caused by Edline.

unwVkSSQaa	it is not necessary that you get scholarship its only depend on your marks but its the truth that you get more knowldge and further benefits after completing SPM.
EStnAfF9aa	when someone says its all a matter of principle its the same as saying a moral basis for not doing something. like lets say you wont lend your friend anymore money bc he never pays you back and you want him to know that he cant borrow money without returning it to you. <br>  <br>  so you would say.... im not lending my friend more money not bc i dont have it but as a matter of principle.
sRw9oiQdaa	You need to man up and tell them.  I am assuming that you are old enough to be responsible for whether or not you are getting to school.  This is an immense gift that you have been throwing away by not attending.  If it has gotten so serious that a letter has been sent, you need to sit down with your parents and own up.  Think of a plan for how you will make this right.  Agree to and follow up with attending class, on time and every day. It is not too late to fix this. If you are skipping because of your friends or because you are struggling, admit this and enter discussions to find a solution (where will your friends be in 10 years when you don't even have a high school diploma?).  If you struggle, I can sympathize.  Ask for help - a tutor, your parents, other students.  Remember, even if you are not the best in class, or even near the top, you learn something just by being there.  Is it not better to increase your knowledge, no matter by how much.  Judge yourself against you, not other people and you can succeed no matter what.|`|hkbWhfCiaa	Can you tell them you have to work on an assigment to have an excuss to go to the meeting?

qrKcusGPaa	Course you get a loan!  You can get a grant which depends on your income, a maintenance loan for food, clothes, nights out etc, and a tuition loan for the course fee. I went to a visit day to Leeds and Manchester, and the students there basically went out every night (1st years though), and live on their overdraft. You don't have to pay the loan back until you're earning over 15k a year, and even then you only pay back 10% of what you earn.<br>  <br>  You won't be skint all the time if you live away, you just need to manage your money correctly. And you will be able to go out!<br>  <br>  It depends where you live, whether you should move out or not. Personally, I think that if you have to wake up really early in the morning to travel to uni, then you may as well stay there. I'm assuming that graphic design takes a lot of time and effort, so could you really waste a couple of hours a day travelling? Besides, the facilities after lectures etc at the unis will be so much better than at home, and you'lll have people to work alongside with.<br>  <br>  Also, take a look at these:<br>  <a href="http://search.ucas.co.uk/cgi-bin/hsrun/search/search/StateId/DMV5rwczdwqGAdYbbypHcPKGTJzRC-U4J_/HAHTpage/search.HsKeywordSuggestion.whereNext?query=1022&word=GRAPHIC+DESIGN&single=N" rel="nofollow">http://search.ucas.co.uk/cgi-bin/hsrun/s...</a><br>  <br>  Graphic design branches out into many disciplines.<br>  <br>  You also need to predict what grades you're likely to achieve reallistically. Then look at the unis which accept those kind of grades.<br>  <br>  Good luck

EkhEvfXFaa	I think the big thing to think about is inflation, particularly if you are in the US with the way money is being printed and debt is being built up.<br>  <br>  $1 today is worth more than $1 in the future so any investment would have to keep you ahead of inflation so that your money doesn't lose it's value.<br>  <br>  If you do invest then reinvesting both the principal and the interest will make your money grow faster, but don't forget the tax that will have to be paid ... the after tax growth will have to stay ahead of inflation.<br>  <br>  Of course you can't save all your money because you are going to have to buy stuff but probably the best thing to do is buy only what you really need and can pay cash for, and don't get caught having to pay interest on credit (except for the really expensive stuff you may eventually want to buy ... like a house)<br>  <br>  But if you can't keep ahead of inflation with your investments then you might as well spend it now because it'll be worth more ... and I definitely wouldn't be buying shares because you can't trust the so called experts who are running their companies (into the ground) and ripping off their shareholders by giving themselves hugh bonuses for stuffing up their companies ... actually come to think of it ... they are the ones responsible for the total financial mess that we are in today.<br>  <br>  I'll shutup now.|`|CYFCzEJtaa	both|`|DoYQeqGhaa	duh, put some money away and invest it or put it in the bank and get compound interest on it, but leave part of your weekly wage o send now for "miscelaneous uses"|`|hr3DNw8Haa	Money is so useful but think about the ones you love first.|`|xj9NY7xDaa	spend  the Lot and be happy

I also have to be in a quiet room with no distractions and it really does depend on the subject. For example with my German I go over and over the text again and try remembering it. Make flashcards too, they are good, write the question on one side and the answer on the other. Get some post it notes and stick them around the house where you will see them like the fridge or your mirror. Very few people learn from just reading.

2lQ8DJAcaa	Geologists and geomorphologists describe the Earth's geologic history through a temporal system known as the geologic time scale (Table 1). On this scale, time is measured using the following four units of time: eons, eras, periods and epochs. All of these temporal subdivisions are established on the occurrence of some important geologic event. For example, Hadean Eon represents the time on Earth when life did not exist. During the Archean Eon life started and was dominated by one-celled prokaryotic life forms. Eukaryotic one-celled organisms became dominant in the Proterozoic Eon. Multicellular organisms ruled the planet during the eon known as the Phanerozoic.

e6923297a9e9b6a1da8be3748d9facb9aa	The Erasmus Mundus programme is a co-operation and mobility programme in the field of higher education. It aims to enhance quality in European higher education and to promote intercultural understanding through co-operation with third countries. It runs from 2004 to 2008.<br>  <br>  The programme is intended to strengthen European co-operation and international links in higher education by supporting high-quality European Masters Courses, enabling students and visiting scholars from around the world to engage in postgraduate study at European higher education institutions, as well as encouraging the outgoing mobility of European students and scholars towards third countries.<br>  <br>  The Erasmus Mundus programme has a budget of 230 million euros, 90% of which go into scholarships. <br>  <br>  The programme comprises four concrete actions:<br>  <br>  ACTION 1 - Erasmus Mundus Masters Courses: these courses constitute the central component around which Erasmus Mundus is built. They are high-quality Masters level programmes offered by a consortium of higher education institutions in at least three different European countries. The courses must be ?integrated? to be selected under Erasmus Mundus, which means that they must foresee a study period in at least two of the three institutions and lead to the award of a recognised double, multiple or joint degree. <br>  ACTION 2 - Erasmus Mundus scholarships: in order to give the Erasmus Mundus Masters Courses selected under Action 1 a strong external projection, a scholarship scheme for third-country graduate students and scholars is linked to them. This scholarship scheme funds highly qualified individuals who come to Europe to follow the Erasmus Mundus Masters Courses or to work for them. <br>  ACTION 3 - Partnerships: in order to encourage European higher education institutions to open themselves up to the world and to reinforce their world-wide presence, Erasmus Mundus Masters Courses selected under Action 1 also have the possibility of establishing partnerships with third-country higher education institutions. These partnerships allow for outgoing mobility of graduate EU students and scholars involved in the Erasmus Mundus Masters Courses. <br>  ACTION 4 - Enhancing attractiveness: Erasmus Mundus also supports projects aimed at enhancing the attractiveness of, and the interest in, European higher education. It supports activities that improve the profile, the visibility and the accessibility of European higher education as well as issues crucial to the internationalisation of higher education, such as the mutual recognition of qualifications with third countries. Higher education institutions and other public and private organisations active in the field of higher education play a key role in this action. <br>  In concrete terms, over the course of the first programme period (2004-8), Erasmus Mundus will support about 100 Erasmus Mundus Masters Courses of outstanding academic quality. It will provide scholarships for some 6,000 graduate students from third countries to follow these Masters Courses, and for more than 4,000 EU graduate students involved in these courses to study in third countries. The programme will also offer teaching or research scholarships in Europe for over 1,000 incoming third-country academics and for a similar number of outgoing EU scholars. Last but not least, Erasmus Mundus will support about 60 partnerships between Erasmus Mundus Masters Courses and higher education institutions in third countries. <br>  <br>  <br>  Dr. P.K.Tandon<br>  <br>  .........................................<br>  <br>  Quick Note<br>  <br>  (1)   Yes for Admission Process click on the following link -<br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.mundusjournalism.com/apply.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.mundusjournalism.com/apply.ht...</a><br>  <br>  (2)  Dont put it on Vote.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  .........................................
JoyIIiZ6aa	If it can be anything at all, why not use some of your daydreaming as a springboard? Are you interested in some specific historical period or figure?  Do you wish you could have been there to see some event?  Why not use that? E.g. <br>  Our field trip to the museum of fabrics and clothes turned out to be just as boring as I expected, with our guide droning on and on about cotton, linen, silk, polymers and who knows what else.  I tuned him out and slowed down until I stayed completely behind my class.  No one noticed.  I don't think anyone cared.  I veered to the left and came to an abrupt halt in front of the most amazing dress I had ever seen. I wanted to feel the silk and the heavy golden embroidery, so I boldly climbed over the rope to reach for the dress.  When my fingers touched it a shock of recognition washed over me.  I KNEW the dress! I HAD WORN it!  There was the missing seed pearl on the sleeve that I had picked off when I stood waiting to see...<br>  <br>  Well, that's all the creative juices I can squeeze out of myself at 4 in the morning):  Good luck, and have fun with your assignment.|`|fqIE566Caa	use your life experiences to help you<br>  you could write a short story from a dead persons perspective, why are they dead, what they regret, are they lookin down upon someone? think lovely bones. i'm not very creative but you could start it from looking at your own body and describing it, for example "As I see the white lifeless figure, I begin to collect my thoughts.

J6Ksn0P7aa	Boyle's law states that at a constant temperature the pressure of a gas is inversely proportional to its volume.  Meaning that in a closed system if you decrease the volume then you increase the pressure.<br>  PV=K  where p and v represent pressure and volume and K is a constant that refers to a constant temperature and mass of the gas.<br>  <br>  When you squeeze a balloon you are decreasing the volume of the air space which makes the pressure in the balloon increase, which can be seen by the air spreading the rubber in the balloon thinner, until it pops.

Dont think private school kids dont get in trouble because we do. my school is really strict.|`|2stBV6XBaa	Private school is no guarantee that you will go far in life.  It's your grades, test scores, etc that will get into college.  Design and art schools are often less concerned with your grade in science and all that.  They want to see you have talent, so they are looking at your portfolio.<br>  <br>  I had a friend who went off to private school for high school because it was supposedly better than public (also in NJ).  Well, I went to the public high school, and we were one of the top high schools in NJ.  We consistently were in the top of the list for scores on standardized tests in the state, and no one ever seemed to have a problem getting into college.
9faf164b8bfd02a8adbd83229d74816baa	Yeah, but you must remember that it has to emphasize the point you're trying to make. So make sure the wording supports your argument and that it makes sense.
PfE6bg5iaa	Residency guidelines vary between colleges within the state. Legally, you can go to another state and get your driver's license changed over to the state and you are now a resident. College's make it harder so they can rake in the tuition cash from out of state students. It's basically an application process, you give your case with things such as copy of drivers license, paycheck stubs, utility bills... and the college can either deny or approve your residency.<br>  <br>  Here at University of Michigan, not only do you have to have lived in the state for a year, you also have to prove that you can and are supporting yourself entirely with a Michigan job which is "not normally held by a student." Makes it near impossible to come from another state and claim residency. <br>  <br>  So, tuition will be a lot cheaper ($10-$20K) if you go to a state college with residency in that state, but you'll have to check out the specific school that you're considering going to to determine residency guidelines. I bet they have it on their website.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|2Av3gIqgaa	You have to live in FL for one year to receive resident status for college.  I'm not exactly sure what documentation you have to provide, but I'm pretty sure that a FL driver license or identification card that was issue 12 months prior would work.  Another option is 12 months worth of electric bills for a property in the state that is in your name.<br>  <br>  Benefits are that non-residents pay about 3X as much to go to college in FL.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|w9vnL4Mzaa	I believe you have to reside in Florida for at least 12 months. It might be 18 months or 24 months, it depends on the state. The benefits are if you go to a public university (University of Florida), then you pay the "In-state" tuition rather than the "Non-resident" tuition. This is usually about 10-20 thousand cheaper. <br>  <br>  The reason it is cheaper is because Florida citizens pay taxes to the state of Florida, and then the state pays the public universities so that they can run and don't have to charge ridiculous tuitions (even though they pretty much do). Therefore, if you reside in Florida, they assume that you have been paying the taxes, so you are essentially paying for your college ahead of time through tax.<br>  <br>  HOWEVER, if you are going to enroll in a private university, then there is no difference because private institutions do not receive funding from the state, and there is no in-state or non-resident, fee, its usually just one fat 50k/year.
B33ZUBpvaa	WARNING: LOOOOOOONGass answer.<br>  <br>  Ahh. Good question for me to answer. I am 18 and graduated at 16 because I hated school so much. I got into trouble and I never went. <br>  So I understand you completely, so hear me out. <br>  Sorry if my answer is a little unorganized. <br>  <br>  LEGALLY, your parents are supposed to make you go to school. First you'll get an oral warning from your counselor, they'll probably tell your parents too. Then they'll give you a written warning from the district if it continues to be a problem. And then if you continue, your parents will have to go to court. If it continues after that, your parents will be in deep trouble and so will you. <br>  <br>  Academically you're capable, you say. What grade are you in? Sometimes things get a lot tougher. And once you're in the habit of skipping school, you'll probably stop paying attention even when you go, too. I know how that is. Make sure you pay attention and actually work when you're there. Don't be a slacker. <br>  <br>  When your teacher or some other staff calls you out on your missed days - don't have an attitude. Say things like "I know, and I am working on it. It's tough, but I am making an effort, and it will get better. I know I have to own up, and I know I have to stop, and that is what I am trying to do." Make sure you tell them you're stopping, even if you're not. Talk to them in respectful tones. You gotta keep em off your backs! If you give them attitude, EVEN IF THEY DESERVE IT, it'll just make things tougher. They'll start watching your case specifically and making things trouble for you. And that's no good! Don't do my thing, and flip them off and walk away and yell at them and all that. That was absolutely not a good thing for me to do and made it a billion times tougher than it needed to be. <br>  <br>  It really depends what grade you're in. I say don't go full-on skip all the time (meaning more than once a week) mode until senior year or junior if you're confident. Senior year doesn't matter much unless you're trying to make up credits. <br>  Until then, don't skip more than 3 days a month. And DON'T skip on important days. Make sure you know what's going on the next day. It's better to just deal with it if it's something important that will bring you down. <br>  ALSO MAKE SURE you know each of your teacher's rules. A lot of teachers will mark you down for skipping days. If that's the case, don't skip as much school, or do a ton of extra credit. <br>  <br>  When you're older you'll want to look back on things. When that happens, skipping school will be what you remember. So make sure your skipped days are worth it. Do great things. Do new things. You'll remember this. But you'll also want to remember how you did tough things and got through it. I do that now, and I'm only 18. So I'm not just talking about when you're old and wrinkley. You'll reflect back and when you do that, you'll feel like sht if anything is missing. You'll want to remember the bull you had to go through in school, and the fact that you survived it all. You'll want to remember that lunch time fun, and the drama, and the good, and academic projects and everything. <br>  <br>  When I personally look back, I see me flipping off the principal, getting arrested off campus because I finally showed up after a week and the campus police officer was in the mood to get me in trouble for ditching. That was all not so fun. I remember those grueling days in class, and I'm glad I stuck through them. I remember having great adventures while skipping school. But honestly? Just remember that sure you'll have to drag yourself through school most days, but so does everyone else and they hate it too, and remember that in a week, that day won't matter anymore, and you'll have gotten through it. <br>  <br>  Also, do you know what you want to do with life? If you don't, keep going to school, you might need superb grades if you end up doing certain things, when you figure it out. <br>  <br>  Anyway, remember.... no more than 3 days missed in a month. That's almost one a week. Do 4 if you absolutely must. But make sure it's worth it. Don't do it on test days, or other important days. <br>  <br>  AAaaaaand remember.... in life, you'll have to do a shtload of things you don't want to do. You'll have to get a job and there's noooo way you'll be able to skip days in that. Just think of school as training for the future.... life is friggin tough. I know you know that already, but it is. Just realize you can skip a littttttle bit now but you won't be able to after you graduate. <br>  <br>  And don't drag your friends down too. They might need school more than you do - don't convince them to skip. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Hm what am I missing...<br>  <br>  Okay hopefully you listened to me, since I'm not some uptight whatever.... I'm 18, a college student, after doing all that I did in high school. If you want to ask me any questions or talk or whatever, I'm your girl, just email me (give me your MySpace URL if you have one, it's easier to talk on there than email) - nancy.nitrate [at] yahoo.com. <br>  I'm good with advice ;)|`|Nuuk1Nwtaa	It actually is illegal to be truant. That's why they used to have truant officers. And if the school decides you're missing too many days without good reason, they will give you detention and discipline you. Keep in mind also that if you plan on going to college, they will notice your spotty attendance record and not take you.|`|AA10051614	it really depends on the teacher. in public school, usually yes, attendance is a large part of your grade. in college, in many classes, participation was at least 1/3rd of the grade. very few profs actually took attendance, because if the class was small enough to see if you were there or not, it was obvious if youre there or not. and if you do show up but just sit there (especially in discusison intensive classes like english), and dont participate, it would count against you.<br>  <br>  but other classes are sometimes all about tests/papers and thats it. one class had 3 tests and each was worth 1/3 of your grade.<br>  <br>  another had 25% participation, 25% on the two main tests and 50% for the final, etc.<br>  <br>  so it really depends.<br>  <br>  as per your request, i wont tell you that youre being foolish. i wont tell you that life is about doing things you dont want to do, and doing things you hate builds and shows character. i wont tell you that backing out of things you hate makes you look like incompetent. <br>  <br>  i wont tell you that you are only setting yourself up for failure, and if you need to ask this, you know you arent doing the right thing. so i wont tell you that i think you wont change no matter what we say, and you just want to hear answers that reaffirm what you want to believe.<br>  <br>  so with that said, yes. you will be just fine. keep hiding from things you dislike and you will succeed.

g1SpYhbBaa	Heh 9th grader ,<br>                       A big huge warm welcome to the homeschooling world!<br>  ( the real world!) I mean it! Here you will find fun, friendship and begin the most exciting journey of a lifetime. A journey to discover YOU! and what your unique talents are and how to best use them.<br>   I'm an Australian homeschooling Mum of nine who has been homeschooling for 15 years and I think I know enough about homeschooling to help you out. However I'm from Australia but the basic principles still apply. We here in Australia have a lot to thank our American brethren for in the way of homeschooling pioneering and materials. They are HUGE over there and such an inspiration to all the rest of us.<br>  Lots of Aussies buy their materials and we have speakers come out from the States as well to speak at our  homeschool conferences ect<br>  <br>   The first thing to do is take a big breath and RELAX! Look at the beautiful world around you and thank God for your parents who are going to give it a go homeschooling. Don't forget to give them lots of hugs and encouragement. They need it as they begin the journey with you. Be patient with them and always communicate as effectively as you can so they can help you properly. <br>  Home becomes the center of your universe once you start homeschooling and its very important for it to be a harmonius and happy place for you to learn in. Try to be a blessing every day in every way to those around you and don't forget to help Mum with the chores as she won't have as much time as she used to, to do all of that stuff<br>  <br>  . While you're doing it think how blessed you are to have a Mum whom you can love and be loved by. All those poor orphans in the world and lonely, abused children!<br>   NOW you can think about the technical side of it. For a start DON'T WORRY about accreditation! Thats the least of your worries. At the end of high school a lot of homeschoolers do the SAT test which gives them  entrance into college ect.( we call it University or TAFE) A lot of homeschoolers apply by interview and present a folio of their work achieved. <br>  Homeschoolers everywhere all over the States are consistently getting higher grades on annual  tests they give for primary, high school and university. That's because the curriculums they're using are of a higher standard than the schools. <br>  They teach maths properly for a start! Then there's English which is infinitely superior to the schools which are using rubbishy novels and polictical propaganda to teach english. Some programs give certificates which are accepted along with interviews. I've had 6 kids go into higher education and never had to worry about it. There are a myriad of ways to approach it. Homeschoolers THINK  OUTSIDE THE BOX! <br>  Thats why 70 percent of graduates are "entrepreneurial"! Now a seasoned homeschooler looks that word up in a dictionary. He or she knows how because  they know how to spell and use syllables. They glance at that word and can see a latin derived prefix of some sort.( "Whats a prefix "asks a schoolie??!!) They invariably also have had the freedom to exercise and develop that skill in a way that benefits them and the community in which they live. <br>  Just pick a curriculum you feel happy with and start! As you go you'll get the feel of it all. You'll meet other homeschoolers and it will all start to fall into place. You'll see what other people are using and what results they are getting.

You can probably continue with the online school you're already enrolled with so that your record-keeping has all the I-dotting and T-crossing done.  You can also compare your schedule with that of the TEA and the TEKS information and 'fill in the blanks' where there is no overlap between what you're learning now, and what the Texas schedule expects you to have learned.  That way, when you go back next year, you won't be behind.|`|Q7lvSU03aa	Are you going to back to high school next year?

Was it something specific that you did at one time? For instance, did you talk back? Get in an argument with her? Something we do things to other people that we don't even realize would have hurt them or offended them. This is why first impressions can be so drastic--we don't know them yet!<br>  <br>  If this isn't the case, another possibility is that you're the class clown. Everyone has one in their class, and they can get annoying when it's time to get down to work. Teachers are the ones that have to deal with these kids every day in every class period.<br>  <br>  These two ideas came to my mind first, but if they don't sound like you, there are plenty of other things it could be:<br>  <br>  She doesn't think you reaching your "full potential." ---> AKA, you're slacking off.<br>  <br>  You get off task too easily. ---> AKA, you're distracting others while you're getting off task.<br>  <br>  You continuously sending in work late. ---> AKA, you're wasting her time.<br>  <br>  It could be any of these things---or even a combination of many of them.

The cost of in-state college tuition has grown 35 percent over the past five years. Health care costs have risen four times faster than wages over the past six years. And the personal savings rate is now the lowest it's been since the Great Depression.<br>  Tax Cuts for Wealthy Instead of Middle Class: The Bush tax cuts give those who earn over $1 million dollars a tax cut nearly 160 times greater than that received by middle-income Americans. At the same time, this administration has refused to tackle health care, education and housing in a manner that benefits the middle class.<br>  Barack Obama and Joe Biden's Plan<br>  <br>  Jumpstart the Economy<br>  Enact a Windfall Profits Tax to Provide a $1,000 Emergency Energy Rebate to American Families:Barack Obama and Joe Biden will enact a windfall profits tax on excessive oil company profits to give American families an immediate $1,000 emergency energy rebate to help families pay rising bills. This relief would be a down payment on the Obama-Biden long-term plan to provide middle-class families with at least $1,000 per year in permanent tax relief.<br>  Provide $50 billion to Jumpstart the Economy and Prevent 1 Million Americans from Losing Their Jobs: This relief would include a $25 billion State Growth Fund to prevent state and local cuts in health, education, housing, and heating assistance or counterproductive increases in property taxes, tolls or fees. The Obama-Biden relief plan will also include $25 billion in a Jobs and Growth Fund to prevent cutbacks in road and bridge maintenance and fund school re pair - all to save more than 1 million jobs in danger of being cut.<br>  Provide Middle Class Americans Tax Relief<br>  Obama and Biden will cut income taxes by $1,000 for working families to offset the payroll tax they pay.<br>  Provide a Tax Cut for Working Families: Obama and Biden will restore fairness to the tax code and provide 150 million workers the tax relief they need. Obama and Biden will create a new "Making Work Pay" tax credit of up to $500 per person, or $1,000 per working family. The "Making Work Pay" tax credit will completely eliminate income taxes for 10 million Americans.<br>  Eliminate Income Taxes for Seniors Making Less than $50,000: Barack Obama will eliminate all income taxation of seniors making less than $50,000 per year. This proposal will eliminate income taxes for 7 million seniors and provide these seniors with an average savings of $1,400 each year. Under the Obama-Biden plan, 27 million American seniors will also not need to file an income tax return.<br>  Simplify Tax Filings for Middle Class Americans: Obama and Biden will dramatically simplify tax filings so that millions of Americans will be able to do their taxes in less than five minutes. Obama and Biden will ensure that the IRS uses the information it already gets from banks and employers to give taxpayers the option of pre-filled tax forms to verify, sign and return. Experts estimate that the Obama-Biden proposal will save Americans up to 200 million total hours of work and aggravation and up to $2 billion in tax preparer fees.<br>  Trade<br>  Obama and Biden believe that trade with foreign nations should strengthen the American economy and create more American jobs. He will stand firm against agreements that undermine our economic security.<br>  Fight for Fair Trade: Obama and Biden will fight for a trade policy that opens up foreign markets to support good American jobs. They will use trade agreements to spread good labor and environmental standards around the world and stand firm against agreements like the Central American Free Trade Agreement that fail to live up to those important benchmarks. Obama and Biden will also pressure the World Trade Organization to enforce trade agreements and stop countries from continuing unfair government subsidies to foreign exporters and nontariff barriers on U.S. exports.<br>  Amend the North American Free Trade Agreement: Obama and Biden believe that NAFTA and its potential were oversold to the American people. They will work with the leaders of Canada and Mexico to fix NAFTA so that it works for American workers.<br>  Improve Transition Assistance: To help all workers adapt to a rapidly changing economy, Obama and Biden will update the existing system of Trade Adjustment Assistance by extending it to service industries, creating flexible education accounts to help workers retrain, and providing retraining assistance for workers in sectors of the economy vulnerable to dislocation before they lose their jobs.<br>  End Tax Breaks for Companies that Send Jobs Overseas: Barack Obama and Joe Biden believe that companies should not get billions of dollars in tax deductions for moving their operations overseas. Obama and Biden will also fight to ensure that public contracts are awarded to companies that are committed to American workers.<br>  Reward C

AA10176626	Addy and Jade's Mommy:<br>  <br>  Since you're asking specifically about Canadian students (your reference to OSAP gave it away), I can offer some data specific to your country.<br>  <br>  In 2006, the Canada Millennium Scholarship Foundation determined that 53% of all Canadian undergraduates graduated with debt that year. The average debt for these students was $24,047.<br>  <br>  Average debts were highest in Atlantic Canada and British Columbia, and lowest in Quebec, where the average student debt was only $12,992. The study mentioned that programs were generally shorter and bursaries more available in Quebec than in other parts of the country.<br>  <br>  Though the average amount of debt had somewhat stabilized, the report's authors expressed concern that the percentage of students graduating with debt was on the rise. They worried that debt burdens could negatively impact the students' transition to the workforce, and affect life "decisions", including homebuying and continued education.<br>  <br>  You are right to be concerned about your debt levels. A $40,000 debt will be well above average, and require a monthly payment of approximately $524. That's almost $6300 a year. <br>  <br>  Be sure to investigate all of the special programs that OSAP has for debt control and repayment. There is the Ontario Student Opportunity Grant, Interest Relief, Revision of Repayment Terms (which stretches your repayment over a longer period of time), and even Debt Reduction for borrowers who are still struggling with repayment after 5 years.<br>  <br>  All of the information on these programs - and a helpful debt calculator can be found here: <a href="http://accesswindow.osap.gov.on.ca/CGI-BIN/LANSAWEB?WEBEVENT+L10984043442842004FC7081+OSP+ENG#calc" rel="nofollow">http://accesswindow.osap.gov.on.ca/CGI-B...</a> at the Ministry of Training, Colleges and Universities site.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps you - good luck!|`|yGOmMQP7aa	I remember reading somewhere that the average debt is about 22,000 after graduation with a bachelors degree.

3pC1KrF6aa	VITAMINS: All natural vitamins are organic food substances found only in living things, that is, plants and animals. With few exceptions the body cannot manufacture or synthesize vitamins. They must be supplied in the diet or in dietary supplements. Vitamins are essential to the normal functioning of our bodies. They are necessary for our growth, vitality, and general well-being.<br>  <br>  HOW THEY WORK: A lot of people think vitamins can replace food. They cannot. In fact, vitamins cannot be assimilated without ingesting food. That is why we suggest taking them with a meal. Vitamins help regulate metabolism, help convert fat and carbohydrates into energy, and assist in forming bone and tissue. <br>  <br>  VITAMIN A (Beta Carotene) <br>  IMPORTANCE: Necessary for growth & repair of body tissues; helps maintain smooth, soft disease-free skin; helps protect the mucous membranes of the mouth, nose , throat & lungs, thereby reducing susceptibility to infections; protects against air pollutants; counteracts night-blindness & weak eyesight; aids in bone and teeth formation. Current medical research shows that foods rich in Beta Carotene will help reduce the risk of lung cancer & certain oral cancers. Unlike Vitamin A from fish liver oil, Beta Carotene is non-toxic.<br>  DEFICIENCY SYMPTOMS: May result in night blindness; increased susceptibility to infections; rough, dry, scaly skin; loss of smell & appetite; frequents fatigue; lack of tearing; defective teeth & gums' retarded growth.<br>  <br>  cracks and sores in the mouth & lips; bloodshot eyes; purplish tongue; dermatitis; retarded growth; digestive disturbances; trembling; sluggishness; oily skin.<br>  <br>  Vitamin C ?<br>  Essential for healthy teeth, gums & Bones; helps heal wounds, scar tissue, & Fractures; prevents scurvy; builds resistance to infection; aids in the prevention & treatment of the common cold.<br>  <br>  Vitamin E ?<br>  Major anti-oxidant nutrient; retards cellular aging due to oxidation; supplies oxygen to the blood which is then carried to the heart and other organs.<br>  <br>  Vitamin A (Beta Carotene) ?<br>  Necessary for growth & repair of body tissues; helps maintain smooth, soft disease-free skin; helps protect the mucous membranes of the mouth, nose , throat & lungs, thereby reducing susceptibility to infections.<br>  <br>  <br>  Selenium ?<br>  Protection of cells from oxidative damage, affects immune response.<br>  <br>  Zinc ?<br>  Synthesis of proteins, RNA and DNA; wound healing; immune response; ability to taste.<br>  60 mg / 250 Tabl. <br>  <br>  VITAMIN B-6 (Pyridoxine)<br>  IMPORTANCE: Necessary for the synthesis & breakdown of amino acids, the building blocks of protein; aids in fat and carbohydrate metabolism; aids in the formation of antibodies; maintains the central nervous system; aids in the removal of excess fluid of premenstrual women; promotes healthy skin; reduces muscle spasms, leg cramps, hand numbness, nausea & stiffness of hands; helps maintain a proper balance of sodium & phosphorous in the body.<br>  DEFICIENCY SYMPTOMS: May result in nervousness, insomnia, skin eruptions, loss of muscular control, anemia, mouth disorders, muscular weakness, dermatitis, arm & leg cramps, loss of hair, slow learning, and water retention.<br>  <br>  <br>  VITAMIN B-12 (Cobalamin)<br>  IMPORTANCE: Helps in the formation & regeneration of red blood cells, thus helping prevent anemia; necessary for carbohydrate, fat & protein metabolism; maintains a healthy nervous system; promotes growth in children; increases energy; needed for Calcium absorption.<br>  DEFICIENCY SYMPTOMS: May lead to pernicious anemia, poor appetite, growth failure in children, tiredness, brain damage, nervousness, neuritis, degeneration of spinal cord, depression, lack of balance.<br>  <br>  <br>  NIACINAMIDE (Niacin- vitamin B-3)<br>  IMPORTANCE: Improves circulation and reduces the cholesterol level in the blood; maintains the nervous system; helps metabolize protein, sugar & fat; reduces high blood pressure; increases energy through proper utilization of food; prevents pellagra; helps maintain a healthy skin, tongue & digestive system.<br>  DEFICIENCY SYMPTOMS: May result in pellagra, gastrointestinal disturbance, nervousness, headaches, fatigue, mental depression, vague aches & pains, irritability, loss of appetite, insomnia, skin disorders, muscular weakness, indigestion, bad breath, canker sores.

AA11403712	Depends on your state requirements. Most states you need a bachelor degree and a teaching cert. If you already have the bachelor degree in art I would recommend you go through elem. ed. in a masters program. It will cost about the same but you are more marketable in todays teaching program with a masters degree. I had my bachelor in IT and got my elem. ed.  masters with cert in 18 months, was hired in 2 weeks after graduation.|`|9MrCI1VZaa	It's true that you could do a master's or bachelor's in elem. ed... and that a master's would be wiser because you'd be more hirable, you'd be paid more, and your re-certification every so many years (depending on the state) would be MUCH easier with a master's.  However, you can take "licensure classes" which essentially fill the gaps you have in ed. requirements.  This means you use the degree you already have and add only the classes you need.  Most colleges/universities offer these.  It is a much quicker, easier, and affordable way to make that big switch.  To ensure that you know which classes you need, contact the HR department in the district you are interested in working.  Ask to speak to someone regarding licensure and tell them your story.  You'll want to know which classes you still need.  Depending on the size of the district, they may be able to answer you there or they may refer you to the appropriate department at the state dept. of ed (since they set the regulations).  Then you'll want to contact nearby colleges to see which courses they offer.  Many of these courses can be used towards a master's degree, as well, in the event you do decide to get a master's at some point.|`|294db1e52bf0162d7d7ff79b4102975faa	A lot of the art classes would probably carry over.

RTa3g9ZHaa	My English teacher is the kindest, most polite, amazing person I have ever met.|`|Lv2LkbLxaa	CRAZY but FUN...|`|6q5q4nvVaa	It's a great subject to teach:  very flexible, good material, and you can turn almost anything into an English lesson.  Literature also becomes a great jumping off point for discussions with students, and sometimes this gives you great insight into your students in a way that other subjects don't provide.  You also are not tied to a sequential curriculum like Social Studies or math.<br>  <br>  The down-side is you have a lot -- A LOT -- of grading.  When you grade a paper, you have to read it carefully, sometimes decipher it if the writing is bad, and provide corrective feedback.  This takes a lot of time, sometimes 10-20 minutes per paper depending on the length, multiplied by X number of students.  There's rarely a time during the school year that an English teacher does not have a pile of papers sitting on a desk somewhere, waiting to be graded.<br>  <br>  Principals don't bug teachers based on what subject they teach, but on how they are as teachers.

In the US, you end up having to take a huge number of electives that in no way pertain to your major.

Many of these universities accept international students doing the study by distance education (combination of online and mail), their accreditation is just as valid, and (if the exchange rate is in your favor) the study can be significantly cheaper.<br>  <br>  I recommend looking at Australian universities in particular because of the good US$/AU$ exchange rate.

wseP86qSaa	Please check with either your college admissions, registrar, or testing services offices to inquire about what your school offers along the lines of either placement tests or recieving equivilancy credit for showing that you have prior knowledge on the subject (Japanese language). <br>  <br>  Each school has its own policies, so you really can't get upset at them if their policies that are already in place don't allow you to receive credit. You could work to change that though. Many schools allow you to receive up to 6 equivalancy credits or so from real life learning. <br>  <br>  SO, they might be telling you that you can't "TRANSFER" your credits in from your outside school, but you can go about it the way I described above.<br>  <br>  EDIT: I want to add that the fact that you already have a level 4 JLPT cert. is impressive. If the above options fail for getting credit for your prior knowledge, then you can take the route of testing into the appropriate level Japanese class for you. The JLPT certificate on its own will look really good on your resume anyway. So all is not lost. Your efforts will pay off one way or another. <br>  <br>  I hope that helps!

NPtz1Y4Taa	The Female Hormonal Cycle and<br>  Mathematical Difference Equations <br>    <br>  by Kristen Johnson <br>    <br>   <br>  ABSTRACT   <br>  The female reproductive cycle is an example of a real biological oscillating system where the periodic nature of the system may be described by a set of difference equations. The model is developed using blood-level of three different ovarian and gonadotropic hormones, estrogen, progesterone, and luteinizing hormone. We construct this model using actual sample data describing the levels of these hormones present in the body throughout the month, then discuss the applications of such research.   <br>    <br>  <br>  BACKGROUND   <br>  <br>  The female reproductive cycle is an intricate series of chemical secretions and reactions, and delicate changes in physical anatomy, which produce the ultimate potential for fertility and birth. These chemicals, known as hormones, are human proteins with the capacity to affect and regulate human growth and function. The female reproductive cycle is a general term which encompasses the ovarian cycle, the uterine cycle, the hormonal changes that regulate them, and cyclical changes in the breasts and the cervix. The ovarian cycle is the term used to describe the series of events associated with a developing oocyte, or, egg cell, within the ovaries, while the uterine cycle is the preparation of the environment of the uterus for the reception of a fertilized ovum. The regulation of both the ovarian and uterine cycles is the function of several gonadotropic and ovarian hormones. Among the most important of the gonadotropins are luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), while the most crucial ovarian hormones are the androgens, estrogen and progesterone. The hypothalamus-derived hormone in control of the gonadotropins, and indirectly, all female sexual function, is gonadotropin releasing hormone (GNRH). The release of GNRH in an adolescent female marks the commencement of that female's reproductive capability, and ultimately, the onset of menstruation (Tartora 938-40).   <br>  <br>  Among the most important aspects of the female cycle is the periodic nature in which it occurs. From the time a young woman begins to menstruate, until the time that woman reaches menopause, hormonal pulses and secretions occur extremely regularly, varying little from month to month. This periodicity is the characteristic on which this research capitalizes, since it is the periodicity which we may describe using several mathematical difference equations. These equations are functions of three of the key hormones, luteinizing hormone, estrogen, and progesterone. These hormones were chosen over the rest of the involved hormones for their paramount roles in the regularity of the cycle.   <br>  <br>  It is necessary to understand the biological proceedings which these equations describe. The duration of the female reproductive cycle is typically 24-35 days. This research will assume the average 28-day cycle, in the absence of fertilization and pregnancy, divided into three phases; the menstrual phase, the preovulatory phase and the postovulatory phase. It is the preovulatory phase that is the most variable phase lasting anywhere from 6-13 days and accounts for most of the time difference when cycles are either shorter or longer than the 28-day average, while the postovulatory phase is almost always 14 days in length (Tartora 938). These proceedings begin within the ovaries of a developing female. The ovaries contain oocytes in various stages of development. In the preliminary stages of development an oocyte contains only a single layer of surrounding cells. These cells are referred to as follicle cells. As the egg matures further, and multiple layers of surrounding cells form, the cells are then referred to as granulosa cells. The surrounding cells are responsible for nourishing the developing oocyte, and, as the follicle grows larger, for the production and secretion of estrogen. Estrogen, then, is produced at regular levels throughout childhood.   <br>  <br>  It is during a girl's childhood that GNRH is inhibited from being secreted by the negative feedback effect that estrogen has on the midbrain gland responsible for the output of GNRH, the hypothalamus. As a girl matures toward puberty, the hypothalamus undergoes significant changes in its childhood sensitivity to the ovarian hormone and is stimulated toward the release of GNRH, in a rhythmic, pulse-like manner. As the pulses become stronger and stronger, the release of GNRH into the brain positively effects the anterior pituitary gland to commence the production and secretion of the human gonadotropins, LH and FSH. Continued production of FSH and LH stimulates growth and maturation of the follicles inside the ovaries, and the first preovulatory phase of the female menstrual cycle begins (Marieb 979-81).   <br>  <br>  Since the follicular cells are responsible for the output of estrogen, LH and FSH, in turn, promote estrogen secretion in preparation for ovulation. At t|`|h8kxdNFmaa	That was...um...thorough. And scientific. And obviously written by a man. <br>  <br>  And not entirely accurate. (The myth in there is the 6 to 13 day preovulatory timeframe. Some of us go for 19 days. A great many go beyond 13 days, actually.) <br>  <br>  If you'd like a detailed source that actually makes sense in terms of attaining or avoiding pregnancy, I can't recommend "Taking Control of Your Fertility" enough. <br>  <br>  We tried for a year to have a baby with no luck. When the obgyn decided I needed a good dose of his hormone pills, I decided I needed to read that book instead. You'd think a 30-something college-educated woman would know how to make a baby, right? Well, two tries with the info in the book, and BOOM! <br>  <br>  The obgyn said "It's all about hormones. Just put the right hormones in and it all works." <br>  <br>  He's an idiot. It's all about timing. Every woman's body is different, and if you can figure out how to read your own body's signals, it all works.<br>  <br>  I guess his way is better for his car payments, though.
77d7d84d5a4a1152b83fd0114e664134aa	You can do a premed curriculum with a poly sci major.   Premed is not an actual major, it is a group of pre-requisite courses that are required by medical schools such as biology, chemistry, physics, ....  Only thing is that you may be taking a few extra science courses that you wouldnt otherwise need had you not decided to go to medical school.  this is a good tactic because the med schools love diversity.  Biology majors are a dime a dozen in  the premed world.  You would set yourself apart from the masses with a non-science major.  And if you dont get into med school, you can skip on over to law school

I do have some friends in some of my classes however, who think the same as I do. They are smart, mature and care bout what they do, just like me. I would tell you to keep your head high, don;t be deterred by what these 'mates' of yours are doing, stay on track, keep the friends you like and think to yourself that you are better than the silly ones, because you are.

Don't pay attention to anyone who puts you down, and just keep going1 Good luck! :)
7fmsH1JPaa	If this is a physics question, the answer is- <br>  <br>  A fence requires you to sit on a very minute area, thereby decreasing area. Since Pressure= Force/Area, then a decrease in area will lead to increased pressure. <br>  <br>  A bed on the other hand, allows you to occupy a larger area, increasing area. Similarly, P=F/A, therefore pressure on your body will be decreased. So, you can sit more comfortably.<br>  <br>  Note: Here, the force is actually that applied by the object on your body|`|CtwEFHcqaa	A bed is soft a fence is not.

RTa3g9ZHaa	The above answerer is incorrect, You can use 'used to' in the present tense, but in a different context to when you would use it in the past tense.<br>  <br>  You could say: "I am very used to having my breakfast at 7 o'clock in the morning".<br>  <br>  This means that this person is familiar with having their breakfast at 7 o'clock in the morning. In present tense, 'used to' can be used for familiarities.<br>  <br>  You could also say: "Stainless steel is used to make cutlery".<br>  <br>  This means that stainless steel is the material that cutlery is made from. The metal has been 'used to' make something.|`|yJSPecgoaa	"Used to" can also mean "accustomed to" and can be used in the present tense.<br>  <br>  Here are examples in present tense:<br>  <br>  I am used to driving long distances, so I don't mind driving the 1000 miles to your house.<br>  <br>  I am used to walking several miles to school each day, so that 20-mile hike wasn't such a big deal to me.|`|T33Za7jiaa	Past tense.<br>  I used to date this beautiful blond girl, but she was a bit dull.<br>  I used love going on Myspace.<br>  I used to go to loads of gigs.<br>  <br>  There is no way you can use "Used to" in the present tense.<br>  It's a past  tense expression.

AA10176626	Drake:<br>  <br>  Just to make absolutely certain that you are clear on the topic:<br>  <br>  A Stafford loan is a part of your annual financial aid award. It's not like an open-ended line of credit, where you can go back and take a little more when you need it - it's a fixed amount that you are eligible to borrow during an academic year.<br>  <br>  There are two restrictions that determine how much you can borrow:<br>  <br>  One is that there is an annual maximum to the Stafford, which applies no matter what your financial aid situation is.<br>  <br>   If you are a dependent student (you're not 24 yet, you're not married, you're not a military vet, etc.), you can borrow a MAXIMUM of $5500 for the entire year as a freshman. You can borrow $6500 as a sophomore and you can borrow as much as $7500 in your third and fourth years of school.<br>  <br>  If you are an independent student, your maximums increase. An independent freshman can borrow as much as $9500, an independent sophomore $10,500, and independent juniors and seniors can take a maximum Stafford of $12,500 each year.<br>  <br>  While we're on the subject, there's also a lifetime maximum. A dependent undergraduate student can only borrow a total of $31,000 from the Stafford lending program, a number that increases to $57,500 for independent undergrads.<br>  <br>  The MAXIMUM annual limits may not be the amount that you are actually eligible to borrow. Your personal limits are determined by your financial aid need. In order to insure that financial aid is used to pay for educational expenses, only, the government limits your personal financial aid eligibility to the amount that your school determines is reasonable for you to pay your educational expenses. For most students, this includes tuition, school fees, room and board, and other miscellaneous educational expenses, like gas money to get to school, and an allowance for a laptop computer.<br>  <br>  When you received your aid offer letter, you were offered a Stafford loan of "so-many dollars". If you have already borrowed that amount for this year, you can not access any more Stafford funds until the next academic year begins. You will receive (or have already received) a 2009-2010 aid offer letter, and that letter will identify your Stafford access for the next school year.<br>  <br>  Good luck to you - I hope this information helped you understand the limitations of the Stafford program.|`|yGOmMQP7aa	Your loans are approved an academic year at a time and given to the school a semester at a time.  If you are going to need a loan for NEXT fall, spring or summer... those folks are applying now at <a href="http://fafsa.ed.gov" rel="nofollow">http://fafsa.ed.gov</a>  You will need your 2008 tax return info and possibly your parents tax info depending on your age.|`|SIhxrxD3aa	You apply for the federal grants and/or loans every spring through the FAFSA.

5Fwuya29aa	yeah, that's ok, but you can argue that you could achieve something great in any subject. also, working in a field and studying it are very different.<br>  <br>  a really good thing to do is also to spend a few sentences talking about an aspect or idea in your chosen area that really interests you.  I applied to do law and I discussed hitler's legal revolution, for example.<br>  <br>  and a couple of books or academic's ideas that you have read in your spare time would be good. to show you've explored the subject and you still are very keen<br>  <br>  basically, the key is to make it seem like you want to study it simply because you are interested in the subject so much and find it nteresting.  you are willing to learn etc.<br>  <br>  only a little paragraph at the end listing your extra cirric.  trust me, they are not THAT interested in them.  only put down the really good stuff too, not every single club/society you're in.
gb9REJN4aa	I think you're right that you don't need a high school or college degree to be successful. However, it does help, on average. Also, I have to point out, Larry Page and Sergey Brin were GRADUATE SCHOOL dropouts. Both already had college degrees when they dropped out. In fact, all of your college dropouts above share another feature: they dropped out of college to do something specific that made them money. If you were in college right now and somebody offered you a billion-dollar opportunity, you'd probably be smart to drop out and take it, too. That's pretty much what these guys did. Zuckerberg started Facebook while he was at college, and when it became really popular and money-making for him, THEN he dropped out. Same for Bill Gates with Microsoft and for the Google guys. So I would say: no, you don't have to go to college or even graduate from high school to be successful--but it does help a lot. If you get a golden opportunity, though, you should take it--whether you're in high school, college, or elsewhere, and even if it means you don't finish your education.|`|24ff965b698b01fab680ef159e41f361aa	its only a handful..<br>  <br>  not the majority..<br>  <br>  it might not work out for every drop out.. sometimes luck plays a dominant character..<br>  <br>  its better to finish college cos a degree will help even wen the economy is down and business has gone bust..

v7f2bjpfaa	1. I am a Transitional Client Advocate at a homeless shelter for women and children in Rensselaer NY.  The women and their children come to the shelter through a referral from the Rensselaer County Department of Social Services.  On average the women stay for 42 days before finding their own apartment (some stay only one night and our longest stay was 7 months.)  While in shelter, the women work with the client advocate t find housing.  Once the women have found housing, I work with them for a year to help ensure their success in their new home and help prevent them from becoming homeless again.  This includes finding daycare for their children, assistance in going back to school or finding employment, legal and medical advocacy, etc. <br>  <br>  2. The job actually chose me I guess.  I was a Masters of Social Work student intern at the shelter when the position opened, and the Executive Director thought I would be a good match.  I was not planning on working with the homeless population, but as a MSW student you can not chose your internship.  <br>  <br>  3.  I was influences greatly to be a Social Worker, not as much influenced to work with the homeless.  Growing up my parents were foster parents to 5 teen boys.  Seeing the hardships they went through from moving to many different families over the years really motivated me to want to change that.  The best way to change something is from the inside out, so I chose social work to work not only with people in need but to be able to work on the legislative pieces that I feel need to change. <br>  <br>  4.  If I was not currently working in my job, I would love to work with families with children with autism.  Autism has always been an interest for me, and how it can affect the parents and siblings of those children.<br>  <br>  5.  My main hard ship was finishing my Masters while working.  When I was offered the job I was going to school full time (3 classes and 16 hour internship) and had just found out I was unexpectedly pregnant, due right after graduation.  To add 40 hours of work seemed like it would be more than I could handle, however I knew with a baby on the way not many people would be looking to hire me.  My boss and I arranged a 53 hour a week schedule to accommodate my internship and work hours (some of which was on the weekends.)  I had Sundays off to do school work, and keeping that busy actually made the pregnancy go by fast.<br>  <br>  6.  THe job is what I expected, since I had already been an intern for about 6 months when I was hired, however it is very frustrating (especially in todays economy.)  The main goal of my job is to help women off the welfare system.  The best way to do that is to increase their education so they can obtain high wages.  A woman can receive assistance for daycare if working, not if they are attending school.  So basically the system sets women up to be stuck in their same low paying jobs.  Other than that the staff at the shelter are excellent, and my boss is very open to hearing suggestions as what is and is not working at the shelter.<br>  <br>  7.  Prior to this I was a Child and Adolescent Counselor for the Rensselaer County Sexual Assault and Crime Victims Assistance program.  I would counsel those under 18 who were victims of a sexual assault or a violent crime.  It sounds like a depressing job, but to watch the youth regain confidence in themselves made the job worth it.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps (sorry its so long)<br>  Name: Erica Gosh
4Q0UlfETaa	My name is Darren Ward and I currently work as a clerk in a small town hotel.<br>  <br>  1) I greet guests as they come through our hotel and take care of their individual needs. It may be getting ice for them, warming towels, or even mailing packages. <br>  2) I didn't have much choice in the matter actually. My wife works at the same motel and got me a job, as I needed one.<br>  3) I have always been a "people person".<br>  4) I've always been into games and computers, if I had the choice and so on, I would want to make video games.<br>  5) Well I am a Canadian citizen and a legal resident of the USA. Before I could obtain a job in the states, I had to go through the immigration process and wait for my social security number before I could even look for a job.<br>  6)My opinions on the job change from time to time. I like the job, though it isn't as challenging as I would like it to be all the time. I get to meet people from all over the world and have actually made some friendships along the way with customers. There are some people that come in and out that I would rather do without, you know, the mean, I'm rich and you're not ones, but overall it is a good job. <br>  7) Well while I was in Canada, my first job was a paper route that I did for 10 years. I worked fast food and in the grocery business. <br>  <br>  Alright, with my answers I'm not sure I am interesting enough for your essay or what you are looking for, but you have it anyways. Good luck to you and if you have anything else you need to ask, let me know.

Your personal statement should be about three or four lines long. Then you should put your qualifications (so GCSE's) especially maths and English. Most places are a bit snobby and want you to have a C or above in both. Just start with something like "A hard working, mature student with excellent communication skills and plenty of enthusiasm". After your qualifications, put a header of when you started and finished your last job, explain in bullet points underneath what exactly you did and what your learnt. Then tell them about the job before that and so on. (They like to see most recent work) Good luck!<br>  <br>  Also, make sure your spelling and grammer are perfect!

AA10176626	Mr. Jelly:<br>  <br>  Here's a suggestion:<br>  <br>  Most schools have on-campus ATM machines, scattered around in places like the bookstore, the student union and the food service areas. It's a great convenience to have these ATMs available to you when you need to pick up a few bucks for a pizza delivery, or a quick run into town.<br>  <br>  As you probably know, most ATMs are free for members of the sponsor's bank, but charge a fee for all other users. The best on-campus ATMs are the ones that you can use without having to pay stupid user fees - they add up quickly, and after a while, you stop using the machine, because the "convenience" isn't worth $10 or $20 a month.<br>  <br>  When you're visiting the schools that you are considering, take a peek at the ATMs and see which bank they 'belong' to. You might want to wait until you have picked a school, so that you can think about setting up a checking account at the bank that offers you on-campus ATM access.<br>  <br>  I hope that idea helped! Good luck.|`|DorePwVOaa	HSBC is generally referred to as the "college bank" and tends to have ATMs on or near many college campuses. If you grab the street addresses of the schools you're looking at, you can do a Bank Branch or ATM look-up on just about any bank website.<br>  <br>  A quick search reveals the following ATMs on or near the schools you're looking at:<br>  <br>  UB: Evans Bank, HSBC, and Citibank<br>  Stonybrook: Bank of America and Teachers Federal Credit Union<br>  Albany: HSBC, SEFCU, Key Bank, and Bank of America<br>  <br>  So as you can see, there probably isn't one bank you can sign up for now, and be sure that you'll have ATM access at any of the three schools. You will probably want to wait until you pick a school, and then sign up for a checking account. Don't worry - during most freshman orientations, the banks have tables set up to sign up for an account right there. Just make sure you are getting a no-fee student checking account! Because who wants to pay fees?
VZ21gL81aa	it will take time for anything to change. Of course, for most students, the rise in Pell means little. What it will do is prompt colleges to raise tuition accordingly, so that if Pell goes up by $1k, the expected personal contribution will also rise.

dPLKVCDdaa	The International Baccalaureate (IB) Diploma Programme (DP) is an educational programme examined in one of three languages (English, French or Spanish) and is a leading university entrance course. It is taught in 2,075 schools, often in international schools, in 125 countries all around the world (as of 2007). More than half of the schools offering the Diploma Programme are state funded schools. The programme, administered by the International Baccalaureate Organization, is a recognized pre-university educational programme[1]. Students take six subjects, and must also complete 3 extra requirements: the Theory of Knowledge course (ToK), a 4000-word Extended Essay (EE), and at least 150 hours in CAS (Creativity, Action, Service) areas.[2]<br>  <br>  Marks are awarded from 1 to 7 in each subject with 7 being the highest, and up to three additional points may be awarded depending on the results of the EE and ToK essays. The maximum possible point total in the Diploma Programme is 45. In order to receive an International Baccalaureate Diploma, candidates must receive a minimum of 24 points. There are a number of failing conditions which will prevent a student from being awarded a Diploma regardless of the points they received (such as non-completion of CAS, plagiarism, no EE etc). The IBO also requires that the candidate do fairly well on each individual exam, although these requirements are slightly more lenient if the student has at least 28 total points.[3]<br>  <br>  Candidates who successfully pass examinations in two language A1, or one language A1 and one language A2 courses and meet all the other criteria for successful completion of the Diploma Programme are eligible to receive a Bilingual Diploma. [4]<br>  <br>  Students who complete individual IB courses and their final exams, but opt out of the full programme (or fail to complete it) do not receive the IB Diploma, but instead receive IB Certificates for each subject. IB Certificates are proof of having taken the exam and of the student's score on it.

PW2enzldaa	Hi there, I'm 18 so I'm past my GCSEs, but my high school days are still VERY clear, and I was faced with a situation quite similar; I withdrew myself a lot especially towards exams, and I was always very shy in general. A lot of the teachers were fine to get along with, but I don't believe I ever shared jokes or talked to them while the rest of the class were able to. It used to make me feel very awkward, and certainly didn't encourage me to take as much of an interest in the subject or study as hard in the lessons, despite my grades being fine.<br>  <br>  I found it helped to ask any queries I had with the work after lessons, or even mention to them something I was studying in relation to the subject outside of school. This tells the teacher two things: 1) You're passionate about the subject you're studying, or at least seem to be taking a genuine interest and 2) You're open to accepting their help, or listening to their opinions. <br>  It's their job to help you, so if she begrudgingly replies, take it as something she's obviously holding against you, and think nothing of it, because you don't appear to have done anything wrong, and therefore, you shouldn't worry. I had a few teachers who always seemed to hold some sort of grudge against me, and I could never figure out why, because others were great!<br>  <br>  Anyway, hopefully something like this should help break the ice, as she's probably just as unsure how to act around you, and I imagine it will come as a great relief to her, as perhaps she understands you're shy and just doesn't know quite how to approach you either. Even when I was on good conversational terms with my teachers, they rarely joked with me in class, because they knew I was shy.<br>  <br>  This might not be any help at all, but hopefully you can take something from it. Feel free to ask anything else; I hope things improve! :)|`|7fmsH1JPaa	Start with a greeting, like good morning, good evening, hello. Then try and come up with a doubt and approach her with it. Share some personal experience. I know such teachers, they open up to you mostly when you show them your interest in studies. Sometimes, teachers too make mistakes, show her that you're interested in her teaching and answer questions if she asks them. Don't be scared, teachers don't hate anyone, but sometimes they judge the book by its cover. Show them that you can be a great student.|`|AA12349214	Just break it!  Take what she says with a pinch of salt - what you see as sarcasm may well be what she sees as humour.  It may be a coping mechanism on her part.  So just be more open more easy in your manner towards her and dont take exception to what she says .  I know you dont want to hear this but teenagers are notoriously over sensitive so dont take everything so personally - you probably arent being singled out as the one she doesnt communicate with.  She may also be respecting what would appear to be your wish to be incommunicative - so just break the ice by speaking or being a little bit more open.  A smile usually goes a long long way.<br>  If you do have to have her for another year its probably best to find a way to make it easier for both of you.  Good luck!|`|CtwEFHcqaa	I suggest doing what Calimbine says. Give her a card telling her how much you appreciate what she taught you.|`|IEbAHp0gaa	As a lecturer myself I don't know why she is behaving like that, not very professional.<br>  <br>  Just go up to her one day after class when all the other pupils have gone and tell her that you are a little confused with the topic and need more understanding (even if you don't just pretend).<br>  <br>  She will talk to you and explain stuff then you will slowly break the ice with her, good luck.|`|zCHnMeXbaa	Surprise her.  Give her a card or a personal hand written note saying how much you appreciate what she has taught to you.  If you do not want to personally give it to her, just have the school secretary put it in her teachers' mailbox.|`|m2kzy0P5aa	Ask her to check some work for you, and try to chat to her while she's checking? Ask her how her day was, etc?|`|eybHcHz9aa	If you are shy about breaking the ice, but still worried about grades, then you should do the ice breaking by asking for some help with work. <br>  There's no point in giving her cards and stuff until you've finished your exams, it's a bit creepy at the best of times, especially if you've barely spoken before! <br>  Find a good juicy question you need to know about the work, approach her while she's still at her desk at the end of class. Tell her there's something you are stuck on, but thought it would've got in the way of class time if you'd asked before.  Ask if she's got a few spare minutes today or this week. Have your diary ready to set a time and date for a quick chat so she may feel obliged to write it down too and not ignore it!<br>  When you see her again, a smile goes a long way, and even if her advice only helps a little, a big relieved sounding "Thank You" as you leave her office will swell her ego, and may help the way she thinks of you. <br>  If you actually DO get stuck with the work, then other teachers in the same subject may be able to help. Your teacher may lighten up with you, but if her methods aren't getting through, someone else may unlock the subject for you!<br>  <br>  If your teacher is still cold towards you, ask other teachers for help, and find an ally. They aren't exactly allowed to discuss their opinions of eachother, but if you mention you feel awkward around her, one of the other teachers may give you the "I know what you mean" look. <br>  It's always nice to know it's not just you, even if there's 'nowt you can do.

Go ahead, study abroad!|`|9977764272d89791dbe653655d661597aa	.....When you say study abroad, do you mean go to a completely different country to study? <br>  Or do you just mean study while you're on vacation?<br>  <br>  Studying abroad makes no difference because home follows you wherever you move.<br>  <br>  Studying on vacation is utter fail, because you don't want to waste any time while on vacation studying, whether you're in a hotel room or on a plane. You either end up watching TV, making more plans, or sleeping. Studying just doesn't work there.<br>  And vacation makes you too relaxed, believe me.<br>  <br>  At home is the best, because you have all your materials within reach, and if not you probably have a store nearby that you know well. Just make sure you turn off your internet, put away your games, etc. You must use your willpower to succeed ;o<br>  <br>  That being said, no matter where you go if you keep focused it will work. I'd still study at home though.|`|zA34N6Jwaa	I've done both -- either one is fine, just depends on what you want to do. It's definitely a little harder away from home as you're completely on your own and you are responsible for taking care of yourself (you have do to your own grocery shopping, cooking, do your own laundry, run your own errands, etc.) which takes up lot more of your time which could be spent studying. On the other hand though, I think it's good to get a change of scenery and experience being away from home. It can get depressing when all your friends go away to college and you are stuck at home. Then again, if there ever was a good time to stay home, now is the time to do it considering the state of our economy. I personally would go away to college, although you could always try one year at home and then another year away and see which one you like better.|`|liAcHx7Aaa	omg at home...trust me that's what my parents told me.,..i tried to study on the first night we were there....but i felt really left out...and then for the rest of holiday i done Absolutely nothing!!|`|iJbslaQNaa	depends on what country your studying in. but i prefer abroad and in AUSTRALIA<br>  cheers!|`|wTZaCRRtaa	In my opinion I think abroad.

Registration through the Nursing & Midwifery Council (NMC) is essential in order to work in the UK as a registered nurse, midwife or health visitor.<br>  <br>  Entry to nurse training is not degree specific, although there may be some exemptions from part of the training for graduates in certain sciences. There are no national minimum entry requirements for entry into nursing and midwifery as each institution sets its own criteria. However, most look for around five GCSEs (or equivalent), including grade C or above in English language or literature and a science subject, for a nursing diploma programme, and five GCSEs plus two A-levels (or equivalent) for a nursing degree programme. All applicants must be able to demonstrate evidence of literacy, numeracy and good character.<br>  <br>  In order to undertake health visiting training, candidates must be qualified at diploma level with 120 credit accumulation and transfer (CAT) points in nursing at Level 2, and usually need at least two years' experience of working as a nurse. Whilst health visiting courses vary between institutions, they generally cover public health, networking and management, mentoring and clinical supervision. In addition to following a core study programme, there are opportunities to develop personal interests and specialisms through module options in other areas, e.g. post-natal depression and domestic violence. Courses lead to a BSc-level qualification and accreditation as a health visitor. Some courses also offer the opportunity to gain a postgraduate certificate. Courses can generally be studied on a one-year full-time or a two-year part-time basis.<br>  <br>  Pre-entry experience that demonstrates a commitment to working in the community or is of direct relevance to the work of a health visitor is useful. Applicants with experience of obstetrics, midwifery or paediatrics, or of working in a community or health promotions setting, will be at an advantage. Potential candidates will need to show evidence of the following:<br>  <br>      * an approachable personality and the ability to get on well with people of all ages and backgrounds;<br>      * patience, tact and a persuasive nature;<br>      * the ability to interpret body language and other non-verbal communication;<br>      * an interest in health and social issues and for developing programmes that will improve public health;<br>      * excellent communication and listening skills: although you work independently for much of the time, you also work closely with patients and multidisciplinary teams, liaising with other health care staff, social services, government agencies and charities;<br>      * responsibility, with good time management and organisational skills;<br>      * confidence and the emotional maturity to deal with distressing issues and potentially challenging situations. <br>  <br>  Before joining a trust of The National Health Service (NHS) you will be asked for a series of pre-employment checks, including occupational health and Criminal Records Bureau (CRB) checks.<br>  <br>  Most health visiting students are seconded on to a programme by an employer, generally a local health authority, but some fund themselves. For further information about funding, and for general information about health visiting, contact The Community Practitioners' and Health Visitors' Association (CPHVA) or your local Workforce Development Confederation (WDC).<br>  <br>  Competition for traineeships is high, so you may need to apply in successive years in order to gain a place on a course. Competition for jobs following training may also be fierce.<br>  <br>  It is illegal for employers to discriminate against candidates on the grounds of age, gender, race, disability, sexual orientation or religious faith.

Ftkr9jqYaa	Kandinsky's creation of purely abstract work followed a long period of development and maturation of intense theoretical thought based on his personal artistic experiences. He called this devotion to inner beauty, fervor of spirit, and deep spiritual desire inner necessity, which was a central aspect of his art.<br>  <br>  Kandinsky learned from a variety of sources during his youth and life in Moscow. Later in his life, he would recall being fascinated and unusually stimulated by color as a child. The fascination with color symbolism and psychology continued as he grew. In 1889 he was part of an ethnographic research group north of Moscow. In Looks on the Past he relates that the houses and churches were decorated with such shimmering colors that, upon entering them, he had the impression that he was moving into a painting. The experience and his study of the folk art in the region, in particular the use of bright colors on a dark background, was reflected in much his early work. A few years later, he first related the act of painting to creating music in the manner for which he would later become noted and wrote, "Color is the keyboard, the eyes are the hammer, the soul is the piano with the strings."<br>  <br>  It was not until 1896, at the age of 30, that Kandinsky gave up a promising career teaching law and economics to enroll in art school in Munich. He was not immediately granted admission in Munich, and began learning art on his own. Also in 1896, prior to leaving Moscow, he saw an exhibit of paintings by Monet, and was particularly taken with the famous impressionistic Haystacks which, to him, had a powerful sense of color almost independent of the objects themselves. Later he would write about this experience:<br>  <br>  "That it was a haystack the catalogue informed me. I could not recognize it. This non-recognition was painful to me. I considered that the painter had no right to paint indistinctly. I dully felt that the object of the painting was missing. And I noticed with surprise and confusion that the picture not only gripped me, but impressed itself ineradicably on my memory. Painting took on a fairy-tale power and splendour."<br>  <br>  He was similarly influenced during this period by Richard Wagner's Lohengrin which, he felt, pushed the limits of music and melody beyond standard lyricism.<br>  <br>  Kandinsky was also spiritually influenced by H. P. Blavatsky (1831–1891), the most important exponent of Theosophy in modern times. Theosophical theory postulates that creation is a geometrical progression, beginning with a single point. The creative aspect of the forms is expressed by the descending series of circles, triangles, and squares. Kandinsky's books Concerning the Spiritual In Art (1910) and Point and Line to Plane (1926) echoed this basic Theosophical tenet.<br>  <br>  Artistic Metamorphosis (1896–1911):<br>   <br>  Kandinsky's time at art school, typically considered difficult to get through, was eased by the fact that he was older and more settled than the other students. It was during this time that he began to emerge as a true art theorist in addition to being a painter. The number of existing paintings increased at the beginning of the 20th century, and much remains of the many landscapes and towns that he painted, using broad swaths of color but recognizable forms. For the most part, however, Kandinsky's paintings did not emphasize any human figures. An exception is Sunday, Old Russia (1904), where Kandinsky recreates a highly colorful (and fanciful) view of peasants and nobles before the walls of a town. Riding Couple (1907) depicts a man on horseback, holding a woman with tenderness and care as they ride past a Russian town with luminous walls across a river. Yet the horse is muted, while the leaves in the trees, the town, and the reflections in the river glisten with spots of color and brightness. The work shows the influence of pointillism in the way the depth of field is collapsed into a flat luminescent surface. Fauvism is also apparent in these early works. Colors are used to express the artist's experience of subject matter, not to describe objective nature.<br>  <br>  Perhaps the most important of Kandinsky's paintings from the first decade of the 1900s was The Blue Rider (1903), which shows a small cloaked figure on a speeding horse rushing through a rocky meadow. The rider's cloak is a medium blue, and the shadow cast is a darker blue. In the foreground are more amorphous blue shadows, presumably the counterparts of the fall trees in the background. The Blue Rider in the painting is prominent, but not clearly defined, and the horse has an unnatural gait.  This type of intentional disjunction, allowing viewers to participate in the creation of the artwork, would become an increasingly conscious technique used by Kandinsky in subsequent years, culminating in the (often nominally) abstract works of the 1911–1914 period. In The Blue Rider, Kandinsky shows the rider more as a series of colors than of specific details.<br>  <br>  From 1906 to 1908 Kandinsky spent a great deal of time traveling across Europe, (he was an associate of the Blue Rose symbolist group of Moscow) until he settled in the small Bavarian town of Murnau. The Blue Mountain (1908–1909) was painted at this time and shows more of his trend towards pure abstraction. A mountain of blue is flanked by two broad trees, one yellow and one red. A procession of some sort with three riders and several others crosses at the bottom. The faces, clothing, and saddles of the riders are each a single color, and neither they nor the walking figures display any real detail. The broad use of color in The Blue Mountain, illustrates Kandinsky's move towards an art in which color is presented independently of form.<br>  <br>  In addition to painting, Kandinsky developed his voice as an art theorist. In fact, Kandinsky's influence on the history of Western art stems perhaps more from his theoretical works than from his paintings. He helped to found the Neue Künstlervereinigung München (New Artists' Association) and became its president in 1909. The group was unable to integrate the more radical approach of those like Kandinsky with more conventional ideas of art, and the group dissolved in late 1911. Kandinsky then moved to form a new group, The Blue Rider (Der Blaue Reiter) with like minded artists such as August Macke and Franz Marc.<br>  <br>  Through the years 1918 to 1921, Kandinsky dealt with the cultural development politics of Russia and collaborated in the domains of art pedagogy and museum reforms. He devoted his time to artistic teaching with a program based on form and color analysis, as well as participating in the organization of the Institute of Artistic Culture in Moscow. He painted little during this period. In 1916 he met Nina Andreievskaia, who in the following year became his wife. His spiritual, expressionistic view of art was ultimately rejected by the more radical members of the Institute as too individualistic and bourgeois. In 1921, Kandinsky received the mission to go to Germany to attend the Bauhaus of Weimar, on the invitation of its founder, the architect Walter Gropius.<br>  <br>  The Bauhaus (1922–1933):<br>   <br>  The Bauhaus was an innovative architecture and art school whose objectives included the merging of plastic arts with applied arts, reflected in its teaching methods based on the theoretical and practical application of the plastic arts synthesis. Kandinsky taught the basic design class for beginners, the course on advanced theory as well as conducting painting classes and a workshop where he completed his color theory with new elements of form psychology. The development of his works on forms study, particularly on point and different forms of lines, lead to the publication of his second major theoretical book Point and Line to Plane in 1926.<br>  <br>  Geometrical elements took on increasing importance in his teaching as well as in his painting, particularly circle, half-circle, the angle, straight lines and curves. This period was a period of intense production. The freedom of which is characterised in each of his works by the treatment of planes rich in colors and magnificent gradations as in the painting Yellow – red – blue (1925), where Kandinsky shows his distance from constructivism and suprematism movements whose influence was increasing at this time.<br>  <br>  Kandinsky was one of Die Blaue Vier (Blue Four), with Klee, Feininger and von Jawlensky, formed in 1923. They lectured and exhibited together in the USA in 1924.<br>  <br>  The Great Synthesis (1934–1944):<br>  <br>  During these years Kandinsky combined all of his previous styles.  He intended his forms, which he subtly harmonized and placed, to resonate with the observer's own soul.<br>  <br>  Kandinsky's conception of art:<br>  <br>  (1) The artist as prophet<br>  (2) Artistic and spiritual theoretician<br>  (3) Theoretical writings on art<br>  (4) Concerning the Spiritual in Art<br>  (5) Point and line to plane

A lot of songs remind me of my teen years, a lot of Elton John and Billy Joel and Linda Ronstadt. Fleetwood Mac makes me think of my early 20s, to me their songs about being free and living life to the fullest makes me think of my early 20s. My friend and I used to try to recreate Madonna's videos in the 80s and just fall down laughing from it. I guess we only like to think of good things from the past and not the bad. I have been through lots of relationships and different times in my life and music sort of defines every era. I am 52 and my bf is 47 and we still love oldies and classic rock, because those were the times of our lives.

AA11403712	Being a teacher, you define good teaching by what your students learn. You can talk to your students all day long and if they walk away with nothing then that is a problem. A good teacher has students that want to better themselves and like the teacher because they know he/she is there for them. When you look at your students and they are looking at you, engaged, and involved, that is good teaching.|`|c29e52663578aeb446d60cfbde61aa2daa	Good teaching is something beautiful. It captures the attention of the listeners. The teacher is well-prepared, knows what he or she has to communicate and above all is aware to what heights of knowledge the students need to be guided. The one who can offer good teaching communicates clearly, convincingly and for the good of the students. Good teaching is characterized by good example and the teacher’s ability to understand the students. Good teaching generates plenty of questions too from the students.|`|MXgrlSd0aa	Good teaching is when all of your students meet your teaching objectives.

sYWOd2NYaa	Take Psychology in highschool and focus on Sciences. In college you first would do an undergraduate degree in what ever you would like. I recommend Psychology its self. Than you apply to medical school. And than from there you focus on psychology. Than you internship. long process about 11 - 12 years the reason why I did not pursue since I want a family. <br>  <br>  <br>  1Take lots of science courses in high school to best prepare yourself for a college premedical program. Include physics, chemistry and biology. <br>  Step2Visit the Medical Schools Web page (aamc.org/medicalschools.htm) for a list of U.S. and Canadian medical schools. Contact your top choices about the college premedical courses that you'll need for admission. <br>  Step3Peruse the Princeton Review Web site (review.com) for a listing of colleges and their programs. Send for catalogs and applications. Be certain that the colleges to which you apply offer all the prerequisite premedical courses. <br>  Step4Maintain a high grade point average, especially in your science courses. The competition for medical school is intense. <br>  Step5Take the Medical Admission Test (MCAT) at the end of your junior year in college. Ask your adviser how to best handle the paperwork involved in medical school applications. <br>  Step6Complete four years of medical school, pass your medical boards, and you will have your Medical Doctor (M.D.) degree and, most likely, an enormous loan to repay. <br>  Step7Begin your four-year residency in psychiatry, which is actually on-the-job training for which you will receive a salary. Depending on the state in which you work as a resident, you will take your medical licensing examination sometime during this period. <br>  Step8Consider continuing your training to receiving board certification in a subspecialty such as forensic psychiatry, child psychiatry or geriatric psychiatry.|`|SIhxrxD3aa	Psychiatrists are medical doctors.  So, after high school you would need to get a bachelor's degree and take the pre-med courses.  Your bachelor's degree can be in anything you want, but psychology might be good if you're wanting to go into psychiatry.  The pre-med courses will include a lot of chemistry, biology and physics.  You can help yourself by taking those in high school so you start out on the same foot as other pre-med students.  <br>  After your bachelor's degree you go to med school and get your MD.  This takes 4 years.<br>  After that you'd need to do your residency which will take at least 4 years, but I believe psychiatry is longer.|`|3MM64geHaa	Psychiatrists are medical doctors. You have to complete medical school and then do a residency in psychiatry. You will need math and science. If you want to be a psychologist, you have to get a PhD.  Math--especially statistics-- is needed. IF you just want to be a counselor you will need a masters degree. General studies in high school, a bachelors degree in psychology would set you on the right path.

sYWOd2NYaa	Step1Take high school biology, chemistry, physics, health and mathematics courses. Maintain a high grade point average. <br>  Step2Ask your guidance counselor for information on colleges that have a two-year pre-dental program that emphasizes the sciences. Most pre-dental students complete a bachelor's degree. <br>  Step3Send for college catalogs and applications. Apply well before the deadline date. <br>  Step4Commit yourself to receiving high grades in college, especially in your science courses. <br>  Step5Contact the American Dental Association for a list of four-year dental schools accredited by the Commission on Dental Accreditation. Make certain you'll meet the admission requirements. (See the ADA Web site at ada.org.) <br>  Step6Take the Dental Admissions Test (DAT). Your test scores, overall grade point average, science average and recommendations will all weigh heavily in the decision to admit you to a dental school. <br>  Step7Understand that the first two years in dental school will consist of classroom and lab courses. The final two years are spent in clinics under the supervision of licensed dentists. <br>  Step8Obtain your license by passing additional written and practical state examinations after you've graduated from dental school. Make certain you know what your state's licensing requirements are well before you get to this point. <br>  Step9Check on your state's requirements for specialty licenses in the dental field. An additional two to five years of study is required.|`|j7cr8hAoaa	College first, where you would major in Pre-dental (or something along those lines) and then you would have to transfer or go to a dental school when you got done.

AA10461474	Yes, they will know all your scores. Its generally advised not take it more than 3 times. Remember, most colleges use a combination of your scores and use  your highest composite SAT score: They take the highest combination of your scores for each section. So if you take it again and your math score improves but your writing score goes down, your overall score is actually higher.
AA10176626	sfdaff:<br>  <br>  You are correct to have concerns about the use of your financial aid money. Though the financial aid office has no control over what you actually spend your money on, there's something that you need to keep in mind.<br>  <br>  Suppose I was your wealthy uncle, and I promised to provide you with all the money you needed to pay your bills. I didn't quite trust your ability to make the best financial decisions, so I sat down with you, and figured out exactly what it should cost you to pay your bills every month. <br>  <br>  Because I wasn't sure that your expenses were exactly typical, I somehow got a hold of estimates of what the "average" young man in your situation was paying every month. I found out what the average person spent on a place to live, what the average person spent on food bills, what the average person spent for utilities, etc.<br>  <br>  I added it all up, and I threw in just a little bit of extra money on top for your miscellaneous expenses, and I said "Sfdaff, my boy, I'm going to send you a check for $3123.39 every month. That's more than enough to pay your bills, assuming that you learn to live like an average young man your age."<br>  <br>  Financial aid is like that. Your financial aid eligibility is based on your school's Cost of Attendance estimate - an estimate of what it should cost the average student "like you" to pay your tuition, your school fees, your books, your room and board, and your miscellaneous college expenses this year. This is specific to YOUR school - and students in YOUR situation - for example, there's a different Cost of Attendance estimate for students who live in the dorms and students who live off-campus.<br>  <br>  What I'm telling you is that the financial aid that you are receiving is based on the school's estimate of how much you will ACTUALLY need JUST to pay for school. They didn't add in any money for your video games, but your reasonable food expenses are in there, and so is an allowance for what it would cost you to buy the gas that gets you back and forth to school every day.<br>  <br>  In other words, then, the overage check that you receive is not really "extra" money - it's given to you to pay the school-related bills that don't get paid directly to the school. That money should pay for your food and your housing and your books and your gas - but not for things that aren't really school-related, like credit card bills, or video games, or vacations.<br>  <br>  Truthfully, there is nothing stopping you from using the money for non-school expenses, but that means that you'll be spending money that you need for school - if you spend your school money on other things, you'll need to come up with money to pay the school expenses from somewhere else.<br>  <br>  I hope that made sense to you - it IS a struggle to manage all those school expenses. Good luck!|`|Bx82t8SRaa	y not u have to eat to live to go to school

To be a teacher's favorite, you don't really need to do things for them...they like you because you make them feel they are teaching well if you get good grades. Or if you generally just have a good personality, like you joke around with them or are just pleasant with them WHILE getting good grades, there's a good chance that you are a teacher's favorite. <br>  <br>  Hope I helped!
9x8tOaIyaa	Let's say you went into a furniture store and bought a new bedroom suite.  The price is $1,000.00.  You bought it from Furniture Fashions.  The good looking man who sold you the furniture will generate a credit sales invoice showing what you bought, how much each piece was, how much taxes are, and total amount you owe Furniture Fashions.  This invoice will be in duplicate, the nice-looking guy will smile and give you a copy which is your credit purchase invoice and he will keep a copy which is his credit sales invoice.  The key words are "purchase" and "sales".<br>  A Credit Purchase Invoice can also mean that Furniture Fashions OWES YOU some money from a previous purchase you made (maybe they charged you the wrong price on the dining room table or you have returned a side table that was too big) in that case the "Credit" (or deduction) will be applied toward your current purchase, so you'll owe them less.

Its really rather pathetic and a serious personality flaw. Don't let other people especially bullies define you, you deserve better.|`|mmpxd5Ouaa	Beacuse they don't know any better. But if they treat you badly, they are not your friends.
ccEWxExfaa	Laugh Out Loud is very much over-used.<br>  So is lmao,lmfao,rofl,and wtf----I'm sick of all of them.|`|U8aXa8xEaa	It still means "laughing out loud"<br>  <br>  They are probably just easiy amused, or they are trying to convey the point that they are kidding.  Sometimes what we write can seem like we are angry if we don't specify that we are kidding. <br>  <br>  examples:<br>  <br>  Bite me<br>  or <br>  Bite me.  lol<br>  <br>  See what I mean?

spbCARk6aa	The best way to end an essay is not to repeat your exact words from the first paragraph but to rephrase the entire essay into a few sentences. <br>  <br>  I always found that if my essay was only a few paragraphs, (anything less than a page actually) then the rephrasing thing doesn't work very well. Instead I tell what I learned from the essay topic and whether or not it was an informative topic. Of course, you probably don't want to use 'I' in this essay so say something like:<br>  <br>  "The Lord of the Flies was an excellent and well written novel. The two movies adaptations blah blah blah."|`|AA10221270	finsh it with the words ::<br>  <br>  <br>  Peace out, now give me top scores
sDdgyyXbaa	Absolutely. I did it the opposite way around. I qualified in England then moved home to Scotland. My friend is in the process of applying to England for a teaching post. The advice I will give you is to make sure your application to the GTC of England is underway and when it comes to interviews, really hone in the new curriculum for excellence. The use of learning intentions, objectives as they are known in England, have been in use for quite some time now. The new curriculum is well in line with the English system. Hope this is useful.|`|hISwD8tcaa	Does that course definately give you QTS (qualified teacher status) because you need that in england to be able to teach, and i'd imagine scotland too.<br>  <br>  This is the governements teaching website<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.tda.gov.uk/" rel="nofollow">http://www.tda.gov.uk/</a><br>  <br>  so go on that and it should answer you question but if not email or ring them, theyre very helpful|`|jCkLYey7aa	you should be fine in the UK sometimes you even have to take certain paperwork for the different councils you fall over with you should be okay!|`|7cUDstdjaa	Should be acceptable in either Scotland or England (throughout UK)<br>  <br>  Just drop the accent, so that the kids can understand you.|`|7hmjTUubaa	i know Scotland has a different education and law system than England and Wales but i'm sure your qualifications will still meet the requirements in England.

NcQY1ayRaa	If you have never been to University before you are an UNDERGRADUATE. <br>  <br>  But if you have been to University and say completed a Bachelors in Medicine, you can go back and do a Doctorate in Medicine. You would be a POSTGRADUATE.|`|b8tgCAQJaa	An undergraduate student is one who is studying for a bachelor's degree (BA, BSc, BEng, etc.) or an undergraduate Master's degree (MEng, etc.)<br>  <br>  A postgraduate student is one who already has an undergraduate degree, and is studying for a PhD or a postgraduate Master's degree (MA, MSc, etc.)|`|fb5e6abe0d15467cb8e98fd9cd776d9daa	Undergraduate is studying for a bachelor's degree (BSc/Ba), postgraduate is study done after getting such a degree, usually towards a Masters (MSc/Ma).|`|FD8I4zthaa	Postgraduates have already graduated (finished their undergraduate studies) and are proceeding to a higher degree (MSc, Ma or even PhD)|`|0LUBf2Juaa	The clue is kind of in the question.

I think you mean Social Insurance Number...which are given to Canadians... though i'm an indian i believe no one else from any other country can use your SIN number... This is what Wikipedia says-<br>  "Unless an organization can demonstrate that the reason they are asking for a person's SIN is specifically allowed by law, or that no alternative identifiers would suffice to complete the transaction, they cannot deny or refuse a product or service on the grounds of a refusal to provide a SIN."|`|03ec65bf77c70de35e61bf195676e487aa	Sin number?

It's professional, and easy to put together! <br>  In order to make more profits, you could charge more for the cappuccino, or you could just buy cheaper fixings. Maybe put less cream in it, or more water. The possibilities are endless. <br>  <br>  Hope this helped!
DjRCYuLXaa	So that the men could defend them- if attackers come in from the front door a man has a chance to fight off the attackers while the women and children escape.  This is also why many men in our culture sleep on the side of the bed closest to the door of the bedroom.
lG1gW8Hnaa	Hope it is in college. You can do it like this:<br>  <br>  “Respected Principal, teachers and other dignitaries on the stage; (name them if known),<br>  We are here to bid farewell to a group of students who have completed their course and will be  entering the wide world outside to pursue higher academic qualifications or look for suitable jobs.  I wish them best of luck As a junior, I have greatly benefited from their guidance, counsel and friendship.  Parting is always sad, but there is an end to everything and they are about to launch their lives in a wider angle and shoulder greater responsibilities. On behalf of all of you, I once again wish them success in their endeavors”.<br>  <br>  You may add some anecdotes in your college life to substantiate the above, interspersed with some quotations if needed.  However, I feel quotations are not that important, because the purpose is you let your own feelings known on such occasions.<br>  Have confidence and start your programme!|`|jjpwYLeuaa	You can innovate it by giving special names to seniors ...who u/ur school guys loved most..quotes is old fashioned..try two way communication with seniors ..thats what i did and was aprrreciated by most
