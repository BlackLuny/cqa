20090219130324AAjDaZU	Education & Reference;Homework Help	Can somebody please help me answer this math question? It is very important that I get the answer by tomorrow.?	At my school there are 3 trimesters and the second one ends tomorrow. In order to get my average from 79 to 80, I need to get this bonus question correct. Please help!      Here is the problem:   Suppose that at the start of 2009, the monkeys on Cayo Island are classified as being in one of two groups based on their fur color. Group A contains monkeys with a vibrant orange fur that makes them very easy for predators to detect and Group B contains monkeys with brown fur, which enables them to hide in trees and avoid detection by predators. Group B’s brown fur allows its members to survive longer and have a higher rate of reproduction than monkeys in Group A. As a result, the population of Group A doubles every 5 years, while the population of Group B doubles every 4 years. Through the classification/identification process, it was found that Group A has 200 monkeys and Group B has 25 monkeys.      I am not sure if it is 4000 or 2000 monkeys at the start of 2029. Can somebody please clarify this for me and tell me how they got there? Thanks in advance.

20090219141003AAgFl87	Education & Reference;Homework Help	What does all this mean? It is some info on Joan of Arc needed for school. The wording is just a little weird?	In May 1430, as she was attempting to relieve Compiegne, she was captured by the Burgundians and sold to the English when Charles and the French did nothing to save her. After months of imprisonment, she was tried at Rouen by a tribunal presided over by the infamous Peter Cauchon, Bishop of Beauvais, who hoped that the English would help him to become archbishop.       Through her unfamiliarity with the technicalities of theology, Joan was trapped into making a few damaging statements. When she refused to retract the assertion that it was the saints of God who had commanded her to do what she had done, she was condemned to death as a heretic, sorceress, and adulteress, and burned at the stake on May 30, 1431.

In the end it's meant to teach people about World Hunger and the effect of it on people who don't fully understand it.   Can someone give me a follow on from what I've got, just to give me an idea of what might happen.         I don't know what is going to happen in this story.   Please help me, I really need it.    Thanks.      The story:      Throughout my childhood, I had always been told that not everybody was as fortunate as me. If I deliberately left the yucky green broccoli or the soggy cabbage sitting on my plate, pretending that they weren’t there, I was given a lecture about people who don’t have enough to eat in poorer countries and that they would give their right arm for something like that. ”Lorna, you will eat what I give you, or you’ll get nothing else. It’s as simple as that! Have you seen these poor children who are starving, on the television?”    In the end, I was forced to chew them into a green pulp and have them slide down my throat, leaving a horrible after-taste in my mouth. But, as my mother said, they were good for me and would make me grow up strong and healthy. I knew this, but I couldn’t stand them and would try to persuade her by saying she probably turned them away when she was my age. Unluckily, there was no changing her decision and she would never admit to me that she didn’t like vegetables. But that was me then. I went through life always thinking back to those days. I embark on a story, which changed the way I looked at the poor children and families who never did have enough to eat…      It all started when I was twenty nine. My mother had moved out to live in Malawi, as she worked with an organisation there, which helped the poorer people of the country. She’d been devoted to helping others, which were less fortunate and needed support and care. She had always been a strong, independent woman, who didn’t need anybody to tell her what to do in life. She had her own ways and thoughts, and always did what she thought was best, not just for her family, but for others around her. Anyway, her continued work in Malawi became slightly more difficult, so I offered to help her out. She immediately said yes, and the next thing I knew, I was on a plane with my three children, Rachel, Hannah and Luke, travelling to Malawi. It was a long and tiring journey and after hours of constant bickering about who’s sitting at the window seat and a 6 month old baby crying, we finally arrived at our destination.   My mother greeted us with hugs and kisses. She was obviously happy to see me, or so I hoped. We stayed in the village near Malawi, in a house with walls made of mud and a roof made of straw, twigs and leaves. These people obviously knew how to construct homes for themselves and seemed like a dedicated talent of theirs. I almost immediately got to work. There were a lot of families and children, settled in the temporary housing facilities. Most were suffering from lack of food and poor health which was caused by this.

What hands are here! Ha, they pluck out mine eyes.    Will all great Neptune’s ocean wash this blood    Clean from my hand? No, this my hand will rather    The multitudinous seas incarnadine,    Making the green one red.”      Quote #4   “Out, damned spot; out, I say.    One, two,—why, then ’tis time to do’t.

I live in Pennsylvania, and I would really like to go to Temple University in Philidelphia, Penn State University (main campus), University of Texas @ Austin (main campus), New York University, or Brown University (Ivy) to major in either Journalism or Athletic Training.   I was just wondering which colleges you think I could qualify for and what I could do more to better my chances of getting in. I am currently at the top 56% of my class, and I have a 3.2 GPA, so I am very close to meeting those requirements. Now I have two and a half more years of high school, to higher grades and do all of the stuff.     Here are my current overall grades for my classes this year:    Desktop Publishing - 96%  Comp. English 10 - 88%  Journalism I - 95%  Physical Education - 95%  Health 10 - 89%  Family and Consumer Science 10 - 86%  Geometry - 85%  Chorus - 98%  Physical Science - 83%  U.S. History II Honors - 80%    Also, I know colleges like their students to be involved in extraciricular activites, and I am involve in a few.....    -I was an Assistant Counselor at a children's summer camp for two years.  -I'm in my church's youth group.  -I'm a journalist for my high school's newspaper.  -I'm hoping to become sports editor of my school's newspaper, next year (so this one doesn't count yet).  -I'm in the SADD Club at my school.  -I'm a manager for my high school's wrestling team.  -I'm going to be joining my high school's tennis team this year.  -I'm finally going to be a Student Intern Athletic Trainer for my school's baseball team.  Now I know that Brown is an Ivy League School and that Penn State and the University of Texas at Austin Main Campuses are really good schools that have a lot of competition to get into.    Which of the colleges abover do you think I could easily get into?

20090220084731AAMpHQr	Education & Reference;Teaching	Please help me edit  im a Esl student?	“Pediatric nursing facts”   I worked as a CENA for 3 years, so I understand all nursing involves care planning, charting, and taking care of patient needs. I have worked in both a nursing home and hospital. I have experience working with both adults and children. I understand that pediatric nursing involves specializing care of children both emotionally and physically.           I chose Pediatric Nursing as my topic because I want to specialize in working with kids as a  pediatric nurse. I love kids. Children are special and I would love to take care children and their families. I am very curious about the requirements, responsibilities, challenges, salary and the work schedule of a pediatric nurse? I know I have many questions, but I can only think of a few right now. More questions will pop up as I go along, working on this project.       I began my search on the web and was able to find a helpful article on the requirements of pediatric nursing. There is some education necessary before become an pediatric nurse. It is required to take 2-3 year  Registered Nurse program. According to the article, “Pediatric Nurse Certification." Pediatric nurses are require to have a license in special training in pediatrics and a CPEN or CPN certificate. Some courses that need to be taken are  Growth and Development, Physiology/Pathophysiology, Family Centered Care, Health Promotion /Maintenance”(Pediatric Nurse Certification). I was thinking that a license in practical nursing was acceptable to qualify as a pediatric nurse.                Those involved in pediatric nursing have a lot different responsibilities. Most  children nurses work in the hospital and the doctor offices under the supervision of doctors.  According to the  article, NOEDb The duty of Pediatric nursing is determined by the patient condition and which facility that the nurse is employed. ("Pediatric Nursing?.") Pediatric nurse must be loving ,compassion and caring and have patience. I know as a pediatric nurse I would want to give the best care. since their lives in our hands. Pediatric nurses must be able to interact with parent and show love and concern in the proper way. For example showing a mother the proper way to hold  her infant and how to bond. Pediatric nurses have to be very supportive emotionally. Like helping a family member cope with a child who has died. One must know how to comfort them and be supportive. It is required as a children's nurse to have good listen skills and know  how to balance between work and interaction with family in a tough situation. As a Pediatric Nurse on have to prepare for children emergencies, such as dealing with an injured child in an emergency room or helping a child battle with cancer. Pediatric Nurses should be able to relate to worried parents and other family members and in any field patience is needed. According to the The Gift of Nursing “the nurse ability to recognize opportunities to address the emotional well being of family members can result in better quality of life for both patient and family”.(Buell,Lisa p.477) Children’s nurses must also have some compassion and patience and have a desire to take care of kids.  Other responsibilities of a pediatric includes doing regular follow ups on the patients. For example when the pediatric nurse  has a ill child blood and urine tests are given. Base on those results will determine how long the child may stay in the hospital. The vital signs that are ordered will indicate if anything is abnormal in the child so other testing can be done (“All you Need to be a Pediatric Nurse...."). I will like to add there are so many responsibilities as pediatric nurse so their work is endless.     In  pediatric nursing the challenges are dealing with uncooperative children  quality or care . Children nurses must know how to work with uncooperative children. Nurses should know what do in a situation if a child is scared or upset. For example the best way to deal with a child who is scared of a getting a shot might benefit from having parents in the medical room during vaccination.  Pediatric nurses must know what to say and how to comfort the child and make things better .            Trying to make sure good quality care is done for each child may be a factor. The appropriate care may not be given if there is, an insurance or low budget issue. For  instance the  well-being of the patient might be a stake because of issue like downsizing and lacking enough nurses to get proper care. ("Ethical and legal challenges for pediatric nurses: an open letter."). Providing good care to patients is a major concern when there is not enough money to cover the insurance.  I believe children should receive the best of care and should be treated with dignity and respect. They should not be denied  care because of lack of insurance, especially if it a serious life and death situation. Pediatric Nurses have to be able to cope with stress and learn how to deal with children

Question 2: (2 points)         Exercise 5-14 Percentage-of-completion method; solve for unknowns LO4       In 2009, Long Construction Corporation began construction work under a three-year contract. The contract price is $1,620,000. Long uses the percentage-of-completion method for financial reporting purposes. The financial statement presentation relating to this contract at December 31, 2009, is as follows:           Balance Sheet     Accounts Receivable (from construction progress billings)     $32,000           Construction in Progress  $105,000              Less: Billings on Construction Contract  (95,000)        Cost of Uncompleted Contracts in Excess of Billings     10,000                 Income statement     Income (before tax) on the contract recognized in 2009     $25,000                 Required:           What was the cost of construction actually incurred in 2009?    How much cash was collected in 2009 on this contract?    What was the estimated cost to complete as of the end of 2009?    What was the estimated percentage of completion used to calculate income in 2009?    Round percentage of completion to 2 decimal places, all other answers to nearest whole number. Omit the "$" and "%" sign in your response.       1.  Actual costs incurred in 2009 = $                 2.  Cash collections in 2009 = $                 3.

20090220094517AAtKUAv	Education & Reference;Higher Education (University +)	Who do you go to complain about unfair treatment by teacher and bias? (college)?	My foreign teacher has never liked me. Especially not since I yelled at him about my answer to "functions of gluten". (food science) He blatantly favors Asian students even if they're slackers. He's from Taiwan.      Sadly, in my major I'm forced to continue taking classes will him while I'd rather be stabbing out my own eyes, I have to. Right now I'm taking a class with him out of order, which he was pissed about, tried to kick me out of the class, and accused me of lying my way into. OK, so what ever he obviously doesn't like me? Established but there's no reason his own feelings should be reflected in my grade...      My issue is that he is doing this!    The test that I just took this week was part multiple choice part short answer. The multiple choice I got an 80. I got a 13/40 on his short answer even though I wrote the same things as other people.    He graded them lighter and me more harshly. For instance I said on the test "the food service manager would have to change safety policy" others wrote this and got a point. I wrote this and got a zero because I didn't say which policies to change. He won't give me points for answers I wrote that were in the notes.    A lot of the time he plays it off like the notes are some how different than my answers but really they're just re-worded. Some how he thinks change and improve are different concept.    Example: Change sodas offered on the menu                  Improve soda selection on the menu   Different answers?   It's not just me who is being treated unfairly in this class but it worst when it comes to me.   My last test that I got the 80 on the multiple choice as I was saying but with the short answer calculated in I got a 57 on this test.       Just so you know I'm a dietetic major so I have to take real courses like bio-chem and organic chemistry. This is just a food service management course. Not difficult.      Also he has a retarded participation grade. You only get participation points if you answer a question in class right. My answers are always wrong, even if he later repeats the basic idea of what I said later as the real answer. I never get participationon.      What do I do? Who do I go to in my college?

A 28 kg chandelier is suspended 1.5 m below a ceiling by three wires, each of which has the same tension and the same length of 2.0 m (see the drawing attached).

20090220120353AAKluMn	Education & Reference;Other - Education	Self-plagiarism. Uhh..what?	I've recently come across the issue of self-plagiarism, which doesn't seem possible. Even if you turn in a paper that you have written yourself, your professor doesn't own your work. You haven't sold it to him/her, and so this seems more of an oxymoron than a possibility. I have, of course, reviewed websites saying that it is possible, but almost every adult I have spoken to and who have gone to college, say that they have never heard of such a thing. My own mother has reused her papers.    The definition of plagiarism is: 'a piece of writing that has been copied from someone else and is presented as being your own work' - wordnet.princeton.edu/perl/webwn      I think it's silly, really, that there should be such a controversy over reusing our own work when it is, in fact, OURS. It's an oxymoron, really. Does it make sense to anyone else?

20090203075836AAQZUyQ	Education & Reference;Homework Help	I'm needing a lil help with schoolwork and was wondering if someone might be able to give me a boost?	It is clear that Stephen Blackpool, though he is an honest, upright man, is not very well-spoken. Twice in these chapters, Stephen is given a chance to explain himself, to both his fellow workers and to Mr. Bounderby. Both times he fails miserably, not because he doesn't know what to say, but because he does not speak forcefully and clearly.      For this assignment, pretend that you are an advocate for Stephen. Explain what about Stephen's life is unfair, and explain what Stephen means when he calls his life (and the lives of his fellow-workers) a muddle. First, look up the meaning of the word "muddle" and decide what Stephen means when he says this.      To get into this assignment, pretend that you are in Mr. Bounderby's house, and are given the chance to clarify and interpret what Stephen has said in his defense. Be as clear and as persuasive as possible. You want Mr. Bounderby to be convinced!
