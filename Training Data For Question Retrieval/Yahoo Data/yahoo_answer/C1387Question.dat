20090304123932AAb3Et5	Social Science;Gender & Women's Studies	Am I reading too much into this? I still love him what should I do?	still love this man, I missed my chance with him a few times,he got cold, we work together but could avoid each other if we wanted. I never got in his face after initially (after a big fight) tried to talk to him and he was having none of it. It got to the point that he would see me and walk away. So I asked him if I had offended or hurt him afresh. He said no. the day we couldnt talk about how we felt about things was the day it was over between us. So we resumed workplace acquintance, then he got cold again. Then one of his female fan club turned really nasty on me and he did too, then she said something while he and I were talking and he was OK again. I got afraid something was going on between them and stepped away, but she got so hostile, in the end, I told him what was going down. He said he knew nothing about it. He has been nicer to me,not taking sides (that is why i liked him, he is very fair) but I dont know what to do? I still like him, but dont want to express that in case he thinks I am playing a game. I genuinely smelt a rat and cleared my name with him. But he is making an effort ( though holds back) to appear friendly again.Yet at other times, it's like he is making sure I don't get the wrong idea? I dunno what to do. Is it true or fair that a man will come after you again if he truly wants you? I don't want to make a fool of him or me by saying I still love you. I genuinely see him as an equal, but am afraid that by being loose about it and seeming not to love him, I am discouraging him maybe if he did like me still. See my insecurity meant I never really flirted or went for it like other women do. He feels sorry for me, I am sure of that, but he is trying. If he was afraid I would get into him, would he do even that? I mean if he sees me he tries to talk to me and I am responding?

20090304125722AAcHw75	Social Science;Psychology	Reading total recall question?	I know how many read it takes me to get to total recall when reading 1 chapter or a group of chapters.  Do you think if I read 1 sentence that many times (as many times at it takes me to recall a chapter) I would have the same recall?  It's "hard" to tell from reading that 1 sentence if you remembered it.  Like, I can only tell I remember everything by reading it in sequence.  But, would it make sense to figure it would work just rereading a single sentence that same of X amount of times.  This would just make more confident when studying to get the chunks of information retained separately.  What I had been doing is if x amount of chapters are assigned for a month, I would just read that amount everyday!  Which is kind of crazy but it gets you perfect scores on the test.

Do I have serious issues?   -21 years old, college student--don't really like my major but sticking it out because I have only a year left.   --I don't have any passion..don't get much enjoyment out of much of anything..although, i do like watching stand up comedy.   --never really had close friends growing up..not able to emotionally open myself up   --Extremely sad sometimes (been like that for a couple years now)...no major reason..maybe from living in this messed up world   --Also can be extremely happy and funny...I laugh a lot..maybe to mask my true feelings..I don't know. I value my sense of humor though.   --Most of the time, I find no meaning in life, and think we're all just going to die, so what the hell does it matter what I do with my life?   --never had interest in sex, never been in a relationship..not even sure of my sexuality   --i'm extremely introspective and like to think about and reflect on stuff.   --extremely philosophical...like to look at deep quotes from philosophers   --not sure of my identity--don't really know who I am.

They view this as a turnaround and they say many people will be buying stocks because stocks are so cheap now. Bargain buying. They see this as the start of a new bull market. Is it too premature for them to say that? You know, those analysts on CNBC were all smiles today because of the uptick in the market and the economic solutions proposed by Obama and the Fed today.

(my dad blames it on the xbox, but i dont think its the xboxs fault so much. my bro has always been pre-occupied with things other than school. four-wheeler, and spending time outdoors, now its the xbox, so its really no difference).      so, if he doesnt get from his 40%'s to at least a 50% by june, he's going to have to repeat 9th grade again.       what are some things we can do to get him back on track,   what would you do?      i already suggested time-limiting his xbox play time to something more reasonable.       what else?   study tips?   any parents with the same issues with their kids?   reward systems?   anything you got is welcome.         thanks.
20090304141350AAaF0wb	Social Science;Psychology	"Delusion of persecution"?	it's obvious all people are competitive in dating - meeting people.  So wouldn't it be reasonable this is construed as a "persecution" while in public?   If anyone has seen guys competing for the same woman it should be obvious that "persecution" is indeed fact.   Doesn't it seem that "disorders" typically themselves persecute actions or intentions that are in concept - valid and often better than not having a "disorder"?   "nice guys finish last" for example - because the nice guy has a delusion of persecution?  when in fact it's a lack of hostility toward others?
20090304133622AALkR7Z	Social Science;Psychology	Can someone explain this behavior?	I have a guy friend that I used to be really close to. About a year ago, we had a drunken hook-up. I told him that it was a mistake, and he said it wasn't a big deal to him. Any how, we are still friends, though not as close as we used to be. When we hang out most of the time, we can laugh and have fun, and every things cool. But he seems to always find a way of making some hurtful remarks to me, and I am not a sensitive person but he knows what to say to hurt me, and he always does it in a joking way. And he's always bragging about himself, and at the same time putting me down, like he's trying to prove that he's better than me or something. I don't get it. I know he doesn't want to be with me, and I have told him that I only want to be friends and forget what happened. I don't understand why he is being so deliberately hurtful, but being so passive about it. I never call him, anytime we hang out, its because he has contacted me. I'm just wondering why does he even want to be around me, just so that he can try and make me feel bad about myself?

20090304134951AAtqJzu	Social Science;Economics	What is behind the current economic situation in the USA?	The only thing I can come up with is:   People are buying foreign made products, because of lower standards of living and wages in other countries (equals lower prices) which hurts the work force in the US.   Cost of living is high for workers in the US, which makes companies want to send manufacturing jobs to other countries.   Because of high standards of living, (some) people are spending more than they are making causing a high debt to income ratio, combined with poor lending strategies and job loss, medical bills, etc. which causes many to file bankruptcy hurting the investors and companies.....and it snowballs. In other words, Globalization and reckless use of credit. Do you think this is the case?

20090304140714AAEPmng	Social Science;Economics	Your view on the efficient market hyp. and the random walk?	I am against such unorthodox and heuristic claims. In my opinion, the market is not stochastic - but a chaotic system, which is predictable at some points and random at others. Soros supports this vision as well, as far as I am concerned.    Not only many studies are conducted to disprove the EMH and the random walk idea, but even I in my own humble empirical studies receive some promising results. For example, using neural network(RBF, Backprop, non-linear and linear) models - I were able to predict prices with low RMSE - while the neural networks wasn't able to predict at all, while using random generated numbers...which are even considered pseudo-random.    Apart from the sophisticated nature of the neural networks and genetic algorythms - even easier technical indicators happen to perform well + some of them are backed with decent logic. The problem with neural networks might be their black-box nature, but in indicators such as stochastic oscillator/williams %r, the logic is pretty obvious: buy last - exit first after the oscialltor's axis + your profit in overselling and sell last - exit first after the oscialltor's axis + your profit in overbuying.As you can see - the concept of overbuying/overselling, while not directly linked to the supply and demand, always works on your side - following simple rules.    Aside from all that, in my point of view - it's not the bad predictive power of the technical indicators - but mostly poor money management of people using such analysis. For instance, how many technicalists use Kelly criterion, hedging, compound interest? While simple concepts - such ideas are very poorly exaimed by the technicalysts. Another interesting point arises, in my opinion, due to the fact that some technical indicators hardly work - such as the quest of a "pattern", while others...more sophisticated as the mentioned above oscillators and neural networks - almost surely works, but then again - while their are not acadecly celebrated is more a historical process and not a scientific argument, backed with boolean logic.    So...since I am not going to get great credit(nobel price :), in Yahoo Answers, I'll keep this short...for your answers :).       Thanks

I'm extremely nervous and shy, and each time I talk to some body my face gets immediately red and I start sweating a lot. It doesn't matter if it's a one-on-one conversation or a group conversation, or even when I am with my family I always get red and my body starts sweating, especially my face..I've been having sweaty hands since I was a child but this has become worse and I don't even know why, except for nervousness I think.. which is weird 'cuz sometimes I'm not nervous at all and when I talk to people I immediately start sweating. Some days I could have my hands dry, but for the most part they're sweating!!.. It's a become a great problem because I can't hand-shake other people without them noticing it. It's really embarrassing.

20090304141922AAxCM1C	Social Science;Dream Interpretation	What does being bitten by a poisonous snake means?	This is how my dream goes:               I was walking on a road known to be inhabited by poisonous snakes. My uncle is walking ahead of me.  He was very careful into not stepping on any of the snakes so that he wont get bitten. He was brave, not even a little sign of fear in his action. Though unspoken, he was telling me to follow his lead. As we walked the path further and further, I’ve notice more and more black snakes appeared with a diamond head shape that signifies poisonous. In the end, I got bitten around my ankle despite being so careful. I asked someone to call 911 for me before it's too late. The helicopter finally came to transport me to the hospital where they have access to venom. Afraid of dying, I quickly ran into the door so I could get in. The paramedic blocked my way and told me the helicopter is reserved for another victim. I was surprised to hear that I am not the only one. I was devastated on the other hand because at this time death is inevitable. And to my surprised, I spotted the other helicopter which gave me huge relief.  As the paramedics helped me in to the Helicopter, I begun to feel the effect of the venom in my body. In just a matter of second, I lost my sense oh hearing. My eyes were wide open,  I could see people talking but I couldn't hear them. I could only scream “I can’t hear!”. I thought “this is it, this is the beginning of the end of my life.” At the same time, not worried because the paramedics were calm. In the hospital, I was being shown the human anatomy poster after being carefully evaluated by the Doctor, who obviously, is an expernt at this field, treating patients who are bitten by poisonous snakes.

20090304125415AAnUOZK	Social Science;Gender & Women's Studies	How is the supposed "equality of opportunity" possible given that we are all unique?	We are each born with advantages and disadvantages. For example, my IQ is about 60 points higher than that of the average feminist, so if we had a system in which all had an equal opportunity, I would have to be penalized because of my birthright so that I could under-perform at the same level as feminists. Suppose that I was penalized for my advantages and one day I decided to stop eating my vegetables and became intellectually slovenly as a result. Then I would under-perform relative to feminists because of my broccoli deficit.      And if my IQ, being naturally inborn, is accepted as one of the advantages deemed worthy by the matriarchy, what's to stop them from using it as evidence that I have some other advantage? Perhaps my success is the result of being a white male? Or heterosexual? Or a Republican? Won't "equality" come at the expense of "justice"?

Actually I own the place and he pays a rent to me (which is very low as he is a friend). He has already been late with one rent payment out of just 2 so far. The rent was due yesterday and I asked him for it. He said 'can it wait until tomorrow as I need to go to the bank'. I told him, I need it today so he went out to the local ATM. Then he returned & I asked, 'well did you get the cash'. He said 'yes' and just continued what he was at before without handing over the rent. I didn't feel I should have to ask as he knows well it is due. Then as I was going to bed, he still hadn't come to pay so I asked him. He paid & I told him I was not happy about his earlier comment on 'it can wait until tomorrow'. He said 'well I am busy doing things'. Really, I feel he begrudges handing over the rent. I feel sick when I worry about maybe not getting it. I've had other guys renting that room and never had this apathy. (ps also 2 other friends of his stayed with my permission the last 2 nights as they had no heating in their place. Also I never asked him for a deposit as he is friend!!). Now this evening he has told me that 'he might be moving in 2 weeks'. He had no intention of this before. Also he said 'it is all my fault, I've destroyed the friendship. I'm sorry'. Any advice?

She behaves very shy around me and does not make eye contact when we are close up, but will from a distance. I cannot figure out if she fancies me or if she is just shy. What is your opinion on this?
20090304152530AAXjQPI	Social Science;Psychology	Alcohol and sleepwalking? My boyfriend is very mean in his sleep and pees places and doesn't remember?	My boyfriend drinks everyday. He doesn't appear drunk. He is 28 years old and has been drinking for a long time. He has a high tolerance.   On nights when he drinks right before bed he will fall asleep. If I wake him for some reason he will be very mean. Like he isn't himself. He will not remember it in the slightest the next day.   On one occasion he got out of bed, peed in the orange juice from the fridge, ate a piece of pizza. He remembered none of it in the morning.   We have a 3 month old daughter. My biggest fear is that she will cry and wake him and he will be in his mean sleepwalk mode.      What should I do?

It's rare in real life you'll get some guy just talking to you for hours unless he's chatting you up.  I know you do occasionally get a guy friend who likes to talk a lot, but they seem to be the exception, rather than the rule.      So, do you guys talk / open up more online?  And do you find it easier to talk to / form friendships with women online, than in real life - and if so, why?  :-)
20090304150107AAqnUuZ	Social Science;Psychology	Read note2understand! How can I get over her? Do I just hav 2 learn 2 deal w/the feelings & try 2 get past it?	I have this HUGE crush on 1 of my teachers.  No, it’s more than a crush; I am in love with her.  I don’t know for sure that she is bi, but she can relate to my problems from being a bi female at my school almost too easy to not be bi.  I know she knows I like her as a friend but I don't think she really knows how I really feel about her & how much I care about her.  Last year when she was actually my teacher, I realized I really care about her as like a mom but I didn’t think I was in love with her.  But over the summer I started really missing her & wanting to talk to her so bad.  So I found needless problems that I “needed” to talk to her about & we keep in contact by e-mail.  So back in the beginning of this school year, I told her I would tutor students for her if she needed.  She teaches math, I’m great in math & I love to help so I do some tutoring in my free time.  I thought that if I was tutoring the students for her & seeing her so often I would get over my crush.  That did not work because I only fell more in love with her.  So I stop tutoring some of her students for her for awhile by making up stupid reasons as to why I couldn’t stay after.  Lately I have been trying to stay away (without being rude) but today she came up to me asking if I would tutor a student FOR HER, IN HER CLASSROOM.  I really don’t want to say no but how can I get over her or do I just have to learn to deal with the feelings & try to get past it?
20090304151118AA83Fgh	Social Science;Psychology	My father committed suicide last year March 5th, when you commit suicide, do you go to hell?	My dad committed suicide last year when i was 12. It was terrible, my mom always cried, all the kids in the school made fun of me and made horrible roumers that i don't even want to say.. The worst part was, he did it while all of us were at school, and my mom was at the hospital. He tried once before, but my mom took him to the hospital and he was saved. Its been rough. He was a good father, but his bosses lured him into drugs, and drugs took over his life, even when he wanted to get help he couldn't. Every month that went by, i counted. Every month that went to "5th" i counted as a month and tomorrow, it will turn into a year. It has been troubling me knowing if he had went to hell or heaven. Our priest came over our house and explained that he probably went to heaven. He gave examples and predictions that i forgot about. I know that Is is possible, but not automatic. Is there anywhere in the bible where it clearly states if you kill yourself, you will go to hell? Some strange events happened  the week after it happened. The night he did it, my brother (the one who found him dead) had a dream and my dad was wearing a grey t-****, blue jeans (his usually "casual" outfit) with a white background and he told him to take care of the family and that he is in a safe place. But thats not enough to convince me. Another night, for some strange reason i was with my mom and the tv went blank for a few minutes and we couldn't turn it on. Our cat, that he use to always cuddle with while sleeping all the sudden snuggled with me when i was sleeping, maybe realizing what happened. SInce we were a well known family, the funeral was packed it was very depressing. So, my question to you is, can you find a spot int he bible where it states that if you kill yourself you automatically go to hell. I appreciate the people who actually read all of this, and didn't just answer.
20090304152950AAjxg2l	Social Science;Psychology	Im really not liking my birthday lately?	Well when i was younger of course i loved it, like most little kids, and i usually had my one best friend come over and we would go to a movie or something simple because i don't like making a big deal out of it, well were not friends anymore and she's not really nice,  and i have "friends" but not a lot and i really don't like having people over and im not really that close to them. So i really didn't want to do anything for my 14th birthday, but my family says they feel all bad for me and my parents are acting like they really don't care much but sister is trying to make it fun, but i have a feeling its not going to go well, i really don't like it. Well i guess my question is, what should i do about the whole thing and is it normal not to like your birthday very much and feel really sad and sort of depressed around your birthday?   I didn't really know what category to put this in so i put it in psychology.      Thanks:)

I think it's a fair comparison for what's going on with all these "bailouts" and "stimulus packages."  I think it's all crap.  Give us the money, the ones who could actually send the money different ways (I'd buy a brand new car, buy a house, pay off my parents' house and get a dog).  That's stimulating the economy:  the banks just got 2 mortgages paid off and a car loan; no bad debt.  What's the problem?
