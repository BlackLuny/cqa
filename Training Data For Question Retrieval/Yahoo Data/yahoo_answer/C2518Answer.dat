Or you can use the strong sheets from these to convert to the desired shape. eg. conical turrets/minarets. for dome shape, roll a ball out of newspaper & tape together.  tape all these structures to a board. use as much tape as you like to make it sturdy.  now you papier mache the entire model. apply at least 2 layers of newspaper or kitchen roll strips all over using diluted PVA glue.   when it is all dry - may take a couple of days - you can paint, adorn & add details as required.    this model will not only be cheap & easy to make, but also durable & light enough to carry to school.    you could also visit www.artattack.co.uk for some more ideas - click on the relevant project icon to get instructions.     all the very best

These people basically live in their trucks, stopping at the larger fuel repositories to shower, fuel up, and eat, sometimes hooking up to air conditioning or heat overnight so they can shut down the engine, and sleep......  In the truck.    There are Arabs, blacks, Indios, Whites, Fat and skinny men and women from all walks of life.  The main thing they have in common is they spend more time on the road than sitting still, and most of them are lonely, ready for some recognition.

These cities became depopulated due to Germanic attacks by all sorts of people like the Visigoths, Franks etc.     Also, people sought protection under a lord or someone who had arms. They sold their services for protections, that's what started feudalism basically

AA10228954	Who says the European Union is controlled by China. Is that some kind of joke?

Those that fear death, are really afraid that their total existence ends with the death of their body, their suit so to speak.    In the teaching of the Buddha, all of us will pass away eventually as a part in the natural process of birth, old-age and death and that we should always keep in mind the impermanence of life.  The life that we all cherish and wish to hold on.      To Buddhism, however, death is not the end of life, it is merely the end of the body we inhabit in this life, but our spirit will still remain and seek out through the need of attachment, attachment to a new body and new life. Where they will be born is a result of the past and the accumulation of positive and negative action, and the resultant karma (cause and effect) is a result of ones past actions.      This would lead to the person to be reborn in one of 6 realms which are; heaven, human beings, Asura, hungry ghost, animal and hell.  Realms, according to the severity of ones karmic actions, Buddhists believe however, none of these places are permanent and one does not remain in any place indefinitely. So we can say that in Buddhism, life does not end, merely goes on in other forms that are the result of accumulated karma. Buddhism is a belief that emphasizes the impermanence of lives, including all those beyond the present life.  With this in mind we should not fear death as it will lead to rebirth.      The fear of death stemmed from the fear of cease to be existent and losing ones identity and foothold in the world.  We see our death coming long before its arrival, we notice impermanence in the changes we see around us and to us in the arrival of aging and the suffering due to losing our youth.  Once we were strong and beautiful and as we age, as we approach our final moments of life  we realize how fleeting such a comfortable place actually was.|`|AA11811740	I think I would flip out at first cuz I'm too young to die lol but I'll eventually calm down cuz there's nothing you can do about and panicking isn't going to help. I do fear death and I think the reason why is that I don't know what's going to happen afterwards cuz I'm agnostic. Maybe if I knew for sure, then I wouldn't be as scared and maybe even die happily. I guess it's just a scary thought that my existence in this body is going to end. But I do find the whole concept of reincarnation interesting...it feels reassuring knowing that when you die it's not the end of life, just ur life in a certain era.|`|RUmNeAqYaa	we all die eventually  i would be calm|`|83gqYA9paa	If I was going to die in 10 minutes...I think I would be calm.

z36j8rmRaa	Unless a writer is a big name and even if they are...they have very little to no say in the cover art of their books.  Not even the editor has a say.  There is a wonderful group of people who understand marketing very, very well and know just how a book cover should be done.  Likewise the title of the book.  That is also marketing.  The author has a "working title" but usually the title is changed for publication because, the brilliant people in marketing also know how to sell a book by choosing the best title.    Great Question!|`|XFZmAMOAaa	Writers and publishers colaborate on cover art.the more your published,the more input you get on cover art.|`|cHxaWW0taa	The authors always have the final say.|`|2V8XEKNJaa	Writers have some input but most likely the publishers get the final say.

Get in all the school plays, look for an acting studio where you can take professional classes. Michigan is not a great place to become an actor,though Chicago is if you happen to be nearby.  It doesn't pay enough to be an extra if you have to drive more than two or three hours to get to the gig. Finally, the only way teens become actors is if there parents work very hard to make it happen for them. That is how it happens. Period.
9HCypvHJaa	It doesn't go with Twilight, because Paramore wrote it before they even knew it was going to be in the Twilight movie. But I love that song, and Paramore in general! :)|`|SCQphK96aa	i agree with you, the song is so amazing but i feel like its a mixture of both new moon and twilight    let me explain    "How can I decide what's right  When you're clouding up my mind?  I can't win your losing fight  All the time."   i believe this part represents new moon when she's always doing reckless things and can't decide how she really feels about jacob because edwards presence is always in her heart    "Nor can I ever own what's mine  When you're always taking sides  But you won't take away my pride.  No, not this time.  Not this time."  this represents both i think, the fact that edward is always on his side about bella becoming a vampire and yet he wants to be on her side and keep her happy but bella cant deny what she really wants    "How did we get here?  Well, I used to know you so well.  But how did we get here?  Well, I think I know."  and the chorus shows how when edward left in new moon. how lost bella was without him and how she thought he would never leave, like he promised her.    "The truth is hiding in your eyes  And it's hanging on your tongue.  Just boiling in my blood.  But you think that I can't see  What kind of man that you are,  If you're a man at all.  Well, I will figure this one out  On my own.  (I'm screaming, "I love you so.")  On my own.  (My thoughts you can't decode)"  This represents twilight mostly because edward cant read bellas mind and she believes edward is as human as any other human, he is a man despite edward feeling like he's a monster    "Do you see what we've done?  We've gone and made such fools   Of ourselves.  Do you see what we've done?  We've gone and made such fools  Of ourselves."  i feel like this represent the whole saga, just how their love for each other makes them do crazy things    "There is something I see in you.  It might kill me.  I want it to be true."  This i actually think is best displayed in eclipse bella mentions that she wants edwards venom to take her over, she feels that if its her vemon poisoning her system than its the ultimate way to show that she is truely his forever despite the fact he could kill her trying|`|5f69hQT2aa	They both suck and are closely affiliated with whiney females?|`|3WCXGRaGaa	Its for the movie...

I guess those lines you mentioned are it.|`|z20d4fI1aa	Good song, but true it doesn't go too well with it...|`|oboe5c4Waa	it doesnt. i was so sad paramore put their name on that crappy movie/book. They wrote it before the movie even came out|`|i4SVk2Cpaa	its for the movie, not the book.|`|SsqgfaNiaa	I think it has an underlying message for how their whole relationship is throughout the whole saga...  --  Twilight = "If you're a man at all. I will figure this one out on my own. My thoughts you can't decode."  Referring to the fact he's a vampire and that he can't read her mind.  --  New Moon = "How did we get here? I used to know you so well. There is something I see in you. It might kill me. I want it to be true."   Referring to the fact that he left her even though they were going strong and she doesn't understand why he thought it was protecting her. Also referring to the point that she loves him but because he is trying to over-protect her it might kill her if he leaves again.  --    Eclipse = "The truth is hiding in your eyes. And it's hanging on your tongue. Just boiling in my blood."  Referral to her choice to become a vampire and even though he knows deep down it's probably better for her and he wants to be with her forever his over-protective side doesn't want to hurt her or take her away from the people she loves.  --    Breaking Dawn = "Do you see what we've done? We've gone and made such fools of ourselves." Referral to their stupidity in arguing over her change into a vampire because everything turned out fine in the end.    But all that is just my opinion. That could be totally wrong in someone else's eyes. :)|`|ISnGWFDzaa	Because Bella knows that Edward isn't human, but she can't figure out what he is, and she loves him anyway. It makes perfect sense with the book    How can I decide what's right  When you're clouding up my mind?  I can't win your losing fight  All the time.  (He dazes her so she can't think)    Nor can I ever own what's mine  When you're always taking sides  But you won't take away my pride.  No, not this time.  Not this time.  (When he ignores her)    How did we get here?  Well, I used to know you so well.  But how did we get here?  Well, I think I know.  (When she figures out he's not human)    The truth is hiding in your eyes  And it's hanging on your tongue.  Just boiling in my blood.

mnIeK8q6aa	He lost the confidence of just about everybody completely. The emperor had no choice to ask for political asylum in The Netherlands (which was neutral during that war). His niece, queen Wilhelmina, granted him asylum. Much to the dislike of the allies, notably Belgium.     However, it did solve a nasty problem: putting the emperor on trial for war crimes. The times simply weren't right for something like that. So after a bit of shouting, they let the (now ex-)empeor be, without stressing their point.     The emperor was given a mansion in Doorn. He lived quietly and died there in 1941. Long enough to see Germany overrun The Netherlands. He wasn't fond of the Nazis, and the feelings were mutual. He wasn't buried in Germany on his request, but on the estate of the Doorn mansion.|`|eef0fd7a18ed1e8ac453b6086f666edfaa	He lost control, had to abdicate his throne.

It all started when Colonel Klink smoked all of Orville Redenbacher's weed. That pissed off Orville so he called his buddy Colonel Sanders and a few more friends and formed a posse to go kick Klink's as~s.  Before Orville and his posse could get out of the US to Germany, Sanders got busted for possession. Orville got really pissed off because he found out that the snitch was an illegal immigrant. Sanders gave Redenbacher the name of someone to get him out of the county jail, Tupac Shakur. Tupac came into the jail and popped a bunch of caps and busted Sanders out.  After the jail break, they all managed to get out of the US and on their way to Germany to kick Klink's as~s. When they arrived in Germany, they were surprised by Klink with a posse of his own, which included Richard Simmons. It was a bloody fight, with Simmons being taken out by a flying as~s plug and Klink stabbing himself in the neck with a steak knife.  The whole situation was blown out of proportion and quickly escalated into what we now know as WWI.  I hope this was helpful in your quest.|`|ZbnVjxQOaa	The Kaiser had little or no leadership abilities, he basically abdicated all war planning to the General Staff,  von Molke in particular prior to the war, Ludendorf and Hindenberg after the war started. He approved plans but did not make them.    At the end of the war, when seeking an Armistice, German political leaders were told to get rid of the Kaiser so the Kaiser abdicated the throne, fleeing to Holland a week or so before the Armistice. Holland allowed him in because he had not violated their neutrality and involved them in the war.    Many of Hitler's backers were monarchists who believed that he would restore the Kaiser to power, even if in name only. Hitler and the Nazis did not want the competition so the Kaiser was left in exile until the end of his life in 1941.

Sometimes people chose strong colours because they look nice, but with time it gets tiresome to one's sight.  If you make combinations, remember that complementaries (opposite colours on the colour wheel) make stronger complements, while adjacent colours make softer transitions.  I've painted my bathroom with light mint green and light peachy orange for the walls and white for the ceiling.  However I wouldn't use this combination for a bedroom.

It has faithfully waited seven years for me to call upon it.  A mound of dust bunnies loitering over the top of it seems as if they had been breeding just as long.  I grabbed everything in sight, stuffing it haphazardly, hardly daring to breath the scent of freedom.  "I'm really going this time.  I'm really going..."       Bring me into your mind without over explaining what you are doing.  I know when you say that you are "grabbed everything in site.." that you meant to stuff it into the suitcase.  Give the reader credit.  For example, when someone says the phone rings, I know that they have to GO to the phone, PICK it up with their HAND and PUT it to their EAR.

I'd spend a little more on the D60 over the D40, just for the megapixels & processor as a beginner.

C77c0OE2aa	Unfortunately, blur is one thing that cannot be corrected in photo editing software. NO software can do this, regardless of what anyone may tell you. A blurred digital photo is comprised of pixels that have captured and recorded this off focus information as correct. Software cannot make something out of nothing. It all thinks this is a perfect photo. There is no "hidden" sharpness there to "find". Software cannot focus your camera for you. It would be the same as taking a photo of a person with a piece of cardboard over their face, then expecting photo editing software to be able to remove the cardboard and display the face. It just does not work that way. The photo is what it is. Remove the cardboard and there is nothing there... there is no face hiding behind the cardboard in the photo. Same with a blurred photo... there is no sharpness data there, and software is not going to magically create it.    Post editing software is not the end all, cure all for all poorly taken photos. It is still, and always will be, important to get the photo correct in the camera in the beginning. Software can help improve some things and even create the illusion of more sharpness... BUT... there still has to be good, basic, sharp image data in the beginning.    steve|`|g8kIjpwSaa	This will make it a little better, but don't get your hopes up.    Filter > Sharpen > Unsharp Mask.

The main political divide in Northern Ireland is between Unionists who wish to see Northern Ireland continue as part of the United Kingdom and Nationalists /Republicans who wish to see Northern Ireland rejoin the rest of Ireland, independent from the United Kingdom. Unionists are overwhelmingly Protestant, descendants of mainly Scottish, English, Welsh and Huguenot settlers and indigenous Irishmen who had converted to one of the Protestant denominations, while Nationalists are predominantly Catholic and descend from the population predating the settlement, with a minority from Scottish Highlanders as well as some converts from Protestantism. Discrimination against nationalists under the Stormont government (19211972) gave rise to the nationalist civil rights movement in the 1960s. Some Unionists argue that any discrimination was not just because of religious or political bigotry, but also the result of more complex socio-economic, socio-political and geographical factors. Whatever the cause, the existence of discrimination, and the manner in which Nationalist anger at it was handled, was a major contributing factor which led to the long-running conflict known as the Troubles. In general, Unionists consider themselves British (or "Ulstermen") and Nationalists see themselves as Irish, though these identities are not necessarily mutually exclusive.The violence was characterised by the armed campaigns of paramilitary groups, including the Provisional IRA campaign of 1969-1997 which was aimed at the end of British rule in Northern Ireland and the creation of a new "all-Ireland" or "thirty-two county", Irish Republic, and the Ulster Volunteer Force, formed in 1966 in response to the perceived erosion of both the British character and unionist domination of Northern Ireland. On 28 July 2005, the Provisional IRA declared an end to its campaign and has since decommissioned what is thought to be all of its arsenal, performed in accordance with the Belfast Agreement of 1998, and under the watch of the International Decommissioning Body and two external church witnesses.|`|iag5pVJSaa	Britans' origional invasion of Ireland was to expand the British empire, although true British interference started after the English Reformation, when questions over the loyalty of Irish vassals provided the initial impetus for a series of military campaigns between 1534 and 1691.    oh, and Lord Britian is wrong, for even at that time people kind of resented invading forces.

Scholars who write about history are called historians. It is a field of research which uses a narrative to examine and analyze the sequence of events, and it often attempts to investigate objectively the patterns of cause and effect that determine events. Historians debate the nature of history and the lessons history teaches. A famous quote by George Santayana has it that "Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it."The stories common to a particular culture, but not supported by external sources (such as the legends surrounding King Arthur) are usually classified as cultural heritage rather than the "disinterested investigation" needed by the discipline of history.|`|tI7QP3dkaa	History is about what happened 5 min ago,  1 hour ago,  yesterday, last week, years and centuries ago.

The more exposures you use, the larger the file will be, which will increase processing time - my typical 3 exposure HDR files end up as 50+ meg TIFF's when I'm done with them (10 mp RAW exposures processed at 32 bit) - on the other end of the coin, the more exposures you use, the broader the dynamic range will be after the final image is processed.  Spacing your exposures can be tricky as well, but I try to space them at least 1 EV apart - or one stop bracketing.|`|j5Apt8hWaa	There is no magic number.  It really depends upon the lighting ratio in the scene.  If there are only four stops, three exposures will be enough, but huge ratios will require more ... I have seen many architectural photographers use five.    I haven't tried seven, but try it ... only you can determine by doing the tests to know when to use two exposures or five.      I use a hand-held meter to determine that actual range of lighting, shadows to highlights.    Take some time and search for the HDRI websites.  There are many excellent sites and there are even some specialized HDRI programs now.

oN9GUEAEaa	I've been on stage crew for quite some time. I've had several positions and each of them was different.     It is interesting to work on a play. You get to see all the different things that go into a production from rehearsals to design to build to tech week to the final production. The excitement/fear at opening night is a great experience.    What you will do will depend on your exact role. You might be in charge of setting out the props, or moving set pieces during intermission. My favorite thing is working the light board.     I think it is fun to be on stage crew, but your experience will depend mostly on the people that you are working with and the support you get.     Work hard at it, and you can get to do more interesting things. I am in College, and I am Technical Director/Set Designer/Light Designer/Light Board Operator/Lead Technician for our show of I Hate Hamlet.     Break A Leg!!|`|Mig6O93Naa	You will do what the director assigns you to do, shift scenery, organize props, whatever is needed. Take your responsibilities seriously, the success of the show depends on you.|`|ji7WZvC1aa	There's a lot of hard work goes on, but you'll have a fantastic time.  There are quite a few different jobs, any of which you might have, some of them are:  - Lighting operator: you work the lighting desk during the show, making sure the right lights are on for each scene  - Followspot operator: when you see an actor standing in a light which moves with them, that's a followspot.  It's operated by someone who is holding the light and moving it so it stays on the actor, no matter where they go.  A lot of people think it's an easy job - it's not!  - Running crew/floor crew/deck crew/stage crew (lots of names for the same job!): you move the sets in between scenes, and make sure the stage is set up correctly for each scene, and that the set pieces which aren't being used for that particular scene are stacked right so you can get the ones you need next without any problem  - Sound operator: you run the sound board, playing any sound effects that there might be and also fading microphones up and down so that the people who are on stage can be heard, and the people who are offstage can't be heard  - Props crew: you make sure the actors have the right props for each scene, and that all the props are where they're meant to be - the first scene might call for an actor to have a glass of wine, so you have to make sure there's a wine bottle in the cupboard, with coloured water in it to represent the wine  - Wardrobe/makeup crew (sometimes called dressers): help the cast with any quick changes from one costume to another, and make sure that the costumes all look good and don't have any damage between shows    Whatever you do, give it your all (I suspect you will anyway, given that you're really excited about it!), listen to what the director and stage manager tell you, write EVERYTHING down so that you only have to be told it once, respect your actors and above all, have fun.  I started off as stage crew at school, and now I'm a stage manager in professional theatre and have worked in places like the Royal Opera House at Covent Garden in London - I love my job and am so glad I got involved at school!|`|e2wjcKgGaa	Well I have been in shows for a long time, and stage crew seems so much fun (I've never done it, but it seems fun!) Your with a bunch of people who share your passion for art, so you hang out and make a lot of new friends.  You also get to hang out with the people outside of the shows. It's a very accepting atmosphere. You will paint sets, and also move sets on and off stage. You might help with the microphones, or the lights or makeup! Good luck!!
DenLZAL1aa	BOTH SIDES;    THE ALLEGED ARMING OF LUSITANIA   Some liners, including LUSITANIA and her sister MAURETANIA, were slated for service as auxiliary cruisers in the event of war; the two Cunarders had been built under government subsidy and were designed to facilitate such conversion. There was not a secret. Both Britain and Germany converted merchant ships to armed merchant cruisers in both world wars, the Germans for use as commerce raiders and the British for use as patrol ships and convoy escort. There was nothing illegal or underhanded in the practice. Armed merchant cruisers were commissioned naval vessels, not to be confused with the defensively armed merchantmen discussed above.   Soon after the war broke out the British government decided to retain LUSITANIA in commercial passenger service, while it took over MAURETANIA, which served as a trooper and later a hospital ship. The only known major modification to LUSITANIA at this time was the deactivation of six of her twenty-five boilers, to save on coal and personnel; this reduced her top speed from 25 to 21 knots.     There are two distinct issues pertaining to LUSITANIA's carriage of munitions: the cargo of rifle cartridges and shrapnel cases, whose existence is not in dispute; and the allegations that she was carrying a larger and much more dangerous cargo of smokeless powder (guncotton). These are pertinent both to the legality of LUSITANIA's cargo and to its possible role in the second, fatal explosion following the detonation of U-20's torpedo.|`|OmSJR5UFaa	Germany initally did not sink allied merchant ships, but later took to sinking them because many carried munitions to England.    The Lusitania was a passenger ship, and the Germans sinking it outraged the United States and its allies.  This was one of several reasons why the United States decided to enter WWI.

It's hard to explain but it's about the future, after mankind basically destroyed the earth (global warming, destroying forests, polluting the ocean, etc) survivors made a new society where there's no argueing, war, etc. Everyone is considered "ugly" until they turn 16 and have this sugery that makes them "pretty" and they move to this part of town where all they do is have fun and party all day and night. Tally, the main character cant wait to turn pretty. She meets Shay who's a rebal and convinces Tally to leave the city for a night to see what's out in the wilderness. Tally learns all kinds of things about being pretty and the truth is.. it's not really pretty. EXTREMELY good, and the sequals (Pretties, Specials) are even better. It's full of adventures, cool technologies, romance, etc. There's also a fourth book from another perspective and it's set in Japan called Extras, but it's not as good as the others in my opinion.    The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins  This book is also set in the future and is extremely intense like you're actually in the book. It's setting is in Panem, a city that's now in what's left of North America (which has become smaller after global warming and melting of the ice caps). Surrounding Panem are 12 districts where each year, one boy and girl between the ages of 12 and 18 are chosen to be in the Hunger Games where they are put into an arena and battle each other and try to survive until there's only one left and is the winner. There's also romance in it and gets kind of sad. I cried at one point. haha but it's really good. Stephanie Meyers, author of Twilight, even recommended it.    Deadly Little Secrets by Laurie Stolarz  It's the first of it's series and is also really good. It's about a girl named Camelia who lives a normal life - dating, has friends, decent grades. But, one day when she was picking an earing that she dropped crossing the street, a car was coming towards her and it wasn't stopping. Suddenly, a hot guy shoves her out of the way, saving her life. He left without her saying thank you or asking what his name was. Three months later, she's starting her junior year in high school and there's this rumor about a new guy named Ben who supposedly killed his girlfriend. Camelia doesn't believe in rumors and when she sees Ben, it's the guy who saved her life. She tries to talk to him but he ignores her at first, but later Ben begins touching her weirdly but Camilia only gets more drawn to him. She later finds out he's not ordinary. He can know the future or past of a person by touching a person and he senses that Camelia's in great danger. Really intense but good with a twisted love triangle.    I've read twilight and loved it but i thought these books were almost as good or even better.|`|Vc2ObdeOaa	Hello, I'm about your age and I'm a big fan of Austen and I'm slated to read Persuasion and A Picture of Dorian Gray sometime this year. I'm currently exploring the classics.     However, I still have a long list of contemporary books that I'm hoping to read after I finish some of the classics and among those books are Life of Pi (currently reading), The Alchemist, Water for Elephants and Me Talk Pretty One Day.     Additionally, I recently finished Little Brother which was inspired by 1984, so if you enjoyed that I would suggest looking into Little Brother. It was really amazing.     Oh! And I just remembered The Friday Night Knitting Club and Knit Two were some of my trashier current reads, but they were a refreshing break from the classics, which are amazing, but can be wordy and difficult at times.     Good luck reading Persuasion and A Picture of Dorian Gray, and I hope these suggestions help. :)|`|3H71HPViaa	ok easy read but very very funny The Confesions of Gorgia Nicleson (i know spellings not my thing)
GeHrKxThaa	It depends how you use them. Some people can make graphite very smooth, but I think it takes a lot more control over the initial laying down of the pencil. I personally prefer charcoal on smooth paper. The tools you use to blend also have a great effect, as I recently wrote on my blog: http://heatherwardwildlifeart.blogspot.c...    If you want to get really smooth, apply charcoal directly to smooth paper with a chamois or paintbrush, being careful to tap off any excess powder before you touch it to the paper.|`|6TPEyJqhaa	Pencil is easier to use in my opinion.  Charcoal is smoother and softer, but it is hard to keep the page clean because it smudges really easily.|`|g8kIjpwSaa	depends on the picture you're drawing and the paper you use|`|S25mQe70aa	i have to agree with the answers above me...if you're doing something bigger charcoal is a lot easier to use but i have seen some large pencil art that looks awesome. i guess to each his own. find out what you like and go with it.|`|22247c23a55dead202cad38509a7aee0aa	i use charcoal on really big  work... cant imagine coloringa 7m x 4m canvas with grey leads!!    on small work i like the feel of pencils    on mid sized color i like to use pastels oil pastels on canvas and dry chalky pastels on other papers...    enjoy

ZXViYKaAaa	Godless without a doubt is the best book she has written.  I thought her other books were ok but not as great.  Godless has 8 points she gets across well while her other books either focus on either too many or one point.  I also enjoyed reading her trash teachers :), speaking down on darwinism, environmentalism, and nazism.  I recommend her, she is probably the funniest conservative you will ever read and its pretty easy to read her books.  That is of course you are interested in reading a conservative viewpoint.  Most people will hate her just because she is conservative.|`|BGU3VpQFaa	She's so negative I don't see how anybody can read her.  Its painful enough to watch her on interviews.

6TPEyJqhaa	It's been a year or so since I've read it but I'll tell you what I remember.  The boys try to keep a fire lit on the highest point of the island so they have a chance of being rescued.  They always refer to how important is is to keep the fire going.  In these instances the fire is a symbol for hope as long as they keep it lit.  There is also a part when they first get on the island that the fire they light gets out of hands and kills one of the boys (or that's what I think because he is never heard from again).  In the very end of the book Jack sets the whole island on fire to try to kill Ralph.  In these instances the fire is a symbol for death and distruction although that is what also saves them because a boat see's this fire.|`|xJoMSkI5aa	Fire is used in several ways in Lord of the Flies.    1. At the beginning, Ralph is determined to keep a signal fire going, in case a ship passes near to the island.   2. The boys have developed a sort of rhythm in their lives that involves the littluns playing together, some of the biguns (Jack and the choir boys) still hunting pigs, and the others (Ralph and Simon and Piggy) trying to build shelters and keep the signal fire going.  3. Ironically, it is because of a fire that Jack lights at the end of the novel - in his attempt to hunt and kill Ralph - that the boys are rescued.

She'd have bright red rainboots that were a bit too large for her and look like they'd squeak on the floor if she dipped inside one of the shops lining the streets.  She'd have a bright red rubber hat on to keep the rain from getting her hair wet, but she'd be soaked anyway.  and she'd be jumping in a puddle and laughing and catching the rain in her hands.|`|YMJJJ1xraa	I would draw a wolf like okami|`|VtSy6CKraa	I would draw another Jon Gnagy drawing!

ZaFreVDhaa	I'm assuming you mean how to mix plaster since it's impossible to make plaster unless you're a trained chemist.    to Mix plaster add water a little bit at a time and mix it until it resembles waffle batter. (you can also add less water and make it like pancake batter, but you'll get more bubbles.)    Don't dawdle; plaster has a working time time of 15-30 minutes, lees if the water's hot.     It sounds like yours might be quick setting plaster; if so, you need it like thick pancake batter and you're working time will be less then 10 minutes.    Pour the thick plaster into the mold and give the containor a shake untill it self levels. now it's ready to use.|`|9adfd40573a5f8454356f9c074106d83aa	Ordinary plaster is 2 parts plaster powder to 1 part water, normally by weight, but you can usually get away with volume.  It works best if the plaster is sprinkled on the water or shaken with a strainer so all the particles get wet.  Adding plaster this way, you keep adding till a mound of plaster forms in the center. Let it sit for a couple of minutes to soak in the water, then stir it for a short time to smooth it out.  You should be able to touch it with your finger and leave a slight dent or pull a peak. If not, then add a bit more plaster and stir it not too vigorously.  When ready pour it into to the tray and have your dog ready. Push the paw into the plaster and pull it out and if mixed right, it will leave an impression which you can leave to harden.  If not, you can try putting the paw back in.   Clean all the plaster off the paw and between the toes - it isn't comfortable.|`|g8kIjpwSaa	You can get plaster powder from Home Depot....Menards....Lowes, then just add water.

062dcebc0cae227b915e6808bf0dcd18aa	Fotoace nailed it - your images are dark because they are under-exposed.    Exposure is a result of mainly 3 factors:    (1) Shutter speed  (2) Aperture  (3) ISO setting    The faster the shutter speed is, the lesser light allowed in to the sensor.   The smaller the aperture (larger f number), the lesser the light on the sensor. For ex: f/22 lets in 4 times less light than f/11.  The higher the ISO number, the higher the sensitivity of the sensor. ISO800 is much more sensitive to light than ISO 100.    You should tweak all three above settings to get the optimal exposure. If you go manual - which I suspect you did - the camera assumes your settings are correct. If the image is under/over-exposed there is little point in blaming the camera.     You checked your shutter speed but did you check on your aperture? guess it is preset for something like f/16 or f/22? If you go manual you should set all 3 above settings, not just the shutter speed.    Use auto setting to ensure the camera is functioning properly. Then use aperture priority mode and set the ISO as you go along.|`|MG6TyR4Uaa	Hi there,    Don't worry, getting used to your first DSLR can be tricky. There are a lot of things to remember and figure out but it will become second nature after awhile.     Are you shooting manual? If so make sure to keep an eye on your on the meter under your shutter speed and the aperture setting. It's a line with a plus and minus at each end. When adjusting your speed and aperture (f stop), try to keep it towards the middle as much as possible. Then you'll start to notice what aperture and what shutter speeds work well together.     My suggestion, try shooting in Aperture Priority for awhile. All you have to worry about is the aperture setting. I know you asked about that so it sounds like your not quite sure what it's for.   A quick and dirty explanation is that the aperture is the opening that lets the light into the camera. The bigger the hole, the more light. Here's the kicker, the smaller the number, the bigger the hole. Just remember small number = more light let in.   Play around with your aperture and notice the shutter speeds your camera gives you. This will help you out when you use your manual settings.   Oh yeah, don't forget about you ISO setting. Think back to film, that kind of helped me out. 400 film was a good all around, 100 for bright, 800 for lower light, and so on. Same with ISO.    Hmm, hope that helps. The D60 is a awesome camera and you will love it when you get everything figured out. You'll be amazed at the quality of images you will be able to get with such a compact camera.|`|uJBnZWtcaa	Uh, yeah,  the aperture lets the light in.    btw, last I heard taking pictures of the sun can fry the camera's sensor.    Why not use the some of the auto settings until you figure out how the camera works???|`|j5Apt8hWaa	You are under exposing the images .. it doesn't matter which camera you are using ... the combination of shutter speed, f/stop and ISO determines if you are going to expose your image correctly.      Are you using aperture priority?  Shutter speed priority?.    As long as you use your light meter correctly, your exposures will be perfect.|`|f9dnldJraa	It sounds like you are using a digital camera.  I have the same problem with all 5 previous cameras I've owned.  Digital cameras for some reason can not be treated like the old 35 mm.  I have noticed that while using the flash, the immediate area is lit up in front of the camera but blinds out what is further away. Items close up also get whited out by the flash. making either dark or extremely white pictures. I don't know exactly why but you can correct this by turning off your flash. You'll just have to hold the camera still for a few seconds due to the extra time the camera needs to get the exposure. I have taken pictures this way in really dark environments that wind up getting pictures that look like they are actually lit up some how. It seems to brighten proportionally and it will not look as dark as it appears with your eyes. However, If you dont hold the camera still long enough you will get a smeared appearance to your pictures.|`|k7MINvaIaa	So you need to get the fundamentals mastered... you can bet that the 'aperture has something to do with it'. As you lower the number you are increasing the amount of light that enters the camera to make the image. I assume you are using the camera in manual mode. You can use aperture priority mode which allows you to choose the aperture setting and the camera will pick an appropriate shutter speed. Shutter priority allows you to choose the shutter speed and the camera will choose an appropriate aperture setting. This is a simplification obviously, but you ought to play with these settings. One of the best ways to improve is to take a class at your local community college or a local workshop.|`|8Dr3ofEeaa	maybe the flash is off?|`|Sxi39m9Naa	The smaller the aperture (bigger number), the less light goes into the camera. The bigger the aperture (small number) the more light goes in, therefore the brighter the picture will be.     Also, check your ISO rating; this is the sensitivity of the film (or sensor) to light. The more sensitive it is to light (higher ISO), the brighter the picture will be.  And, like you know, the shutter speed affects the brightness.     Shutter speed, aperture, and ISO are the three main things you should be focusing on. If you know how to work those well you'll know exactly what you're doing every time you take a picture.

This airflow produced a kind of shrieking noise that got louder as the dive increased the speed and the plane got nearer the ground.    They weren't very efficient bombers, though; only carried one bomb, not especially large, and were slow and easy to shoot down. Scared the crap out of people, though.|`|E70A7aqcaa	The only WWII plane that I know that had a "siren" on it (and it wasn't really a siren) was the Stouka (sp?) dive bomber of the Nazis, and it was only a sound resulting from the wind passing by the dive bomber as it descended upon its target.  Once the Nazis realized the sound effect that was a part of their dive bomber, and the fear it brought upon it's intended victims, they just let it be so that it would continue to evoke terror upon its intended victims.  God Bless you.|`|mnIeK8q6aa	The JU 87 'Stuka'. The sirens were operated by wind, and (nick?)named 'the trombones of Jericho".

What I think you are referring to is the whining noise the Luftwaffe planes made when they went into a nose-dive during a bombing raid. The Stuka's flew at a very high altitude until they reached their targets, usually to avoid the ack-ack guns as we called them, and the searchlights. From personal experience as a child during the war they were very frightening because they often appeared out of nowhere, and then bombs and bullets would fly in all directions. At home we ran indoors immediately, and at school the teacher would shout "Down!" and we sheltered under our desks. Sometimes the Luftwaffe flew so low we could see the pilots in the cockpits, and we used to stick two fingers up at them.

Since most of the teen actors on TV and in movies started out working in theater, it's a great place to find out if he has talent and is actually interested in the craft of acting, rather than having people pay attention to him.  Most kids only want to be stars, but the ones who'll go to the trouble of becoming actors actually have a shot at future work.    If the classes go well, the kid can audition for local productions and gain experience that way.  After he's appeared in a few shows, he'll have the material he needs for a resume and can look for an agent who might be able to find paid work for him.  Since lots of movies and TV shows shoot on location, casting agents often contact local theaters to find candidates for extra and supporting roles.  So if the kid is already involved in theater, he'll know about auditions that aren't open to the public.      Basically, the kid should know that building a career is a process.  Actors are people who act, not people who are on television and in movies.  If he's serious about becoming an actor, rather than a celebrity, he'll learn everything he can through involvement in theater, since that's the foundation.  If he has the talent and commitment required to do that, he may be able to break into film in the future.  But unless the kids he sees on TV got their jobs through showbiz connections, they've already paid their dues in theater.  That's the best place for most kids to start.|`|Mig6O93Naa	nowhere, there are no jobs for inexperienced, untrained teens  if this kid wants to be a teen actor, his parents will have to make it happen, because that is how it happens and that is only how.  people cannot enter into a contract unless they are 18 or older.

3g3SCnDDaa	There are so many flaws with your question I don't even know where to begin. First of all, I must point out that there is no "Other World", to claim so is to insinuate that countries like Russia and China are on some other planet, and therefore should be regarded as enemies. Of course many countries hold individual flaws, but then America has many as well. We dwell on the same planet, as much as other people would like to think otherwise. If your term is entirely rhetorical, then again I would have to question your logic, if not your sanity. First off, Russia, China, N. Korea and Iran should not even be lumped into the same phrase when you are speaking of your "other world". The Cold War has ended more or less, countries like Russia and China have since given up on arms races or military proxy wars. Ideologically, they are roughly similar to the rest of the world. Both countries have capitalist economies for the most part, and have cooperated with what the rest of the world in regards to many issues. N. Korea is stuck in the Cold War atmosphere, but that's their choice. I highly doubt N. Korea has the power to alter world politics, aside from possibly invading S. Korea again. And Iran, is simple a country that can be reasoned with. The country has already said that it is willing to talk. Now, with all that said, you seem to think that these countries would attack the United States. On what grounds to you even begin to base that idea? Russia has not the power to invade, nor does it want to. The same goes for China, N. Korea, and Iran. China is too economically tied to the United States, and we to it. N. Korea only lashes out at the United States for the purpose of keeping its population under control, and also to make sure it remains a priority for the United States. Iran wouldn't dare attack, to do so would mean chaos. All of these countries lack the power, or simply the interest in attacking us. Now to the root of your question. You don't like Obama. That's the general message I'm getting here. For that sole reason, I am tempted to believe that this is solely a rant, and therefore of little importance. You don't really believe that these countries would do anything, you just enjoy mocking the president every chance you get. Well, that is the concept of free speech, so go on ahead, even though I disagree with what you are saying. Obama has so far proven to be a fine president, and I wish him the best. Peace!    [Edit]-2000 years ago China, Russia, N. Korea and Iran didn't even exist, much like the rest of the world. There were no countries. Good try, though.|`|gWleYSuIaa	Those four countries are not to be lumped in the same group and the USA is not going to disarm.|`|1NPVVxW0aa	What do you mean the 'other world'? Why on earth would Obama disolve all the military forces of America?     If you mean not spending billions of tax payers dollars on munitions to invade places like Iraq or Afghanistan as 'disarming', then that's...weird but the closest I can get to what you mean?     Do you think China is about to invade the USA (their biggest customer in a fast growing power economy) due to a shortage of newer NCB weapons??? Or Russia? North Korea is an international joke and we are currently invading every country around Iran (is this disarming?).
Vc2ObdeOaa	Wow, this could nearly be a description for who I was when I was 13. I played bass, although not in a band, and I had a black belt in Tae Kwon Do. Anyway, I wasn't that great at either of the two different activities, respectably decent, but not great enough to pursue the two activities any further beyond the age of 14.     However, I did know a girl who was in a similar position as I was, she had brown layered hair was about 5'4", half white, half Mexican and was pretty. No picture of her would be on the Internet, although I think that's a pretty good fit of someone who could be a bass player and a black belt.     By the way, are you a black belt in Tae Kwon Do, or are you just including that to make McKenzie/Mikayla sporty? I've known both and McKenzie and Mikayla, and to offer my two cents, Mikayla--who went by Kayla--was quite a good lot more sporty than the other. Additionally, Tae Kwon Do, if you don't already know, focuses a lot on discipline. Just something to include in your story.     Hope this helps.|`|z36j8rmRaa	Try the link below.

A6D0OkD7aa	This is the simplest way to do it, the possibilities are endless.    1. Draw a rectangle  2. Draw a line that is diagonal; one end starts at the top left corner of the rectangle and extends outward. Then draw another line, parallel to the first, that starts at the top right corner and extends outward. Make both lines the same length. Your 3rd line will start at the lower right corner, extend outward, and be both parallel to the first two lines. All three lines NEED to be the exact same length AND be parallel.  3. Connect the ends of those first two lines. This line that connects them should be parallel to the top line of the rectangle. Draw another line that connects lines 2 and 3 at their ends. It should be parallel to the right side of your rectangle.    http://www.flashandmath.com/advanced/sim...|`|5a2w82vGaa	To make it perfectly rectangular... rule a line, then use a protractor at each end and mark 90 degrees.

ONE more point here - make sure that the lines you draw that are parallel to each other are the same length. YOU must make the opposite parallel lines the same length and either longer or shorter then the other set of parallel lines or it is not going to be a rectangle.   and DONE!|`|kahHs1rMaa	the same way you would make a squre but longer on the bottom or top|`|BQTLa4Sgaa	I first draw a rectangle.

If you haven't tried it before it might look complicated, so just draw one step at a time.    First, draw your horizon line across the middle of the page horizontally. Mark two points (vanishing points) as far apart as possible one on the far left of the horizon (horizontal) line, and one on the far right.    Draw a short vertical line for the front corner of your box (the black line in the picture) and then draw a construction line ('orthogonal') from the top and bottom of the line, to each vanishing point (the dark blue lines).    Next draw a vertical line to the left of your 'front corner', between the top and bottom construction lines (the magenta line). From the top and bottom points of this line, draw construction lines back to the RIGHT vanishing point (VP2). Next, draw a similar vertical line to the right of your 'front corner', and from the top and bottom points of this line, draw construction lines back to the LEFT vanishing point (VP1).    Where the top construction lines intersect, drop a vertical line to the intersection of the bottom construction lines - this will give you the back corner of the box (the green line).    Erase the construction lines and any interior lines (unless it's a fishtank!)

AA12343309	My answer is lengthy and I apologize for that but I want to warn you of the advantages and the pitfalls of genealogy on the internet.    Websites that only have family trees are not worth a plug nickel unless you are willing to verify the information with documents/records. They are subscriber submitted, very seldom documented and if they are they are poorly documented. You frequently will see the different info on the same people from different subscribers. Then you will see the absolute same info on the same people from different subscribers but you would be very foolish if you thought for one moment that that means it is correct. A lot of people copy without verifying. The information can be useful as clues only as to where to get the documentation.    I recently found I was dead. So was my sister and my brother-in-law. We died in New Jersey. Since the only time my sister and I were ever in New Jersey is when our family drove through it coming from New York in 1956. Hey! we've been dead for 52 years. It says so on the internet. It has to be right if it is on the internet!    I found out that family on both sides married and died in New Jersey. Since my ancestry is mostly southern American colonial with some exceptions and those exceptions came in through southern ports, I was surprised.    This tree would have been accepted by any genealogy website. You can make up an entirely fictitious family tree and it will be accepted. You disagree with something someone has on one of your family members, the websites will tell you that it is between you and the other subscriber.    Now the best for the total amount of records online isn't free but your public library might have a subscription to it. That is Ancestry.Com. Still be careful about the information in their family trees.     Cyndi'sList.com is a website with links to many other websites, some free and some not. Many people involved in genealogy find it helpful.     Not all records are online but the ones you will find will save you time and money traveling to courthouses, libraries etc.    However your first free source is your own family. Get information from them. Tape your senior members if they will let you. People who do this state they go back and listen to the tape again after doing research and hear things they didn't hear the first time around. I am not saying they won't be confused or wrong on some things.    Find out if anybody in your family has any old family bibles. Ask to see and make copies of birth, marriage and death certificates. Depending on the religious faith, baptismal, first communion, confirmation and marriage certificates from their church can be helpful.     A good free source is a Family History Center at a Latter Day Saints(Mormon) Church. They have records on people all over the world, not just Mormons. In Salt Lake City, they have the world's largest genealogical collection. Their FHCs can order microfilm for you to view at a nominal fee.     They won't try to convert you, at least they haven't done so to me or anyone else that I know.|`|05bddf168eeb3e8ae67ab005844309abaa	There are 400,000 free genealogy sites. They provide the data, you do the research. Write to me via my profile if you'd like links.|`|rqFbNhAGaa	the only way to know that is by tree tracing and searching immigration records of the individuals|`|e61b6f14e6d908535f36e113ec589f3caa	do you have a genealogy library near where you are? if not go to your local county or city library and see if they can refer to where you get more detailed info that you are looking for|`|7ONKVbbiaa	a family tree on any site is only as good as the infomation (and proof) that it has. If it says the ancestor was born in Italy and immigrated to the US, and there is proof of this.. nothing wrong with it.  There ARE family trees online that are not well researched and have mistakes.   Unless YOU have the research yourself, then you don't know who the ancestor was, or where he/she came from. You have to work from yourself, backwards, using records.. without that, you really are just guessing if someone is your gr gr grandfather, or just some guy with the same name as yours. That is not proof of anything.   You don't need a website for genealogy or tracing your family. The records existed long before any computer, the internet or websites.|`|U0ouUrQBaa	I understand what you mean, when I started my tree it was as much about tracking where my surname started as it was at finding long lost family members.    Have a look at http://www.familysearch.org    this is one of the site I like to use, you can find where there are groups of people with your surname, it may not answer your question but might just give you a starting point.

(since the material universe is darkness how can it produce light/consciousness?)     but it's easy to see how darkness is simply the absence of light.|`|8yE2sYGeaa	Darkness wins, but darkness is not always a bad thing.    Not all darkness is evil, but in the end, it is all dark|`|amcqJkWhaa	Maybe there is such thing as a mix between good and evil.   An animal, I guess, doesn't posess the self-awareness or self-consciousness that humans do... but if you look at their behavoir, you can single out some instances when they seem to be really self-sacrificing or when they help humans... then you can also, certainly, be disgusted or horrofied sometimes, too... such as when one bug attaches itself to a mosquito egg, then when the mosquito lands down on an human, the attached bug then switches off to the human, burrowing itself in the human's skin and nesting there until it's ready to be born, and then comes out...    You certainly don't treat animals the same way as humans, because they have an irrational way about them... and perhaps, humans also have an irrational way about them, too. But you can learn some 'laws of nature' from animals... Ah, well. The thing is, good and evil are concepts, and without concepts, nature would still live on the way it does. So I guess it would be good if you learned about how nature has always been, or something. I guess, it is true, what is the meaning of a flower? Of a parasite? Or an eagle?   You can find out the way it works, what benefits are got from it, how it takes away from other things, about the pain and the suffering... but not the meaning... perhaps the spirit of it, but...   I think, with our effort to find out meaning and all that, really, if we could experience a sense of LIFE in our lives, then, it wouldn't matter...    So, I don't really think there is much of a battle. Lots of stories can be said to teach us about nature... But I suppose, love is the greatest soldier of them all...|`|O15my3olaa	On a micro scale, on Earth, i would say that both are somewhat equal and essential. Neither prevails over the other -- as in night and day and the clever use  of light and shadow in photography and other visual arts, where they are controllable. Just a couple of examples.    On a macro scale, i think that Time will be infinite and there is no 'in the end' situation when everything stops in the observable Universe, or even outside it. First the darkness, followed by the Big Bang with lots of light, then a possible Big Crunch when the Universe contracts and darken, and then another Big Bang again, with the cycle repeating itself. One may say that dark holes and dark energy may overcome the brightness of stars and galaxies when they consume them, but after some time, the extreme gravity can also cause them to enter into a Big Bang phase when light dominates. One can only safely say that the amount of dark matter or energy in the Universe is greater than that of lightness, perhaps >95%.|`|Wi0LBsVbaa	It can vary, but they both take a bow, at curtain call, and get equal credit in the bill.|`|ZhKYHRqpaa	haha....then why should i be die die die die so hard to be good at all times leh? hahaha not because i wanted to....but it's a must to be good. hahaha....but why? paid me then i tell u lor. all pple are hired 2 talk only a fool talks for free. hahaa unless it is for my elva hsiao, then case is different story liao lor. hahahaha hahaha hahahha    WHY I DIE DIE DIE OSO 1 2 BE GOOD LEH? hahaahah haahahha|`|380b53c18cfb9588bad18dd0f231a984aa	"Paths of Light and Darkness," Mark Prophet,  "Hope of the Wicked," Ted Flynn,  "Expecting Adam," Martha Beck, and  "The Great Divorce," C.

v7Wflu78aa	I wish I had thought of this answer myself:  We have a hard time believing that cataclysmic or enormous events have either simple causes, or causes way to complex for us to understand.    But, we do understand that there is something huge that makes us hungry for an explanation.  This opens up the mind to accept a conspiracy hypothesis, which, in some human minds, becomes a conspiracy theory.    The mind's desire to find a cause is a very useful tool, but it's over-eager, hence conspiracy theories fill in the void.|`|w74qWx0raa	The clock work apple.............nice name ,haha    Idk but I guess it just makes you feel informed and aware of whats real.

That would just make you have hope for something amazing happening instead of your whole life just being normal. Wife ,kids , make money , ya know. Maybe theres something out there more.

Is this just what you observe? Truthfully, people may find conspiracies appealing because they are USUALLY involve ethical dilemmas of some sort. Knowing the justification of the conspiracy (e.g. attorney general's illegally selling stock via a climatic scheme because not doing so would have caused detriment x,y,z with detriment x,y,z being the predisposition for the conspiracy) or, otherwise; that is, people like chastising the conspiracy for its lack of ethical consideration.     Also, societies often use conspiracies to set standards of right and wrong (e.g. case law).|`|XFnHshOMaa	Well with conspiracy theories there is a sort of pseudo-scholarship going on. But the force things together that really have no relationship. They are often very biased politically, seems like they all have the same group to blame in the end.

KBBonf97aa	Probably the best thing you can do is persuade your cousin never to be alone with the teacher and to report any perverted behavior he exhibits to her parents.  The parents can then take the issue to the principal and the school board, who are more likely to take action once adults are involved.    Sadly, teachers' unions instinctinvely protect the worst members.  But the greater the number of people who report the problem, the less school officials will be able to ignore it.  Where there's smoke, there's usually fire.    One of my high school teachers was also a perverted creep who even sprayed a girl's shirt with a fire extinguisher on one occasion and claimed it was an accident.  He was reported numerous times, but it took years before he was pulled from the classroom and even longer before his employment was terminated.  But when word spread about his inappropriate behavior, girls at least knew to avoid him like a plague.  There's safety in numbers.|`|Aask8llDaa	He should be reported to the board of education.  No teacher should take advantage of his or her position in that way and get by with it!  If enough of the students will come forward the board will surely listen.  I know its scary b/c you don't want him to take revenge on anyone, but he should be stopped before something really bad happens.
lRq81lu7aa	What I do is let it dry overnight *before* I paint.  It does also work better if you do put her name on it while the clay is still wet/soft.

Wi0LBsVbaa	Why feel guilty? There is suffering and there is happiness, there is rain and there is sunshine. Everything passes, nothing is a permanent state. The more you have the more you have to lose. If your being happy is not causing suffering, then why feel guilty? Is anothers suffering made less, by your not being happy?  If guilt does not come from a need for repentance, then it is illogical, and is a symptom of a deeper feeling of being unworthy of happiness, which is also illogical, Something as free to children as happiness, cannot require something done, to make one worthy of it. It is natural like sunshine on flowers, do they question their worthiness?|`|In4WJAnRaa	you're not feeling guilty about others being unhappy, you're feeling guilty for whatever bad thing you did to someone who you think made them unhappy.|`|nGyOmjPsaa	It's feeling the assumed pain of someone else.  It's normal but at the same time not too healthy if extensive.  We are social beings and hate to see our brothers in pain or in situations that we would not like to be in ourselves.  This is good to have this compassion and it sometimes even brings us out of ourselves to help others and act instead of grieve.  But we mustn't stay in this state of sympathy because it is not normal to live exclusively in this "feeling".  We should feel compassion for a bit but also happiness when something we enjoy engages us.

You might be happy, but this is only temporary and you will eventually be in pain as the result of your infatuation. And thus that is why you have guilt.     But true happiness is living the contemplative life, turning away from physical things and even the world itself and realizing the infinite space of your mind.     You can think about anything with your mind, right? And so you can also think about your mind as well, right? So what is the mind? The mind is not a thing at all but a process, a process describing how you think. And so when you think about this process, you are thinking about thoughts, and using your mind to think about your mind.

They saw diseases as a punishment from god and whoever had them didn't deserve to be cured because god knows why some people get diseases.

Even if someone is a bad person, we're obligated to give them medical attention because they're still human. And we never knew they'd be killing others after curing. My point is, if you give up on the bad people, you might accidently give up on the good one too.  The problem of population, I think is a matter of education and minds, not bodies. People don't have to die so we can solve our problems. They need to know that they should be having less kids to provide for a better life quaty.  Think about it.

Life Decryption Key  By Generalist 12-08     Life often looks like a secret puzzle or an encrypted message, especially when we are facing problems. We need to decrypt the message and make some decisions.  The first is to decide if we want to control our lives, or want to rely on an outside force. The second is whether we believe that causes produce effects. This document is intended for people who want to be responsible for their lives, and who accept that causes produce effects. Effects are produced by causes and  we have to make the right causes to get the effects we want. Those who want to control their lives rationally and responsibly, and accept that effects are produced by causes, please read on.    Instead of guiding ones life by the flurry of concepts, hopes, fears, and aphorisms we learn, it is more effective to conduct daily life while using a concise, accurate and short set of reality descriptions. We need a mental key to make the jumble understandable and make decisions more accurate and easier to enact.     The key exists. It is intended strictly to improve the conduct of daily life. It is a primer on how to improve the here and now. The future will be determined by how we deal with the present.     The question naturally occurs, What are the right causes to optimize life for oneself and others?    Please write down all the words of intangibles that attach to life such as love, imagination, dreams, life, hope, fear, hate etc. Then write down all the words that relate to the tangible aspects of life. Think of brain, body, table, car clouds, air, soil, and on without limit. Yet, there is no mind without a brain. There is no car without thought. There is no wood for a table without the intangible life of a tree. The list of tangibles and intangibles is endless in English. However, the inseparability of tangible and intangible aspects is summed up in the words Myoho.      Write down all the words for causes you can think of and effects those causes can have. They are all summed up in the words Renge-Causes simultaneously produce effects like the flower and the seed of the lotus.    Everything is always changing. Write down all the words that come to mind about things changing-Clouds, faces, butterflies, concepts, memories and on and on. They are all summed up in the Japanese word Kyo. Because everything is always changing, no one is stuck where shehe is.       The three words Myoho Renge Kyo include every aspect of life and exclude nothing.     This formulation, used with focused intention, serves as a life decryption key to enable anyone to see the relationships that exist between good concepts and harmful ones. It was derived over thousands of years by brilliant people in India and China and finally used as the title of the Lotus Sutra in Kumarajivas translation of the Lotus Sutra. A 13th century Japanese monk named Nichiren recognized it for what it is and realized that anyone could guide their life better by using this key. He discovered the great treasure of life where anyone had access to it and dedicated his life to providing clarification and access.    The way to use it is to add the shortened Sanskrit verb for focusing intention and create Nam Myoho Renge Kyo. This is spoken repeatedly with the palms pressed together to close the energy circle and focus the mind-brain-body on the essential realities. It releases delusions and limitations as reliably as vitamin C cures scurvy.    Since we each have our unique paths and desires, there is no prescription for what people should focus on when they use the tool.  It is all available. The human mind has vast possibilities to explore once we resolve the confusion. There is no intent to move anyone to think in a certain way. There is definite intention to help human beings to think more effectively in ways that improve their individual and collective lives.  For more detailed information see   http://www.sgi-usa.org. Or  http://www.SGI.org    Caveat; SGI does not use the term life decryption key. That term is my attempt to summarize the essence of the philosophy taught by SGI.|`|4MFvZw1waa	its not the matter of lose or win. but its shows how strong u are against the life... its shows our self confidence n build too.. n life is a fight .. we have to be ready to take challenges|`|vfhnQ6k9aa	I know how you feel. Life is just so hard! It seems like  when you finally feel you are on top of things, you get  knocked down only to pick yourself up and try again.  Sometimes I wonder if that is what it is all about, not   giving up. When things seem hopeless to me I remember  that all things are possible through Jesus Christ and God.  Things that seem impossible can happen through God's  grace. You cannot lose your faith, hope and dreams.  Without those things what do we have? I feel like that   at time, due to my situation but I remind myself things  will get better. It is always darkest before the dawn and  you cannot give up. Things will get better, keep your   chin up and remember to pray. Draw close to God and  He will be there for you. God Bless :)
poC9j0Diaa	Um exscuse me, but just because some one joins the school drama club does not me that they hate the real them. In my school our dram club is just as good as the basketball team and anything else. We all joined becuase we love to act. We also love us. Sometimes it is hard to be in our drama club becuase everyone else thinks that we are freaks and nerds and stuff becuase of what we do on the stage and how we act when we are not on stage. But we aren't freaks. We just aren't afraid to be the real us. We can be the real us and not care what others think. So you are wrong on that part. And for your other question no.

OFA2LAM5aa	Ashkenaz is Medieval Hebrew name for the country of Germany and German-speaking borderland areas. They migrated to the region during the 9th century.  Ashkenazi Jews literally means "German Jews."  Communities in Hungary, Poland, Lithuania, and Russia sprung up in the 10th century creating large non-German speaking Jewish regions.  Did they intermarry? Most certainly.  They lived in Europe for over a thousand years.  What you have today is a person who is mixed with Semitic (Middle Eastern) and European blood.  Though they have lived much longer in Europe than anywhere else in the modern times.

God has given us himself that we may be like him, and he has reserved for himself of power and glory only that which is necessary for the maintenance of those things for the love of which he has thus divested himself of all things else.    5. THE ETERNAL AND DIVINE PURPOSE              There is a great and glorious purpose in the march of the universes through space. All of your mortal struggling is not in vain. We are all part of an immense plan, a gigantic enterprise, and it is the vastness of the undertaking that renders it impossible to see very much of it at any one time and during any one life. We are all a part of an eternal project which the Gods are supervising and outworking. The whole marvelous and universal mechanism moves on majestically through space to the music of the meter of the infinite thought and the eternal purpose of the First Great Source and Center.              The eternal purpose of the eternal God is a high spiritual ideal. The events of time and the struggles of material existence are but the transient scaffolding which bridges over to the other side, to the promised land of spiritual reality and supernal existence. Of course, we mortals find it difficult to grasp the idea of an eternal purpose; we are virtually unable to comprehend the thought of eternity, something never beginning and never ending.

The people who are converted are usually looking for a religion to make their life better, usually after they have suffered a tragedy of some kind or are just having a rough time in life. They also won't do too much questioning if it seems like what they were looking for. People who are advocating these religions are usually nice people who are really misinformed. They are also usually given in depth training on how to convince people, and indoctrinate them. They often also give false hope which people on hard times gladly eat up. Most religions are eerily well designed to indoctrinate and feed to human needs.  Futurama had some hilarious and suprisingly smart anecdotes about religion   FRY                           So that's my story Father Changstein                            el Gamahl.

See if you think Religion is flawed because it fails to measure up to some scientific accuracy regards the world, you are missing the point.    Religions purpose lies in how belief affects the behavior of the believers.    Evolution is not about accuracy, it's about results.    So if Atheists are overcome by nihilism and fail to reproduce, then they are LESS FIT than believers whose faith tells them to have hope & CHILDREN.    You can blather on endlessly that education should somehow 'cure' us of Religion, but the true ignorance is the failure to grasp the mechanism by which Religion empowers the human psyche. Ignorance is to imagine this can be removed without consequence.    The bottom line is that Religion persists because it conveys a survival advantage on those who believe.      The majority of the worlds population will always come from those who want to populate.|`|1iWNBBMfaa	Religion gets part of your system of giving meaning to things.   All people do this: atheists and religious people alike but it's always a kind of struggle to give life some sense. Once you've managed to some extent you're not giving it up easily.    Besides: religion is mostly deeply intertwined in social relations. Leaving religion often has serious consequences for your social life. This makes it hard to even think of it.|`|SOveWKxkaa	If a person thinks that they are doing good, then why would that person want to change their perspective on themselves? What you consider as flaws, they consider as evil thinking. Your question is flawed. The only people that consider all religion is flawed is a person that doesn't believe in all religion. Most people only believe that most religions, other than their own, is flawed.|`|FmbwIbtzaa	One of the most important things a destiny guardian does for her mortal subject is to effect a personal co-ordination of the numerous impersonal spirit influences which indwell, surround, and impinge upon the mind and soul of the evolving material creature. Human beings are personalities, and it is exceedingly difficult for nonpersonal spirits and prepersonal entities to make direct contact with such highly material and discretely personal minds. In the ministry of the guarding angel all of these influences are more or less unified and made more nearly appreciable by the expanding moral nature of the evolving human personality.

Just out of interest what flaws do you mean? oh yh more to the point of ur q the majority of the world is in poverty so they might see religion as a source of hope.|`|W5JjCD9gaa	Because religion can help people get over the hardships that life throw at them.     Compare religion to the legal profession (sorry to be distasteful) in an anology if you will please.    A client comes in every morning to ask their solicitor if he has finished drawing up a certain contract, and if not, when the contract will be completed. Everyday the solicitor tells the person, 'I am sorry but I am still working on it and I don't know when it will be completed as it is very complex.' The client will keep coming back asking when, when, when, until the solicitor final says, 'It will be completed in a week and a half'.   Final, the client will leave the solicitor in peace to carry on working.     Now compare that scenario to one in which the original leaders of civilization, and the creators of religion, were asked, 'what is the meaning of life?' and 'what happens after we die?' by their followers day in, day out for many years. All the leader can do is say, 'sorry but we don't know'. But one day, they final asnwer their followers and they tell them that all of their answers will be satified when the judgement day comes at the end of all time, when they meet their creator.     In both scenarios, a clever persuasion is performs, in which the solicitor buys himself peaceful time, and leaders instill a level of control and in turn increase a population's productivity.    All the best.|`|II5N7XYKaa	First, I do not believe that religion is inherently flawed.  That said, there are many rational explanations for its existence.    There's the theory that it acts as a social glue.  It provides a common bond between people and holds communities together.  We are a social species, and as such we need social cohesiveness.    Then there's the theory that it pacifies our fear of death.  The fear of death is innate and instinctive.  Humans find it easier to face their mortality if they believe death is really just an entry into eternal paradise.    Religion can also provide explanations for phenomena that we are unable to explain otherwise.  Many people would rather attribute experiences to an "act of God" than leave it unexplained.    Lastly, it can placate our desire for justice when we are unable to administer it ourselves.  Hence the belief that good people go to heaven and bad people go to hell.|`|w2qV8WEmaa	3 reasons.    1) Herd mentality. Monkey see monkey do.

HCMrR1O9aa	to me true beauty is seeing the goodness in a bad situation, or shining for others when their path is not lit, or findind the one attractive thing about someone who just got their face smushed in a car wreck, to me beauty comes from within. have you ever noticed that someone can be 'good looking' but they can look like an evil old hag? well, if you have a shitty personality, it will show through any physical features....but if your not the best looking girl or guy in the world and you have an amazing personality, and someone stands you next to the good looking person with the bad personality, who do you think people will naturally go to first?? the nice person....beauty is within and in the eye of the beholder.....i hope i gave you some insight to your question!!!|`|c11aa6f60a1539d5467335708ac1ed21aa	beauty is in the eye of the beholder.|`|Sf3ZFezRaa	A baby is true beauty.

What is desirable will change over time and will be different between different individuals, because our desires change.  Sometimes a man desires a woman sexually, but he doesn't desire her to nag him.  Sometimes a male tiger desires a female tiger, but anything smaller would see her as scary!    My candidate for true beauty would be the human emotion that motivates us to help others.  Every time I feel it (not enough!) it still feels good!|`|RDxwA15kaa	Well im reminded of the phrase "beauty is in the eye of the beholder".   To me nature is beauty.

It simply means the viewer likes what they see.

Have you ever met someone and thought they were attractive and then the started talking and suddenly they weren't as attractive before.  Or, conversely, someone not so attractive becoming more attractive as you get to know them?  Truly beauty is a thing of perception.  I think there is more beauty in nature.  Like Niagara Falls.

In cases of abuse, many women and children surrender due to torture and fear. Fear and pain are often motivation to surrender one's will. Prisoner's of War sometimes surrender for the same reasons. The most common reason to surrender one's will is in the Christian faith, when one totally surrenders their will to live God's purpose for their live. The first two examples are by choice, but for survival. To give your will over to God is a choice one makes with their heart and soul.|`|az2ZBy3iaa	No. One can only take a resigned position, forfeit any real or imagined power, and put the burden of responsibility onto whatever he/she believes he/she is surrendering their will to.    As for whether or not the responsibility is really transmitted, that depends on the specific target to whom an individual surrenders his/her will.|`|8ekoa6szaa	I live an alternative lifestyle--that of BDSM.  I am a submissive woman and I give my will up to my Dominant.  It is known as a Total Power Exchange.  I give him "permission" (as if He needs it!) to do what He wants with me, trusting that He will will give me the pain that brings me pleasure but will never harm me when doing so.      A submissive/slave surrenders her will to  her One.  It works.|`|6b24cf642defa808f4e13cc745076453aa	No.   In making any choice we exercise our will.

AA11867354	Neither    I know people with age who have not gather much wisdom  And I know people with experience who constantly repeat the same mistakes    I know some in Government --who had both and I wouldn't call some wise men    Humans,, are not governed primarily by instinct neither.     A persons attitude and behavior are, of course, largely a product of the moral precepts and spiritual tenets that they are taught, or not taught,  many from infancy. As a result, people may differ in what they consider to be right or wrong, acceptable or unacceptable. These differences, in turn, can lead to misunderstandings, intolerance, and even hatred, especially when such factors as culture, nationalism, and religion exert a strong influence.    I think, in its essence, wisdom is about wholeness. It is about the wholeness of life. Wise people and decisions take one or more dimensions of that wholeness seriously. They appreciate it and build on it with what they say and the impact they have on the world.     The words "holy," "wholesome," "health" and "healing" are all rooted in the idea of "wholeness." Wholeness involves the entirety of things, which suggests inclusion and seeing the big picture.       Above all, wisdom serves life. It serves the wholeness (healing, integrity, sacredness) of individual lives, and it serves the larger whole, the whole of the community or the world, in which these individual lives are embedded. It honors and learns from the past, deepens into the present, and acts on behalf of The Seventh Generation after us - engaging the whole of time, the big picture.     Some of the CHARACTERISTICS that I think mark wisdom are:     It embraces the BIG PICTURE -- in any situation, it seeks to take into consideration the long term, the full story     It uses MULTIPLE WAYS OF KNOWING -- for example, it uses heart, intuition, story and spirit as well as facts and reason.      It is INCLUSIVE AND OPEN --   It knows what is and if there is  more to it than that.     It is INSIGHTFUL AND APPROPRIATE -, t cuts to the essence of what needs to be understood in a situation     * It is HUMBLE AND RECEPTIVE -- recognizing the limitations and relativity of all perspectives and knowledge     It SERVES LIFE      It is GROUNDED IN RELATIONSHIP -- appreciating,, it serves harmony, balance, dialog,       It has an ELEGANT SIMPLICITY -- using no more (resources, words, force, etc.) than necessary      It has INTEGRITY -- embodying courageous commitment to truth      It has PRESENCE         I don't think age or experience always give wisdom. I think it takes more|`|6b24cf642defa808f4e13cc745076453aa	Certainly not age alone. I reckon Wisdom is where you find it - and you find it be reflecting on experience and other inputs ... turning things upside down and back-to-front.   And being unafraid of whatever might challenge your ideas of yourself, the world, or others.    When you learn something it always feels as though you've lost something.   If it doesn't it means you missed the lesson, after all.   That's why going to church etc does nothing to advance one's wisdom.   It merely provides the security blanket of a congregation of shared belief (which would be largely contradictory if you examined them individually and deeply!)|`|AA10025824	It's gained by experience and your ability to absorb and learn from experience.    You can be ignorant for a lifetime and not gain any wisdom, but you can gain wisdom overnight if you learn from experience.|`|yOK32PM9aa	I would say neither; because there are some old people around who are not very wise, and likewise people can have lots of experiences and be none the wiser.  Wisdom may mean different things to different people, but I think it is mainly a product of how you use your mind in dealing with the world.  The wisest people I have known have made a point of hanging out with other wiser people, persisting in what they are doing, and maintaining the humility to admit they can be wrong.|`|w6DJj1a8aa	i think it's experience and age because the more you go through the better understanding of the world you are and that goes with age it takes time to learn and grow.|`|gxqawyxUaa	Experience, no doubt.    "Knowing right from wrong" is produced by experiencing actions with others, customs, traditions. Wisdom isn't by age, sex, etc. It's by knowing what's proactive and what's detrimental and following through with the instinct.|`|FmbwIbtzaa	There is no wisdom with out worship.   Did Bill Gates get where he is today with out worship. Faith is a living attribute of genuine personal religious experience. You can bet He religiously dedicated himself to getting where he is    When it come to God one believes truth, admires beauty, and reverences goodness, but does not worship them; such an attitude of saving faith is centered on God alone, who is all of these personified and infinitely more.    Just why we can sell our soul to something not of God.|`|5ELpGvMKaa	Both. Together. We experienced something age by age. Age and experience can't separate. They are together.

I have seen children who have experienced more life than some adults. And in some ways that makes them wiser than adults. Overall I would have to say then that experience wins over age.|`|8ekoa6szaa	Wisdom comes with experience which comes with age.  We are all the grand sum total of our life's experiences.|`|OqlXBUsaaa	experience may be considered as one of the greatest teacher.   it leads our senses to avoid pain.  it gives our knowledge to better understanding of reality and truth  it leads our reason to be "good" and do good things    on the contrary, age has "heavier" experience.  ....the youngest heart has the same waves within it as the oldest, but without the plummet which can measure the depths  ...Ritchter

r7iZ2JOUaa	Celebrities are who they are to entertain us while robbing our money at the same time and instilling certain unpleasant behaviors to viewers either knowingly or unknowingly. I do not see anything great in celebrities. People these days have a misperception on this issue. For an example, a person may admire an actor/actress after watching a movie. However, what exactly is the person admiring about the celebrity? Is he or she admiring the personality of the celebrity in reality or who the celebrity is in the film? Having celebrities is not a need in this twenty-first century civilisation. It is a want.     I am 16 years old and am not a fan of any celebrity or band. I do not support hedonism. These celebrities should be using their cash to help the homeless people, especially in the States. I have realised that life is unfair but it still is possible to strive for equality. Well, at least to eliminate deprivations here on earth.|`|az2ZBy3iaa	They serve as people providing us with works of art such as movies, music, etc. We treat them differently than other people for our own needs.    Quite frankly, as humans, we have a hate for everything greater than ourselves. Therefore, people made famous through their artistic products provide the perfect opportunity. Furthermore, we envy the lifestyles these people have, and thus pay large amounts of attention to them.    I've never really paid any real attention of celebrities and what I know about them is all from friends.

You really have to want to read, and you have to be hungry, but hungry for knowledge and plot. You really just have to focus on the book you're reading....trying picking out a book that you really think YOU will be interested in, then maybe it will hold your attention for a little bit longer.    I just finished Jude the Obscure by Thomas Hardy, it was like 430 pages....and i finished it in 3 days--I really loved it!! Try to find a book so THAT can happen to you :)|`|HZbSbZIraa	try reading any jodi picolt books she is very good and her books are very good and hard to put down|`|mqSauKKvaa	Practice Meditation. If possible, everyday.    During the meditation, don't think anything voluntarily. Whenever any thoughts arise, let them be - as far as possible - just like a 'flow'. As if, they are flowing on their own.     Don't try to even focus on anything consciously. But just remain alert. And don't sleep during these periods with eyes closed. If you sleep, no improvement will take place.    Another point. Not even try to control your problem by any approach of conscious 'negation'. By such negation of the so-called 'negative' activities (e.g. TV, Internet, Stereo, Snacks) you can, at most, solve the distractions only temporarily.     Rather you go for 'position'. You get to get back to possess something positive, again.     And it's Meditation again that will do it too! You may then even come out with more fluency and more variety into your past good old 'habit of reading'!     I hope your past will not only be restored, but will even be enhanced with a new flow of thinking angles!!
AA10725882	The dating system was devised in ~ 525AD by Dionysius Exiguus.   When he devised his system the Julian calendar years were identified by naming the consuls who held office that year.      How he arrived at the date for the birth of Jesus is unknown, but most historians believe he got it wrong.  Jesus was probably born in ~4 or 5 BC.      The "Gregorian calendar" of Gregory XIII was proclaimed by that pope in 1582 because the Julian calendar was off and the dates were not matching up with the seasons.  Gregory XIII declared that October 5th would become October 15th to make up the difference - so ten days of history are missing.    Here's a good link if you don't mind Wikipedia  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dionysius_E...    Good question - fun to look up.|`|f8U0wLg7aa	I believe it was The Romans. The Holy Roman Empire.

UKTJfWEzaa	While Lee was one of the best Generals the American people ever had he was not the best of the Civil War. He had very little interest in the war as a whole but only focused on Virginia. It is largely a result of his single minded approach coupled with Davis' desire to protect Richmond at all cost which led to the rest of the Confederacy being neglected.    Grant was able to use all the advantages he as a Union general had at his disposal to their utmost to gain victory time and time again, despite coming close to failure against John S. Bowen in the Vicksburg Campaign (lack of manpower and support cost Bowen in that campaign), he was able to, time and again, score the tactical and strategical victories that other men could not.    When Grant faced Lee he lost a number of battles tactically but didn't lose Strategically and because of that Grant won in the long run. Perhaps if the sides had been more evenly matched in manpower, supply and industrial capabilities it may not have had the same result but that simply was not the case.    Grant had the advantage at his disposal and used them to get Tactical and Strategical victory where other men had failed before and Lee, who didn't have those advantages, was able to score Tactical victories but never came close to scoring Strategical victory.    If you want to know who the Best Civil War general was then I ask you to draw your attention to Nathan Bedford Forrest  as he was quite possibly the best America ever had but between Lee and Grant, Grant was the better, but its only by a small margine.    (Personally I prefer Lee but one cannot deny Grant's abilities)|`|rxlxw2ZHaa	Lee by a long shot.  Lee actually had to "out General" Grant where-as Grant ended up winning simply by outlasting Lee.  Grant had the supplies, manpower, industrial might and everything else to wage a hard war.  All Lee had was his army and little else.  Even the firearms the south used were antiques.  Many of the units were using smooth-bore muskets while some of the Union units actually had early repeating rifles.  Had the manpower and supplies been equal, the war would have been over very soon after Lee took field command of The Army of Northern Virginia.  Lee was such a promising officer even before the war that General Winfield Scott got Lincoln to offer the position of Commander of all Union forces to Lee while Lee was still just a Colonel, but Lee refused.|`|AA10769823	Lee was. He was mostly hindered by the lack of provisions to fight a war. Grant on the otherhand was from the bottom of his military class, an alcoholic gambler, and was even charged with drinking during tenure in the western theater. His lack of leadership skills is evident in his presidency.|`|Oc7Cgi0oaa	Lee.    The South had the best leadership.|`|t8XCrootaa	Lee's strategy was horrible he was more worried about capturing citys in the north that were historical monuments like washington and philadelphia that is why he was in virginia so much.  Grant used the anaconda plan which was a strategy to cut off the souths food supply from tennessee and the north captured new orleans and all of the miss. river and that stopped the souths way of travel and supply transportation; and  Lee was defeated by grant in ghettysburg as well which pretty much gave the north a huge victory and put them on the path to victory....so i would say grant|`|G2JHunHjaa	Having studied Military History for many years I am of the opinion that Grant was a far better General than Lee (eg Vicksburg campaign).    On the other side, however, one should not forget the skill displayed by Jackson (Valley Campaign).|`|DenLZAL1aa	Grant. And yes Lee made a grave mistake.    At the Battle of Gettysburg, Robert E. Lee made a mistake that doomed the hopes of the Confederate States of America to compel the United States to sue for peace. Why one of the great generals of his time made such a blunder continues to be a topic of research and intense debate. Lee said little at the time or afterward to justify his decision to launch what has become known as Pickett's Charge, so analysis must be inferential and inconclusive. Our aim is to explain Lee's fateful decision not with new facts but with new analytical methods to illuminate decisionmaking in combat.     Robert E. Lee is widely and rightly regarded as one of the finest generals in history. Yet on July 3, 1863, the third day of the Battle of Gettysburg, he ordered a frontal assault across a mile of open field against the strong center of the Union line. The stunning Confederate defeat that ensued produced heavier casualties than Lee's army could afford and abruptly ended its invasion of the North. That the Army of Northern Virginia could fight on for 2 more years after Gettysburg was a tribute to Lee's abilities. (1) While Lee's disciples defended his decision vigorously--they blamed James Longstreet, the corps commander in charge of the attack, for desultory execution--historians and military analysts agree that it was a mistake. For whatever reason, Lee was reticent about his reasoning at the time and later.|`|eef0fd7a18ed1e8ac453b6086f666edfaa	That's like comparing apples to oranges.  Let's face it Lee was great up till Gettysburg, after it was Grant.     Lee's greatest victories were the Seven Days Battles, the Second Battle of Bull Run, the Battle of Fredericksburg, and the Battle of Chancellorsville, but both of his campaigns to invade the North ended in failure. Barely escaping defeat at the Battle of Antietam in 1862, Lee was forced to return to the South. In early July 1863, Lee was decisively defeated at the Battle of Gettysburg in Pennsylvania. However, due to ineffectual pursuit by the commander of Union forces, Major General George Meade, Lee escaped again to Virginia    Grant implemented a coordinated strategy of simultaneous attacks aimed at destroying the South's ability to carry on the war. In 1865, after conducting a costly war of attrition in the East, he accepted the surrender of his Confederate opponent Robert E. Lee at Appomattox|`|DIlNnjf8aa	Lee, of course.|`|Gburbcuiaa	Lee.

Make sure they have a professional looking studio, and you should be able to look at the photos after the shoot, if I am correct. I have never had headshots taken, right now I am using snapshots because I can't afford them. Good headshots can cost you anywhere from 300-700 dollars.   You should be able to change into a few different outfits, and possibly pick locations. Some photographers have makeup artists there in the studio to do your makeup, and same for hair. It all depends. That would cost you more.  Take 100-200 shots, maybe more.  Finding a good photographer shouldn't be hard, you live in NY and there are a lot of people looking for headshots there.  as far as sending them out, I am not entirely sure on the etiquette there.     break a leg!

az2ZBy3iaa	What could be defined as "American culture" revolves around the democratic political system it has implemented. As is natural for a Western society (Christianity anyone?), it is extremely expansionist and is incredibly intolerant when it comes to other cultures and political systems associated with them. Take for example the Islamic theocratic political system. Although Europeans once had a similar system (Catholicism), this system is deemed somehow "evil" and "unfit for world peace". Thus, just as Christian Europe initiated the Crusades, we see the Americans attempt to force the Muslims to conform to the American cultural and political system. Another example would be the traditional Asian political system with an Emperor who has absolute power. Perhaps it is due to the American fear of the efficiency and power of such a political model, perhaps it is simply a fear of a competing ideology, the Americans are equally opposed to this political system for no reason other than its existence. Practical examples include the Japanese Empire, China today, and to a large degree, Russia under Vladmir Putin, who has been called, several times, the "modern czar" by Western media.    Ultimately, what the Americans demand the world do in order to achieve "world peace" would be to abandon whatever former culture and associated political systems other states (particularly nation-states like Russia, China, etc) and conform to the American culture. Fortunately, nobody currently operating under a non-American political system is insane enough to do that.    With regards to Japan and its supposedly "successful" conversion to Western democracy, the nature of the Japanese society is still, to this day, extremely hierarchical, sexist, and generally oppressive. I'm sure you all heard about the workplace abuses that take place daily in many, if not most Japanese offices. Furthermore, despite my hate for the pre-WWII, militaristic, expansionist Japanese Empire (I'm Chinese), I can't help but feel sad about its current state. In a way, it's comparable to a tiger declawed, de-toothed, and locked up in a zoo. It may not be able to kill anyone anymore, but it certainly isn't the way nature intended it to be.|`|AA11564934	track to what?    abandoning what culture?    there is no road to world peace other than genetic manipulation|`|zzO6Qalsaa	I think not, by doing so we all become lifeless zombies.

At most, the culture is changing, as with all cultures over time.|`|FmbwIbtzaa	Even on normal evolutionary worlds the realization of the world-wide brotherhood of man is not an easy accomplishment. On a confused and disordered planet like ours such an achievement requires a much longer time and necessitates far greater effort. Unaided social evolution can hardly achieve such happy results on a spiritually isolated sphere. Religious revelation is essential to the realization of brotherhood. While Jesus has shown the way to the immediate attainment of spiritual brotherhood, the realization of social brotherhood on your world depends much on the achievement of the following personal transformations and planetary adjustments:    1. Social fraternity. Multiplication of international and interracial social contacts and fraternal associations through travel, commerce, and competitive play. Development of a common language and the multiplication of multilinguists. The racial and national interchange of students, teachers, industrialists, and religious philosophers.    2. Intellectual cross-fertilization. Brotherhood is impossible on a world whose inhabitants are so primitive that they fail to recognize the folly of unmitigated selfishness. There must occur an exchange of national and racial literature. Each race must become familiar with the thought of all races; each nation must know the feelings of all nations. Ignorance breeds suspicion, and suspicion is incompatible with the essential attitude of sympathy and love.    3. Ethical awakening. Only ethical consciousness can unmask the immorality of human intolerance and the sinfulness of fratricidal strife. Only a moral conscience can condemn the evils of national envy and racial jealousy. Only moral beings will ever seek for that spiritual insight which is essential to living the golden rule.     4. Political wisdom. Emotional maturity is essential to self-control. Only emotional maturity will insure the substitution of international techniques of civilized adjudication for the barbarous arbitrament of war. Wise statesmen will sometime work for the welfare of humanity even while they strive to promote the interest of their national or racial groups. Selfish political sagacity is ultimately suicidal--destructive of all those enduring qualities which insure planetary group survival.    5. Spiritual insight. The brotherhood of man is, after all, predicated on the recognition of the fatherhood of God. The quickest way to realize the brotherhood of man on Urantia is to effect the spiritual transformation of present-day humanity. The only technique for accelerating the natural trend of social evolution is that of applying spiritual pressure from above, thus augmenting moral insight while enhancing the soul capacity of every mortal to understand and love every other mortal. Mutual understanding and fraternal love are transcendent civilizers and mighty factors in the world-wide realization of the brotherhood of man.

But if  the track is, "Have no gasoline powered autos on the road after 2011" then we are on the wrong track."    When we consider, "The road to world peace," it would be useful to quantify the definition of world peace so that we know when we have reached it.  Furthermore, if you set the goal of world peace in, say 10 years, the answer is different than if your view is 300 years out.    Finally, what is the definition of culture?  Do you mean that when everyone speaks the same language, or no language at all, then we will be closer to world peace?  Or do you mean that if we stop listening to music we will be closer to world peace?

x15ek422aa	You are referring to the "Zimmermann telegram" which was intercepted on January 16, 1917 sent from Germany to the German Ambassador to the United States.  That was WORLD WAR I.  As to your question:    Mexico did not have to be an ally of the US,  but they did. Years of belligerence between the two countries was put aside for fear of the dangers Germany and Japan formed in our minds. Mexicans as individuals joined the US Army. We updated their air force and it had a small but valiant role in the reconquest of the Philippines. US trained Mexican counter intelligence policemen chased down potential saboteurs from infiltrating our border with Mexico.Also, Pres. Lazaro Cardenes was very friendly with Pres. Roosevelt and Mexico aided the US war effort with supplies and money.      At 6:05 a.m. on Sunday, December 7, 1941, the six Japanese carriers launched a first wave of 183 planes composed mainly of dive bombers, horizontal bombers and fighters. The Japanese hit American ships and military installations at 7:51 a.m. The first wave attacked military airfields of Ford Island. At 8:30 a.m. a second wave of 180 Japanese planes, mostly torpedo bombers, attacked the fleet anchored in Pearl Harbor.    There are documents that state that President Roosevelt knew of this attack.  The US had been in a deep depression since the Crash of 1929.  War is good for the economy.  And as a result of World War II, the US did finally come out that long and tragic Depression.    In sum, No, there are no documents or records in the National Archive, the General Services Administration, the War Department archives, or any other place to substantiate your question.

Yes, Democracy FTW!" point of view. But they didn't want to get involved because they didn't mess with anything the other side of the Atlantic.    Also, my teacher told me that wars are great for the economy. Because everyone gets hyped up for the war effort and everyone works and makes a lot of war materials and the private companies get a lot of money for that.

DS2huIAkaa	The egg if by "egg" you mean egg in general.    If you are referring particularly to the chicken egg and use the present tense as you do ("comes first") then it is a circular argument.    If what you meant to say was "came first" it would have to be "egg" again presuming that the first chicken was a mutant of the ancestor that produced that egg.    The "chicken or egg" question is normally poised metaphorically and it is pointless to ask for a literal/ scientific answer.

In fact, don't we "choose" to compromise in different situations?|`|f2cQrG7jaa	Compromise is an illusion, and so is choice for that matter, but one at a time. Compromise is a convenient concept we use to avoid the tension altogether, it's never resolved why would it have to be? No reason except our selfish reasons, which is all we got. Choice is tricky because people think their thoughts are them. That their conscious is contained within thought. Thought has a life of it's own and likes to pretend it was the chooser so it can utilize the possibilities that grow from that "choice". Fate and free will are the same if you take out the "chooser" in the equation.|`|A01w1dHqaa	Even compromises are choices but made without faith.|`|IAXhu2tuaa	I choose to make plans, but reality forces me to compromise.|`|0tNCtgzbaa	compromise if I have a choice I want to be a queen to rule the world.|`|i1JVe24Oaa	Every moment in life is a result of a choice we've made before.|`|JjU6IdnDaa	The beauty of mankind is the opportunity to make choices beyond instinct.

Now I compromise much less, on the principle that how others respond to any given situation is their business, and their own problem, not mine.   But if I negotiate some agreement, that's my choice, too.|`|V5Mw6rUtaa	It can't just be one or the other. Life is not just black and white. You have the option of taking a different path at every crossroad in your life.|`|Y60dqzCMaa	A compromise suggests that there was a guaranteed better state, from which you voluntarily abstained. i.e. I'll give you $50 and a bike if you give me $40 and 3 shirts. If you refuse, I may take 2 shirts as a compromise, although I knew I could have 3 given the circumstances.     In life, we act with an element of uncertainty surrounding most choices we make. So, just because a choice may not lead to your coronation in Monte Carlo, I wouldn't view it as a compromise, since that state is never guaranteed.     Jeff|`|d76540548b78851b2b0db3441e66ae54aa	It's a combination of the two. Most, if not all, of the time the only choice is to compromise.
MBm4ieNkaa	There were four major causes of World War 1) The rise of nationalism, (2) a build-up of military might, (3) competition for colonies, and (4) a system of military alliances.       (1) Nationalism is the belief that loyalty to a nation and its political and economic goals comes before any other public loyalty.     (2) Nationalism encouraged public support for military build-ups and for a countrys use of force to achieve its goals.     (3) During the late 1800s and early 1900s, European nations competed to have colonies in Africa and Asia.  Competition for colonies strained relations among European countries.  Which led to several clashes between certain European countries. (4) The Triple Alliance also known as the Three Emperors League was formed in 1881.  Germanys prime minister, Chancellor Otto von Bismarck, formed a series of alliances to strengthen his countrys security by making Germany an ally of Austria-Hungary and of Italy.     All of these events led up to the assassination of Archduke Frances Ferdinand, heir to the throne of Austria-Hungary, which triggered World War I.    World War 2 started in 1939. On August 31, 1939, Hitler and the Nazis staged a Polish attack on a minor German radio station in order to justify a German invasion of Poland. On September 1, Hitler declared war on Poland stating one of his reasons for the invasion was because of "the attack by regular Polish troops on the Gleiwitz transmitter."     France and Britain had a defensive pact with Poland. This forced France and Britian to declare war on Germany, which they did on September 3.|`|wnkoTEqVaa	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I  Archduke Ferdinad was killed    Germany invaded poland.     http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I...|`|xFg8mQeCaa	There were four major causes of World War 1) The rise of nationalism, (2) a build-up of military might, (3) competition for colonies, and (4) a system of military alliances.

8YGZ5xNFaa	Yo no se
5L6z92Iqaa	The story and point of view are fine.     I would suggest a different opening line. I had to try rereading three times to pull me in further.     If you like writing then keep writing it. you should write for yourself before you are concerned if others will read it or not. If you won't read it or don't care to finish it then why would we want to? you need to love the story ten times more than we would and focus on that before worrying about anyone else's perspective.    Overall very good though. Engaging story line once you get into it a bit.|`|nSJ6q5SQaa	Okay, I just want you to know, I am not being mean, I'm just trying to help.    "If you were to walk down the halls of Saxmon High School, one of the fanciest magnet school's in Maine, you would know the latest gossip when you walked through the front door."   This sentence doesn't make sence. First, it says 'if you walked down the halls...' then it says '....when you walked though the front door.'    "Shall we carry on with this story....or should we just pass it over as a rumor? Well, I'm going to follow you up on it, no matter what you say. If you don't want to hear it, then stop reading, but, I'm telling you, you'd miss out on one tear jerking story."  I suggest not putting that in the story. Personally, I don't like stories that talk to the reader.    '"Can you believe it?! Veronica's pregnant!"  "Who's Veronica? Does she have, auburn brown hair, you know, with the big brown eyes and the ashy, pasty skin?"  "Dude, that girl....you know, brown eyes and hair, pale skin....?"  "Yeah, she's pregnant, I know."  "Did you hear? Veronica is pregnant."'  This didn't make sence. I would rephrase it.  And don't use an exclamation mark and a question mark at the same time.    "Veronica sighed and put her lip gloss back into her purse. It seemed as if the whole hallway was starring at her with blank expressions."  Why would they stare at her with blank expressions. Wouldn't they be shocked?    I don't know if this was a typo or not, but you changed the spelling Isabella to Izabella half-way though.    '"Your 2 minutes late!" He pointed at her laughing.'  Why would her boyfriend point and laugh at her, even if she was late to class?    'She gulped and walked into the nearest stall, locking the hinge as quick as she could, being intellegant enough to not get into a fight or anything. It could harm the baby....or her.  "You don't know that I'm pregnant!" She opened the stall walking angrily towards Jade.'  Intellegant should be intelligent.   And didn't Veronica go into the stall so she wouldn't get into a fight with Jade?     "Now, let's go over what we know so far in this 'rumor'. Veronica is pregnant, only two months and barely showing, but, Brandon her ex boyfriend told everyone she was pregnant, just to ruin her reputation. What he didn't know is....that the rumor he started....was actually true. Sound realistic enough to you? I think it sounds good to me."  Again, I don't really like narrator to say 'me'.    There were a few more misspellings, so keep a dictionary close if you don't know how to spell the word.  And don't put a lot of .........'s in your story. And 'alot' is spelled  'a lot'.  Go to this, http://owl.english.purdue.edu/handouts/g... , to learn to correctly use commas. I saw quite a lot of incorrect usage.  Overall, it was pretty good.   Good luck!|`|dPGbFd1Faa	great|`|qqNOyOjIaa	I really liked the first book. Mainly because its so true, as badly as it is this is how people act. I would definitely read it kept me intrigued and I'd like to know how she deals with it. I think you should keep writing it only if its not "the secret lfie of an american teenager" turned into a book. Although I like the show it is too unemotional. I hope your story to be emotional and heartwretching, making you feel sad for the girl praying that she'll get through it all. I did like the intro about gossip(this is in regards to the 3rd person that your using) I think it'd be good to do this in the beginning of every chapter. You could reveal some truth of high school(such as gossip) and tie it into your story. Tell me how it goes!|`|38eb78ef54653766c3ca71d79051901caa	Wrong way to start a story, hon.    Nothing in the first paragraph makes me think "oh my god, I wonder what's going to happen next?"    The first paragraph, if not the first sentence, is the most important.  If you don't grab your readers right there, most likely you never will.|`|GqrRBZ3faa	It's alright. There are a few things I would work on.  "but, I'm telling you, you'd miss out on one tear jerking story."  The switching point of view thing is fine, but in the beginning it does sound a tad cheesy, especially that line above.  "she looked down at a long list of vocabulary words on a white sheet of paper sitting right in front of her."  You don't need to say 'sitting right in front of her' because you already said she is looking down at it, making it obvious that is it right in front of her. There are lots of points in the chapter where things are restated like that. It is just unnecessary and doesn't add anything to the story, so don't be afraid to just delete those extras.  "Veronica held onto her stomach, feeling a little kick."  Babies don't start moving in the womb until about four months. You already said she is two months along, so this doesn't make sense. And you start showing by the third month, so it is a little weird that she is shocked that so many people know. She is probably looking a little bigger already, so of course people will be speculating.  "His eyes were a dark yellow, almost light brown. His eye brows slanted down a little bit, but, hey no one is perfect."  Topaz? Been done. There's nothing wrong with a crisp green or deep sea blue. Same with Isabella. Her description and name is exactly like Bella. Plus, you spelt it Isabella once and then Izabella a different time.  "His eye brows slanted down a little bit, but, hey no one is perfect."  Everyone's eyebrows naturally slant down. Why is this something odd?  "and how she would tell him that she's pregnant...."  Rumors are flying around school, yet he doesn't have a clue? That is a little off.  "She gulped and walked into the nearest stall, locking the hinge as quick as she could, being intellegant enough to not get into a fight or anything. It could harm the baby....or her.  "You don't know that I'm pregnant!" She opened the stall walking angrily towards Jade."  lol, you say she went into the stall to not get in a fight, and then she opens it to start...fighting.    There are just little things like that, but otherwise it is okay. The plot line is a tad cliche. Is there a big twist you are planning to make it more original? Do whatever you can to make it your own.  I probably would read it, but it wouldn't be at the top of my to do list.  And, yes, you should keep writing it! If it is what you love to do and want to do then don't let any suggestions on here defer you from that. Do what you want!  Good luck, and happy writing.|`|FIbTFKzoaa	I think its good, the only thing I think its lacking is an attention getter right at the beginning. That would make me want to reed it even more.|`|AOkucu5haa	Only problem: too many ellipses.    Personally, it isn't something I'd read, but it's good.    Oh, there are also a few grammar issues, nothing editing couldn't fix, though.

7kUyIGQhaa	It was all business, not some weird conspiracy.    Every country as a matter of honour wanted up-to-date defence industries. This berms of technology, because they continued building straight through from World War 1.  So nations building up their industries tended to either partner with more advanced nations, or buy the stuff they couldn't make.    So, for instance, Vickers of Britain sold the 'Six-ton tank' to many nations in the late 20s, and it became the T-26 tank in Russia, the 7TP in Poland, the M11-39 in Italy and so on.  This was not the British government, it was private enterprise.  Similarly, American aero engines went to Russia, Czech machine guns to Britain and so on.    It is easy to slate the actual design of most important weapons to the companies and individuals who designed them.    There were a few multinational companies like Ford and General Motors that had factories in Germany, and Henry Ford tried hard to use the war to wipe out his opponents and secure the whole German truck industry to himself.|`|wmBK9uASaa	The first tanks were built by Trittons foundry in Lincoln,formerly an agricultural engineers they were experimenting with the tracked wheel movement,they built "mother" as a test bed then produced the Mk1,

E3TjdZK7aa	This myth is absolutely FALSE.    Are people really buried in the Great Wall?    This is another popular claim that has never been substantiated. Neither physical evidence nor documentation to confirm this claim has ever been found.    The Great Wall is badly deteriorated in many (most) areas and so if there really were bodies buried in it, they would have been found frequently by people such as myself who have spent a lot of time exploring the Great Wall of China.    The rumor came from Ripley's Believe it or not. They also stated (falsely) that the Great Wall was visible from the moon.

Sure, you have a bit of cliche in here, but so does a lot of other poetry...    You put your heart into it, and that's what poetry is...your emotion.

(Atlas Srugged)    'Need' is unlimited, everybody needs.  What's in much shorter supply is merit.    Darwinian principles are clear, you get more of what you reward.  Understand?  Reward need, you get more need as the needy flock to have their needs met.  Reward merit, you get more merit, as those with something to offer, seek fair recompense for their labors.    See, as a  kid someone else is providing for your needs.  Socialism comes alone and says wouldn't it be nice to be a kid forever, let's make the rich be perpetual parents and endlessly provide your needs.    Love means you work together for the common good.  So what wrong with universal love?   Simple.  If I'm working & you are slacking, what you call being in love, I call tolerating a parasite.    Society progresses because talented people who want a better standard of living, bust their butts to make it happen.   Socialism steals their reward, then wonders why the talented stop working.    Obama will penalize people who create jobs then wonder why fewer jobs are being created.  Trillions in tax dollars will be spent to shore up banks damaged by Goverment programs forcing them to loan money based on NEED rather than MERIT.    Whether it's housing or health care, ADULTS expect to pay for the services they recieve.  Socialism creates a bunch of Children, who sit around wondering how to con the adults, instead of trying to grow up.|`|w2qV8WEmaa	Robin Hood exist in a world where the rich people, corrupted government and mafia are basically the same. The rich people are rich because they get the wealth from the poor by force. Therefore, Robin Hood is a hero, when he use the same means to get the money back to the poor.    However, in the modern world, Robin Hood and mafias are basically the same. Therefore, it is wrong.     To only effective way to remove poverty is good government that create good business environment. The poor people are poor not because the rich keep the money. They are poor because they don't know how to create wealth themselves. I have seem poor people become rich by making and selling food and drinks.|`|FoIxsunVaa	As a Taoist, I am struck by the huge amount of Christian assumptions in your idea. Why should atheists and taoists and  heathens and satanists have to support their "brother?"    What if you had to pay a tax for Santeria practitioners to have chickens to sacrifice? I mean actually there would be nothing wrong with that, but to say "you should have no objection because gutting a chicken is SACRED" is as ludicrous as your argument.|`|UXc6lMZBaa	I don't care about Robin Hood one way of another. If you think it's relevant to our time, it isn't. This was feudalism. The poor could not get rich by working hard and the rich could not get poor by being stupid. That's completely different from America, if that is the comparison you are trying to make.    Loving everyone wouldn't be wrong. But who loves everyone? Here's what would be wrong: stealing money from someone who earned it for himself and his family and giving it to someone else.
wYvFytHoaa	They look like this right?: ?    This black bar you speak of is called the beam of the notes; connecting the vertical lines (stems) of the notes.     Two eighth notes go in one beat. And if you were to add another beam, they'd turn into 16th notes; which are 4 notes in one beat. This pattern continues.|`|8g4ccn5maa	The black connecting bar shows that the four notes are eighth notes and get only 1/2 beat each.  The math works.  4 eighth notes equal 2 beats and the 2 1/4 notes equal the other 2 beats.

ceBTTCPwaa	"That Evening Sun" is a short story by the American author William Faulkner, published in 1931 on the collection These 13, which included Faulkner's most anthologized story, "A Rose for Emily." "That Evening Sun" is a dark portrait of white Southerners' indifference to the crippling fears of one of their African-American employees, Nancy. The story is narrated by Quentin Compson, one of Faulkner's most memorable characters, and concerns the reactions of he and his two siblings, Caddy and Jason, to an adult world that they do not fully understand. The African-American washerwoman, Nancy, fears that her common-law husband Jesus is seeking to murder her because she is pregnant with a white man's child. The title is taken from a blues song by William Christopher Handy, although there is no mention of this in the story.    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/That_evenin...        http://www.cliffsnotes.com/WileyCDA/LitN...

olahi6esaa	Dwight Eisenhower would have been sacked and sent back to the US. From then on the allied focus is on Italy, where the southern half of the country is already in allied control. Under pressure from Churchill, Harold Alexander is made new Supreme Commander of the Allied Expeditionary Force. The sheer size of Allied numbers mean Germany is still defeated, but the war goes on for much longer and is more costly.|`|f8U0wLg7aa	Two possibilities.    US drops out of the war, as Russia had done before. German power rises over years and slowly gains control of Europe, untill they are nearly unstoppable.    OR    US attacks again in a different way, with different soldiers, some type of new plan.    In reality, the invasion of Normandy almost did FAIL. Hitler was mistaken, when he thought the primary invasion was a diversion for something larger, and left a large armor division in a different location. One of Hitlers largest military mistakes may have led to his overall downfall during the war.    Hope I helped.|`|K4FVyJuXaa	nothing.  they would have tried again.  The allies by this point in the war had far more manpower than the already beaten Germans.   So the allies had the resources to try again.

Remember DDay was near the end of the war. The Germans had already been driven back from Italy and Southern France.  The best part of the German Armt had been destroyed in the heavy fighting from Anzio onward. Normandy was defended by the remnants of a defeated Army. The Germans were already beaten by the time of the invasion. My dad spent 551 days in combat and made 5 amphibious assault landing. More than any Marine serving in the Pacific. Specifically, North Africa, Anzio, Italy, Southern France and thev Rhine. His unit liberated Dachau. He says DDay would never had happened if the Germans had not suffered so many losses prior to the landing. On Anzio, American losses were very high. He said the only cover was dead bodies. He laid behind a dead soldier until nightfall from early morning pinned down by machine gun fire. Normandy invasion shortened the war surely, but the outcome was already established.
0c91b79437b0e602213a070c2fc739d0aa	I know it's a bit out dated, but have you actually tried opening an encyclopedia?    Think this through, WW II came to an end and suddenly there was an influx of hundreds of thousands of men coming home.  The military had to be suddenly downsized and the civilian market was inundated with men looking for work.  Women who were in the work force were expected to resign their positions and return to the traditional house wife roll.  Military contracts for weapons manufacturing were terminated, companies that had converted to weapons productions were left holding the bag and had to return to peace time production and the likelihood is, they were not given government money to retool.    Then came the Korean War and a sudden need once again for military build up.  Weapons that had been "moth balled" were pulled out of storage and made ready for combat once again.    And, while all of this was happening, there was still that bit about having to pay off both the war debt incurred by WW II as well as FDR's "New Deal."  Coal miner's strikes.  Rail road strikes...  Civil unrest.  It all played into the making of the American economy.

Sit out on some classes and write out your dance for extra practice or go over the dance in your head. Ice it for 15 min then let it sit for 15 then hot water for 15 again for awhile and that should work see a doctor if you think its something serious. And the rest is all natural i would recoded advil for the pain but not before you dance because it will numb the pain and you won`t know when to stop dancing because it won`t hurt so yeah the rest must be natural.|`|yerK8PJ9aa	mine took weeks to heal. i wa also practising leaps but at home and like i came down on it and for some reason my ankle just gave way and rolled to the side and cracked SOOO HARDD. omg. but i could walk on it after a week but it still hurts sometimes. rub some special cream on it i just rub dencarub. but its an australian product. go to the chemist. thye'll help. it should. i repeat.

The one with the sisters reading the book was a nice snap with a good POV and posing, but the older girl's hair is partially obscuring the little girl's face, and the direct flash is harsh and overpowering and creating harsh shadows, and the front edge of the book is too bright and attracts too much attention.   Imagine that shot redone without a flash, perhaps in front of a north facing window, with a reflector bouncing some light into the shadow side.  Hay Bales would have been my favorite shot, I love rustic country types of images.  But the exposure is way off, the sunny sides of the bales are all blown.

nQ3kFPMVaa	Never heard of them... but then, I haven't heard of all of the people out there. From the sounds of it, this place offers classes? In which case, no they won't get you an agent. But taking training will improve your skills, which will improve your chances of getting one. If the price is high, and they make promises of 'fame', then they are most likely a scam and not worth your time. If you *are* looking for fame, then I'm sorry, you should probably try something else.    EDIT: Ok, I went on a little hunt for info on Brightstars and this is what I found:    http://www.bubhub.com.au/community/forum...    Sounds suspect to me.    First off, check out local auditions at theatre.asn.au, or read up on Aussietheatre.com. If you're keen, pay for a membership at QuietOnSet.com.au or Artshub.com.au; they list heaps of auditions every day around Australia. Another good site is screenhub.com.au.    My best advice is to visit the first link, head to the FAQ section, and read about finding agents in Australia, how to find work, etc. It also has a lot of stuff about dodgy Aussie agents to avoid. There's heaps of free info there for new actors, and is practically the best place you can find info for emerging actors. There's also a huge list of companies that you can search by suburb. AGENTS DO NOT COST MONEY - IF THEY ASK FOR FEES UPFRONT, THEY ARE DODGY.    Visit www.alliance.org.au, the actor's union for Australia and join.    If you don't have experience don't expect a professional role or an agent. I suggest you use the next years to build up experience, and then try applying for a local uni course. Trust me, there are too many actors out there and not enough roles. Everyone wants to be in Home and Away and Neighbours; very few actually do it.    Those Aussie actors who are in Hollywood have spent the better part of 20 years developing their career - first in Australia, and then overseas. Do yourself a favour; take some classes and do some shows first.    Think about attending WAAPA, NIDA or VCA or one of the many great courses out there (there are heaps) when you're ready. You're in Sydney I'm guessing, which means you'll be competing with every NIDA actor in town; so do a lot of classes and shows before even trying to get an agent.    There's a lot of indie films being made in Australia, for which you can audition for without an agent; check the first link for examples, or Quiet On Set.     DON'T sign up for one of those American talent sites. They are scams and never have anything for Australian auditions.

WZNaNvplaa	Here's a few things to think about. 1) Rome started as a kingdom, and became a republic. US was ruled by a king and became a republic. 2) In the early years of rome, power was still held in the hands of relatively few people. Over the centuries, more people were brought into the political process. US, ditto. 3) Towards the end of the Republic, Rome began to develop a large "underclass of unemployed, undeducated people reliant on support by the State to survive. US, arguably the same. 4) Towards the end of the Republic, power once more began concentrating into the hands of relatively few people, and families. Some argue that this is occurring today in the US.       Where it gets hard to compare the two, is that the US has not gone through the process of converting to an Empire, as Rome did. Despite our military activities in various countries, and our economic impact around the world, the US has not sought out the same blatent imperialistic expansion that Rome did.  We still have changes in leadership peacfully, and don't have political coups overthowing the current "ruler". Also, unlike rome, the US makes its troops swear an oath to the constitution, and it's the state, not the individual generals, who pay the troops and see to their welvare. this helps prevent a lot of the problems the Romans ran into, especially in its Imperial days.     Some things we do suffer from. While the Romans faced invasion from tribes being pushed into Rome from the east, the US suffers an "invasion" from illegal immigrants. In both cases you have large numbers of people moving into a nation with a different culture and language, and who do not nessacarily want to integrate themselves into that culture. Rome increasingly recruited its troops from non citizen populations, relying more and more on their " barbaric" allies, while those of "pure" roman blood increasingly felt no obligation to serve the state., While this is not a major issue in the US at the time, it could be suggested that we are moving in that direction.     Both the US and Rome also faced pressures from competing empires/civilizations. Besides barbarians, the Romans faced Persia to the east. The US faces the economic growth of China, as well as India and the resurgence of Russia as potential foes.     Rome also suffered from certain disadvantages we don't have today. In the past, communications made it difficult to control the entire empire, or to ensure that troops and supplies could be moved about. Worse, towards the end of the empire there was a drop in the empire's population, especially in the west. The split of east and west was in part a result of the size of the empire and the problems of communications and travel mentioned earlier. With modern technology, these factors don't play as big a part in the US continuing.     Economically, Rome also suffered from decline. Partially because of population problems, partly because that once conquests stopped Rome found itself with a slave based economy that no longer had new slaves coming in. Eventually the later emporers attempted to "freeze" jobs in place, and helped lead to the beginnings of the fuedal and serf systems. In the US, economic issues may end up to our decline. When you're in debt, and the people holding the notes for that debt are not nessacarily your friends(China again), you risk an economic meltdown.  So, I hope some of this might helo you at least get an idea of where you want to go with your paper. good luck|`|7KcVSB3Uaa	Go to Barnes and Noble and leaf through a book called "Are we Rome?" You sound like you're in high school, so it might be a bit of a heavy read for you, but it's not a long book, and by just leafing through it you'll get more than enough material for your paper. Just be sure to cite the book as a source in your bibliography!

XvO4iLk0aa	G It's easy, use the LDK.  Life Decryption Key  By Generalist 12-08     Life often looks like a secret puzzle or an encrypted message, especially when we are facing problems. We need to decrypt the message and make some decisions.  The first is to decide if we want to control our lives, or want to rely on an outside force. The second is whether we believe that causes produce effects. This document is intended for people who want to be responsible for their lives, and who accept that causes produce effects. Effects are produced by causes and  we have to make the right causes to get the effects we want. Those who want to control their lives rationally and responsibly, and accept that effects are produced by causes, please read on.    Instead of guiding ones life by the flurry of concepts, hopes, fears, and aphorisms we learn, it is more effective to conduct daily life while using a concise, accurate and short set of reality descriptions. We need a mental key to make the jumble understandable and make decisions more accurate and easier to enact.     The key exists. It is intended strictly to improve the conduct of daily life. It is a primer on how to improve the here and now. The future will be determined by how we deal with the present.     The question naturally occurs, What are the right causes to optimize life for oneself and others?    Please write down all the words of intangibles that attach to life such as love, imagination, dreams, life, hope, fear, hate etc. Then write down all the words that relate to the tangible aspects of life. Think of brain, body, table, car clouds, air, soil, and on without limit. Yet, there is no mind without a brain. There is no car without thought. There is no wood for a table without the intangible life of a tree. The list of tangibles and intangibles is endless in English. However, the inseparability of tangible and intangible aspects is summed up in the words Myoho.      Write down all the words for causes you can think of and effects those causes can have. They are all summed up in the words Renge-Causes simultaneously produce effects like the flower and the seed of the lotus.    Everything is always changing. Write down all the words that come to mind about things changing-Clouds, faces, butterflies, concepts, memories and on and on. They are all summed up in the Japanese word Kyo. Because everything is always changing, no one is stuck where shehe is.       The three words Myoho Renge Kyo include every aspect of life and exclude nothing.     This formulation, used with focused intention, serves as a life decryption key to enable anyone to see the relationships that exist between good concepts and harmful ones. It was derived over thousands of years by brilliant people in India and China and finally used as the title of the Lotus Sutra in Kumarajivas translation of the Lotus Sutra. A 13th century Japanese monk named Nichiren recognized it for what it is and realized that anyone could guide their life better by using this key. He discovered the great treasure of life where anyone had access to it and dedicated his life to providing clarification and access.    The way to use it is to add the shortened Sanskrit verb for focusing intention and create Nam Myoho Renge Kyo. This is spoken repeatedly with the palms pressed together to close the energy circle and focus the mind-brain-body on the essential realities. It releases delusions and limitations as reliably as vitamin C cures scurvy.    Since we each have our unique paths and desires, there is no prescription for what people should focus on when they use the tool.  It is all available. The human mind has vast possibilities to explore once we resolve the confusion. There is no intent to move anyone to think in a certain way. There is definite intention to help human beings to think more effectively in ways that improve their individual and collective lives.  For more detailed information see   http://www.sgi-usa.org. Or  http://www.SGI.org    Caveat; SGI does not use the term life decryption key. That term is my attempt to summarize the essence of the philosophy taught by SGI.|`|DiRI58buaa	Well since its all made up, I guess anyway will work.

0sHfYEFhaa	yes, you will need a work permit to work on the jobs.  not sure about your state, but if you live in CA or NY, you will also need a coogan account.   work permits are not hard to obtain. I got mine through the school. I just took a copy of my birth certificate to the office, they checked my grade, the principal signed off on it, and then I had my doctor fill out a form and my mom signed it and returned it. I live in Pennsylvania, so it might be different in your area. I was also allready legal age (14) to start working, and you are not, so you may need to go another route.   Try here: http://www.bizparentz.org/  though it is for parents, it really has a TON of useful information on laws regarding underage kids working, tips, and really good stuff. haha.    break a leg!
L3hc9EOiaa	You need to check the laws for your country, but most countries, once the Birth Cert is signed that is it, unless your apply to the courts for the records to be corrected, you will need an approved DNA test result plus you may need a court order to change it if necessary. If the guy who signed the certificate is not the father, he may in fact get a court order to force you to change the name, and may also be entitled too claim against you, was there any question to paternity when the child was born? This can have a bearing on your and your childs rights later on. If he was unaware of a possible second Father/donor he has a much better chance of sucess in forcing you to change the childs name, better to get this settled early, before child is old enough to understand|`|DenLZAL1aa	If the man on the birth certificate turns out NOT to be the father, then he has a right to sue in court that his name be taken off the certificate. Depending on the state he may be able to have you change the last name of the child to your maiden name or to the real biological father.

GLS7vgAdaa	practicing in front of as many people as you can previous to your audition is a good tip. the number one thing i found that always helped me most was focusing on what's most important. before going onstage remember why you're there in the first place. you absolutely LOVE to perform, right? use any audition as a vessel in showing how much you love it! that's what directors, choreographers...etc. want to see anyway...so give them what they want! just think, it's another opportunity to be on a stage and to showcase your passion.    it's natural to be nervous and trust me when i say it gets better each time you do it. the key to conquering and overcoming your nerves is to be as prepared as possible by practicing as much as you can and to have the proper focus. remember YOU have the choice to either focus on what the auditioners are thinking of you the entire time you're singing or doing a prepared monologue or you can instead choose to focus on the incredible love and passion you have for your craft that, by the way, your auditioners share with you...and it might be comforting to know that they've been in your shoes once upon a time too. they understand how hard it is.|`|3ee64ee7ec766828c5143beacd3dc7f6aa	Too many folks at an audition can't get over the idea that they are being tested and judged.    Try remembering that you are going to audition to offer your skills and talent to people who are looking for just that.    Your audition is a present you're giving to them, free of charge. They may feel that what you offer isn't what they're looking for to fulfill their needs as far as casting the show, but that's not your problem.     Go in, make them a present of your gift of the best of yourself, and enjoy the giving.     Does Santa get nervous and shaky when he gives gifts?

xn93DAVqaa	Modern is the complete opposite of ballet as created by ballerinas who were sick of the pulled up control of ballet.  It uses the ground and has deep movements such as the contraction and there are many different techniques (most notably graham, limon, and horton).    Lyrical is a mixture of ballet and jazz, a more fluid and emotionally driven dance than jazz, but using much of jazz's technique.    Contemporary is the general name used to describe the wide variety of dances that fit within the modern and lyrical genres, and those that fit in somewhere in between.    hope this helped !|`|QtRQzVigaa	well... modern is more hardcore sliding on the floor almost opposite of ballet AND hiphop (kinda weird lookin stuff but really amazing), lyrical is a mixture between modern and ballet and contemporary is sorta lyrical but more leaning toward the modern side.|`|A7hq4SLKaa	Modern is really almost in between hip hop and ballet but not, and Contemporary is in between lyrical and ballet, lyrical is in between jazz and ballet but they are pretty close|`|yerK8PJ9aa	nothing. there the same thing but theres different names for it. contemporary is usually the most common.

dth0BsD7aa	Where do you live?  If you are in Los Angeles, there are a few studios you can go to for classes (I am guessing you want to do hip-hop or jazz funk): the Edge Performing Arts Center in Hollywood, Debbie Reynolds Studios in North Hollywood or Millennium (like Vanessa mentioned). Take classes from teachers like Tovaris, Nolan Padilla, Leslie Scott, Dante, Tucker Barkley, etc... and master classes from Napoleon & Tabitha, Brian Friedman, Wade Robson.    If you are not in LA, well I would say train a lot (try to be versatile in your dance styles, don't do only one style), and then move to LA, and do the above ;-)    Now when you say you want to dance in a music video, are you talking about big stars (Beyonc, Missy Elliott, etc...)? or any music videos?  1. For "stars", you'll need to work hard and get a dance agent (for a listing of agents, check out http://www.danceplug.com/insider-tips/re... An agent will send you to audition for these kind of jobs.  2. For smaller production videos, it's pretty much everywhere in LA, to find them, you can research, look at audition listings, meet people and make connections. They usually don't pay much, if not at all, but it's good to do a couple of these for the experience and fun as well.    Good luck :-)|`|1147fde3deacb66e77c8c89ab71de202aa	millenium dance complex in north hollywood, used to go there for a while.
i6d582PFaa	The divine is the essence of true art.     Art is about beauty, but beauty is subjective right? So how can multiple people think the same thing is beautiful if it is all subjective? That means that beauty is partly subjective in how a person views beauty but also objective based on its quality. Quality is a subjective term, but it has to be real, right?    If Quality was not real nothing could be beautiful. So just because an attribute is subjective does not mean it isn't real or not objective. Things of quality do exist. In fact perfection also exists. Most people erroneously claim that no such thing is perfect. But they are wrong. The mind itself is perfect. How else could it view all things and say of them that they are imperfect? It couldn't.     So the mind itself is perfect. Start to comprehend that.     The mind is immaterial, it is perfect because it has no material parts to it. When the mind becomes enchained to something material, it becomes less perfect because it is now conscious of something else other than itself. But the mind itself is perfect, so when the mind becomes conscious of itself by thinking about itself, you are conscious of consciousness, so thus it is "super-consciousness" or a higher state of consciousness.    So practice being conscious of the mind rather than of material objects. Turn your mind in upon itself and view the inner light that is illuminated by the mind. Normally this light illuminates the objects in the mind, but when it turns to the mind itself, it becomes fully illuminated and you see your true nature.|`|Kl4kv5khaa	Like black and white compared to color. Reality always wins out over what paint can do.|`|nGyOmjPsaa	"Divine perfection" is God.  And anything that us humans can produce in beauty is but the mimic of God's creation.  God bless+|`|In4WJAnRaa	Everything is a shadow of divine, which means that everything is an illusion of the reality that is creating it. A good piece of art could reflect the divine, like being in love is seeing the divine in another, but since beauty is in the eye of the beholder, it takes someone who can feel the divine when they look at the art.|`|U5nwTswfaa	it relates not to God, but to a school of thought called essentialism which postulates that every individual of whatever type of living thing is an imperfect copy of its spirit exemplar form. In later years the idea of spiritual form has been usurped by christians to mean the intention of God. Essentialism predates monotheism.  The work of art in this case is Nature.

vVTmJjJDaa	a lot! synopsis, from when she 1st enters to her final scene:    Mrs. Meers who runs the hotel, a former actress-turned-criminal has adopted the disguise of a kindly Chinese proprietress of the hotel to mask her real profession: white slavery. She thinks she is a wonderful actress but her Chinese accent is deplorable and her depiction of a hateful stereotype is held up to ridicule by real Chinese characters that appear later. Mrs. Meers gives Ethel a telegram saying that her great uncle has died and she is now-an orphan. Ethel is offered a cup of green tea that will "calm" her and dropping her accent Mrs. Meers makes a call and sells Ethel to Buddha for four hundred bucks.    Millie enters and is told she is behind in her rent and that she must leave and while she and Meersie are discussing the problem the ingnue-- clueless, old-fashioned beauty-- Miss Dorothy Brown enters. Millie makes a deal with her to share her room (as long as Dorothy sleeps on the floor). Miss Dorothy is excited to make the acquaintance of her first poor person ("How the Other Half Lives") and Millie says she is not poor just broke. But Millie has a plan. She a new woman, bold and daring, and she plans on marrying her boss. The only hitch is she doesn't have a boss yet. Mrs. Meers offers Miss Dorothy Ethel's room which has just recently become available and is delighted to discover that Miss Dorothy is an orphan.    Millie and Miss Dorothy head upstairs and in order to get the elevator going they must tap dance their way up They ascend as they chat happily.    In the laundry room of the hotel, Ching Ho and Bun Foo are folding towels when Mrs. Meers enters and tells Bun Foo to take Ethel to Buddha and collect the four hundred bucks C.O.D., A.S.A.P. and Ching Ho is to take a snack to the new arrival, Miss Dorothy. We discover the boys are working here to save money to bring their mother over from Hong Kong while they reprise (in Chinese) the song we heard from Millie ("Not For the Life of Me") when she first arrived in New York.    We next see Millie trying to get in to see Trevor Graydon the third who needs a stenographer and who is also single. Miss Flannery, the office manager, is clear that she thinks Millie is a "modern", something she doesn't like. Graydon turns out to be movie star handsome and gives Millie "The Speed Test" which she passes with flying colors and is now part of the team.    At the hotel, Ching Ho offers Miss Dorothy a room service apple which Mrs. Meers has injected with a large hypodermic needle. Ching Ho looks up and is instantly smitten with Miss Dorothy. Mrs. Meers is foiled by Millie and Alice's appearance and Miss Dorothy doesn't take the apple. Alone Mrs. Meers sings "They Don't Know" what an artist the theatre has missed when they didn't cast her.    Millie, Miss Dorothy, and the girls are looking for a speakeasy in which to celebrate Millie's job (she sees it as her "engagement"). There is one just under their noses it is pointed out to them by Jimmy who recognizes Millie. Since he is a member, he gets them in and tells them they are on their own. A wild dance ensues ("The Nutty Cracker Suite") and the joint is raided. While mug shots are being taken, Jimmy and Millie make one another's acquaintance and Millie learns that Jimmy makes do by flitting from job to job. Jimmy explains to Millie ("What Do I Need with Love") that he wants loads of gals and lots of yuks and he has a free and easy life. When he discovers that Millie is "in love" with her boss, Jimmy invites her and Miss Dorothy to Long Island to a ball game.    At the Priscilla, Mrs. Meers enters in a laundry cart sporting rubber gloves, surgical mask, scrubs, holding a rag and a bottle. She also chastises Ching Ho for losing his heart to Miss Dorothy but before she can follow through with her dastardly plan, Millie enters in a new dress and questions Mrs. Meers about the bottle. Mrs. Meers explains she was trying to get rid of a nasty spot on the carpet. She claims the bottle contains soy sauce. Millie has been seeing a lot of Jimmy and tonight they are going to a welcome home party for Muzzy Van Hossmere in her glamorous penthouse.    We meet the glamorous Muzzy singing the praises of the city ("Only In New York"). Muzzy is entertaining the elite of New York including George and Ira Gershwin and Dorothy Parker. George is stuck working on his symphony and when Muzzy tells Dorothy Parker she is a rhapsody in blue, George becomes inspired. Jimmy enters with Millie and Miss Dorothy and explains to Millie that his father was the gardener at Muzzy's Long Island estate. Miss Dorothy meets Rodney, an old friend from the orphanage and she, Jimmy and Rodney leave. Muzzy tells Millie her story of marrying for love the very rich and now deceased Mr. Van Hossmere.    During the dancing Millie spills champagne on Dorothy Parker's dress and while Millie goes for the soy sauce, Muzzy tells Jimmy that he is in love with Millie and asks what is going to do about it.    On the terrace, Jimmy calms Millie down after she stained Parker's dress and then the conversation turns to Mr. Graydon. They argue over Millie's plan and they are nose-to-nose when Jimmy grabs Millie and kisses her passionately. She responds and Jimmy exits in a panic. Millie sings that she is in love with Jimmy ("Jimmy") and the scene changes to the Priscilla as Millie catches sight of Jimmy leaving Miss Dorothy's room. Millie is in shock at the first act curtain falls.    Boop-boop-ee-doop and vo-de-oh-doh here we go again seeing if thoroughly modern Millie can heal her broken heart and forget Jimmy and marry Trevor Graydon. At work, Millie will not pick up the phone and talk to Jimmy and she tells herself to "Forget About the Boy". She is joined by the rest of the stenographers including the fanatic Flannery each of who have their own boy to forget.    Millie's flirting

Do your hair and makeup and everything else you would do for professional ones. And then after they call you in and everything, see if they are okay with the photographer and then go get your headshots done.

94bc2dec827aab848ba69cb5895f7ba6aa	Machiavelli did not exactly think 'morals should be removed from politics', but that the needs of the nation should stand above any moral code.    Leaders who especially showed this principle include: 1)Stalin, who saw his policies were causing great pain to his own people, yet knew this would be worthwhile in the long-term, 2) Boris Yeltsin, who administered economic 'shock therapy' to Russia, knowing it would be worthwhile in the long term, 3) Hitler, who broke the treaty of Versailles to rebuild Germany (sorry for listing all really AWFUL people so far), and 4) Vittorio Emmanuele Orlando, who broke Italy's treaties with   in wwi to side with the Allies.

You know the next book comes out on March 16!  It's called Maximum Ride: Water Wings.  Weird name.  Any way I think you might like The Mortal Instruments series by Cassandra Clare.  The books in the series are City of Bones, City of Ashes, and on March 24 right after Maximum Ride; City of Glass.  This series is soooooooo cool.  And if you like vampires cause I saw you read Twilight there are some in the series but it isn't really about them they are just part of it.|`|Y5qZCpl0aa	This maybe different from the other books you're into but  I read this book not to long ago called Me and Emma.

She wandered into the woods and sat on a log, and was thinking that if anyone happened to walk by on the path, there was no way they would see her since she was by a clump of ferns.|`|UtzALxfjaa	Really?

JPlVt9xYaa	I have had many great moments, I have been near death several times and I have four wonderful children. I have a beautiful marriage and the best life I could have ever asked for. The one thing that happened to me and it only happened once, was one time when I was troubled about helping my daughter over a very rough time and God, flooded my life with love, feeling and understanding with a message that has lasted me for eternity. People have often asked me what words does God use, I have to say, He doesn't use words, that is an earthly term. There were no words such as an American uses or was it in any human language. It came to me in a universal language of complete love, comfort and a wonderful feeling that impressed the information, that was being conveyed, into my soul. I am sure the moment lasted for a split second, but there is no time at that moment. I have to say, that no matter how I try to describe it in earthly terms, no matter how badly I want to convey that feeling, there is no humanly way possible. But, it does make for an unforgettable moment. If you are lucky, you too may have this wonderful experience someday.|`|9db251db6fb9ab5257ac294d2bac13b4aa	When my love reached his hand out to me and held mine.|`|DR9LPoYGaa	It was when my wife told me one day she was pregnant, after eleven years of continuous therapies.|`|q8b2ZyKWaa	you being my boy friend.love you for always.|`|ZJ2k7Ynqaa	Becoming a Christian in my late twenties.|`|Iub2QWaIaa	Sadly enough I think it was when my mom died.

I held her hand the whole time and talked to her. It's amazing the things you discover you need to say to someone when you realize you won't get another chance. She was unconscious and they weren't sure if she could hear us, but I know she could. She didn't respond to anyone or anything for days prior to that but a few minutes before she died she squeezed my fingers. She was in there. She heard me.

6MpoAh6Aaa	Hi!  Yes, I know, many people have been reporting Twilight questions, just because they are bored of it. But I think that it is the asker's choice on what to ask the question about, and that other people should just ignore the question if they don't like it. You don't have to react to everything!!! I think that it is really unfair! :(  About Midnight Sun...You don't NEED to read all 4 books to read it. It will not spoil anything for you. It won't help you to read the four books. Midnight Sun is just Twilight, but it is told by Edward. It is really good, you should read it ASAP!!! But I do recommend that after you have read the little bit of Midnight Sun, you should continue reading the series, because it is amazing!! I especially love Breaking Dawn, but I hate Jacob... If you are really interested in why, click on my profile. I have answered another question on why I hate Jacob, so you can read my opinion by clicking on the question and finding my answer. :)  Ok well I hope I helped (read it!!),  Bye!!,                      Twilight Addict|`|7QN9wetGaa	omg yes  read them all    is really good well in my perspective|`|tEF87mtMaa	You can read midnight sun now. It is just Twilight through Edward's eyes. I read it when I finished Twilight and it didn't spoil the others for me.|`|3WCXGRaGaa	no dont read it.. because SM is mad about that right there, fans arent caring about SM feelings at all!!!|`|43hzcys2aa	Oh yes, you have to, if not Edward cullen will stalk you and kill you.|`|mO1s4pMgaa	Yes, you should read all of the four books before Midnight Sun because Midnight Sun has a lot of info that you're suppose to find out as you read the four books in the Twilight series, but if you read Midnight Sun, it would just spoil everything.|`|9swGjwyMaa	YES!!!! u totally have to read the all of the Twilight books before Midnight Sun. if u don't it will be veyr confusing. u wont know how deep Bella and Edward's love is with each other!!! read ALL of them FIRST!!!!|`|ifYOXajoaa	Not Really. I mean all it is . is Twilight but in Edward's Prespective.  Though i didn't know Midnight Sun was out all ready....... LoL|`|w3yrnDEiaa	Midnight Sun is the exact same thing as Twilight|`|b27mXVzSaa	Do yourself a favor and put it down and forget the series ever existed.|`|XGFiIY9Eaa	you should read all of twilight books first because even though Midnight Sun is just twilight in Edwards point of view, it might ruin some of the suspense in their relationship later.  but they are all amazing! :)|`|3H71HPViaa	midnight sun isnt out yet and know you dont cuz its just twilight in edwards point of veiw|`|1Uk4kBwyaa	nope ofcourse not.....      it only goes upto the meadow scene in twilight....that kinda sucks tho...cos u don't get to the part where they kiss and all|`|nYtZQNuzaa	No you don't have to read all 4.  It's just better to read all four books first if not Twilight.  Jacob is better then Edward.|`|5wF7FOqwaa	No, you don't have to read all four Twilight books before Midnight Sun. Midnight Sun will basically be the same as Twilight, except in a different character's perspective. It all depends on what you think.|`|7eEEIJlcaa	no for midnight sun its not nessecary to read all of them because its just twilight in edwards perspective  i read it after i finished all of them but that was only because i didnt know about it before  but i actually recomend reading all of them first  i dont know why but i think its better not to stop reading when youre in the middle of the 2nd one  they are amazing! you should read all of them and then read midnight sun!  but thats just my opinion lol  i hope this helps!|`|SAQFsHEHaa	no, its okay. you dont have to read all four of the Twilight books to read Midnight Sun. Midnight sun is basically the first book Twilight, but whats different is that it's from Edwards point of view so you can read Midnight Sun now if you want.    Happy Reading =]|`|NwpGhT31aa	I mean I personally think its better to, but it isn't like you won't understand it because it's the first one in Edward's point of view. I would still wait though. That way when your done with them all of ther books you still have something to look forward to. I personally am waiting until the complete book is published before I read it as it is intended to. That's just me though. :  )|`|tuEu43YTaa	omg! i'm addicted to Twilight! no you don't have to read all four books to read Midnight Sun. Midnight Sun is Edward's point of view on how he met Bella.     i'm on my second time threw the third one. i hope you love the series! ^_^
REUqZfSeaa	The Trojan began after Helen left her husband Menelaus, King of Sparta, for Paris, a prince of Troy. Menelaus gathered together his allies; his brother Agamemnon, King of Mycenae, Odysseus of Ithaca, Achilles, and Ajax to name a few.    On the other side were the Trojans led by Prince Hector and King Priam.     The Trojan Horse was used by the Odysseus etc against the Trojans. After ten or so years of fighting the battle had entered a stalemate and Odysseus and co were still unable to get beyond the walls of Troy. The Trojan horse was built and Odysseus etc hid inside it whilst it was left on the beach. The ships of the Spartans etc left the coast to give the idea that they had given up and that the horse was left as a gift or peace offering. The Trojans celebrated their "victory" by bringing the horse into their city, and during the night those hidden inside crept out and destroyed the city, winning the war.|`|zh1IRIrHaa	according to the movie Troy starring Brad and Orlando..it was a war between the spartans and the trojans..odysseus was on the side of the spartans and he came up with the idea to trick the trojans with  a horse.|`|f8U0wLg7aa	Achaean troops clashed with, well Trojans. Odysseus fought with Achaean's and did develop the plan to make the Trojan Horse, which did indeed lead to the downfall of Troy. Odysseus was known to be very clever and filled with pride. It was his pride that got him into trouble, as he would often tell the gods how he was the mightiest of all and did not need them. Then he would rely on his clever mind to get himself out of any situation that may present itself to him.    Hope I helped?
2QPUs8lBaa	Oooh i love answering questions like this =D    So yeah, she sounds a little ordinary. Good grades, good looks, good boyfriend, good major. She has a pretty good life besides her dad. It sounds like that is what you are going for though - a plain old ordinary girl. I like what you have so far.    I like how you have that she eats alot, even though she is reletively thin. I like it when characters have that flaw. To give your character some personality, think of a habit that really annoys you. Is it cracking your nuckles? Picking at your cuticles? Biting your fingernails? Twirling a piece of hair? Clicking a pen? Chewing gum? Rocking back and forth? Biting your lip? I think you should pick a nervous habit for her. It would help develop your character.     What kind of music does she like? What is her guilty pleasure? Pigging out on icecream when she's down on herself? Ask yourself some questions. Really get to know your character - know what she is doing in the scenes you don't write about. If you wrote about her first day of school, then skipped to morning, you should have a pretty good idea about exactly what she did in the mean time. You should be able to know every detail about her by the time you are done.    I was watching a show the other day and I came across something I really like - in the show Joan of Arcadia, Joan had a talent at rock paper sizors. Even if she didn't look, she could win at that game every single time she played it. She never lost. Give your character some random talent like that =] It would be fun and creative.    When her hair gets wet and she lets it air dry, it starts to frizz. She gets nervous when she even sets eyes on a roller coaster. If she even looks at carrots she will gag. Have some random facts like this in there.    Have you thought about a name yet? If you already have one set, then completely ignore this paragraph. But, if you are still looking, read on. I think the name Julia really fits her. I dont know why, but I think it suits her. If you don't like Julia, then maybe Amy or Joan. I think a sweet short name would suit your character well.    I wish you the best luck with your story - if you want any more imput you can email me. I love giving help like this =]|`|b27mXVzSaa	I suppose you have to take certain aspects of your personality and either add to them or decrease them.  Every author has a character they have put a bit (or a lot) of themselves into, like an artist doing a self-portrait.  Still, it's not advisable to put someone who is just you in the place of main character.  Think of things you would/could never do or say and give her the characteristics of someone who WOULD do that.  As for the part of you you want to put in her, think about an aspect of your personality that you like/hate and explore those parts of your personality through her.    I hope that makes sense...my sleep deprived brain isn't running full-pace right now.|`|S9jyc95jaa	To me, a Mary Sue character generally represents the 'ideal' character that the author wishes to be... from your description, your character is beautiful and sweet and everyone likes her.  I'm guessing that the conflict is going to relate to her alcoholic dad or her insecurities with not being wealthy?    To lessen the Mary Sue-ness, make her imperfect.  Give her some real character flaws that she can work to overcome as the story progresses.  And a character flaw OTHER than being insecure, because there is really nothing more irritating than a gorgeous perfect character whose only 'flaw' is basically being humble.    The most dynamic and memorable characters are always the flawed ones.  And by definition, Mary Sues usually aren't flawed.  That sounds like your biggest problem to me.|`|70jNDiIiaa	In all honesty, she sounds pretty boring - too normal, too bland. Give her a Major Flaw, something really bad. That'd add spice, and suddenly she'd be incredibly interesting.     Maybe she has a dreadful phobia of birds, or thunderstorms, or the sound of bagpipes, or the colour pink, or the sight of blood. Read through books about phobias - you'll find some people are terrified of the most bizarre things.    Maybe she has some weird compulsion - she has uncontrollable urges to laugh in the most serious situations, or she has to cut her food into 144 tiny pieces before she can bring herself to eat it.     Or maybe she has a deep, dark secret that she wouldn't even share with her closest friends - maybe she accidentally killed someone, and has to live with the guilt. Or maybe she has pyromaniac tendencies, and once set the local church on fire but never got caught.    Obviously you'd have to delve into her psychological make-up - stuff in her childhood made her what she is today (same goes for us all!) But a character with a dark past can be the most riveting type to read AND write about.    Good luck, and have fun!  Cheers,  Hafwen.

AA10062179	I have my own philosophical system, I guess. Hope to make it a school of thought one day :) my ambition!    It's basically the Science of Lights. It is the idea that all that there is, is light. By light I do not mean 'photons'. Just a metaphysical term for a 'something' that gives existence to everything around us.   Light is the unity of the world. The different grades and shades of light is what causes the differences. All these grades and shades are simply "limited light". Therefore, they require a source, which is Absolute. This Absolute is Purer than Light, because it creates light from nothing.   Our epistemology is that we are light, and we give existence to what is around us. That is why we see/hear/touch what WE see/hear/touch and nothing else. It's because they are lit up by us.   Our ethics must be to manifest according to our limits - meaning, we manifest according to how we were intended to manifest. Therefore, we must acknowledge that we are only one part of a whole, and that we must fulfill our whole.   Aesthetics, beauty-wise, we are all striving for the Absolute. We love anything that gives us "power" for the Absolute is powerful, or "knowledge" for the Absolute is knowing, or "creativity" for the Absolute is creative, or "love" for the Absolute is loving, or "justice" for the Absolute is just, etc. We love music because it is in harmony, and because it elevates us - it affects our emotions and it allows us to swim in our passions. This is essentially beautiful, because our emotions are what we are. It is our essence. We are what we emotionally feel. We believe that what we feel is important to us. Love, hatred, jealousy, hope, fear - these feelings are felt deep within us, and they motivate us and harness our thoughts and actions. It is beautiful, but it can also be tragic and sad. Yet it is beautiful, because it is based in "desire" and "desire" is beautiful in itself. However, "desire for the Absolute" is the purest and most ecstatic demonstration of this desire.   This "desire" and "love" is a second-type of light - it is like the sun and the sunflower, where the latter seeks the former, but never attains it. This "love" is the reason for creation, and it is the same as "generosity". The Absolute, out of love and generosity created other things so that they may love and be generous. This second-type of light is more like a flame that is pleasurable. When an individual catches the fire of love, they burn themselves in hope of becoming ashes, and then rising to meet the Absolute. In the same way, the Sun focuses on dry wood, lights it, and the fire reduces it to ashes, and the ashes sly freely toward the sun. They are free now.   Now, this is a very simple and mystical interpretation of my philosophy. I do have a logical foundation for it, as well as a more traditional way of presenting it. However, I thought that this way I will be able to capture the actual spirit of my philosophy.     I do hope that one day soon I can write books on this. I am very disillusioned by Academic philosophy which I am studying in university. I would like to change that if I can. Who knows? Ambition, eh?|`|eezP5wQ2aa	...be confident and responsible for all my choices and actions in my life....  ...thanks for asking...|`|nM7xmhgiaa	To find out  'Who am I?'|`|77Nn0gWRaa	that God went too hard on that guy he was testing his faith on (from Tuesdays with Morrie)    that if God can test our faith in him, we should have equal rights and be able to test our faith in him.|`|GNqQnAy9aa	Love myself mentally, as much as possible, so that I can love my fellow human as myself.

People know it's hard to get up in front of others, and they'll forgive any mistakes.<br>  <br>  That said, it sounds like you've already got it memorized, which is a great start.  Now, PRACTICE!  Recite the poem on the stage where you'll be performing, if you can.  Otherwise, practice it in as many different places as you can:  bedroom, bathroom, garage, backyard, friend's house, sidewalk, wherever.  Rehearsing (for such a short time)in only one place makes you more comfortable in only that one place and can throw you off when you're somewhere new.<br>  <br>  If you're nervous in front of others, trying out your poem in front of friends or family a few times can help, too.<br>  <br>  You can also "get in character" to a degree.  Think about your poem as something that you're saying to someone (real or imaginary), and then imagine that person at the back of the audience or somewhere above their heads.  Then think about delivering your poem to that person.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|GmF4iAFXaa	Be confident. Laugh loads and smile loads with your friends before you perform. Try not to look at the audience when you first go on. If you do look, smile. Be confident because no-one is going to laugh if you mess up. But of course you won't mess up! Also, revise your lines the whole while you talk and laugh with your friends. <br>  Feel confident! You can do it!!! :D|`|zXIhB8Ycaa	Keep in mind that mistakes are what make things memorable.  Think about weddings.  It's the same for recitals, plays, and so much more.<br>  <br>  Don't go out there and try to make mistakes, but know that it's certainly not the end of the world.<br>  <br>  If you have a few moments to talk before reciting the poem...admit the nerves almost as a disclaimer.  People will understand.|`|Sk0CGPx7aa	Pretend the audience is a mirror. Act like your just watching yourself. Speak loud, and clear.<br>  Hope this helps!<br>  -Moo

Harry Potter is still loved, but you gotta admit the craze has died down a bit. Besides it's unfair to give Twilight it's own section (especially since this awfully written book shouldn't even deserve it's own section, because the story is so pitiful, but that's just my opinion) because it wouldn't be fair that other specific books, TV shows, and movies don't have there own section.

And the hype will still be there and then SMeyer said she'll continue writing Midnight Sun after all the hype dies down so when it's written and published, there'll be more hype .. and then she said she might write a spin-off series about Renesmee and Jacob .. so basically, Twilight will never end.  And I believe it isn't a fad, that's what critics first said about HP and it's still going strong :)|`|ZW24GerXaa	idk if it will die down ne time soon becuz New Moon is coming out this year, so pl wont shut up about that, and then Eclipse will be out next year so they will talk even more about that. i think it would b great to make a twilight section just for twilighters tho. that way pl can post non-twilight related questions here.

yaq7oaH6aa	How deep have you looked into ALL the consequences of the   action in question?  Have you considered that as a member of a society, you have   certain obligations that you might be unable to fulfill if you reduce   your capacity to do so?  You mention:  Drug use - You subsidize violence and corruption.  Prostitution & Gambling - The same.  Sex before marriage - Harmless, only if you are sufficiently mindful  of your own and your partners welfare, (both emotional and physical).

Morality is a code of morals created and defined by *society, *philosophy, *religion, or *individual conscience.  It is held to be authorative in matters of right and wrong. (Wikipedia)    Immorality/morality is what society, or a general group of people have decided to be right and wrong.  *You as an individual may choose to have your own views of right and wrong.  However by definition, to change an action's view from immoral to moral, you would have to change the general public's view.If the action violates their view of right and wrong, then it is considered immoral.      *Like mindedness is a key function of any organization, society, civilization...|`|UJtUpWO0aa	Why ask questions if you don't want to hear other responses?

What about children forced into the trade? How would legalization stop either one (historically it hasn't)    Where did the cocaine come from and how many were harmed in it getting to you? Legalized drugs would expose more people to them and more potential addicts.    Make the question more simple. Helmets for those that ride motorcycles. Take "it's my own choice what to do with myself" that's fine until your head hits the pavement. Then you become a public liability. Requiring insurance to ride sans helmet doesn't help. How many drive with suspended license now? Leaving you on the side of the road won't cut it. Public opinion and the simple hazard of debris on the road would be an issue. Oh yes, the public health issue of your remains.    Many point to prohibition when talking about legalizing drugs. First alcohol use significantly dropped during Prohibition and didn't rise to the former level for many years. Finally did legalizing alcohol solve all the alcohol related problems?|`|nGyOmjPsaa	Maybe it doesn't harm another but it would harm you.  And you are just as important and loved as the next.    Immorality is distancing yourself from God by hurting Him.  Think of a relationship of two people.  Say a marriage.  There are rules in there to make the marriage, the love, work.  Rules that are as huge as fidelity and as minor as never putting your wet towel on the carpet after showering.  If the rules/convenants are broken, then the relationship is hurt.  A relationship with God is similar but not limited to this.  There are ten commandments that He has asked us to obey (just like in marriage) and if we go against them then it could be called immorality.  This is why doing something that is against these ten commandments is considered immoral.  Because it's hurting God and at the same time it hurts yourself because we are not made to take the good out of things (evil).  We were made to love and to be loved and if we are going against this then we are ultimately hurting ourselves.  God bless+    I'm sorry I have offended you.|`|J8kMyPFuaa	Fornication does harm another person.

I suggest looking at "On Liberty" by john stewart mill. He argues that an action cannot be ILLEGAL if it does not harm another human being. There is a difference between immoral and illegal, and its open for interpretation. Everyone has there own definition of immoral. One might say it is immoral to drink on sundays, because that is what their religion says. But, if i do it in my own home, out of my own glass, and don't bother them, who are they to judge what i do?|`|wYo0adH1aa	by hurting yourself, you can hurt the people who care about you.|`|mlE89Jvaaa	well it depends whos morals youre going by...|`|PJM71Izjaa	ok for the drug example, you personality might change-you can become more aggressive etc and that will affect your family and friends which in turn is considered a selfish act and therefore immoral (according to society).|`|AA11370093	Hi, Marcy!    Well, you asked this question in the Philosophy section, so you're going to get a philosophical answer.    Your question and subsequent explanations are incoherent and I'll show you why.    You ask, "How can an action possibly be considered immoral if it does not harm another being?"  Implicit in that question is the assertion that harm to another is wrong (immoral).  Why is harming another wrong?  Where did you get that standard and why should others obey it?  Logically, you have limited options:    a)  Yourself.  b)  Society.  c)  Universe.    If your morality comes from you alone, then there is obviously nothing wrong with an action if it doesn't harm another.  However, given this standard, *nothing* is wrong whether or not harm is inflicted upon another.  If morality is merely your private preference, then another's preference may be to inflict harm or to prohibit self-harm.  The only basis for your objection is your bias.  Personal bias has no rationally compelling force.  To say somebody is wrong for exercising their bias undermines the appeal to your own.    Your second option is society.  However, societal morality is merely group bias.  It is substantively no different than personal bias.  Most societies have decided that inflicting unjustified harm upon another is illegal (or immoral), but most societies criminalize the use of certain drugs and either prohibit or strictly regulate gambling and prostitution.  You cannot consistently appeal to societal morality to oppose things like slavery while objecting to societal morality when it bans the use of cocaine.  On what basis will you object to the ban?  You can only appeal to yourself, society or a Universal Law.  As stated, your bias is just that -- yours.  Lots of people have other biases.  You can then appeal to society, but then you end up appealing to the very thing you criticize.  You cannot ascend the rope of society only to deny the rope can be so used.    The only other option you have that rescues your question from contradiction is an appeal to Universal Law (Morality).  In other words, society must accept your argument because it appeals to something higher than bias.  Since you are an Atheist, there is no Universal Morality.  How do the random actions of atoms produce universal moral prescriptions?  What is it about the Universe that *rationally* refutes philosophies like Might Makes Right?  Rome thrived for a thousand years while trumping the rights of others.  The United States thrived while practicing slavery and robbing Native Americans of their property and lives.  Since there isn't such a thing as Universal Morality under an Atheistic paradigm, 'c' is not a valid option.    Consequently, nothing is immoral.  Perhaps that is what you believe, but if that is the case, then there is nothing wrong (logically speaking) with stigmatizing and criminalizing self-harm.  That's why your question is incoherent.  To make it work, you have to appeal to a standard you reject.    If you'd like to discuss this further, I welcome your emails.    Kind regards,  Scalia|`|FoIxsunVaa	Every action has innumerable consequences. When I drank, I felt my family was not harmed by it, because 1) they drank too, and 2) I stayed away from them when I was in a bad way.    My staying away was a consequence of my actions. If I do something that "takes me away" from what i would have been doing otherwise, that is a consequence for hundreds of people who are in my acquaintance.    Also if my behavior damages MY personality, anyone who encounters me is lessened. How is that not a moral question EVEN IF IT HARMS NO ONE DIRECTLY.    Your question is based on the assumption that people are autonomous entities that barely effect one another without clear and major intent. My frown or smile walking down the street affects strangers greatly, which is why I try never to smile.    *smiles*|`|AA11564934	"immoral" is an illusion, the term, upon real examination, has no meaning.|`|SMvTq4fZaa	"Harm" is such a vague term. As was said , we don't live in a vacuum, and so every action we take affects someone else in some way.    My personal definition of "immoral" is based not so much on harm as it is on force.    For example, if you assault, rape, trespass, or steal from somebody, you've harmed them. This is an immoral act because you've committed force against them.    On the other hand, if you go to the mall and find a close parking spot, you've "harmed" the person behind you who had intended to take that spot. Because of your act of taking that spot, the other person now has a longer walk from their car to the mall entrance than they otherwise would have had to because of your actions. But this "harm" is not an immoral act because you haven't committed force against anyone. (This example doesn't apply to Handicaped, or otherwise restricted, parking spaces.)|`|YmtNel5haa	In rational absolutism if you do something without having a good will it is considered immoral.  For example, if a man helps an old lady with her groceries so he can rob her, but inside her house is some people so he can't rob her.  She wasn't harmed but he was behaving in an immoral fashion.  Of course she doesn't know that his intentions were to rob her so she doesn't think of him as immoral.  But because of his true intentions he is immoral.  Does that make sense?  Hope it helps.edit- I didn't realize this was about drugs.  you should consider the effects that it would have on your family.  drug abuse always effects family members.  If you don't care about the effects that it WILL render on your body you should consider how your actions will affect your family.  And they will.  Haven't you ever seen intervention?|`|eCZ6YW4Paa	You can violate your own morality which would make an action immoral.     There are also standards that society has deemed immoral. This is just them judging others (which I consider to be immoral). An example of this is a family that has a private yard and skinny dips in the pool and hot tub. Some would feel this is immoral even though it doesn't have any effect on another person.|`|QDFj9JPfaa	...without knowing what "action" you are referring to, the answer becomes nebulous...

I'll go with the most difficult area the Conquistadors faced: Tenochtitlan  According to Bernal Del Castilla, who was there during the conquest of Mexico, the natives were very advanced in their weaponry:  1. Two sided broad swords with obsidian blades.  2. Very thick, interwoven cloth shields  3. Atlatl (spear thrower)  4. Fire hardened spears  5. Obsidian tipped spears, darts, bolts, and arrows  6. Stragetic warfare using nature (landslides, rockfalls)  7. Strategic warfare, manmade: (parapets, fortresses)  8. Fire  9. Deadfalls  10. Animals  11. Advanced hand to hand fighting  12. Stones  13.Stone throwers  14.Captured weapons|`|PuhcRApBaa	Q:What kinds of weapons did they use to defend themselves against the Spaniards?     A: In the 1500s, the Spaniards brought with them to Florida an early form of smooth-bore long arm called the Arquebus, as well as cannon, with which they tried to conquer the Maskk? tribes of the Southeast. The Seminoles' ancestors had spears with flint or bone or cane tips, war clubs studded with sharks' teeth, and bows and arrows. The Spaniards learned very quickly that their "superior" weaponry was not really a match for the bravery and firepower of the Indians and their weapons. Fire-hardened, cane arrows could pierce Spanish armor. The Spaniards soon began to discard their European armor in favor of Indian-style quilted textile coverings. The horse, which the Mikiski speakers called ich? chob? or "big deer," was fearsome to the ancestors of the Seminoles. But these Maskk? warriors were the fiercest that the Spaniards had encountered anywhere in the Americas and they were not frightened by the Spaniards' weapons

Mig6O93Naa	there are no jobs for teens in spite of what you see on TV.  if you want to be an teen actor,your parents have to make it happen because  you cannot conduct business or enter into a contract until you are 18. Portland is a terrible place to try to become an actor. You do not need head shots until you have an agent.  You cannot get an agent , your parents have to get one for you. But it is a waste of time as there is little going on in the business because of the recession., No it is not worth thousands of dollars to take acting classes ,but there are classes that are better and more reasonable than JR Powers and the other scams. What you need more than classes is experience, tons and tons of it , be in a hundred plays, then you have experience. Being in plays is how all actors train. Do it.
j5Apt8hWaa	The new DSLR's are capable of producing excellent images when shooting JPEG-Fine ... how ever in difficult lighting situations, shooting RAW+JPEG Fine will assure you can process any of the RAW files into either high quality JPEG, PNG or TIFF files.  You  never know when shooting stock shots, what the ultimate use will be.   When you shoot both, you can edit using the JPEG files and then once you have the best of the best edited (sorted), you only have to process the RAW files that fall into the BoB images.    With memory cards so inexpensive, you can afford to buy a couple of 4 GB cards and go for the gusto.|`|AA10187219	It depends on your goals and your level of need to 'tweak' an image.  If you are happy with how your camera creates jpgs, then why bother with raw?    All photos (ALL, really) capture the image in raw,  then the camera converts the image to whatever level of jpg that you have set as the default.  The problem is, raw captures far more data than is needed for jpgs and this data is thrown away during conversion.  So jpg does limit your ability to alter things later.    Another issue with jpg is that jpg is a 'lossy' format.  Each time you save a jpg (not open, just save -after opening of course), the image degrades ever so slightly.  It will take hundreds, if not thousands of saves for you to notice, but the the damage is real and can add up if you aren't careful.    But all this is irrelevant if you basically like how your jpg photos look and you only do minor editing one time.  The whole point is to get a 'done enough' photo that you can share.  If jpgs do that for you, then using raw is just a bunch useless steps IMO.    Me? I shoot raw.|`|at61Qn9xaa	Will the quality be different YES  Every time you work and save a jpeg file you loose color information and quality.

This way you have a preserved raw files in case you did not like what you did to the files you have and want to start fresh.

Also, make sure you capitalize your names, and the beginning of sentences.<br>  <br>  <br>  “fine Elliot”Byron blew harder at his pipe<br>  Blowing into it would just send a shower of sparks and ash all over the carpet. You suck air in, then blow out the smoke, not through the pipe.<br>  <br>  These are just technical things, though, not a big deal. Mostly, your writing is pretty good. Work a bit on characterization. I don't know anything about these men, and as such, I find it hard to care about them at all. Make Byron a little more sinister, and Elliot a little easier to relate to. I like that he's in his pajamas, it makes him seem defenseless. Very good there.<br>  <br>  You definitely show a lot of promise as an author. Keep writing and reading and editing. Good luck!<br>  <br>  Oh, just noticed one more thing. Why is the key to this door in his pajama pocket, especially if it's quite heavy and awkward? That's odd. Was he expecting this guest?
VMVW3E7Aaa	Yes, it sure sounds great, doesn't it?    Can you imagine just how incredibly GOOD you'd have to be? There are milllions of people around who think of themselves as "photographer" just because they've taken a few snap shots. Newsflash: those are not the people who get those sorts of jobs.    Can you imagine just how incredibly LUCKY you'd have to be? There are many very good photographers around, but precious few dream jobs like that.    If you're serious about it, start working on those skills, and start praying.

Look around at the different galleries and pick one where you think your work will fit in. Call and find out what their guidelines are. Some galleries may have special applications to be filled out, others may have certain days only for portfolio viewing. Prepare your art resume and portfolio to the best of your ability. To get into a gallery, you have to present yourself in a very professional manner. Be sure to invest in business cards as well. And then call for an appointment as per any guidelines.

GqrRBZ3faa	No.  SM said a long time ago (before the fangirls took over) that she may write more books, but by other characters' points of view. She would go off on others' stories. Like maybe Rosalie and Emmett leave for good and she writes about their life. Or about Renesme and Jacob (probably the more likely).  Because the only thing she is good at is draining this franchise for everything she can.|`|J7o7FtZdaa	Not in Bella's perspective no.

2QPUs8lBaa	I don't quite remember if this is from the first book or not, but I know she has always had a very strange taste in clothing. I know in later books she gets her clothes from the Salvation Army - maybe you could make a list of her favorite clothes, favroite nail polish colors (lime green, bright blue, black, etc). Doesn't she also like the food popcorn with mustard? Because claire was on the phone with her and she was crunching. I think that's in the first book. You could also have a picture of claire and her with a heart in between because they are best friends. Doesnt layne also like hello kitty? And she had a bag that had speakers and everything.     Sorry that these things are a little random. But i just wrote down everything I could remember about layne.

The only person who gets the manuscript is your editor. It's her own damn fault, but instead of being a grown up about it and sucking it up and writing it anyway, she's throwing a hissy fit like a five year old and refusing to writing anymore for awhile... from what I've heard, I've heard that she's never going to finish... thank God for that.|`|38eb78ef54653766c3ca71d79051901caa	Use the dang SEARCH BAR!!!

59kGOjcSaa	Well, okay. I agree its poorly written, BUT I still like the series.  Stephenie Meyer ain't the best writer ever. There a lots of other writers better than her.  I don't agree with you about the example to the teens. The sex things.  She did NOT tell the details about the sex. Only how the kiss felt like. Disgusting?  Well, have you read "The Earth, My Butt & Other Big Round Things"? Go to the library and turn on the Chapter 8. I think that is so much disgusting and a bad example.    Ahhh, its a fiction anyway. Why do you care?  Use the search bar next time. Millions of people already ask this.|`|LwywrSRkaa	You said it! I totally agree I couldn't believe it when people who never read books suddenly wanted to read it. I don't like Bella not even in the movie, in fact she was worse in the movie. All this rubbish about it, it was hardly horror! It's just that some kids can't even read kids books, then going onto adult books it's like WTF, at least try proper teenage books! And to say she is the best writer ever then that to me it means they haven't read any books by truly great authors!|`|OGEC7RFwaa	i agree with you most readers are young, but hear me out. i am 16 and i am a fan of the series. i think the real reason you have a big problem with it is because people have become obsessed with it and have taken the whole "i love edward cullen" thing way too far. i would write more but i have to go, sorry.|`|VBmEhDdfaa	omg yes! i hate it when people obsess over it!!!!!!! i mean i kinda got sucked into the  series but seriously?, get a grip people??!?!|`|oCZCkaWraa	Actually a good book... for obsessive teenage girls. But overall, it's a cliche, okay book, gets boring often, and awkward (this is coming from a teenage girl myself) Yeah I don't get the vampire thing myself, and in school I'm always hearing about Edward Cullen, ugh.|`|6TPEyJqhaa	I think that's harsh.  You need to be a little open minded with the books because they are really good.  Don't forget that Catcher in the Rye is considered a revolutionary book but it has a lot of bad language and talk about sex.  And I also don't think you should criticize the writing ability of someone unless you could really do better (which I don't think you could).|`|wQ5kZrPHaa	I think it is a shame society these days are corrupt and these Twilight books are appauling. it shows that our society has gone violent. and unfortunatly for you i have been corrupt as well and im going to get you!|`|YRSvhWfVaa	Way to go, you stated the obious!|`|GhLcKwmYaa	maybe|`|dXs0A2xlaa	I AGREE COMPLETLEY! the movie was bad too.|`|jNzkN6Rnaa	I LOVE TWILIGHT!!!!!!!!! :( poo on you :P|`|BpcAVgEeaa	Sadly, yes, it is a horrific example to youngsters-I mean, like you said, 10-year-olds are reading this garbage! Most, I repeat MOST, people say that Twilight is the best book they've ever read because it's the only book they've ever read-thus, Stephenie Meyer, in their eyes, is the "best writer ever." It's completely ludicrous, if you ask me. I am appalled that the youth of today are believing that love, relationships, and behaviour are supposed to be like what they read in Twilight. It's a terrible message that I in no way support.|`|r6vbAM1Eaa	ikr  lol some ppl just cant handle that stuff.|`|z36j8rmRaa	I agree!    However, as someone has pointed out in "Answers" before.  It's a good story not a good book.    I can't bring myself to read past the first chapter.  "was,was,was" all over it!  I think you know what I mean.    Check out the first link below.  I think you'll like it!|`|K22b6fr6aa	omg just shut up....    if you dont like Twilight dont ask questions about it!!|`|Qh5Pollvaa	yeah but it says "not suitable for young readers"    plus kids are doing it at 7 years old nowa days!!    ^-^|`|12xBKdkqaa	Thank you, Captain Obvious.|`|Z4PxfObXaa	I agree.|`|frwUHuZlaa	yeah every twilight book is stupid what is so cool about reading about a vampire in love with a human and it is scared to bite her what a dumb thing to write|`|5j9bRHs9aa	I'm a teenager. It didn't make me want to have sex at all.  Most people don't think about it that way. It's just a love story.  And lot's of young adults read it. Not just little kids.|`|mzhFrm5Taa	Its not ''badly written''... its just the world though a girl called Bella's view, her view might be one you may not agree with but it surely doesn't mean its badly WRITTEN. And if it was this bad, theres no way it would have been such a phenomenon.|`|ZtECjEPyaa	i agree. kids all around the world are just NOW starting to read them because of that stupid movie that came out. when they read it they think of the character that they're so obsessed with. its annoying and stupid for kids to be so obsessed WITH A BOOK.|`|hYRP0x2Eaa	The book is poorly written, and SMeyer went to University. She wasted her damn money if all she could produce was that crap.    Bella is a self centered lonely loser who cannot even walk without tripping over her own two feet.    Edward is a fake and a bad example of what a vampire is really perceived as.    All in all, an over rated book that sucks donkey balls.    And to all who are saying Twilight is a good idea in general...Get real. A vampire falling in love with a human has been done many times, as well as the feud between vamps and W-wolves. She is not original.|`|iaDhbBQQaa	The only reason why I think everyone is so obseessed with the book is because Stephanie Meyer did a really good job at creating a character like Edward. I can't say I enjoy her writing style, but I think the concept of the book is good. I have to say Bella is obnoxious.|`|5vaBqfDIaa	Ya, she sucks at writing. Big time. But the whole 'true love' thing is what everyone's crazy about. People want to find their gentlemanly Edward and live happily ever after. Pre-teens are the only ones who'll fall for that...   Don't forget a lot of Meyer's mormon values come through the books (like abstinence before marraige and stuff), so it's not a bad influence|`|Wme29krvaa	People who are 10 have no business reading Twilight. Seriously you shouldn't read it until your at least 13. But anyway, I'm not saying Stephenie Meyer is the best author or that Bella is the absolutly most perfect human/vamp ever. I like the love story. End of story.     I'm so sick of all this "I hate Twilight" crap. If you don't like it, good for you. I'm not going to tell you to change your mind, but "Twilight Haters" are just as annoying as "TwiHards." Everybody asks pointless questions and nothing ever gets solved. So why bother?  =\    I'm sorry if I sound rude, but I really don't understand...|`|7es1yEVmaa	i totally agree  i mean itz boring and dull  i don't knoe y everyone is obsessing over it|`|90zIsbWWaa	I totally agree with you, Twilight is the worst series to be ever written. Harry Potter is better.|`|iOW2aLeGaa	ok heres my opinion    ok yeah it is badly written and there is loads of spelling mistakes. But im not to botherd about that. I like the books because the story line, and how Bella and Edwards relationship builds through each book.  I also like how theres competition between Edward and Jacob, and how i get to see how difficult it would be to choose over the to people you love.     And when i read a book i like, you get to go into a world of your own. I mean like vampires arnt real are they? So its nice to go into a world were they do and you get to see what it could be like if they were real.    Ok so the book isnt all about sex is it? I mean Bellas 18. Of course shes going to want to have sex, and i dont think its that bad for her to do it with someone shes going to spend the rest  of her life with.  It dosnt matter that Edwards a vampire, the point of vampires being put into the story is to show the forbidden love.   And when they have a baby, that just chose that nothing can come between them and that they will stick together through everything.    And yes im 12.  x    EDIT: Anyway would you rather teens read and obbsess over a book they love. Or would you want them to go round drinkng and smoking nd tken drugs.  Because if you dont want people to enjoy a book then youve got a problem.  No one has the same opinion. If they did then the world would be boring.    And the book carnt be THAT bad or it wouldnt of been published- or turn into a film.  so id re-think if i were you.|`|nutnQbMLaa	okay first of all, teens don't have to read these books.    Second, vampires aren't real, so the teens cant have sex with them either.  And third of all they don't mention sex in the book its just like this..                                        *          *          *  people choose to read these books. they don't have too. and they are not all 12.|`|Ipp8lU6Laa	Yes, I completely agree with you. It is so overrated. it gives out a bad message to young teenagers and is rather disturbing.  Bella is a whiny brat|`|4ekts3tSaa	hahah no they dont even say that they wanna have sex ahahahh an kids need to kno bout sex anyways|`|mWSLri6maa	OMG  WTF  YOU ACTUALLY HAVE TO READ THE BOOK BEFORE YOU GET THOSE RETARDED IDEAS!   its soooooo soooooo freaking far from that!  really? wow?  read it.  and you wont be able to say that again.  wow.  yea.|`|1VeqStpmaa	Well it's pretty clear that you don't hate the books as much as you claim, since the parts you're referring to happen later on.  The books aren't exactly great, groundbreaking works of literature, but Meyer is a decent author.  It's up to parents to watch their young girls reading material, there's nothing wrong with the book for young adults.|`|CJIZpXp8aa	I thought the books were amazing. She isn't a ****! She's a girl with needs who wants to be with the man she loves!|`|PBpcF8KYaa	In all honesty it's like porn for girls.     They like reading about "the perfect guy." Little do they get, it isn't possible to find someone like that.|`|OVenWc3Paa	Yea ur right but they are good books. But i think people are just reading them because everyone is reading them. LOL who knew a story like THAT would be so popular among the younguins|`|DySN1Zdbaa	okay. the whole sex thing. they waited until they were married!  and yes, bella is stupid and selfish, but that is how we all are which is why we feel that we relate to her.  and are you a boy? because if you are a girl then you should like it for the romance. every girl does. every girl who has read that book wishes that she had an edward of her own because he is so perfect!  that is why we like them, because it is like a fantasy world princess story type thing, but it's with real people who make mistakes and have problems, just like us!!  and it is well written!|`|hMSPAq3vaa	yes its a very bad example and i also hate bella.she so stupid!!!!!|`|zVeQuAbuaa	The twilight series IS a good series. Stephanie Meyer makes Bella act "stupid, and selfish" because that is what a normal 17/18 yr. old would do! Think about if the story was real life. Duh shes gonna act stupid! She loves a VAMPIRE and is scared to death, but dosen't realize it. And Stephanie Meyer is truly a wonderful author. Her imagination made and sold millions abound the world. That isn't really a bad example to teens because eventually the'll already know about sex, at that age. And how is that a bad example? Its not like the story was real.............or is it? =)|`|wPi7fLLxaa	Maybe you should learn to write before you go putting down others writing. There is so much trash out there that is much worse. Get over it and just be selective on what you let your kids read and watch.|`|sjazmIRVaa	its not a literary masterpiece but its a good read.    answers to your questions:  arent most people stupid and selfish when they're inlove?  have you tried having sex with a vampire to say that its disgusting?  isn't not that edward refusing sex/not having sex before marriage a flashing neon sign about not having pre-marital sex? you are not seeing the whole picture that the books were written on the virtue of abstinence. you may disagree but that's your opinion. keep it to yorself.|`|5qNcMeucaa	I agree that it is not well-written, but the story is very interesting nonetheless. That's probably why it is popular. There are quite a few grammatical errors in the book, and some of what's going on is unclear, but the story that is being told is interesting enough to overlook those points IMO.    Also, a lot of what Bella is feeling in the books is relevant to some present day teenagers. Most people are selfish anyway. I liked the fact that the characters were not perfect, and not impervious to their whims and emotions.|`|USuUMIlHaa	its badly written, bella has no personality and the best part of the series is when edward leaves.  rob pattinson is average looking, and i don't understand why teen girls go crazy over it  actually, thats what put me off the series

AHJQfHx9aa	Glamorama is American Psycho on PCP.  It's an amp that goes up to level 19.      I've often hypothesized that one of Ellis's goals for Glamorama was to out due himself.  Was to notch everything up even more.  Sort of his artistic way of saying, "You want something to protest?  Check this out."    If you found anything in American Psycho too disturbing - the sex, the violence, the narration - then you'll want to roll right on past Glamorama.  It's a book that goes out of it's way to disturb the reader, to challenge him, to make him squirm.    I've always found it ludicrous when people say that Haunted by Palahniuk is the most disturbing book they've read.  They've obviously not delved into Glamorama.    Glamorama is an amazing, mind bending, maxed out novel on so many levels that all other books will lose luster by comparison.  If you are an Ellis fan, read it.  If you are a Mitch Albom fan, don't.

KBBonf97aa	The best thing you can do is look into acting classes, since you won't find work until you've learned your craft and have experience.  Many theaters offer classes taught by their own actors, so you can inquire at a local theater and find out what's available.  Also, if you volunteer at the theater while you're taking classes, you'll become a familiar face and that can work to your advantage when auditions roll around.  Most kids are only interested in becoming stars, but if the theater regulars already know you're committed and working to master the craft of acting, they'll be inclined to take you more seriously.  And once you've appeared in a few productions, you'll have a resume to take to agents who may be able to find you paid work.    Being involved in local theater also affords you networking opportunities not available to most people.  Stage actors also work in commercials, television and film, so they'll know about auditions for roles that might suit your talents.  Also, casting agents for movies and TV shows sometimes contact area theaters when they're looking for local talent to fill extra and supporting roles in a particular town.  So if you're already working with the theater, you'll find out about opportunities that might not be made public.    Virtually everyone you see on TV and in movies started out in theater, since it's the best place to learn to act, gain experience and network.  In fact, most A-list actors still make time in their schedules to do stage work, since they know it's the best way to hone their chops.  In movies, they have an infinite number of retakes to get a scene right.  But on stage, they must deliver a fresh, convincing performance night after night without any redos.      If you concentrate your energies on becoming a good actor, rather than a celebrity, you'll be leagues ahead of your peers.  There are many working actors whose names and faces you wouldn't recognize, but who make a living doing something about which they're passionate.  People who place fame above becoming really good actors usually don't achieve their goal.  And the ones who do are usually tossed aside and forgotten because they don't have the talent it takes to last.  Theater is the best place to test the waters and see if you have the talent and commitment necessary to make acting your career.  Good luck!|`|Mig6O93Naa	before you try to jump in to the most difficult career in the world, get lots of acting experience in school and community plays, take a couple of professional acting classes, learn something about the career. There is almost no work for young teens, in spite of what you see on TV.  There is a recession and not as much activity in the business right now.  IT is a good time to get lots of acting experience in the amateur theartre.

AHJQfHx9aa	Marquez was very well received when he first came out, even one of three authors (can't remember the other two) credited with 'saving literature' from post-modern death.  That can be found by searching The Atlantic's archives for some articles about the death of literature.  (I can't remember the author or period, but James Wood discusses it in How Fiction Works, that may help you pinpoint it.)    For scholarly articles the first place to go is often the links at the bottom of wiki entries.  Then try Google Books, and Google Scholar.  Those three places will help you narrow down your research.  From there go to someplace like Ebscoe Host or university's online research tools.  You should be able to pull full text articles for free, or sometimes for small fees.  However if there is a fee, you should check your university library first - they'll typically foot the bill, or be able to pull it from another resource for you (that's what the library fees in your tuition are for).    Proper searches should help you find some contemporary critiques of the book.  And never overlook the New York Times Books archives either.  They aren't always in depth, but often help dictate popular thought, and it is a solid resource to have on your side.  Good luck.      (If I can figure out the author of the article that said Marquez helped save literature I'll edit.  It's a little foggy.)

dKi2R2oHaa	P51 Mustang was the main American Fighter it was a modified American Reconaisance plane with a Rolls Royce Merlin engine.  The P51 had enough range to escort bombers to Germany.  The allowed the Americans to bomb Germany during the day whilst the RAF bombed at night.     Small planes served as Fighters, reconaissance and as trainers.    The Hurricaine was a successful british fighter used to shoot down bombers, but it could also be fitted with rockets as a tank killer.  The spitfire was smaller and more manouverable and took on the enemy fighter escorts.    Other small planes included dive bombers such as the German Stuka and carrier planes such as the Japenese Zero (fighter/bomber) and Val (torpedo bomber)    By the end of the war Germany had some experimental rocket and jet fighters in productions which were used to intercept bomber formations.    Capital ships had small sea planes used for reconaissance.    The German fighters tended to have more speed and range than the British fighters. However the Spitfires and Hurricanines were more manouverable, which gave them the advantage.  In the Battle of Britain the German fighter also had a disadvantage because they had limited fuel to return home.  This should have been overcome by using drop tanks (disposable fuel tanks), but Lutwaffe comander Hermann  Goering decided against using them. A decision most historian consider to have been a mistake.  The work of British boffins on tactics and radar gave the British the opportunity to outnumber the enemy in each fight, even though the RAF was outnumbered  3 to 1 in total by the enemy.  The biggest problem for the RAF became the lack of replacement pilots.  They needed to draw on volunteers from many countries to help swell the ranks.    In the Pacific carrier war, the Japanese planes began far superior in range and manouverability against the American's. The Japanese pilots were also much more experienced.  The Americans gained the Advantage through the use of radar, sonar, code breaking and a good dose of luck.  As the war progressed the Amercian's could simply greatly outproduce the Japenese in terms of numbers. Japanese internal politics also stifled military development.    At the end of the war the Japense developed the flying torpedo guided by a suicide "kamikaze" pilot.  These were very effective and could be flown by young pilots with minimal training.    Perhaps the least known small planes of the war were the japanese aircraft designed for a submarine aircraft carrier.  These aircraft  were to be sent on a mission to attack the Panama canal. The attack never happened and the war ended before they ever engaged the enemy.    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aichi_M6A    The british, italian, german and American navies all trialed submarine recon aircraft before ww2, but abandoned their programs.  Their French did go ahead and built one carrier submarine.      http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_subm...|`|wnkoTEqVaa	P-47   p-51    Fighter were smaller planes that were used to shoot down enemy bombers, strafe enemy positions, and protect bomber form enemy fighter when bombing in Germany.|`|AA10811674	Good answers. Some famous American fighter planes were The P-38, P-40, P-47 and P-51. By the way back in WW2 they were called "pursuit" airplanes, hence the P in front. The best American fighter airplane was the P-51 Mustang.The best German planes were the FW-190 and the Messershmitt BF-109. The best British plane was the Spitfire. Quite possible the P-51 was the best of the bunch|`|OmSJR5UFaa	They were fighter planes.

A WW2 plane in flying conditions easily sells for several million dollars.     There are several replica's available. Usually on a 2/3 scale. They fly, but the engines are not on a 2/3 scale. Much smaller. Since the engine is the most expensive part (especially in operating costs) it is much more affordable.|`|vZMN82U8aa	ah homework...     these small powerful agile machines were to offer protection to our slow slumbering bombers... and as attack fighters... they were simple, and with a 12 xylinder merlin engine would hit about 450mph... and is iconic... like a harley or a zippo.     they still fly, and sound incredible... e me, i have an MP3 of a lancaster bomber (which had 4 merlin engines) its a raher unique ringtone!     and they communicated by radio... just like everyone else!     look on you tube, theres lots of video of em flying. and how did they compare? well, 650 spitfires beat fritz's 3000 planes... watch a film called "the battle of britain"     chocks away ginger...|`|7d4296b653689a306cac74432add2e63aa	There are essentially only three roles for combat aircraft: recon, strike, and intercept. The aircraft you mention (and I'm guessing that by "Messersshmidt" you mean the ME-109) were mostly used in the "intercept" role. That is, they're mission was to engage and destroy or drive away enemy aircraft. In an attacking role, that meant that they flew escort for bomber aircraft (whose mission was "strike"). On defense, they would target enemy bombers, and their fighter escorts ("intercept"). The US employed several fighter aircraft types in the Second World War. The most notable were the P-38 Lightning, the P-40 Warhawk, and the P-51 Mustang in the European theater, and the carrier-based F6 Hellcat and F4 Wildcat in the Pacific. Mention should also be made of the Japanese Mitsubishi Zero, one of the finest fighter aircraft of the era.  Communication between aircraft was by radio.  Many of these vintage aircraft are still around. An earlier poster suggested he Confederate Air Force site, which is as good a place as any to start.    Cheers

XVCNbZBtaa	I would be a philosopher of history, in two senses.    Sometimes the phrase "philosophy of history" is used to refer to inquiry into the methods that historians should or do in fact use to learn about the human past -- in that sense, it is a specialized form of epistemology.    At other times, though, the phrase is used to refer to those who advocate definite views about the overall shape or pattern of the human past, and what it tells us about our future. Is it all progressive? or a regress from a golden age?  or cyclical as Spengler and Toynbee and many other have thought? or dialectical as Hegelians and Marxists think? or something else?  In this sense, "philosophy of history" might be considered a specialized form of metaphysics.    But had I the leisure to devote myself to philosophy, I'd especially want to be a philosopher of history (not an epistemologst or a metaphysician in any more general sense) in BOTH those regards -- methods and patterns, and seek to pursue each point with an eye on the other.|`|AA11564934	you have decided that this is a fun question all by your little lonesome?    aww.....|`|SMvTq4fZaa	Epistemology         I am curious about a whole bunch of things.|`|Cf8VzXVZaa	Mystic?

But epistemologist is right up behind it. I think nature is something that'll always be, so it's definitely more important; but, knowing what you know is just as important, imo. The theory to why we know. (:    Definitely a good question!
L9mj221Taa	Most linguistic designations also accompany certain physiological traits. For instance, in addition to speaking Arabic, the Arabs also carry a distinguishing set of physical characteristics, i.e. larger, more convex noses, somewhat darker skin, a greater prevalence of dark eyes and hair, etc. But the Turkish linguistic designation is unique in that it doesn't double as an ethnic designation as well. This is because of the imperial tradition of the Turks. When the Turco-Mongolic expansions of the 11th and 12th centuries took place, the Turks settled in large regions, but were outnumbered by the local peoples. What happened is, the Turkish language and culture diffused throughout the local populations, and those populations, although ethnically distinct from their conquerors, adopted the Turkic identity.    This is what happened in Turkey. The Turks who settled from Central Asia under the Seljuk Dynasty gradually intermixed with the local populations, and impressed their own culture and identity onto those populations.    Most Turks in Turkey aren't true ethnic Turks, they're ethnic Greeks for the most part in the west and north, and those in the southeast identify as Kurds anyway.    As for similarities between Turkish and Arabic culture, that's a result of the Ottoman metropolitan culture. During the time of the Ottoman Empire, a very strong and distinct metropolitan culture developed, and it had its own cuisine, fashion, music, and literary styles. This metropolitan culture spread across the major cities of the Empire, and was adopted by all the subjects of the Empire, and is the real reason why you can see so many similarities between all the different peoples of the Middle East, be they Arab, Turk, Slav, Greek or Armenian. These different peoples and the nations they now comprise are all the heirs of the Ottoman metropolitan culture, which borrowed from all the most favored dishes, fashions, music, etc, of the Empire and combined them into a distinct Imperial culture.     So there's your answer. In short, some Turks sometimes resemble Arabs because they might just be the descendants of Arabs who adopted the Turkish language and culture. And the reason for their similarities in culture and cuisine is because of the unifying and standardizing effect Ottoman court customs had on the different regions of the Empire. Just keep in mind, Turks more often resemble Greeks than Arabs.|`|VXcp8hvHaa	i used to live in algeria and they all looked alike, but they all stunk|`|Rzs7rrbEaa	They were all part of the Persian Empire at one time.

AA10570173	I would do two things: (1) think of favorite objects around you. Make a list of these things, from that list select a few items that you wouldn't mind altering in some manner that fits the requirements of your assignment.<br>  (2) Do some mind mapping: it's a technique that's similar to word association. Write down a word on a piece of paper. Circle it. Then start just letting your mind go and write down other words that come up in association with that first word. But for your assignment, you might want to start out with a word or words that you then look for opposites. This is just to get you thinking about how to approach the assignment, finding opposites or even relationships that would inspire you to take an object from that first list and apply the changes inspired by the second exercise.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps. I know sometimes our minds will look at an assignment like this and just go blank, and that can be because there are too many options.<br>  <br>  Good luck.

6TPEyJqhaa	The reason the treaty failed has a lot of sides to it.  First of all, the Congress majorities switched to Republicans around this time (Wilson was a Democrat) and they were really pissed because Wilson didn't let any Republican Representatives participate in making the treaty.  Secondly, the Congress was disappointed because Wilson had to leave of his tariff and open sea's policies out of the treaty in order to compromise with the other counties.  Thirdly, Wilson's stubbornness got in the way because he was unwilling to compromise with the congress on the treaty.  The second time that the Congress voted they decided to ratify the treaty if there could be corrections, but Wilson Would not allow it.  That's all I can remember right now.  Hope it helps:)|`|7KcVSB3Uaa	Wilson had NO foreign policy experience. He also basically agreed to let the other allies (France, Britain and Russia) have everything they wanted in the Treaty, in exchange for getting his League of Nations in the deal. He was so focused on the League that he neglected the rest of the treaty. The Senate, who were not as excited about the League of Nations as Wilson was, refused to sign off on the agreements he had made.    I wouldn't necessarily call Wilson stubborn; rather, I would call him idealistic and inexperienced and inept regarding foreign policy.

PlkU4Zghaa	In theory he was a man of the Enlightenment and especially followed the writings of Rousseau. Like the revolutionaries before him he wanted equality and democracy. However in reality, he was a man of contradiction. He promoted appointment based on merit (meritocracy) and yet ruled the Council of the State like a dictator.     As the previous poster said he signed the concordat with the Pope in 1801 which gave the Roman Catholic Church renewed control over education and ecclesiastical appointments.     There were some benefits to Napoleon's governmental policies for those in the middle classes. As he created a more unified and strong secular state, more opportunities were open for middle class men to take on prestigious government jobs.    He also introduced the Napoleonic Code which were a set of uniform laws which made all citizens (excluding women) equal before the law. That would be an example of French Revolutionary ideals and was copied by many other European powers.    All that said, he ultimately contradicted his revolutionary inspired ideals through his military conquests, and tyranny. he aspired to create equality and was an enemy of privilege, yet he strove to create his own empire and dynasty.    Hope that helps|`|xcV1oVJLaa	It doesn't look like he wanted to preserve any of them....    reject?

GLS7vgAdaa	i'm going to go out on a limb here and say you're not much of a dancer. if you were you wouldn't be asking this question. am i right so far?   specifically, the only thing that comes to mind is Hook's pirates dance to a tarantella. nonspecifically, and more importantly, even if you're unsure of whatever dance steps they throw at you, you still have the potential to get the part. of course you wanna try to pick up as much as you can but the best tip i can give you is HAVE CONFIDENCE! smile that award-winning smile and sell whatever you do pick up. remember most choreographers can teach new steps to people, but they can't teach stage presence and confidence. you have to show that you naturally have that at least, they'll decide if they can mold you from there.     another most important tip, is PAY ATTENTION! the biggest pet peeve i have when choreographing is having to say things more than once...especially in an audition. you should be focused not only then but also in rehearsals to listen to all that is told to you and pick it up as quickly as you can. this also weeds out the easy-to-work-with from those that will have a hard time getting a job.    trust me, if you apply these most valuable tips in every audition and carry it into every rehearsal, not only will you get more parts, but you'll start making better impressions and be more easily remembered.

JPlVt9xYaa	It is normal to be confused from time to time. We all encounter strange and unusual situations. Learning to deal with our day to day events will reduce the confusion and staying the course will help. When a student takes a math test and doesn't know all the answers, he/she is not confused, but simply hasn't been acquainted with certain problems. When a student takes a math test and mistakenly puts down the wrong answer, but without realizing it and being certain that he/she knows the answer, that is confusion. That can be corrected with practice and confidence. This is just one illustration, but there are many. Life as a whole, is meant to be confusing, we gain confidence with successful experiences. I can guarantee you that no one knows all the answers and no one knows everything about life and when you meet someone who says they do, turn and leave that person as fast as you can. We are all in the boat together and we must row as a team. Yes, someone will captain and guide the rest, but that is still teamwork. When you know you are on the right team, doing the right thing, the confusion is a lot less.    Good luck, do your best, don't try to best everyone and be yourself. Life may be a little confusing, but it sure is a great experience.|`|nGyOmjPsaa	First I panic.

UKTJfWEzaa	If, despite its historical impossibility, the Spanish had backed the British then Britain would still have a conceivable chance to win the war and keep hold o all their territory as opposed to the impossible task in the Original Time-line of facing the might of the French and Spanish Empires coupled with the Revolutionaries in the Colonies and the Dutch with only the help of their Colonial loyalist and on Germany principality.    The outcome would be far from certin to be a British victory but its more likely that the war would have been longer and that more British force could be deployed against the French and Revolutionaries where they need to depoy it most.|`|7d4296b653689a306cac74432add2e63aa	It never could have happened that way. Spain and Britain, while not openly at war, were very antagonistic toward one another. It was in Spain's best interest, politically and commercially, for Britain to lose the war. There's no plausible scenario I can come up with where Spain backs Britain, but, even if there were, I seriously doubt it would have changed the outcome. (And, in a Spanish-British alliance, however implausible, whither France?) Interesting "What If", but not really plausible.      Cheers

YorMkZYAaa	It depends on several factors here:    1. Experience/number of years writing professionally  2. Freelance or full-time   3. Location (yes, this matters)  4. Size of publication    Freelance writers with minimal experience will likely only earn $35-75 for an article. Those with extensive experience will likely command as low as $125 to $200+ for an article. This is not an easy way to go as it is very difficult to earn a living freelancing unless you have years of experience and credibility.    Location and size of publication matter too. If you have a small newspaper or magazine in Podunk, USA you're not going to get much. A publication like Seventeen based in a large city will pay more partly because they have the money to do so. Same thing holds true for large newspapers like "The New York Times".    In house writers/reporters start low and work up. On average a writer/reporter will earn as little as $25k a year but depending on years of experience, credibility, and popularity, they can command well over $100k. Rare, but possible. A good in between for mid-level writers and average reports would be between $35-50k, again depending on size of publication and location.    Bottom line in all this: Do what you love to do. Most writers are paid very little unless you're in technical writing (not easy and not fun work). If your sole decision in any job is based on money you are not likely to be happy. If you love writing, write because you love to, not for financial gain (or lack thereof)|`|UKtZS3Wraa	im hoping a lot because i want to be one, but whats the chances|`|cHxaWW0taa	Don't know...

As in, not even enough to live off of at first.      I've read a lot of biographies of writers, and starting out they first get about a zillion rejection slips. Then, they get offered a paying gig, and it's a negligible amount. Recently I read it described in a scene where the author went out to celebrate and noted the check covered their drinks.

65109cb8f29d34e3d6fc411bd1edae58aa	You'll want to use strobes or 5000K lights so the color of your paper is correct. Do not use ambient light.     Doing art requires that you MUST use a hi-resolution camera such as the 4x5" view camera, Mamiya RZ67, EOS-1Ds Mark III, Nikon D3x, D700 or Canon 5D. Rent it if you have to. Pick a lens that exhibits NO pincushion or barrel distortion.      I've enclosed a drawing to show the set up.    http://www.postmyimage.com/images/images...|`|YiY9Yd2Jaa	You have given no idea as to what sort of photographic equipment you have available.     You cannot use too wide a lens without creating distortion, so you will need to get back a little - probably use no less than a 35mm on a digital camera and get far enough back to get the full image in the frame. That probably means wall mounting the image before photographing it. You will have to be careful about lighting (no flash etc.) to avoid shine - probably a slow exposure with the lens stopped down a little to ensure sharpness. You also need to take a test shot or two to determine the best white balance - camera auto white balance isn't always reliable. You will need the camera mounted on a tripod with it positioned parallel to the floor and aimed at exactly the centre of the image - once again to avoid distortion.

OmSJR5UFaa	I would give credit to Ulysses S. Grant for that.  Federal troops were a bit demoralized by the many swift and effective Confederate battle victories early on.    General Grant took charge, fought hard, and brought others like General Sherman into the fold.  This effectively brought good leadership to the Union army and the tide of battle turned to the favor of the Union after this.|`|f8U0wLg7aa	Grant was good, but on the flip side, you may want to consider General Lee. He fought on the Confederate side of things, because he was born in the south, even though he went to a military academy in the North. Maybe your project could be on the outcome of the war without General Lee, or if he had remained in the Union army.|`|E135gdSXaa	I can understand the reasonign behind both Robert E. Lee and General Grant. Robert E Lee took a group of civilians and melded them into a cohesive army which outkilled the US military almost 3-1 despite being heavily outnumbered and outsupplied. I really admire the man and have no doubt that he was the greatest general in all of The Civil War. Grant took a disheartened Union and won the war(even though he really only overwhelmed Lee's force with numbers.) But if you're truly looking for a difference maker, it's got to be Thomas "Stonewall" Jackson. He was Lee's right hand man, who he could count on to follow his oreders and to improvise. Jackson was the only undefeated general in the Civil War. He was largely responsible for the South's domination in the first half of the war. After he was accidentally killed by his men, the tide of the war turned. Indeed, Lee said following his death, "I have lost my right hand." He felt that Jackson was that important to the war. If he had lived, the war's outcome might've been different. Hope that helps.|`|lRq81lu7aa	You could try Abraham Lincoln.    He held the Union together through a time of upheaval.

If you know the war well enough that date should hold a bit of significance. We're talking a period during the Battle of Chancellorsville, particularly during the night on the Plank Road. A little friendly fire incident which may have helped change the course of the war in the east. You see that one North Carolinian mistakenly shot his own corps commander. Lieutenant General Thomas Johnathan "Stonewall" Jackson who died of pneumonia eight days later which he contracted when his arm was amputated due to his injuries. Today there's a big question about how the war might have been different had Jackson not died from complications from that wound. What might have happened if he hadn't been out that night with his staff and mistaken for Union cavalry (they were between the Union and Confederate lines returning to camp when they were fired upon by the North Carolinians)?    Exactly who fired what ended up becoming a fatal shot is unknown. But their mistake may well have ended up making them the person who made the biggest difference in the war as we're left with the question of what might have been.|`|AA11202552	There are many who made a major difference and are well known. There is general Ulysses S. Grant. He led the North to victory. He was a very good planner. There is also President Lincoln. He was very strategic. He set forth some things that changed the war. General Lee, though he did not win the war he was a very good leader. He set up many battles for the Confederacy and he was an asset to the south that allowed them to continue on for so long.

To do this, you need to stop chasing the big things - money, power.|`|r7iZ2JOUaa	In my opinion, there is no such thing as happiness. The smiles that you see and laughters that you hear are all plain vain. Happiness is a hedonist's illusion, unconsciously ignoring the emptiness deep within the heart. If you knew what existentialism was, you'd agree that happiness is vain. Hence, it is wiser to be sad than happy.|`|Q7xc5Qmzaa	HAVING SEX MAKES ME HAPPY

Pu7TON79aa	I'm not sure what level grade 3 ballet is because I study Balanchine.    Your center work sounds okay, but the free expressive movement for the end does sound a bit "tiny tot".    How old are the dancers? What about doing a part of a simple variation from a ballet at the end. You can make adjustments depending upon how skilled the dancers are.    Just a thought. But what do I know? I've never taught a class.  You could work on turns at the end? I don't know.|`|ybwqYZ1waa	After barre when you go to center floor do a battement ( high kick) and arabesque combination. Maybe if they know fouettes or seconds they can do open practice. Then you can do across the floor with piques. Maybe something like pique, pique tombe, pas de bourree, pirouette, repeat.|`|xqgE4CrBaa	Okay, I am an almost intensely training dancer not too far from that age. So start with a warm-up and ankle strengthening at the bar. Then do the normal bar exercises. If this is not the level you're teaching, it was mine, so forgive me. Do pirouettes, rtir en rlev holds, 90* and 135* arabesques, pas de chats, sautes, and stretch at the end. Do pique grand battement, pique arabesque. My instructor has us do dancer-coach, where one dancer coaches another in an exercise and then they switch. Free movement sounds a teeny bit little-kiddish so maybe you could switch it to freeze dance. Cheers!

LxYZxKYwaa	The Twilight Saga obviously doesn't meet everyone's standards of a "good book" so there will be critics and there will be lovers.

I think the plot is intriguing, but I just think the writing itself is pretty poor. The characters are annoyingly one dimensional. In my opinion, the Twilight series are good if you just read them and don't think much about what you're reading. But if you really start to think about the characters, and the writing, and the themes, it seems absolutely ridiculous. I'm not strongly anti-Twilight, but I just don't get all the hype - I think they're so overrated!|`|w3yrnDEiaa	Take the annoying Twilight questions to a fansite please.

6e5c9606952e60fc17250bf668baaa41aa	There are two types of atheists, "weak" atheists and "strong" atheists.  Weak & strong are just descriptive terms, not any kind of value judgment.  A weak atheist is someone who simply lacks belief in a god.  Babies are weak atheists.  A tribesman who's never heard of xtianity would be a weak atheist with respect to the xtian god, though he may believe in some of his tribe's gods.  Strong atheists, on the other hand, actively assert that there are no gods.  They are making a positive statement.  They don't merely lack belief in gods, they have come to the conclusion that gods do not exist.    Note that agnostics are, by default, weak atheists.  They do not positively assert that there are no gods, but at the same time they also do not positively believe in gods.    Note also that a person who believes in one god may be either a weak or strong atheist with respect to other gods.  Many xtians haven't heard of Cocopele, so they would be weak atheists toward him.  Most xtians have heard of Zeus, however, and are strong atheists toward him, since they believe that their god is the only one, therefore Zeus must not exist.|`|kwYxQp0Maa	I suppose technically they wouldn't be classifiable.  Being an Atheist is not believing in a God.  They don't 'not' believe as they haven't a concept of God, thus they can't believe or not.|`|vuKD7je1aa	What makes you think you yourself can comprehend "the idea of god," let alone anything else in this world?  Comprehension is not a requisite of belief anyways: your question itself is flawed.    There is no such thing as a blank slate; we are all born with innate tendencies and genetic predispositions.    A baby is a baby, I would not try to label it.    And you're right--there is no god.  There is only human wonder, curiosity, and spirituality.|`|trMsK86jaa	Are you suggesting they're born Christians?    Wow, that'd be a good thing for God to do - make it so that everyone's a christian no matter what they say about it.    Good, and slightly deranged.|`|EO35f6yhaa	I'd have to say babies are agnostics, i.e. Don't know if there is or isn't a theist god, and aren't really in a position to care.     In my eyes, a real atheist is one who has some knowledge of theistic religion, has seen the evidence (or lack thereof) and made an informed decision to reject religion. Knowledge of geocentricity, evolution by natural selection and the empirical worldview is optional.     This question has made me realize the absurdity of baptizing babies...|`|380b53c18cfb9588bad18dd0f231a984aa	"A baby" is the broadest possible category; in point of fact, there are distinct subsets of babies' awareness:    "Babies Remember Birth," David Chamberlain, Ph.D.,  "Life before Life," Jim Tucker, M.D.,  "Children Who Remember Previous Lives," Ian Stevenson, M.D., and  "The Reincarnation of Edgar Cayce?", Free and Wilcock, offer examples.    Brain scan research has also shown that if a newborn in the first 45 Minutes after birth is able to be held by its mum, and they gaze into each other's eyes for a minute or more, that the conscious awareness of the child stays at and develops from the birth awareness level.  If the gazing period is passed by, the baby's brain awareness shuts down for several months, before regaining what it arrived with, and then developing from there.    The basic model of God is Father-Mother, so a baby's consciousness would be experiencing that even more than a mentally aware adult, as for the baby, the sucking reflex is somewhat oceanic, bliss, comfort, and hence, at that level of awareness, more directly experiencing what religious call "God"--the loving Father-Mother Creator.|`|4aa8824c12babfd0fa8da8f2f1cf115faa	Atheist, as in lack religion, no they are not.    Their religion is "Mom".  Mom is this mysterious, all-powerful being that supplies every life concept from pain to comfort.  And babies excercise rituals for their "Mom" religion.  Crying gets one food or a fresh diaper, laughing gets a hug. etc.  In their world, Mom is their "god".|`|w2qV8WEmaa	Babies are more like animals -> Eat, Sleep and S-hit.|`|Rt4bJfVAaa	No.  They are born innocent of any preconceived ideas of grown man.  Where the idea that they are born atheist is beyond me.  Especially since there have been a few questions where atheists have admitted that they had to leave a belief system to become an atheist.|`|9gOHTGB2aa	no. Their just babies. They don't know anything about religion or athiesism. They get raised into what their parents beilieve in.|`|zdPqht41aa	no being and atheist means you dont accept religious beliefs and religion to a baby would be like trying to make them swim underwater and breath at the same time|`|gXeuNSU6aa	Babies do not have the intellectual compacity to believe in anything (except for very basic instincts; but those don't count as beliefs).  Because they don't/can't believe in anything, this would make them nihilists; people who don't believe in anything (anything at all), where as an atheist doesn't believe in a god, religion, or afterlife (among other things).    Of course, being babies they can't really be counted as having a faith/belief system since they can not comprehend one, so you can't really classify their belief system.  But, if you really wanted to classify them as something, then a nihilist would be the closest.|`|m17MZfWHaa	Is a tree or a rock atheist too?|`|Mv4oL2DXaa	Babies aren't exactly atheists. They are essentially, empty vessels ready to be filled with information. No one is born with a belief of a God, or lack thereof. Babies don't necessarily think there isn't a God. They are just unaware of religion. Technically speaking, they would be considered agnostic, due to the fact that they don't know. I don't think they could actually be categorized under any religion though, since people form religious opinions either through teachings, self discovery, logic, etc. Being oblivious to the matter wouldn't classify them under any religion, in my opinion.|`|CLB32006aa	The baby lacks belief in a god so it is an atheist by definition.    as for the blank slate argument...the blank slate makes them an atheist as belief in a god must be taught.    agnosticism is from a logical standpoint gimp...it is basically saying that although you don't think something is true, since you cannot prove it is false you cannot state that is false. EX There is a lot of evidence against the existence of unicorns and I don't believe they exist, but I could never for certain prove they don't exist somewhere so I have to hold out hope that they could be real. Would you really say that you are agnostic towards unicorns? Or would you say that you don't believe that unicorns exist?    Being is an atheist is not believing in god, it a lack of belief in a god. It is the absence of belief not an act of disbelief.|`|JhvqUvlsaa	I think you answered your own question. You said that a baby cannot comprehend the idea of a god; and because of this, there is no religion or god in its heart. But this does not make it an atheist; it just makes it a baby.|`|i6d582PFaa	yes  militant atheists? No.    so basically babies are really just agnostic in that they don't know anything|`|8yE2sYGeaa	More like a tabula rasa (blank slate) as they do not have the wherewithal to make a decision    If you have ever taken the time to speak with an atheist as to why they have their stance, you, at least, understand their reasons. Yu don't have to agree with it, but you do have to accept it    i also find it highly specious to make fun of them or ridicule them for their different beliefs. Do we make fun of other faiths because they worship in a manner that is not like our way?|`|010478ea090db9976afeb8170939dea9aa	it's not that babies can't comprehend the idea of god, it's that they're in a completely new world they know nothing about. they lack knowledge in almost everything because they have not learned much yet.

5wg7tKc6aa	Well, it sounds like you've already got your character developed, so I'm not exactly sure what you're asking us to suggest.  How old is this "prince" character?  I guess it really depends on the age, and maturity of this character.

It sounds right.|`|6Gt0OVA9aa	你知道你应该使用搜索栏？ <br>  这个问题已经被问很多次
Omu7AbmQaa	I agree with Propeno.  When you are onstage you are NOT yourself, you should be 100% the character you are portraying. Research your character and really delve in to who she is. Once you know every minute detail about her, you will have an easier time "becoming" her. When you are with him onstage, think of him through the eyes of your character - you must leave all those awkward feelings backstage. Once you enter, you now love him and that's it (or however your character feels about him, but I'm guessing. You're character doesn't have a problem with touching or kissing him so you shouldn't because you are not you anymore.  I know how difficult it is, but if you can get in that mind set, everything will be so much easier!  I wish you the best of luck!!!|`|b663010fec563a8838443a18a6bec461aa	When you play a part,  you should immerse yourself into that character.  You BECOME that character in your own mind.  The other lead player becomes the character he's playing.  It has nothing to do with real life.  Sure, a real life relationship might help with the chemistry you both portray on-stage, but it's not essential to a good show.  I've played music for a number of productions and it was funny to watch people who, off-stage in real life, hated each others guts,  have to portray a loving couple on-stage.  But really, it's just a job, right?|`|1gf0BwcXaa	Forget about the feeling, and just say, "The show must go on!" Think positive.|`|FuqdMHfMaa	well, i understand feeling awkward with him.  you should try and hang out with him outside of rehearsals, like with other cast members.  maybe plan to meet for a meal before or after rehearsals just to get used to him and to see how other people interact with each other.    just have fun and joke around with him.  if it helps, make a joke out of your "close" scenes.  go over the top and be over dramatic in order to release tension and get a few laughs, that will break the ice and make things simpler.    just try to be friendly and relaxed.  my friend is in a play where her character's romantic interest is on a rotating shift.  she has to kiss about three different guys, one who is gay!  she says that she just jokes about it and knows that they aren't getting any "pleasure" out of the kiss and basically just jokes about it.

mO1s4pMgaa	Uglies series by Scott Westerfeld  This is an extremely good book. It's hard to explain but it's about the future, after mankind basically destroyed the earth (global warming, destroying forests, polluting the ocean, etc) survivors made a new society where there's no argueing, war, etc. Everyone is considered "ugly" until they turn 16 and have this sugery that makes them "pretty" and they move to this part of town where all they do is have fun and party all day and night. Tally, the main character cant wait to turn pretty. She meets Shay who's a rebal and convinces Tally to leave the city for a night to see what's out in the wilderness. Tally learns all kinds of things about being pretty and the truth is.. it's not really pretty. The sequels, Pretties and Specials, are also really good.    The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins  This book is also set in the future and is extremely intense like you're actually in the book. It's setting is in Panem, a city that's now in what's left of North America (which has become smaller after global warming and melting of the ice caps). Surrounding Panem are 12 districts where each year, one boy and girl between the ages of 12 and 18 are chosen to be in the Hunger Games where they are put into an arena and battle each other and try to survive until there's only one left and is the winner.|`|qlr9ZvCTaa	Are you quite sure you don't like Vampires? :-)    This series doesn't have any - Try the Sword of Truth series by Terry Goodkind!

Qas05nZraa	it's wonderful|`|0BioKSmaaa	herez a few suggestions     You are the most beautiful thing to me  The way your eyes glow like the shine  The shine of an Aurora show  Beautiful, rare but always a site to see  I dont know if this is meant to be a sign  But I cant help looking at you  Looking at your radiant smile   That wonderful glow  When you walk into the room   My nerves go crazy on cue  It is hard for me to keep still  Of course that probably shows  Dont think you arent beautiful  The world is really lucky to have you   I know you have plenty of angels   Always watching over you  And just so you know, if I could I would make a star just for you   So all could see just how bright you are    This is how I see you   And no matter what people say you will always be   A star    I think the last three lines should be a seperate stanza because you're sort of staring a new idea by saying that's how i see you, sort of sounds like an ending     obviously that's just my opinion and you can bag it if you want   i think this is a wonderful poem   nice work  and i want a star too!! :P   keep penning :D|`|Mkroj9gPaa	i like it. very good thoughts. i think it sounds too conversational, though.

(you make tons of grammar errors) but then your writing style hooked me. I like the plot too. I  don't know, for some reason it really intrests me.     And i'm not just saying this, I'm usually really harsh when I critique people's writing. But I actually like this. You just have to work on your grammer.    ^When i wrote that i had only read the first paragraph. I continued to read, and you are really rushing your story. You started out great, but then when you started describing your main characters life it was like you had a deadline you had to meet - spread it out|`|EbV5cGHOaa	I actually really like it!

Or I could be promenading in a constitutional post-prandial  Digesticating* victuals and viands and feelin' fine and dandy. I'll   Admit it seems appealing to soak up the rays of Helios  Then come in from the cold, play some air of Frederick Delius,  Something polychromatic, vaguely tonal but strongly pentatonic,  Then repair to the commode for ablutions post-colonic.

Besides, you just wet your fingers and place them on the right bowl rim. http://www.google.com/search?q=glass+har...   The glass harmonica with crystal glasses filled with liquid to various levels that is rubbed with the wet finger is merely a matter of practicing on one glass to hone your skills then adding more glasses and being adept with the hands while have a great memory for note locations.

wYvFytHoaa	Flute and piccolo.    I chose the flute because I liked it for it's shinyness (hehe), compact size, and the elegant way it's held. Not to mention, I also chose the flute for the sweeter, cheerier sound it has compared to all the other band instruments. And I noticed the flutes in an ensemble tend to get the melody, which I like. Oh and us flutes players are economical, we don't need reeds. ;]    I chose to play the piccolo because the bad thing about the flute is they often get overpowered in an ensemble, but not for the piccolo...fun! And it also amazed me that the piccolo looks tiny and harmless, but it sure doesn't sound so! You can hear it over all instruments in a band setting.|`|PFTAisNJaa	Piano. I just love it. The sound make me feel good.|`|If7ZMJGyaa	I play:     Guitar (Schecter Omen-6 and LTD M-50): my main Inspiration is Ben Burnly from Breaking Benjamin and also from watching my dad play.    And drums (Pearl Forum 6 Piece Double Bass) My main inspiration is Chris Adler from Lamb of God and also Jason Bittner (Shadows Fall), Chad Szeliga (Breaking Benjamin), and Dave Grohl (Nirvana, QOTSA)    I also sing, and my inspiration for that is Kurt Cobain (Nirvana)|`|OzRZHo3jaa	I play the bass, because I think it's cool. I also play the guitar because it's a versatile instrument and a great way to express yourself. And I play the trombone, because I started to listen to ska and thought "this is sweet, I should learn a brass instrument".|`|pdyhuZmeaa	My principal instrument that i am studying here in college is Clarinet. I can play all woodwind, all brass, all percussion as well as piano violin, cello and string bass. I have been playing since i was about 9 years old.  I marched in drum corps with mellophone and am very pleased to be able to play as much as i do! Thanks for the question. =)|`|2xOF70S1aa	i started out on piano, because my mom played it.   then i started flute, because it's the most amazing instrument ever.    then advanced to piccolo, because someone needed to play piccolo and i was the only one who could.   now i'm learning clarinet and maybe trumpet, because i want to be a band director and i need to learn all of the instruments.|`|mb1CZfuEaa	i play flute cuz flute ROCKS!  no actually i picked it because i just really liked it the way it looked and stuff in 5th grade we got to try all the instruments and decide which we liked most i just really liked flute  i can also play some saxophone because when my sister got hers i just decided to teach myself it i dont like it much though|`|UnQCBfc8aa	Piano - I've been playing piano since I was three. My parents got me into it and I LOVE IT!!! The piano is cool - you can express any emotion on it and it's just fun to play when I get bored lolol.    Recorder - I had the option of playing this in 5th grade (although I actually started in 4th). I got drawn to it and I still play it.    Clarinet - I started in 6th Grade and am now proudly first chair. When I was in 5th grade, we were visited by a person from a music corporation and he asked us if we wanted to play intruments. I wasn't quite sure what a clarinet was back then, but the first thing that popped into my head was that it looked like a recorder, so it'd be easy! My other friends thought I should play a flute instead but I didn't (although I will learn flute soon). And look what happened! I became first chair. I soon found out that clarinets and recorders are WAAAAY DIFFERENT. The clarinet was hard for me in the beginning but I caught on. Now I'll be a clarinetist until the day I die. :-D    Guitar - I'm currently learning. I thought it'd be cool to learn this and so I was lucky enough to find a guitar under the Christmas tree :-)    Trumpet, Flute, Violin - I'm supposed to be learning these soon. My two oldest cousins are supposed to help me on violin, and I'm going to try to teach myself flute and trumpet. I think I could do it. I taught myself to play piano, didn't I?     :-D|`|dXW9cPWMaa	I played the flute for eight years, from 6th grade through my freshman year of college, but I had to quit when I declared a second major because I simply don't have time anymore. It seems kind of a waste to throw away all the things I achieved with the flute, but maybe someday I'll be able to pick it up again (but not be one of those crazy flute women - I'm sure you know the type).    In fifth grade, we were given a listening test, and according to how we scored, we were given a set of instruments to choose from. I scored in the top group and was given the choices of flute, clarinet or percussion. I picked flute because there was a student flute floating around in my mom's family, and the rest was history.|`|NLwfMSJWaa	guitar|`|AM33tqYAaa	guitar - inspiration from Slash, Jimi Hendrix, SRV    drums - my friend plays    bass - my cousin plays|`|vMFKIc4Jaa	I play the bassoon, french horn, and steel drums.    The French Horn because a cute guys played it in 7th grade.  The Bassoon because I wanted a challenge and a teacher told me I couldn't do it.  The Steel Drums, because that's what we do out here. :)|`|XOgvpDiZaa	I play guitar and ukulele.    I picked up guitar because of John Mayer, and ukulele because of Jake Shimabukuro.|`|AA10358331	Well my main instrument is clarinet. I picked it in 5th grade.. and just stuck with it.  But I also play: Tuba, french horn, trumpet, trombone, flute, all the saxs, oboe, bassoon, the whole percussion section, and piano.    I'm studying to me be a music teacher in college! (if you couldn't tell)|`|yBDiksM5aa	I play...    Trumpet: we were given the choice of playing an instrument in 4th grade, so I decided to sign up. I wasn't really a 'flute/clarinet person' and the drums were a joke. I was thinking "hey, I'll take a year of trumpet but then I think the saxophone looks like more fun, so I'll switch". But I never ended up getting a chance at switching. I never learned what sharps or flats were, even though now I see how terribly easy they were...so I ended up quitting in 8th. I really wish I would have stuck with it, and I think after a two year break I'm going to try to get back into it.    Guitar: I started guitar because my brother had played it and it looked really interesting. I started lessons last summer and it's coming along pretty well. I really like it a lot, it's a lot more challenging than I thought it would be, with all the different theory and patterns and terms for everything.    Piano: Piano is something that I just sort of felt a draw to. I started this year as a sophomore at my high school in Piano Lab I after my next door neighbor gave a recommendation for that class. I really, really enjoy the piano.|`|1gf0BwcXaa	i just started this school, but there was this girl that had really nice hair and clothes and boots, and she picked to play the clarinet. so i decided to play that too. and i'm loving it!!!|`|01828ba3a2ceab3b3b6ed1d24349e9d6aa	I play drums...have been playing them for 23 years  I also play guitar...have been playing for 11 years now      I originally started with the guitar first back in 1985, but it got stolen, so I tried drums in 1986...  then I picked up guitar again in 1998 after an accident.    I wanted to play guitar & drums because of all the heavy metal guitarists  back in the 1980s. I saw all the old MTV videos in the 80s back then and that's bascially why I wanted to learn how to play the guitar and drums.|`|3b9960db548159b1919b3abaa1e21f99aa	Piano and Irish tin and low whistles.    I started playing piano when I was four... we had a little electric keyboard and I just started fooling with it 'cause it was fun. I'm not that great, I haven't really taken lessons or anything, but I continue to play because I love the sound and it's still fun!    I started playing tin whistle because I love traditional Irish music and it's a very easy instrument to play. Then I heard the Low whistle at church and it was SO gorgeous... it's easy to play too, but the stretch is a tad long for my fingers, so I mostly play only slow songs on it.  Cheers!  ~Claire|`|exxHakadaa	I play the soprano, alto, and bass clarinet, alto and tenor saxophone, trumpet, and piano. I started the soprano clarinet because that's what I wanted to play. I went to alto clarinet for an ensemble and played a saxophone part for street marching. The bass clarinet to add to the bass part in the band. Alto saxophone for jazz band. The tenor saxophone for a loud harmony part for the halftime show. I learned the trumpet because I wanted to. The piano because I it sounds good and it may handy later in life.|`|wJiWuTMjaa	i play clarinet......i really dont know why either...but i love it  and i really wanna start to play alto sax|`|HHnQyjFBaa	Well, the ones I enjoy are guitar and piano. I am self taught.    Then, I also played the flute for six years, the clarinet, and people think I'm good at singing but I think I suck ahah.|`|Ei1Zv9KHaa	I play the Trumpet. I'M AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|9InaLbBQaa	Percussion and flute.    I like flute because it sounds beautiful, of course, and is one of the few instruments that uses only air.    I was forced onto percussion by my band director, but I find that I really like it. I find it fascinating that drums can make rythms sound so good, and how mallets and chimes can make such good sound.

D6RekU7Iaa	*jumps up and down clapping excitedly*    I really, really enjoyed the dialogue. I might have to steal your talent D: I wish I could write dialogue like that. It always sounds choppy with me >    It was really good, just a few things here and there that could be caught easily with a beta or a reread.    My advice for you is to not use cliche, overused descriptions. "His voice was eerie and silent, like the slow, soft winds that brush through my hair." ("hushed" might be a better word for "silent", as you can't be not making any noise and talking at the same time.)    Anyway, the soft wind brushing through her hair - it suddenly goes from something intense to some sort of poetry, and it doesn't flow. I also noticed you used "still, like a stone". Is there any other phrase you could use? It It sounded a little redundant, which is okay if it fits your voice, but it didn't seem to. In my opinion. I'm a reader, though, so you might see it differently.    That's all. ^^ Oh, and read your stuff aloud. Helps a HECK of a lot.     Good luck!!! *starts jumping again* Man, I love it when people start writing.|`|DGEpe8bxaa	looks good so far, though some of the puncuation isn't perfect. but hey, not a big deal! I'd say just keep writing, and remember to add lots and lots of details that make the story brilliant!|`|TdRgGCJPaa	Well. I did not read the WHOLE thing, but, I can see allready that it's great and that your a talented writer. You seem to have a few spacing typos though.

2h9aOYxjaa	Probably because in the Biblical story about the Battle of Jericho the attackers started their attack on the walled city of Jericho by blowing hundreds of loud horns (ram's horns, I suppose).  According to the story, the horns were so loud they not only scared the defenders, but caused the walls to crack.  Regardless of whether or not the "walls falling down from the sound of horns" thing in this story is meant literally or figuratively, most historians agree that, at the very least, the horns were an effective psychological weapon that demoralized and intimidated the enemy....much like the sirens on the Stuka bomber.    As for how it worked?  I don't know the engineering details of it.  I think it may have been a fan-type of set up (like a souped up version of those "Mighty Siren" whistles that little kids get out of Cracker Jack boxes).  I could of swore I'd heard that somewhere, but I'm really not sure about this part, to be honest.|`|DRGchuRGaa	jerico trumpet is a biblical term... the walls of jerico where brought down amid the noise of music....    the screaming noise of a stuka dive bomber would use the same tactic of panic in the attack..    it was powered by air flow through a siren fitted to the underneath of the plane and was let loose in a dive..
7d4296b653689a306cac74432add2e63aa	The German Stuka dive bomber is probably the best known. In the early years of the war, the Stuka (Ju-87) played a major role in the success of the German blitzkrieg. Their primary targets were enemy defensive positions.  The one that had the most impact on the war's outcome, though, was probably the american SBD Dauntless (A-24 "Banshee"). In a span of about five minutes at the Battle of Midway, a squadron of Dauntless dive bombers led by LtCmdr Wade McCluskey inflicted fatal damage on three of the four carriers in Admiral Nagumo's fleet, effectively dooming the Japanese navy to defeat.        Cheers|`|AA11304025	The dive bomber was unique to the Luftwaffe and was called the Stuka or Junkers 87.  It main use was as a ground attack plane in support of the army when it would be targeted at enemy artillery and troop concentrations.  It was also used against coastal shipping.|`|6pksPo7Zaa	Dive bombers are associated with the early years of the Second World War.  They were often used as tactical ground attack support for advancing armies or as maritime weapons.  The Junker 87 especially was used at the start of the war.  It had Japanese equivalents, while some early British sngle engine planes, like the Fairey Firefly were used.  The Douglas Dauntless was a highly effective one in the Pacific.  They eventually became obselescent, firstly on grounds of performance and armament - the Junker 87 was shot out of the skies by the British fighters long before the end of the Battle of Britian, and payload,  with medium - and heavy bombers proving a much better investment.  Also, dive bombers are based on the notion that the principle defence will be ground based.  ONce countries built up their fighter commands, it became more necessary to approach the target in defensible formations.  There still were occasional attacks by Focke Wulfe and Junker 88 fighter bombers, but these achieved little.|`|241a517cc8a625c9b4b9fe2419fcfe10aa	Anything! If you were a child during the war you were a target. The principal aim of the Luftwaffe was to demoralise the British people in the mistaken belief that we would surrender. Consequently, they targeted our homes, our businesses, our factories, and ourselves time and time again. Do you think you could tolerate 12 hours in an air-raid shelter, listen to a constant bombardment of bombs whistling down on you, hear the all-clear, and find your home in ruins? That happened to my family on five occasions, and on three occasions were we buried in the ruins of the house for three days. I hope and pray you never go through the hell us children went through between 1940 and 1945.

h8moLlUWaa	ok here is your constructive criticism. o first thing is the front legs. the back legs are good and nicely shaped but the front legs need more width and a a tiny bit of bending. the head is very good but the tail needs to have some drama. perhaps coiled or wagging and needs to be a little less lifeless. the ears look good and the eyes are fine. try to make the lower jaw just a tiny bit longer but not passing the nose. make the stomach a little less roundish because that makes him look heavy set. also were the front leg should overlap the body a little instead of meeting with it. add a littlfuzziness to the fur and that's about it it i hope that was a good answer for you i give it a 3/5 but don't get me the wrong way because i think you draw very good. :]|`|g8kIjpwSaa	I like it. I agree with that head proportion comment but the only other thing would say is that the front legs need to bend. I wolf's legs cannot anatomically be that straight.|`|6TPEyJqhaa	Try to find a photo to look off of when you draw the wolf.  It will help with proportions and show you where to shade.  Looks good though...keep it up|`|NBo2ucWsaa	Yay! Another wolf artist! =] I'm a huge wolf artist too. XD  The only thing I see is the head proportion. It's a little small for the body. Other than that, I see no problem. =] Well done. I really like the fur and the stance your wolfie is in.   You should get a Deviant Art and add me. =] We could help each other out. (I've started out a few weeks ago)  And good idea, to have a picture reference. Those are really helpful.  Another thing: look up some "wolf anatomy" books or website references. Learning the basic structure of what you're drawing ahead of time will bring you terrific results in the end. =]|`|doSdEtqYaa	Yup. This one looks good. try shading if you know how to do it and don't color it. enjoy;)|`|stWGfFeTaa	try making more detail, like fur and leg muscles. it doesnt have to be a lot just a few. make it less flat as u can, i always try to keep the in mind. its all about shading. a helmet could be flat, but once i add shading to the back to make it look like the like is hitting it from the side u see it from, it looks round on the sides|`|AA10652010	Very nice. The only thing is the legs. I like the looseness you have when you drew the head and tail. ANd i feel when you got to the legs maybe it wasn't as interesting to you, so you didn't put as much into studying them.  It's not that they look wrong.I just think if you want to improve that's one thing I can see that could be drawn with more feeling.   I know legs can seem boring and so you just draw them. I cna see by the heaviness of the lines in the head  and tail that you put more attention into drawing them.   To get more feeling and interesting lines, in the legs maybe when you look at the picture, Look at things like negative space.The shape in between the legs, the space around the legs and draw that.   Look at the angle of the front legs. The gracefulness in that line. Think of them as shapes,and not legs.Draw the shapes, and the little curves in that shape. It will give you a more natural line.  Hope this helps and doesn' t confuse you. I really like the drawing, and I'm just trying to help you improve an already good drawing.  I think you have real talent.  Babu|`|5b5eb51d139accc411320f16a6c2bb07aa	check out drawspace.com you can look through lessons free if you sign up    i think it'll help you out|`|YMJJJ1xraa	I would shade it and detail it more
rd6FhBBBaa	You and I have a lot in common my friend. We think a lot alike. For years I have sat back and observed the interactions between the sheep and their shepherds. Studied history books, read about humanity's so called great leaders. What I have concluded is that the world has always been like this, and it will probably never change. Despite what others might say. You understand a lot about the world. But do you really know what it means to live? Why we are here? Never mind the Whys and the Whats. The answers you seek are out there, you just have to take heed of what has been around since the beginning. Listen to the mother earth's lesson. God is the earth. This is the only visual representation we humans have. Watch and listen.<br>  We are the select few. We are children of the earth mother. We see things most do not. They come to us for understanding.<br>  The world will end. But not yet.<br>  <br>  Live happily|`|3d7f120f2bf9906d7333799542b3a295aa	A couple of things make this happen.  You see the crazy world for what it is, but you make the mistake of reacting to it with negative emotions. This creates fear and confusion, worry and depression. Trying to play God and figure it all out will drive you insane.  This is your ego or will getting in the way of life, something that is already happening to you.  If you could live each day, moment to moment without judgment but simply with a good will towards each experience, the sun would come out from behind the clouds.<br>  You could also be undergoing a change, a spiritual growth spurt, and who knows how bad a catepillar feels before it changes into a butterfly.  Take heart, life is full of these valleys, and passing through each one makes you better fit for the next.|`|xZI6noJiaa	Um. Sounds like you might need to go see a therapist.<br>  The funny thing is you talk about only seeing other peoples' narcissism, yet the whole paragraph hints at how you feel the world isn't worthy of YOUR time and effort.|`|9pTMArTQaa	Taking medication is evil. Especially when a doctor prescribes it.|`|n5fZo5njaa	Please learn how to write a paragraph before you turn 20.<br>  <br>  spaces between sentence groups are friendly to the readers|`|HPpdcAtAaa	Life is imperfect, but that's what makes it great.<br>  <br>  Be in the moment--don't think about what might or might not happen--you just waste energy on it.  Read Eckart Tolle's book, "New Earth" it seems to address a lot of your concerns.  Also, try Marianne Williamson's "Reflections on Love" which address what you're saying from a spiritual/religious level as well.<br>  <br>  I would just look into this a little bit, you sound a little down, possibly a little anxious as well--this site goes over anxiety/depression issues, what it is and how to get help for it:<br>  <a href="http://www.findingdulcinea.com/guides.topic__ss_categories_ss_health_ss_Anxiety-and-Depression.xa_1.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.findingdulcinea.com/guides.to...</a>|`|bXcmhRUOaa	There are definitely problems in the world today,  but just surrendering to a feeling of helplessness is overwhelming. Find something that disturbs you and learn about it and fight against it. That will give you a purpose.  Just remember that it is also necessary to give your mind a vacation occasionally.  There is no need to travel for that, reading an enjoyable book or indulging in a small luxury - like a yummy treat - or just enjoying the view will help to ease your mind.
f5102665c0d003999bcb3d1a399fb55eaa	Well i'm a dancer and i know how to split. its rather easy you just have to stretch out your muscles because right know they are probably cramped together.     You should try putting you leg up on the wall and seeing how high u can go untill it hurts and keep it there till it stop hurting and do this everyday or twice a day and everytime go alittle higher.. Do this with both legs.     And then try to sit in a split after that and go until it hurts and push down and hold it there .. it  shouldn;t take so long to split    Good Luck|`|BewDjhcZaa	you have to do them every day and if you go time with out doing them they will not be as flat if youre just average flexible start with holding as far as you can go for one min each way (left right middle) and gravity will help you also for middle sit facing a wall in straddle and try to get your legs pushed as far as you can go against the wall till eventually your whole leg will be flat against the wall and youll have a good middle split also for middle you can lay with your back on the floor butt against the wall and spread your legs and gravity will push them to the ground for me it took about 2 monthes practicing everyday twice a day to get a flat right split my left is about 3 inches off the ground and my middle is 5 inches off the ground i hope this helps and if you need any clarification just ask :] good luck|`|P5iXwQtJaa	WHY would you want to the Splits???

BTk2yLqbaa	As time went on, there were changes in military equipment. The mail armor of the Augustan period gave way to the lorica segmentata (segmented armor) by the time of Claudius. Later, by the third century, lorica segmentata gave way to scale and mail armor which extended to below the knees, offering greater protection to the soldier. Hemets also changed. The Imperial Gallic helmets of the early Empire eventually gave way (third century) to later types with more extensive neck and cheek guards, although by midcentury, such optimum head protection was sacrificed for economic reasons. Mid third century troops often wore the mail hood or coif; cheap Romano-Sassanian helmets were also produced. Regarding offensive gear, by the third century, the Roman soldier was no longer mainly a swordsman but a spearman. There were organizational changes too. Instead of employing entire legions in campaigns, late second and third century armies often consisted of detachments or vexillations, drawn from a number of legions, which tended to occupy fixed frontier positions.

d014f113fb3eecfed19b0fbba5d885d9aa	The old adage is that a picture is worth a thousand words!  This has been true for thousands of years.  Before man had a written language, we used pictures.  If you need to communicate something quickly to someone, it is always better to use a picture. That is why we have international driving (as in using a car) signs.  It does not mater what language a person speaks or does not speak – we can communicate with pictures.<br>  <br>  Graphs are a special type of a picture that indicates how groups/number can be displayed in a simple, quick manner.  A run chart, pie charts, histogram, Pareto chart or any number of other graphics can show any amount of data in a very quick illustration.<br>  <br>  So, if an author can use pictures/graphics in the presentation, paper, book, etc. a lot of time and effort can be saved trying to explain the situation at hand.  A simple example could be trying to explain the number of people at different ages who can drive a vehicle safely.  You can explain all of the numbers around what causes unsafe driving, who has what accidents, what constitutes good driving, etc.  Or you can simply show a double circle with the outside one being the total number of drivers (in a given state or country) and the inner circle (divided as a pie chart on some aid groupings) showing all safe drivers.  The graphic will make a much stronger case of what you are trying to describe than it would take to try to explain it.|`|7KcVSB3Uaa	Humans are visual thinkers. What might take three pages of text to explain can often be shown in a few inches with a table, bar graph or picture. It also helps to ensure that they are understanding what you are telling them, and when you can be sure they understand, you strengthen your argument.<br>  <br>  As for statistics, they show that you are not simply making your numbers up. You are giving an exact number, and quoting your source. Saying, "Most people who have three arms are Martians" sounds like a generalization, and does not constitute proof. And what is most? However, saying, "Studies show that 93% of people with three arms are Martians" is much more convincing, and shows that you have done your research before making a claim.
p97LHFiBaa	I also gave up on them. I didn't even finish Blood Noir, too bored with it. I agree that she'll eventually shift to something, because it will give Hamilton another direction to go. According to her website, it's going to be a very long series, she'll need a new catalyst to push it forward.<br>  <br>  My guess is that her first shift will be an animal she didn't know she was carrying. I also assume that she'll be able to infect people, because I think that guy that abused the leopards infected her with a couple wereanimals.|`|TAIlyvgyaa	I gave up on the Anita Blake books a while back.<br>  <br>  I really, really enjoyed the story telling of the books, I got very invested in various characters, but ultimately got really bored with all the sex.  Eventually, these books ended up being a little light plot served along with a big plate of porn.<br>  <br>  To specifically answer your question, I think Anita will shift, but mainly because it gives Hamilton a whole load of new sex scenes to write.
qXAvXHdYaa	I think what you should do first is look into education and mentoring.  A camera is just a tool a photographer uses and if this is something you want to make a profession of, you will know what kind of camera you will need once properly educated.<br>  <br>  I do understand that equipment cost can be an issue for a startup.  I started out with an entry level DSLR(Nikon D50) and invested in good lenses that I have carried over to the Nikon D300 i use for my business now.<br>  <br>  Other than a better dynamic range and better low light/hi ISO noise performance I can get equivalent images from the D50 as I do the D300.  The D300 with it's controls and layout make getting some images easier.  The camera itself does not necessarily make the image better.<br>  I still to this day use the D50 for professional work - although it is now more of a backup body.<br>  <br>  I would think that starting out you can get a good Nikon D40/D40x/D60/D90 kit or a Canon XT/XTi/XS/XSi kit for a very good price.  Just go out and look at the camera and see which one feels right to you.  Then, think about the types of photography you will be doing and make sure that the system you buy into has the lenses and accessories you need to make that happen.<br>  <br>  Just remember, that if you want great stuff, be prepared to pay a high price for it.  There are some good bargain stuff out there that is good, but you really need to do your research on them.|`|saYkDVGlaa	I think guyster hit the key point in buying any camera.  Ergonomics.  How does the camera feel in your hands.  I recommend you figure out your total budget, remove 10% (for memory cards, batteries etc) and then handle all of the brands in that range.  Don't worry about what the buttons and dials do, but how comfortable they are for you to operate.  Then start shopping for the best price on your selection.  Remember, Once you go to a DSLR and purchase a couple of lenses, you will probably stay with that brand forever rather than start over again on your system.  Also, when you start buying lenses, buy the best you can afford.  The glass is the most important part of a DSLR system.  I suggest you do NOT buy the lenses designated for "digital" cameras.  The Canon EF-S series and whatever Nikon calls theirs.  These are designed for the small sensor cameras Canon Rebels and Nikon D40's etc.  They are usually not compatible with full frame cameras which you will probably decide to upgrade to if you do go pro.<br>  I can only speak for Canon since that is where I started 30 years ago, but the 30D, 40D, 50D series is a very good "prosumer" camera series and the prices on the 30D/40D are coming down nicely with the 50D hitting the market.|`|7ciw1aCXaa	I favour an Olympus E520 twin lens kit as the dust reduction and anti-shake is built into the body, letting you use many different, older and cheaper lenses. The downside is the 4/3 sensor is not as good as the Nikon or Canon sensors.<br>  <br>  A Nikon D40x can picked up for a good price now and has a good range of lenses - the 18-200mm Vibration reduction lens is a cracking multipurpose lens, but costs more than the camera!<br>  <br>  Canon are regarded as better for telephoto work, e.g. sports & wildlife, due to their lenses.|`|a212QBxFaa	I think that the Nikon D40 is a great choice.  My advise is not to buy a camera that you can grow in to.  Technology is changing very fast.  If, after a couple of years you decide you want a professional model camera, buy what is available then.  The Nikon lens that you get now will work with a future Nikon for example.|`|AA11318851	Canon and Nikon are both great. I have owned both.  I prefer Nikon's ergonomics (in particular the command dials), but I got used to Canon.<br>  <br>  One tip, if you want to do wildlife or sports, go with Canon. When I got into bird/wildlife photography I switched over to Canon. Their telephoto lenses are generally better and wider ranged. <br>  <br>  Word on the street used to be that Nikon had better macro support and better flash, but Canon has since closed that gap.|`|Bk4eIAWWaa	The body will be upgraded as your abilities require, but your lenses will stay with you for years. A low end Nikon or Canon DSLR body will work fine as you learn and possibly end up your back up camera some day. Concentrate on building your system with good quality lenses, not third party if possible, good flash system and other peripherals that will travel with you as you grow.|`|TlLA1DVoaa	I purchased a Canon Rebel DSLR last year, and it has worked wonderfully. I'm just an amateur photographer with a passion for cameras and a desire to learn more, and the Canon Rebel has been perfect. It's simple to use yet has a wide range of capabilities. It's not $1000, either! <br>  <br>  Here's a link on Amazon to the camera I'm talking about. I highly recommend it. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Canon-Digital-10-1MP-18-55mm-3-5-5-6/dp/B000I1ZWRC/ref=pd_bbs_4?ie=UTF8&s=electronics&qid=1235664079&sr=8-4" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/Canon-Digital-10-1...</a>|`|2bVxBCgzaa	The Canon XSi is rated the best entry-level DSLR, with comparable image quality to more expensive cameras in many ways. Excellent features as well.<br>  <br>  I have to recommend AGAINST getting the Olympus E-520. Oly has excellent lenses, and the cameras are very full-featured, but the sensors are very noisy, particularly if you want to do any kind of night shooting or long exposures. There are some things I really don't like from a functionality aspect as well- I'm selling mine to move into Canon or Nikon, depending on their next models. There is also Sony and Pentax to consider. But I'm going with one of the big two- there's a reason pros use them.<br>  <br>  Both are excellent systems, with strengths and weaknesses particular to your needs. Handling is a very big factor. Read all the reiews, decide on your budget and features, and go try them out. You might consider renting each camera for a day if you can. It's hard to tell in a store how the camera will really perform for YOU when you're out shooting.|`|2d1281aa57d4a1706e1d2a23da968188aa	I agree the Nikon D40 is probably the best entry-level DSLR out there.<br>  <br>  If you already have lenses from a previous 35mm camera set, that often makes the decision for you- buy a camera which can take advantage of the glass you've already invested in.<br>  <br>  If you're starting from scratch, I recommend going to a camera shop and holding both the Nikon D40 and Canon 400D/Xti, see which feels better- is more comfortable in your hands, which viewfinder you like, which positioning of controls you prefer etc.  Both are excellent, but the ergonomics are different.|`|tKWwZpOAaa	You can pick up a nikon d40 pretty cheap with a kit lens to get you started.|`|bocePfyYaa	As a first DSLR, I really think that Sony has done the best job of making them easy to use. They also are generally less expensive than their Nikon, Canon, Pentax, and Olympus counterparts. My sony a700 which is comparable to a Nikon D300 costs about half as much.<br>  <br>  But, the thing about choosing a brand, it is a committment. Once you start investing in one brand, you really want to stay with that brand because you already have accessories for it. So you need to really research the pros and cons of each brand to choose one. Go to dpreview and check out the reviews on the cameras and even check out the forums.<br>  <br>  Visit a camera or electronics store. Because you also need to hold the models in your hands. Feel the grip and see how it sits in your hands. Navigate through the menu and see how you like the user interface. Play with all the buttons. Take a couple of memory cards with you if you have them. Most DSLRs will take either a compact flash, an SD or a memory stick. Make sure the camera is in jpeg and not raw shooting mode because you can't view the raw on your pc without converting them to a different file type first. Snap some pictures with low ISO, and high ISO. Change some settings. Remember that these are display models that hundreds of people have played with and probably banged around too, so don't fault the manufacturer if something is not working anymore.<br>  <br>  When you get home, put the pictures on your pc and look to see which ones have the better IQ. I bet they will be very similar for comparable models. But this is a lesson in itself. It shows you that the camera isn't what makes a picture better. It is you.<br>  <br>  The kit lenses that come with most cameras are ok. They are not as bad as some people like to believe. No, a $200 kit lens is not going to be as good as a $2000 lens. If it were no one would buy the $2000 lens. I had only my first 35mm camera body and the kit lens that came with it for three years and never bought another lens for it. I just switched to digital myself and I use the 18-70mm kit lens and a 70-300mm lens I bought for the super-telephoto reach.<br>  <br>  The alternative that I generally recommend is to get the body only (unless it costs the same as getting it with the kit lens-then why not-and B&H does this a lot) and then get the Tamron 18-250mm lens. It is made for the Nikon, Canon, Sony and Pentax mounts. It runs $459 at B&H. If you have the money, get the entry level camera body and then this lens.<br>  <br>  You can get an entry level camera body only (or some with the kit lens) for $500-600 and then the 18-250mm lens for $459 would run you a total of $949-1049.<br>  <br>  But don't forget about the extras. The camera is going to come with a USB cord, a battery and charger, a manual and software. But you will have to buy a memory card if you don't already have one-and you might want at least two to start with. And you will need some kind of case or bag to protect the camera and lens when you aren't using it. You might want an extra battery so you can always have the extra one charged and ready to go. And a microfiber cloth and a hurricane or rocket style blower to blow any dust from your lens or camera body while shooting. This should be all you need to get started. These accessories should run you about $100-150 depending on the brand and size you want.<br>  <br>  You should get in the habit of doing a quick clean-up each time you put the camera and lens away so it is clean and ready to go the next time you get it out.<br>  <br>  And have fun using the camera. That is what really matters.

CGpgg7Rpaa	i got mine to 180 by using a wall to stretch.  Arabesque, then push against the wall. Just be very careful and make sure you're warmed up. Unfortunately, I don't know many stretches for this. I highly suggest you check the forums at dance.net. Here are some links you can try:  http://www.dance.net/read.html?postid=66...  http://www.dance.net/topic/7723131/1/Bal...  http://www.dance.net/topic/5925027/1/Adv...    Also, you can ask your teacher for suggestions.    Congrats on getting the lead! Enjoy! :)|`|a4zo8RnOaa	Stregthen your back, it'll help a lot. When you go to do them, make sure your warmed up, no sence hurting yourself. Improving your arabesque will also help. Your close, it won't take too much more! You'll get it in no time :D    Congrats on the part!
uC55n3HIaa	Excellent! Someone with actual sketches rather than just ideas! Well then, I would recommend you to check out <a href="http://www.designerbloc.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.designerbloc.com/</a> it's a community for fashion designers to display their designs, get community feedback, and meet other designers. It would be a great place to post your designs and get some critique. You can try and get a feel for design by looking at other peoples designs and also asking some questions in the forums.<br>  <br>  To actually start making things will take a lot more skill. I would recommend you to ask some relatives if they know how to sew, and learn from them.|`|K4rP4A0naa	Practice you drawing. You'll want some good figure drawings when applying to a design school, which you almost have to do to be a fashion designer.<br>  <br>  Also, learn as much about designers as you can so you've got a good knowledge base on what different ones do. You'll need to be able to discuss designers and why you like them etc.<br>  <br>  Then apply to a design school when you leave high school.<br>  <br>  If you are serious about becoming a designer, do all that, but if you just want to play, do a part-time course in sewing and you can make your own stuff. You can do that until you're old enough to go to design school too and it will help you get in.|`|epyTmcOdaa	I had a freind who wanted to be fashion designer and she went to paris and now she studies designe.I wish i could help you more but i am sure that you can be a good designer because you plan for it in 15.Good luck & be strong in your way|`|dUQNOUwLaa	Start making things. I would like to do the same.<br>  Buy a mannequin, sewing machine and start experimenting, you could sew by hand.<br>  Or you could begin by adapting items of clothing that you already have. <br>  <br>  GCSE art or textiles will be good for the future and in the future and A level or BTEC in art and design or textiles course. <br>  <br>  Good luck.
nfUomw3caa	In such a short life there were many turning points. He wrote a Noble prize winning book, "Portraits in Courage". He joined the navy at the outbreak of World War II, in which he was a P.T. boat commander. Then wile patrolling off the Solomon Islands his P.T. boat was cut in half by a Japanese destroyer.

vLaEZWzPaa	May be a spoiler or two, just so you know.    Well, she isn't shy; not at all. She's outspoken, and doesn't try to change herself for anyone. Either they like her as she is, or they don't, and she doesn't care a bit what their opinion is. She tends to be sarcastic, and leans towards violence rather than negotiation when it comes to the more spiteful ghosts she encounters. She likes independence; it makes her irritable when someone suggests she may need help or can't take care of herself. She also seems to posess a bit of a temper, and is protective of others.    As far as physical characteristics, she's sixteen, and has dark hair, and wears black fairly often (a certain black [leather?] jacket is mentioned several times throughout the series).    She's also somewhat concerned with having a social life, and occasionally expresses a desire to get a boyfriend. In the book Shadowland, she has some attraction to a boy named Bryce (I think), but it never really turns into anything.    And there ya go. That's basically most of what I remember about her.    Edit: Ah, wait - there is also the obvious fact that she is a Mediator; Or, basically, she can see and talk to ghosts. :)

vqUVWPBAaa	He does not die...A Child Called It was the first in his trilogy. Lost Boy and A Man Named Dave came after that. He also authored two more  books, The Privileged of Youth and Help Yourself for Teens. His brother Richard (Russell) wrote a book a few years ago detailing his abuse called A Brother's Journey. Russell was described by Dave in one his book as the child that suffered abuse after he (Dave) was removed from the home.  I think his father Stephen was as guilty as his mother because he did nothing to help his children out. For some reason Dave seem to adore him enough to name his oldest child after his father. Go figure.|`|s3HK7Mv1aa	No...    He wrote the book himself, and there is an afterword about his life as an adult.|`|kHR47Vjyaa	No, it's a true story.  How could have he written if he died?

The second Idid he got confident.His mouth moved over mine in a rough, unpracticed, awkward back-and-forth motion, so fast it was as if he was trying to create fire with our lips."    Kate Brian (Invitation Only)    "Tradition, Honor, Excellence."    "Everything is gray." (Part of the opening line.)    "Business before pleasure. And trust me, it was a pleasure meeting you."

fMfBAgOUaa	If someone told you that it is wrong to like something because you are christian... that just goes to show you how flawed christianity (and religion in general...) is. You are allowed to listen to, do, watch, whatever you want. I am not a religious person, as you might have already noticed, but here is my perspective on this sort of thing. If you do bad things as a result/influence of the games you play, music you listen to, or movies you watch, it might be a good indicator that you shouldnt partake in those activities. If you can choose right from wrong and be a "good" person, who cares what kinds of games you play or music you listen to? I listen to lots of death metal and play violent games... but does that make me a bad person? No it does not. What would make me a bad person, would be taking lyrics/game violence literally and going out and killing people etc.|`|joA5Rcyzaa	wow...haha just wow    serious?|`|ZQaeTgNEaa	don't worry    there are people with strong christian beliefs that are making the world a horrible place.    and really, who cares?

I would say:  Your faith is a personal thing  If your feeling guilty about it, then maybe you shouldn't be doing it.  The point is look within yourself, ask yourself if you think it goes againest your faith  Don't ask others if your in violation of your faith.  Do you really trust others to make a decision about your faith? especially via the interent?    Problem with most people is, they know the answer, they just do not want to admit it to them selfs  or  They are seeking someone else to justify what they are doing    I would say you feel it goes againest your faith . I would bet you already know the answer, as to how you feel but do not want to admit it to yourself  and you are only asking in a attempt to justify it to yourself    If I am right, then all I can say is, it must be ok , since everyone else does it , right?  Chances are you already know the answer. Can you handle being honest with yourself?  Being honest with ones self is the hardest thing to do, especially when you are wanting to justify your actions|`|MXjvZMUXaa	Metallica are christians too|`|oQ0S4XVQaa	But now we are delivered from the law, that being dead wherein we were held; that we should serve in newness of spirit, and not in the oldness of the letter.  Romans 7:6    as Christians, we are supposed to live Holy seperate lives from those who refuse to believe.  That does not mean however, that we cannot listen to some music and play some games.  It all depends on the condition of your spirit as a person, and your relationship with Christ.  If listening to metallica and playing shooter games cause you to sin on a regular basis, you should know that you should personally avoid them.  If, however, they in no wise cause a hinderance in your daily walk with HIM, then... I don't see the problem at all.    =] It's all about the Word, and what IT says.

35GfsJ3Paa	Audition for music school. It's a little late now - most applications were due in December. Smaller community colleges with music schools may still be holding auditions.<br>  <br>  If you have limited playing experience, such as just playing in high school band plus some solo and ensemble contest, a community college music school would be a good place to start. You can always audition at larger and better music schools as a transfer student next year. <br>  <br>  Here are a few steps:<br>  <br>  1. Put together a music resume: include high school band, (ex. Principle clarinetist, Symphonic Band, ____ High School, 2006-2009), any Youth Orchestra, honor bands, solo and ensemble contest, chamber groups, musical awards and honors, etc.<br>  <br>  2. If you are not already taking private lessons, find the best teacher in your area and start. It's pretty much impossible to be a professional musician or get into music school without a very good teacher. <br>  <br>  3. It is very difficult to get into any professional performing ensemble without a college degree in music, or at least several years of intensive and extensive study on your instrument - more that just high school.<br>  <br>  4. Play in as many community and college ensembles as possible. Most metro areas have community bands/orchestras. Get together a chamber ensemble, join a choir, anything and everything.<br>  <br>  Also remember that it is possible and very enjoyable to be a non-professional musician. Community ensembles, churches, and just for fun are all great reasons to keep playing, without persuing a career in music.<br>  <br>  Best of luck, and happy playing!|`|3xHuLeiTaa	See if you can get into a music school.|`|AA10941265	I think you should apply for a conservatory.

(:<br>  <br>  Digital Fortress by Dan Brown:<br>  Chillingly current and filled with more intelligence secrets than Tom Clancy, Digital Fortress transports the reader deep within the most powerful intelligence organization on earth--the National Security Agency (NSA)--an ultra-secret, multi-billion dollar agency which (until now) less than three percent of Americans knew existed.<br>  <br>  When the NSA's most classified technological wonder--an invincible code-breaking machine--encounters a mysterious code it cannot break, the agency calls in its head cryptographer, Susan Fletcher, a brilliant and beautiful mathematician. What she uncovers sends shock waves through the corridors of power.<br>  <br>  The NSA is being held hostage... not by guns or bombs, but by a code so ingeniously complex that if released it will cripple U.S. intelligence.<br>  <br>  Caught in an accelerating tempest of secrecy and lies, Susan Fletcher battles to save the agency she believes in. Betrayed on all sides she finds herself fighting not only for her country, but for her life, and in the end, for the life of the man she loves.<br>  <br>  With a startling twist that leaves the agency scrambling to avert the biggest intelligence disaster in U.S. history, Digital Fortress never lets up.<br>  <br>  From the underground hallways of power, to the skyscrapers of Tokyo, to the towering cathedrals of Spain, a desperate race unfolds. It is a battle for survival -- a crucial bid to destroy a creation of inconceivable genius... an impregnable code-writing formula that threatens to obliterate the balance of power. Forever.<br>  <br>  Deception Point by Dan Brown:<br>  When a new NASA satellite spots evidence of an astonishingly rare object buried deep in the Arctic ice, the floundering space agency proclaims a much-needed victory… a victory that has profound implications for U.S. space policy and the impending presidential election.<br>  <br>  With the Oval Office in the balance, the President dispatches White House Intelligence analyst Rachel Sexton to the Milne Ice Shelf to verify the authenticity of the find. Accompanied by a team of experts, including the charismatic academic Michael Tolland, Rachel uncovers the unthinkable—evidence of scientific trickery—a bold deception that threatens to plunge the world into controversy.<br>  <br>  But before Rachel can contact the President, she and Michael are attacked by a deadly task force…a private team of assassins controlled by a mysterious powerbroker who will stop at nothing to hide the truth. Fleeing for their lives in an environment as desolate as it is lethal, they possess only one hope for survival: to find out who is behind this masterful ploy. The truth, they will learn, is the most shocking deception of all…<br>  <br>  In his most thrilling novel to date, bestselling author Dan Brown transports readers from the ultra-secret National Reconnaissance Office to the towering ice shelves of the Arctic Circle, and back again to the hallways of power inside the West Wing. Heralded for masterfully intermingling science, history, and politics in his critically acclaimed thriller Angels & Demons, Brown has crafted another novel in which nothing is as it seems—and behind every corner is a stunning surprise. DECEPTION POINT is pulse-pounding fiction at its best.<br>  <br>  The Da Vinci Code by Dan Brown:<br>  While in Paris on business, Harvard symbologist Robert Langdon receives an urgent late-night phone call: the elderly curator of the Louvre has been murdered inside the museum. Near the body, police have found a baffling cipher. Solving the enigmatic riddle, Langdon is stunned to discover it leads to a trail of clues hidden in the works of Da Vinci…clues visible for all to see…and yet ingeniously disguised by the painter.<br>  <br>  Langdon joins forces with a gifted French cryptologist, Sophie Neveu, and learns the late curator was involved in the Priory of Sion—an actual secret society whose members included Sir Isaac Newton, Botticelli, Victor Hugo, and Da Vinci, among others. The Louvre curator has sacrificed his life to protect the Priory's most sacred trust: the location of a vastly important religious relic, hidden for centuries.<br>  <br>  In a breathless race through Paris, London, and beyond, Langdon and Neveu match wits with a faceless powerbroker who appears to work for Opus Dei—a clandestine, Vatican-sanctioned Catholic sect believed to have long plotted to seize the Priory's secret. Unless Langdon and Neveu can decipher the labyrinthine puzzle in time, the Priory's secret—and a stunning historical truth—will be lost forever.<br>  <br>  In an exhilarating blend of relentless adventure, scholarly intrigue, and cutting wit, symbologist Robert Langdon (first introduced in Dan Brown's bestselling Angels & Demons) is the most original character to appear in years. THE DA VINCI CODE heralds the arrival of a new breed of lightening-paced, intelligent thriller…surprising at every twist, absorbing at every turn, and in the end, utterly unpredictable…right up to its|`|VguTXBdBaa	Assassin's Apprentice.

AHJQfHx9aa	The first thing when writing your first novel is not to worry about what not to do or to do.    Your first novel is a freebie.  It won't be any good on the first try no matter what you do, so you should just try to get it onto the page in it's entirety.  People underestimate what a mental challenge it can be to write 90,000 words about the same story.  It's often not as easy as assumed, and what you'll learn from your first attempt is largely what you have to do to get it done.    The second thing not to do is let yourself get discouraged.  As I said, it will not always come out the way you vision it in your head.  It doesn't for anybody.  You have to learn to put it out there and move on to the next part.  If you can't master that skill you'll never finish anything.    The third thing not to do is fool yourself into thinking you'll always feel inspiration.  It'll come and go, and usually fades pretty fast every ten or twenty thousand words.  You have to work through that.  Writing is craft as much as art.  It's a passion to be sure, but it's a job more often.    The fourth thing not to do is let yourself believe in the myth of 'writer's block.'  There is no such thing.  There is such a thing as 'lazy writer syndrome' and that often masks itself as writer's block.  If you feel yourself succumbing get up, walk around, sit back down and write something.  Don't make excuses, just do it.      The fifth and final thing to not do on your first novel is fail to have fun.  It will be difficult and frustrating sometimes, maybe a lot of the time, but you're still doing something neat.  You're expressing yourself, and accomplishing a goal.  Try to maintain a positive out look.    Finally, when you finish your first novel print it out, hold it in your hand to feel the weight, and then put it in your closet and work on something else.  Maybe read a book or two (Telling Lies for Fun and Profit by Lawrence Block, or The Artful Edit by Susan Bell).  A few months later pull that manuscript out and admit to yourself that you didn't know how to write well.  Then you make it better.  Or write another one.  You do this until you can say to yourself, "I think I've sort of started figuring this writing thing out."    Good luck, have fun, and write.|`|f4DHP9ysaa	dont plagirize?|`|CvBJ3RKPaa	Most important, Have a complete story in mind.  Outline the plot, even if it's a short, sketchy outline.  You MUST know how the story ends before writing it -- don't depend on improvisation or you'll never finish.      Don't think that interesting characters are all there is to a novel.  Events must happen.  Don't write a story in which everyone talks, but no one actually does anything.    Don't overwrite trivial actions.  Beginning writers think they have to describe every step in a minor action like answering the telephone.  Just say, "The phone rang.  It was Jim," or "There was a knock at the door.  It was Jim."    Don't succumb to that crap about Writer's Block.  It's baloney.  Real writers write everyday.  They don't whine that they're blocked.  Set a gaol -- say, two typewritten pages -- then accomplish it.    Don't edit yourself onthe first draft.  Just blurt everything out, good or bad.  On the 2nd draft, put in everything you think should be included.  third draft, remove everything that doesn't support the story.  Fourth draft, make it sound like you just thought of it.|`|S9jyc95jaa	Everyone has different writing styles, so there's not a hard-and-fast list of "don'ts".  One thing I would say is a "don't" is just jumping into the story with no pre-planning.  Write out an outline of your story from beginning to end, so you know where it's going when you begin.    That will make it much easier for you to pace the story and develop the characters, when you write with a definite idea of where you're going.|`|FLfmkNEAaa	1.

2QPUs8lBaa	what's the moral of your story? what's the theme, or underlying meaning? first you have to find the answer to that question. then, is there any recurring thing in your story? For example, I wrote a short story that begins with a girl looking at her reflection in the water until something disturbs the surface and creates ripples, then it ends with her looking at the ripples instead of her reflection, so i had the name have something to do with ripples. twilight also is a good example of that.    from the title you have now, here are some suggestions. they wont be very good though because i don't know what your story is about  - behind the mirror  - behind the surface  -the parralels  - underneath it all    i hope some of this helps|`|MoyvVnBZaa	I think it really depends on the plot and themes of the book. Some authors get their titles from a line in a poem (Of Mice and Men came from To a Mouse by Robert Burns; A Raisin in the Sun came from a Langston Hughes poem). Just think of the prevailing themes/ideas in your poem and try to think of a metaphor for them. For example, for Sylvia Plath's semi-autobiographical book about depression, she described her pain as being trapped under a bell jar; thus giving her the title The Bell Jar. Or maybe you could think of a significant detail or an important line of dialogue and use that. I'm sorry; I can't think of any really good examples right now...one example is in Judy Blume's book Here's to You, Rachel Robinson (sequel to Just As Long As We're Together)--the title comes from a line of dialogue from Rachel's brother which sums up a lot of his feelings towards her and the family (if you haven't read it, that's a large part of the plot.)

It can look just as unprofessional for a family member to try to slip your work into the cracks as it would be for you to send a manuscript to a publisher without making sure the company takes non-agent submissions.

So what you do with this outline is going to make the difference between a publishable story, or one that will be rejected.   Start writing, complete your story, go over it carefully, do any editing or revision that is needed, then put it away to 'cool off' for a month, go back and do a final revision and then post it.

Just to let you know, hon, this is not a summary or a synopsis.    What it is, is the spiel that is found on the back of the book jacket that tries to get the reader interested enough to buy the book.    It sounds like you're trying to weave a mystery, but trying too hard makes it sound convoluted.    By reading what you've written, I have no idea what the story is about and there is not enough information to make it interesting enough to buy the book.

DI9wXRVgaa	Every romance novelist should read a few of the 'greats, like Georgette Heyer,even if not a fan of the genre. I would obtain a degree in a field that interests me and maybe minor in English or Literature if I could start over again. You might want to join a forum like All About Romance (AAR). You don't actually have to join, but you can read tons of reviews about recent and older books. There are a lot of topics on the site and many different perspectives.  http://www.likesbooks.com/    Here is one article that asks various writers, "What is a Romance Novel:" http://www.likesbooks.com/romance.html    Typical often used plot devices that I am a little tired of:  Boy meets girl, conflict, cohesion, the big misunderstanding, etc. I enjoy historicals as long as they are not  complete "wallpaper" historicals. I like dark age, medieval, pirates, highland warrior, victorian, etc. I do not mind vampire, werewolf & shapeshifter as long as it is "romantica," otherwise, it is played out and the market is flooded with it. I am rare in that I *hate* chick lit.     At the time of this writing, my favorite romance writers are Jo Goodman, Helen Kirkman and Jayne Kentz (and all of her pen names). Their characters are strong, fully realized, *believable,* and witty in a dry sort of way; and, of course: sensual when the time is right :). Further, their heroines are rarely ever TSTL (too stupid to live) and the hero is rarely an outrageous jerk.  The more you read about romance, the more you will see acronyms such as TSTL.    In my view, most writers want the reader to feel intrigued. I like the tension and the unyielding curiousity about what is going to happen next. A reader may not like or understand a character or a particular plot device for a while there, but they stay up an extra hour later out of curiousity.    With romance: I like the happily-ever-after (HEA) ending.  With suspence: I like some type of closure since HEA isn't always practical.     Good luck! Never give up your aspiration to write - it may take awhile, but you WILL succeed :)|`|4f277076c7dd369d5ac6ab9f14e344f6aa	I'm in love with Vampire Romance novels like Lyndsey Sands and Mary Janice Davidson.

I have nothing against vampire romance novels, but reading Twilight makes me want to puke.    Just telling you to please not write a Twilight equilavent. ;)|`|Vc2ObdeOaa	That's great that you plan on being a romance novelist. I'm hoping to become a novelist as well, but not in a particular genre. My favorite romance novels, in actuality, the only novels that focus on romance that I read are by Jane Austen. I love the language, the style, the descriptions that she has, not to mention the deception (Jane Fairfax in Emma) or the happy endings (Mansfield Park) with everyone getting exactly what they deserve.     Oh, a romance novel it can be, but justice must reign. I like feeling as if everything's content and right in the world at the end, especially, for example, when a character who has been a complete and utter jerk suddenly changes in an instant and marries the beautiful, gentle and lovable main character, the book disgusts me.     Hope this helps.
2QPUs8lBaa	I would go with Kuaii, Hawaii. I've been there recently, and there are tons of palm trees and white sand beaches. It would also be an interesting place to set a story. If you haven't been there though I would research it before you decide to make it your setting. You don't want to write about something you don't know. If you are really serious about your story, you might want to consider even taking a trip there. If not, then go with Kuaii.

AA12016117	Probably television series, as there is so much in the books.  A film - unless there were several - would miss a lot out and enrage fans.  If you've seen the Harry Potter films, much was left out of those and the action/adventure took precedence over the character development and storyline.
iNXqiDIYaa	From Publishers Weekly  In this 1970s memoir, Traig describes how, from the age of 12 until her freshman year at Brandeis, she suffered from various forms of obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), including anorexia and a rarer, "hyper-religious form" of OCD called scrupulosity, in which sanctified rituals such as hand washing and daily prayer are repeated in endless loops. The daughter of a Jewish father and a Catholic mother, Traig becomes obsessed with Jewish ritual, inventing her own prayers since her Jewish education is limited. Initially, Traig's family is amused; eventually, they try to help. Still, this memoir is less about suffering than it is about punch lines. When Traig swathes herself in head-to-toe flannel on hot summer days, her mother points to a scantily clad teenager on a talk show entitled My Teen Dresses Too Sexy and suggests Traig cool off like the adolescent "in the red vinyl number with the cut-outs over the chest and fanny." Traig spoofs Jewish rituals, cracking up at elaborate bar mitzvahs produced like Las Vegas floor shows and the meticulous analysis that goes into deeming a food item kosher. The author's behavior makes her seem like a character on Seinfeld or Curb Your Enthusiasm, and her book is a funny though sometimes cursory look at mental illness.     that review and others at the link below where you can also use the "look inside" feature to sample the book yourself
iNXqiDIYaa	Plot summary Please wikify this article or section.  Help improve this article by adding relevant internal links. (November 2008)     Jeffrey Lionel Magee is orphaned at age three when his parents are killed in the famous P&W trolley accident. He spends the next eight years in the bizarre household of his Aunt Dot and Uncle Dan. Jeffrey's aunt and uncle live in the same house without speaking to one another; they use Jeffrey as their go-between. They hate each other, but being strict Catholics, they do not get divorced. At a choir concert taking place during Jefferey's twelfth year, Aunt Dot and Uncle Dan sit in attendance on opposite ends of a row of seats. The performance is suddenly interrupted by Jeffrey, who screams at the top of his lungs, "Talk! Talk, will ya! Talk! Talk! Talk!" Soon afterward, Jeffrey runs away from his strange relatives and enters the annals of legend.    After one year of running, Jeffrey arrives in Two Mills, a town racially segregated by Hector Street, which runs through the middle of town. Here he befriends people on both sides of the unofficial divide. Among them is the African-American family of Amanda Beale, which adopts Jeffrey for a time. Jeffrey "Maniac" Magee proceeds to become a neighborhood legend by, among other things, outdoing a gang of bullies led by John McNab; sitting on the doorstep of a reclusive, notoriously ill-tempered neighbor called Finsterwald; untying Cobbles' Knot (a reference to Alexander and the Gordian Knot), and standing up to a bully nick-named Mars Bar, who disguises his own fears by frightening all other children in Two Mills.    Later, Jeffrey meets McNab's little brothers Piper and Russell as they run away from home. In return for convincing his brothers to return home, John forgives Jeffrey and brings him home. In the McNab house, Jeffrey sees gluttony, squalor, racial prejudice, sloth, and malaise. He attempts to correct this by bribing his adopted younger brothers Piper and Russell into good behavior and by bringing "Mars Bar" Thompson (the East End's "harshest African-American child") to a family birthday party. The introduction of Mars Bar to the McNabs is a disaster, but ultimately teaches Jefferey a valuable lesson about his friend's character.    Due to struggles that result from his unique social position - that of a homeless integrator - Jeffrey leaves the McNabs and roams all over the town, sleeping where he might and running at his own great pace through the streets in the early morning. Mars Bar also goes running; when he meets Jeffrey, they run parallel, acknowledging one another in looks but not words.    During the course of their running, they come upon Piper and Russell. Russell is in danger of being hit by a trolley on the very same line which Jefferey's parents died. Jeffery helps them .him, Mars Bar takes both children to his own house, where his mother cares for them.    Homeless again, Jeffrey takes refuge in the buffalo enclosure of the New York zoo and meets Grayson, a former minor league pitcher. Mars Bar finds Maniac there and tells him what has happened. He also asks why Jeffrey did not attempt to rescue Russell. He then invites Jeffrey to visit his family, but Jeffrey declines.    On hearing of this refusal, Amanda Beale (who sees Jeffrey's welfare as her own responsibility) storms into the zoo and retrieves her friend. She insists that Jeffrey become a permanent resident in her house, and Jeffrey accepts.

She chooses to do this so that her mother, Rene, can travel with her new husband, Phil Dwyer, who is a minor league baseball player. Bella attracts much attention at her new school and is quickly befriended by several students. Much to her dismay, several boys in the school compete for shy Bella's attention. When Bella sits next to Edward Cullen in class on her first day of school, Edward seems utterly repulsed by her. However, over the next few days Edward warms up to her, and their newfound relationship reaches a climax when Bella is almost run over by a fellow classmate's van in the school parking lot. Seemingly defying the laws of reality, Edward saves her life by stopping the van with his bare hands. Bella then becomes hellbent on figuring out how Edward saved her life, and pesters him with questions constantly. After tricking a family friend, Jacob Black, into telling her local tribal legends, Bella concludes that Edward and his family are vampires who drink the blood of animals instead of humans. Edward reveals that he initially avoided Bella because the scent of her blood was so desirable to him. Over time, Edward and Bella fall in love. Their relationship is thrown into chaos when another vampire coven sweeps into Forks and James, a tracker vampire, decides that he wants to hunt Bella for sport. The Cullens plan to distract the tracker by splitting up Bella and Edward, and Bella is sent to hide in a hotel in Phoenix. Bella then gets a phone call from James in which he says that he has her mother, and that Bella must give herself up to save her. She does so and James attacks her, but Edward, along with the rest of the Cullen family, rescues Bella before James can kill her. Once they realize that James has bitten Bella's hand, Edward sucks the venom out of her system before it can spread and change her into a vampire. Upon returning to Forks, Bella and Edward attend their prom and Bella expresses her desire to become a vampire, which Edward refuses to let happen.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twilight_(n...    NEW MOON:  Isabella "Bella" Swan is thrown an eighteenth birthday party by Alice and Edward Cullen, the vampire she loves, and the rest of their vampire family. While unwrapping a gift, she gets a paper cut. Edward's brother Jasper, although attempting a non-human diet, is overwhelmed by the scent of blood and tries to attack Bella. In an attempt to keep her safe from the world of vampires, Edward tells Bella that he doesn't want her anymore and leaves the town of Forks, Washington, with his family. Bella becomes severely depressed and seeks comfort with Jacob Black, an old family friend who eases her pain over losing Edward. Bella and Jacob begin spending a lot of time together, and Bella soon discovers that the rush of adrenaline present when she places herself in dangerous situations stimulates hallucinations of Edward's voice. Bella begins seeking out dangerous behavior, such as riding a motorcycle, to trigger the illusions. Meanwhile, Bella finds out that Jacob is a werewolf. The werewolves begin to protect Bella from the pursuit of the vampire Victoria, who seeks revenge for the death of her mate, James, who was killed by the Cullens in Twilight. After Bella attempts cliff-diving near La Push, she gets caught in a riptide and is rescued by Jacob. At the same time, Alice Cullen, Edward's vampire sister who has visions of the future, has a vision of Bella jumping off the cliff. Presuming that Bella is dead, Alice rushes to Forks to check on Charlie Swan, Bella's father, while Edward calls Bella's home. Jacob answers and informs Edward that Charlie is at a funeral, referring to that of a man in town who had died of a heart attack, but Edward draws the conclusion that Jacob means Bella's funeral. Desperate after Bella's supposed death, Edward flies to Italy to see the Volturi, peace-keeping vampires who would be able to kill Edward, granting him leave of a world without Bella. Bella and Alice rush to Italy to stop Edward, and save him before it is too late. Before they leave Italy, the Volturi tell them that Bella, a human who knows of the existence of vampires, must either be killed or changed into a vampire herself. After they return to Forks, Edward explains to Bella that he only left in order to protect her, and she forgives him. The book ends with the Cullens voting in favor of Bella being changed into a vampire after her graduation, much to Edward's dismay.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Moon_(n...

HPpdcAtAaa	Read through this and you will find the answer (You've got to do some work on this--read the whole thing here: <a href="http://classics.mit.edu/Plato/protagoras.html" rel="nofollow">http://classics.mit.edu/Plato/protagoras...</a> and there's more information on an academic search engine: <a href="http://www.sweetsearch.com/search.html?q=Protagoras" rel="nofollow">http://www.sweetsearch.com/search.html?q...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  There is no difficulty, Socrates, in answering that the qualities of which you are speaking are the parts of virtue which is one.<br>  <br>  And are they parts, I said, in the same sense in which mouth, nose, and eyes, and ears, are the parts of a face; or are they like the parts of gold, which differ from the whole and from one another only in being larger or smaller?<br>  <br>  I should say that they differed, Socrates, in the first way; they are related to one another as the parts of a face are related to the whole face.<br>  <br>  And do men have some one part and some another part of virtue? Of if a man has one part, must he also have all the others?<br>  <br>  By no means, he said; for many a man is brave and not just, or just and not wise.<br>  <br>  You would not deny, then, that courage and wisdom are also parts of virtue?<br>  <br>  Most undoubtedly they are, he answered; and wisdom is the noblest of the parts.<br>  <br>  And they are all different from one another? I said.<br>  Yes.<br>  And has each of them a distinct function like the parts of the face;-the eye, for example, is not like the ear, and has not the same functions; and the other parts are none of them like one another, either in their functions, or in any other way? I want to know whether the comparison holds concerning the parts of virtue. Do they also differ from one another in themselves and in their functions? For that is clearly what the simile would imply.<br>  <br>  Yes, Socrates, you are right in supposing that they differ.<br>  Then, I said, no other part of virtue is like knowledge, or like justice, or like courage, or like temperance, or like holiness?<br>  <br>  No, he answered.<br>  Well then, I said, suppose that you and I enquire into their natures. And first, you would agree with me that justice is of the nature of a thing, would you not? That is my opinion: would it not be yours also?<br>  <br>  Mine also, he said.<br>  And suppose that some one were to ask us, saying, "O Protagoras, and you, Socrates, what about this thing which you were calling justice, is it just or unjust?"-and I were to answer, just: would you vote with me or against me?<br>  <br>  With you, he said.<br>  Thereupon I should answer to him who asked me, that justice is of the nature of the just: would not you?<br>  <br>  Yes, he said.<br>  And suppose that he went on to say: "Well now, is there also such a thing as holiness? "we should answer, "Yes," if I am not mistaken?<br>  <br>  Yes, he said.<br>  Which you would also acknowledge to be a thing-should we not say so?<br>  He assented.<br>  "And is this a sort of thing which is of the nature of the holy, or of the nature of the unholy?" I should be angry at his putting such a question, and should say, "Peace, man; nothing can be holy if holiness is not holy." What would you say? Would you not answer in the same way?<br>  <br>  [later on...]<br>  <br>  He assented.<br>  And we said that everything has only one opposite?<br>  Yes.<br>  Then, Protagoras, which of the two assertions shall we renounce? One says that everything has but one opposite; the other that wisdom is distinct from temperance, and that both of them are parts of virtue; and that they are not only distinct, but dissimilar, both in themselves and in their functions, like the parts of a face. Which of these two assertions shall we renounce? For both of them together are certainly not in harmony; they do not accord or agree: for how can they be said to agree if everything is assumed to have only one opposite and not more than one, and yet folly, which is one, has clearly the two opposites wisdom and temperance? Is not that true, Protagoras? What else would you say?<br>  <br>  He assented, but with great reluctance.<br>  Then temperance and wisdom are the same, as before justice and holiness appeared to us to be nearly the same. And now, Protagoras, I said, we must finish the enquiry, and not faint. Do you think that an unjust man can be temperate in his injustice?<br>  <br>  I should be ashamed, Socrates, he said, to acknowledge this which nevertheless many may be found to assert.
jvPToF4Laa	You need to develop your arms, pecs, and shoulders. Get small free weights, 10 lbs should do. You want curls, presses, and push-ups.    Squats and lunges (with small hand weights) will get your legs stronger. Also practice balance, and situps. Core strength is how you recover if anything goes less than perfectly in the lift.|`|kdMM7OAaaa	plea down farther and have your partner jump higher. then you should weight lift with your arms everyday so you will be able to handle her weight. also do lots of push ups, and ya work out alot
