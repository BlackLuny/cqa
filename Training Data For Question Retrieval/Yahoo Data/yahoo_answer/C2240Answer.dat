2Qr8vcAfaa	For quick, easy money it's best to make flax into BS - low level crafting required, and while it's boring can make decent money.<br>  <br>  You could try getting lucky with monster drops, although I do not advise this - you could spend more money than you make. <br>  <br>  If you have a high fishing it's best to get lobsters. If your fishing is around 80, get sharks in the fishing guild - it's good money.<br>  <br>  If you have a very high woodcutting, you could try cutting mages - this may be hard though. I would suggest yews though, since they have a high selling price these days.<br>  <br>  I wouldn't suggest mining, since it can take a while to earn a lot of money. However, buying supplies for steel bars and then making cannonballs (after the quest) is a good way to make money and train smithing - even if it is slow. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck making money ;) don't give up, and don't get bored - talk to people while you're doing it to keep entertained.

AA11578842	Round 1 - 5: Use only your pistol. Tell everyone else that too. Let the zombies come in so you can get the power-ups they occasionally drop. Board up the windows to get extra money. Aim for the chest for a few shots, then get a headshot for a lot of points.<br>  <br>  Round 6: Open the Hell/Help room. Use the magical toy box. Have the person who gets a flamethrower/ray gun/Browning/MG42 guard the door. Have 2 people guard the windows. 1 can guard the wall and provide back-up for the door when the guy is reloading.<br>  <br>  Round 15: Move upstairs. Camp in the corner near the other stairway/balcony thingy. You should have at least 1 person with a ray gun, preferably 2 or more. Shoot at the window and doorway. Wait until people get bored + leave, or just die, or get hungry.<br>  <br>  Got to Round 20-something with 3 ppl with 3 rayguns. I had to leave, and they got overwhelmed. TEAMWORK!|`|8EEJJpK9aa	go to the glitch <br>  search youtube for it|`|dLsx3fKuaa	What I do is when you first spawn, pick up the Kar (that's the gun on the wall closest to you). With that, wait in the first room until two people have 2500 points and everyone else has at least 1500.<br>  <br>  Have one of the 2500 people open the couch on the stairs, and have everyone go up the stairs and into the room past that and have everyone go pick up a trench gun.<br>  <br>   Go back down to the first room and have the other person with 2500 points open the big door that says "HELP" on it. Spend the next few rounds here with two people guarding the door, and two people guarding the windows.<br>  <br>  This is important; don't have anyone open the couch on the stairs. <br>  <br>  Keep using this strategy, switching off positions if you see it necessary, and also having everyone pick up a random weapon in between rounds. Of course, a ray gun makes things loads easier.<br>  <br>  Me and my friends got to round 22 this way :)|`|cjaEHwEvaa	1 - When you first start, don't go for the cheapest rifle - a few hits from your pistol and you can go right in and buy the $600 M1 rifle which is far better.<br>  <br>  2 - don't open the "help" door till level 4<br>  <br>  3 - when you do, have everyone going to the mystery box - its the only way to get some of the best guns (like the amazing ray gun)<br>  <br>  4 - don't forget, you can swap to ur pistol before picking up a new gun, so you can carry two primary weapons. This helps when trying to get a good weapon from the mystery box. It ensures you wont be stuck with a sniper and a pistol.<br>  <br>  5 - don't open upstairs until level 10+ It gets far too messy if you do. Even then, i usually prefer to just open the help door. <br>  <br>  6 - A good technique for level 8 onward, is everyone in the mystery box room. One person on the door to the 1st room, 2 people on the windows and hole in the wall, and the last person roaming helping whoever needs it.
OAVuAkzsaa	for pictures press 'prt sc'<br>  then go into paint and press ctrl v - or paste|`|AA11578842	If you're on a 360 or PS3, you'll need a capture card.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.blackmagic-design.com/products/intensity/" rel="nofollow">http://www.blackmagic-design.com/product...</a><br>  That's a good one, but it costs around $250.<br>  <br>  Now, if you have Oblivion for your PC, you'll just need Fraps or Hypercam 2 for the video. Both can also take screenshots. Print Screen (should be located at the top left of your keyboard) is for pics, but it only holds one at a time. If you press PrntScrn and don't paste it into Paint and save, then you'll lose the pic when you press it again for another pic.<br>  Confusing, I know.<br>  <br>  If I actually do get the best answer, use my screen name.
QaRErUF9aa	Don't worry, you can always re-download it. <br>  <br>  Once you've re-installed Steam and logged in, click on the "My Games" tab, and all the games activated on your account will be listed. Simply right-click any of them and select "Install Game". That will re-download all the files necessary for you to play the game!<br>  <br>  It may take quite a long time to download the files again. If you know beforehand that your game data will be lost, you can create backup images of all your games. Click "File" then "Backup Games" and select all the games you want to back up and click "Next". Steam will ask you where to put the backup files and how much space they will take up. Choose a directory and click "Next". When Steam backs up your game files, you can have it automatically split the files up to make it easy to burn CD or DVD discs of your games. If you don't want any file splitting, then select "Custom" and type in a file size greater than your total backup file size. Now, Steam will back up your games, compressing them into however many pieces you selected, and the resulting files will be named according to what disc they should be burned onto.<br>  <br>  When you want to restore your game files, simply put in disc 1 and run the installation program located there and the installer takes care of the rest.|`|aowGfrgjaa	i played Counterstrike from 7th grade till now which is 11th. and reformatted my comp atleast 10 times<br>  <br>  www.steampowered.com download make an account. nd ur source will be on the account forever. even if u go to anotehr person's computer. itll stay. go buy it.

You could get 99 cooking within 3.5 mill, and probably attain it within a week or two of only doing that.

It may not be as fast as cooking, but it gets you most if not all of your money you spent on it back.

6N3yjlXhaa	Congratulations on the new machine.<br>  <br>  The number one problem we see is "there must be something wrong with the tension"!<br>  <br>  Number one thing to remember - always thread the machine with the presser foot up.

That's just like one I would have recommended to you for a starter machine: simple!  What you'll need to go with it is stuff like:<br>  thread -- black, white, and your favorite colors (get the cheap stuff, it works fine)<br>  scissors -- get a decent pair (about $5.-) and keep them only for fabric<br>  machine needles -- get two or three packs as they do break<br>  hand-sewing needles -- these are for touch-up and finishing work<br>  pins -- straight pins, get a pack<br>  tape measure<br>  any other notions (sewing accessories are called notions: pins, needles, etc) you remember using in high school that you think you need<br>  FABRIC!!! -- the dollar stuff works fine, but get several different types (knit, woven, etc) until you see what you need and what you like<br>  <br>  have fun!|`|nAi0El4Baa	I had a Brother years ago and had a lot of problems with the tension. I felt like I had to fight it every time I sewed.<br>  <br>  Last Christmas, my family got me a Singer Simple from Wal Mart. I love it. No problems at all. (Except for my sewing skills.)<br>  <br>  It is simple to thread, and has a built in needle threader. I haven't had one problem at all.<br>  <br>  I'm not knocking Brother, maybe the machine was a little advanced for me.

I believe it also came with a 48 hour XBL Gold account as well.|`|cO10thlnaa	It was on a card (similar to a Live subscription card) that was the same size as the instruction booklet.

cO10thlnaa	If you have GBA games that you still use, whether by playing them or perhaps just transferring Pokemon from the GBA games to your Diamond/Pearl, then getting a DSi wont be the best choice. Though, if you don't and would be willing to spend extra cash for a built in web browser, media player, the slightly bigger screen and the DSi shop then go for it. If you don't plan on using any of the other extras though, just stick with your DS Lite.|`|WchGezIAaa	Not at all<br>  the Regular Lite is cheaper and does everything the DSi does.<br>  All that camera stuff is just useless and the voice recording is the same<br>  Music playing only supports ACC files and the Sound quality from the DSi its self is appalling, even with headphones.<br>  <br>  Dont bother with it<br>  not at least until the price drops in a year or so.

In store ships to a store of your choice on a "general" date  BUT it could take up to a week for the store to get it and when they do it could be in any number of parcel boxes they recieve and how long it takes them to work the boxes in to the system.Best bet is ship it to your home.|`|9MIPAboSaa	It means you pick it up in store|`|6Mp3J79daa	it means u pick it up in the store

3S4ci6Traa	When you trade back in cash, you'll get 10% less the value of the traded in games.  Since these games are the default games for the 360, their value is already heavily diminished.  You're probably looking at like $10 for each, minus the 10%... so more like maybe $9.<br>  <br>  Also, if you have the Gamer's Edge card, you won't lose the 10% since it adds 10% to all trade-ins.  Also, Gamestop randomly offers trade-in specials for multiple titles.  Check with your local Gamestop to find out if they have any specials going on.  An example would be you get $10 extra if you trade in 4 games or something like that.|`|UVdRnx8Faa	around 50 thats what i got when i didnt want them because they came with my  360..so|`|7gq5a4rpaa	very low, gamestop always does that.  maybe $30 dollars?|`|Th6ncJGwaa	at least about 30 dollars maybe more

aSq7YLzEaa	Wrath of the lich king since it featured more things to do that Burning crusade, Burning crusade was mostly a upgrade, Lich king more of an expansion pack (which is better) ppl are definately playing Burning crusade.|`|RkPDhEuLaa	I may be mistaken, but I believe in order to play Wrath you have to already have Burning crusade. The original WoW lets you play until level 60, Burning crusade contains all the contents to allow you to play to level 70, and Wotlk lets you play until level 80 - so they are used consecutively. This means that you do not need to purchase all three right off the bat, but if you were going to purchase 2, you might as well purchase the first two (WoW and BC). After that, when you get 70, you can get Wotlk.|`|Ue5NoJOgaa	It doesn't work the way you are describing, each expansion is required to play the one beyond it, you must have The Burning Crusade in order to even load Wrath of the Lich King, but you can use The Burning Crusade without Wrath of the Lich King because it came prior.  And I don't know what the guy above me is talking about, they are both proper expansions with new continents and play.|`|r80jqZszaa	Yea im retty sure you need BC for WOTLK. But if you dont, iwould get burning crusades and then later on when you high enough to use the stuff in wotlk get that
UUDjzvkGaa	i think that you do the 10 day free trial for original wow, then you have to upgrade to BC. im not exactly sure. what you can do is go to worldofwarcraft.com and look for the details there, if you cant find the link, use the search in the top right hand side of the page.|`|c1NiSONXaa	there is but if you buy world of warcraft just the first one then buy bc and then wotlk but for the BC trial you need the cd key and you can only get that if you buy the game but if your allready a member of world of warcraft go to acount manager and theeres a torrent that you can download all three games
wyNvKrQmaa	You will not be able to save it to your hard drive (since you dont have one), if thats what you mean, but you will be able to save your game progress on campaign.|`|JMp6i3NIaa	yes you can....<br>  <br>  the save for halo 3 is like 4 mb plus if you wanna download the map packs for online thats another 6-8 mb. this is the most detailed i could give <br>  hopes this helps<br>  <br>  -Anonymous
j6MvCr6Naa	1. Halo Wars<br>  <br>  The average score for Halo Wars is 82% as can be seen here:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.metacritic.com/games/platform..." rel="nofollow">http://www.metacritic.com/games/platform...</a><br>  <br>  Halo Wars is still a good game though. If you're a big Halo fan like me you would be pleased be to see that the graphics, sound, and story are very much like the Halo trilogy. The cut scenes are very well done, the story is interesting and everything looks, moves and sounds like a Halo game except there is one big problem.<br>  <br>  The problem is the actual gameplay and gameplay is the most important part of a game. This is a strategy game and the problem is that to finish the game you don't need to use any starategy whatsoever. You can just blast through the entire game without putting any though into what you're doing which isn't a lot of fun, making the game very simple.<br>  <br>  So it's a pretty good game, but really not worth your money.<br>  <br>  2. Tom Clancy's H.A.W.X<br>  <br>  Here's the average reviews score for this game:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.metacritic.com/games/platforms/xbox360/tomclancyshawx?q=tom%20clancy's%20H.A.W.X" rel="nofollow">http://www.metacritic.com/games/platform...</a><br>  <br>  As you can see it's 75%, less than Halo Wars and not really a very good game. <br>  <br>  So, if you have to get one of the 2, Halo Wars would be the right choice.|`|UVdRnx8Faa	They are both bad games and got bad reviews but if i were to pick I would say Tom Clancys Hawx because Halo wars is stupid and basically just ruined the other halo games|`|SApZ3x5waa	HAWX is more likely the better game. The Tom Clancy brand normally puts out high quality games and this one is getting fairly positive reviews. Halo Wars, however, is getting reviews ranging from lukewarm to negative. I'd recommend HAWX.
FMM5qaW3aa	1940's steel pennies|`|41d4ea7f37805161606a19c751c1961caa	There is an old saying in the coin collecting hobby, "Buy the book before buying the coin." Your question is a perfect example of why this saying came to be. In order for you to enjoy the hobby and to protect yourself from spending more than you should you need to learn a little bit about the topic that interest you.<br>  <br>  A good place to start would be your public library which should have some reference books on world coins. You could check those for basic values and to get a feel for what is out there. The next step would be to find some books that focus on just the area you are interested in and maybe talk to some people who collect in the same areas that you do to get their opinions and ideas.<br>  <br>  Oh yea, don't forget to have some fun too.

hZm6tvhqaa	When you take a picture in the game using the in-game camera it saves it to the Storytelling folder, same place as your Downloads folder. It will be a .bmp file. You'll need something to convert it to .jpg or .gif to use it on a website. Photoshop, Paint Shop Pro, and The Gimp will all do it nicely. Those programs are way expensive, expensive, and free in that order.|`|LzrYiSEyaa	here. first you save the picture you want onto my documents. then you press browse on sims to get picture. <br>  <br>  Your Welcome!
j6MvCr6Naa	Yes, it most definitely is. There is a completely new story, new characters, you get to play as a new character too. You get to see a whole different side of what life is like in Liberty City. It will take you around 8-10 hours to complete which is more than most full games these days. There is also lots of new music and I heard that you even get a glimpse of Niko Bellic in the story, which is really awesome.<br>  <br>  If you're still not convinced, here's the average reviews score for Grand Theft Auto: The Lost and Damned:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.metacritic.com/games/platforms/xbox360/grandtheftauto4thelostandthedamned?q=grand%20theft%20auto:%20the%20lost%20and%20damned" rel="nofollow">http://www.metacritic.com/games/platform...</a><br>  <br>  As you can see it's 90% meaning this DLC is superb and well worth your money.|`|Pdex43zgaa	It's short.

In a members' world, you can find runite underneath the Heroes' Guild (where you charge your amulet of glories) and in an island unlocked by doing the quest Fremennik Isles.

dg2ktkCOaa	I thought it was OK. Allot better than I had anticipated. Big down side would have to be the loss of Blitzball, at least directly. The job system is an interesting idea which they had revived from one of the previous FF games. Maxing out all the abilities (job-suit) can be painful and not needed. But it is worth a play through as it does follow on from what happened in FFX. But don't forget that although it's a sequel it's not the same game.<br>  <br>  I would imagine that girls would tend to prefer this game as it does have a more dominant feminine side to it, (aside from the fact the three heroes are all girls). But it does have action, some fun mini games and enjoyable storyline.<br>  <br>  My advise would be if you've just finished FFX, Take a small break before you try it. The differences can be a bit unsettling at first and could scare off less serious gamers.|`|JPa0GzDjaa	FFX-2 is another sequel it's okay.... Try looking at the review below and make your mind up from that.|`|4TqhDN9Laa	no its crap

The next person takes the last letter of the previous word and makes a new word. (ex. apple ends with an "e", so the next word should start with an "e"...like elephant.)<br>  3. The next person, next person, etc continues in this pattern.<br>  <br>  What makes this game fun is to set restraints...for example:<br>  1. You can set categories like people names, movie titles, fruits, dogs, book characters, etc.  You can be creative ^^<br>  2. You can set the number of syllables. (ex. if you set it to be 3 or more syllables, you have to choose words like dic-tion-ar-y or  ba-na-na)<br>  <br>  The more complicated the game is, the more fun it gets~<br>  Try it! ^ ^|`|b033997f273bdfdbe4ff466e9e24277eaa	Do you mean games that you can play verbally, or something like video games for the DS?|`|DyywkXcZaa	if u have bb... then bubble popper, brick breaker, dope wars, pacman, or pokemons|`|WoRaXE73aa	Some kind of puzzles or something, something that will keep you from being bored...either buy a book or print  a few off the internet before you go.

Not just because he's an 8 yr old, but also because it offers a far superior selection of games, in all genres. Right now, I'd recommend any games from the Mario series, as well as the learning games and stuff like Puzzle Quest. These are all exciting games, while still being friendly to younger(and older) minds. As he gets older, there's plenty of more mature games, like Resident Evil, Dementium, and Touch the Dead and don't forget to look at the plethora of RPGs available. The DS has such a wide variety of games, its impossible that there will be nothing he likes. Get him a DS.|`|HvbIE03saa	I think that for a kid that young then the DS is your best bet.<br>  <br>  It and it's games are more inexpensive, there are more kid friendly games, and it's something that he can grow into.

It's; reminiscent of the Game Boy and Game Boy Advance, except that it has a rechargeable battery that lasts for a really long time. It also has a touch screen and microphone, so it's interactive. You can buy games where you can raise your own pet, teach it voice commands, pet it on the touch screen, etc. <br>  <br>  I strongly recommend the nintendo DS.|`|QVOsQNaRaa	PSP it has internet, a video game player, has a phone (3000 series), radio, MP3 player, can be a camera and a photo and slideshow viewer, Multiplayer, plus it has Parental controls so u can filter out games rated M or A.<br>  <br>  DS only has the ability to play games (it does have internet and MP3 player expansions) but that would cost 20$ more than an PSP and it still would have MANY missing features.|`|k1YsporDaa	Is your child "clumsy"?

EVjoCpjEaa	Gotz can't demolish your basements. You'll have to wait for the storm to destroy it.<br>  <br>  It's always a good idea to build everything out of stone (if not gold, eventually).
j6MvCr6Naa	If you mean the one that's on the top of the Hill, then you need to get up there, in the centre of the top of the hill you will find like an underground entrance to the Bunker. You will need to use explosives to breach the door and then kill all the Nazis inside. But before you get there you have to take out Mortar spots and Half-Tracks from what I remember. Good Luck and have fun.
KoZYhGewaa	You could get a easy job to show that you would pay for it yourself and you can look after yourself|`|XIFLOYVuaa	when they are in a good mood, make a deal with them that you wont play it for more than an hour a day and prove that you'll be committed to this deal.|`|SApZ3x5waa	The addiction thing is a farce. That wears off after the first week. Maybe sooner, depending on your attention span. If you plan to play on the Blizzard servers, pay for it yourself. If you plan to play on a private server that problem disappears entirely. And just try showing your parents that you're more mature in general. Turn the lights out when you're done, pay closer attention to more adult things(not referring to porn), help them with things you wouldn't normally do, etc. Once they see you're growing up they'll give you more freedom to self govern, and allow you to do whatever you want.|`|kPkSEZb1aa	You should talk to them I spend 14 hours a day on the internet at least on my days off and a good 10 when I am working though the week.<br>  <br>  Just make sure you do everything you need to get done before playing that way your parents will not have a problem with it.<br>  <br>  Try telling them its how you whined down at the end of the day and relax.|`|nvHAjQzkaa	tell them you'll always finish your homework before you play it...<br>  <br>  & does it cost money?  you should also pay for it yourself if it does.<br>  <br>  If I was your mom, that's what you'd have to do to convince me.|`|qOBinxDsaa	You cant play WoW without getting obsessed =/ its just like gambling and stuff its a strong addiction try getting wc III the frozen throne its fun and its not WoW so maybe you could buy it|`|NjeGeq6jaa	I have the same problem. the trick is to make a powerpoint about it pointing out all the good things about put only 0.001 % of all the wow players are addicted
nyyjJiH4aa	Try breaking vases or rocks around your area. Bombs and other supplies are sometimes hidden in these.<br>  <br>  If all else fails, there are also shops where you can buy bombs. They look kind of like a tepee or something.<br>  <br>  If that's not clear, or you need help with someething else, feel free to email me through the link on my profile.
C8DOT8Y7aa	Sorry I don't know that game<br>  and try YouTube it or goggling it.
Tc6PWlyKaa	Pirates in an ok game, but it's kind of old.<br>  <br>  Stronghold is great, and it doesn't even need the disc to play
P43G2phnaa	Messhina valley is the fall dungeon area. When you reach the shooting star path take a left and you will reach Messhina valley. (Shooting star path is at the very top of the map and is the area that splits into: Padova MT (Top), Trieste forest (Right), Messhina valley (Left).<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!
vH2OF9z8aa	try this card,<br>  <br>  The card on the right represents manifestation - the real work involved in completing the project, and the form it will take upon culmination. This is the painting or touch of the undertaking. The Emperor: Influence of society, law. Resurgence of energy. Sexual potency. Arrogance. Insensitivity. Energy and desire.|`|nmz4EHkmaa	NOOOO!!!!!!! yu gi oh. will kill u it took up 5 years of my life it was a addiction.QUIT WHILE YOU STILL HAVE THE CHANCE!!!:O|`|d2X4wwiyaa	It looks almost like you took a handful of cards and called it a deck.  It just has little to no organization.  You are also missing several staples.  I recommend getting the staples and then choosing a theme to work with.  Sorry hope this helps
nZynoCVKaa	hey!  the same problem happened with me. it was really frustrating!  I cleaned out my entire computer and got rid of everything I didn't need.  You probably know the Sims is a HUGE game and takes up a ton of space. So, it's going to take up a ton of your computer, CD memory.  So I'm thinking your best bet is to clean everything up and try again.  If that doesn't work, your could probably call a computer expert or go to best buy or maybe even Wal-mart.  you could also try to buy extra memory cards that add space and virtual memory on your computer.  you can get those at all the stores that sell computers.<br>  <br>  hope this helps because it's a really fun game when it works!|`|kVB9apYfaa	there's probably a small but deep scratch on your game and if its still fresh than theres probably a lens read error but you can always do the easy thing and re-install the game

fr180hSmaa	Go to the map on the save portals. See the red face those are the enemys. Simply go to those places and fight them if there is not place there right now then go around that area there should be a opening. When done go to the middle and go to the trophy case place there you be a empty hole if you beat it. Simply press up like a door and enter.|`|AoxkInedaa	its easy i beat it just keep going to doors with black swirls around it and face ppl when u get to a door that has a purple arrow next to it go in it and it'll have little trophies of ppl those are the people u still have to face, repeat the first process of going around and killing people then go back to the door with the purple arrow go i n and there should be no more trophies, so then stand in the middle of the walkway and press the up toggle on your nunchuk itll then bring u through a door and youll face an extremely hard boss|`|S8AXB3JRaa	defeat all the shadow characters then go through the big door to fight taboo.|`|kAIXDVu1aa	fight dude.. answer mine plz : <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AqdxRBR9L3q7ZUedxjBGfxrsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090227133130AAPFQAa">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>

YDkSovgcaa	in a way, although there are different gangs to defeat which involves doing missions to do this. The game is great at first but you do lose interest quite quickly.|`|PQGOFVSSaa	Charlie D is wrong. It is better in all ways than GTA4. Although it quickly loses it's charm, it is still one of my favourite games.|`|CzyIvHqoaa	Yeah, it's just like GTA San Andreas. You can drive cars and get all mods for them, fly planes and helicopters, boats and even quad bikes.|`|USFXA2juaa	yes, a slightly poorer(content wise) game than grand theft auto|`|gnSnpAiCaa	yes|`|mbwKFacIaa	yea . its like gta|`|PLS1CAEHaa	Yes, its a free Roaming game, just like GTA 4|`|hlXEAAm7aa	ya man
cO10thlnaa	Alot of stores don't accept the trade-in of N64 games anymore. Even if they did, probably the most you would get for them is about $5 which will obviously depend on the game.|`|xbjsASRTaa	a memory card will be worth only 2 bucks.a game will be worth any were from 25 cents to 1.00$.
KQLoDBBpaa	Definitely! I own fallout 3 and am still playing it. It is very deep, and the "VATS" system can be extremely addictive. The game is very fun...|`|JLk4DsFfaa	Yes! Fallout 3 is one of the Greatest Games of 2008. Its gameplay is amazing, and its storyline is exellent. They are even making downloadable mission campaigns adding to the one they have allready made!|`|l3QPE8ySaa	no i honestly think its not fair because fallout isnt really all dat if u ask me i did ur same trade but backwords|`|S0H0ue6faa	o yea i've played both games and fallout 3 is way better<br>  so yea do the trade|`|weMxzwXXaa	yes

YQMCVuFiaa	It's nothing you did wrong, so you can feel better about that, but the game itself is so riddled with problems and errors that this does happen; quite frequently. Installing it to your hard drive does solve a lot of issues, especially the freezing, but it does not solve everything and you may even experience the occasional freeze.<br>  <br>  So, install it to your hard drive, and cross your fingers while playing.<br>  <br>  1. XBox 360 Dashboard<br>  2. My XBox<br>  3. Highlight 'Play Fable 2'<br>  4. Press Y<br>  5. Install to Hard Drive|`|cUP8PmRIaa	Download the game to hard drive it should work fine after that.

ijvdBze4aa	Officially theres no way. Unofficially there's X-link Kai.<br>  <br>  The better way is to wait for the new MHF Unite.

pflYF0Khaa	Rockstar have announced there will be at least one more exclusive DLC for Xbox 360. I have also heard that there will be a third DLC which will be multiplatform (haven't been able to confirm this from a trustable source).|`|wPnJekdqaa	Yes. Rockstar said they had two DLC packs planned for GTA4.|`|j6MvCr6Naa	Yes, of course, Rockstar signed a 50 million $ contract with Microsoft for 2 pieces of exclusive DLC. The Lost and Damned was the first and the second has a current release date of October 31 2009. Unless there are delays of course.|`|AA12091477	There will be at least one more for the xbox 360. Rumor has it that the PS3 will also be getting some exclusive DLC. Nothing is confirmed on that yet. But that's the rumor.|`|CccvQB8kaa	There will be another episode, it's slated for late 2009 or early 2010 pending no delays.
4wNWz3Ykaa	Seeing as they said that it was episode 1 out of 3 ..yes Im quite sure there will be another one.|`|msMDvcbQaa	Well there's most likly an idea for the prject but if funding falls out theres none. I'm think though because of the achevment impossible trinity during the daimond mission in the mueseum I'm thinking the guy that shoots at you through the window outside is going to be the main character in the next download/episode/w/e|`|CAmiNku2aa	You cant really tell right now but I tell you if the game doesnt get good reviews there wont be another.
8pIGQdybaa	This is a thread from Science Toys with instructions on a good hot air balloon design and how to do it. You can also look around and do a search in their discussion boards; a lot of people ask science fair and project related questions there:<br>  <a href="http://scitoys.com/board/messages/1/3122.html?1164340668" rel="nofollow">http://scitoys.com/board/messages/1/3122...</a><br>  <br>  Here's another, very detailed one from a homeschooler in Washington: <a href="http://www.selah.k12.wa.us/SOAR/SciProj2000/HeatherK.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.selah.k12.wa.us/SOAR/SciProj2...</a><br>  <br>  And this is a very basic, simple one with limited materials:<br>  <a href="http://www.lessonplanspage.com/ScienceExHotAirBalloonFloatsWhyMO68.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.lessonplanspage.com/ScienceEx...</a>
j6MvCr6Naa	The Weapon you're using is very good, I used a Master Turret Rifle to get the Red Dragon. Anyway, here are a few tips:<br>   <br>  Always go for the Headshot as you get 3 points instead of 1 point if you hit the body of the target.<br>                                 <br>  Learn where the targets you need to shoot appear and devise a strategy as to which ones you will be focusing on each round.<br>  <br>  And lastly, practice makes perfect. On my first try I got only 14 points failing the first round. On my second try I got more than 140 points. So just keep trying until you get it.|`|43RPjLZlaa	like little moth said. but sometimes the targets keep poping up in the same place sometimes like 5-6 times. it's hard for me also. the highest i got was 152.
QriWp4fzaa	cod4 is the best. get it its worth it. there r some hackers for pc mainly, but there are also lots of ways 2 cheat and do easy lvlin. which i find pointless. juss pla game normally. dont hack and make pass hard. u shuld go 2 utube and type in cod4 for pc matches. c if in the vid the person has 2 wait long time wen in a fitin lobby. if he doesnt, then there r ppl.|`|o6bl7Nkwaa	Whenever I go on, there's usually a reasonable amount online. In my opinion there is no point in buying CoD4, just buy CoD:World at War. That's where all the crowd is, haven't seen a hacker on it either. <br>  <br>  Hope I helped :)<br>  Sarla|`|Y9lSiRhGaa	Yes Call of Duty 4 has hackers<br>  but mainly on the PC <br>  most of the main glitches are in old school mode as you can jump higher than normal|`|8lRRigDtaa	i do gamer tag : SPAZAMATTACK|`|weMxzwXXaa	if you have a xbox 360 then there are more than plenty of people to play online|`|7uJaCXMHaa	yes, i hadent playedit for a while but just did last week
j6MvCr6Naa	1. Far Cry 2<br>  This game has an amazing open world to explore in Africa, this game has absolutely amazing graphics and you can approach missions in any way you choose. You can be silent or just blow everything up, your choice, it's also superbly animated so you really feel like you're in the game. It's also a long game and could take you up to 50 hours to do everything in it, so it will definitely keep you busy. It also has an awesome Map Creator for you to mess around in.<br>  <br>  Here's the average reviews score for this game:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.metacritic.com/games/platforms/xbox360/farcry2?q=far%20cry%202" rel="nofollow">http://www.metacritic.com/games/platform...</a><br>  <br>  As you can see it's 85% meaning it's a very good game.<br>  <br>  2. Battlefield: Bad Company<br>  This game has a pretty short camaign, the enemies are also pretty dumb and the characters are rather annoying. The graphics look very dated in my opinion, the only thing that saves it are the destructible environments which aren't fully destructible to be honest. It's a pretty good illusion though. The online play is also fun, the destructible environments add a lot to the gameplay because you can play more tactically, but still no where near as good as something like Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare online.<br>  <br>  Here's the average reviews score for this game:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.metacritic.com/games/platforms/xbox360/battlefieldbadcompany?q=battlefield:%20bad%20company" rel="nofollow">http://www.metacritic.com/games/platform...</a><br>  <br>  As you can see it's 83% meaning this is a pretty good game but not as good as Far Cry 2.<br>  <br>  So, in conclusion, Far Cry 2 is well worth your money compared to Battlefield: Bad Company and I think it's very inferior to Far Cry 2.|`|Mxe36NZEaa	I guess both of them are ok games, but there are better games out there for the 360.<br>  <br>  I suggest:<br>  Gears of War 2<br>  Dead Space<br>  Fable 2<br>  Fallout 3<br>  Guitar hero world tour<br>  left 4 dead<br>  midnight club Los Angeles<br>  NHL 09<br>  Rock band 2<br>  Skate 2<br>  <br>  all of those are really good games you would enjoy|`|jXAbTovcaa	Battlefield but i for Xbox game i think fallout 3 is the best|`|UVdRnx8Faa	Neither Left4dead|`|eMSP740Taa	I say treat yourself to BOTH!! =]|`|tNfw9U8taa	none of those ROCK BAND!|`|e5s7RAB0aa	You Should get Farcry 2 its way better than battlefield and it was worth every penny.|`|T6lsavRvaa	Battlefield is awsome stuff the other 3 coz online is better too lool best answer plz!|`|AnOprWhxaa	I think call of duty waw or halo 3 is better|`|kPkSEZb1aa	Battlefield<br>  <br>  Its got really good online play.|`|kLK2peV1aa	far cry|`|vVsvioe0aa	far cry 2 is hot

cO10thlnaa	Special Regigigas obtainable at Toys R Us from the 8th through the day before Platinum's release. It was announced on Nintendo's official pokemon site.<br>  This Regigigas is special in the way that it allows you to find and capture the three elemental Regis (Regirock, Registeel, Regice) in Platinum. The normal Regigigas in-game and any other Regigigas will not allow you to do so.

F08qx2hgaa	In the other Animal Crossing games, these are the two past ways to catch a bee.<br>  <br>  1.) In one game, there are honey bees that buzz around., which can be caught flying around aimlessly in the right seasons.<br>  <br>  2.) You have to get lucky. It's one of the hardest bugs to catch, just like a Tarantula. Right when the nest falls, get that net out! As soon as the game allows you to do so. Then, you must take a chance and unpause your game from the menu screen to go at it.|`|rxNnj5MQaa	Okay first, get a net.<br>  Press the right button (or left) at the top off the Wiimote till you get the net, then once you have it, put it away and start shaking trees...<br>  <br>  Once a bee's nest comes RUN FOR IT<br>  and press the RIGHT botton at the top of the wiimote so the net comes out, and catch it

Well with how they have the mathematics, your number always turns out to be a multiple of some number. Then when you go to the category to pick your symbol or gift, ones with the games "special" multiple number, will all be the same. <br>  <br>  I hope I explained this where it makes since.

yzpU5fZJaa	this is confusing. what was the point of activating dust tornado? all spells and traps are being destroyed anyways. dust tornado does not negate so heavy storm still destroys everything anyways. negating is when a card makes another cards effect not happen. dust tornado and mystical space do no do this. so you play heavy. then your friend activates dust tornado which does notheing. then you chain by negating dust tornado which is doing nothing then your friend activates mst which also does nothing becuase A: it dosent egate and B: it has spell speed of 2 and seven tools is spell speed 3 which means mst cannot stop seven tools. youe heavy storm still works destroying all spells and traps. i hope this helps :-)|`|nyVeR2EOaa	You're right.  You have to negate the effect of heavy storm to stop it and plus you can't chain mystical space typhoon to seven tools of bandit because seven tools of bandit is a counter trap and mystical space typhoon is a quick-play.|`|6Wmd7HWNaa	your friends right when he activates mystical space typhoon then he did destroy your tools of the bandit allowing him to destroy your heavy storm|`|TOilCuG3aa	heavy storm wins<br>  <br>  dust tornado destroys but doesnt NEGATE heavy storm<br>  <br>  magic jammer destroys AND NEGATES heavy storm

QaRErUF9aa	Your computer seems to be mid-range, which should be acceptable for running Assassin's Creed.<br>  <br>  Left4Dead, along with most other Valve-created games, doesn't require much for computer power. However, Oblivion takes quite a bit of horsepower to run at high resolutions. If you can run that just fine, Assassin's Creed should be ok.
K6F44P7gaa	Since you said you installed it once, if you registered it the first time you played, EA may have your original code stored online. Go to your EA account and have a look around. Also contact EA and let them know what happened. If you cannot find your code, EA may give it to you. They keep that info. Good luck.

Apparently the economic system in that one is pretty involved.<br>  <br>  Perfect World Online is also highly amusing (free too). The quests get repetative after a while though and if u ever get high lvl, you better enjoy doing nothing but grinding.|`|5frOVAgSaa	guild wars!! it has a decent number of players as well. u just have to buy a code once and then u dont have to pay anything.|`|IAgYpkQHaa	I play EVE online<br>  its pretty cool, i like it lol. its a scifi mmorpg. i think its about $14 a month but im not sure about that.|`|XhfRBRlUaa	Flyff  it is a game by gpotato, its general idea is u start off as a vagrant and it is fairly easy to level at early levels. when you get to lvl 15 wich u can do easily in 2 days or 1 if u play alot. u get a job either acrobat, assist, mercenrie, or magician. mercenries use fast and fairly moderate attack power. you can choose a build of ur own as u build up. either fast attacks or very strong or alot of sta. with every job u can find the pretty basic build that is good for that class. once you get to level 15 you will level on with ur mercenrie and get mto level 60 were u pick betweeen a blade or a knight. once more each with diffrent specialieis/. the acrobats all use bows and yoyos to attack at level 60 you pick from a ranger or a jester. mages use staffs and wands and they go to phyceepers and elementors.  assists u can pick to either be a fighting assist or a healer, assists all get heal and special spells called buffs giving extra power. u can only cast buffs with sticks and u should attack with knuckle. at level 60 if u have chosen to be a fighter most people become billposters if u are a healer u go ringmaster. a assist gets there aoe attack at lvl 28. that is were u can kill more then one monster at a time. most of the jobs at lvl 60  with any class have aoes. there is a monster for every level. a small a normal and a captain. there is also the giant that is way powerfuller then any other creature. every monster has a giant. I played this game for about 1 year and 4 months and i have a level 65 blade and 75 ringmaster. with neach account u have 3 character slots.  i have a few new chars that arent very strong. mostlt people are nice in the game. what u do is dowbload it from the website. the game is totally free to play and u have fun but there are extras u can buy things called gpotatoes. theese u can buy extra kl outfits or pets or kl scrolls to help ur character fight/. the biggest monster is the clockworks but u need to be totaly pro to get that far. u can duel other players as long as they have a job and are at least in ur level gap for 30 level dif. there is a big areana were u can kill anyone with out them having to accepet to fight too. the controls are pretty simple u move with w a s and d keys and u attack by cliking a monster twice.  hope u give it a try|`|SKYSUHZtaa	alright first off. ive played a bit of games. runescape  i used to play. in order to not be bored within a month i had to pay 5-6 bucks a month to play supporter(i think they increased it). guild wars ive played way too little to give you good information. but it was ok. i got bored with it since i play wow. whats wrong with WoW anyway? silkroad ive never played.|`|8XEIMuBqaa	AQWorlds.com and RuneScape.com kept me entertained for a while.

cxcDP97qaa	HDTV is considered anything above 720p so yes, component cables will help.  Be sure to set the male plug that is going into your Xbox to HDTV (there's a little switch).  Then once you have the components hooked up to your TV, load the 360, go to your Console Settings and change your HDTV settings to either 720p or 1080i (I'm only assuming you have those options, but if you only have 1 or the other, pick whichever one you can).|`|26c3882c8862fb989b196c0d5e86733aaa	It will always be better to use component colours (R,G,B, or Cr,Cb, Y) than the single conductor cable. Using these components avoids use of colour encoding systems (PAL, Sécam, NTSC) which necessarily placed limitations on the colour definition, so that they would be compatible with, and fit the bandwidth of the original black and white TV transmissions.|`|mMALLOpxaa	Yes, it will be better. Don't expect a huge difference, but the colours will be brighter and the graphics will be slightly sharper. If it is a large tv you will notice a bigger difference in the graphics.<br>  <br>  Hope that helped.  =]

There is a camera built in, so you don't have to carry one around as well (unless you're one of those psycho perfect picture types, but most people take even crappier pictures on their phones).

As for the others, I would work on getting better moves that are better suited for their type and stats. Also, I think you should have a fire-type, especially since you are already doubling up on types (you have two-half steel and two half-fighting.)|`|WKZoHZ73aa	its ok, they all seem a bit novice though. I'd thing pokemon like charizard, Gyrados etc. would be more powerful.
j6MvCr6Naa	There's really no practical use for it. But it does make you look cool and and it's really just there so you can have your own unique look online. I usually go all black because it looks so damn cool and I guess it's harder for people to notice you online when you're all black.

j6MvCr6Naa	Well, you can't just download a game for free like that, and if there are websites that let you, it's illegal and you would be stealing from the good hard-working people that slaved away to make the game.

Good Luck. =)|`|rm2kykQEaa	Either save up your own money and buy one<br>  or... just sit down with your parents and say please, and ask them why they dont want you to get one.<br>  <br>  Or.. wait for easter of christmas, i wanted a laptop for ages, and i finally got one for Christmas :)|`|5tqLYO2Laa	ya i know how it is and like the rest of the people i think you should try to get the money yourself!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! but i know how it is!!!!!!!!!!!!! if you need help e-mail me or ask for a friend request!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|HbnhpnL8aa	A real guy would work and buy it.<br>  <br>  But, if you want to persuade them, do something they will feel proud of.

2Q2ltt1Saa	It's the whole masculinity thing.  It's just another place that some guys don't' want girls to be, because they're inferior if beaten by a girl.  If the girls don't play, they don't get beaten.<br>  <br>  This usually shows up in testosterone-ridden minefields like FPS games and fighting games.  They'll whine about any losses, but get some extra salt in the wound if it's a girl.<br>  <br>  I, OTOH, love to see these types of guys being handed themselves on a platter by a girl.  Keeps the ego/testosterone in check, which needs to happen a lot more than it does.  Gamers are no longer teenage boys hiding in a basement somewhere, and they need to learn it, along with a nice dose of humility.  (Doubly so if they break something and have to pay to replace it... that's just idiotic.)|`|Kqpqt69Vaa	i don't know why but most boys or men's egos wont allow them to loose to a girl or women,they cant stand it.there to competitive and to macho,my self i think there idiots but that is just my opinion.i think its great when a girl or women can sit there and kick butt on a bunch of guys and they get all pissy like a bunch of baby's.hope this helps.|`|gUg1tjfcaa	Because they don't think that girls can be better than them in such a thing such as video games, i guess to them its a huge guy thing. But I'm personally ok with girls playing video games and beating me.|`|nbuQ8OUsaa	basically it's very simple; guys hate losing to girls. gaming was specifically a man's thing and girls never touched it. it's like a really experienced player whos gamed for about 10 years loses to somebody who's only gamed for a week. some guys takes it badly like your friend but i personally like girls who are competitive. it shows that not only men play games but women do too and it's not something you see very often. i have a lady friend who is obsessed with gaming and beats me almost all the time in mario kart ds. i get abit angry but i treat her like i treat any other male gamer. she doesn't play just to look cool for boys; she plays because she wants to have fun and likes to win. so yeah, just carry on with it. those guys can't deal with losing at all.|`|W0QFC0g4aa	in my opinion. its more fun when girls play. but really, its most mens nature to be competative and alot of men (ive come to find) that play videogames are mildly sexest and believe the stareotype that girls should be into more femanine things. thats good that you dont get too bent out of shape about it tho. i find it kinda entertaining when i see/hear guys flipping about getting beat by a girl. and really, that should make you feel awesome, lol.|`|SHt7VZjpaa	Its because a lot of guys do things video games are a guys thing and then you have some guys who just get WAY into video games and hate loosing. I think its hot when girls can game and win. Personally I have never been whooped by a chick. I am still trying to teach my girlfriend how to use both analog sticks for call of duty 4.|`|XD7s1VBkaa	to me it seems like girls in online video are always taking control of things and are always acting smart to guys.  I have been playing online games for years and whenever (99% of the time) i see a girl in game it seems like they take the game too seriously, trying to be the best and not having fun.  that's my personal opinion|`|qbmkMWqeaa	I remember playing Kingpin multiplayer...two guys decided they wanted to teach me a lesson.  The only lesson that was learned was to not underesitmate anyone. They were using chat and I remember "hearing" them asking where I was, totally confused and lost and beaten.<br>  <br>  Playing a Sniper in Rogue Spear often got me a lot of flack from others. Despite Sniper being a part of the game, most players came from the lame doom/quake run and gun mindset. They hated the fact that I could find parterns in their movement and snipe them. Most FPS players are predictable...<br>  <br>  <br>  Men in general are taught to be competitive...sports, jobs, etc. And very often they are taught that women can't do the same things as them.|`|5c46dcbb7205da275e2dc4490158184aaa	I love when girls play video games! <br>  I think it's a total turn-on. :D.<br>  <br>  Some guys don't like it because they think of it as a place where they can go to get AWAY from girls, and their girlfriends. <br>  Some guys love it. <br>  Some guys hate it. <br>  I'm a lover. <br>  Hope I helped!
Z2EzfQFvaa	Don't even bother getting to know these new Pokemon games and new Pokemon..they suck BIG time.Gold/Silver/Crystal are the best in the series..so just keep playing those.Do not buy the new diamond/pearl/platinum because you'll be wasting your money if you do..trust me.Stick with Gold and Silver and you'll be happy.|`|2WX3nhfjaa	Yeah, the first person speaks the truth. G,S&C are the best and so is the Johto region(even the song for it in the cartoon), plus you get to go back to Kanto. But I would recommend buying Platinum when its released. I have Pearl and Diamond(I have yet to finish Diamond, I don't even play it that much), and I don't think you'll dissapointed with the new game in the series. Maybe you should buy Coloseum or Gale of Darkness?<br>  <br>  Advice: The 3rd gym leader in D&P is stronger than the 8th! With her Lucario, but you can skip her though, unless you want fly early.(I skipped her and went to Wayne and with Brine I was able to beat Lucario with Gastrodon, my fave).
6t2EdSjOaa	Sands of Time is possibly the best one of them all. Everyone I know thats played the games said it was their favorite, personally I liked T2T best but it was close between the two. It isn't as combat oriented as WW , which a lot of people didn't like in WW, the puzzles are much better in SoT than the other two, and for the price you can buy it for now I think you should have bought it already.

As a rule however, gas and nitro radio controlled boats tend to be faster.|`|pChVHbLGaa	actually it depends on how much you want to spend and what day of the week it is.  electric and gas boats are both pushing 200 mph now.  just do a search for fast rc boat on youtube and see for your self.  in my opinion it is easier to go faster with the electric boats but everyday the  two types over take each other as fastest.  for a laugh do a search for brushless, Mini Mono Gecko on youtube for a micro electric so fast it has a hard time staying in the water.|`|JfIV7tifaa	Hey there, <br>  <br>  Typically, gas (or nitro) radio controlled boats will be faster. Electric radio controlled boats go anywhere from 15 mph up to around 25 mph for the fastest. Nitro boats can beat that by about 10 mph..reaching speeds of 35 mph or so.<br>  <br>  The brushless electric motors are faster than the brushed motors, and are reaching speeds that match some of the nitros. Keep in mind..the brushless are more expensive initially, but there is less upkeep and maintenance since you don't have to replace the brushes. These boats run cooler as well...which helps in their performance!<br>  <br>  <br>  Hope that answers your question!<br>  <br>  BTW, I checked out the YouTube videos on ' fast rc boats.'..the fastest I saw was about 60 mph ..which is a total extreme speed...not what you will find in a hobby  rc boat. The 200 mph claim is insane!! Don't expect it, and don't be disappointed in a 'slower' speed..who could ever see a boat going 200 mph anyway...and control it? Good luck there!!
8kUCUjO1aa	RTR means that the boat should not need any technical knowledge to set up and run.  Theoretically is should be operable right out of the box.  In reality you generally need to adjust some things such as the servos and grease the drive shafts.<br>  <br>  Many of the electric boats are truly ready to run out of the box.  Most of the nitro and gas boats should get some break in time and preliminary maintenance.|`|JfIV7tifaa	Hey there...RTR means 'ready to run'. In other words, you don't have to assemble it, or build the boat. You just take it out of the box, insert the batteries if electric, or fuel if nitro, and you're good to go! <br>  <br>  Not being very 'mechanical' myself, I find RTR boats the best for me.<br>  <br>  Hope that answers your question!<br>  Cheers,<br>  Lynn|`|Bio3344Waa	Normally = Ready To Run although one manufacturer is saying it means Ready to Race.<br>  <br>  Be careful here tho' you have to read descriptions carefully to check if RTR means you have everything in that one box (and price) to put it in the water and go!<br>  <br>  An electric  "RTR" boat very often will need one or two 7.2V batteries,  the radio transmitter will need 8 to 12 AA batteries (plus a charger is a good idea to keep you running!)<br>  <br>  A Nitro boat will often need a completer kit...wrench, bottle, plug, fuel etc.<br>  <br>  A gas boat will need gasoline, 2 stroke engine oil, and 8-12 AA's<br>  Gas boats.<br>  <br>  So step carefully grasshoppah!
0Fc7Zos7aa	idk how but i know some keepitmeezy09,LUCYLOVESYOU09, hope i helped|`|OwRuiWnXaa	On the Meez news-letter and i think you get that on email idk about that part now :P
wGEYqauWaa	Gibson ES-335 is the oldest and best of that type.  Pretty much everything else is a knockoff of that. Gretsch makes a bunch of nice ones as well.

I especially liked the rare, and holographic cards. I threw all of mine away but if i were you i would sell them on ebay. But i would sell them in a pack of 50 not a whole collection like 874. Good Luck
6N3yjlXhaa	You have a computer and are hooked up the the Internet now.<br>  <br>  All you need is an email address.  Don't you have one with Yahoo?<br>  <br>  Find a site by typing in online quilt catalog.  Read the information, they should have a method of getting there catalogs.<br>  <br>  Try Connecting Threads, Hancocks of Paducah and Equilter.<br>  <br>  I know for certain Connecting Threads and Hancocks of Paducah have catalogs.<br>  <br>  <a href="https://www.connectingthreads.com/cart/login.asp?req=CATALOG" rel="nofollow">https://www.connectingthreads.com/cart/l...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="https://www.hancocks-paducah.com/Catalog.aspx" rel="nofollow">https://www.hancocks-paducah.com/Catalog...</a>|`|4JuwXJrEaa	You might want to e-mail this website to see if they have a printed version of their catalog that could be sent to your mother, or maybe you could print it up for her?<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.clotilde.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.clotilde.com/</a>|`|lvdOnlJTaa	Lots of online companies don't mind sending catalogues via letter. just email few of them.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://loans4money.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://loans4money.blogspot.com/</a>|`|AA11120109	Go to the book store or library and look in the reference section of the quilting books there are listed resources with addresses.  Plus, Joanns, Michael's, AC Moore are great resources.
jK1JfOehaa	Brawl codes are codes you can exchange with your friends so you can play with them online.  Yes, it's very useful if you have friends that have Brawl and they live far away.  I play a lot with my friends.  Yes, I recommend it.|`|71oENb44aa	when i logged in it said my friend code and you can change the name if you want...al you have to do is set up your  wi-fi on the wii menu.....you just register your friends codes and brawl...thats all you can pretty much do other than the multiman brwal...its ok if you bored because it gets boring after a while
FBbVsTbZaa	Yes, just got back from their yesterday also known as Tunica Ms, their are about eight casinos there and most of them are spaced pretty far apart
BuP60uAtaa	Most states have a non-drivers ID available at the Department of Motor Vehicles.  You may need your parent to go with you and birth certificate. Go online to your state's office and check the requirements.
2Q2ltt1Saa	It varies based on what disc you installed (which release was on the disc) .  The latest release is 3.0.8 .  There's about 5-6 patches per 'version' (going from the last 2.x patch to 3.0.2 is huge, then 3.0.4, 3.0.6, then 2 small 3.0.8 patches).<br>  <br>  You're downloading from other people so the time will vary based on when you're downloading, who's playing, etc.<br>  <br>  If friends have been playing for a long time, they'll have the old patches stored on their computer.  It's in the public folder, under Blizzard Entertainment.  The friend can burn these patches to a disc and you can put them in the patch directory to avoid having to download them.   Also, if someone has a Wrath of the Lich King CD, this will have the 3.0.2 patch on it and you won't have to download anywhere near as much stuff.<br>  <br>  And (mostly to other poster), the CD just installs the client, which is the same client you use in both full and trial games.  The access is controlled by the game, so when you're flagged as trial, you'll only be able to see/do whatever the trial limits.|`|SApZ3x5waa	Uh, you're not using the trial, you're installing the full game. To get the trial, you just need to go on the Blizzard website, create an account and they'll stream you the client for the trial duration. Also, your friend has loaned you either WoW, without expansions, or only up to Burning Crusade, as it is now trying to update to the Lich King patches.
TiN0pZjOaa	do you have the pc/mac version, or the pc/windows version?
972OdSIJaa	dont think you can unless you make a new account.<br>  <br>  no point making a sub account really.
9ArFYAFeaa	u have to be in your room so u could invite over some1 over. hope i helped!
37c233fdcf66a7d0f3a3f1d9528d7a4caa	Not bad...though you have a glaring weakness to Electric. Some changes though:<br>  <br>  Torterra: Stone Edge and Swords Dance/Rock Polish over BIte and Curse (Curse does boost Attack and Defense though).<br>  <br>  Luxray: Kinda hard to decide, since nature will decide what to teach it. However, given that you only have physical moves, consder Return and Ice Fang over Charge and Iron Tail (actually, Iron Tail can stay to whack Rock Types).<br>  <br>  Mothim: take it out. Out of the three that you have that are weak to electric, he's the weakest.<br>  <br>  Staraptor: Drop Aerial Ace, Pluck, and Fly for Endeavor, Quick Attack, and Brave Bird.<br>  <br>  Gyarados: Dragon Dance is a must. Stone Edge isn't really needed on this thing when you have Ice Fang. Consider Waterfall over Aqua Tail too.|`|Gq1mnN2Kaa	go to the pokemon event march 8th-21st and get a free regigigas level 100 and add it to you team, then trade your Regigigas to platinum to unlock something that will only happen with this rare regigigas<br>  <br>  also please sign this petition to have Pokemon gold and silver remade<br>  <a href="http://gopetition.com/online/21064/sign.html" rel="nofollow">http://gopetition.com/online/21064/sign....</a>|`|SApZ3x5waa	I'm only familiar with Gyarados, haven't progressed that far on my file yet, but if the other 5 are anything like it, you should be just fine.|`|QeC5iNNaaa	get rid of mothim|`|71oENb44aa	your team is good because in double battle earthquake wont affect your pokemon ecxept for luxray.....although you are weak on thunder attacks because of garydoes and staraptor...not sure about mothim|`|vH2OF9z8aa	try this card, <br>  The card represents the critical factor for the issue at hand. The Lovers: Love. Beauty. Perfection. Harmony. Trust. Beginning of a romance. Deep feeling. Optimism. Freedom of emotion. The necessity of testing or subjecting to trial. Struggle between sacred and profane love. A meaningful affair.|`|nbuQ8OUsaa	not a bad team. could use some status effect moves.

B9JwxyRfaa	That sounds pretty darn intense!<br>  <br>  I remember tidbits of a few duels I played that went insane, but they aren't as detailed as this.<br>  <br>  Once I faced someone in Eternal Duelist Soul who somehow gotten me into this situation in which he had two 1800 attackers on the field and 250 LP and I had absolutely nothing.  Next turn, I drew Black Pendant (this was before I had the best cards for my deck) and ended my turn.  He cuts down my LP to 50 on his next turn.  Next turn, I draw Ryu-Kishin Powered, equipped him with Black Pendant, and attacked for game.  What a lucky game that was.<br>  <br>  Then there was this one duel in Duel Monsters Online in which the field was completely clear and whoever drew a monster first would attack for game and win.  Four turns later, I draw Witch of the Black Forest and attack for game.<br>  <br>  Another duel I had was when I had managed to clear my opponent's field and hand, only to go on the defensive when my opponent draws BLS - Envoy of the Beginning.  She won that duel with a Cyber Dragon and two Limiter Removals.
nbuQ8OUsaa	i think you change the time on your wii console to the future like 10 years and with all the interest that has been accumulated, you will get alot more money in the bank.<br>  <br>  although note that you run the risk of ruining your town (flowers will be dead, weeds will sprout everywhere, someneighbours would have left, etc.)|`|UISoWtaEaa	Unless you like having weeds, I suggest not doing the cheat.<br>  <br>  When time traveling in the game, you can get a lot of weeds.|`|Cn0cf0b7aa	um. i'm not sure of that cheat. but you can look it up on www.gamesradar.com/cheats. hope i kind of helped...lol or not. well good luck! you can just type it into google. or ask.com idkk!|`|BTWWHvg3aa	There are  numerous cheats for this game
j6MvCr6Naa	Ok there's a solution, every month on the seventh of the month Bungie put up a new playlist called "7 on the 7th" and you will have 0 EXP in it every month which means every month you have the opportunity to get the Achievement. Good Luck.|`|22FpIOqLaa	Bungie has a special game type that happens ever 7th day of every month. Your stats in the playlist are reset every month so you just have to wait till the seventh (which is today) to play the playlist.
9ae55890a5fcfea5236690724138dc1faa	I dont play for anything like exp or ranks. I'm just competitive and play to win and have fun while I'm at it. <br>  Online I get annoyed if I lose to a cheat or if my team let me down but besides that I dont mind.<br>  Offline it annoys me if I lost because of a glitch or if I have to play through the same bit over and over.<br>  The only thing ranks, experience points etc are for is making it harder for good players.(some people use it for boasting but who gives a damn, it's just a game)<br>  <br>  Your right though, some people take it way too seriously and get obsessed. Like the guys on 360 who play for achievement points rather than fun.|`|rm2kykQEaa	Some people cant take a joke lol<br>  and some just dont like losing lol|`|q4i2aPyfaa	I think that it's natural for a boy to play video.Now I'm not a sexist,but men have their own species most of them think the way they do because they don't really care about things unless your a super loser. So my point,it's natural!! Does that answer your question?|`|SApZ3x5waa	For me its just frustration. If there's a particularly hard objective, or time constraint, or quest that I can't complete, or if I'm spending hours restarting this segment because I can't get this achievement, I get frustrated. Its not really anger, its just annoying to be imperfect.|`|MJ0JEN2Faa	Most of the time people are playing for something such as experience points, and when the lose they don't get enough to level up, so they have to play for another hour.<br>  <br>  it's not out of angry, just being lazy

cAMdBtFQaa	I like the WW I versions and earlier.<br>  First thing I would do is get an FFL collectors license, it is called the C&R for curio and relic. It is a ATF <br>  Form 7CR.<br>  For the BAR and MP 40, that gets a little more complicated.  You will have to find what your local regs as well as federal regs are for a class 3 license or 'National firearms and transfer registry items' ownership in your area.  There is federally a permit process for this and the last time I checked the permit ran about $680 for a non-dealer, and 200 for the transfer.<br>  See the attached link to see what the new rules are, the last one refers specifically to Automatic weapons and other things.<br>  Lastly after you get  all your licenses, send copies to all the importers, they will send their catalogs to peruse through.  If cost is not a concern, they will wean you of that idea pretty soon:-)<br>  As a note, if you go to a range with one of these items, be sure you carry a copy of your license, they have a tendency to arrest first and question later.  Also, you will be subject to inspection and verification of storage facilities, and they can call you home from work for the inspection.
