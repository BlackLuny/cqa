The  same comment applies to those foreigners who consider us, Americans foreigners.     It would be helpful for the Olympic committee to have participation of various nationals who speak, read, write and understand different cultures of the world so that the event will be conducted for the enjoyment by all people in this world. What may be acceptable in our culture could be offensive to another culture or be viewed not acceptable by other nationals.

Hence they get 4 times the production for half the price.    Sadly, if London wants it done on time, and without going 10 times over budget they need to get people who actually want to work, and that is different from those who just want to get paid.

Thats 300 Gigawatts of electricity. The current electrical capacity in the united states is 200 Gigagawatts.    I'm not kidding. For less tha the DOD budget of one year the entire electrical capacity of the US could be switch to wind power and replace all oil, coal, and gas fired electrical generation and leave a surplus to charge electric cars.

tezNJNGKaa	Its a bit obvious to me, but I'm only 14, so I've probably got it all wrong.    Obviously there is something over here that immigrants and other people coming into the country want, that jobs here supply. I don't know what that is, but its obviously something.  What would be the point of British people going out to work in Europe? Obviously they aren't giving people what they want, that's why they come over here!  Its unfair though, I think British people should be given priority when it comes to British jobs.   They were here 'first' after all, its their country, why should it not be a right that they get treated as a proper citizen and have the benifit of getting British jobs?   If people want to come over here to have jobs, fine, but they are going to have to wait.|`|i2ZAVM2aaa	They are not welcome|`|96a318bea85eb2aa7d0b38b893875fb9aa	The travelling time is too long every day.|`|NMpbLtuTaa	Is there something wrong in the U.K.?

1EzSAU5Haa	Saddam was a sick Iran-hater Arab who had killed millions of Iranians and Iraqi Shi'a in cold blood.  No Iranian leader would come up with that like nothing has happened.|`|i405qKokaa	Interesting question. Things have changed since the 1980's in Iraq. Back then, Saddam was an ally of both the UK and US, and much of the weaponry in the Iraqi Army came from British companies. Basically, because Iran was hated by the US and UK, they both supported Saddam's war with Iran.  Back to the present day, and the Iranians didn't ally themselves with Saddam's regime, in fact they were pretty much dreading another possible battle between Iran and Iraq.Saddam was pretty much out for himself and his family; I don't think he would have started another war mainly because years of sanctions had screwed his capabilities, and it would have undermined his regime. There would probably be an uneasy peace between them.|`|Bvla09fraa	it'd still be a shithole|`|i7oHTo9haa	Saddam was a rogue and he had to be eliminated.  He was a wild card that would go wherever his whim took him, and plot against other Arabs and the West.  He'd find an oppt't to mess up the status quo and was basically a complication to everyone. Nobody liked Saddam not even the Arab nations.  No, I don't think he'd side with Iran.  I think he'd just be for himself.|`|9SB2Y5r8aa	It's much wonderful what did President SADDAM make wrong towards the American people ??

If need be, also keep a kitchen knife and/or bat/golf club at your bedside. You won't need it but you will feel better for it. Sleep with the lights on if it makes you feel better. If you're friendly with the neighbours, perhaps have a word with them tomorrow about how you're in the house alone and you thought you heard noises so they will keep an eye out for you.    If possible, try to have a friend stay with you or even borrow someone's dog. Even a bit of company is enough to help you feel secure. When I house-sat, I had my dog in the bedroom with me at night.

They are entertainers, that's all.    People are far more interested with whether Britney Spears gets a divorce, and which quarterback does what at a football game that they are about how we can possibly pay for the huge bank bailouts and pork-stimulus packages being pushed through congress.

jZ03Zdjdaa	I agree with ME, above.  Most people consider Phelp's smoking pot on the same level as drinking some beer.

So what if he smokes pot or crack or whatever. It's his life.    Why isn't the media obsessing over the fact that two prominent Democratic tax cheats are being given cushy positions in Obama's government. Why is the treasury minister a tax cheat who evaded $35000 in taxes. Where are the charges?|`|C7baXdSZaa	i dont know he is famous so they probibly would not be to happy|`|fcc97be1ae1addc02f0b674cef5d4949aa	I think there would have been a much different response.  Pot is still considered by most people as not much worse than alcohol.  Crack is and always has been considered a "hard drug"  and carries with it a stigma of "only done by junkies".    SAVAGE NATION:  I'm not sure the response would have depended on skin color but I think the volume of the response certainly would have been different.

I don't think we've even seen the worst of it yet.  You really should hold off on buying that boat, and just save your money.  Things are going to get really ugly over the next year or so, and it's probably going to be pretty bad for the next 2-3 years.    I don't know where you get your income, but if you think you won't lose your job, think again.      And whoever voted thumbs down on that girl who said we're in a depression...you'd better wake up.  She was right.  We're not in a depression right now, but we're on the verge of a depression.  We haven't even seen all the long-term effects of all the businesses that are going under, and all the people who are being laid off right now.  It will take time for the effect to filter through the economy.   So many people being unemployed (and consumer spending dropping like a rock since people are unemployed and can't spend any money) is going to have long-term effects that we haven't seen yet.  We haven't seen the worst of it.    The other problem is what I think they call "stagflation" where incomes are falling, there is no spending or investment, but prices are still rising.  No one has any money, but haven't you noticed that the cost of gas and groceries is still going up?    Sorry to be so negative...but things are going to be bad for a while.  Really bad.  It won't be as bad as the Great Depression in the 1930's, probably nowhere near as bad as that.  But it will probably be the worst thing we've experienced in our lifetimes.  I'm 31, and so this is probably the worst thing I've seen in my lifetime.  People tell me that the recession in the early 90's was pretty bad...but I was just a kid then and I didn't understand what was going on.    Things will get better, but not for a while.  I say the next couple of years are going to be rough.  I would wait before you get that boat.  And besides, no one can get credit right now...unless you pay cash out right, forget about it.  You're not going to get financed.|`|zHQVlXd5aa	Why should you suffer when he is the one who is broke?|`|9BuQq8X0aa	Not to answer a question with a question...but  What does your neighbors truck being repoed really have to do with you buying a new boat? Were you a co-signer on the truck? By purchasing the boat, will it make you feel as if you are flaunting while your neighbor now has to figure how to get from point A to point B? Are you going to feel bad if you get the boat..is that what this question is all about? Drama King..chil please do you really care?      Look, I agree with the dude who said, if you can afford a new boat..just buy it. The only effects that boat should have on your neighbor is if you park it on their property. Otherwise get your boat.     When is the recession going to be over? Buy your new boat and then ask that question again in a year!|`|1bd6f7dcd94b559f97fdb31387c7926faa	Yes, it's now a depression.
2bf7b1928da0ba8574b96d3c8eb7ff68aa	Rush Limbaugh is an entertainer.

6093550b9308429b874e5a267fb27439aa	Although I have a very fine Arab ENT specialist, I do not think I would like to be in an Arab hospital.    There are enough Arabs in Israeli hospitals, dancing on the beds on 9/11, and when the Scuds were falling.    Overheard in Hadassah Hospital "You must let the doctor do it, so you can go grow strong and kill Jews"|`|m8FATLu4aa	Of course, Israelis would be kicked out of "Palestinian" hospitals... just like they were kicked out of Arab countries when Israel was created-- nothing more than retaliation there, too.    In addition, if Arabs (nonJewish) can live in Israel without fear of being hurt or killed, I think Jews (Israelis, as the case may be) should be free to live in Arab countries with the same rights.  But, it is not this way.    Hope this helps.|`|AA11276628	no, they would not be kicked out, they would be killed on the spot.  You see what happened to Innocent Israelis that got lost and by mistake ended in a Palestinian village - they were linched and killed with no mercy|`|lPO4D8PLaa	I dont think Israelis would want to go into Palestinian hospitals -- there is high probability of them getting bombed by Israeli airplanes or being shelled.|`|LisP31O8aa	Sorry, I'm not there and don't know, so listen to those who are there, not the propaganda and not what your own prejudice inclines you to think.  I find it amazing that so few people know what that area was like before and just after WW 2 - it was a poverty stricken, desert waste land, not fit for humans and the arab settlements were primitive places.      Do some investigation as to just what the Jewish people accomplished and did for that area, it is awesome, and, no, I am not Jewish.  I'm not Christian either and I'm certainly not Muslim.  What  I am  is a little more able to take a non-biased point of view because of this.     Before you are so quick to condemn, get the facts for yourself, read some books.  It's all in the books, it's all right there if you care to enlighten yourself.   Try reading Exodus first of all and it has an exciting story line along with the historical data that will keep you riveted, it by Leon Uris.  That's a good start then come back and ask and do some answering.|`|Klp0Mv6kaa	No,they would not be kicked out of the "palestinian "hospital,for very simple reason;they would not get there,because the "peaceloving" palestinian arabs would tear them to pieces before that.    http://news.faithfreedom.org/gallery2/v/...    http://news.faithfreedom.org/gallery2/v/...|`|xFJ2zjIVaa	well if a Palestinian kicked a Israeli out of the hospital  the Israeli army would fire bomb the place so....      EDIT:  WTF   all i see here is  that 3 people have a sense of humor|`|e7276387cff3a4d02088a066ab5617b3aa	Ahh yes, I wonder if those people in the Israeli hospitals were the victims of white phosphorous that struck the UN school. Or maybe they were the women and children shot down in Gaza while holding up white flags. Heck, they might have been members of the 100+ family Israel stuffed into one house and later shelled.    http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1054...  http://www.btselem.org/English/Testimoni...  http://www.ynet.co.il/english/articles/0...

Your charges about the media do not meet that definition.     Doesn't sound like there's any changing your mind about the rest of your statement, either, even though there are few instances in my years in the business where a story was held back for one reason for another.
