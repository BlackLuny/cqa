7uFaB8QQaa	Technically, not all of the star's mass goes into the black hole since the collapse is usually preceeded by a nova or supernova event which send a great deal of the star's mass out into space.<br>  <br>  Now looking at this from a Newtonian view point, the strength of the gravitational field is GM/r^2 where M = mass of the star or black hole and r is outside of the star's mass or the hole's event horizon.<br>  <br>  Now assuming an isotropic density in mass, you cna write M as<br>  <br>    M = p*4pi a^3/3  where a = the star's radius or the black hole's event horizon and p = mass density.   To keep mass constant, p has to behave like  p = p0/a^3.  <br>  <br>  But as long as you are at a distance greater than a, you see only the field due to the total mass M.  This is true in the full general relativity (GR) theory as well.  So outside of the mass, the density doesn't matter only the total mass does.  Now GR also allows for motions (flows) and such inside the mass and these can affect the gravitational field outside ofthe mass but they are generally weaker than the Newtonian contribution. <br>  <br>  In the case of the black hole, you'll note the gravity field ofr a given mass is unchanged from that of a normal star.  What is different is how fast the field changes in space - the gradients.  They are orders of magnitude greater for a black hole than a star.  So if you were unlucky enough to fall into a black hole feet first, there would be a point before the event horizon where the force of gravity was so much stronger at your feet than at your head where you would literally be torn apart.|`|rcPnnfmmaa	Suppose you put a bowling ball on a trampoline. It makes a large depression in the surface of the trampoline but the force is spread out.<br>  <br>  Suppose you ask Superman to compress the bowling ball into something the size of a pea but that still has the same mass. You'll still have a big depression but in the center is a near-vertical well that goes straight down to the pea.<br>  <br>  The trampoline represents the curvature of space and time; the closer to vertical the trampoline fabric the stronger local gravity is and the more time is slowed. The pea is also infinitely small if it's a real black hole.<br>  <br>  Density does not make gravity stronger, but it can concentrate it's effects.

Km8hU4lgaa	Your answers are absolutely correct.  The first one would be 12.16% and the second question evaluates to Pr {cured} = (0.9)^18 = 0.1501 or 15.01%.|`|cdcec5a9c09477417e887534e87f188caa	I agree with the answer for 20 cured, but the answer for 18 (90%) is not correct.  What you did to get your answer was this:<br>  <br>  0.9^18 = .1501  <br>  <br>  That might look correct, but what if I asked you what the odds of two people being cured were?  Using this formula, you would come up with:<br>  <br>  0.9^2 = 0.81<br>  <br>  81%?  Doesn't this seem abnormally high?  How about the odds of one person being cured?:<br>  <br>  0.9^1 = 0.9<br>  <br>  90%?  Obviously, something's wrong since the odds of one person cured plus two people cured are well over 100%.<br>  <br>  This is how you do it...<br>  <br>  You need to use factorials:<br>  <br>  20!<br>  ----------  * (0.9^18) * (0.1^2)<br>  (18!)(2!)<br>  <br>  which equals 0.2852...or around 28.5%.<br>  <br>  These are the odds that 18...and EXACTLY 18...people will get cured.  (In other words, this does NOT include the percentages for if 19 or 20 were cured.)<br>  <br>  So, if the question really is asking what are the chances of at least 90% being cured, the answer is: 0.6769...or around 67.7%.

Gnfc4wRlaa	I am having difficulty finding anything about the actual size of the African Plate.  It is roughly the same shape as Africa, includes the entire continent, and goes out to the mid-Ocean ridge on the west, almost halfway to Australia on the East, and about halfway to Antarctica on the south.  The boundaries run pretty close to Africa on the northeast (through the Gulf of Aden and the Red Sea) and north (about midway across the Mediterranean).  It appears to be 2 - 3 times the size of the continent itself.  <br>  <br>  If you get the dimension of the continent of Africa, look at the illustration on the referenced page, and estimate the additional distances, you can calculate the approximate size of the plate.  Then you can set a scale to get down to the size you have to build your model.  I just noticed that you are doing the Arabian plate with it, so you will need to include that to get your distance across.<br>  <br>  From the most northerly point, Ras ben Sakka in Tunisia, in 37°21′ N, to the most southerly point, Cape Agulhas in South Africa, is a distance approximately of 8,000 km (5,000 miles); from Cape Verde,  the westernmost point, to Ras Hafun in Somalia, the most easterly projection, is a distance (also approximately) of 7,400 km (4,600 miles).  To get the widest part of the plate east to west, it looks about double the width of Africa.  That would be around 9,200 miles across.  Looking at the plate, I would guess you only need to add about 2500 miles to get from the northern to the southern tip, giving you 7500 miles. You could use a scale of 1 inch = 200 miles.  That would give you a distance across the plate of 37.5" and north to south of 48 inches. You could put this on a 3 1/2' x 5' board.  Well, it seems I got a little carried away and figured your scale for you.  Oh well, I hope this helps.|`|a86HbDIZaa	Use a map.

So, yes, you rinse with water to start, but then you need to fill it with your reagent and discharge it to waste a couple of times to make sure it does not contain anything to dilute or change your reagent you are pipetting. A burette is prepared in the same way, paying particular attention to any liquid held in and below the tap.<br>  <br>  However, a flask used in a titration is treated differently. That is just rinsed with water, as you do not want to add any reagent before the titration starts that is not coming out of the pipette. Water diluting what is in the flask doesn't change the volume needed for a titration.|`|4fdeb5e83b0e4e59d0ce45d49190dc78aa	To create a blank canvas.  Most tap water has chemicals in it which may react creating a false reading.  If you live in a hard water area you'll see the evidence of this in your kettle.
M9JcanLKaa	I depends what you are using it for, but typically if you are doing a titration you would add a known volume by pipette. Had you rinsed the flask with your solution the residual amount would not have been accounted for by your measurement. The important thing is to know what weight (calculated from the reagent's concentration and volume added) of your reagent you have in the flask and the only way to achieve that it to have none there when you start. Any residual water in the flask does not affect the amount of the solute of what you have pipetted into it.|`|ToztjpAsaa	I guess you're talking about some sort of analytical technique like a titration?<br>  <br>  If you rinse the flask out with one of the solutions, you're going to introduce extra material into the flask which will give you results that will be too high.|`|fTnAgUU0aa	The idea of rinsing something with de-ionized water is to remove anything from the container that could react with the solution it is to contain. By rinsing with the solution, it can keep some of the reacted chemical in the solution and cause adverse affects in the expected reaction.<br>  <br>  Another reason is so that if you are dealing with an analytical quantity of solution, that you don't offset the amount of solution that you expected to have in the solution due to some residual solution in the container. <br>  <br>  Even water can sometimes react with a solution and cause adverse effects, so its a good idea to make sure that the container is completely dry before proceeding. This is better than letting another dry due to the ability water completely evaporating and leave no residue.|`|tfuPCVzOaa	Hey, you need to wash the thing out first to get rid of any impurities.

1fa66c900c1e2a911c8a1d3ef775da12aa	T'' is the double derivative of T(t) as you may know.  The first derivative is rate of temperature increase or decrease (degrees per second for example) and the double derivative is the acceleration of temperature (degrees / second / second or degrees / second^2).  A negative double derivative would say that the person's temperature is accelerating down, which presuming the guy has a fever, is good!!  However, if he has hypothermia (he's cold), that would be bad.  So I would say it would depend on whether the illness is making him warm or cold, and you would need to know T(0).  (On the other hand, if you assume that being sick definitely means he has a fever, then you wouldn't need to know T(0), and T''(0) = -2 would be best).  Hope this makes sense.
Gnfc4wRlaa	The answer will change depending on what time frame the teacher is looking at.  As of the 2006 and 2008 ozone hole seasons, the answer would be false, but for other years, it would be true.  Since your book says "bigger than", the answer the teacher wants is likely to be false.  Generally they go by the book.<br>  <br>  The ozone hole builds up over the winter months, peaking at around September and breaking up again by December.  It does not remain the same size from year to year.  This would explain why the answer varies from your 2002 book.  <br>  <br>  "From September 21 to 30, 2006, the average area of the ozone hole was the largest ever observed, at 10.6 million square miles."<br>  <br>  "The continent of North America covers an area of approximately 9,450,000 square miles "<br>  <br>  "Nov 4, 2008 ...

So, simply plug in everything you know. (e is just like pi; it's a real number represented by a symbol, so don't try to plug in anything for it) So let's say you had an investment of $1. Replace P with 1. Now substitute 2 for A, because the final amount you end up with is going to be double your initial amount of $1. Now, replace r with .123 (because 12.3% written as a decimal is .123). That leaves us with 2 = e^.123t. Now, if you switch the sides so that e^.123t = 2, you'll see that you can put it into logarithmic form. That gives us log(base e)2 = .123t, so now we can simplify. (Where it says base e, insert a subscript e for the base.) Log base e is the same thing is ln, so now we have ln2 = .123t. Now, divide both sides by .123, and you will have the answer for t.

9bab7f0068572ef4366826bbc2c52e30aa	I am an MD. In my opinion, the answer is both 3 and none, depending on how you look at it. In a simpleminded way, three water molecules are in fact formed as a result of combining 3 fatty acids to a glycerol molecule. However, this reaction, as stated, NEVER happens in real life, and no cell possesses any enzyme that can accomplish such a tall order. What actually happens is that a fatty acid is first combined with a coenzyme, such as Coenzyme-A, forming a water molecule in the process, and then this fatty acid-coenzyme complex is subsequently combined with the glycerol moiety, releasing no water molecules. So, at the actual moment when the fatty acid is joined to the glycerol, NO WATER is produced. Therefore, the question is a bad one and should either be rephrased or withdrawn, in my humble opinion.|`|kGUpSkhEaa	3 molecules; <br>  <br>  A fatty acid could be described as: R-CO-OH<br>  The glycerol molecule like: HO-CH2-CHOH-CH2OH<br>  When they are combined, the product will be:<br>  <br>  CH2 - CH - CH2<br>  |..........|.......|<br>  CO.....CO..CO<br>  R........R.....R<br>  <br>  Balance it, you will notice that there are need 3 water molecules, the number of water molecules that are formed|`|2xpzhN5faa	3.<br>  For each fatty acid to join onto the glycerol, a condensation reaction has to occur, producing three water molecules.|`|AA10622261	What we are interested in is the final result and not the individual stages of the reaction. Overall the above reaction does produce 3 water molecules. <br>  <br>  It's like saying that glucose plus oxygen gives carbon dioxide and water though glucose never actually combines directly with oxygen. That process is far more complicated than that.
vVfH8yBYaa	If she's snorting oxycontin, she has a serious problem. Certainly chemical dependence, and probably addiction. It's possible she has developed a tolerance and doesn't get high, but it's not the "high" that matters. It's the fact that she's getting 12 hours of medication up her nose and into her system in minutes. She very well could kill herself doing this. She needs help. Now.|`|bbb941465ccc4a1ec3a57d5ff0a4b17baa	Well, while there are certainly people who take high doses of painkillers without being addicted, I don't think that's the case with your girlfriend.  There is only one reason to crush and snort a oxycodone tablet, it's to get it into your bloodstream as quickly as possible and cause blood levels to spike dramatically, albeit for a short time.  This is abusing the drug, and it's generally done to get high.|`|bHPB2CuUaa	Most people in moderate to severe pain do not become addicted to pain medication if taken only to the extent it relieves pain. But snorting it doesn't seem like the intended route of administration. She probably doesn't really even know if she would have withdrawal if she stopped. Tolerance does develop, so it should only be taken in quantities to relieve the pain.|`|EFOBeGu4aa	It is possible to become immune to the amount she is taking, therefore she tries to take more or she uses alternative methods to get it in her system quicker.

Any pills you find are just the stock of that store, so she might want to consider a rehab now.  It shouldn't be a problem since she says she can stop it easily.|`|Qnklk4uOaa	It is certainly possible for people to build such a tolerance to medication that they don't feel the effects of it. But her actions are in no way conducive to that being the case for her.<br>  Think about it this way, if you had a head-ache and your normal Tylenol wasn't helping, would you resort to snorting it? The only time someone snorts a pill is to get the mental effects of it.<br>  I know many people with chronic pain that have to consistently up a dosage to aid the pain, but none have ever denied the mental side effects and they explain their situation to their doctor.<br>  Your girlfriend may be a great person and I have no doubt that she is in a lot of pain (Oxycodone isn't something doctors prescribe to everyone) but she is lying to you. perhaps because she is scared that you will no longer care for her.<br>  I hope this helps.
AA10927246	You have a choice of 4 suits for the flush.<br>  Then you need to pick 5 of the cards in that suit (of 13 cards)<br>  <br>  C(4,1) * C(13,5)<br>  = 4 * 1287<br>  = 5,148 flushes<br>  <br>  P.S.  Note:  This assumes you want to consider all flushes, even those that would be considered straight flushes or royal flushes.  If you want to exclude these higher ranked hands, then you would have to subtract them.  There are 10 hands in a flush of a specific suit that are also straight flushes.  So instead of 4 x 1287 you would compute 4 x 1277 = 5,108 flushes.<br>  <br>  P.P.S.  This uses combinations.  Perhaps you inadvertantly used permutations.  That would result in a higher number (by a factor of 5! = 120).  It's important to note that the order of the cards doesn't matter.  A hand with a 2?, 5?, 7?, 9?, K? is the same as the same flush but in a different order (e.g. 5?, K?, 9?, 2?, 7?).  Don't count that more than once.|`|fKKcrT8Maa	13 of each suit, and 5 in a hand. 4 suits.<br>  <br>  4 ( 13 C 5 ) =  5,148<br>  <br>  5,148 flushes.<br>  <br>  It seems high, but there are a total of 2,598,960 5-card hands total, so the number is relatively low.<br>  <br>  Combinations are for things that order does not matter, like a hand of cards or members of a committee.<br>  <br>  Permutations deal with things in which order does matter, like a license plate.<br>  <br>  This is a combination.

lhB213Imaa	If you prepared it with pure water, you would end up reducing the solute concentration in the blood plasma (which normally contains some salts and other dissolved molecules), and suddenly your blood cells would be in a hyptonic solution.  This would cause water to enter the erythrocytes (red blood cells) and they would lyse, or rupture.<br>  <br>  This happens because water will always tend to flow from an area of low solute concentration to an area of high solute concentration.

The name "cyanobacteria" comes from the color of the bacteria (Greek: κυαν?? (kyanós) = blue). They are a significant component of the marine nitrogen cycle and an important primary producer in many areas of the ocean, but are also found in habitats other than the marine environment; in particular cyanobacteria are known to occur in both freshwater[2] and hypersaline inland lakes.[3]<br>  <br>  Stromatolites of fossilized oxygen-producing cyanobacteria have been found from 2.8 billion years ago.[4] The ability of cyanobacteria to perform oxygenic photosynthesis is thought to have converted the early reducing atmosphere into an oxidizing one, which dramatically changed the composition of life forms on Earth by provoking an explosion of biodiversity and leading to the near-extinction of oxygen-intolerant organisms. Chloroplasts in plants and eukaryotic algae have evolved from cyanobacteria via endosymbiosis.

For example, the Sun is 8 light MINUTES from earth. Pluto is 12 light HOURS from earth. We (humans) only recently decided that Pluto does not qualify as a planet. Our knowledge of our universe is so elementary. It only takes a spark to create life, and our universe is full of the ingredients. (Carbon, water, et al.) What is life?

We have already determined that Mars has water, one of the fundamental building blocks for life. We already know it has a high density of carbon dioxide,  it is quite possible that there are micro-organisms in the water on mars. However is there life that is sentient? Most probably not, at least within our solar system. <br>  <br>  Currently studying Physics and Religious studies, I have learned that one should not confuse any scientific evidence to either prove, or disprove any religious beliefs. Religion is here for the pure purpose to give people morals, and try to explain why we exist. Science just is here to give us the facts of life, and how we exist. Science can't give us morals, and can't give us the answer to why we are here. Religion equally can't explain how we came to be.<br>  <br>  Chances are, aliens will, if sentient, have their own religious beliefs. If so, they would believe things differently to how we believe things on earth, regardless of our many different religions, but it may still have the basic moral guidelines for how they should live their lives.<br>  <br>  If aliens do exist.. people will challenge their faith, and start to not believe in their religion more so, but they will be challenging their own faith for the wrong reasons. Just because aliens exist, doesn't mean the message is wrong.|`|MonqhJU6aa	Well it depends on how you tackle that question.<br>  <br>  If you completely forget about theology and think only science, than yes there can be life on other planets. Organisms can evolve in other planets just like it did on Earth (although there is a theory that life on Earth didn't start on Earth but rather, Earth was hit by a meteor from another planet that had life). I don't think we should worry just yet about technological advancements such as UFOs but I definitely think there is life outside of Earth.<br>  <br>  Theologically, in terms of most religions, such as Christianity and Judaism, Earth is the only planet with life. If the religions that say Earth is the only planet with life are the real religions, as in their god(s) exists in reality, than we are the only lifeforms in space.<br>  <br>  If life is found on other planets than there are many possibilities to what will happen to religion. Let's take a look at Christianity since I'm more versed in Christianity than any other religion. It could happen that devout people will think it is a trickery of the devil, or a test of their faith, so they will remain true to religion. Others will just plain believe in evolution. Religion will turn into a laughing stock because people are so used to proof and since there will be, what seems to be, concrete proof that their religion is wrong, those who 'stubbornly' believe their religion will be mocked. It will turn into prejudice.|`|1jdRPGMyaa	AH! I have a theory that me and my friends disputed... This theory only applies if you think that the universe is infinite.

lhB213Imaa	Accumulation of memories is a process of forming networks of brain cells (neurons).  The specific patterns of connections and their ability to signal chemically and electrically determines the nature of the memory.  So, there isn't necessarily a "waste substance" accumulating.<br>  <br>  Therefore, the loss of "old" memories is largely a matter of those connections weakening.  Parts of the cells that connect to others may simply die off and be digested.  I imagine that debris from old dead cell connections may be absorbed by microglia or float off into the CSF (cerebrospinal fluid).<br>  <br>  The idea that "we only use 10% of our brains" is a misleading tidbit of pop psychology.  Many of your brain cells have little to do with information processing: they are there simply to support the neurons.  These include glia and oligodendrocytes.  They may serve an immune function, or transport nutrients to neurons, etc.|`|hhRuKIzRaa	psychological waste = wisdom... if you are smart enough to know how to recycle it!|`|oD2oRzBmaa	The idea that we only use 10% of our brains is a myth. All parts of our bodies have developed a "use it or lose it" mechanism and the brain is no different. Our brains are pretty "expensive" biologically (they take a lot of energy to run), and if the body could cut out 90% it would; yet we still have all of our brains intact. All parts of the brain have a purpose, but potentially very specialized (evidence of this is shown in stroke or brain damage victims losing different abilities depending on what parts of their brains they lose). The best explanation I can think of of where this misconception came from is by misinterpretation.. if someone had said "on average we only use a fraction of our brains for a given task." It would be easy for someone to disregard the second part of this statement and spread this shortened "fact" to the point where it is taken as unquestionable truth.  If we could use 100% of our brains for doing one thing, then simple things like talking and walking at the same time would be impossible.<br>  <br>  From experience, our memories (and also connections in our brain) are continuously subject to "erosion." Depending on whether the memory or connection gets recalled/used or not, it is either strengthened or removed. This serves to get rid of "useless" facts  or memories and keep the pertinent information more easily accessible, and was likely beneficial to our survival at one point in our ancestors' existence.

8gb7OG4laa	technically no, doppler only refers to sound waves, not light. what happens with light (red and blue shifting) is doppler effect like, but not technically the doppler effect.<br>  <br>  as to will it work for radiation of any frequency, well since the effect changes the frequency of the radiation  the answer should be fairly obvious. there are galaxies moving away from us so fast that their light has completely shifted into infra red, you can't even see them in visible light anymore, and in theory if an object was moving towards us fast enough its light could be shifted into the ultra violet or even x-ray region  of the spectrum. <br>  <br>  so the answer is yes... but technically no.<br>  <br>  clear as mud?|`|e0227973f38e13ea78ebdb8fcda760efaa	Yes|`|ftwGaZ4Uaa	Yes.

If they are distorted enough, they can become another form of E.M wave, just as yellow light can be seen as red light.|`|Ps8FtPYHaa	Yes, an example of this is the 'red shift' its when light from far away galaxies are shifted to the red light end of the spectrum, this is because of the doppler effect, and since light is an electro magnetic wave, doppler effect works!|`|4k7AHnvAaa	The Doppler effect works for everything on the electromagnetic spectrum.

q0ce9dEnaa	Some of them are not steps, but descriptions. Sperm and egg cells are haploid cells, meaning that they each have 23 of the 46 chromosomes that a human has. Also, they are both gametes. But fertilization is first, which results in a zygote. The zygote develops into a fetus, after becoming a blastula and then gastrula. This may be wrong, but I'm 99% sure.

YHNK9UrQaa	The "ology" ending means "the study of".<br>  <br>  Morphology is the study of what something looks like, how it is shaped, it's form, it's size, etc.<br>  <br>  E. coli are spherical, so they are cocci. <br>  <br>  E. coli are not rod shaped, so they are not bacilli<br>  <br>  E. coli are not spiral shaped, so they are not spirilli.<br>  <br>  EDIT:  <br>  <br>  O.K., your teacher wants the morphology of the COLONIES, not the individual bacterial cells.  Colonies vary in size, surface, texture, elevation, margin and colour. You will need to describe your colonies using those parameters.  <br>  <br>  Check out this web site for a more detailed explanation:<br>  <a href="http://www.rci.rutgers.edu/~microlab/CLASSINFO/IMAGESCI/colony%20Morphology.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.rci.rutgers.edu/~microlab/CLA...</a><br>  <br>  TSA (trypticase soy agar), MSA (mannitol salt agar),  and EMB (eosin methylene blue) are different kinds of agar (the  agar is the jelly-like substance that was poured into the Petrie dishes for you to grow the bacterial colonies on).  They are used to help identify which species of bacteria you are working on.<br>  <br>  TSA is an all purpose sort of agar that has nutrients for most bacteria.  Most of them should grow.  The morphology of the colonies growing on this agar might appear to be different from what they look like grown on a more specialized agar.<br>  <br>  EMB contains eosin dye, methylene blue dye and lactose sugar.   It is used to identify different kinds of bacteria.  (1) The dyes are poisonous to gram negative bacteria, so those won’t have any morphology at all.  The ones that do grow will all be gram positive.  (2) Some gram positive bacteria ferment lactose, while others don’t.  When bacteria ferment lactose, they decrease the pH of the agar which causes the agar to turn purple and causes the bacteria to appear to be metallic green in colour.<br>  <br>  MSA contains mannitol sugar, salt and phenol red indicator.  The salt inhibits the growth of most bacteria.  When Staph is grown on MSA, the colonies of the ones that can ferment manitol appear yellow; the colonies of the ones that do not ferment mannitol sugar appear as small red colonies.<br>  <br>  Yeah, so after you know what the colonies look like on the various types of agar, you might have enough information to indentify your bacteria with a dichotomous key, etc.|`|vAU57Hitaa	Here Are Many Definitions : the branch of biology that deals with the structure of animals and plants <br>  studies of the rules for forming admissible words <br>  the admissible arrangement of sounds in words <br>  the branch of geology that studies the characteristics and configuration and evolution of rocks and land forms <br>  wordnet.princeton.edu/perl/webwn<br>  <br>  Galaxy morphological classification is a system used by astronomers to divide galaxies into groups based on their visual appearance. ...<br>  en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphology_(astr...<br>  <br>  Morphology is the field of linguistics that studies the internal structure of words.

This is in contrast to physiology, which deals primarily with function.<br>  <br>  Morphology is a branch of life science dealing with the study of gross structure of an organism or taxon and its component parts.<br>  <br>  Also in use is the term "gross morphology", which refers to the prominent or principal aspects of an organism or taxon's morphology.

Typically, closely related taxa differ much less than more distantly related ones, but there are exceptions to this. Cryptic species are species which look very similar, or perhaps even outwardly identical, but are reproductively isolated. Conversely, sometimes unrelated taxa acquire similar appearance through convergent evolution or even through mimicry. A further problem with relying on morphological data is that what may appear, morphologically speaking, to be two distinct species, may in fact be shown by DNA analysis to be a single species.|`|W4UjWKQtaa	Morphology is the physical shape of the bacteria.

This makes the g value cancel out so you're left in moles. Since the enthalpy of formation is in kJ/mol, multiply this value by the mole value you calculated. This will cancel out the mole variable, which will leave you in kJ, which is the answer.|`|0TaFg8KGaa	Thanks for acknowledging its an exam question, now you don't get the answer. But to help. Work in moles. Make that 10 g some number of moles. Then use moles in the formation enthalpy given. Chemistry is best worked as number of molecules, not weight. A mole is especially useful because it is directly converted to number of molecules with Avogadro's Number, but you don't need that here.

The easiest way to do it would be to assume the pool is a certain size that is divisible by both of the pumps.  I picked two different sizes-20 gallons and 40 gallons.  Since Pump A takes 5 hours to fill a 20 gallon pool, it pumps at 4 gallons per hour, and since pump B takes 20 hours to fill a 20 gallon pool, it pumps 1 gallon per hour.  You add the two pump speeds together, getting 5 gallons per hour and divide the pool size (20 gallons) by that, getting 4 hours.  You get the same answer when you use 40 gallons.|`|Wagcdklxaa	Let<br>  <br>  T = time for the pool to be filled up using both pumps<br>  <br>  Working formula is<br>  <br>  1/5 + 1/20 = 1/T<br>  <br>  (4 + 1)/20 = 1/T<br>  <br>  T = 20/5<br>  <br>  T = 4 hours<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.

UFteXlqwaa	Let's assume two air parcels, each of one cubic meter and at sea surface. One is 15 C with an absolute humidity of 13 gr/m3. The other is 0 C with an absolute humidity of 5 gr/m3. (I use those two values beause I know them by heart! :-)<br>  <br>  Say they are both at 80% relative humidity and in a standard adiabatic lapse rate, they will rise and condense below dew point temperature at roughtly 2,000 ft AMSL. <br>  <br>  Their volume will be greater than a cubic meter now because the pressure will be less. Their temperature will be respectively, 13 C and -2 C. But their absolute humidity will be exactly the same; 13 and 5 grams. Hence the colder air will have less water droplets per cubic meter.<br>  <br>  ... Hum, I think you're right: clouds are more translucent in the winter!|`|6f4545987db8cc09b8bec883d38d82faaa	That's very interesting.<br>  <br>  From what I've noticed, living in Alaska, it seems like it's darker on rainy days than during the winter when it snows when the sky is completely covered by clouds on both occasions.  It seems that way to me lol maybe cause rain is so gloomy and I just love it when it snows.<br>  <br>  I know that clouds reflect light, so the thicker it is the less light goes through.  But then even when there are thin looking clouds when it's about to rain, it looks grayish.  That's weird huh.  Maybe it has something to do with snow, cause it's white and we associate white as bright - as long as light is coming through the clouds even if it's not noticeable.  Come to think of it, can't really see the clouds when it snows lol especially when it's a blizzard.  But it is "bright" even if it's blizzardy, it's not dark as in night dark.  <br>  <br>  During winter I've seen dark clouds though so I don't think it has much to do with temperature but I'm not an expert.  The clouds are still white but something makes them appear dark to us.<br>  <br>  *<br>  You know what, now that I think about it - the dark clouds I see in the winter, it's warmer on those days than on other colder cloudy days when clouds are not dark.  Maybe you're right about the temperature thing.|`|wzCJNj3Baa	Hard to tell. I live in a location where it often snows. But when it snows there usually are not enough lighting from the Sun to do a fair comparison to a raining cloud at summertime. Also it often snows at night when the temperature drops.<br>  <br>  I believe the translucence of the cloud has more to do with how high the cloud goes. Thunder clouds rise to very high altitudes giving a very dark appearance.

Water, for example, actually expands when it solidifies.  Temperature is a measurement of energy in a solid.  That energy exists in the vibration of molecules.

bf5cDEyZaa	The secretion of hormones from the pituitary gland (which is part of the endocrine system) is closely controlled by the brain, especially by the hypothalamus (which is part of the nervous system).|`|FiDcOMgxaa	The nervous and endocrine systems are related in three main areas, structure, chemical, and function. The endocrine and nervous system work parallel with each other and in conjunction function in maintaining homeostasis, development and reproduction. Both systems are the communication links of the body and aid the body’s life systems to function correctly and in relation to each other.<br>  <br>  Structurally many of the endocrine systems glands and tissues are rooted in the nervous system, Such glands as the hypothalamus and posterior pituitary are examples of nerve tissues that influence the function of a gland and it’s secretion of hormones. Not only does the hypothalamus secrete hormones into the bloodstream, but it regulates the release of hormones in the posterior pituitary gland. Those that are not made of nervous tissue once were. The adrenal medulla is derived from the same cells that produce certain ganglia.<br>  <br>  Chemically both the endocrine and nervous system function in communication by means of the same transmitters but use them in different ways. Hormones are utilized by both systems in signaling an example of this can be seen in the use of Norepinephrine. Norepineprine functions as a neurotransmitter in the nervous system and as an adrenal hormone in the endocrine system.<br>  <br>  Functionally the nervous and endocrine system work hand in hand acting in communicating and driving hormonal changes. They work in maintaing homeostasis and respond to changes inside and outside the body. Besides functioning in similar manners they work in conjunction. An example of this can be seen in a mothers release of milk. When a baby sucks the nipple of its mother, sensory cells in the nipple sends signals to the hypothalmus, which then responds by releaing oxytocin from the posterior pituitary. The oxytocin is released into the bloodstream where it moves to its’ target cell, a mammary gland. The mammary gland then responds to the hormones signal by releasing milk through the nipple. Besides working in conjunction with each other, both systems affect one another. The adrenal medulla is under control the control of nerve cells, but the nervous systems development is under the control of the endocrine system.|`|Np3otDqwaa	The nervous system is all about receptors,<br>  Receptors throughout your body that send messages to the coordinating center in your body fro regulation.

Features of endocrine glands are, in general, their ductless nature, their vascularity, and usually the presence of intracellular vacuoles or granules storing their hormones.

SvmZlLdaaa	In my opinion, animal testing is wrong on both moral and scientific grounds.<br>  <br>  Morally, it is often extremely cruel and completely unnecessary - for example, I once saw some undercover footage from a laboratory in which dogs were being force-fed weedkiller which had already been tested on humans. The dogs were given 50 times what had been established as a dangerous dose for humans - what possible reason could there have been for this? The 'scientists' involved were clearly either seriously lacking in training or were just plain idiots, because one of them accidentally inserted the tube delivering the weedkiller into the dog's trachea rather than its oesophagus, filling its lungs with fluid. Barbaric.<br>  <br>  Scientifically, testing things on animals is unreliable and potentially dangerous. Animals react differently to humans to many substances, rendering many tests pointless. For example, a contraceptive called Tamoxifen was once developed which was tested on rats. It worked as intended, and was given to humans. However, it had the opposite effect on women, actually increasing their fertility! <br>  <br>  There are many other examples, some of which had much more harmful consequences. I don't know if you remember it, but a couple of years ago a drug called TGN1412 was tested on some human volunteers, and very nearly killed them - they were on life support for some time, and were left with permanent health problems. Prior to being given to these people, this drug had already been tested on monkeys at a dose 500 times stronger than that which was given to the humans, without causing the monkeys any ill effects. Aspirin causes birth defects in cats. Penicillin kills guinea pigs. 6-azauridine, a cancer drug which can be used in humans for long periods, will kill dogs in a few days in even small doses. The list goes on.<br>  <br>  I realize that some people feel that animal testing is necessary and that the end justifies the means - these people are entitled to their opinion, but I do not share it, personally. I don't think a human's life should be considered more important than a dog's or a rat's or a monkey's - animals have just as much right to live as we do, and the right to live that life free of pain and misery. As noted philosopher Jeremy Bentham put it, the central question is not "Can they reason?" nor "Can they talk?", but "Can they suffer?" And obviously they can. Our greater intelligence gives us a responsibility to protect other species, not the right to use and abuse them for our own ends.|`|6z4BnpQ9aa	Killing animals in certain techinques are inhumane.

YpUhEviCaa	Biomes are climatically and geographically defined areas of ecologically similar climatic conditions such as communities of plants, animals, and soil organisms, [1] and are often referred to as ecosystems. Biomes are defined by factors such as plant structures (such as trees, shrubs, and grasses), leaf types (such as broadleaf and needleleaf), plant spacing (forest, woodland, savanna), and climate. Unlike ecozones, biomes are not defined by genetic, taxonomic, or historical similarities. Biomes are often identified with particular patterns of ecological succession and climax vegetation (quasi-equilibrium state of the local ecosystem). An ecosystem has a habitat and a biome is a major habitat type. A major habitat type, however, is a compromise, as it has an intrinsic inhomogeneity.<br>  <br>  The biodiversity characteristic of each biome, especially the diversity of fauna and subdominant plant forms, is a function of abiotic factors and the biomass productivity of the dominant vegetation. In terrestrial biomes, species diversity tends to correlate positively with net primary productivity, moisture availability, and temperature.[2]<br>  <br>  Ecoregions are grouped into both biomes and ecozones.<br>  <br>  A fundamental classification of biomes is into:<br>  <br>     1. Terrestrial (land) biomes<br>     2. Freshwater biomes<br>     3. Marine biomes<br>  <br>  Biomes are often known in English by local names. For example, a Temperate grassland or shrubland biome is known commonly as steppe in central Asia, prairie in North America, and pampas in South America. Tropical grasslands are known as savanna in Australia, whereas in Southern Africa it is known as veldt (from Afrikaans).<br>  <br>  Sometimes an entire biome may be targeted for protection, especially under an individual nation's Biodiversity Action Plan.<br>  <br>  Climate is a major factor determining the distribution of terrestrial biomes. Among the important climatic factors are:<br>  <br>      * latitude: Arctic, boreal, temperate, subtropical, tropical.<br>      * humidity: humid, semi-humid, semi-arid, and arid.<br>            o seasonal variation: Rainfall may be distributed evenly throughout the year or be marked by seasonal variations.<br>            o dry summer, wet winter: Most regions of the earth receive most of their rainfall during the summer months; Mediterranean climate regions receive their rainfall during the winter months.<br>      * elevation: Increasing elevation causes a distribution of habitat types similar to that of increasing latitude.<br>  <br>  The most widely used systems of classifying biomes correspond to latitude (or temperature zoning) and humidity. Biodiversity generally increases away from the poles towards the equator and increases with humidity.|`|FiDcOMgxaa	Freshwater  <br>  Marine  <br>  Desert  <br>  Forest  <br>  Grassland  <br>  Tundra <br>  <br>  See this  website also,<br>  <a href="http://www.sciencegeek.net/Biology/Powerpoints/Biomes.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.sciencegeek.net/Biology/Power...</a>

AA10927246	What do you mean by "exact age".  Do you want to figure their age down to the nearest day?  In whole years?  In years and months?<br>  <br>  The basic method is to determine how many years since their birth.  Here you subtract their birth year from the current year.  However, if they haven't yet had a birthday this year, you then subtract 1.<br>  <br>  For example, if someone was born August 20, 1991 you would take:<br>  2009 - 1991 = 18...<br>  But since they haven't had their birthday this year, they are only 17.<br>  <br>  If you want to get into months, you then have to figure out how many months from their birthday to today.   August 20 was 6 months ago which is half a year.<br>  <br>  Answer:<br>  17? years old<br>  or<br>  17 years 6 months<br>  <br>  P.S.  If you are looking to say someone is 17 years, 6 months and 13 days... that's harder.  For one, a month doesn't have a standard number of days, so what does "6 months" really mean?  If they include February, for example, you might get 28 or 29 days instead of 30 or 31 days like other months. There are ways around this if you agree to some assumptions about how you will count months, but it might be equally valid to count them another way.
X8LNbaKQaa	You are not using clear terminology.  There are at least 3 different concepts of pressure measured in PSI.  There is PSIG Pounds per Square Inch, Gauge) which is the pressure compared to atmospheric pressure (the air around a gauge).  There is PSIA (Pounds per Square Inch, Absolute) which is the pressure compared to a perfect vacuum.  There is PSID (Pounds per Square Inch, Differential) which is the pressure difference between two arbitrary pressures.<br>  <br>  So, normal air (the atmosphere at sea level) is 0 PSIG, 14.7 PSIA, and since no second pressure is mentioned, PSID does not apply.<br>  <br>  Any volume of air compressed to half its original size and allowed to cool back to its original temperature, will approximately double its absolute pressure, so it would be at 29.4 PSIA, or 14.7 PSIG.<br>  <br>  -- <br>  Regards,<br>  <br>  John Popelish|`|AA10259042	14.69 pounds per sq inch at sea level.<br>  Boyle's law states PV=C so if the volume decreased by half the pressure must increase by 2.

MJR4Om7taa	You can't, what you actually hear is the blood in your ear rushing around as it normally does, only it's echoed in the shell back into your ear, it just sounds like the sea|`|YpUhEviCaa	There is a popular folk myth that if one holds a seashell—specifically, most often, a conch shell—to one's ear, one can hear the sound of the ocean.<br>  <br>  The rushing sound that one hears is in fact the noise of the surrounding environment, resonating within the cavity of the shell. The same effect can be produced with any resonant cavity, such as an empty cup or even by simply cupping one's hand over one's ear. The similarity of the noise produced by the resonator to that of the oceans is purely accidental.<br>  <br>  The resonator is simply amplifying some frequencies of the ambient noise in the environment, including air flowing within the resonator and sound originating within the human body itself, and attenuating others.<br>  <br>  The human ear picks up sounds made by the human body as well, including the sounds of blood flowing, muscles acting, and even air seeping through ear wax. These sounds are normally discarded by the brain; however, they become more obvious when louder external sounds are filtered out. This occlusion effect occurs with seashells, cups, or hands held over one's ears, and also with circum-aural headphones, whose cups form a seal around the ear, raising the acoustic impedance to external sounds.[1][2][3][4]

CHiEKZrLaa	Hmmm... that depends on what specifically you're trying to achieve.  Niacin will cause a massive release of intracellular histamine, which causes "flushing."  That means that blood rushes into the capillary beds near the skin - you skin will look beet red and will feel warm to the touch, you'll feel tingly/itchy, etc.<br>  <br>  The effect is dose-dependent (higher dose = more intense reaction.)  If you take the same amount of niacin regularly, over the course of a few days you'll deplete the intracellular histamine levels and the flushing effect will go away.<br>  <br>  Now... does this benefit your circulation?  Well it certainly increases blood flow to the skin.  But it won't have any significant, long-term impact on blood pressure, etc.<br>  <br>  Cayenne pepper does have some anti-platelet effects - It makes your blood "less sticky" and can lower blood pressure slightly, etc.  It will also stimulate blood flow to the stomach when you take it (make sure you take the pills with food!)... and that can have positive net effects in the long run, too.<br>  <br>  Hope that's the kind of info you were looking for!|`|0ff5fc1050fef44fd64ce153d56856dfaa	Eat a well balanced diet and exercise.

YWwtiIgTaa	Saturated means that the solute contains as much substance as can possibly dissolve in it. It will be at equilibrium, since the material going to solid and going to solution will equal. Basically it means that no matter how hard you try, you will not dissolve any more solid in your liquid. For example, take sugar and water. You can add sugar and add sugar and add sugar and stir, but at some point no more sugar will dissolve. It stays as a solid at the bottom of the glass. That's a saturated solution.<br>  <br>  Unsaturated means it's not yet to the saturation point. More solid can dissolve in the solution.<br>  <br>  Now for supersaturated, say you throw your water and sugar mixture in the microwave and heat it up. You're shifting the equilibrium point to the right, and so more of the solid sugar will dissolve. In fact, you can probably melt it all! Now if you cool it and you are careful not to bump the container, ll the sugar that dissolved into solution will stay in solution. This is called supersaturation. Basically it wouldn't have happened naturally, but because you changed the temperature more was able to melt. The cool thing about supersaturation is that if you add a "seed", or drop in some extra sugar or otherwise cause a disturbance, you can precipitate the extra sugar out of the solution and go back to a state of saturation.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps!|`|puI30An9aa	Well, if a solution is unsaturated you can dissolve more solute in it.

524f656a521cc9375efb6821b1b2063daa	"Burning" is a result of rapid oxidization.    In that sense, there is not enough oxygen on Jupiter for the atmosphere to "burn".    In fact (this will sound weird, but remember that we are using this strict definition of the word "burn"), there is no oxygen on the Sun.  The gas on the Sun is not burning.    On the Sun, the pressure of the outer layers onto the centre is high enough to trigger nuclear fusion.  This produces energy and this energy heats up all the gas on the Sun.  So hot that it glows in visible light.  But it does not burn, since there is no oxygen.    ---    If you had a planet with the proper mix of flammable gas and oxygen (or any other appropriate oxidant), then the probability of being hit by an asteroid is so high that what you describe would have happened already.    It is difficult to imagine that, in our solar system, such a mix would have survived so long.  So, it the mix did exist, then the "burning" has already taken place.|`|E0U2yII3aa	Raymond pretty said it all already about the "no oxygen thingy" but I'm just gonna add something to it. Do you know that most of the exoplanets they call "Hot Jupiters" reside very close to their parent stars. Instead of "burning" like what we think, the heat and radiation received from the star puffs up the planets to larger sizes thereby making them vulnerable to being "blown away" by the star's winds. The "wind" in turn reduces a planet's mass until there may be no more or until the star itself dies.|`|NzSA6dmyaa	if it has fuel (in the form of gas for this hypothasis) oxegen and heat (added by the meteor) then in theoy yes until one of these 3 things are removed (runs out of fuel oxegen or heat)
Ra5HCf1Baa	I'm a little dubious about the likelihood of an Earth-size-pretty-much planet having a big moon and a small one. In any solar system you're going to get gravitational "jostling" from the central star (not to mention a multiple star system, as a majority are), along with the other planets--especially big ones, of course. Jupiter has had a dramatic effect on our system.|`|E0U2yII3aa	I answered this on the other question. Anyway, here it is again:    "A planet can have as many moons as long it can hold onto them and/or as long as the moons' orbits with respect to other moons in the system are stable coz they can be either freed, kicked out or spiral down into the planet."    Saturn may be large but it is not that massive. It packs less material per cubic unit of space, say compared to Earth or Jupiter. Saturn's averaged density of 0.687g/cm^3 is low compared to water's density of 0.998g/cm^3. In fact, if you have an ocean large enough to put Saturn onto, it would most probably "float."|`|NzSA6dmyaa	depends on the planet, technically an infinite number when u want to ad another moon just add to the mass (thus to the gaviational pull) of the hypothetical planet

To prove this, simply try it blindfolded some time Have an unbiased bystander take notes on what words or letters are selected. Usually, the results will be unintelligible.<br>  <br>  The movement of the planchette is not due to spirits but to unconscious movements by those controlling the pointer. The same kind of unconscious movement is at work in such things as dowsing and facilitated communication.|`|jK9H6PHiaa	i would like to play alone some night, i always used it with someone but you never know if they are moving it or not. when i was young i asked who i would marry and it said josh, the only josh i knew was gay but i am marrying a josh in 5 months, lol.|`|hmsMpECkaa	Cheer up!  For as long as that Ouija Board been around, those spirits ought to know how to use it.|`|iUM1h6Yjaa	Yes I have and the planchette moved around as it was supposed to. But it wasn't a spirit moving it, it was us. Ouija boards are harmless spooky fun. And they make superstitious people look very silly and result in all sorts of ridiculous warnings that I personally find entertaining :) They are a kids game sold at Toys R Us and don't summon anything else than fears, power of suggestion and silly fun. The vast majority who believe the Ouija board is evil, bad, dangerous, etc., are young, usually girls. By the time they reach adulthood most have realized they were just pushing the planchette around themselves, but you can find a few adults who never caught on and still think it's evil or dangerous :) <br>  <br>  Sure you should try it. Here's your chance to get ahead of the game and have some fun with your superstitious friends.|`|AA10962298	Ouija boards tell you what your subconscious wants to tell you.

Yes they do, but they open doors for other things to pass into this world.Things you don't want. I made a beautiful one,and was playing it with the little boy next door. He is at that age where he is curious about those things.We were supposed to be talking with a eight year old little boy from the eighteen hundreds.Suddenly,it started spelling really bad words. Words so bad,they would burn your ears. We knew instantly no little boy would even know those words,so we closed it out. We never played with it again. After that, we turned on an old tape recorder we had. Just playing around, we asked if there were any spirits that wanted to talk. We really weren't expecting anything and really were just playing around,but when we rewound the tape and played it there was a deep voice on it that said---YES-S-S-S! That was enough for us! That really scared all that were there at the time. Don't mess with that stuff,it is true and very dangerous! That wasn't the first time I have played with a board,and I made this one myself. But for some reason a bad spirit took control over it. As for the tape recorder,that was the first time I have ever done that.It really spooked me out. I knew I had ghosts in my house,I've seen them.So have others. But I sure don't like to hear them. That was really scary. Just don't mess with the spirit world,you'll be playing with fire.

But that doesn't mean they are safe at ALL. When people use them they risk talking to things other than spirits..... but demons, which were never alive but are usually summoned in a place by devil worshipers, or if any type of severe sadness or horrid death has taken place near or in that place. Not a good thing to be talking to. You also risk giving it possession over you, they can influence your actions, what you say, and how you feel, which can lead to mental damage, physical damage to you or others, and even death if it goes to far. None of the three of us have used one because we know the danger of it. No I DON'T think at ALL that you should use one... stay away from them, please.

7VcF2pXVaa	Altitudes are perpendicular to a side and intersect the opposite vertex.<br>  <br>  The altitude from A to BC is perpendicular to BC. Since the slope of BC is (4 - 0)/(2 - 5) = -4/3, the slope of the altitude is 3/4. That's because the product of the slopes of perpendicular lines is -1.<br>  <br>  Now, we know the equation of this altitude has the form y = 3x/4 + b, so now we need to find b. To do this, we use the fact that the line passes through A, so we substitute -1 for x and 0 for y:<br>  <br>  0 = 3(-1)/4 + b<br>  b = 3/4<br>  <br>  The equation of the altitude is y = 3x/4 + 3/4. Now, do the same process for another altitude, then find the intersection of the two.
7VcF2pXVaa	Since AB is the x-axis, one of the altitudes is the vertical line through C, that is, x = 2. Find the intersection of that line with another altitude and you have the answer.<br>  <br>  Hint: to get another altitude:<br>  1. find the slope of BC, call it m.<br>  2. take -1/m to get the slope of the perpendicular.<br>  3. write the equation of the line as y = -x/m + b<br>  4. substitute m from step 1 and the coordinates of point A into step 3.<br>  5. solve for b to get the equation of the altitude.<br>  6. find the intersection of x=2 and the equation found in step 5. That will be your answer.<br>  <br>  If you look at my answer to another of your identical questions, I've solved the other line for you, so it should be trivial to do #6 as you just plug in 2 for x.

I can tell you how people came to realize that evolution is much more plausible than creationism.  Before Darwin, the prevailing view was creationism and it had 3 basic tenets:<br>  <br>  (1) All species were created once, and do not change (species are immutable).<br>  (2) Species are unrelated from each other.<br>  (3) The Earth was created recently (young Earth).<br>  <br>  The first one was debunked by the existence of extinct species in the fossil record (which was just beginning to be excavated).  Also if you are interested in how this is incorrect (1), you should look up micro-evolution and macro-evolution.<br>  <br>  The second one can be shown to be false when you look at for example homologous traits (i.e., forelimbs of vertebrates).  Also, examples of transition fossils are actually quite vast, and there is lots of information on that if you look around.  Archeoptryx (sp?) is the famous one for dinosaurs --> birds.<br>  <br>  The third one is very obviously erroneous (they used to believe the Earth was only 6000 years old, and I guess some still do)...radioactive dating (like Carbon-14) shows the Earth to be much, much older, more like 4.6+ billion years old.  Look into uniformitarianism and geology stuff for information on this.<br>  <br>  I encourage you to do some research if you are interested in this topic, and look up anything that you have questions about.

AM69WT7Eaa	(Ecology is sometimes used incorrectly as a synonym for the natural environment or environmentalism.)     Ecology is essentially the study of the Earth's organisms and their relationships with their abiotic and biotic environments.Ecology or ecological science, is the scientific study of the distribution and abundance of living organisms and how these properties are affected by interactions between the organisms and their environment. The environment of an organism includes both the physical properties, which can be described as the sum of local abiotic factors like climate and geology, as well as the other organisms that share its habitat.    Ecology may be more simply defined as the relationship between living organisms and their abiotic and biotic environment or as "the study of the structure and function of nature" (Odum 1971). In this later case, structure includes the distribution patterns and abundance of organisms, and function includes the interactions of populations, including competition, predation, symbiosis, and nutrient and energy cycles.    The term ecology (oekologie) was coined in 1866 by the German biologist Ernst Haeckel. The word is derived from the Greek oikos ("household," "home," or "place to live") and logos ("study")therefore, "ecology" means the "study of the household of nature." The name is derived from the same root word as economics (management of the household), and thus ecology is sometimes considered the economics of nature, or, as expressed by Ernst Haeckel, "the body of knowledge concerning the economy of nature" (Smith 1996).    The interactions between living organisms and their abiotic and biotic environments, the focus of ecology, generally convey an overall sense of unity and harmony in nature. See for instance, species interactions. On the other hand, the history of the science itself has often revealed conflicts, schisms, and opposing camps, as ecologists took different approaches and often failed  Ecology is usually considered a branch of biology, the general science that studies living and once-living organisms. Organisms can be studied at many different levels, from proteins and nucleic acids (in biochemistry and molecular biology), to cells (in cellular biology), to multicellular systems (in physiology and anatomy, to individuals (in botany, zoology, and other similar disciplines), and finally at the level of populations, communities, and ecosystems, and to the biosphere as a whole. These latter strata, from populations to the biosphere, are the primary subjects of ecological inquiries.       The complexity of the subject of ecological studies can be see in this river in South America, which is part of the world's largest wetland, the Pantanal.Ecology is a multi-disciplinary science. Because of its focus on the higher levels of the organization of life on earth and on the interrelations between organisms and their environment, ecology draws heavily on many other branches of science, especially geology and geography, meteorology, pedology, chemistry, and physics. Thus, ecology is said to be a holistic science, one that overarches older disciplines, such as biology, which in this view become sub-disciplines contributing to ecological knowledge.    Agriculture, fisheries, forestry, medicine, and urban development are among human activities that would fall within Krebs' (1972: 4) explanation of his definition of ecology: "where organisms are found, how many occur there, and why."    The term ecology is sometimes confused with the term environmentalism. Environmentalism is a social movement aimed at the goal of protecting natural resources or the environment, and which may involve political lobbying, activism, education, and so forth. Ecology is the science that studies living organisms and their interactions with the environment. As such, ecology involves scientific methodology and does not dictate what is "right" or "wrong." However, findings in ecology may be used to support or counter various goals, assertions, or actions of environmentalists.    Consider the ways an ecologist might approach studying the life of honeybees:    The behavioral relationship between individuals of a species is behavioral ecologyfor example, the study of the queen bee, and how she relates to the worker bees and the drones.   The organized activity of a species is community ecology; for example, the activity of bees assures the pollination of flowering plants. Bee hives additionally produce honey, which is consumed by still other species, such as bears.   The relationship between the environment and a species is environmental ecologyfor example, the consequences of environmental change on bee activity. Bees may die out due to environmental changes. The environment simultaneously affects and is a consequence of this activity and is thus intertwined with the survival of the species.     Disciplines of ecology  Ecology is a broad science which can be subdivided into major and minor

AA10335036	It's called resonantly enhanced conservation of angular momentum. How's that? Her arm oscillates horizontally about the shoulder, which requires a yaw torque at the shoulder. Since there is some flexibility in her connection to the floor, the reaction torque causes the rest of her body to oscillate in opposite yaw rotation. Parts of the body respond to the oscillation frequency, either resonantly such that they oscillate with a larger amplitude than the body as a whole, or antiresonantly in opposite phase to the body. Either way these parts are seen to oscillate with respect to the body.<br>  P.S. Don't tell her that she should brush up-and-down, or worse yet, get an electric toothbrush.

Is that a school project? tell me what sort of project scope u looking for i could give u a better idea    Basically as I answered in another question here are the areas which you can consider    There are many many different applications areas, including but definitely not limited to the followings:    1. Medical management system. Patients, drugs, food, equipment, medical waste, medical personnel can be managed in real time. Hospital management would be able to track exactly what is going on with the above items and how they being treated/used.    2. Library or book store. A very common place where people and search, sort and do stock take easily.    3. Fashion industry. From manufacturer to store front to VIP management the whole supply chain can be managed, analyzed and optimized.    4. Vehicle management. Parking, access control, location tracking etc can be realized.    5. Prison management. Managing of inmates.    6. Underground mine worker management.    7. Waste management. Waste can be handled by weight rather than a flat rate.    8. Public transport payment. Like the most successful RFID implement in Hong Kong the Octopus system can be used for paying public transports as well as vending machines, parking, fast food shops etc.    9. Asset tracking. Physical assets have tag attached for tracking and audit purposes.    10. Security. such as access control, attendance register, anti-thief system.    11. Laundry garment management. The whole process can be monitored and automated.    12. fast payment checkout system. No need to scan bar code anymore.    13. Tracking documents such as court orders, traffic fine notice etc    14. anything other things u could imagine    we have more details explanations for some of the above areas in our website http://www.macroware-it.com if you are interested.
qaMPEdL2aa	Only a few psi would be needed to get some water to flow if the house and the pump are at the same level.  If the house is higher than the pump you would need about 1 more psi for every 2 ft of elevation difference.  At 40 psi you should have good water flow.    15 minutes is way too long if everything were working properly.     Your pump may need to be primed.  That is you must add water to it to get it to start pumping.  You don't say what type of pump it is.  Is there only one pipe from the well to the pump or are there two?    Two pipes would indicate that you have a jet pump.  It pumps water down one pipe.  There is a venturi at the bottom of the well that sucks in water and brings it up the other pipe.  This type of pump needs to be primed.    You may also have frozen water in the line between the pump and the house.    Your water level in the well may be below the intake in which case you are only pumping air. Do you hear air coming out when you open the faucets?  If not, ice blockage somewhere is likely.    Is there a valve at the bottom of the tank that you can open to see what comes out?  There should be a cushion of air at the top of the tank so that the pump does not need to run all the time that water is flowing.  The pump runs until the pressure reaches some level, say 40 psi, the pump shuts off and the air cushion continues to force water out an open faucet until the pressure drops to say 20 psi at which point the pump would turn on again.|`|N0UUmjDlaa	You need to know the relative heights of the house and "tank". I am assuming the house is higher.  Is this "tank" actually holding the water? It just sounds like an accumulator to me.. where is the water originating from? Is it being pumped from a ground well?  Just because a pressure gauge is graduated to 100 does not mean needing 100 psi to do the job.  An accumulator is a "storage" device that allows the pump to stop pumping when the pressure rises, and not allow restart until the pressure drops below a set lower pressure.  It also smooths out any pulsations caused by the pump.

Since it's very close to its opposition to the Earth, it's best around midnight local time wherever you're located. It's moving pretty quickly, so you'll need a current chart to find it, as it's not very bright. Binoculars are a real help.

Astronauts on the shuttle or the Space Station experience a full cycle of night and day every 1.5 hours, so they ignore it and stay on Houston time. Astronauts on the Moon didn't notice any real change in the short time they were on the surface, since a lunar day is 29 Earth days long. Again, they would stay on local time. The most interesting situation was during the early days of the Mars rovers. There were two teams at JPL controlling the two rovers, which were located on opposite sides of Mars. Each team lived on the Martian day, rather than the Earth day, which is 37 minutes longer.

BrarMA1Haa	The general form of a sinusoidal frequency (with zero phase angle) is<br>  A*sin(2*pi*f*t), where f is the frequency.<br>  In your case, the part inside the parentheses is (t * pi/2).<br>  By setting the two equal to each other, you can solve for frequency f:<br>  2*pi*f*t = t*pi/2<br>  f = t*pi/(2*2*pi*t)<br>  f = 1/4 Hz<br>  If you modulate a carrier frequency (fc) by mixing it with the above frequency, the output of the mixer will be both the sum and difference frequencies:<br>  fc + 1/4Hz, and<br>  fc - 1/4Hz<br>  The first frequency is called the upper sideband.  The second frequency is called the lower sideband.  If you transmit both of those frequencies, it is called Double Side Band (DSB).  If you filter out one or the other, then it is called either Upper Side Band, or Lower Side Band.<br>  <br>  The bandwidth taken up DSB is the difference between the upper and lower sidebands, or:<br>  <br>  (fc + 1/4Hz) - (fc - 1/4Hz) = 2/4Hz = 1/2Hz<br>  <br>  Or in other words, the bandwidth utilized by double side band is twice the bandwidth of the original signal.<br>  <br>  Your answer says B=0.5kHz.

MV1DPvHGaa	Elements in the upper right corner of the periodic table have high effective nuclear charges. This makes their neutral atoms in the ground state the smallest of any on the periodic table.

P4cvrMxgaa	Both are benzodiazepines, which are medications used to treat seizures and anxiety disorders, among other things.  The differences between benzodiazepines is usually how long they take to work, how long they remain in your system, and how they are metabolized.  Lorazepam is more potent than Valium and has mostly inactive metabolites.  Lorazepam may also stay in your system longer, which could be good or bad due to its sedating effect.|`|0ff5fc1050fef44fd64ce153d56856dfaa	I've had lorazepam. It just makes you sleepy.

wDMWkYUcaa	If there were no friction, the box's speed would be greater at the bottom than at the top. With friction, the box's speed does not change.<br>  <br>  Work = Efinal - Einitial<br>  Work = Ek - (Ek + Eg)<br>  Work = - Eg<br>  <br>  Friction does - 392 J.<br>  <br>  The work-energy theorem states that the work done by all forces is equal to the change in kinetic energy of the system. Since the kinetic energy does not change, the total work done by all forces is 0.<br>  <br>  Also, since the crate is moving at a constant speed, there is no acceleration. This means the net force is 0, so the net work is 0, since work = net force * displacement. The force of gravity parallel to the incline equals the force of friction. The two forces act in opposite directions, so the result is a 0 net force.

92f97d29e3d55f3219cc25dfabd347c7aa	That's a lot of questions.<br>  <br>  In an atom, the electrons are bound to the nucleus (which may be just a proton in H1) by electrostatic attraction.  Opposite charges attract one another.  One old model of the atom (which is semi-useful) is that the electrons orbit the nucleus like planets in a solar system.  Electrons and protons can interact in a bound system (like a solar system) or an unbound system (like a one-time comet swooping by and away).  It's the same interaction either way.  As for the protons and neutrons in the nucleus, they are bound together by the strong interaction.  Protons and neutrons are composed of strongly bound quarks.  Electrons are not made of quarks.  And they aren't contained in the nucleus.  They may occasionally visit, but the electrostatic attraction isn't nearly strong enough to keep them bound in such a small place.  As best we can tell, they are fundamental, point-like particles.  Consciousness doesn't really seem to have anything to do with an atom.  It does what it does irrespective of whether you are watching it.<br>  <br>  That was a lot of questions, so I really couldn't go into any depth on any of them.

j7hLlnGIaa	The first solution assumes one very incorrect thing:<br>  Probability is _not_ something that simply compounds like that.  Also, not to pick apart an answer, but if you consider all of the possible outcomes, the probability must sum up to 1.  In other words, if you have a 400% chance of failure, that shouldn't make any sense.  And saying "it's 400% chance of failure, and 100% chance of success, thus 20% chance overall" is not a proper justification.<br>  <br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  So, now to the question at hand.  You have 5 tries, and you want the probability that you will have at least one success.  Well, here's the quickest solution (and it is really quick).<br>  <br>  So note that "at least one success" and "no successes" are disjoint choices (i.e. you can't have at least one success and no successes in the same experiment), and these two choices actually cover _all_ possibilities.<br>  <br>  Now, P(at least one success) + P(no successes) = 1 (this is just the definition of a probability "measure" if you will)<br>  <br>  So P(at least one success) = 1 - P(no successes)<br>  <br>  For each trial (each of which are independent), the probability of a failure is 4/5.  So the probability of 5 consecutive failures is<br>  (4/5)^5<br>  <br>  So the probability of at least one success is<br>  1 - (4/5)^5 = 2101/3125<br>  <br>  And that's your final answer, in the shortest way I could think of.<br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  <br>  Actually, the answer above me got it dead on, because if you stop after you succeed, there's a bit more to this problem, because you are only interested in results of the form<br>  _S___...The assumptions greatly change this problem...|`|gVr7joOkaa	it's 1/5 chance everytime you spin or whatever you do <br>  <br>  <br>  so overall you have  5/5 chance out of ALL of the tries to get that event<br>  <br>  A 7th grader helps another once more<br>  <br>  <br>  example:<br>  Trial #1     20%(1/5) <br>  Trial #2     20%(1/5)<br>  Trial #3     20%(1/5)<br>  Trial #4     20%(1/5)<br>  Trial #5     20%(1/5)     <br>  All together it equals 100% which should be  and 5/5(100%)<br>  And with a 400%(cause it's 80% you wont so multiply 80 with "5" trials) that you wont get it SOO its<br>  <br>  100/400 make it smaller to get"1/4"<------(answer)<br>  <br>  1/4 to a percent is .25... 25%|`|1jxHczQgaa	you only have one case where there are no 'successes', five fails in a row<br>  so, what is the probability that happens?<br>  well .8 ^ 5 or 80% five times<br>  that is .32768<br>  so the probability it does happens is 1 - .32768 = .67232

d508e71226a169afed7ebfc7e78bbc5baa	Well it depends on what kind of test it is.  If it is a pee test just get your sister to give you some of hers in a baggy and take it with you, if it is a blood test, just load up on water and b-12 (this may not help but at least you will be on a legal high) and if it is a hair test don't shave your head or anything, there are more parts of the body they can RIP one from.  And if they do a hair test, you sir are screwed.  Best thing to to and I promise that you can pass any drug test that they can come up with is to NOT TAKE DRUGS STUPID|`|fi3HRxABaa	be clean...cus kids, drugs are bad mmmmkay!|`|kts0LgPHaa	lol you could NOT take drugs in the first place but if you already messed up, drink alot of water. like ALOT.

I will first tell you that alot of people are going to give you advice that you can get a drug out of your system by various methods but I can promise you that none of them work I have my clients try them on me all the time and they are always detected and they fail the test.  I am also a recovering addict and I tried then all at one time and they never ever worked.  So it doesnt matter how much water you drink, or taking niacon.  Those over the counter things that they sell at the vitamin stores do not work, and neither does putting bleach in your urine.  <br>       So back to the drug testing, if you will be taking a urine test then that is the fastest method of drug testing.  If you used heroin, cocaine, crack, ecstacy then it will be out of your urine in about 7 days.  If you did marijuana then it takes longer it is about 10- 12 days.  The same for the mouth swab tests.  If you are given a blood test then it takes about 30 days for the opiates cocaine, crack, and for marijuana it takes up to 60 days.  If you are given a hair follicle test then it could take years.  <br>  <br>       So that is the best advice I couls give you, if you have any questions then please let me know and feel free to e mail me.|`|p2brbBOeaa	Don't go there.

M1 can be the concentration of the acid, the analyte, and V1 the volume of the acid, in this case it would be HNO3. M2 is the concentration of the titrant, LiOH, and V2 is the volume, which we are looking for. <br>  <br>  To find the concentration of HNO3, you have to recognize that it is a strong acid, so it will dissociate into H+ and NO3- completely. Thus if you can find the concentration of H+, this will give you the concentration of HNO3 becuase they are in a one-to-one ratio. <br>  <br>  Take the anti-log of the negative pH to find the concentration of H+. ( [H+] = 10^-3.46 = 3.47 x 10^-4 M). Now you know M1. V1 is 0.067 L (67.0 ml). Now solve for V2 = M1V1/M2. And you should get 1.55 ml. Hope this helps.

This fluid resides in the interstitial space, which is the empty space between cells in the body. It consists of water, materials like oxygen, carbon dioxide, glucose, amino acids, etc. The only materials that are not present in the fluid are plasma proteins and blood cells. The materials, inclusive of water are forced into the interstitial space due to the high hydrostatic pressure at the arteriole end of the capillaries. It is from the interstitial fluid that some cells get their nutrients from.

I'm going to hazard a guess and say that if you're taking 1mg of lorazepam each night, you're taking it for insomnia and not anxiety problems? If it's for anxiety, you absolutely must see your doctor before you make any changes at all to your dosage.<br>  <br>  I heavily recommend (as does the consumer medication information that should come with your first box of the product) that you see your doctor before making any changes for medication like this. Seeing as it's a simple question, you should be able to call the doctor up on the phone about the issue. Your doctor may know something that you don't (and I don't) about the medication that means you may not be able to split the tablet, or reduce your dosage at this point in time. Also, should you end up in hospital and your GP hasn't got current information about your dosage, you may not get the treatment you could have if they knew you were only on a half dosage.<br>  <br>  If you are really against seeing your doctor, at least see your local qualified pharmacist. They should be able to tell you whether it is safe to split the tablets.<br>  <br>  If you are absolutely not going to take either of those suggestions, don't split the tablet if there is no groove running up the middle of the tablet (indicating that it is a splitable tablet).

rM6gBb2baa	Ask yourself why a person would subject themselves to the years of hard work it takes to get into a medical school, followed by 4 years of extremely hard work at medical school, followed by a minimum of 3 years of more extremely hard work in internship and residency if they don't care.  Some might say doctors get into it for the money, but trust me, if money is the goal it ceases to drive the individual by the 3rd year in undergraduate studies.  And even if there is the rare person pursuing money, they won't make any real cash until over a decade after they get out of college.  <br>  <br>  Doctors care deeply about their patients.  It's true that they try to distance themselves, but the death of any patient will generally have an effect on the doctor.|`|AA11432707	We actually care quite a lot.  We're trained to act professional, but that doesn't mean we don't have feelings.<br>  <br>  Death is inevitable.  Sometimes it is a release from suffering.  It is often much better than lingering in a hospital with tubes in every orifice, trying to stave off what will eventually happen anyway.<br>  <br>  Each of us has been shaken by deaths that were unexpected or particularly tragic.  I still get sad thinking about premature triplets that died a few minutes after delivery.  They were so tiny and perfect, just too little to live.<br>  <br>  What do you expect from physicians?

Of course we want our patients to do well, and are often quite harsh with ourselves or other doctors when mistakes are made, but we also recognize that everyone dies, and sometimes it's just a patient's time.|`|vVfH8yBYaa	Perhaps it depends on the doctor, but for the most part it's been my experience that they care.<br>  <br>  It also depends on how involved they are with a particular patient. The foot doctor you saw once for a bunion probably isn't even going to remember you, but your oncologist - for instance - will care. I assure you.|`|0ff5fc1050fef44fd64ce153d56856dfaa	They wouldn't be doctors if they didn't care about people.|`|chhZOo8oaa	I'm not a doctor, but I think I have a fairly good idea as I know a whole bunch of people who work in hospitals.<br>  <br>  When I worked as a pharmacy assistant (prescription counter), there were elderly customers who would come in almost every day for medications. They used to talk to us all the time, keeping us up to date about special happenings in their lives (or every day things). In the years I was working as a pharmacy assistant, I lost 7 dear regular customers, and "lost" 3 to dementia. I didn't "know" these people per say, but it was very painful when they died. I still miss some of them, years later.<br>  <br>  I have witnessed (and heard of) Doctors (surgeons) refusing to do surgery on patients who have no chance of surviving the operation. They would much rather the patient dies in a 'dignified' manner, with their family around, then have them die traumatically, opened up on an operating table. That to me tells me that they are affected by their patient dying.<br>  <br>  My dad's been in the fire brigade for 20+ years. He's seen a lot of people die (from car accidents more often than fires). He tells me that while he's actually there, he sees the task at hand. The person becomes 'the job' until they are safe. If someone dies in front of him, he's in a 'work' state of mind, and is still able to carry on with necessary duties. This is unless that person's family member is running around in circles screaming and crying. That makes the job much more stressful, and the reality of what's going on  hits home. Anyway, this is what he's like at work. But when he gets home, it definitely dawns on him. There was one particularly bad car accident where 4 teenage girls died. He tried to CPR one girl while waiting for the ambos to arrive, but she was too far gone. Years later, those girls still haunt his thoughts, because they looked so much like my sister, me and our friends.<br>  <br>  <br>  So maybe the short answer is, you're numbers at work, and people once they get home?|`|FrB3sGnwaa	thats a good question. doctors are taught to not get attatched to their patients just in case the worst happens, but i think they still care.

gTDzR23jaa	well, you can figure out the (n-4)/n = 1-(4/n)<br>  As n increases, "1-(4/n) gets closer to one, so it gets bigger, even though it does have to be multiplied by itself more times, and because it is less than one, it might actually get smaller.  But just think, if n was infinity, 4/n would be 0, and 1^infinity is 1, which is greater than any decimal, so as n increases, that big thing in parentheses on the right gets closer to one.  Which means that as n gets bigger, the value of the expression gets smaller, and its limit is one.<br>  I hope I wasn't too confusing! ;)|`|LVPNuEsLaa	b. 0
k5Ece8BTaa	No.<br>  <br>  This scam about the world ending in 2012 isn't true. It's all just a silly hoax. It maybe true that that mayan calendar ends but, it doesn't mean the world is going to end. One of several Mayan calendars is the Long Count calendar, which is reset to day 0 every 1,872,000 days or 7057.5 years. The next reset date, by some calculations, is December 21, 2012. This is not a prediction of the end of the world. The Mayan Calendar has to end sometime. Besides, nobody can't predict when the end of the world is. You shouldn't always believe what you hear from other people. The scientific evidence about 2012 doesn't go together. Those who spread rumors about 2012 should be punished. You know what is sad, people may commit suicide over this thinking its the end of the world. Or maybe some people would get unwise with their money and spend it all like crazy and be in thousands of dollars in debt, just because they thought the world would end. Then they have to pay it off later and deal with the stress of those bills. That's why those who spread rumors about 2012 should be punished. You know what else is false about this 2012 garbage? <br>  <br>  ? Planet X (Nibiru) isn't going to hit the Earth it doesn't exist.<br>  ? Poles are switching everyday, this isn't going to happen all in just 1 day. This process takes thousands of years. Throughout geological history there has been may pole switches and life has still survived.<br>  ? Also people are saying these poles will switch in one day due to a black hole. That's NOT true. The nearest black hole to our galaxy is 1600 light years away.<br>  ? Sun will be lined up with a sunspot, but it doesn't mean it will wipe out all life on Earth. One time ago, Earth was lined up with a sunspot and people were on it and everybody didn't just die.<br>  ? There is not going to be catasphoic earthquakes. <br>  ? No coment will hit Earth or asteriods.<br>  ? These cultures such as the Japanese, Mayans, Japanese or whoever didn't predict such a thing. As I just said, this is just a scam to make money off of ignorant people who don't look at the facts.<br>  ? If you have been watching the Hysteria Chanel about 2012 or anything like that, all they are just trying to do is scare people so they can make money.<br>  <br>  Each time the end the world is predicted. They are always wrong. Here are all the predictions of when the world would end and each time they where wrong. Every year there is a prediction like this. I'm sure that if 2012 doesn't happen, they will think of something else. Through out history the end has been predicted but has never happened.|`|xZwwb3kVaa	Of  course not, but will do if some idiot decides to blow us all up, and there is plenty of those about on this Planet.|`|AA12108882	I will be really glad when 2012 has come and gone and this stupid rubbish will be laid to rest.

If you are truly saved you cannot lose it.<br>  John 10:28  And I give unto them eternal life; and they shall never perish, neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand.<br>  This tells us that if you are not save you cannot go to heaven. That shows people do die and go to hell. People today believe they can live however that feel and still go to heaven. This is a lie straight from the bottom of hell and Satan. Why is this so important? The reason is. The Lord will be coming back very soon. I know people have been saying that many years. I also know many believe it will not happen till the year of 2012.<br>  In some why they are right but first you have to know what Candler they are using. The Candler we us today is not the same candle they used to use. There is a big different. The new Candler that we use today is a few years off.

There are actually two prominent antichrist beasts, the first beast of Revelation 13:1 “And I stood upon the sand of the sea, and saw a beast rise up out of the sea, having seven heads and ten horns, and upon his horns ten crowns, and upon his heads the name of blasphemy.” And the second beast listed in Revelation 13:11-17, which we will look at shortly.<br>  <br>  Revelation 4:7  And the first beast was like a lion, and the second beast like a calf, and the third beast had a face as a man, and the fourth beast was like a flying eagle.<br>  Translation First one is like a Lion which is England.<br>  The second is like calf which is Turkey <br>  The third is like a face of man which is France.<br>  The fourth is like eagle.

The Lord said this generation will not pass.<br>  Matthew 24:34  Verily I say unto you, This generation shall not pass, till all these things be fulfilled.<br>  It is talking about Israel and when it became a state.

ejodXS5naa	It all depends on how it happens and what happens.  If a car roles over your foot, you will have been 'crushed' by a 2000 pound object, but you would obviously not die.  In fact, a cars have rolled directly over people's bodies and  they were able to get up and walk away from it with no harm done.  On the other hand, other people have been killed by it.  It depends on where it hits you, how hard it is, how hard the ground is, whether or not you are expecting it, how strong you are, how big you are, and, probably, how lucky you are.  So I could totally see someone getting hit or stuck under a 1 ton object and surviving it.  None the less, that guy was certainly lucky to have lived.|`|8Y7LQ6TGaa	you can possibly withstand the pressure of 2000 lbs, but if it is moving at the time, as you imply, and at any speed, then the momentum of the moving rock will crush him.<br>  <br>  But if it were gently lowered, and made contact over a large part of his body, with lots of padding, and removed before he could suffocate, he should be OK. <br>  <br>  Look at G forces.

My brother died, after 1800 pounds fell on him. And it wasnt from a far height, they were ground level, and basically fell like dominoes, on his body and pinned him. According to the medical examiner, it was impossible for him to survive. The pressure caused him to pass out within a minute of the fall, and he passed away within a few minutes of that. So..... No. I dont believe it is possible. People that lie about things like this make me angry.

So we'll assume buddy travels 120 miles to work at 40 mph, so it takes him three hours. Buddy then travels 120 miles back home at 60 mph, so it takes him only two hours.<br>  <br>  Total travel time is five hours. Total distance 240 miles. 240 / 5 = 48.

In what follows, I'll use G\e to mean the subgraph of G formed by removing edge e.<br>  <br>  (<=) Suppose e is not a bridge.  Then G\e is connected, so consider a spanning tree of G\e.  Note that this tree is also a spanning tree of G, which doesn't contain e.<br>  <br>  (=>) Let e be a bridge and let T be a spanning tree of G such that e doesn't belong to T.  Then T is a spanning tree of the disconnected graph G\e (that should spotlight the contradiction).|`|OKu0R13eaa	Fact: Every edge in a tree is a bridge (and upon removal of an edge the tree breaks into 2 trees) <br>  A Bridge is an edge whose removal disconnects the graph OR increases the number of components<br>  <br>  Fact:Between any 2 vertices there is a unique path.  <br>  <br>  Proof: If there are 2 paths (ie. 2 edges) between vertices a cycle is created.

545ba20ba4d95ae518de51c1f26b49efaa	Hi there!<br>  <br>  The atomic radius is important for the periodically related concept of electronegativity and electropositivity - as well as bonding on the whole.<br>  <br>  As you descend a group (Group 1 for instance) the number of shells in each atom increases and as such the atomic radius increases too. The atoms in group one have just one electron in its outermost shell and the larger the atomic radius, the weaker the attraction between nucleus and outermost electron. Therefore, this electron is easily taken by the halogens of group 17. So, as you descend group 1, the atomic radius increases, the ionisation energy needed to "take" the bonding electrons decreases and the more reactive the element.  The converse is true of group 17, as you descend the group and the atomic radius increases, the electronegativity of the atom decreases and has less attractive power. Fluorine is the most electronegative element, this is because it has a small atomic radius and the positive nucleus is more powerful as it is less shielded.

The bases are 4 and 10, so the longer base is 6 longer than the shorter base.  The fact that it is an isosceles trapezoid means the two sides are the same length.  Since the base angle on one side is 45 degrees, the base angle on the other side is also 45 degrees.  The longer base is 6 longer than the shorter base, divide by 2 to get the length of the "extension" on either end. So, you have a base of length 10 divided into a section that is 3, a section that is 6, and a section that is 3. The 45 degree base angle means the height of the trapezoid is the same as the "extension" on the end, or 3.  You have a triangle with legs 3 and 3 on one end of the trapezoid, a rectangle with sides 4 and 3 in the middle, and a triangle with legs 3 and 3 on the other end of the trapezoid.  The area is (3*3)/2 + 3*4 + (3*3)/2 = 9+12 = 21.
lbyoCu38aa	Although a few do get paid, it often is not enough to even cover expenses. Most chasers don't get paid at all and chasing storms should be considered nothing more than a hobby.<br>  <br>  They do it for their own satisfaction and their interest in weather in general and thunderstorms in particular. A few people do earn money by being hired for funded projects usually by the government or by university research programs. The pay is generally very low and those that are hired are normally experienced chasers.  <br>  <br>  A few other people have formed companies who take people on storm chasing trips for profit. No guarantee the trip will actually include a sighting of a tornado. If my experience is any indication, less than 1 out of about 10 chases would see a severe storm let alone a tornado. <br>  <br>  Others have sold film and pictures of storms for profit but it has to be a rather unusual or event that has a very high interest nationally. <br>  <br>  There are some that do it for a thrill, which scares me since they often are not careful and put themselves and others at risk.<br>  <br>  Nearly all chasers I know, and I know quite a few, have a regular job that is often completely separate from the meteorology field. <br>  <br>  I do not know of any TV stations that actually hire chasers either. Most chasers that are affiliated with a TV station are either volunteers or work for the TV station in another capacity such as a cameraman or reporter.<br>  <br>  In short, it is difficult to make a living just by storm chasing.|`|WVAd2l7Xaa	I didn't read what anyone else said (at least yet), but unless you're doing work for a university or something, no one is going to pay you.<br>  <br>  The question you should ask yourself is this, "Who and why would someone pay me to chase storms?"|`|zGSfHdvYaa	well, i think most of them work for universities or local places that involve weather and such. the storm chasing helps with their experiments and such and it can be a hobby too.|`|Oe7UwvNPaa	i think they are paid because if there is a severe storm going on, the chasers would get paid to chase it down...? im only guessing.|`|bS6RPi9saa	i wonder that but i dont think it can be possible but  idk cuz how can they pay for the stuff|`|wIdpZtrlaa	Storm chasing is mainly a hobby but you could get paid. There are storm chase expeditions. If you want to lead one, you have to make sure you can show your fellow storm chasers tornadoes so they feel they got their money's worth. That's the only time I can think of a storm chaser getting paid, other than that, it's a hobby. When I get my permit back, I'll begin storm chasing with my camcorder in major hurricanes, hopefully the eye wall of a category 5 hurricane or getting close to an F5 tornado. I'm addicted to severe weather. Stormchasers mostly film for their own excitement and footage. I enjoy a good storm which is why I ejoy filming these storms.

The plant gets no benefit for itself from producing a flower (as opposed to leaves which can be used for photosynthesis to make food), although it must expend energy to do so.  By switching to sexual reproduction in times where conditions are less favorable, it increases the genetic variability of the offspring, so that some might be more able to survive changing conditions where the parent might not.<br>  <br>  ADDED  Apparently, so can some sharks:  <a href="http://www.livescience.com/animals/081010-shark-virgin.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.livescience.com/animals/08101...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2008/10/10/tech/main4513214.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2008/10/1...</a><br>  <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/story?id=3203684" rel="nofollow">http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/story?id=32036...</a>|`|AA10306863	A Komodo dragon can, if it doesn't have to be a plant.|`|dd18fe5fe334f2e74538127bc72c5500aa	i'm pretty sure that bees do. asexual produces females sexual produces males. also any bacteria that turns into spores. the spores are half the genetic material and when they combine they come out of dormancy or something like that|`|btyIVGSqaa	None, only one or the other

Once past the event horizon the speghettification process will begin.<br>  <br>  Many people falsely believe that speghettification is merely stretching out. On all massive bodies, the force of gravity is greater on something closer than something further away. On a black hole, this principle is magnified by the intensity of the gravitational pull of the black hole. When you pass the event horizon, gravity begins to pull at your feet much stronger than it does at you head, therefore pulling you apart. The first time it is in half, then those pieces get pulled in two. On and on it goes until either you enter the black hole, or your molecular structure is entirely unrecognizable.<br>  <br>  <br>  The theory of the white hole is simply that a black hole rips a hole in space.<br>  <br>  All bodies with mass put a small dent in space. the closer you are, the greater the pull. It is believed by some that a super-massive black hole is so massive that it will literally tear a hole in space. The white hole is the supposed "other side", being a place that, if you survived the black hole, it would propel you across time as well as space. But this happening, you would more than likely be in a "parallel universe" (being on the other side of the space-time continuum).<br>  <br>  <br>  I hope I answered you questions, e-mail me if you want to talk

YpUhEviCaa	Each year about 8 mm (0.3 inch) of water from the entire surface of the oceans falls into the Antarctica and Greenland ice sheets as snowfall. If no ice returned to the oceans, sea level would drop 8 mm every year. To a first approximation, the same amount of water appeared to return to the ocean in icebergs and from ice melting at the edges. Scientists previously had estimated which is greater, ice going in or coming out, called the mass balance, important because it causes changes in global sea level. High-precision gravimetry from satellites in low-noise flight has since determined Greenland is losing millions of tons per year, in accordance with loss estimates from ground measurement.<br>  <br>  Ice shelves float on the surface of the sea and, if they melt, to first order they do not change sea level. Likewise, the melting of the northern polar ice cap which is composed of floating pack ice would not significantly contribute to rising sea levels. Because they are fresh, however, their melting would cause a very small increase in sea levels, so small that it is generally neglected. It can however be argued that if ice shelves melt it is a precursor to the melting of ice sheets on Greenland and Antarctica[citation needed].<br>  <br>      * Scientists previously lacked knowledge of changes in terrestrial storage of water. Surveying of water retention by soil absorption and by reservoirs outright ("impoundment") at just under the volume of Lake Superior agreed with a dam-building peak in the 1930s-1970s timespan. Such impoundment masked tens of millimeters of sea level rise in that span. (Impact of Artificial Reservoir Water Impoundment on Global Sea Level  B. F. Chao,* Y. H. Wu, Y. S. Li).<br>      * If small glaciers and polar ice caps on the margins of Greenland and the Antarctic Peninsula melt, the projected rise in sea level will be around 0.5 m. Melting of the Greenland ice sheet would produce 7.2 m of sea-level rise, and melting of the Antarctic ice sheet would produce 61.1 m of sea level rise.[10] The collapse of the grounded interior reservoir of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet would raise sea level by 5-6 m.[11]<br>      * The snowline altitude is the altitude of the lowest elevation interval in which minimum annual snow cover exceeds 50%. This ranges from about 5,500 metres above sea-level at the equator down to sea level at about 70° N&S latitude, depending on regional temperature amelioration effects. Permafrost then appears at sea level and extends deeper below sea level polewards.<br>      * As most of the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets lie above the snowline and/or base of the permafrost zone, they cannot melt in a timeframe much less than several millennia; therefore it is likely that they will not, through melting, contribute significantly to sea level rise in the coming century. They can, however, do so through acceleration in flow and enhanced iceberg calving.<br>      * Climate changes during the 20th century are estimated from modelling studies to have led to contributions of between –0.2 and 0.0 mm/yr from Antarctica (the results of increasing precipitation) and 0.0 to 0.1 mm/yr from Greenland (from changes in both precipitation and runoff).<br>      * Estimates suggest that Greenland and Antarctica have contributed 0.0 to 0.5 mm/yr over the 20th century as a result of long-term adjustment to the end of the last ice age.<br>  <br>  The current rise in sea level observed from tide gauges, of about 1.8 mm/yr, is within the estimate range from the combination of factors above[12] but active research continues in this field. The terrestrial storage term, thought to be highly uncertain, is no longer positive, and shown to be quite large.<br>  <br>  Since 1992 a number of satellites have been recording the change in sea level;[note 1][13][14] they display an acceleration in the rate of sea level change,[note 2] but they have not been operating for long enough to work out whether this is a real signal, or just an artefact of short-term variation.|`|f7CufkSyaa	its already happening. try watch the discovery channel!! there was a show about this island in the pacific where the people used to be able to walk to the other side of the island but now they have to go by boat. and they were showing how when the tide comes up their church is like two feet from the water but so many years ago it was really far away from the water. it was all about the global warming and how the ocean levels are already rising  !!|`|Oe7UwvNPaa	yes because the melted ice will turn into water and the ocean levels will rise|`|RtIbnlcpaa	yes|`|SYKGIiQkaa	Yes, most of the earth will be flooded, if not all.|`|wzCJNj3Baa	Yes. It has been estimated that if all ice in earth would melt the sea level would rise about 80 meters. However this is a very unlikely scenario. Even if the worst scenarios of the ipcc-predictions comes true sea levels would only rise about 20 inches in about 50 years. Oil reserves will be depleted long before the icecaps would melt completely.<br>  <br>  The scare tactics movie "The inconvenient truth" showed how much of Florida would drown if the sea levels would rise 20 feet. But this is more than 10 times as much as ipcc predictions. Also it showed how the Larsen A and B ice shelves of Antarctic had melted in a short amount of time. But how much did the sea level rise because of that? Absolutely nothing. Because those ice sheets were floating in water as opposed to positioned on land. Because they were floating archimedes principle demands that sea levels can not rise when the ice melts. Only ice on land can cause sea level changes as they melt.|`|6db82c1b800fa3265fb33558203952ddaa	If the Antarctic ice cap melts or the ice that's on land melts, then yes we will experience flooding.

O7rMKLEMaa	This is merely careless use of Big Bang terminology by people who don't believe in Big Bang. The scientific establishment does not say that space is never-ending. They say is has a finite size, but it has no edge because gravity warps 4D space-time into closed loops. <br>  <br>  If you believe the universe is finite, it is proper to say that the universe is expanding. If you believe the universe is infinite, then it is proper to say that space is expanding. <br>  <br>  The expansion of space causes very distant galaxies to move farther apart---even if they are not driven apart by inertia.|`|zQiwHJV6aa	It does have an end.

We observe the redshift of a supernova which tells us by what the factor the Universe has expanded since the supernova exploded. This factor is (1+z), where z is the redshift. But in order to determine the expected brightness of the supernova, we need to know its distance now. If the expansion of the Universe is accelerating due to a cosmological constant, then the expansion was slower in the past, and thus the time required to expand by a given factor is longer, and the distance NOW is larger. But if the expansion is decelerating, it was faster in the past and the distance NOW is smaller. Thus for an accelerating expansion the supernovae at high redshifts will appear to be fainter than they would for a decelerating expansion because their current distances are larger. Note that these distances are all proportional to the age of the Universe [or 1/Ho], but this dependence cancels out when the brightness of a nearby supernova at z close to 0.1 is compared to a distant supernova with z close to 1.|`|VFRXrlDVaa	Your questions are the same thing everyone is asking.<br>  <br>  Because we live in a 3d world, your brain imagines the edge of the universe as some kind of wall, and there's always two sides to every wall.

k5Ece8BTaa	A supernova is the explosion of a massive star. A star powers itself through nuclear fusion. First, hydrogen is fused into helium. Then, if the star is massive enough, heavier nuclei are also fused. Eventually, if the star is over 1.4 solar masses, the remaining matter cannot be fused to generate heat and light, so the star collapses in on itself. This results in a burst of uncontrolled fusion where heavy nuclei are created and the outer layers of the star are thrown away violently. Generally, a nebula is formed; it is possible for a nebula to have the general shape of a ring or disk.|`|QKO4f5q0aa	A supernova is the final explosion of a star that is at least 8-10 times the mass of our Sun.  <br>  <br>  As a massive star runs out of fuel, it begins trying to fuse heavier and heavier elements.  This works, up until it gets to Iron.  Up to that point fusing elements produces more energy than it takes to fuse them.  Fusing Iron does not produce as much energy as it takes to fuse it, so the core suddenly *cools* instead of getting hotter.  This starts a catastrophic chain of events that results in the explosion of the star.  <br>  <br>  See the wikipedia article for details.|`|8gb7OG4laa	oh boy, i hate it when people answer this with "an exploding star". i mean sheesh.<br>  <br>  a supernova is the outcome when a very large star uses up its fuel.<br>  <br>  you see a star survives by balancing two forces, the outward force of the energy coming from its core and the inward force of gravity trying to crush it.<br>  <br>  you could think of it like a machine that needs a pump running in its center so that it doesn't collapse and when that pump runs out of fuel...<br>  <br>  now how does this make a star explode? glad you asked.<br>  <br>  as the stars outer layers collapse this releases a large amount of energy. this energy pushes back at the outer layers pushing them out into space away from the core and lighting them up like a frosted christmas bulb. since these layers are so large and glowing they are very bright, this is actually the supernova that we see the expanding gas cloud lit up from below.<br>  <br>  in essence a big explosion but not quite as violent as one would expect.<br>  <br>  but wait there are more than one type of supernova another type happens when you have a white dwarf orbiting a larger star. the white dwarf can siphon matter off of the larger star until the white dwarf is basically too heavy to be a white dwarf. this triggers a collapse into a smaller neutron star or even a black hole, the collapse releases a lot of energy creating the supernova, sometimes this even blows the whole system away.<br>  <br>  our sun will never go supernova or even nova it is too small. but betelgeuse, polaris, antares, eta carinae, aldebaran, cappella and several others could go any day.|`|68l1TeDjaa	maybe if you type it in the research bar youll find out...<br>  its very interesting. i wish we could be around when the sun goes supernova|`|0i80jUKeaa	exploding star

To expand it even more, multiply the x and the 2 in the first expression by each value in the second expression:<br>  <br>  x(x^2) + x(-4x) + x(3) + 2(x^2) + 2(-4x) + 2(3) =<br>  x^3 - 4x^2 + 3x + 2x^2 - 8x + 6 =<br>  x^3 - 2x^2 - 5x + 6<br>  <br>  I hope this helps!|`|ppb90MA0aa	you can multiply the first two, (x-1)(x-3) or the last two<br>  (x-1)(x-3)=x(to the power of 2)-4x+3<br>  then multiply it to (x+2)<br>  the answer will be, x(to the third power)-2x(to the 2nd power)-5x+6|`|uzxwqKl9aa	FOIL the first two, then multiply the result by (x +2)....<br>  <br>  (x-1)(x-3)<br>  =(x^2 - 3x -1x + 3)<br>  =(x^2 - 4x + 3)<br>  <br>  Now multiply this by (x + 2)...<br>  <br>  (x+2)(x^2 - 4x + 3)<br>  = x(x^2 - 4x + 3) + 2(x^2 - 4x + 3)<br>  Now distribute the x to the terms in the parentheses, distribute the 2 to the terms in the parentheses and simplify...<br>  = x^3 - 4x^2 + 3x  +  2x^2 - 8x + 6<br>  combine like terms<br>  = x^3 - 2x^2 - 5x + 6

Don't bother - unless you need to. There is a formula which has n+1 terms, where n is the power of the binomial (in this case 12). It is the sum of all the terms, where each term is of the form C(n,i)*a^(n-i)*b^i, for i going from 0 to n, and C(n,i) represents the combinations of n things taken i at a time. This is n!/((n-i)!*i!), where ! means factorial. So in this case, the first term would be a^12. The second term would be 12*a^11*b. The rest are messy.

An5FcPLqaa	The 20 inch rainfall line is the approximate boundary between the "humid east" and the "dry west" in the United States.  This boundary roughly follows the 100th meridian from the Dakotas on down through Texas.  The eastern portion of this line is more humid because of the influence of the Gulf of Mexico and Atlantic Ocean.  There is usually sufficient rainfall in this region to support non irrigated farming.  The area west of the 100th meridian is situated within the "rain shadow" of the Rocky Mountains.  The Rockies block moist air masses coming from the west (Pacific), creating a vast dry region in its shadow.  The area between the Rockies and the 100th meridian features a transitional climate known as a semi-arid steppe.  Rain is unreliable, rarely exceeding 20" per year, usually much less.  Farming generally requires irrigation to be successful in this region.  The infamous American "Dust Bowl" resided in this area, when an extended period of drought and poor farming techniques lead to the greatest man-made ecological disaster of the 20th century.

bQlQTuAHaa	You can also simply use your 110V AC outlet and get a step up transformer with a ratio around 3.. try an get one with an adjustable output since a ratio of 3 is sometimes hard to get. Use a bridge rectifier circuit to rectify the stepped up voltage ( ~330V) and feed that to the bank of capacitors. <br>  If 110V supply is something u can't get (if it is mobile gun u r making) and 12V is all u have, use a standard inverter circuit (a google search should get you a circuit diag.. be careful before choosing it since sometime stuff on the internet can be incorrectly posted) and then a step up transformer  with a ratio of about 30 and then again use the bridge rectifier to turn it back into DC... choose the inverter components wisely, the current in that circuit will be very high, do your math before buying the components.<br>  You can also use a voltage multiplier circuit for the 110V input solution, but it will give an output of 2times or 4times the input so you would need a transformer anyways.. it is simpler to go with the step up transformer & bridge rectifier. <br>  Good luck... lemme know how fast that gun fires!

YZAMZFKeaa	Paige G - You may want to rephrase your question as it is unclear what you're asking. I'll try anyway...a molecule with two COOH's (carboxylic acids) and one amine (NH2) group could be an amino acid. The 3 pKa values denote the pH at which each functional group dissociates, thereby 'releasing' its proton. In your case, the 1st acid will dissociate to form the carboxylate anion, COO(-), and a proton, H(+), below a pH of 1.9 and the second acid group will do the same at a pH of below 4.1.

So if you wanted ?=(a/b)+(c/d) you would multiply (a/b) by 1=(d/d) and (c/d) by 1=(b/b) to get ?=(ad/bd)+(cb/bd)=([ad+cb]/bd).<br>  <br>  So for your example, you need to multiply the first expression by (x+2)/(x+2) and the second by (x-2)/(x-2) to get:<br>  <br>  2(x+2)/[(x-1)(x-2)(x+2) - 3(x-2)/[(x-1)(x-2)(x+2)]<br>  =<br>  (10-x)/[(x-1)(x-2)(x+2)]|`|CtWkUswKaa	All you have to do when adding any type of fractions, you have to get common denominators. So on the left you have to multiply by (x+2) and on the right you have to multiply by (x-2) then you can bring the fractions together.

So 32 and 40 can both be divided by 2, so 32/40= 16/20 and you keep dividing until you get 4/5. Another way of doing this is by looking for the largest possible number that divides both 32 and 40, so 8.  divide both 32 and 40 by 8 and you get 4/5.<br>  <br>  The answer is 4/5|`|odOEhDivaa	32/40kg of rice were given to Mary.

Also, it is not usually known exactly where the ship sank, and even if it is, things can move around a lot on the way to the bottom due to ocean currents.<br>  <br>  Not all the bodies go to the bottom with the ship.

If you do want to use what you've suggested:    How much does the door weigh?  You could possibly attach things to your wall with velco adhesive strips (also inexpensive), which wouldn't damage your walls/door.  This might not work if the door is very heavy, since heavier door = more stress on parts of the system to move it.
