I have my resume, I'm getting my headshots on Saturday, and I wrote my cover letter. The only thing is, one of the agencies i'm submitting to is Osbrink Talent Agency. They said they want you to state what subject you are submitting in-commercial, voice over, or theater.       I originally thought that an agent would submit me for as much work as possible in all of these subjects. Theater is my favorite, but I'm 14 so I don't know how much work I can get; commercial would be great, but so would voiceover work. In my cover letter I wrote, "I am seeking representation in any or, preferably, all departments." Is this okay? or is it unprofessional and they throw my letter in the trash? should I just pick a subject...what should I pick anyway? please help me!
20090219233752AAmz0N5	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	NEW POEM I WROTE LET ME KNOW, GOOD OR BAD?	Flight Attempt, Take one..      This is my first attempt to fly,   I'm going to take off into the night sky.   Throw myself at the ground and miss,   Since I'm sick of all of this.   Flight attempt. Take one,   Flying away forever seems like fun.   Way above in the skies alone,   Then further more into the stars unknown.   Long ago it came to be,   That I had lost my Sanity.   Misdirected by their lies,   Paranoid of invisible spies.   Truth was broken,   And untruth was spoken.   Hiding from My own Fear,   Alone I tried to make things clear.   Time flew by,   As did I.   I attempted to Remain as whole,   Though the voices took their toll.   Wishing I knew, who i was,   My pain was, just because.   The dreams i had were so vivid,    Waking undescribably livid.   So painfully did I want this to end,   But certain things would never mend.   Walking as i did not live,   Those around would never give.   So i chose to end it all,   Final act, The curtains fall.

20090219232934AADQRoz	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Any suggestion for a guided reading on deep literature, for improving reading comprehension and enjoyment?	This question by any chance can be one of the most baffling you will ever encounter. As a young teenage reader, I have always attempted my best at tackling difficult tomes, which are deemed as "classics" by most contemporary literary standards. Some of which includes Proust's "Search", Faulkner, and Hemingway (these mostly fall under stream of consciousness work)      Sometimes when I read it feels like I am not reading but pretty much after I am done I can proudly say: Okay, I have seen every word in this book, now I know nothing about it. This feeling may be coupled by an understanding of the plot, or even sometimes confusion of most actions.       So you see, without at least 75% of comprehension, it is even more difficult for me to tackle the tougher literary themes and motifs (I can't even begin to fathom the esoteric techniques or stylistic things at which these authors are deft.)      So, I am attempting to tackle my next big work, Joyce's Ulysses. And I think this is a great kick-off point for a better style of reading, for better enjoyment and comprehension. This may require an improved reading method, slower pace, and other improvements.      But most importantly, I am looking for some kind of guided material for reading this work. Something people do in college, that helps reinforce the material, and aids the reader to discover the stylistic ingenuity that the author employs. In a more straightforward sense, I want to be able to say more than what the story is about after I am done, but to explore much higher themes and discuss more subtle messages with others.      If you are prolific reader, who have already gone over this curb, please give me some pointers.

Dorsimbra   By Elaine Polin      I tell you, there are times when I feel sad,   as helpless, I stand by and watch the world,   I try to keep my feelings ironclad,   for fear of what will happen once unfurled.      Sometimes, I want to   do a primal scream,   but once I start, I fear   I’ll never stop.      Teachers learn to be the world’s best actors,   a lesson often used in later life,   the world’s a stage on which I daily play,   I tell you, there are times when I feel sad.

For example in 1950s:   Decolonization was in motion   It was the first full decade of the cold war   The European Economic Community was formed (later to become the European Union)   Communism came to the American continent in the form of revolution in Cuba   Television was expanding to become the mainstream of home entertainment   Organ transplants were born   The first satellite was launched      In the 1900s:   Mass production of the car   Wright brothers flight   Last cavalry charge in modern warfare (Boer War)   New Imperialism   Death of Queen Victoria      Keeping in mind we have gone from age of Empires in the 1900s to age of democracy in 100 years, with all the technological, political, economic, social and militaristic advances we have seen through two World Wars and countless regime changing smaller wars, will we see much of the same in the next 100 years, or will there be new empires born (ascent of China, re-emergence of Russia, new powers [India, South America, Africa?]). Obviously new technologies will be born, perhaps we will see cures to AIDS and Cancer.......      Any thoughts? Any indications of how things will go....?

20090220021815AAvfK2y	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Would you please comment?	With searching eyes I looked for her, lost somewhere among the crowd, where one face is a replica of the next. Not hers though; she wears the mask of exoticism and beauty that was given to her by fortune; she wears it with dignity and sometimes even with a touch of vanity. I purposely admire her dignity more to the detriment of her vanity, and she knows it.      After a moment or two of uncertainty and despair I could finally see her walking elegantly toward me, smiling radiantly at the world. I was briefly blinded by the apparition. My heart was galloping on the pleasant turf of happiness.       When I felt her lips touching mine I kissed life with greediness. A wet and dry and most delicious kiss. I could feed on her kisses forever, as nourishment for my soul. We kissed long and untiringly and when I finally opened my eyes she had vanished. With searching eyes I looked for her, lost somewhere among the crowd, when I saw her waving me goodbye and saying with her eyes, "I loved you".            Thanks for reading.

20090220022612AAAbpCD	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	I would like some feedback on an excerpt of a play that i am writing?	this play is a spin on a semi famous japanese legend. there were two famous swordsmiths back when samurais existed, one was muramasa and the others name was masamune. muramasas blades were flawless, but he had a bloodlust and a sick and insane mind. it was said that his swords would cause the wielder to go insane and blind with rage, causing people to believe his swords were cursed. masamune on the other hand was calm. tranquil. and everything of a stereotype of discipline. his swords were said to rival that of the muramasa. the legend ended around the late 1500s. i place this story around the 1800s where a man has started murdering with a sword that was made by muramasa. he has killed hundreds. an imperialist  samurai named hayate barely survived. he learned about the legend and went to a shrine where the last known masamune blade was kept (since it is said int he legend that the two blades would rival. this is where the excerpt starts as he starts talking to the shrines priest.      ps: for those who dont know, a diasho is a double sword set, a long and a short.      priest: there is no reason i should give you this blade      hayate: if i speak the name of the blade that drew this scar. drew my blood. you would speak very different words.      priest: ...muramasa...since the beginning of time, a legend has been told. a battle between all that is good. tranquil. all that is beautiful against all the darkness. pain. screams of sorrow that is still heard toda--      hayate: stop. i have not come here to listen to your poetry. each word that i speak represents another life taken by the blade of muramasa. i would very well take a stand, but like all the others who had, i would simply be cut down. i need it. to protect      priest: swords are not made to protect. they are meant to take lives.      hayate: i am here for the masamune. weather or not if you give it to me is your choice. but i do promise you, at the end it will be in my possession. it will be used to take a life. but the blood it will draw is very little to nothing compared to the red stained fields and lives already taken by the muramasa. so i stand here now asking you to make a wise choice.      priest: and if i choose to decline?      hayate: you wont. you have burdened yourself with a duty. now it is time for you to fulfill that duty.      priest: ...the masamune itself isnt strong enough to take on the muramasa.      hayate: than give me more.      priest: i will make you a daisho, along with the blade of masamune. even then however, it still will not mean anything. it will still be a simple sharpened steel used to cut through rotting flesh.      hayate: then what must i do?      priest: you must clear your mind. you must cleanse, and shower all the rage caused by the darkness away. this sword will be cut and burnt into your soul. if you are to become one with it, you cannot allow the darkness to consume you as you still draw emotional power from it. you must be in control..      hayate: i have let go of the darkness years ago.      priest: and yet you still have a long way to travel.      hayate: then i will travel with the masamune.      priest: i will see to it..that you do.      hayate: we dont have time.      priest: and yet you will wait a month as i complete the daisho.

20090220021641AAnU8pH	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	I'm 13, I wrote this story, some one said it was too much like Twilight, is it?	If you don't follow, The Chasers are basically what the name suggests, I won't go into depth. Tyler (the guy) has the "talent" to tap into people's minds, to influence them, to almost make decisions for them, depending on the person's will-power, Emma has the "talent" of not being able to be touched when she gets nervous, angry, or scared - which make's Tyler the perfect fit for her, he can calm her. Lucy is one of their friends who can read minds, past, present, and future. It hasn't got any vampires in it, but I can' help worrying it's too much like Twilight coz' I was reading the series at the time I wrote it.      “One day the Chasers will get us,” I sighed. His finger stroked my cheek, then he lightly brought it down to the bottom of my chin. I hoped my heart wouldn’t come out of my mouth.   “They won’t.” The sincerity of his voice was so convincing. I wasn’t sure if it was because of his talent or not. I felt like I didn’t need to answer – like he, by now, could read my mind as well as Lucy could.   “They won’t,” he repeated. I reached out for his hand, longing for him to touch me again – his touch. I leaned on his shoulder, and I felt one hand around me, the other brushing the hair off my face.   “You’re so beautiful.” He looked into my eyes.   “Your eyes,” he lifted the hand from my hair , and stroked down the side of my face.   “Your eyes are the window into your beautiful soul. That’s why they’re beautiful.” I shook my head in disagreement, but didn’t answer.   “They are. The only thing about you I don’t understand is that you don’t see how beautiful you are, Emma.” He shook his head this time.   “Why?” he asked, sighing. I rested my head on his lap. I didn’t answer again.   “Oh Emma…” I looked up at his face. His perfect face. He was so perfect… that’s what I didn’t understand about him. I finally had something to say.   “If I’m beautiful, you’re perfect. Don’t ever, ever leave me,” I made him promise.   “I couldn’t.” His promise was a promise. I knew it wasn’t anything else but a promise. It wasn’t his talent.   “Even if you wanted me too,” he added. “I couldn’t.”   “I’ll never want you to go away!” I sat up quickly. An odd look crossed his face.   Then he looked at me seriously. I almost felt angry – how could he be such an idiot.   “I won’t!” I growled. He reached out for my hand, but he couldn’t touch it. Suddenly I felt like he believed me – I had no doubt why, and his hand touched mine.   “If I want you to go,” I said calmly, “Don’t. Because I’d be making a mistake.” I rested my head on his lap again.   “I love you… I’ve never been surer of anything in my life.” He smiled.   “Not as much as I love you -” I nearly interrupted, but he put a finger to my lips. “Don’t argue, Emma. I would never try to live without you, there would be no point.” He smiled. I believed him, and I wasn’t sure if I actually did. His finger brushed through my hair, and I closed my eyes.

Crackling foil hats and hand buzzers    for sale,   a few dollars more and the little old lady with the blue hat   will gum you damn near to death while the wheelchair    blocks the doorway.    Extra pillows and a deluxe remote control    will cost you three dinners    and a Bingo card.    The smarmy codger in the red robe    has most of what you want    but you'll never    get your legs back.
20090220015104AAFlRdW	Arts & Humanities;Philosophy	When you faint or go unconscious, do you think you are dead?	I have fainted only once in my life and it wasn't entirely all the way, but I remember while falling over the thought going through my head "is this what death feels like?"  I guess I didn't believe I was dying, but how do you know?  What about a person who is knocked out in a fight... when losing consciousness do you think you are dying or not?      It seems like the only thing that separates the sensations is the fact you wake up.  Do people who wake up in such a way think "whoah, was I just dead?" or more along the lines of "man i can't believe I was out for so long."  I think i'd be in the former camp.

20090219224347AABaHAg	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	Can You give me constructive criticism or opinions on my POEM? no jerks ha?	-Illusive Unanimity-      The light is snatched by the shadows,   along with peace that was never meant   to be.   The proletariat's bewailing pleads are   ignored by then men in cuffs as the    masses perish across the blue abyss.      We are taught justice, but all we know   is injustice. We abstain from standing   to the ones who protect us from behind   the desk of deception in fear of losing   our unalienable rights.      One may fall but together we have the    power to overthrow the corrupt and take    legitimate and justifiable action.                                    Thank You

20090220011912AAozysY	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	How to reduce the word count in my novel?	My book's current word count is about 128,000 words. I'm rewriting, and trying to shorten sentences, cut out unnecessary sections, etc. but it's hard. I go to a professional writer's group, and a few members have read the book, as well as a couple of book-loving friends that I trust for their honesty.      One of my readers, an author and editor (and also the most brutal of our critics), has said that my book is marketable and well-written, but it needs to be cut to about no more than 100,000 words. There are a few scenes I could cut, but the other readers have expressed dismay at my threat to cut these scenes - although they're not exactly necessary to move the story along, they say these scenes add to the story in character development and personality.      So a question for the authors: how do you reduce the size of your books during the rewrites? Already I've cut some of my descriptive passages to almost nothing, and I'm not overly descriptive to begin with. I don't want to pull all of the personality and scenery out of my book just to keep it a certain word count.

Familiar, still it seems a brand new me.   The world now seems a hopeful place to play,   A moonlit beach, I look out towards the sea.      Fireworks whizz! careen   Splash the face of dark night!   Exploding wild report,   Chrysanthemums fill the sky!      New paths appear where there were none before   New hope arises from the winter depths   I see a hint of sunrise in the east   There is a smile upon my face today.

20090220030231AAHEvrl	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	Writer's Play with Words, a poem. What are your thoughts?	Writer's Play with Words   by Victoria Tarrani   ((c) 0902.20)      Words, independent of form,    rhyme like dimes and crimes   frosty limes in the New York Times   but one word rarely   carries the power,   joy, sorrow, hope, dreams   of poem, prose, music...      If all poems rhymed   there would be no   Stanyon Street and other Sorrows;   where could Bob Dylan's   magic touch all   Tangled Up in Blue   exist?   There will always   be great lyrics,   sonnets, valentines,   Shakespeare,   but the world of words   must be free   for those who love   Roses are Red   and Break On Through   To the Other Side;   Morrison was mystical.      We cannot lose    one form for another   and trust we will have   all there is to savor.
20090220031352AAv7I2S	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	Do you think this poem is any good?	So this is it;      Its one thing to hear your voice say hello   Its another to hear it say good bye   But when I hear you say I love you   The sad in me burns away      When your eyes meet mine   I feel this connection   I never want to look away   But when I realise it was all just a dream   I don’t want to go back to reality      I want to stay there with you   Even though it may not be real   I want you to stay in your arms forever   Until the day of death dawns on me   I want to know its just me and you      But when I wake and see you again   The hatred that you have for me   I realise that love is hard to find   Even if you believe in it.

20090220025730AAiMNxT	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Is the story I write too similar to Twilight?	The part I posted earlier, everyone said was too close too Twilight and I should change it, but here's another part (refer to  http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...     for other part)      Tyler grabbed Ben by the arm, but Ben resisted.   “What’s happening?” he asked. He wasn’t going anywhere.   “Long story. Run or die, Ben.” Ben began to run follow Lucy and Brian down the alley as Darcy scooped up Sandy then ran ahead. He ran so fast – it was incredible. Ben struggled to keep up with the others, even though they didn’t have the talent of speed. Lucy turned around and realised how far back Ben was. She slowed down, then grabbed Ben’s arm and tugged him. Ben felt like his legs were running so fast he was going to trip over any second. It surprised him that she had no trouble tugging him along – it didn’t seem to affect her speed in any way. They reached a brick wall at the end of the alley.   “Now what?!” Ben exclaimed, furious that they had led him here. They didn’t even answer him. Darcy ran to the bottom right corner and Ben realised that they knew the brick wall was there all along. There was a tunnel. Ben panicked. They all started climbing in, but Lucy waited for Ben.   “Are you coming, or are you just going to wait her for The Chasers to get you?” she asked, motioning him towards the tunnel. Ben was turning pale.   “Ladies first…” he mumbled.   “Hurry up!! What are you waiting for?!” her voice was getting louder.   “Nothing, nothing!” he said, but he still stood there, staring at the tunnel.   “Well, after men! Hurry!” she said. “What are you doing?”    “Well, it’s dark, and tiny, and I’m claustrophobic!” the words came out faster than a bullet. Lucy’s finger was tapping her leg frantically.    “You have to go now, Ben! You have to!” she said, glancing behind her. She knew they’d be here any second.    “I can’t!” Ben moaned.   “The others are already on the other side; I can’t fight them off by myself! You have to go, and now!” Ben bit his lip and looked into the dark hole. Three men came racing around the corner.    “There they are!” one shouted. They were in V shape. The one at the front, the one who’d shouted, was obviously the leader.    Ben groaned, then started crawling into the hole, feeling his way.
