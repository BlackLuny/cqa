If it's saved as a bitmap it will retain quality, JPeg and GIF make the edges blur. When you save, there's a drop down menu below where you type in your file name. It will probably be set to JPeg, change this to 24bit Bitmap and you won't lose quality.

ICtwYntuaa	The parts look good for gaming.  Putting them together isn't all that difficult either.<br>  <br>  The motherboard is a large, thin rectangular piece that sits along one of the sides of the tower case, you'll just have to screw it in.  Graphics card and RAM are inserted into the motherboard into the appropriate slots; the graphics card slot will probably have some screws.  The CPU also goes on the motherboard, and on top of it should go the heat sync and fan.  The power supply usually goes into the corner of the tower.<br>  <br>  The hard drive and any CD/DVD drives are screwed in on the sides of the case and usually slide into place.  They must then be connected to the appropriate IDE ports on the motherboard using grey cables.  You may have to adjust some settings before it all works.  Good luck!|`|fCOq04lNaa	1.

Wd7LOjWWaa	well, an approach that you can use involves archiving the iso into multiple files. <br>  i.e. using winrar to archive to compress and archive the iso into 2 .rar files roughly 4 gb each.<br>  <br>  Although, this method is somewhat of a hassle;  you would have to copy the compressed files over from each dvd onto your hard drive. Then you would have to extract the iso and mount the image using a virtual drive such as the one found in the program Daemon Tools.<br>  <br>  Now, if you are being sneaky and saying program when you mean dvd movie, then you would have to send me an e-mail.  Dealing with movies is illegal, but there are methods...of course it doesn't make it any less illegal.|`|VCzsfVM5aa	use daemon, it will act as a virtual drive and run the iso right from your hard drive, or portable drive.  I use power iso myself, but daemon is free and works just as well.|`|CARmP1zLaa	You need a dual layer dvd and a burner capable of burning dual layer.<br>  Splitting an ISO in two can't be done very easily.|`|hkEOO6eUaa	download a free program called poweriso and mount it as a iso and you can do whatever you want without putting it on a dvd|`|AA11487114	u can't split the file, best option is to use a duel layer disk if your dvd rom supports dual layer writing.|`|AA11070581	Don't split it, use a double layer disk.

But this will only work if your burner supports it. <br>  My Suggestion: Even though you want it on disk, you could get a program that pretends the ISO image is a real CD or DVD.
j3Px4JXfaa	Hi ben,<br>  <br>  Congrats on trying out the new Beta, that’s pretty cool. As you know, since it’s a Beta, there are good chances that not every single program or piece of hardware will work with the new OS. Companies are still working on creating their new drivers and seeing how their products will work with the upcoming OS, so it is very likely that things won’t be worked out until the new product is released.<br>  <br>  I’d suggest checking in with the makers of the game for the most up-to-date info as they’ll for sure want to keep you and other gaming in the future.<br>  <br>  Cheers,<br>  Ron<br>  Windows Outreach Team

AA11070581	That depends on what you are using it for, I have used AMD's for a long time, as they had on board memory controllers, years ago. This gave them huge gains over the same speed Intel's. It is good to see Intel has finally caught on. The Opteron CPU's are really a server chip and as so are very stable. I have a Dual core Opty among others and it loves online games and any file of mixed music + Video content. In my humble, there are not enough 2 channel optimized programs, let alone 4 to warrant a quad core. Check out the Black edition AMD 64X2's like the 7750, unlocked and with a huge Cache|`|0f53624e253ff98b5745955d48febbc0aa	Well, Opteron is a server processor, and the i7 is for desktops. I'd go with the i7 because it is more than a standard quad core, it has a direct memory access using a built in memory controller so it accesses the RAM a lot faster than the old quad cores which relied on the relatively slow Northbridge. Also, the i7 uses hyperthreading which was abandoned after Pentium 4. Hyperthreading makes the physical cores act like two logical cores. So i7's have the processing power of eight physical cores, making it kinda like an octo-core processor. i7 is really great and extremely overclockable. I have no experience with AMD's stuff either, so yeah. Get the i7.|`|GgBdQqrdaa	my i7 is rediculous fast.|`|RSyZFFx9aa	intel Core i7 is much better, i may have a bias towards AMD, but they generally have less connectors, hence their slower speeds, and the computers that they are in are $100 cheaper compared to Intel. also as a note AMD never tells you prices on the boxed processors.|`|v15npNiUaa	Here's the thing... <br>  Intel i7 is AMAZING in performance, but doesn't last longer than 2 to 3 years (if used regularly). However the Opteron is average in performance but is built to last. <br>  So it's up to you... but if I were you I would get the i7.|`|k0MqD82saa	Intel i7 is the best for graphics and gaming. It amazing and they are putting that processor in the new macs later.
AA11408911	Hey Edixor,<br>  <br>  My personally recommendation would be to refrain from such practise, more so with desktop terminals. While there has been no significant evidence to suggest that not shutting down a computer fully will always lead to computer faults, you do run the increased risk of hardware problems developing, specifically with regards to corruption of the hardware files. <br>  <br>  Having said this, modern components and power supplies are more 'adaptive' to such sudden power cut-outs, and some computer users will agree that there is no real danger to pulling the plug on a computer in order to shut it down, after all, computers have been known to become unresponsive, as such pulling the plug is the only means of restarting the system. <br>  <br>  Quite simply you would be running a very small risk of damage occurring, more so if you were to shut a computer down and start up again multiple times in quick succession, but you should be fine 'killing the power' if used in moderation. <br>  <br>  [ Sources ]<br>  <br>  <a href="http://uk.blog.360.yahoo.com/blog-qT1KKPQoRKdVT4lowpJCljbFokkuIzI8?p=1898">http://uk.blog.360.yahoo.com/blog-qT1KKP...</a><br>  <br>  [ Thanks for the update ]<br>  <br>  I would assume this was the cause. Pulling the plug would risk a power surge within the computer power supply that could eventually blow the fuse / damage the unit. <br>  <br>  All the best<br>  Chεεrs|`|mEQcAMqxaa	It would be like turning the ignition off in your car when you're driving down the highway at 70 miles an hours.  Not such a great idea but the car will start again usually.  In other words... why not just shut the PC down in the normal way.

im6Gyuijaa	Use the link provided and choose Cruzer Micro, and whatever your Operating System is (I'd choose XP SP2 because it's compatible with Windows 2000) and click find driver. Choose U3 LaunchPad Installer and click continue. Make an account (it's okay, they don't spam or anything else annoying) and download the file. Put in your flash drive, and run the program. It allows you to download U3 programs onto the drive and I believe it has a Safari program for download. The bad part is that it will not work on Macs or computers with Linux. The good part is you can have Safari when you go to a buddie's house.<br>  <br>  If you can't stand not being able to use the drive on Macs, then buy a second one. Flash drives today are cheaper than ever, I recently purchased an 8GB one for around $20, and while I was there I saw a 2Gb that was around $7!

3dv7Qdoxaa	Ok, I think you're getting memory and hard drive space confused. The hard drive is where you store your files, pictures, music, movies, etc. Memory is what you put in your computer to make it go faster, in Lehman's terms.  You can't store any files on the memory. And you can't have 100 Gigs of memory, which is why I think you're getting them confused.<br>  <br>  To solve your problem, I would install an anti-virus program on there. This sounds a lot like a virus infecting your computer.<br>  <br>  If this doesn't solve the problem, I would first take it back in and physically show them what's going wrong. Open up the internet and show them what happens when you open a few tabs. Also, show them what happens when you try to play DVD and open files. <br>  <br>  If they still can't figure out the problem, I would reinstall the operating system. I know it's a pain in the back, but it will solve any problems 95% of the time. <br>  <br>  Also, you can probably return that fan. The only purpose of a fan is to make your computer cooler and that isn't the problem here. A fan won't solve the kinds of issues you're having.|`|SUswLjBWaa	First of all, if you are talking about 100 GB, you are talking hard-drive or storage, not memory.  Memory is RAM and is something that can actually help speed your computer up a bit.  Secondly, if you scanned for viruses with an UPDATED anti-virus program, you might want to consider a anti-spyware/malware program like Spybot (<a href="http://www.safer-networking.org/index2.html)." rel="nofollow">http://www.safer-networking.org/index2.h...</a>  If that still doesn't work, you might need to reinstall Windows because it sounds like something is definitely wrong.|`|vDSRgHxDaa	Memory is usually RAM. But as you have over 100GB it must be a new hard drive. Anyway why don't you try showing the people at the shop what the problem is.|`|44d9854926f61095cc5d59a44f80d73baa	Could be too many things.  You've gotta bring it to a better shop for a tune-up.  Check for proper settings on the virtual RAM.  Check for fragmentation, etc etc.|`|T7Apky52aa	I think you probably got over 1G of memory as XP can't access more than 3.xG I don't believe. I think Vista can access a bit more but I haven't heard of any PC having 100G of memory in it and not for 70 pounds.<br>  <br>  That all said, what you need to do is take the machine back to them and walk them through your problems while you're there so you can both see first hand what it is or isn't doing.<br>  <br>  One thing you might consider doing is getting the Yahoo Widgets and using one of the CPU load monitors or when it gets slow just open the task manager and click the processes tab to see what, if anything, is hogging resources. Once you find the culprit that may help solve your problem. The more tabs you have open, the more memory you're going to be using obviously so it's going to be a little slower, but if you've added memory that shouldn't be an issue.<br>  <br>  With the fan, their assumption may have been that it was overheating and they were trying to cool the CPU. I had a box that was very sensitive in the summer time to overheating and I had to run a portable fan at it on the outside to cool it down so I don't think they were trying to screw you with the fan. Computers can get buggy if they get too hot or too cold.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps!

JUC8E03taa	You can transfer all the files off of your iPod back onto your computer. There are programs that can do this for you, personally I prefer to do it manually so there is no cost and no need to worry about spyware or viruses.<br>  <br>  To do it manually, you need to display hidden folders on your computer - how you do this varies by operating system so just run an internet search for "display hidden folders in ___" where blank is XP or Vista etc. Follow those directions, then plug your iPod into your computer.

In addition, you have to refer 7 to 15 (probably 15 much more often than 7) friends, who also sign up for the sponsors and refer their friends!  You see, this is a pyramid scheme, which is a scheme that gives you money (in ths case a TV) for referring people, but you are only allowed to refer people after you pay money.  They try to disguise this, but, like all pyramid schemes, eventually you won't be able to find anyone to refer (You'd be surprised how quickly this adds up, after their are 6 "levels" of people referring each other, you will have have to referred more than 100 million people in total!)  When this happens, the people at the bottom of the pyramid lose their money, and they don't get a TV.  Don't let yourself be one of those people.|`|pXtkhCkRaa	The site seems OK.

NGzsGTegaa	This is a tricky issue. IF the system will boot up, it will require you to wipe out all the drivers that pertained to the older system and install new ones. Not a hard thing to do but its like trying to put a band aid on a band aid.<br>  <br>  If you get it working, Vista will prompt you to re-activate it since it thinks you are trying to illegally copy the OS to another machine.<br>  <br>  I have done this successfully but the hardest problem is flushing out the old drivers. Try driver sweeper if all else fails.|`|6b20b31ca0cc72763d8a38403afd5bcbaa	No, each time you install windows it loads the drivers for the chipset of the board you are installing it on. So all it has on it is the drivers for the motherboard and other hardware from the original computer it was on. I doubt it will even be able to find vista when you boot it.|`|fMUWbF1aaa	providing the comonents you have in the PC supports vista it should be ok (if you only have a 32bit CPU but 64bit os it wont work etc) although it might require youto reactivate windows. a quick phone call to microsofts automated service normally does the trick|`|f33xIzFWaa	if the drive came off a manufactured pc i don't think you can get it to work because the version of windows on the drive is designed to work specifically on that computer.  i tried to do that with a hard drive from an old manufactured pc to put it into one i built and it would not work. i had to go out and buy windows again|`|AA11070581	That depends on what it came out of, does it have the correct drivers for the new system? it may be better to do a repair.

That makes (d) the closest although the DVD would be a slave as well. This is the problem with IDE one controller and two channels|`|AA10845522	The answer is "a". <br>  Since there are 2 IDE channels (0 and 1) and you have 4 drives, two drives will be masters and 2 will be slaves.

wkLTTr06aa	Hello,<br>  I have a desktop computer and a laptop and wanted to share files, printer and the internet.<br>  Here is how mine works:<br>  1. Purchased a Linksys  USB wireless access point for the desktop.<br>  2. Purchased a wireless PCMCIA card for my HP ze4220 laptop.<br>  note: your laptop probabaly has wireless built in already.<br>  3. Set up a peer-to-peer network between the desktop and laptop computers. <br>  Click on "Start" then "Control Panel" select "Network and Internet Connections" finally select "Setup a wireless network for a home or small office".<br>  <br>  Follow the directions. It's best to have a thumb drive handy to copy the setup for the laptop since you will need to run the setup on it also.<br>  Be sure to follow the instructions exactly.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps. The peer to peer setup does work very well.<br>  Al|`|oJlfgrPoaa	If the printer is wireless, then just add a printer to your laptop and I think it should be able to detect it.<br>  <br>  If you printer is not wireless, unplug it from the desktop and plug it into your laptop in the USB port.

Fe7AX3eHaa	It doesn't sound like you have two notebooks and if not, you will need a way to connect your old HDD to your Macbook after you put the new HDD in it (or vice versa).  An external ATA enclosure for 2.5" HDD (notebook sized HDD) connected via USB should do the trick.  Here is an example at NewEgg.com: <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16817145752" rel="nofollow">http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.as...</a>  I'm not recommending this enclosure since I have no experience with it, just using it as an example.<br>  <br>  If you go with SuperDuper you will want to connect the new HDD as an external drive first and then use the "mirroring" feature that DrugStoreCowboy is talking about.  Once that is complete, replace the old HDD with the new (make sure any jumper requirements have been satisfied; set to master or cable select) and your Macbook should load as it usually does.<br>  <br>  I've never used SuperDuper but I have used numerous drive imaging software before and this is the best way to get an exact copy of your HDD.<br>  <br>  As far as licensing is concerned, it will have no affect.  Once your new drive is installed into your Macbook, it will be the same as your old drive.  Licensing is usually per machine and if it is square (so to speak) on the old HDD, it will be on the new.<br>  <br>  **As an added bonus, you can use your old HDD as an external drive with your new enclosure.|`|23LFplkjaa	Best program that will do that for you is Super Duper. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.shirt-pocket.com/SuperDuper/SuperDuperDescription.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.shirt-pocket.com/SuperDuper/S...</a><br>  <br>  Its free too with an option to purchase if you like it.  It will create a mirror of your other drive and I am thinking thats what you want.  Just make sure you have the 2 laptops connected via USB or Firewire.  Good luck.

And maybe it's just something simple and cheap to fix.|`|rz7GfvPNaa	you cant fix, its likely to be cheaper to buy a new laptop|`|MpsodHcbaa	Is it a laptop? You can buy a used one on Ebay and there are some companies that sell new ones.Just shop around by by googling your model #. keep in mind how cheap laptops are becoming and compare the lcd price.It may not be worth it.<br>    There are stickers that cover the screw holes and also some are under the rubber pads that kep the monitor from slamming into the keyboard of the laptop. From there the bezel needs to be popped off.It is definitely a feel thing because its snapped in.Too much pressure and you'll risk cracking the bezel.Once the bezel is off , there are more screws and a plug in on the back.<br>   If you are talking about a desktop, just buy an Acer .Ive sold tons of the Acer lcds with 0 problems and a great price.<br>     Good luck.

UV8bN0Giaa	You can't go wrong and I personally recommend Dell! There are hidden long-run costs that one does not initially see when you purchase a Notebook PC other than Dell, HP or IBM and later encounter difficulties or attempt buying replacement parts like a battery, or say a keyboard etc.<br>  <br>  Also if you're buying for college then I do NOT recommend a Notebook PC bigger than 15.4" bec we have 3 DELLs incl a larger 17" Notebook PC and the larger ones are nice but much too heavy to lug around campus as well as too big for lecture hall desks in college... <br>  <br>  I mentioned we own 3 Dell Notebook PCs and why I recommend DELL, HP or IBM for those living in the United States is that those 3 particular PC Notebook manufacturers literally supply all the business Notebook PCs to the major corporations and Government so replacement parts are readily available esp on EBAY at even a more reasonable price than the manufacturer website. Thus in the long run, being able to get the exact replacement part extends the life on your investment.<br>  <br>  FYI my 1st Notebook PC was Gateway bec I couldn't afford Dell at the time and what a mistake is was when I needed to purchase a new Notebook battery <= costly bec not readily available like Dells... and FYI I also ran into a similar problem when attempting to upgrade the memory.<br>  <br>  Note if you are looking for DELL bargains, then visit their DELL OUTLET site...<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.dell.com/outlet" rel="nofollow">http://www.dell.com/outlet</a><br>  <br>  Hope Above Info Helps!

As far as I know, Reason 4 has no digital audio capabilities.<br>  <br>  If you're just wanting a program to edit MIDI data and have a sequencer, then you want to buy Reason 4.  It has lots of MIDI abilities and plays nice with other programs since it has ReWire (ReWire is a tool that allows you to slave Reason 4 with other programs).<br>  <br>  If you haven't tried either of them, I recommend downloading Reason Adapted (it's a demo version).

6beL9zycaa	Hmmm.. that's a tough one.  I don't know Cybersitter personally, so I'm not sure how they install their program. Did you try doing a system restore back to the date before your dad installed the Cybersitter?  I don't really think that will work, but you could try.  That's why I keep a file with all of my account passwords (disguised, of course) because it's just too easy to forget them.  But that doesn't help you now.  I've never heard of needing a password to uninstall a program, but it makes sense that you'd need one for Cybersitter since kids would be able to delete it themselves.<br>  Check here:  www.perfect-uninstall.com    or one of these:<br>  <a href="http://search.yahoo.com/search?p=Cybersitter">http://search.yahoo.com/search?p=Cybersi...</a><br>  Hope one of those helps, good luck.

See here:<br>  <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310575" rel="nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310575</a><br>  <br>  Windows is plug and play and will install the USB drivers from it's store.  If it has one.  Some computers come with their own drivers for USB, if that's the case, use them.  If you can't figure it out, try Windows Update.<br>  <br>  USB mouse and keyboard are OK to leave in but beware, you might lose control of them when you uninstall the drivers. It would be better is you had PS/2 mouse and keyboard.  If not, You can use the power button for shutdown. Control panel>device manager.  Find all entries in device manager that match USB and right click on each.  Choose uninstall.  Do that for every one.  Restart your computer.  <br>  <br>  Hopefully that will solve your USB problem.   I'm not a fan of driver detective as it as it seems to find outdated drivers which do you no good.

You can make it whatever you'd like.<br>  <br>  Hook your computer to the router with a LAN cable, and one of those two links below this message should work.  Default password is typically admin/admin or just leaving it blank (if it's a belkin).

In the address bar type:<br>  192.168.0.1<br>  or<br>  192.168.1.1<br>  and hit enter.<br>  <br>  You will then see a login box. With luck it will be already be filled in with username and password.

But then again that's just me and I might've been lucky.<br>  <br>  However, running both uses up tons of resources and will slow down any computer majorly. Norton doesn't seem to detect any better than AVG anymore, so I now only use AVG.<br>  <br>  If you want the protection of two antivirus programs, how about have one running continuously and another just scanning on demand.

608d1f685421cf08291c4f9ce7135a0faa	When I sell I send a tracking number the next day at Ebay. But some sellers don't.

If they don't have a tracking number you should receive it maximum 10 to 14 days. If not contact Paypal and let them know.|`|1pK1Sd0Gaa	What did the listing said about shipping?

Copy that file to some form of portable media - flash drive will probably work best. Then just put the flash drive into one of the other machines and copy the song file to that machine.

Instead, you become a licensed user — you purchase the right to use the software on a single computer, but you can't put copies on other machines or pass that software along to colleagues. Software piracy is the illegal distribution and/or reproduction of  software applications or fonts for business or personal use. Whether software piracy is deliberate or not, it is still illegal and punishable by law.<br>  <br>  Piracy comes in many forms. Here are some common piracy methods:<br>  <br>  Licensed user duplication for unlicensed users <br>  Illegal Internet distribution <br>  Illegal use of software over a network <br>  Distributing specialized education versions to unauthorized markets <br>  Distribution of inauthentic  software or fonts

AA10700604	Hi Steav T,<br>  <br>  Your Mac’s Finder is able to burn CDs or DVDs, if your hardware is capable of burning discs.  You stick a blank DVD or CD-ROM disc in your Mac and the blank disc icon comes up on your Mac’s desktop.<br>  <br>  Double-click on the disc icon and you get a blank finder window open up.  You simply drag and drop your photo files, or whatever you want into this window and then either click on the “Burn” button at the top-right of the window, or down inside the side bar where it shows the disc icon, click on the little radio-active symbol.  <br>  <br>  You’ll get a dialog box, where you can type in a name for the disc and change the burning speeds.  The standard default format can make the disc so that it’s readable on any computer format.  Click the OK (or is it burn?) button and the Macintosh will do everything else for you.  <br>  <br>  You can also create a Burn Folder from the File > New Burn Folder menu command.  This creates a blank folder that you drag your files into. After the burning procedure is done, you can throw in another blank disc and and just click burn again, no need to repeat the whole dragging procedure.<br>  <br>  But, if by pictures, you’re talking about movies, you need to download a program like Handbreak to convert your commercial DVDs to MP4 files.  However that's for viewing on your iTunes/iPod and not on a DVD player.  Use a program like Popcorn to move DVD Movies to your Mac.<br>  <br>  Enjoy.<br>  <br>  --Rick|`|TQOLhV53aa	I think the iSkysoft DVD Creator for Mac is your best choice,which helps you Convert MP4, M4V, MPA, MPG, MPEG, MOV, 3GP, 3GP2, FLV, VOB, DAT, TS, TP, TRP, M2TS, AVI to DVD on Mac and burn DVD movie on Mac. iSkysoft DVD Creator for Mac is the best video to dvd burner software for Mac OS X users .<br>  You can free download and try here: <a href="http://www.kooksoft.com/iSkysoft-DVD-Creator-for-Mac_886.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.kooksoft.com/iSkysoft-DVD-Cre...</a><br>  <br>  Step by Step Tutorial: <a href="http://www.kooksoft.com/How-to-convert-all-sorts-of-movies-to-DVD-on-Mac-OS-X-_1479.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.kooksoft.com/How-to-convert-a...</a><br>  <br>  I hope this may help you.|`|6d1084c77bbded88a58ddf49eda07280aa	I would check filehippo.com, they sponsor a lot of freeware used for a variety of things.|`|DdK97Ixcaa	idvd<br>  imovie<br>  nero

Those TB hard drives sound good cause they hold a lot of information, but that is also their downfall. They hold to much info for the speed of the hard drive. To make a 1tb hdd that won't slow the computer down would require a 10,000 or 15,000 rpm HDD. Unfortunately they don't make those yet. I would say to get dual 500gb and set them up in a raid 0 configuration.

23LFplkjaa	Torrent is Peer to Peer file Sharing.  You have to download a client such as <a href="http://azureus.sourceforge.net/." rel="nofollow">http://azureus.sourceforge.net/.</a><br>  <br>  After the client is installed, you have to find a site that hosts the file you are looking for.  I won't provide that for you.  It will install a small little file on your desktop once you find a site that hosts that file.  You click on that file and it will automatically start downloading<br>  <br>  Seeding are the people you are getting the file from.  Leeching is what you do until the file is complete.  Its suggested that you maintain a 1:1 ratio, so if say the file is 5MB, seed 5MB back after the file is complete.<br>  <br>  The more people seeding, the faster you will get the file.|`|GtalVPNjaa	a seeder is someone who is willing to allow a file to be uploaded from them to others<br>  <br>  a leecher is one who wants to download a file <br>  <br>  so when you see a torrent with far more leechers than seeders, you know it'll be a bit slower to download <br>  <br>  if it has no seeds/seeders then you cant download the file.... <br>  <br>  you will need to download a torrent programme like bittirrent then search for files using something like mininova to search for what you want <br>  <br>  then by clicking to download the file on mininova bittorrent will on request download the file for you....|`|OGoGsyCTaa	I'm sure you've gotten it by now. Utorrent is a program you use to download files which are people are sharing for free(free of charge). All you need to do is download a BitTorrent client(say utorrent from utorrent.com), the file is usually very small like 300kb and then install it. After that you go to any torrent site(say mininova.com or thepiratebay.com) and search for whatever file you want to download. Download the file from the torrent(which site you used) and open it with the utorrent program you install. The file will show in the program(utorrent) and will give you more data like seeders(people who are sharing the file you are downloading), leechers(people still downloading like you), the download speed, upload speed and a lot more. It is very pretty easy to go about torrents.<br>  NB Some countries consider the sharing of COPYRIGHTED files over torrents as illegal.|`|Yu7vBUkOaa	A seeder is someone who is uploading the file(s).<br>  <br>  A leecher is someone who is downloading the file(s) (and probably uploading them too).<br>  <br>  Using BitTorrent to download a copy of Civ 4 without a license is illegal. Don't do it.|`|60b0d42c3c92dec6d976704c90ee8eb5aa	This is a bit long - but you did ask!<br>  <br>  Before we go any further, let's explain BitTorrent. It is a peer-to-peer sharing protocol developed in 2001. It starts with one computer, offering files and running BitTorrent. The first computer is a seed. As other computers (peers) download the files, they also begin offering them for upload. The number of computers offering the files grows exponentially. This is an efficient way of distributing monster files. <br>  <br>  BitTorrent and legal downloads<br>  <br>  BitTorrent is not illegal. It does not store copyrighted data. In fact, BitTorrent Inc. contracts to download movies legally. Partners include Warner Brothers, 20th Century Fox and MGM. <br>  <br>  However, most people, and probably ISPs, view BitTorrent as serious trouble. When it came out, illegal downloaders immediately glommed onto it. You yourself used it for illegal downloads. <br>  <br>  ISPs have gotten into trouble in the past for surreptitiously cracking down. But I think they have a huge problem. Legitimate video downloads have stretched them. They view illegal downloads of movies as an intolerable burden. So do the vast majority of their customers who suffer the slowdowns.

These directories have already researched the online survey companies out there, and know which ones are legit and which ones are not.

KHSOVxViaa	The program you're using is faulty.  Use a different one.  Maybe report the fault so the programmers can fix it.<br>  <br>  A stack is like a stack of plates.  Programmers make use of them for various reasons, but the idea is that you stick something on top of the stack to be retrieved later.  You can add more on top of that, but you have to retrieve them in reverse order i.e. top first.<br>  <br>  Stacks have a limited size.<br>  <br>  If you put too much on the stack, it overflows, causing an error like that.  It's not your fault, it's the team that created the program.  Not necessarily the programmer - he may have been given bad instructions!|`|AA11849917	The stack is a portion of memory reserved for calculations and other important information.  If a program has a routine that calls itself, each time it calls itself it puts information on the stack showing where the "call" came from, and how to return to the calling program.  If the program was coded badly, and the routine calls itself continuously, the "return" information fills the stack until the stack is full, and the program crashes.  "line 873" refers to the line of code in the program that is trying to call itself - trying to put more information on the stack when the stack is already full.<br>  <br>  What to do about it?  Only the programmer who designed the code can do anything about it  -  Unless you have way too little memory.  If you only have 512K of RAM, and you need 1 GIG, that would also cause the stack overflow, because there just isn't sufficient memory available to allocate it all to the stack.<br>  <br>  If that is the case, you need to add additional internal memory (RAM) to your computer.|`|l9RDuthbaa	The most common reason for stack overflow is a recursion whose termination condition is never reached.<br>  <br>  The stack is a memory segment which is used by the program to record its flow. When ever a function is called, the program saves the local variables and some more data (this is known as "stack frame") to the stack, pushes the parameters for the new function call to the stack and passes the execution to the called functions.<br>  When a function returns, the program pops the stack frame returns the execution to the calling function.<br>  When a recursion calling itself over and over, eventually it would fill the stack (which has a limited space, determined by the operating system and the compiler), and trigger a stack overflow exception.<br>  Another less common cause for stack overflow can be trying to allocate a very large array on the stack (e.g. "char mybuffer[10000000];").|`|9dbbac6fc68c0045ed3f23e7d160d30faa	It is a memory error. What is happening when this error occurs? Is it something that is in the startup or a program you launch automatically? I would look for an update to the program after determining what it is.

In this case, you will run this program click on the Motherboard tab then look at where it says "Chipset", you should see a chipset manufacturer's name such as Intel then the model of Chipset.  After finding out what chipset you have, you can then go to Newegg.com and search for processors compatible with your chipset.  When choosing the processor, make sure that the processor matches the maximum bus speed of your motherboard and that the size of the chip does fit in the socket type of your motherboard.|`|p2GiuhSqaa	<a href="http://www.intel.com/products/processor/pentium_dual-core/index.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.intel.com/products/processor/...</a>

And then restart it and as soon as the startup sound is done hold down d until the Apple and the gear thing pop up. Then choose your language and go through the steps. Then you can choose archive and install so click that but under it unclick the button that says store previous users file and it will restore it to factory settings.
2SSA9e9Naa	Hey, MVP, that was the information I gave you right? I didn't know how to change your map color because I wasn't sure how it was represented.<br>  <br>  Email me and we can exchange more information. I'll need to know how you are showing your "map" on your form. It will probably be something like<br>  <br>  object.Backcolor = Color.Red.
AbRfd29Haa	Maybe Craigslist?  You'll probably notice the eBay is THE place for this kind of stuff. Malls exist because every store there knows that lots of people will be at a mall... same reason there are no major stores in my neighborhood (farms, farms, and more farms... there's a gas station, a diner, and a bait shop). So think of where you might shop online... where are the people? If there are no customers, you aren't going to sell. Since the internet is so successful at shrinking the world, most people would look at eBay, since most sellers go there, since most people go there, etc. Is there even a #2 anymore? Many, many alternative online auction sites have failed, due to lack of customers. There's half.com, if you're selling new... owned by eBay, of course. <br>  <br>  There's not a great deal of money in selling used hard drives. I would never consider buying a used drive, because they don't last all that long. And of course, I don't know the history of any HDD I might buy from an individual... at least with an established company, there's someone I know will be there to support me in the future. <br>  <br>  Another option is Amazon.com... they do have a resellers program. I don't know what you have to do to qualify, but you should look into that... it's the one eBay alternative I see with any frequency. <br>  <br>  If you have some odd source of new HDDs... can you really compete on price with a place like NewEgg or ECost? Again, given the risks, I would need a pretty substantial incentive (eg, much, much cheaper) and some history recorded with you (ratings, which is why eBay and Amazon and the like maintain reseller ratings).|`|nE43Gppdaa	Try LiveSimon at <a href="http://www.LiveSimon.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.LiveSimon.com</a> for free auctions or classifieds.<br>  <br>  Or if you would prefer to sell it locally and place an ad without all the registering, try LiveSimon Posts at <a href="http://www.LSPosts.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.LSPosts.com</a><br>  <br>  eBay has a lot of fees, and craigslist has a lot of spam.|`|ecOyy2PGaa	Make your own hard drive website, isnt it better?|`|cN0aT30Maa	greensheet, craigslist....

But then all you are is connected. You'll probably want some services. Much of networking is done with firmware embedded devices. Most off the shelf routers have DHCP servers built in for instance. If you are looking at doing a domain controller, you'll need an LDAP service, some DNS, maybe an html and database machine...

As it turns out, you must install everything on the list, and you must do it by their rules. I tried the same thing that you did, installing/uninstalling, and eventually it went through. It was doing this for about four days, and out of nowhere it added and let me sign in. <br>  <br>  I think that the loop eventually ended because I went to the actual MSN site, where you first get it, and download it from there.

Because you said it re-starts itself randomly, there is a possibility it is overheating.  If your system gets to hot, it will "throttle" the cpu, which means it will slow it down to half or ever lower speeds.  This will make it very slow.  If it continues to heat up at that point it will eventually shut itself down.  Open your case and verify that your cpu fan is spinning when it's on.  If it is, go to <a href="http://www.almico.com/speedfan.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.almico.com/speedfan.php</a> and download speedfan.  That utility will tell you what temp your cpu is at, and will help you to establish if that is the problem.  If it turns out not to be the problem, there are a lot of other options, but this is the most dangerous one, so I suggest you check this one first.  If needs be, send me a message to follow up.

It continues on like this forever. <br>  <br>  If it's someone you DON'T know, then they probably find you somewhat attractive and are trying to creep your page, because if you poke them back or message them they can see your profile for a week or longer.

But I have no clue about the price because I got like a 250 gb one on sale for like $150 or $200 and I don't use it since I got a second hard drive inside my computer like a month later when my computers internal hard drive stopped working and I never really used the hard drive in my computer I tried it in my DVR box but my DVR box can only connect to certain external drives I think it only can handle like under 100 gb or something and I plugged it in but didn't use it during the free trial period but I was suggested to use seagate by a friend. I think it was and I know your money is different than ours. Like I went to Ireland, I saw these ugg boots, and I think I saw them for 80 euros or pounds I was in London Derry I believe it was when I saw them. In America the boots are usually about $100 or $120 or even $140 and I think the exchange rate when I went to the currency exchange I had to pay $2 for every $1 I wanted to have of the foreign currency and in another case $1 was worth .75 in the other currency because I had to deal with 2 currencies.|`|jU8CX1veaa	Look here for good prices.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.cclonline.com/product-categories.asp?category_id=110" rel="nofollow">http://www.cclonline.com/product-categor...</a><br>  <br>  Any drive will fail if you drop it but look for the drive with the longest warranty|`|twHXC9Draa	i suggest the apple store. they are pretty expensive but the ones that are cheap tend to be really sh**y i  really suggest it actually and they have apple stores in th3 uk|`|ROPLbLW9aa	maxtor at argos|`|rx74OkDHaa	Try Ebuyer if you shop via the web.

A related term, orphan, refers to the first line of a paragraph if it appears on its own at the bottom of a page [or column] with the remaining portion of the paragraph appearing on the following page [or column];[1] in other words the first line of the paragraph has been "left behind" by the remaining portion of text.<br>  To find out what is involved in each step,<br>  In simpler terms, a widow is generally a single line of a paragraph appearing at the top of a page and an orphan is generally a single line of a paragraph appearing at the bottom of a page.<br>  One easy way to remember the difference between an orphan and a widow is to remember that orphans "have a future but no past," while widows "have a past but no future" just as an orphan or widow in life.[2]<br>  <br>  Another way is to think of orphans as generally being younger than widows; thus, orphaned lines happen first, at the start of paragraphs (affecting and stranding the first line), and widowed lines happen last, at the end of paragraphs (affecting and stranding the last line).

NxBljj6Baa	Biggest question is if it is a dual core or single core CPU...  I wouldn't suggest even spending the money on vista if it is a single core.  Being that it only has 256mb ram leads me to believe that it is a single core processor.  Single core processors will only score 2 on the vista scale most likely, and even thought people hate the vista score, that same 2 will in reality be truely poor performing on the vista operating system...<br>  If you already have bought the system, and you already have a copy of vista, why not then, just go for it and experiment for yourself.  Newegg.com sells OEM versions of XP and Vista x32bit and x64bit for $99 shipped.

It'll be easier and cheaper to buy a new system, and by the time you upgrade that to where you want it, you'll have spent at least that much money.  You can buy a decent new machine for around $400, and to get your machine up to around those specs, (low end dual core, 2+GB ram, 250GB Hdd, etc) you'll be talking about a new motherboard, cpu, ram, hdd, pretty much everything.

Its format is:<br>  <br>      while (condition){<br>        program statement;<br>  }<br>  <br>  use it where you really need to display something whilst while condition is true.<br>  <br>  e.g. you want to display numbers less than 10<br>  int loop = 0;<br>  <br>  while (loop <=10)<br>      {<br>          print(loop);<br>          ++loop<br>      }<br>  <br>  2)do-while<br>    The do {} while statement allows a loop to continue whilst a condition evaluates as TRUE (non-zero). The loop is executed at least once.<br>  <br>  Suppose you want to reverse the digits of number.<br>  There might be case where num is just one digit long so in that case you do not need further loop execution. e.g.<br>  <br>  do<br>      {<br>          r_digit = value % 10;<br>          print( r_digit);<br>          value = value / 10;<br>      } while (value != 0);<br>  <br>  If you go with while loop in this case you will need two while loops which means extra line of codes which means more execution time which means increased complexity.Which can't <br>  be good coding practice.<br>  <br>  while (value <=0)<br>      {<br>          print(“Enter the number to be reversed.\n”);    <br>          if (value <= 0)<br>              print(“The number must be positive\n”);<br>      }<br>  <br>  while (value !=0)<br>      {<br>          r_digit = value % 10);<br>          print( r_digit);<br>          value = value / 10;<br>      }<br>  <br>  <br>  3) true<br>  <br>  simple condition which is the simplest among all<br>  <br>  if(true){<br>  do this;<br>  }<br>  <br>  it will save lines of code and execution time.(it will never go to not required lines of code)<br>  suppose<br>  <br>  we have to find whether number is less than 10,20 or 30<br>  so we can intelligently use it as<br>  <br>  if(num<10){<br>  print(yes its less than 10 and 20 and 30)<br>  }<br>  else{<br>  if(num<20){<br>  print(num is less than 20 and 30 only) <br>  }<br>  else{<br>  if(num<30){print(num is less than 30 only)}<br>  }<br>  }<br>  <br>  if lesser than 10 will not go and check at <20 or <30 which saves execution time.<br>  <br>  Hope this resolves your issues<br>  Cheers:)|`|d98d8bfb68b616f97b22344613a67cebaa	The conditional statment allows the loop to continue looping until the condition is met. Without a conditional statment you wil have an endless loop that will loop forever.<br>  <br>  Dim x as integer<br>  <br>  X will be incremented for each pass through the loop<br>  X is usually set to zero before entering the loop.<br>  <br>  Do while (X < 10)<br>  <br>  'your code goes here<br>  x = x + 1 'incremnet value of x by 1<br>  Loop<br>  <br>  OR <br>  <br>  Do<br>  'your code goes here<br>  x = x+1<br>  Loop while (X<10)<br>  <br>  The only difference between these two loops is when the conditional test performed either at the begining or end of the loop.<br>  <br>  This results in either of the two ways code is processed:<br>  <br>  1.) Do While - test the condition first then execute code in the loop if allowed<br>  <br>  2.) Loop While -  process instruction within the loop first then test conditional and loop again if required.<br>  <br>  Loop while mean that the code in the loop alway executes at least once before the conditional test is performed.<br>  <br>  Do while  test the conditional first and if it is false  to begin with  then the code in the loop is skipped over and doesn't even run once. This would happen if we set x to some value equal to or greater than 10 just before entering the Do while (x<10) statement)<br>  <br>  <br>  True statements are the result of a conditional test<br>  <br>  x = 5<br>  (x<10)  resolves to TRUE so the loop continues<br>  <br>  x = 12<br>  (X<10) resolves to FALSE so the program exits the loop|`|jLe6GDu8aa	It really depends on what programming language you are using. I will use some examples in Java to clear things up for you.<br>  <br>  A do loop (which has the while statement on the end) is a "post test loop" and is a simple loop that will execute accordingly until a certain condition is met. A do loop can be said to be good in a situation where you want a loop to execute at least once. Like this example:<br>  Do <br>  {<br>  System.out.println("Hello World!");<br>  x = x + 1;<br>  } While (x <= 10);<br>  <br>  A While loop is a "pretest loop" good for the same purposes except with the while statement will not loop once if the conditions are not met. At least, that's what I can remember from the top of my head. And Do While Loop will check the conditions for the loop before executing the loop. Here is an example of a pretest do while loop:<br>  While (x <= 10)<br>  {<br>  System.out.println("Hello World!")<br>  x = x + 1<br>  }<br>  <br>  A true statement isn't really used to create a loop and really doesn't have much to do with it, but is something that occurs to determine if a loop should be executed or not (a boolean check).<br>  <br>  I hope that clears things up for you.|`|AA11434745	A while loop may or may not execute, depending on the condition. For example, the code in this while loop will not execute because the condition is not met:<br>  <br>  $count = 0;<br>  while($count > 0) {<br>  echo "Hello World!";<br>  }<br>  <br>  A do-while loop will always execute at least once, even if the condition is not met. The following statement will echo out Hello World! once:<br>  <br>  $count = 0;<br>  do {<br>  echo "Hello World!";<br>  } while $count > 0;<br>  <br>  An if statement is evaluated only once and only executed if the condition is met. The code below will only echo out Hello World once, because the statement is evaluated only once, even though we increment the counter:<br>  <br>  $count = 1;<br>  if($count > 0) {<br>  echo "Hello World!";<br>  $count++;<br>  }<br>  <br>  You want all three because based on the programming challenge, sometimes you need to be able to do each.<br>  <br>  For example, an if statement is handy when you want to stop evaluating an expression based on a single condition, such as making sure someone provided a value in a form:<br>  <br>  if($_POST['name'] == "") {<br>  echo "Please provide a name!";<br>  }<br>  else {<br>  echo "Your name is $_POST[name]";<br>  }<br>  <br>  A do-while loop is useful when you want to ensure the statement executes at least once, but stops once a condition is met. For example, prompting a user to enter data in C++:<br>  <br>  String name;<br>  do {<br>  cout << "Please enter the word 'banana':";<br>  cin >> name;<br>  } while (name != 'banana');<br>  <br>  A while loop is useful when you have a bunch of data to be iterated, such as the results of a database query:<br>  <br>  $x = 1;<br>  $rs = mysql_query("SELECT * FROM table");<br>  while($row = mysql_fetch_array($rs)) {<br>  echo "Record no. $x: $row[column]";<br>  $x++;<br>  }|`|d31362018828604d98c25f39657fdb94aa	do while loops execute at least once (because it checks afterward), while loops don't, ... true statements.. you mean like while(true)? which is infinite?<br>  <br>  but what language are you using?|`|7bf62358ee706efffb78c25a9c7d5a00aa	A do with a while at the loop, will execute once even if the condition isn't met.  A while loop won't execute if the condition isn't met.  A true statement?  I assume you mean do while true - that executes forever unless you deliberately exit the loop (it's basically what the system idle loop does in an operating system).|`|MsZEzY7faa	The two types of while loops you mention are different in when the evaluate the exit condition. In a normal While loop the condition get evaluated first, so if the condition is already false the contents of the loop will never execute. In a do while loop the condition is checked at the end of the loop, so the contents of the loop will always execute at least once. If you want to exit the loop based exclusively on things that happen in the loop then the do while may be a better choice.

XZDjPZUTaa	Hi Firend, The device (digital camera, card reader, scanner, hard drive, cable modem, etc.) will work with the USB 2.0 ports even if the device only has a USB 1.0 or 1.1 connection. The physical connectors are exactly the same for USB 1.1 and USB 2.0. However, the device will only work at USB 1.1 speeds (12 Mbps) and not USB 2.0 speeds (480 Mbps).    Conversely, if your computer only has USB 1.0 or 1.1 ports and you would like to use a USB 2.0 device with it, the device will probably work. Again, you will only be able to transfer data at the slower USB 1.1 transfer rate. Most USB 2.0 devices are backwards compatible with USB 1.1, but for data-intensive devices (like a hard drive or iPod), the data transfer is so slow with USB 1.1, it may not even be worth using it.  I hope that i have resolved your problem|`|wcPtezrvaa	It should but I'm not to sure, i think that if it doesn't work you should update your USB or contact a technician|`|0o9X42rOaa	Yes, it will. USB 2.0 is compatible with other (slower) USB 1.0 devices. Even USB 2.0 devices can be plugged into USB 1.0 ports, but it will not be able to use the full speed of the device.|`|svtrTIz3aa	Yes But data transfer rate will be slow because of USB1.0 or 1.1 its speed less than USB2.0 speed|`|6AwwInrxaa	Yes it does.But data transfer rate will slow.
XZDjPZUTaa	Do'oh friend here your answer .Installing memory, or RAM, is a great way to improve the performance of your computer. However, there are many types of RAM, and it is important to install the correct RAM when updating your computer's memory.    For example, not all 1GB RAM memory modules are the same. Some may run at 400MHz, while others may run at 667MHz. A 1GB S DRAM chip may have 168 pins, while a SO-DIMS may only have 144. These and other differences can cause RAM to not work with your machine.    If you install the incorrect RAM in your machine, one of two things will happen. 1) The computer will boot up but will not recognize the new memory, or 2) The computer will not boot up at all. If you remove the new RAM and the computer boots up fine, it is pretty clear that the RAM is causing the problem.    While RAM chips can be defective, memory problems are usually caused by installing the wrong type of RAM. You can verify the RAM type using your computer's user guide or by searching for your computer model on websites that sell memory.    When buying RAM, it is also a good idea to make sure it has a lifetime warranty. That way, if the RAM is bad or ever has problems, you can get it replaced free of charge.  any one seems to be having difficulty less than you|`|5zSSGKBpaa	Take out the new ram and see if it will boot. Look at the all the info on the new ram (brand, amount, speed, etc) and compare it to the old ram. What do they say. They may not be compatible.  If you go to crucial.com and use the crucial memory advisor it will tell you what kind of ram you need.  If you post back that info we can help.  Good luck|`|e0c8bfb894af30592aab2ff7952f32edaa	check ur wires something might not be connected all the way or something|`|4jyPoVrnaa	not installed correctly|`|vRImZ32Maa	Make sure everything is properly inserted. I would check again, maybe you accidentally tripped something else...|`|OhOTQ0mLaa	check the bus speed if u have installed two rams.    or if u have single ram    change the slot and see|`|4PkRRHEtaa	If you mean RAM, then you probably didn't attach it right. Maybe the clamps are loose, or maybe you put it in the inverted direction.    If you mean you replaced your hard drive, then that's because you have to reinstall your operating system.|`|Uj8icNHNaa	You mean RAM?    You have to put the largest RAM in the first bank, and all other cards in descending order in the banks next to it.|`|sekPmSIqaa	It is installed incorrectly.|`|QixitbR0aa	by memory do you mean ram or hdd?  if it is ram then its probably that you didnt get the kind that is supported by your motherboard or if you tried to put too much new ram in then it might not work! and if it is hdd or hard drive then it could be you wired it wrong or that you didnt get the right kind! you see you cant just get any parts for any computer and expect them to run they have to mesh together and be able to support each other! just get your old stick of ram or your old hdd and go to tigerdirect.com and search for the exact same kind
MF1NqduEaa	If you save something on C: does it take place on D:? <br>  If yes it's just a drive letter error, which you can change pretty easily. If  no I really don't understand your problem.|`|ULw1777caa	It has nothing to do with Vista.  Sounds like you are not copying/saving to the right place even though you think you are.
0F878pKbaa	Just create a shortcut (in Windows: right-click on desktop, choose New -> Shortcut) and type in the address: for example htttp://playhousedisney.com and save the shortcut.<br>  <br>  It will have Internet Explorer's icon so it will be easy for your children to recognize :)|`|20eb9jmqaa	make sure your internet browser then drag the little icon next to the url onto your desktop|`|yvDzvIbBaa	just make an html file that links to that site.<br>  <br>  or how about install google chrome? you can set more than 1 home page.<br>  <br>  and if im not mistaken, i think you can just save the site. either in ''file'' or right click.
wO56y9BYaa	You're on the right track... you just need the right fonts and you're golden (also make sure you're looking at the "Entire Font" in the glyph palette).<br>  <br>  The right arrow you've chosen is in the font "Wingdings 3" GID:172, Unicode: F0CA.<br>  <br>  The check (I found a couple) I believe is in the font "Wingdings 2" GID:50, Unicode: F050.<br>  <br>  There are other arrows and checks in the font "Wingdings" and I also found other arrows in "Symbol (T1)".  I'm sure there are others out there, I just did a quick check with the fonts I currently have loaded.<br>  <br>  Good luck!
Nqp4zjGSaa	Make sure that you have an adequate player (such as PowerDVD). Media Player will work but you need to make sure you have downloaded the codec.|`|c1b4b7f8e314ae3b676971e55c6665dcaa	It should have come with a program that makes the DVD player work.  Nero is normally software to enable you to burn copies.  If you didn't get a second disk, the DVD operation software may be included in the Nero disk.  Make sure you load and run the Nero software and see if that helps.  Usually you have to let your computer find the new DVD player and then install the drivers and software for it.<br>  <br>  If, for some reason, you didn't get the software to make the DVD player work, download VLC software.  It's a great FREE download that makes DVDs work.  Also plays CDs.  I use it as my default media player for everything and like it much better than Windows Media Player, which does not play DVDs and is not real good at burining CDs (it uses a limited version of Roxio).

0F878pKbaa	% represents modulo mathematical operation which returns the rest from dividing two integer numbers:<br>  <br>  15 % 2 = 1<br>  15 % 3 = 0<br>  15 % 4 = 3<br>  15 % 5 = 0<br>  15 % 6 = 3<br>  10 % 3 = 1<br>  11 % 3 = 2<br>  <br>  11 / 3 = 3 (integer! so no floating point value) and the rest is 2 because 3*3 + 2 = 11. <br>  <br>  Modulo division is very often used to check if the number is odd or even. To check, just mod the number by 2 and it will return 1 if it's odd, 0 if even.

That won't work at all.<br>  <br>  Those DVI-to-component cables are intended for video cards with special DVI ports that can output a component signal.<br>  <br>  A cable box's component outputs cannot send out a digital DVI signal, so if you try to use that cable to connect a component output to a DVI monitor, you will get no image.<br>  <br>  You should call your cable company and ask for a digital HD cable box.  Digital HD Cable boxes usually have DVI or HDMI outputs, which you can connect directly to any monitor that is HDCP-compliant.

CTGHeMwPaa	Since you are opening a file that's technically no longer on the file system (it's in the JAR), you have to find it a slightly different way:  Through the classloader.<br>  <br>  Open the file this way:<br>  this.getClass().getClassLoader().<br>  getResourceAsStream(<br>  "yourfile.txt");<br>  <br>  (sorry for splitting it like this, Y!A doesn't like long lines)<br>  This returns an InputStream that you can read from.|`|75nbESJUaa	I just thot I'd mention...<br>  <br>  You can read the text (or binary) from the .jar. You can not write a text file to .jar ... that was a bitter lesson for me and a total re-write of my project to gain Preferences.<br>  <br>  Also, the .jar needs a MANIFEST and that manifest file points to the class with the main(), eg. MainFrame.main. If the .jar doesn't have that, you get null pointer exception. I can't tell you which is which without the StackTrace. Either error will tell you if its the file or if it is the main()

5ag2GyX6aa	If the games call for a minimum of a 6200 I would say you have to have that for it to run. Of course if that is the minimum the graphics, everything would more than likely be at the lowest setting. I'm not sure if there is a big difference between the 6200 and 6150, I'm sure there is not but I would say it probably would not work. Good luck. Hope this helps.

eec685f8de34940a4e941788661cddb1aa	A proxy you can see through.|`|nP9OjYxHaa	Intercepting proxy server<br>  <br>  An intercepting proxy (also known as a "transparent proxy") combines a proxy server with a gateway. Connections made by client browsers through the gateway are redirected through the proxy without client-side configuration (or often knowledge).<br>  <br>  Intercepting proxies are commonly used in businesses to prevent avoidance of acceptable use policy, and to ease administrative burden, since no client browser configuration is required.<br>  <br>  It is often possible to detect the use of an intercepting proxy server by comparing the external IP address to the address seen by an external web server, or by examining the HTTP headers on the server side.<br>  <br>  [edit] Transparent and non-transparent proxy server<br>  <br>  The term "transparent proxy" is most often used incorrectly to mean "intercepting proxy" (because the client does not need to configure a proxy and cannot directly detect that its requests are being proxied). Transparent proxies can be implemented using Cisco's WCCP (Web Cache Control Protocol). This proprietary protocol resides on the router and is configured from the cache, allowing the cache to determine what ports and traffic is sent to it via transparent redirection from the router. This redirection can occur in one of two ways: GRE Tunneling (OSI Layer 3) or MAC rewrites (OSI Layer 2).<br>  <br>  However, RFC 2616 (Hypertext Transfer Protocol -- <a href="http://1.1)" rel="nofollow">http://1.1)</a> offers different definitions:<br>  <br>      "A 'transparent proxy' is a proxy that does not modify the request or response beyond what is required for proxy authentication and identification".<br>      "A 'non-transparent proxy' is a proxy that modifies the request or response in order to provide some added service to the user agent, such as group annotation services, media type transformation, protocol reduction, or anonymity filtering"|`|oZydD2rsaa	Here's a free proxy created today:<br>   <br>  <a href="http://mcancer1.com/2/" rel="nofollow">http://mcancer1.com/2/</a><br>  <br>  -Unblock ANY Website<br>  -watch youtube videos<br>  -download up to 100 MB<br>  -hide you IP and stay anonymous<br>  -Fast and hosted on a dedicated server<br>  <br>  I get new proxies here everyday:<br>  <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Coolproxies">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Coolproxie...</a> <br>  <br>  <br>  Email me if it's not working and i'll email you a proxy that I haven't advertised yet|`|9n53vXGKaa	The Most Working PROXY 100% and easily to be Used <br>  <br>  Unblock all web around you <br>  <br>  here it is some WebSites You can use ::<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.247Web.co.cc" rel="nofollow">http://www.247Web.co.cc</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.hidden-surf.co.cc" rel="nofollow">http://www.hidden-surf.co.cc</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.xunblocker.co.cc" rel="nofollow">http://www.xunblocker.co.cc</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.2surfall.co.cc" rel="nofollow">http://www.2surfall.co.cc</a><br>  <br>  Be Sure to tell your friends or post them to your myspace page or blog so others can enjoy.<br>  <br>  Happy Surfing!

34b9306b9ca9cad997b57007c3266256aa	Adding &fmt=6 to the end of any youtube video's url will give you Youtube's new high quality setting. Changing the number from 6 to something else yields different formats though it's not obvious which numbers work. Format 18 generates an mp4 using h264 with AAC stereo, which is compatible with video iPods. This is way better than using a service like vixy.net, which transcodes the crappy quality youtube vid into an mp4. Using fmt=18, you get a video transcoded from the original clip the user uploaded. The bitrate is lower on the mp4 version, but since the resolution is smaller it compensates. The h.264 codec has better looking videos at lower bitrates anyway. We finally see stereo on youtube with the mp4 version! It has a widescreen 16/9 aspect ratio rather than 4/3.

Other files which are <br>  acceptable are AVI, MPG, MOV and WMV,<br>  which belongs to Windows Movie Maker for <br>  both XP and Vista. (If anyone suggests you<br>  format at 640x480, that is "old news" which<br>  YouTube was recommending in May of last <br>  year.)<br>  <br>  www . google . com / support / youtube / bin / answer . py ? hl = en & answer = 91450<br>  <a href="http://www.google.com/support/youtube/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=91450" rel="nofollow">http://www.google.com/support/youtube/bi...</a><br>  <br>  If you want your video to be "widescreen" at<br>  a 16:9 ratio and with the high-quality option, <br>  please consider all of this:<br>  <br>  Basically, all digital video recorders (DVR's)<br>  function using 720x480 "rectangular" pixels.<br>  Computers have lots of different resolutions, <br>  but they all utilize "square" pixels. As such,<br>  Flash "encoders" can't always compensate<br>  or properly adjust for the difference. Just as<br>  important, lots of downloaders & converters <br>  render uploaded videos "fuzzy-looking" with <br>  rather large square pixels that look as if the <br>  videos were recorded using 120x90. This is<br>  particularly noticeable when there is motion <br>  in the video, or during slide show montages<br>  when still photos/images segué in between<br>  one and another. Thus. keep your videos in<br>  their original format as much as is possible.<br>  <br>  DVR's and Hypercams are not "widescreen",<br>  nor does "widescreen" mean high-quality or<br>  high-resolution. The only thing "widescreen" <br>  really means is a "more rectangular" shape.<br>  <br>  YouTube accepts file sizes up to 1,024 MB,<br>  so it is now much easier to upload larger or<br>  HQ/HD (high-quality / high-definition) videos.<br>  Everything on YouTube is, by default, "high<br>  quality"; so you shouldn't be worrying about <br>  what you have to do in order to achieve HQ. <br>  If your video is HQ enough, it will be offered<br>  on YouTube as high-quality.<br>  <br>  YouTube's old ideal at the very beginning of <br>  summer was 640x480. It seems reasonably<br>  close to the 720x480 resolution of the DVR, <br>  but YouTube really scales all of their videos <br>  "down" to 480x360 (or 640x360 widescreen, <br>  which is the new size of the player window).<br>  <br>  Because the ratio may now also be at 16:9, <br>  those types of videos can also be uploaded <br>  at 480x270, 640x360, 864x486 or the really<br>  massive 1280x720 -- which is really overkill<br>  for no practical gain. The best option surely<br>  is 640x360. Because the aspect would still <br>  be 16:9, you might get higher-quality videos <br>  by scaling down to the lower number with a <br>  video encoder that's "high-quality", such as <br>  a codec that's H.264, Divx, Xvid or MPEG-4.<br>  This would then accomplish several results:<br>  -- a smaller file (thus faster uploading)<br>  -- YouTube also has less to "process"<br>  -- you control the final scaling of pixels<br>  -- the video gets high-quality encoding.<br>  <br>  The exact same thing is true is you were to <br>  use 480x360 for regular videos because not <br>  only would that aspect ratio still be 4:3, the <br>  height of the new player is 360 pixels.<br>  <br>  I hope that my answer helps you somehow.|`|piZ4xDBqaa	I don't know of anything you can do as an uploader to make your videos appear in high quality.

They usually come with a software for all different types of operating systems.|`|eoE4gDpSaa	any printer. Just make sure that it says that it is Vista compatible to prevent any problems.

0wUwKbHsaa	You got to school for at least a couple of years to learn how to program.  Or, if you are resourceful, you figure out how to do it on your own without resorting to asking someone else how to do it.<br>  <br>  People will be happy to help you if you have a specific problem but not if you want someone to do it for you.  I will be happy to take some consulting money to give you the specifications on that.|`|jLe6GDu8aa	First off, I want to ask, why is Java your last resort? Java is one of the higher levels of programming that works across all platforms including cellphones, something that sometimes does not support C++ or C.<br>  <br>  I'm assuming you have zero knowledge of programming. No one is going to write you that kind of program for free and if you don't know programming, it's going to take you a wile to learn how to make an application of that extreme. I recommend, if you're going to take this on yourself, perhaps you look into making something simple with Visual Basic.<br>  Visual Basic has a built in web browser tool you can use to surf web pages. It's possible you could create a timer that visits the website once per hour and then the timer resets. This type of program could probably be made in 10 minutes and requires almost no advanced knowledge of Visual Basic to complete compared to coding a web browser application in C or any of the other languages you mentioned.<br>  <br>  If it has to be in one of those upper languages, though, good luck trying to make it. You will most notably have to hire a programmer like me to create the program for you if you do not have the knowledge yourself.|`|jfVADmsEaa	First question -- what platform? "language" is a bit of a canard; it doesn't really matter.<br>  <br>  If you are on a Unix type platform, a simple shell script would do. Something like:<br>  <br>  while true; do wget <a href="http://google.com/;" rel="nofollow">http://google.com/;</a> sleep 1h; done<br>  <br>  would visit google once an hour.<br>  <br>  Now, what do you you want to DO with the data? (in the above example, index.html). If you want to parse the html, a perl script could be used.<br>  <br>  If you are using Windows(tm) as your platform, you can investigate cygwin (google it), or VMware server, or VirtualBox (again, google is your friend), or even "andLinux". These will let you run the "bash" shell, and perl, and wget.<br>  <br>  Even an experienced programmer (and ESPECIALLY an experienced programmer) would use high level tools like this to get the job done. After all, your time is the most valuable thing you have.

Who is your internet service provider?  And what is your modem brand/model number?<br>  <br>  Make sure that when you finally get your Acer laptop in a couple of weeks that it has a WIRELESS LAN installed already, this way you don't have to buy extra usb wireless adapter.  With wireless lan, you will be able to detect network within your neighborhood automatically (just as long as the wireless is switch to ON :-) ).<br>  <br>  Goodluck.|`|2SSA9e9Naa	The router will come with everything you need - I have so many cable spares, etc. from the one's I've had.<br>  <br>  This is a really good setup guide <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/using/networking/setup/wireless.mspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/using...</a>|`|3LHsCLVFaa	May or may not come with the cable.

If you don't have a router you won't be able to provide that information.<br>  <br>  So, unfortunately you do have to buy a router. Get a DLink, very dependable.|`|AVDTZ63Oaa	So.. what? you want to connect other computers to the wireless on your laptop, which will be wired to the modem? You CAN do that, but you aren't going to bother. It's a special kind of tedious.<br>  <br>  If the question is can you just decide you have wireless by telling your computer you do. No. You need to have a network to connect to, and that is usually accomplished using a Wireless router. There ARE other ways, involving wired LDAP /DHCP servers and Wireless Access points, but if this is your home network, no. You just get the router.

Some of that address space is used for I/O (i.e.PCI memory) so the not all of the 4GB can be used for memory.  That's why my PC shows 3.18GB of ram when I have 4GB installed.

zorYTX59aa	If YouTube is slow, stuck or weird, and people suggest you<br>  either change, install or get stuff....DON'T TOUCH A THING.<br>  <br>  Please don’t tinker with your "Java Scripts", "Flash Players"<br>  or different browsers -- and definitely stay away from any of<br>  the software that salespeople (disguised as answerers here<br>  on Yahoo) are trying to sucker you into buying.<br>  <br>  None of those things will help you because I am pretty sure <br>  your computer and YouTube were working fine before, right?<br>  The first rule of thumb and ideal option should always try to<br>  be: DON'T disable, erase, uninstall, switch, download, alter, <br>  add, change or install anything. Matters will only get worse.<br>  <br>  Several times each day, YouTube shuts down a few of their <br>  servers to update stuff. Be patient if YouTube is slow, stuck<br>  or mangled. Transmissions from YouTube to your computer<br>  are done in multiple tiny packets of data and flash at a time. <br>  That's why sometimes you may get any of these scenarios: <br>  bits and pieces of text/thumbnails in weird places; sluggish<br>  loading/buffering; the spinning circle going on forever; or the<br>  player being blank. This problem could fix itself within a few <br>  hours or by the next day.<br>  <br>  If your YouTube continues to behave slow, stuck or strange,<br>  it's very possible that your directories of "temporary internet <br>  files" and RAM (sometimes known as "cache") are close to<br>  the maximum and just cannot take anymore, the end result <br>  being any of the above scenarios or videos that: A) come to <br>  a complete freeze; B) start/stop/start/stop in a choppy way; <br>  or C) never even make it onto your screen.<br>  <br>  "Temporary internet files" are tiny bits of webpages that get <br>  permanently put on your hard-drive. They will remain forever<br>  on your computer, gradually plugging it up like hair stuck in <br>  a sink drain, until you finally get rid of them once and for all. <br>  Thus, exit out of YouTube, then clear your "cache" of all its<br>  "temporary internet files", "cookies" and "history". It is best<br>  if you shutdown and reboot afterwards. You'll be amazed at <br>  how "fresh" and "new" your YouTube will be.<br>  <br>  Note 1: if you are using Google Web Accelerator or a utility<br>  similar to that: dump it, burn it, trash it, disable it, uninstall <br>  it; do all that you can to get as far away from it as possible. <br>  Even though this contradicts all my advice, not only does it <br>  terribly conflict with YouTube, clicking on "Don't Accelerate <br>  This Website" won't help you whatsoever.<br>  <br>  Note 2: longer videos require both "Flash" and "Shockwave"<br>  in order to play smooth. Other than that, avoid all the sales <br>  pitches that some Yahooers may be shilling, because they <br>  are really disguised salespeople & peddlers. Their answers<br>  have nothing to do with your question, and their wares may<br>  actually worsen your problem. Besides, what kind of idiotic<br>  answer is "Although you can't even watch or access videos <br>  properly, buy our downloader." [my paraphrase]<br>  <br>  Note 3: a very odd fix that once worked for me was altering<br>  the URL from "www.youtube.com" to simply "youtube.com" <br>  (or you could even try "ca.youtube.com").<br>  <br>  Note 4: depending on how you first set up your YT account,<br>  your personal "video playblack quality" (or "VPQ") could be<br>  set to "dynamically" or "fast", thus making YouTube videos<br>  play at higher quality. This in turn eats up lots of bandwidth,<br>  memory and "cache". If you are "logged on" to YouTube as <br>  you're reading this, you can verify your VPQ from right here <br>  within Yahoo!Answers by clicking my link below, which will <br>  bring you directly to "YOUR VERY OWN" playback setting:<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/account#playback/quality" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/account#playback/...</a><br>  Otherwise, if you must "sign in" first, click on the 4th black<br>  option which will be on the left side called "Playback Setup".|`|NwxPFAUSaa	Try using Internet Cyclone from <a href="http://www.jordysoft.com/icyclone/internet-cyclone.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.jordysoft.com/icyclone/intern...</a> <br>  <br>  After optimizing with it i saw an increase in youtube.|`|uV1kllrVaa	Try refreshing the webpage<br>  <br>  or...<br>  <br>  Turn off web accelerator, if you have one - it may be conflicting with youtube.<br>  <br>  or..<br>  <br>  It could be due to slow connection or high traffic.<br>  Try watching it during off peak hours, the video will be smoother.<br>  <br>  Or you could watch it offline smoothly... try using 'zillatube' .<br>  <br>  It works well - Just google search "zillatube" to get it.<br>  <br>  ==========================???

jLe6GDu8aa	Websites are coded in the HTML or XHTML language. Web pages are stylized and designed in conjunction with CSS. Visit the following websites for more info on HTML and CSS:<br>  <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.w3schools.com/</a><br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML</a><br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Css" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Css</a><br>  <br>  XHTML (or HTML) and CSS are both client side languages. Your web browser parses the code and renders the page accordingly to how it is coded. Javascript is another good example of a simple programming language that can be parsed by your web browser. Note, Javascript is NOT the same as Java.<br>  <br>  If your looking into making a review site, you need to learn what is called a server side programming language along with your HTML and CSS skills. Server side programming languages include PHP (which you mentioned) and ASP.net. Java is also acceptable but are not really as popular as the other two languages.<br>  Lucky for me I know all three languages! If your getting into websites for the first time, I recommend you should learn PHP and MySQL database first. PHP is simple to learn, easy to write, and has a very well documented website:<br>  <a href="http://php.net" rel="nofollow">http://php.net</a><br>  <br>  MySQL database is what will be used to store your reviews. MySQL is like the wife of PHP, it's always mentioned and used with it. It's too much for me to explain what a database really is, so here's some things you can read up on about what MySQL and database is:<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_database_management_system" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_...</a><br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MySQL" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MySQL</a><br>  Learning these languages isn't easy and they take month's to learn. I recommend if you want this review site up fast you hire someone like me to get it done. Even if your interested in doing it yourself, learning XHTML, CSS, and PHP in a few month's is difficult and you do not even have the basic knowledge of what a programming language is.<br>  <br>  I hope I cleared some things up for you a little better. Of course, if you set up your own website, you can always look for open source (or closed source) review systems you can install on your site without having to look into learning any programming at all. Good luck!|`|4RJKl1aKaa	IF you're asking this kind of question is sounds as if the project is beyond you and you should get professional help with the technical aspects.<br>  <br>  HTML is not a programming language.

zorYTX59aa	How in the world can someone delete your videos and favorites?<br>  <br>  If you've got a problem, bug, issue or idea, I believe that the best<br>  email address is "support @ youtube.com".

Thus they genuinely believe <br>  that everything they do is a goodwill gesture -- including ignoring <br>  people's emails and valid user comments to their very own blogs.<br>  <br>  Because YouTube LLC has only 70 employees or so, they don't<br>  really have a "Help Center", "Support Team", or "YouTube Team".<br>  (Yes, there actually are 3 different departments with those titles). <br>  Unless you're either a broadcaster, advertiser or media company,<br>  you can also forget about trying to phone them.

WVXVeN8Gaa	I think you need to create a multidimensional array, and the way you construct such an object is solely dependent upon the language and it's respective constructs. I'm assuming you are programming in java?<br>  <br>  Example:<br>  <br>  int myArray [][][] = new int [10][10][3]; <br>  <br>  That creates an array of 300 integers, whereby values are accessed via the indices.<br>  <br>  Hope this has given you some direction.
f33xIzFWaa	it depends. some processors are equipped with a temp sensor that you can download a program that will tell you  processor temp without having to access the bios. mine doesn't so i took a thermometer with a wire lead and stuck it in the heatsink on the cpu to get a reading. if you have a heatsink and cooler fan that is working properly on your cpu u shouldn't have to worry about a heat issue unless you upgraded your processor it would be a good idea to put a better fan and heatsink on it. also the power supply box that is in your desktop usually has a fan in it as it can get very hot as well. if it is working there should be no temp issues. higher end graphics cards tend to need a cooling fan as well as they will produce more heat. case fans, if you don't have any,  can be a good investment as well because the less heat the better, but you can just take the access door off the side of your pc and leave it off to let the hardware breathe better. most of the time, when heat is an issue on a pc, it will start acting weird like freezing up or restarting for no reason, so if your computer is functioning okay, i wouldn't worry about it overheating|`|eTLG23N4aa	Every computer is different. If you're not having a problem and everything is dust free inside and all the fans are running i wouldn't worry about it.

And if you're going for Direct X 9.0, get XP, but Direct X 10.0 is the latest technology and you should be going for that, in which case get Vista. Just one thing though. Vista Business has all the features except Media Center. Personally I prefer Ultimate, but if I had to choose between Business and Home Premium, I'd go Home Premium. If i had to choose between XP and Vista, I'd choose Vista. Seriously do not listen to anyone else; Vista is great.

If it's a desktop, you need to upgrade that RAM to 2GB. Also upgrade ur hard drive and get a DVD burner because most games these days come in DVD format. You may be able to get a decent video card but it depends on your motherboard.<br>  That celeron processor is the limit to playing the newer games. You at least need a dual-core<br>  <br>  here's what u need--<br>  <a href="http://news.softpedia.com/news/Crysis-Requirements-PC-63440.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://news.softpedia.com/news/Crysis-Re...</a>|`|x1NaGF2Saa	Plain and simple: No. <br>  <br>  I could go on hours on how those specs suck and Crysis at 60 FPS+ is a dream for some computer like that, but let's keep things simple: no. <br>  On a final touch, I'd like to say that nothing would play on specs like that.

eoE4gDpSaa	like adamgoldberg said, your computer is going through POST- it's the first step that the computer goes through where it tests certain hardware. If it fails then the computer won't boot. It's just that you aren't seeing the screen and this prolly happened when you reset the BIOS settings. You may be seeing a splash screen of the manufacturer who made ur computer. When the computer first starts hit the ESC button- this usually will then display some options. This should include telling you what button to use to get into the BIOS. Common buttons are F2, Del, F10, F11, F5.<br>  Hopefully this will get you in. Once you are in some BIOS settings give you the option of disabling the splash option. Either look for this option or there will be an option for "Quick Post". Disable this setting- it will slow down the booting time of your computer by about 5 sec or so.|`|ytl2PONXaa	No POST?<br>  <br>  Actually, without POST running first then your computer wouldn't start. Go into your BIOS (either press Delete, F10, or F8 depending on the board manufacturer) and then turn off the "Show Logo at startup" option.|`|1dLHZFwMaa	Unplug everything connected to your computer. Then take out the battery and press the power button for 15 seconds so it drains all the extra power. Open up your memory slot and take both out and put them back in. Then try booting up your computer. ALSO one memory may be defective so try taking one out. And then vise versa that until it sucessfully boots on|`|3LHsCLVFaa	Remove the 2032 battery on the MoBo and have a cup of coffee. Put the battery back in and it will post
DEHN1qmraa	First, you should call RoadRunner for assistance on setting up your internet service.<br>  <br>  Your roadrunner modem connects to your main computer.<br>  <br>  You only really need a router if you have two or more computers you want to connect on your network.<br>  <br>  If you only have one computer, and it has a wireless lan, you will still need to set up your roadrunner internet network in order to get a signal, unless you are able to use another network within your neighborhood.<br>  <br>  I'd call the roadrunner first, at least that's what I would do.  They will walk you through setting your network up.  Also make sure you ask them to put a security password on your network so one else can use your network, unless you give them permission to do so.<br>  <br>  Goodluck.

AA11434745	You could go the always-professor-friendly hippie route and make a project that helps solid waste managers handle recycling. <br>  <br>  Check your local town hall for the name of the solid waste manager / transfer station manager and ask him what kinds of data he wishes he could track, or to show you his software and tell you what he likes and doesn't like about it, what it does well and what he wishes it did.<br>  <br>  Repeat for several towns in your area. The result will be the ultimate solid waste management system.<br>  <br>  Or, in many states, there's a requirement that people pay a disposal fee for certain items, such as car batteries, tires, computer parts, etc. You could develop a system that handles that. Check with your state's environmental protection department for details on what they would like to have.

awA7naBoaa	For non-extreme gaming this is a very good computer.  I hope you have fun with it!|`|AA10089212	I just built from the 1366 i7 processor.  I had the processor you want to get.  But honestly the i7 is replacing the core 2 series.  Why would you want to go backwards.  The only things that cost more are motherboard and processor for i7.  Everything else is the same.  If I were you I wouldn't build from something older and that will soon be phased out.|`|J18hyURQaa	Yeah, looks pretty good to me. The only thing you might want to watch is your hard drive size. Even if you aren't a hardcore gamer, you might want more space than 250 gigs for music and such. But if 250 is all you need, than I would say looks like a pretty good rig.

3LHsCLVFaa	That depends on the document does it not? Basic example the King James bible compressed is about 1.4meg|`|nUvy2g64aa	Yeah you can't answer that. You can predict by looking at your saving habits, like the memory card in your camera for example say mine says I can take 1000 pictures its based on your saving habits, like how clear I want my picture to be if I have it on the highest setting if I could get 1000 pictures if I have half the quality and size I may be able to get 2000 and if I switch settings on and off its not really easily possible to figure out how many pictures will fit on that card.
nGUeZDJcaa	I would recommend the E7400 and GTX.  The graphics card is going to make a much bigger difference in games than that processor difference is.  Are you planning to Overclock, because if so, the 8400 overclocks nicer than the 7400 to my knowledge.  Either way tho, I would go with a slightly lower end cpu and a faster graphics card.|`|CGfEZV45aa	ok go with the 9800GTX+. now solely for the sake of pissing you off Im going to tell you to get a 4850 instead unless  you plan on playing crysis during which the 9800GTX+ had slightly better performance but lost in some other games, or even better an ATI 3870x2 which performed better than both. and if you didn't need any suggestions then you wouldn't have posted this question in the first place, since the video card has much more of an impact on gaming performance than the CPU. oh but Im sure your highness knew that didn't he?|`|twHXC9Draa	it must be pretty clear that you don't really care for anyone's opinion because your choices are so narrow even a child could choose between those choices! why did you ask that on yahoo answers when this is a place designed for opinion?<br>  wow whaT country are you from?|`|SNZ88BfKaa	I also vote for the better graphics card.

zorYTX59aa	If YouTube is slow, stuck or weird, and people suggest you<br>  either change, install or get stuff....DON'T TOUCH A THING.<br>  <br>  Please don’t tinker with your "Java Scripts", "Flash Players"<br>  or different browsers -- and definitely stay away from any of<br>  the software that salespeople (disguised as answerers here<br>  on Yahoo) are trying to sucker you into buying.<br>  <br>  None of those things will help you because I am pretty sure <br>  your computer and YouTube were working fine before, right?<br>  The first rule of thumb and ideal option should always try to<br>  be: DON'T disable, erase, uninstall, switch, download, alter, <br>  add, change or install anything. Matters will only get worse.<br>  <br>  Several times each day, YouTube shuts down a few of their <br>  servers to update stuff. Be patient if YouTube is slow, stuck<br>  or mangled. Transmissions from YouTube to your computer<br>  are done in multiple tiny packets of data and flash at a time. <br>  That's why sometimes you may get any of these scenarios: <br>  bits and pieces of text/thumbnails in weird places; sluggish<br>  loading/buffering; the spinning circle going on forever; or the<br>  player being blank. This problem could fix itself within a few <br>  hours or by the next day.<br>  <br>  If your YouTube continues to behave slow, stuck or strange,<br>  it's very possible that your directories of "temporary internet <br>  files" and RAM (sometimes known as "cache") are close to<br>  the maximum and just cannot take anymore, the end result <br>  being any of the above scenarios or videos that: A) come to <br>  a complete freeze; B) start/stop/start/stop in a choppy way; <br>  or C) never even make it onto your screen.<br>  <br>  "Temporary internet files" are tiny bits of webpages that get <br>  permanently put on your hard-drive. They will remain forever<br>  on your computer, gradually plugging it up like hair stuck in <br>  a sink drain, until you finally get rid of them once and for all. <br>  Thus, exit out of YouTube, then clear your "cache" of all its<br>  "temporary internet files", "cookies" and "history". It is best<br>  if you shutdown and reboot afterwards. You'll be amazed at <br>  how "fresh" and "new" your YouTube will be.<br>  <br>  Note 1: if you are using Google Web Accelerator or a utility<br>  similar to that: dump it, burn it, trash it, disable it, uninstall <br>  it; do all that you can to get as far away from it as possible. <br>  Even though this contradicts all my advice, not only does it <br>  terribly conflict with YouTube, clicking on "Don't Accelerate <br>  This Website" won't help you whatsoever.<br>  <br>  Note 2: longer videos require both "Flash" and "Shockwave"<br>  in order to play smooth. Other than that, avoid all the sales <br>  pitches that some Yahooers may be shilling, because they <br>  are really disguised salespeople & peddlers. Their answers<br>  have nothing to do with your question, and their wares may<br>  actually worsen your problem. Besides, what kind of idiotic<br>  answer is "Although you can't even watch or access videos <br>  properly, buy our downloader." [my paraphrase]<br>  <br>  Note 3: a very odd fix that once worked for me was altering<br>  the URL from "www.youtube.com" to simply "youtube.com" <br>  (or you could even try "ca.youtube.com").<br>  <br>  Note 4: depending on how you first set up your YT account,<br>  your personal "video playblack quality" (or "VPQ") could be<br>  set to "dynamically" or "fast", thus making YouTube videos<br>  play at higher quality. This in turn eats up lots of bandwidth,<br>  memory and "cache". If you are "logged on" to YouTube as <br>  you're reading this, you can verify your VPQ from right here <br>  within Yahoo!Answers by clicking my link below, which will <br>  bring you directly to "YOUR VERY OWN" playback setting:<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/account#playback/quality" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/account#playback/...</a><br>  Otherwise, if you must "sign in" first, click on the 4th black<br>  option which will be on the left side called "Playback Setup".|`|0a92a06fb2c7565638777b7ba8574ec0aa	Have you the latest version of the Flash Player?

Defragmenter reorganizes these files back to their original place.|`|bLuFKxQNaa	Whenever you download lots of files ( or delete them for that matter ) the HDD is likely to get fragmented, which means files are not stored contiguously on the drive. In the graphic display, they appear as red lines. As a result, each time you want to open that file, the HDD has to work even more to gather all the fragments and read it. This is called fragmentation and causes the system to slowdown.<br>  The solution is to defrag the HDD as often as depending on the rate at which it gets fragmented. The defragger will put fragmented files back together contiguously improving data access time and speed. Defragged or contiguous files appear as blue lines.

jLe6GDu8aa	You obviously have no idea of how a computer game works or what programming is. There's too much for one person to explain here so I will just give you some basics.<br>  <br>  If you want to get into making your own games, I highly recommend you check XNA Game Studios:<br>  <a href="http://creators.xna.com/en-US/" rel="nofollow">http://creators.xna.com/en-US/</a><br>  <br>  XNA is a special "framework" that allows you to create games for the PC and Xbox 360. The best part is, it's 100% free to make PC games with! But don't get excited yet, as there is some things you need to know before downloading.<br>  First off, you need to learn C#. C# is a programming language developed by Microsoft that allows you to code programs, software, and games. The first tool you will need to make games in XNA is Visual Studio C# Express Edition:<br>  <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/Express/" rel="nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/Express/</a><br>  <br>  But based off of your knowledge, I think C# and XNA are way over your head and you will probably get confused as hell trying to set it up. For that reason, I think that before you even consider getting into coding games, you should learn Visual Basic. Download Visual Basic from the following link:<br>  <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/Express/VB/" rel="nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/Express/VB/</a><br>  <br>  Learn to code simple programs in Visual Basic and go from there. Do your own research on how games work and look into the terminology behind game programming and how games work. Find some tutorials on Visual Basic and go from there.<br>  If you find Visual Basic too complicated, XNA and C# are way over your head, and maybe game development isn't your thing. Of course, if your young (14 or younger) give it some time and don't give up on it if you enjoy the idea of learning to program. Once you get around 16, programming will make more sense and you can take some basic programming classes up in high school.<br>  <br>  I hope that helps.|`|4yNhkOBzaa	I'm not sure what you're talking about...<br>  <br>  Video games are made on computers, using special programming languages. Once it's made, it can be written *to* a CD, but there are no CDs that will make a program for you.<br>  <br>  Unless you mean a programming language learning program. I'm sure you can buy that anywhere.|`|ApOeJ0KBaa	Game programming is not that easy. To make a quality game, it takes years of focus on learning the programming language and then implementing the graphics, physics, artificial intelligence etc. If you really want to make a game and not have to write thousands of lines of code, I suggest Multimedia Fusion.|`|d98d8bfb68b616f97b22344613a67cebaa	there are several books on "Video Game programming for teens" available on amazon.com or check your local library.<br>  <br>  Combine a book with Microsofts free Visual Express programming languages and you should have all the information you need .

In addition, you will probably need DVD Shrink to compress the movies to 4.7 GB.  Upon completion of these tasks, you will need a program that burns to DVDs.  A great free program for this is called BurnAware Free Edition.  When burning use the Data Disc option and make sure you include the VIDEO_TS and AUDIO_TS folders.  Also, you can get movies off the internet, a place in which you can safely do this is <a href="http://rapidshare.com/," rel="nofollow">http://rapidshare.com/,</a> you will need to subscribe to their services.  If you are willing to try a less safer place and is free, then you can try a place like thepiratebay.org or mininova.org.

You should have SP 3 installed.  This probably is not your problem, but if you get back up and running, update your Op System.<br>  <br>  Your blue screen can be caused by many things.  There should be codes at the bottom of the screen.  Use another computer to look them up online, and they will give you an idea what's wrong.<br>  <br>  The blue screen you described is usually due to some hardware failure, however, so unhook any new hardware you may have installed recently.  If that doesn't help, check your RAM by installing only one stick at a time until you determine that they work.  By the way, you probably have 4 GB, not 4 MB.  Hopefully, RAM is causing your problem since replacing RAM is cheap and easy.<br>  <br>  If none of this works, it could be just about anything, from a harddrive going bad to a motherboard problem.
1YBo8yhOaa	Depends on how old the floppies are and what type they are:<br>  <br>  3.5 in floppies have a effective life (being able to read the data) of approximately 5 years, longer if they are high quality and/or were written by a high quality disk drive.  This assumes that they were stored properly.<br>  <br>  5.25 in floppies have less, perhaps 3 years effective life... longer if high quality, etc.  This assumes that they were stored properly.<br>  <br>  If the floppy disks have been stored properly (not in sunlight, not a excessively high temperature, dust free, etc) you shouldn't need to clean them.  If you do need to clean them, use canned air.  Do not use any chemicals or alcohol, they could destroy the disk or the housing.<br>  <br>  Lastly if they weren't stored properly, and they are more than a few years old, they will make great coasters.

I think this is what you're running into.  What I did is erased all that U3 stuff, and left the flash drive empty.<br>  <br>  WARNING:  If you have put anything on the flash drive already, this will erase it.  Make sure you haven't put anything on it that you don't have somewhere else.<br>  <br>  Option 1 : I think there's an option in the Cruzer software that it loads on your computer to "Just use it as a portable drive."  I'm not sure how to get to it, I did this to mine a long time ago.  You can also try this second step.<br>  <br>  Option 2 : You should go to "(My) Computer," right-click on the flash drive, and select "Format."  This will get rid of the software that comes pre-installed on those flash drives.  Some people might find a use for it, but I find it annoying.  All I want to do is move my files to my flash drive, and then copy them off somewhere else.|`|8YVo2Wogaa	I don't understand.<br>  <br>  You have some pictures.

I recommend Western Digital My Book Essential Edition 1 TB USB 2.0 External Hard Drive.  Up to 285,000 digital photos   Up to 250,000 songs (MP3)   Up to 25,000 songs (uncompressed CD quality)   Up to 76 hours of Digital Video (DV)   Up to 440 hours of DVD quality video   Up to 120 hours of HD video   One gigabyte (GB) = one billion bytes. One terabyte (TB) = one trillion bytes. Total accessible capacity varies depending on operating environment.    Easy to set up, easy to use - Installation is a snap because you don't really install this drive, you just plug it in and it's ready to use.   USB 2.0 interface - A simple connection that offers convenience and compatibility among multiple computers.   Fits right in - Takes no more space than a paperback book. Collect two or more and they nest neatly together like volumes on a shelf.   Smart and energy efficient - Turns itself on and off with your computer.   PC and Mac compatible - Works with both Windows? 2000/XP/Vista and Mac?

Keep that in mind. Frankly with a relic like that I wouldn't invest much in it, a 120 GB drive would probably be your best bet. As for a video card. Even the most lowly PCI card on the market would be bottlenecked by the CPU, so just go with the cheapest one you can find. A geforce 5200 or ATI 1300 would be likely candidates.

IF the picture is already on facebook, click the thing on the bottom left under the picture that says "tag this photo" and click on the person you want to tag, if the person isn't one of your friends just go ahead and finish typing it in and click tag.  When you are finished click "done tagging"  and it should be tagged!  ..Hope it helped--Happy Facebooking!|`|d389a61d8ff6f00ba94f15043f6ffa32aa	you have to sign in first,then just click on the tag photo option that is usually under each photo.|`|1glKIE5Baa	click on the photo you want to tag....underneath "share +" there is 'tag photo'    click the cursor on who you want to tag and start writing their name and it should come up....then click done tagging    simple as|`|MFjbr8t4aa	You should have the option when you are looking at someones photos, or at your own photos.

You have to look below the picture to the right of the comment box there is a little option of 'tag photo' left click this and your mouse will turn into a cross, place this in the middle of the person you wish to tag's face and left click. A box will come up with a list of all your current facebook friends, you can either start typing their name and facebook will automatically narrow it down to possible people or browse through yourself then click the box beside the name of the person you wish to put the tag as. If you do not have the person as a friend on facebook then you can just write their name however the tag will not provide a link to their profile page. Follow this through with however many people you wish to tag in a photo once you are done click 'done tagging' which will be in a highlighted box above the photo.    I hope this has been helpful.|`|DBmv0cxpaa	under the photo you want to tag, there will be a 'TAG PHOTO' button, press on it, and you will know the rest

OaQWUfNoaa	Short answer...No. Of course he claims to be- he's probably phishing and going to try and scam money from you- and the fact that this person has apparently emailed a girl for supposed charity purposes I would be highly suspicious. It would be incredibly unlikely that a celebrity would have a visible Facebook profile- if they had one at all, or that they would allow people to Friend Request.    Anyway, I just did a quick search on Facebook, and came up with an excess of 40 Daniel Craig profiles- all using shots that are available anywhere online- why should you think your 'friend' would be real.

b8tgCAQJaa	Yes, if the CD-R is still in good condition, no if the CD-R is damaged or has deteriorated (as some do with the passage of time).<br>  <br>  The black surface doesn't make any difference. It looks black to human eyes, but is still completely transparent to the laser of a DVD or CD drive.|`|bBTCDNrvaa	It should be able to if it is a cd... I know PS1 game bottoms have black bottoms...

All DVD players can play CDs too.|`|bwKZ8MWWaa	No only to a DVD|`|x2cKYj10aa	Black CDs used to be used on certain games consoles. when that console was obsolete lots of black CD-Rs were sold cheap. At the time most CD drives were very slow. Some of the faster new drives may have problems. at the time most CD-Rs read and wrote them, but I found  some of the old black discs lost recorded data after some years.
NxwTTbOqaa	There is definitely some information that can be retrieved if you are connected to the same router.<br>  <br>  Things like your external IP, MAC address, and other details are easily visible. And there is really nothing you can do about this (firewalls help, but the owner of the router can still see this info).<br>  <br>  However, unless somebody was really out to get you, there is really no harm.<br>  <br>  The only other thing I can recommend, is to going to Control Panel --> Network Connections --> Right clicking on your local area connection --> Click Properties --> Look for "File and Printer Sharing for Microsoft Networks" in the little list --> Uncheck the box<br>  <br>  This will avoid any unwanted people accessing your computer in a more harmful manner<br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|OsH2JR9oaa	Yes you can but you can only view folders/directories over a network (computers connected to the same router) that are shared, so if you don't share them then you're fine. You can check whether they are shared or not by right clicking them and selecting the share option.<br>  <br>  Also, if you have a firewall a lot of the time it automatically prevents people from accessing your computer over a network even if you have shared your folders/directories.|`|wMXsyQRwaa	yes disconnect|`|RR4oRK4Paa	You can see it unless you have a firewall.  Make sure your windows firewall is on.|`|99fdbfa38b29b528e550ba0d90f2541faa	yup you cant prevent it jst disconnect it|`|ziVpIxQ9aa	fire wall|`|Byu9MqZJaa	Yup there are a couple easy ways to keep people from seeing what's on your computer. First of all if you have file sharing off:<br>  <br>  Control Panel --> Network and Sharing Center --> <br>  <br>  Network Discovery Off<br>  <br>  File Sharing Off<br>  <br>  They won't be able to see anything.<br>  <br>  Also for extra security you can just keep your firewall enabled. <br>  <br>  Control Panel --> Windows Firewall<br>  <br>  There you go!|`|41TC427gaa	yes and idk
DSZGuWAeaa	No do not touch it.<br>  The D partition is only for backup and restore files<br>  Your system will manage the files accordingly.<br>  Do not save any of your files to the D drive either.<br>  personal files and folders or songs etc.  the drive was created for back up and restore.  If you start changing things in the file you could inadvertently damage your recovery process.|`|AA10845522	LEAVE IT ALONE<br>  Recovery D is a partition on your hard drive that contains all the information (OS & programs) that originally came with your computer. If for some reason you need to do a restore or reformat back to when the computer was new, this is what you will need.<br>  C is the drive that you use on a daily basis. Ignore D.
901930fc8f0cb1ce4a9483207715497baa	Give it a couple of minutes, if it was low on battery power it needs to charge before the computer will pick it up.<br>  <br>  If that doesn't work then your may need to restore it.|`|CO00v6ojaa	Do u have the software that make your computer recognize the itouch<br>  maybe that is why your computer don't read the itouch|`|OD9cXTTTaa	ive had the same problem, try moving around the usb and the ipod where it connects to the wire.

c1b4b7f8e314ae3b676971e55c6665dcaa	Let your computer's op system find the correct drivers.  Windows XP and above probably already usable drivers copies to your hard drive.  You shouldn't need the CD install disk.<br>  <br>  If the drivers are not already on your hard drive, Windows should find them on the interrnet and download and install them for you.  <br>  <br>  If not, find out what type they are and due a manual search for them.  Try the download site for the brand of computer you have first, then go to  DriverGuide.com if you have to.|`|CtgBMZewaa	Please go here to get a walkthrough of installing the driver that you need...<br>  <a href="http://jwizcomphelp.piczo.com/?cr=5" rel="nofollow">http://jwizcomphelp.piczo.com/?cr=5</a>
eZDoQPg8aa	I'd look hard at #2 - I have a gaming system with the quad core and it's awesome.  And it is the AMD Phenom.  There is not any software out YET that truly takes advantage of the quad but it's coming and you'll be ready to use them when it does.  And I personally like NVidia graphics cards better.  No real reason, just have always had them and have always been happy with them.|`|026n1P1paa	I would say computer 2 but for gaming i use XP x64 edition.  Computer 2 would be better for gaming because in my opinion, Nvidia makes way better graphics cards than ATI and the quad core can handle games more easily|`|CtgBMZewaa	It depends if these are notebooks or desktops...<br>  <br>  For notebooks:<br>  <a href="http://products.amd.com/en-us/NotebookCPUResult.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://products.amd.com/en-us/NotebookCP...</a><br>  <br>  For desktops:<br>  <a href="http://products.amd.com/en-us/DesktopCPUResult.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://products.amd.com/en-us/DesktopCPU...</a><br>  <br>  Check off which two you are comparing, and post up the results.<br>  <br>  Do the same to compare the two graphic cards...<br>  <a href="http://products.amd.com/en-us/default.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://products.amd.com/en-us/default.as...</a><br>  <br>  Click "(notebook/desktop) graphic cards, and once again, check off the two that you are comparing, and post that up, possibly as a separate Question.  Then we can see.........|`|W0EM8kgzaa	computer 2, i do not like 64x bit systems, and i personally like Nvidia more than ATI|`|OIC0vsEWaa	well i love the phenoms, so i would go with the second one. quad cores are definitely the way to go. check out the retail Phenom 9850 BE on newegg. you can get it for less than a OEM regular 9850. this gives you room to overclock if you want in the future.<br>  <br>  but really, they are both very similar.<br>  <br>  both of these have video cards that are low to medium-low quality. i would splurge a little bit and go for a GeForce 9800 GT. gets you a much better gfx card.<br>  <br>  you need a motherboard. and a case and a power supply that matches all of your components. and a monitor and keyboard and mouse. also, what are you doing for cooling systems (ie fans)?<br>  <br>  ram: try to get it to run in pairs of identical ram. you are less likely to have problems that way.<br>  <br>  overall, they are both fine. you should be able to play less intensive games without any problem. i like comp #2 better though.

AA10845522	"The morons at Dell Outsourcing tell me it's not possible."  And they are correct. <br>  You are going to have 2 problems:<br>  1. Your case is a slim line case. The 9800 video card will not physically fit in it. You need a low profile card to fit in that case.<br>  2. As you noted, you need a larger power supply to run the above card (if you can find one). The power supply in that case is proprietary - meaning that is is a "special" size. It is a "TFX" power supply.<br>  If I were you, I'd think about "gutting" and abandoning that case and move all the contents over to a full size case that will physically hold the 9800GT card and a full size power supply. It is the Dell case/power supply that is making this upgrade impossible.|`|c1b4b7f8e314ae3b676971e55c6665dcaa	Did the Dell guys say why?

33E6UDx5aa	Go to Vista's Network & Sharing Center, sort out your permissions on the network from here. Setting "Network Discovery" to on, "File Sharing" to on, "Public Folder" sharing to on aswell, and the other few options if you need them.    Before you go any further, you need to make sure. Either your router has wireless disabled, or, you have a very strong encryption key on it. As it would be easy for anyone to scout out your wireless network and see your PC.    Now, find the folder you would like to share right click it, and click "Share", now click the "Advanced Sharing" button, then tick the box saying "Share this folder", then click apply. Now the "Permissions" will have become unlocked and you need to set them and you set this to whatever you want the other person on the network using Win Xp to be able to do. Then click Apply.    Now go to the Win Xp computer and go to the Network tab, you should be able to see the vista Computer, and in the tab you'll see what folders are shared. If you cannot see the vista comp make sure it's set to discoverable on the Vista Network & Sharing Center. There's no other reason you should not see it.(You might have to set the firewall aswell, there'll be a help button located around the share tab to help you do this, if it does not do it by itself).    On the Win Xp, find whatever folders you want to share & fight click them then go to the share button, enable file sharing and apply, sort out the permissions if you need too.    I'm using vista myself and I'm not exactly sure on the procedure on Xp, but right click and go to the share button you'll find the permissions somewhere around there too.    I wish you goodluck.|`|GTNHrS4paa	instead of connecting via a router connect the 2 PC,s with LAN directly  the share a folder on one pc and enter the 1st PC,s ip address in 2nd pc to access it then copy normally...(process is-----------in RUN>>>>type "  \\ xxx.xxx.x.xx  " and then enter his should work      enjoy|`|nym3w7VRaa	You already have made a network.

I'd start with a few DVD-RWs - that way, when you screw up the first one, you can use it again.  Once you know what you're doing, you can save a few cents each by using DVD-Rs - you can only write to them once.

f33xIzFWaa	maybe your antivirus is not very good and has developed an issue. i have used crummy antivirus software in the past and it has failed or didn't pick up on a virus as it should. you could try another av software to see. you would have to delete the one you have to install a new one as having more than one antivirus software can cause issues with your computer. Bitdefender was rated #1 by consumer reports in 2009 so i decided to try it out and i am much happier with it then i was with norton it costs like 40 dollars if i remember correctly but there is also a free version that doesn't have as many features but it gets the job done. you can find it at www.filehippo.com. also the same site has a antispyware software that i find to be very effective, more so than others i've tried and its free too. it is called a squared free. go there and type in those names in the search bar at the top left corner. u won't be disappointed, i promise|`|CtgBMZewaa	Please visit the company's website.|`|gZqXzMO7aa	best bet is to get a mac so you dont need virus protection like me!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!11

Do you need to take your computer on the go?  If so, laptop is the obvious choice.  If you don't, desktops are faster, cheaper, and easier to upgrade.  <br>  <br>  Odds are that the reason your laptop won't charge is because it has a broken DC Jack.  You know where you plug the charger into the laptop?  Plug it in and wiggle it around a little bit, it should have a LITTLE play, but not a lot.  If that's broken, the charger cannot make a connection to the motherboard to power the system, charge the battery, or anything.  Try this, if your mom has the same laptop.  Charge her battery up a bit, and then plug it into yours.  Does your system turn on with that?  If so, 90% chance that's your problem.  It CAN be fixed by someone who knows what they're doing.  Geek Squad and other guys like that won't do it, but any good compuer repair shop should have someone who can solder that back to working.  Probably run you about $75 to $150.  Good luck!|`|6B7ALmafaa	Good question! <br>  <br>  If you need the laptops portability, chose the laptop. <br>  If you don't, chose the desktop.<br>  Why? Because for an equally priced desktop and laptop, the desktop will be faster, and more comfortable to use. Also, if both the laptop and desktop have the same technical specifications, the desktop will be much cheaper.<br>  <br>  Your laptop probably isn't broken. But the connector for the power cable maybe. If you still have warranty, you could get it fixed or replaced.|`|IKlHn1EJaa	first of all, a laptop is a computer. I think you mean desktop.<br>  But uhhh...can't really anwers your first question as it really depends on what you're planning to use it for...|`|XItuKiZSaa	If it's not cost effective to fix, you can sell it online|`|73P1Al4saa	The purchase will depend on your needs, whether just work and recreation, or on the go. Just for home i'd go with desktop, but if you're on the go all the time, then laptop.<br>  You will pay more a laptop, and upgrading is very limited and more costly. Get whichever will fit you budget and life style better, but also make sure it can handle all your needs, and can grow as you do.<br>  <br>  As far as the laptop charger, it could be your plug on the back has broke the circuit connection. your best bet is to take into a shop that specializes in laptop repairs, and have them test it.

Explorer is the program that is basically the foundation of your entire ability to interface with your computer.  There's a lot of potential causes and fixes, but odds are, you'll probably end up needing to repair/reinstall Windows.  Sorry to be the bearer of bad news, but most systems don't come back from that easily.  A repair install of windows will allow you to keep your data and programs though.  I recommend you do a virus scan/removal asap when you get it back up and running.  A lot of viruses out there will cause what you're seeing.  Good luck!

ZvkUBNOtaa	You don't say if the connection on the laptop is wireless or wired.  It makes a difference.<br>  <br>  What's happening is that the power controls on the laptop are powering down the network adapter, apparently the BIOS isn't powering it back up when you wake up the computer and try to use the connection.  This is a common problem, not all BIOS's handle the suspend functions of the ACPI well and if you have any external devices plugged into the laptop that's most likely why.  External keyboards, mice, USB/Firewire drives etc can interfere with this function.<br>  <br>  Go to "Start/Control Panel/Power Options" and click the blue text that says "Change Plan Settings" on whatever power plan you're using on the laptop.  Click the drop down box behind "Put the computer to sleep" and click on "Never".  That will stop your computer from going to sleep which will definitely disconnect you.  Do this because I assume if  you want it connected all the time you have the laptop plugged into external power and not running on the battery.<br>  <br>  Next click on the blue text that says "Change advance power settings", click the plus sign next to "Wireless Adapter Settings" and then the plus sign next to "Power Saving Mode" .  Change that setting to "Maximum Performance"  Click the "OK" button.  Click on the "Save Changes" button to close Power Options.<br>  <br>  Right click "Computer" in the Start Menu and select "Properties" from the context menu that pops up.  In the left side of the window that pops up, click on the text that says "Device Manager".<br>  <br>  In the Device Manager window find the entry labeled "Network Adapters" and click the plus sign next to it.  That should display all of the network adapters on the system, both wireless and wired.  Right click the adapter(s) and select the "Power Management" tab.  Uncheck the box that says "Allow the computer to turn off this device to save power."  Click on the "OK" button.  Do the same for all the network adapters listed.<br>  <br>  Some computers may show wireless adapters in their own entry so you'll have to find it and do the same thing there, if the entry exists.<br>  <br>  That will keep your network connection 'live' like on a desktop computer.<br>  <br>  You can experiment with the Power Options in Control Panel and create different 'plans' for when you're connected to external power and when you're running on the battery.  Leaving the power on all the time to the adapters will shorten run time on battery by 3-5% depending on how much you actually use the network.  Not a big deal and if you don't really need that little bit of extra run time then don't worry about it.<br>  <br>  Good luck and Happy Computing
FBQZ06vraa	Since you don't say what DOES happen, only what DOESN'T happen, I've got to guess.  First thing I see is that this code:<br>  <br>  while(r == 'Y')<br>  {<br>  printf("Happy Birthday, \"%s\"! :-)\n", &string);<br>  getc(stdin);<br>  }<br>  <br>  will loop forever.  It doesn't change the value of r inside the While loop, so it never exits.  You probably want an if() statement, not a while.  Ditto for the second loop.<br>  <br>  Second, if the user enters a lower case y or n, neither loop will print anything out.  I suspect this is what you're seeing -- nothing.<br>  <br>  You have to figure out a way to handle both upper and lower case letters.<br>  <br>  Finally, just to play Devil's Advocate, what happens if the user enters something other than the four legitimate values?  Real life programming has to take such things into account.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps.|`|715f8a57435bf66b324f94e65dec6359aa	The Phlebob's points are all absolutely valid. However, the initial problem you're seeing is that you're not telling the system to wait until someone presses a key before seeing if they've pressed Y or N. So, it just plows straight through, not matching either. You need to use a different function, which will wait for a keypress. I'll leave it to you to find out which one.

ZvkUBNOtaa	No, you won't lose any data when you change the RAM.  <br>  <br>  RAM is  called "volatile memory" and that basically means that what's in it "evaporates" when the power is shut down to the system.  The hard disk in your computer also has a volatile memory called "cache" that clears on power off.  The actual data is stored on the hard drive and that's NOT volatile, it's a physical data write to the platter on the drive that's "persistent". This is why, among other things, you should always shut down the computer properly via the Start/Shutdown controls on the Start Menu.  Data is held in the volatile areas and needs to be written back to the hard drive before power off.<br>  <br>  As for what kind of RAM to get, that's very important.  Not all RAM works with all computers, there are many different kinds of RAM.  For the best results I recommend going to NewEgg.com and running their RAM configurator.  I'm a computer contractor and I use NewEgg all the time, they're great, cheap, and will help you with returns etc. if you goof.  <br>  <br>  The configurator is on the left side of this page, along with todays specials on RAM:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Store/Category.aspx?Category=17&name=Memory" rel="nofollow">http://www.newegg.com/Store/Category.asp...</a><br>  <br>  Choose a platform like Desktop, Laptop, Motherboard etc and click the GO button.  The configurator will walk you through finding RAM that will work on your system.<br>  <br>  Even if you don't buy the RAM from NewEgg, running the configurator will tell you what you need so you can shop around or go to a computer store and tell them what you want.<br>  <br>  UPDATE:<br>  <br>  What Duderino says is absolutely correct, however if you run that configurator it will determine the correct number of slots, speed, etc.  Many motherboards can take more than one speed of RAM.|`|dkpIjt5jaa	No, files are on your Hard Drive and CMOS memory is protected by a battery.<br>  <br>  Your RAM is just a temporary memory holder !<br>  <br>  Since you are looking at Kingston, go here: <a href="http://www.ec.kingston.com/ecom/configurator_new/mfrmod.asp?root=us&LinkBack=http://www.kingston.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.ec.kingston.com/ecom/configur...</a><br>  <br>  Enter your machine's manufacturer, exact model number and it will tell you everything about your PC needed RAM (including maximum memory for each connector and total amount for your system).|`|xvuAQ0DAaa	That's a huge upgrade, is it an older computer, if so it might not be able to take that much?

Storage (hard drive) and RAM are not related.  Practically, especially with your limited knowledge of computer hardware, I'd be certain my data is backed up before doing any upgrade.  Now that that's settled, the suggestion about newegg.com is a good one.  You need to be sure your motherboard can handle 2gig of RAM and that your operating system is capable of taking advantage of it.|`|AA12041546	I think you got your answer but listen to the other posters as well.<br>  VERY IMPORTANT:<br>  Look up the specs for your motherboard and make sure it is capable of handling 2GB of ram.<br>  <br>  When you know the max ram, look for how many ram slots you have.<br>   Divide max ram by number of slots. This is the max ram for each slot. So if your max ram is 2GB and you have 4 ram slots, then the max ram for each slot is 512mb. (so you would want to get 4 X 512MB and not 2 X 1 GB).<br>  <br>  Also, be sure to get the same type of ram.

Apple doesn't even sell routers...

WQ0DzpByaa	Make the CD-Rom a slave.|`|c1b4b7f8e314ae3b676971e55c6665dcaa	I've never seen a motherboard with only one IDE port.  But if you have to use one port and one cable to connect both the hard drive and CD player, then you have to make sure you have the hard drive on the end cable connector and the CD on the middle cable connector.  Also make sure you have the hard drive jumper set as master and the CD jumper set as Slave.  Some computers will allow the CD jumper to be CS but not all.|`|CmfmEzb5aa	Having your CD and HDD on the same IDE cable is really not a good idea, and having them both set to master is an even worse idea. This will be the reason for it freezing, it can't understand which device is the master and is probably trying to write data to the master which it is confusing as the CD drive.<br>  <br>  For it to have any chance of working, set the HDD to master and the CD to Slave, then try again, I am assuming that the motherboard has SATA if it only has 1 IDE, I strongly advise you to get a SATA drive before installing anything on a permanent basis.|`|QGMdsrKfaa	YES that could be the problem.On any system if you are on the same IDE then the "boot" device has to be set for "master with slave" if you set it for "master only" it will not recognize the second device or it will but you'll have many problems with it.<br>  The second device can be set to CS(cable select) or SL(slave).I prefer SL because a computer always does what you specifically tell it to do.

1YBo8yhOaa	Without being about to look over your shoulder and see exactly what's happening, it's really difficult to diagnose given your description of the state of your computer.  <br>  <br>  Does it ask about booting into safe mode when you turn the computer on?  If it doesn't, you aren't in safe mode.<br>  <br>  Have you tried to run your virus checker, because, yes a virus or trojan could have the effect that you describe.

Boot from the CD that you get from the virus checker, and let it check your hard drive.<br>  <br>  If the problem isn't a virus, then you should start copying any files that you want saved on your hard drive to a CD or DVD, because, my guess is that your hard drive is failing or that Windows XP is corrupted in some fashion... in either case you will probably have to re-install Windows...<br>  <br>  Good Luck.|`|wOcJ60Jxaa	okay when you don't shut it down correctly , it will ask you or may boot on into safe mode. go to start and click restart or shut down then when it tries ot power on make sure you select the normal boot way. good luck!|`|PVIqTDa0aa	Your OS is on the verge of crash.You have to reinstall your OS.I just answered another question on how to install OS and format drive.Please review my profile and check my last answer .

ca9800e875bb4c0b4dbd33a8358d5eefaa	The router (AKA hub or switch) is the equivalent of a video splitter in a way. Connect the ethernet wire from the broadband modem to the WAN slot of the router, then connect each computer to the LAN slots in the router. There is no reason to do what you want to do, and (of course) it is not possible.|`|887b94b352481c83728329b4e45a47d1aa	1 thing you might want to consider if that some ISP's will only allow one IP address per customer.  So if you start running into issues, keep in mind that may be your main problem.<br>  <br>  What you want to do is buy a hub/switch.  you can get one at best buy,office depot, staples, etc.<br>  <br>  You can probably run the line from your broadband connection into that switch.  Also on the same switch run another line to your router.  Your router would then have switch ports on it as well, and you'd plug the laptop into that.<br>  <br>  you may have a few wiring issues as well, depending on the type of switch/hub unit you buy.  If you look at an Ethernet cable, you'll see there are wires clamped down inside the connector. You may have to change the order of those wires (typically to the exact opposite), unless you have a switch on your hub/switch to change that. <br>  <br>  (It sounds complicated, it isn't).  Just be patient and play with it for awhile.|`|T5MR7fNHaa	You don't give many details, I'm not sure if you have ADSL or Cable (like NTL etc) Broadband.<br>  <br>  If you have ADSL and a basic USB Modem, you do not have any ethernet yet.<br>  You need a combined ADSL Modem / Router box (which you can get with or without WiFi). These typically have sockets for four ethernet-connected computers etc.<br>  <br>  If you have a Cable box which has a single Ethernet connection, you need a Cable Router. This will have a dedicated ethernet socket to connect to the cable box, and again typically four outgoing ethernet sockets for your gear (and optionally WiFi).<br>  <br>  An Ethernet Hub or Switch (which looks the same but is more intelligent) is fine on a general ethernet setup, but will not work on a single-port cable broadband system - these are designed to work with a single PC and you must have a router to allow more than one device to be used.|`|CmfmEzb5aa	Sounds like you need a Network Hub. What your trying to do is this, connect 2 machines to a route which only has one hole basically. A network hub can have multiple connections. The wire from the router to the laptop goes to the hub instead, then from the hub you can have 2 wires, one to the laptop and one to the PC.<br>  <br>  Hubs are cheap and most PC stores will carry them.|`|v6BcjOdWaa	There is no splitter for ethernet cable.<br>  If you want to bypass firewall of router, you need to configure your router so that your PC is in DMZ.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demilitarized_zone_(computing)" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demilitariz...</a>

OQugoqzraa	you have already one? <br>  Do you need both drives?<br>  With the mains cable unplugged from the PC to avoid the risk of electric shock, take off the side panel and look inside your PC.<br>  If you do not need both drives then simply look at which way round the connecting cables go and replace the CD-RW with the DVD-RW. All you really need to check is that the jumper switch on the new drive is in the same place as the old one. This switch determines if the device is M (Master) or S (Slave) or CS (Cable Select)as long as it is the same as the drive you remove there will be no problems.<br>  If you want to keep both drives you most likely need a new Data Ribbon cable to connect it to unless the HD and CD-RW are on different cables. Again just copy the way the cables fit on the drive in place and add the new DVD-RW as the slave drive to the old CD-RW, check the jumper switch on the back is set to S before you put in.<br>  If you have to add it as a new drive because the HD and CD are on one cable, you need a new cable (IDE data ribbon unless its a SATA DVD drive) and set the jumper to master and connect one end of the cable to the drive the other to the motherboard next to or just behind the one for the HD. Connect the power cables and reboot.|`|c1b4b7f8e314ae3b676971e55c6665dcaa	It's actually very easy, depending on how much room you have to work in (I hope your tower case is not a mini.  They are tough to work in.).  <br>  <br>  Are you adding an additional DVD player or just replacing an older DVD or CD?  If replacing one, just remove the old one and put the new one in its place.  Hook up the cables the same as before and you should be good to go.<br>  <br>  If you are adding a DVD/CD player, you have to have room for it, usually above or below the older one.  Then you have to have a cable that has a second attachment that allows hooking up the second drive with the same cable as the other one.  You only have two motherboard IDE connections so you should use one for the hard drive and the other for both DVD/CD drives. You also need an additional power plug coming from your power supply box (PSUs usually have extras, and any of them will work).   All of this is pretty standard.<br>  <br>  I've assumed your computer motherboard is EIDE and not SATA, which uses different cables and may require some modifications.  Once you add a CD player once, you'll see how easy it is.<br>  <br>  By the way, if this is the first DVD player in your machine, you'll have to install the software that makes it work.  New units should come with the software, but if not you can download the free VLC.program.  I use it instead of Windows Media Player for everything.  Just Google VLC and download the program.|`|gqm0BfIbaa	okay so most likely it is SATA cable so first you need to turn off your computer<br>  then you need to turn off the power and should probably unplug the computer completely<br>  then you want to open up the computer and make sure their are no magnets or anything by it and then their is usually a box like thing where the cd drive should go and you either need to unscrew this or you need to press something it and it'll come out... then you need to take the SATA cable and follow the other cd drive you have and follow the SATA cable the wire should like kinda rectangular and then you need to plug this one into a near by SATA outlet and then put the drive in the computer and start up your computer and it'll ahve a weird open screen where it is testing the new drive so just give it a minute and go through these process and it should come out....<br>  <a href="https://support.intergraph.com/itservices/sysdocs/hardware/dha020860.pdf" rel="nofollow">https://support.intergraph.com/itservice...</a>

This is known as your "gateway IP".  When you connect your computer to the router, the router will assign an IP address to your computer, which will most likely look something like 192.168.0.xx.<br>  <br>  If you go to start->run and type "cmd" and run that, it will give you a DOS prompt.  Type "IPConfig" and it will show you what your assigned IP is, and what your gateway IP is.<br>  <br>  If you have no assigned IP but have a gateway, then there is probably somthing wrong with your computer or router.  Try typing "IPConfig /renew" which will attempt to get another DHCP address from the router.  Wait a second, then type IPConfig again and see if it changes.  If you have no gateway, then there is probably something wrong with your router or modem.<br>  <br>  Try unplugging the router and the modem from the power source.  Wait 10 seconds, then plug in the modem.  If it's cable or DSL, it should connect automatically.  If it's dial-up then you're probably not using a router so it's probably not dial-up.  It could take up to a minutes for the connection to complete.  Once the modem is online, make sure the router is connected to the modem, and plug the router into the wall.

You can use 800 MHz, 667 MHz and 533 MHz modules.<br>  <br>  Just remember that if you install a 800 MHz memory module and keep the existing 667 MHz, the entire memory system will default to the lower speed for EVERYTHING ( this is done for system stability ).<br>  <br>  The same would apply if you installed just one 533 MHz module, the system would default (downgrade) to that lower speed.<br>  <br>  If you want to keep the 667 MHz, better to buy just that type (for stability, better integration and economical reasons).<br>  <br>  Virtually any configuration up to 8 GBs* can be reached using any combination of 128, 256, 512MB, 1GB and 2GB modules installed in the four sockets of the motherboard.<br>  <br>  * Anything over 4 GBs will not be recognized unless you use a 64-bit Operating System (OS).<br>  <br>  MODULES MUST BE ORDERED AND INSTALLED IN PAIRS FOR DUAL CHANNEL MODE.<br>  <br>  If 4 GBs are installed under a 32-bit Operating System (XP or Vista), Windows will be able to access about 3.5 GBs ( 0.5 GB will be taken (stolen) by the hardware subsystem for internal use ) and the available recognized memory may be reduced to 3GB or less (depending on some system configuration and memory allocation). <br>  <br>  Go here to find the complete guide to kind and size of memory for your motherboard:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.ec.kingston.com/ecom/configurator_new/modelsinfo.asp?id=8&SysID=31940&mfr=Intel&model=DG965RY+Motherboard&search_type=&root=us&LinkBack=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.kingston.com&Sys=31940-Intel-DG965RY+Motherboard&distributor=0&submit1=Search" rel="nofollow">http://www.ec.kingston.com/ecom/configur...</a>|`|c1b4b7f8e314ae3b676971e55c6665dcaa	Go to Crucial.com and download their CrucialScanner program.

zorYTX59aa	If YouTube is slow, stuck or weird, and people suggest you<br>  either change, install or get stuff....DON'T TOUCH A THING.<br>  <br>  Please don’t tinker with your "Java Scripts", "Flash Players"<br>  or different browsers -- and definitely stay away from any of<br>  the software that salespeople (disguised as answerers here<br>  on Yahoo) are trying to sucker you into buying.<br>  <br>  None of those things will help you because I am pretty sure <br>  your computer and YouTube were working fine before, right?<br>  The first rule of thumb and ideal option should always try to<br>  be: DON'T disable, erase, uninstall, switch, download, alter, <br>  add, change or install anything. Matters will only get worse.<br>  <br>  Several times each day, YouTube shuts down a few of their <br>  servers to update stuff. Be patient if YouTube is slow, stuck<br>  or mangled. Transmissions from YouTube to your computer<br>  are done in multiple tiny packets of data and flash at a time. <br>  That's why sometimes you may get any of these scenarios: <br>  bits and pieces of text/thumbnails in weird places; sluggish<br>  loading/buffering; the spinning circle going on forever; or the<br>  player being blank. This problem could fix itself within a few <br>  hours or by the next day.<br>  <br>  If your YouTube continues to behave slow, stuck or strange,<br>  it's very possible that your directories of "temporary internet <br>  files" and RAM (sometimes known as "cache") are close to<br>  the maximum and just cannot take anymore, the end result <br>  being any of the above scenarios or videos that: A) come to <br>  a complete freeze; B) start/stop/start/stop in a choppy way; <br>  or C) never even make it onto your screen.<br>  <br>  "Temporary internet files" are tiny bits of webpages that get <br>  permanently put on your hard-drive. They will remain forever<br>  on your computer, gradually plugging it up like hair stuck in <br>  a sink drain, until you finally get rid of them once and for all. <br>  Thus, exit out of YouTube, then clear your "cache" of all its<br>  "temporary internet files", "cookies" and "history". It is best<br>  if you shutdown and reboot afterwards. You'll be amazed at <br>  how "fresh" and "new" your YouTube will be.<br>  <br>  If you're not sure how to delete your "cache" or if you would<br>  like more "tips" on making YouTube run even better without <br>  having to buy/install a thing, then please click on my avatar <br>  and send me a message -- preferably with your YouTube or <br>  email address. I will guide you step-by-step in plain English <br>  and with full explanations.<br>  <br>  Note 1: if you are using Google Web Accelerator or a utility<br>  similar to that: dump it, burn it, trash it, disable it, uninstall <br>  it; do all that you can to get as far away from it as possible. <br>  Even though this contradicts all my advice, not only does it <br>  terribly conflict with YouTube, clicking on "Don't Accelerate <br>  This Website" won't help you whatsoever.<br>  <br>  Note 2: longer videos require both "Flash" and "Shockwave"<br>  in order to play smooth. Other than that, avoid all the sales <br>  pitches that some Yahooers may be shilling, because they <br>  are really disguised salespeople & peddlers. Their answers<br>  have nothing to do with your question, and their wares may<br>  actually worsen your problem. Besides, what kind of idiotic<br>  answer is "Although you can't even watch or access videos <br>  properly, buy our downloader." [my paraphrase]<br>  <br>  Note 3: a very odd fix that once worked for me was altering<br>  the URL from "www.youtube.com" to simply "youtube.com" <br>  (or you could even try "ca.youtube.com").|`|qSJIne9aaa	Well.

7ZfGqo3qaa	That's a question which only the people at eMachines may be able to answer for sure, but probably not... <br>  <br>  Whether or not a CPU upgrade to a Core 2 Duo is possible depends upon one thing- the motherboard.  Unfortunately we can't be certain since eMachines made at least two versions of the t5212- one with Intel Pentium-D processors and another with AMD Sempron processors.  There is no single motherboard we can refer to in order to check specs.  <br>  <br>  However, there's no indication that the motherboard used in Pentium-D models is capable of taking any better processors.  See this earlier post from Y/A:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20081129190450AAEtM0E">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a><br>  <br>  You can definitely upgrade the power supply and video card, but that might be all.  Still, a video card upgrade has the biggest impact on gaming performance.  A GeForce 9500GT or Radeon 4670 might work without having to upgrade your power supply- and either would be a major improvement from your Radeon Xpress 200 integrated video.<br>  <br>  Alas, the reviews and specs on the T5212 don't say anything about what capacity psu the system comes with.  If it's 350W you'd be ok.  To use cards like the Radeon 4830 or GeForce 9800GT you'd need a 400-450W power supply minimum.
f79a44bda7e4581623ca3e13cb6ad153aa	Yes. Connect the two computers together either with<br>  <br>  1) A crossover ethernet cable<br>  or<br>  2) Two straight ethernet cables and an ethernet switch<br>  <br>  Then switch on Internet connection sharing on computer A and job done.

That’s one of the drawbacks of the built in defragger, you cant defrag and use the PC simultaneously.<br>  Disk errors, (run chkdsk before defrag)<br>  Lack of free space , the built in defragmenter needs atleast 15% free space, for which you can try running a diskcleanup.<br>  Fragmented system files which the Windows defragger cannot defrag neither can any of the free defraggers.<br>  I'd suggest installing a third party tool like Diskeeper, which has many advantages like real time background defrag, system file defrag, low free space defrag and a nice GUI.

kJMLIH89aa	It is because when your music was on your computer. iTunes had a map of where all the files were. When you move the files to your external hard drive that map no longer works. <br>  <br>  What you need to do it delete all the "songs" in your library. If it asks if you want to keep files click on yes. Then click on file in iTunes and say add folder to library. And select the folder on your external hard drive that has all your music in it. Then it will add your music back to your itunes library. <br>  <br>  I hope this helps you.<br>  <br>  This is not a digital right management issue unless it tells you that you are unauthorized to play the music.|`|yAh2f59maa	This is due to DRM (Digital Rights Management) which means the songs were downloaded to a specfic computer and will only play on that specific computer/device.  You might be able to authorise the new computer to play the songs per the Apple.com site (<a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/TA22652)." rel="nofollow">http://support.apple.com/kb/TA22652).</a>

zorYTX59aa	The famous "WE'RE SORRY THIS VIDEO IS NO LONGER <br>  AVAILABLE" message is generally the result of any stupid<br>  software claiming that they can "accelerate" video buffering.<br>  This includes crap like GWA, SpeedBit, Trident, Jaton, ATI<br>  Fire, Diamond Fire, and Easy Video Accelerator.<br>  <br>  Of course nothing "accelerates" streaming video files. Even<br>  the people at Google and Macromedia know this, and state<br>  that in their own FAQs about "Flash". Thus, if you have any <br>  type of "accelerator"...dump it, burn it, kick it, rip it, trash it, <br>  uninstall it; do everything you can to get as far away from it <br>  as possible.<br>  <br>  If you don't have a useless utility like that on your computer, <br>  there is something that's interfering with YouTube, therefore <br>  please consider these possibilities:<br>  <br>  Not much in terms of playing YouTube vids has changed in<br>  the past 2 years. If anything, all the newer flash players are<br>  causing lots of YouTubers some kind of grief, especially all <br>  5 variations of version 10. It's crazy that there is a 10.0.525, <br>  10.1.218, 10.2.26, 10.2.54 and 10.12.36. For the most part, <br>  updates are typically good for one thing: computer/software <br>  problems. I have never strayed away from 9.47, and a lot of <br>  Flashers swear by 9.45. Think of those two as WindowsXP <br>  compared to Vista. Take a look at the "Asker's" comments <br>  to this other "Best Answer" of mine:<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20081125075929AABZpVS">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a><br>  <br>  You may also wish to consider these alternate possibilities:<br>  <br>  → Tools → Internet Options → Connections (tab) <br>  → LAN Settings (which is the very last button)<br>  → uncheck "Automatically detect settings"<br>  <br>  → Tools → Internet Options → Advanced (tab)<br>  → scroll down until you reach "Multimedia"<br>  → check-mark all but "Show image download placeholders"<br>  <br>  Two people have written to me saying after they got rid of a <br>  certain software, things seemed to work all right afterwards:<br>  One person got rid of his "nVidia" drivers; the other trashed <br>  his "ad blocking" utility. Do you perhaps have either or both <br>  of these on your computer?<br>  <br>  I've saved my favorite other solution for the end. YouTube is<br>  at its best when you clear all your "Cookies", "History" and <br>  "Temporary Internet Files". My cool "CHTIF" triple-cure has <br>  resolved hundreds of people's problems, so why not yours?<br>  Close out YouTube, do the following, then shutdown/reboot:<br>  <br>  Internet Explorer 6:<br>  → Tools → Internet Options <br>  → Delete Cookies → OK<br>  → Delete Files → OK<br>  → Clear History → Yes <br>  → OK<br>  <br>  Internet Explorer 7:<br>  → Tools → Internet Options → Delete...<br>  → Delete files → Yes<br>  → Delete cookies → OK<br>  → Delete history → OK<br>  → Close (browsing history window)<br>  → OK<br>  <br>  Mozilla Firefox<br>  → Tools → Clear Private Data<br>  [x] Browsing History<br>  [x] Download History<br>  [x] Saved Form and Search History<br>  [x] Cache<br>  [x] Cookies<br>  → Clear Private Data Now<br>  <br>  I hope my multiple answer is helpful for you. If you are able<br>  to determine the "cause" and its "cure", I would appreciate<br>  it if you could please let me know, either by clicking on my <br>  avatar or emailing me at "inukjuak90@yahoo.com".<br>  <br>  IMPORTANT: ANOTHER POSSIBLE CAUSE IS FIREFOX 3 AND ITS <br>  INTERACTION WITH YOUTUBE'S (GOOGLE'S) "CACHE" SERVERS<br>  THAT REFUSE THE PLUG-IN'S REQUEST FOR VIDEO FILES. THIS <br>  RETURNS A FALSE ERROR CODE TO YOUTUBE SAYING THAT IT <br>  CAN'T FIND THE VIDEO, OR THAT THE REQUEST DOESN'T MAKE <br>  SENSE.<br>  <br>  OF COURSE, THE VIDEOS ARE REALLY THERE, BUT FOR SOME <br>  STRANGE REASON, YOUTUBE RETRANSMITS THE ERRONEOUS <br>  CODE TO A "THIS VIDEO IS NO LONGER AVAILABLE" MESSAGE.<br>  WHAT'S THE SOLUTION?

ldJXd0NGaa	Like Jason says, the only way would be to clone the drive.  That will put an exact copy of your current drive onto the new drive. The main problem might be putting the new drive into a different computer.  The first time you boot, XP will be looking for all the hardware that was in the "old" computer - and won't be able to find it.  My experience with this is that XP will crash and never boot.  But it might be possible for you to enter Save Mode and remove all the old drivers - then reboot and let XP install new drivers for all the hardware in the new PC.<br>  So, yeah, it's worth a try.<br>  Good luck,<br>  Donk|`|c1b4b7f8e314ae3b676971e55c6665dcaa	Sorry.

VMVW3E7Aaa	I wrote some instructions for swapping heads. Pretty much the same things apply to lips (just think lips instead of head) so perhaps this will help you:<br>  <br>  Take head A (with body) and clone some of the background over the edge of the head to mask spots where the new head may not match exactly.<br>  Open head B and erase everything around it, then drag the head layer onto body pic  A. Use free transform to match the size, use the move tool to adjust position.<br>  Fine tune the erasing and blend the neck.<br>  <br>  By the way, it isn't as easy as it sounds, at least not if you want to make it look REAL and perfect.<br>  <br>  Make sure both head shots were taken from the same angle and under the same lighting conditions.<br>  <br>  If angle and light don't match, it will never look anywhere near believable.

IbxhRebgaa	A tracker is some server that's running Bittorrent tracker software. The tracker tells your client the IP addresses of the peers that you can download/upload  to/from. Therefore, it is good to have many trackers on a particular torrent, since it means that you will have the greatest chance of seeing as many of the peers in the swarm as possible.<br>  <br>  There is also peer exchange. This is when your client gets peers from another client without contacting the tracker. Then there's DHT, distributed tracking. Through these two avenues, your client can still get peers even if all of the trackers on a particular torrent are down. <br>  <br>  Therefore, it is a good idea to add more trackers to a torrent if you have reason to expect that some other peers are using that tracker. If you don't expect that there will be peers on that tracker for a particular torrent, however, then there's not much use in adding it.<br>  <br>  On the other hand, if you're the person who is creating the torrent in the first place, and you're not uploading it to some private tracker, then it's a good idea to use as many trackers as you can possibly think of. I've used some torrents that have 75+ trackers (admittedly, more than half are usually dead...but still, you get the point).<br>  <br>  As for increasing speed, make sure you're connectible. Make sure that you have correctly forwarding some port and opened it in your router. Sometimes, people think they've done this properly, when in fact, they have not. If you don't know how to do this, rather than explain it to you, it would be easier if you simply found your router at the following site and followed the guide: <a href="http://portforward.com" rel="nofollow">http://portforward.com</a><br>  <br>  Again, as for speed, if you're on some kind of asymmetric connection, such as ADSL or most types of CATV (ADSL in particular though) then you can limit your upload speed to ~80% of your maximum line capacity. This will allow you to saturate your downstream. Just remember to set your upstream back to `unlimited` when you begin to seed. <br>  <br>  Beyond that, there's not much more that you can do other than ask for a reseed. <br>  <br>  And also, 1 week and 17 hours is not an altogether unreasonable amount of time for it to take to download 8GB. `Slow` is a completely relative term and it depends entirely on what you're used to. To me, for instance, that's not too bad.|`|mEQcAMqxaa	There's quite a bit to get into here but I'll stick to the basics.<br>  <br>  Your download speed is dependant on many factors. The number of seeds and peers and the ratio of one to the other is a major factor.  The more connected seeds you have the better but if there are lots more peers then the amount of bandwidth each peer can offer you is small usually.  Again this is all dependant on the uploaded bandwidth your peers have.<br>  <br>  If you look at the bottom of the uTorrent windows and a little warning triangle appears instead of a green tick then you haven't forwarded a port.  If you double click on the icon it will show you the port number that uTorrent is using to connect.  Go to <a href="http://www.portforward.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.portforward.com</a> , choose you router model and it will give you a guide to forwarding a port.  This will increase your speed also.|`|NGzsGTegaa	Ive not messed much with trackers but here is somethings I do that boosts my speed.<br>  <br>  Download the latest version of uTorrent, for some reason now, the latest version automatically pickups up port forwarding for me.<br>  <br>  Go to options > speed guide<br>  <br>  Change your connection type to the closest one. For instance, I have AT&T 6m connection so I selected xx/10Mbit.<br>  <br>  Then click on 'test if port is forwarded correctly'. If its green and says OK then port forwarding is set up properly.<br>  <br>  Another thing I do is go to:<br>  <br>  options > preferences<br>  <br>  Left click 'advanced' once and then scroll down on the left hand side till you see the netmax_half open entry. Change it to 50 and click set.<br>  <br>  Restart uTorrent and see what happens.

hXHBm1BSaa	It is totally dependent on the bandwidth they allow you. No program can help. Also there is a reason for this. If a large number of people decided to watch videos at the same time and were allowed full speed, nobody trying to make legitimate use of the system would get a look in. Also it might just bring the whole system down.
be1979ce40b9ceceab7ad137e21ac660aa	Go to my computer. Click on the drive you put the disk in to see if you can install from there. It will either tell you it doesnt recognize it or you will get an execute file to click on. It might just start installation by itself.

3dv7Qdoxaa	Patrick's right except for one thing. There is the M8800GTS for laptops. It's essentially the same as a 8800GTS for a desktop.<br>  <br>  But I agree that laptops are never ideal for gaming. Gaming kills its battery life when it's not plugged in, heats the laptop up a lot, a gaming laptop costs SO much compared to a gaming desktop, and the most you could probably do to improve the laptop is add more RAM. <br>  <br>  I would stick with a desktop if you're going to be playing a lot of games.|`|NGzsGTegaa	No they may have a varriant of it for laptops but in general Id say something like that would be desktop only platform.<br>  <br>  Laptops are NEVER the ideal choice for gaming. They heat up and cost twice as much as a desktop PC to build.<br>  <br>  You also cant upgrade the hardware inside as much as a desktop. If you can even upgrade the graphics hardware in a laptop, it cant be anything that high end unless it came with it to begin with.
