wiJmJ7gNaa	You can write about how people can easily believe and be persuaded by the media (newspaper, news channels, etc.). Pinpoint the fact that some of the media likes to sway to some particular opinions or political parties when time comes. This would probably best be a commentary article.   Other commentary articles can be how some kids are vandalizing the rest rooms, desks, or school stuff that is paid for by taking money from the school's budget.   for other ideas, talk to random people around school and you might find an interesting person to write a profile on. Also, notice the issues or ongoing opinions around the school, from both staff and students.  Hope this helps!|`|hbuwryL9aa	what about, does the news media diminish the quality of political dialogue???|`|lqVhxD3xaa	Brain cancer related to cell phone use.

In general we mean well, but we are inclined to be preachy and to believe that our way is the right way, so of course that causes resentment.    The last few years have not been stellar for our global image, the botched war in Iraq, torture, Gitmo, Abu Ghraib, generally ignoring that we are one nation among many and that others have legitimate interests makes us appear stupid and cruel.

Mind you I rather doubt that any comparisons were made at the time with the dispossession of Australia's native people's in 1788 and onwards.That is a more modern liberal thing, and actually is comparing apples and oranges:  colonialism Vs political creation of a nation state following a war and extensive zionist terrorism against Britain post WW2.|`|NMpbLtuTaa	Jerusalem is mentioned hundreds of times in the Bible but not even once in the Koran.

Obama's isn't the greatest, especially with the proposed spending on roads and computers in schools and things that are unnecessary right now. If the stimuls package were to divide the how many hundred billion dollars between all the tax payers in the country, that would be great. The only thing that is going to turn the economy around is for people to start spending again, and that isn't going to happen soon. There need to be caps on income and people that make a ridiculous amount of money need to be limited. The bonuses need to stop. There is so much money that is being spent to people that already have more money than God. It's stupid really. Also, they need to stop giving money to banks and Wall Street, unless they are going to put some rules along with that money. Ya know the billions of dollars that were given to banks so that the banks could help people with their mortgages? Didn't happen. All the banks did was buy smaller banks, which in turn caused the loss of lots of jobs. If there is going to be more money given to banks without rules, the same thing is going to happen. Really with the proposed stimulus package right now, we as tax payers, small town residents, middle class families, aren't going to see any of it-|`|a5c96f01ce98dccbbe83fee4b61edbd0aa	No. It is wasteful spending on things that America can't afford and it is wasteful spending on things America doesn't need.

Israel has been holding money which belong to the Palestinian Government, money needed to run Gaza as a municipality, this money is collected taxes and donations from the Europeans.

Israel also provided weapons to the Fatah, the same guns that they use against Israel but in that case there was no other option but to help the palestinian authority to have guns so they can put order in their territory (instead they used those weapons against Israel).    Did you know that Israel provides water to Gaza and also to South Lebanon, where Hezbollah is located? so actually Israel provides water to Hezbollah, its enemy.    Middle East is a relation of hate and love, most hate comes from arab countries, Israel sometimes need to do things that go against their interest with the intension of improving its relation with its enemies or their people.    Israel has attended palestinians in Israel Hospitals for free, has attended Iranians as well as people from Lebanon.|`|Kggz7Eyiaa	Israel at the moment is attempting (well they are succeeding, so not really an attempt) to divide and conquer.     In the words of Avi Shlaim (renowned jewish historian and Oxford professor)    "Israel likes to portray itself as an island of democracy in a sea of authoritarianism. Yet Israel has never in its entire history done anything to promote democracy on the Arab side and has done a great deal to undermine it. Israel has a long history of secret collaboration with reactionary Arab regimes to suppress Palestinian nationalism. Despite all the handicaps, the Palestinian people succeeded in building the only genuine democracy in the Arab world with the possible exception of Lebanon. In January 2006, free and fair elections for the Legislative Council of the Palestinian Authority brought to power a Hamas-led government. Israel, however, refused to recognise the democratically elected government, claiming that Hamas is purely and simply a terrorist organisation."    http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/jan...
B3Ea1oWfaa	I think that the package will help me, I am a single mum of 3 under 10, I work full time and have my children in care for these days.

However, I feel that the infrastructure and business investment will be helpful.    It is interesting to note that every unemployed person is considered to be a 'bludger'. I spend many hours every looking, and applying for, jobs. I have also done various courses in the past few years. There are many unemployed people who are exactly like me. Try living on $500/fortnight and you'll realise that not providing relief to unemployed people is simply a punishment and/or reflection of the government, and the public's, perception of unemployed people.|`|599e5c385c583b9ea602d9c2b20d4634aa	MOYSTON says "It wont, again handouts to low income earners who just sit back and take the gifts".    Well, thats not true.  The government always seem to be throwing money at people who have got kids. They hardly ever help couples who prefer to get a low income rather than go on the dole.    I dont want to hear "well, it cost money to have kids"..oh, you poor things...you either had the kids because you wanted them which means you knew about the cost or it was an "accident".  2,3 or 4 accidents.....|`|I0m8dqk6aa	Obviously money and rate cuts will help.   But I also think the government should be doing something to limit the margins that companies make on products. If the margins were reduced or limited then people would automatically spend on these items as it takes a lower proportion of their income.    Just look at the cost of grocieries, electricity, fuel etc (all these are necessaties by most people|`|cc3aee0c6dcec16681a9d96e809e0111aa	wont help me...like very other hard working australian who doest have any children i dont get anything...like im not a real person or something.|`|gnwqZNjcaa	As usual it won't help me at all since I am an average person, earning an average wage, single with no dependents - just a lot of debts. Interest rate cuts make no difference to me because I don't have a mortgage. It would seem that people like me just don't exist when it comes to benefits.|`|AA11264665	I will receive a small tax break from the package, but as I'm single  with no children, I seem to have dropped off the government's radar yet again.

As far as I am concerned if you do not get it you do not need it|`|98YldCvfaa	My husband works long hours during the day and I work nights. We brought a cheap house and have two modest cars that we own. We have no credit cards or loans. We most likely will not get anything and that's ok. Iam glad to be in a situation where we don't need help. To those people who are getting it I hope it helps. Why be so bitter there is more to life.|`|hP7xZ0vpaa	It won't help me one iota. My husband and I worked hard for years to try and pay off as much of our mortgage as we could (so very little benefit from interest rate cuts). When he died of cancer last year (aged 48), it left me really struggling financially - cancer is a very expensive business, and I'd been caring for him full time for a year.  I now work full time for a low income, but because we didn't have children there is not one red cent of help. I have a single friend who already earns way more than double what I do, but because she has a kid she also gets the bonuses. I feel like all my husband and I ever did is pay taxes, and get been continually overlooked. Actually, the government got over $1000 in GST for his funeral, which still outrages me!|`|yhyrzO4daa	I am unsure if this will help me.  I am a recently widowed stay at home mother of 5 children, that has gone from having a hard working husband to a sole parent pensioner.  I hope I will benefit in some way.  I know my childrens school will benefit from it.  The rate cut wont help me as I rent and pay $400p/w  and as for a $950 payment I am grateful for but that wont even buy my children a new computer they need for school.|`|AA11401350	it wont.i am 53 employed $42000 \yr never been unemployeed,rent my home,bloody nuthing|`|cP8ROSFMaa	It will help to someone who need it, is there anywhere in the world that government give away the money??? I know 950 wasnt enough to someone, but you're not alone theres are millions of other low incomers, may be some of us just want the straight $20 billions into your pocket (so selfish).    spend it wisely, to make the economy turn, if u dont think this money worth for you, give it to someone else who need it most.    be gracious in whatever cicumtances.    to the high incomers if you think this was unfair to you, have you ever run out money to pay rent??? or even think 100 times just to buy some stuff??? if you dont why complaint? in someway you help others, and in return God blesses whatever you do, as long as you use it wisely aswell.     God Bless Australia, God Bless Kevin Rudd, I know its not the best time to run a government this day, but I will support you, because you're my leader, no matter what.|`|W9iJlAvmaa	I'm a single parent of a boy with a metabolic disorder and studying full time to do a career that is known to be under-appreciated and under-paid.. but I'd love to be a registered nurse and want to contribute to society..we all need nurses and just coz i don't "work" now doesn't make me a bludger in regard to some comments. the govt cant prove one "non-worker" is an alco who'll waste they're money as opposed to another "non-worker" such as myself !!   I get $950 for single income parent and another $950 for having FTB part A and being a 24yr old studying full time.. I'll be paying for all my immunizations, all my uni books, my first aid courses, bills and i'll probably go shopping with the leftovers as stimulating the economy is what its for right?? probably get some winter clothes for my son and I!!  My hand wasn't exactly out but I sure appreciate it!  I'd be sinking this year with out them...|`|Gho2CFyzaa	Once again, my husband and I are not eligible for a cent.  I would like to know when the Government is going to reward the people that actually contribute to our economy by working and not being on a benefit!    I am sick of scraping through when people are getting more money to sit at home.  Would love to be a stay at home mum and see my children grow up - but am unable to afford it.    How much did I spend on my children for Xmas??  $50 each which is all we could afford.  However, the people sitting at home had a great Xmas with their thousand dollars per child while my husband was doing an overtime shift just to pay the bills.    To all of you out there who are living in relationships but claiming Single Parents Benefit - SHAME ON YOU - dont you dare complain about our education or hospital systems not being up to scratch as if everyone was doing the right thing and only claiming when they need it, our health and education services would be one of the best in the world.|`|c8il2SNnaa	yes it helps me as im a single parent. But i would like to point out to those of you that think we are a waste of space, I spend most of my time helping others Im on 5 community boards, volunteer 3 days a week, study and raise my kids. I know everyone should get a cut but don't lump us all as fat lazy nothings. Some of us are trying to make an input to the community, and the way people are losing jobs you might be next in the center-link line.

Both upper and lower houses intend to disapprove the next stimulus package. I've read many of the comments and believe everyone feels they have the right to free money.  Pensioners do it tough - this I agree with and many of them benefited from the last stimulus package.   Single mums with too many children - please don't complain how hard it is when you have the choice to either not have kids or get out there and earn a crust.  The latest stimulus package may just help those income earners who are forever losing out to high medicare levies, mediocre refunds & non-existent financial aid.   Better plan - It's about time the govt and ACCC reviewed financial institutions and the interst rates being charged on credit facilities. They have been allowed to round up the public into unnecessary spending and now hold thousands hostage with outrageous rates often exceeding 26%. Bringing these rates down will free thousands and release cash back into the economy through cash spending.   The Rudd govt should be rewarding those who are helping themselves and out there having a go. Not continually throwing money at those who sit on their bums, and await their next Centrelink windfall.|`|IWvn2u9haa	that's right. nothing for single people. no, we have no children to support. that's right we do not need to save to spend like families. right, we really do not need assistance even though we pay taxes, no matter how small.     that's right, this harsh economy does not affect hard working self employed single people on low income. that's right, struggling people on the dole does not need to get a bit of break to make them feel better. that's right.    only families are so hard. that;s right some families who do nothing but bring their children and annoy their neighbours who want some peace and wanna concentrate on work. that's right. spoil the families of single income with one child whose mother spend their time doing nothing for the community but themselves during school hours. that's right, just give them to talk gossips amongst themselves.     yes ignore hard working double income families who like to better themselves and contribute to the society. that's right ignore them. no they work hard enough for themselves that's right and pay the taxes to fund single parent who prefers not to work and contribute to the community.    you know it does not take more incremental to support one child or two children extra ??? the base cost for the family is the same across. single people need to spend nearly the same base cost to go ahead...    there is no fairness in this it seems. families .. families .. families ... that's the promise they make and they just want to keep families happy so that they keep getting votes ... singles .. who cares ????|`|sNlteoRAaa	i am a single mum of 5 kids and i have a son with autism so work i can not i left my partner due to abuse from him so the pay out that the govement is handing out will help with medical bills for my son so please understand that us carers dont benifit to much from it unless you have other kids for those who would like to judge me and others come walk a mile in my shoe when you have to feed a 10 year boy like he is a baby|`|tkoNW2Z3aa	Hopefully will help me - not sure as I seem to fall through the cracks with the schemes and programmes that are in place - like the handout last year. It is a pity that people on Newstart but who cannot work like myself and are in Vocational Rehab miss out on the bonuses - it would help me get medical care I desperately need.|`|xXg4BxP9aa	Im a mother and with another on the way and have had to take unpaid maternity leave to care for my kids.  Every last dollar helps and I am grateful for every dollar thrown my way.  Don't judge someone until you've walked a mile in their shoes.  If you're a low income earner you can get free medical help.  I pay a medicare levy, a big one, to help people like you.  Too many people spend time complaining and not wanting to help themselves.  Do YOUR bit to help YOU and be grateful for ANY help that is given to you along the way.  If you don't have kids to care for, who are you to complain about not getting anything? If you can't budget your earnings for just you, then shame on you.  By the way, I was a single mother for 3 years before I met my partner.  I went out and got a job to support us.  So I practice what I preach.  I think investing money into schools is a fantastic idea.  I am very happy with this package.|`|SWD9rO6uaa	I am a single, retired teacher, and the government's stimulus package offers nothing for me. I have already paid to have my ceiling insulation topped up. As it already had some old stuff up there I did not qualify for the rebate. I also did not receive the government's first home buyers grant 14 years ago when I bought my house as no one told me about it.  As for the interest rate cuts - this IS good news and should help me to reduce my mortgage debt a bit faster.|`|JiMvFwaEaa	interest rate cuts- fantastic and the money will help with bills school requirements  and things my son wanted to go to Queensland with the school as a single mum i could not afford it......My son will definitely go now thanks Mr Rudd|`|AA12000364	the package is still unclear about who will get what, i am a full time student/and mother of two single mum,i have no idea what it says ill be getting, it doesnt state wether pensioners will be getting what bonuses, it states families but what?? money per child or just family, tax breaks are great the bonuses are well desearved or those working, but the rest really means not much to me,|`|RNbJlJi4aa	My husband and I have 2 children under 2 and I have had to take unpaid maternity leave to care for the children. He is in Defence and spends an average of 6 months a year away from his family, yet we are still classed as low income earners. To those who think we are sitting back doing nothing, I wonder if you would want to leave your family for months at a time to serve your country? This should help keep us floating a little longer.|`|XkFdWdQmaa	First of all what is this stimulus package who  will apply to? I as a age pensioner I got the last bonus which I used to buy a new washing machine , with the interest rates going down that's fine for those buying a home ,there was no such thing when we bought our home we still had the same problem with cost of living, and our interest on our home was 10 percent ,and I had five children, I would like to see the banks pass on this fall in interest to include credit cards to help those who have to use them I take offence  that certain persons think that the pensioner's bonus last year was spent on drink I am sure that the majority of pensioners used  it wisely|`|AA11715700	We are a husband and wife self employed couple.  We are in the building industry.  We already struggled to put insulation in our roof and  that was 6 years ago and we have not saved one penny in electricity. We paid our home off at 9.95 per cent interest and didn't complain because we agreed to that. We got 50 cent endowment for our first child and one dollar endowment  per month for our second.  We have never been on the dole, we tried once when my husband had a broken ankle but centrelink refused unless we deregistered our business. We are the people who slip through the cracks.  We have got less work now and I don't know what our future holds. Tax cuts wont help us if we have no wage.  If the government is so worried about being green why doesn't it spend some of those millions setting up and owning factories to process our iron ore and making steel frames for our houses so termites don't eat them.  This would save whole forests.  We would not be held to ransom from other countrys' cancelling their orders and we would make profits for the government and create jobs and save the environment.  This might not be a good idea, I don't know ,but surely thegovernmentt has many bright advisers that must sooner or later come up with something that helps everybody not just a select few.|`|yftuvzwaaa	dont really no!! i dont know what we are entiltled too, on single income family with 6 kids so can any one tell me??|`|H1X3NTt0aa	Wont help at all.

I lost my job because of all this economic crap and finding another is so hard, I thought being an experienced Bookkeeper, it wouldn't be an issue, but there are another 30 people going for the same job.

I think.  My wife and I have 4 children,  I work 10 hrs a day, 5 days a week.  I provide for my family well and earn a modest wage.  I always have the belief that as long as our family are together we will do alright.  She stays at home with the kids.  We do not own a home but have a good deposit to buy one and with the interest rates so low we are looking.    Let's face it people who get something out of it will be happy, people who don't will be disappointed|`|xUxoBnjnaa	I am not sure if it will help me. I am a single parent going back to TAFE this year. I am hopeing I will get the bonus as I will be struggling to pay over $200 a week for 4 days at child care.     Money doesnt matter to me as I enrolled before I even knew about a new package.    I am happy to pay the $200+ out of my own pocket. If I do get the bonus it will be going on TAFE books and child care fees.     BTW the last payment went on a trampoline (200), washing machine(1200) and mini pool(40) plus a few extra present for their birthdays this year. Any left over went into car repairs(500 rego as Im 22 + 660 service and bearings). I do NOT spend my money on stuff that is going to kill me like alcohol and smokes/drugs. It is paid for my kids so my kids receive the money.     It would be great if rentals went down. I am paying $230 a week going up to $250 next Tuesday (new lease). Pass the lower rates onto rentals!!!|`|Ic38qGrAaa	ARGH! This Package WILL DO NOTHING! Harvey Norman himself has said that based on sales figures, it's like the stimulus package never happenned.  According to polls, most people who got the handouts, never spent them.  They saved the money or they used the money to pay off debts (money already spent).  What the package should have done, is given money to those who don't really need it (middle to high income families).  These families have less debts an are more likely to spend it.  Better still, instead of handing out the cash, provide it as vouchers, forcing people to spend it.      Better still, why not put more money into the hands of people who work harder.  Lose the maximum tax rate for second jobs.  My partner works so hard on 2 jobs yet only sees barely enough for her to go out from the second job, despite working so much.  2nd jobs should be TAX-FREE.  Reward those who actually contribute harder to the economy then everyone else.      I'm sorry about people losing their jobs but I work in the live production industry and there have been many times when we have been understaffed NOT due to lack of funds, but due to a lack of WORKERS.  The jobs are there, all you see on the news are STATISTICS.  These are not real numbers. They are merely representations of certain demographics, thus allowing them to be used in whatever form is most leniant towards someones arguement.  Don't believe me? Call around.  There ARE people looking for workers.      Hope there are some answers for someone their.  Anymore political questions and I would be more then happy to place a suggestion for the government and anyone else wanting to read them.|`|3nw0XbZwaa	MOYSTON- or whatever you call yourself.  If you want a baby bonus, have a baby. If you need help from the government, ask, but dont sit there in what is probably your own house, with no children, and no commitments and complain about others.   I am not saying that we are entitled to all these things, but I am a single mum, 23 years old, who works her butt off to support myself and daughter, the rent of my 2 bedroom tiny townhouse is $380 a week, I am entitled to the hand out and it will all go straight to ACTEW, rent, swimming lessons, and paying off my car, as did the last one.  So tell me please, how is it that I am just sitting around, not contributing to society and all these other accusations you and people like you think?  MAYBE, it is those sitting comfy who have nothing to leave behind in this world that are the 'slackers' and not contributing?  I am so sick of people having a go at 'centrelink mums' and everything else. Its not easy, as you clearly have NO IDEA!    In conclusion, yes the hand out will be an enormous help|`|hmttTfdVaa	i don't think i'm directly better off.. but hope those that are can find relief or enjoyment.. i'm on disability support pension & gratefully last time i recieved tha bonus.. which i used 2 buy this computer & internet.. yay i'm catching up!!

My partner and I were both part of a company redundancy in September last year. We have not yet applied for the unemployment benefit and at this stage, do not intend to as we would have to declare all assets and when their value "runs out" the benefit payment is laughable.  We had no redundancy payment and so, are now two professional people with no income, rent to pay and approximately $30,000 in medical costs outstanding following an emergency surgery just one month before I was made redundant. I have no doubt there are many couples like us. I know a few others and have heard about many more. We paid all our dues when employed,contribute much to our industry when we are employed and we don't want to bludge, so, erm, Mr Rudd - did you overlook someone?|`|T3bKUZwbaa	As usual it won't help. Package going to the wrong people. Example building industry money will go to the banks who will earn interest before lending to build houses in construction. Money should go directly to the employers who must be regulated to use funds to build houses etc, employ people then pay back to ATO office.  Currently I'm unemployed for the first time in my life since been redundant and having a hard time finding work which has surpised me. Money should have been spent on the unemployment people and more incentives given to employers to employ people.

You know the people that really appreciate it are the ones that don't put there hand out, unlike the sounds of some of you that are saying "wheres mine". Sorry not trying to be nasty just sick of people whinging about it so much.    Rob J  I feel for you the pensioners really do need some help and also the government should think of adding some $'s to there fortnightly payments to help them get through.    Oh these idiots that wonder where the christmas money went ..... you know when you have kids it dont spread too far and hey some of mine went into the bank to help cope with the hard times in Jan, im sorry but i was smart not to go out and blow it all but it didnt last too long either.

After being in an abusive relationship it was better for myself and my two beautiful kids to go it alone, i tried as hard as i could to not be a single mum but i had to think what was best for the health and sanity of my kids. i work as much as i possibly can, i have to put my son in child care which breaks my heart as he doesnt like it there, he wants to stay with his mum but i do what i can to provide for my family. like everyone else times are hard but how do you then suggest to tell your kids that you CANNOT buy them anything that they really need, i get buy but only just. without the package last year the kids wouldnt of had anything from santa and i'd be in more finacial debt trying to provide the basics, as is last year i had to withdraw what little i had in my supernanuation to help with the basics of trying hard to provide for my kids. i never wanted to be in this situation as well as most of the thousands of people in this country who are struggling but even through it all i still manage to think of those who are worse off. ok there are those out there who dont work and do bludge the system making it harder for those who do need help as we are then all shoved in the same basket. maybe you should get to know someone who is in a worse off posistion than yourself and find out exactly how hard things could really get for yourself then you might appreciate that although it might be hard for yourselves but at lest your not as bad off as someone else. i thank God everyday that my situation isn't as bad as it could be, as everyone could be worse off than what they are now, spare a thought for those that are already there, at least the government is trying to do something to help those it can|`|pM2xRnzPaa	your average income earner gets stuff all as per usual|`|Q5fPGHIUaa	i am a sole parent with a 15 year old daughter at school, i work permanent part time about 20 hrs a week. can anyone tell me what i'd get?|`|TUz0phxMaa	Given I usually get nothing but a tax bill from the government it will be really nice to get something.

I am a stay at home mum of 4, married to a middle income earner. money is always tight, the interest rate drop will help a little, but it drops, food prices rise, petrol rises a little.. so it sort of counter balances..

Perhaps we should have spent our lives living on the dole and enjoyed the benefits.|`|dwzDs8osaa	The only thing that concerns me about this cash payment to the low to middle income earners is this..    Only yesterday I heard a news report where it has been found that with the last cash payment from the Government which was given to pensioners and families (just before Christmas), it has been discovered that since that payment and during the ensuing month, poker machine revenue almost trebled.    So, I wonder if many cash-strapped people take this "bonus" as  free money to spend on the poker machines in the hope of having a big win, which of course happens too rarely.    So, really how does pouring millions of dollars into poker machines help our economy - it does however, give the Government extra revenue.    Instead of just cash payments, perhaps vouchers of some sort should be issued to that value, which can then be redeemed for food, clothing, household goods etc etc?|`|XM7WXyEQaa	yea it will help pay my school expenses   but my dad ( who doesn't live with us) pays heaps of taxes   but still   it helps   the labor goverment is about low income earners and the liberals are for the richer people so don't blame them for not helping the lower class because they need the most help   middle class people have solid jobs and a house to living some low income earners don't     but i think they should cut tax rates to help everybody     the interest rate cuts doesn't help my dad because he has a business loan ( variable) and he has to pay 8.42% ( stupid ANZ )    my mum rents since we cant afford a house but we might buy a house because the mortgage repayments will cost less than the rent|`|y8hLTig1aa	I am one of the people who will be entitled to this stimulus package.

My partner earns under $40,000 a year working full time and I work on  Saturday to help with some of the bills. How can some of you people say that all low income earners are "Bludgers" your a disgrace. Ive worked hard for as long as I could and when I take the time off to look after my kids for only 12 months we are branded as bludgers because we receive some assistance from the government. We CAN afford to raise our kids, we struggle sometimes, and dont have an expensive lifestyle, but our kids are clean, clothed and happy with there lives.

I am a pensioner also, and I think anything that helps is good.    Just reading through some of the comments, why are some pple so selfish. I don't care if it does not help me personally, as long as the economy picks up again. I have children which are affected by all this, and I hope for their sake that it improves somewhat, and sooner than later. My 21yo son will be looking for a job at the end of this year, well if things don't pick up, he can kiss that goodbye for a while, and for those of you saying "what! at the end of the year and he is 21!"

Why can't the government try to place people into jobs or training so they can work.  Giving this bonus is a great idea, but when do the hand out stop? My husband & I work very hard for our money, why should other people be able to get bonus for sitting around and watching tv or whatever they do all day. We have 5 children, i can't afford daycare for my baby, but people who don't work can get it so much cheaper.Thank goodness for my mum and dad who take my big kids to school and mind the little one.

I would benefit from some of the initiatives (like insulation and solar hot water incentives) but it's very likely that I won't be eligible for them as the Labor government seems to think I earn too much.  I would like to think my children would benefit from school maintenance expenditure but it's unlikely that the money will be sent on non-public schools in good areas.  I may get some benefit from increased spending on roads and infrastructure but as a public transport commuter who lives close to the city, I won't benefit as much as outer suburbs car commuters.    The Labor government never seems to think about helping the middle class who are not poor enough to be entitled to any benefits and are not rich enough to structure their income/assets to avoid tax ... they only seem to be interested in taxing such people.|`|xL53vncPaa	being someone who served  my country and was injured in service  it come to a point with my megar pension i could no longer afford to live in my own country, to date everything the govt has done has not given me one cent in assistance, in fact with the lower rates from rba and the crashing of our dollar i am still losing, however in saying that i believe the govt is on the right track, and the worst is yet to come|`|NGayozrPaa	It wont, Im one of the many that slip between the cracks and get nothing|`|gpg7zgAxaa	It will help my family.

Our 2 boys attend a private Caltholic school and our daughter is about to start next term.  We want the best for our children like any other parent and struggle to provide that.  My husband is not a high income earner, and any help the government provides is a relief on our family income.  We also are paying off a modest homeloan, so the interest rate cut is somewhat good news.  We hope we do the right thing and spend the money wisely.  I dont expect to be put down or humiliated because we have recieved a cash bonus and another hasn't.  My husband works as hard as any single person.|`|HSMb1Fl7aa	there is a comment there from the middle class being forgotten. so what i would like to know is what on earth makes them think they should recieve the bonuses? why are they more important than the single parents and seniors of this country who are not only dealing with either raising a family or have already worked there ars8s off for it. i think you are the selfish kind who think that it should revolve around you. more importantly our planet is in a state of dissrepair and there are still those greedy bunch who want the here and now rather than tommorow. after all what the hell is money when there is nothing left to spend it on? you cant eat it can you!|`|KNXprBi2aa	I was having to get as much work and overtime as I could get to pay the home loan but as the interests rates went down so did my hours of work.

After working for the same firm for 24 years, I was medically terminated.  I do not qualify as a low income earner because luckily all through my working life I paid into a permanent disability fund, which has been rolled over into an allocated pension.  I have watched this allocated pension drop by over $40,000 in the last year.  I receive $694.80 after tax per fortnight from workers comp plus my small pension which puts me just over the low income earner cut off point.  So NO, I and thousands like me will not benefit again in any way.  I just heard a report on your news saying this will force the self funded to start spending there money, I for one will not be able to withdraw any of my allocated funds (and that is all I have) if I want to be able to live normally until I reach pension age.|`|325hWMI3aa	don't think it will help us  married couple, no kids, mortgage  interest rate cuts will help - as long as CBA passes it on  maybe the "insulation" will - has needed replacing for the last 5 years  in regards to the "handouts" just before chrissie (gambling increased for 1 month by 40 million) - that was bulls***! My mum raised us by herself - she had 3 jobs - no single parent pension for her. I guess that's what happens when people want to work though - can only thank her cause all those bludgers out there, well, their kids will end up exactly like them - as a single parent who doesn't WANT to work.|`|5vw7S7ZJaa	Hopefully as a working sinlge person who does earn some money and pay taxes i will get 950 bucks. Which is awesome! thats the amount of tax i pay every bloody fortnight mind you....    Why does the government insist on giving handouts to low income/ unemployed people??    If it was me... I dont have a job... i get benefits already... the government just gave me 1000 bucks for each of my ill conceived children... plus the baby bonusus over the years... now i get more dollars for being a lazy bastard...    Why the hell would i get a job if i get rewarded for being a lazy shite...    the cost of living is dropping due to petrol proces falling, interest rates etc. the masses dont need this money... build a broardband network or some hospitals. things we actually need. How about a pipe line from north queensland to supply fresh water to the dry southern states??    Instead every1 will spend it on plasma screens, booze and gambling.     Hey how about wiping my hecs debt. I invested in my education so i could get a better job... wheres my reward for bettering myself... no just reward no hoper idiots who do nothing to better thier own situation..

Arrrrrgh|`|3PhAKM0aaa	As a pensioner , it won't help me at all.|`|02bjGe59aa	I don't think that anyone in any position should be too quick to judge as we may all be in need of help.  I have two children, my youngest started school last year, I returned to full time work and then yes... a redundancy, so never judge please, I have not had more children then I can afford, but you never know what is around the corner, I am just glad that we have a govt. willing to try.  Our family missed out on the christmas handouts as I was sure I would find work again, but we are now in Feb and still no luck.  Those of you looking down your noses at low income earners just may well find yourselves in the same position this year, we all did not choose to be here.|`|sCbDfmkaaa	Once again nothing for me.    I worked my butt of to get some shares - they are now worthless and put some money in the bank which now attracts 0.00000003% interest.  Getting sick of hearing about keeping tradies in work though - had a tradie here the other day and he charged $300 for 2 1/2 hours work - and of course it went straight in the back pocket.  Perhaps Rudd could find a way to make tradies pay their fair share of tax.  I had to work nearly 2 days to earn the $300, plus I had to pay tax on my earnings - tax that goes to provide schools hospitals etc that the tradies and their families use.  Also, it takes weeks to get a tradie out so it would appear there is plenty of work out there.  If all the tradies charge such top dollar Ruddy wont get much for his dollar. Please, I know not all tradies do this so no need to tell me.|`|Na8L5EnEaa	I doubt it will help my family to much at all.  I young apprentice living at home and 1 child a school earning over $100K in a house with insulation (which we paid for).  We will get nothing from the package except maybe the $950 if it is not means tested on combined couples income.  The biggest help today has been the rate cut that will have a direct impact on our life.  The last stimulus package gave us nothing it is pretty clear that being a working couple with no small children we here now to bring in the dollars, pay for our ever breath and support the economy not receive any assistance.|`|bXYoVhDEaa	I work for a community organisation and was horrified to see so many parent spending their bonus just before xmas on drugs, alcohol and pokie machines.

We haven't had kids because we can't afford them so no $$ for that, even if we were a "single" parent.    We earn just enough to be over the low income threshold, so no low income bonus.    We can pay our home loan reasonably comfortably but there is no extra money in our house for holidays or restaurants or even going to the movies.

Is this an australian forum with australians answering the question or is this a "whinging pommies" site, with those bloody poms invading us again;)    you know i'm extremely disappointed at some of the nasty comments, that have become quite personal attacks.  why is it in this country that we always want to ridicule someone for doing something different or "havin' a go"?    i thought that we were a proud nation and stood as one, however that seems to be missing here... regardless of whether someone gets the package or doesn't get the package we (as a nation) should stand together and try to support our neighbour... whether it be our next door neighbour or the local church, hospital or whatever it maybe in your local community everyone needs support and understanding more now than ever in these difficult times and this bickering like school children doesn't help anyone.    We have tried to lead by example, yes, I have 3 small children, 2 are at school and i chose to stay home and look after the 3rd.  I've worked since i was 16 and in the same full-time position for the past seven years and returned every year immediately after my maternity leave, except last time when i returned I was made redundant.    We just purchased our 1st home, 12 months ago, we own both of our cars and have no credit card debt.  The only debt that we own is the mortgage.  My husband has been working extremely hard and doing plenty of overtime, to help us make the repayments, needless to say the money has been extremely tight... we have gone from a 2 income family to 1 income and its been a real struggle.  However we are in a much better position as we have no other debt, we spend within our means and we simply "go without".    So the interest cut rates have and will continue to help us reduce our debt and make our life a little easier, we can finally breathe.    Yes, we were fortunate to receive money just before christmas, this help to install our oven that we bought last february and couldn't afford to have installed, until October.  Oh and yes we went to the CLUB we took the kids their for dinner and we all had a drink.  I assure you none of it went into the pokies, on alcohol, smokes or drugs.    Yes, we will be receving some small amount again and yes we will spend it on a new air-conditioner.  Its all part and parcel when you purchase your 1st home, things are worn out and need replacing.  so i thank Mr Rudd for having a go and trying something different rather than selling off ALL of australia bit by bit    So cmon australia lets be happy and rejoice in the fact that we live in the 'LUCKY COUNTRY' and were on earth would you rather be?|`|AA11818249	Yes it will help me and it will help a lot of people who earn under $100,000 per year (quote)     "Those earning up to $80,000 are eligible for a tax bonus of $950, while those earning between $80,000 and $90,000 will receive $600 and those earning between $90,000 and $100,000 will receive $300."     If this is low income earnings at $1538 to to $1923 per week, then why do pensioners only receive $281.10 per week (1 fifth of a low income earner)    If Rudd put the pensions up to a reasonable amount per fortnight say around $500 per week (not fortnight) and stopped telling single mothers of 8 year old to go out to work - when (quote)    "unemployment is expected to rise to 7% in the next 4 years'     then single mums would not be counted in the unemployment lists and would be able to be at home when the children finish school instead of taking places in child care that are needed by others, everyone would be better off .|`|Px1kH103aa	my son is enroling in a course that he wants to do.but is also exspensive,he will get very little of youth allowance,to live pay rent,and pay fees for the course.I am only on unemployment benefit,so with little i get i will have to try and support him somehow,so hopefully with the money it will make it a bit easier.|`|45b7d0c80d5b3ba262ca6be3b06edc05aa	I'm just recently unemployed, thanks to a turndown in business (two weeks ago, anyone need someone in an admin role?).

God knows where the money went and they said all over the news it didn't help! so why? they could have made a great deal with kmart safeway and all the things we need to survive, and giving gift cards or something..idk i just think giving money out every couple of months isnt such a great idea..|`|4f3GfrN6aa	I'll hopefully get $950 back on my tax, which will go straight to the mortgage.    Although I like getting money for doing nothing, I think it's a terrible idea for the government to dig us into debt in this way.  I think the money would be better spent subsidising wages in some industries so that people could work, rather than getting a handout.      Interest rate cuts are great for those with home loans and other debts, but they are a serious indicator of economic problems.  The fact that they have cut rates this severely is alarming, because it indicates that the economy has not responded to previous measures.  They are running out of rates to cut, so to speak.  So while I'm happy to get a bonus and some relief on my homeloan, I think they're going about things the wrong way when they give people handouts at the expense of the budget.  It will take years to recover that deficit.|`|2aK9IJbiaa	with out prejudges  wake up you all, the labour party left the country in major finical debts it took the liberal party approximately 11 years to get us out with a surplus of roughly 35-40 billion with the Rudd government now in power is creating major debts in which all Australians will have to pay for in the long run ( just seriously think about it ) i not being to rude it is nice what he is trying to do but much of the money would be a benefit to maintain our hospital systems(all medical personnel),police,defence forces,water crisis,fire fighters, with the new start allowances the money which is allocated to people the government should in force the work for the dole scheme and /or bring back the nacho service for a year or two people can learn a good trade from the benefit of this. Australia has been way to soft hard-ed it is about time most newcomers learn to learn the Australian ways and culture and stick to it  also they didn't mention people who are on any kind of pensions this time around in which i really think it that it is wrongly mistaken ( money given to  parents (single) ETC, most of  this money either goes in their own pocket in which doesn't help pay for their kids clothing ETC)|`|QQbbReRAaa	I'm a full time TAFE student. It'll pay for a service on my car, and the rest will sit in my bank and be eaten up by loan repayments. Definitely will take some of the pressure off though. Very handy|`|xs2mpYjWaa	It's all a little unclear. I believe I may be entitled to $950 but is that as a tax thing or a seperate payment?     I worked part time up until November last year then lost my job due to the economy, I now receive Centrelink, I am in the process of talk with an employer about a new job, but they don't seem to be in a hurry.     As a 22 year old with lots of qualifications and reasonable experience, I am finding it so damn hard to get a new job yet alone a full time job over all the years. There is so much competition out there. I have'nt stopped studying in hope I will have something over the competition. I do feel for many 'dole receipiants' many are genuine and it is not easy. Those that are just bludgers, don't deserve a cent.     If it is a seperate payment, I don't know if 'unemployed' recieve it or not. I too have debts, when you lose your job so unexpectantly it happens. I am slowly paying them off with my measily $400 a fortnight (I choose to pay $50 into tax, so in a way I'm getting my own back)    If it is as a tax refund, then will everyone get the full $950, as you can only get what you have paid less deductions. So I might get all my tax back but no deductables.     My mother may get the $950 too but it depends if they look at dads salary.     It goes like this:  Earn   $80-90,000 = $650  $90-100,000 = $350 (i think)  > $100,000 = NIL    So I really don't see how it's aimed at low income earners, it's just making sure the rich don't get richer. If you come from a household with no kids and two incomes over $100,000 then I think you can manage just fine without it.     Of course we already insulation too, no children, etc. The problem I believe with the last stimulus package is that many pensioners didn't spend the money, many saved or used it towards bills, while I don't blame them, the Gov't wanted the money basically wasted in the shops.     I understand the children are expensive, but is it really fair that parents keep getting more and more. As with all things it is again income tested. Kids cost the same no matter how much you have. Sure a millionaire doesn't need it but the common person shouldn't miss out.     What worries me is the huge deficit Australia is now in. After so many years of having a excellent surplus, it's not gone into a MASSIVE deficit. Did it need to be so drastic? Couldn't we have just spent what we have.     The interest rate cuts will depend on how much the banks pass on. Only 18 months ago on our home loan of $200,000 we had a minimum payment of $2000, now its down to $1300 per month. We still pay the same $2200 so now we're paying it off quicker. It's also given up the option of re-borrowing to buy a new car. We have a loan for $200,000 but only owed $150,000 so we could use the $50,000 (of which we're using $30,000) to finance a new car and not be left with 10 extra years on the mortgage.|`|pInY6rYqaa	It won't.

Then you shove that child into childcare as soon as they turn 6 weeks old, happily taking the government's (ie. taxpayers') subsidies, crying poor that your kids pick up every disease under the sun now that they are in "second-class hands" due to your "need" to return to work, not to mention the way you complain incessantly about how "returning to work is almost not worth it", (considering the exorbitant fees you are paying).    You seriously cannot be expecting any sympathy?  Surely not????    It's absolutely true that the government should be prioritising and putting more funding into education and health, rather than Kevin 747's overseas jaunts, as well as all those other useless propositions they pour their money into, as if we taxpayers have a bottomless pit in terms of $$$.    But getting back to your post...it does make me wonder why people like you bother to have kids when you palm them off to others at the first opportunity so that you can have "your life back"?      Some parents.    Go on now, lash back.  Or for once, at least have a guilty conscience about being a "Clayton's Parent".|`|AA11218682	i guess it'll help a little. but people will complain about it because they think that's what their supposed to do whenever any politician does anything.|`|35388c245298f734c446f07410c4ec69aa	It won't.  My income last year was low enough that I didn't have to file a tax return, which means that I'm not included among those earning less than eighty grand a year.  And while I am a student, I don't receive any social security payments, so I'm not included among students.  The reason I don't receive any is that to qualify as 'independent' for the purposes of Youth Allowance you need to have made more than a certain amount of money or been employed for more than a certain amount of time (or be married, or a ward of the state, etc.)  So put simply I haven't made enough money for them to give me money.  Which means I'm left fighting for one of a rapidly diminishing number of jobs in order to get together the five hundred dollars or so that I need for this semester's text books, while someone making almost eighty thousand dollars a year gets a huge (at least by my standards) government handout.  If they only want to help people who have jobs, why not just lower taxes?|`|gnABxaKmaa	To a degree, it will help the majority of Australians... I guess I'm too young to start a family of my own (I'm 19) and I'm just started uni this year... Both the Economic Crisis and the Stimulus Package didn't affect me...    I may have an extra $1000 in the bank... but if I was to be EXTREMELY honest with you... I don't exactly spend money on myself or on anything else around the house...    I welcome the stimulus package (who in the right mind doesn't want free money?) but I'm ashamed to grab money without contributing to the economy or the workforce... Give me 5 years...I'll finish my degree and do my part for Australia as an decent Asian Australian should do!|`|yP4xdVELaa	Really the government should be building another power station in Victoria that assists with Melbourne. After all the crap that happened during the heat wave (trains, hospitals and house blackouts etc) and the bushfires coming within 2km of cutting off 4/5 of Melbournes power supply it just makes sense. It would also create thousands of jobs for years to come. It's just ridiculous the way things are at the moment! P.S - I'm not sure as yet if the stimulus package will help me!|`|kNvbkZHIaa	Hi    We will get a break this time but usually we always seem to fall through the cracks. We have debts and bills to pay too. I hope this goes to those who need and use it wisely. For a quantity it won't because they will only squander it away like before.  Straight out tax cuts to all workers would've been better. Then that would leave money to help those pensioners and low income earners who also need it.    Cya  :)|`|oDDtEShmaa	It won't.    Same as the last package. Unless they do things that provide incentives to spend, giving people money does not equate to a boost in the economy. Some people save up, some people gamble, some people give it away to relatives overseas and for whatever reason. The whole idea is like throwing some down the ocean and hoping someone will pick it up.    Interest rates cuts mean the Australian dollar will fall yet again. It's already low and this will simply make things worse. Sure it'd help those with mortgages, but in such a situation, those people would have prepared to pay the sum they're currently paying. Lower dollar will only drive up commodity (as it is mostly imports), which will steer away the effects of that stimulus package if there was any.|`|xJU1Mw5gaa	How will the government know our income before we have put in a tax return?

I would love nothing more than to be a 'middle income' family and no longer have to rely on Centrelink and gov. payments but someone has to do the low paid jobs.  Yes, I chose to have four children who will one day all be tax payers and contribute to pay for services that childless people take for granted.  Because of this, I will hopefully be receiving a government handout. It wont be used for dining out, holidaying or luxuries - heaven knows on $30K these are the things of dreams.  It will be used to pay overdue bills and buy much needed school supplies to ensure my sons get the education that will hopefully make them 'middle income' one day.|`|L1Tu56TFaa	It's great news in relation to the interest rates.  My brother and I are looking into buying a house so the rates a good in that aspect.  The stimulus package?  As far as we can work out we will benefit from the tax bonus for the under $80 000 mark.  I guess you can't complain at that!  But... it's still the same group of people receiving the money.    I do think that it is fantashticthat the farmers struggling on the land will get something.|`|n7Ueeg0gaa	it help me heaps im very happy with it|`|gSWAD0Jxaa	I just read the last 88 comments and I'm embarrassed at  how narrow minded and diminished people are. Firstly, you criticise people getting handouts then complain you didn't get one. I didn't get one, but I'm a bit more mature in realising not everyone can get it. Have you ever wondered there might be a third stimulus package where you will get one? IF YOU DON'T NEED IT DON'T COMPLAIN.

If you earned less than $100 000 last year you will receive a payment. If you earned more - do you really need it??     For us, the school money is a great bonus! I was struggling to get together this years school fees for my daughter.    And I doubt everyone who does receive this bonus will spend it on Plasmas, alcohol and gambling. 95% of people are sensible.

Why?  OK, since Turkey denies the REALITY of ARMENIAN GENOCIDE, why would they want to see the Armenian side, I think it was because they wanted to see what else is there, so they can change and twist more of Turkey's archives, believe it or not, there are lots of proofs in USA and other countries, but why Turkey don't want to see those archives, why do they push it to the back of the shelves?   Think about it!|`|vbznVd6qaa	when  did this happen?  as far as i know, turkey always avoided to have any Armenian genocide related discussions from the entire world not only from Armenia.     they have canceled all the previous meetings in the past and for what? because turkey is scared of the truth to be exposed
xU7AaQOdaa	I checked this on the net:    http://www.brake.org.uk/index.php?p=675    It appears that the Maximum Sentence is 14 years, but " judges follow guidelines on the factors to consider when sentencing someone found guilty of causing death by dangerous driving. If they don't take note of these guidelines, it is possible that their ruling will be overturned in the Court of Appeal, which may adjust the sentence in line with the guidelines."    Further, the guideline as I see it for this case is "It would be obvious to a competent and careful driver that driving in that way would be dangerous" and " Driving while the driver's attention is avoidably distracted, e.g. by reading or by use of a mobile phone". The combination of these makes the driver "highly culpable".    So, wtf does 21 months come from?    It is an interesting article, well worth a read.|`|AA11530601	Yeah they system is f*ked up.

She argued that she could text and drive at the same time, despite all the evidence and her own common sense telling her that no one can.    In three years time I hope to god I am not driving down a road with this person heading the other way.    Apparently the Judge has a record of light sentencing, why is he still on the bench then?

VfowGdWLaa	well, the Arabs living in Israel do have equal rights they also have representation within the Israeli gov't. So as far as equal rights go Arabs and Jews have equal rights in Israel. The problem is that a one state solution is unlikely. What would that "one state" be called? Israel? Palestine?     Israel has been an independent state since 1948 and has a better system of gov't so based on that maybe Israel should be the name.|`|de947568c9e8173e12d8a9930bab48abaa	Because on one side you have Israel who only wants to live in peace and on the other you have the arab terrorists who only want to kill all the Jews so no, that will never work.|`|NMpbLtuTaa	It's obviously never going to happen.

But I think both sides would reject a single state solution. They did have equal rights before the Zionist movement.

Why would it work in Israel?|`|rIm9yUNfaa	Actually before israel take shape, Muslims, Christians and Jews were living in peace in Palestine. But after WW2 Zionists attacked Palestine because they believed that Palestine only belongs to Jews because their God promised those lands to them and no one else have right to live there (even Muslims and Christians which live in israel are counted as second order civilians of israel, first order civilians must be Jew).   And it is not only Palestine! They believe that their promised lands are lands between Nile river (in Egypt) and Forat river (in Iraq) and those two blue lines at top and bottom of israel flag are symbols of those two rivers .  Under pressure of other nations, they forced to deny their intention for occupying other lands but as you see there is always conflict between israel, Lebanon and Syria (in past decades they were in war with Egypt as well but since Egypt government is on their side right now, they prefers to focus on other countries first but in future there will be war between israel and Egypt for sure )  Another issue which makes the situation worse is that israel believe that they should rebuild temple of Salomon exactly were Al-Aqsa mosque is right now.  http://tommy1960.files.wordpress.com/200...  (note that Aqsa mosque built more than 1000 years ago and it is the second holly place for Muslims).  For destroying this ancient mosque, they began to dig tunnels beneath it by excuse of historical search for remainder of  temple of Salomon in order to make Al-Aqsa vulnerable hoped that it will crumble soon.  this act was declaration of war to all Muslims (Sunni and Shia and other branches of Islam)    Israel policy is to occupy lands slow but steady so they dont like to have peace because for them, peace means end of expansion. First they emblaze the flames of war, then they begin propaganda and after that they expand their territory a little bit after that they become calm for a while and then repeat that cycle again.     http://sites.google.com/site/falastinel7...    In the current conflict, israel always talk about Hamas rocket attacks into israel but they never tell anyone that they blocked Humanitarian Aids of UN and other charity groups (include food, water, medicine, cloth and fuel) for Gaza!  As a result of their besiege, Palestinian civilians began starving and so many of them became sick by drinking dirty and unpurified water and died in hospitals because of lack of medicine and medical equipments.  Lack of fuel resulted in massive blackout in Gaza for months.  after all these cruelties, Hamas lost its patience and attacked israel with home made rockets which were unguided, short range and extremely in effective in destroying targets.  When they did so, israel began massive propaganda and asserted that Hamas broken the truce and attacked israel civilian areas and for raising world commiseration, you always hear that Hamas rockets strike schools, hospitals and kindergartens, but thats really questionable.    --------------  *Note that israel have one of the most advanced laser anti-missile systems which could detect and eliminate any flying object in israel sky in just few seconds. Now why they dont use this system is my question!    --------------  After well propaganda and getting enough credit from their allies for attacking Gaza, they began their massacre in the name of self defense, also they prohibited access of reporters into Gaza to prevent the world become aware of their massacre.  In 22 days of they dropped more than 10000 tons of bombs and shells over Gaza (just imagine!)   They also dropped white phosphorus bombs (which is an unauthorized weapon) massively over Gaza which burned hundreds of civilians including kids.   They attacked schools, hospitals and civilian houses with missiles and bombs (which arent comparable with Hamas rockets), asserting that Hamas use those buildings for military causes (note that those hospitals and schools were under control of UN and UNRWA).  But when protests around the world against israel assault expanded, they halted their attacks for while and focused on propaganda to divert protestors minds from their crimes and getting more credit from their allies.   ----------------  *Note that after their so called cease fire, they kept Humanitarian Aids blocked which resulted in death of hundreds of wounded civilians in hospitals.  ----------------    And they still attack Gaza from sky sea and ground, but all you hear in the news is that Hamas attacked israel with rockets!!!    -----------------------  WARNING!

And besides, how can this solution be achieved  what normal country would ever agree to add enemies who do not want the country to exist to itself?

In 1939, in the white paper it was stated that:   Jewish immigration to Palestine under the British Mandate was to be limited to 75,000 over the next five years, after which it would depend on Arab consent.   Previously no restriction had been imposed on the transfer of land from Arabs to Jews, while now the High Commissioner will be given general powers to prohibit and regulate transfers of land (which meant the Jews could hardly BUY land).   All these restriction were towards the Jews, not the Arabs! Equal rights?    Let me quote you George Orwell Everybody is equal. Some are more equal than the others.   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Paper...|`|54fdf2affdc8dc366315eec2cecd5920aa	In Israel, Arabs and Jews and others do live together.  They have equal rights.  The only difference for Arab Israelis is that they are not required to serve in the military, so they won't be required to fight other Arabs; but they can join the military if they wish.  It is in Gaza and West Bank that Jews and other religions run into problems.  In Gaza there are no Jews.  The reason the British didn't give the entire Mandate of Palestine to the Israelis is that many Arabs were unwilling to live peacefully with Jews, and actually wanted all Jews removed from the region.  That is why over 75% of the Mandate of Palestine was given to Arabs: most of it to Jordan, and the Gaza Strip was given to Egypt.  The West Bank of Jordan, and the Gaza Strip of Egypt kept attacking Israel with rockets until Israel finally took them over in 1967.  Jordan and Egypt do not want them back.  The extremists of Gaza and West Bank have kept up the idea that all Jews should be removed from the Middle East one way or another.  They don't want to be citizens of Israel.  So Israel is stuck with the task of trying to get them ready for self-government, while at the same time fending off their rocket and suicide attacks.  Not an easy task, but nobody else is willing to do it.  Well, that is basically the problem with a one-state solution.  Too many Arabs don't want to share a State with Jews.|`|2wsv8vz4aa	whose israel?    sounds like a black man.|`|YHeTQNpFaa	The ARABS refused the BRITISH MANDATE of 1948 which stated a single state for Jews and Arabs which the Arabs refused. Then there was another mandate which divided the region so the Arabs and Jews can have thier own land but the Palestinians still refused this compromised. They then  went to war with isreal,so did other arab nations. They lost the war and lost all territory they once owned excluding the Gaza strip and the west bank. now in 2008 they are pushing thier luck again with war against the Isrealis. If they push harder they'll be Pushed into the Red sea...IGNORANT FUCKS!!!!! O by the way i am not muslim, christian or a jew. i am a realist. and the reality of the fact is as long as Isreal has the backing of U.S. and half of Europe, The palestininas will continue to live in terror and peniury. They NEED put the arms down and start DIPLOMATIC talks. the so called HAMAS, a group of shameless men with no regard for life, are in hididn like cowards ordering the firing of rockets into Isreal. If they know they are very strong they shouldn't have hid, they should have shown thier ugly faces so they could be blown into pieces.|`|zy8mKJxeaa	That was tried in Lebanon with disastrous results for the Christians there. Israel would be crazy to follow that failed example.

8tQ8JLO5aa	My dad is 75, has been using computers since 1980.  Constructs web sites and gets his news off the internet, and has been for over 10 years.  He hasn't subscribed to a newspaper for at least 20 years.    For me, the evening news went obsolete 35 years ago, newpapers 30 years ago, and magazines 15 years ago.  Eventually obsolete(?), they have been for a long time...|`|zn0pXkc0aa	I am afraid the day of the print newspaper is pretty well over. Print copies may end up being more like magazines offered weekly while daily news coverage will be found online.    It is very expensive to print newspapers topped off with the speediness and timeliness of publishing an  e-edition I suspect most papers will be heading in that direction.    Our regional paper has quit delivering to our remote area as we can access the paper online for a fee.     Our local paper will start offering an e-edition this month.    Need I write more.    I am a retired print reporter BTW.|`|U1chPjvPaa	1. I don't like to read the newspaper online. It's really not as handy as you might think.  Besides there are times when I grab a section and take it with me to read later.  I do read some articles from out of state papers online.   I just like the feel of it in my hands, the sound of it too. It's just the best way to start the day, reading the paper with a cup of coffee.     2. I have two computers, my son has a broken one.  So as far as keeping the papers around for the elderly, I take offense. lol
