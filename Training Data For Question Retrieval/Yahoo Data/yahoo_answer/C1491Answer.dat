Z03nSGhEaa	Are you referring to whether he knew in the mind of his Spirit or in the mind of his flesh?<br>  <br>  1 Cor 2:11-16 <br>  11 For what man knoweth the things of a man, save the spirit of man which is in him? even so the things of God knoweth no man, but the Spirit of God. <br>  12 Now we have received, not the spirit of the world, but the spirit which is of God; that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God. <br>  13 Which things also we speak, not in the words which man's wisdom teacheth, but which the Holy Ghost teacheth; comparing spiritual things with spiritual. <br>  14 But the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness unto him: neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned. <br>  15 But he that is spiritual judgeth all things, yet he himself is judged of no man. <br>  16 For who hath known the mind of the Lord, that he may instruct him? But we have the mind of Christ. <br>  <br>  With a man who has the same nature as a man, who is also God & has the nature of God... this is the real question.<br>  <br>  The human baby who was a human, most likely had no thoughts that he was God.<br>  <br>  The Spirit in the baby knew all things.<br>  <br>  & it is the Spirit who did the works & spoke the words of Christ... & who we know as we know Jesus Christ... yet the human flesh, did not know all things...<br>  <br>  This is referred to as the dual nature... We do not worship the flesh or the human, nor did the disciples when they worshiped Jesus:<br>  <br>  Matthew 28:9 <br>  And as they went to tell his disciples, behold, Jesus met them, saying, All hail. And they came and held him by the feet, and worshiped him.<br>  <br>  They worshiped the Spirit of the Father in him: who is YHWH, whom all Jews worship:<br>  <br>  John 4:22-24 <br>  22 Ye worship ye know not what: we know what we worship: for salvation is of the Jews. <br>  23 But the hour cometh, and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth: for the Father seeketh such to worship him. <br>  24 God is a Spirit: and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth.<br>  <br>  Jesus & YHWH are one:<br>  <br>  John 10:30 <br>  I and my Father are one.<br>  John 14:9 <br>  Jesus saith unto him, Have I been so long time with you, and yet hast thou not known me, Philip? he that hath seen me hath seen the Father; and how sayest thou then, Shew us the Father?<br>  John 15:24 <br>  If I had not done among them the works which none other man did, they had not had sin: but now have they both seen and hated both me and my Father.<br>  <br>  They worshiped the one who raised Jesus from the dead:<br>  <br>  John 2:19-22 <br>  19 Jesus answered and said unto them, Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up. <br>  20 Then said the Jews, Forty and six years was this temple in building, and wilt thou rear it up in three days? <br>  21 But he spake of the temple of his body. <br>  22 When therefore he was risen from the dead, his disciples remembered that he had said this unto them; and they believed the scripture, and the word which Jesus had said.<br>  <br>  Romans 8:11 <br>  But if the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you, he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwelleth in you.<br>  <br>  If I make several characters on a computer... like on a game... they are not me, but I made them...<br>  If I make a character & then I control that character & everything that character does it does because I am controlling him, then you could say he is me... but I am really not a computer character...<br>  In the same sense God is really not a man or a human...<br>  If you asked me if my character knew my mothers maiden name, I'd have to say, "no"...<br>  If you asked if the baby understood he was God, I'd say, "no, probably not"<br>  Yet if you ask if I know my Mother's maiden name, I'd say "yes"<br>  Even though that character is me, it is not really me, it is just a representation of me in the computer.<br>  Well, God was not really that human baby... yet that human baby & that human mind, was limited, yet was the character of the Spirit of God on earth & was controlled such that everything he said & did was from & of God, & God never left him, but was always with him & the words he spoke & the works he did, were done by God in him...<br>  So really, God is a Spirit & not a man... but the man was God's manifestation of Himself in the flesh on earth.<br>  <br>  In the beginning was the Word (Logos)... & the Word was with God & the Word was God... & the word was made flesh & dwelt among us... & by Him were all things made that were made, & without him was nothing made that was made... <br>  & his name shall be called the Mighty God, the Everlasting Father...<br>  & out of you Bethlehem Ephratha, shall come forth a ruler & his goings forth shall be from of old, from Everlasting<br>  <br>  I am the alpha & the omega, the First & the Last, who was dead & am alive forever more...<br>  <br>  Hebrews 1:6 <br>  And again, when he bringeth in the firstbegotten into the world, he saith, And let all the angels of God worship him.|`|E71jweytaa	yes from birth he had divine knowledge<br>  <br>  he learned human knowledge just as any child would though|`|2Hot9EJiaa	Jesus was and is and always will be God-  He knew long before the creation of the world that He is God and that He would humble Himself and become a man, (but remain God) to die for our sins.

UVFtr5f4aa	Before octupulets,  Ms. Suleman went to a medical facility to have Ivf to have babies.  She has six children using IVF.  Each time the doctor put in several fertilized eggs and one or two babies popped out.  That is how she got the six children she already has.  Keep in mind, this lady every year goes to the doctors to do this.  <br>  <br>  The last time she did this, she had all the remaining eggs unfrozen which were six of them and had the doctor put them all in thinking she would get just one more , two babies at the tops. <br>  <br>  Problem-  The six turned into eight healthy babies and she did not want to do selective deduction (which means terminating the embryos). <br>  <br>  Problem- The doctors should have said NO they would not do the in the first place as she could barely afford too support the 6 she already had.  Second, They should have made sure she was aware that however small, that she could have these 6 or more babies by doing this.   <br>  <br>  People think she is mentally unstable because the numbers do not add up to how much time and money it will take to take care of all these kids. <br>  I don't think it would have been much of a controversy if she had a good plan and support system.  <br>  <br>  But she is a student and not even working and not in a steady relationship, with a grandmother who is over worked, tired, and trying her best to make the current situation work.|`|19fZOxiIaa	she is a loser. thats all there is to it.

Dark matter is postulated to explain the flat rotation curves of spiral galaxies and other evidence of "missing mass" in the universe. According to present observations of structures larger than galaxies, as well as Big Bang cosmology, dark matter and dark energy account for the vast majority of the mass in the observable universe. The observed phenomena which imply the presence of dark matter include the rotational speeds of galaxies, orbital velocities of galaxies in clusters, gravitational lensing of background objects by galaxy clusters such as the Bullet Cluster, and the temperature distribution of hot gas in galaxies and clusters of galaxies. Dark matter also plays a central role in structure formation and galaxy evolution, and has measurable effects on the anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background. All these lines of evidence suggest that galaxies, clusters of galaxies, and the universe as a whole contain far more matter than that which interacts with electromagnetic radiation: the remainder is frequently called the "dark matter component," even though there is a small amount of baryonic dark matter.<br>  <br>  The dark matter component has much more mass than the "visible" component of the universe. At present, the density of ordinary baryons and radiation in the universe is estimated to be equivalent to about one hydrogen atom per cubic meter of space. Only about 4% of the total energy density in the universe (as inferred from gravitational effects) can be seen directly. About 22% is thought to be composed of dark matter. The remaining 74% is thought to consist of dark energy, an even stranger component, distributed diffusely in space. Some hard-to-detect baryonic matter is believed to make a contribution to dark matter but would constitute only a small portion.Determining the nature of this missing mass is one of the most important problems in modern cosmology and particle physics. It has been noted that the names "dark matter" and "dark energy" serve mainly as expressions of human ignorance, much like the marking of early maps with "terra incognita|`|b9dae40ef8a10998c029b6d46aa0359daa	It is expanding, I'll call it the out flowing of "the energy of passion", Kundalini from love.|`|EepiLrmZaa	it is not all together. the universe is expanding..........|`|iYEWbE23aa	Cheap school glue.
dAcNaajsaa	Well, shariah law is the law of God and american law is the law of america.<br>  <br>  So i think if you want wehat is best for your true life, and that is the life in the hereafter, which is a lot longer than this present life, and if you want to spread the truth and work for that, then I think the choice is easy. Shouldn't be confusing at all.<br>  <br>  If it is confusing, I suggest you read the Qur'aan again and the answer will be clear insha'allaah.<br>  <br>  'I wish to become an imam/teacher/scholar in Islam and also a lawyer'<br>  <br>  a lawyer following which law ? the law of God or any disbelieving country's law ?<br>  <br>  Because you do realise you will have to justify how you lived your life to God right ?

If you become a doctor especially one specializing in female problems, or issues, like gynaecology (to all, i questioner is a female) and do so for the pleasure of God, then the benefits are trully much much much much GREATER than being a lawyer, in this world and of course, in the hereafter which is what matters.<br>  <br>  The choice is easy.

However, if you would like a job in Europe, or dealing with Europe, go with a Scandinavian language, they are also much easier to learn.<br>  <br>  For you I would consider Portuguese or even better, French.

apMjpmogaa	As a general rule, girls value intimacy and human relationships more than just about anything else. So anorexia, sex, and trying to be popular are all the result of the desire to have good, close relationships with the people who matter to them, and sometimes going about it in the wrong way. I would say the best thing you can do for female friends who are making bad decisions is encourage them and help them to know that you care. Make sure you are doing it in a way that honors them, rather than just using it to manipulate them to your advantage. If you manipulate, you make the problem worse. You could try to talk to her about a particular thing that concerns you (anorexia, for example) but it is generally better to have someone in authority (a parent, a pastor/priest, a counselor) talk to her about sensitive topics. The root causes are probably a lot deeper than what you can see, so it will take more than just a simple conversation to get her back on the right track.<br>  If you pray, I would recommend it.

You can absolutely be a good girl and kiss alot.<br>  She didn't even say if she was romantically involved with these people. Not that it's any of your business.

AA10945101	Which came first, the chicken or the egg?  <br>  <br>  I don't think you can assess the intent of the questions independently of the setting.  Fact is, atheists spend a lot of time in this section using scientific theories and concepts to question or refute Christian beliefs.  Makes sense that they would respond by requesting further clarification or justification.  By the same token, I see a ton of questions by atheists asking Christians to explain and defend the bible   Who started it?  Irrelevant, it is simply a natural reaction to ask people to explain and defend anything they use to attack you.  <br>  <br>  In other words, their questions aren't an expression of interest nor are they necessarily a sign that they didn't learn about those theories and concepts...just as an atheist's questions about the bible aren't an expression of interest or a sign that they haven't studied the topic.    Instead, their questions are a legitimate demand for an adversary to explain and justify their "evidence".  <br>  <br>  I'm also wondering where you were educated if you think it is possible for anyone, even Christians, to be old enough to participate in this forum and NOT have learned quite a bit about "certain scientific theories and concepts" in school.  I also think it is a tad narrow-minded to limit "science" to they types of scientific theories and concepts discussed in this section...you know, the ones you interpret as evidence that my beliefs are delusional.<br>  <br>  Most of us took the same required classes in science...in high school and even in college...but if you didn't major in science in college, then what makes you think that we didn't learn the same things you learned in those classes?  The choice to believe in God or not affects a person's perspective on the things they learn.  This is basic psychology...the ways people deal with cognitive dissonance, the psychological tension caused by uncertaintly about a decision made with less than perfect information (in other words, all human decisions).  <br>  <br>  In essence, people can respond to cognitive dissonance in one of three ways: (1) searching for information to confirm their belief that the made the right decision, (2) avoiding information that might force them to accept that they made the wrong decision, or (3) revoking the original decision. ...and keep in mind that cognitive dissonance frequently operates at a completely subconscious level.  You may not think that you have any doubts about whether you're right about God, but it would be a sign of a completely irrational mind if you didn't have some...and I know you're not irrational!  On some level, we all KNOW that we can NEVER KNOW (for sure!) whether we made the correct choice about God...voila, some level of cognitive dissonance influencing our perspective on everything you learn!<br>  <br>  You see, I took those same science classes you took, perhaps even more,   However, with my belief in God firmly in place, I simply found little of value in the information...it didn't confirm what I believed about God, some people suggested that it refuted what I believed, and nothing was sufficient to make me change my original decision to believe.  Instead, I found FAR more value in the social sciences...particularly sociology and psychology...both focused on understanding people which is surely a prerequisite for showing love to them as Jesus commanded! <br>  <br>  On the flip side, while sitting in those same classes with your lack of belief in God (or even a weak belief better classified as hope rather than faith), you found evidence to confirm what you believed, evidence  you thought could be used to refute anyone that suggested you were wrong, and perhaps even enough to recind an earlier decision to believe in God (I don't know if you are a "natural" or "converted" atheist *smile*).  As such, you place more value on that information, perhaps to the point where you consider it "essential common knowledge"...like reading, writing, mathematics.  Makes sense, it was essential to your beliefs (or lack thereof, whichever you prefer) so it must be essential for everyone to know this if they are going to discover the "truth" too (your version, of course).|`|L6E6lDGKaa	Christians sit in the same classrooms atheists sit in. We learn the same science you learn. We see the same evidence you see. Our worldview is different and science does nothing to change that. That's what happens when scientific discovery requires an opinion.<br>  <br>  What's that say about science? It means there is more than one explanation of the evidence. You start out with the assumption that all we see came into existence on it's own. We do not assume that.|`|rqH8mAM2aa	science is one my best interest.<br>  but i seek the wisdom , <br>  to us this knowledge!|`|3EudCWEuaa	They learn science from real scientists, not just what a textbook says.<br>  <br>  Or what some guy like Dawkins writes (who has made ZERO contribution to science by the way).<br>  <br>  Instead, I would rather hear the views of the REAL geniuses like Einstein, Isaac Newton, and Francis Collins.|`|AA10641825	I am asking them to consider getting back in school.<br>  <br>  I'm saying "Church folks, what do you have to lose?

9agMsmCyaa	It does say clearly in the Bible that anybody who commits adultery can't have a good relationship with God 1Corinthians6:9,10 and verse 11 says that some had been that way so it's possible to achieve a good standing with God again, if you repent. It's logical when you think about it - even those who don't necessarily believe in God feel that adultery is an awful thing to do.  Life is very complex and there are many reasons why somebody who was a JW may choose to commit adultery.  It's important to know that you can't be 'excommunicated' - we say disfellowshipped if you are truly sorry for what you did.<br>  Disfellowshipping has a basis in the Bible please read the following:<br>   Awake magazine 96 9/8 Why Disfellowshipping Is a Loving Arrangement<br>  <br>  The Bible’s Viewpoint<br>  <br>  EXCOMMUNICATION—the very idea stirs up mixed feelings among many religious people. Most people agree that religions need some sort of discipline. But many view excommunication as a relic from the past—a harsh style of discipline that reminds them of witch-hunts and inquisitions.<br>  <br>  Adding to the problem is the pervasive influence of the secular world. Thus, most of Christendom’s religions have adopted a more tolerant view of sin. Little wonder, then, that one Episcopalian minister said: “Excommunication is part of our tradition, but I don’t think it’s been invoked in this century.”<br>  <br>  However, many people may be surprised to learn that among Jehovah’s Witnesses, disfellowshipping (the equivalent of excommunication) is taken seriously. Granted, it is not an easy action to take, but it is a loving arrangement. How so?<br>  <br>  It Upholds God’s Name<br>  <br>  Jehovah is a holy God. He does not tolerate deliberate sin on the part of those claiming to worship him. The apostle Peter wrote to Christians: “Become holy yourselves in all your conduct, because it is written: ‘You must be holy, because I am holy.’” (1?Peter 1:15, 16) So disfellowshipping unrepentant sinners upholds God’s holy name; it shows love for that name.—Compare Hebrews 6:10.<br>  <br>  Does this mean that if a Christian succumbs to weakness or stumbles into grave sin, he is automatically expelled from the congregation? By no means! Jehovah is not a coldhearted dictator. He is merciful and understanding. He remembers that we are imperfect. (Psalm 103:14) Jehovah recognizes that “all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God.” (Romans 3:23) God has arranged for spiritual help within the congregation so that if a Christian takes a “false step” or even commits a serious sin, he may be lovingly ‘readjusted’ in a spirit of mildness. (Galatians 6:1) By accepting counsel from God’s Word and demonstrating heartfelt sorrow and genuine repentance, one who has strayed from the path of righteousness can “get healed” spiritually.—James 5:13-16.<br>  <br>  What, though, if a baptized Christian seriously errs and all efforts to restore him are unsuccessful? In other words, what if he stubbornly refuses to correct his sinful course?<br>  <br>  It Keeps the Congregation Safe<br>  <br>  The Bible commands Christians: “Quit mixing in company with anyone called a brother that is a fornicator or a greedy person or an idolater or a reviler or a drunkard or an extortioner, not even eating with such a man.”—1?Corinthians 5:11.<br>  <br>  Is this Bible law harsh and demeaning? Just consider this: When a hardened criminal is sent to prison for breaking the law, is that viewed as harsh or coldhearted? No, because the public has the right to safeguard the peace and security of the community. In effect, the criminal is disfellowshipped from law-abiding society during his prison term.<br>  <br>  Similarly, the Christian congregation is justified in expelling unrepentant wrongdoers from their midst. Why? Because the congregation must be a haven from immoral predators and other willful practicers of sin.<br>  <br>  Realizing that “one sinner can destroy much good,” the apostle Paul commanded fellow believers: “Remove the wicked man from among yourselves.” (Ecclesiastes 9:18; 1?Corinthians 5:13) This action prevents the sinner from spreading corruption in the congregation, and it protects the congregation’s good name.—Compare 1?Timothy 3:15.<br>  <br>  Protection for Individuals<br>  <br>  Disfellowshipping also protects individual members of the congregation. Let us illustrate: Imagine being roused from sleep by the noisy blast of a car horn or alarm. The piercing sound is difficult to ignore; indeed, it startles you! Likewise, when someone is expelled from the congregation, the action hopefully grabs the attention of every member of the flock. It disturbs their senses. It cannot be ignored. How may this be a protection?<br>  <br>  “When I first heard at the Kingdom Hall that someone had been disfellowshipped, my initial reaction was shock,” says one Witness. “Then it humbled me. It made me realize that I too could fall.” As her words indicate, disfellowshipping can move others to take stock of their conduct.—1?Corinthians 10:12.<br>  <br>  By asking ourselves questions such as ‘Are there any areas of my lif|`|d065dd48110ed50d780ec1de848b4c9aaa	I wish to direct my answer not only to the question but to pestie58.<br>  If the salvation of Jesus Christ is not believed in then how do you expect to understand acceptance in the church?|`|zHZOxfbVaa	they believe that communicating with sinners will get them killed in the so called end of the world when "Jehovah" will destroy all wicked|`|52fc15f3a628fde8d25145163ff38134aa	If they were really following the bible they would have stoned her publicly.<br>  i think she got off easy|`|GEfUTyi8aa	gosh, they ex-communicate you if you buy christmas gifts for anyone.... their a cult......|`|zyxY4dbMaa	No it is not in the Bible.

Medical use should be perfectly fine.

Their standards are proven to be pretty darn high, but even IDENTYFYING Babylon The Great as false religion can not be proven from the bible, much less that all other religions are part of it<br>  <br>  23 The "congregation" of Matthew 18:17 is "the body of elders" (Matthew 18:17) 17 If he does not listen to them, speak to the congregation If he does not listen even to the congregation, let him be to you just as a man of the nations and as a tax collector footnote Or, "to the ecclesia (assembly)" Gr, teiek?kle?si′ai; how can you go from congregation/assembly to "body of elders"?<br>  <br>  24 Not "partaking" at the "memorial"<br>  <br>  25Secret kangaroo courts not mentioned in bible.

Jesus associated with sinners and non-believers<br>  <br>  29Requiring a confession of certain types of sins to a group of elders The NT is clear that forgiveness only comes through Christ's sacrifice There's a passage in James that says 'if there is anyone sick among you, let him call the older men' The WT interprets this to mean that "spiritually sick" JWs have to confess really bad sins (fornication, drunkenness, stealing, etc) to elders But that's a bit of a stretch<br>  <br>  30 Disfellowshipping for smoking While I agree that it's a rotten habit, there's no Biblical basis for casting someone out of the congregation for smoking, definitely beyond what is written and I bet there are many other things they df for that are not biblical<br>  <br>  31 Allowing women to comment and give parts on meetings Paul is explicit and clear in 1 Cor 14:34-35 that women are to be silent in church Period This is an example of how JWs pick and choose which parts of the Bible to take literally When Paul says to "abstain from blood," the JWs say that means to completely abstain; but for some reason, when Paul says for women to be silent in church, they don't think that means to be completely silent Inconsistent much<br>  <br>  33 Disfellowshipping for gambling for sure beyond what is written.

Those who fall into serious wrongdoing who do not repent pose a spiritual threat to others in the hall and are thus disfellowshipped. Each situation is different in nature, extent, and motive, and so the circumstances of her disfellowshipping may vary. All in all, if she attends meetings faithfully and shows a repentent attitude, she will be warmly accepted when she is reinstated.|`|QyAyQf3Laa	Yes, it is true. Many times they are warned when such behavior is noted, but if they do not stop with the adultery and fornication, and don't heed the warnings then they are disfellowshipped because it is said that the organization must stay clean and set an example to others who would copy the same offense.<br>  <br>  God unequivocally is quite clear on adultery:<br>  <br>  1 Corinthians 6: 9 - 11:<br>  <br>  What!

So far the society has not taken the matter seriously and the victim is subject to lose her home and be out on the street. The woman is a Jehovah's Witness and is disabled just having major surgery.<br>  <br>  The person at the society in New York told her "Well, you are a complainer and a murmerer", but said nothing at all to the illegally behaving, fraudulent, slanderous woman who is victimizing the disabled woman. I think it has to do with race because the victim is Black and the persecutor is white... a stupid white trash woman who has lied to police, state agencies, and anyone who will listen to her because they are all white bigots also.<br>  <br>  She, the white woman should be disfellowshipped, but they are so hard up on adulterers that forgers and frauds, and slanderers, gossipers are allowed to be ignored!<br>  <br>  The truths in the Bible are just that.. truth, but the people in the organization are a bunch of hypocrites, liars, and bigots.

RtFO8cUbaa	Exactly right! <br>  <br>  <br>   This is about the best proof anyone can offer that what calls itself Christianity in America today is deeply flawed.  I'm assuming that the question was posted by an agnostic or an atheist, which leads to another question:  If the person who posted the question gets it--why don't all the religious people see the point?<br>  <br>  Claiming to have the inside edge with the Holy Spirit is a cop-out especially when what that "spirit-filled" person is saying is contrary to the historic claims of Christianity.  If it doesn't line up with an INFORMED reading of Scripture, with the Nicene Creed, or the Apostles Creed, then it is most likely heresy.<br>  <br>  If left entirely to the individual, then yes, nobody's interpretation--whether from a faith perspective, or from none--would be any more valid than the next person's.|`|0sdVIuiFaa	What it means is, that gives them an allowance to treat non christians like pieces of sh*t when we quote the bible for an argument/doiscussion.<br>  <br>  See, when we quote something, it is 'mistranslated' 'misinformed' mis this, mis that. Because we are not christian, we are 'taking words out of context'. We need special glasses. When you have the 'holy spirit' it means you skip over the rape, murder, sacrifice etc and skip straight to the happy sunflowery parts (ie ignore when a non believer points out the obvious attrocities in this book).|`|BKPnG6HKaa	I don't believe that you need the Holy Spirit in order to understand the Bible.  I do believe that pastors and priests know the Bible better than your average person, but even some parts of the Bible no one really knows like Revelation.|`|5WIZowKOaa	Holy Spirit is Gods active force or power. It is by means of His power that He accomplishes what He has set out to do including guiding and helping us.|`|2d3c0dd80f2737f4fd6ec8f62b612c70aa	The variety of contradicting interpretations we find today among so-called Christians is not the fault of the Bible’s Author, nor is it the fault of Bible writers. As God’s prophets, these “spoke from God as they were borne along by holy spirit.” (2?Peter 1:20,?21) It is the fault of Bible readers who have failed to follow the leadings of God’s spirit in allowing God to interpret his own Word. They have allowed personal ideas to becloud their view of what the Bible’s Author himself says. <br>  <br>  First, we can consider the immediate context of the scripture in question. What if you cannot understand a scripture even after you have considered its context? You may benefit from comparing it with other scriptures, having in mind the overall tenor of the Bible. One excellent tool for doing this can be found in the New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures, now available in whole or in part in 57 languages. This tool is a list of marginal references, or cross-references, that appears in the center column of each page in many of its editions. You can find more than 125,000 of them in the New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures—With References. The “Introduction” to that Bible explains: “A careful comparison of the marginal references and an examination of the accompanying footnotes will reveal the interlocking harmony of the 66 Bible books, proving that they comprise one book, inspired by God.”<br>  www.watchtower.org|`|L6E6lDGKaa	There is not really all that much to understand. The primary purpose of the Bible is to reveal Jesus the Messiah. When Jesus left he said the Holy Spirit would come in his place. Revelation starts with a humble heart and a willing spirit. Leaders exist in all walks of life. All of us start out as children and we need to grow into maturity. That applies to the secular and the spiritual part of us. Ultimately, the responsibility rests with each one of us.<br>  <br>  Atheists interpret the Bible incorrectly because they want to prove it inaccurate. Wrong motivation always leads to error. It has stood the test of time and weathered the skepticism from all generations.|`|rTplTuEdaa	A  true child  of    God            will let the Holy  Spirit lead them<br>    in the word of God and not just  take a Minister,s word for it all.,<br>    we must read the word to know if they are teaching right,,I  can tell<br>     you  the minute a Preacher get,s out of the Bible or get,s it wrong.|`|hQDapmICaa	1Co 11:18  For first of all, when ye come together in the church, I hear that there be divisions among you; and I partly believe it. <br>  <br>  1Co 11:19  For there must be also heresies among you, that they which are approved may be made manifest among you. <br>  <br>  <br>  Peace!<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  So having said that, that would make an atheist's (or Buddhists, or Muslims, etc) interpretation of the bible just as valid as yours or your priests, no?<br>  <br>  Absolutely no! If they understood the message, they would not be a Muslim or a Buddist.|`|4sUek7ugaa	And why does the Holy Spirit give people such different answers?  I've read internet arguments between fundamentalist KJV-only believers who can't agree on what many of the passages mean despite both insisting that they have the Holy Spirit in them, never mind the disagreements among denominations.|`|K24JFTOcaa	that proves we are not a mindless cult<br>  <br>  no, you all purposely take scripture out of context|`|dd1bce7bddbe2e3eb6a98a7a76a80171aa	When it comes to the "Bible's message" there is no real dissension. The message is that we sinned, and God has a plan to save us. Granted there are many details that on a cursory reading may cause confusion, but that does not negate the fact that there is an external objective truth that the Holy Spirit reveals to those who diligently seek it. Many place their own interpretation on God's word, but true understanding is given by the Holy Spirit. Many wrong answers do not make the correct answer also wrong.  Also know that God works with us where we are at, and full knowledge of truth is not a prerequisite for salvation.

macZI2dzaa	The ancient ritual turned modern sacramentalism, talking to Mary, is in fact, necromancy.  Contact with the dead, righteous or not, is an abomination according to the Bible.<br>  The only confirmation you will get is from your own seared mind or from demons. <br>  You may not feel worthy to talk to the Father, but you better start with deep and serious repentance if you have been involved with necromancy.|`|XsTJPMHqaa	I pray to Mary and trust that she heard me, and trust that she is taking my prayers to the throne of God, because the Bible says so.<br>  <br>  I try not to rely on such vague and possibly biased things as 'confirmation in my soul'. <br>  <br>  God grants that the saints can hear our prayers, so the fact that she is a human doesn't matter, and as she is perfectly united to Christ, she may very well know everything He does - as do all saints in Heaven. I don't know.|`|boqwvEvUaa	according to the catholic faith, Mary, as the mother of God, has a much higher status than saints. she isn't all-knowing, but hears prayers offered to her for intercession, and in turn presents them to JC/God for consideration. <br>  i dunno about the confirmation in the spirit thing ;) i'm sure it's mainly faith, though, which is pretty much the basis of Christianity.|`|AA11466759	Well, yes, of course I do.<br>  I once did a novena for my cousin who had died suddenly, and at the end of it, I had a sense that Mary helped her soul get out of a smokey place.

Zzhgpe0Paa	So far, Obama has not attended a church service since taking office, save for Easter. The problem, it seems, is security.

FOzN3xwzaa	John 3:16 says WHOSOEVER will BELIEVE in Jesus for salvation, is saved. <br>  <br>  It's not by "walking an isle" or "saying a prayer" or "committing to Christ".   It is only by BELIEVING in Jesus alone to save you, without adding any of your own works.  When you believe, then you are going to heaven, no matter what!  :)<br>  <br>  Jesus, who is God, died for our sins on the cross as FULL PAYMENT for all our sins, and then Jesus rose from the dead.  Believe this and you are going to heaven no matter what!  :)|`|ahZ0qEfsaa	yes they can as long as the except christ into there heart  god forgives us of all our sins and he casts it out as far as the east is from the west...|`|XN0cYCATaa	Once ! Just Once, ! You need not do it again.<br>  <br>  What people feel when they are experiencing doubt is Spiritual warfare, The Holy Spirit Convicts us of sin, and this is good, But satan condemns us of sin this is bad, he does this so as to rob us of the joy of our salvation.|`|pvabglXhaa	You commit your life to Christ once only, that is all that is needed to accept Him.<br>  <br>  There is no more requirement than that.  "It" works from the very time you give your life over to the Lord.<br>  <br>  Do not think that just because you have become a Christian that you won't sin again.  We are all born sinners, that is part of our nature.<br>  <br>  We pray as follows:  forgive us our sins as we also forgive those that sin against us.  Why do you think that's part of the Lord's prayer?<br>  Because we will keep sinning till the day we die.<br>  <br>  With Jesus in our life though, we become more mindful of what sin actually is, the laws to live by and you also will find that your conscience goes into overdrive when you are about to do something wrong.<br>  <br>  Jesus will accept everyone, he wants every person on earth to come to him and have everlasting life.  There is no such thing as chosen ones when it comes to Jesus' glory.  How can you think that when you look back at some of the figures in history who reluctantly obeyed God.  Do some of those people seem to you like chosen ones?  What was so special about them?<br>  <br>  Nothing, they were ordinary people going about their ordinary lives.  Just like you,  just like me.<br>  <br>  Believe that you have been saved, maybe it's all new to you and you need to grow into your new found faith.  Take some time and fire all your questions to someone who can give you answers.  I know I did.  It took me years to understand what I'd even gotten myself into.  No regrets though, God is my whole life.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.

FbKNDrmzaa	what/where would be your 'atheist paradise'? <br>  -Another planet, another galaxy, far away from Earth.|`|zeRRinDOaa	What a foolish question!|`|nr62qH0Caa	Any modern civilized and secular country will do, as I assume they afford their citizens religious freedom. "Secular" is not a dirty word. It simply means that the public life of the citizenry is not dominated by laws based on a religion.You enjoy that freedom, I enjoy that freedom. Right here in America. Your question makes me wonder what you would consider to be a perfect paradise version of America. Would it be the paradise you seek if the prevailing religion were not the same as your own?|`|OgnT6371aa	That would be "where", and to your first responder, um, no- Hitler was not a Christian; Hitler hated Christianity like a rabid dog but wholly embraced the Roman Catholic church and the Vatican and its puppet-masters.<br>  <br>  Big difference.<br>  <br>  Of course he would; they bankrolled his entire regime and war machine.|`|9vqnTVo9aa	Norway, Sweden, Denmark and Japan are predominately Atheist.  Yup, those are some nasty countries.<br>  <br>   Your question displays your ignorance.  Governments like Nazi Germany, early communist China, Pol Pot in Cambodia and Stalin's Soviet Union were their own religions.  The people could not worship God, Allah or Vishnu, they had to worship their leaders.  So Nazism, Communism and the others are like their own religions.  Maybe you should educate yourself more before asking stupid questions.|`|txhRsUe6aa	you are such a nasty judgemental little specimen aren't you, and you will go to hell because the bible says only jesus and god have the right to judge. britain is an atheist country (55% are atheist) but i note you conveniently forget about that don't you!|`|jaQqS7jFaa	I don't know if you're being serious or not, but what makes you think that America would go to the dump without the belief in God?

"All we are is dust in the wind."  (Kansas)<br>  <br>  So with no right or wrong possible, what goes through my mind is it doesn't matter what Christians do.  It can't be better or worse than anyone else because regardless of what is done or not done, everything turns to dust.<br>  <br>  dust = life = dust<br>  <br>  Now do the math.|`|gGmMw2vDaa	I pray to the FSM for the sole of the foolish fairy fanatic.|`|AA10641825	I hope they have better luck than I did.

jLL7sDILaa	Immortal vampires do not exist. Real vampires are human. Being bitten does not make you a vampire.|`|Het9lG90aa	youd be surprised how many psychos believe in vampires<br>  <br>  and how many think there actually vampires<br>  <br>  both belong in mental hospitals|`|33E9E96iaa	Well, it is hard to understand, but I do not believe in the "bitten" theory due to exponential growth. And the underground subculture is... interesting, but very unlikely. I'm guessing that what happened was that the "real vampires" died out back when people were superstitious, and now all that's left are the weak, sanguine and psych hybrids that show up now and then. That's just my theory though, because mythical vampires are so different from the "vampire" culture today.|`|QMmDVjNraa	I think they would be an evolved version of the Human being. <br>  Or a Human that captures a virus that gives you the symptoms of being a vampire.  <br>  <br>  The immortal thing might be possible if they could regenerate dead cells or replace them.  <br>  <br>  Check this out, it has scientific theories about vamps<br>  <br>  www.fvza.org|`|QS5QnHpbaa	Hmm maybe they can be real, who knows? Those immortal vampires from pop culture can breed with humans so they are of the same species just with special abilities like psychics, witches and superheroes; not sure about werewolves though.|`|fhnyfRTxaa	theres no such thing as an immortal vamp|`|G17CSiL6aa	Well there are several different kinds of vampires. For example, some are born vampires, so those kind really are a different species from humans. Their heart beats and everything and they can blend in with humans better than most vampires but they have very distinct personalities. The vampires that come from being bit by vampires are practically dead corpses who crave blood- not so much different from zombies. There's also a certain type of which craft that can be performed on already dead humans- for example, if you light a specific kind of black candle over a human corpse and let the wax run over it's cold skin and burn it, it will become possessed and have certain vampiric natures. So I guess what I'd say is most would be completely different species and easy to recognize, but the born vampires are very well hidden.|`|1CFbGkAgaa	well im half vampire, and i kno for a fact there is no immortal vampires that live and there is not a subculture underground.|`|kIEZ2HOgaa	i think that life is a mystery and dont let anyone tell you different!! vampires are so cool and u have probably met one before(not in day light silly)
df089a1d7acdbf674fc91dddc4748277aa	You mind your own business, she must have plenty of opportunities to call the police herself, its difficult I had the same experience and called the police the woman who was being beaten up then verbally attacked me and told me to mind my own f**king business.|`|b1256d852b56b556e6bb26806d1c64eaaa	I think all the better if you DID call the cops - they would then be able to record the screams & use it as evidence.

The next time , call the police and if you get questioned about it , tell them you were out for about two hours or so when the incident occured and be sure to know exactly when it occured so you can tell them the hours you were out . Also if they threaten you in any way , call the police back and have them come out again .|`|7fdcd76738d2afbc3ff09cd9c935148baa	They live next door too you & they seem rough? I agree with the other answerer's about calling the police, but don`t you think you should know who`s living next door? Maybe when he`s gone out one day you could invite her round for coffee & get to know her & make a decision based on that.|`|fQgbBx7caa	You need to call the police, what happens if he kills her, the police questioned you if you heard any noise, knowing you did you could be in trouble for not reporting it.|`|1305765249b53f290c467decdedb9e3aaa	yeah maybe speak to her (your neighbor) if she seems at all approachable: and say what the hell is going on in your house and convince her to phone the police or you will !|`|GqfiRXu3aa	Telephone the police.

You're calling cuz you care, not because you hate.....what if he does something he REALLY regrets, like an accidental homicide or permanently injures her?  And you had the chance to stop it but didn't......can you live with it?  Call next time.....those things rarely get better unless something bad happens or they move out.....|`|bndE2CXoaa	It is your social duty to call the police.  911.  Not only to protect a fellow citizen, but because the guy has no right to disturb you either.  Something he is doing when he gets into that kind of action against his girlfriend.  You may always say that your call was because your peace was being disturbed by such kind of incident.  But anyway, if the guy finds out that it was you who called, so what?  Are you going to wait until the guy kills her?  Adian.|`|S4zNEAFJaa	Don't hesitate!!! Call the cops! I was beat up by my ex-boyfriend and I was screaming at the top of my lungs when it happened!

You can explain to them that you are worried about retaliation and you would like to remain anonomous...if you are the only neighbor, that's going to be tricky, but the police are usually willing to try their hardest to keep you safe.  It could have been reported by someone who saw the girlfriend @ the grocery store w/ bruises or something...<br>  <br>  It sounds like you are renting and probably have a landlord...I would notify them too.  If there is a domestic abuser in the building, it's not really safe for anyone.  State that #1 you are fearful for the girlfriend, and it is also becoming a noise problem, as well as putting you in a difficult situation as to whether you should report it or not.|`|CRozjN6vaa	The reason he's abusing her is that no one is doing anything about it.You may also suffer a bit till the law gets the full story of your neighborhood bully. If you call the police every time he's a problem they will soon know, he is the problem. At that point all the fun of being a problem will drain away and he will ooze down the drain with it. If nothing changes, nothing will change.|`|n0rJH0l6aa	I'd call the police, but not 999. I'd go to a police station and ask what they think you should do about it. Report is as a public disturbance.

If she answers the door looking a bit battered then I'd just smile and ask if she's alright, so she knows I'm there for her.  And if he answers the door I'll smile too, so he also knows I'm there, and ask him if everything is alright.  It could all be a misunderstanding, but I'd want them to know that we can hear what is going on, and if she needs help all she has to do is give me a look.|`|9LzlIgoJaa	Call the police and if she happens to leave then see if you could help.

It's not that she can't be trusted - it's hat she's going through an emotional crisis right now.<br>  <br>  Her friend is being immature and petty.

Her friend should have accepted that your sister was unable to tell and still reach out and offer support if she ever needs it.<br>  <br>  <br>  Yes, the friend is being very self centered, and needs to learn a lesson about growing up and life. She's not going to keep many friends if thisis the way she is going to behave.<br>  <br>  my advice is to be there for your sister and give her all of the support she needs. She needs YOU to be her best-friend right now, because hers was so crappy.

For example as regards pollution, the ozone layer, huge cars etc it's not that they don't care about the environment, more that they are not aware of the problem. Most of the Americans I spoke to had not even heard of the ozone layer, and laughed at the idea of a car having an engine of less than 2L. This is not because they are stupid, it's because they are not told!<br>  <br>  It seemed as if they were living in a bubble which contained only the US of A, and they were being fed only news which their government wanted them to know. Most of them couldn't even tell me what the currency of the UK was! They seemed to have absolutely no idea of how the rest of the world feels about them. On the contrary, the general belief seemed to be that the US is the greatest country on the planet, and that every other country wished to be just like the US.<br>  <br>  Before anyone disses me on this, I repeat that I was well aware that this was because they were literally not being given information from the rest of the world, and not because they are stupid, ignorant, or uncaring, which is often how they are actually portrayed outside of their own country.|`|2Lj980slaa	Our Waxworks Museum had a poll in the days of Reagan.<br>  It was simple - Which person did you hate the most today.<br>  Reagan was top, Adolf Hitler was second.<br>  Americans never get told how wicked they are, so no, they will never realise.|`|yGWoxnDXaa	ok i'm british but this question is really offensive. <br>  What do you mean they're the bad guys, have you met every single american to know that?? what are you on about? there are bad and good people in  every country grow up.|`|UvkF2pZraa	im a bad person?<br>  i didnt know that!!!|`|XFZmAMOAaa	We aren't the bad guys.I have spoken and thats that.

Our Constitution has an anti-establishment clause which expressly forbids us being or becoming a "Christian nation." The "In God We Trust" motto and the addition of "under God" to the Pledge were knee-jerk reactionary additions to combat the "Red Menace" of the McCarthy-era 1950s, to further differentiate us from the godless commies. It's past time they were discarded, as they are an insult to the document upon which our free society is based.<br>  <br>  Also, the 6th Article of the Constitution forbids the election of a president based solely upon his religion.

In addition, there must be proof that he/she is responsible for at least one miracle. <br>  <br>  A likely candidate is then "beatified," which means people may pray to the person and ask he or she to intervene with God on their behalf. Beatification reflects the pope's declaration that a deceased person is in heaven and is worthy of veneration. <br>  <br>  Canonization, or full sainthood, follows after an undetermined number of years.|`|4lHJEq5Haa	A person must be righteous and virtuous.<br>  <br>  The person must be from that particular religion.<br>  <br>  Some religions require that the person has to have passed away and attained a place in heaven before they can be considered for Sainthood. Others acknowledge Sainthood as a state that can be achieved while a person is living too.<br>  <br>  The person needs to have performed miracles while living and or after death.

But when man look for a saint they do not look for the same standers as God does.|`|XsTJPMHqaa	The canonization process takes a long time. Usually there is a period of waiting after the death of someone, years, to make sure their 'popularity' doesn't bias the outcome. First they have their life examined, which can result in them being called "Venerable", that is, worthy of imitation because they were a good Catholic. Then they must have a miracle attributed to their intercession (someone prays to that saint, asking that saint to pray for a miraculous cure or result, and it comes true.) Once that's verified, they are "Blessed". They still have to have another miracle attributed to them before they are canonized a saint.|`|ef4edd8f1c0d16fab298d474bf08b339aa	With the Roman Catholic church; they require "miracles" and "goodness".<br>  <br>  With God; you believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, get baptized in the Spirit of God, and you are His saint.<br>  <br>  The difference is vital.

If you were born with a gender identity which does not match your body, want the surgery, and seek to live a mainstream and non-LGBT life, then you are a TS.  But if you want to live as a half and half, keep your original parts, and/or live an LGBT life, then you would be a TG.<br>  <br>  But where are you getting the HRT if not from a doctor?  They are not something to just play with.  They are serious medications which could cause life-threatening complications.<br>  <br>  But if you must, lie and say you are getting them from another doctor who is not an endo, and ask for the blood-work.  With androgen blockers, it depends which ones you are on.  Androcur is very potent and just bad news for someone to take without a doctor, and very risky even with a doctor.  With Spironolactone, you would have to monitor your electrolytes and your blood pressure.  With estrogens, you'd have to check liver function, clot times, prolactin levels, cholesterol, lipids, tryglicerides, complete blood count, etc.|`|KnTrvQd6aa	Honey, I've just read (and answered) your other question.<br>  <br>  You're NOT getting hormones; you're taking placebos.<br>  <br>  Talk to your doctor; ask him to refer you to a gender clinic, or a therapist with experience in gender issues. At your age, you might (and I do mean 'might') be able to get androgen blockers prescribed, but you will have to wait to get any active hormone treatment.<br>  <br>  And, no, your doctor won't tell your parents anything you discuss with him on a professional basis; he's not allowed to.

I have read God's word previously, but in this class I literally received my very own copy, and we personalized the covers; thus, this Bible meant more than I could ever convey!!! What does Jesus mean to me? Christ is the one who poured joy into my heart by means of the Bible's words~he is the one I see in every human being I pass.

Abortifacient Contraceptives<br>  <br>  (click on small thumbnails for larger photos) <br>  <br>  There are many methods of abortion. The procedure used depends largely upon the stage of pregnancy and the size of the unborn child. Dr. J.C. Willke, in his book, Abortion: Questions and Answers (Hayes Publishing Co. Inc, Cincinnati, 1985), has divided the methods of abortion into three main categories: those that invade the uterus and kill the child by instruments which enter the uterus through the cervix; those that kill the preborn child by administration of drugs and then induce labour and the delivery of a dead baby; and, those that invade the uterus by abdominal surgery.<br>  <br>  Dilation of the uterus is required in cervical methods of abortion. The usual method of dilation is to insert a series of instruments of increasing size into the cervix. A set of dilators, metallic curved instruments, are used to open the cervix sufficiently to accommodate the instruments of abortion. In contrast with a normal birth, where the dilation occurs slowly over a period of many hours, the forceful stretching by the abortionist to open the cervix takes a matter of seconds. This premature and unnatural stretching of the cervix can result in permanent physical injury to the mother.<br>  <br>  Laminaria (dehydrated material, usually seaweed) is sometimes used to reduce damage to the cervix. Inserted into the cervix the day before the scheduled abortion, it absorbs water and swells, gradually pushing open the cervix in the process.<br>  <br>  At Eight Weeks<br>  At eight to nine weeks the eyelids have begun forming and hair appears. By the ninth and tenth weeks the preborn child sucks her thumb, turns somersaults, jumps, can squint to close out light, frown, swallow, and move her tongue. <br>  <br>  At this early stage of development, suction abortions are performed using a smaller tube, requiring little dilation of the cervix. This is called "menstrual extraction." However, if all the fetal remains are not removed, infection results, requiring full dilation of the cervix and a scraping out of the womb.<br>  <br>  Suction Aspiration<br>  This is the most common method of abortion during the first 12 weeks of pregnancy. General or local anaesthesia is given to the mother and her cervix is quickly dilated. A suction curette (hollow tube with a knife-edged tip) is inserted into the womb. This instrument is then connected to a vacuum machine by a transparent tube. The vacuum suction, 29 times more powerful than a household vacuum cleaner, tears the fetus and placenta into small pieces which are sucked through the tube into a bottle and discarded.<br>  <br>  Dilation and Curettage (D&C)<br>  This method is similar to the suction method with the added insertion of a hook shaped knife (curette) which cuts the baby into pieces. The pieces are scraped out through the cervix and discarded [Note: This abortion method should not be confused with a therapeutic D&C done for reasons other than pregancy.]<br>  <br>  At Twelve Weeks<br>  By the end of the third month all arteries are present, including the coronary vessels of the heart. Blood is circulating through these vessels to all body parts.<br>  <br>  The heart beat ranges during this fetal period from 110 to 160 beats per minute. All blood cells are produced by the liver and spleen, a job soon taken over by the bone marrow. White blood cells, important for immunity, are formed in the lymph nodes and thymus.<br>  <br>  Vocal chords are complete, and the child can and does sometimes cry (silently). The brain is fully formed, and the child can feel pain. The fetus may even suck his thumb. The eyelids now cover the eyes, and will remain shut until the seventh month to protect the delicate optical nerve fibers. <br>  <br>  <br>  14 weeks: Muscles lenghten and become organized. The mother will soon start feeling the first flutters of the baby kicking and moving inside.<br>  <br>  15 weeks: The fetus has an adult's taste buds and may be able to savor the mother's meals. <br>  <br>  16 weeks: Five and a half inches tall and only six ounces in weight, eyebrows, eyelashes and fine hair appear. The child can grasp with his hands, kick, or even somersault.<br>  <br>  At Eighteen Weeks<br>  The fetus is now about 5 inches long. The child blinks, grasps, and moves her mouth. Hair grows on the head and body. <br>  <br>  20 weeks: The child can hear and recognize mother's voice. Though still small and fragile, the baby is growing rapidly and could possibly survive if born at this stage. Fingernails and fingerprints appear. Sex organs are visible. Using an ultrasound device, the doctor can tell if the child is a girl or a boy. The one on the left is a baby girl.<br>  <br>  Dilation and Evacuation (D&E)<br>  This method is used up to 18 weeks' gestation. Instead of the loop-shaped knife used in D&C abortions, a pair of forceps is inserted into the womb to grasp part of the fetus. The teeth of the forceps twist and tear the bones of the unborn child. This process is repeated until the fetus is totally dismember|`|aCDWwsisaa	According to the Holy Bible, apparently God has no real major problem with abortion:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.skepticsannotatedbible.com/says_about/abortion.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.skepticsannotatedbible.com/sa...</a><br>  <br>  (unless you think the bible is wrong, of course)|`|c0KKHMsAaa	you can't prove morality.|`|de2AwHpHaa	there are no facts because it isn't wrong|`|macZI2dzaa	Every relevant field of science (from biology to genetics) agree that the human zygote, human embryo, human fetus is 100% human.  Pro-aborts wax eloquent in the fields of parapsychology and philosophy but science agrees that human life begins at conception.  At conception all the unborn human baby needs is what an adult needs, nourishment and a friendly environment.<br>  Abortion is wrong because it is murder.  It is murder of an innocent human being.  It is murder based on convenience 95% of the time.  Abortion is the American holocaust.  In the late 70s even Rev J Jackson agreed abortion was murder and murder specifically aimed at blacks.  We know that M Sanger was a racist and particularly placed her abortion clinics in poor black neighborhoods.  All the real evidence is on the side of those who believe in the "right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness."|`|AA10192697	a sperm and egg cell as living cells to begin with, carrying genetics/DNA.  When they meet and become one, a fertilized egg, they automatically begin to divide and continue to all the necessary cells are there to have a life form.  Each cell 'knows' what it's job it, a skin cell, a hair cell, a red blood cell, etc. Then cells join together to created organs of the human body. A retina, a thigh bone, a heart valve, etc. As these cells join to make an organ, that organ begins to work. The beginning of the heart is actually 2 veins that begin to pump before they fuse together to start forming into a whole heart. <br>  <br>  These body parts form and then just need nutrition to grow. A human baby's body has all of it's parts and organs by the time it's 18 weeks old. The 2 veins that pump before it's a heart, pumps at 5 weeks.  The beginning of the genitals look that same in both sexes until 9 weeks. It's the chromosomes that the sperm carried that makes the 'bump' into a clitoris or a penis.<br>  <br>  The whole process is amazing!!<br>  <br>  Now to answer your question, an abortion at any time destroys these cells, these organs, these body parts and makes this little living organism cease to live.  People can call it an embryo (the medical term for the first month) or a fetus (the medical term for the rest of the pregnancy) but it is a human lifeform. The fertlized egg will never become a whale, a fox, a dog or a tree or a beetle. It will become a human being.|`|RNKSq3iEaa	Huh.

Since He says that to everyone, it means He knew every baby that inhabits a womb since before the foundation of the world. There are millions of murdered babies in Heaven. The majority or their parents are hell-bound for murder (which is a sin worthy of death). There are also a goodly number of women, their mates and parents who have repented after an abortion when it became obvious what an incredibly horrific event it is - not only for the baby, but for everyone involved. These people will get to go to Heaven and care for their previously murdered babies.|`|ZcVkqwkcaa	Personally, it's really only wrong if you believe it's wrong. . . I've had conversations with my mother who is 100% against it, and I'm about 50% against if only for the fact I'm not going to tell another women what to do with her body because I don't want her to tell me what to do with mine. But anyway, the point is, I could talk to my mother four days on end about all the reasons why it shouldn't be 100% no abortions, but she still will never believe me.  <br>  <br>  Why is it wrong? it's wrong because IF you get it done there is a HIGH chance that they will scrape at your uterus wall and cause your body not to be able to have children again, and IF it doesn't cause that it increases the chance that later on when you do want kids the chances of mischarages/complactions increase.  That's one reason you can look into more from that stand point.  <br>  <br>  But I don't think anyone can prove it's 100% wrong in every case that it happens/happened.|`|I40HPsK2aa	Exodus 21:22,23 says: “And in case men should struggle with each other and they really hurt a pregnant woman and her children do come out but no fatal accident occurs, he is to have damages imposed upon him without fail according to what the owner of the woman may lay upon him; and he must give it through the justices. 23  But if a fatal accident should occur, then you must give soul for soul," <br>  <br>  According to this scripture, an unborn baby is still considered a valuable life. Clearly, it states that if a mother looses her baby because of somebody else, they should loose their life too. "soul for soul" Is it any different if the mother is the one that causes the lost of her child? why would it be? She is still causing death to this "soul" so its the same thing. God doesn't approve abortions in any way.<br>  <br>  Psalm 139:14-16 says "I shall laud you because in a fear-inspiring way I am wonderfully made.<br>  Your works are wonderful,<br>  As my soul is very well aware.<br>  <br>  15 My bones were not hidden from you<br>  When I was made in secret,<br>  When I was woven in the lowest parts of the earth.<br>  <br>  16 Your eyes saw even the embryo of me,<br>  And in your book all its parts were down in writing,<br>  As regards the days when they were formed<br>  And there was not yet one among them. "<br>  <br>  Here you can see how precious the life of an embryo is for God. So stating that it is acceptable to get an abortion because the "baby" is not fully formed or not a life doesn't go with what the bible states.|`|ioNKVW9haa	I just want to make a remark... I think it's HILARIOUS that the person posing the question asked for FACTS on ABORTION to prove it's wrong.<br>  <br>  And everyone started spouting religious rhetoric.<br>  <br>  Unfortunately, guys, religious beliefs are NOT considered fact... They're considered FAITH.  And true, your faith may be your personal truth, but it remains that religious beliefs are not considered fact.<br>  <br>  This sounds like a school project.

You have no say over whether a woman gives childbirth or not, regardless of what your fairy tale and imaginary friend say.|`|gAl41HtGaa	It is very difficult to try to “prove” right or wrong with facts because right or wrong is ones perception of a particular event or events judged against ones moral beliefs.  If like me you follow the Lord then we hold the word of God to the ultimate truth and abortion or any form of the termination of life with the exception of ridding society of evil is wrong. Now a high point in the debate against abortion has is that Jane Roe (Norma McCorvey) now an abortion opponent, was once the face of the abortion-rights movement and the woman who was known as "Jane Roe" in Roe v. Wade, the 1973 U.S. Supreme Court case that legalized abortion.

If god didnt beleive a single human was capable of bearing a child or caring for it he wouldnt allow them to become pregnant. Besides, if you are going to have an abortion, then you shouldnt be having sex in the first place. The only time abortion would be right is if the doctor said it was a life and death situation for the mother.|`|wG825TwBaa	there is no thing as proof.   there will always be those who interpret religion differently sooo her you go.<br>  <br>  The only problem I have with people saying life begins at conception is that, at conception, it is a single celled zygote consisting of human DNA. I dont understand how someone can say this single cell can be human but an ape is not related to us. After all, spit, a hair, piece of skin, etc are full of cells which contain your DNA but that does not make them human. The human fetus can not be removed from the womb until at least the 27th week and survive. Even then you would need a crackpot medical team and it still might die. The real question about abortion(for christians) is when does god place the soul into the human, if such a thing exists?  even then, one can argue "who says that its the christian form of soul and not anothers". If souls do not exist than removing a human fetus, before its capable of life on its own, is comparable to removing a tumor. Neither could survive outside the body and both contain human DNA. If souls do exist, than is it the christian idea, where its a "one time shot" at knowing god, which in this case all abortion would be bad. Or is it the soul of Buddhists where many chances are given, which is comparable to a job interview. Its just a failed chance. The real question is not when does HUMAN life begin, this is certainly not at conception biologically, but do people in fact have souls. All I can say on that is good luck on finding your soul, religion.|`|VSDaQ9QOaa	Sure, no problem:<br>  <br>  1. ABORTION PRIOR TO 16 WEEKS:  Many times Planned Parenthood will tell a girl that what she has inside of her is nothing more than a little unrecognizable blob of tissue and blood.  The truth<br>  is that the baby is about dime-size, but has all etremities including fingers and toes, blood vessels, eye sockets, and major organs growing.   A little blob of "nothing" is just that; however, a child, even<br>  if he/she is only the size of a dime, IS A BABY.<br>  <br>  2. ABORTIONS BEING PERFORMED LATE-TERM (in many States<br>     these abortions are being done on babies as late as 8 MONTHS):<br>     The baby, who has now been playfully tumbling and poking inside of <br>     mommy's womb for several months now, suddenly is showered with<br>     a chemical that literally burns it to death.<br>  <br>  3. BABIES WHO SURVIVE THE CHEMICAL BURN ABORTION ATTEMPT:   These are not the lucky ones; the "lucky" ones are the ones who died quickly and only had to endure 5 minutes of unimaginable pain and terror.  No, these children who survive that burn<br>  find a hand coming up into the womb and when that abortionists hand finds an arm or a foot, they are violently pulled  out of the womb and of course desperately  need  medical care, (ie; burning eyes flushed out, nostril tissue melting away as it burns,etc).<br>  BUT THEY DON'T GET ANY CARE BECAUSE BARACK OBAMA SAYS THAT "a woman who goes to have the result of a dead baby,<br>  deserve the result of a dead baby".  No care, no help, no mercy.<br>  The baby, now out and apart from the woman's womb, can have two<br>  outcomes, depending on how busy the abortionist is:<br>  <br>  Outcome number 1:  The abortionist who has the time to spare, will<br>  make short work of the baby who has the audacity to live through the<br>  chemical abortion:  This baby is turned over onto its stomach and a<br>  sharp medical instrument is plunged into the base of the skull; then you hear a loud machine turn on, and the baby's brains are sucked<br>  through a large tube.  Baby dead, woman happy to now be assured by<br>  President Obama himself, that she will continue to have enough money to get her nails and hair done each week rather than to have<br>  to buy diapers.  These babies are what our President calls "mistakes"<br>  and "burdens" , punishment for the woman who failed to "dance all night".  Ah, poor, poor victim (never mind the dead baby).<br>  <br>  Outcome number 2:  The abortionist who is just busy-busy that day,<br>  and cannot take the time to extract the full-term newly born babies<br>  brains out, instead will have an assistant wrap the baby in tissue<br>  and put it on a medical table in the supply closet where it can cry<br>  for the remaining minutes -or hours - until it stops breathing, stops<br>  crying.  The closet is certainly the best place for the child, since no<br>  medical care is given, no comfort is given, and the crying of a baby can<br>  be EVER SO ANNOYING, ya know?  When the baby dies, he or she<br>  is simply thrown into the trash.  No muss, no fuss.<br>  <br>  FULL-TERM, viable babies are being mass-murdered in America; and<br>  many of these babies have already been separated from the womans<br>  womb when they are savagely murdered - these are now citizens<br>  of the United States of America, and now living separate from the<br>  woman who refuses them.  Still, Obama feels that if you order your<br>  child dead, you should get your child dead.  Otherwise, what a terrible<br>  burden on that poor, poor woman.  Poor dear.  My, liberals sure have<br>  a way of turning the most despicable of people into victims these days.<br>  <br>  The actions by abortion mills and abortionists can be sanitized by<br>  calling it "reproductive rights"  or "womens rights" or "the right to choose", but I assure you that if the baby is a female child, that child<br>  will NEVER GET THE RIGHT TO DECIDE THEIR REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH, NEVER LIVE TO UNDERSTAND WHAT "RIGHTS" THEY HAVE AS WOMEN, AND CERTAINLY NEVER GET THE RIGHT TO<br>  CHOOSE ANYTHING, CERTAINLY NOT TO CHOOSE TO LIVE.<br>  <br>  Abortion is murder, no matter how rosey a term for whats being done<br>  that you want to use to describe it, it is still murder.  And now, with<br>  the number one most abortion-loving, abortion-promoting President in<br>  all the Worlds history in power,  ABORTION WILL NOW BE PERFORMED IN EVERY STATE BY FEDERAL MANDATE, RIGHT UP TO THE MINUTE LABOR BEGINS.  That means the tiny blob that<br>  they used to say you were getting rid of, is now a baby who if only<br>  had a more responsible and humane woman carrying it, they would<br>  be coming out of that womb and cuddled in a soft little blanket and<br>  given a name and lots of hugs.  <br>  <br>  WHAT THE HELL HAVE WE BECOME?|`|lJ2baVliaa	Jeremiah 1:5 (NIV) - "Before I formed you in the womb I knew you, before you were born I set you apart; I appointed you as a prophet to the nations."<br>  <br>  Psalm 139:13-14 (NIV) - "For you created my inmost being; you knit me together in my mother's womb.

It's pretty simple to understand, I think.|`|MoONItFMaa	im not exactly sure what you are asking but since the beginning of time humans have used religion to refer to things they don't understand, some of the first humans worshiped trees and animals because at the time humans were less developed and unaccustomed  to the Natural world and until they were able to discover fire and develop tools they would pray and worship nature as a means of controlling the uncountable , they personified nature to be at the same level of worship ping a leader or king e.i. bringing gifts or sacrifices, bowing,and things like that , but basically what im trying to say is that its a part of human nature to want to understand and control what they can not so to get as close as they can they started to worship things that we no longer find holy we no longer worship trees or animals because we as humans have learned what they are and are able to understand them , same thing with the greek gods they were useful for that time period but not anymore in the society we live in , im sure in the future there will be many different religions that we do not have today|`|gEC3BhMyaa	Perhaps they are all different interpretations of the same thing.

RNKSq3iEaa	Fundies are all pretty similar, but there are little differences. As a former evangelical fundie, I think Jesus Camp does a great job at exposing the major beliefs and attitude of such people. <br>  <br>  The speaking in tongues, the creepily devout little kids taught to approach strangers and tell them they heard voices from God, the odd beliefs (Harry Potter should be condemned to death, as Becky Fischer proudly yells at a roomful of little kids), and the politically-driven agenda - that's pretty much the church I grew up in. Only mine had a bit of a White Nationalist vibe, and instead of abortion, they were focused on getting rid of gays in America. My parents, as well as many other church members are also Holocaust-deniers. How that fits into a Christian church, I don't know. I got the hell out of there and never looked back.<br>  <br>  The little girl (Rachel?) actually reminds me of me as a kid. Perky and happy and totally convinced that I was supposed to tell strangers that they should come join my church. Got punched in the face for that one on the playground, actually. I was also into politics, except I had no frickin' idea what I was actually talking about. I didn't know what abortion was. I didn't know what homosexuality meant (I pictured greasy, demonic, grinning men hiding in the shadows of alleys whenever my mum talked about homosexuals), and yet I proudly ran around yelling about how gross and stupid they were. My parents were so proud. Ugh.<br>  <br>  Horrible subject matter, but a wonderfully-done documentary.|`|vDcDnO7Yaa	Yes, I don't see anything wrong with it.<br>  <br>  It's no different then the Public School exposing the fringe of Evolution (Anti-Christ beliefs) on children. <br>  <br>  Either way.. it's a way to bring up your child. Each parent has his/her own right to teach their child what they please.|`|PvgZUzHjaa	Honey, evangelicalism IS a fringe.  It exposes one aspect of it, and that is the intense training of children to believe that they must go along with the program or burn in hell for eternity.|`|S4XUl7qWaa	Most of it, IME. <br>  <br>  I used to not be able to get people to believe what hell I experienced as a kid, until that movie came out. Now they can better understand.|`|IegEMU3Waa	I think it used to be a fringe, but is growing to be more the norm.  A very scary thought, if you ask me!|`|PRAd6MWwaa	hopefully just a fringe..if its all than i'll honestly be a little scared..
OZjlW5utaa	Wow thats rude man!<br>  <br>  Watch movies with Kissing in, but interesting ones lol, trust me, its the best way to learn. Then when you go in, remember that. But also as your about to kiss, kiss gently, then sort of suck her lips and gently kiss over her lips, then if you both wanna do tongues, then go on.<br>  <br>  Good Luck.|`|avfdeyxNaa	Wanna practice with me? (;<br>  <br>  *KIDDING*<br>  <br>  Anyways, that was pretty rude of her. You shouldn't judge someone on their kissing skills. Besides, another person may think you kiss wonderfully. She's acting like the 5 year old for judging you on such a silly thing...<br>  <br>  Practice makes perfect though, so.....keep at it (:|`|WoAAdxHEaa	cuz you suck at kissing. girls dont like when you go fish-lipped on them. but the best practice is to ask how she wants to be kissed...|`|bmWUqNJaaa	jeez you were that bad?<br>  dam you need to practice|`|Poif4h01aa	That is awful! Don't let her rattle your confidence, her rude reaction is more of a reflection of her than you.

Don't be too overeager and slobbery...<br>  Contrary to what seems to be common belief, we don't necessarily like having tongues shoved down our throats.<br>  Just start slowly and gently, sucking lightly on the lips and then moving GENTLY on with tongues when you both want to.|`|34c2a39509c3bdd737d232c8b0aba78baa	practice with a friend

lJHPiAa5aa	yes 3 black kids went missing last week one of them found dead and the only black kid in the past month who got some attention and only temporary was jennifer Hudson's nephew and that's only because she's famous.|`|q3KCDrMAaa	Jamal is funny!! LOL<br>  <br>  Yes, I do, to an extent believe that missing black kids are kind of forgotten. If Chandra was black, that case would be closed. Yet, here we are eight years later and they are hard at work.<br>  <br>  I don't believe being treated equally is going to happen, because humans are just predisposed to being judgmental about SOMETHING. So you are going to always have someone, somewhere (last person on earth or not) who will have a 'problem' with someone being poor, rich, dark, light, having a disability...etc.|`|TsmqhvZHaa	most definitely! There is not a group in America more maligned than blacks.|`|8RmazUuBaa	Absolutly not....|`|OOP6Hesyaa	Yes, but that is quickly changing. It is no secret that if a little blonde white girl is kidnapped, you'll have Nancy Grace and all the cable news stations going gaga over her, but you never hear about minorities. <br>  <br>  HOWEVER, with the population and power of minorities in the US and Europe growing, as well as the white population dwindling worldwide, there is a growing sentiment all around the world, even in the US, that white people's days are numbered. The amount of racism against whites is growing every year, and the bad part is it is acceptable. I wouldn't be surprised if we saw a genocide against whites perpetrated by non-whites, in our lifetimes.|`|VE33luKcaa	Equality will be a forever battle in the country, left alone, the world. Historically and by personal experience, blacks are treated with less respect than whites depending on where one lives and how they carry themselves. From experience, I can say that my worst foes have been other blacks (especially the upper class and educated) more so than people of other races. But, it's not all about race either as it is about class and "who you know" as well that can get you places where others can't. <br>  <br>  Even though we have a black man or bi-racial man in office, doesn't mean we're done -- we still have a long way to go.|`|0hsh000waa	Not to me.|`|tkwwFnESaa	why does it matter too you? you ain't black.|`|ncdTxID9aa	Honestly, yes and no.  I'll explain, every black murder that is exploited, that person was either famous, or their family wasn't middle class.  Same thing with White families(keep in mind Whites make up the majority).  I live in Seattle, and from recent deaths, most of the families who go public with their stories are White, and the reason others may not is because they don't want ridicule from outsiders.  I'll use a 1998 case from here in Seattle.  A Hispanic couple was murdered by a Samoan gang called Mad Pack.  The criticism was that they probably were affiliated with this gang, and the reason they were murdered was because they had drugs.  Anything falsely pin pointed at a victim, could you imagine how upsetting that is?  Also, it's not wise to make it the public's business to know what relationship the victim may have had with their killer, because again people judge by what little they hear or want to hear. There were plenty of black murder cases solved, and many times a missing child or black women is either found or reported as a run away but they turned up.   I think liberal; media likes to play race into anything.  One more thing, cases that take years, forensic experts are on the case more so than anyone, because some crimes are hard to solve especially if witnesses or potential sources don't come forth to give some sort of leeway.|`|GHd84xipaa	this is a loaded question.i think i depends on where you are in the USA.there are still some racist in certain parts of this country,because they were bought up that way.there are a lot of uneducated people out there who are really stupid when it comes to justice too.the main thing is hope you get an honest judge and jury and that doesn't matter what your skin color is.
aHlpWFVhaa	Yes. Very much so and it's sad.|`|AA10843092	English history is far from being matriarchal inclined.  In fact their upper class system only allows males to inherit through other male bonds.  The only person that can inherit regardless is the person dubbed Queen or King.  Most of Europe is male orientated too, so America is not the only sexist society out there and will never be. Sadly, racism and sexism is strong throughout most of the world.|`|3e3e62517150959968d9185882de85ebaa	I haven't really thought about it, but I guess your right. I don't think it really has to do with being sexist. Just different cultures. But not everyone in America is Patriarchal. I have a half mexican half white boyfriend. And I call him my little coconut.|`|7Ohs5ABCaa	As far as determining heritage in the US we usually use both bloodlines.  Maybe you are just in a community with an odd variance?|`|YA36FUf1aa	Generally speaking, I think America is patriarchal but so is the UK and so are all other western societies.<br>  <br>  For example, how many female presidents has the USA had? If any proof is needed that the United States remains a sexist country, then surely the fact that no woman has ever been its president speaks for itself.<br>  <br>  I do think the racial issue is more down to the American obsession with classifying people racially (having a president of African descent sadly isn't going to erase hundreds of years of racism overnight) than anything. Maybe a better example of Patriarchy in family names is how in traditional Iceland names, both male and female children inherit their father's first name (followed by 'son' or 'dottir') as their second name yet inheritance of the mother's name is rare if not unheard of. And that is in one of the most liberal and forward thinking countries in the world! I was reading an item in The Guardian today which suggested Iceland is a kind of Feminist haven but patriarchy even influences people's lives there.|`|jiMAtaCraa	It's funny that people don't consider "Matriarchy" sexist, but are quick to jump on the Radical Feminist bandwagon and call "Patriarchy" sexist. How are they different? Both follow the superiority of one gender of another. <br>  <br>  The perception of one's race has little to do with gender. It adheres more so to the "One Drop Rule" as well as what race the individual looks like. There is no gender in this matter; it's placing an issue into a problem which needs none.
UR4mWefGaa	Like Einstein suffered for years to wait for good photographic evidence from a telescope located to take photographs at a solar eclipse. His theory of special relativity is confirmed with more modern techniques. <br>  <br>  I was a christian who poured through the scriptures myself. learned to read in the original languages. Was not guided by my teachers. The more I read, the more I was convinced that religion does not line up to what I perceive as reality. <br>  <br>  I have adjusted accordingly.|`|8ubAwaGCaa	No, but I have found plenty wrong with human beings, both religious and irreligious.  No church is responsible for the assumptions its believers make, as long as it either actively tries to suppress heresies or provides revelation to settle these matters when necessary.<br>  <br>  Since I don't for a minute pretend that the Bible is perfect and flawless, I do not feel any need to defend it as such.<br>  <br>  I curse myself, because I don't know any better than to sometimes correct a fallacy when other people are present.  I don't really want to embarrass the person who promotes the fallacy, but I don't want the congregation to leave with the impression that they have heard doctrine when it isn't doctrine.  I have never disrupted a worship service, but in seminars or Sunday School I sometimes do point out inconsistencies or errors.|`|AA10105819	<= theist, former Christian<br>  <br>  When I was a Catholic, I disagreed with banning birth control. I did (still do) believe in premarital chastity, but for folks who are married, they should have the right to use birth control, especially if they're too poor to have a(nother) child. I was also on the fence about the Religious having to take a vow of celibacy. True, if they were married they wouldn't be able to dedicate 100% of their lives to doing God's work. However, if they were married, they would have an outlet for the sex instinct, which I imagine would greatly reduce some of the freaky stuff that goes on behind closed doors.<br>  <br>  Now, as a Baha'i, there is absolutely nothing about my religion that I disagree with.|`|IkeCzc4Yaa	when I found something I do not understand, all I did was ask the internet and God to know what it means, and usually within a week I find out my answer.|`|LLey4VRzaa	Yes I have found something I am going to have to talk to God about. God told me not to commit Adultery and sexual fornication but yet God cheated with Mary on Joesph? What ever Gods reason, The people wanted to stone Her to Death for Her Sin! Why couldn't God pick a Women who was not betrothed to someone? Why did He choose to come into someone else's woman?<br>  <br>  I guess people Preach the most against something they are guilty of Themselves?|`|gt6Qp9Asaa	Of course.<br>  But I have also educated myself in other religions and found Christianity to be the best path for me.<br>  <br>  :)|`|38852752ccd0ae855afeb5b23f504950aa	No|`|75dd16605038ea62b51122d325c0595faa	I will watch the answers.|`|AA11329970	I was raised a christian and I know exactly what your talking about. Remember dude, the bible goes on and on about dusty laws and outdated views but the absolute bases of that faith is compassion. I dropped the faith as soon as I was old enough to understand religion. Christianity is based on compassion and humility, just like every other world religion. However, like every view / lifestyle there is zealots who encompass everything their religion condemns in an attempt to "convert". The bible is full of holes and contradictions but christianity in it's simplicity isn't, just like every other religion. I follow a different spiritual path, which I won't reveal because it's irrelevant but remember, most people with a faith use it to help them in their day to day lives and rarely speak about it or force it on others, that goes for all religions not just christianity. Consider directing your questions to the men and women screaming their opinions and faiths into microphones in the city centre, as most good folks on the internet and community really don't want to have to defend their religion as they;re still learning themselves. Talk to local religious leaders for more information.|`|SoPtNSeiaa	No not at all <br>  No weird dress codes or anything <br>  Good people no like weirdos<br>  I'm christen and it's perfect!! :)|`|iu2hnHp7aa	No, the parts with Unicorns and talking snakes are totally realistic.|`|Pk6dfEtXaa	I have found nothing wrong in my Lord. But I have found wrong in me and the rest of the sinful world.|`|mlAW436Daa	Kind of a tough question. I'm Catholic and was raised Catholic and we're taught that the Bible isn't meant to be taken word for word like fundamentalist believe. So there are a lot of things that I don't think happened the way the Bible says it did. <br>  <br>  This gets murky with what I KNOW to be so. I'm pretty sure the planets and starts aren't just painted on the sky the way Genesis reports. The story of Job I believe to be a morality story than actual events. I believe Samson was real but after reading the story I don't know if the events depicted is really how things occurred.<br>  <br>  Probably the biggest concept in the Bible I'm not so sure about is the traitorous nature of Judas. Ever since I was a kid I always had problems with the way Judas was portrayed. It never made sense to be that Judas was sitting around thinking "Man I need some extra bucks. I know! I'll betray Jesus." I believe that he either turned Jesus over hoping to start a battle between the Jews and Romans with Jesus leading the charge or that Jesus assigned him the task of betraying Him. From Judas' perspective here's the Messiah who has raised people from the dead, walked on water, healed the sick. In no way shape or form would I think that the Romans could take Jesus down. <br>  <br>  Of course the Bible is full of miraculous events and the whole notion of faith is believing in things that you don't know to be true.|`|0yTM98Odaa	I have found numerous things wrong with Christianity, hence why I am not Christian!|`|UinOWcMUaa	No-- my relationship with God is PERFECT.. but occasionally you get people who call themselves Christians who aren't Christians and ruin it for majority of other good Christians who are sincere and devoted...<br>  <br>  I guess that is why God tells us that His spirit doesn't dwell in Temples made with mans hands...

AA11877240	I have no idea what you are trying to say.<br>  <br>  Jannah is an unimaginable paradise.. thats all.<br>  there are hints scattered throught the qur'an and hadiths, but in general it's unimaginable|`|8928369727a00e94f6726cdbfe2d8dd0aa	Its a beautiful garden, everything one longs for in this world, will be there in Paradise. There are many levels of Paradise, the better you are the higher paradise you'll reside in (the highest one is called firdaws).<br>  <br>  Paradise is described as surrounded by eight principal gates, each level generally being divided into a hundred degrees. The highest level is known as firdaws (sometimes called Eden). It will be entered first by Muhammad, then those who lived in poverty, and then the most pious. Entrants will be greeted by angels with salutations of peace or As-Salamu Alaykum.<br>  <br>  And angels shall enter unto them from every gate (saying) Salaamun ‘Aleykum (peace be upon you) for you persevered in patience! Excellent indeed is the final home!’— (Ar-Ra'ad 13:23-24) <br>  <br>  <br>  Yes, absolutely it is impossible to make this life look similar to it because everything you ask for in Heaven will be brought before you no matter what it is. The reason why the say this life is nothing is because its known that this life isn't permanent, but the next one will be, so you have to work hard and be good in order to go to heaven if you don't then you'll forever abide in hell.<br>  <br>  p.s. The Taj Mahal by Shah Jahan was made to look like Heaven on earth, they went by the descriptions in the Quran. If you want you can get a copy of the Quran and look in the index for Jannah which is arabic for heaven.|`|LVMpbm6aaa	It i is called the garden because it probably resembles one.We can try to make our lives and world beautiful but it is probably a poor copy of the reality of Paradise.<br>  <br>  This life is fleeting and our focus is supposed to be on the next life.It is the driving force behind our thoughts words and actions.So no,I dont think this life is nothing.It is our only opportunity to pass the test.<br>  <br>  When Muslims say this life is nothing it means that it is so short,and so inconsequential in the grand scheme that it the hardships are nothing compared to the next,and the pleasure nothing compared to the next.<br>  <br>  It is a different perspective.|`|Z7V12zaKaa	Yes, it’s impossible to live a life like the one in paradise.  <br>  <br>  Paradise cannot be described. The last person who enters it will have ten times what any king have in this world and more, what he and his eyes desire and more.<br>  Just imagine that…<br>  <br>  In Quran, Allah says “No person knows what is kept hidden for them of joy as a reward for what they used to do.” (32,17)<br>   <br>  Also, in Quran, Allah says ‘’ 8. (Other) faces that Day will be joyful, 9. Glad with their endeavour (for their good deeds which they did in this world, along with the true Faith of Islamic Monotheism).[3] 10. In a lofty Paradise.  11. Where they shall neither hear harmful speech nor falsehood. 12. Therein will be a running spring. 13. Therein will be thrones raised high. 14. And cups set at hand. 15. And cushions set in rows. 16. And rich carpets (all) spread out.” (88,8-16 ).<br>  <br>  Also ‘’ The description of Paradise which the Muttaq?n have been promised (is that) in it are rivers of water the taste and smell of which are not changed, rivers of milk of which the taste never changes, rivers of wine delicious to those who drink, and rivers of clarified honey (clear and pure) therein for them is every kind of fruit, and forgiveness from their Lord. (Are these) like those who shall dwell for ever in the Fire and be given to drink boiling water so that it cuts up their bowels?” (47,15)<br>  <br>  Hopefully you have a clear image now..|`|0wjqN8qpaa	i think there are lots of virgins there

QnH9QuQwaa	Good question.  Why would anyone invent him?  His words go against so many Christians and Jews.  Why not have a Messiah who agrees with these people?<br>  <br>  During the Crusades actually the Christians were angry at Muslims for random attacks on Christian settlers.  The Catholic church pushed a belief that Christians should have the holy land and fake stories (like the holy grail) became commonplace.  Then greed set in and so did arrogance.  The Crusaders ended up doing worse to the Muslims and Jews (the Jews did nothing wrong in the first place) then anything the Muslims had previously done.  Worse yet, the Crusaders killed civilian Muslims who had nothing to do with the violence.<br>  <br>  Jesus's words did not appease 1.  the rich  2.  anyone supporting Babylon 3.  the Jews who didn't believe he was the Messiah and who focused mainly on the physical laws 4.  those who felt they were already righteous.|`|89MKzLl3aa	The Jews accept Jesus as a prophet, not the Messiah and the Muslims do as well. So, tell me how billions of people believe that Jesus was a real man and for it to be false?<br>  <br>  Edit:lol- I can understand if people aren't Christian and dislike Jesus, but to deny written history and to deny that the Quran speaks of Jesus as the prophet is just asinine.

Also, they were persecuted (fed to the lions!) by the Romans and so it was convenient to refocus that hostility on another minority, the Jews.

s2TJ6H1raa	In our modern era we are living in concrete cities which are becoming increasingly more populated and unhealthy places to live.  People seem to think that food shopping must be done in a super-market.  People continue to clutch onto money in industry, banks and every part of society.  A lot of food from super-markets is imported which is increasing CO2 emissions, most of which could be grown closer to home.  It is the thinkers behind the system who are to blame for greed and environmental exploitation.  There are trusts such as the national trust, which are dedicated to humans working in harmony with nature but more must be done to change food industry practices and ethics.  Flats and tower blocks are unsightly and don't have gardens, they are another example of unethical practice.  The people living in them have little space and they resemble cages plied on top of each other in the sense that there is little room and they are all packed together.|`|KVBTtF9faa	Every time I hear a woman say she NEEDS a hospital, doctor and drugs to give birth and that she needs formula and bottles to feed her baby I am disgusted by just how much the human race has lost touch with nature and that which is the most natural things for us to do.

Those who can not see that they are animals much like the rest cannot connect. If you can not see that you are from this world and are going to return to this world it is easy to not care what happens to this world. <br>  Commercialism also plays a part in this disconnection.

I have had to reign myself in a time or two, in the forum, and remind myself to play nice. Not just in the forum, but at work too- to keep my mouth shut about venus and no name calling. Still waters run deep and I am human. It is human nature to want to announce our ill feelings- or thoughts- about someone that slighted us. It is both easier and harder for me to deal with this- first because I know that the few people in the cashiering department that ignore me and such is because venus told them I was in the mental hospital because I said that I was Mary Magdalene. I never even told her that, but she tricked Miguel into telling her and he told her cuz he thought that I might tell her anyways. Of course by that time, I had not spoken to her in some time, because she let charlie move back in with her. When I first found out who I was- 2 years ago, come April, I told venus and I asked her not to tell anyone, because I did not have any proof. She immediatly told her step mother, a boyfriend, a friend, and her boss at work. Her boss' son is really ill and venus told her that I said that I would heal him. I was mortified that she betrayed me and also I said no such thing. She has since told many people and even has texted my brother as recently as Christmas. It is hard on me, because I only know the truth because Duey told me why everyone was treating me differently. venus also betrayed me and told charlie- of course he ran right to work and told many of my co-workers before he died. So, she makes me mad, disrespects me and such and I try to be mature. I saw her the other day and I always just say hi, when I pass her to be couth and she had the gall to make me stop and ask if she could call me sometime. I just said no, I really do not care for that and walked away. I was so shocked, cuz I know that she is blabbing crap about me at work. Funny thing is, I am the only one that ever stood up for her at work- against some of the people that she turned against me. She was always the outsider and now they are bonded by her gossip of me. I was friends with all of these women- or at least on friendly terms ~ some for as many as 15 years. Now her boss, with the sick son, will not even look at me and makes it a point to avoid me- noticiably. Anyways, I guess it goes along with what Sylvia says- honor those that are honorable to you. The other thing that makes it easier to deal with is that I really was Mary M and all of those people will eat crow for trash talking me- and oh yeah- I caught two of them making a face at me after I turned around and then I looked back at them.

Cicero makes what sounds like amazing prognostications about how morally degraded people of the future would be.  I guess that makes the Roman State Religion true.

One can believe in the existence of other life in the universe and one can argue that since we have not been all over the universe, that we can not prove that such alien life forms don't exist (whoops double negative). There could very well be a god or even a race of beings who have attained an evolutionary level of being considered gods.

fjLluy2baa	people use to think the world was flat but we moved past that<br>  <br>   we will move past religion as well ,Christianity was designed for tent dwelling camel jockeys|`|AA11297267	My take is that christians who "believe" (which is the wrong word) in evolution have just pushed the same unfounded assumptions a little further back than the young-earth creationists...but they make the exact same mistake.<br>  Basically, in the face of uncontestable scientific fact, they've grudgingly accepted the fact of evolution because the logical part of their brains just couldn't reconcile all that fact with the bible's myths.  So they invented a whole new kind of christianity that says the bible isn't literal, it's just a guide to certain things.  So how do they decide which parts are just stories and which parts are "real?"  How do they know the jesus story isn't simply another mythical story meant to illustrate a point?  They don't -- they've given a little bit of ground because of overwhelming fact, but they can't commit themselves to the fully rational conclusion.<br>  <br>  They still posit that "god" had something to do with starting evolution or kicking off the big bang or that "he" fits in somewhere else along the way.  It's an assumption without any evidence to back it up, just like the assumptions young-earth creationists make.  And it's just as untenable a position.  The only difference is that they've pushed their "god" back to a gap that science hasn't fully filled yet...what will they do when science *does* fill that gap with proven facts, find another place to push their "god" back to?  They're running out of room...<br>  <br>  Making assumptions about supernatural involvement in any aspect has no evidence of any kind to back it up.  It's untenable whether you insert it at 6,000 years ago, 4.5 billion years ago, or 15 billion years ago.

The main thing is that a day in Universal or God's time could be 250 million years.<br>  <br>  3) In Genesis allegory and myth are used. The 12 tribes of Israel were semi nomadic people trying to irk out a living day by day and the were centuries away from biology, micro biology, genetics, quantum and, stellar mechanics, chemistry and physics. Things had to be explained in their terms. <br>  <br>  4) If God could make man from clay and a woman from a rib, he certainly also has the where with all to make us come out from lesser life forms over time. Perhaps when we got to the point in our evolution of being able to reflect upon ourselves then that particular being got his soul so to speak.<br>  <br>  Ultimately this whole fight and debate is a foolish waste of time. When I pass away, God will ask did you forgive your neighbour, keep my commandments, feed me when hungry, cloth me when naked. visit me in prison... he will NOT be asking if earth is 6400 or 4.5 billion years old, did we evolve from an ape creature, did Adam walk with dinosaurs etc.<br>  <br>  Cheers,<br>  <br>  Michael Kelly|`|oSMw5NFJaa	I am a Christian and believe that God created us and we evolved from there.

You believe that you are a descendant from an ape.  Your logical format for this is that they are the closest animal to our development.  You wonder why others of your type would deny this believe.  Others say that God created them in his image.  Can you logically explain why you have this debate?  Do apes sit around pondering on why they are as they are?<br>  <br>  The story of Adam and Eve reveals that they ate from the truth of knowledge.  It was then that they became aware of higher level thinking.  So you are a descendant from an ape, but have a higher level of thinking than any other being on the planet.  Do you ever wonder why you are able to form thoughts at higher levels?<br>  <br>  Let us say that you don't.  You don't need to.  You are what you are.  Why then do you ponder as to what others are believing as being so odd?  Your not very tolerant of your fellow man.  You must be the ape that picks fights.  Well, you could say that many Christians are not tolerant of my views.  You are right.  Just as in any group of people, the group deteriorates the overall.<br>  <br>  You believe that it takes either faith or logic.  You must have faith in your logic though.  If you have no faith that your mind thinks logically then you would never assume a position on anything, never form believe, and there for be ever searching.  Searching is a nice alternative to degrading others.  Science developed as a method of analization for the purposes of searching.  Odd that it is being used to distroy or degrate others that use other methods to seach.|`|7FPvEWb4aa	Seth,<br>  <br>  I believe in both Faith AND Logic...but that does not mean I believe in Evolution. Don't accidentally equate Logic with Evolution.<br>  <br>  ...but you do bring up a very good point.  Why Christians believe in Evolution is beyond me.  I guess they have just not been very grounded in their belief.  It is a very slippery slope they are on, however.  I would completely agree with you on that point.  God either made it just like He said He did else He did not.  He leaves no middle ground upon which to stand.  He didn't intend to leave any middle ground.<br>  <br>  As a Christian, I believe in micro-evolution....that is to say, small adaptations.  My eye balls make it clear this happens all around me.  But macro-evolution?...It would take less faith to believe in the Flying Spaghetti god so many people in R&S try to reference.<br>  <br>  You asked the question....when to people get souls?  For the record book it is found in:<br>  Gen 2:7 And Jehovah God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.<br>  <br>  You see, Creationist have a starting point.  However, Christians who believe "God used evolution" do not have a place to start just as you have pointed out.<br>  <br>  iamnotbut...I know I AM|`|Un3YxFvRaa	It seems that the word "evolution" is so incendiary, it causes an immediate intake of breath... from everyone...<br>  <br>  However, as a Christian, I believe in both.  And also think that your definition of evolution is very limited and only says a small part of what the word means.  What Christians believe is that God created man with an ability to commune with his Creator.   Can animals (apes or otherwise)  be aware that there is a God or there is not a God?  No.<br>  <br>  But evolution/adapting  goes on all the time.  Have you known someone who having lost their sight, gain 100% fold from their other senses?  How do you account for that?<br>  <br>  Even, earlier and more basic: those people who lived in sub-tropical climates have darker, thicker skin for protection against the rays.<br>    and there are thousands of other examples which people smarter than me recognize. <br>  <br>  We humans "adapt" aka "evolve" all the time....|`|gEC3BhMyaa	Firstly: DreamRider, shut up. You have no grounds to judge anyone else's religion. Each individual's connection with God is unique.We are not wrong just because our beliefs aren't exactly like yours in every way.<br>  <br>  Secondly: I personally believe that God was the catalyst of the creation of this universe and everything that followed was as He had layed out in His plan. We evolved according to God's plan. Much of the bible is metaphorical.

At this time, there was no official Jewish canon of scripture.<br>  <br>  The Jews in Egypt translated their choices of the Hebrew Scriptures into Greek in the second century before Christ. This translation of 46 books, called the Septuagint, had wide use in the Roman world because most Jews lived far from Palestine in Greek cities.

I did not receive it from any man, nor was I taught it; rather, I received it by revelation from Jesus Christ.<br>  <br>  2 Timothy 3:16 tells us that the Bible was "breathed out" by God.<br>  <br>  Galatians 1: 11-12 tells us that the gospel was a revelation from Jesus Christ himself, which was recorded by Jesus disciples and Paul.<br>  <br>  God himself chose the disciples and the people whom He knew were going to spread His word and write the Bible.<br>  <br>  The Bible was written by approximately 40 men of diverse backgrounds over the course of 4000 years. Despite being penned by different authors over 40 centuries, the Bible does not contradict itself and does not contain any errors. The authors all present different perspectives, but they all proclaim the same one true God, and the same one way of salvation—Jesus Christ (John 14:6; Acts 4:12).<br>  <br>  In John 8:58 "I tell you the truth," Jesus answered, "before Abraham was born, I am!"<br>  <br>  The above verse speaks a lot about who Jesus really is.<br>  <br>  All about Jesus and the Holy Trinity explained in the below website.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com</a><br>  <br>  Lots of videos, sermons, songs are also present, along with all of Jesus miracles, his parables, and questions on his birth, crucifixion, resurrection are answered.<br>  <br>  Many major questions on Christianity are answered with lot of examples that cannot be denied by anyone, such as,<br>  <br>  1) Did Jesus really exist? Is He God? Why did He suffer on the Cross?<br>  2) What is so special about Jesus? Why cant I just view him as an ordinary man or a teacher or a prophet?

The phrase "Call upon the name of the LORD" (Hebrew, YHWH, i.e., Psalm<br>  116:4) used only of God on the OT, and translated into the Greek in the LXX as "Call upon the name of the LORD (greek, KURIOS)," applied to Jesus in the NT (1 Cor. 1:2) Jesus is God in flesh<br>  5. The apostle John says that Jesus was , "...calling God His own Father,<br>  making Himself equal to God," (John 5:18)<br>  6. Jesus said that He and the Father are One (John 10:30), that caused the Pharisees to<br>  claim that Jesus was making Himself out to be God.<br>  7. Jesus knew all things (John 21:17)<br>  8.

In the OT God was seen (Exodus 6:2-3;Exodus 24:9-11; Num. 12:6-9; Acts7:2), yet no man can see God (Exodus 33:20; John 1:18). It was not the Father that was seen in the OT (John 6:46). Who, then were they seeing? See John 8:58.<br>  22. Jesus claimed the divine name, "I AM", for Himself in John 8:58 see<br>  Exodus 3:14.<br>  23.

It has three different usages in the Bible in reference to man: 1. Spiritual death--separation from God because of sin (Ep. 2:1; Jn. 5:24; Col. 2:13). 2. Physical death--separation of the spirit from the body (Mt. 2:15; Ge. 35:18; Jam. 2:26). 3. Eternal death or Second death--the final, eternal separation of the unsaved from God and life (Re. 20:14; 21:8; 2 Th. 1:9).<br>  <br>  DEATH IS A JOURNEY. Some false teachers say that death is a sleep, but according to the Bible, death is a journey. The body sleeps, but the spirit of man journeys either to Heaven or to Hell. The O.T. teaches that death is a journey (Ge. 25:8; 35:18; Nu. 27:13; 2 Sa. 12:23; 1 Ki. 17:21-22).<br>  <br>  The N.T. also teaches that death is a departure of the spirit from the body to another conscious realm of existence. (1) The body is distinct from the spirit. "I pray God your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless..." (1 Th. 5:23; see also Mk. 14:38; 1 Co. 6:20; 2 Co. 12:2). (2) It is the body which is said to die. "For as the body without the spirit is dead..." (Jam. 2:26). (3) Paul's testimony was that death is a journey. "Therefore we are always confident, knowing that, whilst we are at home in the body, we are absent from the Lord ... we are confident, I say, and willing rather to be absent from the body, and to be present with the Lord" (2 Co. 5:6-7; see also Ph. 1:23,24; 2 Ti. 4:6). (4) Peter testified that at death he would put off his body. "Knowing that shortly I must put off this my tabernacle, even as our Lord Jesus Christ hath shewed me" (2 Pe. 1:14). (5) Jesus' promise to the thief on the cross shows that death is a departure. "And Jesus said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, Today shalt thou be with me in paradise" (Lk. 23:43). (6) The story of Lazarus and the rich man shows that death is a departure. The proper names Jesus used in this story prove He was speaking of a real historical scene, rather than of a fictitious parable. Yet, even if it be allowed that this was a parable, it would still teach literal truth as did all of Christ's parables. "...the beggar died, and was carried by the angels into Abraham's bosom: the rich man also died, and was buried; and in hell he lift up his eyes, being in torments..." (Lk. 16:22-23). (7) The dead saints are said to return with Christ from heaven at the time of the resurrection and rapture of the saved. This shows that dead saints go to Heaven at death. "For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him" (1 Th. 4:14). (8) John's heavenly visions show dead saints in Heaven prior to the resurrection and during the Great Tribulation on earth (Re. 6:9-11). (9) Moses' and Elijah's appearance on the Mount of Transfiguration proves that the dead have conscious existence between death and resurrection. That Peter and the other Apostles who were present were not just seeing a future millennial scene is demonstrated by the fact that Moses and Elijah were speaking with the Lord Jesus about His approaching death. Moses and Elijah, though dead, were allowed by God to appear in time on that mountain and to converse about events which were soon to take place in Jerusalem (Mt. 17:1-3; Lk. 9:30-31).<br>  <br>  It is plain from this survey of N.T. Scripture that man has a spirit or soul which departs from his body at death and which lives eternally either in Heaven or in Hell.|`|KEtyfDwraa	I believe that we cease to exist, much like before we were born and that our bodies go from being on the top of the food chain to the bottom and help keep the cycle going.|`|SWfaNKSgaa	I'm not 100% positive, but my Roman Catholic belief tells me I will go to heaven, hell, or purgatory. <br>  <br>  Through NDE (near death experiences) most experts are confident that there is some sort of spiritual realm|`|RedEGIfZaa	You don't "go" anywhere.

It's also nice to think that we might have an opportunity to be reunited with those we've lost. But again, this is just wishful thinking.

This is achieved through the medium of prayer, scripture, devotional books, and sharing in communion with others, who are also aspiring to induce what they know to be Godly characteristics and qualities. It is an astute attentiveness to following our will under the guidance of the Holy Spirit to transform the inner self to project a reflection of Christ-like qualities. <br>  <br>  It is christ dwelling in the believer and leading them to more enlightened states that will elicit more desires to become the spirit of christ. Every believer interprets his or her teaching, experience and communication differently so it is personal, but because many others are doing the same, they are able to unify their spirits and speak from this same spirit consciousness where others can identify. <br>  It is accomplished through direct experience. <br>  <br>  I am not christian, but I was once, and am speaking from my own experience.

xq4TCQuAaa	I was at the mall with my best friend, when storm sirens came on.  We were running to find shelter and came out to a rock island in a sea of lava, and there was an old, ruined tower standing in front of us.  We for some reason figured that it was the best way to go, so we started climbing.  It was falling to pieces underneath our feet, and as we got closer to the top I wanted to just jump because the lightning seemed so close to my head.  We came out on a bridge (a specific one in my hometown that goes over the bay).  The bay had turned to lava and there were bone dragons swimming in it and snapping at us.  Then the bridge started crumbling around us.  We had nowhere to go, so he set me on a steel support beam and told me that it would be safe there.  Then the road fell out underneath him and one of the dragons dove to get him before he turned to ash.  He'd seemed a lot sicker, paler, and thinner in the dream, and I found out a few hours after I woke up that he'd died about when I had the dream.

At first i call them to run towards me as they are unaware of its presence behind them, they see it and run inside i begin to hear very unnerving scream of my family looking outside in terror and a very disturbing tune begins to play, i go get the phone begin dialing to the police  or something, and suddenly i wake up. it was very surreal i cant make any sense out that dream, left me with a very eerie ans creepy feeling that entire day. sorry if it was abit long i don't type this much usually.|`|e29d291d74030bb5aef86377b273cd5faa	Sometimes when I dream about something really bad, I wake up and Im in my dream.

It doesn't sound that frightening but for me ~ I find it terrifying.<br>  <br>  I'm always in my house (in the nightmare) I can be in bed, in the kitchen, in the living room anywhere and all of a sudden it will go dark. Then the evil appears - a form so terrifying, so bad, so without humanity and it lunges for me, and I try the same thing over and over, which is to switch a light on, and the same thing happens again and again ~ the light never comes on, and this evil gets closer and closer. A few times in the dream the light comes on but ever so dimly ~ as though it's a one watt bulb. The evil "thing" is draining all the light and energy from the house and keeps coming for me.<br>  <br>  The last time this happened I woke half screaming and half crying and when I reached over to switch the light on - it didn't come on.<br>  <br>  And believe me, I was out of that bed faster than greased weasel poo!|`|Y7O7MkLdaa	well my worst fear is bears so..<br>  <br>  i was in the living room at my friends cottage, and there was bunk beds randomly in the room and i was on the top.

My brother and I were hanging in front of the public bathrooms, with a friend of mine. Then something caught our attention. A black cat. It came from the shadows, and crept toward us. It looked normal, but slowly ever so slowly, it started getting bigger and bigger as it got closer to us. It's golden eyes, the orange, crackling fluroscent lights, and a chill went through me. "Hey, let's go into the bathrooms. I don't like this," I told my brother, He nodded, as scared as I was, and we rushed into the ladies bathroom. "There's nothing wrong guys," my friend shrugged at us while biting into his hamburger. I stayed in a stall, but peeked. I couldn't see what was happening, but I heard the worst scream in the world. It was filled with terror, and fear. I almost peed in my pants. Then blood splattered the wall. I shivered.<br>  <br>  "That's Evil out there," a black woman, using the bathroom, commented to me.

AA11232725	It could indicate a pause either for meditation or possibly a musical interlude. The meaning is uncertain.

The Psalms were sung accompanied by musical instruments and there are references to this in many chapters. Thirty-one of the thirty-nine psalms with the caption "To the choir-master" include "Selah" so the musical context of selah is obvious. Selah notes a break in the song and as such is similar in purpose to Amen in that it stresses the importance of the preceding passage. Alternatively, Selah may mean "forever", as it does in some places in the liturgy (notably the second to last blessing of the Amidah). Another interpretation claims that Selah comes from the primary Hebrew root word [calah] which means "to hang", and by implication to measure (weigh).[1] Also "Selah" is the name of a city from the time of David and Solomon.[2]<br>  <br>  It is translated into today's general language with the meaning: think about it or praise [the lord]. Other editions just leave it untranslated as "sela" or "selah"<br>  In Islam and in Arabic generally, Salah means prayer, and Selah means connection. Both words come from the same original root Sel which means connect.<br>  <br>  According to Tony Warren[3] there is an alternate interpretation: Selah, [celah], is from the primary Hebrew root word [calah] which means 'to hang,' and by implication to measure (weigh). This is readily understood because in Biblical history, money, food and other valuables were 'weighed' by hanging or suspending them on a type of balance (the equivalent of our measuring scale) to determine their value. We find an example of this word [calah] as it is literally translated 'valued,' in the book of Job, indicating that which is measured.<br>  Job 28:15-16<br>  "It cannot be gotten for gold, neither shall silver be weighed for the price thereof. It cannot be valued with the gold of Ophir, with the precious onyx, or the sapphire." <br>  The word translated valued is the exact same Hebrew word [calah], and it quite obviously means "measured against." In this context, God is telling us that wisdom "cannot be measured against the gold of Ophir, with the precious onyx, or the sapphire." Here the translation 'valued' is to illustrate the measuring of something for an exchange. i.e. wisdom cannot be measured with the gold of Ophir. It is beyond that value. In verse nineteen we see this very same illustration again.<br>  Job 28:19<br>  "The topaz of Ethiopia shall not equal it, neither shall it be valued with pure gold."|`|hVVALFAPaa	What Does Selah Mean<br>  -by Tony Warren<br>  <br>  What does the word Selah mean? There has been much conjecture and speculation by some theologians, and due in no small part to this speculation, Christians are frequently confused as to the true meaning of this word. Having been been told everything from, "the original Hebrew has been lost," to "Jewish scholars agree it means forever," it's easy to understand their confusion. In addition, many are assured that because this word appears only in the psalms and a poetic section of Habakkuk (which is not true), they are justified in "assuming" that it is just a musical term indicating an interlude. I have even read that Selah is from an Aramaic word, and it really means worship. All of which serves not to enlighten the Church, but to confuse the issue. <br>  <br>  With all of these "experts" making such contradictory statements, one tends to wonder, "can we even really know what Selah means?" The answer to this question I believe is yes. And the answer really shouldn't be subjective or left to conjecture, for there is much we can learn about this word from the Hebrew in which it is written, from allowing the scripture to be its own dictionary, and from comparing scripture with scripture and allowing God to be His own interpreter. All of these things can give us a solid illustration of this word's true meaning. <br>  <br>  Selah, [celah], is from the primary Hebrew root word [calah] which means 'to hang,' and by implication to measure (weigh). This is readily understood because in Biblical history, money, food and other valuables were 'weighed' by hanging or suspending them on a type of balance (the equivalent of our measuring scale) to determine their value. We find an example of this word [calah] as it is literally translated 'valued,' in the book of Job, indicating that which is measured. <br>  <br>  Job 28:15-16|`|3a9f326d01ff48571ab8b07403c16d21aa	Psalms are songs. Selah is not a pause but tells you to sing the next part louder. Psalms 66 is about singing praises with a joyful noise and every time you see selah you sing the next part louder.

2PZnXjZ7aa	Poseidon is actually in a lot of different Greek myths, his Roman name is Neptune and he was one of the original 6 gods sired by the titans Cronos and Rhea. In the birth of the gods myth he was swallowed whole as a baby by his father Cronos. Later on Poseidon and his 4 other siblings Hera, Hestia, Hades, and Demeter were freed by their youngest brother Zeus who later became the King of the Gods. Supposedly he is married to Demeter, but like the other gods he has been known to stray. Poseidon is the god of the oceans and carries a Trident. He's also involved in the birth of Aphrodite myth. He sent waves to guide her seashell to the shore. There's also the myth where he tries to win the city that is currently know as Athens away from Athena, he eventually loses though and instead becomes a patron to Troy, which sadly later on also becomes destroyed in The Iliad. A Greek hero that Poseidon was angry at would be in the Odyssey, Odysseus ended up blinding a cyclopes, one of Poseidon's sons, and for that Poseidon unleashes a storm that dooms Odysseus to sail endlessly. Although in an act of mercy, when the crew was thrown overboard they were turned into dolphins.<br>  PS Aphrodite was actually married to the smith of the Gods known as Hephaestus.|`|dfjIBHe3aa	Oh gosh, when Zeus overthrew Chronos and freed his brothers and sisters, his brothers were Poseidon and Hades.  And by the way, it's Poseidon not Posiden.  He and Athena competed for the affection and honor of the athenians.  He caused a spring to bubble up from the ground.  The water was briney and undrinkable.  She caused an olive tree to sprout.  In gratitude they named their city Athens.<br>  <br>  They were not friendly after that.  The beautiful Medusa was accosted and raped in Athena's temple by Poseidon.  For having anything to do with him  in her temple no less, Medusa made her hideous and cursed her that men would turn to stone when they saw her.  Her children by Poseidon were the winged horse Pegasus and the giant Chrysaor|`|PFJ7ZbVZaa	Check out this site too....There's quite a bit of info here on Poseidon.
QgE85Qynaa	As it has been mentioned this practice is common to many Asian and African societies- not merely the Arabs.<br>  <br>  Primarily it benefits the family (and you must understand that the Arab concept of family is what most Westerners would call a "tribe") in that it keeps the wealth within the family, rather than handing out the dowry or bridesprice to another family. In addition, the family has the ability to know the cousin before marriage, allowing them to determine whether or not he/she is an honorable person or would make a good match. Lastly, it helps keep the family line pure.|`|e7276387cff3a4d02088a066ab5617b3aa	This is true in many cultures, not just Arab or Middle Eastern ones. This is done in the different peoples and cultures all over sub-Saharan Africa and Asia. Many Eastern cultures have a stronger sense of communal unity - the family is the most paramount social structure.<br>  <br>  For example, parents and children living together even when they grow up is not only common, it is considered an honour.<br>  <br>  Hence, "preserving" those familial ties is honourable in many cultures.|`|YhjFiVGyaa	its not really for honor...its done either to keep the family money in the family, or if one or the other cannot find a match.<br>  <br>  i dont agree with this tho...i have an egyptian friend whose sisters and brothers married cousins and all theyre kids are either half blind or have heart problems.<br>  <br>  its gross.|`|T1beLIQqaa	It is common in all hierarchical societies, not just Arab(Semitic White)  culture-the peoples of Asian, African. and Indo European Aryans(i.e.-British, Germans, French).

BPO6roTOaa	It went World Wide.|`|M4WIWMgBaa	Instant access to the pornz.|`|jard50Yiaa	The World Wide Web (commonly abbreviated as "the Web") is a system of interlinked hypertext documents accessed via the Internet. With a Web browser, one can view Web pages that may contain text, images, videos, and other multimedia and navigate between them using hyperlinks. Using concepts from earlier hypertext systems, the World Wide Web was begun in 1992 by the English physicist Tim Berners-Lee, now the Director of the World Wide Web Consortium, and Robert Cailliau, a Belgian computer scientist, while both working at CERN in Geneva, Switzerland. In 1990, they proposed building a "web of nodes" storing "hypertext pages" viewed by "browsers" on a network, and released that web in 1992. Connected by the existing Internet, other websites were created, around the world, adding international standards for domain names & the HTML language. Since then, Berners-Lee has played an active role in guiding the development of Web standards (such as the markup languages in which Web pages are composed), and in recent years has advocated his vision of a Semantic Web. Cailliau went on early retirement in January 2005 and left CERN in January 2007.<br>  <br>  The World Wide Web enabled the spread of information over the Internet through an easy-to-use and flexible format. It thus played an important role in popularising use of the Internet, to the extent that the World Wide Web has become a synonym for Internet, with the two being conflated in popular use.|`|5eSJpYbMaa	Do your own homework.<br>  <br>  <br>  This is such an easy question, too, by the way.

vuAD59egaa	This is a very broad question. I would start by examining the Chiastic structure of each book  in the Old Testament. There is a central truth in each book of the Bible.  Types can also be reflected in the Ritualistic services in the Old Testament that met their fulfillment in Christ.  We also see the contest between Good and Evil beginning at Creation and culminating with the final destruction of Evil in Revelation 20.In Exodus we see God leading his people out of 400 years of Slavery. We also see the introduction of the Law given to Israel in trust for all mankind. This also includes the Sabbath, which has been largely forgotten and rejected by Christians. In Psalms we see the struggles of God's servant David. All this is reflected in his many Prayers, Hymns, and stuggles throughout the viccisitudes of his life. In David we see victory and defeat. In proverbs we catch a glimpse of the Wisdom of God. In Daniel we see the prophectic word on center stage which actually points us to the Coming of Christ as well as the End of the World.

czXaUPIlaa	There's no easy answer to your question - this is a very complex topic and much remains unknown. Scholars continue to discover ancient documents that shed new light on the early development of Buddhism, including the Buddhist sutras.<br>  <br>  Traditionally, scholars and Buddhists have viewed the Pali Canon as the earliest group of Buddhist sutras. This canon was created by a council of monks approximately 200-300 years after the Buddha's death and it claims to capture the actual words of the Buddha. As with any canon, it was selectively created to reinforce certain viewpoints about Buddhist doctrine and many teachings were not included.<br>  <br>  Other sutras, especially those known as the Mahayana sutras, were written down within about 100 years of the creation of the Pali Canon - although some Mahayana sutras were created much later. Like the sutras of the Pali Canon, the Mahayana sutras claim to represent the actual words of the Buddha.<br>  <br>  While oral traditions can certainly carry forward the essential meaning of a teaching, few scholars believe that any of the sutras that were written down in the 1st century BCE, several hundred years after Buddha's death, represent the literal, precise teachings of the Buddha.<br>  <br>  The Lotus Sutra was probably composed in the 1st century BCE, most likely in far northwest India or Kashmir. This is the region in which Mahayana teaching was dominant and the Lotus Sutra does not appear in the Pali Canon, nor in Theravadin teaching (the Theravada tradition is the sole remaining school based on the Pali Canon). It is one of the first sutras to use the term Mahayana.<br>  <br>  The Lotus Sutra provides an important foundation for the Vajrayana tradition (Tibetan Buddhism) and some schools of East Asian Mahayana Buddhism. The sutra is strongly self-referential and makes claims that it alone represents a secret teaching of the Buddha - and the highest teaching of the Buddha. The sutra contains many teachings that go beyond what is claimed in other sutra and some view it with suspicion. For example, it claims that buddhas have some sort of immortality - a claim that goes against the well-documented view of Buddha that all things are impermanent and have no-self. This is all controversial stuff - and in my opinion, it leads the practitioner away from serious practice.

I have been studying with the Jehovah's Witnesses and of course they do not believe in Trinity. They do not even know what the Biblical Trinity is because their Watchtower Society has given them false information about what is the Trinity that Christians teach.<br>  <br>  In Jehovah's Witnesses rendering of the Bible, NWT ( New World Translation ) 1 John 1:7,8 goes like this:<br>  <br>  7. For there are three witness bearers<br>  8. the spirit ( e) and the water ( f)  and the blood ( g), and the three are in agreement (h)<br>  <br>  For the  spirit (e) they give 2 Tim 4:7 as the cross reference<br>  " I have fought the fine fight, I have run the course to finish, I have observed the faith"<br>  <br>  For the water (f) they give 1 Cor 15:57<br>  " But thanks to God for he gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ "<br>  <br>  For the blood (g) they give 1 John 4:4<br>  " You originate with God, little children, and YOU have conquered those persons, because he that is in union with YOU is greater than he that is in union with the world. "<br>  <br>  For the three in agreement (h) they give Eph 6:16<br>  " Above all things, take up the large shield of faith, which YOU will be able to quench all the wicked one's all the buning missles"<br>  <br>  AND they give  1 John 3:23<br>  " Indeed, this is his commandment, that we have faith in the name o His Son Jesus Christ and be loving one another, just as he gave us commandment."<br>  <br>  Personally I believe in Trinity. Even though the word Trinity is not in the Bible, the concept of the Holy Trinity is throughout the Bible.<br>  <br>  However, recarding the "When Critics Ask" by Geisler, Howe, we need to read following about the 1 John 5:7;<br>  <br>  "PROBLEM: John declares that " there are three who bear witness in heaven: the Father, the Word, and the Holy Spirit; and these three are one" ( KJV ). This is the clearest statement on the Trinity in the Bible. However, most modern translations omit this verse. Why?<br>  <br>  SOLUTION: The reason is vry simple. This verse has virutally no support among the early Greek manuscropts, though it is found in Latin manuscripts. Its appearance in late Greek manuscrpts is based on the fact tht Erasmus was placed under the ecclesiastical  pressure to include it in his Greek NT of 1522, having omitted it in his two earlier editions of 1516 and 1519 because he could not find any Greek manuscripts which contained it.<br>  <br>  Its inclusion in the Latin Bible probably results from a scribe incorporating a marginal comment ( gloss ) into the text as he copied the manuscript of 1 John. But including it in the text violates almost every rule of textual criticism. Even the NKJV, which generally retains the longer readings and disbuted passages and John 7:53:8-11 ), comments in the margin that this is " a passage found in only four or five very late Greek mss."<br>  <br>  Historical formulation of Trinity is that God is one in essence and three in person. The unity of the  Godhead is affirmed in terms of essence or being, while the diversity of the Godhead is exressed in terms of person.<br>  <br>  The Bible clearly addresses and strongly affirms the unity of God ( Deut 6:4 ). Also the Word of God clearly affirms the full deity of the three persons of the Godhead: The Father an the Son and the Holy Spirit.<br>  <br>  The term 'person' does not mean the distinction IN ESSENCE but a different SUBSISTENCE in the Godhead. A subsistence in the Godhead is REAL difference but not an ESSENTIAL in the sence of a difference in being. Each person subsists or exists "under " under the pure essence of deity, one true God. Subsistence is a difference within the scope of being, not a separate being or essence. All persons in the Godhead have all the attributes of deity.<br>  <br>  There are also distinction in the work done by each memeber in Trinity. The work of salvation is in one sense common to all three persons of Trinity. Yet in the manner of activity, there are differing operations assumed byt the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit. <br>  <br>  +The Father initiates creation and redemption.<br>  +The Son redeems the creation.<br>  +The Holy Spirit regenerates and sanctifies, applying the redemption to believers.<br>  <br>  I realize because English is not my languge, I have mistakenly used used parts and roles in attempt to explain Trinity. The Trintiy does NOT refer to parts of God or even to roles. Human dialogues such as one man who is the father and the son and a husband, DOES NOT capture the mystery of the nature of God.<br>  <br>  The doctrine of Trinity defines the limits of our finite reflection. It demands that we be faithful to the Biblicla revelation  that in one sense God is One and a different sence God is three.
9680447e242a7c540f97466fb79f7a74aa	OLD TESTAMENT<br>  Exodus 34:5-9 (New International Version - UK)<br>  5 Then the LORD came down in the cloud and stood there with him and proclaimed his name, the LORD.<br>  <br>      6 And he passed in front of Moses, proclaiming, The LORD, the LORD, the compassionate and gracious God, slow to anger, abounding in love and faithfulness,<br>   FORGIVING WICKEDNESS , REBELLION AND SIN..<br>      7 maintaining love to thousands, and forgiving wickedness, rebellion and sin. Yet he does not leave the guilty unpunished; he punishes the children and their children for the sin of the fathers to the third and fourth generation.<br>  This brings us to verse 7 where the Lord continues to describe Himself, "Keeping mercy for thousands".  "Keeping" is natsar, meaning to guard, maintain or protect out of a sense of responsibility.  "Mercy" is checed, meaning kindness or benevolence (coming to the aid of those in need).  Checed always emphasizes the idea of covenant relationship.  And when checed and natsar are used together it is always to illustrate the principle of covenant responsibility!  This is God’s own description of His attitude towards His people - He has obligated Himself to be merciful (see Micah 7:18 which says that God "delights" in being merciful).  He continues: "forgiving iniquity (avown - immorality) and transgression (pesha - rebellion) and sin" (chattah - habitual sin, committed over and over again).<br>  <br>  Then comes the all-important phrase "and that will by no means clear the guilty".  Notice "the guilty" is in italics in the King James Version, indicating that these words are not found in the original text (and indeed should not be).  The translators added these supposedly to clarify the meaning.  The word "clear" in this sentence is naqah, and means, "to be clear of an obligation or responsibility".  By removing "the guilty" from the text, the meaning becomes evident: "God will by no means ever clear or release Himself from His covenant responsibility to maintain His mercy by continuing to forgive immorality, rebellion and habitual sins that are repeated over and over again!"  <br>  <a href="http://www.voiceofonecrying.com/generational_sins_or_god.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.voiceofonecrying.com/generati...</a><br>      8 Moses bowed to the ground at once and worshipped.<br>  <br>  New Testament<br>  <br>  Absolutely God shows love for  Sinners. by Forgiving them<br>  <br>  John 15:9-12<br>  "As the Father has loved me, so have I loved you.

4zscfvvoaa	What you seem to be asking here is how will you get to know God.  This is a quest that is really never ending.  It can take many years to get to know God.  Don't get discouraged here though.  I will tell you that reading the Bible is a great place to start.  I have also looked into many different forms of texts as well.  Knowledge helps, but I can let you know that you already know things of God and his works.<br>  <br>  You may not be able to see what is there.  You have not really learned how to tune into what you are looking for yet.  A great place, as well as easier than some, is to start noticing your feelings.  You have a world of emotions within you.  People throughout the ages have tried to explain emotion and it's source.  Why do you feel?  Science has proved that some feeling were necessary to survival.  It is easy to become discouraged yet again.  The science on human nature is based off of the same sources as religion, personal testimony.  Physiologist favorite question to ask patients is, "How are you feeling?"<br>  <br>  Religion teaches you to work with God about your feelings.  Faith grows stronger and stronger in time.  Forming a base of knowledge is key to having the arsenal of support for times of need.  You will find that passages, and scriptures keep you on track as times become difficult.<br>  <br>  Your heart will begain to grow as you expand your knowledge and faith.  Like anything else, learning to know God takes practice.  It doesn't take work, just soul searching.  The more you look, the more you find.|`|AA11380998	Jesus said I'm the way.

Is it too little for you to weary mortals, that you weary my God also? 14Therefore the Lord himself will give you a sign. Look, the young woman* is with child and shall bear a son, and shall name him Immanuel.* 15He shall eat curds and honey by the time he knows how to refuse the evil and choose the good. 16For before the child knows how to refuse the evil and choose the good, the land before whose two kings you are in dread will be deserted. 17The Lord will bring on you and on your people and on your ancestral house such days as have not come since the day that Ephraim departed from Judah—the king of Assyria.’<br>  <br>  edit<br>  <br>  In short, what Isaiah is saying is "Look at that pregnant woman (Ahaz's wife?):  She's going to have a boy, and that birth will signify that although the Northern tribes of Israel ("Ephraim") and the Kingdom of Assyria are besieging you, by the time that young woman's baby is weaned your kingdom will be out of trouble.|`|qyoXSdPCaa	The Bible's teaching about God, that He is one God revealed in three distinct persons--the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. The term "trinity" is not in the Bible, but the concept is (Mt. 28:19; 2 Co. 13:14; Ro. 8:9-11; 1 Jn. 5:7). The Philadelphia Confession of Faith (1742) stated, "In this Divine and Infinite Being there are three subsistences, the Father, the Word (or Son), and Holy Spirit, of one substance, power, and eternity, each having the whole divine essence, yet the essence undivided; the Father is of none neither begotten, nor proceeding; the Son is eternally begotten of the Father; the Holy Spirit proceeding from the Father and the Son, all infinite, without beginning, therefore but one God, who is not to be divided in nature and being, but distinguished by several peculiar relative properties and personal relations; which doctrine of the Trinity is the foundation of all our communion with God, and our comfortable dependence on him." This was the profession of faith held by most Christians until the modern era. The popular hymn Holy, Holy, Holy proclaims, "Holy, Holy, Holy, Lord God Almighty! ... Merciful and Mighty! God in Three Persons, blessed Trinity!" Our heart cries, Amen and amen! This is indeed the God of the Bible.<br>  BIBLE PROOF FOR THE TRINITY.<br>  1. The N.T. plainly teaches the Trinity (Mt. 28:19; Jn. 14:16,26; 16:7-15; 2 Co. 13:14; Ep. 4:4-6; 1 Jn. 5:7).<br>  2. Each Person of the Trinity is said to have separate personality (Jn. 16:7-15). <br>  3. Each Person of the Trinity is co-equal one with another (Jn. 5:17,18; Ph. 2:6,7).<br>  4. The O.T. teaches that God is One in three Persons<br>  Genesis 1:1. The Hebrew word for God here is Elohim. This is a plural noun, but the verb is singular. This teaches that there is one God in a plurality.<br>  Genesis 1:26. Again God is spoken of as plural, Elohim, yet we know from other O.T. passages that God is one (De. 6:4).<br>  Genesis 11:7,8. Here again God is spoken of in the plural and in the singular at the same time.<br>  Deuteronomy 6:4. This verse could be translated, "Jehovah our Elohim is a united Jehovah." The word "one" refers to a unity. The same word for one is used in Ge. 2:24, speaking of the oneness of a husband and wife. This verse summarizes the Bible's teaching about God. He is one but exists in three Persons.<br>  Psalm 45:6,7. According to He. 1:8,9, God the Father is speaking in Psalm 45, and He is referring to the Son as God. Sometime people ask, "If Jesus Himself was God, why did He address the Father as God?" The answer is that Jesus addressed the Father as God for the same reason that the Father addressed the Son as God--because they are both God!<br>  Isaiah 48:16. Here the Lord Jesus, the Son of God, is speaking and referring to God the Father and the Holy Spirit (compare Jn. 18:20).<br>  5. The Trinity is seen in Christ's life. At His incarnation and birth (Lk. 1:35). At His baptism (Mt. 3:16,17). At His resurrection (Compare Ac. 2:24; Jn. 2:19,21; 1 Pe. 3:18).<br>  6. Each Person of the Trinity is said to do the same works. Creation (compare Is. 44:24; Col. 1:16; Job 26:13). Indwelling the Christian (compare Ro. 8:9,10,11). Salvation (Ep. 2:18). The New Covenant (He. 9:14). Election (1 Pe. 1:2). <br>  "BUT THE DOCTRINE OF THE TRINITY DOESN'T MAKE SENSE." The chief argument used against the doctrine of the Trinity is that it doesn't make sense. It doesn't seem reasonable. The answer to this is that we must believe the Bible regardless of whether or not it makes sense to our puny human understanding (He. 11:6). Is it really reasonable for us to demand that we understand perfectly everything about God? We do not fully understand even our own selves or the world in which we live. How can we expect to fully understand the eternal, Almighty God? 2 Ti. 2:23 warns us to avoid foolish and unlearned questions. A foolish question is one which is used to overthrow plain Bible teaching, such as questions about the Trinity, or the resurrection, or the incarnation of Christ, or the condition of man after death. The false teacher asks foolish questions which cause people to doubt the Word of God. The true teacher encourages people to believe the Word of God regardless of whether it's teachings seem perfectly reasonable.<br>  HOW DOES THE DOCTRINE OF THE TRINITY DIFFER FROM POLYTHEISM? Jehovah's Witnesses and others charge that the doctrine of the Trinity is a polytheistic concept similar to Hinduism. This is not so. Consider the following significant differences:<br>  1. The gods of polytheism are not truly one. Though the idolater says he believes in one god, he does not. Hindu gods, for example, fight one another, marry one another, create one another, destroy one another! Contrariwise, the Trinity of the Bible is one in purpose, in mind, in power, in glory, and in action.<br>  2. Polytheism says God is revealed in many manifestations. The Trinity teaches that God is revealed in one incarnation, Jesus Christ. In Him is all fullness of deity. He is the image of the invisible God.|`|ZKLlTxd0aa	Of course it means Jesus is the Almighty Father!

Jesus declared, "I say unto you, Before Abraham was, I am. " Again, in response, the Jews take up stones in an attempt to stone Jesus (John 8:59). Why would the Jews want to stone Jesus if He hadn’t said something they believed to be blasphemous, namely, a claim to be God? John repeatedly tells us of the Lord's connection to "I Am".  See John: 4:26, 8:24, 8:28, 8:58,and 13:19.  The Apostle Paul tells us that Jesus "..is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of every creature: For by him were all things created, that are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers: all things were created by him, and for him: And he is before all things, and by him all things consist." (Colossians 1:15-17)<br>  <br>  John 1:1 says that “the Word was God.” John 1:14 says that “And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us” This clearly indicates that Jesus is God in the flesh. Acts 20:28 tells us, "...Be shepherds of the church of God, which He bought with His own blood." Who bought the church with His own blood? Jesus Christ. Acts 20:28 declares that God purchased the church with His own blood. Therefore, Jesus is God!

For instance, telling the truth is exceptionally important, but telling a lie to save someone's life is the right thing to do (as is seen by the Hebrew midwives who were blessed though they lied about the Hebrew mothers to Pharaoh).  <br>  As far as tolerance.  The Bible is not 'pro-tolerance'.  We as Christians must tolerate all other people, but we must not tolerate evil.   In fact, intolerance is a beautiful thing.  All of my heroes were/are intolerant.  SB Anthony was intolerant of abortion and gender bias, MLK was intolerant of discrimination, Abe Lincoln was intolerant of slavery, R Reagan was intolerant of confiscatory tax rates (as was G. Washington).|`|A01w1dHqaa	Tolerance? Be wise as serpents but harmless as doves.

A man under a vow to abstain from wine, from any cutting of the hair, and any contact with the dead (Judg. 13: 5; Judg. 16: 17; 1 Sam. 1: 11; Amos 2: 11, 12; for full regulations see Num. 6).

I am also going to try and stray away from the other foods that I am tempted toward, such as chocolate. <br>  I am also wanting to spend more of my time devoted to God. I would like to start praying the Rosary, along with trying to help out as much as I can at our Parish.<br>  This year, I can say that I am ready for Lent, and excited too.<br>  What is also very neat is that our newly located Parish is planned to open the week after Easter.

Not believing in God doesn't mean you don't experience joy. That you don't marvel at the world. That you don't have respect for your common man.<br>  <br>  You just don't believe there is some big guy in the sky that loves you and has a plan. <br>  <br>  A person I know asked me how I could be good if I didn't believe that there would be a hell to punish me if I was bad,. I replied that I was good because it was the right thing to do. You still have a conscious, a sense of right and wrong. Those qualities don't belong to the religious. We all know people who were religious who have done bad things (Catholic pedophile priests for instance). <br>  <br>  Not believing in God doesn't make you bad, just like believing in God doesn't necessarily make you good.<br>  <br>  FOr me it's not so much about evidence. I was raised going to church my whole childhood. Even when I was seven years old I never believed in God. It never rang true for me. I thought I would get it when I got older...I didn't.

It was churchly people who told Copernicus, "The earth doesn't revolve around the sun.  Use your eyes, man!  Mathematics?  What kind of evidence is that? We won't believe it."<br>  <br>  Love, happiness, etc. are emotions and are part of our existence.  To deny them would be foolish.  Morals, also part and parcel of ourselves from earliest times, center around a human ethos of "what is hateful to yourself do not do to others."

Try again.|`|AA11297267	I don't have to "believe" -- I can feel love, so I know it's a real emotion (no belief involved).  Science shows us the chemical reactions that our brains and bodies go through when we feel love, so we know what causes it.  Evolution gives natural explanations as to why our brains and bodies evolved to feel love (it helps bond our family and social group together and enhances our survivability).  Lots of evidence as to how and why there is "love" -- you don't need to assume a god to explain it.<br>  <br>  Pretty much the same thing for happiness.<br>  <br>  "Morals" are a combination of innate evolved traits of fairness and in-group sociability, combined with moden ideas of codified law and rules that enable societies of large numbers of people to get along reasonably harmoniously.  Again -- no need for a "god" to have morals.<br>  <br>  I'm not sure how you'd define "unconditional love" -- honestly, I can't say I've ever met anyone who has "unconditional love," there are always conditions...even with the love most parents have for their children.

Morality is caused by mirror neurons which respond to the emotions of other human beings, and make your actions seem more personal ("Would I like it if someone did this to me?").<br>  <br>  These chemical reactions exist in ALL species, but since humans are very emotionally complex, it seems more robust to us. And we are not the only animal like that - elephants, for example, have an extremely high emotional depth. They have burial rituals for their dead, and have been known to perform altruistic "moral question" actions like saving other animals from harm, and acting altruistically for the good of the majority.<br>  <br>  People who are loving, happy, and moral do positive things in society and with other people, which in turn makes others more loving, happy, and moral, and the cycle continues.<br>  <br>  A lot of people think that's a very cold way to see the world, but I don't see why. Just because we know the cause doesn't make our experiences less real. It doesn't change the fact that being loving, happy, and moral brings us personal joy.<br>  <br>  EDIT: Love + empathy (chemicals + mirror neurons) = unconditional love.<br>  <br>  So yes.|`|86PUxs1jaa	Love and happiness are human emotional states.  Morals are instinctive social behaviors.  Those things have no actual physical existence and are merely concepts used to explain or describe human behavior.  <br>  <br>  The fact you ask such a question demonstrates you apparently consider your own mental activities to actually be real -- rather than merely a consequence of the natural processes occurring within your own living brain.  <br>  <br>  Science deals only with objective physical reality -- mostly the interactions of various types of energy with various types of matter.  Science uses abstractions such as mathematics to help explain reality, but is careful to not confuse the abstraction with the actual object.  Love, happiness, and morals are also abstractions and, though they are the direct result of mental processes within a living physical brain, they have no physical existence in and of themselves.  <br>  <br>  The male's instinctive urge to bond with a mate is almost entirely controlled by a hormone called oxytocin, which is released by our pituitary each time we have an orgasm.  Oxytocin causes men to become imprinted on their sex partner and leads to the long term loyality men feel towards their spouse.  It is also the reason it's relatively easy for men to change their romantic loyalties by simply finding a new sex partner.  Oxytocin is the hormone that causes men to essentially love the one they're with.  Oxytocin is also psychologically addictive, which is why we keep going back for more sex.  When a woman fails to provide the continuing sexual oppurtunities needed to allow her lover to manage his oxytocin addiction, men are literally driven to find another partner who will.  This is why men are such dawgs and why women who presume men's emotions work much like their own are so often bitterly disappointed.  Withholding sex from young man in love is the surest way to drive him into the arms of another.  <br>  <br>  Oxytocin behaves much differently in women, but it is known that a suckling infant causes a release of oxytocin which bonds a woman to her offspring.  It is also known that babies can receive oxytocin in breast milk, because nipple stimulation causes the mother's pituitary to release it into her bloodstream.  Bottle fed babies and mothers frequently fail to emotionally imprint on each other because they do not exploit their natural oxytocin bonding behaviors.  There is also a statistical correlation between having been a bottle fed baby and misogyny among adult males.  A large dose of oxytocin is frequently administered following childbirth to cause the uterus to contract and to start lactation.  Wild animals generally eat the placenta for the same reason.  <br>  <br>  Interesting...  You apparently believe you correctly understand reality and presume that I am merely 'rationalizing.'  I feel exactly the inverse and believe all of religion is one giant irrationalization.  The thing is, I can easily substantiate my views with actual verifiable evidence.  Can you?<br>  <br>  As for unconditional love, I don't think that's even possible for humans.  The only unconditional love I've ever experienced came from a dog who simply loved me, no matter what.  Human women generally can't do that because, as human beings, they are largely driven by their own (necessarily selfish) motives, not by simple instinct.|`|075c7DdDaa	There is evidence for those 3 things.<br>  <br>  Love and happiness are (like everyone else says) chemical reactions in the brain. You can create both of those emotions, along with others, by stimulating certain areas in the brain or by using certain chemical substances.<br>  <br>  Morals are societal norms and are based on instinct. You don't kill others because that would put you in a position where you could get killed. It's all basically based on the 'golden rule' which is a basis for many religions although the rule itself is not religious in nature.|`|FIXKYCIGaa	You're claiming no disrespect while accusing atheists of rationalization.  Well, no disrespect when I say that your question isn't particularly well thought out.  You're attempting to equate emotions with a God that is believed by some to have done specific things.

They should just spend their lives lonely and unhappy because you think gay sex is icky?<br>  <br>  What kinda sick control freak are you?<br>  <br>  And its especially ironic considering the prevalence of priests not only having gay sex, but raping young children. So much for your great plan.|`|J7KSKm54aa	That makes sence- since a priest is not allowed to get married.|`|yhFJzscmaa	That's without any logic. Being "gay" implies being sexually active for one. No one even really talks about their orientation, no matter what the source. Secondly, the demands of the priesthood require a fully healthy and normal male. Meaning, one who have all the whereabouts to be a good husband and father. Having an orientation as you suggest would obviously not lend itself to that.|`|y7qJayDVaa	No, the bible says that gays will not inherit the kingdom of god. This is a very misunderstood principle. The Church Does not hate gays anyone can go to church, they just should know they wont go to heaven. If the bible says its wrong to be gay why would god want priests to be homosexual?|`|lga42XVraa	I guess that depends on who your God is.<br>  <br>  Only priests that have taken a vow of celibacy aren't supposed to have sex. Some priests never take the vow. Some priests are married with children.|`|iYW2ZVuFaa	No.<br>  <br>  First you presume that God exists and then it is only a convenient way to deal with the idea that being gay is biologically determined.|`|JzyhBtokaa	If there is really a god who discriminates against gays (and women) in such a way, is that really the type of person who should be worshipped?|`|SPNHhFXoaa	"and priests aren't supposed to have sex"<br>  <br>  LOL.

This may or may not be true.  It may just be that people are now talking about it instead of being ashamed of it and hiding it.    My theory is that this world is becoming way to populated.  Break throughs in medicine are now allowing us to live better and longer then ever before.  I believe we are evolving into a race of people who are drawn to those of their own sex.  This could just be a natural way of taking care of the overpopulation.|`|fxNOVa9faa	which part of the bible says that priest are not allowed to have sex?|`|XowM9e7Naa	No that would not be logical.  In the Eastern churches such as the Eastern rites of the Catholic church and the Orthodox church, priests are allowed to be married under certain conditions.|`|wuPTBIIuaa	it is written:<br>  he gives them up to their lusts.<br>  <br>  which means he basically leaves them alone to their own thing in the end, if they will not repent, the greater sin is theirs.

q5lreoiWaa	I don't follow your first question sorry so I will addess your second,God bestows on different people different gifts, would not Heaven be a sad place indeed if everyone spoke in Tongues and noone interpreted them?|`|XowM9e7Naa	I think St Paul discussed this.  It is not necessary for salvation.|`|UinOWcMUaa	No -- it is a gift but not required for salvation :) it is one of many evidences of the Holy Spirit -- but not all peole have the gift of tounges, just not all people are called to Pastor :)<br>  <br>  Consider the following verses in 1 Cor. 12.<br>  <br>  1 Cor. 12:7-11, "But the manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man to profit withal. 8For to one is given by the Spirit the word of wisdom; to another the word of knowledge by the same Spirit; 9 To another faith by the same Spirit; to another the gifts of healing by the same Spirit; 10 To another the working of miracles; to another prophecy; to another discerning of spirits; to another divers kinds of tongues; to another the interpretation of tongues.  11But all these worketh that one and the selfsame Spirit, dividing to every man severally as he will." <br>  <br>  1 Cor. 12:29-30, "Are all apostles? are all prophets? are all teachers? are all workers of miracles? 30Have all the gifts of healing? do all speak with tongues? do all interpret?"|`|592517cb7a38eb4f9614445c37df538aaa	The Bible says tongues are a gift, not a prerequisite for salvation.<br>  <br>  Apostolic and Holiness denominations are both rather close in theology and both fairly new in the grand scheme of things, formed around 1900 years after Christ walked the earth. As both denominations have rejected most of Christian history as relevant to their theology, neither is complete in their doctrine.|`|bfc067ab537555ada57edd464a8dfb97aa	Apostolic means it came from the Apostle, like the succession of Peter as the first head of the Church and passed down in Apostolic succession to Benedict XVI<br>  Holiness is something we try at attain to but speaking in tongues was a gift the Apostles received when they were filled with the Holy Spirit on Pentecost and everyone understood them. Each in their own language even though they were Galileans.|`|AA10447191	If your going to speak in tongues you should translate.<br>  <br>  I'm a Christian and I do not believe in speaking in tongues.|`|UR4mWefGaa	I think apostolic rejects the doctrine of the trinity. They place most emphasis on about 20 verses or so. The holiness part is a real sham. People think if they dress like the turn of the 20th century, no makeup jewelry, long hair. Most of these practices are imposed on the women, and not the men. They call that holiness. If they really believed their stuff, they would realize holiness comes from their god, not their dress code. <br>  Speaking in tongues is not real languages like they claim. It is called glossolalia. It has been studied by linguists, and is likened to baby talk, because the same parts in the brain are stimulated like babies learning to talk. <br>  it is all jibber jabber to me.|`|s6s4BBkDaa	The fact that you exist you have been saved, for the dead have been delivered; talking in Tongues is a skill, as long as you can answer for what you speak and explain what you have expressed; being in Control is conforming to the concept that "God helps them who help them-<br>  selves."  There should be no denomination on Earth, and if there is it is in the dominion of Men.***END***|`|FOzN3xwzaa	Both are wrong. <br>  <br>  Tongues are not required for salvation, and water baptism is also not required for salvation.  <br>  <br>  And the Trinity is true. <br>  <br>  The truth is that salvation is a FREE GIFT that happens in a split second when you believe in Jesus! It is impossible to lose or "leave" salvation. <br>  <br>  The truth about Jesus is that the only way to be saved and to get into heaven and avoid being sent to eternal hell, is by believing in faith alone that Jesus, who is God, died for our sins on the cross as FULL PAYMENT for all our sins, and then Jesus rose from the dead (1 Corinthians 15:1-4). Believe this and you will be in heaven, no matter what! <br>  <br>  Please pray now: "Jesus, please forgive me of my sins. I believe that You died on the cross for my sins and You rose from the dead.

Both people in a same sex couple are capable of working and getting their own benefits so there is no need to give them "rights" under the law to preserve society like a married couple receives.  <br>  <br>  Whether you or anyone else likes it or not, reproducing and raising children stabilize a society, and that is why the state recognizes benefits for married couples and why there are benefits for spouses.  <br>  <br>  If 2 people of the same sex want this, they can write a contract since they can't have a marriage as defined by law.|`|ZTOC9cvtaa	They should not be allowed in any States, if they want to live together then so be it.

AA11440601	You misunderstant Papal Infallibility a bit. Catholics do not believe that "Whatever the Pope says or does, God will agree with it."<br>  <br>  The Catholic Church teaches that the Pope is infallible at closely defined times.<br>  <br>  This miracle only happens when the Pope, in union with the body of bishops, solemnly teaches that a doctrine as true. This is called "ex cathedra", literally meaning in Latin  "from the chair".<br>  <br>  This comes from the words of Jesus to Peter (the first Pope) and the Apostles (the first bishops),  "Whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven" (Matthew 18:18) and "He who hears you hears me" (Luke 10:16).<br>  <br>  At all other times the Pope can be just as wrong or sinful as you and me and be in need of forgiveness.<br>  <br>  For more information, see the Catechism of the Catholic Church, section 891: <a href="http://www.usccb.org/catechism/text/pt1sect2chpt3art9p4.shtml#891" rel="nofollow">http://www.usccb.org/catechism/text/pt1s...</a> <br>  <br>  With love in Christ.|`|XowM9e7Naa	I am a Catholic who studied theology.  I think that what the priest said about the pope is in general correct, but there are many if's, and's, and but's in that statement.|`|a7fd823ff38cea82d01dbcb747972460aa	This statement is false. The Pope needs to speak ex-cathedra for a statement to be made dogma and it has only happened a couple of times in the history of the Church---The Holy Spirit would in fact take him out if he were to try to do something against the will of God---this is why the Pope can speak infallibly when it comes to dogma. Personally the Pope can sin just like everybody else and on occasion in the history of the Church has done so but just like the couple in Scripture that fell down and breathed their last because they lied about selling their land and contributing  all of the money to the Church, the Pope is subject to the same judgment and he knows it. This is also why when they elect a new Pope it is done in the Sistine Chapel  where the picture of God shines down upon them to remind them.|`|93galWG1aa	Back right up, No God does not agree with every thing the Pope says or does, and then you assume the Pope of latter years was responsible for the crusades... The Pope is the head of a faith belief not a general op politician he can not instigate war.|`|tfuPCVzOaa	God actually hates the Pope for leading so many trusting people into Hell.|`|gDVQNMR7aa	The Pope has no power to declare war on anyone. Who will he have fight - thousands of priests?|`|tpDICzslaa	Papal infallability is much more limited than you seem to believe. It relates only to very formal (ex cathedra) declarations on matters of faith, morals and dogma. On other matters the Pope has only human authority and it is quite possible for him to be wrong. <br>  <br>  Even in matters spiritual the Pope is constrained by the authority of scripture and tradition. This means he cannot declare to be true anything which contradicts a previously accepted Christian truth, he can only speak with authority on matters which are undecided.<br>  <br>  The current Pope is perfectly aware of the limits of his authority. In his introduction to his book 'Jesus of Nazareth', for instance, he writes "It goes without saying that this book is in no way an exercise of the magesterium, but is solely an expression of my personal search for the face of the Lord. Everyone is free, then, to contradict me. I would only ask my readers for the initial goodwill without which there can be no understanding."|`|daFmqiIIaa	i'm not sure i quite agree with your first statement.  if the pope says that genocide is ok, then God most certainly would not agree with him!  the pope is human, just like the rest of us.  we all make mistakes, and we all need Christ's free gift of eternity.

Litterally it does not, but much of the Bible is figurative. <br>  <br>  If you read Genesis 1:1 it states that God created the world and it was perfect. Then, in Genesis 1:2, he starts adding things. It is a popular belief that between the two scriptures, there was a broad expanse of time in which Lucifer fell. This would negate the thought that many people have about the Earth being only 6,000 years old.<br>  <br>  Later on, the Bible states that time is irrelevent to Him. So, one day could be hundreds, or even thousands of years. Then you move to the chronological order in which He creates all things, and it follows suit with Evolution. Who is to say that Adam and Eve did not look like the early Human beings that have been found, and we as a species have not adapted from there?|`|AA11614460	there are two branches or theoretical explanations... <br>  <br>  Creationism: (religion-affiliated) some great being or force made us<br>  <br>  Evolutionism: we evolved. from apes; though not modern apes. the apes that we evolved from are no longer in existence, the apes then turned into different hominids--> then homo sapien --> homo sapien sapien.

Truth cannot contradict truth.  Evolution does NOT say we evolved from apes!  The Bible says God created us from inorganic matter (the dust of the earth) but it does not reveal  the process through which God did so.  Science describes the process for us, which does not conflict in any way with what the Bible says.  The known FACT that the earth is billions of years old doesn't negate the biblical idea that God created all that exists in six periods of time.  But it does show that a literalist interpretation of "days" is simply wrong.  You do realize that the length of a "day" is different on every planet, and that there is no such thing as a "day" unless you are on a planet.  Can you really think that God, who is outside of time, based the creation of the entire universe on the period of one little plant in one solar system in one galaxy among billions, which hadn't even been created yet???|`|QnH9QuQwaa	The Bible doesn't contradict as much as people may think, with evolution that is.  Wait a moment...<br>  <br>  1.  Genesis states that God created the Earth and Stars.  It doesn't include that in the first day.  It also states that He approached the Earth and it void and without form (in Hebrew, void and caotic).  We don't know why it was full of caos.<br>  2.  He created plants, then water dependent animals, then birds, then land animals, lastly mankind.  This agrees with our present beliefs about evolution.|`|3r252UIRaa	Unfortunately it's already been proven that the earth was formed millions of years ago, and evolution has already been proven.|`|YOWnMp0Xaa	Learn Ancient Hebrew, read the original text of the bible, then you tell me|`|nTY2RXlkaa	depends how you look at it. <br>  <br>  1. evolution is not proven and is just a theory.<br>  2. if evolution did happen, it could have only happen with animals and not humans.<br>  3. the big bang also is not proven but is likely. god could have created the universe in the form of the big bang, then made humans on earth and then some animals which due to mutations evolved. humans mutated too but i think they mutated from a primitive form of a human (caveman) and not from a monkey.|`|3890f326e072192e79ea3f718551dfb8aa	The Bible is a book written by men. We don't know their motivations, experience, or agenda. And some religious institutions accept evolution in spite of what it says in the Bible - the Catholic Church is a prime example.<br>  <br>  Evolution is a science based on studying the fossil record, genetics, and even behaviors and psychology. <br>  <br>  The difference is one is based on myth and the other is based on science.|`|zyoGZ3sxaa	the bible is proven wrong. we've made organic substance with lighning and chamicals and other nonorganic substances.|`|d5GfhPM4aa	yes and we evolved from bacteria and so did every animal on the planet|`|mzhFrm5Taa	They are seperate belief systems you douche.

There is no irrefutable evidence to say humans evolved from apes. Evolution is a verified and observed process in the for that we see today. (Speciation and the amplification of positive traits through selective breeding.)<br>  I'm sorry to report that most of what science says about the origin of life is mainly speculation. Educated guesses.  Personally, I believe in evolution.  I am also a christian and believe in the origins described in the Bible.  I reconcile the differences between the to like so: <br>            1: God, in his infinite wisdom and power, would know that the environments he created for his creatures would change. He gave those creatures the ability to cope with such changes. The process a creature undergoes to deal with environmental changes is what we scientists call evolution.<br>             2: A day to god is 1000 years to man. (I'm paraphrasing)Psalms 90-4.<br>             3:As a scientist I know that we aren't even close to knowing everything. I realize that the theory of evolution is just a theory. Theories are wrong sometimes. It's just the best fit for the data we have.<br>  <br>  So there you are. A man's internal conflict, resolved in 1000 words or less. :)|`|akvrwpywaa	Not necessarily.  You have to take into consideration the writing style of each.<br>  Science books are good for providing scientific truth, how things are, but not so good at explaining religious truth.<br>  The Bible is good for providing religious truth, why things are, but not so good at explaining scientific truth.|`|hr4zqzLJaa	First: The Bible doesnt say the World was created in six literal human sense days.<br>  Was all physical creation accomplished in just six days sometime within the past 6,000 to 10,000 years?<br>  <br>  The facts disagree with such a conclusion: (1)?Light from the Andromeda nebula can be seen on a clear night in the northern hemisphere. It takes about 2,000,000 years for that light to reach the earth, indicating that the universe must be at least millions of years old. (2)?End products of radioactive decay in rocks in the earth testify that some rock formations have been undisturbed for billions of years.<br>  <br>  Genesis 1:3-31 is not discussing the original creation of matter or of the heavenly bodies. It describes the preparation of the already existing earth for human habitation. This included creation of the basic kinds of vegetation, marine life, flying creatures, land animals, and the first human pair. All of this is said to have been done within a period of six “days.” However, the Hebrew word translated “day” has a variety of meanings, including ‘a long time; the time covering an extraordinary event.’ (Old Testament Word Studies, Grand Rapids, Mich.; 1978, W. Wilson, p. 109) The term used allows for the thought that each “day” could have been thousands of years in length.<br>  Second: It is ilogical to descent from apes<br>  Students at a primary school in Taiwan were asked to write an essay for an annual writing competition. The theme was “My Favorite Book.” Ten-year-old Weizhen wrote that the Bible was her favorite book. Besides commenting on the accuracy of Bible prophecy and the fine guidance God’s Word gives, she explained that the Bible has given her answers to questions that neither her teachers nor her fellow students could answer satisfactorily. “Our teacher told us that man’s ancestors evolved from monkeys,” wrote Weizhen. “I thought to myself: ‘If man descended from monkeys, should we not show them respectful devotion and feel heartfelt gratitude? So why do we lock them up in cages in zoos? Doesn’t that make us guilty of serious wrongdoing?’ But the Bible clearly answers: We have not, in fact, descended from monkeys. Rather, our ancestors were created in God’s image from the dust of the ground.” She concluded her composition by writing: “They said in ancient times, ‘Reading a book is like opening a treasure chest.’ In my opinion, the Bible is more precious than gold. Consequently, this book is the one I love reading the most.” Her composition won first prize even among entries submitted by middle school students, although she is in fourth grade. <br>  Third:  The Bible is scientifically accurate. It even contains information that was far ahead of its time. For example, the book of Leviticus contained laws for ancient Israel on quarantine and hygiene when surrounding nations knew nothing about such matters. At a time when there were wrong ideas about the shape of the earth, the Bible referred to it as a circle, or sphere. (Isaiah 40:22) The Bible accurately said that the earth ‘hangs on nothing.’ (Job 26:7) Of course, the Bible is not a science textbook. But when it touches on scientific matters, it is accurate.|`|PvqLMauCaa	the bible also says that the earth is flat and that the sun revolves around the earth.

We are comprised of three parts; physical body, soul (will, personality, mind), and spirit (the invisible, eternal part of us).

That's the only way to get into heaven.  Jesus is God, and if you believe in Him, then He never leaves you nor forsakes you! :)<br>  <br>  Salvation is a FREE GIFT that happens in a split second when you believe in Jesus! It is impossible to lose or "leave" salvation. <br>  <br>  The truth about Jesus is that the only way to be saved and to get into heaven and avoid being sent to eternal hell, is by believing in faith alone that Jesus, who is God, died for our sins on the cross as FULL PAYMENT for all our sins, and then Jesus rose from the dead (1 Corinthians 15:1-4). Believe this and you will be in heaven, no matter what! <br>  <br>  Please pray now: "Jesus, please forgive me of my sins. I believe that You died on the cross for my sins and You rose from the dead. Thank You for eternal life!" You will be in heaven with Him forever when you die. :)|`|XowM9e7Naa	Once you have been baptized you have an indelible mark on your soul.

A second baptism will satisfy the other Pentecostals, but God was satisfied when your grandfather baptized you when you were an infant. We only need one baptism. Baptism is there to wash away the stain of original sin. It can not be gotten rid of twice! <br>  <br>  Those who call infant baptism unbiblical do not know their scripture very well. The Bible contains many indications of infant baptism, which is why the vast majority of Christians throughout history have believed and practiced it. <br>  <br>  Acts 16:15 "She was baptized, with her household."<br>  <br>  Acts 15:33 "He was baptized at once, with all his family."<br>  <br>  1 Corinthians 1:16 "I did baptize also the household of Stephanas."<br>  <br>  It would be unreasonable, if the entire households were baptized, that these households did not include infants and children. <br>  <br>  Because of the purpose of baptism, then, it is most definitely NOT necessary for you to be rebaptized. Your baptism as an infant was valid. To be rebaptized is to say that it was not, and would be offensive not only to your grandfather's memory but to God.|`|lxQ8dLC5aa	Be baptized if you want to be saved and live with the Lord in heaven forever.  Look, the greatest proof is Jesus did it and he received the Holy Spirit, what more proof do you need.<br>  <br>  The path to eternal life starts with the grace of God, freely-given, and the hearing of his word, from which comes hope and belief, with belief comes faith, with faith comes baptism, with baptism comes the Holy Spirit and repentance, and with true repentance comes forgiveness of our sins. This is the path which leads to our everlasting comfort and joy in the outstretched arms of our Lord and savior, Jesus Christ.<br>  <br>  Clearly, the Bible says those who have faith accept water baptism, calling on God's names to wash away our sins. And from this baptism in water we are filled with the Spirit without limit, the Holy Spirit, who baptizes with fire. And when you receive the Spirit of Truth into your soul and He is one with you, He will teach you, and guide you, and comfort you for the rest of eternity.<br>  <br>  The Bible and the Catholic Church say anyone can baptize anyone. All you need do is take running water and place it on your fingers and touch the person's forehead or pour it over the persons head (Catholics do it three times) and say, "I baptize you in the name of the Father, and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit." That is it. (Catholic Catechism Number 1256)<br>  <br>  Most theologians believe you can only be baptized once and after that you maybe confirmed by the church.  The only exception I know of is that some churches believe that the Mormons do not baptize in the name of the spiritual Trinity and hence you need to be baptized into the real Trinity.<br>  <br>  Godspeed.

Galileo was put under house arrest.  It is interesting that you mention these two individuals because BOTH of them considered themselves to be Christians.  To paraphrase Galileo, mathematics is the language God used to create the universe.<br>  <br>  Modern persecution of atheists?  I need to see sources for this.  Murder?  Very few Christians commit murder.  <br>  <br>  As far as persecution of atheists are concerned, I would suggest that you read up on Josef Stalin and the death count in Soviet Russia under his rule.  I'm not saying godless atheists are prone to being tyrants.  I'm saying that religion is not the sole cause of murder and wars in history.  <br>  <br>  The Dark Ages didn't necessarily mean that people lived in "the dark" or were technologically backward.  There was progress being made at that time. <br>  <br>  The Inquisition and the Crusades did exist, however, they both go against Biblical Christianity.  It is unbiblical to force someone to come to Christ or kill someone for Christ.<br>  <br>  You might want to consider reading "The Victory of Reason" by Rodney Stark.

All of the widows were commanded to bear children by the brothers of the fallen even if they had no children. <br>  but the children conceived would be raised up unto the name of the dead fathers. <br>  sex is not about lust and gratutous sex! its about created temples (bodies of flesh and blood) that spirits can come and gain mortal life in hopes of gaining a resurrected body to be raised incorruptible in the resurrection. <br>  <br>  but NO i dont think joe smith had any orgies.<br>  <br>  PS, it is written that David or solomon, ( iforget which one) when He took a plural wife, he went unto some women ONLY ONCE and never knew them again.|`|LnoyylQ7aa	they are wives not girlfriends|`|uhIeM5y7aa	The Bible indicates that Abraham, Jacob, and others of the Lord’s servants had multiple wives (see Genesis 16:1–3; 29:23–30; 30:4, 9; Judges 8:30; 1 Samuel 1:1–2). Joseph Smith asked God why He had permitted this practice and was told that God had commanded it for specific purposes. One reason given by the Lord for plural marriage is mentioned in the Book of Mormon: “If I will, saith the Lord of Hosts, raise up seed unto me, I will command my people; otherwise they shall [have only one wife]” (Jacob 2:30; see also v. 27<br>  <br>  It wasn't for pleasure.

It's just an attention thing for the middle kid in my opinion.|`|AAglvbfbaa	I think in some families this happens but I don't think it's because the parents don't love the middle child . My own personal opinion is that the first born receives a lot of the parents time and love because they are the only child , the second child comes along and the parents try to share the attention between the two, when the third child comes along usually the first born is able to do a lot for themselves , the second child just seems to get forgotten about because of the attention needed to look  after a new baby, a house the two older kids.Hope this makes sense.|`|J7KSKm54aa	I grew up by that theory and I detest that theory.

8cuPVvYnaa	Of course we should. Jesus said that we would do greater works than he (as his body on earth - with many more arms and legs than he had!!). Have you ever heard of Smith Wigglesworth. He was just a common man, a plumber. But when he found out about Jesus, he took God's word very seriously. He made the choice to read nothing but God's word and simply believed everything it said (what an idea!). Many people were healed as a result. My favorite story of one of these healings was about a man who had no legs. Wigglesworth met him and felt God wanted to give him his legs back.  So he told the man to go to the shoe store in the morning and buy himself a pair of shoes. The man went to the shoe store first thing in the morning and told the salesman that he needed a pair of shoes. The salesman looked confused and a bit flustered and said, "Well, what size?" The man thought about it for a minute and said, "Size 8 I think." After the salesman returned with the shoes, this man picked up the shoes and his legs grew back. Check it out. Also Aimee Simple Mcpherson. She cleaned out LA's hospitals. Jesus is the same yesterday, today and forever. He hasn't stopped caring and he hasn't stopped healing. But I think some of his hands and feet might be stuck in front of their t.v. too much.|`|pGf4mIw9aa	No because a lot of Christians just override Jesus teaching with Paul's teaching.

Miracles DO happen today but we usually don't see them happening as much as when Jesus was walking on this earth.  He was healing every kind of disease and infirmity.  This is a rare thing.  A person would have to have many gifts of healing in order to perform like this.<br>  <br>  There are many healings at the Reinhard Bonnke crusades and some other evangelists also have these gifts.  There were many healed who were in wheel chairs at various Benny Hinn meetings.<br>  <br>  I have been healed various times and it WAS a miracle definitely, but I do need some miracles now.|`|ef4edd8f1c0d16fab298d474bf08b339aa	Because it has to do with the will of God. I think this is the calm before the storm. <br>  <br>  God didn't make us all healers, He sees when and who gets the abilities. If it a lack of faith, then He will teach us to work miracles when He wants us to do them.

Most stars of Hollywood tonight are totally against Christ, and Oprah Winfrey should be horsewhipped for putting her crap on the airwaves of her show to make ignorant Christian women viewers to throw out Jesus and God as we live in a new world (yeah, she subscribes to the New World Order) so she has to throw out Jesus.

ce060a29a8e7cbb3f7cdc004ec90adc3aa	Yes, Ms Crone, there ARE a lot of Evangelical Christians like that in the world. Thankfully, they aren't even a majority among Christianity and, as their methods become revealed in the light of day, they are diminishing in numbers. As the poster above me already noted, it is only a matter of time before they are ALL marginalized and subjected to their own methods of "persuasion". People like that are the Luddites of our time, they instinctively know that their ways are wrong and out of the bounds of what being a true Christian is all about. They are afraid of change, the change that means that they must interact with others who do not share their Faith in the way that they perceive it. As has also been noted, ALL Christians are NOT like those who abused you and MANY in fact, are wonderful people. These wonderful folks shouldn't be lumped in with the kind that abused you, unfairly. As for those who are like those who abused you and their posts about Wicca and your need to discover the TRUTH about Wicca, it is THEY who need to discover the REAL truth about Wicca. They have been misled and had the wool pulled over their eyes by unscrupulous leaders within their Religion. They are unable to see or understand that THEIR narrowly interpreted form of Religion IS ineed the most minority of minorities among ALL the world's Religions, even among Christians themselves. Their leaders KNOW the absolute truths about ALL of the Pagan Religions, for they have within the vast archives of all of the centers of their hierachys the REAL facts of our Religions as they actually existed and were practiced within the past. The Roman Catholic Church alone has enough material hidden and tucked away to allow ALL of the pagans of Europe AND the Amreicas to rebuild and re-establish our ways as originally practiced. If they truly wished goodwill toward others then they would release all of those documents and compete on an even footing. But, you see, they can't do that, for todo so would be to expose themselves for the very evil which they themselves have practiced over the past two thousand years. We KNOW this to be so, for if those documents fully supported their claims then they would have posted them for ALL to see. It is only human nature to expose data which supports a claim. The information is hidden because it disputes the claims of the early church and the curch of medeival times and shows that the leaders of the era WERE indeed evil and worng in their actions and methods. <br>  <br>  The people who behave the so badly towards you and others like us instinctively know this and are in complete denial of what their hearts tell them. They can behave in no other way because they ARE afraid to discover and KNOW the TRUTH. Until they face themselves, they will never be able tochange their methods and learn to accept that there ARE other ways to achieve oneness with the Divine.<br>  <br>  Brightest Blessings,<br>  Raji the Green Witch|`|Tgqji3lLaa	Lol,<br>  They are like a broken record...<br>  <br>  "Accept Jesus or else you will go to HELL!"<br>  "Accept Jesus or else you will go to HELL!!"<br>  "You have free will but I will try to force it into you!!"<br>  <br>  They fear what they don't know.<br>  Maybe the priest or whatever church guy in your area is telling the Christians that you are evil and trying to convert all your kids.<br>  <br>  I think.....

He tried to convert me.<br>  <br>  Seriously...|`|PMdBZIHVaa	My opinion.....?<br>  Insecurity.<br>  <br>  The very existence of someone who thinks differently, living a happy and fulfilled life, may indicate that they are mistaken, and that cannot be allowed.|`|GBjMqElBaa	They may truly feel they are being helpful, but you are finding them annoying. I am very willing to share my faith with others, and discuss things with those who are not Christian. But I also will back off if a person does not want to talk about it. <br>  I think you may know why they want you to convert. They feel that Christianity is the only way to have a pleasant after-life. <br>  I suspect that you did not have a very good experience when Christianity was forced on you. It is unfortunate that it went that way.<br>  But it seems you are old enough to make your own decision on things, and won't let it be forced on you.<br>  Being it was forced before, you may not have been able to look at it objectively. "Forced" conversion is rarely a true conversion of the heart, and only builds extream resentment. I am sorry you had to experience that.  But if you are still angry about it, or the people coming around are being very obnoxious about it, you still won't want to check it out.Please understand that Christianity (the biblical teachings of Christ) is not the same as some of the behaviors of SOME Christians. Just like there may be some nice Wiccans and some real turkeys.<br>  Yes, I am a Christian. I hope you eventually check Christianity out again. But I won't beat you in the head with it. <br>  If (and I know this is a big if) you should want to consider Christianity, there are people willing to NICELY explain it.

3mDvjCa8aa	Of course. The idea of marrying your partner just because you love each other is a new one. Marriage mostly had to do with property, status, and tradition, so it's no surprise polygamy was allowed.<br>  <br>  It is funny considering their battle against gay's rights to marry. "Marriage is defined as one man and one woman". Not according to your book people---marriage is defined as one man and as many women as he can get his hands on.|`|ehBPus3Zaa	God first put Adam and Eve together and said a man should leave his mother and father and cling to his wife. She was to be his helpmate. He allowed multi marriages later because He was making allowance for us to be able to live our lives easier to follow Him. But it usually caused more trouble between man and his relationships, so He changed it. He instigated that we marry one person, but allowed Moses to give out a decree of divorce if the people couldn't stay with the person that they married for Biblical reasons of adultery etc.  <br>  <br>  God first allowed incest too but he saw what it was doing to us, the gene pool wasn't tainted like it is today. So He changed that too. He is God so He doesn't really need a reason for changing things, like we think in our human minds. <br>  <br>  He first required sacrifices to show that we were living for God by faith. But after Jesus came to earth, He did so to do away with the necessity of those sacrifices because HE became the sacrifice to cover all sins, and redeem us once and for all from the curse of sin.|`|UinOWcMUaa	While Solomon did dis-obey God and had multiple wives...<br>  <br>  No God didn't allow it -- if you read the whole verse it states --4And he answered and said unto them, Have ye not read, that he which made them at the beginning made them male and female, <br>  <br>   5And said, For this cause shall a man leave father and mother, and shall cleave to his wife: and they twain shall be one flesh?<br>  <br>  Have you no undestanding of what you read ?|`|9ed79b2c402a7fe054faaa860538c607aa	Just because the people in the Bible had multiple wives, does not mean it is ok.

Maybe those sites are mormon ones; they usually say they are just another christian church, even though they are off-gospel in quite a few significant ways.<br>  <br>  The divorce rates are high because of 1960s libertarianism - "Im going to do what feels right for me, and if its not what I want and is not pleasing me, Im going to leave". "Why I should bother with marriage, it ties me up."

The Bible chronicles history , what happened. such as when Lot raped his two daughters in that cave... The Bible does not say this is a "good" thing, only that it happened. (Lot thought there were no more men to make babies with his daughters? or something? wacky... ) I can find more twisted scripture if you like... (search YA for "why don't Christian women wear head scarfs, as it says in their Christian Bible?" (the answer is The New Covenant, as you mentioned, Jesus comes to fulfill, but there is a new way, and upgraded version... you can still follow the old laws, but... why not simply accept Jesus as your Savior and stop the animal sacrifices?. etc. etc.) Here's an agrument to support homosexuality by Old Testament scripture quotes. (talk about twisted... Bible quotes for your own agenda.) I don't support these twisted Bible quotes, I am merely listing it for your own observation, OK? Morals are based on what a group (society) generally accepts as right or wrong (sinful, etc.). Most people would choose to have their car stolen instead of their life... So, there are even various degrees of "sin" or "wrong". Anyway, my chosen group of people are Catholic. I'd rather hang out with my dear old Catholic Grandmother than my hot sexy (non existant) lesbian friends.  Sorry, lesbians. I love ya, but you will grow old someday, and no longer be sexy (to me.) . but you can hang out with each other. I prefer not to frighten my dear old Grandmother.

NLinPsyhaa	Apparently so. It just shows the moral breakdown of society that ANY sex is o.k. as long as it doesn't affect them personally. Sex outside of marriage between one man and one woman is motivated from a completely selfish desire for gratification. And what ever the consequences are will be looked over by acceptance of it by society until it degrades so far that people ask what happened. <br>   Keep up the good fight and God bless.|`|dcDY9pJeaa	I'll take a crack at this question,<br>  <br>  brother and sister - none of my business<br>  <br>  two teens - none of my business<br>  <br>  taxpayer abortion - i'm against it, let people pay for their own abortion, i'm pro-choice but don't see why tax payer dollars should fund abortion<br>  <br>  sex education in the public schools - damn right you better be teaching about condoms <br>  <br>  homosexual relations - none of my business<br>  <br>  hope this answers your questions|`|A9vvZ6eUaa	Thank god we do not use religious text as a guide to sexuality of what is moral and immoral.

Does that include incest?|`|bMJ0AYI1aa	threesomes with hot women.|`|5tMCDu8gaa	First of all, you made up your own definition. The definition I would give is "Safe, sane, consensual." Invented for the kinky crowd, but very useful for ANYONE who has sex.<br>  <br>  "Safe" - prevents physical harm, and also implies the use of safer sex measures, like condoms. "Sane" - happens between people who are of sound mind and know what they are getting into. "Consensual" - happens between consenting people, who are defined as adult human beings. We can exclude children because of the "sane" clause (children cannot intellectually understand what consent means), and we can exclude animals because they cannot communicate with humans to offer their consent.<br>  <br>  So, this definition drastically reduces unintended pregnancies and STD's. I can prove this by using Europe as my example. They have done what I propose, and their STD rates are 1/4th of America's, and teen pregnancy is practically non-existent.<br>  <br>  It also eliminates the possibility of pedophilia and bestiality as acceptable sexual acts, due to consent.<br>  <br>  And as far as homosexuality, well, you're a homophobe. And that's your problem.<br>  <br>  "If a adult brother and sister consented to sex, would it matter if it hurt there parents?"<br>  <br>  I'd be fine with that. Their parents' reactions are no more critical to their personal morality than parents who disown their kids for being gay. OTHER PEOPLE'S problems are theirs - not yours. Incest would not rise under my definition because most people are genetically programmed to avoid incest. Exceptions to this rule will always exist, but they will not rise.<br>  <br>  "If 2 teens engaged in sex and had a un-wanted baby and threw it in the dumpster, or aborted it or abused the baby...Does that not hurt the baby society?"<br>  <br>  This would be solved almost entirely by the "safe" clause. The problem in America is that people like YOU are preventing children and teens from getting adequate sex education. So if you think the teen pregnancy rate is too high, why are you preventing us from lowering it?|`|AA11502346	I wholeheartedly agree with you.  The only sex that God approves of is sex within a heterosexual marriage.<br>  <br>  Now, individuals with homosexual tendencies are okay....as long as they do not act on their feelings OR have fantasies.   Likewise, unmarried heterosexuals are okay as long as they do not fornicate or fantasize.<br>  <br>  But that does not mean that we as Christians should go on our high horses and act self-righteous.  There are Christians who do have pre-martial sex and other kind of sins.

The only thing taught at public schools is abstinence.<br>  <br>  2. 2 TEENS, is not two consenting adults.<br>  <br>  3. Abortion is okay because it is done before the baby is born.<br>  <br>  4. Homophobes use the same excuses against homosexuality that racists used to use against interracial sex & marriage.<br>  <br>  5. A brother and sister having sex can create an extremely mutated offspring, and yes, it does matter when parents are hurt by that.<br>  <br>  6. There are all kinds of morals in the bible that people don't listen to, like stoning people to death and owning slaves.<br>  <br>  7. Consensual sex can hurt people, like in the case of masochists.<br>  <br>  8. As long as it is consensual for both (or all in case of 3ways and orgies) parties throughout the entire act of sex without causing too many consequences, it is okay.<br>  <br>  9. Too many consequences=affecting people around you in a very negative way.|`|c1anFbMaaa	"Is this your idea of Consentual Sex that hurts no-one?"<br>  <br>  What if a single man and woman **** and another girl is jealous?

Most interestingly, it's pointed out that teens who say they seek counsel from scripture less often use condoms when having sex, whereas teens who counsel with their parents more often use condoms.<br>  Interestingly, it's also a well known fact that evangelicals have the highest divorce rate.  All you have to do is go to google.com and enter as your research terms "divorce rate among conservative christians" and you'll get tons of hits.  You can do the same thing about the evangelical teen pregnancies.  Worth keeping in mind that Sarah Palin's seventeen-year-old daughter is pregnant.  I don't think anyone would suggest that she was raised in a liberal environment.|`|5RH9Osdsaa	You are lumping too much into one question.<br>  <br>  Homosexuality is not wrong.  People are born with or develop their sexual orientation early in life.  If the Bible condemns it (and that is questionable) it is because the authors of the Bible were ignorant on the true nature of sexual orientation and lived in a heterosexist environment.<br>  <br>  Abortion is not a question of sexuality, but rather a question of when life begins.  It is true that some may use the option of abortion to make sex okay, but that does not make the issue itself inherently based on sex.  You seem to believe that life begins at conception and that is fine, but there are other opinions out there.<br>  <br>  The Bible actually commands incest before it bans it.  Incest would have been necessary with Adam and Eve's offspring as well as Noah's offspring or the world would not have been repopulated.  That said, I don't think brothers and sisters should have sexual relations with each other, however, if they are consenting adults it is none of my business.<br>  <br>  I suggest you focus on your own relations and leave others to theirs.|`|OeAfpIZAaa	Morals do not come from your Bible.<br>  <br>  It is a result of social evolution and morals were prevalent before the Hebrew people.<br>  <br>  In regards to my opinion, consensual sex is fine, but inter-family-sex does sound a little Freudian.<br>  <br>  "f 2 teens engaged in sex and had a un-wanted baby and threw it in the dumpster, or aborted it or abused the baby...Does that not hurt the baby society?"<br>  <br>  DO YOU THINK I'M SOME KIND OF PSYCHO? Seriously, just because I don't subscribe to YOUR religion, doesn't make me insane. I'm Pro-Life, by the way.<br>  <br>  Edit: Why don't you look at them yourself? Christians are overrepresented in all of those statistics!|`|liGEQEz4aa	It sounds to me like you're so angry about so many different things that I can't really tell exactly what your question is....Biblical sex is sex between married people.  The Bible speaks very highly of that and says married people should not deny each other except for a season for intensified prayer.  Sex within marriage is a great blessing and to be enjoyed.  That's what I believe in because I'm a Christian.  Any other kind of sex is harmful whether or not anyone realizes it's harmful.  Even if it is not harmful in any other way, which is doubtful, it is harmful spiritually to have sex outside marriage.  It's true that many many many people engage in sexual acts outside marriage and believe that's OK.  I am not responsible for their decisions; they are and whether they know it or not, someday they will have to give an account for the damage to their souls they are doing, whether or not parents or sibling, or aborted babies are involved.  Personal sin is still harmful to the people practicing it, whether that's perceived or not.  Not everyone has the spiritual discernment to perceive the spiritual effects of sin on the soul.  Does that mean it doesn't exist? Of course not.  A person can have malaria, and if they don't know they have it, it doesn't mean they don't have it.  It just means they will not know how to heal themselves from the illness.  A person who doesn't know the spiritual damage to his or her soul that comes from sexual acts outside marriage just doesn't know how to heal his or her soul of the spiritual damage.  It doesn't mean the damage isn't there.|`|H7L66ynJaa	I stick by the old fashioned heterosexual sexual behavior.

I myself have a Doctorate of Divinity, however understand that "most" of these Doctorates are "honorary" they are given as recognition of dedication to the ministry that provides the doctorate. In such instances it is not required nor expected that the person be referred to as "Doctor". <br>  If however the person has an earned accredited Ph.D then to refer to them as Doctor is protocol and acknowledgment of their achievement. I have never requested or expected anyone to refer to me as Dr. and never would in fact I encourage them not to. I am a Pastor and therefore people refer to me as either pastor or preacher Tim, some people are put off by the Reverend title feeling that the person is setting themselves up as "higher" than others. This is not the case, when a person becomes a Minister and Rev. is placed as a title it is to show that persons reverence to God, not that they deserve reverence themselves. <br>  Self importance can be a very dangerous place to be, I would suggest you refer to this person in a way that makes you feel comfortable and if they have issue with that they need to take it up with God.

We don't keep the devil away by following his lies and superstitions!<br>  <br>  Instead, I urge you to turn to Jesus Christ and commit your life to Him. You see, when we turn our lives over to Christ some very important things happen to us. For one thing, He forgives all our sins, because He has already paid the penalty for our sins through His death on the cross. Think of it: He will forgive every sin you have ever committed!<br>  <br>  But something else very important happens to us: We become part of God's family forever! He adopts us as His own, and we become His sons and daughters. Nothing (including the devil) can ever change that, for "neither death nor life, neither angels nor demons, neither the present nor the future, nor any powers ... nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus our Lord" (Romans 8:38-39).

When one closely studies multiple religions, it not only helps you to understand about other people, cultures and beliefs, but it helps you to recognize the patterns and formulas that make up religions successful and allow them to spread.  The more you know and the more you learn about these things, the higher your likelihood of recognizing that belief in the supernatural is a self-replicating meme that can be likened to a vestigial organ.  You'll come out of it with a far greater understanding of society and the world and, far more likely than not, you'll be liberated from the snare of all of those irrational beliefs.  <br>  <br>  Have fun, and good luck!

Charles Taze Russell contrary to popular belief is not the founder of Jehovah's Witnesses. He along with other associates incorporated the Watchtower Bible and Tract Society in 1884 as the legal agency or corporation used by Jehovah's Witnesses. The religion of Jehovah's Witnesses is thousands of years old,at least 6,000 years. Abel and other faithful people before Jesus were called "witnesses" at  Hebrews 11 and 12. Jesus Christ is called the "Faithful and true Witness" at Revelation 3:14.  The God that was originally known to people such as Noah, Abraham, the Jews;all the way down to the time of Jesus and 1st century Christianity is known in the english language as"Jehovah". Jehovah's Witnesses are the last of a long line of witnesses of God.|`|mSQqEnuqaa	According to the Bible, the line of witnesses of Jehovah reaches back to faithful Abel.  Hebrews 11:4–12:1 says:  “By faith Abel offered God a sacrifice of greater worth than Cain .?.?. By faith Noah, after being given divine warning of things not yet beheld, showed godly fear .?.?. By faith Abraham, when he was called, obeyed in going out into a place he was destined to receive as an inheritance .?.?. By faith Moses, when grown up, refused to be called the son of the daughter of Pharaoh, choosing to be ill-treated with the people of God rather than to have the temporary enjoyment of sin .?.?. So, then, because we have so great a cloud of witnesses surrounding us, let us also put off every weight and the sin that easily entangles us, and let us run with endurance the race that is set before us.”<br>  With reference to Jesus Christ, the Bible states:  “These are the things that the Amen says, the faithful and true witness, the beginning of the creation by God.”  Of whom was he a witness?  He himself said that he made his Father’s name manifest.  He was the foremost witness of Jehovah.—Revelation 3:14; John 17:6.<br>  <br>  Interestingly, some of the Jews asked whether the activity of Jesus Christ represented “a new teaching.”  (Mark 1:27)  Later, some Greeks thought the apostle Paul was introducing a “new teaching.”  (Acts 17:19,?20) I t was new to the ears of those who were hearing it, but the important thing was that it was the truth, in full harmony with God’s Word.<br>  <br>  The modern-day history of Jehovah’s Witnesses began with the forming of a group for Bible study in Allegheny, Pennsylvania, U.S.A., in the early 1870’s.  At first they were known only as Bible Students, but in 1931 they adopted the Scriptural name Jehovah’s Witnesses. (Isaiah 43:10-12)  Their beliefs and practices are not new but are a restoration of first-century Christianity.<br>  <br>  In the early 1870’s, a rather inconspicuous Bible study group began in Allegheny, Pennsylvania, U.S.A., which is now a part of Pittsburgh. Charles Taze Russell was the prime mover of the group. In July 1879, the first issue of the magazine "Zion’s Watch Tower and Herald of Christ’s Presence" appeared.  By 1880 scores of congregations had spread from that one small Bible study into nearby states.  In 1881 Zion’s Watch Tower Tract Society was formed, and in 1884 it was incorporated, with Russell as president.  The Society’s name was later changed to Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society.  Many were witnessing from house to house offering Bible literature.  Fifty persons were doing this full time in 1888—now the average number worldwide is about 800,000.  By 1909 the work had become international, and the Society’s headquarters was moved to its present location in Brooklyn, New York.  Printed sermons were syndicated in newspapers, and by 1913 these were in four languages in 3,000 newspapers in the United States, Canada, and Europe.  Books, booklets, and tracts had been distributed by the hundreds of millions.  From the one small Bible study in Pennsylvania back in 1870, the Witnesses by the year 2008 grew to over 100,000 congregations worldwide.

He first got the idea stopping by a meeting with an SDA  bible group, but didn't totally go with ALL their ideas,  He started a group called bible students, then after his passing in 1914 a few years later in the 1930's under their new pastor/president  "Judge Rutheford"  they got it passed in the courts by naming themselves "Jehovah's Witnesses" as stated in Isaiah out of the bible.<br>  To know more about the full history of the Jehovah's Witnesses beginnings do a google search on Charles T. Russell & Judge rutheford.   but their main website gives what they do today at www.watchtower.org|`|aF4mFlJiaa	For a detailed answer the public library should have the book "Jehovah's Witnesses Proclaimers of God's Kingdom"<br>  <br>  In 1870, Charles Taze Russell and some of his associates formed a group for Bible study in Allegheny, Pennsylvania. They were not the first to discern many of the Bible truths that they embraced, but when studying, they made it a practice to check carefully all the scriptures on a given question. Their objective was, not to find proof texts for a preconceived idea, but to be sure that they drew conclusions that were in harmony with everything that the Bible said on the matter.<br>  <br>  A few others before them had realized that Christ would return invisibly as a spirit. Some had seen that the objective of Christ’s return was, not to burn up the earth and blot out all human life, but, rather, to bless all the families of the earth. There were even a few who had realized that the year 1914 would mark the end of the Gentile Times. But to the Bible Students associated with Brother Russell, these were more than points for theological discussion. They built their lives around these truths and gave them international publicity on a scale unprecedented in that era.<br>  <br>  Still, they needed to keep on the watch. Why? As an example, although they knew that 1914 was marked by Bible prophecy, they did not know for sure just what would happen in that year. This presented them with a test. In The Watch Tower of November 1, 1914, Brother Russell wrote: “Let us remember that we are in a testing season. .?.?. If there is any reason that would lead any to let go of the Lord and His Truth and to cease sacrificing for the Lord’s Cause, then it is not merely the love of God in the heart which has prompted interest in the Lord, but something else; probably a hoping that the time was short; the consecration was only for a certain time.”<br>  <br>  Some abandoned Jehovah’s service back then. But A.?H.?Macmillan was one who did not. Years later, he candidly acknowledged: “Sometimes our expectations for a certain date were more than what the Scriptures warranted.” What helped him to maintain spiritual balance? He realized, as he said, that “when those expectations went unfulfilled, that did not change God’s purposes.” He added: “I learned that we should admit our mistakes and continue searching God’s Word for more enlightenment.” Humbly, those early Bible Students let God’s Word readjust their outlook.—2?Timothy 3:16,?17.<br>  <br>  During the years that followed, their need to keep on the watch did not lessen. They knew, of course, that Christians were to be no part of the world. (John 17:14; James 4:4) In harmony with that, they did not join with Christendom in endorsing the League of Nations as a political expression of God’s Kingdom. But it was not until 1939 that they saw clearly the issue of Christian neutrality.—See The Watchtower, November 1, 1939.<br>  <br>  They never had a clergy class, although some elective elders felt that preaching in the congregation was all that should be expected of them. However, with a keen desire to conform to the Scriptures, the organization reviewed the role of the elders in the light of the Scriptures, doing so again and again through the columns of The Watchtower. Organizational changes were made in harmony with what the Scriptures indicated.<br>  <br>  The entire organization was being geared up to accomplish fully the work that God’s Word had outlined for our day. (Isaiah 61:1,?2) To what extent was the good news to be proclaimed in our day? Jesus said: “In all the nations the good news has to be preached first.” (Mark 13:10) From a human standpoint, that task has often appeared impossible.<br>  <br>  Yet, with confidence in Christ as Head of the congregation, the faithful and discreet slave class has moved ahead. (Matthew 24:45) Faithfully and firmly they have pointed out to Jehovah’s people the work to be done. From 1919 onward, increased emphasis was given to the field ministry. For many, it was not easy to go from house to house and talk to strangers. (Acts 20:20) But study articles such as “Blessed Are the Fearless” (in 1919) and “Be of Good Courage” (in 1921) helped some to get started in the work, with trust in Jehovah.<br>  <br>  The appeal, in 1922, to “advertise, advertise, advertise, the King and his kingdom” provided needed stimulus to give this work deserved prominence. From 1927 on, elders who did not accept that Scriptural responsibility were removed. At about that time, the Society’s traveling representatives, the pilgrims, were assigned to be regional service directors, giving personal instruction to publishers in the field service. Not everyone could pioneer, but on weekends many were devoting full days to the service, starting early in the morning, stopping just briefly to eat a sandwich, and then continuing in the service till late in the afternoon. Those were significant times of theocratic development, and we benefit greatly by reviewing the way in which Jehovah was leading his people. He continues to do so. W
HGPxEhMSaa	Like IshVarLa... I too am unsure how to answer this question.<br>  If by religious you mean our firm in beliefs in what we learn from the bible or our conviction to serve Jehovah in the way his son Jesus showed us or our close relationship to our creator or conviction to live our lives in a way that pleases Jehovah or our strong faith , then yes I guess we are very religious.<br>   I have never really thought of Jehovah's Witnesses as religious just faithful servants of the one & only true God|`|AA11025703	Not quite sure what to say.<br>  <br>  I am a Christian, one of Jehovah's Witnesses.<br>  <br>  Being a Christian is something that should/does permiate every aspect of our lives.|`|303F69Woaa	They are the only ones who accept the Bible in whole as the inspired word of God and actually live by that word. They are the only ones who prove themselves as the true disciples of Jesus Christ by having love for their neighbors, having love among themselves worldwide, being no part of the world, and not taking up arms(weapons). They preach just as Jesus and his Apostles did and they exercise faith in Jesus Christ as the only means of salvation provided by God for the saving of fallen mankind and in the kingdom of God as the only solution to all mankinds problems. And they are relentlessly persecuted by the world including other religions and their clergy just as Jesus said his disciples would be. Just look at how people speak out against them in here without really even knowing anything about them except the rumors they hear. Satan is trying to obstruct them at every turn. They have stood the test of persecution to the point that nations tried to eradicate them and the nations failed.

3BHPJweWaa	Nope.<br>  <br>  i'd be interested in hearing what they were.<br>  <br>  *After* i heard them i *might* be sceptical -- & maybe not.<br>  <br>  When i *do* "dismiss" people (for it's not like i never have) i tend to feel kinda bad about it, afterwards.<br>  <br>  Perhaps, in my 20's & 30's i would've been prone to a larger degree of scepticism about a lot of these things.  But, a certain number of experiences of my own... & experiences of family & friends that i *trust* have made me less hasty to "jump to judgment", dismissively,  in these areas.  (i realize there are lots of liars... charlatans out there, capitali$ing on the supernatural... & all manner of delusional sorts). <br>  <br>  ESP is a *reality* -- even tho scientists can't measure it & forecast it in    their laboratories... & its existence is proven by people's genuine personal experiences of it (as with *love*).  <br>  <br>  Can it be proven -- in any scientific laboratory -- that love actually *exists*?  (Or hate... or greed, for that matter...  or compassion?)<br>  <br>  One of my sisters was very *disturbed* for a period of time because of a precognitive glimpse she'd received that she *hadn't* acted upon -- where it would've saved a man's life.<br>  <br>  A car was approaching to pass in front of her house on the country road she lived on.  She received a precognitive glimpse of the immediate future where there was a dreadful accident, & the man driving that car died as a result.  She *barely* had time to rush towards the road, wave her arms frantically & scream at that driver to "STOP!" -- to *possibly* stop him.  Her next thought, however, was, "He'll just think I'm crazy and won't believe me" & the one after that was a flash of *doubt* over whether what she'd "seen" was even accurate or not... so she hesitated too long & didn't move on it.<br>  <br>  Not very long after that she heard the horrendous *CRASH!* -- a quarter mile further along the road, at the crossroads.  Her precognitive glimpse had been *accurate* & the guy will killed, immediately, in that car crash.  (The other person survived.)  Sis felt horrible about it.  She *knew* the Divine had given her the information necessary at the very moment needed to have saved that man's life -- but she'd doubted & hadn't acted on it.  She realized that if he'd thought she was a delusional "crazy woman" -- so what?!  He would've still been *alive*.<br>  <br>  My dad knew -- the very moment!, he said -- when his bulldozer was being stolen, from where it was parked on a job 60 miles north.  My brother, Alvin, still remembers that time -- when Dad was so desperate to get up there.  The caterpillar *was* gone.  It *had* been stolen.  There's no way of "proving" that his sensing of the timing was accurate to the moment -- but i see no reason to *doubt* it.  He spent days seaching the nearby areas & was finally able to locate it, where it had been hidden, a few miles away.<br>  <br>  A late friend of mine had a visionary glimpse of the 2nd man she lived much of her life with -- about 20 years before she ever met him in the flesh, & *before* she married her first & only husband!  She insisted that Lenny was a "white Russian warlock" & *he'd* sent that Vision of him back thru time so that she'd know of his existence *before* she married the man who would later divorce her (wanting a younger replacement).  i don't doubt her "witchey" powers a bit!  She warned her sceptical son-in-law he'd better put those young colts in the barn or in the corral beside the barn that evening -- or he'd lose them to that cougar that had been prowling around, lately -- because she'd "seen" it.  He'd been keeping the colts in a corral on the ranch quite far removed from the house & barn area.  Hank grumbled & grumped at her, telling her he didn't *believe* any of that stuff -- but *did* move the colts.  Next morning -- going to that further-back corral -- the cougar tracks were *there*!<br>  <br>  You can be *sure* that when i or my immediate family have a "warning dream" about something fatal (or extremely unpleasant) happening to us, we give it *full heed* & change our plans accordingly.  (i've had one "near miss" that-a-ways that i could spell out in detail that convinced me, thoroughly, that precognitive dreams are *not* to be lightly dismissed.)<br>  <br>  *<br>  <br>  Well, i rambled on, for another 808 words, sharing some of my own personal experiences -- but they ran the wordage up to 1564 words, totally -- which won't go thru.  So, cutting-back to the amount that *will* go thru, i'll end it here.<br>  <br>  If anyone reading this *really* wants to read them, e-mail me personally... providing an e-mail address of your own that will accommodate that many further words, & i'll pass 'em along to you.  This Yahoo Answers e-mail, off our profiles, only allows 1500 *characters* -- which would require several brief installments to convey a further 808 words.<br>  <br>  ~~winsome|`|krRyKGWtaa	not necessarily. there are some people who Truly believe that they have special powers. One of my prof. in college for example thought that she had the power of telekinesis. One of my friends believed that she could see the future. Another person I know saw her mother in a dream telling her to get out of her house (her mother was dead) she followed her mother's instructions and went to a motel about five minutes after she got there a plane crashed in her backyard. This could have been a case of intuition or something but still this and other supernatural experiences are not really a question of insanity or anything like that its really just that some people's brains are more developed than others which gives them more ability to do things that others can't so personally, I wouldn't be that quick to dismiss you. Of course it really all depends on what supernatural experiences you say you've had. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|b32jC7pGaa	Your report of supernatural experiences - as an individual - carries no weight with the overall society.

If people who profess to believe in supernatural experiences were all to be sent to mental health professionals, the system would not be able to accommodate them all.  Everybody who goes to church or is part of a religious organization would have to be put under some kind of treatment.  Because many pillars of the community are active in religious organizations, even if it is mainly for reasons of advancement opportunities in society, it is unlikely that those who profess to believe in the supernatural would be stigmatized and abused by being forcefully subjected to "mental health" treatment.<br>  <br>  On a different note, I would have to say that I have had experiences that are unexplainable and have left me wondering.  Other users of yahoo! Answers have submitted some of theirs.  For example, one user said he saw a jogger on a road and then encountered the very same jogger further up the road.  Come to think of it, I think I might have had the same experience, only the jogger was out on a day when I swear the temperature outside must have been 40 below zero, unfit for human activity of that nature.  Other people apparently had asked him if he wanted a ride, and he refused it.<br>  <br>  I usually dismiss these experiences as the consequence of lack of sleep, inattentiveness or a vivid imagination on my part.<br>  <br>  I actually do try to keep my feet on the ground and measure events objectively and even empirically as much as possible.  However, sometimes the challenge becomes impossible and overwhelming.<br>  <br>  "I can believe anything, provided that it is quite incredible,"<br>              - Oscar Wilde|`|vxSXsn59aa	Yes, I would.

If for example you claimed to be able to guess an unknown card in someone's hand 80% of the time,  I would certainly require a basic demonstration.  If you claimed to be able to levitate, I would expect a rather more controlled and rigorous demonstration to protect against falsification - since all such claims have been shown to rely on artificial means, but some of them have been very ingenious.  If you claimed to be able to raise the dead and heal the blind by spit and mud, I'd essentially write you off as hallucinatory without extremely rigorous and very carefully controlled medically supervised repeat tests.<br>  <br>  Proof of extraordinary claims is always required.

liGEQEz4aa	Good question.  Technically, no.  But God is not a technician....Marriage is for salvation, and one is to marry a spiritual helpmate...not just a financial or emotional helpmate....That means the best marriage is to somebody who has the spiritual insight and strength to help us overcome our weakness.  If both people fall to the same weakness: carnal temptation, then the marriage will not serve the purpose of salvation, and technically will not be blessed.  There is actually a canon that forbids those who fall into carnal sin from marriage to each other.  That's the rationale, and technicality...  But as mentioned, God cannot be reduced to laws and technicalities.  God knows the heart.  If both people truly repent and overcome that weakness, or if one is able to repent and then help the other overcome that weakness, then God forgives, the two are made new, and God can bless.  It would be an exception, and not the rule....and it seems like there could be a lifelong temptation to fall back into carnal wrongs, and for that reason, trust would always be in question...not a really good basis for starting a marriage.  Marriage is hard enough under the best of circumstances; best not to add heavy duty temptation and trust questions.  Better to wait for someone who does not have this as a spiritual temptation, or who can help the weaker one overcome the temptation.  That's what a spiritual helpmate is for.  Really good question.|`|XJ9oSR2daa	God is a God of forgiveness if repentence occurs.<br>  <br>  If the person stops the sex and faithfully waits till marriage and repents, why wouldn't God forgive?|`|SbN2cXE5aa	If they have prayed for forgiveness, yes.

The marriage will be blessed if you continue to live your life for Him. And build your marriage on Jesus Christ. Pray everyday that He will help you to keep away from sins, and read your Bible so you will know how God wants you to live. And develop a personal relationship with Him, as well as keeping Christ in your marriage.|`|bRLCxmP6aa	No atheists? Oh, I'm sorry - I thought this was an open forum.

Derived from Plato's philosophy. Read about the "First Mover" or "Unmoved Mover".

God created us, and once we die we will be judged for our deeds. You either go to Hell or heavan and thats that. Muslim Faith explains many things to you about our world and why we are here. Did you know that The Quran(muslim book) wich is written from hundreds of thousands of years ago,by god sent down to the prophet.says whats going to happen in the future, and it ALL came true.

Science can do great things in answering things.  It is a form of analyzing data.  Science will never be able to disprove God.

I would like you do do this without referring to any theories, using only data.  What, you wouldn't be able to do this.  If the theory that the atom was electrically charged never came into play, we would have gone no further in the pursuit.  We did though.

I felt that we were free to live as we pleased and do as I wished without any repercussions as long as I was a good person and didn’t hurt anyone I was ok and didn’t need a God after all if there was a God why would he send me to hell if I didn’t hurt anybody (sound familiar) but one day came and as I was thinking of the love of my life my then two year old child in all my unbelieving wisdom I had an epiphany: how can a  man and a woman  create a life? I understand the science but how and why does it happen? The cells have no conscience thought, sense of smell, eyesight, or any form of guidance to speak of and when they do meet how can they join and make a life. It was at this point I realized that I can’t create anything and no human can, sure we can manipulate what is already there but we can’t create a new object from nothing. It goes all the way back to the big bang if you believe in it before the explosion where the matter comes from? What or who created it I believe that all of us atheist and believers alike can agree that creation requires intelligence now here is the hard one to wrap your brain around for any thing to exist something intelligent had to always exist or nothing would exist. On this very thought every lie that I held on to as an atheist came tumbling down and Gods fingered landed on every thing and I realized that God is very real and since he is real I need to live like my true father would have me live. Because if he created me then he is my true father and he is yours also. <br>  Since then I have come to find that even by the most unbelieving scientist, historians, and scholars the Holy Bible is held as the most historically accurate document on the face of the earth. An equally interesting fact is that the overwhelming majority of atheist has an extremely hardened opinion of the Holy Bible and Christianity but has never read the first page. I fell in this category I now realize the conflict lies in the fact that if we don’t want to know that we should have rules in our life and we should be held accountable for our actions.  As the good book says: <br>  <br>  1Jo:2:15: Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world. If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him.<br>  1Jo:2:16: For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, is not of the Father, but is of the world.<br>  1Jo:2:17: And the world passeth away, and the lust thereof: but he that doeth the will of God abideth for ever.    <br>  <br>  If you have any trouble finding anything in the bible or if you have questions about the bible please email me at straightisthepath@yahoo.com or look me up on myspace search for me with the same email address straightisthepath@yahoo.com I hope I can help thanks and God bless|`|gRtmFa1maa	Relgion isn't fact based, it's faith based....so you don't need proof of anything.

But the fact that there is a creator is evident. You didn't create yourself nor your parents nor theirs nor as far back as you can go and even if you believe in evolution than something still created the world, the universe, and even if you believe in the big bang theory than something created that. If you even believe in string theory, M theory and the 11th dimension than you have to admit or universe being created out of two others collision still has a creator because those universes were also made by something. Therefor I say there is a creator and I call him God, and what he is I do not know other than I have known him in spirit, and that's enough for me. You could spend your life and trying to understand something beyond or comprehension or you can choose to believe what you want and make the best out of your life.<br>  <br>  By the way, Science can NEVER prove anything with absolute 100% certainty, because scientific thought is subject to change.|`|9ed79b2c402a7fe054faaa860538c607aa	If this is true, then why can you not disprove Christianity? If it is man-made, then why would people have visions of angels in their dreams? How could God affect so many people (billions of people) if He were not real? Roman mythology has died out, but Christianity is still alive, and strong, because God is real, and He loves us all.<br>  <br>  By the way, I do not need proof to believe in God, I have faith, and with this faith, I have seen God's love. I do not need science to prove God is real, because I already know He is real.|`|283JrACKaa	In my opinion, ( I don`t want to argue with others who do) but I personaly don`t belive in god. We have no evidence at all but I hope we will be able to find it out in the future.|`|YupMCYHlaa	I believe in God, but I think you're right.  People have always had a need to believe in something.  It's wired into us, it's part of human nature.<br>  <br>  But once you say you believe in God, you can't really say much more than that. Nobody knows much about God, so they make stuff up to fill the gaps. Or they cling to scriptures, insisting that it is not just something written by people based on their beliefs, but a 'revelation' from God.<br>  <br>  And you're right, some people love mystery and love to speculate and wonder.  But others just HAVE to have the answers so they go with a religion that promises them all the answers, so they don't have to doubt, or question, or wonder.<br>  <br>  If God exists, then it seems obvious that it's his deliberate plan to hide from  us, to leave us alone to figure stuff out for ourselves.  I mean, he could just appear in the sky and tell us stuff, and then there would be no question about it.  "Hey, dummy, slavery is WRONG!  Didn't you hear God last Tuesday?"<br>  <br>  Instead he designed us with a strong curiosity about our environment, and the intellectual ability to learn about it.  We even have written language so we can accumulate knowledge from generation to generation!  He gives us the curiosity and he leaves us alone, and we have made some really considerable progress, if you think about it.<br>  <br>  I think it's a big mistake to think some books, thousands of  years old, are the limit of human knowledge.   Those books were written in ancient times based on the knowledge people had at the time.  But we know now that there are more than 5 planets.  We know the earth is not the center of the universe.  And that all disease is not caused by demons.  It's useless, and kind of dumb, to insist that 2000 year old knowledge trumps new scientific discoveries.|`|LuN1unJ3aa	I'm not sure that man created god, or man created the idea that man created god.<br>  <br>  Personally, I think it is the latter as some _thing_ or _force_ out there is the reason we are all alive. Whether you define that thing or force by the theories of science or the beliefs of religion or spirituality makes no difference.<br>  <br>  Something started it all. And for those who reject the notion of deity, it is easier to make the claim that man created a god to fulfill a need.<br>  <br>  It is a nice theory if God doesn't exist.<br>  <br>  Personal experience, which cannot be conveyed to another who has not had that experience, testifies otherwise.|`|w4ksNNJWaa	Only the ignorant and weak would deny solid scientific proof that god doesn't exist. Though it is a weak "if" because by the time we have this technology most of the world will of become atheist, not to mention the fact that this technology is unimaginable for us today. Your point has been made many a time that Humans created the idea of God to explain as people are scared of what they don't know, fear makes people weak, and people strive to be strong, it sound's very logical though there is always the fact that we don't know whether or not there is a god as it is all just belief.<br>  <br>  <br>  (In Regards to Other Answers) <br>  I think the funniest thing about all of these questions regarding god is real or not, is the fact that some of people saying there is a god are quite disrespective of the opposite view, they sound rather unintellectual and some of them are quite disregarding that there is even the possibility that God doesnt exist, a prime example being Lolly Poop...|`|AA11124121	man made the buildings that reach for the sky<br>  man made the motorcar and learned how to fly<br>  <br>  he didn't make flowers and he didn't make trees<br>  he didn't make you and he didn't make me|`|AA10398522	I pretty much believe that us well.

There was a time when "God" was the answer for why the wind blew and what made the waves lap at the shore.  "God" was the answer to what moved the sun and moon across the sky and how a woman came to be pregnant.  "God" has probably been used to answer all of existence's puzzles whose answer, at least at one time, was "nobody knows."  <br>  <br>  I do say that this is a GOOD challenge because scientists the world over are actively seeking answers to the question.  Despite how long it takes to discover the answer (or even if we are never able to) just the PURSUIT of truth is a good thing.<br>  <br>  One must admit, we cannot currently say with 100% certainty that "God DIDN'T do it," thereby making the challenge at least semi-valid (albeit weak.)  However, based on the track record of things that HAVE been attributed to the direct hand of God that we now know to be not only completely natural but fully and accurately predictable, we CAN say that, based on all corollary evidence, the likelihood of any kind of supernatural cause for anything, including the beginnings of life, the universe and everything, nears absolute 0.|`|b32jC7pGaa	I am an atheist.

God is at work in the world—but so is the devil, and we can't blame God for everything that happens to us.<br>  <br>  Sometimes, in fact, we are responsible for the bad things that happen to us, because we make wrong decisions or deliberately turn our backs on God and His will for our lives. The Bible says, "When tempted, no one should say, 'God is tempting me.' For ... each one is tempted when, by his own evil desire, he is dragged away and enticed" (James 1:13-14).<br>  <br>  But the most important thing I can tell you is this: No matter what happens to us, God is able to take it and use it for our good—if we let Him. Joseph's brothers sold him into slavery and told his father he was dead—but instead of being bitter or depressed, Joseph put his life into God's hands. As a result, God used him to save Egypt from famine. Later, after the brothers were reunited, Joseph told them, "You intended to harm me, but God intended it for good" (Genesis 50:20).<br>  <br>  Begin by giving your life to Christ and asking Him to come into your heart. Then ask Him to give you the wisdom and strength you need to deal with your hard times. Most of all, ask Him to teach you through these experiences about His constant love. <br>  <br>  believer_in_jesus37421@yahoo.com|`|CrYc4TTSaa	I don't have a Bible answer, but I really do not think so.

Did I stumble into the atheist chat room or were you asking a serious question? If serious then try this statement I'm YHWH (stating He is a self existing God).  I am pure love.  Love is best when shared.  Let Me create Sons of God (which shall later be called Angels) & b/c I love, they must have freewill.  Freewill to abandon Me.  Being as I know all possible outcomes at any moment, about a 1/3 of them will reject Me even though they have lived in My glory.  That's why I already knew that I would create perfect temporary beings.  Again w/ freewill. I'll give them instruction on how to follow My will so that life is good for them.  They will choose to reject Me & bring sin upon themselves. (Sin means error, falling short of the mark.)  God's standard is perfection.  Humankind was created perfectly, then chose a lesser system where they would become their own gods, thus making them fall short of the Perfection mark.  Notice that Adam & Eve walked & talked w/ God in the garden.  Only perfection can be in the presence of God.  After their falling away, the next time God is seen is by Moses and then he's only allowed to look at Him after God passes by b/c His glory would be too great for Moses to handle. / But the "fall" was a problem I was aware of and made a way to bring them back to perfection.  They need a way back to Me.  Being transdimentional, I'll use some of my Holy Spirit to be come flesh & impregnate the pure blood line of Mary.  So Jesus was the 1st human to have the Holy Spirit be a part of Him.  Now it's His choice, like Adam to follow the teachings of his Father.  He can refuse.  In the garden of Gethsemane, knowing what was to come, He even asked His Father if it was possible that salvation can be some other way (asking if He might not have to drink from this cup). Jesus wanted people to be free from sin/error b/c no one is happy with a void in their life.  But He chose this road & was willing to walk it if this was the only way.  Perfection had to become sin so that the charge of guilt would not stick.  God never condemned us to sin, someone else made that choice for us.  Long B4 we were born.  Just like a woman makes a choice to abort her baby without asking consent of the child.  She sentences the child to death B4 it was born, the same as Adam & Eve chose for us before we were born.  God did not kill Himself.  The only begotten Son of God allowed Himself to feel death so that we would not ever have to face it completely.  Once His righteousness was seen in death, He could not be held there.  So He arose w/ the right to give all who ask, a piece of the Holy Spirit inside of themseselves to take root and grow in us just as it grew in Him.  Those without it are mortal, those with immortal Spirit in them, who love God, will only have to taste the death of the flesh, but may be raised in Spirit. / I find it odd that an atheist would subscribe to the trinity doctrine when there is no mention of such in the bible.  The closest verses that come near this only state that a person shall be baptized in the name of the the Father, the Son & the Holy Spirit, but there's no concluding remark that says b/c they are one in the same. Nor does 1 John 5:7 KJV "For there are three that bare record in heaven, the Father, the Word & the Holy Ghost: and these three are one."  The original Greek translates "Because there are three ones testifying:" And those 3 are clarified in the next verse "The Spirit the water and the blood: and these three agree in one." / Which talks about the blood of natural birth, water at baptisim (an action of identifying w/ the death & resuruction of Jesus), and then finally the Holy Spirit which we receive after Baptism.  That part of eternal life that is quickened into belivers.<br>  <br>  So yes, I too agree with your statement and it's absurdity.  Thanks for pointing that out for Christians who accept doctrines without further study to see if that's what was really taught in Scripture.

Why should I see him as God?<br>  <br>  Pasting a small part from the website. <br>  <br>  Visit the website to strengthen your faith in Jesus or to know more about Him.<br>  <br>  Jesus is God.<br>  <br>  1.Thomas calls Jesus God in John 20:28 (Note, Thomas addresses Jesus<br>  specifically.)<br>  2. Jesus is God in Heb. 1:8<br>  3. John the apostle states that Jesus was the Word which was God that became<br>  flesh (John 1:1-14)<br>  4. The phrase "Call upon the name of the LORD" (Hebrew, YHWH, i.e., Psalm<br>  116:4) used only of God on the OT, and translated into the Greek in the LXX as "Call upon the name of the LORD (greek, KURIOS)," applied to Jesus in the NT (1 Cor. 1:2) Jesus is God in flesh<br>  5. The apostle John says that Jesus was , "...calling God His own Father,<br>  making Himself equal to God," (John 5:18)<br>  6. Jesus said that He and the Father are One (John 10:30), that caused the Pharisees to<br>  claim that Jesus was making Himself out to be God.<br>  7. Jesus knew all things (John 21:17)<br>  8. Jesus knew all men (John 16:30)<br>  9. Jesus is everywhere (Matt. 28:20)<br>  10. Jesus Christ, dwells in you (Col. 1:27)<br>  11. Jesus is the exact representation of the Nature of God (Heb. 1:3)<br>  12. Jesus is eternal (Micah 5:1-2)<br>  13. Jesus gives eternal life (John 10:27-28)<br>  14. Jesus is our only Lord and Master (Jude 4)<br>  15. Jesus is called the Mighty God (Isaiah 9:6)<br>  16. Jesus is called the Mighty God (Isaiah 9:6) and "God" also be called the Mighty God in Isaiah 10:21<br>  17. Jesus is able to raise Himself from the dead (John 2:19-21)<br>  18. Jesus created all things (Col. 1:16-17), it is God who created all things by Himself (Isaiah 44:24)<br>  19. Jesus searches the hearts and minds of the people (Rev. 2:23)<br>  20. Jesus is worshiped (Matt. 2:2-11; Matt.14:33; Matt.28:9; John 9:35-38;<br>  Heb. 1:6) Only God can be worshipped (Matt. 4:10) (same Greek word for worship<br>  is used in each place.)<br>  21. In the OT God was seen (Exodus 6:2-3;Exodus 24:9-11; Num. 12:6-9; Acts7:2), yet no man can see God (Exodus 33:20; John 1:18). It was not the Father that was seen in the OT (John 6:46). Who, then were they seeing? See John 8:58.<br>  22. Jesus claimed the divine name, "I AM", for Himself in John 8:58 see<br>  Exodus 3:14.<br>  23. Jesus says you must honor him even as you honor the Father (John 5:23).<br>  24. Jesus gives life (John 5:21).<br>  25. Jesus bears witness of Himself (John 8:18;John 14:6).<br>  26. Jesus is the One who will judge you on judgement day (John 5:22-23). Only God can be the judge.<br>  27. Jesus forgives sins (Luke 5:20) (Luke 24:47,Acts 10:43) .Only God can forgive sins.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com</a>|`|9ed79b2c402a7fe054faaa860538c607aa	Nope, that is not how God created us. He created us without sin, until Satan decieved Adam and Eve, then they sinned against God, causing original sin. Plus, Jesus did not kill himyself, He was killed by the Romans, and Jews who thought He was a blasphemer, when He was actually the Son of God.|`|AA12346187	God  did not make such a statement  and it  sounds  crazy  when you Type  it like   that  .|`|AA10641825	Sounds pretty good so far.<br>  <br>  By the way, I'm a monkey and I do discount baptisms.<br>  .|`|9d24eebc65f160389e6cd993dc745cd8aa	It's all nice and tidy.|`|89MKzLl3aa	It's from an idiot who has never read the bible.|`|f8mLpPXlaa	Good point! And now I'm going to convert to something else. That just doesn't make sense. And everything in life ought to make sense. Right? I don't understand quantum theory, maybe I should worship that. My pea brain can't wrap around a lot of stuff but it doesn't make it false.|`|5eSJpYbMaa	They should put that as a summary paragraph on the back cover of the Bible.<br>  <br>  <br>  Just to give readers the general idea of what the book is about.|`|AA11124121	A. Don't be ridiculous.<br>  B. Read it next time before exposing your narrow cranium.|`|564d359090a6d360bec9ee3849107a51aa	God did not make that statement. You are not speaking in the context that those events took place, and it is coming across as you mocking God.|`|LFWQiGYkaa	Creo quia absurdum?|`|biPAZ2TVaa	Nowhere near reality.|`|lcMWoe8xaa	That's been on the internet for a long while. But it's true, oh so true...|`|Johiu2cwaa	Sounds about right.
8QgF4xqkaa	From the Islamic point of view, you can choose to never go to a doctor and that would be fine but if you happen to go to a doctor and if the doctor tells you that you need to take a medicine (not just to save your life but even if it's just to maintain your health), then God expects you to follow the doctor's instructions.<br>  <br>  This is because this body you have is not yours initially and when you die it will return back to earth. Only your soul will stay.<br>  <br>  But in Islam everything is based on the intention you have.<br>  <br>  For example if you help someone with the intention to show off your wealth then that doesn't count.<br>  <br>  Now if your intention is to suicide through not taking medicine and not having security at home, then it won't count. you'll be accountable for this.<br>  <br>  All is about intention my friend.|`|XJ9oSR2daa	Depends on the circumstances.. If I am going to be a vegetable or something that can't function to the point I am functioning now, why not let me just go home? <br>  <br>  I don't believe its suicide to withhold things that might save me, because in the days before that, they didn't have them.<br>  <br>  Our promises aren't here in this world, thats what nonbelievers don't understand, we go home to be with our Saviour, who wouldn't want that?|`|LPCfOtiKaa	I think it depends on the situation.  If someone is going into major surgery and signs a DNR, I don't think it's equal to suicide at all. If someone signs a form that says if they go into a coma and they want to be taken off of life support after a week I don't think it's suicide either.  But there is a line. If a person loses a limb somehow and is bleeding to death but refuses medical treatment because they would rather die than live without that limb...yes that is suicide.|`|4WqvTAfmaa	My aunt, a devout Catholic of deep faith, was 96 two years ago. She told her best friend and confessor that she was ready to meet her Lord, and stoped taking blood pressure pills (which are artificial life support of a sort) and she lost her appetite (not unusual for a person who is dying) and then she just let nature take its course. <br>  <br>  Suicide?|`|q5lreoiWaa	If you do so just to die, yes it is suicidal.<br>  However, if you go against medical advice because you truly doubt that the treatment will save you, or you know it will prolong your suffering than No it is not suicidal.  I have recently confronted this in my own life.  <br>  Hope this helps, may God rain blessings on you this day.|`|qPzxKhrlaa	Possibly, but it very much depends on the situation. For instance, if I have Parkinson's and get so bad I can no longer eat, give me morphine and let me die. Yeah, a feeding tube would keep me alive, but for what? And is it suicide to choose a shorter, painless death over a long, painful, drawn out death? Either way, you're dead.|`|g4AAZRuxaa	No|`|B5umOqz2aa	.....or like Jesus simply saying that he wasn't the messiah
paYe9iHXaa	The bible is silent on rape?<br>  <br>  Judges 5:30 "They [soldiers of Israel] are only finding things to capture and divide, a girl or two for every soldier."<br>  <br>  Judges 21:17-18,20 "Israel must not lose one of its twelve tribes. We must find a way for the tribe of Benjamin to survive." "They told the Benjaminites, "Go and hide in the vineyards and watch. When the girls of Shiloh come out to dance during the festival, you come out of the vineyards. Each of you take a wife by force from among the girls and take her back to the territory of Benjamin with you."|`|aS9TDAOIaa	You err in several ways here.<br>  <br>  First, the Bible is not silent on rape. The book of Leviticus deals with it twice. Get your facts straight.<br>  <br>  Second, the fact that different societies or mankind as a whole can come up with moral ideals does not mean that God does not have a moral code of His own to enforce. <br>  <br>  Third, morality is one thing in one society, and another thing in another society. Morality is defined in many ways. <br>  <br>  Morality cannot be discussed as an absolute, even God's brand of morality.|`|CBUPymktaa	i think the main theme is that the laws show you what is destructive to you and the whole system ..|`|yj3GT7jOaa	Moral was first referred to as what was clean and unclean.  Disease control was the primary focus.  It was allowed for married people to engage in sex since the relationship was monogamous and would less likely spread and contagions.  The reverse would be true concerning sex outside of marriage when a source could not be detected or an accountability system was not present.  In reference to rape, the old testament has two chapter devoted to that subject.  Also, most any the chapters that are given to a woman's name in the old testament would give some reference to the subject as well.  None of the references would indicate that rape to be defined as acceptable behavior.  We are supposed to be free to obey all laws willingly rather than to be arbitrarily forced to do so.  The acceptance and understanding the consequences of what happens to us when we break the law generates the submissions we are supposed to have toward the law.  In the beginning the word was law, God became the law, and Jesus was the fulfilment of the law by allowing us to see it and gave the example of how to follow it.  Jesus changed not one part of the law.|`|9BeUbORtaa	Oooh, somebody discovered Euthyphro's Dilemma. <br>  <br>  Thankfully, St Thomas Aquinas discovered it first. I suggest you read him on this.|`|18be83adf26491424d29aa61ef0530d6aa	The bible is silent on rape?  Rape is a form of theft - taking what is yours under force.  Something at the expense of someone else.<br>  There is no 'perfect love' involved in 'rape'.  The heart of it is violence and selfishness.<br>  <br>  All the above are against what God would consider good.|`|NLinPsyhaa	Laws aren't moral. God is. The law only shows our immorality. The law doesn't convict, accuse, judge, or change the heart. So what is the law without a just law giver? We are all God's creation and have His word written on our hearts.|`|AA10641825	God did not know that chopping off a woman's hand is wrong.<br>  <br>  Deuteronomy 25:12|`|Y6odIQgJaa	I am not an atheist, but I have met many on my journey.<br>  <br>  I find most of them to be extremely moral....

FhHklqkhaa	theone78 is one of the bigots<br>  you can't be tolerant of folly he says omitting that religious bigotry is a folly and worse<br>  religion isn't a driving force for morality any more - if it ever was<br>  religion is losing ground thankfully<br>  people shouldn't be just tolerated - equality is what's best<br>  <br>  I also think rowan williams is trying to pander to bigots too much|`|4HClQObFaa	Quite right. Most religions - particularly the Judeo-Christian religions have too much anti-gay baggage ever to earn the trust of gay people.<br>  <br>  And so they can never tolerate gay people which is astonishing when you think what a high proportion of priests are gay in their desires and then fail to keep their vows of celibacy.<br>  <br>  Don't expect anything good from any religion.<br>  <br>  Don't go in lions' dens either!<br>  <br>  And, above all don't believe the rubbish they peddle!|`|knOdcrDkaa	That depends on which religion is doing the driving, doesn't it?  If Unitarian Universalism, the United Church of Christ, most Pagans, most Buddhists, Satanists, or Reform/Reconstructionist Jews were in the driver's seat, you'd see acceptance and respect, not just "tolerance."|`|AA12382198	You're making a wrong assumption.<br>  <br>  Religion doesn't drive morality.....society drives morality.<br>  <br>  Societies that have never heard of Religion have their own morals.|`|RzbEWv6faa	Tolerance is the bare minimum gays should ask for in all religions. They are people too and they should not just be tolerated, they should be treated like everyone else. I believe you're born gay, it's not a choice, it's natural, just like being straight is.|`|K8QTdUnfaa	People can learn, religions can adapt.  Yes, more than tolerance can and should be expected.  This goes for ethnic, gender, developmental, and orientation issues.  Those religions that wish to keep the KKK mentality will receive the same stigma.|`|bVHnNqzBaa	People can no more choose to be homosexual than can they choose to be heterosexual or anything in between. Why would anyone choose to be gay? There are no consolation prizes. Rather, gays and lesbians can be fired from their job, lose their apartment, have no implied inheritance rights, little legal protections, face ridicule and scorn, face vile hatred and castigation from the likes of Fred Phelps and Jerry Fallwell as well as every major religion. Who would choose that?<br>  <br>  As far as mores and morals, heterosexuals engage in far more sodomy than homosexuals. I do not see religious leaders calling for a ban on oral or anal sex. If those acts are the true foundation of your arguments, why did the fundies push for restrictions against same-sex marriages instead of a Constitutional amendment banning sodomy?<br>  <br>  Newt Gingrich, big supporter of DoMA and huge sodomite who cheated on his wife (she was undergoing cancer treatment at the time) while pushing that legislation. Trent Lott was on his third marriage when pushing for that marriage protection. Gays have hurt the "institution of marriage?"<br>  <br>  <br>  If homosexuality is such a big deal, why was Jesus completely silent on the subject?<br>  <br>  I am surprised that so many people respond to a question dealing with homosexuality yet these people have absolutely no experience with the subject. They speak from a position of complete ignorance. It's like trying to describe chocolate without ever having tasted it. <br>  <br>  Ask a homosexual if it was his/her choice. Almost every one will tell you no. Why would someone choose to be persecuted, face a life of discrimination, risk loosing their apartment, risk losing their job, risk the public scorn of others?<br>  <br>  Religion has no monopoly over marriage. Marriage has always been about inheritance and property rights. Read Same-Sex Unions in Premodern Europe by John Boswell for a very in-depth examination of the sacred text from which the Bible was derived.<br>  <br>  Early Christian Gnostics had no problem with same-sex unions I believe it was the Catholic Church in the 13th Century that broke away from the Gnostics and added all these rules. Keep in mind that movable type wasn't invented until the 16th Century so Bibles were not accessible to the masses until many many many years after Christ's death. Even the Gospels were not written until many years after the death of the disciples.|`|AyEkA6Flaa	It's true that in some large, institutionalized religious groups such as Catholic, Orthodox and Southern Baptist -- not to mention Muslims -- the traditional bias is against homosexuality.<br>  <br>  That being said, did you know that, before he became pope (ruling only one month before his untimely death, alas), John Paul I / Albino Luciani was a supporter of same-sex unions and of gay adoption when he was Catholic Patriarch of Venice?<br>  <br>  Please notice that in many circles -- the Lutheran Church, the Church of England, many Methodists and Presbyterians -- there is a growing acceptance and even embrace of gay and lesbian believers.<br>  <br>  I'd say we are in the equivalent of the year 1840 or 1850 as regards abolition of slavery.  Yes, there is still bigotry against LGBT folk, and old religious institutions are sometimes stuck in the mud about this issue, and others even openly full of bigotry -- BUT there is a sea change in the air.<br>  <br>  I was moved by the acceptance speech of Dustin Lance Black last night on the Academy Awards.  He won Oscar for best screenwriter for the movie "Milk", and his acceptance speech was warmly received.<br>  <br>  I know it's hard right now, Archie, but times are changing.  It is not God's fault that some stupid Christians are too blockheaded to discern His will, hope and vision for LGBT folk.  But it will happen!  Within your lifetime, it will happen.|`|hZjPYyFTaa	Check out the Archbishop of Cantebury, Rowan Williams.<br>  <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/doc/200903/archbishop-canterbury" rel="nofollow">http://www.theatlantic.com/doc/200903/ar...</a><br>  It's called the Velvet Reformation. He is moving along with his agenda for Gay rights in the Anglican Community. <br>  He's a staunch intellectual, has a rigid Orthodoxy but is progressive in the area of gay rights which caused an uproar at the Lambeth Conference - 10-year meeting of world Bishops.

"<br>  <br>  Are you against the God they *claim* to follow, <br>  or perhaps, are you against the *teachings they CLAIM* are his teachings?<br>  Please notice the warnings about such a circumstance that Christ himself gave:<br>  <br>  “Many will say to me: ‘Lord, did we not prophesy, expel demons, & perform many powerful works in your name?’  Yet I will confess to them: *I never knew you*! *Get away from me*, you workers of lawlessness. --Matthew 7:21-23  <br>  <br>  "You hypocrites, Isaiah aptly prophesied about You, when he said, <br>   ‘This people honors me with their lips, yet *their heart is far removed* from me.  It is in vain that they keep worshiping ... because *they teach commands of men* as doctrines.’”  --Matthew 15:7,8  <br>  <br>  "For false Christs and false prophets will arise, and will give great signs and wonders so as to mislead, if possible, even the chosen ones.   Watch out! I have forewarned You." --Matthew 24:24,25 & Mark 13:22<br>  <br>  This is such an important issue to understand, that Jesus' followers issued even further warnings, such as:<br>  <br>  "...These very ones will quietly bring in destructive sects... Furthermore, many will follow their acts of loose conduct, and on account of these the way of the truth will be spoken of abusively.  Also, with covetousness they will exploit You with counterfeit words. But as for them, the judgment from of old is not moving slowly, and the destruction of them is not slumbering." --2 Peter 2:1-3  <br>  <br>  " For such men are false apostles, deceitful workers, transforming themselves into apostles of Christ.  And no wonder, for Satan himself keeps transforming himself into an angel of light.  It is therefore nothing great if his ministers also keep transforming themselves into ministers of righteousness. But their end shall be according to their works. --2 Corinthians 11:13-15  <br>  <br>  “Test the inspired expressions to see whether they originate with God, because many false prophets have gone forth into the world." --1 John 4:1 <br>  <br>  Many are the teachings of the various churches, which are claimed to be from God's word, but that are actually adopted from pagan & atheistic  religion.

List your concerns and objections to Christianity one by one, and at the same time, give her a chance to defend them. You can't expect her to be respectful of your thoughts and beliefs if you are not respectful of hers, nor can you expect for her to stay calm if you are not calm, yourself.<br>  <br>  Something else you can do is to prepare yourself by educating yourself. Make a list of everything you object to. Then, look to see what in the Bible supports her point of view before she starts quoting the verses. If it sounds like you did your research, she's less likely to go crazy. <br>  <br>  To be honest, I don't know what your objections are and what reasons you have for not believing in God, especially the Christian/Jewish/Muslim God, the God of Abraham.

How is one going to accomplish this?   <br>  <br>  Let me give an example to illustrate this:<br>  <br>  Let's say a house has self awareness, it knows it has 3 bedrooms 2 bathrooms, a kitchen and a garage.   It has very clear understanding of all its internal components that when put together make a house a house.  How then can a house prove that humans made and designed it based upon the knowledge it has of itself?  <br>  <br>  It is my firm belief that although God is very involved in the aspects of this universe down to the very small details, He Himself as an entity is totally distinct from His creation.  <br>  <br>  How is one going to prove God exists when he may be totally seperate from His created universe?   And how is one going to disprove that He doesn't exist?   I think this is an exercise in futility.|`|UO3i8BqVaa	1. There is no evidence that gods exist.<br>  2.

Jesus created all things (Col. 1:16-17), it is God who created all things by Himself (Isaiah 44:24)<br>  19. Jesus searches the hearts and minds of the people (Rev. 2:23)<br>  20.

In the OT God was seen (Exodus 6:2-3;Exodus 24:9-11; Num. 12:6-9; Acts7:2), yet no man can see God (Exodus 33:20; John 1:18). It was not the Father that was seen in the OT (John 6:46).

Since the characters (the "letters") that that code is "printed" in are actually the size of molecules, that makes a lot of "typing" to give us a body. Could we type that much without making a mistake, since any mistake would cause a genetic weakness or birth defect? Could blind chance? <br>  <br>  Another thing. Ever tried to swat a fly? Not necessarily easy, right? Know why? It has to do with the fly's navigational system. It has a single vibrating rod in its abdomen, and as it changes direction in flight, it senses the changes in the vibrations of that rod and is able to dodge you, fly and land upside down and backwards. What would the Air Force pay to have flying and navigational systems that good?<br>  <br>  How did the fly manage to evolve such a system? Even if it evolved the vibrating rod, what good would it be without the nerves to send the signals from the rod to the brain? And the section of the brain to interpret the signals? And the correct instructions to interpret them? And the correct instructions to the part of the brain that controlled the wings as to what to DO about those signals? All AT THE SAME TIME. Wouldn't that be a remarkable coincidence? I ask people, "Could YOU sit down, right now, and write the code for such a set of instructions? And if your ten billion well trained and coordinated neurons put together can't do it with a computer, is it really reasonable to think that flies did it by themselves?"<br>  <br>  The fly has a complete navigational system that is self-constructing (in its egg), self-reproducing, self-programming, self-correcting, that can fly upside down and backwards, avoiding dangers and locating and recognizing fuel (food), that requires even MORE entire, completely developed systems that even large groups of highly educated humans cannot or are only now beginning to be able to copy (and only by intelligent design), all microminiaturized into a space smaller than the head of a pin, with the code for it in characters that are the size of molecules (I wonder how many characters per inch that works out to? Pretty hi-tech data storage). <br>  <br>  So I ask people, "In your experience, how many complete flying and navigational systems do you know of that have happened completely by accident, with no intelligent thought or design?" "Did you ever read the story of all the thought and work needed to design and build a flying machine, as told by the Wright brothers themselves? So how scientific is it to say that it just happened by blind accidents in the case of the lowly, incredibly complex fly?"<br>  <br>  All of the animal and plant world is full of examples like these. Your body is, too. Johns Hopkins University made the newspapers by making one enzyme. It must have been pretty hard to do. It was no accident. But your liver manufactures over nine hundred enzymes, all necessary for you to live, and no one thinks about putting THAT in the paper, or giving credit for that accomplishment to the One who deserves it. "Could have happened completely by accident" (which is what evolution equates to, isn't it?) But if it could happen so easily, simply by accidents of evolution, then why put the university in the news because it was able to produce ONE?<br>  <br>  This isn't defending the horrible things that have been done, like the Inquisition, and unscientific things taught, like a 7,000-year-old earth, by very fallible people supposedly in God's name...<br>  <br>  Best regards,<br>  Mike|`|ef4edd8f1c0d16fab298d474bf08b339aa	All anyone here can supply you with is evidence.

379b50dce4fc66c5c2a45e76914bd311aa	not all slavery is the same.  while yes, its bad in general, .... well let me put it this way.<br>  <br>  slaves of those who followed the bibical age laws regarding slavery in the torah, had a better standard of living than a LARGE PORTION of the current earth population.<br>  <br>  let me reiterate this.  changing to a standard of life, following the slavery regulations in the tanakh, would be an IMPROVEMENT TO QUALITY OF LIFE FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE, ... even in the US. <br>  <br>  how many people in the US are physically and mentally capable of working, and just can't find a job? (enough to be a problem) <br>  <br>  what if you offered them a deal where for 7 years they would get:<br>  1) guaranteed housing (of reasonable quality)  <br>  2) guaranteed meals (of reasonable, but not necessarily generous quality and amount) <br>  3) relative safety. (as much as anyone has) <br>  4) a job, and job security. (not necessarily a pleasant job, but one that is guaranteed) <br>  5) appropriate clothing<br>  6) leaving the deal with a small amount of money saved up<br>  <br>  how many people, even within the US, would stand in line in the snow for DAYS to sign up for such a deal?  (a lot) <br>  <br>  the bottom line being that slavery of those following the laws in the tanach is a VERY VERY VERY different thing than the slavery of say, pre-civil war united states.<br>  <br>  also, did you notice theres a provision that after a certain number of years, the slave is set free? and not only that, there is a provision for them to VOLUNTARILY make the arrangement permenant.  <br>  <br>  how many people worldwide would do whatever it took, to get an arrangement where they were protected, housed, and fed, with guaranteed employment for a time? there are SO many people worldwide whom such an arrangement would be a massive improvement to their lifestyle, the fact that you put it down because its called slavery is absurd.<br>  <br>  hell ignore the people who can't get work. there are people who are happy to have work at all, who would have a quality of life improvement with that arrangement over their current situation.<br>  <br>  edit: <br>  disgusting? I agree that its not ideal. but honestly the way things are for so many people, even within the US is no better, in fact for many its far worse.<br>  <br>  1) irrelevant. that has nothing to do with the topic.  and I don't think slaves were generally kept chained like that. no need.  <br>  2) actually no, they were required to be fed. in fact the "owner" had to feed the slaves before they fed themselves. beatings were limited very severely. no permenant injuries allowed, no torture allowed.<br>  3) entirely false. slaves were still considered human beings and people under the laws in the tanach. killing a slave was still murder and it was not acceptable. yes they could be beat if they did not please their master, but it was limited to only temporary injuries. <br>  4) there are people with legal jobs in the US that are worse.<br>  5) isn't that kinda a given? if nothing else out of practicality?<br>  6) depends on the situation, in some cases yes, it was permenant.  but not all. <br>  <br>  you should read the text a bit more carefully.  you do not seem to understand the difference between slavery in the bible period following the laws in the torah, and the foolish evilness that was early american history.<br>  <br>  for example check out Exodus 21<br>  <br>  honestly look at the way the world is now. how people in poverty live.  the current state of the world is no better.<br>  <br>  edit2: do keep in mind that there were different varietys of slavery in the time, depending on who it was and why and such.  but even in that case from what I've read even in the case of permenant slaves, they were treated worlds better than the "slaves" in settings like pre-civil war US.  <br>  and as far as legally enforced prostitutes in the US... I am not talking about legal. I am talking about reality and situations that are socially preventable, but aren't.  <br>  part of my point is that events in the past need to be considered for the time they occured, chronologically in context, so to speak. if there are people using those laws to justify slavery today, they are wrong.  <br>  <br>  I guess what I am saying is that yes, those things were bad then. but they are not nearly as bad as you and many others make them out to be, particularly when compared to the way things are in the modern world.<br>  <br>  look at for example the laws regarding hebrew "slaves". highly regulated and as a means to solve certain problems that STILL exist.<br>  <br>  and no, I don't think that the early US was the only ones in the world with horrible slavery. yes there were others. thats just an easy, relatively "personal" example.<br>   there were also other cultures that had some forms of "legalized" slavery that were not remotely as bad.|`|FhHklqkhaa	cos people of those times had slaves|`|LVMpbm6aaa	Because at the time of the revelation of the Quran slavery was entrenched in the social framework of the society.However though Islam tolerated it a sence it is clear from Hadith that is not an ideal condition.<br>  <br>  The prophet himself did not keep slaves,but instead told his followers that there were blessings in freeing them.If you hit a slave and cause him harm you are obligated to free him.Slaves have to be cared for adequately,fed clothed,allowed to marry, allowed to purchase their freedom,given time to rest during the day etc etc.<br>  <br>  For many sins,the act of repentance is freeing a slave and is a great sin to enslave a free man.<br>  <br>  So in this way we as muslims recognise that slavery is not something that the muslim should ideally participate in.<br>  <br>  On a side note.Life isnt fair,and Muslims don't expect it to be.For a lot of people it sucks,but that's the hand they've been dealt.As we say,this life is nothing.

Atheist have no reason not to.  Schizophrenics don't know better.  None of that is true, but it sometimes perceived, by some, that all of the above is true.  When those people are focused upon by the media, all people would appear to think like that.  Likewise when an atheist or schizophrenic commits a crime, more attention is drawn to them since they are in minority and the perception seems to convey all are like that.  Things are a little different when a christian does something stupid or commits a crime.  They are punished, forgiven and allowed to go their way without much focus.

And there are other, non-reconstructionist Pagans who honor the old gods as well.|`|b06d5f5c50bd7cf1d8a2a3aedfcc1c94aa	Yes the sun is a small red star on one arm of a spiral galaxy which we call "the milky way" It has a number of planets 8, 9, or 10 depending on your definition of a planet. We live on the 3rd planet out from the sun.<br>  Religion, and it does not matter which one you pick, is a faith system made up by the people who wish to have faith in the god that that particular religion supports. None of them have any basis in fact and they have nothing to do with the sun|`|rcPnnfmmaa	The sun is very important in most religions. Farmers of all origins observe it very closely in order to determine the proper date for planting new crops. The sun and associated deities are almost always benevolent, symbolizing important virtues, regrowth, and rebirth.<br>  <br>  Almost everybody from Norway to Egypt to India had some sort of event on or near the solstices. The sun is coming back again! Imagine the joy and wonder on an ancient farmer's face at this annual celestial miracle.<br>  <br>  It's not coincidence that Jesus was born very near the winter solstice. If shepherds were out with their flocks it probably was not winter in Jerusalem. However, by having it near all the other existing celebrations of life it made it an easier sell; the new religion could adapt old traditions instead of trying to destroy them.<br>  <br>  I celebrate Christmas anyway and I never believed Jesus was unique to begin with. Why? It's fun. There's a special breed of Christian who does know enough mythology to recognize what this is all about and therefore refuses to celebrate it. They're absolutely no fun.<br>  <br>  There's also a movie called Zeitgeist you've probably heard of. The first part is true...mostly. Christianity does not have a direct line of descent to Egyptian gods. Jesus is not Horus or Osiris. Positive solar deities are a globally recurring theme that's older than any of them, and incidentally so is coming back from the dead.<br>  <br>  People like the sun and want their idols to be more powerful than death itself. Shocking, huh?|`|Wo1BkKTBaa	JoyofSatan . com <----Satanism/Paganism.|`|8QgF4xqkaa	For those who claim that the Sun is god, what if the universe collapses? The sun would be gone.

It could be one day, several days or even weeks. It is a serious practice. And when you fast, that is between you and God only. You are not to announcing to everyone that you are fasting.<br>  <br>   Matthew 6:16 Moreover when ye fast, be not, as the hypocrites, of a sad countenance: for they disfigure their faces, that they may appear unto men to fast. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward.|`|biPAZ2TVaa	Dont eat anything and dont tell anyone your fasting.|`|pFs71HsHaa	To "fast" means to go without eating at all.|`|7iFVbir1aa	no.......here,,,,read this<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.new-life.net/fasting.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.new-life.net/fasting.htm</a>|`|M2UWOTAjaa	Lent is not a period of fasting, but of absinence. This is not the same thing. You give up something important to you in preparation for Easter.<br>  True fasting is not eating anything at all. Fasting for three days or less is safe, but not on a weekly basis. When fasting, you should drink plenty of water - the by products of eating your own fat and muscle is, for one thing, ketones. Ketones are very hard on the kidneys (this chemical is like acetone (fingernail polish remover). However, it's water souluble and drinking lots of water helps your kidneys get rid of it. Medical professionals are completely against prolonged fasting.|`|8b35140fd5eabcceff1f6c71562a2a02aa	Actually fasting is about not eating at all, but if you want to fast, begin by missing one meal the first few days, then missing two meals the next couple of days then after about 5-6 days you can begin your proper fast.  I would not fast for more than about two days to begin with and make sure when you begin to eat again that you do it gradually....eating simple foods that are easy to digest such as fruit veg etc....<br>  <br>  When you are fasting you can either just drink water and fruit juice [make sure not too much citrus juice as this can be quite acidic] or just water, and/or herbal teas.<br>  <br>  Remember too if you enjoy coffee and tea then you will also have to gradually reduce these over the first few days as you will get bad headaches if you just STOP drinking them suddenly.<br>  <br>  The other thing to consider is that as you are 12 it may not be recommended to go on a full fast [just cos you are still growing etc], so check with your GP first and make sure your parents are ok with you fasting too.<br>  <br>  The idea of fasting is that during the time that you would be eating that you spend that time praying and reading your Bible....you can fast at any time of the year really not necessarily Lent....I think the Roman catholic idea is to give up one of your favorite foods for Lent to respect the sacrifice that Jesus made for us....if you do feel comfortable about doing a complete fast you will notice that you are more mentally and spiritually alert after a while.<br>  <br>  Hope I've been of some help....x|`|d352d88dd2ccd5e746b195aabb1b47e3aa	Fasting is different for different people.  Lent is a time when you give up something important to you for the entire 40 days.  It could be chocolate, pie, food, drink, tv show, etc.  Something you think you can't live without basically, and you give it up for the 40 days of LENT. So fasting can be defined as totally abstaining for food for one whole day, one whole meal, one whole week, one whole month, etc.  The idea is that you decide what you can do.  And don't get down on yourself if you don't follow through the first or second time.  Just keep trying.  You will get the idea eventually.<br>  <br>  God Bless America.|`|qyoXSdPCaa	Biblical fasting is the freewill practice of abstaining from food and/or the pleasantries of life for the purpose of devoting oneself to God and concentrating on spiritual goals, particularly the goal of defeating spiritual enemies and overcoming the lusts of the flesh..<br>  <br>  "Fasting is nothing else than the abstinence and temperance of the godly, and a watching and chastising of our flesh, taken up for present necessity, whereby we are humbled before God, and withdraw from the flesh those things with which it is cherished, to the end that it may the more willingly and easily obey the Spirit. The fasts wherein the Jews fasted from meat, and not from wickedness, pleased God nothing at all, as we may see in the books of the Prophets. ... All fasts ought to proceed from a free and willing spirit" (The Second Helvetic Confession, 1566, XXII).|`|AA10248239	Fasting means different things in different faiths.  I'm Muslim, and we don't eat or drink for dawn to sunset when we fast.

Not a good idea for a 12 year old. give up something else for Lent, like maybe chocolate or something else you enjoy|`|l8N2uC6Iaa	Fasting rules in the Roman Rite of the Catholic Church include limiting your food to 1 full meal on those days, however in other Rites the fast includes fasting from all dairy and milk products too.  The rules for both do not include children or elderly or people who have dietary requirements such as diabetics or pregnant women.  <br>  <br>  What you may be confusing this with is Lenten sacrifice, where you "give up" something for lent such as candy, as a sign of suffering and penance to prepare your heart for the sacrifice that Christ made for you.<br>  <br>  There are 2 fasting days during lent... Ash Wednesday and Good Friday.  There are also days of abstinence on Fridays where we don't eat meat on those days.  <br>  <br>  Hope this clarified things for you.|`|EfIXhZdqaa	Lent and Fasting are different. Lent is when you give up something that you really enjoy--often times a meal. It doesn't have to be food, though. Fasting is when you don't eat at all in order to praise whatever God you choose to worship.|`|5ASRK3sDaa	Fasting is no eating at all, but you can drink as much as you want.

I can say this from experience. My boyfriend, whom I care for deeply is an ex-member. I wont get into the strange beliefs and details of their worship, but I would advise you to stay away from any religion that meets all the standards of a cult, or mind-control group. <br>  <br>  If you are interested in attending aChristann service, I would recommend a non-denominational service.

He created us to know, love and serve Him. God doesn't need us, He is perfectly happy without us. He wants to share heaven with us. When we offend God it is not enough to forgive yourself and pray to God and ask for forgiveness. If that was the case, it would be so much easier and no big deal to sin. It's hard to go to confession and have to tell your sins to a priest when he's right there. Offending God is serious and He wants us to be sorry for our sins, confess them to a priest so he can help you by giving advice. God talks to you through the priest. It's not easy to go to Heaven, we must show God that we love Him. The proof is there, that there is only one and true faith. Unfortunately when things are difficult we give up and we want to believe that it's too hard so it must be wrong.The devils hard at work.

I did not receive it from any man, nor was I taught it; rather, I received it by revelation from Jesus Christ.<br>  <br>  2 Timothy 3:16 tells us that the Bible was "breathed out" by God.<br>  <br>  Galatians 1: 11-12 tells us that the gospel was a revelation from Jesus Christ himself, which was recorded by Jesus disciples and Paul.<br>  <br>  God himself chose the disciples and the people whom He knew were going to spread His word and write the Bible.<br>  <br>  The Bible was written by approximately 40 men of diverse backgrounds over the course of 4000 years. Despite being penned by different authors over 40 centuries, the Bible does not contradict itself and does not contain any errors. The authors all present different perspectives, but they all proclaim the same one true God, and the same one way of salvation—Jesus Christ (John 14:6; Acts 4:12).<br>  <br>  In John 8:58 "I tell you the truth," Jesus answered, "before Abraham was born, I am!"<br>  <br>  The above verse speaks a lot about who Jesus really is.<br>  <br>  All about Jesus and the Holy Trinity explained in the below website.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com</a><br>  <br>  Lots of videos, sermons, songs are also present, along with all of Jesus miracles, his parables, and questions on his birth, crucifixion, resurrection are answered.<br>  <br>  Many major questions on Christianity are answered with lot of examples that cannot be denied by anyone, such as,<br>  <br>  1) Did Jesus really exist?

Jesus created all things (Col. 1:16-17), it is God who created all things by Himself (Isaiah 44:24)<br>  19. Jesus searches the hearts and minds of the people (Rev. 2:23)<br>  20. Jesus is worshiped (Matt. 2:2-11; Matt.14:33; Matt.28:9; John 9:35-38;<br>  Heb. 1:6) Only God can be worshipped (Matt. 4:10) (same Greek word for worship<br>  is used in each place.)<br>  21. In the OT God was seen (Exodus 6:2-3;Exodus 24:9-11; Num. 12:6-9; Acts7:2), yet no man can see God (Exodus 33:20; John 1:18). It was not the Father that was seen in the OT (John 6:46).

Chesterton called the United States 'a nation with the soul of a church.' At that time, the Protestant church began tackling social reform in what has become known as 'social Christianity,' or sometimes 'Christian socialism,' which was later adapted into the more moderate 'Social Gospel.'<br>  <br>  "The movement was a response to the rapid urbanization, industrialization, and mass immigration of the late 1800s. Protestant clergymen became interested in securing social justice for the poor, partly as an attempt to expand the appeal of the Protestant church in cities, where the Roman Catholic church was especially popular among the large immigrant population. Traditionally, the Social Gospel has focused on issues as varied as poverty, unemployment, civil rights, pollution, drug addiction, political corruption, and gun control.<br>  <br>  "The READER'S COMPANION TO AMERICAN HISTORY mentions three leaders of the Social Gospel movement: Washington Gladden, who 'sympathized with workers and urged them to seek unity in Christianity,' William Dwight Porter Bliss, who worked with the Knights of Labor and Socialist party, and Walter Rauschenbusch, a New York City Baptist minister who 'called for a democratic cooperative society to be achieved by nonviolent means.' . . .<br>  <br>  "The Social Gospel rejected the conservative individualistic social ethic, instead developing a distinctively optimistic rationale as a result of 'the theological liberalism that emerged out of attempts to reconcile the Christian faith with evolutionary thought, historical-critical analysis of the Bible, philosophical idealism, and the study of other world religions.'<br>  <br>  "The core of Christian progressivism was 'work in this world to establish a Kingdom of God with social justice for all.' The results of the movement were mixed. Although it helped liberalize organized religion and inspired many political and social reformers to look at reform in moral terms, the Social Gospel failed to win over many urban immigrants, and offered few long-term solutions to urban problems.<br>  <br>  "However, the work of the progressive social reformers was not in vain. Organized social concern and many of the reforms it inspired have remained intact through the twentieth century and continue today, evident both in current social welfare programs."<br>   - - - - -<br>  So:  Considering that our current President began his working career as a community organizer in an urban area (Chicago), I'd say that the Social Gospel is alive and well.  And. Rev. Jeremiah Wright isn't really that far afield from the Social Gospel at all.|`|NWopkX4baa	The Social Gospel is how Universal Health Care got started in Canada with Tommy Douglas.|`|Wo1BkKTBaa	What?

Some of my martial arts students say that Jesus never existed, and they have good arguments to prove it. Refusing to change your mind for no good reason is desirable, but refusing to change your mind for any reason, however good, is extremely unwise. Yes, Christ is fictional for certain.

You can't straddle the fence. We can't be good enough to enter Heaven, because we are guilty and we deserve death as the consequence to our sins.

NO-ONE gets to heaven by their own merit...we have all missed the mark, of course you are not perfect none of us are, but Jesus was and if you measure your life against him - he did not commit ANY sin - then you will so easily notice your shortcomings.<br>  <br>  We make the decision whether or not we go to heaven, God gives us all that choice - he wont force you to go if you dont want to - but there is only ONE way - thats HIS way not man's way.<br>  <br>  If you get chance read the Gospel of John, or if you feel that is too heavy you may want to read Question of Life by Nicky Gumbel.<br>  <br>  Heres' a thought for you in the meantime - Jesus paid a debt that he did not owe because we owe a debt we cannot pay.<br>  <br>  What you need to be thankful for is that God sent Jesus and made a way back to the Father for us, if he hadn't then...well its not worth thinking about....<br>  <br>  All the best to you x<br>  <br>  P.s. there will be lots of ex-murderers and ex-prostitutes and ex-thieves in heaven - and lots of what we may consider 'nice' people in hell - you will have to take it up with God if you have a problem with it, I dont really know what else to say.<br>  <br>  I will pray for you tho x|`|fyoA2ZM6aa	You and He will not go to heaven.. being a christian is not a religion<br>  is a life style..and someone who does cheats steals and breaks the law is a fool to think he's going to heaven. and you are denouncing God and Jesus as your savior<br>  so you won't go to heaven either..  so Ur answer is No.|`|3mDvjCa8aa	If God exists, and the other has "accepted Jesus in his heart", he will go to Heaven over you.<br>  <br>  This is the fundamental flaw in Christianity.

If you was in jail for a small offense and someone else was in for a bigger offense, but you could not pay your bail and a bail bondsman paid his bail you would stay in jail and he would be released.  Only Enoch and Elijah went straight to heaven without Jesus we are told.  If you harmed a kitten, how could you make up for that?  There is nothing you can do to make that go away.  Even if you was perfect the rest of your life the kitten would still be hurt.  Only God can make that disappear.|`|gAl41HtGaa	It sounds to me like your not exactly a atheist.

c898150558ddb7ef0e50782e0a5d05b4aa	“Verily, verily, I say unto you, if a man keep my saying, he shall never see death.” <br>  <br>  Does this mean that those who believe and obey Jesus are now never to die? <br>  <br>  No; if that were the case none of the apostles would have died. But having the assurance of the resurrection, these are no longer children of wrath as are others, and therefore view death as only a sleep from which they will be awakened.|`|dmTVbpcWaa	When Jesus spoke about not dying, or of living forever, he clearly did not mean that his listeners back then would never experience human death. The basic point Jesus was making was that faith in him could lead to everlasting life.<br>  <br>  Looking at only those words, a person might conclude that Jesus was telling his audience that they could avoid the experience of death. The context, however, does not support that conclusion. Jesus had just said: “This is the will of him that sent me, that I should lose nothing out of all that he has given me but that I should resurrect it at the last day. .?.?. Everyone that beholds the Son and exercises faith in him should have everlasting life, and I will resurrect him at the last day. .?.?. No man can come to me unless the Father, who sent me, draws him; and I will resurrect him in the last day.” (John 6:39-44) And later he added: “He that feeds on my flesh and drinks my blood has everlasting life, and I shall resurrect him at the last day.” (John 6:54) Hence, Jesus’ promise of ‘living forever’ could not justifiably be understood to mean that his listeners would never experience death.<br>  <br>   It is similar with Jesus’ well-known promise to Martha: “I am the resurrection and the life. He that exercises faith in me, even though he dies, will come to life; and everyone that is living and exercises faith in me will never die at all.” (John 11:25,?26) Jesus obviously did not mean that the faithful apostles, for example, would never die as did other humans. Within a year, they would be anointed with holy spirit and?would be given the hope of?reigning as kings in heaven. To?receive that reward, they would?have to die as humans. (Romans 8:14-23; 1?Corinthians 15:36-50) And note that Jesus had said: “He that exercises faith in me, even though he dies, will come to life.”<br>  <br>  Jesus’ promise will be fulfilled toward devoted servants of God who have lived and died before the time when everlasting life begins to be provided. Such faithful ones are in line for a future resurrection. By remaining faithful after they are raised, they will never experience “the second death,” eternal death.|`|cn1jWO4Haa	if u go 2 heaven u will still be alive. e did not lie. he was true. going 2 heaven is still living. u never die, although u leave earth.|`|oen1tuyTaa	Jeez...Watch the answers from JWs.<br>  Its almost comical that YOU believe what you are saying.<br>  But its actually quite tragic.<br>  Get out now while you still can, if you can.

Before answering to your question, I would like to make a statement about Christianity of Judaism. Judaism is a religion but Christianity not. Christianity is a civilization. A reformed civilization from the orthodox Judaism. Deuteronomy has been written at the times of Old testament.(it was the time of orthodox traditions)Ok. Anyways I will explain you the logical meaning of your question. "if your mother save the life of you father- this is the version. It is absolutely duty of a wife to save her husband but not in wrong ways. If you study the previous version or complete version you can understand that. A wife should not save her husband by grabbing other man's weaknessess. Not only a wife, any human should not take weakness of fellow being as an advantage. The person who always takes other's weaknessess as advantage should be punished. This is the assumption of the verse.|`|lQNkihj3aa	Because the bible was written by a bunch of random men, that story probably happened to one of them and so he just had to make it against the rules for a woman to save her husband by grabbing someone's balls! People have a tendency to defend this verse by saying that grabbing a man down there may cause him to not be able to reproduce, but does a murderer really need to have kids!! he should be locked up anyways! the reasoning behind this is that hurting someones privates is worse than murder!|`|yFKQFeeJaa	Can any non-Christian not automatically assume he is a Bible scholar just because he can read?<br>  <br>  Point is, if you are so inclined to do research, many parts of the Bible to not apply to the New Covenant Law and also many parts of the Bible are not to be taken literally.  There was a faith before the Bible was compiled.  Now, this question may confuse Bible-only Christians, so I am fairly intrigued.  :)|`|EIG6MYVfaa	WHY CANT WE HAVE A REAL LOGIC AND REASONING ANSWER ROUND HERE -----all i see here is a  Islamic Fundamentalist trying to challenge Fanatic Bibliest .......If anyone finds my answer Unsatisfactory and gives me a valid reason ......i will leave yahoo answers forever......The problem with people is when they only interact with people of their kind , they get stagnant.....As a matter of fact, If u disagree my reasoning then logically Christ becomes sexist and Allah doesn't condemn Molestation strongly.......read on for more understanding<br>  <br>  A man has his right to fight , but should be ready to face the music. His woman has a duty to protect their kin and him.......Similarly the opponent has his right to fight .....the wife interfering, whether being physically unfair or not being a different issue , is acceptable as she is only performing her duty . But touching or holding his genitals is a violation of his chastity...much like doing so with a women is forbidden. It is trouble enough to lay down your respect on respect when asked for a duel, no one needs to be insulted more by this ghastly intrusion by the opposite sex . The very act of molestation is always set in a set of fixed circumstances ....but nonetheless always in the presence of an advantage for the sense of strength over the weak. This sequence applies very much to the man being the victim when he is most vulnerable during a fight.The end of chopping ones hand is only an order of the strictness of the punishment for crimes like these...<br>  <br>  The validity of the viewpoint of others here, about damaging his genitals may be questioned .....as in a fight it could happen between men , that they hurt more than they can fathom. So is the verse wrong in making it  unacceptable for a woman to damage them .....which is classified sexist in opinion... So what is the point of argument in this question,  the cruelty towards her or the entire verse being sexist....I urge everyone to look things from both sides and argue extensively before forming a opinion. I am agnostic and well i don't find anything wrong with this verse , given the fact that religious texts have always been viewed and written melodramatically not matter what religion it is ...........hope i helped|`|OWpeAy2Taa	i think you forgot the first rule of bible   <br>  <br>  Gospel of Mark 16:17-18….”Every Christian has to drink deadly poison, those who survive are true Christians”|`|5T2rZmcYaa	I'm sure men today wouldn't appreciate their nuts being crushed, either.|`|UO3i8BqVaa	I perfect example of the insanity of superstitious nonsense.<br>  ~|`|Hh54q5S8aa	I'm not sure about that one.

4WqvTAfmaa	Ymmo... is right on every count.  Yes, it works, and distance is no part of the success/failure rate. <br>  <br>  So if you are scared, shield. That is, put something between you and the magic. That something can be a wall of white light (grace) or a strong prayer, many can be found in the Psalms, also in the general prayers of many religions. Catholics use St. Michael to defend against the works of the devil, and ST. Patrick wrote the Lorica, which should be somewhere on the web. See link below. <br>  <br>  If you practice magic, then shield. You can use methods in the Denning & Phillips book called "Psychic Self Defense and Well-Being", Llewellyn Publications. Really good, balanced and sane book.|`|AA11104893	There is no "black" or "white" magic. Magic is only one, what differs is the intention with which you use it. <br>  It is totally possible to use magic with the intention to harm, of course. Distance plays no role whatsoever. It is equally hard (or easy) to curse someone who's in the next room and someone who's on another continent.
18be83adf26491424d29aa61ef0530d6aa	My friend if you want to know, read the Book of Exodus (specifically chapter 7 and onward about the plagues). You will learn a very great example of what magic is and what a miracle is. GOD turns Moses' rod into a snake; Pharoah's magicians do likewise. GOD turns water into blood; the magicians do likewise. These could be considered illusions or manipulations, right?<br>  <br>  Well after the first plague the magicians were stuck. GOD let them know real quick that their magic was no match for HIS true, divine power -- HE can give life and take life; cause the heavens and the earth (nature, animals, the elements) to bend to HIS will. Miracles are through GOD's will and HE has unlimited power (being the creator of absolutely everything and all)...magic, as you'll see in Exodus, is quite limited because it is through man...and man doesn't have the power.|`|KXQVRQdjaa	Well, first of all, I think the phrase "Black Magick" is rather inaccurate.  White and Black both have good and bad qualities.  Black doesn't mean bad.  But that's splitting hairs.<br>  <br>  Anyway, I don't imagine there would be physical boundaries on magick, seeing as it is not a physical thing.  Of course, I can't claim to know, I can only think intuitively and logically.  So I would think yes.<br>  <br>  But don't freak out.  Why do you suspect that you've been cursed?  Do you know someone who dislikes you and does magick?  Did someone threaten you with a curse (if so, they're probably full of it.  Someone who actually puts a curse on you probably wouldn't blab it).  Is this person a Wiccan or a Satanist?  As a general rule, Wiccans don't curse people, and Satanists don't care if they hurt their enemies, but of course there are exceptions.<br>  <br>  If I suspected there were a hex on me, I would probably visualize a bright, cleansing light filling my body and heart, washing away any unpleasantness festering inside me.  In my personal experience and that of my (skeptical) friends, the herb Rosemary is very cleansing, banishing, and soothing.  Try boiling some in water and sprinkling it around your home.  It worked very well for a friend of mine who had a horrible dread in his house.  He's a firm Atheist, so we can probably rule out Placebo.  White sage smoke has been used for hundreds of years to keep unpleasant feelings at bay.  Try to find an occult/metaphysical shop near you and see what they think.<br>  <br>  Most of all just try to relax.  The calmer you stay, the weaker any possible curse may be.  It's probably just a bad luck streak (if you even feel anything yet).  Whatever you do, don't let whoever this is boss you around under threats of a curse.  S/he's probably full of crap.<br>  <br>  Will people please quit answering to tell her that Magick isn't real.  How about you respect other people's beliefs and not answer if you haven't studied the subject?<br>  <br>  Good luck, let me know how it goes, Em|`|CnqGu1Taaa	only if you believe|`|21808938a2c954ea0389683f10267c69aa	Very unlikely.  Most often the only effect comes from fear of the *threat* of black magic.  Once you start thinking you're "cursed," you'll start noticing every tiny thing that goes wrong during the day, and become more and more convinced it's because of "black magic."|`|jOwH96wKaa	Magic isn't real, so no.|`|g4AAZRuxaa	I don't think so.|`|UH1ipgJmaa	No, Christ cleanses us from all things|`|AA11579058	No, and neither can someone who lives close to you, or with you or that you know well, or don't know at all.  There is no such thing as black magic spells.  Or black magic.  Or just spells.  Or any kind of magic.  There's trickery and illusion and sleight of hand.  There's psychology and fear and manipulation.   There's irrationality and blind faith but there is no magic.<br>  <br>  So... I guess the best thing I can say is that you don't have anything to worry about.  (Because no matter how many people thumb me down, it won't make magic any more real.)|`|zv01EjTLaa	Usually no.

You have to understand you cannot trust someone who lies to you.  Lying to you about loosing money is not a good way to start off a marriage.  If he lies about money in order to keep it from you or get more from you, he'll lie about other things to you.  Respect yourself enough not to marry a liar.  You deserve someone who can be respectful enough to you and about himself to be honest.  Walking away from an engagement is a world easier than walking away from a marriage.  Do you really want a marriage based on deception, or a husband who thinks he has the right to hide money from you and lie to you?  Here's one time when the old adage, "Just say no," really applies.

AA10988107	Evil is like the heavens and the earth Gen.1:1,2, and space Job 38:4-7,30-32, and angels, it all existed, Gen.3:22, man/Adam and Eve with<br>  Satan, serpent, dragon, Devil, accuser, Rev.12:9,10, Exe.28:13-15, the<br>  cherub angel anointed over Eden became a part of evil, evil spread till<br>  the whole earth was filled with violence, at year 1656, the flood ended<br>  that situation.<br>  Then 427 years later, Abraham is surrounded by land grabbing land<br>  pirates, Gen.14:1-18,<br>  I think God is very good, what would you have done with all these that<br>  you allowed to have life? He did not wipe it all out, even after the flood<br>  he knew Gen.8:21, that evil was going to rule, so the evil we contend <br>  with is from our own kind.<br>  We do have law that he made a covenant with Abraham to bring his<br>  family forth to be law keepers, givers and enforcers, so in 470 years<br>  after covenant, this has happened. When Solomon was 480 years <br>  later, 1Ki.6:1, king David had established enough peace that Solomon<br>  was able to have the temple in the next 36 years of his life. Then the<br>  Judah kings had it to 391st year, Babylon destroyed it all, year 3460,<br>  606 BCE and Matt.1:1-17, 14 generations to Christ first coming.<br>  That was 2615 years ago, so evil has been in business a <br>  long time, that is what Jesus will do away with, so began to<br>  imagine a place where evil does not rule and we can know<br>  what all this time is all about.|`|XowM9e7Naa	You do not seem too well informed about the bible.

In time, in place, in being.  <br>  You speak of good and evil, but these terms must be understood.  The general understanding is that "good" is that which is in accordance with nature, in accordance with God.  "Evil or Bad" is that which is not in accordance with God.  <br>  To say that there is an "evil" side of God: a side of god that is not in accordance with God's will is ludicrous and ridiculous.<br>  <br>  If your argument of God as a perpetuater of evil is based on causality, you need to look again at your understanding of it.

God brings life to all of us.<br>  <br>  God directs our steps if we want the good he makes it good if we want the bad with patience and endurance he makes things whatever we want in our hearts. <br>  <br>  God ordained men to write the word of God from the beginning he is and was the originator of the word of God. Jesus is the author and the founder of faith.  God prompted men with his spirit to write the scriptures according to the events that occurred to reach and teach us about man.Nothing men do to-day, is clear it has been done before. psalm 139.<br>  <br>  It takes God to change the hearts and the minds of men and so he chastens us.

Yet he is the last one we think to call and be persistant for and answer. We call everyone but him,the author of life. What? Jesus is not a ritual or a tradition. Jesus is serious about our Salvation he is love in its purest form. He said love one another. God makes all things possible if we trust and believe him. God works things out for our good. God allows things to bring us to our knees before him. So we pray and give thanks in bad times and the good times. Just think it could have been worse.

Often times it can be hard to understand, but know that God is real and always wants the best for you and your family.<br>  <br>  Jesus is the son of God.  God is not the son of any being.  God is infinite, He always is and always has been.

If you believe Catholic teachings on the subject:  God is infinite and all knowing. Many things come from this.  Just know that because God is not simply a physical being, a guy just walking around, but spiritual and supernatural, there can be no other.<br>  As to why bad things happen, this is a very difficult question to answer.  Even the earliest Christians wondered at this.  I suggest reading the book of Job with a guide.  The best answer I can give right now is that God has created us all and wants the best for us, but he also respects human dignity enough to allow us to make choices for ourselves.  By not holding us as puppets to his will, we can chose.  We do not, however, always choose correctly.  Bad things can happen to good people because of interactions with other people.<br>  <br>  We hold that the books of the Bible were given by Revelation and Inspiration.  That God had a hand in the writing.  There were other books written about God at the same time as the bible books and the Gospels, but these were not seen to be Inspired by the Church because of inconsistancies with other books, with the faith, and because some of them are just dumb. lol<br>  <br>  Hope this helps with some of your questions..  Feel free to email me if you think I can help|`|liGEQEz4aa	It sounds to me like you're having a crisis of faith.  Maybe God knows this is what you needed to begin to think for yourself and make your own decisions about God and religion instead of just relying on what your parents taught you.  That doesn't mean you have to throw God out of your life--for His wanting you to deepen your own personal relationship with Him....<br>  I grew up as a Christian, but questioned every other religious belief I could find, for many years, until I realized ALL are belief systems, and therefore equally unprovable...Each religion requires one to take something on faith, or it wouldn't be a belief system....That's the nature of religion.  I chose Christianity primarily because I thought it would be easier to practice because I was familiar with it.  As soon as I made that rational decision, my faith began to be strengthened in ways I didn't know were coming--in ways I couldn't have anticipated. At the same time, I had to start trying to decide which Christian Church to belong to, because I questioned that, too.  After years of searching out information about all religions, I was tired of searching out information about religions, so, even though I did begin my search, I also prayed to God to show me the Church He wanted me in.  Again, to my utter astonishment, I learned about a Church I'd never heard of before that: Eastern Orthodox Christianity, aka The Greek Orthodox Church.  I sought one out and visited, and again, I have to say, the spiritual experience was nothing I could have anticipated.  I knew I'd really been to Church for the first time in my life---even though I'd been attending and seeking all my life....What I'm saying is that you can go to God with your spiritual crisis, and say something like, " I believe, help Thou mine unbelief," and God will meet you in your worst crisis and give you what you need.  I know it seems counter intuitive to turn to God when you aren't sure He exists, but He sees you and knows where you are anyway.  Why not acknowledge that, turn to God and say to Him the truth, that you're not even sure He exists.  For your humility in turning to God even when you're not sure He's there, He'll come through in ways you cannot even imagine now.  Don't take my word for it though.  Try it for yourself and reap the spiritual rewards yourself.  You'll never have any spiritual doubts again.  Maybe that is what God wants for you--- that you never have this terrible spiritual doubt again, and He is just waiting to give you this surety...As for a council, don't reduce God to human terms and ways.  God gave us His angels and Saints....because He knows that's what we need to get to heaven.  There are other gods, but they technically are demons sent to take us to hell.  There will always be that struggle because wants us to want Him.  He would never force Himself on us.  He offers Himself and waits for us to accept or reject Him, and if we reject Him He keeps offering Himself until He sees in our hearts we are so hardened we are incapable of turning to Him.  He does not neglect anyone.  It's we humans who neglect God.  As for why it looks like God might neglect some people, don't jump to conclusions.  Remember Job.  God can have many reasons for the things He does.  Even if we humans don't always understand, don't be tempted to judge God, because that's a satanic temptation, designed to take us to hell ...  I can't explain the universe, but a lot of bad things could be happening to give us opportunities to turn to God, or they could be happening to give us examples of how to be faithful even when it's difficult.  The stories in the Bible came from the times the Scriptures were written.  Don't you remember the part about if all the things Jesus Christ said and did were written down, the whole world could not contain the books...  Feel free to contact me if you wish and God bless you on your quest for the truth.  Never give up seeking it because God only reveals Himself to those who seek....

IgNADy1Taa	It is absolutely incomprehensible to the human mind. It is impossible to grasp how old it is - how it came about - what was there before it - how big it is (infinite?) Concepts like that just make the human mind boggle! <br>  <br>  That's why it is so comforting to believe in a Creator or life force of some sort - something that had a reason for creating it, and that coordinated everything so perfectly (because even the tiniest thing like the human eye is such a complex structure!) and for some, something that continues to watch over it. I believe in God so I believe He did create it for a reason, and made humans in his likeness. I respect whatever else people believe and to some extent I do believe all prayers come back to the same God. Another Christian once explained to me that if there was a super complex computer or something, it would be much easier for people to believe in a powerful and intelligent creator of it, rather than to think it might have developed out of nowhere (drawing a parallel with the Big Bang / evolution). <br>  <br>  Oh you've made my head hurt now :(|`|VgfUAleGaa	42.|`|6gthdHpnaa	This is a question I ask myself often.

Western people consider all that as mythology.

As in the Iliad, those events are embellished.

IgNADy1Taa	I suppose orgasms must seem intimidating to someone who's never had one before. Sure it's the climax and there's nothing better after that point, but in the long-term you should explain to her that it will make sex better - she will know what she's looking forward to, and each orgasm is different and the best and most powerful might end up coming along (no pun intended) when she least expects it! Make sure she knows that it's not like an ecstasy hit or something where the first one is the best and all you do is chase that first feeling for the rest of your life! <br>  <br>  In fact once she has orgasmed frequently you can try all sorts of different things to make them even longer and more powerful. Since some women can also orgasm vaginally (not all though, I've heard) she also has that to look forward to (or if that's how she does it first, then clitorally is next). And her orgasms will vary depending for example on whether you are using your hand or your mouth, so tell her she is missing out on a lot and has a lot to try out!<br>  <br>  Perhaps there is another reason why she does not want to orgasm. Maybe she's scared of having her first one in front of someone else? Maybe she's scared of looking stupid, or being too loud, or is not sure how much stuff comes out? Maybe you could suggest that she masturbates and does not stop until she comes, so she can experience it in privacy first - and then you can show her how it feels different with someone else giving it to you.<br>  <br>  And also emphasise that women can have multiple orgasms so even if she comes once that is by no means the end of your hanky panky!|`|aKkDWz5Waa	ask her for when shes saving it, and why.<br>  <br>  NO TIME LIKE THE PRESENT!!<br>  <br>  i think she doesnt wanna be disappointed by life(according to what u said). she wants to keep thinking theres more and doesnt want to feel like life holds no secrets to her, cuz then it wouldnt be interesting nd she wouldnt be able to have faith in more, because even "the best thing" is just a thing shes already experienced. really dk tho. that is strange. r u sure shes in love? u should ask her to be honest.|`|Plu6OVoGaa	How do you touch her? I'd like to learn how to finger myself properly.|`|zWX5GDehaa	first of all, how the hell do girls have sex? i dont get it..|`|6w7FKrlfaa	this q is all about me.  i have been with my gf for 10 years.  we're soulmates.  we were 18 when we met and now at 28 i can honestly say that i have only ever had an orgasm once. yes once.  i love making my gf orgasm and she squirts and yeah u get the idea.  but i can not let myself do it.  i too push her hand or whatever away, just before the point of no return... so to speak..  we use to have arguments about this all the time.  lately i think she just accepts it.  we are both boi ish.  it has nothing to do with that though.  i know that a lot of you would be thinking 'why wouldn't you want to have an orgasm?'  but it's not like that.  it's just for me personally, growing up, i never wanted or asked for a thing.  i still don't.  my counsellor seems to think, i feel as though i don't deserve it.  when i'm just about there. she begs me just to let her finish me off....  and i try.. but i just can't.  and if you're wondering... the once off was an accident.  i misjudged my signs.|`|eGtZXgRHaa	Just make her understand that, even if she has an orgasm one day, it doesn't mean she won't ever have another one... lol I mean you're good if she's near that (in fact would reach it if she just let you do), so there's no reason you won't make her climax ever again after the first time she will... does it make any sense ? lol<br>  <br>  And, if she fears that after that it'll all just be the same again and again (which it is right now 'cause she never climax), then tell her you can always make things different. Games, scenarios, accessories, anything ! I'm sure you 2 will be creative ;)<br>  <br>  I have a question though. Do you climax ? 'Cause if you do, then you can tell her about you, that you still like making love to her as much even if you reach that point...<br>  <br>  Good luck !|`|bRAmXcowaa	that would drive me nuts!!!! <br>  Let he know that it is not a case of it not getting any better after she has one, it does get better cos of the anticipation!!!! That is the best part, then you can get into teasing and testing and make it orgasm different each time.<br>  You should let her know that it does hurt your feelings, and that you are not just after getting her over the line, but you want the tenderness and special feelingthat you get after one or both of you climax. Its bonding and beautiful<br>  <br>  good luck|`|yJZeRu5Vaa	maybe shes afraid shell get bored of them?<br>  sink her battleship and she'll tahnk you, she just doesnt know it yet|`|2DahzSWvaa	I once dated a butch lesbian who didn't like to be touched *there* if she allowed me to she would never want to orgasm.

Talk to her and find out.  If it is so, you may tell her that squirting is ok and that you would look at it as a bonus, not as anything weird.  Or it could be that she convulses too erratically when she comes and feels kind of shy coming in front of your eyes.  You may want to try her with your tongue and fingers simultaneously.  Maybe it is that she feels sore or something.  Or maybe you are not as good as you think fingering.  A man tells you, Adian.

Human rights to dignity, liberty and a chance for happiness are founded in the human centered ethos, "what is hateful to yourself, do not do to others."  This creed predates almost all currently practiced religions (except Hinduism, which has a nice version of it), but is also the cornerstone of such atheistic philosophies as Buddhism, Taoism, and Confucianism.  It has arisen independently in almost every culture through out history.  The sticking point has always been in defining who counts as "others".  As long as we have rallying points like (including, but not limited to) religions that dehumanize and demonize non-adherents, those become less-than-people to whom the prime ethos need not apply.|`|AA11297267	Yes, but Jefferson also said:<br>  "Christianity neither is, nor ever was, a part of the common law."<br>  <br>  Human rights come from thinking human beings -- some of whom also happened to believe in a "divine creator," and some of whom didn't.<br>  Humans decided what they are, and we've modified them considerably over the years since the founding of our nation (when "human rights" only meant rights for white free male property owners, not any other race, women, indentured servants, or poor non-property owners).

Most people would say, for example, that psychopathic murderers should be locked up which is basically saying that society has a role over and above individuals.  Of course, one could say that there are no such thing as human rights - under materialism we are just fortuitously arranged collections of atoms, so that would be consistent.<br>  <br>  There are problems with a social basis for human rights.  Rights become more 'what society thinks is OK'.  So if your society puts you in a concentration camp, you don't really have a leg to stand on.  Makes me glad I live in a society where Christianity has historically had some sort of impact on the laws I am subject to...|`|Wx1PqjgBaa	Human rights are always based upon current understanding.  Thomas Jefferson owned slaves, and only white male land owners were fully citizens in his day.  Reason and empathy are the only tools we have.

wB3AbJyLaa	Even though slavery in some form was virtually universal in every human culture over centuries, it was the Christians who first came to the conclusion that it was wrong. The social historian writes: "Although it has been fashionable to deny it, anti-slavery doctrines began to appear in Christian theology soon after the decline of Rome and were accompanied by the eventual disappearance of slavery in all but the fringes of Christian Europe. When Europeans subsequently instituted slavery in the New World, they did so over strenuous papal opposition, a fact that was conveniently 'lost' from history until recently. Finally, the abolition of New World slavery was initiated and achieved by Christian activist." Christians began to work for abolition not because of some general understanding of human rights, but because they saw it as violating the will of God. Older forms of indentured servant-hood and the bond-service of Biblical times had often been harsh, but Christians abolitionists concluded that raced-based, life-long chattel slavery, established through kidnapping, could not be squared with Biblical teachings either in the Old Testament or the New. Christian activist such as William Wilberforce in Great Britain, John Woolman in America, and many, many others devoted their entire lives, in the name of Christ, to ending slavery. They slave trade was so tremendously lucrative that there was enormous incentive within the church to justify it. Many church leaders defended the institution. The battle for self-correction was titanic. When the abolitionists finally had British society poised to abolish slavery in their empire, planters in the colonies foretold that emancipation would cost investors enormous sums and the prices of commodities would skyrocket catastrophically. This did not deter the Abolitionists in the House of Commons. They agreed to compensate the planters for all free slaves, a astounding sum up to half of British government's annual budget. The Act of Emancipation passed in 1833, and the costs were so high to the British people that one historian called the British abolition of slavery "voluntary econocide."|`|yHfsHp6naa	Repression and the perpetuation and acceptance of ignorance.|`|DxqhcUvWaa	The answer depends on your definition of Christianity.  Fifty or sixty years ago, when the Christianity was spoken about some one then it was a person who was saved, not gay, and living according to the precepts of what the Bible calls the fruits of the Spirit.<br>  <br>  Today Christianity has a very lose interruption.  When someone in the news media sits back and calls the United States Army "Christian" then there is a problem.<br>  <br>  To answer your question, Christianity has lost its effectiveness so it really has little effect on the culture of today.  According to the Bible, as this effectiveness diminishes, then the closer we get to what is referred to as the end times, when according to the book of Revelation, a lot of horrible things are going to happen on this earth.<br>  <br>  However, the end time can be postponed by the people turning back to God.|`|PoTwN4mmaa	It gives peoples morals to live by.<br>  For example a teen is about to steal an ipod from a store.

".<br>  <br>  "En un parte Martirio discretamente le llama a Amelia"  you have two errors.  Instead or "parte" it should be "aparte".  "Parte" translates into "part".  "Aparte" translates into "apart" meaning  "away" or "in a separte place" in the context you are using the word.  Its when you call somebody away from other people to tell her some kind of secret. <br>  <br>  A second mistake is that the "le" before "llama" should be deleted, omitted.  The correct way for the whole thing is:  "En un aparte, Martirio discretamente llama a Amelia. . . .".<br>  <br>  Regarding your third question, you may say "means" in more than one way.  Using your example ("by saying this she means that. . . "), it translates into Spanish like this: " Al decir esto (or eso), ella quiere decir que. . ."  But your could also convey exactly the same by saying in Spanish:  "Lo que ella quiere decir es que . . . ".  Two ways of saying exactly the same thing.  OK?  I hope I hellped you.

It is in our music, on TV, in the movies and books.<br>  <br>  Then there is our pride.  When someone hurts us, we want to strike back anyway we can.  So when we add evil, free will and pride together then we have a recipe to do what comes natural, self defense--which leads to revenge.<br>  <br>  But God teaches us to fill our lives with things that are good for us.  He wants us to live according to His Word.  When the urge to seek revenge comes upon us, He wants us to give it over to Him.  He will seek revenge in His own time.<br>  <br>  Ultimately all evil will be punished.  Some will get their just reward on earth and in eternal life, some just in eternal life.<br>  <br>  Let it go!!  Do not give up your happiness over the wrong someone else has done to you.|`|2YWKeJ6Aaa	"vengeance is mine"<br>  <br>  does that ring a bell?<br>  <br>  Romans 19 Beloved, never avenge yourselves, but leave room for the wrath of God; for it is written, "Vengeance is mine, I will repay, says the Lord."|`|jyEE16yPaa	Hate is what you are looking at...

But in the end, it's really about what feels good. If something isn't working, you'll know. Like most things, there isn't one that is TOTALLY better or more acurate than the others.

bndE2CXoaa	It does have a meaning.  I only close with "Yours" without any other word (sincerely, truly, etc.) when I want to convey to that woman (I'm a man) some sort of intimacy.  It means "I feel that I am yours", or "I'm here for you", but in a special way.  For example, I wouldn't close with a plain "Yours" if I'm writing to another man.  Do you understand what I mean?  I does carry or convey a special feeling or a special relation.  In fact, it really is an invitation for her to "feel that I'm hers".  Naturally, it takes kind of sensibility to grasp the meaning, something you scarcely find in Americans.  It takes to know some other culture besides American ways, which are not so classy.  Adian.|`|GWRP3vLQaa	I wouldn't waste time trying to parse his meaning. If he likes you, he should give you better clues. Like ask you out.

VRl1jENHaa	First, let me state that I'm a non-denominational, Evangelical Christian.<br>  <br>  I would be in favor of laws prohibiting gays from being fired due to their sexual orientation.  I believe that ALL discrimination should be equally addressed within the law, and apparently this aspect of discrimination has not been outlawed at the Federal level.  I would think that amending existing workplace discrimination laws should take care of the situation.|`|o9Ckf0h4aa	I don't think people should be able to be fired for being gay.As long as they aren't hitting on straight people.This could bring a sexual harrassment suit on them.But, people should/must be allowed to make a living wage-no matter what.|`|KVBTtF9faa	Yeah, there should be ANTI-discrimination laws protecting homosexuals. Who you take to bed and what you do in your bedroom is no one else's business, certainly not your bosses!|`|HccAZ61waa	Yes, homosexual persons should have totally equal rights as any other person.<br>  <br>  <br>  I would like to see the ignorant bigots fired though.|`|G9dZN8omaa	I think gays should be entitled to the same protection laws that any other minority is entitled to.|`|7xkwE3X9aa	Yes, because some people just can't seem to have an open mind and will do anything to keep things the way they like it.|`|AA10565336	Just where is this stuff going to stop?  I am missing a finger, can I have a law too?<br>  <br>  A couple were acquitted of engaging in sex at Disney World a few years ago.  Good lord every little piddlyassed thing has to be legislated.<br>  <br>  The one I really love is "Hate Crime".  I guess if I commit murder and the victim is of the same ethnic persuasion as I am that it is actually a "Love Crime".  And by the way, when was the last time a minority was charged with a "Hate Crime"???<br>  <br>  Employers are already leaving states for taxes, for EPA non-sense, they endure quotas, so heII yes, lets hang another piece of non-sense on them.  While we are at it, why not a quota?<br>  <br>  An employer has to tip toe everywhere he goes, this would be just one more reason to take his company over seas.  Of course I guess we could outlaw that while we are protecting the job of yet another minority.|`|a1d5a62697a27a23c7c47a959f58ee7baa	I think there should be a law against this kind of prejudice.  I happen to work in an industry where there are a fair number of gay men and lesbians, and everyone seems to be used to that, so I haven't seen anti-gay prejudice in my office.<br>  <br>  But I remember a couple of gay kids in my high school who got teased unmercifully just for being different.  They would have gladly been straight or pretended to be straight if they could have, I think - but they stood out, and the bullies targeted them.  It was really an ugly scene, and I don't think things like that should happen to anyone. It's uncompassionate and unfair.  <br>  <br>  So I think there should be laws to prevent anti-gay discrimination in the USA, just as there are laws preventing discrimination on the basis of race, religious belief and gender (male or female).|`|t88527U1aa	For it, no one should be discriminated against because of sin.<br>  Marriage is what most Christians are taking hard line approach on.|`|CCa9kRHHaa	If someone were fired for being gay, they could probably sue.|`|AA11923447	I support gay rights. Yes, there should be a law against discriminating against people based on their sexuality.|`|q5rTjkjgaa	they should have as much protection as other minorities it is pretty sad that they do that for gays but a mexican not even from here comes here and is looked up more to than a gay man or woman not in my book but whatever our government is so whacked up right now its not even funny|`|AwhrUGxHaa	Your question seems to be based on the assumption that sexual orientation is a "protected status" under the law like race, gender, or religion.  Without that protected status, anti-homosexual discrimination laws are just "special rights."  Some states assigns sexual orientation protection under the law and others don't.<br>  <br>  That said, I think that people should be decent to each other, but I don't think that you can legislate something like that without that protected status.  To effect such a change where it doesn't exist (assuming that you don't get a universal bestowal of protected status), it would be far more fruitful to work on changing people's perceptions.  That takes a long time, but it may work better than legislation.<br>  <br>  Cheers!<br>  <br>  ?2009  SinisterMatt.

NQ3eETlYaa	Well, it was a dream, but it didn't happen.<br>  <br>  Okay. So, I was at a Starbucks and a few hot guys came up to me and sat down. We all sipped our drinks in silence, but then one guy, who was sitting next to me, kissed me. I dropped my drink and wrapped my arms around his neck. The other two guys started kissing, too. Then, for some reason, everyone stopped. <br>  <br>  I crawled under the table and found that these guys wore nothing but boxers with shirts, so I anxiously pulled their boxers down. All of them were totally horny, so I started to suck one guy off. The other two started to jack each other, and soon c.um was flying everywhere. <br>  <br>  Again, the guy and I, as well as the other two, started to kiss passionately once more.<br>  <br>  I nearly bawled when I woke up to my alarm.|`|iz5zDFxvaa	I have had some wonderful dreams in the past, but there were a few dreams I've had in which I was getting it on with a few straight people that I've been having the hots for for a while.

They are looking towards outward things to fill the gap.  Even our schools focus on protecting a child's self esteem with ever mentioning one way to build real self-esteem.  We focus more on results and overlook dishonesty.  We spend more time looking for someone or something else (such as circumstances, parenting, misfortunes, other people, etc.) to attach blame to rather than simply saying "I was wrong", "It's my fault", or "It's my responsibility".
YQrKQ5PAaa	I got a surprise birthday party on my 4th birthday. It was cinderella themed and it was amazing. I remember walking out into my grandma's living room and the table was all set and there were streamers hanging around.

621a4d17d13b63e02ffc57e463e95ed2aa	The Jewish religion, or Judaism, is an ancient religion that goes back thousands of years and is still practiced today by millions of Jewish people. The Jewish religon is a record of the Jewish people from the beginning of recorded time thousands of years ago, beginning with the 5 books of Moses. The first book is Genesis, about the beginning of the universe, Adam and Eve, and their immediate descendents that lead to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. God changed Jacob's name to Israel and Israel had twelve sons. These twelve sons ended up in slavery in Egypt for hundreds of years and became the 12 tribes of Israel, named after these 12 sons. In Exodus the next book in the Bible, The Israelites left, or made an"exodus" from Egypt and formed their own nation, which was ancient Israel, populated by the 12 tribes of Israel. For the next 1000 years or so, the history of Israel is recorded in the other books listed in the Old Testament, before the time of Jesus Christ. Like many nations, the ancient Israelites had to fight to maintain their independence, sometimes thriving and growing, like under King David and his son King Solomon, or being invaded by outside nations like the Babylonians, Assyrians and Persians, all of whom carried them away into slavery. Eventually, only two of the tribes returned to their ancient homeland, the land of Abraham, Isaac and Israel. Supposedly 10 of the tribes went elsewhere, becoming the "10 lost tribes of Israel". Then, 14 generations after King David, a successor to the genealogical line of Kings David and Solomon was born and that was Jesus. This is where the Old Testament, the book of the Jewish religion, ends, and where the New Testament, the book of Christian religion begins. <br>  <br>  Supposedly, Jews are still waiting for their "messiah" or savior to come. They believe in the same God as Christians believe in, but they just aren't quite sure that Jesus was and / or is the Savior they were waiting for, for hundreds of years.  That's why some persecute the Jews because they do not accept Jesus, and why others persecute them, just because they are already persecuted. Thousands and thousands of innocent Jews were murdered during World War II and the Holocaust, just for being Jewish. Since then, the surviving  Jewish people have regained their ancient homeland in the modern nation of Israel, after thousands of years.|`|RNKSq3iEaa	Just like any religion, it is very complex with a rich history, different sects, and many stories, rules and rituals. I suggest you skim through the Wikipedia article on it.<br>  <br>  Discrimination of Jewish people is absolutely wrong. In the beginning, they were persecuted for being the only monotheistic religion. After the rise of Christianity, they were blamed for killing Jesus. Hateful rumors abounded, accusing Jews of ridiculous things like killing babies and stealing from everybody.<br>  <br>  There is nothing 'wrong' with ethnic Jews nor religious Jews. They are just people like you or I.|`|KVBTtF9faa	The jewish religion predates christianity and islam. Actually, Jesus was jewish. The jewish religion, stemmed from Abraham, was the first monotheistic (believing in only ONE god) religion. The Torah is their holy book, which is the Old testament of the bible. The "new" testament is what jesus's followers wrote hundreds of years after his death. Yes, jews believe in god. Just one god. Not Jesus as a god. The main difference between jews and christians is that the christians believe that jesus was the messiah, and the jews believe that the messiah hasn't come yet. There are few other differences, like holidays and the jews celebrate the sabbath on Friday at sun down til Saturday at sun down, whereas the christians claim their sabbath on Sunday.|`|f522078ffdf8786fcab6f8023c6befbdaa	Let us use the famous story of Shammai, Hillel and the three converts (Shabbos 31) to demonstrate the fusion of Halacha and Aggadah,: A gentile once came to Shammai, and wanted to convert to Judaism. But he insisted on learning the whole Torah while standing on one foot. Shammai rejected him, so he went to Hillel, who taught him: "What you dislike, do not do to your friend. That is the basis of the Torah. The rest is commentary; go and learn!" Another gentile who accepted only the Written Torah, came to convert. Shammai refused, so he went to Hillel. The first day, Hillel taught him the correct order of the Hebrew Alphabet. The next day he reversed the letters. The convert was confused:"But yesterday you said the opposite!?" Said Hillel: "You now see that the Written Word alone is insufficient. We need the Oral Tradition to explain G-d's Word." A third gentile wanted to convert so he could become the High Priest, and wear the Priestly garments. Shammai said no, but Hillel accepted him. After studying, he realized that even David, the King of Israel, did not qualify as a cohen, not being a descendant of Aaron,<br>  <br>  ---------<br>  <br>  Contrary to what many are saying, Judaism has nothing at ALL to do with Jesus.<br>  <br>  The Tanakh (the Jewish Scriptures) lay out the requirements for the Messiah.  Since Jesus did not fulfill them, Jesus is entirely irrelevant to Judaism.|`|DArAz67Caa	they believe in God----but deny our savior----they also refuse to eat pork and what else----<br>  <br>  google is your friend---<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judaism" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judaism</a>|`|VryeGYNTaa	its a very complex religion.

They do not believe in a divine savior/messiah - the Jewish Messiah will be human, not divine.  <br>  <br>  Judaism is: the worship of G-d and G-d alone.

Black Africans started arriving in 1530 in America and we are responsible for the wealth and trade generated in this country, slavery was the #1 economic force that built this country, so regardless of whether or not it makes you uncomfortable, it is AMERICAN history and if you don't like that you can leave....|`|HlE44Bb9aa	yeah skrew that why is there no african irsih month<br>  <br>  <br>  no one cares about that history any more its years old.....why dont we  concentrate on they sweat shops with the asian slaves or they african kids being used as slaves no one cares about that any more its in the past <br>  <br>  lets change the future and learn more about whats going on now this year|`|TY9EKICcaa	Please just shut up because you obviously have no idea what you're talking about.|`|BYCLegzlaa	why didn't you just google this question? this is not the first time it has been asked.|`|d78ff3cbb60f0f30871e608a11a6fb47aa	There is a white history eternity.|`|qsSXUBt8aa	Every month is white history month.

When you learn about the findings and who found America, you hear about people who came here and found Virginia. You also hear about the Revolutionary War and different types of US presidents (which all before Obama have been White). You learn about people like Patrick Henry, George Washington, Benjamin Franklin, John F Kennedy, Franklin D Roosevelt, Thomas Jefferson, John Adams, Abraham Lincoln, Bill Clinton, Ronald Reagan, Richard Nixon etc..<br>  <br>  So to sum it all up, throughout the year in history you learn about the accomplishments of White Americans more than those of Asian, Black or Hispanic Americans.

Nowadays the dance is usually performed out of tradition, maintaining the older customs, and as part of the activities of "Trachtenvereine" (that is, societies which maintain traditional dress, songs and culture of earlier days).<br>  The traditional outfit for the Schuhplattler are the "Lederhosen", and they are a symbol of regional pride.<br>  The Schuhplattler is the oldest surviving European dance.|`|jdKTs3aHaa	How about you and and a student do a funny short German skit and make it educational too!|`|jxHIMep8aa	I don't know that we do anything here in Germany that is much different than what you do there.

Start by getting to know her and ask her to accept that. Then when you feel more confident and comfortable around her, get a little more physical. Like gently brushing her hand with your fingers or a hug first. Then it can progress from there and before you know it, you'll be in a full blown relationship with her. Make sense? Good luck.

Mnm35sjNaa	Predestination is a logical conclusion of causality.  Determinism is based on causality -- cause and effect.  If for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction, then future events can (conceivably) be extrapolated from the Big Bang onwards.  That is predestination.<br>  <br>  The problem with predestination is that it treats living beings the same as inanimate things.  It says that we are at the mercy of causality and that our existence and destiny is as calculable as the stars and stardust.<br>  <br>  Perhaps our collective destiny (extinction) is a foregone conclusion but our individual lives and destinies are anything but.<br>  <br>  Because we have free will.<br>  <br>  Until life came along, the universe was ENTIRELY inanimate and all events were physical and determined by cause and effect (causality).<br>  <br>  The advent of life is a milestone in the history of the universe because, for the first time, matter was animate: it had motility, moving about on its own power. Animate beings are clearly in a different class than inanimate things.<br>  <br>  As far as we know, human beings are the only creatures with both intelligence and freewill. Human intelligence allows us to understand, anticipate and use causality for our own purposes. We use it to: power our cities; communicate globally at the speed of light; collide subatomic particles; send men to the moon and unmanned probes beyond our solar system.<br>  <br>  Consciousness is an emergent property of the brain. According to Wikipedia . . .<br>  <br>      "emergence is the way complex systems and patterns arise out of a multiplicity of relatively simple interactions".<br>  <br>  . . . the human brain is a complex system operating on relatively simple electro-chemical interactions.<br>  <br>  Those simple electro-chemical interactions create an electromagnetic (EM) field around the brain. We've used EEGs for decades to (crudely) measure changes in this field. But taking multiple, simultaneous, measurements INSIDE the brain, at distances of a millimeter apart, produces much richer and more useful data.<br>  <br>  Researcher Johnjoe McFadden has put forward a leading theory of consciousness called, "The Conscious Electro-Magnetic Information Field Theory" (CEMI Theory, for short). A key feature of this theory is that the brain's EM field is where the various and diverse activities of the brain are integrated. Once integrated, the EM field acts as a feedback loop which passes our integrated impulses and thoughts back for checking and decision-making. In other words, the feedback loop provides us with free will by allowing us to execute or withhold action depending on how we weigh our options and alternatives.<br>  <br>  Free will isn't absolute. It's constrained by physical laws, self-preservation, ethics, experience, knowledge and context. In the cases of instinct and reflex we have very little control at all.<br>  <br>  There appears to be a half-second delay between impulse or thought and their corresponding actions. The human brain is an incredibly efficient and optimized system. Certain impulses or thoughts (i.e. "stand up now") are almost always appropriate, so it might be optimal to initiate action before the feedback loop comes back with a decision. In these cases, it would look as if action begins a half-second before its corresponding decision. This is not material evidence of a deterministic brain . . . just an optimized one. If, a half-second later, we decide (for some unusual reason) not to stand up after all, we simply stop in mid-effort and sit back down.<br>  <br>  The determinism/free will/compatibilism debate has raged unabated and unresolved for 1600 years: ever since St. Augustine first fleshed out a doctrine of free will to make us responsible for our own actions and accountable to God. There's no proof for ANY position but I favor the compatibilist view that free will is compatible with determinism . . . that causality is a physical law we are able to harness for our own purpose.<br>  <br>  You are a free agent. You're free to accept responsibility for your actions. You're also free to deny responsibility. The choice is yours.|`|q6pHbdasaa	Libertarian free will denotes the ability to choose either of two (or more) options in a given senerio.  And so faced with the choice of converting to Christianity, for example, a person may choose to place his or her faith in Christ or a person may choose not to become a Christian.<br>  <br>  Compatibilistic free will denotes the ability to choose whatever one wants to choose.  In this sense, a person is free.  However, a person's choices are utimately determined by his or her greatest desires.  And so a person will find that he or she would rather either become a Christian or not, yet his or her desire to either convert or not convert is part of that person's current condition.  And so the persons choices are determined by their current condition.<br>  <br>  The Bible presents a non-competative view of human freedom and divine predestination.  I think this would rule out libertarian free will and force us to adopt a compatibilistic understanding of free will.<br>  <br>  That's my best effort to put it all together!|`|f522078ffdf8786fcab6f8023c6befbdaa	Predestination implies a conscious being which set everything in motion knowing the end result.<br>  <br>  Free will implies that consciousness voids causality (otherwise it wouldn't be free) and thus that it violates physical laws.<br>  <br>  Neither is correct.<br>  <br>  Predetermination is correct -- similar to predestination, the end is already written in stone, however, it is a consequence of each time-step prior, not a consequence of willful intent of an extrinsic being.

Go to church and pray. Cover yourself in prayer.<br>  <br>  Prayer: Lord, I cry out for help today for my brothers and sisters who are at this very moment struggling with their own individual fears. These fears are holding them back from accomplishing the very thing they were created to accomplish. I know You are standing in the gap for them before the throne of God, and You are calling out to them to come and lay their burdens down at Your feet. <br>  <br>  There is a great struggle going on for their freedom, and I know that this needs to be defeated, and they need to be set free to walk in the calling You have for them. I only know one way to combat these fears, and I cry out to You asking you to rescue them from the bondages that are holding them. You tell us often that we are to do what we need to do to remain free. You remind us often that fear is not to be our path, and we are to take a stand against that fear. You desire that we walk free to minister in Your Truths. We are to take a stand if we are being misled into thinking that we can or cannot do that which You are calling us to accomplish.<br>  <br>  We cannot allow fear to become our ruler. We are told to walk by faith, not by fear. I know as I pray that today is to be a day of breakthrough for someone. Today is a new opportunity to stand fast and be strong and courageous. Every day we are challenged to grow in our faith so that our faith will become pleasing to our God. It is through my brothers and sisters who labor in the harvest fields because of their faith, that our world is changing, and we are beginning to impact the lost and dying for Christ.<br>  <br>  I cry out to You today asking You to restore joy to Your people. Where you see people struggling and being burdened with fear, I ask You to meet them at the area of their greatest need, and "bind up the brokenhearted -- Isaiah 61:1. Where there was once sorrow and fear, I ask you to replace that sorrow and turn it into the oil of gladness.<br>  <br>  I recognize, my King, that many of us need to be spending some time with You in the wilderness, and many of us need to be released into a new and fresh season of fruit. I pray that as You look into the faces of my brother and sisters, You will create in them a new beginning and new dawning where all things become possible for them -- because of their faith in You. I ask You to give them determination and perseverance, and I ask You to look deep within them and get them to that sweet spot that You have reserved only for them.<br>  <br>  I pray for an increase of blessings in their lives, and a refreshment of hope for their weariness. Help them, Lord, to walk through this new doorway of possibilities, into a renewed and fully restored time of blessing. I pray they will be able to soar on eagle’s wings and ascend to the heights where their vision is increased and their faith and hope renewed – as it once was.<br>  <br>  Protect them from the attempts of Satan to get at them and counterfeit or confuse the Gospel truths in their lives. Give them a power that they have never before experienced, which will see them through to a new window of opportunity that only You can give them. It is in these moments of attack that I ask You to send out Your angels of power sending them to do battle for my brothers and sisters.<br>  <br>  You are Lord over all, and You offer your armor of protection for all of us. I claim that armor for my weary, discouraged and fear locked brothers and sisters. Help them to be obedient to You as You use these fears to build them into authentic spiritual leaders. Remind them of the power of obedience and the truth that allows them to be Christ--led and Christ--like. Help them to abide in You, and remind them that without faith it is impossible to please God, for he who comes to God must believe that He is, and that He is a rewarded of those who seek Him. May all we do bring you glory and honor! Amen.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  God bless you. Email me anytime!

So just tell them both and let it all out. And when they start doing it again when your hanging out just give a notice to them or mention something and they will most likely will realize and stop. Hope I helped you.|`|WoRaXE73aa	I think you are justified to put forth how you feel--they drastically abused your friendship and never thought twice! You are justified in voicing your anger in some way, via email or in a letter might be best. Written word may allow you to say everything that needs to be said without you getting interrupted by their protests. I would mail/send each of them a copy. You will feel better after saying what you need to say too. <br>  <br>  Mind you, this link is meant for a boyfriend/girlfriend type thing. But you should write a similar letter voiced just as strongly. Telling your friends to quit being so neglectful of your friendship.

xvxT46iJaa	Your lecturer probably means that your writing is too informal, and maybe you use too much slang as well. If you are writing your essays as if you are having a conversation with the person marking, you are writing how you speak.<br>  Try to use words you wouldn't use in a normal conversation "big" words that would sound strange if you are talking to someone. When i am writing an essay i use synonyms on microsoft word if i can't come up with an appropriate word, that doesn't sound too informal.

bTY7Ytdgaa	Alright, are you really going to let women tell you what a man is thinking? You better not, especially these feminist types, they just want you to be a lesbian. Remember, Feminism is the theory, Lesbianism is the practice.<br>  <br>  Anyhow...<br>  It sounds to me like he is interested in you. He is obviously flirting, but without knowing the guy's personality I couldn't tell you if he wanted a relationship or just to make noises in the bathroom with you. However, I would suggest going out on a date with him before inviting him to your apartment. That way you can get a feel for the situation.|`|G6Xcv1uhaa	Yeah, he likes you...just not in an appropriate manner. Seriously, if he only flirts with you using sexual puns, than he probably only wants you to do just that with- no relationship, just play around. I would say do not go for this guy, it seems like he only wants to use you for your body- and you deserve way better than that.|`|GWRP3vLQaa	He is not flattering you. He is sounding you out to see if you are receptive to having sex with him, nothing more. If you think otherwise, you are a fool. <br>  <br>  Men don't have to like women to want to have sex with them. It's just sex to them. If he really liked you he would respect you, not make crude sexual overtures. <br>  <br>  Sorry. Good luck.|`|6SwaWSoyaa	Don't fall for it!!!<br>  He is just trying to get some booty!!!<br>  Why on earth would a comment that gross and rude flatter you?|`|AA11788494	He just wants sex.  I would not pursue him because he will make you look like a fool at work.  Date someone outside of work.  You will regret it if you don't.  Everyone at work will make fun of you and think you are easy.  They stares and gossip will make you miserable.  Enjoy flirting but nothing more.|`|CmwlOJI9aa	since when does joking in sexual way considered to be a sign of liking others.<br>  <br>  Maybe you are flattered because you like him. <br>  it's your call if you want to invite him then go on....but as a friendly reminder no one should be flattered when someone jokes around that way|`|UAT38kYzaa	well maybe hes just being an 18year old boy.<br>  my younger brothers 19 and they make sexual jokes toward all my friends, hes just being funny and probably trying to get your attention. plus your an older woman, who doesn't want someone experienced its always funner.|`|9uI3hvGdaa	You should NOT be flattered.  He is disrespecting you.  He does NOT like you, he's just trying to get into your pants.  If you really think this guy likes you by making sexual remarks at work, then you really need to work on your self esteem.<br>  <br>  In addition, this is totally inappropriate for the workplace and you should report him to your supervisor.

I"m annoyed by people who do that. A ring is not some kind of magical thing that will ward off men who try to lure you into sexual intercourse. It's just jewelry for people who want to show off their "pureness".

But I don't need a purity ring to prove anything.|`|j2gtKnFdaa	I am a Christian, and I own a purity ring.<br>  <br>  It's just symbolic to a covenant between you and God to remain pure mentally, physically, and spiritually.<br>  <br>  I encourage you to get one only if you are serious about the covenant. <br>  <br>  Hope I helped :)|`|Qu1nTLz4aa	I don't know. <br>  <br>  Is being celibate going to make you marry younger?

Remember that when you say "ellos", it could be that all of them are males or that there are males and females.  If it is a group of females and no males, then it must be "ellas se fueron" in case you want to use the pronoun.  Good luck.

Since the 18th century this has been used as a salutation to offer the hope that a happy day being marked would recur many more times. It is now primarily used on birthdays; prior to the mid 19th century it was used more generally, at any celebratory or festive event.<br>  <br>  Current usage is often as a more formal option than 'Happy Birthday'. It is also often to be found on greetings cards.<br>  <br>  Its earliest attributable use was by Lady Newdigate in a letter written in 1789 (and published in Newdigate-Newdegate Cheverels in 1898)[1]:<br>  <br>      "Many happy returns of ye day to us my Dr Love."

JZxZ8mKRaa	WTIM68 -<br>  <br>  I went back to every verse you cited to look at the Greek.<br>  <br>  What I found was that in almost every instance it was in the possessive case - which makes it hard to compare one to one.<br>  <br>  In Luke 1:75, the word "God" or "god" was not even in the verse.<br>  <br>  And in verse John 1:18, it follows exactly what the NWT did, with one instance being translated "God" and the next instance being properly translated "a god".<br>  <br>  Could you clarify?|`|tx4bRDrXaa	That is correct.|`|v7G1dmgXaa	Although this has been a topic many times, and the reasoning has been explained,,,,,,,,,,,,,"A God" is correct.<br>  At the time, the term "A" couldn't be used. As a term, it hadn't begun to be used.<br>  Note also that until his death, Jesus used his father's powers. After that; Jehovah gave him life within himself as a reward for his sacrifice.|`|iAXmdQOEaa	What they are talking about here is the Word.  The greek word for "word" is logos.  Logos means, "plans, reasons, thoughts".   So the "word" in this verse is God's thoughts and plans.   Then in verse 14 it talks about how the Word or God's plans became flesh.   But the "word" in verse 1 is not Jesus like some people think.  You need to look up the words in the correct lanuage first before you try to understand them.  Its a beautiful verse though.  Talking about the plans and thoughts of God.  It proves that Jesus was in God's plans right from the beginning.|`|RspbqyzDaa	95% of all bibles say that the Word was God.<br>  <br>  go to biblegateway.com   and tell me how many bibles say that the Word was a god.<br>  <br>  Saying that the Word was a god goes against the 1st commandment.|`|fdb2eb2f4c9344e092dc65cdb24a9c1eaa	Jewish rabbis often referred to God, especially in His more personal aspects, in terms of His word. They spoke of God Himself as "the word of God." For example, ancient Hebrew editions of the Old Testament change Exodus 19:17 (Moses brought the people out of the camp to meet God) to "Moses brought the people out of the camp to meet the word of God."<br>  <br>  The Greek philosophers saw the logos as the power which puts sense into the world, making the world orderly instead of chaotic. The logos was the power that set the world in perfect order and kept it going in perfect order. They saw the logos as the "Ultimate Reason" that controlled all things.<br>  <br>  So, in this opening, John says to both Jews and Greeks: "For centuries you’ve been talking, thinking, and writing about the Word (the logos). Now I will tell you who He is." John meets both Jews and Greeks where they are at, and explains Jesus in terms they already understood.<br>  <br>  Note: There are other translations older than the Coptic.  The fact is that if the New World Translation were honest and consistent, they would translate "God" as "god" every place it appears without the article. But it seems that this grammatical rule only applies when it suits the purpose of backing up the doctrinal beliefs of the Watchtower. The Greek text of Matthew 5:9, 6:24, Luke 1:35 and 1:75, John 1:6, 1:12, 1:13, and 1:18, Romans 1:7 and 1:17, shows how the Watchtower translates the exact same grammar for "God" as "God" instead of "god" when it suits their purpose.<br>  <br>  To Angel: The equation underlying the Witness rendering breaks down in John 1:18 which contains theos (God) twice, without “the” either time. According to Watchtower assumptions, we would expect to translate both as “god” or “a god.” Instead, the New World Translation says “God” the first time and “god” the second time. The context overrules their rule. To conform to standard Greek grammar.  it was normal practice to omit “the” in this type of sentence. John was simply using good grammar, and making it clear that he intended to say, “The Word was God” rather than “God was the Word,” a statement with some theological drawbacks. John constructed his sentence in the one way that would preserve proper grammar and sound doctrine, declaring that “the Word was God.” Which is why every other translation says that.<br>  <br>  The deity of Christ is the central point of the Scriptures. It clearly teaches that Christ is God. The teachings of the Jehovah’s Witness' concerning Jesus Christ clearly contradict the teachings of the Bible. Passages such as Philippians 2:5-11 tell us that Jesus Christ, who existed as God, took the bodily form of a humble servant so that He could die on the cross in our place.

The wages of sin is death (Romans 6:23), so Christ had to literally die as payment for those sins. When Christ was raised by the Father, it was as though He was being begotten; thus, He is referred to as God's "only begotten Son," and the "firstborn."<br>  <br>  familyradio.com|`|3a9f326d01ff48571ab8b07403c16d21aa	John 1<br>     1In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.<br>  <br>  The Trinity in the beginning was just prophecy until Jesus was born.|`|db7df25ea31227e5641d5c32d43c3bcdaa	the firstborn from the dead of humans<br>  <br>  <br>  he was the first to be raised in a physical eternal body|`|QjlWEapVaa	Sister,<br>  <br>  First of all, Lazarus was risen from the dead, but eventually have to die again.  The Lord Jesus Himself is the resurrection (John 11:25), and in Him is the resurrection life that overcomes death.  Therefore when death operates on Him, He overcame it.  The Lord raise people from the dead (and so do some of his disciples) but they were not instances of resurrection.  Only the Lord was resurrected from the dead, therefore He is the firstborn from the dead (Col. 1:18)<br>  <br>  He is also the firstborn of all creation (Col. 1:15) which means that He has the first place or the preeminence in creation.<br>  <br>  Another portion reveals that He is the Firstborn among many brothers (Rom. 8:29).  He was the only begotten of the Father in John 3:16.  Here in His resurrection, He became the firstborn in His uplifted humanity and all the believers in Christ were begotten to be His many brothers.  Hallelujah!  That's why the Lord in resurrection told Mary, "go to My brothers and sat to them, I ascend to My father and your Father, and My God and your God".  Before this, the most intimate term that the Lord used to address his disciple is "friend".<br>  <br>  Yes, the Trinity existed from eternity to eternity.  We should not understand the word Firstborn in a natural or human way.  Firstborn in Colossians imply preeminence in time and in His position.  Firstborn in Romans reveals His accomplishment through His death and resurrection.  He was begotten as Firstborn on the day of resurrection (Acts 13:33) to be Firstborn in the new creation.  As believers in Christ, we are part of the new creation as His many brothers.  This doesn't mean that He does not exist before this but that the humanity that He put on in His incarnation was begotten the Son of God.  Therefore after he ascended, He is both referred to as the Son of God and the Son of Man.  What does this have to do with us?  This is something glorious because we are being conformed to His image.  He is the prototype, the Firstborn and we the ones follow, exact duplicate in life and nature but not in His Godhead.|`|XCrkjoQQaa	you got it all wrong! search for the word "trinity" from the entire Bible you cannot find that word. why? because there is no such word in the Holy Bible. our Lord Jesus Christ is the only begotten Son of the Father (John 1:1-5). please read Proverbs 8:22-36. it is too long to be written here just read it from your Bible. it says in verse 22 "The LORD possessed me at the beginning of His way, Before His works of old." the word "LORD" refers to the FATHER or GOD or ELOHIM in Hebrew word. our Lord Jesus Christ is the Wisdom of God as in 1 Corinthians 1:24 "but to those who are the called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God." Christ is also the Word of God: Revelation 19:13 "And He is clothed with a robe dipped in blood; and His name is called The Word of God." Who shed His blood for the forgiveness of sins? He is our Lord Jesus Christ.<br>  Lazarus was not resurrected he was awaken by our Lord Jesus Christ or rather Lazarus was made alive from the physical death. but he was not resurrected  our Lord Jesus Christ did that in order for the Jews who were around may believe that the Father did sent Him (Jesus Christ). please read John 11:41-43. i thank you for this question so that you may be cleared about the contents of the Holy Bible.|`|2zYCQX9saa	JESUS IS THE FIRSTBORN OF ALL CREATION. <br>  "Who is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of every creature:"<br>  (Colossians 1:15)<br>  <br>  HE IS THE FIRSTBORN AMONG MANY BRETHREN! <br>  "For whom he did foreknow, he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brethren."<br>  (Romans 8:29)<br>  <br>  HE IS THE FIRSTBORN FROM THE DEAD.

For the earnest expectation of the creature[CREATION] WAITETH FOR THE MANIFESTATION OF THE SONS OF GOD. For the creature was made subject to vanity, not willingly, but by reason of him who hath subjected the same in hope, BECAUSE THE CREATION ITSELF ALSO SHALL BE DELIVERED FROM THE BONDAGE OF CORRUPTION INTO THE GLORIOUS LIBERTY OF THE CHILDREN OF GOD.

And not only they, but ourselves also, which have the firstfruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for the adoption, to wit, the redemption of our body.<br>  <br>  Then after every enemy has been put down, Jesus will turn it all over to the father that God may be ALL in ALL.<br>  <br>  "And when all things shall be subdued unto him, then shall the Son also himself be subject unto him that put all things under him, that God may be all in all."<br>  (I Corinthians 15:28)|`|7Y7WVMUoaa	The Man Jesus, is the first born of the dead!

Seems like it should be common sense and common teaching to me. The part that is tough to handle is that our natural instinct is to be immensly private about such things.  Much like taking a poo.  <br>  <br>  Which is worse, doing the willy daily for years by yourself or getting knocked up and STD's for a simple one-night stand with a stranger.  Which one do you think God is going to punish.|`|PXnn6LoPaa	It's natural.  It feels good.  You're supposed to do it.  It's nature's stress relief.  Even sometimes babies do it, and they are completely free from any corruption, so it's got to be okay.I have a friend who is 30 years old and catholic and he never masturbates and never has had sex and he started having prostate problems and his dr. told him he NEEDS to do it- that's what's causing his problems!  There ya go!|`|hXQnR2Scaa	It is not a sin. Nor is "lust". It is all part of your natural urge for relief of sexual tension.<br>  <br>  It is healthy and safe, if a bit lonely sometimes.<br>  <br>  It does harm to no one and helps you feel better.<br>  That simply CAN'T be a sin.|`|d0945a07b59dce3ca7393bc610216aa9aa	It's natural, it's healthy, it's normal, it's perfectly okay.|`|mVsWyu0yaa	The whole nonsense of 'masturbation' being a sin is based on a misreading of the biblical Onan myth. When Onan was commanded by Yahweh to 'raise up children' in his dead brothers name, he refused...and resorted to withdrawal before emission (coitus interruptus).  For this act of disobedience he was, allegedly, struck down by Yahweh.  Ever since Christians have confused 'coitus interruptus' with 'masturbation'. <br>  There is not a single word in Scripture that deals with 'masturbation'.<br>  <br>  p.s. Science has determnied that men who masturbate frequently are at less risque for prostate cancer than men who do not masturbate. I think it makes more sense to listen to doctors than desert goat herders.|`|LF4vun1maa	It's not a sin because there is no such thing as sin.<br>  <br>  No one ever really explicitly defines sin.  It's things against the will of God, supposedly, but since god isn't in the habit of making his will clear in practice it's things that an obsessive and controlling priest-caste wants to deny to you.  Whether you call your over-caste of priests "priests" or something else is irrelevant.<br>  <br>  There are crimes, selfish and hurtful actions, and dangerous behaviors... but it isn't any of those things either.|`|kdT4wVpyaa	I've thought that to myself before, but all the answers are inadequate.

In some religions such as islam, some consider it a sin because you are wasting your seeds. Masturbation is only allowed if you feel like you are going to commit adultry. Many people dont consider it a sin or taboo, they just do it because it is a natural thing i guess and it  is considered healthy.|`|FATyhyZ2aa	I think the "sin" feature derived from Genesis 38:6-10.  Tamar had lost her husband.  It was the custom of the time that the brother of the deceased should impregnate the widow so that his brother's name shall have an heir.  Well, it was Onan's turn to do this, but he didn't want to make a baby that wasn't going to be his, so he pulled out and finished his business on the outside without Tamar's knowledge.  The God of the Israelites found this evil in His sight and killed Onan.  /  Some took this to mean that spilling seed outside a woman was evil.  But the point was that Onan was using deception to make Tamar think she could have a baby.  Wasting her time when she could be w/ another brother & giving her false hope.  THAT was the evil, the deception.|`|y7qJayDVaa	THe act isnt but thinking about stuff and desring(lust) is the part that is the sin.|`|oSMw5NFJaa	Masturbation is not a sin.

She might not even know what to say, you probably caught her completely off guard. You need alittle more experience in life to be able to fall in love and maintain a long term relationship.  Give yourself time you will find someone who will feel the same way about you before you know it.As for the lesbian part you put yourself out there and I hope that your friend respects you enough not to tell everyone and things get really hard for you.stay strong and believe in yourself you are a good person and will find love one day.|`|Vu726Q18aa	11? your older than me when i found out i was bisexual, just tell her it wasnt a joke, although you are just 11 and to her she maybe felt you were just curious|`|fpQKXynsaa	I hope you are sure about this... hahaha its a big step.<br>  She probably laughed at you because you are really young..

89a4e35709fd20d8fa340ef1d5a3bac3aa	Salam for you. Allah ( the only one God) created mankind to serve Him because Allah wants to know who are obedient and who are disobedient. Allah tested us but Allah gives us the life guides e.g the Qur'an and Hadith.Allah gives us free choice but we should know its cosequences as stated in the Qur'an and explained in the Hadith..<br>  All angels,good jinns, Adam and Eve obeyed to the command of Allah except bad jinns or syaitans for kneel down to Allah.<br>  So if we disobeyed the life guides we will make cruelty to ourselves and as its consequence we will be punished in the hell.|`|TBZK5q78aa	God created mankind because he is a beautiful artists. Why wouldn't he want humans around? Nobody enjoys eternal solitude. When we obey Yahweh we are blessed with his serenity. Satan attempts to beguile us away from Yahweh, but it is up to us to disdain the derogatory lies. Besides that, I love praising Yahweh with all my heart. He is awesome! I serve him because he's my father; and he loves me!<br>  <br>  God-bless!|`|4Rt7Mm8Aaa	Allah did not create us to serve Him. We were created to worship Allah. This life is a test. Allah has created us to be Viceregents on His earth, and to test us. Allah is not in need of our worship, nor does He benefit from recieving our worship. This is why the entire earth is not Muslim, as Allah is not in need of anyone's rememberance. If everyone were to become a Muslim, Allah would not be any stronger, and if no one were to be Muslim, Allah would not become any weaker. This is because Allah is perfect and absolute. It is said, that the day of judgement will only come when the Muslims have died, and it will only come upon the worst of people. We are not in a position to question Allah's motives, or assume what Allah thinks. Rather it is us that need to remember that we will be questioned before Allah about how we lived, and what we did and did not do.|`|g8JGLnk6aa	Because he's got a narcissistic deity complex.|`|AXqmo8rlaa	Most people think that God is like the owner of the tree--impatient and ready at any time to cut us down, but He is not. God is like the vineyard-keeper--always seeing some glowing potential in even the worst of us. God has every right and every reason to be as frustrated with us as that man was with his fruitless fig tree, but His eternal patience far outweighs His frustration. No, it is more than patience. <br>  <br>  It is not in Jesus' parables that we really come to see God as the One who patiently nurtures and cares for us and wants what is best for us. The stories only illustrated--Jesus demonstrated. When He was hanging on the cross, do you suppose anyone asked, "Why Him?" Did they discuss whether or not His sins were greater than those of any other Galilean? Did they ask, as they did in another instance, whether He suffered because of His own sins or those of His parents? <br>  <br>  He suffered because of your sins. He died because of my sins. He rose because God always has potentials where everyone else only has dead ends. It is God's love, grace, mercy and compassion that put back into dead sinners the glow of love once lost. It is His unbelievable expectation of us that holds the possibilities for us.|`|GYwLGjt2aa	well this has been ask. for years. well i belive god made people to expand theglobe.why> would god not want people on earth.yes we do have to serve him. because if it was not for him, well we would't have wht we have today.i aalso belive  our father in heaven loves life and yes hes the maker of man kind.we onley go by whats in the bible.i'mean stop and think about it. do you kno some one else that god make the earth in 7 dasys, i don't.he really must so poeerful to do what he does.think? about it. if there no humans on earth. what would our plant be like. probbley boreing. so to asnwer ur question. for us o learn and grow, fill the planet with every color of the race for all of us to live in peace.|`|aRaMjnQ1aa	"{Remember] when your Lord extracted from the loins of Adam's children and their descendents and made them testify [saying] : 'Am I not your Lord?' They said: 'Yes, we testify to it.' [This was] in case you say on the Day of Judgment: 'We were unaware of this.' Or you say: 'It was our ancestors who worshipped others besides God and we are only their descendents. Will you then destroy us for what those liars did?' " The Holy Qur'an, Chapter 7, Verses 172-3 The Prophet(pbuh) explained that when Allah created Adam, He took from him a covenant at a place called Na'maan on the 9th day of the 12th month. He then extracted from Adam all of his descendents who would be born until the end of the world, generation after generation, and spread them out before Him to take a covenant from them also. He spoke to them, face to face, making them bear witness that He was their Lord. Consequently, every human being is responsible for belief in God, which is imprinted on each and every soul. It is based on this inborn belief that Allah defined the purpose of humankind's creation: <br>  "I have created the jinn and humankind only for My worship" The Holy Qur'an, Chapter 51, Verse 56 <br>  Thus, the essential purpose for which humankind was created is the worship of God. However, the Almighty is not in need of human worship. He did not create human beings out of a need on His part. If not a single human worshipped God, it would not diminish His glory in any way, and if all mankind worshipped Him, it would not increase His glory in any way. God is perfect. He alone exists without any needs. All created beings have needs. Consequently, it is humankind that needs to worship God. <br>  <br>  <br>  Very Informative link, helpful<br>  <a href="http://www.thetruecall.com/home/modules.php?name=News&file=article&sid=78" rel="nofollow">http://www.thetruecall.com/home/modules....</a>|`|HlE44Bb9aa	we are his kids ...so he must have wanted kids.<br>  he when we were little our parents did the same to us or you do it 2 if ur a parent....<br>  have you not asked your child to get you something when your to lazy to get it or run to the car for something (you get the point) the same way older kids do it to their younger brothers or sisters..<br>  <br>  and god is great he can do what he wants any way..<br>  or he just got bored and is using us in a game to amuse him i dont no <br>  <br>  and it makes him happy when we do what he wants ...the same way our parents do or bro/sis..<br>  <br>  get it? i hope that makes sence ??any way its god no one really knows but u will when you die i suppose so untill then we just have to keep guessing|`|NlQhkgFCaa	It's for our own benefit, to develop ourselves spiritually and most importantly to get closer to the One who is the source of all Peace - my beloved Allah|`|FZaaKl0Haa	He didn't create us to serve Him.

I want to see that answers!|`|AA10237299	God did not create man to serve him. He created man in his likeness<br>  both physical and spirit to have fellowship with him. The angels were created to serve God. Man is not equal with God. Many religions of the<br>  far east teach that man can become like God or equal to him. This is<br>  not true, so does new age teaching apply this lie. I wanted to throw that part in. We do serve God out of love for him though for who and what he is. We serve him by doing what he wants from us. We can<br>  never satisfy God because he is perfect all almighty. It is only by<br>  his son Jesus Christ can we come to God with out fear of seperation.<br>  Jesus said, he is the only way to the Father, and he and the Father are<br>  one and the same. Jesus gave up his throne and kingdom to become<br>  mortal for a moment to become human flesh, a sacrifice to appease<br>  the sin that we created in the beginning. That sin was disobedience to God. God is perfect, without sin, he cannot and will allow sin in heaven.<br>  That is why Christ died for you, so your sin, that you inherated, that has been passed down from the 2 original parents can be wiped clean from you. No good work, can earn your way to heaven. Only asking Christ into your life and forgiving your past sins is the only way. Sin likes to hide in darkness, but Christ brings light to the world in all of us to expose the sin and bring it out to the light. You dont need to ask  on here or any mortal person. Ask God yourself, he will answer trust me. He loved you enough to have died for you and wants you with him<br>  forever in heaven. Also, we should put God first in our lives, that means<br>  nothing comes first. God doesnt want luke warm people. He wants<br>  people who are on fire for him, in other words, he wants people with<br>  excitement in their heart. Read King David in Old Testament, it will <br>  show you why God himself called Davind a man who is his friend and<br>  after God's heart even though David sinned greatly against God.|`|Eos7bQKRaa	a god by definition is perfect and whole. for a god needing his creations to worship him, praise him, obey him, suggests that he is imperfect. God can be angered by my wrong actions, if he was perfect i would not have any impact on him no mater what i do. The concept of god is self contradictory and shows its human origin.God is a human invention.|`|H8WqMK1eaa	Honestly, by saying that Allah merely created humans to worship him, submit to him, and to test them, it makes him sound like an arrogant, egotistical, megalomaniac.<br>  <br>  God is the Creator, right?  And what do creators do?  They design and plan and create.  God is, in an essence, a divine artist.  He created us for the mere joy of creating.  He created beings who He could have a relationship with and who would have faith in and trust in Him.  He loves us just as a mother or father loves their own flesh-and-blood children.<br>  <br>  Why do people have children?  For the sheer joy of it.  I did not have children because I wanted someone to obey me and fear me and follow a huge set of rules.  I had children for the only reason to love them...and be loved in return.<br>  <br>  How could God create such a relationship between a parent and child and yet not have such a  magnificent relationship with His own creation?
bojIKJMNaa	Maybe you should talk to a doctor or a psychologist. Maybe you have social anxiety or something!|`|jSPj3S6faa	You are completely entitled to the feelings that you have.  This condition can easily be attributed to changes in your brain chemistry either due to genetics or environment.<br>  <br>  Consult a medical professional who can then refer you to a mental health professional.

It seems to me you have an anxiety, do not worry there is no reason this cant be changed. Maybe it isnt the people that cause this tension, it could easily be that the enviroment you are in is uncomfortable for you. Ask yourself, what was different from back in the day to the present time. The difference maybe the answer! Find people that you can connect with, have common interest; it makes for easier conversation. Good luck

AA10311549	There is NO reason why GAY MARRIAGE should not be allowed in ALL states!  The "sanctity of marriage" means many different things to many different people.  We can also talk about the sanctity of life.  But we do not preserve this sanctity by denying it to a select group of people.  <br>  <br>  To only allow Civil Unions and NOT marriage is to tell gays that they MUST be only recognized as second class citizens.  That they are NOT allowed full rights of citizenship under the law.<br>  <br>  To deny MARRIAGE TO GAYS is to state that the their most loving, committed, self-sacrificing relationship is NOT worthy of the same respect and regard as the most fleeting and casual marriage entered into by heterosexuals.<br>  <br>  To deny marriage to gays is stating to all the young gay teens growing up that NO we do NOT want to encourage you to have committed monagamous relationships.  That there is something so wrong with you that your relationships are not as worthy as any heterosexual relationship.<br>  <br>  You MUST ALSO consider what is happening in many states who have passed "definitions" of marriage amendments to exclude gays.  Some of the courts in these states are DENYING ANY rights to same sex partners IN SPITE of already existing laws to give them at least some of the rights gauaranteed to heterosexuals because they broadly interpret the "definition of marriage" amendments to indicate that the law should also NOT allow them any of the rights that married people would have.  In addition, in some states, some companies who had given same-sex partners some of the benefits they would give to heterosexual couples have been brought to court by some of those nice "loving" anti-gay groups to disallow the companies from doing this.  And some of the courts have declared in their favor.<br>  <br>  This so-called "protection of definition of marriage" is just another name for denying the full rights of citizenship under the law to gays.  Manure by any other name would still smell as bad.  This does NOT protect anything, it only denies to gays THE SAME RIGHTS GIVEN TO ALL HETEROSEXUALS.<br>  <br>  In 1967, the US Supreme Court stated the following in its decision in the case of Loving vs. Virginia:  “The freedom to marry has long been recognized as one of the vital personal rights essential to the orderly pursuit of happiness by free men.”  In 2003 the Massachusetts Supreme Court extended this right to marry the person of one’s choice to gay men and women.  Recently the State Supreme Courts of both CA and CN have agreed.  However, the good "loving" anti-gay constituants of CA have decided that gay people were NOT to be afforded the same rights under the law that heterosexuals enjoy.<br>  The effort to enact laws or constitutional amendments, defining marriage as only the union of one man and one woman, may at first thought seem both reasonable and common sense;  however, what is also does, is ignore the fact that 5 percent or more of our population are exclusively homosexual or lesbian, and to participate in this ‘marriage‘ they must necessarily marry a person of the same sex..  At one time, to enjoy the full rights of citizenship, one had to be a white male.  Fortunately, since then, new amendments and new laws have been enacted to allow more people to engage in their rightful place as ‘full’ citizens under the law.  But now it would appear that the new definition of a ‘full citizen’ now includes only heterosexuals, we see for the first time by law, an attempt to deny a significant portion of our population the full benefits of citizenship.  When enacted, these amendments restrict by law one’s right to marry the one they would fall in love with.<br>  <br>  Instead of "protecting" marriage, they are diluting it.  By denying ANYONE the right to marry damages the institution.  It does not "protect" it.  To ONLY allow "Civil Unions" is to state that marriage really does not matter.<br>  <br>  All those same "good" people out there who are trying to deny marriage to gays are the very same people who will then  complain that gay relationships do not last and that gays are too promiscuous.  They are the very people who SHOULD be promoting gay marrige in order to encourage committed relationships.<br>  <br>  How would you like it if the people in your state told YOU that you and your partner were not allowed to MARRY but only be CIVIL UNIONED?  That YOUR relationship was NOT worthy enough to be called marriage?  That YOUR relationship was not "good enough" to be compared to someone else's "marriage"?  This issue is about "civil rights" true.  But it is also MORE than a person's rights.  It is also about societies measue and regard of the committed relationships entered into by gay people.  And the perception given our vunerable gay youth about the value of any of their relationships.  You want young gay people to value loving committed monagamous relationships?  Then encourage then TO marry!  And call it marriage!<br>  <br>  Equality ALSO lies in the perception and not just the law!<br>  <br>  ======================================...<br>  THEONE78 do not DARE to pretend to be a Christian!  You are an intollerant bigot!  You want other people to respect your beliefs?  Well how about respecting ours!  You stated:  "but marriage is God's instituiton -- if gay's want to be with someone then have a civil union, but don't disgrace my God in the process and call it marriage."<br>  <br>  Marriage is NOT just God's institution.  It is just as much a societal institution.  Marriage existed before your religion was even a thought!  Do not disgrace MY God by your intollerate bigoted unjust judgment parading as "love."<br>  <br>  You state:  "Christians don't have a problem with gay people."<br>  <br>  Wel, YOU seem to have a big problem with JUSTICE and equality under the law!  . <br>  <br>  You add:  "don't change what my God has called Holy.. and don't bring your beliefs upon children."<br>  <br>  I will tell YOU the same thing.  Don't pretend to speak for MY God.  And do not dare spread your intollerant unloving ignoranceand bigotry any further and especially do not spread your poison rhetoric into the minds of children.   <br>  <br>  You stated:  "Do you ever see Christians cutting people's heads off for not siding with them.. we are peaceful .. but don't press the issue."<br>  <br>  Is that a threat?   Doesn't sound too peaceful to me.<br>  <br>  And read history, when institutional religion have had the temporal authority, including Christianity, they DID execute people they declared as "heretics."<br>  <br>  You add:  "if it was Adam and Steve you would not be here today !!"<br>  <br>  Stop pretending that you are being "resaonable" or logical.  Gays and gay relationships have existed as long as man has existed and all of us ARE here today!  Look around you.  God DID make Adam and Steve.  And we deserve the SAME EXACT CIVIL RIGHTS that you enjoy.  <br>  <br>  And all you heterosexuals are ALREADY trying to 'destroy' marriage all by yourselves.  50% divorce rate and more than half of the other 50% has had at least one spouce cheated on the other.<br>  <br>  If you do not like it that how about YOU moving where other intollerant bigots like you dwell.  I would suggest Iran.  There, there are people like you who are in fact executing gay people -- most of them still in their teens.|`|9PoGLVmXaa	I don't care about the definition of marriage. I just want gays gone period.|`|LPCfOtiKaa	Gay marriage offends the Christian view of marriage because gay people use Christian clergy, the Christian Bible and Christian buildings to perform a ceremony that offends the Christian God.  I have no problem with gay couples having the same legal rights as straight couples, but the Christian belief system shouldn't have to be compromised to make room for it. <br>  <br>  If you want civil unions to be in every state you should go to politicians with your question not Christians in the general public..|`|d7c8ecd624fbbc0797b1502ba6682e8baa	When I see evangelicals protesting the US government changing the definitions of "war" and "torture", then I'll think it might be about definitions.|`|yHfsHp6naa	It's got nothing to do with protecting the definition of anything. It's all about forcing their beliefs on society.|`|gjAZeRyfaa	We do not want to encourage in any way, homosexuality. <br>  <br>  We do not hand a drowning person a glass of water.|`|KXQVRQdjaa	That's a completely irrelevant question.  We have freedom of religion in the US, which means that the government can't make laws based on what one religion decides is right.<br>  <br>  My religion and lots of others honor same-sex marriage.  Since all religions and non-religions are equal under the law, it is completely unconstitutional (not to mention unethical) to forbid gay marriage, and therefore limit OUR religious rights. There is no reason to outlaw it except the religious argument.  <br>  <br>  I hate Christian churches, so I stay out of them.  I don't try to destroy them.  If (some) Christians hate gay marriages, they shouldn't have them.  <br>  <br>  If Christians are so concerned with the sanctity of marriage, maybe they should stop having the highest divorce rate in the country.  As for civil unions, they are the back of the bus, which this country has decided is wrong.  Also, keep in mind that they are inherently unequal to marriage, because you can't move to another state and suddenly be unmarried, which happens with civil unions.<br>  <br>  BTW: I reported the "fags and dykes" answer, you bastard.|`|bVHnNqzBaa	Newt Gingrich, big supporter of DoMA and huge sodomite who cheated on his wife (she was undergoing cancer treatment at the time. He was stupping his intern at the time, just like Bill Clinton.) while pushing that legislation. Trent Lott was on his third marriage when pushing for that marriage protection. Gays have hurt the "institution of marriage?"|`|dqszKQfBaa	Christians have no right to force their marriage views on the government, and vice-versa.<br>  <br>  Gay civil marriage should be legal. It's discriminating against somebody's gender. And churches shouldn't be forced to marry anybody they don't want to.|`|sMLK4hDeaa	Will gays shut down bath-houses if we allow them to have civil unions? <br>  <br>  The answer is no.  <br>  <br>  It is a deviant lifestyle that does not really want marriage. The gay lifestyle wants heterosexuals to acknowledge it's equality, which, we will never do.|`|EmyMvE3Vaa	The "Sanctity of marriage" is a joke, u know it, they know it.

JXfGHsF6aa	Christ was manifested to take away our sins, and in him was no sin. But were the law abolished, as some claim, we would have no need of a Saviour to take away sin, for "where there is no law, there is no transgression." "Therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in his sight; for by the law is the knowledge of sin." "What shall we say then? Is the law sin? God forbid. Nay, I had not known sin, but by the law; for I had not known lust, except the law had said, Thou shalt not covet. But sin, taking occasion by the commandment, wrought in me all manner of concupiscence. For without the law sin was dead. For I was alive without the law once; but when the commandment came [home to the conscience], sin revived, and I died. And the commandment, which [if obeyed] was ordained to life, I found to be unto death. For sin, taking occasion by the commandment, deceived me, and by it slew me. Wherefore the law is [a yoke of bondage, against me, and something to be trampled underfoot because it points out my sins?--No.] holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good. Was then that which is good made death unto me? God forbid. But sin, that it might appear sin, working death in me by that which is good; that sin by the commandment might become exceeding sinful. For we know that the law is spiritual; but I am carnal, sold under sin."<br>  <br>       But though we are carnal, we are to reckon ourselves "dead indeed unto sin, but alive unto God through Jesus Christ our Lord. . . . But God be thanked, that ye were the servants of sin, but ye have obeyed from the heart that form of doctrine which was delivered you. Being then made free from sin, ye became the servants of righteousness. . . . But now being made free from sin, and become servants of God, ye have your fruit unto holiness, and the end everlasting life. For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord." "But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship one with another, and the blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth us from all sin." "He that saith, I know him, and keepeth not his commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him. But whoso keepeth his word, in him verily is the love of God perfected; hereby know we that we are in him. He that saith he abideth in him ought himself also so to walk, even as he walked. Brethren, I write no new commandment unto you, but an old commandment which ye had from the beginning.|`|um9W8Dy8aa	Have a living and grace-filled relationship of concrete faith which works through love (Gal5:6) with God the Father in Christ and each other.<br>  <br>  Observation of the ritual Law is not saving and not binding on Gentiles<br>  <br>  Avoid legalism, scrupulosity and apply trust in Christ's all-sufficient sacrifice of the Cross in you daily life|`|rvmiK8rgaa	Don't know, but I'd like to.

They were also trying to discredit the Apostle Paul.  The result was that a "different" gospel being perpetuated that tried to combine faith and the law.  Paul is simply emphasizing that faith in Christ is independent of the Old Jewish law.  There is only one true gospel - the New Covenant brought by Christ.  And trying to throw in law perverts the gospel.|`|8IHfytEvaa	The book is written to correct one of the first serious errors in the church.  A group of Judaizers had infiltrated the church.  They taught that to be a Christian you trust in Jesus who died for your past sins but after that you have to go back and obey the Law of Moses.<br>  <br>  Paul said those people had lost their salvation, they have been severed from Christ.<br>  <br>  The group today that most closely matches them are the Seventh Day Adventists.|`|sWvbwfLPaa	The gist of Galatians are in these verses:<br>  <br>  Gal 5:2  Behold, I, Paul, say to you that if you are circumcised, Christ shall profit you nothing. <br>  Gal 5:3  For I testify again to every man that is circumcised, that he is a debtor to do all the Law, <br>  Gal 5:4  you who are justified by Law are deprived of all effect from Christ; you fell from grace. <br>  <br>  The Galatians were Greeks; uncircumcised. After Paul left, the Galatians learned from some Jews that to be saved, they must become Jews - circumcision was the ritual to become a Jew. Their mistake was to rely on circumcision and the Jewish rituals as means to be righteous before God. The gospel's message rather is that Jesus is the atoning sacrifice (lamb of God) that cleanses our sins so we can be righteous before God.<br>  <br>  The quote "we are no longer under law" should not be taken out of context.

Notice that word "IF"....|`|NfSozW24aa	You can't understand the Book of Galatians by isolating it from the rest of the Bible. Everything in the Bible is One Piece. <br>  <br>  The Book of Galatians teaches in Chapter 5, verse 4 that man cannot become saved by keeping the law, any law, including the law to obey on the Lord Jesus Christ (I John 3:23).<br>  <br>  Galatians 2:16 teaches that the faith of salvation is the faith of Christ, not our own faith. We are not saved by showing faith in Christ.<br>  <br>  We are only out from being under the law IF God has saved us. God only intended to save a certain number of people, and salvation is entirely, 100%, God's sovereign choice (Romans 9:15-16). <br>  <br>  DaVinci codes have nothing to do with Bible truth.

God forbid: for if there had been a law given which could have given life, verily righteousness should have been by the law.  But the scripture hath concluded all under sin, that THE PROMISE BY FAITH of Jesus Christ might be GIVEN TO THEM THAT BELIEVE.  ... <br>  <br>  Wherefore THE LAW WAS OUR SCHOOLMASTER to bring us unto Christ, that we might be justified by faith.  But after that faith is come, WE ARE NO LONGER UNDER A SCHOOLMASTER. <br>  <br>  For YE ARE ALL THE CHILDREN OF GOD BY FAITH in Christ Jesus. For as many of you as have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ. <br>  There is neither Jew nor Greek, <br>  here is neither bond nor free, <br>  there is neither male nor female: <br>  <br>  for ye are all one in Christ Jesus.

In his own mind, false teachers are messing with his spiritual children; he comes out fighting with every trick of rhetoric he can muster: appeals to both logic and emotion; counting up debating points; a bit of personal vindictiveness towards James and Peter; he even tries a sort of reverse guilt-by-association tactic -- arguing how his opponents are making headway by being "beautiful people" when he himself, Paul, made converts among them despite being physically repulsive.  <br>  <br>  Certainly the theme in Galatians is that we cannot rely on obedience to Mosaic law for salvation.  Having said that, Paul finds it necessary to demonstrate that Mosaic law was not useless; indeed, it served a very great and important purpose in preparing the Jewish people to receive their Messiah.  But, he asserts, its usefulness has passed with the coming of Christ, and that in any case it never applied to Gentiles, only to those people who were supposed to prepare the world for Christ.  <br>  <br>  Paul mocks those who would try to save themselves by obeying the law -- pointing out that it is hardly possible to do so, and (in mockery) daring them to try.  Then he goes a step beyond this by insisting that if anyone, Jew or Gentile, puts reliance in the law, then said people are turning away from Christ: putting faith, that is, in the wrong thing, and rejecting the enormous grace offered them through Christ's sacrifice.  <br>  <br>  Having used most of Galatians to make rhetorical arguments that dismiss the idea of relying on Mosaic law, Paul closes with one of his more interesting sermons on Christian behavior:<br>  <br>  "Anyone can see the kind of behavior that belongs to the lower nature: fornication, impurity, and indecency; idolatry and sorcery; quarrels, a contentious temper, envy, fits of rage, selfish ambitions, dissensions, party intrigues and jealousies; drinking bouts, orgies and the like.  I warn you, as I warned you beofre, that those who behave in such ways will never inherit the kingdom of God" -- regardless of faith, apparently.  Of course Paul probably agrees with John that those with true faith cannot so behave.  Paul goes on: "But the harvest of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, fidelity, gentleness, and self-control."  Compare this with 2 Peter 1:5-7.  Again, Paul seemingly agrees with John (and Peter) that those with faith who receive the Spirit will possess such traits.  He concludes this sermon on Christian behavior with "Make no mistake about this: God is not to be fooled: a man reaps what he sows ... So let us never tire of doing good, for if we do not slacken our efforts we shall in due time reap our harvest.  Therefore, as opportunity offers, let us work for the good of all, especially members of the household of the faith."  Now he seems to be saying, like James, that if faith does not lead to good works, it is then empty! <br>  <br>  But because of all the rhetoric against those who were preaching the need for Christians to be Jews, Paul's Galatians is a source of primary argument for the "salvation through faith (meaning: belief) alone" apologists. <br>  <br>  (An interesting and off-topic by-the-way: in Paul's account of his own conversion in Galatians, he contradicts what Luke has to say about his movements after his conversion, in Acts.)|`|DxqhcUvWaa	Any part of the Bible can be misunderstood unless one is studying it and relying on God to interput it for them.  <br>  <br>  The law refers to the 600 plus dos and don'ts that the Jewish religious leaders had developed from the Ten Commandements.  The Jewish religious leaders put burdens upon the people that they themselves could not even do.<br>  <br>  It reminded me of being in Kuwait during Ramadan.  Ramadan is a time where for 40 days, Muslims do not eat or drink anything from sun up to sun down.  If you happen to be in Kuwait during this time, then you are expected to follow the same practice.<br>  <br>  Most Kuwait people do not work.  They hire mostly Indians from India to do their work for them.  Kuwait can get up to 110F during the summer time with a high humidity rate.  <br>  <br>  So, the workers have to get out into this and work, with out having any water or food, while the Kuwaitis are resting in their homes and probably eating and drinking.  Very uncompassionate.<br>  <br>  The Jewish leaders were the same.  What Paul is saying is Jesus did not do away with the Law which was the Ten Comamndements, but he challenged the present religious establishement that had no mercy or comapssion for people.<br>  <br>  What Paul is saying is what Law do you want to live under?  The Ten Commandments, which are still in force, or the 600 plus rules the religious leaders what you to live under?<br>  <br>  In the end, Israel was completely destroyed because it lost all its compassion and mercy for people.  They would even take their own people and treat them worse than slaves.  This really upset God.<br>  <br>  Put it another way, the Jewish law was trying to legislate love for God.  In the US, Congress has tried to legislate the white person to love the black person and all others of different color.  Do you think this has worked?<br>  <br>  The Jews, even some well meaning Christian Jews, were trying to mix old traditions with the new faith and say that those who were not Jews had to live by these traditions to be a Christian.  This was wrong.  Jesus taught that knowing God has to come from the heart, not following a set of rules.<br>  <br>  Now there are things we have to do if we are a Christian.  There is a set life style based on the Fruits of the Spirit.|`|AA10057370	This could be a long study.Too long if you don't, at least, give the 10 points.<br>  <br>  simplified:<br>  Galatians 3:(King James Version)<br>  <br>   13Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us: for it is written, Cursed is every one that hangeth on a tree:|`|315e05cc268b43fe093093a9e96280b8aa	Yes, it main intent for the church in Galatia and for the church today is that the law has been abolished.

Being betrothed is not like our be engaged.  The betrothal settled all arrangements with the joining of two families.  The marriage ceremony was like the community witness and acceptance.

Joseph, to avoid any disgrace to Mary was going to divorce Her informally, however he relented after the Angel's message in a dream.  When Jesus was missing for 3 days and his parents eventually found Him, Mary said to Him "don't you know how your father (Joseph) and I have been worried about you" - and he went home and was obedient to them.

And I will say one thing, it used to be that people taught their children that they were only to experience sex within a marriage. Therefore, there wouldn't be all the situations like we have today with the abortions or unwed single mothers having to raise children without a father. If a person went against this teaching, then they were shamed in society and sent off to have the child. In the Bible times, they stoned people that had sex outside of marriage, pregnant or not. So Joseph made the decision to marry Mary. He had been enlightened by a dream from God that Mary was telling the truth about bearing the Messiah. Jesus was raised by both of them as their son, it would be like we have step-fathers today to raise a child from another marriage. This is why most of the Jews didn't believe Jesus was the Messiah, because they had seen Him grow up in Nazareth. They didn't understand how He was the Son of God come to earth to redeem their sins. They thought the Messiah would come as a King or someone that would be in a higher place than just being the step-son of a carpenter.|`|AA11690436	Joseph did start to freak out, but he got a visit from an angel, too.

It is never used by his Apostles and disciples. <br>  <br>  Christ is not denying that He is the Son of God. Rather, He is instead acknowledging His own humanity, which comes from the fact that He was born of a woman, the Virgin Mary. <br>  <br>  Christ is also, of course, putting off the Pharisees by using this title for Himself. We must remember that Christ got crucified because of his claim to not only be the Messiah and the Son of God, but to be God. However, at this point, Christ was not yet finished with His ministry, and knew that He needed just a little more time, so He had to put off the Pharisees just a little longer.|`|qyoXSdPCaa	Wrong again on all counts.<br>  <br>   "Ezekiel and Daniel, prophets of the captivity [who] found their sphere of ministry outside Israel, used this title, `Son of Man.' Christ, who came to His own and was rejected by them, found Himself outside, and applies this title `Son of Man' to Himself. By His use of it, He oversteps the narrow and circumscribed limits of Judaism, and instead of a glory filling Immanuel's land merely, the scene widens, for the dominion of the `Son of Man' embraces the heavens and earth, and instead of a glory skirting the coasts of Judea, the whole earth becomes lightened with His glory under this name and character. Universal dominion and absolute sovereignty are glories resting upon this exceedingly interesting title, one in which every human being is concerned, for universal judgment and authority to exercise that judgment are referred to the `Son of Man' (Jn. 12:23-48; Ac. 17:31). As `Son of Man' He comes in glory to Israel (Mt. 24:30), and to the Gentiles or living nations on the earth whom He gathers before His throne of glory (Mt. 25:31,32); then He will bring in universal blessing and righteous rule (Mt. 13:41-43). It is interesting to note that while the title `Son of Man' occurs in the gospels about 80 times, it is only directly applied by the Lord to Himself; it is not once (in the gospels) applied by others to Him. It is used by Stephen upon his death (Ac. 7:56), and by John in the Revelation (Re. 1:13; 14:14). It is possible that occasionally the title stresses Jesus' humility, but the widespread teaching that `Son of Man' expresses His humanity just as `Son of God' expresses His deity, is misleading. See Lk. 22:69,70" (Ibid.).|`|si3eq11haa	Jesus Never denies He is the Son of God.<br>  the bible does not contradict itself. and it makes sense to those who are seeking God, <br>  <br>  Son of Man   A name Jesus used for himself.

No where in Matthew 12: 38-40 does Jesus Christ say He is not the Son of God.  He does say only an adulterous generation seeks after a sign, and the only sign that will be given is Jonah in the belly of the whale, which, of course surely you realize was a predecessor to His being three days in the tomb and then arisen from it...just as Jonah was three days in the belly of the whale, and for all intents and purposes "dead" because how many people could be expected to survive that....and then expelled alive out of the whale's belly...just as Christ came out of the tomb alive...after being killed by the Jews...  What He is saying is that the Scriptures have given all the clues and signs a believing and rational people need, and if they did not heed the sign already given, they will not heed any more signs.  The fact that Christ will not give more signs than have already been given to a disbelieving generation or people does not mean He is saying He is not the Son of God.  He's stating it's sinful to keep asking for more signs when people ignore the signs they've already been given.  I see no contradiction in that.  It's purely clear and logical...for those who have ears to hear....And it's clearly in agreement with what He said elsewhere, about allowing the poor man who went to heaven to return to earth to warn the brothers of the rich man who died and went to hell.  Christ said that the brothers of the rich man had the prophets to guide them to a better path in life and if they did not believe the prophets, they would not believe the poor man either, even if he came back from the dead to warn them about the fate that awaited them for not correcting their evil ways....i.e. hell.  God does not contradict Himself, hut humans often fail to understand.
GItBUBL9aa	The Bible isn't a newspaper that you can read everything that's happening now.   Some Christians are over-zealous in pinning current events to future prophecies.  <br>  <br>  There are a whole host of end time prophecies, but what makes you think the Bible records so much prophecy that you can look to something happening today and claim it's the fulfillment of a prophecy?<br>  <br>  Some prophecies already fulfilled in current times include the return of the Jews to Israel.  End time prophecies also show the nations that will be at odds with Israel and predicts they will invade en-mass just before Christ returns.  We can see things shaping up to that end in current events: the return of Israel with enemies all about her.  But is that the actual prophecy of the invasion? no.  You can't look to current turmoils and line them up with biblical prophecies because there's only a limited number of prophecies and not everything that happens is recorded.<br>  <br>  If you want to read fulfilled prophecies, just get a commentary on the book of Daniel which predicted four successive world empires: Babylonian, Medo-Persian, Grecian, and Roman, notably in Dan. 2 & Dan. 7.|`|NCRfZRopaa	Well, they always say that the Bible has so many prophecies and that they have come true. Yet, they can't cite the prophecy nor event.<br>  <br>  It's funny in a way.|`|ef7be53a8ea254bcecc8dd5838cbbbeaaa	Anyone who would blindly follow the words of 3000 year old goat herders that didn't know how to purify water or even cook food properly, I'll never truly understand..|`|DvQLt59Paa	The land of Israel was predicted to the day in the Bible.<br>  <br>  There is no 1 passage.

Much like the ALLEGED prophecies of Nostradamus, St. Bridget, and Cagliastro. <br>  <br>  Not one single prophecy that Christians and Jews claim, ever came to fruition.  They were merely 'word-of-mouth' tradition and, in the case of the ALLEGED prophecies concerning Christ, they had NO connection to Jesus of Nazareth, but were made to fit the Jesus Christ invented by Paul as his resurrected Messiah/God.  They ALL referred to men of the time.  <br>  But Paul and the early Christians combed the Old Testament to find "prophecies" that could be foisted off on the gullible as actually pertaining to Christ.<br>  <br>  edit <br>  <br>  Just Me: <br>  Sadly you have fallen into the same trap as most of your fellow Christians in trying to USE the bible to PROVE the bible.  In order for you response to have ANY verity, you must be able to offer CONTEMPORARY evidence that what is IN the bible is corroborated by ANYONE OUTSIDE THE BIBLE.  And that is a patent impossibility.  The moment you say: "the Bible says..." you have lost your argument as far as truth and history are concerned.|`|vDcDnO7Yaa	? No other book in history has been able to tell the future. <br>  ? There are 300 scriptures talking about Jesus and prophesying about Jesus.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  A few examples:  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  - In the Old Testament Micah 5:2 said that Jesus would be born in Bethlehem.<br>  - Matthew 2:1 says he was born in Bethlehem & it was fulfilled.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  - Isaiah 7:14 He'd be born of a virgin<br>  - Fulfilled in Matthew 1:23-25<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  - They would pierce his hands & feet. Psalm 22:16<br>  - Fulfilled John 19:37<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  - They would cast lots for his clothing ("cast lots" that they gambled. They were gambling on trying to win Jesus' clothing.) Psalm 22:18<br>  - Fulfilled in Matthew 27:35, Mark 15:24, Luke 23:34 & John 19:24<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  - Not a bone would be broken. (referring to Jesus) Psalm 34:20<br>  - Fulfilled John 19:36<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  - He'd be Crucified with thieves. Isaiah 53:12<br>  - Fulfilled Matthew 27:38<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  (It goes on & on saying 300 things about Jesus that did occur later.)<br>  <br>  **The chances of any of these things being fulfilled are less than 1 chance in 33 million.**|`|AA11943997	The Christian (old and renewed covenants) Bible is about 1/3 prophecy. Of that, over 2/3 has already happened. Ex. About 50 specifics apply to Y'shua/Jesus' birth. All of them happened exactly as stated. Ex: Y'shua was born to a virgin, he rode into Jerusalem on a donkey, he was born in Bethlehem, he lived in Nazareth, etc, etc,. Many more prophecies apply to Israel (both the land and the people) and the time known as 'the end'. Just about everything happening in the Middle East for the last  61 years is mentioned, either specifically or generally, in Biblical prophecy.

3GAiVmEAaa	There are lots of people fighting about sex ed, so while they may know some they aren't really learning about good safe sex. They either get abstinence only, which is ridiculous, or they get stuff that makes sex seem so villainous that even if the information isn''t bad they don't want to listen.<br>  <br>  ADD: Kids will not listen to no sex, END OF STORY! It has been happening for centuries, and you can't just say it is their fault for not listening. Piles of unwanted kids and teens with STDs is not going to help society.<br>  <br>  Seeing sex on TV isn't learning, if anything that is a reason for better sex ed! There are lots of scary rumors out there.<br>  <br>  And part of good sex ed IS abstinence- it is the only way to 100% prevent pregnancy and STDs. But if kids are going to do it, they need to know the best way to protect themselves.<br>  <br>  <br>  ADD: Sex ed is supposed to protect them from the spur of the moment.<br>  <br>  I think good sex ed is teaching kids that their urges are normal, and sex can be good, but it can have physical and emotional consequences. It isn't something to be taken lightly, and if you do have sex consider it seriously, use at least 2 forms of protection. Know the anatomy of it, about STDs, how contraception works, and your own emoional maturity!<br>  <br>  ADD: Obviously the kids aren't getting it at home. Should they be punished because their parents aren't doing it? If anything they need it more! The kids that are coming from "bad trees" need to be educated on how to stop the cycle, and if nothing else if you dislike them so much why dont you want to help them stop reproducing?!|`|zkETPA8waa	Sorry, but repeated studies have shown that abstinence-only sexual education leads to FAR higher instances of teenage pregnancy and STDs than full, informative sex education.

My parents didn't want it in school, and they didn't give it at home. What I got in high school was a joke, out of date, and mostly inaccurate.<br>  <br>  I became sexually active at the age of 11. Not because I wanted to have sex... but because I needed answers about sex, and couldn't get them any other way. Curiosity is a powerful motivator. Sex education has improved slightly since I went to school, but not enough. And teens are generally going to have sex in high school these days, and need to have information and contraception available to them.

You were definitely taught incorrectly. <br>  <br>  Jews do not actively seek converts, and Rabbis are supposed to make three vigorous attempts to dissuade a potential convert. This is because being Jewish is more rigorous than being a Gentile. To be righteous in the eyes of God, a Gentile (non-Jew) must only follow the 10 commandments that we are all familiar with. However, a Jew has 613 commandments to follow. The attempts to dissuade the potential convert are to make sure that the convert is going to be willing to follow all of those commandments and take on that extra responsibility.<br>  <br>  Upon choosing to convert, you must learn all the Jewish laws, customs, holidays, etc. This period varies from person to person, as a convert who was raised Jewish might not need any extra instruction, but another person might need several years, but this period is generally at least one year, because you do have to experience all of the Jewish holidays. <br>  <br>  For more information on conversion, you can see my source, Jewfaq.org, or the Conversion to Judaism Home Page, <a href="http://www.convert.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.convert.org/</a>|`|Hn5mGBWuaa	People can convert to Orthodox Judaism. It's a custom though for the rabbi to deny you three times. This is done to make sure the person wanting to convert is doing this through heart, and not of some other hasty reason. If you have a problem with that rabbi or sect, move to another group of Orthodox Jews. Also, keep in mind that there are many branches of Judaism. Just be sure to take your time in deciding and best of luck!|`|Tr43d4tXaa	I just hate it when people who don't have a CLUE try to give answers! Jews are not racist, and there's no reason in the world why you can't convert to Orthodox Judaism...<br>  <br>  I did!<br>  <br>  I became interested in Judaism, and initially went to a Reform shul. Long story short, I wasn't satisfied, and ended up converting through the Conservative movement. I STILL wasn't satisfied...and converted Orthodox.<br>  <br>  Satisfied.<br>  <br>  There are definite advantages to converting Orthodox. For one thing, it is the only conversion that is accepted by ALL branches of Judaism. IOW, if you convert Reform or Conservative, the Orthodox don't believe that your conversion is valid. There's actually a pretty good reason for this--<br>  <br>  We Orthodox Jews believe that we are still completely obligated to fulfill ALL of G-d's commandments. Reform & Conservative Jews typically don't believe that, so they'll keep some laws--kosher, maybe--and ignore others.<br>  <br>  But since we believe that Jews are obligated to the Law, we can't in good conscience convert someone unless that person 1) knows and accepts that obligation, and 2) is converted by Rabbis who know and accept those obligations. It's rare to find Rabbis like this in the Reform or Conservative branches.<br>  <br>  For instance, the Pesach after I converted Conservative, I went to my Rabbi's house for the first seder. The kids spent most of the seder in the other room....watching TV. This is in direct violation of Torah. I didn't know enough to know that it was wrong, and my Rabbi didn't believe it was wrong, and in Orthodox opinion, I wasn't really a convert...not because of this one incident, but because I wasn't living a Torah life-style, nor was I expected to.<br>  <br>  Converting Orthodox is difficult--expect to learn and study for at least a year and more often two. You have to live within walking distance of your shul, and again, accept the obligation of the Law. But it's completely rewarding IF you're called to it, and you will be loved, helped, and accepted. That's been my experience, anyway.<br>  <br>  A couple of things: Obligation to fulfill the law does NOT mean that you're damned to hell if you don't. We don't BELIEVE in hell. And we KNOW that we will fail. We still have to do our best...<br>  <br>  and I in no way mean any slander towards either the Reform or Conservative branches of Judaism. I learned a lot in both movements, and was treated well. It's just that I wanted to live Judaism as described in Torah, and as it has been practiced for the last 4000 years, to the best of my ability.<br>  <br>  Good luck, no matter what you choose.

We were just havin a night swim and having a good time. So our pool is next to a house that know one had lived in for about 3 years.

So anyways back to the story... so we were all just swimmin' and having a good time and then all of a sudden...<br>  <br>  I looked up at the house's window and saw this weird yellowish-whitish aura that resembled a older woman looking down at us. Like it was watching us to see if were safe or something. I couldn't believe what I was looking at. What ever it was, it slightly opened the shutters on the window and waved at me. At that moment, my face turned pale white and when I turned around to tell my buddy, the shutters closed and the aura was gone. I seriously freaked and didn't want to be near that house for the rest of the night. <br>  <br>  Well, that's my story.

In all honesty there were a few wars and it had very little effect on the outcome as a whole. Same with African history. Other than selling their people as slaves they themselves were more like prizes in a game. And had very little bearing on history as a whole. The teachers have very little time to explain alot of events. So they have to focus on the most important players. Starting with the Summarians, then the Egyptians, then the Greeks, Muslims, Europeans, and Finally the United States.

5c9011543d498dda04d1562813072559aa	There is no more noble calling, brother! Anyone who senses the leading of the Lord to enter the Christian ministry or any field of Christian service should seek confirmation of that guidance through meditation upon God's Word and prayer. <br>  <br>  The desire to enter full-time Gospel ministry should be a God-given urge and passion to seek out the lost, win them for Christ, and nurture them within the church. Paul expressed it this way, "Woe to me if I do not preach the gospel" (1 Corinthians 9:16).<br>  <br>  Preparation should begin immediately through a personal habit of daily devotions, Bible study, and prayer. Loyalty in church attendance and active participation in Christian service are essential. Counsel and prayer with pastors and church leaders are also vital. Perhaps your pastor could suggest a program of reading and study in those areas he would consider most helpful. Trust the Lord to lead you in further training at a Bible college or seminary of His choice.<br>  <br>  Your pastor or church leaders should be able to give you specific information on the process of obtaining credentials for ministry within your particular church or denomination. You might also contact officials at a Bible college or seminary that you are interested in. <br>  <br>  As you explore God's plan for your ministry, remember the wonderful promise of Proverbs 3:5-6: "Trust in the Lord with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding; in all your ways acknowledge him, and he will make your paths straight."|`|Zzhgpe0Paa	Perhaps you should ask the Lord. If He has put it in your heart to become a missionary, surely He knows where best to put you. If it's your own will that will have you become a missionary, maybe you'll want to rethink things before committing. You'll want to make sure you have God's blessing before you embark on this type of adventure.|`|XJ9oSR2daa	What denomination are you affliating with?<br>  <br>  You wait for God to tell you where to go, and I really hope you know He is calling you, if not and you are doing this without His calling, it won't be a good thing.<br>  <br>  EDIT- The SBC has a missions board.  Im southern baptist also and we are sending a youth pastor into missions, you need to contact them.  Theres tons of paperwork, but they will support you.|`|wG825TwBaa	you will make like 19,000 a year in those countries.    my sister is a missionary in india.

The Jews have their own faith and we should respect it, and they are sick of Christians trying to convert them. Their asylums are full of people turning up in Israel announcing that they are the Messiah or Jesus come back.  As for India, Christian missionaries tried for years to convert a people who have their own faiths and made little headway. Read a life of Charles Freer Andrews who was a missionary who made friends with Gandhi and decided Indians didn't need Christianity so he worked with the people instead. He's buried in Calcutta. I've lived in both countries. Your best choice is to be a good Christian by example, not trying to convert others. God made us different like a beautiful garden and it's actions, not words, that count in this life.|`|LKloPwz2aa	okay im a missionary. ive learned that it doesnt matter where you are,that as long as its the true word of god. start small. its simple. even if you go to a diffrent city its still in the mission feild.  missionary. think of the word. your on a mission. if its for god your on a mission to share the word of god. remember that.|`|p4MUVoKzaa	Never trust an atheist answer (80% of people answering FAITH questions)  If God called you to a mission he will provide a way.  We should never fear God but allow our faith to over come our fear.  Remember, to loose your life to Jesus is to gain it.  But where God needs you he will provide a way for you to accomplish his will.  Just be smart and listen to the spirit.<br>  <br>  TO the atheist in here be warned,  the day of your judgment is not the time for you to repent!|`|t88527U1aa	You are planning or God is calling you? If by your strength you will not be successful if by his will you will be blessed.|`|FOzN3xwzaa	I was a missionary in Israel for three years.  It was a great experience, and I can share with you some tips.  :)  Feel free to email me:  chr3788@yahoo.com|`|lKBoTN7Vaa	Might I suggest Turkey or Iran for your mission ?|`|pGf4mIw9aa	First of all, if you are coming in here to get suggestions, wrong move. Secondly, you don't make the choice to where you are going to go, who you are going to evangelize too, how you are going to evangelize and when you are going to evangelize. Understand, you are the vessel, God is the mouth piece. So if anything, pray about it and if it's in God's will for you to do the missionary thing, he will let you know when, how, where, who and when. One of the biggest mistake that a believer or a follower can do, is move one step ahead of God leaving God behind him. The reason I am telling you this. Because I do it. I have been doing this for twelve years and if you are really wanting to do this. God will open up doors you may not like. I am out here daily with the people in Indiana and believe me, it is not always easy. I sleep in my car. I eat in shelters, and I go where God tells me to go. I am writing a book called the truth shall make me free and it is my life journal. Doing the work of God is to give up your life. When Jesus told the guy with the possession, to sell everything and follow me. Believe me, he means everything. Just a little warning. Not to scare you but to let you know. Put your trust in God and let him direct your path. Not the people on here. These people don't know what Plan God has for you so they can't answer this question for you. Only God can.|`|4WqvTAfmaa	What are you offering that is any better than the beliefs of those whom you will speak to? Will you listen as well as teach?

Sometimes God has a mission for you in your own neighborhood. Don't ignore the small opportunities God gives you while you are making grand plans. <br>  Second, find a need. Try to fill it. If you are passionate about a need or a location, go for it and let God open or close the doors. You will be amazed at how your plans will instantly up and change and yet work out so marvelously. Talk about faith building! <br>  Third, be flexible, because you will be stretched. It relates to the second rule, but it is extremely important. Even if you get the location, the job you will be doing often ends up being drastically different. Not only that, but you are almost guaranteed to have to endure unbelievable difficulties and have an awful time. Welcome to the front lines. It is all part of the fun. The plus side is, you get to have your socks rocked as you watch God untangle the mess. Trust me trust me trust me, this is the BEST PART. So whatever problem comes up needs to be dealt with with an excited smile on your face, since you know the show is just about to start.   <br>  <br>  Anyways, in answer to your question, pray about it, and follow rule number one and two simultaneously. Number 3 comes in once you finally get there.

The Disney studios wouldn't have done it, I think.|`|qCY7pvj1aa	You really must have not read the whole account or else you wouldn't have said what you have said. First there was something brought up between God and satan. The Challenge that was set was that as long as man had the blessing of God that he would continue to serve him, but if the blessings had stopped he would disown his faith. The test was presented to Job who was richly blessed by God. To make the long story short he lost everything and even his wife after all that happened told him to curse God and die. But he still remained faithful.<br>                                                 (Just read Job) <br>  <br>  The main point of the story is if we began to suffer through the trials and tribulation of this wicked system, will we just give up? For sure we cant blame this on God. Yes every good gift and every perfect present comes from above.(James 1:16) So just because it is taken away from us doesn't mean that God has taken it from us or even that he is amused by it when we suffer.|`|AA11614944	God did not forsake Job. He knew ahead of time that Job would not forsake Him. One thing to notice in the story of Job, very important. Satan has to ASK PERMISSION to do anything to Job, Satan did not have the authority to do anything on his own. Once he obtained permission, even Satan obeyed God. <br>  <br>  Job realized that all that he had was due to God. Job remained faithful through it all, despite his wife and 3 friends.|`|hZjPYyFTaa	First the poet who wrote the story of Job did not have God playing a stupid game with Lucifer.

I lost my marriage, then my dazzling 25 year career in journalism, then my expensive renovated loft, then my health, then my money and finally my figure. The last four years have been a nightmare and I knew that the ending of the story of Job left him on a dung heap, much like my current digs.<br>  I then thought God would never expect me to sustain more crap - I have a boiling point. So faith is alive and well and there was already one Job.|`|IYe1TTwYaa	God did not forsake Job. If you notice Job would make sacrifices just in case his children had sinned. It is fear that  cause Job to do that. Fear opened the door which allowed Satan to steal, kill, and destroy all of those things. Yes God approved it, but Job's fear caused it.|`|8f1i9DWyaa	God did not forsake Job. In the end, God blessed Job mightily. The Job story illustrates that God and satan had a contest. Would Job be disloyal to God if his blessings were taken away?  Job proved to satan that there are humans that will be loyal to God because they love Him and know who God is even if they lose their blessings. They will love God no matter what. That's an idea that satan can't stand.|`|12011f85da0fb54b8dd064f30c2efa9daa	I think you read that part of the Bible incorrectly.  God only allowed Satan to test Job, God did not forsake him.

The bible clearly states that God was proving to the devil <br>  that Job would remain faithful to God no matter what the devil put him through. God rewarded Job's faithfulness at the end of the devil's failed attempt to get him to denounce God. Often people are to quick to blame<br>  God for every negative thing that happens and just ignore the fact that there is a devil out there whose main purpose is to destroy people in anyway he can. If a creator is proud of his/her work they will put their <br>  name to it. If the incident was GOOD,remove an "O" and you have GOD.<br>  If it is EVIL,add a"D" and you have the signature of the DEVIL                  You should care that God gave him "riches" because he can also do the same for you if you seek Him with an open mind    Child of The King|`|9jxFpFTJaa	Well, God never actually did forsake Job. He returned everything he had taken away from Job, with interest! God was watching over him the whole time too, making sure that nothing more was done to him than what could be handled. From one perspective: the story is more an F-U to the devil -- The devil can't do anything without permission from God; All of the devil's power is worthless, and can be overthrown and undone by God. God has the devil pinned under His thumb, and will only allow him to hurt us if it would benefit us in the long run, or bring about some other greater good. <br>  <br>  This is all to say that God's reasons are perfect and good. He is Perfect and Good, and Just, and makes all things work together for the Greater Good. And God took care of His servant Job, though he tested His faith with terrible trials.<br>  <br>  If God were to do the same to you, have faith that He is good, trust in Him, and no real, ultimate harm will come to you. Job had it the worst, but God made it all right. <br>  <br>  "The Lord giveth, and the Lord taketh away: blessed be the name of the Lord"|`|aYYlVtdeaa	Simple answer... You don't know.

What can man do to me?"<br>  <br>  Romans 8:35  Who shall separate us from the love of Christ?

Thus the righteous one who puts faith in Christ is 3 times, 3 times in the NT, told that their suffering is related to them inheriting the promise.<br>  <br>  Forgiveness and punishment are two different things.  Not being forgiven means - forget it.  However, being forgiven means that now you get punished (according to mercy) for you evil deed so that you will learn not to repeat this in the future.<br>  <br>  There is no escaping punishment whether Christian or not.  The Christian who is approved gets punished every time he sins seriously for that sin, thus little by little he learns not to sin any more.  The ungodly gets punished in one go, and dies from it without receiving a positive reward.<br>  (hell is nonexistence only, no torment - scriptures to that effect)<br>  -----<br>  Edit: the purpose of discipline and suffering:<br>  <br>  "11 No discipline seems pleasant at the time, but painful. Later on, however, for those who have been trained by it, it produces a harvest of righteousness and peace."|`|rz4AUvbaaa	If you have good ideas, do they ever "go through crap?"  No.  The lesson is that seeming crap is just that, seeming and no more.  If all evil was a reality, then we would not need a savior or God, because all would be in "perfect order" as is.

The command "Thou shalt have no other gods before me" was interpreted as "You can recognize those gods as existing, but I am the only one you worship." <br>  <br>  Later in the faith (specifically, after the first exile) the Jewish prophets said that God was punishing them for acknowledging and respecting other gods that were not the One God. That is when the idea shift happened, and they went from a henotheistic religion (one that acknowledges many gods but worships only one) to a truly monotheistic religion.<br>  <br>  From that point on, the first commandment was interpreted as, "You shall not place false gods before the one and only true God." Christianity, which sprang up from Judaism later on, has the same interpretation of the first commandment.<br>  <br>  Atheists and other unbelievers are often skeptical of the first commandment because, depending on how you read into it and what you do or don't know about religious studies, you might think it's acknowledging multiple gods. When Judaism was a very early henotheistic belief system, it was. Now it is not.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps!|`|8f1i9DWyaa	You can worship the Triune God - Father, Son and Holy Spirit. That is God.

Older people often fight death less also.

The first stage is denial.  The other stages are anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance.  It may be an evolutionary adaptation, but I doubt it (since accepting ones impending death really doesn't convey any kind of natural advantage I can think of.)<br>  <br>  The idea that animals know they're going to die and go off to be alone is probably not completely true; and it probably is a natural advantage.  When animals are sick, they tend to hide because they're vulnerable; this definitely provides an evolutionary advantage, as sick animals that don't hide probably get eaten.  Since dying animals are typically sick, first, they go off alone to hide.|`|KmnbjZIdaa	Death is a certainty in this world where we live.

After I arrived in Saudi, and before the war started, we found out that my Unit had been specifically targeted to be wiped out by a paramilitary unit (terrorist group).  We were one of two unit's that had been targeted, and the choice of unit's had been well thought out.<br>  <br>  I spent much of my time in a civilian vehicle buzzing around the Saudi peninsula, particularly around Dhahran, and it's very hard to get out of a well-planned ambush.  Needless to say, when we first learned that  we had been targeted it was quite frightening, but within a few weeks I developed a tremendous sense of peace.  I wasn't going to die easily, and I was appropriately cautious, but the simplest things became a source of comfort; especially talking to my wife and kids.  They didn't know what was going on, but letting them know wouldn't have changed anything and would have decreased our odds of survival.  <br>  <br>  The enemy lost 12, and we quickly figured out who many of them were.  We didn't loose any. <br>  <br>  I ate dinner with several, and because of it they learned I wasn't the evil person they were told I was and we ended up avoiding each other.  To my knowledge, all those I ate dinner with went home.<br>  <br>  After the war my wife encourage me to write as a means of reuniting with family, and one of my poems was inspired by my brush with the enemy.  <br>  <br>  The Fall has been published in English and Japanese, and is probably going to be published in Iran.

After he stepped on a mine, and the gun fire slowed down, he and I prayed. He asked me "Am I dying?" I said yes. He prayed again and died. He had the utmost courage, he made his self ready.

How ever this does not apply to others. I mean sure people try to be brave when death comes around, but really, i'm sure people are scared. I know i will be when death desides to take me. I mean i don't want to die, but i know it will happen someday and i have learned to accept that. I believe there is life after death, because it is the only way i can accept death. Knowing that there is going to be life afterward really calms me down. <br>  <br>  As for the animals doing these sort've things, i have actually heard a really interesting story,<br>  My friend's friend who works at the retirment center says that there is this cat. This cat sits on the bed of an elder who will die in that week. Almost like comfert in there last hours. I think animals can sense when these sort've things are going to happen to people, and themselves.

Of course, Islam wouldn't exist if Judaism & then Christianity didn't exist as Muhammed just lifted various stories he'd heard from Christian and Jewish merchants and turned them into his Quran. If you're actually asking, Would the world be better off if monotheism had never triumphed over polytheistic paganism the answer would be Absolutely, Yes. Prior to the rise of monotheism there was no idea of a `holy war' - were there wars? Yes. Over land, over trade routes, personal pride, honor, but not over religion.

I say this because it doesn't matter if you give your spouse all the love in the world... it still won't fill the void he/she has from leaving his/her culture to come to yours.|`|K1M5HygAaa	Nope  I personally know many Mormons who interracial date.|`|G0QugnQ8aa	no...not in the modern day, mainstream group...the ones that can actually validly call themselves Mormon|`|TzY9vkinaa	I just married a Mexican in the LDS Salt Lake City temple.|`|GPn55rjTaa	Not at all.  My white girlfriend at church is married to a black man.  They have a son and his skin coloring is exactly the middle of the 2 of them.  Makes me smile whenever I see the 3 of them together.|`|p18BmlIxaa	Not any more, "officially", although Brigham Young and other early Mormon leaders preached vehemently against interracial marriage.<br>  <br>  Really, it's not much of an issue for them anyway, considering that Mormons typically date other Mormons, and you'd be hard-pressed to find more than a handful of Mormons who are ethnic minorities.|`|e1a7697c7943bcffd2fa613b82800630aa	Interracial dating and marriage among Mormons is very common today.

Jesus prayed for his enemies even as they nailed hIm to the cross. He says to rejoice in our sufferings for Him, to pray for our persecutors, that we are blessed in our persecution, and that the meek shall inherit the earth.  Are we meek when we lash out and call names, even if they aren't believers. Is this the way to lead them to Christ? Aren't they to " Know we are Christians by our love?"<br>  Let's show them a little love. We are ALL His children.|`|MMImKRAgaa	what you have agreed with is that Jesus tells us to love those whom have  persecuted, or not to return violence to them who have violated us. <br>  or it means that vengeance belongs to the Lord. And, he will repay<br>  For the love you are seeking is a friendship or acceptance, not love or affection, another misgiving of a nonbeliever. <br>  So where have I not done according as the tax man does when he takes your money, we are both in that same boat. taking out paraphrasing will not save you if your going in that direction, spiritually speaking of course|`|UR4mWefGaa	The bible rightly divided will show you that jesus spoke these words at the end of the old testament times. He was speaking to Jews, so this is Jewish context only. The church age is what we live in now. We can totally obliterate our enemies because they are god's enemies. Like homosexuals. god is OK with that. I am not saying to hurt anybody. You can only yell insults at them. Remind them that god hates them, and they will burn in hell, and you couldn't be happier.|`|AA11990031	What is your perfection ?|`|89MKzLl3aa	It's hard when the love isn't returned by those who don't believe like us. Christians aren't perfect, but do try.|`|NLinPsyhaa	you are confusing love with tolerance. I love my children, but will not tolerate disobedience. It is out of love that we show the world the truth. If we did not love you we would keep the truth to ourselves and let you suffer eternally. We are to spread the message of God. And that means to also provide correction.|`|Johiu2cwaa	Xians prefer to show their love by giving you GBU-38s and BGM-109 Tomahawks.|`|Z5KvRSRCaa	Yeah because the people on a website are indicative of Christianity as a whole...|`|biPAZ2TVaa	I pray for my enemies.|`|1VaH8D3Raa	Because to follow every thing in the bible would make  Christians not want to be one<br>  .<br>  Or they would have to live a  life as  a Quaker does  <br>  .<br>  And who among us could do with any electric items or Gas furnace and Gas or electric stove<br>  .<br>  And who among us would like to be a walking to Walmarts to do the days food shopping evey day rain or shine<br>  .|`|PXVDJaYdaa	Christians don't always act like Christians. Remember people are human we make mistakes we act of anger, we overreact. The Christian thing to do isn't always the thing that people do.|`|7iFVbir1aa	ya know ....being self righteous and full of pride is not becoming,and shows pure IGNORANCE on your part|`|AA11124121	Vitriolic balance.|`|564d359090a6d360bec9ee3849107a51aa	Who said we don't.

A lot of Christian don't act Christ like. I can blame them because no one can be as perfect as Jesus. I think this is what give Christian a bad name.  They preach all this stuff but don't walk the talk.  I have a girlfriend who say she's a Chrisitan but have a hard time forgiving people but that's is between her and our Lord.  I have seen so many Christian praising God on Sunday but during the week sinning and cussing up a storm.  ><|`|macZI2dzaa	You have not distinguished between people and ideas.  I attack errant ideas with passion and truth, because I love those who espouse such ideas and because I do not want others to be deceived by error.<br>  I do not attack other people, it is anti-theists that mock, insult and attack people.  People are to be loved, ideas that are evil should be attacked.<br>  Perfection goes beyond the reach of us all.  And I did notice that you pigeon hole all Christians, which is ignorant on your part.

They want others to see that they're "grieving" and give them attention.<br>  <br>  Listen about this girl I know:<br>  <br>  She's one of the "popular" ones. She has a huge holier than thou attitude and if you're not in her crowd, she won't give you the time of day. A kid at our school (a "loser" by her standards) died in a car wreck. She had pics all over her myspace of him and wrote a huge paragraph about how she missed him so much.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  It made me so mad!<br>  Sorry for the long answer..but i think it is disrespectful to act like you were buddy buddy. She should say I'm sorry for their loss to the family if she feels the need, then she should leave it alone.
ANuwrzQ3aa	At the beginning, I would like to respect for your curiosity and deep knowledge on Japanese. First is about pronunciations of Japanese. There are tow methods;　Kun-yomi which comes from the original Japanese Yamato-kotoba ,and On-yomi which was affected by Chinese. For example, when山水 is pronounced by kunnyomi as yamamizu it means a water of a mountain, when pronounced by onnyomi as sansui it usually means a natural scenery in a mountain area. Nakazora is kunnyomi and tyuukuu is onnyomi, and these have different roots. Nakazora was used in the old time and is not used in the modern Japan at all. Tyuukuu is sort of an engineering term meaning hollw. From the dictionary;<br>  ちゅうくう 中空 tyuukuu<br>  1 〈なかぞら〉nakazora<br>  中空に in midair; in the air.<br>  2 〈うつろ〉 hollowness<br>  中空の hollow.<br>  There is a problem of the electric dictionary that both of onnyomi and kunnyomi is converted to one index of Kanji word. So, mixtures easily happen. I write this based on Japanese useable in common, but there might be usage like “fly into 中空tyuukuu” in some comics . <br>  <br>  Appendix:<br>  空中(kuutyuu) is used like;<br>  空中に飛び出す fly into the air<br>     <br>  If you have some interesting about Nakazora used in the song in medieval era; <a href="http://dictionary.goo.ne.jp/search.php?MT=%A4%CA%A4%AB%A4%BE%A4%E9&kind=jn&mode=0&kwassist=0" rel="nofollow">http://dictionary.goo.ne.jp/search.php?M...</a>|`|hUhxjEWaaa	Nakazora and chuukuu both express the same thing when they mean mid-air, only chuukuu would be used more in literature and nakazora in speech. That said, chuukuu also has the meaning of there being nothing in the center of something, unlike nakazora.|`|AA10948829	Nakazora and chuukuu are both applicable pronunciations.

It is impossible to lose or "leave" salvation. <br>  <br>  The truth about Jesus is that the only way to be saved and to get into heaven and avoid being sent to eternal hell, is by believing in faith alone that Jesus, who is God, died for our sins on the cross as FULL PAYMENT for all our sins, and then Jesus rose from the dead (1 Corinthians 15:1-4). Believe this and you will be in heaven, no matter what! <br>  <br>  Please pray now: "Jesus, please forgive me of my sins. I believe that You died on the cross for my sins and You rose from the dead. Thank You for eternal life!" You will be in heaven with Him forever when you die. :)|`|9741a3f7ecd87afb6df1b22885eb0f22aa	There is NOTHING in the Bible which would exclude a gay person who believes that Christ died for their sins, so YES, they would go to heaven.

rqJSk1omaa	I don't think you need to be so concerned about putting a name or a label to your sexuality. Just love who you want to. <br>  <br>  I'm not gay, I've only ever wanted to go for guys.

(:|`|sco7IP3gaa	For most people, it depends on what you are most sexually attracted to.|`|5YlSBTNNaa	Give it time.

It has everything to do with hormones and nothing to do with sexuality, in most cases.<br>  <br>  Television and movies have made it fashionable for girls to label themselves bisexual and "dabble" in same-sex relationships, even though most girls who do this are straight.  Some are doing it because it's considered cool and others don't realize that it's normal to experience same-sex crushes, but that those attractions usually vanish when hormone levels normalize.  The hipness of "playing lesbian" actually makes life harder for kids who are struggling to accept their genuine homosexuality.  For them, sexual orientation isn't something they can wear for a while and discard when it's no longer in style.  Very often, they're used and tossed aside by peers who want to satisfy their curiosity and test their own boundaries without the risk of being labeled gay.<br>  <br>  A lot of people will tell you to experiment with both guys and girls and then decide your orientation, but that's will probably only confuse you more.  Any human being can enjoy physical stimulation from another person, regardless of gender.  A gay man doesn't turn bisexual or straight if he sleeps with a woman any more than a lesbian becomes bisexual or straight from sleeping with a man.  The acts are just acts and anyone can do them and enjoy them, but that has no bearing on orientation.  Sexual orientation is as innate to someone as eye color or musical talent.  Nobody gets to "decide" what it is, no matter how fashionable a particular orientation may be.  And sexual orientation often doesn't make itself completely clear until late adolescence or early adulthood.  That's why there are so many kids who think they're bisexual in high school, but very few people who don't identify as either straight or gay once they're in their 20s or older.  <br>  <br>  Don't stick yourself with a label, since the odds are huge it won't apply to you in a few years.  I have a friend who announced she was bisexual at 15 because she was attracted to other girls.  By the time she entered college, she knew she was straight.  More than a decade later, there are still people who won't let her forget that she came to a stupid and wrong conclusion when she was a confused kid fighting an epic battle with hormones.  And she's the first to admit she wouldn't have labeled herself bisexual if it hadn't been considered cool to do so.<br>  <br>  I was desperately confused about my orientation during my teen years and wavered between thinking I was gay or straight.  But when I was 19, it became clear that I was a lesbian, even though I'd never dated another girl.  As far as coming out to people, I just handle that on a person-to-person basis.  When there's a natural opening in conversation where the news would fit comfortably, I'll mention it.  The less of a big deal I make of it, the less it matters to other people.<br>  <br>  If you've always been attracted to guys and the attractions to girls started during adolescence, odds are you're completely straight.  But if you've always been attracted to girls and the crushes on guys came about recently, you could very well be a lesbian.  The only way to be sure is to wait until your orientation makes itself known.  Just don't jump to any conclusion while you're still in the throes of teenage hormones, since those have tormented girls for centuries.  Sexual orientation always sorts itself out over time.  Just be patient, since you don't get to choose your orientation, anyway.  In a few years, you'll know exactly who you were meant to be.|`|wnSvjwWuaa	I was 9 years old, and I wanted to be with this gorgeous classmate from Canada all the time. Fortunately we were seatmates so it wasn't really a stretch to "bump" my knee to his "accidentally". He was very nice but there's no way I could have said if he also felt some attraction or he was just being nice.<br>  <br>  Either way, I knew that I was gay, period. Thinking or imagining about girls, and their "parts" makes me physically ill. No offense, girls, that's the way I was built. I'm sure the lesbians here will agree that they feel the same way thinking about any man's "equipment".|`|86ZdwbB7aa	how did i know <br>  <br>  i knew when i kissed a girl it was ... boring and was weired for me i just didn't like it i actually lied to the girl that i was feeling sick so she didn't kiss me again <br>  <br>  Then i kissed a guy and it was like wow ... not like when i kissed a girl it was brilliant|`|Idt6DUmmaa	i knew for sure that i was bi when I had feelings for my friend.

BhzCW1rYaa	During the time of the kings, the Roman army was developed by each tribe providing 1000 infantry and 100 cavalry. During the Republic, the army was called up during times of trouble. Later, a permanent army was developed.<br>  <br>  For many poor Romans, a career in the army was inviting.. They were required to be at least eighteen years old and at least five and a half feet tall. Often it was helpful to get a letter of recommendation to increase the chances of being chosen. A legionnaire<br>  could earn about three hundred denarii a year. Some of the money was kept by the army for food, pensions, and equipment. A soldier could serve for twenty five years and then retire with a pension. While in the army, the solider was not allowed to marry, but many had girlfriends in settlements near their fort or base camp (in A.D. 197 this rule was lifted and soldiers were allowed to marry). Non-Roman citizens could serve in the army as auxiliary soldiers and receive Roman citizenship and a pension or a piece of land after a twenty-five year tour.<br>  <br>  The army was spilt into large groups known as legions. During the time of Hadrian, about thirty legions were stationed around the empire to protect the borders. The legions were not allowed into Rome itself, except during parades celebrating a great victory. Only the personal guards of the emperor, known as the Praetorian Guard, were allowed in the city limits.<br>  <br>  The army served not only as the protector of the empire, but was also the organization which built much of the large road system in the empire. Each legion had among its ranks trained stonemasons to help build roads and fort walls. The roads allowed the army to quickly shift men to problem areas. The army could average twenty-one miles a day on the roads. These road systems also provided a good system for transporting goods throughout the empire. <br>  <a href="http://historylink102.com/Rome/roman-army.htm" rel="nofollow">http://historylink102.com/Rome/roman-arm...</a><br>  There is also other information contained in this page...<br>  In Light... )O(
NEkssyeAaa	I dont think its jsut white people mate, there are loads of nationalities who turn to Atheists. Just because you are in a religion doesnt mean you practice the religion, (All fingers pointing at me, hides behind the curtain)|`|t6sDVUI4aa	White people are raised to be rational thinkers and not emotional feelers. They are culturally more inclined to trust science and modern thought than ancient superstition and beliefs. This is most prevalent in the technologically advanced west where science and technology rule society. Example note the Appalachia, the poorest part of the United States, also the bayous of the deep south. There superstitions are rife. Most of the people there are farmers and the educational system is lacking at best. Also note the Native Americans, many of them still hold their ancient belief system and they are a very very spiritual people, and among our poorest. By profession I am a magician I find that whites are the hardest to elicit a reaction from, where as black people tend to be easier. Women of any nationality tend to be more receptive to magic than their male counterparts.

(haha, okay really lame joke..just accept it lol)<br>  <br>  if you ask generally, I shall answer generally:<br>  <br>  generally speaking, we can take a joke, accept we have such high respect for our Prophet(sws) and God that it's not really appropriate...you should respect such things as a good person, it's really just manners<br>  <br>  regarding the girls wearing the clothes...it's actually women who are required to wear them...<br>  it's modesty b/c Islam is about modesty and moderation, practicality and rationality<br>  women are like jewels, to be honest...from head to toe, throughout history women have been admired in all different forms of expressions throughout culture...then again, this admiration became abused in the past and even in the current times<br>  in the past, women kept their chests bare for all to see and men treated them like slaves and just bodies, not minds<br>  Islam came and gave elevation to the woman's role in many ways socially, economically, and politically...and women were pushed to learn as much as men in education and what not<br>  <br>  in the present, society seems to be working backwords...women are seen as objects to reveal and stick next to car commercials and beer commercials...ever wonder why? they just want to use their bodies<br>  <br>  the concept of covering oneself is to respect your own body...<br>  as jewels, you should protect yourselves from the greedy eyes of lustful predators, and modest clothing does just that<br>  <br>  idk about his personal situation w/his house and what not...but it probably goes along the line of respecting others' households as a guest...don't get too comfortable...idk about the long sleeves though<br>  <br>  arranged marriages:<br>  there's an issue here as "arranged marriages" where the people are married to others without knowing them and w/o consent...this is in culture, NOT religion..NOT in Islam<br>  <br>  it's prohibited to force someone to marry someone else w/o their approval first....it's strictly says NOT ALLOWED<br>  consent must be given by the future bride and groom<br>  in "Islam"...it's more of an "assisted marriage", not what you commonly know as "arranged"<br>  assisted marriages are just using the help of parents to find the perfect person for you, b/c in Islam, marriage is like a major deal...it should be like that in life anyways...so the utmost importance should be given to finding a suitable match and parents and relatives are asked to help out sometimes...that's "assisted"...and then the couples get to know each other (like a chaperoned date..there are reasons for this) and decide if they're good for each other or not..and then you have a marriage<br>  <br>  most muslims don't blow stuff up...Islam is the MOST diverse religion and fastest growing...and all these people have a whole lot more things to worry about than blowing things up.<br>  <br>  suicide is prohibited in Islam, so "suicide bombers" are not Muslims<br>  harming others w/o the purpose of self-deference is also not allowed...<br>  most of what you see in media is biased against Islam b/c that's the hottest topic and will get the most ratings<br>  also, media reps. only the smallest voice, but the loudest...it doesn't rep the majority of Muslims b/c they do good deeds..good deeds are quiet in media, bad deeds are loud and get the most ratings<br>  <br>  praying:<br>  5 times a day...yea...that explains it basically<br>  <br>  :)<br>  <br>  hope I helped<br>  <br>  peace|`|AA12242211	:s congrats, you get the longest sentence award.|`|dAcNaajsaa	Read the Qur'aan.|`|ttCkz39aaa	They have much faith in their god|`|AnDtMTqyaa	Islam is the religion of peace. islam never told people to blow themselves up to kill innocent people.<br>  those who do that in the name of islam arent muslims in anyway and they just destroy the real peacfull face of islam to the non-muslims.<br>  <br>  and about the veil part.. i cant discuss it with u until u are convinced first with islam.. but in short , islam protects the woman from getting sexually harrased or rapped by wearing clothes that dont attract attentions of other people , thats the whole idea about wearing such clothes.|`|vtTUn0zcaa	not all muslims are hard core...

h07uBpjNaa	A few thoughts on this.<br>  <br>  First, whether it's odd or not depends on the standard you use. Using the world's standard, it seems odd because the world's standard is "every man for himself." The world's standard refuses to accept the supernatural. The world's standard refuses to accept that man isn't in control. By God's standard, however, it's not odd at all. In fact, by God's standard, the world looks pretty silly. Imagine thinking that the universe somehow created itself! Or imagine denying the Big Bang theory which states that the universe had a finite beginning in time. (Anything with a finite beginning had to have a creator.)<br>  <br>  Second, belief in God is not hostile to science. In fact, science pretty much got started because people of faith agreed that God made the world in an orderly fashion operating according to laws and principles that could be discovered an learned. Science is not inconsistent with faith. I've already mentioned the Big Bang. The Bible says God spoke and the universe came into existence. Would that not look like a big explosion? Science also tells us that the delicate balance of gravity, temperature, chemicals and all that is so very finely tuned that the likelihood that it evolved to its present state is nearly zero. Mathematicians have used super computers to calculate the probability that life as we know it evolved over billions of years. The probability is so low as to be non-existent. In fact, they concluded that it would not be possible no matter how much time we gave the process. Science also tells us that observed mutations are never beneficial. This notion that creatures somehow developed things like eyes defies logic--you need the whole eye in one fell swoop. Evolving piece parts wouldn't give benefit to the host. (Now there is such a thing as adaptation where creatures can change characteristics in response to environment, but they can't change their fundamental nature.)<br>  <br>  Honest scientists who aren't drinking the religious Koolaid of their anti-God, anti-creation peers admit that there is evidence that points to creation.<br>  <br>  Third, there is experience. Is there not a part in each of us that longs to be part of something bigger, part of the creator's story? Some drown it with booze, others sex, others knowledge for knowledge's sake, but we all have it. When western missionaries are first to reach remote tribes they *always* find that the tribes believe in God. How? By the common grace given to all mankind by the creator.<br>  <br>  You should check out a book or two that I have listed in the sources section. They will help you have answers. Everybody ought to know why they believe what they believe.|`|juG4WPQ5aa	Faith is good .Understanding is good .|`|a9r82MRIaa	As odd as any belief, or lack thereof.|`|h3Xbi8fVaa	I think it is odd to believe in god in todays world.<br>  <br>  faith is acceptance without evidence and if you were told to have acceptance without faith in any other area other than god you would think it was mad.<br>  <br>  Stupid science gives mankind real evidence and real benefits. If it wasn't for science we would be in the dark ages....no medicine, no electricity or computers just to name a few.<br>  <br>  My opinion is god doesn't exist. There is no evidence that he/she or they exist. Science explains many aspects of life with evidence.|`|yHfsHp6naa	It's very odd and inexplicable to a rational person why anyone would think a supernatural being actually exists.|`|2MfMyh4Maa	All scientific answers/formulas as to how something happened contain a random variable that we often call chance.  Chance is merely a formula that declares our lack of knowledge.  <br>  <br>  As a result, science will never be able to predict anything with certainty.  Suppose for example that scientists prove that a meteor killed off the dinosaurs thus making an earth that is more hospitable to humans.  But what caused the meteor to hit the earth?  At that point, science turns to speculation.  "Well, it may have been that somewhere in deep space two meteors collided..". <br>  <br>  Science is useful to help us try our best to control our environment however science can never say that God didn't intervene.   <br>  <br>  All of the scientists in the world put together will never be able to say what I'm going to write next so to them, my writings are by chance.|`|NXCMRb8waa	Well what has happened is that science has not eliminated God but made him very optional.

AA10100036	I don't think the intention was that everyone be an expert on everything.  I'm pretty sure the original idea was that if you were an "expert" or at least knowledgeable about a topic, that these sites would draw those people.  Then they could share their knowledge easily and everyone could learn.   The way everything has developed, now the responsibility for verifying that information lies with the person who needs to use it.
G9dZN8omaa	I've always wondered if the Bible didn't have things backwards.<br>  <br>  Think about it: bad people can go to Heaven if they believe in Jesus, and good people will go to Hell for using the brains "God" gave them.  <br>  <br>  Using that scenario, Heaven will be full of child molesters, rapists, and  murderers; Hell will be full of people who obeyed man's laws and believed in equal rights.<br>  <br>  I don't believe in God, but following that line of thinking, I'd rather be in Hell.|`|AA11135281	Many illogical, contradictory, and utterly fantastic things are believed in the name of religion.

You must remember that the Bible was written by humans, changed drastically over time by more councils than you can count, to the point where if it once was inspired by God, it is not so much anymore.  In addition, in multiple apocrypha books it is said that hell is only for demons, and all humans end up in the same place after death-- After all, what would happen to some tribe in Africa who's never heard of God- Will they burn in hell for lack of knowledge?    The fact of the matter is GOD is the ONLY ONE who has any authority as to say who or what happens to you after you die (anyone who proclaims what will happen to you is blaspheming the holy Name of God!), and I can assure you that God is not as big of a jerk as the "christian" religion claims Him to be.|`|Qyue0Ykgaa	Allah guides who he wills.

This is not a second chance, but rather God knows that there are a myriad of reasons why a person never finds real truth in<br>  the flesh.  These will be TAUGHT, NOT BURNED.<br>  People simply do not understand when they are reading idioms or figures of speech so common in the Greek.<br>  No person will be judged until after this teaching period expires.<br>  Not even Satan himself who is already judged and condemned to<br>  perish, is in any kind of "hell" -  he is standing at the Throne of God<br>  accusing Gods children day and night, which is why one of his many names is "the Accuser".<br>  <br>  After the teaching period expires comes the Great Judgement. Those who are found guilty will follow Satan and his cronies into what is called the "Lake of Fire", which has the ability to destroy both the spiritual body and the soul and will take only as long as it will to step<br>  into it, and be turned to ashes from within.  Not even the memory of you will exist, as if you never lived at all.  Nobody fries like a slab of<br>  bacon for all eternity; it simply is NOT written.<br>  In a nutshell, either ya make it or ya don't.  There will be nothing left<br>  in the eternity that offends;  that means no pit with bad old Uncle Henry screaming for mercy as he burns and his skin melts.  <br>  In fact, God states that this is "molech practice" and the thought of<br>  burning people NEVER ENTERED HIS MIND.  He HATES IT.<br>  <br>  This is not to say that you are doing yourself any favors by setting yourself up as the enemy of God; what it does mean is that when Christ returns we will all (whether we are bad or good) be immediately<br>  changed back into spiritual bodies, but a person who is an athiest will realize that although they are changed into that spiritual body, they<br>  still have a soul that is mortal (liable to die).<br>  That will NOT be a good state to be in, and on top of that, since you<br>  are an athiest and do not repent of sin, you will be held accountable<br>  for every single sin you have ever committed, from the least of them<br>  to the greatest of them.  Hopefully if you are able to be taught, then<br>  the countless sins you will still have to answer to, will not affect the<br>  decision made in Judgement.  One thing that would hold weight, is<br>  whether you fought actively against God and his children.  Some people are just athiests, and then others work to rid the Nation of God, destroy Churches, threaten Christians, etc.....<br>  Nobody knows how your particular case will end up - you know better<br>  than anyone else, certainly NOT YOUR FRIEND.  <br>  <br>  God is Judge because he is called the cardio-knower: he is able to<br>  read the heart (mind) so he cannot be conned.  We do not have that<br>  ability and so human beings are not able to be fair or accurate <br>  Judges.<br>  <br>  Being a "good person" is nice, but I wouldn't rely too heavily on it.<br>  When Satan was beguiling Eve in the Garden, I assure you that he<br>  was particularly "nice".|`|dbgQgYscaa	Going to heaven or hell has nothing to do with what you believe. The apparent gap between the death and the birth of a human being is that period in which a soul has experiences of the predominant counterpart of the opposite impressions gathered by the recently dissociated human-form. <br>  <br>  If the predominant counterpart of the impressions of opposites (such as virtue and vice, good and evil, male and female, etc.), as experienced by the soul now associated only with the subtle and mental, is of virtue or goodness (i.e., the positive aspect of the opposite impressions), then the soul is said to be in heaven. If it is of vice or evil (i.e., the negative aspect of opposite impressions), then the soul is said to be in hell. <br>  <br>  The states of heaven and hell are nothing but states of intensive experiences of the consciousness of the soul, experiencing either of the predominant counterparts of the opposite impressions while the soul is dissociated from the gross human body or form. The soul itself does not go to heaven or hell, as is the general belief, because it is eternally infinite and eternally in the Over-Soul. It is the consciousness of the soul, which experiences the impressions. <br>  <br>  As soon as the predominant counterpart of impressions is experienced and exhausted, and just when equilibrium is about to be maintained between the opposites of impressions of the last human -form that was dropped, at this juncture the soul automatically associates with the next-most human-form, molded of the consolidated impressions of opposites which were about to be in a state of equilibrium. Thus the gross consciousness of the soul, after experiencing either hell or heaven, associates with the next human-form (takes another birth) to experience and exhaust the residual opposite impressions of the last birth. As has already been said, this next human - form of the soul is nothing but the consolidated mold of the residual opposite impressions of the last form.|`|k513KYH8aa	Assuming an afterlife exists, I don't think God would a that big of a douche-bag. As long as you are able to go into the world and actually see the difference between what makes your gut turn, and what makes you feel happy and do something about the former(and only if you are able to without serious risk of your person) then I would think that God would just catch you up on the details of what really has been going on, and that is also assuming that he exists. If your good you should make it, but don't be scared to f*** up now and then. If anything your friend should probably go to hell for scaring someone so much for not believing in something they feel they shouldn't have to and causing such a conundrum. Oh and no offense to your friend, but a lot of people who say they are Christian do a lot of dumb things to get people to be convinced there is a god. Anyway I should know this too, I was raised Catholic so it's not like someone is spewing bullsh** as advice for you.|`|lJ2baVliaa	You are completely misunderstanding.  We were all athiests at one time.  Every person on this planet.  Until we learned about Jesus and accepted Him into our hearts.  Someone who accepts Jesus into their hearts will not be a serial killer!  Just because someone is religious doesn't make them a Christian... read Matthew 7:21.  Being a "good" person doesn't get you into heaven.  Anyone who doesn't love Jesus and refuses to follow Him in everything He wills for them to do... is not worthy of heaven.  He makes that very clear in Matthew 10:37.<br>  <br>  Jesus says in John 15:10 "If you obey my commands, you will remain in my love, just as I have obeyed my Father's commands and remain in his love." ... so we MUST OBEY His commands.  So anyone who claims "Lord, Lord" to be a Christian (as it states in Matthew 7:21) yet refuses to obey Him, is not from Him and is not worthy of Him!<br>  <br>  And 1 John 2:3 tells us... "We know that we have come to know him if we obey his commands."<br>  <br>  And it's important to understand that the word repent means to turn away from.  Anyone who claims to have repented yet still continue to do the bad things they did (such as "serial killing" as you put it)... they have not truly repented.  We all must repent, which means saying we are sorry for our sins and then turning completely away from them.<br>  <br>  I'm sorry that the person who ministered to you didn't explain it in a way you could understand.  I pray this explains it a little better.|`|VE33luKcaa	According to the Muslims, the Christians are burning in hell. It depends on what you believe is the "right" and "wrong" way of living life and what's the definition of heaven and hell.

There are so called Christians who do not kill, drink alcohol, commit sexual sins, or cuss and think they are OK but they ignore compassion, mercy and spend a lot of time killing people with gossip. They are wrong.<br>  <br>  A Christian is one who follows the precepts as laid out in the Bible especially under the scriptures that give the description for the fruits of the Spirit.  This is done continually in their life.<br>  <br>  Your friend sounds like a Baptist, who believe once one is saved they are always saved.  They are washed in the blood of Jesus, Glory Halleujah.  Based on their belief, then all l will ever need is one bath and I will be clean forever?  No I take a bath daily, in the same way I have to go to Jesus daily for forgivness.<br>  <br>  One who has committed murder, can find Jesus as his Lord and go to heaven.  However, there will be such a radical change in his life, that there would be no doubt that he has found the Lord as his Saviour.<br>  <br>  Our example in this is Paul who was touched in such a mighty way that he spent his life trying to make up for the killing of Christians.  Because he was a Roman, he did not break any earthly laws, but he broke God's law and spent the rest of his life trying to make it right.<br>  <br>  It is the heart that has to change.  Many profess a heart knowledge of God, but in essence it is only a head knowledge.  They do not have a changed heart.<br>  <br>  Bill Clinton used to be shown coming out of church, carrying a huge Bible and many referred to him as a Christian, even when he was lying about the ML stuff.<br>  <br>  If the religious people who saw Jesus' miracles refused to believe and eventually kill him, then I can understand why you would not believe in Him.  <br>  <br>  I like to garden.  When I put a small tomato seed into the earth and it grows and produces many tomatoes with thousands of seeds in them that can produce millions of tomatoes, then I know God is there, especailly when it does not matter in what direction I plant that seed, it always comes up the right way.  <br>  <br>  When I look into the sky at night and see all the stars, then I know that God exist.|`|AA11849917	If a person is a serial killer, he's not a Christian.

Not everyone who accept Jesus is going to heaven, because Jesus himself says, Luke 13:26   Then shall ye begin to say, We have eaten and drunk in thy presence, and thou hast taught in our streets.<br>  27   But he shall say, I tell you, I know you not whence ye are; depart from me, all ye workers of iniquity. Let me ask you this. If you don't believe in God why do you care? If you are wishy washy about your belief, ask God to reveal himself to you. Wait on him to answer, and believe me he will. Before I became a believer and a follower, I had no care if hell was real or not. But I tried it. I prayed and God actually spoke to me through my spirit. It was not a voice in my head, but it was in my spirit and I have been following him ever since. But to answer your question. Would you accept someone into your life if they failed to not believe in you?

And that ye slay not the life which Allah hath made sacred, save in the course of justice. This He hath command you, in order that ye may discern.  <br>  <br>  Arberry <br>  Say: 'Come, I will recite what your Lord has forbidden you: that you associate not anything with Him, and to be good to your parents, and not to slay your children because of poverty; We will provide you and them and that you approach not any indecency outward or inward, and that you slay not the soul God has forbidden, except by right. That then He has charged you with; haply you will understand. <br>  <br>  Shakir<br>  Say: Come I will recite what your Lord has forbidden to you-- (remember) that you do not associate anything with Him and show kindness to your parents, and do not slay your children for (fear of) poverty-- We provide for you and for them-- and do not draw nigh to indecencies, those of them which are apparent and those which are concealed, and do not kill the soul which Allah has forbidden except for the requirements of justice; this He has enjoined you with that you may understand.  <br>  <br>  Sarwar <br>  (Muhammad), say, "Let me tell you about what your Lord has commanded: Do not consider anything equal to God; Be kind to your parents; Do not murder your children out of fear of poverty, for We give sustenance to you and to them.

He is the one and only Lord - cherisher. The mention of goodness to parents immediately after "belief in one Allah" suggests that Allah's love of us and care for us - in a higher sense - must be understood by reference to the parental love, which is purely unselfish; therefore, our first duty among our fellow creatures is to our father and mother, whose love leads us to the conception of divine love. Arising from our goodness to parents is our duty and love to our children. As said in verse 142 of this surah, the bounties of the Lord are in abundance, so, for fear of poverty, it is ungodly to slay our children. Then comes the moral prohibitions against the lewdness and all unseemly acts, relating to sex or otherwise, open or secret; and the prohibition of killing and fighting. All these injunctions are in our own interest, if we understand the divine plan.|`|89a4e35709fd20d8fa340ef1d5a3bac3aa	Wa alaikum salam wa rahmatullahi wa barakatuh .I do not see any contradiction in the Qur'an.Surah 6 Al An'am verse 151 in my own understanding is : Say (Muhammad pbuh)Let Me tell you what Allah has really prohibited (disallowed or haram) for you.You  shall not make ally at all besides Him.,you should  make good doings to your parents,you shall not kill your children due to poverty.We (Allah and angels) give subsistence (rezeki) to you and to them.,do not approach the cruel acts,obviously or hidden,do not kill persons who are not allowed (haram)by Allah,except with the true reason(qisas,kill the murtad etc).These are Allah's commands in order you understand it.<br>  It means that Allah prohibites us(1) to make ally such as regarded Isa Al Masih as the son of Allah(2)kill our children due to poverty (3)getting near to cruel acts (bad doings) and (4)kill persons who are not allowed by Allah except with true reason.Honor or make good doings to our parents is the command of Allah.This is not a prohibition.So there is no contradiction.|`|GF8VLkxDaa	It's not.

It's what Allah has forbidden and allowed us to do.<br>  <br>  It's something bad, followed by something good, followed by something bad.<br>  <br>  i.e honour parents, and do not kill children due to starvation, Allah will provide for them.(EXAMPLE, NOT WORD FOR WORD)|`|SZFnQ3PRaa	That's the ten comamdments from Allah|`|Wd1vUx3Vaa	it's simple.<br>  prohibition was refering to the ' set up idols behind him'.

SINCE IT WAS A DICTATION/SPEECH INITIALLY UNTIL IT WAS MADE INTO A COMPILATION, IT IS NORMAL TO HAVE THAT KIND OF SPEECH TECHNIQUE.<br>  Also look at the WORD prohibited, it has several meanings DEPENDING on the translator, and several uses of the word. The true root word of the quran can never be understood by linguists and never fully interpretated hence english qur'an isn't qur'an but a translation of the qur'an.<br>  <br>  if you understood the puritan arabic, perhaps you would see no contradiction<br>  <br>  <br>  Also as the other answerer mentioned, every line has a following opposition, so for example, don't kill, God has made life sacred. The sentence 'You shall honour your parents' IF it was combined to the preceeding statement to make an opposition, then grammatically according to the interpretation, the syntax would be incorrect.<br>  <br>  Another meaning for prohibition is also 'limited' 'set out' 'given allowance' 'given importance' to.<br>  So if you consider that, then it is all okay

It is impossible to lose or "leave" salvation. <br>  <br>  The truth about Jesus is that the only way to be saved and to get into heaven and avoid being sent to eternal hell, is by believing in faith alone that Jesus, who is God, died for our sins on the cross as FULL PAYMENT for all our sins, and then Jesus rose from the dead (1 Corinthians 15:1-4). Believe this and you will be in heaven, no matter what! <br>  <br>  Please pray now: "Jesus, please forgive me of my sins. I believe that You died on the cross for my sins and You rose from the dead.

JWjq5iaXaa	It's more of a legend, though not many people know it. Here are some people's testimonies on the legend:<br>  <br>  <br>  Ashley writes:<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  Bloody Mary was Mary Tudor, Queen of England, and daughter of King Henry the 8th and Catherine of Aragon. All her life, she was a mean brat to her little sister, Elizabeth and her brother Edward VI. She did not like them at all and was very jealous. When Edward VI died, she became Queen Mary of England. She was hated all over for changing the religion in England from Protestant to Roman Catholic. She mass-murdered over 100 Protestant leaders, earning her name as "Bloody Mary".<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  And yes, I have seen Bloody Mary. My friends and I decided to try it out. This is what we did:<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  1) We went into the bathroom.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  2) Turned out the lights.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  3) Ran the water.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  4) Spun around 3 times saying "Bloody Mary."<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  5) Closed our eyes and held hands until we heard anything. (not saying this way is right or wrong, we just did it like that.)<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  There was a low 'thump' and we opened our eyes. There was a bloody dark-haired girl covered in blood. But it was very very dark, so very hard to tell. All she did was look at us, like an image painted on the mirror. Then we got scared and turned on the light, and whatever it was, was gone.<br>  <br>  This is the true story of Bloody Mary.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  Nikki writes:<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  The legend of it here in Jackson, Michigan goes like this: A long time ago there was a little girl named Mary. She must have gotten in an accident because she went into a coma. At this time doctors didn't know what a coma was, so they thought she was dead. They buried her alive! Every night Mary's mother thought that she heard a scream coming from Mary's grave, but no one believed her.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  Finally one day Mary's mother convinced them to dig up her grave. When they did, they found scratches on the top of the coffin and Mary's fingernails were all bloody. There are many different things that I have heard that will happen when you say "Bloody Mary" in the mirror. The most popular one here is that you will see Mary in the mirror walking down a case of stairs. She may be holding a knife. If she is, you must turn on the lights or she'll kill you. Also she could be holding a rose or teddy bear, and then she won't kill you.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  Mary's "so called" grave is also here in Jackson. I have been to it. It's out in the woods and you have to walk through a lot of trails to get there. When you finally do, you have to walk up a big hill and there is a big tombstone on top that just says Mary. There are also other tombstones, too. Mary's grave was removed recently because the coffins were beginning to stick out of the ground.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  Matty writes:<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  This is a very touchy subject for me. The whole Bloody Mary thing is true, for I truthfully know it is. This took place in a small town called Newport, MI, just north of Monroe. On June 22, 1999, in the Monroe Evening Newspaper, there’s an article about my best friend, Mike. We were only thirteen at the time, you know the age of curiosity and the first time hearing the legend of Bloody Mary. It was around ten or eleven at night, when the moon is covered by trees, so there’s very little light. We both wanted to try it out, but to this day, I am glad I never went in with him. He went into the bathroom by himself because we thought it wouldn’t work if we both tried it at the same time.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  The legend we heard was that you had to light six candles, write 666 on the mirror with anything red (we used lipstick,) and say "Bloody Mary" six times. My friend did these things because we wrote the stuff and lit the candles before we shut the door. I heard him say "Bloody Mary." Nothing happened for ten minutes, he didn’t make any noise and I could still see the lights from the candles under the bathroom door. I didn't think much of it and went downstairs to get something to drink. When I came back, I was a little worried because I could see no candlelight and the bathroom door was locked. I pounded on the door until his dad asked what I was doing.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  His dad believed that we accidentally locked the door, so he got his lock-pick set. When he got the lock undone, the door was stuck when we pushed on it. After about fifteen minutes of pushing, there was a thump and when the door opened, my friend was kneeling on the ground and his head was in the sink. My friend died doing this stupid legend. Please, don't any of you make the same mistake.|`|zOX3bunMaa	It's a myth, because it ain't real.

zdu3gh8jaa	Just don't go there for a few weeks. Stay in touch by phone and when she asks why you don't go around for tea any more, just say because you find the way you are spoken to hurtful. Tell her that you are grateful for guidance and you will always go to her for advice when you need it, but at 29 you feel that you are quite capable in the art of table clearing, kitchen cleaning etc etc so you really would prefer that you were not told how to do these things. I had similar problems with my late mum some years ago and this is how I handled it. I explained that as I had my own home I was well aware how to clean a bathroom or do the windows without any guidance from a third person. I wasn't being nasty but just reminding her that I was independent enough to do the jobs around the home without needing someone to tell me all the time how to do them. I also stopped going round there for a while and just talked to her on the phone, by doing this things improved.<br>  I hope this helps in some way and that the situation improves for you too. Good luck, I wish you all the best in the future.|`|GWRP3vLQaa	Okay, here is some help. You are 29 years old and you don't have to waste your time sniping back and forth with your mother and grandmother. As long as you play by their rules, you will lose. Just tell her/them that you have things to do, and leave. <br>  <br>  You mother still views you as a child, especially when gran is around to back her up. And until you show her that you don't have to sit there and take it, she will continue to do so. We teach people how to treat us.<br>  <br>  At some point, you may get the chance to tell her that when she can treat you nicely, you will visit more often. And stick to it. Good luck.|`|9uI3hvGdaa	Your an adult.  If you don't like the way they treat you, then don't put up with it.  If you are too cowardice to stand up for yourself, then don't go over to your mother's house.  If anyone treated me like that, they'd get an earful back, I don't care if it's my mother, grandmother or the Pope!|`|676ffb2c003e629d54b40e0eb68860f4aa	I would tell her to stop treating you like that or you will stop going over there.

AA10311549	MANY Christian denominations, even main line Christian denominations, believe that loving committed same-sex unions are MORAL and blessed by God.  <br>  <br>  As for abortion, some Christian denominations, even conservative ones, would allow abortions for some specific reasons, for example to save the life of the mother.<br>  <br>  The Christian communities over the centuries had been divided on many issues.  Note that the Southern Baptist split from the Northern baptists over the issue of slavery, and most white Southern baptists churches would not even allow blacks into their congregations until well into the latter half of the 20th century.<br>  <br>  Many Biblical scholars believe that there are in fact NO condemnation of homosexuality per se nor of committed loving relationships between two gay people.<br>  <br>  What the Bible is condemning is lust. Romans I, the main source of people thinking that homosexuality is condemned is in fact stating that people who have FIRST abandoned God are then given over to their lusts. <br>  <br>  The other two places that some people state speaks of homosexuality contain words that no one is really quite sure how to translate because one is quite vague and the other is so rare. In fact only in our modern times have these words been tranbslated as homosexuality or homosexual acts.<br>  <br>  Finally there is the story of Sodom. PLEASE read this entire story for yourself. There is NO condemnation of homosexuality in this story, only heterosexuals wanting to rape two angels. (assumed to be men). All 20+ references in the Bible to the Sodom story make NO reference to homosexuality. Lot, assumed to be the only righteous man in Sodom offers his two virgin daughters to the mob. Yet no one seems to comment on this fact. Nor when these same daughters seduce their father to get pregnant. Surely a story to teach about sexual morality.<br>  <br>  Finally, Christ makes NO mention of homosexuality. Paul had NO concept of homosexuality nor of the possibility of loving relationship between two gay people. Therefore nothing he said can be construed to be speaking about this.<br>  <br>  Many people -- Christian people -- believe that being gay and Christian are NOT in opposition. <br>  <br>  See any of the following sites:<br>  <a href="http://www.soulforce.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.soulforce.org</a><br>  <a href="http://www.gaychristianonline.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.gaychristianonline.org</a><br>  <a href="http://www.gaychurch.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.gaychurch.org</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.gaychristiansurvivors.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.gaychristiansurvivors.com</a><br>  <br>  There are many more including support groups for gay people of specific denominations. <br>  <br>  Catholic: Dignity USA <a href="http://www.dignity.usa.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.dignity.usa.org</a><br>  Evangelicals Concerned: <a href="http://www.ecwr.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.ecwr.org</a><br>  More Light Presbyterians: <a href="http://www.mlp.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.mlp.org</a><br>  United Church of Christ: <a href="http://www.ucccoalition.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.ucccoalition.org</a><br>  and others (google gay and specific denomination)<br>  <br>  There are many excellent books available too for the Gay Christian<br>  "Gay Christian 101" by Rick Brentlinger<br>  [See also the website: <a href="http://gaychristan101.com]" rel="nofollow">http://gaychristan101.com]</a><br>  "The Children are Free" by Rev.

Helminiak<br>  <br>  ====================================<br>  Form the selection of verses given here you get the idea that wow, so that's what the Bible says. Well how about all the verses that the people here conveniently ignore?<br>  <br>  Just because the story of "one flesh" in Genesis speaks of a man and a woman, and to "be fruitful" this in no way condemns a committed homosexual relationship!!!! It does not even speak of homosexual relationships. And by the above logic if one DOES NOT be fruitful -- is that wrong also for heterosexuals? That any marriage where procreation is not possible is also forbidden?<br>  <br>  In Genesis 2:18 it also DOES SAY: ‘It is not good that a human remain alone. Every human has need of a companion of his or her own kind’.”|`|Johiu2cwaa	The more intelligent ones.|`|cf5961a316debfb7203fffd630bd740caa	you are a real christian. you wanna know why? because unlike the others who preach hatred towards homosexuals and women who abort, you show compassion and tolerance. that is what the man jesus taught. he taught compassion, love and tolerance. also, the bible says nothing of abortion and the passage that everyone spouts regarding homosexuals is in the OT, and christians aren't supposed to follow that one anymore. you are a true christian. those who preach hatred and intolerance are the false ones.|`|NWopkX4baa	Homosexuality isn't so black and white when you start looking into the original context and meaning of the passages that discuss same-sex relationships.|`|l7fiAHRLaa	Lots of churches support gay marriage and abortion...

Well, I'd say that would be a Christian who doesn't feel like she has the right to force her opinion on others. A Christian who believes in free will.

Everyone keeps telling me that I can still be Catholic and not believe in everything they do, but I feel like I am not being true to myself or my Children.|`|D0JKJJNeaa	You are a Christian if you believe in the Trinity, father son and holy ghost, and if you fallow the teachings of Jesus than you will recall the commandment  Jesus left us with one commandment , John 15:12 (ISV) This is my commandment: that you love one another as I have loved you.<br>  <br>  If you are true to Jesus teachings than you love every one regardless of who or what they are. And that makes you a Christian, your love for your brother and sister not what a church or any one else tells you.<br>  <br>  I'm Episcopal and the Church I go to supportive of gay marriage, and Abortion is between you and god, and none else. However not all Episcopal Churches agree with my church. There are Churches who agree with your belief but most will not put that on there church pamphlet.

XzksQ3AFaa	Christianity is making an interesting global change... in fact, it is being said that the face of 21st century Christianity is BROWN, not white. <br>  <br>  Evangelical Christianity, especially Pentecostalism or "Charismatic Christianity" is gaining huge numbers of supporters in South America, Africa, and Asia. Catholicism is also important in Central/South America, a relic of Spanish colonialism, and is pretty big in South Africa as well thanks to the Dutch. <br>  <br>  While most of Western Europe seemed to secularize during the latter half of the 20th century, the complete opposite is happening in many of the "missionized" countries around the world. This is why, despite Europe's generally agnostic/atheist attitude as well as the pervasiveness of that trend in the United States and Australia, over 30% of the WORLD still calls itself Christian.<br>  <br>  So the real answer to your question is... everywhere that hasn't been claimed by Hinduism or Islam, especially in continents heavily targeted by 19th and 20th century missions like South America and Africa.|`|8IHfytEvaa	USA, Brazil, South Korea.<br>  <br>  Brazil and South Korea have a higher percent of Christians than the USA.|`|Vjan4Vq2aa	USA has the biggest population of Protestants (me), but Brazil / South America has the biggest population of Catholics.|`|Wo1BkKTBaa	America, the land of the dumb.|`|UnlqJgXIaa	The Vatican|`|Im9cwUIyaa	The Americas.

Something probably happened to make him want to distance himself - could have been a talk with a homophobic relative, a new love interest, or something else.  But you should just ask him for a straight answer - "what is going on?  I want to know if something has changed between us.  You owe me that much so that I can at least move on and not wonder what happened" or something like that.  Perhaps he can clear it up for you.  He's the only one who knows, after all...

Mnm35sjNaa	Your destiny is what you make it.<br>  <br>  It's all about free will.<br>  <br>  My full answer will take a while.  I'll be back.<br>  <br>  . . .<br>  <br>  Your fatalistic outlook ("destiny", "I feel I'm destined", "what does it all matter"), is a common symptom of those who (in my opinion) mistakenly believe in determinism: that all things are predetermined, due to universal causality or because of an omniscient, omnipotent, omnipresent God.<br>  <br>  Until life came along, the universe was ENTIRELY inanimate and all events were physical and determined by cause and effect (causality).<br>  <br>  The advent of life is a milestone in the history of the universe because, for the first time, matter was animate: it had motility, moving about on its own power.  Animate beings are clearly in a different class than inanimate things.<br>  <br>  As far as we know, human beings are the only creatures with both intelligence and freewill.  Human intelligence allows us to understand, anticipate and use causality for our own purposes.  We use it to: power our cities; communicate globally at the speed of light; collide subatomic particles; send men to the moon and unmanned probes beyond our solar system.<br>  <br>  Consciousness is an emergent property of the brain.  According to Wikipedia . . .<br>  <br>  ????"emergence is the way complex systems and patterns arise out of a multiplicity of relatively simple interactions".<br>  <br>  . . . the human brain is a complex system operating on relatively simple electro-chemical interactions.<br>  <br>  Those simple electro-chemical interactions create an electromagnetic (EM) field around the brain.  We've used EEGs for decades to (crudely) measure changes in this field.  But taking multiple, simultaneous, measurements INSIDE the brain, at distances of a millimeter apart, produces much richer and more useful data.<br>  <br>  Researcher Johnjoe McFadden has put forward a leading theory of consciousness called, "The Conscious Electro-Magnetic Information Field Theory" (CEMI Theory, for short).  A key feature of this theory is that the brain's EM field is where the various and diverse activities of the brain are integrated.  Once integrated, the EM field acts as a feedback loop which passes our integrated impulses and thoughts back for checking and decision-making.  In other words, the feedback loop provides us with free will by allowing us to execute or withhold action depending on how we weigh our options and alternatives.<br>  <br>  Free will isn't absolute.  It's constrained by physical laws, self-preservation, ethics, experience, knowledge and context.  In the cases of instinct and reflex we have very little control at all.<br>  <br>  There appears to be a half-second delay between impulse or thought and their corresponding actions.  The human brain is an incredibly efficient and optimized system.  Certain impulses or thoughts (i.e. "stand up now") are almost always appropriate, so it might be optimal to initiate action before the feedback loop comes back with a decision.  In these cases, it would look as if action begins a half-second before its corresponding decision.  This is not material evidence of a deterministic brain . . . just an optimized one.  If, a half-second later, we decide (for some unusual reason) not to stand up after all, we simply stop in mid-effort and sit back down.<br>  <br>  The determinism/free will/compatibilism debate has raged unabated and unresolved for 1600 years: ever since St. Augustine first fleshed out a doctrine of free will to make us responsible for our own actions and accountable to God.  There's no proof for any position but I favor the compatibilist view that free will is compatible with determinism . . . that causality is a physical law we are able to harness for our own purpose.<br>  <br>  You are a free agent.  You're free to accept responsibility for your actions.  You're also free to deny them.  The choice is yours.|`|ef4edd8f1c0d16fab298d474bf08b339aa	Well, I think I nailed the destiny of atheists with this video.<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLt9EReC-1A&feature=channel_page" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLt9EReC-...</a><br>  <br>  But if you are having trouble, God is the one who is supposed to be your support.

That must suck. If you sit and do nothing -- then that will be your destiny!

Then you get up to earn the money to buy the food to eat the food....<br>  <br>  There is a meaning to all the monotony; sooner or later we all begin to know the difference. We gain wisdom, but that's another topic.<br>  <br>  You want to be with and without someone at the same time? You are still self-centered and don't want to serve someone else. It makes you afraid that you will disappear? You need to realize that you are the problem. You need to join with Jesus and let Him emerge as the center of your existence. <br>  <br>  What is the meaning of Life?  <br>  There is no meaning in life! (apart from Jesus) He re-values (re-deems) your life with the value of His own life which He gave up for us.<br>  <br>  Nothing anyone has ever done in their careers has ever mattered!<br>  This is a temporal world, and all of it is fading away.

I've been a vegetarian for almost 2 years and I crave fish sticks every once in a while or a country fried steak with some country gravy. But then I think about how these animals are killed, I mean would you want be to eaten? Just because you could? I don't think that God gave us animals to eat: I think he gave us animals for compassion. He wants us to love something other than ourselves. And people try to say that to me all the time, and I've gotten so tired of telling them that I just tell them to shut their face. Honestly, a lot of people forget i'm vegetarian at my school. I was talking about how I didnt want to go to this chilli dinner with my cousin and they said why and I said because I'm a vegetarian, and they said OH YEA I forgot!<br>  <br>  anyway, i think it's just the fact it's something your body is used to eating meat for many years, then when you go cold turkey eventually it craves it again. But you just gotta remember what those animals go through, they have families! friends, cousins, uncles, etc. they don't wanna die just like you and me|`|ExCAedp4aa	God gave us animals so we could dress them up and send funny pictures of them around on the internet. <br>  <br>  No one's tempting you, you just like the taste of meat.

That's the real reason you crave it. Try some meat analogues, they'll probably help, or try cooking with some tofu or something.<br>  <br>  Edit again: Tofurky? Boca? Morningstar Farms products? Quorn Products (their cutlets are good)? Gardenburger? There's more than Tofu to choose from.|`|Wn64Oxxyaa	It may be your body telling you something.

It could also be that you are lacking protein, as this was the case with me a few months after becoming vegetarian, so make sure you're getting enough.<br>  <br>  When you have a craving for meat, eat something else that you especially enjoy.

Usually a craving is your body telling you that you are lacking something in your diet, up your protein intake.|`|qWPCxYQYaa	That'd be your appetite sending you cravings for something you used to eat, but as of recently, eat no longer. You ever have a craving at random for a dish you haven't had in a while? It's like that, but on a larger scale. It happens when you break most habits, I suppose, especially enjoyable ones, such as eating food you like. That's one of the problems with going veg at a later age- I was fortunate enough to come to vegetarianism when I was 5, so I never really missed it, but after years of your body being used to it? Dropping it can be hard, and cravings will happen. Especially if you're missing nutrients that you used to get from meat- you may want to look at your protein, calcium, iron, and et cetera, intakes- if you're not getting enough of one, that could be a contributing factor.<br>  <br>  No God, no Devil, no supernatural anything. Just your brain. Be strong through it, and it should eventually subside.

Now a days, God is starting to run low on volunteers. It was written in the Bible that the harvest is many but the workers are few. These heavy times were already known about. It is more about the lack of people meeting other peoples needs and God taking them the rest of the way when people reach their limits.|`|504de987e436d34f338e4492d3cc1338aa	arent the children supposed to be innocent in gods eyes??? if so they got a one way ticket so you shouldnt worry about it...myself..... lifes life... there is no GOD only a knowledge that if a LOT of people have a common belief, it makes things better to accept....good luck with your acceptance of cruelty in the world.

We all have to go home, and if they go home first then it's great for them to reach to finish line first.<br>  <br>  I happen to think it's a sort of relief for those kids. I hear 30k kids die of hunger everyday. While CEO's drive the Economy off the cliff and get a golden nugget for their incompetence. Would you rather keep them on earth for a whole round of punishment, or throw the towel in for them to come back and try another time? I'm not saying kill all the kids please don't construe it that way. I'm saying I rather see suffering stopped because it's worse in my opinion. <br>  <br>  I know you said not to say it's not God's work it's mans, but the truth is that it is man. God doesn't do these reckless, stupid deeds; humankind does. With all that extra food a lot of us Americans eat- because we have an obesity pandemic- we could be feeding those kids.<br>  <br>  The greed of humans is ridiculous. The incompetence of humans is ridiculous. Then trying to scapegoat it unto God is ridiculous ( Sorry for that)<br>  <br>  What if God wants us- his children- to learn on our own? Maybe that's the reason it decides not to intervene.<br>  <br>  You look at death as the ultimate punishment, but don't look at it like that. Think of life as a 70 year- or however long you live- trek. Some people can find a shortcut, some people don't. Some people are also martyrs. But we are all making our way to a destination and our distances vary to that destination according to where we are spiritually. This is my opinion of course. I don't mean to contradict your views and I'm sorry if it insulted you.<br>  <br>  Now as far as the suffering goes, their will always be suffering. These are the ugly facts of life. The same way the lion has to kill the zebra or the cat has to kill the mouse. Do you think we should intervene on that? Sure it's sad, I hate seeing those things, but they always will happen.

Zeus took no chances with any child of Metis, so he swallowed her whole when she was pregnant. When the time came for the delivery of the child, Zeus started to have so terrible headaches that his howling began to shake the heavens.

When Zeus was in a relationship with Thetis (water nymph, Achilles mother), it was prophesized that Thetis's son would be greater than his father.  Zeus got scared and left her, so there was never any threat (Achilles was the son of a mortal general)<br>  Besides, most of the gods wouldn't want to dethrone him; Zeus saved several of the gods (Hera, Hestia, Hades, Poseidon, Demeter) from their father, Cronus, who swallowed them, and he freed many other gods/demigods from Tartarus (a big pit of nothingness).|`|ZhnxOA2Maa	Kratos new God of War

rU6nh42Eaa	Doubting God is lack of faith.  It doesn't mean that you can't question something that doesn't seem right to you.  It means that you doubt God's sovereignty, power, righteousness, wisdom, etc.  If you doubt those things, you are doubting who God is.  That puts you out of fellowship with God and that's a serious problem.<br>  <br>  About communism, I think they are referring to pure Marxism, which denies the existence of a God.  If you were a Catholic in a Communist country, you would see the conflict.  The article you attached doesn't forbid Catholics from being one, but says it endangers faith.  It also mentions Freemasonry, which I don't think is anti-Christian (contrary to some thinking).  Just be wary of being in groups that don't encourage your faith and teachings.<br>  <br>  About the full consent, only be concerned about things that you do willingly and know are wrong.  If you doubt, and know your doubts conflict with what the church teaches, and make those doubts your beliefs, that is full consent.|`|Wo1BkKTBaa	Because it will make you rebel against your slavedrivers. christianity/catholicism is a form of spiritual communism.|`|87231731cb32c6abdb725130f208078daa	If you have never heard about it then why ask about it?

That would be why a good Catholic couldn't be a good communist.|`|KmnbjZIdaa	I do not think doubting God is a mortal sin, because as you have said it usually unintentional, you are just in the dark about something about the faith and you cannot help it.  But if there is a way to clear the doubt but you refuse to make the effort, then your doubt becomes wilful and could be sinful.|`|8465ed09a7111e9ef73563fd6ed0ec22aa	2087 Our moral life has its source in faith in God who reveals his love to us. St. Paul speaks of the "obedience of faith" as our first obligation. He shows that "ignorance of God" is the principle and explanation of all moral deviations. Our duty toward God is to believe in him and to bear witness to him.<br>  <br>  2088 The first commandment requires us to nourish and protect our faith with prudence and vigilance, and to reject everything that is opposed to it. There are various ways of sinning against faith:<br>  <br>  Voluntary doubt about the faith disregards or refuses to hold as true what God has revealed and the Church proposes for belief. Involuntary doubt refers to hesitation in believing, difficulty in overcoming objections connected with the faith, or also anxiety aroused by its obscurity. If deliberately cultivated doubt can lead to spiritual blindness.<br>  <br>  2089 Incredulity is the neglect of revealed truth or the willful refusal to assent to it. "Heresy is the obstinate post-baptismal denial of some truth which must be believed with divine and catholic faith, or it is likewise an obstinate doubt concerning the same; apostasy is the total repudiation of the Christian faith; schism is the refusal of submission to the Roman Pontiff or of communion with the members of the Church subject to him."<br>  <br>  2090 When God reveals Himself and calls him, man cannot fully respond to the divine love by his own powers. He must hope that God will give him the capacity to love Him in return and to act in conformity with the commandments of charity. Hope is the confident expectation of divine blessing and the beatific vision of God; it is also the fear of offending God's love and of incurring punishment.<br>  <br>  2091 The first commandment is also concerned with sins against hope, namely, despair and presumption:<br>  <br>  By despair, man ceases to hope for his personal salvation from God, for help in attaining it or for the forgiveness of his sins. Despair is contrary to God's goodness, to his justice - for the Lord is faithful to his promises - and to his mercy.|`|nw0fqXj9aa	What does being a communist have to do with doubting god?|`|AA11466759	*looks at link*<br>  man, am I in a crapload of trouble.

And with the difference in the way American people express themselves, saying "please' might be gentle, but in Chinese, the word "please" is more of a demand, not something you want to say!<br>  <br>  2 types of mandarin you must know, the general one, and the Beijing one where there's "r" soundings in the end, depending on where they are from, you use --<br>  (Try saying baby, or honey)<br>  (*pronunciation in the bottom)<br>  Beijing -- <br>  Qing ai de (love one/lover) Bu yao sheng qi le hao ma? <br>  The reason its a question is that the Chinese people, being gentle, ends with questions. <br>  <br>  Normal Mandarin --<br>  Bao be (baby) bu yao zai sheng qi le hao ma? <br>  The normal mandarin pronounces baby as "Bao Be" while Beijing people pronounce it "Bao br" -- it is more cute. And notice in the Normal Mandarin sentence there is an extra "zai," putting emphasize on the moment - in Chinese...it sounds bit more demanding. <br>  <br>  (Normal Mandarin, mostly said by South part of China are more synchronized with Western Society so they use the word "Baby"  ("Bao Be"). As to Beijing or North part of China are less synchronized and are shy to the word "Baby" ("Bao Br") and more into "lover" ("Qing ai de") as you can see we are so into it that it has 3 words placing more emphasize. <br>  <br>  Here's how to pronounce each sentence:<br>  the 1st tone is normal (-) the 2nd is upwards (/) the 3rd is down then up (v) and the the last 4th tone is down (\).<br>  Beijing one --<br>  Qing (1st tone) ai (4th tone) de (1st or 4th) , bu (2nd tone) yao (4th tone) zai (4th tone) sheng (1st) qi (4th tone) le (very lightly pronounce, same as if you were pronouncing it in English) hao (3rd tone) ma (1st tone, very lightly pronounce, same as if you were pronouncing it in English) ending the sentence. <br>  <br>  Normal --<br>  Bao (3rd tone) be (4th), bu (2nd) yao (4th) zai (4th) sheng (1st) qi (4th) le (same as Beijing) hao (3rd) ma (same as Biejing). <br>  <br>  This is tiring to type...but hope it helps ya :-D|`|T4BUDLUbaa	xing ni bu yao shin chi <br>  please do not be upset

The group is within its rights to ignore this person and not direct the group attention to them (which is what the "outcast" is hoping for).<br>  People who feel they must mope around, and be the martyr during group functions SHOULD GO ELSEWHERE.<br>  <br>  So this is another angle to think about, but different situations require different solutions.|`|a5gWynFLaa	If you feel as if the group or you as an individual should accommodate the "left out" I would go for it.|`|0003a5b50268aea93401640c3a727d6faa	The situation as described can be interpreted several ways.<br>  <br>  The group is obviously focused on whatever is being said during this  conversation.

Or they do.<br>  <br>  Person may have new thoughts to whatever is being said in the conversation and try to relax, join in.  <br>  <br>  Perhaps there is a reason this person to feel uncomfortable and insecure.

It is very simple...<br>  <br>  Jesus came here to die for our sins... to give us back what Adam [and Eve] lost for us, life.<br>  <br>  John 3: 16 tells us about God and his Son, Jesus Christ:<br>  <br>  “For God loved the world so much that he gave his only-begotten Son, in order that everyone exercising faith in him might not be destroyed but have everlasting life".<br>  <br>  Remember when "The Seed" was spoken of in Genesis, and Isaiah?<br>  -----------------------<br>  <br>  The first of such prophecies was spoken after the rebellion in Eden. It was embodied in Jehovah’s judgment addressed to the serpent. <br>  <br>  Jehovah said: “I shall put enmity between you and the woman and between your seed and her seed. He will bruise you in the head and you will bruise him in the heel.” (Genesis 3:14, 15) <br>  <br>  As a result we know that the one to whom it was addressed, as represented by the serpent, is Satan the Devil. “The woman” is Jehovah’s own loyal heavenly organization, which is to him like a faithful wife. <br>  <br>  ‘The seed of the serpent’ includes both angels and humans who manifest the spirit of the Devil, those who oppose Jehovah and his people. In view of the way the serpent was used by the Devil in Eden, it could be discerned from the prophecy that the ‘bruising of the serpent in the head’ referred to eventual destruction of this rebel son of God who had slandered Jehovah and brought great grief to mankind. <br>  <br>  But as for the identity of the “seed” that would do the bruising, this long remained a sacred secret. (Romans 16:25, 26)<br>  <br>  After some 2,000 years of human history Jehovah provided further details. He indicated that the Seed would appear in the family line of Abraham. (Genesis 22:15-18) However, the line leading to the Seed would depend not merely on fleshly descent but on God’s choice. In spite of Abraham’s love for his son Ishmael, born to the slave girl Hagar, Jehovah pointedly said: “My covenant I shall establish with Isaac, whom Sarah will bear to you.” (Genesis 17:18-21; 21:8-12) Later that covenant was confirmed, not to Isaac’s firstborn son Esau, but to Jacob, from whom the 12 tribes of Israel descended. (Genesis 28:10-14) In time it was indicated that the Seed would be born in the tribe of Judah, in the house of David. (Genesis 49:10; 1?Chroncles 17:3, 4, 11-14)<br>  <br>  Over 700 years in advance, the Bible named Bethlehem as the place of the human birth of the Seed but also revealed that he was one who had already existed “from the days of time indefinite,” since the time when he was created in heaven. (Micah 5:2) <br>  <br>  The time of his appearance on earth as Jehovah’s Anointed One, the Messiah, was foretold through the prophet Daniel. (Daniel 9:24-26) And when he was anointed with holy spirit, a voice from heaven identified him. (Matthew 3:16, 17) So, after becoming a follower of Jesus, Philip could say with conviction: “We have found the one of whom Moses, in the Law, and the Prophets wrote, Jesus, the son [by adoption] of Joseph, from Nazareth.” (John 1:45)<br>  <br>  Thereafter, Jesus’ followers came to realize that literally scores of prophetic references to him were woven into the inspired Scriptures. Following his death and resurrection, he personally “interpreted to them things pertaining to himself in all the Scriptures.” (Luke 24:27) <br>  <br>  It is now apparent that Jesus, principally, is the ‘seed of the woman,’ the one who bruises the head of the “serpent” in such a manner that Satan is finally crushed out of existence. <br>  <br>  By means of Jesus all God’s promises to humankind, all the things for which we earnestly long, will be brought to fulfillment. (2?Corinthians 1:20)<br>  <br>  Jesus was in heaven, volunteered to do a great task for his Father, Jehovah God, and that was be the perfect ransom, the perfect sacrifice to give us back life that Adam [and Eve] lost for us -- the lost life -- Jesus came to repay it back. He was the only perfect man who remained faultless and perfect throughout his entire 33.5 years here in the earth until he was murdered, and then risen by his Father from the dead and he asended back to the heavens along side his Father and the earth and Satan, and the demons as a footstool at his feet. He, Jesus, will return a second time to enact God's war, Armageddon for this is when all wicked humans in the earth will be destroyed and Satan, and his demons will be locked away for the 1,000 year reign.|`|8IHfytEvaa	That verse is pretty simple.<br>  <br>  It says what it means and means what it says.|`|zefFTf8Aaa	yes.  the rest of the book of john.|`|NfSozW24aa	Please, please, don't listen to CJ, or anyone else who doesn't understand salvation.<br>  <br>  Salvation is a GIFT from God. It is not something that we earn. <br>  <br>  CJ and company believe that if only a person accepts Christ, or believes on Christ, then he is saved. Well, that's NOT grace. That's WORK. Faith is a WORK (I Thessalonians 1:3; II Thessalonians 1:11). <br>  <br>  A person in that situation is earning their salvation. Period. End of story. That is NOT the salvation plan of the Bible.<br>  <br>  To believe on Christ means that we give God 100% of the credit for our salvation. Not 99.99999%, but the full 100% of the credit. That means we have to come to the realization that our faith had nothing to do with getting ourself saved. After all, if our faith got us saved, then God is not 100% responsible for our salvation. We had a part in it. And that is not possible.<br>  <br>  Galatians 5:4 warns that if we try to get saved by keeping the law, then we're not saved. Believing on Christ is a COMMAND (I John 3:23). This is the trap that the ancient Israelites fell into; they tried to become saved by keeping the law, and they perished because of unbelief.<br>  <br>  We have to wait on God for salvation. If God truly saves someone, they will realize that they had nothing to do with their becoming saved. God did 100% of the saving. Galatians 2:16 teaches that it's Christ's faith, not our faith, which is what the faith of salvation is.<br>  <br>  You have to read John 3:16 in the light of the entire Bible.

It is impossible to lose or "leave" salvation. <br>  <br>  The truth about Jesus is that the only way to be saved and to get into heaven and avoid being sent to eternal hell, is by believing in faith alone that Jesus, who is God, died for our sins on the cross as FULL PAYMENT for all our sins, and then Jesus rose from the dead (1 Corinthians 15:1-4). Believe this and you will be in heaven, no matter what! <br>  <br>  Please pray now: "Jesus, please forgive me of my sins. I believe that You died on the cross for my sins and You rose from the dead. Thank You for eternal life!" You will be in heaven with Him forever when you die. :)

We had "Bond<br>  drives" where celebrities traveled the country putting on shows<br>  to sell defense bonds.  The whole nation changed to  manufacturing<br>  planes and ships and munitions.  Consumer goods, like autos<br>  were discontinued for several years.  The "war effort" was all<br>  consuming.

I could understand if she had only one or no friends that she might feel scared and needy, but in this case I think she just really wants to be your friend and values you as a person. You obviously seem like a good catch to her (in a friend way) because even though she is so terribly shy she opened up to you and felt comfortable with you. That would mean a lot to her, as she probably doesn't feel very comfortable with alot of people. <br>  <br>  I would love to have a friend like her, personally.

256t9bIqaa	Unfortunately, it's worse than that.    They think the very words of Paul are God's, even when Paul says they aren't.    Paul is God's "mouthpiece" most of the time, but not always--and Paul will be the first to say "I say, not the Lord . . . ."     But many Christians do not make a distinction between the words of Paul and the words of God.<br>  <br>  "The Bible is the Word of God" is not Biblical.    No one will ever find these words in the Bible.    Many Christians believe the Bible is the Word of God, but they are actually believing a tradition taught by men.<br>   <br>  The Bible gives the definition of the Word of God.  In Jn 1, the Bible defines the Word of God as Jesus himself.    A Living Being;  not a publication.<br>  <br>  There are about 4 definitions of "word" in the Bible.

4db07412ef2c09f8393cb86bf7e153deaa	I realize you're only half-kidding here, but to answer anyway:<br>  <br>  No, sports fandom is not a religion.  Granted, it IS a practice that has its own share of symbolism (team logos, the wave, etc.) and ritual (such as tuning in to see a game on TV, wearing shirts of your favorite team), and it can be a touchy subject because it's something personal (you don't want to walk through south Boston wearing a Yankee's cap).  But that's where the similarities end.  You can "idolize" certain athletes, but that's not really the same as viewing them as actual supernatural deities.<br>  <br>  Some of the other necessary components to a religion are dogma and some type of offered answers to big philosophical questions like "Why are we all here?", "What is the meaning of life?", "Why do people behave the way they do?", "What should I be doing with my life?", etc.  Or if not offered answers, at least a suggested method for finding those out.  This philosophy component is a necessary part of religion and something that distinguishes religion from hobbies, sciences (science answers "how", not "why"), or sexual orientations.<br>  <br>  Personally I do think that it's people's overall need for ritual and symbolism that largely drives them to take up a religion, or be a sports fan, or join a music subculture clique, or be a Trekkie, etc.  I myself love ritual and symbolism.  Eventually though, I found out that this is what truly drove me to religion in the first place, and now I realize that there are other ways of getting my ritualistic fix without swallowing all the dogma.|`|dz5Og81Qaa	Being gay is not a religion.

All of the writers and translators of the Bible have "picked and chosen" which parts they wanted to include, Jefferson was a bit more honest about it.|`|KhJwOurLaa	In short, You find the true teachings of Jesus.|`|oil8ALh4aa	isn't that what all cristains do? <br>  I kinda like the Jeffersons version more though.|`|256t9bIqaa	The authors and translators of the Bible do not pick and choose which parts to include.    What you read in the Bible is pretty much the same as it was 2000 years ago.   If you pick and choose, others will instantly convict you of intellectual perjury because there are literally thousands of papyrus and parchment fragments dating back to the time of Christ and before which still survive to this day.   One only has to read the fragments and compare.<br>  <br>  Jefferson picked and chose.   Jefferson did not believe in the Christian God.   While he liked what Jesus had to say, he didn't believe that Jesus was God himself.    And so by committing intellectual perjury, Jefferson kept the morality writings of Jesus but tossed out everything that Jesus said or did which would confirm Jesus's divine nature.<br>  <br>  If you likened the Bible to a Haynes Car manual, Jefferson kept the pages about wheels, seats and mirrors, but since he didn't believe in internal combustion, he threw out the pages that dealt with pistons, fuel injectors and spark plugs.<br>  <br>  Just because one is the Founding Father of a Nation, and invokes "Nature's God" in the Declaration of Independence to justify rebellion, Jefferson does not absolve himself from intellectually lying to himself.     One cannot take a book, remove the parts he doesn't like, and remain honest to the intent of the authors.|`|8IHfytEvaa	I just found a copy at my local library's online site.<br>  <br>  I have put a hold on it and asked that it be xfered from the downtown library to the branch near me.<br>  <br>  Once I get it I'll read it then let you know.<br>  <br>  I should be able to have it read within about 2 weeks.|`|6b6e3713e16d46170778753cecddd560aa	I like Jefferson's Bible.

The fact that there are dozens of "Versions" of the bible is one of the MANY reasons that I think it is all nonsense... <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.nobeliefs.com/DarkBible/darkbible2.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.nobeliefs.com/DarkBible/darkb...</a><br>  The salvation doctrines of Christianity survived and flourished because they afforded the priesthood considerable power. The priests alone held the keys to salvation and could threaten the unbelievers with eternal punishment. Hence, in the evolution of Christianity in the last two thousand years with priests preying on human fears, the religion has demonstrated extraordinary powers of survival. Even without the priests, the various versions of the Bible have had more influence on the history of the world, in the minds of men than any other literature.<br>  <br>  Unfortunately, the beliefs in Scripture produced the most violent actions against man in the history of humanity up to that time. The burning of competing Christian cults (called heretics) by early Christian churches acted as the seeds of violent atrocities against man. There later followed the destruction of Rome by the Christian Goths, and the secret pagan sacrifices consented by the Pope, the Vandals that had the Bible with them as they destroyed imperial North Africa, the crusades in the eleventh century fighting in the lands around the eastern Mediterranean, Palestine and Syria, capturing Jerusalem and setting kingdoms from Anatolia to the Egyptian border. In 1204 the Fourth Crusade plundered Constantinople the most holy city at that time, with Christians fighting Christians. And the slaughters continued (and continues to this day). According to Romer, "More heretics and scholars were burned in the Middle Ages than were ever killed in Carolingian times. For at this time the Inquisition came into its own, and torture, largely unused as an instrument of government since Roman days, was reintroduced."<br>  <br>  In the 1380s, John Wycliffe translated the first English Bible which inspired an English religious revolution which caused persecutions against him by the Catholic Church.<br>  <br>  In the early 1500's the German heretic, Martin Luther, almost single handedly caused the final split from the Roman Catholic church and created the beginnings of the Protestant revolution. This split still influences violence to this day. He translated the Bible into German which further spread Protestantism. Luther also helped spread anti-Semitism with his preaching and books such as his "The Jews and their lies," all supported through his interpretation of the Bible. One should not forget that Hitler (a Christian and great admirer of Luther) and his holocaust could not have occurred without his influence and the support of Bible believing German Christians.<br>  <br>  In the 1530s William Tyndale completed his version of the English Protestant Bible (probably with the aid of Luther) and the first to print the English Bible. He too felt the persecution of the Church and he spent his last days in imprisonment and exile. His enemies finally caught him and burned him at the stake, but because of his celebrity, they strangled him first (what nice guys!).<br>  <br>  After Luther's German Bible, others followed suit by translating the Bible into their native languages including Dutch and French. Not until 1611 C.E. did a committee of translators and interpreters complete the most popular Bible of all time, the King James Version.<br>  <br>  Today we still have dozens of Bible translation versions, with Bible scholars still arguing over the meaning and proper translations of words and phrases. The following shows just a few of the most popular versions:<br>  <br>  King James Version (KJV) <br>  The New King James Version (NKJV) <br>  Modern King James Version [Green's Translation] (MKJV) <br>  Literal Translation Version [Green] (LITV) <br>  International Standard Version (ISV) <br>  The New International Version (NIV) <br>  English Standard Version (ESV) <br>  New English Bible (NEB) <br>  American Standard Version (ASV) <br>  New American Standard Bible (NASB) <br>  Revised Standard Version (RSV) <br>  New Revised Standard Version (NRSV)  Contemporary English Version (CEV) <br>  Today's English Version (TEV) <br>  The Living Bible (LB) <br>  New Century Version (NC)<br>  New Life Version (NLV) <br>  New Living Translation (NLT) <br>  Young's Literal Translation (YLT) <br>  Revised Young's Literal Translation (RYLT) <br>  John Darby's New Translation <br>  Weymouth New Testament Translation <br>  Rotherham's  <br>  <br>  (One might wonder what will happen to the "new" revisions a few hundred years from now. Nevertheless, the King James Version still remains the most used Bible in the world today and it will probably continue its popularity long into the future.)<br>  <br>  No doubt that future versions of Bibles will surface in the future: revisions of previously revised Bibles and newer revisions of new versions. The history of the many versions of the Bible stories, from the ancient Mesopotamian myths to the varied interpretations, interpolations, and versions of the Bible speaks volumes about the reliability of their interpretations and the alleged "truth" they claim the Bible holds, because it shows that the Bible comes not from supernatural agents but rather from human imagination. We have not one shred of evidence for the supernatural influence on human written works (and mostly from unknown authors), but we do have an abundance of evidence for human recorded beliefs and myths. This shows a marked difference between those of scientific works and those deriving from religious minds. For example, Euclid's Elements written around 300 B.C.E. has changed little since its inception. Scientists don't argue and debate about its meaning because they know it doesn't represent an absolute or fixed work. It only provides a step in the understanding of geometry. Most Christian apologists, on the other hand, view the Bible as fixed and absolute, if only they could only just get the interpretation correct. But regardless of how much they want the Bible to reflect their particular beliefs, they can never dislodge the violence and atrocities described and condoned by their God in the stories in the Old Testament. Nor can they dismiss the even more horrific result of the horrors of Hell as amplified by the words of the alleged Jesus in the New Testament where almost everyone on earth dies in eternal fire. In short, Bible belief influences horror, not by the majority but by the few that actually believe in its macabre prophecy and have the power to force their beliefs onto the majority. <br>  <br>  We have little reason to think that violence inspired by Bibles and other religious texts will ever cease. One only has to look at the religious wars around the world to see belief's everlasting destructive potential. One only has to look at the Protestant-Catholic uprising in Ireland, the conflicts in the middle east with Jews fighting Moslems & Christians, the Gulf war, Sudan's civil war between Christians and Islamics, the Bosnia conflicts, and the war in Iraq. The desperate acts of fanatical individuals who have killed for their beliefs of Jesus, Mohammed, God or Satan would create a death list unmatched by any other method in history. The "Holy" Bible supports the notion of war and destruction, not only as a prophesy but as a moral necessity. If we wish to become a peaceful species, it may well serve us to understand the forces of belief that keep us in continual conflict and why the Bible has such a stronghold on the minds of people around the world.

PwHQSAxvaa	Equality? Don't make me laugh. Men and women are not equal in Britain, where fewer than 1% of men involved in child custody cases actually win. How is this equality? 80% of men in the UK who report being assaulted by a female end up being the one getting arrested, despite being the victim. Again, is this equal?<br>  <br>  Yesterday's feminists were true feminists, trying to get women the vote and treated equally. Today's feminists are more correctly described as misandrists.|`|MyX42szoaa	Because feminists are just a bunch of complaining women who blame all their misfortunes on men.|`|Ps9eOIchaa	They are about equality,but they go to extremes and anything and everything you say to them,they connect it to you somehow being sexist and God forbid you even use the two words "Women Can't..." cause you will hear it.I mean i'm all for equality but i make my own decisions and won't let feminists and their woman power bother me|`|LIJ8qnOVaa	People(especially men) tend to feel we are insane. But like you stated we are all for equality. We live in a mans world as you and I know it. Men are paid more then women; women are degraded for many things men are applauded for. Many men are bias and feel they are better at everything than women(sports, politics. Etc.).  They feel as though woman aren't capable to succeed high in the world. So they put them down, sadly enough my brothers think this way. Were making progress but not enough. Anyways that's just some things wrong with this world. Hopefully one day I will see a woman as my commander and Chief, then maybe will I quit being the women rights activist I am. :D|`|pfke6Jieaa	oh please have u ever seen how the feminists act? they act as if women are god's gift to the world. i understand wanting more rights but going over board with it and acting like u r all that is just rubbing it in. if u can do that with class go ahead but if ur gonna be abnoxious dont expect ppl to respect ur beliefs.|`|czBW1Volaa	They want to take men's roles.

It is really ridic, but honestly people are dumbasses and live by stereotypes.Then I hate when I explain to these few ignoramouses that I am gay they say "oh i should've guessed"....so naive.|`|TyRfv0eoaa	Not everyone believes that.

Its applys as much as the typical white mans. The black community are pretty religious right? So men have to be like the 'man' and not enjoy the more feminin things in life. They may be seen as gay and be told they are going to hell. Personaly I think religion does nothing but make trouble but thats another thread...|`|8PA58u3kaa	Haha, as a fellow gay black man with very similar interests, and a creepily ironic similar father I can totally get where you're coming from.

But Es mejor que can=it is best.<br>  <br>  Edit: Cierto can have many meanings depending on the context.For ex: Es cierto= it's true, estoy cierto= I am certain/sure, Por cierto=by the way  etc... In this sentence cierto means ''certain duties''. It is best to make certain that duties with the community, doesn't make sense in the sentence...Anyways I think the sentence means like things you'd do in the community to help out like charity etc... So you just have to agree or disagree with being responsible for the community you live in.

o8jiJ0pGaa	goth is darker (in appearance and subculture) than emo, emo is darker than scene. goths are usualy the ones wearing long black clothes, emo kids are probably the ones wearing the skinny jeans, converse, black t-shirts with bands names on them, wearing tons of arm bands. scene kids are the ones with bigger hair than the other two, wear skinny jeans like emo kids, but are more colorful and definately more annoying than the other two. <br>  <br>  goths dont bother me, and emos are kinda snooty but mind their own business; but scene kids are like a prep mixed with an emo kid, to an extreme.
