Now this doesn't happen all the time, and when it doesn't I'm so happy about...everything, but when the voice comes in, I simply can't focus on anything I'm doing and avoid talking to other people, as if I'm too busy arguing with myself in my head. Why do I go through this when I KNOW I love these women? Am I'm going crazy or what?      P.S. No. I'm not a fetish freak.

Anyway, I go back to see the orthopedic surgeon on Tuesday, but I'm getting restless.  At the ER they only put a splint/wrap on my foot all the way up to almost my knee.      I can already walk on it lightly with little pain, and well I was wondering what I can do.   I am interested in biking, but was wondering if that would put too much stress on it.      The other thing I was curious about is what kind of foods/ supplements help promote bone growth?  (I went to GNC and got Calcium Citrate/Vitamin D pills)      Any help with this would be appreciated.  Thanks.

I'm just worried about what other people will think as they're passing by. When you see people jogging outside do you think they look stupid?

20090225152934AAIIE7d	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Infectious Diseases	Very sick, please help me.?	Ok, so yesterday morning I got up and had a really bad sore throat. I couldn't take it anymore so I went home sick.       And around 6:30 last night I went to sleep and didn't wake up untill now. Which...I've never slept this long. Ever. And right now I could fall asleep just like that.      I feel like my lymph nodes are very swollen. And my throat is very red, swollen, and it feels like almost my airway is getting smaller, and it makes me nervous even though I havn't had trouble breathing,      I have intervals of violent chills, and when I'm so hot I start to sweat in places I didn't know could sweat.      I went to the doctor yesterday, and they gave me an antibiotic for strep//sinus infection. But I'm starting to think it's more than that.      My parents are getting worried so I'm going back to the doctor tomorrow. I think I might have mono.      I've drinken very little (roughly 3 glasses of water, and 2 cups of hot cider) And I ate the smallest peice of pizza I could to get my antibiotic down. My stomach is growling but I have no desire to eat. Right now my mom is making me some soup....but I don't want to eat it because everything hurts so bad.      It makes me want to just cry...because I can't remember ever being this sick.      Oh btw, I am 15 years old and a girl. If you have any other questions just type them, and I'll type the answer.
20090225153244AAge40m	Health;Mental Health	What is going on with me?	Ok please only answer serious.  (Not trying to brag, i just need to tell you this stuff) I have pretty near everything I need in life, I come from a good background, I am a strong, good looking kid, my family loves me and treats me well and everything, and Ive had my 2 bestfriends since I was 2.  For like the past 4 months I have just been pissed off about everything, and very seldom am I happy.  It makes me more sad to know that there are people such as africans out there who have everything so much worse than me, but are still happier.  I don't enjoy doing things anymore and lack motivation.  The only things that make me happy are hanging out with my friends, and working out.  How can I stop this i'm really nervous to talk to my parents/doctor because I feel like a jerk saying how i'm so depressed when there are people out there who have life so much harder than I do.

Took my Kitty in for his yearly check up and he had been having loose stools. Dr. started with bladder test first as his urine pattern had changed in the litter box (more in the middle than on the side, more like a saucer shape, may have no bearing?)

Nothing I can do until then, just wondering what you all know about it. Looked on Internet...all I find is fat liver disease, can be treated, can be fatal. How bad is this? Do I drive my self nuts?

I'm 18 and have suffered with minor acne (however minor, still consistently present, unsightly, and annoying) since I was about 12. Usually, it will clear up for about a week, and then my face will slowly start to become more and more of a problem. Recently, I have a new issue-- dry skin. I wash my face with a mild cleanser and apply moisturizer twice a day, but my face still has dry patches. I know that the winter months can be especially harsh for skin, but I live in a southern, very humid area, so it's not exactly that much of a problem. Is there anything that would help both problems?      I use a very mild face cleanser and have even tried switching to alleviate this; the problem, however, persists. The lotion and face wash I use are fragrance-less, so I still don't know what to do. I do already drink plenty of water, and I don't eat meat, so the beef and pork issue is not of concern.

The next day I was still swollen and red in my face. Now I am on a 9day 25mg Steriod pill treatment. It seems to slowly get better. But only slow in process. Nobody can figure out where this allergy came from. I did eat a strawberry yogurt and I am allergic to strawberries, but I also used a new cleanser from Noxzema Microbead with Vitam C. Anybody ever had a simular experience? I am afraid it can happen again, that was severe. And I am still recuping from it. My face still is a bit swollen and red.    Thanx for any help!!

I have a very foul odor like an onionish smell and very thick white discharge that looks like the cottage cheese for a yeast infection, but then on the very tops of my vagina lips I get this tiny little cut from the top straight down to almost the top of my clitoris that hurts and wont go away and I notice it only semi starts to go away when I shave the hair off of that area.  I do clean down there very well! I have Vagisil to keep the ithcing under control. have wipes for that time of month and anytime I feel it needs to be cleaned down there from sweating or anything else. I am a little overweight and am trying to loose weight because I think part of it, is my big thighs always making it a bit sweaty down there. I just read that some tips of sugars may be part of why the yeast gets out of control. But I dont drink soda or eat that many sweets as I am trying to loose weight. I mainly drink water and some organic juices. what can I do to make it go away and help get relief!?! dont say over the counter medicines because I have done the yeast infection things, last about a week of relief then back and I also to AZO Yeast pills that I stopped for a little bit that seemed to help but never cure. any suggestions? thanks!

I have never actually thrown up or anything, but it is kind of weird if I eat out with friends and stuff. I usually just cover it up by coughing or something but then they say "Oh, do you have a cold?" errrr... yes, I have a cold every time I go out to eat with you!      I am not bulimic or anorexic, I promise. I am 5'4 and 120 pounds, in my mid-twenties.      Is this an eating disorder? What can I do to make this not happen?

20081114225917AAK01hF	Health;Dental	Every time I brush my teeth, I inevitably feel like throwing up. Why?	This started ever since I was around ten years old. Whenever I brush my teeth, especially during morning, I would almost always start gagging, in a way, and then feel like I want to throw up. If I don't stop brushing and basically drink water, I WILL start throwing up.    Fortunately, if it happens in the morning, only stomach acids and water would come out -- no substances.     I'm 20 years old now, and this is still happening. I can't ever brush for a period that is longer than 45 seconds, basically, without throwing up, at least during the morning.     Also, for reference, I have done the following in an attempt to counteract this ...sickness, or something, of the sort...:  - Breathe through my nose instead of my mouth  - Try to feel more "relaxed", by thinking "nice" thoughts  - Made sure that there are no unpleasant odors hanging around the bathroom  - I've tried brushing in the shower, and out, and that didn't really change anything  -I've tried brushing more slowly, but that seems to make it worse...    What's worse is that I CAN'T CLEAN MY TONGUE =( If I use a tongue scraper, or even my toothbrush, I will INSTANTLY throw up, even if I don't even go halfway into my tongue! Basically this means my breath smells horrible, and I have to constantly mask it with breath fresheners...     Is there anyone who have any experience with a similar situation who can possibly give me some tips to at the very least diminish certain aspects of this problem that I'm having? Thanks!

Okay, so since it is almost 2009, my new years resoultion is that I want to loose weight.      Age: 16...   I weigh 170lbs.   I want to weigh 120lbs.      I am 5'1"   This is how I look now.       http://i34.tinypic.com/igw3u0.jpg       But I want to be skinny(er).   I am not a fan of candy, I never eat it.   I am addicted to fruit. So that is basically what I live on.   I don't drink pop, I drink water as my liquid.   So what can I do to loose weight?   I really want to :/   Then maybe people won't treat me so weird.   Or they will want to talk to me.   I don't know but that was what I was told   I was to big.   I even asked my doctor what I could do.   She said I was doing everything.   She isn't into pills, surgery, or things like that.   Neither am I.   But I tried every diet I could.   Nothing seems to work?

20081101090911AAInQta	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Other - Diseases	My doctor says I probably have carpal tunnel, but I don't think so! What do you think?	Since becoming pregnant (4mo.), I brought up to my OB that I've been getting more join pains. I don't get the pain after or while using the cell phone or typing, I get it randomly in almost all the joints of my body now ( fingers, wrists, elbow, hip, knees, ankles and toes). The pain is quite sharp and only lasts from a half a second to a second. Then it just disappears. And the frequency went from every few months to about once a week, maybe, since becoming pregnant. I've had this since I was like 12 years old. Every doctor has said it's nothing, since is was distant between "events," or they've said to wait until it's become more frequent! What? Anyways, now that it's more frequent, I'm pregnant, and no testing can be done. What should I look into? I've been told by my OB that it's carpal tunnel, strangers have said it's gurd, I say it's a form of arthritis (runs in my family).    Any ideas? Or tips on how to explain this pain so that it's properly treated after the birth. What should I ask for?      TIA!

20070905112606AAbudzb	Health;Mental Health	Schizophrenia?	My mother in law is a schizophrenic that wont get a job because God is going to provide her with a husband that will take care of her. The guy she has chosen runs a homeless shelter and he wont put a restraining order against her because he feels he can help her. Yet she got rid of everything she owned to live in this shelter to be with him and then was later kicked out and banned. So now she bounces around with her sons. She is a harm to herself this way because she wont do anything for herself. She has sat on a curb in the rough areas of houston waiting for him to pick her up when he obviously isn't coming. He is married too.    The mental ward has released her three times and wont give her medication because she can still hold some sort of conversation with us.  But my husband has been her caretaker since he was 15. I'm pregnant and she was encouraging me to fight her last time she was here. Has anyone else been thru anything similar that might have any ideas on how we can get help?

I have a 42 inch waist apparently (I didn't know, I wear size 36 jeans) and have a 15.5 inch neck. I'm cutting weight, that's easy, but what should I do when I have wide hips and a thin neck? How can I beef my neck up QUICK besides doing strength training like standing rows, millitary press, shoulder shrugs and running with a football or motorcycle helmet on? (I'm doing those already) I want to get in as fast as I can and I need some help. Thanks.  Post Script:  every bodyfat calculator I use that factors age, height, weight show that even at 195 I would be slightly overweight. I'm 6'3" and pretty strong and not very fat. This is so confusing.

What I noticed though is that I need to increased my food intake even more cause ever since I started, I been eating about the same amount and my weight increase seems to be slowing down recently.                      What kind of snacks do you guys eat during your bulking phase? Im 5’8, went from 128-148 lbs, im not that big yet for my height but I feel like Im eating too much already. I think it’s partly cause of my metabolism, I’ve always been the skinny guy till recently I had the motivation to change it (now 20yrs old). It’s a little tougher for someone like me to get big, I really need to eat a lot more due to my fast metabolism, I’m willing to spend more money on food cause I think I’ll have too but if you have any ideas for a cheap snack I’d appreciate it =] I was against spending money at first but now that I think about it, doing this whole thing has really made me feel better about myself so I want to keep going, I’ll just spend more money on food, less on going out. So I wanna ask the bigger guys out there, what do you guys eat?

That is, it changes based on time of day I weigh my self, when I ate last etc. the  normal stuff   I have these last few pounds of belly fat, lower stomach, and spreading to my waist a bit. I fence, 3 times a week 1 1/2 to 2 hours at a time, walk/jog 2-3 times a week, and have been trying to watch what I eat.   Being honest with myself, I love chocolate and ramen, but I don't eat them everyday, and I try to not eat them often. In fact I eat ramen 2 times a month and chocolate 1-2 a week. small portions, I'm being realistic. I DO NOT do crunches REGULARLY but I do them a couple times a week when I remember.   I just can't seem to get rid of this fat. And it is rather stubborn I must say.   I can't go on pills (more like I refuse, I feel I'm too young and I don't have to lose THAT MUCH weight) and I don't like energy drinks or anything like that. None of that 'Eat salad for a month' quick fix stuff because that doesn't last.   Oh and I wear a back brace, if that has anything to do with it (you never know).   I appreciate your comments :)   -Angy

20090128174929AAn4kQp	Health;Mental Health	What should I do? I'm feeling really depressed.?	I'm a 14 year old girl in my sophomore year of high school. During my three years of middle school I was sad 95% of the time. That sadness went away at the start of my freshman year but lately I've been feeling the same sadness that I thought I had gotten over. I went to two physchologists during that sad time, but the visits were infrequent and I also didn't share with them a lot of how I was feeling because I didn't trust them. I don't want to make the same mistake that I did by allowing myself to live in consuming sadness without trying to get better, although I'm afraid to talk to my parents about it. Also, I don't know at what point to talk about it, since I don't want to raise a red flag and worry them if it's only a temporary thing. I have been feeling this way for about three weeks.       I feel a great sense of displeasure with myself, like I'm a failure who won't achieve anything in my life. I feel inadequate to my peers, and I am insanely jealous of my friends to the point where it's putting stress on our relationships.

20090128172733AAo4VG6	Health;Diet & Fitness	How should I go about losing weight?  ?	Hi everyone, I'm 21 years old, 5'2", and 130 lbs.  My BMI is on the high end of the desirable range, but I myself do not feel desirable at all.  The unfortunate thing about short, curvy women like me... is that we end up looking fat even if we are not technically overweight.     I have problems with running and jogging, even on a treadmill... I have awful shin splints, and they flare up really quickly.  I can't even make it for 2 minutes at a steady jog.        I know that cardio is the best way to lose weight quickly.  I've thought about swimming, but I really am not sure that I want to be in chlorine everyday.  It dries my skin and hair out quickly.        Does anyone have a diet/exercise plan that really works for them?        What should I do to exercise, and what weekly menu should I complement my regimen with?        Thanks so much for your help.  I will reward best answer to the person who can help me out best!
20090128163815AAXeO4x	Health;Women's Health	Extremely Irregular Period..too much?! ?	Ok. Background to answer this question. I am 15 years old. I got my first period when I was 13 but it was super light and only for a few days.    From then on it was really irregular, I am talking like every 3-4 months for 4-5 days, mostly 4 days. Then about 3 months ago it seemed like it was beginning to get regular. However now it seems like I have it all the time.    For example: I know that I had it from Dec. 13-18 then it stopped and then I got it again around Dec. 25-30. Then it stopped and I got it again around January 17-26 (which is a really long time) and it stopped and then I just went to the bathroom after going to the gym and now realize that I have it again, like not just spotting but full blown period.    I have no idea what is going on. I told my mom and she told me to keep a calendar and I have been. She isn't here right now so I really want some answers and was wondering if anyone knows what is going on here?   Oh and idk if you need this but I am not sexually active at all.   and sometimes I get this weird like completely clear kinda thick discharge.. idk if they go together or if they are two opposites??         Thank you so much and I really appreciate any answers.

I noticed 2 days ago that i have around 30 "pimples" around my vagina, anal hole and on the vagina flaps. They have whiteheads, most are single but some are clumped together, they are really sore i can barely even walk or sit down. I tried to pop one to see what they were. Clear "puss" came out but the whitehead still stayed there. I would go to the doctor right now but ive just gotten my period a few days ago and its embarrasing enough just going to the doctor without having your period. I do have unprotected sex with my boyfriend [he is 17 and i am 16] and the weekend before these "pimples" showed up we had sex 7-8 times in 2 days and i never showered once between them, could that possibly have something to do with it??

20090128160709AAvI40e	Health;Women's Health	More period problems?	Alright, I know there are a billion questions on here relating to periods, but I thought I would get a little advice on my own.     I've always been 28-31 days, and the period lasts 7-10 days. Always. Well, this month, I am 7 days late.    The last time I had sex was about three months ago (and, yes, we used protection). I have had two normal periods since then and I just took a pregnancy test that was negative. I know it's possible to have periods while pregnant as well as have a negative positive, but, I honestly don't think I'm pregnant.    I'm just a little concerned that my cycle is off. I know everyone's cycle is different but mine has just always been on schedule. Any advise as to why this might be? I'm going to wait another week before  Igo to the doctor, I am just very curious.    Oh, and there hasn't been anything life changing or altering.

It's just that I've always been chubby but when I was a freshman I got skinny for once in my life. Then that summer my grandma passed away and since I've done nothing but gain. I still talked to a lot of guys even last year, when I was my biggest. And now my friends tell me I look a lot better this year but I don't talk to any guys like that! Like I have tons of guy friends just not like that. Sometimes I stay home because I don't want to go out with my friends I feel like I'm the duff. (designated, ugly, fat friend).

20090225153603AAB5mTI	Health;Mental Health	My Drug Addicted Boyfriend Is Ignoring Me...What Can I Do?	My boyfriend is mad at me for a little issue, he doesn't want to talk about it (very unsual of him - he usually likes to talk things out with me, and wants to communicate). He has been ignoring my calls for a few days now. Usually whenever he ignores me it's no more than a few hours to 2 days. I think he might be high --- If he is, he is prolly taking cocaine. Whenever he gets depressed he usually resorts to drugs. He was really upset even before our arguement.      He was acting very strange online a few days ago, not really himself, however, he did say he would call me later and talk to me "someday" He also kept saying "nevah" to anything I was saying (even if it didn't make sense) and I asked him if he was high. He only said "o_o no....i'm a robot." Last time he was on drugs, he didn't tell me about it because he knows I would try and stop him because if I did stop him he would've went through withdrawal & he didn't want me to worry about him. All the other times before that, he came to me, and I talked him out of it. Do you think he was high...or do you think he was just messing with me since he's mad at me?      But I can't tell if he's on drugs or not, because he ignores my calls. Yesterday, he ignored me online. I'm really scared he didn't answer because he was so high that he couldn't type. Should I go visit his house tomorrow or Friday (when his parents might be out)?      *by the way, he does NOT have a house phone and i can't text him & his dad doesn't like girls coming over the house, which might piss off my boyfriend, for making his dad angry.

The reason I'm asking this is because I've been cutting myself for years, because I just feel gross and I don't like myself. And after talking to my therapist a couple days ago, we went into my past and I told her about how my brother-in-law would do playful things with me like put me in his lap, pull my shirt up and touch my belly, things like that. And once he actually stuck his hand down my pants. I didn't think anything of it because I was like 8. Can this have something to do with the cutting even if I didn't consciously realize it before?

Since I’m a girl, I had previously tried to do the P90X Lean version because I was afraid I’d get too bulky. But I got discouraged and stopped because I’m impatient and wasn’t seeing much change even though others did. Anyways I’m in my second week now and so far I’m doing well sticking with all the workouts. I just wanted to know if anyone (girl/guy) has tried doing the doubles. When did you start seeing the results? Also did you also have a hard time following the nutrition plan? That is probably why the P90X version didn’t work for me because I had a hard time following the nutrition plan. One more question I have is if anyone tried doing P90X without following the nutrition plan, were you also able to see results? Thank you in advance.

After the surgery they told my mom that they removed a mass from my right ovary and sent a biopsy... I haven't seen the surgeon yet for my follow up due to weather and everything the only time I saw them was when they removed my stitches... Now here is my prob... I started getting pain in the LEFT ovary, went to the hospital they did not find anything on the left but they found a large mass on the RIGHT, has anyone experienced severe pain on the left only to find that the problem was on the right? Aside from that does anyone know what they mean by mass... I am so angry I think they should have removed it during surgery but obviously they did not. Do you think it is possible that they only removed part of the mass and that is what they told my mom about? I am so confused any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks

I don't really know why but it doesn't bother me. I just feel lost. I just don't understand. Because as much as i wished i care i just don't. Could someone please help me understand what is going on with me cuz i need some help.

20090128203258AAH9u2m	Health;General Health Care;Other - General Health Care	Blood pressure question?	My blood pressure is always all over the place.  I just took it and it was 111/90 with a pulse of 118.  I've just been sitting around, watching tv.  My pulse is almost always high so while I'm curious about why, I'm used to it (it's ran high my whole life).   Last week it was 167/110 with a pulse of 120.  Again, I hadn't been doing anything stressful.   I use ReliOn and on it has colored indicators to the side- Green for normal, Yellow for pre-hypertension, and the stages of Red for High Blood Pressure.   111/90 shows up as the bottom-most line of red (not so high), while the last showed up as the highest line of red.      Why is 111/90 considered high?  What makes the lower number higher or lower and is it just as bad if the lower number is high?   As an aside question, can the lower number ever be higher than the first?  Can the two meet?  Just curious about that part...      I don't usually take medicine for my blood pressure.  I've never seen anyone about it.  I take propanalol if I get the shakes (anxiety related) or if I feel pressure in my ears (blood pressure related).   Is this something I should be more worried about?      I'm 34 years old, 5'5" and about 130 pounds.  I'm currently smoking about 2 packs of cigarettes a day.  Last April 28 I hadn't had a smoke for 8 years and since I picked the habit back up I've quit for as long as a month but also for a week or two several times.   I'm trying to quit again (for good).  But it seems to have had little effect on my blood pressure.  It's been up and down and all over the place for years.  There's a history of high blood pressure in my family.      Thanks for any answers or insights.

20090128183417AAXwxKo	Health;Diet & Fitness	Is eating 4 eggs a day unhealthy?	I'm almost 16.  I'm a boy.  And I've been eating about 4 or 5 eggs everyday not because I force myself, but just because its in all my food I get made.  AND I actually love eggs, they taste so good.  And its always the whole egg, the yolk never gets taken out.      I've been eating 4 or 5 eggs everyday since like a young kid.  Scrambled eggs, boiled eggs, fried, and all kinds.  i just love how it tastes.      But I want to know if its unhealthy for me?    I'm not fat, lets just start with that, so its probably not causing any fat problems.  I'm about 120 pounds and I'm 5'7" tall.        I eat lots of fruits and veggies too.  And I exercise everyday at least 30 mins.  plus 20 each to I walk to and from school.  I'm the good child says my mom, lol, cuz I eat almost anythng she makes, all the veggies all fruits.  I'm not a picky eater.      So basically, I just want to know if this is or will be bad/unhealthy for me?      Oh and also, I think its because that I'm eating so many eggs, thats why I had early puberty.  I'm a guy, and I had puberty in grade 6.  That was my gorwth spurt too.  I bursted taller than everyone then.        thank you.      P.S-  even if you guys tell me its bad, I'll still eat at least 1 or 2 eggs each day because I just love them, they taste good, LOL.
20090128183635AAvuJz0	Health;Other - Health	How much taller will a 16 year old boy grow?	I'm almost 16 and I'm only about 5'7". I started to grow really fast when I was in grade 6. Thats usually early for boys. I think the reason I started puberty that early is because I eat LOTS of eggs everyday. I ate around 5 eggs a day. And I still do.      I think it's all the hormones from the eggs( which I think is bad, right) that made me have early puberty and made me have lots of body hair.      So since I had my growth spurt at grade 6, approximately how much taller might I grow? I'm currently 5'7". I'm aiming to be around 5'10" or 11" at least when I'm fully grown.      I've also started doing exercise everyday a few months ago. I do it after school.   - stretch   - 20 push ups   - weight lifting   - 200 jumping jacks   - 100 sit ups   - 10 times running up and down the stairs      This routine takes about 25 minutes to complete.      I eat organic oatmeal every morning without sugar. And eat all my meals. I try to sleep by 11pm. I wake up at 7am to go to school. I also drink 3 or 4 cups of skim milk everyday.      I'm about 120 pounds. I'm not fat. lol.         ......just really want to catch up with my friends, they all started growing so tall, much taller than me starting around last year. I use to be the tallest in grade 6 and 7 because I had early puberty, now I'm just average.  I've also been at 5'7" for about 2 years already.      Thank you.

I was 12 when I lost my virginity to a girl of my age...it wasnt really sex more fooling around but we did have sexual intercorse...I then went with another because I liked it and wanted to try it more and more.   I then found out that a girl that was 16 wanteed to go out with me, well I was excited because she was older and more expereinced. She used to use me for all sorts of things, told me where to touch and what to do etc etc..Now I wasnt a big guy and wasnt all that grown up but thought it was awesome, I could never finish though, if you know what I mean? (she could)   Then when she had finished with me another girl of 17 nearly 18 used to do the same because the 16 yrs old was her mate and they had obviously been chatting to each other and told each other to do things to me.  I just sit back and enjoyed, they showed me porn and all sorts of things.  bearing in mind I had only just turned 12 years old and had sex with 4 different people in the space of 6 months.   I was in a close neighbourhood, tightly knitted with other familys as it was on an army barracks and all the kids hung out with each other, this 16yr old and 17 yr old used to have sex with all the Squadies (older army men, even married ones sometimes)..It has only occured to me in the past year (now I am 28) that I think this was wrong of the 17yr old especially as she was almost 18, in fact I thnk she was still using me when she turned 18...there were times when I didnt want to do things and she would keep doing them, I just thought it was normal and great cus I was alot younger and all my mates were jealous   Anyway do you think this was abuse? I dont know what to think of it..its started to freak me out a little lately..cant stop thinking about it, I told my GF and she thinks I may need counciling..I have had counciling in the past but never brought this up with anyone..not even my mum who I can talk to about anything...Do you think I should just forget it and move on, it was a long time ago..I just want to know if this is going to affect me with relationships, addiction to sex (which I think I have had before, its ruined two long term relationships) Whats your thought please?       Thanks guys!
20090128204028AAxrcXI	Health;Women's Health	I have question about a personal female experience?	I was sexually assaulted about 2 years ago now. I did report it and had a rape kit. I now work in EMS and I had a pt come in that was sexually assaulted. This patient reminded me of me. Same weight, age, height, body type and same medical issues. This patient was very scared and acted how I did.   My issue was that it brought back painful memories and opened the flood gates for tears. I was offered counseling services by a rape crisis center but never took them up on it. Should I look into it now? Where could I find a number for contacting someone?

20090128195134AAPBFiL	Health;Mental Health	Drug rehab and mental health question?	I have admitted that I have a serious addction to drugs. And I would say its not specific. Its like when im on drugs I think about quiting, but when im sober im thinking about getting drugs. I just dont want to be a part of reality, and I feel normal when im on drugs, if its alcohol, weed, pills, or cough syrup, I will do whatever. I almost cant even put into words what its like in my mind everyday or what I deal with, like one minute I can create all these goals and start plans and projects and be out going, and almost feel like I have a direct connection with god, and then its the complete opposite, just blackness and I hate people or like both at the same time, its extreamly scary. I want to quit drugs to feel happy, and to see things clear,  but because my manic deppresion is so bad as well its like I will never be. Most of the time I feel extreamly deppresed, but at the same time I have a interest in everything in the world. My moods change so much now, that I can notice it and its like im locked inside my mind and I cant get out.  I feel like im losing my mind, and everyday I question why I shouldent just blow my brains out. I need to be somewhere for drugs and because of my mental state. I was wondering if there is a place for this the can focus on my problems with drugs and my bipolar. And the cost. And if anyone has suggestions or can just relate to me, any thing at this point could help. Thank you.

I have lived with depression since i was 13 and was prescribed Ativan, ive been on many more pills since, valium, prozac,seroxat,amatryptoline, i wont go on, i am on meds at the moment, i also have physical problems too.  I was asking my partner to try and help me find a way to be either voluntarily accepted into a psych ward, either that or sectioned, for his and my daughters safety, i self harm when i feel i cant control the littlest things in my life, i burn myself, but as Christmas got nearer and the stress of being short of money, having a 14 yr old who i love dearly, and wanting to get her at least what i could afford, and it wasn't much, i lost it, i felt these anger,anxious, and really negative violent feelings really overwhelming me, until i actually punched my daughter, now, i know it was wrong, as i was brought up with constant beatings, and i felt really bad and low afterwards, so i waited until my partner was out, and my daughter and took a load of pills and ran a bath, and i felt euphoric that i was leaving this hell behind, not my family just the feelings of sheer uselessness, before that i called the school and told them what i had done, and social workers got involved, they asked if she wanted to press charges, she refused, its the first time i have ever raised my hand to her,(one too many) but have had violent outbursts before so i knew how i felt  wasn't just going to go away, we had such a horrible xmas and new year, and i still get feelings of wanting to kill myself often. I have tried in the past i ended up on a life support machine, the only thing that stopped me was my partner taking the pills and flushing them down the toilet this time, i just wish i could wake up every day and feel good, i get the odd day im up and down constantly.  does anyone know of an outreach place or any kind of help i can attend so i can deal with whats making me feel like this and could help me stop burning? any answers would be appreciated, im in the glasgow area, Scotland.  Thank you.  (long question sorry )

20090128202748AApEFe2	Health;Women's Health	Itchy Vagina... Help?	Recently my vagina has been itchy.  It isn't an exterior itch around my inner thighs or where my pubes are.  It feels like a deeper itch inside my actual vagina.      I had sex a week ago.  We used a condom.  I have no STDs, and he was a virgin.  However, he was rather large.      I have had no funny colored or bad smelling discharge, or burning sensations when I pee.  The itching started the day after I had sex.      My guesses are 1) SInce he was very large, he may have rubbed me very raw and caused an itch, 2) I may be allergic to latex from the condom (although that has never happened before), 3) Maybe some soap have irritated me from washing it in the shower.      I highly doubt it is an STD because I have none and he was a virgin (although he *could* still have one, but he seemed healthy).      Can anyone help??       Thanks!

My period isn't until around February 14 (what a way to spend Valentine's Day...) but I can't help but freak out. And I also read on the box that Plan B doesn't work as well for Chinese women. I'm Chinese so do you think I have to be worried about that even though I took it within 24 hours?      I have another question sort of related to this. After I had sex with my boyfriend, I went to the bathroom like usual to pee. But when I sat down to pee, no pee came out. Instead, a few drops of what I think is semen dripped out. The end condom was really torn. It wasn't a tiny hole. Does this mean that I'm more likely to be pregnant?

20090128204209AAaJDf6	Health;Women's Health	Im having some period problems...?	This is what happens everytime, i go to the bathroom and see that there is blood on the toliet paper and of course i think im on my period.  There isnt alot of blood its just light red almost pinkish.  So i put a tampon in and later when i take it out there is pretty much nothing on the tampon.  Eventually my period does get a little heavy maybe for a day then all it ends up doing is turning into brownish looking blood.  I have been on the pill for a lil over a year and i dont know if thats what is causing this or what...i hope my question wasnt too hard to understand.

20090225153425AAsZCxM	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Cancer	I need some help deciphering my rad. report?	Ive had these symptoms for almost 2 years now:  bloated feeling, like Im always gonna start my period. very low back pain specifically on the right side.  Pain that feels like its in my hip bones & radiates down my upper legs. After lying or sitting I have to make myself take painful steps until I can get going. Gas, no matter what I eat. Not hungry, doesn't take much to feel full.  No weight loss though (if anything weight gain).  I also  only have had 1 or 2 periods a year. (pre-menopausal);  have had intravaginal ultrasounds & based on the last results my doctor wants to get me into surgery right away to remove my right ovary. She does not want to run anymore tests (no MRI or CA125) Is that normal procedure?? this is the report: The endometrial echo complex measures .3cm in thickness.there is a 2.5 x2.6 cm density whithin the right adnexal. There is some echogenicity and evidence of accoustic shadowing which was not seen previously. though the configuration is similar to the previously demonstrated complex right adnexal lesion & there is possible calcification. (plus theres the other generic writings)  Does this sound like something benign?? or does it sound more like ovarian cancer??  thank you - my mind is going crazy waiting to get back in to see the doctor & have the surgery scheduled.....She said I really dont have any other options at this point.

20090225153813AAuM3RS	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Other - Diseases	What could be a possible cause of a low platelet count in a 13 yr. old girl?	My daughter has been feeling weak and shaky, and bruises easy. I took her to the Dr. They ruled out any sugar problems and we also went to an endocrinologist. All tests were normal except the platelets were low. My PCP will not be in office till Friday, and I am a nervous wreck..I'm not letting my daughter see that i'm nervous though. A few years ago she was in the hospital for a week, with a high fever and a strange rash on face and neck, it was red stripes. They never could find the cause, so they chalked it up to a virus. She also had oral surgery at 7 years old and the following day developed "liver clotting" and had to be rushed to the surgeon. Any ideas?
