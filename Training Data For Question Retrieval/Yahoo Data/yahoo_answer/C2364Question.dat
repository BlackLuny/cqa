20090309120605AAcbzAr	Education & Reference;Financial Aid	Stafford Student Loan?	So I'm looking to take out a student loan for no more than like 5 grand.       My reasoning is of course for school but to also move to another state and somewhat start over. Will that work?       I'm currently not in school but I was planning to go back this    summer.Idk how these student loans work & the website isn't answering my questions. Do they base the loan off of your grades? Do you have to have a certain amount of credits? I've been in school on & off for the last 3 or so yrs now. Community College.       Like most people in this messed up economy, money seems to be the answer to solve our problems. I really want & need this loan.    Thanks!

20090309142119AAunZC9	Education & Reference;Homework Help	I need ideas on a school project dealing with the Odyssey...?	I have to write a skit, then perform it in front of the whole class. I, somewhat luckily, have other students helping me with this, but they're fresh out of ideas as well.      Basically, we have to spin the skit off of a television show. We chose Cops, because it'd just be easier than the others off the list. Also, we have to spin off another group that's also doing Cops. They are doing all the fighting and arresting part. My teacher told me that we could do the "holding cell" part, so that's how we're spinning this off of the first group.      We can make it goofy, and that's what we planned on doing. The characters of the cast will be the lotus eaters(the bad guys), and Telemachus and Odysseus(the good guys). The opening scene is when we have one of the good guys throwing one of the lotus eaters(probably me) into our "holding cell."      What I am asking is what should we say? What should our lines be? This skit must last ten minutes of the class. Trust me, I've asked for a lower time. I just need some ideas of what to say.

This is my 4th year of teaching Kindergarten and the first time that I have really had an issue with many boys (3 or 4) in my class being mean and bullying others.

I am not sure if anyone has any tips, ideas, or anything that would help with boys ( a bullying book or something) or any advice to help me deal with the parent too. Thanks!

20090309142935AAgO0lO	Education & Reference;Higher Education (University +)	Does the school I go to for my undergraduate degree matter when applying for graduate schools?	I am in quite a dilemma. I have always had my heart set on UW-Madison. However, I don't think I'll be able to afford it. So as an alternative, I've started looking at some smaller UW schools and found out they were like 8,000 dollars cheaper and some even guaranteed scholarships to students who have shown academic excellence. So I've been thinking that I could just attend Eau Claire or La Crosse and save oodles of money and then go to Madison for graduate school. However, I'm worried that I won't be seen as competitive to Madison as a student who went to a bigger, more prestigious university for their undergraduate degree. I'm also worried that my quality of education I would be getting at one of these smaller schools won't be as good as Madison. But again, I'm not really sure how this all works. Any thoughts?

20090309151837AAJHQ7p	Education & Reference;Higher Education (University +)	Should I do anything about the comments made on my essay?	I got marks back on my essay today, and was none too pleased. I only got 54% (I usually get in the range of 65 - 72%). I can understand that I got a poor mark, as I know the quality of work was not up to  scratch, but some of the comments made I really don't agree with. For instance one of the comments made was "there are consistent grammatical errors", and another mentioned problems with my sentence structure". Having read through it again I really don't see these errors (we don't get the essay back so I am unable to see where in my work the marker is referring too). Should I speak to my course leader about the comments or do you think it best to just leave it. After all I think it unlikely my mark would be changed that much anyway.      By the way I am on a Master course.

20090309161219AAoi9bV	Education & Reference;Primary & Secondary Education	Should I go to this boarding school, or stay? I'm really confused....?	Okay, so I found out about this performing arts boarding school called Interlochen around November and immediately wanted to apply. I did an audition but never sent it in because I wasn't sure if I wanted to go....I don't want to get accepted and make a rushed decision about whether or not I want to go.   I auditioned for the theatre department, but the problem is I don't have a lot of theatre experience. There's a community theatre here that I could do in the summer, but is that enough?   Plus I'm with this amazing voice coach, and I don't wanna just ditch him. He's really working on making my voice sound as good as it can, with my style of music in mind and everything. I'm working on the acting with him, too. So you can understand why that's a reason I don't want to leave.   But on the other hand, I could get voice lessons at Interlochen, and more.      So here's what I could do:   -Audition, and if I'm accepted, go there next year, and possibly for the rest of high school.   -Wait it out for a year and make up my mind, & train with my vocal coach.   -Not go at all.      I know I should probably wait, but there are a lot of good opportunities at Interlochen, and I don't want to miss out on any of them. If I went next year, I would be a sophomore.   Another reason I want to go next year is because the school district I'm in now is terrible for me...the environment is hard for me to learn in. At Interlochen, they integrate the arts with academics, which would be so much better.   I've done a ton of research about this school, and it seems perfect for me. I even know a few people who go there.      Ugh...I just don't know what do to!!

I know thousands of designers, and study it religiously, as many people do.   I have much intelligence, not to sound to boastful.   My science and english scores are very high.      Here's one of the breakers,   I am unbelievably (this is sad, I know, but get over it) materialistic, so the salary of a physician would come handy. This said, I would be more than glad to have a smaller home with kids, but the idea of worrying about money is a definite NO for me.      ...So, I'd love to get people's views on this.    I need an adults feedback, because this IS my future,    and my parents are a TAD biased.

20090309153442AAvFbMJ	Education & Reference;Financial Aid	Student Loans and Getting Married?	I am returning to university in the fall, and my girlfriend and I are considering marriage this summer. However, I am worried how marriage will effect my eligibility for Student Loans. I can't get a straight answer out of Saskatchewan Student Loans, as there are, "too many variables" for them to estimate-- I can only get married, apply and hope for the best.      My gal makes ca. $50,000/yr, and is currently pursuing her Master's. I am in my late twenties, with a prior student loan (now paid off to ca. $6500). I'm working full-time for $10/hr (I left a salary to pursue further education), for now and my pre-study period, and p/t as a student. Again, we live in Saskatchewan.      Is there anyone out there with FIRST HAND knowledge of how marriage can or will effect my application for a loan? Anyone who's been in this situation? I am enrolled at the U of Sask., anticipating tuition + books to be $5000 for two semesters.      Thanks!

I am kinda upset right now because I've been searching and searching and I just can't find any affordable colleges that have my major/area of study which is Digital Film, Film/Television and or Advertising Design. I've found 2 of the best and most beautiful art colleges that have those exact majors but they are over 30,000-40,000 a year for tuition, room and board, and college fees. Tuition nowadays is absolutely ridiculous! I am seriously amazed! I want to go to a college just for art and design but because they are private and specialized in just art and design majors, they are sky high. I even tried looking at some cheap universities and only a few had my major and they were still 20,000 for out of state students; which are a lot cheaper for tuition, room and board, ect than art and design schools but they are still too high. My parents won't co sign for a loan and you know a 18 year old won't get a 30,000 loan.       I've always wanted to become a director and or a designer for fashion billboards and ads but it seems like it's not going to come true in 4 years. Right now I'm at a community college. I'm just going there because my parents made me and to stay on their insurance. Is anybody else in this situation? What can I do this year or in the near future to go to the college of my choice. I heard Obama put in a plan for college tuition. When do y'all think that will come into effect?

This is a essay about the perfect mate, and the views you and your parents have about one.   Is the intro any good?       '      In this world, it is a widely spread principle that everyone should have the right to choose their own       partner in life. Everyone has a unique mind, and no two think alike. For someone other than to judge the perfect man for another is in many ways akin to an injustice towards an exclusive mind. A perfect example of this would be young Christine, and her mother’s dispute towards the perfect mate. Individually, both predictably believe their views are better than the others. The daughter wishes for a clever minded man, while the mother wishes towards a hardworking rich man.' (Theres more, but I'll stop there.)

Although I go to regular school I would like to ask some question or obtain some information about the following:      - Low Tuition      - Good Education - Which universities would be best for me?      - No interpreters. I will never understand them.       - F.M system. Does university provide “free” F.M system or will I have to pay for it? If so, how much it costs? (It lets teachers talk into a hand-held microphone, which transmits the sound of the teacher’s voice directly to me of my cochlear implant.)      - A place to live at in University but with a small amount of money if possible and if not, I will find a place by myself.       Thank you
20090309165443AARvMpk	Education & Reference;Teaching	What can be done about a prejudiced public school teacher?	Okay...we have this teacher for World History. She seems to know a bit of her stuff (she's made some rather large mistakes like which side of North America Alaska is on but aside from the occasional mistake she seems to know a bit of stuff). She teaches the world's cultures, but she seems to be quite prejudiced/biased and gives off the impression that her way is best or people different from her are doing things the wrong way.       One quite noticeable example is that every time somebody does something wrong, she yells out that they are a bunch of heathens and that they need to go to church more.      Another example would be if we are discussing a perfectly normal way of life, in this case vegetarianism (and I can't find anything wrong with a well-balanced vegetarian diet with multiple calcium, iron, and protein sources), she will say something like, "...[They are a] bunch'a freaks. I couldn't stand not being able to dig into a good steak every now and then."      I could continue for sure, but I think the idea has set in. Is there anything that can be done about this? She appears pretty stubborn in her ways (i.e. hardheaded) and you can't conceive convincing her that her views aren't any more right than other people's views, or live to tell about the attempt...hahaha...      So, could anyone out there try to help me?      Thanks in advance.

Also for those of you who read the poem I posted: do you think I should focus on writing poetry or writing stories. Thanks!      What happens when the walls around you that were built for protection turn into iron gates keeping you in? I want to feel safe here. I want to find comfort in the home I grew up in and the people I’ve grown used to. That just isn’t possible anymore. I am bursting at the seams waiting to leave this penitentiary. I can see my past here in every little crack in the paint. There are so many things that I just want to forget, things that I need to leave behind. This is where my insecurity was born, here is where humiliation showered over me for the first real time, I cried here on the floor for hours with the phone pressed to my ear, and these people pretended to be nice and stifled their laughter at every step. I see it all, every gruesome little detail. Everything is engraved into my psyche and I can only think of one way to wipe it clean. I will escape - because here isn’t forever. My past will die when I let this place become dead to me. Everyone who hurt me will die with it.

20090309181954AANWy63	Education & Reference;Primary & Secondary Education	Regretting my performance in school?	I can't believe it took me until final semester of my senior year to realize that i'm not a dummy.      So this semester I finally decide that i'm gonna do something special with my life and that I would prove all those who doubted me wrong.      Heres the story:      So pretty much I was a bad apple during junior high. I didn't give a hell about grades, was always in trouble, and was generally a "low level student".       The result of this was that once I got to high school, I was put into a couple of low level classes. Now being the fool that I was, I just went with the flow and ended up doing badly all throughout grade 10-11 and midway through this year (senior year)      Miraculously, I managed to stay in 2 of the good level classes.      Now heres the kicker:      I had not studied since the 5th grade (I scored a 98% on my test that year! I know, impressive huh? It's only an example haha) and decided (just to prove all the people who think  that im idiotic wrong) that I would study for a test and see how I would do.       I scored the 2nd highest mark in the class.       I know this probably doesn't sound amazing to you. But when all I had done for a long time was envy those "smart ones" around me it was pretty amazing. I have 2 friends in that class who are considered some of the smartest people, not only in that class, but in the general populace of the school. People just know they are intelligent. They are both attending University, and that was considered a far cry from what was ever expected for me.        I beat them both in that test by 30%-40%. I have been getting praise from teachers and it's pretty overwhelming and humbling, but also makes me regret my school performance so far.      I know this looks like a subtle way for me to brag, but it isn't. I'm just looking for some inspiration, maybe someone knows people with stories similiar to mine? Did you overcome anything like this? I need motivation.   University was in no way an option for me(because I never believed in myself) but now I think otherwise. I just need some motivation. People that will encourage me. Do you know people who have stories like this one?
