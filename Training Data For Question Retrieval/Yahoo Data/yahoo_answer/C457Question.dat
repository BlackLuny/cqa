20090226155010AASu2Ux	Home & Garden;Decorating & Remodeling	How should I paint my bathroom walls?	This is the bathroom I'm using for my new bathroom    http://www.target.com/Tree-Bath-Collecti...     http://www.target.com/Tree-Shower-Curtai...       It's not a very big bathroom, it has a toilet and a full size tub with a shower in it but I was wondering what kind of paint I should paint it, I was thinking a dark chocolate brown but then I wasn't sure if that would make it look smaller so I was thinking stripes or something? And maybe cream colored rugs what do yall think? I'm 19 so keep that in mind I want something classy; also what other things do you think I should include in there, any decorations or anything?? Thanks!

I've already gone through about 300 lbs of level quick to try to even things out but my floor is just too uneven in too many places AND in too many directions!

My laminate panels have the blue foam already installed underneath them, but I was thinking about buying an extra layer of it for more padding. I know this won't fix the "see sawing" in areas but what else can I do?!?

I have 37.1 acres near Alamosa, CO. and plan on building an open-wide house, really simple it seems. The house will just be one open room. So, with 10 foot ceiling and 400 square feet, how much will concrete foundation, materials for house and everything cost. This also includes having the plumbing installed by a professional as well as an electrician wiring the house and inspection. Keep in mind that my county only has these two inspections and only requires a building permit. Also, do not include the cost of electricity because I know how to build solar panels hooked to controller hooked to inverter. The off-grid will cost me $6,000 So the electrician will just have to wire to inverter and a few other things. I will also hang the sheet rock myself and tape and mud and paint.So how much will just the foundation and framed house cost with metal roof?    Thank you for all your help.

20090226184212AACO74W	Home & Garden;Maintenance & Repairs	UK Deductions to Damage Deposit?	Me and 3 friends have been renting a house under a joint tenancy for about 7 months now. The house when we moved in was in a pretty bad state of affairs, its really rather run down and had not been cleaned to any reasonable standard (dead spiders in cupboards etc) and several things were broken and warn among many other negative things that have occured during our tenancy. However as of 2 months ago they started showing people round the property for next year, and to be honest the house wasn't all that tidy due to my house mates lack of interest in cleaning lol (i try my best), as a result last week I had an encounter with the letting agent who oversees our property as i woke up to her wandering about our house uninvited. The house just the day before had finally been cleaned to the best our our ability because we though it was only fair if they were showing more people round, though apparently our house was "in a disgusting state" and we are going to be charge "for everything". So far she has sent someone to collect 5 bin bags that were outside our house, and someone to fix a draw that was already broken when we moved in. Can she really charge us for things before we've moved out? Are bin bags outside the house "damage"? It is my understanding that charges can only be made after we have moved out, not during when we have time to clean and make repair ourselves before we move out, regardless of whether they are trying to show people round or not, which i may add they do without informing us before hand.

I am on a budget, but I would like something that gets my resale value peaked! (I know i will not be selling for awhile)!

I plan to be here at least another 3 years or keep it and rent it out later on.      Thanks.      Thanks

You know the grounded ones that most people plug their computers and accessories into. Can those be hard wired into home circuits. Not necessarily existing circuits. Say you were going to re wire the house. Or just a room. Could you then hard wire three or four of them in a direct line in the circuit. I am a musician, and I have equipment that would benefit from such an arrangement.

20090226174532AA3OjRA	Home & Garden;Garden & Landscape	How should i prune my redbud tree?	We purchased a home last fall, and we have a redbud tree growing in the front yard that has a very odd shape.  At the base of the trunk, it is about 8 inches around.  The trunk is long and skinny and bent over. It starts bending over about 6 feet up and has no branches or blossoms until you get to about the 8 foot area.  I hate the way the tree is shaped.  I have seen other redbuds that appear to have been cut down at the base of trunk and then grew new sprouts that were very pretty.  Any advice.  I can't think of any other way to get it  to a nicer bushy shape that i won't hate all year long.

20090226192037AAjL2kt	Home & Garden;Do It Yourself (DIY)	Trying to fix scratches, i'm in way over my head here.?	I've got a 2008 Toyota Camery LE, it's paint color is desert sand mica, gold really. I've got a few pretty deep scratches from shopping carts on my front bumper. I went to auto zone, and got all the things that I needed to fix it myself, toyota quoted me 800 dollars and I just can't find that in my budget. It all came out well, until I got a rush rain strom out of no where that caused my paint to run, and then it all just peeled off, now i have this one spot that you can see the edges around the paint, after trying to sand that out smooth, I finally ran out of paint. The thing is, you can still see some of the primer grey underneath. I tested the clear coat also, and it just doesn't seem as shiny as the rest of the car, I know I am in way over my head, but I just can't afford to take it to maco or the toyota dealership, I really need some advice here
