cWxwHMQWaa	My Mamma, I have a good bit of my Daddy in me also.    And there's two friends I have that I love so much because it's like being friends with myself, they feel the same...I keep trying to get all 3 of us together but so far, no dice.     It may be too much like perfection then though, maybe it's just not meant to be haha =o)|`|uXqDYPNVaa	Probably my dad. I take after him in almost all ways.|`|Vh5DrXvOaa	My brother is 7 years older than me but we could be twins.. we have ways just alike..scary|`|N0fCDn33aa	My sister likes sex just as much as I do.

wSjLVDteaa	this is quite normal in women, its called masochism.... i like the fact that so many women are submissive in bed....          EDIT: i have NO idea why he wouldnt be into it.... i would...    just assure him that you wont be offended    maybe hes embarassed because hes thinking that he might not do it smoothly.... maybe hes thinking that he'll look like an idiot... i dont know what his problem is.. im just guessing|`|z2xRXM5Laa	Finding men who will treat you badly as if you are beneath them...Nothing in the world is easier to find! (Well, you will always find men who don't know anything about giving a woman the big O).|`|cWxwHMQWaa	So you want this on a regular basis then?    You say great for a day then life as usual as if you're unhappy.     Maybe you need a different partner if this is really a need for you. Honestly, some men are just not at all into this regularly or deeply, and they've very uncomfortable doing it.    I know the thought of treating my partner this way regularly definitely would be difficult for me, I'd do it, but I couldn't do it too often.     It's great to compromise and all, but this may just be too much to ask of him if it's more than once in a while, yanno?     Talk to him, tell him what you're into and why and see what happens. If he's not into it, he's not into it. You won't change that about him if it's just not in him to do it.     Best luck =o)|`|S2vI4VEXaa	I thought everyone had those fantasies..  Seems normal to me, and if they're not, oh well..|`|84gK4XlHaa	It's actually a fairly common fantasy.  I just read an article on this for class actually.  It's usually not about liking abuse or even being a masochist.  It's more about control.  Because it's all in your mind or because it's a role played scene, you ultimately have the control in a situation that would otherwise make you feel bad or victimized.  (Yeah, I get them too.)    Edit:  The best way that I can think of to get your boyfriend to go for it is to sit him down, tell him exactly what you want, assure him more than once that this is what you want, and then work out details like a safe word.  A safe word is good, because aside from being well, safe, it lets your BF know that so long as you're not saying it you're still enjoying it.  Who knows?  Maybe he'll be into it too.|`|hl4kkvXhaa	It's pretty common for women who are controlling to have fantasies about giving over that control to someone, and letting them control them.  I wouldn't worry about it, as long as you're not running around trying to get this sort of abuse from any and every guy you can.  If you play it safe, and you're with your partner who you know you can trust not to take things too far, it isn't dangerous...and as I said, many women fantasize like you do.|`|P1VXjLPOaa	Sounds like a healthy sexual lifestyle to me.|`|rjVALevtaa	Sounds like fun to me. I don't think there's anything wrong with being submissive in bed as along as you aren't like this in other parts of your life.|`|XK2hy07Paa	OMG! SAME THING WITH ME! ive tried telling my boyfriend to take control before and be in control, but he doesnt seem to understand. haha we have a lot in common!|`|HbB45kcNaa	I think everyone has those fantasies sometimes; but some refuse to admit it because they think it makes them look weak.|`|w9cicy0Daa	Silence you worthless harriden!

TJpQZju2aa	C. NASCAR costs the American taxpayer $$$  t-shirts will not be the greatest costs assumed by those in attendance. Before the green flag ever falls at a single event, these, and all other American taxpayers will have already paid over $16 million for the "Army of One" sponsorship on a Winston Cup stock car.    That's right, American taxpayers dish out millions to purchase sponsorship for the United States Army in NASCAR's elite touring series.  The sponsorship intends to reach the sports-minded 17-24 year old male population, a main source of possible Army recruits. However, that prime demographic group constitutes less than 10 percent of NASCAR fans and viewers, meaning that relatively few of the Army's target audience will ever see the black and gold "Army of One" car in action.|`|IaFTUQQGaa	I say B    because it tends to show a disconnect in the American family  and since that is a building block of society   when it gets shattered the building falls.|`|K6fasl6kaa	none of the above.  it's drugs.|`|jAqVoGlmaa	all of the above plus so so much more|`|v3dTJIrcaa	B.......

kBmy1joWaa	I'd rather lose my sight. Humans often judge people based on their appearance. I think it would be easier to find strong relationships with people if you didn't know what they look like, and judged solely on who they are as a person. The most meaningful things in life cannot be seen; love, for example. It would also be a good lesson in faith. "faith is believing what you can not see; the reward of faith is to see what you belive"-St. Augustine   God bless!  Hannah :)|`|na9nG47zaa	hmm... I LOVE MUSIC but i also love seeing people and looking at things oh my goodness this is so hard :( ??? probably deaf... maybe geeze i dont know ahahhaha idk i cant decide!!|`|7FMzLAdBaa	deaf. because i can not stand not seeing the world|`|HsCHz0kyaa	That would really be a tough choice, because I love to listen to music.  But being blind, you couldn't do to much.  Based on pros/con's of each one, i would chose to be deaf, because if your blind, how are you going to get to bathroom?  or what about drive to the store?  or put on clothes.  and if your deaf, you can get a hearing aid.|`|ajTo21jNaa	deaf|`|UNrnMt3Vaa	I would rather be deaf, being hard-of-hearing to begin with, making the transition wouldn't be much of a challenge for me. The only thing that would affect me the most would be not to hear the most beautiful sounds and music the world has to offer. Also since I learned American Sign Language ever since I was four, it wouldn't be hard to interact in social places such as normal teens do today. Being blind however wouldn't make my life any easier as I depend completely on my eyes to be my ears. This is why I hate walking in the dark, because I cannot see things that are making noises. Although it would be a hard choice for some, they should consider themselves lucky as I am. It could be worse.
2LYvu6Utaa	There's actually a whole lot going on in this dream. First, you are really, really comfortable around your boyfriend. You're ready to go just about anywhere with him, or at least you think you are. But be careful, use your head as well as your heart - you also are somewhat blind to the consequences of your actions. Having a child is a HUGE task and responsibility, which subconsciously, you don't quite grasp. It's not weird that this dream made you happy; you have strong maternal instincts, no matter how young you are. Just be sure to wait until the rest of your life is in order before you think about having kids for real.|`|d2MNkKpXaa	oh my god! I had the same dream last night! Except I'm 14, and I don't remember there ever being a father, since i don't have a boyfriend and I never had sex. But like, I didn't have a bump, and it felt like 2 seconds later I gave birth and it didn't even hurt!|`|nfYAIDGqaa	sounds like twilight.|`|1AOjQSwOaa	No its normal its like a message from heaven that a new chapter (a good one hopefully) will open in your life you will experience good and positive things.

rCMfIrf5aa	If you stare at anything too hard or too long it can give the illusion that its moving.  For example, ever notice a dark crumb on the floor? You stare at it and try to decipher if its a crumb or a bug.  After staring at it hard enough you'll swear you saw it move and that its a bug when its really just a crumb.    Does this happen when you look at other things?  If not maybe its just the angle of the picture or something along those lines.      This definitely does not mean you are going crazy.  Paranoid, maybe.  Crazy, no.|`|SG27rfSdaa	alot of times when we stare at a picture or something it can appear to move.  it's normal.

E4vkAukiaa	The proponents of tax cuts say that businesses would tend to hire more people if they can save some money by paying less taxes. This would presumably create more jobs. Also, tax cuts for individuals would mean more money to spend and that would presumably lead to increased economic activity.    Whether this actually works or not is a question nobody seems to be asking. I for one do not know for sure.|`|3SYnZEZ9aa	Tax cuts help the economy because people will spend that money on something.  We have a serious paradigm problem.  That problem being that a significantly large amount of people think that the government needs to try to solve these kinds of problems.  Because of this, the government has taken the authority and actually caused this problem.    The best way to fix the system is to get rid of our Central Bank, the Federal Reserve and get back on a currency that is actually backed by metals like gold and silver.  This would force government to be responsible in its spending.    Currently, if there's not enough money, they just print more, which is irresponsible because our kids will have to pay back the "imaginary" money at an interest.    The system is set up so that most of us are forced to continue working for much longer than we really have to.
AA10461474	I disagree with the method, but under normal parenting circumstances, it should not lead to full reactive attachment disorder which is very serious. However, depending upon how frequently it might be used and the sensitivity and temperament of the child, it could certainly put the child at risk for developing problems with a trusting relationship. In an ideal world, this method would never be used.|`|d307fbd26168d0aae54b1779f57e62e1aa	Yes.
wIQnC6pTaa	Inflation happens when the money supply grows faster than the growth in goods and services in the economy.    So imagine a desert island which has $10 in circulation and 10 coconuts for sale.  Each coconut should be worth $1, assuming that was all you could buy on the island.  If you print $10 more and grow only 5 more coconuts, then you have $20 in circulation and 15 coconuts for sale.  Each coconut has now risen in price to $1.33, which is a 33% inflation rate.    Inflation is typically calculated by dividing the curent price level by the price level last year (or for a monthly inflation rate, divide the current price level by the price level last month).    There is no trade-off between inflation and the strength of the economy.  You could have low inflation and a fast-growing economy (e.g. in the late 1990s) or low inflation and a sick economy (e.g. today).  Conversely, you could have high inflation and a fast-growing economy (e.g. China in the 1980s) or high inflation and a sick economy (e.g. Latin America in the 1980s).    Remember, inflation only happens if you grow your money supply faster than the real growth in your economy.  You could have strong real growth in the economy and not have inflation if you simply keep your money supply growth in check.    Right now, the economy is weak (i.e. low real growth) and the Fed is creating money at record levels.  So why is there no inflation?  The reason is because wealth is being destroyed at the same time from falling property values and stock prices, so there is actually less "money" in circulation, when you count not just currency sitting in banks but also people's wealth tied up in their homes and stocks.
zWqKuIQuaa	Yes doctors dismiss women.  Thats why we have specialized womens hospitals and 10x more is spent on womens diseases like breast cancer than mens diseases like prostrate cancer.    -- Edit --  Capricorn we arent talking about "those days".  They also thought smoking was good for you.|`|f6f40965eb7d5df6aa94440ec71e32dcaa	Didn't doctors in those days dismiss every woman's issue by saying that she was 'hysterical' or imagining it?    EDIT: monmichka: If you can, can you post the examples?|`|wkjncmHTaa	There is nothing inaccurate in what she said and yes, she should be as trusted as anyone else on GWS to disseminate information. I wonder why you assume she has little familiarity with the topic.    Edit    Actually she says nothing about a "conspiracy" so I'm wondering why you've chosen to put that word in quotation marks. You are misrepresenting what she is saying. What she does say is that heart attacks present differently in men and women and so they were not recognised and treated as well in women. There is plenty of information by experts to back this up.|`|iRKOJhYeaa	People like that really have got a twisted mind!|`|eBMKmgCjaa	Feminists are prone to paranoid ideas, and this conspiracy by the Patriarchal Health Professionals Association is just one more brick in their loony wall. Obviously Deirdre O has no idea of the ratio of funding spent on men and women's health, or she wouldn't talk such nonsense about women being treated as second best.|`|bb06GQ5Paa	What you suggest is very possible and probable.  However, doctors have a tendency to dismiss women when it comes to medicine.  That's the truth.    EDIT: LOL, why'd I get thumbs down?  I can give you five examples.|`|cWxwHMQWaa	Many doctors are turning patients in and out quickly and not doing a proper job over all, which isn't a gender issue, it's a medical issue.    I've seen women and men both told it was just 'stress' when they did actually have serious heart problems. Luckily none died, but they don't need to die for it to be a monumental problem with health care.    In Canada where health care is pretty much covered for most things, we see this because of lack of doctors and an overrun system and doctors who frankly don't usually tend to give a **** about patients they just want to see as many as possible. Once in a while you find a good one, and you wait weeks to see them knowing it's better than seeing a quack with a quota to fill. Again, not a gender issue.    I think though that you're minimalizing the problem which is that there are an awful lot of people receiving inadequate medical care because of doctors who can't be bothered to take time running tests and rather like just saying whatever gets them out the door the quickest.     Even in the US where people pay for their medical care or the few who have insurance experience the same in alarming numbers.     I wonder if you see this as a problem or think it's all just patients' BS =o/|`|s3IBrhZCaa	if her theory is true then why is it that most women live longer than most men?    you tell this Deidre O. lady to stop being so silly!
ViPLHvqXaa	Why do you think men have to pay higher insurance, it's because they get in more accidents lol. Most women are more responsible drivers than most men, plus they always get lost because they won't ask for directions, lol.|`|fVXWlYB9aa	because men are better driver     1.crash less  2.faster  3.take risks  4.the reason insurance is lower for women is because its attractive to them so they get more women at diamond.com and be getting more women lower rates  5.men can navigates well  6.ive been in 16 car crashes 2 owhichch were caused by men d rest by women.|`|96AQZUGyaa	You best be trolling.    I think men are generally better drivers. Its just one of our things.|`|jX7Bt0iBaa	.....I don't know why. It would probably be the same reaction if you were to say homosexual men make better drivers than straight men. People that are insecure about themselves, will get defensive.  Not that many people want to admit to something that makes their sense of self worth feel less worthy.     This is something that is frequent with some people in the gender/race/religious studies boards. Getting the other to admit to a flaw somehow...get's them, off. People are so strange.    As for the facts....by "aren't as good"....good in what way? Racing, maneuvering, and such?...I think guys are, because all our race car driving champs are mostly males. You don't need statistics to figure that one out. Most males are risky by nature.  Unfortunately....this does not translate well in normal everyday commuting. Men tend to get into a lot of traffic accidents then women on US roads. Young male drivers, ages 16-23, with fatality rates four times higher than average. Male drivers have a 77 percent higher risk of dying in a car accident than women, based on miles driven.    In a recent TrafficSTATS survey released back in 2007|`|wgZVeLZPaa	It really depends on the person.

I know this because my cousin works for the insurance company and they keep track of the statistics.|`|doeg7JSaaa	Because its not true, men usually have more skill especially when it comes to reversing parking etc and often better judgement but they are more inclined to take risks.  Also because women think they can multitask on everything they don't appreciate how important it is to focus only on driving when thus engaged.|`|BHb5LPb1aa	Ive drive pretty much everyday for the last 10 year and havent had a accident or speeding fine yet so tell me again how some women are better drivers then me    And of course lots of men hang out in the women studies how else are we going to learn what issues women face today and laugh at some of those hard core feminist who say all men are aholes|`|tfeseeeRaa	I don't know about better drivers in general but women definitely are better bus drivers than men.

If I had my way bus companies would only employ female bus drivers.|`|1d627596e14caafeacfad98d799d9a7caa	Ahh it was a setup! If women are better at driving it would shatter my belief everything. They don't seem to have good focus, depth perception, confidence, and an understanding of what it is that they are doing. Why do you think the man always chauffers the woman around?

k24zcshxaa	Because most politicians are lawyers, not economists. Besides, the name of the game in politics is making headlines rather than being competent. Sometimes folks who want to sound smart throw around terms that they don't really understand.|`|f36331383ab8dad2a7a7cbba8c28e980aa	I personally don't think the Laffer Curve's projection can ever be achieved. It doesn't simply put in the fact that not everybody is hardworking, and will work harder in equilibrium between kept income versus taxes.    The reason Reagan ran into deficits is because of his rapid militarization, and major tax cuts. He was also dealing with a newfound concept - supply-side economics.    The problem it's so rejected is that under Regan's tenure did the Federal Debt soar to almost 4 trillion dollars - the first time in US history not in a war-time setting. http://www.vimeo.com/2119049. IOUSA helps to explain this, but it doesn't criticize Reaganomics.    For the most part, the Laffer Curve will be seen as an instigator into the deficit rising in the Reagan Era, and it's intended purposed never utilized. So, it's 100% misunderstood.

He lived with five other guys, but at any given time there would be one or two random guys that would stay there for the week. In order to see each other I would have to come over in the early morning between our two jobs and classes. It was that, or we couldnt see each other during the week. He started sleeping out on the couch because his roommate that shared a room with him started a graveyard shift and needed his sleep. One morning, before the sun came up, I had just let myself in to his apartment, and saw that his alarm clock was by the couch so that he wouldnt sleep through class. He hadnt been expecting me so I carefully walked through the pitch black apartment trying not to trip over anything. I wanted to surprise him with a wake up kiss, so I knelt down and started to kiss him. It was turning quite passionate when all of the sudden he went completely rigid. I sat up to see what was wrong and it wasnt my fiance at all. It was some random guy who had just happened to stay overnight. I thought I was going to die! All I could pathetically say was, Sorry, I thought you were my fiance.

p2E60yBSaa	How attractive the person appears is entirely in the eye of the beholder. People will agree with certain things like skinny waist, big breast,... are attractive but I think a lot of the reason people think that stuff is just because they've been raised to believe these features are beautiful.|`|AA10339249	For the most part, odd and strange things about other people, like strange limps, hairlips, large moles, bush/chimp-like looks, short stature(unless you're a cute chick), wierd hair(unless you're a hot guy), stuttering, shifty eyes, drooling mouth, etc..|`|gdbeVf32aa	i dont believe their is an "unattractive" considering their is someone for everyone!|`|AA12219135	The way I understand it as far as appearance, it comes down to Symmetry.

I have felt like women were looking down on me before. Older executive types who look at me and my (adorable!!) children as if we have the plague. I hate that. lol|`|6H1ie8WXaa	I've met some pretty aggressive women but no, women are completely intimidated by me (one reason why I'm still single), they appear all submissive around me and say very little.|`|kxcDDMw9aa	No.|`|BHb5LPb1aa	Yeah this one chick had the biggest sharp eyes that when she stared wide eyed at me she intimidated me for sure ;)

mppB9ebgaa	Woods= unknown or lost  being high=disoriented or confused over a strong event in your life  pregnant= watching over closely, paying attention to detail     This is what I'm taking it as.     You are somewhat confused over where a new direction in your life will be taking you. You are making some reckless desicions or slipping on self critiquing your actions. This I see represented in your painless childbirth. Authority figures are noticing your change in form from being strict to loosening your grip on your moral values, but you have yet to see any consequences from your actions so you move ahead. This is represented from the baby and going 2 days without seeing it. Also the baby being slightly off is making me think that you might have done some lying recently to cover up your desicions.|`|qRSLhUpbaa	No one but yourself can correctly interpret your dream except you. In your dream, the part that seems most important to you is the least important and the thing that seems least important to you is, in fact, the most important. Also, in analyzing your dream remember that unless a dream is sexual or prophetic, and I'm guessing this was neither, everything in your dream is a different part of you. To find out what your subconscious is trying to tell you, speak in first person as every person and object in your dream. This will be strange and awkward at first, but you will be amazed at what it will reveal.|`|WdNvqduFaa	you were high you deserve to die
jH8hIB0kaa	Psychologist can not prescribe medication, if necessary. I'm not advocating the use of medicine as the only answer. Your initial visit needs to be with your family doctor. He can determine if you need to see a Psychiatrist. Your family doctor may be able to help you. Start there and everything can be directed by him or her (doctor).|`|KyAjmaOyaa	I don't think you really have a disorder, because everyone kind of feels the same. Do you drink a lot of water or any liquids? Peeing every 2-4 hours or an hour at the same routine.. I guess I have a similar problem because whenever I get nervous I feel like peeing too. Gosh I'm embarrassed writing this too, but I guess I should help you out. You should also wear some more clothes or something underneath just in case something happens. Nothing to really worry about though. Everyone kind of gets embarrassed when they gotta go, because you never know if you don't have time. Try not to hold it on for long though, because it could be bad if you hold on to your pee. If your gonna pee, just let it all out, don't worry about anything else. Don't be afraid to ask people where the bathroom is either. I'm sure they would help you out.  If your going to school in the morning, just take a long time in the bathroom in the morning. It's what I do everyday, and I'm completely fine at school. There are plenty of bathrooms there by the way. When your going out to the public also do it at home just before your about to go. Hope you get better.
MLJpjEuhaa	even though you haven't played for a while, you did ( and my guess is alot) because it sounds like you have tendonitus; it's a repetitive hand movement ailment;  if you don't deal with it can lead to even more pain (can even go into the arm, into shoulder and back) and possibly carpal tunnel syndrome.     stop the repetitive activity that causes pain and do some finger, hand, wrist and arm stretches; take an anti-inflammatory, and if pain is really bad, wear wrist braces. see your dr. they are familiar with this and can help you out.    It's not the end of the world. your hands wont fall off. It's a common thing that happens to many people who work with your hands.|`|6fvR8J9Kaa	this happens, it could be the way your holding the control or because maybe you played it a lot before then had a break and now gone back to it again, this change is possibly why your hands hurt,

Hope it helps a little|`|M3maZgdyaa	Besides the ones that life throws at ya out of the blue. As a dance teacher ankle problems, joint problems instep and arch problems and corns! LOL and an occasional sore foot from a student    EDIT: Topics for a discussion  A dance teacher probably works in the evening and that makes relationships hard. That is a tragedy to be unable to keep a relationship due to your Professional hours.    Another tragedy they face is a student falling in love with them. Something like that can devastate or ruin a career    If the teacher lost a limb in an accident.    To get rheumatoid arthritis    EDIT as a comedy!  maybe he is clumsy and trips over his own feet  He steps all over his students feet!  The floor was waxed extra slick|`|a20834f6b1047d276d0ed096fdbea380aa	Funny challenges, hey?    Well, you could joke about losing his muscle tone and dance physique to that of middle age (extra weight, wrinkles, etc) which is around the corner, in a way.    Being more at risk for health problems (if you can joke about that) like memory loss, poor vision, losing hearing.    If I think of more, I'll let you know.  ----------------------------------  Oh, the school "farm" retirement program for aging dance teachers.  LOL!

1xDtS8wwaa	Yes.    1) China's one of the few countries that doesn't have a massive national debt. In fact, China is one of the few countries that's making more money than it's spending.    2) China has a consumer base of at least 1,000,000,000 people. The United States, by comparison, has only 300,000,000 people, i.e. China has more than three times the number of consumers than the U.S. Right next door to China is India, which boasts another 1,000,000,000 export consumers.     4) How many products in your home are "Made in China?" Do you really believe the media scares about dangerous Chinese products have curtailed their sales?|`|cHaRg3fkaa	No, China will self destruct.  Listen to David Bowie's "China Girl" song.  The West will suck them into its Material World and then its game over for them as their wages, demand for more, greed, ..., take over it becomes a dog eat dog world.  Or, from a Physics point of view, gravity works, it's a law so what goes up, must come down.  Just look at the economic cycles of the major industrialized countries.  Or as they get richer they need to compete in the more technologically advanced markets to keep on increasing their wealth s their cheap labour, land, etc. markets have dried up and they now are in the big leagues with high wages, greedy capitalists, less educated population, etc..  The shock wave will hit them soon enough.  This si not to say the US will stay the dominant country forever either.

94NYYq5Haa	No.  She is still more likely to not have it than to have it.  She may be at an increased risk, especially if she is exposed to her mother's depression often.  There is some genetic component, but it's small and we don't really know what it is.|`|6sTsDvKmaa	Yes, depression can be genetic, like in the case of the hormonal imbalance.  But there are plenty of outside sources that cause it as well, such as stress or weather.    Some people have very happy parents but find themselves depressed.       There is no single cause for depression, but I wouldn't worry.  Just because your mom is depressed doesn't guarantee that you will be.|`|gDXa8q7raa	Depression is very complex.  Many studies have shown that it is partially genetic (but what isn't?) and that about half of it is unrelated to genes.

6kUx7fwcaa	You should learn to meditate or practice self-hypnosis.  Meditation can be learned from my blog on meditation http://blog.360.yahoo.com/blog-IeUS6eQye...    Self-hypnosis is on the web.    Many problems with memory have to do with attention and concentration.  People are just distracted and not thinking about what they have to remember.  Remembering is an active process that require the intent to remember and practicing mnemonic techniques.  Organizational skills also improves memory.  I have forgotten my keys so often that I have two large key rings that contain duplicates of important keys, like to the house and car, so that if I lock the keys in the car, for example, I can get in with the other one.  I place things in specific places so I don't forget where they are.  I have special places to place things so I have a limited number of places to work.  It is a job to remember to put them in those places and not just anywhere, but it cuts down on where I have to look.  That is an organizational skill.|`|4i3pNbtvaa	i wish i could give you a good answer  all i know is that  memory games are great for those kind of problems.  or puzzle games  try to do one every night if you have time  me for example i play "sudoku"  its a number game and it helps your brain to think more  i read that for old people, the puzzle games had helpped in order to avoid memory problems  my grandmother makes a alphabet soup EVERYDAY and she has the best memory ever xD she knows like 2000000 telephone numbers ahaha  well i hope my answer helps you :)  thnx for adding me as a friend!

However it alleviates a great deal of financial stress that we usually place on our selves. Humans are insatiable, so there is always that one more thing we want or think we need, so for many money they believe, would bring them happiness. Money can buy enjoyment but only temporary. Money is a commodity, used to buy the things we need like hydro, phone service and food. It is in itself something needed to survive. What gets us into trouble is the want of it, more is never enough. Happiness is the emotion; contentment, peace of mind, giving to others, love and family are what truly gives us happiness and none of these cost a penny. Imagine that!|`|B1GjfOUdaa	True.|`|w29tsXLUaa	Money does not bring happiness if you are playing your life around it and worrying about losing it. Then it is dominating you.<br>  <br>  It does bring comfort in old age if you need looking after. It will not buy you health or a cure for some illnesses.<br>  <br>  Obviously being very poor and you cannot even afford food is not the ideal way to live. <br>  <br>  My final answer: If everybody shared everything in this world, money, food and love we would all have contentment. Except that will never happen because human beings are greedy.|`|RGx530AUaa	Money can buy you the time and space and safety to work on making yourself happy with family, friends and loved ones. <br>  <br>  Not having enough money can consume your life and cause major unhappiness. I am not talking about enough to buy the latest ipod; I am talking about enough to pay your electric bill and to go to the doctor when you need to. To take care of the basics like food and gas and shelter.|`|BkatcMZbaa	Money cannot buy Happiness but can bring Happiness to you at time just to the doorway outside.......need to knock to come in.<br>  <br>  Money is the root of all evils and normally will bring in the good & the bad in life.

ngxw9waWaa	A mild form of psychosis creates the mental illusion of negativity giving rise to a feeling of being under threat or inferior. It is cured by self therapy. Instead of pursuing friendships in this time of self reproach and diminished self confidence, take time out to learn about yourself.  As always keep a journal, listen to music, feign being happy to activate the release of happy chemicals from the brain. You have the power to think yourself happy and in positive frame of mind. Learning to love oneself is the best example for others to hold a respect for you. Self enhancement is preferable to seeking of ingratiation from others. The most profound and interesting people I know are brilliant minds, or contented souls so self absorbed and satisfied they emit a radiant light alluring peace where so they roam. Take up philosophy, learn a skill to augment your self esteem. You will be fine.

HvtTKS4zaa	Is it you, Sweetie teeg ?  If so, I would very much like to get into contact. <br>  Altogether a very strong and assertive woman who knows her way (maybe in rejection of her parents′example), kind of a tomboy at heart possibly who expects her man to follow her and accept her guidance and leadership !<br>  This couild be my dream woman !  Because I love it when the wife or female partner is in charge, being head of the household, possibly (if she can provide for us) with her as the main or sole breadwinner, and me taking over the housework completely. And I would probably put up with those mentioned "negative" character traits. They somehow belong to the profile if somebody is wearing the pants. If she likes to be centre of attention, perhaps I could be proud of her ?<br>  And what about marriage and kids if the husband would agree to stay at home, raising the children, and taking her last name at the wedding ceremony ?

Because she would simply not be in charge.<br>  <br>  And with the attention addiction coupled with control issues...  I imagine she's got some self esteem problems that she'd never admit to or address.  A constant need for external validation is a sign of some really bad issues.<br>  <br>  If she's hot and doesn't annoy me too much, I'd be up for a couple weeks of crazy sex.  But long term...  no way.  I'd rather stab my eyes and ears out.|`|1d627596e14caafeacfad98d799d9a7caa	The positives sound awesome! But the loud and bossy ruins it. Can't put up with that. Nobody can. Except spineless morons who become DV victims/perps.<br>  <br>  Is there some reason you need to be bossy? Would you even respect a man who lets you boss him around? <br>  <br>  BTW - feminist is hardly neutral. It seems to go along with the loud and bossy. In fact, maybe that is just what loud and bossy women call themselves because they think it is more sophisticated and less nasty. But if you think your feminism is actually neutral, I recommend taking it off your list. No man, no matter what they tell you, finds feminism appealing.

Never judge a book by it's cover and always be weary of the so called 'nice' ones.|`|E70A7aqcaa	It's very simple.  Whether you're "in love" or actually love someone, you expose your innermost sensitivities to that person, trusting that they will keep good care of them, which is IMPOSSIBLE for anyone to do, so, you set yourself up for pain, as well as very good feelings.  That's life.  Sometimes we need to pay more attention to who we "love", and realize that "falling in love" is NOT loving someone.  God Bless you.|`|z60J0Z9Daa	Only the people you really love do you open up enough to be hurt.<br>  <br>  But dont make yourself a fool over it, sometimes it's simply time to move on.|`|S2vI4VEXaa	Leave him, you can do better.<br>  Good luck.|`|f6f40965eb7d5df6aa94440ec71e32dcaa	Because the ones we love know us the best, so they know where to hurt us.
XCBXIBiHaa	junior year,I thought you were 15?      I am taking psychology next year.In my opinion,it's better than sociology.You can screw around with other people's brains an analyze their behaviors(but only if you are smart:)|`|3N2ElzcQaa	Psychology    Its really good to understand how people think sometimes.|`|2jxWrnUGaa	Psychology! Super fun!! You get to learn about individual people and such.. it's fun and cool...well 2 me lol ^_^    have fun in either one you choose!! =D|`|vWo8EPAYaa	Psychology. I think one should try to understand people as individuals before going onto groups. You can probably take sociology your senior year.|`|3i1vAIBFaa	i'm taking both now|`|voqMhKAiaa	Take Psychology first. It'll probably help with Sociology later on.|`|VmXq5NCOaa	Psychology|`|dDHz4HZAaa	Psychology.  Sociology isn't really in high demeand anywhere, and there will always be people who need someone to understand how they feel. Plus, its a cool subject.
9q7MZUpeaa	What an awesome question!    I really believe that I am capable of falling in love with myself... I wish all the time that I had a twin or a clone of me to have sex with. LOL I don't think I'm that crazy because people I'm close to have also shard the same feeling with me. I literally would be my perfect partner!   (I'm not perfect, I just don't have a problem with my bad qualities)    So yeah I really do wish I could meet me, and I'm not gay.|`|y7ZAnmPUaa	hmmm. that would be fun! interesting!|`|u8IUPlECaa	Might get boring, but it would never be awkward! x)|`|lW2W1ApBaa	Yes|`|Pdex43zgaa	Some people do this already.

cBKpDtWNaa	I seeing this now the 2nd time......  why do wanting to know this so much ?  I thinking you must knowing by now that girls do...! but don't wanting to talk about such private things the same as boy like too.    Katie.
bO2rzfISaa	Call her at night and tell her to shut the door.|`|RFTzEc5Jaa	you can try many things:<br>  maybe you can invite her to the trip if you think it will be okay with ur friends and if she is willing 2 go<br>  you can call her whenever you have an anxiety<br>  if you think you living her may keep you from having a good time, thre's no point in going. <br>  hope this helps :-)|`|5YxNGfd4aa	Hi there....<br>  <br>  My opinion is for you to sit down with your mother and have a really good talk to her about this situation you're in. <br>  She will understand that you need to have your own life also now that you're getting older and im sure if you spoke to her openly then she'll accept that her little girl is growing up.  <br>  You do need to be able to do things and have a social life. From what i've read sounds like you've really had a lot on your plate for quite some time. Your mum is the parent so maybe its time to start giving her that responsibility again. <br>  You need to leave the guilt behind and enjoy yourself while you still can. ( before you start to settle down in life with hubby and family). <br>  If you're unable to rid of the guilt feeling then i highly recommend making an appointment with a psychologist to get help with this. I saw one when i was having a really hard time with everything and now i feel im on the straight and narrow thanx to her. <br>  I wish you all the best of luck with it!!<br>  Take care.<br>  xx
72GOhb9eaa	happyhappyhappyHAPPY!|`|aBqJhdufaa	I'm sorta down right now :(    Why are you happy? That would probably cheer me up lol|`|agpCn6Kaaa	I'm not a happy person, but I wouldn't consider myself unhappy either...I just tend to keep my feet on the ground and focus on reality.  If I don't expect much, then I won't be disappointed--this help me to stay on an even keel with things.  Enjoy your happiness, though.|`|Yz1pzloSaa	I am unhappy because I am too shy. -_-|`|N0fCDn33aa	You suck.    I hope you soon become unhappy.
sK73UzbUaa	yep... it feels good sometimes when you could control your dreams..  i had experienced flying too...it was awesome.. haha...  dunno how long i stayed... but sometimes...i want to stay longer...|`|dCUOdbEbaa	I had a dream where i was yelling " Get me out of this dream! " at the top of my lungs. Then I started pinching myself. There was a tornado coming in my dream so I was trying to wake me up in my dream... it was strange.. It felt like 2 minutes but it was probably 8 hours|`|2k8TEiRtaa	I was once dreaming that I couldn't sleep. I'm serious. I had to go to work the next day. And it was a bad day for me. To say the least.
xogws8vMaa	When I dress fancy, I have a higher, better attitude and my abilities skyrocket but when I dress like a slob I feel sick and gross
aPxmZq00aa	Well you just don't have to say or show everything that comes into your mind. Sometimes you just try to stay quiet rather than make a fool of yourself.  And also, if everyone annoys you, maybe its about you, something you don't like about yourself, because if you truly like most people and feel good about yourself, you will find far fewer people who seem to rub you the wrong way, so to speakk.|`|DxohE884aa	Um, try to remember the good in them.  (Actually, I'm pretty negative too - maybe you shouldn't take advice from me.)  Good luck! I'm sure you're a great person overall!|`|trMsK86jaa	You're annoying, Stop being annoying.
NWFpvM9Gaa	Sometimes you just gotta talk to something that'll listen.  As long you're not doing it incessantly I wouldn't worry, everybody has their own little secret|`|WV36m31Zaa	you ever hear of Wilson ???|`|agpCn6Kaaa	Having conversations with inanimate objects is odd, and not really normal.  It suggests an infantile response to stress that would be considered normal if you were say, a small child under age 3.  But an adult doing this is a little disturbing.|`|eocYAzeraa	only if it talks back are you crazy.   so stop talking to it, cuz sooner of later it will....
bbf1ccedee90968c8671f9573ff1c7c0aa	Well actually I don't think it's wierd at all, especcially if you don't have a pet. Most people, some don't even realise it, talk to their pet about problems or when they are sad. The pet is unresponsive or comforting. They aren't insulting or judge you. They don't hate you. This can be the case with your blanket. I don't think it's weird exactly but perhaps a little misplaced or unhealthy. Try talking to a diary or journal, or a to a pet or friend. Just make sure your not just talking to your blanket is what I mean. Learn to express it in other ways, to a person animal or to paper or even drawing.     And it's very normal for people to talk to themselves. And it is a very healthy thing to do in terms of brain development as you learn to think/talk things over and reflect on things. Talking to yourself can also improve your concentration when you are doing something challenging.|`|qDfeByQ1aa	Yes, well only weird if other people see you doing it.|`|fGe968rZaa	lol, sorry i found that pretty sad, but anyways. Well maybe you just grew up with it and have been attached to it your whole life. no offence BTW|`|Sm9cq8KKaa	No, it's not weird. Just don't become obsessive with it. I still talk to my dolls/top childhood stuffed animals when I'm upset...and sometimes when i'm not. I am 14 by the way, in case you were wondering...|`|vvrxSFEoaa	Well it depends how you talk to yourself.. most ppl do that too but they just like mumble what they are thinking... and the bear thing is wierd.... just saying :D.... but its ok... everybody has wierd things they do! you are one of many!|`|qbpTytC6aa	I used to ask my teddy bear for advice, but I don't anymore because he gave me some really bad investment tips and I will never, ever trust his judgement again.  And I told him so. in no uncertain terms. And the bear just laughed at me.|`|vKFhmrQUaa	uh just a little but if it helps you go ahead weird is not a real thing all of us do weird stuff
6k8GJBRPaa	Maybe you can add a link to your other question? :-)
H7kmp0qdaa	There is definitely more to life than what you are told and taught to believe. Truth, as we know it, is 100% relative to one's culture and personal experiences. As you mentioned- ego, social status, and religion all shape the way we look and evaluate things. Therefore there is no one absolute truth because no two people live and experience the same exact life which shapes the belief system. Great question.|`|trMsK86jaa	I tend to follow the people around me while questioning the judgment of the leader, like a true individualist looking out for other individuals within the group who may not be capable of doing so themselves for whatever reason.    This does essentially mean that if the leader does something i do not agree with, i would have to challenge that leader.    This would also apply if the group was acting under a shared directive - it would be the case i would be willing to challenge even a democratic verdict as to the goals of the group if i thought it was wrong, or reckless enough to be called suicidal.    This is a sad, unavoidable fact that a "person" exposes themselves to when involved in a group.|`|g2xlxZEZaa	people will judge on your looks its a fact . but getting over that is the first step to free thinking.
AA11780840	A. Money  because it gets you your primary reinforcer such as buying food such as a bar of candy  <br>  ADDED:or a bottle of water. Warm physical contact is also a primary reinforcer,|`|sYcyQUH9aa	Money, which is also called a generalized reinforcer.
b2952b6264919c4d0478fc6d9b014e95aa	There is medication that can help with this but you should discuss it with your physician and they will probably refer you to a psychiatrist. Do not let this go unaddressed it can get worse and could cause many problems for you.  There is treatment, you just need to talk to the right people.|`|aZXnW6AUaa	You need to get therapy.|`|7gH7sgi6aa	You need to seek therapy.  There is help for this type of thing.  The bad thing is that left untreated that sometimes that "voices" can deprive you of sleep and can cause some other problems in your life.  I would truly recommend that you seek the help of a therapist or tell your family physician and they will know where to direct you.  Good luck.<br>  Peace, Love & Happiness
3i1vAIBFaa	i think this dream symbolizes you and your relationship with your mother. I think the guy that was trying to rape you represents the cruel and evil world we live in. No matter who you call to help you nobody is going to care like a mom. You said you were driving her car. That may represent how you think you're in control and that your grown. But in actuality your mom is your back bone when something goes down. You said that you parked your car on an unknown road. That may represent how you are drifting apart from your mom or the foundation you were raised on. You found yourself lost and confused. Have you talked to your mother recently? Has she been there for you when you needed her the most? Do you miss her any? i believe most, not all, dreams have some kind of meanings. Especially dreams you can fully remember like this one. If I were you, I would go back to your mom and spend time with her. Don't be so rapped up into your own life because at the end of the day nobody is going to care about you like your mom. Also i think the text message represents how people will lead you down the wrong path, even if they sound convincing. Be careful of who you trust or who you let influence you. they could lead you down the wrong path and you may end up on a road that you don't want to be on|`|YPtNr2O6aa	I wouldn't worry about it - you could get a hundred people to interpret the dream and each interpretation will be different. I follow the idea that dreams aren't meaningful and are just the brains way of filtering out unnecessary memories and information during the REM stage of the sleep cycle (which people dont usually wake from and so don't usually remember dreaming at all) - so it could be linked with something you've read or seen in the news etc.    However, if you want to go all freudian about it then there's a lot there that could be interpreted - but as it's freudian its not best to post it publicly (that and it's really all a load of old tosh and nonsense, as i said - anyone can interpret the so-called 'symbols' in the dream as whatever they like) .|`|v1QIWugFaa	i have problems lik this all the time..... well since u said u had a weird feeling im very in to the paranormal stuff and i think that something might be trying to warn u about something|`|Kiu36eNjaa	I think it means that you are afraid of something (like a relationship or friendship or something else) ending. You think that nobody is going to comfort you in your time of need. OR something has already ended or is going to end. Or maybe you want to end something in your life but you're scared to because of some circumstances.  OR you're afraid to make a change because you think somebody won't support it.     I'm not a professional but ii know  that when you die in a dream something in your life is going to end (not necessarily a life)|`|Uyo1W3p4aa	Have you recently seen a movie, or anything tying in with your dream?    The mind works in mysterious ways. I have had weird dreams, and I'm sure others have as well.    Except, my dreams were disrupted before they ended.    (This probably didn't help you at all, sorry for the random rambling)    I hope someone answers more accurately.|`|UgoSQZLUaa	THE GUY ABOVE SOUDNS SO RIGHT, I THINK HE DESERVES BEST ANSWER!!!!|`|ifa5GYeKaa	Maybe this means something is going to happen to you. But it could also mean it was just a dream. My sister has weird dreams related to that all the time and ends up laughing in the morning. It probobly was just a dream and nothing will happen. Hope this helps!|`|oELUYx4laa	It just means your stressed.  Just try to add an hour of relaxaion to you day by watching tv, writing in a journal, running, or anything else that can help you feel less distracted|`|ZM7afRbxaa	whoh thats really weird but im not really good wit dreams but you can go to this website called dreammoods.com
7gH7sgi6aa	Honestly they do this quite often.  My Son was in a horrific car accident in 2007 where 4 out of 6 people died and he had a 1% chance of living.  They put him in the same type of coma because they had to remove a piece of his brain because he had so much head trauma.  Almost every bone in his body was broken.  He had 37 surgeries and is still having surgeries today and still has a trachea in his throat.  BUT..he is alive and walking.<br>  Pray.  Look to God and pray.  Pray hard.  Remember that it is in God's hands.  I will pray for your Brother as will.<br>  Stand by your Mother and your family as you all need one another.  God bless you all.  Good luck.<br>  Peace, Love & Happiness|`|E2xG6bpnaa	Dear sis,<br>  <br>      I don't know how your brother is going to be and I can't tell you how well he will recover.  I know this because I was in a bad car wreck in '89 and in a coma for 61/2 weeks.  Something that is very common to hear is every head injury is different.  I can tell you this a strong support system plays a big role in how well he will recover.  Yes I would think there is a possibility of your brother dying... I don't know the details.
tYTfT5Hjaa	when i was like 15 years old, this person asked me if i would rape a really hot girl if there was absolutely no consequences, i said i still would not rape her<br>  <br>  everyone else said they would rape her..... it was weird.... but that was way back then<br>  <br>  one man can never speak for all men.... EVER|`|lqI8QZ9Eaa	This guy is very confused. If rape was legal and someone raped his mom, would the rapist get away with it? Hell no. Everybody hates rapists, except other rapists. Who gets the worst time from other men in prison? Rapists, especially pedophiles.<br>  <br>  Feminists often overlook the fact that there are many more men who are protective of women than are violent to women.|`|9nUIe1Cgaa	rape would grow a lot. mainly because there are a good many guys who already do nothing but try to get on girls. so if it was legal they would simply skip the "forceful" flirting...from what I have seen in high school is that "those" guys just keep pushing up on girls until girls get frustrated and are forced to stop it, but if girls were not allowed to stop it, they guy would simply take what he wanted if the girl didnt give it|`|61AjTvw7aa	Rape probably would increase but so would murder. Men typically don't like it when their family members or their girlfriends get raped. Pisses them off, they probably won't stick to punching their bedroom walls or their dogs. Blood would be flying left and right. After all, I imagine that if rape was legal murder would be also.|`|6qPTQDdZaa	I really think it's a troll more than anything, but if it's someone serious, he's talking about a small number of men at the most who are like this.|`|Htccp0O2aa	Depends, most guys are good and will not do anything, but then there are @$$holes that will cause problems for the rest of us.|`|ZYp1AEspaa	Well,  my sons (ages 20 and 21) read this and their first reaction was "ok Abdullah, whatever you say... now go away."|`|0d183ab8af4fe4c2164d74294bd981adaa	If shoplifting only received a slap on the wrist, im sure many women would be running as fast as they could towards those "Five Finger Discounts". Human beings are forced to abide by certain civil codes, if you've noticed, many people both male and female, love to come online and act in a way they would never dream of acting in their real lives.|`|A71Uu05Uaa	If it were simply not illegal.  I imagine it would happen slightly more.<br>  <br>  Now, if it were socially accepted and just the way things are done.  Well, it would probably happen a lot because nobody would have been taught that it was bad.  Though, guys would probably carry condoms around wherever they do due to the higher risk of STDs.|`|1d627596e14caafeacfad98d799d9a7caa	It makes me sick and I'd dismiss anyone who suggested that. Feminists are paranoid about men and rape it seems. I knew one who thought the advice of taking a cab home from school didn't help her out because...what if the cabbie is male! Oh no!!<br>  <br>  The feminists had a saying they'd preach when I was in university: All men are potential rapists. I don't know if they know a thing at all about men.<br>  <br>  Anyway, I think the comment is feminist and paranoid and not based in reality.|`|wgZVeLZPaa	I'm not a man, but I am offended by this. It's absolutely awful! <br>  <br>  I'm so angry and frustrated. I cannot believe any man would think that he is entitled to sex, no matter what. <br>  <br>  Rape is illegal and wrong. By this logic, you should take everything from everyone because you feel entitled to it, whether you earned it or not.|`|f6f40965eb7d5df6aa94440ec71e32dcaa	"A lot of feminists would not debate this with logic."<br>  <br>  Not this feminist.

H7kmp0qdaa	It won't matter what high school classes you take the first two years. But take AP classes junior and senior year so you can get a head start on college because counseling psych takes at least 6-8 yeas of college.|`|f5L3e2rkaa	Just take as many advanced and challenging classes that you can in 9th grade. During junior year you can probably start taking some courses more focused on psychology.|`|YLsPYyi9aa	science and math would help English too|`|RnkOEzGuaa	It's really hard to start choosing Psych classes in high school just cause very few are offered. In high school you mostly take your required courses and possibly an elective. All I can say is that at my high school there was only one psych course and that's the same at a lot of my friends schools.     My only advice is to just take whatever psych class your school offers and take biology. If possible take Neuroscience cause that is basically all brain stuff.|`|vWo8EPAYaa	It doesn't really matter what you take in high school to be completely honest. They just make you retake everything anyway, even Algebra.     Check if the school you'll be attending next year offers Psychology. I'd advise you to take AP Psych, but I doubt they'll give it to you since you'll only be a freshman next year. Take chemistry and biology. You have to know chemicals to be a psychologist because the body is made up of chemicals and sometimes depression is caused by a chemical imbalance, which you have to detect as a psychologist.|`|eI0IUHQ2aa	Doesn't matter as long as you take college prep stuff like College Algebra and preferably foreign language    Most colleges cost $900 per CLASS so take as much of that stuff in hs where it's free|`|HypqcnJaaa	Don't worry you'll change your mind by then.|`|0PVp8Okoaa	you're only 8th grade so you have plenty of time.   what you want to do is to do really nail your sciences.|`|wMJYscXtaa	psychology. im taking it right now and im a freshman.

iUzSlmSbaa	Well, if this guy has known for over one year that you like him and you talked to him once and never again, then his looking in your direction didn't mean anything, because if he was interested, he would by now long since have approached you and talked to you again, many times since, as he never did talk to you again even if he knows from others that you like him and he did not smile at you when he was looking, I would forget him and move on and not theorize what he may have tought, he was just looking in that direction, maybe he remembered that his friend told him a year ago you liked him but if he cared he would have walked over to you and said ''Hi'' and talked to you instead of staring.. and a year has passed, so just move on and find another boy who will like you and show it.. and not ignore you.. he is not worth waiting for, this guy, also not worth analyzing why he's looking. As there is no reason behind it, he will never walk up to you and talk to you so just let it go ! xx<br>  <br>  If you and he talked in the past.. even if it's a long time ago.. and if he happens to look in your direction again.. with a blank expression.. smile at him.. there is nothing to lose for you,, either he will return your smile.. that means he likes you. If he acts as if you were invisible and doesn't smile back and turns away from you.. I believe that is a clear message that he is not interested.. then let it go.. but you lose nothing by smiling if he looks in your direction..so instead of asking yourself what he may or may not be thinking.. should he look in your direction again.. give him a smile and see how he reacts to that..that will be your answer then.. if he smiles back..  there is a chance you two will talk again.. if he ignores you.. then he clearly isn't interested and you should move on and forget about this guy..|`|Fx9nJ6mPaa	HOW OLD ARE YOU!!!

I realized I had to do something cause I was clenching my jaw a lot, which has been causing me jaw problems.     I don't know if that will work for you. For me, punching pillows never worked at all, but this stuff was different. You could try it. I don't know.

AA11202333	I am from Hawaii originally...  Sara & I here in Thailand give something away every single day to someone in need...   Pay-It-Forward concept...  For us it's Food a drink & a few bucks to all the homeless we can find on that day...    A friend back in the 70's shared a story of how his family did that and years later he discovered that his current employer that was paying him twice what he was worth had previously years earlier been one of his parents homeless...    We do this practice everyday and some days we really don't have the ability to do it but we do it and the results are very fulfilling...    We do not do it for any other reason other than it feels so right and is a great thing to practice...    Keeps us focused on others not just our selves....

Too much debt is what's causing the current economic problems.      Some debt is okay, when you can easily repay it.  Because money simply changes hands between people and organizations.  But too much debt where many people cannot repay their debts causes a lot of harm to the economy.  Because both borrowers and lenders loose in this kind of situation.  And there is no benefit to anyone.    There is not much you can do as an individual.  But you might want to get elected into government in order to change the government rules and regulations which encourage too much borrowing in the private sector.  And which do nothing to prevent the debts from getting too large.

NYU37jfGaa	Class has always determined much of everyone's experience.<br>  <br>  It would help if you said what particular period you are thinking of, but generally throughout history most European women would expect to marry and manage a household.  Depending on their class, this might mean managing a large estate, or helping to run a family business, or a small farm.  Whatever it was, she would be kept very busy.<br>  <br>  Whatever her class she would be bearing and raising children, and in past times women often had quite large families, so that would take up a lot of her time.  However, an upper class woman would normally have nurses to care for the children.  Lower class parents would expect their children to make themselves useful on the family farm or in the family business as soon as they were old enough.<br>  <br>  In Catholic countries, upper class and middle class women had the optino f becoming nuns rather than marrying.  Lower class women might remain unmarried but would be working for a living either in domestic service or in the textile trade or various other trades.|`|XIbct4fuaa	Rephrase your question so it makes sense and then type it in at google.com.

For those who experience anxiety in social settings, it might help relax them.<br>  <br>  The problem is there's a huge range of behavoirs in autistic adults, sober or drunk. Some might forget themselves enough to go back to, in public, their strange behavoiurs (rocking, humming, waving fingers in front of their eyes, etc), they need to be conciously aware of social rules so they might actually start acting even stranger (not age appropriate, not socially appropriate, because they are forgetting imposed inhibitions they have had to learn to make up for not knowing the rules in the first place...)
Cdkd4oQ7aa	I used to have some of the same issues. Over the summer, when I was living with my parents and had more privacy, I would do push ups or pull ups in my room to burn off the rush and calm the fear. But I can't do that in public, so I have several methods now based on severity.    - stress ball: get a firm but still squeezy/jelly stress ball (i got mine at Staples). Just play with it and knead it around if the nervousness is mild, or squeeze it hard if you get really freaked out.  - gripper: like a grip master or something like it. Get one that you can close, and one you can't quite close yet. When you're freaking out, slam that thing shut. That one helps a lot.  - rubber bands: I got some asparagus rubber bands, and then pretty much ALL the time, I put one around the tips of my fingers and stretch it out, opening my fingers as much as I can. It keeps my mind occupied on a fixation rather than on being freaked out.    That's some stuff that worked for me that you could try. For me, it worked for stress, fear, and anger.|`|YPtNr2O6aa	You could try some simple relaxation techniques. There's one i remember that involves concentrating on your breathing - removing everything (as far as possible - best off with your eyes shut) from your mind and fixating on the feeling of the air passing through your nose - finding a natural breathing pattern and keeping that for as long as necessary.    might want to give it a go.
PRaEOK9Maa	First off since he's your boyfriend you should have the right find out what it is that's causing him to be depressed. Then try to comfort him through that by finding ways to get around it or fix whatever it is that's  hurting him.|`|lW2W1ApBaa	Yes.|`|ae3ecab489f9cbbdd2b51fb0492f64d3aa	You could start by encouraging him to get some help. Sometimes depression can be brought on by a physical problem. A hormone imbalance or other things. I would suggest he make an appointment with his doctor and be honest with the doctor about his feelings. There is little you can do for him because he needs to find out for himself why he is depressed. The only thing you can do is encourage him to talk about what is bothering him and suggesting help. I was married to a man for 12 years that went through depression on and off. It was horrible. He would always tell me that it wasn't me and that it was him and he could never tell me why he would get depressed. I felt helpless. We had two small children and they could not understand why he would push them away. I tried to get him to get help but he never would. I finally divorced him because I couldn't take it any more and I felt it was unfair to our children when he was like that with them. I remarried about 3 years later but he never remarried and he is still going through the depression on and off just like he did then and that was 28 years ago.|`|Zu2oVVhoaa	try to find out why hes depressed ... maybe try to massage him and help him relax! he seems to be stressed about something! if all else failed ...

AA10894849	You really are limited if you only have a bachelor's. You won't be unemployed forever, but you may not find the work you really want. This article tells you what you can do with a bachelor's in psychology, including human services, research, and advertising.  http://www.apa.org/ed/wanttobecome.html  Previous research indicates that only about 25% of psychology undergraduates end up working in a field closely related to psychology. This article explains other things you can do with a bachelors.  http://www.psichi.org/pubs/articles/arti...  I have held 3 jobs with my bachelor's in psychology. I worked as a counselor at an adolescent group home. After that group home went bankrupt, I moved and couldn't find work for 3 months and ended up doing temp work, doing inventory at a parts warehouse for a company that makes tire parts. Nothing motivates you to find work in your major like spending 8 hours a day counting ball bearings. I then worked 4 years in a mental health reintegration program with people diagnosed with serious mental illness (schizophrenia, bipolar).  My friends who also had their BA or BS in psychology worked as case managers, psych techs in hospitals, or in-home counselors for a very structured children's program.|`|s3IBrhZCaa	i can not think of any.|`|H7kmp0qdaa	depends what your concentration is in.

Kkxq4Tisaa	Its not possible to measure. Or at least with our tools today.    You can measure someones memory compared to someone who has really good memory, but a third person opinion is not available with our technology.    The brain holds many secrets and passageways that we as people have yet to understand, or even discover for that matter.    Memory is something extraordinary. Its like consciousness. We cannot pin point exactly where consciousness is held in the brain. We know its in the frontal cortex, and that memory is in the occipital lobe, but we cannot pin point the exact location, and therefore, cannot properly measure it.|`|uxwSd0KLaa	We are using only a small portion of our brain ; so its impossible that any human brain is to full|`|AoLS7XXTaa	nope, you know we only use about 1/3 - 1/2 of our brain everyday?    so you can store unlimited knowledge in your brain ^-^|`|ZhrL1Vszaa	No never|`|69YQw3Kwaa	i heard that humans don't even "fill up" their brain so i would guess no|`|82e3eb215485ac8bca5c7c3854ee30ecaa	Sure, your brain crashes and you go into a coma...there really is a point of overload, though.|`|asX2hxFXaa	It's not dumb.  It's actually true.    Studies have shown the memories are written chemical strands of data in your brain.  The more these memories are recalled, the more then are re-written so to speak and the firmer that memory becomes.    Memories that aren't recalled often get over-written...not completely, but like how dropping a string on a string will cover part of the first string...and so on.     This is when you forget certain elements of an overall memory...until somebody reminds you and it's restored.    The older you get, the more things you forget.  Not so much because of age alone, but because there is only so much space for "clear" memories, and eventually an old memory must go away to make room for another.|`|m3ThrbDMaa	I don't know...

It can hold a seemingly infinite amount of information. Eventually if you don't rehearse things into your memory you forget them. You remember key points in your life, but not what happened every single day of your life. So, no your brain doesn't get too full, but it also doesn't retain everything either.|`|ccccc3a7fff67561896e1cd6e04c515faa	I think it's a tricky thing to prove, because really, how could they test this? (And who'd volunteer if they did?)  Certainly an excess of stimuli at any given time can make some negative reaction, but it's something one usually will recover from.

Some people have a better capacity than others. In those who are autistic with an ability toward memory, you can sometimes see differences in brain structure. People who can recall every detail of their lives were discussed in an article linked on Yahoo!'s home page recently. That woman had enlarged areas of her brain that allowed for her to do this. I myself have been claimed to have a photographic memory. I can look down at a page of text, and recall every detail of what was written.     Heh, i use it to pass tests without having any clue about the subject after.
s9IfcZrqaa	I've had many lucid dreams but never heard about numbrs staying the same.  I have been able to "control" elements of my dream esp. if I knew i was dreaming...perhaps you wanted to test the theory and see if you could make the clock stay the same.  And it seems you did.  Could it be that the numbers mean something to you?Or a  "2 for 1"? Or maybe it was just the approximate time you were dreaming? Everyone's dream symbols are different, depending upon what they mean to you.|`|HsCHz0kyaa	omg. i love lucid dreaming.  i remember once i was going to skip school the next day.  but in my dream, i was going to school and i was at my math class. so i thoought, no i was suppose to stay home. then i realized i was dreaming, so i was like ohhh. so then i was just messing around inside my dream. like getting at the teacher and stuff. it was funn.  but the time thing, iunno, a lot of people here always take things about dreams in a high porportion, i wouldn't worry about it.|`|H7kmp0qdaa	I agree with fran. It's all relative to what's going on in your own brain. It could very well be that you purposely checked the time again to validate it. 12:41 is such an odd time. I love lucid dreaming! I had a very cool one last night that seemed like hours of interaction with some people in my life. I had so much fun and did so many things I wish I could. Now it's making these dreams reality that I need to work on :)|`|4ab38ec731e80d691e84709d4c8ef036aa	AS funny as it sounds, you were either just dreaming about lucidity or in a surrounding so real you wouldn't let yourself believe it was lucid. I've been trying for lucidity too and i had a dream where i thought i was lucid but i didn't do anything because i was afraid i was actually awake. Just keep trying and you'll be sure to get it eventually. Also try other reality tests like biting your tongue when something seems unbelievable in real life so your more likely to do it in the dream. Biting my tongue is something i do a lot during the day now, and its made me aware of a LOT of lucid dreams.
CvBJ3RKPaa	The "economic package" is a 950 Billion dollar collection of spending measures allegedly designed to stimulate the economy.  IMO, it's actually a collection of pork-barel projects and very little of it will actually create jobs.  However, it will probably pass because Obama is on his Honeymoon, and Dems control the Congress.  It has already passed the House and only needs two Republican votes to pass the Senate.  Where does the money come from?  The Govt. is printing it as fast as they can.  That's why, when this current deflationary period is over, we'll see hyper-inflation.|`|ZOXoPgJbaa	Most of it will be borrowed or just printed, also called monetizing the debt, which is just a fancy way of inflating the money supply.

And then I decide to do something else.  And then something else  Before I know it, its ten o'clock at night and I still have homework to finish and running to do.

Go to a doctor not yahoo for answers.|`|SEL1cjHtaa	I've seen a viable answer for self injury to be putting a rubberband on your wrist, and snapping it when you want to cut.  This helps produce the endorphins you seek when you injure yourself.

The strangeness of dreams is due to the format of long-term memory, reminiscent of Penfield and Rasmussens findings that electrical excitations of the cortex give rise to experiences similar to dreams. During waking life an executive function interprets long term memory consistent with reality checking. Tarnow's theory is a reworking of Freud's theory of dreams in which Freud's unconscious is replaced with the long-term memory system and Freud's Dream Work describes the structure of long-term memory.
RsenWiWfaa	Well, sociologically speaking, idk, but physiologically I think the sharpness of the gesture (straight lines, like your finger/arm when extended, are often perceived as "sharp") makes it offensive. It also singles the person out, and gets rid of the "safe" feeling most people feel when socially anonymous|`|0s190C7Zaa	I guess people are afraid of being singled out? Or perhaps that they don't wish to be pointed at. Some times its a culture thing you know.|`|ENilx3F2aa	Who wants to be pointed out? I don't. It makes you feel as if your being talked about.|`|AQlA6nu0aa	If you point at someone then it might mean you are talking stuff about them, or pointing something out about them that they might not like.

I like it when I dream of doing things I can't do in real life. We don't have control over it..|`|2LYvu6Utaa	Most dreams are just your subconscious dredging up things that have happened. If you do things in dreams that you never would in real life, that is your brain saying, "Hmm, I wonder what would happen if...?" The only types of dreams we really control are lucid dreams, in which we know we're dreaming, and start to take charge.
DpbZdIsUaa	If she has treated you badly and you decided to keep your distance from her, it is the best thing you could have done.  This girl will not care that you are keeping your distance.  She won't care what you think of her.  Just treat her the way you would like to be treated and if she doesn't get the message then walk away from her.  Don't let it bother you because it won't bother her.|`|CvBJ3RKPaa	You wrote, "Finally I could truthfully forgive her . . ."  But how can you forgive someone who isn't sorry for what they've done?  The same tendencies that made her rude to you are still there.  So bottom line: be civil, but not familiar with her.|`|HtHFHfDKaa	It seems like she is out to impress someone or maybe she feels somewhat insecure about herself. Whatever the reason all you can do is be a friend to her since she already has a bf if she tells you to back off or calls you a looser I would heed the advice and stay away. Anyway the scenarios you are describing almost sound like a scene out of the movies "Clueless" and "Mean Girls"  She may say she hears what you are saying but she is probably just ignoring you. TV media and the world in general has a certain perspective on how a woman should look, talk, dress, act, etc some women feel a need to look up to that image either in general or because of the high limitations their parents set.
987U0U8Gaa	The Federal Reserve Banking System uses three tools to fight recession:    1. Decreasing the required reserve ratio - (the required reserve ration is the percentage of total deposits that the Fed requires deposity institutions to hold in the form of vault cash or deposits to the Fed) By decreasing the required reserve ratio, banks are able to have more excess reserves which allows them to loan more money. These loans will increase the money supply and fight recession.    2. Buying bonds/securities - By buying securities, the Fed increases the money supply in order to fight recession.The Fed pays for these securities by crediting the reserve accounts of banks involved with the sale. With more money in these reserve accounts, banks have more money to lend, interest rates may fall, and consumer and business spending may increase, encouraging economic expansion.    3. Decreasing the discount rate- (the discount rate is the interest rate the Fed charges for reserves that it lends to depostiory institutions) decreasing the discount rate encorages depository institutions to take loans. This increases the money supply.    As you can see, increasing the money supply (esentially-causing inflation) is how the Fed can stimulate the economy --- (this is theory of course)     President Obama's new billion dollar stimulus package is essentially following the same principal of increasing the money supply. New jobs and money entering into the market will increase the money supply which will cause inflation, which is the goal!     The Republican standpoint is that tax cuts are the way to stimulate the economy (but with consumer confidence very low, it is hard to be sure people will not just put the tax cuts into the bank instead of into the economy).    I have not heard that the Fed is printing money to stimulate the economy and that may be an inaccurate statement. Above I listed the 3 tools that the Fed uses to fight recession and printing money is not one of them. Buying treasuries which is an open market operation which is explained above. Inflation will cause some problems but inflation is one of the ways out of a recession. Inflation can help some of the people who are having trouble paying off housing loans and others who cannot pay their loans for education or other items. An increased money supply makes those loans look smaller in comparission to other items.      I hope this helped! It is The Fed in a brief description.|`|JgFkmif9aa	Pretty good answer by Erica, all though I would disagree with one point in that putting money into the bank IS putting money into the economy.  In fact it is doing so to a greater expense because more money in banks results in an increase in the multiplier effect.|`|oNg8zGi8aa	The fed is buying the country with our money they charge us interest on .  The people are in deep Do Do .|`|8091157cce079beb55128deba743200caa	Yes it will! What the Fed. is doing is the equivalent of taking out a new credit card to pay off another credit card debt. If the pork barrel spending was cut out or if we stopped outsourcing manufacturing jobs then we could actually pull out of this.

Read aloud in your own room, try emphasizing the pitch of your voice, the volume of your voice and the calmness of your voice. Do it everyday. Two: Work on your breathing skills, take a few deep breaths before going up to relax yourself. Imagiine your whole body just shift into a deep state of relaxation Three: Imagine the class dressed up as clowns dressed in funny suits, enormously big glasses and rainbow wigs, or what it is that you find hilarious. Laughter relaxes you and puts the mind and body at ease and being at ease is what it is all about. Four: When your alone, meditate, just sit and go over in your mind what you want to say and how you want to say. Five: Have fun with it when your speaking aloud, don't be afraid to make mistakes. Even the best speakers make mistakes from time to time still. Act silly, even stupid at times and do it on purpose. Remember that everyone else feels the shaky voice at first too and also feels awkward, from time to time you still will. But the more often you do it, the easier it gets. Eventually it becomes second nature.
AhpS6XJnaa	Nightmares are a way of pumping adrenaline into your system, if you have a nightmare it means that your body has gone into a solid and deep state of sleep that is nearly life threatening that is why we have them, because our brain and nervous system needs to shock our respiratory system back into doing its job.  It is essential to have them.  The best thing to do to get your mind off a nightmare is to listen to some soothing music or natural sounds.|`|ifVqaPsxaa	you can just read a really happy and cheerful book before you go to bed and try not to think of it|`|AA12104815	now that you typed all that...do you feel better......  go back to sleep now.|`|sjCYYl9haa	its all a dream, think of something else... if its too much, don't drink anything that causes that.

8miMWB64aa	Depression is a vaguely defined thing.  And it's not a specific thing going on in your head.. it's kind of a catch-all emotional phenomena, since Psychology is as much an exact Science as an orange is an apple.    And, yes.  Depressions can be treated numerous ways, depending on what exactly it is.  Hell, they fix themselves most of the time.  In general, though identifying the emotional cause and fixing that do the trick if you're anxious to get through it.    Note:  People have to identify the REAL cause, not the "cause" that they think it is, the people around them think it is, or whatever they want it to be.  If fixing it doesn't work, it wasn't the problem.  (Obviously.)  For some people, figuring out the cause can be difficult because they believe themselves to be someone other than who they truly are (extremely common).|`|65653c6c063e99db1f7f272c5c93e006aa	My symptoms are sleeplessness at night, feeling tired, listless, and overwhelmed most of the time.    And I have to say Good for You on the desire not to use drugs to control it.  They work but put you on a level of indifference~a side effect much worse than the initial ailment in the long run.  And God help you if you try to stop taking them later!    My doctor said (a long time ago) that onions and garlic are very good deterrents and that strenuous exercise will alleviate the symptoms.  And the best part about the exercise is how your physical appearance  improves, not to mention your social life lol.|`|096b7gBHaa	depression is when you ended up clueless about life, spending most of the times being idled and feel hopeless about everything.     other than that, trust me; you'll get more help in Mental Health section.|`|5uEAHEQJaa	Losing the will to live; feeling like an outsider; not caring for items of possession nearly as much as you have done i the past.    You really need a doctor, it may be chemical imbalance.  However, you can first seek out a church and build yo a strong network of friends, that may help.|`|UOz1LPIHaa	To some extent, if you think you may be depressed without having to have someone hold a mirror up to what you're doing that actually doesn't make sense until you can actually see how this just isn't normal. . . you're probably not seriously depressed.  You may somewhat be, but the good news is that it's probably not so bad.  You may not even need meds.    Particularly in less-severe cases and where it's not clearly genetic, you can treat it fine without drugs.  All you may need is a good friend or counselor to help you through what's eating at you right now, and things will right themselves.  Talking about what's going on and how you're really feeling about what's going on is very good therapy, and they still even want you to do that when you're on medication.  All the drugs do is let you think halfway normally again so you *can* work out what the real issues are if there are some.  If you go through someone like a psychologist for a while first, they'll do what they can without meds and then refer you to a psychiatrist only it if seems like you might be stuck otherwise.    Symptoms can really vary.  Generally, it's not paying enough attention or just not getting enough of something you need to survive. . . that could be sleep, food, etc.  Those just aren't what you're thinking about right now -- it could be whatever else is going on that's currently upsetting you, and you're ignoring basic needs for extended periods.  You can sometimes feel vaguely happy, but it doesn't last and never feels quite as much fun as you think it's supposed to somewhere back in your memory.  (You may think. . . eh, but maybe that's just you can't remember correctly.)  Crying and overtly feeling down. . . maybe.  Maybe not, or maybe you just don't realize it.  You can hide anything you want to from the world and yourself if you feel like it and actually are depressed.    My advice would be to start talking with some friends who are around you and involved with similar sorts of daily activities.  Just talk about how you're feeling and how they're all feeling, and see if that makes you feel any better or not really.  Sometimes, all you really need is just knowing you're not the only one whose life quitely sucks right now to start feeling better.
YfJHliLWaa	It could mean that you are going through a life change presently but you are adjusting to it.|`|WuskPQ6Qaa	hm interesting it means nothing in my opinion though
AA10894849	Everyone dreams (blind people included) and in general, people's dream experience is similar to their waking experience. For those that were blind from birth, they do not have a lot of visual stimuli to draw on for their dreams, so they have dreams that are primarily auditory, tactile or even involve taste and smell. People who lose their sight very early (before age five) apparently experience no visual imagery in their dreams. Visual imagery is a variable for those who lose their sight between ages five and seven. People who lose their sight after age seven almost always have some level of visual imagery present in their dreams. They've done extensive studies and have also found that REM sleep is disturbed in blind people, so they may actually dream less.|`|ak44mIy3aa	good question, i am guessing since the only way they can Communicate with the outside world through all their senses with the exception of eyesight, then maybe they dream with sounds and "feelings" instead with images.|`|9fLLn2PFaa	Not if they were born that way.  If they became blind after their brains were developed the yes they probably do.  Their was something interesting on science channel they gave sight back to a blind guy but because he was born that way his brain didn;t understand shapes colors depth so all the information was like a foreign language.  good question you get a star.|`|YTvL7G4saa	As a young adult i work with a blind patient and we would have conversation. Just from that of which he told me i would say yes..  John was his name and i'd asked him what did he think the weather was like today and his response was it was sunny and warm...Every one has a imagination , as well as knowledge and life experiences.  So why wouldn't a blind person dream they still have the five other senses plus imagination so my opinion is yes of course they can see in their dreams...

cWxwHMQWaa	I'd be worried.    My ex was this way, he had friends, but he didn't feel close to them. Like he wouldn't even really open up to them about anything 'too deep'. I figured this was a result of his strict upbringing, so he wasn't allowed much time with friends.     Turned out, I think he preferred to just not get too close. Keep the 'wall' up sorta person.     It didn't work well for me, and he had huge relationship issues over all, with women especially.     In short, I'd be pretty skeptical and likely not get into anything romantic with someone like this. In the teen years I think it's normal not to have been in a serious relationship, so this won't apply there, but at my age, it'd definitely smack of personal issues that may be more than I'm willing to handle and work through to be with him.|`|S2vI4VEXaa	My husband and I were teenagers when we started dating, we were each other's first romantic relationship.|`|AA11447210	Probably less likely...but then I'm 44 and tend to date mid 30s and up so someone at that point in life who has never had a romantic relationship or has no close friendships would raise a big ol' red flag with me.|`|62ZBofvPaa	Mmm...maybe a little less likely.

No more scary eyes.|`|Y2bpoU4Uaa	that doesn't sound like a phobia  it sounds like a pretty solid thing to be freaked out by|`|zr7w5pDbaa	Well part of being human is just that you're gonna have to be afraid of somethings.|`|NZGyJIZeaa	There may not be a way to get over it. but it is a whole mind over matter thing, being as if you think about it think of why and how it bothers you. then try and control your mind to thinking that It's not going to happen to you, or that what you see in the movies isn't always real. I hope you get over this and I'm not sure that my answer helps in anyways. but good luck with your phobia.|`|hJ08mpk1aa	it has been said that the eyes are the mirror to the soul.Is it that when the eyes are gone so is the soul? They are just movies some thing for entertainment.I enjoy horror movies, but come up ways of defeating the attacker. So come up with a way of surviving without your eyes.|`|cFPQVavVaa	just don't look at the eyes|`|f38b3ba8ee6fe6a37654c84a1d5ac013aa	hahah i was like that. It still bothers me, just not as much. Um.. Once i just started poking my eye while it was still open to show myself its ok for it to be poked. Ok that sounds wrong but just realize it's ok to not like getting poked in the eye and you'll be fine. Not an unhealthy fear.|`|NWFpvM9Gaa	Why would you want to? It's perfectly normal to not want to see peoples' eyes get gashed out. But the only wayto get over a fear is to face it head on, so my suggestion would be watch it, no turning away    PS: Horror movies are supposed to be scary|`|lJO1xbg6aa	Ugh, that freaks me out too!  I still watch the movie but if I know a part like that is coming then I'll look away till it's over.|`|WrmeB8zEaa	umm probably the only way to get rid of that it to think really hard about how it's fake like sometimes when I get scared by a movie, I concentrate really hard on what is obviously ketchup or whatever. I have that too but instead of eyes it's necks for me. 0.0
NZGyJIZeaa	Your mind becomes curious and even though you may not have understood things about sex and such when you were younger your mind will slowly pickup and learn more information as you go along in your life. you may or may not have forgotten about the nude drawings, it depends on whatever it was that triggered your memory to have you start drawing the pics in the first place. It doesn't mean you were a perverted kid, or that there was something wrong with you. anyways I hope you sort this out or whatever you trying to know.|`|wdvUNvz6aa	wow umm that is a little strange?
GAxHzgEEaa	Im not sure if your asking how do I personally expres my anger or how should some express it.    but anyways i would personally express my anger by putting glass in a bag and smashing it with a hammer.    another way is to get in a car and scream as loud as you can and curse   because no one can hear you really    my favorite is to pay to go to this place where you can bang up cars and smash in their windows for about 20 bucks    but one that people suggest the most is by venting.  like writing in a diary, writing a song, i like to make videos, you can also write a hate letter to the person that your angry at but never send it. when your done you just shread it. it helps sometimes    hope my advice helps|`|6aVtiTKiaa	Different ways.  I'll cry sometimes, but that usually makes me angrier. (I hate to cry)  I'm usually confrontational.  If that's not possible and I have someone that will listen I'll vent.  I get over it more quickly that way.|`|3G3K35a3aa	heh :]  well i yell, cry, scream, and throw things.  usually bad words.  umm, sometimes i harm myself.  im so angry at other people, that it makes me angry at myself.  i occasionaly punch walls.  there are now a few in my room.  my parents hate it :)|`|Xjjur378aa	-If I'm Mobile I Usually Turn Up the Music, Sing, And Drive Aggressively.    -If I'm At Home A Wall Or Pillow Usually gets clouted...

If im in a fight with my parents/sisters, I just yell at them/say whatever Im feeling. other that that, I dont do much.    oooh! and I sometimes get into physical fights with my twin sister too! thats real fun. its like WWE wrestling, but worse. and its real too.

UZ2nix6xaa	Really you can hide a lot of things in a laugh, but its best not to get suspicious.... she's probably just nervous about something or doesn't quite know how to react, and so the default is usually a small chuckle. In another case they could also be trying to ease tension, which laughter is known to do. It's probably better if you didn't think about it too much.|`|H7kmp0qdaa	Yes, laughter is a form of anxiety. And I laugh constantly even when things aren't that funny :( It's hard not to. Just be patient with her and try to make her comfortable.|`|b919231cdc9dcf8edee5a210e4d7a40faa	I'm currently working on my bio-psych doctorate and I have severe attention deficit disorder and obsessive compulsive disorder, this could be a couple of things really. People definitely laugh when they feel awkward or don't know what's expected of them, many times women laugh when they are being sexually harassed because of this, they don't want to be confrontational so they try to ignore what's happening and hope it stops; I don't mean to say this is the case with your situation I just wanted to put this out there.    As I mentioned I have severe ADD and I've noticed that I laugh for no particular reason when I'm not quite paying attention (or I might laugh if something funny comes to mind). I'm pretty sure that the reason I laugh for no particular reason is because it's a learned response, people just like animals, respond quickly to social conditioning and the laugh is something that is very unlikely to be interpreted negatively. Since people that have ADD have trouble following conversations a lot of times they have a tendency to subconsciously pick up habits that lead to greater social approval. For example, if I'm talking to my friend and she starts talking about something that really interests her, but not so much with me, I don't want to sit there with a blank expression on my face so I have a tendency to laugh or smile and look really interested, especially if she smiles or I get the feeling she's joking about something. I have pretty good accuracy with this, but definitely not as good as someone that pays really good attention, I've noticed that most people can't tell I'm doing this but some people are more perceptive. You sound like one of these people, the way you said your roommate was trying to make the situation better is exactly right if they do indeed have ADD. It could just be nervousness though, one way to tell is to hold hold eye-contact with the person for a few seconds and see if they look away.|`|ParFJxnSaa	Comedians are often depressed people, trying to make themselves feel better. She may be trying to appear amused, etc. in order to feel more acceptable to others, masking an inner lack of security, or trying to be popular, or at least, not rejected/blacklisted.|`|tMvHR1n3aa	it can be anthing (like nerves or unsureness or fakeness )its better not to overjudge it.|`|tNdYtp2daa	maybe she is just retarded|`|oiqgdopVaa	u never know until u ask her the truth.|`|7xkwE3X9aa	I sometimes do that out of nervousness.|`|qzgBqluRaa	sometimes it is because they don't want you to find something out or they are not as comfortable with you to tell the truth just yet. just give them some time and become better of friends and they should ease up!  :)|`|VKlIjfIXaa	Laughter masks fear of rejection or judgement, she just has low self confidence.
CvBJ3RKPaa	In general, guys don't like to talk about their "emotions/feelings," with people to whom they're not close -- so don't go there.  Talk about his interests, and build a friendship that way.  When he trusts you, he'll confide in you.  If he likes say, music, ask him about his favorite bands, style of music; if he's ever imagined being a musician. etc.  Then tell him your thoughts on the subject.|`|1b013cc3fe2d25b057fd14f52569f85caa	the 80s are gone    stop expecting men to "open up"    work on getting them to just GROW up|`|SlkKa1jsaa	just normal stuff,like what are we gonna do?what else is there,Im kind the same hah,|`|HsCHz0kyaa	where he came from  how he likes it here  what kind of car he drives[only if you know about cars]  sports  animals  family|`|2LYvu6Utaa	It's hard to take a shot in the dark at comfort level. Try asking about...I dunno...his best friend in elementary school. Or...ask him who his favourite cousin is. Something to do with how he relates to other people; he can't just give a yes or no, he has to elaborate. But it's still not going too deep. Hope that helps..|`|Id4aSqrPaa	start with asking him not to personal questions and asking him to elaborate (especially if he answers with short/quick answers). what kind of music do you like, what is your favorite restaurant, etc. then if u can get a flow of conversation and he sees your sincerely listening and engaged in what he is saying he may open up more. most guys dont talk because they get those girls who ask one question, let them answer with a short answer and then they answer it themselves in a long drawn out story. you convince him your interested and it will be an equal conversational relationship he may trust you with more info.
kBmy1joWaa	Well, yes, it is normal. When you realize that your first love and you won't be together, it is quiet a blow. This is one of those follow either your heart or head situations. If you love your partner more than your life, (which is what true love is) you shouldn't do anything, because you are obviously already happy. If this is just a fling, follow your heart! You won't be happy until you are with the one you love. I am young and have never experienced love. Therefore I cannot give you a personal account. But I am vigilant enough to see the world's true colors. I have seen the unconditional love a mother has for her child, and I know that without some kind of everlasting love, you will never be Truly happy.  God bless!

It wont' go away till you move on- either date this person or find a way to get her out of your mind.  Likely you are in a good relationship and shouldn't wreck it.  Crushes mess with your mind- the crush feeling I mean  So.....whether or not this younger crush is nice or not doesnot matter, your mind is "crushed" on her if you will.  So you have to perhaps talk to this crush and see if you really like her at all.......it should go away in time

There are very few things equal to seeing the look on a persons face that wants you and you get them riled up only to disappoint them. Once you've experienced that feeling it becomes very easy to understand why women torture men. They do it because it's fun.|`|qcDHyhdtaa	I don't lead men on. I find that women who do that are hmm what's a word that I can use..ok witches. Or, it could be you're reading her wrong.|`|Lyrc2BWmaa	Because they probably like you and then losse feelings for you or realize that they were wrong.    they dont set out to hurt you on purpose|`|096b7gBHaa	they expect more income with less outcome.    it's not really about money, but more to attention|`|Pa4cyKn7aa	Some women lead men on, but most don't in my opinion.

t1zlbOURaa	Let's say you sell hamburgers.    You could find REALLY hungry people in out of the way places and deliver hamburgers to them at $1000 each, and have $10 profit on them.    Or you could sell 10,000 hamburgers and make $1 profit each.    I pick the second model to get rich.    Yes it's an extreme example, but maximizing your per-unit profit shrinks your marketplace significantly.|`|Xnh2tmQlaa	Probably because that is all that matters.  For example if you can lure customers into the store by selling hamburger at cost but while they are there they buy lots of other stuff that has a high markup then you have made money.

Just try to erase the image from your head and not think about it anymore.

Seriously, don't worry about it. There is psychological evidence that this is not unusual. What is probably more psychologically dangerous is excessive guilt about an act which didn't actually harm anybody. If you were 20, then maybe there would be more cause for concern, but at 15, hormones tend to be very strong and even the slightest provocation can trigger sexual urges. If you have psycho-sexual problems, they would likely manifest themselves in many other ways and you would likely know that something was wrong. As it is, it seems like excessive guilt is probably going to be a bigger issue here than anything else.|`|eh8JpNCJaa	dose the name adipose says some thing to you    maybe its just that you didn't saw her naked before, in my house every one saw evey one naked, so we are used to each other from early age.  i bet you hardly see naked woman in your age, so i say it could be a normal reaction of a person who's have no sexual experience, its an un controlled physical reaction. as long as you don't have sexual thoughts about her and fantasies i would say, its normal.|`|A0TW9pVoaa	Maybe you are not used to seeing females naked if you haven't grown up around them or haven't seen your Mum like that before. I think a bit of curiosity is normal, not arousal. I would either forget about it ,and have a bit of self control in future, or see a counselor. You could ask your priest to help you pray about it and not actually mention what it is specifically. Althought if he is a spiritual man, you must remember he hears everbodys sins and he has prob heard alot worse!   We all feel weird or bad about some things at some point in our lives. All that matters now is how you react. If everybody's thought life was broadcast on tv I don't think ppl would be so quick to judge. It is not healthy for your mind to carry that burden or guilty thought on your shoulders. You don't even have to go through a priest, just pray to God yourself and ask for help and for the image to go. You need some peace, and guilt is not from God.  It sounds as if you are beating yourself up too and need to recieve some forgiveness. If you don't believe, then go and see a counselor and discuss your issues and don't let it bother you from then on.|`|ZDR1N6Q3aa	Look up the Oedipus complex.    It explains your situation kind of :)

If "Jason" is real, try to remember the surname that goes along with the name. And or, you could ask someone about it. If it really brings you closure that is. Dreams could also tell us something about hidden desires that we haven't fulfilled. Maybe, you have met "Jason" before, and his appearance in your dreams is probably telling you something. If he is real, and you meet him, then that is deja vu as what others say. I've had the experience twice already and it has happened (actually meeting the person). Don't worry you're not crazy.

533aec411376adde47ba86f66a0aa949aa	Believe it or not, the way in which you put limitations on your life while awake have significant consequences on your dreaming mind. some of this is stress relief (what you can't experience in real-life you experience in dreams, with no one the wiser,) some of it is metaphor (because this is a 'taboo' subject, it stands in for all those taboo feelings you can't deal with while awkake,) and some of it is simply hormonal curiosity (dream sex is about as safe a sex you can engage in, especially if you are very guilt-conscious and can't masturbate. Your mind basically hijacks your brain and 'engages' in the behavior without your approval. Since you were 'forced' to have the dream, you are still the innocent victim.)

For example, I think that most of feel relatively calm when thinking about our economic future and the state of the world that we live in.  But, one news story, talk show, or headline about more layoffs can send us into a full blown panic.  There's lots of stress in the world today and some days we handle it better than others.

7J6m0L3Haa	Many "feminists" here seem to be trolls being impersonated by anti-feminists. Or they just have no exposure to actual theoretical, political, or academic feminism and just parrot the consumerist feminism that is used to sell visions of ball-breaking harpies and exercise programs involving stripping.    On the flip-side though, pretending that actual systems of priviledge and subjection do not exist based on sex (among other things, like race and class for example) or telling people to "get over it" is just as ineffective and irrational. Feminism is still necessary and misogyny still thrives. What separates the man-haters from the misogynists on the board is that the hatred of men (which I see very little of here) results in very little discrimination against men in the real world. What systems that do exist that priviledge women above men are supported and sustained by misogynists (i.e. the "all women and children first" hero-type who thinks women are weak), not feminists. Whereas, the systems that suppress women thrive off identical misogynies to the ones expressed here, and they are far far more common and result in far far worse violations of justice, law, and decency.|`|cWxwHMQWaa	Yes, yes =o)|`|un0C52G8aa	It's because there are certain individuals who continually focus on the extremists and choose to ignore those with more mainstream ideas. They are the ones who continually harp on the now largely forgotten extremists like Valerie Solanis (I wonder how many of them know that she tried to kill artist Andy Warhol) and Andrea Dworkin.|`|fDGPbwdsaa	"You cannot blame an entire sex or gender for your personal issues in life. "    I'm with you on that - and that is why I don't blame an entire gender/sex for personal issues.    Feminism is a movement, a political hate group pushing for supremacy as demonstrated time and time again by the feminists in positions of power and/or influence.    Feminists can be male or female.    Yet feminists DO blame an entire gender/sex - men.      Try and locate a 'feminist study' that doesn't blame men for whatever the 'study' is about..      They are predictable as clockwork - man bad, woman good.|`|S2vI4VEXaa	This place is a riot!    About as much fun as a funeral in a hurricane sometimes, but other times it's like Mardi Gras.

Those fems complain about nothing just to get heard. Its a cry for attention that's all. Pay them no mind. They wonder why they don't have a man or attract men and us women who are not feminist attract men. Its simple, we know how to treat a man and a man knows how to treat us.|`|8miMWB64aa	In the real world, I've never met a woman who called herself a feminist who wasn't a man hater.  And I still remember all the hate literature when I was left at a bookstore to wait for a ride when I was little in the Woman's Literature section.  I actually found numerous books on both why men are genetically inferior and why men are horrible.  So, for someone who has had the life experiences I've had, it's hard to fathom that feminists aren't man haters.  I just have too much experience with directly meeting feminists who were.  It's sort of different on this board.. only about half of the feminists are sexist to the point of being offensive.    The problem with trying to accept or dismiss stereotypes is that, whichever you do, you're applying your own stereotype in assuming it works or doesn't.    Sometimes, you just have to accept that you just don't know.      PS-  After seeing Marx's post, I noticed I missed in the question: "You cannot blame an entire sex or gender for your personal issues in life. "    Absolutely.  Very few females are actually feminists.  Seriously.  If you go to a college right now and ask around, no more than 5% of females will say that they are, and most of them are "feminists" in the same respect that most Christians are "Christians"- they sorta roughly agree with the idealogy that they heard it was about, but they don't really know much about it.  (I say "college" since almost everyone I know is in college.  In theory, it could be different for older generations who remember a time when "feminism" was something else.)    In short, disliking feminists does NOT equal disliking women.|`|qcDHyhdtaa	aye!|`|InkQ02Qvaa	Yes. I get so mad sometimes when I try to actually answer someone's question, and they just label me as whatever. I try so hard to post unbiased statements, and keep an open mind. I've found flaws in myself by answering questions. But so many people refuse to consider other views or to self examine. They are staunch in their flawed opinions and are just looking for people to agree with them.

If a decision is easy for a person, it means they are pretty certain of what they want to do or what the "correct" answer is.  They don't have to think about it too much, it may seem like they are "trusting their instincts."  If a decision is more difficult, this means the person doesn't know the right answer and needs to think about it a bit more.  If you don't know the answer, you are more likely to be wrong.  Thus, it would seem like being more deliberate results in worse decision making.|`|K4GiKOhPaa	My gut has rarely let me down.|`|vVrvdSM6aa	i agree. once people get used to trusting their instincts, they become more comfortable with making decisions with out any deliberation.|`|ElBIeRFNaa	i agree with that.  i know for me, if i follow my instincts, i come out much better in the end.  if i ignore them, i usually screw up or am in for a world of hurt.

He lived with five other guys, but at any given time there would be one or two random guys that would stay there for the week. In order to see each other I would have to come over in the early morning between our two jobs and classes. It was that, or we couldnt see each other during the week. He started sleeping out on the couch because his roommate that shared a room with him started a graveyard shift and needed his sleep. One morning, before the sun came up, I had just let myself in to his apartment, and saw that his alarm clock was by the couch so that he wouldnt sleep through class. He hadnt been expecting me so I carefully walked through the pitch black apartment trying not to trip over anything. I wanted to surprise him with a wake up kiss, so I knelt down and started to kiss him. It was turning quite passionate when all of the sudden he went completely rigid. I sat up to see what was wrong and it wasnt my fiance at all. It was some random guy who had just happened to stay overnight. I thought I was going to die! All I could pathetically say was, Sorry, I thought you were my fiance.

You haven't seen anything yet.  You think you are hurting now.  Wait till your idea of love is twisted and devoured and looks like sickness and dread.  Wait until you know ... for sure how alone you really are.  Wait until there is no drug, no man, no care, and no hope for a future that can make you feel anything at all.  They want your hope, your pride, your value, your love, your will, your passion,  ... they want to take it from you.  And they will.  And soon.    Ha ha ha, it's not that big of a deal, right.  Ya.  You will soon see.  Your friends don't know they hate you.  But they hate themselves.  So where can your value be in their eyes??   You are already done for in the statistics.

Cut down a little on the glasses of pop as this will make you bloated and gassy and try drinking lots of water. Try not to take medication to help with the constipation or rely on it.     Try adding some fibre in your diet from grains such as wheat and oats. So for breakfast it might be a good idea to replace the cherrios which aren't particularly fibrous with toasted muesli with brown sugar, porrage, bran flakes, something with oats and/or wheat that is not overly processed. I think the Cherrios aren't very good and the pop. Everything else is very healthy. Also do you exercise much? This can help with wind and constipation too :)
62ZBofvPaa	Mmm...sort of.  It's because women were traditionally marginalized in most areas of study...so talking about women's place in society/history/media/politics whatever is lumped as "women's studies".    There are male studies that study the idea of masculinity itself (not as much men's place in society since that's already covered in mainstream studies)...however it's so small that yahoo probably intended to lump it under gender studies?  That's my guess.|`|PLBIf2XVaa	well men arnt important  we have it all!!

Feminism specifically exists because nobody used to talk about gender in a critical sense. Thus, feminism is still the word used when people are talking about issues that arise because of a political need to address systems of oppression or exclusion that are based on the grounds of gender.|`|2bO7iiZdaa	I think this forum should be renamed "Gender studies".|`|0w5Apf1naa	Many men say it's unneeded, I wouldn't mind their being one.|`|BoqbYQ1Naa	What a brilliant idea!  I don't think that question has been asked in - oh, the last three hours or so.|`|fDGPbwdsaa	Feminists like to ensure that women have priority over men at all times - therefore the title "gender and women's studies" gives clear priority to women's issues and slides men's issues under the carpet.    This is the feminist definition of 'equality'.    If a section named "gender and men's studies" existed, even if it were set up to discuss true issues men face (misandry, discrimination, sexism, paternity fraud, custody, etc.) feminists would insist it was 'sexism' that men had a place of their own.    For proof, just look at the GPA. Feminists whined and rallied against the GPA, even though it allowed women on the sites and to play golf there. The only discrimination it did commit, was women could not be members.    However - predictably - feminists 'forgot' (they suffer terrible amnesia when it suites their agenda) to mention that there was also an LGPA (L = Ladies)... the LGPA did NOT allow men to become members, did NOT allow men to play and did NOT allow men even on the sites... but only the GPA was sexist, right?

Try to calm your nerves down, relax. What could possibly go wrong? Nothing. If he isn't interested in you, move on.  Don't let your nerves or your worries or your fears get the better of you, if you do, you'll never enjoy life.

e2DEQ6Euaa	People unconsciously have a need to get more information about each other (knowledge is power). At the very moment 2 people meet, we naturally will start to judge based on all the data our senses collect. Eg. What they dress, what we hear, how they move etc. As such, the outer image of a person is very crucial in determining your first impression because that is the first set of data the other party receives.    In regards to the importance of status and roles, people also like to generalize. For example, if we hear someone is a wealthy businessman, we are more likely to invest with him than with a small time coffee shop. This is what causes the rich to get richer and the poor to get poorer    hope this helps.
K8blUjQJaa	It's ABSOLUTELY normal!  You experienced a very traumatic event.  You are probably experiencing a whole range of horrible feelings, from loss to anger (at the driver who hit your girlfriend, or at yourself for allowing it to happen-- though it WASN'T your fault) to guilt ("Damn, that should have been me...").  Every one of these feelings is normal, given what happened.  It's also normal to blame yourself, even though it wasn't your fault.  This is called "survivors' guilt" and it can affect anyone who has survived a tragedy where others have lost their lives.    I'm very sorry for your loss.  I encourage you to seek out a grief-support counselor, either one-on-one or a support group, to help sort out these feelings in a caring atmosphere.  You don't need to go this alone.    Prayers... +++ |`|AKVQNGcOaa	Yes, it will last a long time, but every time you consider suicide, ask yourself "Is this what ____ (her name) would have wanted me to do?".|`|jX4Byb6Eaa	yes, the grieving process is a long one. it will last a while, but it's normal. you will move on in time. i am very sorry for your loss.

Good Luck!|`|QAtpLEEFaa	if you are really in a position where you just have to do a presentation then:  prepare as many supports as possible:    1. if you are able to make it a power point presentation this will    a) take the attention away from you  b) mean that you dont have to try to remember everything  c) gives you the chance to use images as well as words  d) allow you to pace yourself - eg so many points plus intro plus conclusion plus questions in the time you have    2. if not then think about preparing handouts to do the job instead - again work out how many key points you need to make your argument.      3. whichever of these ways of diverting attention onto the issue and away from you as a person develop questions.  Then to make sure that you get answers     a) at the start of the presentation pair the other students off  - give yourself a couple of minutes to  do this -check to see if everyones got a pair if not add the singles to make trios where  necessary    b) when you get to your questions tell them to talk to each other about the question - give them at least 2 mnutes to do this    c) then pick two  of the couples to get them to reply separately    d) at the next question choose other couples    Do not throw out general questions to the general group  otherwise you stand there like an idiot when nobody replies making you even more nervous. Be really specific, eg  I am planning  to take this combination of courses ..tell me what combinations you think might be better    In other words you have been given responsibilty for this period of time so take charge and present it the way you will feel most comfortable.    things not to do:    don't:  put your head down and read from the paper    act too selfconsciously - dont speak too fast or too quietly instead try to  focus on the content and the clarity of what you are telling the class    talk to just one person in the class - instead try to remember to make eye contact with different people as you go through the points    do    Try to use the three rules of voice control:i.e keep your voice:    Low,  Slow and Steady    Practise either to friends , family or to the mirror    resist the temptation to apologise for any aspect of your presentation|`|xP8oJoxnaa	Just don't go to class if you can get out of it.

wIQnC6pTaa	I lost my job a few months ago in the finance sector in New York, which is hurting badly.  It is very difficult to find another job, because many people are being laid off and virtually no firm is hiring.  So not only has the number of job seekers risen dramatically, but at the same time the number of jobs available has plummeted.    The result is not just that the number of unemployed Americans has doubled in the past year.  More sinister is the loss of self-confidence and the stress put on families.      There is a news story this week about a man in Los Angeles who killed himself, his wife and five children after losing his job.  I don't think you have to ask very far to hear many stories of how the weak economy has hit people and their communities.      The only sectors insulated at this stage are healthcare and education.  Otherwise, the rest of the economy is facing falling revenues, which means jobs at risk.  EVERY company has been hit, from Microsoft to Starbucks, not just badly managed firms.    Moreover, anybody with savings or pensions invested in stocks or property (which means most Americans) has seen these values fall hard.  Talk to an older worker with many years of hard earned savings wiped out in the past year, and you will understand better.    Count yourself lucky thus far if you haven't been affected, but by no means brag about it because many people and their families have not been so fortunate.|`|O5DZvc0Xaa	Knowledge of monetary theory has made a political activist out of me!

Sadly, women do not know how to speak and instead resort to mindless children's games involving signals that have a better use on a baseball diamond. If women just opened their mouth and said what they want, it would erase much of the confusion. Unfortunately, women like playing "games".    Edit: Wendy, first you really do show your knowledge of English quite well. Not. I said mankind, not men.             As far as being more adept at language, yeah you just proved my point.

By the way.. people in general are bad at picking up on signals, and for good reason: "signals" require assumptions.    Oh, and by the way?  In this question:  http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...  You asked why men pick up on signals so often that they respond to false signals.  Now you're asking why they don't pick up on enough signals?    Seriously?|`|NNHdkLDWaa	Bunny if you say women are smarter it iz so ;)|`|9a8dcc5b6d79b07abd75628d8b093129aa	No, that doesn't mean that women are smarter, it just means that women are not direct in relationships and the man needs to have experience to know what does the woman want.    But then again, not all women are like that and not all men are clueless about signals, this "social" studies are inaccurate because they generalize too much.|`|096b7gBHaa	refusing to clean your own space and clean your dishes creates an attitude that leads to stupidity, at least in long term    coz your space is about where you begin and end each day of your life. so it has a lot to do with building brain    that's why boys on average now talk more than women    coz they're lack of self control    and empty-brained    honestly|`|CXqXdsK6aa	It would stand that women are naturally better at interpreting their own signals.    To say men in general are stupid to not interpret them correctly betrays the intelligence of the poster. The proper word is "ignorant". And to say women are good at giving signals is incorrect because all women are different, and all women give different signals, esp from other countries. And since woman are just as terrible at understanding men's signals, words, actions, and their logic it would mean they were stupid too. Hardly a reasonable arguement.    I don't think you agree because the argument makes sense, I think you agree because you are vindictive or you haven't been around much. To each his own.    edit:   What experience do you have that says men are stupid? That is an incorrect assumption, and a word that has little meaning for the subject. You are just trying to get to people, which makes you vindictive, not a seeker of knowledge... you cheat yourself.      And to say that women are better at giving signals than men are at reading them is a contradiction. After all, who are they giving signals too? If the purpose of giving a signal is for someone to receive and understand it, then you must not be giving very good signals if the majority of your recipitants do not understand it. That means you are not a good communicator.|`|vQKNu1Mgaa	well for one thing, we as guys could really care less about thinking about wat you are thinking about, and its common sense that women could pick up on their own signals, its the bs they come up with so of course they know wat it means|`|YWb03peGaa	these signals are dumb like if they say ohh i don't want anything for christmas they still expect you to get them something, so if anyone said that to me i would not get them anything and when they started complaining i would say IM NOT A ******* MIND READER IF YOU SAID YOU DONT WANT ANYTHING THAN YOU DONT WANT ANYTHING

FdfE8iMEaa	I also have arachnophobia.  I had to see a therapist because I was living alone and could hardly function.      In therapy he had me put up pictures of spiders around my apartment (tape them to the walls).  that is exposure therapy. (i was so bad that I would become hysterical if I even saw a picture or saw one on tv).     He then caught some spiders and put them in jars around his office so that I could be in a controlled environment with them (again, exposure therapy).  He would finally put a jar in front of me on the table so that I was closer to it.      One of them died, so he put the dead spider on the table in front of me (not in the jar).  It got to the point where I could touch the dead spider.  I then held the dead spider.    He then put a live spider (a white, common house spider) on the table.  I eventually had to put my hand up to make sure the spider didn't get off the table.  It got to the point where I could put my hand down and let the spider crawl up my arm.    Keep in mind this took several months (i saw him for an hour twice a week).  It is a slow process.      I am not cured.  I am better at dealing with them, but I still have the phobia.  My skin is crawling just thinking about it...lol.      Hopefully that helps you.  You can try it on your own, or you can seek out a therapist who deals with phobias.  Most insurance companies cover it (i think it is considered mental health) and if you don't have insurance the government (like medicaid) should.      It takes a lot of work, trust me.  I have also heard that people can get hypnotized, but i haven't tried that.    Good luck to you!!!|`|jX4Byb6Eaa	flooding. be around a lot of spiders. also behavioral therapy. be around someone who has a pet spider that is safe. maybe if you see that they aren't all bad the fear will lessen.|`|xP8oJoxnaa	Well, I suppose to just hang around Spiders.

rKVKiyopaa	Chase dreams often stem from feelings of anxiety in your walking life. The way we respond to anxiety and pressure in real life is typically manifested as a chase dream. Running is an instinctive response to physical threats in our environment. Often in these dream scenarios, you are being pursued by some attacker, who wants to hurt or possibly kill you. You are running away, hiding, or trying to outwit your pursuer. Chase dreams may represent your way of coping with fears, stress or various situations in your waking life. Instead of confronting the situation, you are running away and avoiding it. Ask yourself who is the one chasing you and you may gain some understanding and insight on the source of your fears and pressure.    The pursuer or attacker who is chasing you in your dream may also represent a part of yourself. Your own feelings of anger, jealousy, fear, and possibly love, can assume the appearance of threatening figure. You may be projecting these feelings onto the unknown chaser. Next time you have a chase dream, turn around and confront your pursuer. Ask them why they are chasing you.    One may be consumed by their own anger, jealousy, love, or self-destructive behavior. For example, you may be drinking too much or exhibiting open hostility toward others around you. You may subconsciously be threatened by these actions which have been jeopardizing your relationships and/or career. Your dreams are a way of calling attention to these self-destructive actions.    A more direct analysis of chase dreams is the fear of being attacked. Such dreams are more common among women than men, who may feel physically vulnerable in the urban environment. These dreams are inspired by fears of violence and sexual assault in which we are so over-exposed from the media. The violence that the media portrays magnifies our fears and how at risk we all are.    hope that helps
kHX1h7LFaa	I could state 3 quick answers.    Social sciences helps society to understand itself as a whole, thus making it possible to take actions on ourself to alter the outcome of our society as we feel its better.    Social sciences give a foundation to other kinds of human development. For example politics are based on the fact that people can govern themselves through democratic systems which are supported by the social sciences that can measure and predict the outcome of certain actions.    Social Sciences help us think of the possibility that a better society can be achieved. With this in mind social sciences can direct the society into this social utopia.|`|4854FMZjaa	Check out Hindu Philosophy!

Sex is only the weapon.  I suppose men should not complain about being raped by other men either, right?  Sex is sex.|`|krKMYVbFaa	Women want sex, but only from someone they know, trust, and want to have it with.  Rape is not consensual and is not something that women want.|`|z60J0Z9Daa	If...

Of course they would!  Wanting sex doesn't mean wanting sex with anyone or anything that manages to force their way in.    The obvious answer is that rape is physically damaging and mentally/emotionally extremely stressful.|`|gYbe3BNeaa	Why do men who are raped by other men in the military complain?   I don't get it.

It was about him being able to control me.   Rape is not sex. It's an act of  violence & power over a person.     *It's probably more b/c many women don't report the rape. I didn't. Besides,  stats don't matter. 1 of 4 or  2 of 7 if one women or man gets raped it's one too many. Rape is disgusting.     Women do want sex.|`|Pa4cyKn7aa	It's one thing for a woman to freely and willingly give herself to a man.

If a woman isn't wet than something entering her vagina hurts very badly, and can damage her. In some cases the loss of blood and pain can send her into shock. You may want to read up a bit on rape, because you seem confused about it's motives. Your question is very offensive, but I think it's because you just don't understand rape very well. So I don't blame you. I looked long and hard for a good link.
AA11606721	Charles' views were similar to his grandfather's, Erasmus. Common descent was widely believed among naturalists of the day. Erasmus leaned more toward Lamarck in terms of the origin of species but that was largely abandoned in Charles' generation.    Excerpts from: Zoonomia; or, the laws of organic life by Erasmus Darwin, 1803  http://darwin.baruch.cuny.edu/biography/...|`|iBxb6lJlaa	that's a good question. I'm not sure if he had any cement views before his voyage. But, my guess is he's always had a swaying idea of the origin.|`|sX9Ilrpxaa	Before his travels on the Beagle, Darwin was a theology student at Cambridge.  He saw observing nature scientifically as religious natural theology.  Basically, he probably believed in divine design in nature because that is what he had been studying.    Darwin made many observations on his voyage.  In my opinion the two that stand out are his observation of fossils of extinct megafauna (huge prehistoric animals) that had lived on the Galapagos islands but no longer were there.  They had apparently gone extinct without a major catastrophe (as extinctions at the time were always explained). Since Darwin had been reading about the principle of uniformitarianism in geology, he understood deep time.  He recognized that the animal life on the islands had changed over time.    His other, more famous discovery was that animals on the different islands, while similar, were in fact slightly different.  He observed 12 different species of finches living on different islands with different feeding habits.  Tortoises and other birds on the islands also exhibited  variation.      Darwin began to think about how, through adaptation and natural selection, one species could change over time to another.  Pretty neat! I hope this helps.  You can actually read Darwin's work for free here: http://darwin-online.org.uk/

I don't care if you want to stay home and take care of kids.  But I want my freedom to leave the home, travel, study, make guy and girl friends, have sex with my boyfriend, or if I break up with him I can go out and meet guys on my own, and not have to worry about being punished for it.  I like making money and buying things on my own, knowing that I earned that ****, and giving out lots of gifts to my friends and boyfriends.  I'm responsible for myself, and me and my loved ones take care of each other.     Don't assume that just because some women want freedom from that path that you've already chosen, that means they actually give a **** about what you do with your freetime.  I don't.  That's why I am a feminist.  Since you aren't a feminist, it's you who wants to force me into your life, and I say **** that noise.  Sorry if that bothers you, but get over it already.    Edit:  Lol @ Whorella's take on the "man's right to be a man" bit.    Double Edit:  You're "dramatic" because you just posted a question just to complain about all the mean feminists who supposedly disrespect you for staying home (with no evidence of this), like no feminist has ever been disrespected for NOT wanting the stuff that you do.  Come on!|`|uhchod38aa	You have a right to live your life as you wish; if you want to be a SAHM, go for it.

If you're not a feminist, why are you trying to engage women who are?    And I chose a "traditional" marriage, despite being a feminist.  I thought I had found a life partner...only to discover that "women's work:" is not respected.     Doubt it?    If a house is messy, do you ever blame the husband?  Even when  both spouses work, its always the wife's fault.    I took a serious injury a few year back, making housework impossible for me. NO one said a word to my husband...but in quiet asked me if there wasn't SOMETHING I could do about it.    I don't question the choices other women make. I just wish they would not be so defensive of them.|`|sfn6SpbCaa	I am as well; only I'm an anti.  The best way to get along in life is to do your thing and let others do theirs. Yes, from time to time we get slammed to the ground with such terms as scummy subservient wussies; however, in our homes we do know the truth. For example my truth is I am not scummy, I bathe, I am not subservient meaning I do make a whole mess of decisions in my house and my husband is capable of doing things on his own and at times he does nice things for me like drying water off of the bathroom floor, popping his own toast in the toaster.  I most certainly am not a wussie. I'm feisty and some one once told me that I have moxie. Above all I am deeply respected by my husband and as the term 317c4 goes I can be quite assertive.  All women enjoy their roll as a woman; to prove that, even though I am an anti as I have previously stated, I used to go to work, pay my rent and my bills and the whole shebang and at the same time till this day I have not stopped being a woman.|`|pX66rG5taa	Stay at home women who like to cook can still be and probably are feminists.

Someone who isn't sexist comes in, they see sexism against both genders, and it starts to polarize.    The feminists and the misogynists are unwitting coconspirators in this vicious cycle.  And they both don't seem to care about their own sexism, just the others' sexism.  To them, we're not a collection of people but two different collections of genders.    Please, I hope this board never touches you.|`|W0hNoMSsaa	There is nothing wrong with a woman who wants to stay home and be taken care of by a man.  If a woman enjoys that lifestyle, then it is the right choice for her.  Society benefits from it, too.  For example, I think it is best for children to have a mom at home than to spend their formative years in day care.     People these days are getting the wrong idea about what feminists are. It's because the only feminists most people ever see are the angry, strident, in-your-face types who make a lot of noise and attract attention from the media.    I am a 60 year old married woman, and I have considered myself to be a feminist since I was in my 20's.  This means that I would like to be seen as a person and not defined merely by my gender. I don't want to be seen as a sexual object. I would like to receive the same pay and opportunities that my male coworkers take for granted. I would like the freedom to decide whether or not I want to be a mother. I don't want to be pigeonholed into traditional female roles (nurse, secretary, teacher, cook, housekeeper) unless I choose those roles for myself.     I also acknowledge that men and women are different biologically, and that we have different tendencies. Women are not carbon copies of men. We tend to be more nurturing and better communicators; men tend to be more aggressive and better at mechanical and spatial tasks. I believe both male and female tendencies are equally necessary and should be equally valued by society.  Some people don't respect homemakers and some do, but it is a job like any other -- a 24 hour unpaid job with no vacations and no days off.    However, I would urge all married women, working or not, to be aware that there are risks to this lifestyle. Chances are that you going to have to take care of yourself at some time in your life. You might become widowed, or your husband might divorce you for a younger model. Your husband might lose his earning power due to a layoff, an accident or illness. So if you choose to be financially dependent on a man, you need to develop job skills so that you can still survive should the gravy train come to an end.|`|iqqQLSDDaa	I consider myself to be a "feminist" insomuch as I believe in equal rights for women.    But I also think that should mean equal rights for both men and women to choose how they want to divide roles in a relationship.    I'm with you - I would prefer to be a homemaker. But I'm also very thankful for the fact that I have options. Which I do need as I've fallen in love with a man who can't be a provider if we stay together long-term (he's disabled).|`|7J6m0L3Haa	You can have all the traditional roles in the world you want. But as soon as you start saying that feminists and less traditional women are wrong or that we hate men or that only your way of life is correct, then you're sexist and mistaken.    Feminists are for the right of women to choose. If you do not support women who choose a life you would not want for yourself, then you are sexist. And we are perfectly within our rights to say so.    Furthermore, you didn't get the right to vote and recognition of your legal equality to men by the women that came before you criticizing feminists. They took the right to vote back from the traditionalists that kept it from them. You *can* be a feminist and stay at home. Feminists don't care what you do with your right to choose in so long as you support the rights of other women to choose.    Failure to do so is embracing misogyny. Misogyny is responsible for all sorts of things like acid attacks on young girls in Afghanistan for going to school, keeping birth control from women, disallowing divorce, and extremely high rape rates. Do you seriously want to do that? Surrender yourself to the foul embrace of misogynists? Excuse me, but they didn't fight for your rights. They actively opposed them. No amount of surrendering to male authority is going to give you liberty safety and the right to choose what you want to do with your life. That's all feminism. Opposing that is quite sad.|`|cWxwHMQWaa	I take good care of my man, and he takes good care of me.    At home, I'm pretty traditional in many ways, that's my choice, only a man I'm with needs to support that choice. Only his opinion matters.    Publicly though, I'm grateful for the fact I am able to be successful, feminism is what I have to thank for that. I think it's disrespectful not to, personally.     I feel connected to feminism because I *am* feminine. I totally respect women or men who don't want anything to do with it, that's their choice.     Being a feminist isn't my entire existence, it's not even the only thing I believe in, imagine that! haha =o)    Seen many here who are self-titled feminists who value a lot of stereotypically traditional things as well, I was surprised too at first, I figured a woman like me would be told I wasn't a feminist by their standards because of how I am in my personal life.    If you're open, you'd be surprised at what women who call themselves feminists are like, maybe they're not what you think =o)|`|S2vI4VEXaa	I'm a feminist who respects a mans right to be a man.  And I was a stay at home mom for years and did take care of my family. Nothing's wrong with it. It's your life, and no one can make you feel guilty about it unless you allow it.|`|uXqDYPNVaa	You really have no idea why feminists aren't fond of you, do you? It's not about what you like about men or relationships or whatever. It's because you're blatantly disrespectful to people whose ideas differ from yours, as evidenced by this question, and you don't seem like the kind of person who would ever accept being wrong about something. Staying home? We don't care. Being taken care of? We don't care. Having to put up with this overdramatic nonsense on GWS? We care.    I support a man's right to be a man (not that anyone has a choice), but if, for him, that means providing for his woman, he can exercise that right all he wants with someone else.    EDIT: "What makes you think I'm over dramatic?" The lack of contrary evidence. "if you don't care then why are you answering my questions?" Because if I see bull here, I'll call it bull.|`|krKMYVbFaa	I agree and support you 100%.  I am the exact same way.  I am in no way a feminist.  I want to stay home and raise a family and have dinner on the table for him when he walks through the door.  Everyone is intitled to their own ambition and goals.  If you don't agree with how some people chose to live their lives, big deal.  It is not anyone else's place to tell me how I should be living my life with my family.

I don't know why women like doing things like this.|`|df56ca79f426d12c4a6737af42e04037aa	maybe she's trying to avoid you. maybe she feels like if she keeps busy you won't bother her to have sex or whatever else.  has she ever been sexually assaulted?  i know quite a few woman who have been sexually assaulted that are obsessed with cleaning their home and keeping things in order.  it's a way to keep control in their lives.  i was like that after i got raped. it took awhile to "let go."|`|x5MYW2LPaa	Some people are like that, they loe cleaning.

Take it from me, most women would rather do anything else except wash dishes and clean house.  Maybe if you pitched in a little, she wouldn't have so much to do.  Vacuuming during your football game might be her way of sending you a not-so-subtle message that she's doing all the work while you're having all the fun.|`|W1VqOP83aa	What jen said, except the opposite. She really needs to be more in touch with your feelings. Its her inability to realize that you are just trying to chill out and have some beers with your friends thats the problem. You need to sit her down and tell her that she needs to watch tv and drink something. You can clean after you are drunk and your friends leave, its more fun when you are hammered anyway.|`|gYbe3BNeaa	My advice to her is just to stop.  That's what I did.  From then on it was maid service.  I really don't care if the laundry grows mold or the mound of dishes in the sink and counter end up on the floor smashed to pieces.  Or if he goes hungry.      You don't seem to realise that she has control over you, not the other way around.  If she decides to strike, you're doomed.  You'll have no choice but to subsist on pizza and grow manbreasts.|`|qcDHyhdtaa	Have you ever thought of helping her out w/the work?    She's obviously annoyed w/you.

What's your excuse?|`|uhchod38aa	I would bet money she's not doing it because she enjoys it. If you would get off the couch and help her, it would get done faster and then you could enjoy your game.

The benefit is the release - and my place is clean. Not a bad deal!    You could always offer to vacuum when your buddies go home after the game.     Your wife may feel that she isn't getting any attention from you. If your Saturdays and Sundays are devoted to drinking a few with buddies, as you watch a game, when do you spend quality time with her? Quality = strengthens your emotional bond with one another.|`|a71e1d190c16e2a5b566d5670e23bc31aa	Social engineering and lazy males|`|90JLVTMwaa	my third wife, tracie, was absolutely obsessed with cleaning.  you'd think that a woman would understand that a stay-at-home dad like me needs some attention after a long, boring day but she'd get home from work and, instead of wanting to hang out, she'd start cleaning.  have you ever half-way finished a beer and then wanted to come back to it later because you forgot you left it somewhere?  not in Tracie's house.  she threw away lots of perfectly good beer.  I think that was the main reason I left her for her little sister, because of the non-stop cleaning.|`|7J6m0L3Haa	She's cleaning because you aren't. Nobody enjoys cleaning. Maybe you ought to help. It's not charity, and you're not being a "good person" by helping. You are obligated to help the person you live with take care of the house. Failure to do so is a moral deficiency. Furthermore, the failure to realize that she is cleaning because you don't or the bizarre allegation that women enjoy cleaning is the result of sexism and the inability to think of women as rational equal human beings.|`|EeThBc3Zaa	Women like her find it unnerving when the mold in the bathroom starts to become sentient, and the dustbunnies run off with their slippers.  Men like you probably just offer the sentient mold and dustbunnies a beer.  But that leads to drunken dustbunnies.  People could DIE if the dustbunnies try to drive.  You should really think about that.|`|2e41580c4f9ca26f64c21c7dcc27e33faa	yes, clearly you are abused|`|sfn6SpbCaa	She's a naturally clean person; in addition to that she likes everything **** and span and in its place.  She could perform her gender role more quietly if you be a dear and praise her first for what a lovely job she's doing and during the games could she not clean so much.  I hope she doesn't suffer from a cleaning disorder.|`|krKMYVbFaa	Because she is being a good wife.  If you wanted to score some points you would help her once in a while.  How do you think your house stays clean?  Not on it's own, my friend.|`|NYU37jfGaa	I don't, I hate it.  But I do housework because my husband gets fed up if I don't, he is far more houseproud than I am.  Neither of us does dishes because we have a dishwasher.  Maybe you could buy one, and that would at least cut down on some of the energy she expends on these things?    If you really don't like your wife doing housework, then you should try and encourage her to get some more interests of her own.  Can't you get her interested in going on the computer or something?  Or try and persuade her to take up painting or pottery or embroidery or yoga or jigsaw puzzles or something.  She needs to get interested in something other than housework.|`|BoqbYQ1Naa	Maybe if you'd get off your azz and get a better job, you could afford a cleaning service so she can hang out and kick back a few beers once in awhile.  She's earned it.|`|62ZBofvPaa	It's not that they like to wash dishes or clean house--most women hate cleaning house.    But they hate living in filth even more.|`|096b7gBHaa	coz we aren't scared to dirty our nails unlike men who spend their Saturday's and Sunday's hanging out with their boys doing manicures without us knowing it before they kick back a few beers which are actually apple juices|`|CEMUpgFPaa	Not this women! lol i hate cleaning, not all women do you are generalizing, Also my mail/opened papers lay in one big messy heap on my kitchen table, a smaller heap on the floor next to my desk.

It would be hard for them to even take you seriously.  2nd, if she is leaving in a week, HR wouldn't even have time to fully investigate before she is gone. If they process a term form for her, they aren't going to write her up after a term form is already in process.  3rd, you'll be scrutinized for all your past emailings. It is kind of HR's job to eliminate idle employees (haven't you heard of the millions of job cuts in the past year???) Employees who have a lot of time to email will be 'watched' -- or on the mental list of HR.    It was actually a nice thing of her to care enough to say goodbye, and to try and leave on a good note.

You can also emotionally invest your time in people. Maybe someone is having a hard time so you really put yourself out there to help them and invest your emotions.

Vwce1Gocaa	The first scientific system used by scientists and police to catch criminals was called anthropometry (measuring parts of the body).  A psychiatrist and sociologist Cesare Lombroso, used anthropometry to examine and categorize prison inmates. Before that, their methods were pretty limited and not very scientific.     You might want to look up William Herschel. He had the first idea of using fingerprints in the 1850s as way of establishing identity. Also, Henry Faulds, I believe was his name, thought of using fingerprints as a unique identifier for individuals.      Check out the book "Fingerprints: Murder and the Race to Uncover the Science of Identity" by Colin Beavan, I think you'll find a lot of good material in it.

1wJeITvdaa	According to author Stuart Hart, sustainable global enterprise holds the key to reducing poverty, reversing environmental destruction, and even counteracting terrorism. SocialFunds.com -- Cornell and University of North Carolina Business Professor Stuart Hart's Capitalism at the Crossroads perfectly complements University of Michigan Business Professor C. K. Prahalad's The Fortune at the Bottom of the Pyramid, perhaps even surpassing it in significance. The two professors collaborated from 1998 through 2002 on the seminal article that gave birth to the "bottom of the pyramid" (BOP) concept that Prof. Prahalad explains so eloquently in his book (see related book review). The BOP market theory holds that multinational corporations (MNCs) can simultaneously profit and help reduce global poverty by serving a market they have largely ignored until recently: the 4 billion people in the world living on less than $2 a day. As good as Prof. Prahalad's book is, however, it leaves unanswered the question of how the BOP theory fits into the larger context of sustainability, particularly environmental sustainability. Prof. Hart's book not only answers this question, but also presents a comprehensive and compelling argument that capitalism cannot afford to ignore sustainability--indeed, that capitalism will thrive by embracing sustainability (and vice versa). "This book takes the contrarian's view that business--more than either government or civil society--is uniquely equipped, at this point in history, to lead us toward a sustainable world in the years ahead," writes Prof. Hart. "Properly focused, the profit motive can accelerate (not inhibit) the transformation toward global sustainability, with nonprofits, governments, and multilateral agencies all playing crucial roles as collaborators." Prof. Hart introduces the book describing how the shift in the relationship between capitalism and environmentalism from antagonistic to (sometimes) complementary forces mirrored his own shift from distrusting capitalism to respecting its power to leverage positive social change. The "greening" revolution of the 1980s demonstrated that companies could profit by employing more environmentally benign processes, such as recycling or waste reduction. However laudable the greening approach is, it became apparent in the 1990s that reducing the environmental impact of existing business models would prove insufficient to address the imminent environmental and social crises, according to Prof. Hart. He was among those who at that time promoted moving "beyond greening" through "creative destruction" of environmentally and economically wasteful processes, replacing them with environmentally (and economically) beneficial processes. "Unlike greening, which works through the existing supply chain to effect continuous improvement in the current business system, 'beyond greening' strategies focus on emerging technologies, new markets, and unconventional partners and stakeholders," writes Prof. Hart. "Such strategies are thus disruptive to current industry structure and raise the possibility of significant repositioning, enabling new players to establish leading positions as the process of creative destruction unfolds." The primary business strategy that promises to arise from the ashes of creative destruction is the BOP approach of serving the needs of the poor in ways that are culturally appropriate,

As far as capitalism is concerned, non Christians are often guided by a different set of standards, one being 'profit at any cost' so the sale of drugs to children becomes justified as it makes a profit.

This is only part of the answer.|`|4H4dUBkGaa	Diplomatic service serves a rather important role (pragmatically). The world is a complicated place. We don't have free trade, peace, etc. ideally foreign service exists to facilitate all of these things. If you're a libertarian, you should appreciate this objective, and also realize that foreign service duties will sometimes require you to sacrifice your belief system for politics.     The most basic way to distinguish between ethical and legal prescriptions is to consider the impact on people other than the actor (i.e., society in general, victims, and so on). If one person's actions impose an externality on others-- the actor does not bear the full cost of his actions-- then there may be a case for government intervention.     So, sleeping around doesn't really victimize anyone other than the participant (God's wrath is applied at the individual level, eh?). As such, it is not the state's business. Murder imposes costs on the victim, the victim's family and friends, and so on. As such, the state has an interest.     i wish you the best, liber. try to think in terms of pragmatism even if principles form your foundations.
AA10442322	In order to stay positive all the time, you may want to consider these steps:    1. Recite positive messages, reaffirm that you are a positive individual all the time. Even before you sleep, you must tell yourself that you are a winner. However, even reciting positive messages is nothing if you don't have a plan to do it. For example, I am a winner. I am a winner because of my positive attitude towards the world. I believe that I am a winner just by trying. I will try my best in all my endeavour and never to give up at all.    2. Stay away from people who are negative about everything. Birds of the same feathers flock together. By staying clear of such individuals and mingling with positive individuals, you will stay positive.    3.
