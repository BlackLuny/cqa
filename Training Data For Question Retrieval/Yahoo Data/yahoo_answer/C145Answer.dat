JnLoHaoAaa	I would say your OWN last name. The ex is a jerk and the new boyfriend? Hate to say it, but who says he'll still be around in 6 months with a crying baby who wakes up in the middle of the night. You have only been together for literally a matter of weeks. Put your last name on the birth certificate because you know for sure you are going to be there for the baby|`|kzyEuRroaa	I would do a hyphenated last name.  Your current bf hasn't been with you long enough for you to consider him father material, and even if your ex and you don't get along he is still the baby's father whether you like that or not.  You can't remove him from his child's life if he wants to be part of that, so hyphenate the last name-yours and his.  If not just do your last name, as it can be changed at any adoption hearing.  Good luck to you!!|`|ROJans2Taa	it's a personal choice, you could just put your own last name, you'll always be the mother and there for your child, or do a hyphenated last name. if it were me in that situation I would put my own last name. unless your really certain that this new guy will be long lasting and forever in your child's life, I wouldn't put their name, unless we had been together a long time. best luck|`|cfdooGylaa	If he is willing to adopt and your ex wants nothing to do with the child, then by all means put your current bfs last name. Congrats. Have a safe delivery!|`|6e58ce6577be3f4549253fc7148b5e1caa	If I were you I would give the baby your last name.  You stated that you have only been dating this guy for a couple of months.  Do not give your baby his last name.  What if the two of you do not work out will you make him pay child support just because he is listed as the father.  The father of the baby will be off the hook because you gave the baby someone else last name.  It is will be a hugh mistake to give the baby your current boyfriend's last name.  If he wants to adopt the child there are requirements the two of you have to meet first.  So go through that and if he is able to adopt then give the child his last name until then give the baby your last name.|`|U1RcZjqJaa	I agree with everybody saying to use your last name. It can be changed later on if he does decide to adopt your baby, but I would only trust yourself with your baby at this point|`|kH56qw2Taa	u can put ures xx|`|4XfjUcvDaa	You put your last name.  If your boyfriend now wants to adopt then you can change the last name when that happens.|`|ggUkVGvPaa	i think you should use yours|`|9zMC6EBtaa	Just to avoid legal troubles, for now I would put the real fathers name on the birth certificate. Then once you are out of the hospital, and feel ready enough to meet with him, why not see if he wouldn't mind the boyfriend adopting the son.|`|iv7u9iWlaa	Put YOUR last name!! If the father is not going to be a part of your child's life than he most certainly doesn't need his sperm donors last name.  If you are not even sure where your relationship is going with your current relationship it would not be a smart idea to put his name on the birth certificate. Just give him your last name! Then later down the road when you get married and your child gets adopted by your husband you can change his name. You don't have to put a father on the birth certificate.    Good Luck!|`|kDxljPUnaa	Your name.     Make arrangements to be married as soon as you can. That would be the best.|`|hy9fz99Xaa	f*** em both, put your own last name.   unless the childs father is trying to stick around and help
7n3rSDn2aa	I would say with certainty that the test is negative but I would suggest baby dancing one more time for good measure! It can't hurt and trust me you'll be glad you did ;-) ! My dh and I had sex for several days before, the day of, and several days after ovulation and made sure to prop my bum up afterwards and guess what? I'm now almost 7 weeks pregnant with baby number one! Good Luck and Baby Dust!|`|pR4nLjyRaa	The first pic is positive, second one is negative. Good luck!
wqchA8B7aa	What is your question? Are you asking if it's possible the second guy slipped one in and got you pregnant? The answer is yes, but the odds are pretty slim. Same odds as winning the powerball. The new guy will know it's not his, and the old guy will think it's not his either. You've made a mess of things.|`|93e5e66462cba8bcd411219422deababaa	oh yeah you were pregnant before that- nit was your old partner|`|5bc21d2d2a57683cdbd5ef3c4094ebc4aa	Most likely however the dates are too close together so you'll have to have a paternity test done.|`|Ki6jlwnbaa	yeah sounds like it was the first guy, it usually takes about a month to get a positive. Definitely not just 6 days.|`|Bw1h5xAcaa	There's no way you'd get a positive result after 6 days. You were pregnant before. A doctor should be able to easily verify this with an ultrasound.|`|S8Qpiabdaa	yeah you probably were already pregnant. 6 days is to soon. although i would keep the other partner a secret from your x just to keep from having problems!|`|Q0xm1Kodaa	I think you are pregnant with your partner of 6 years. If you took a test 6 days later and had gotten pregnant from the guy on the 14th it wouldnt of showed.|`|FORX7yfQaa	Talk to the first partner you had and go see a doctor.|`|4DoXomHZaa	Of course you were. You ovulate about 14 days before your next period would be due, and that is the only time you can become pregnant.    The egg is viable for 24 hours and sperm can live inside for up to 5 days.    It's a shame you split...the baby is certainly your ex-bf's.
3qI1oyFaaa	1st Trimester 1-12 weeks, the most crucial development time for your baby. All his/her little organs are being formed right now.    2nd Trimester 13-28 weeks, the "honeymoon period" of pregnancy, as your little one slows development but picks up in growth. most of the vital organs are done forming at this time and steadier growth begins. it's referred to as the "honeymoon period" of pregnancy because for most, morning sickness and fatigue from the 1st trimester subside and you're not huge and miserable yet.    3rd Trimester, 29-40 weeks, the time when you and your baby both start packing on the pounds. Development is mostly completely finished in this trimester and it's pretty much all your little one accumulating fat and readying him/herself for the outside world. Babies born anytime in this trimester stand a fairly good chance for survival (with survival rates upping 3% each day).|`|4XfjUcvDaa	ist trimester is from 1-12 weeks....2nd is 13-28 weeks...3rd is 29-40.  Its the different stages of the developing baby.
9vgZNLP8aa	You shouldn't be worried and you won't look like a pansy. My son kicked the crap out of me and I would be so sore for days on end. He was also freakishly long. He was 24 inches long was he was born so I guess that would explain the ability to somehow kick every stinking inch of my body. lol :)    I actually knew a woman who was kicked so hard by her baby that she got a very faint crack in her rib! I'm telling you, woman should get a medal for all we have to go through to bring life in the world sometimes!|`|8jsoK3zdaa	i had the same thing. i should say HAVE. lol and a few days later i noticed in the spots that felt like on-coming bruises, there were tiny little veins that hurt.|`|vOgfAvMlaa	It could never hurt to ask but there is nothing that they can really do to help you. I think it would be a good idea to let your doctor know about it.   A friend of mine's baby kicked so hard that it broke her ribs so it definatly is possible that you are brusied on the inside|`|99735a22fbfaab5561850052bda71db5aa	You can't be too careful with your health or the health of your baby, and that's what your doctor is there for.  You may even want to call your doctor's office and talk to the nurse.  Describe your condition and let them help you.
Bw1h5xAcaa	I've had both, natural labors and induced. Natural labors are less intense (IMO). And as a labor nurse, I have seen many women who have had both and also report the same perception. When you're induced the contractions peak more quickly, feel more intense, and it generally feels like harder work.    But that wouldn't be my deciding factor. . . my deciding factor would be on whether the induction is necessary. A natural labor should always be the goal in a low-risk pregnancy. Inductions are huge interventions that definitely raise the risk for fetal distress and can lead to a c-section. I'd try to wait it out if it were me.     Good luck!|`|93e5e66462cba8bcd411219422deababaa	inducing give you more the chance to have a c-section. me i would wait|`|5JB1fHz9aa	I was almost a week late with my son when I got induced and he was measuring to be 9 1/2 pounds and that could go a pound either way.  I had him the next day which made me exactly a week late and I pretty much labored on my own once my water broke on its own.  Once it was time to push my contractions slowed and they gave me pitocin to help them become more regular and that sucked because it makes them stronger, but it worked and I had my son who weighed 8 pounds 8 ounces thankfully lol.  I'm due on the 14th of this month with my second and if I make it to this fridays appointment my midwife is going to schedule me an induction because this one is measuring big also, but I am still debating if I want to go through with it or not.|`|MxhNzW7Oaa	I've had both. Honestly, I prefer my induction over going into labor naturally. I was induced with my oldest at 38w4d. I had mild labor contractions and everything went very smoothly (until after delivery, but that has nothing to do with my induction.)    I went into labor naturally with my second at 32 weeks. Very very painful & totally unprepared for!    I like the fact that I KNEW when the baby was going to come and I had everything ready and prepared. There was no surprise and the whole overall experience was better for me when i was induced. Both boys were fast labor & deliveries (both under 3 hours) but I liked being comfy in the hospital bed & waiting for the delivery versus the rush of already being in labor.    Good luck!!|`|hXoUFWL1aa	My induction was terrible. I went in at 6am on Nov 2nd and didn't have my son til 9:26pm on the 3rd...38 hrs of labor with nothing to eat or drink! My body just did not want to respond to the pitocin they gave me. Anyway, when my son was one week old I had to be re-admitted to the hospital because the catheter they had in me for so long gave me a nasty bladder infection which spread to my kidneys and bloodstream..it was very dangerous. I wouldnt recommend it!|`|b5eee7836be345dc0c629dc9caf5bd55aa	I would wait it out. But if you're sick of waiting and being pregnant (which I suspect you are) maybe you should try a few of the ways to naturally induce yourself.   A lot of walking, sex, spicy foods, an entire pineapple, mangos, papaya, red raspberry leaf tea (3 cups), cumin tea (1 tbs to boiling water with cube potato at bottom and sugar/honey to sweeten) I also have bought an accupressure document that I would be glad to share if you send me your email.   I wouldn't go for the medical induction, the labor will be harder and longer. Just try some of those natural ones!!    Best of luck, hope it's real soon!|`|0fe4f3702c5dd1a403524194d3e9fabdaa	If I had the choice I would say ok Induce me. That way if she doesnt come before then I would know sorta what time & day im going to give birth. That & im so impatient I couldnt wait till the 12th to see my baby :) My mom had all 4 of her kids induced & didnt have a problem with any of them.|`|2ZoUduoPaa	I was induce in December with my first child.  Everyone gave me horror stories about it.  I was terrified going in.  All I heard was: "The contractions are horrible.  They're much worse than a "natural" labor."  That was a bunch of "hooey".  I went in at 5:30 am and they started my pitocin at 6:30 am.  The contractions weren't intense and were very far apart.  At 7 am I was 70% effaced and 3cm dilated.  At around 9:30am I got an epidural, and while I could feel some tightening during contractions, they weren't bad at all.  The pitocin increases every so often and at one point my blood pressure dropped a little (which in completely normal), so they lowered the dosage a bit.  I had a very stubborn little girl and a very narrow pelvis bone.  At 5pm the baby started trying to descend a bit more and couldn't get down into the pelvis, so she went into fetal distress (this had nothing to do with being induced).  After 30 mins, we decided a c-section was in our best interest.  And even that wasn't bad.  Everyone talks about how terrible that is, but it wasn't for me.  After the first day, I was up walking the halls with my little girl.  I was in the hospital one more day than vaginal delivery.  I was a bit sore after walking, but with the pain meds, I was fine.  I was able to lift my little (she was 7lb 14oz and 21in long) without pain.  We both did very well.  Good luck to you!!!!!|`|AA10421992	I would just let nature take it's coarse. When I carried my children they only induced labor if there was danger to the baby.  I have since can't understand why doctors today are so quick to want to say when the baby should come into this world.  My middle child was actually carried three weeks past her due date and there wasn't any problems to me or my daughter.    Wishing you all the best on the arrival of your daughter.Be sure to let me know all the details as soon as you can.  You'll be in my thoughts.|`|82d10b303e74dbe6accab663bbcd07b2aa	I was induced with my first child. The thing is... it starts with a bang. There isn't a natural progression and build up. It started strong and there were piggy back contractions as well.   I can honestly say that I enjoyed every breathing minute of the process no matter how uncomfortable it was.     Best of luck Tick Tock!|`|60b853fe7d4335e1b74668b328b358b7aa	I was induced both times and wouldn't want it any other way!!!!!!  I would actually be terrified to go into labor on my own.  I wouldn't know what to do.    The first time was medically necessary (severe preeclampsia), the 2nd time wasn't (6 days prior to due date and I asked for it- make that begged- my doctor gave in b/c of my history of preeclampsia and my blood pressure was starting to rise).  I am a "planner" and "worrier" and being induced I knew exactly what was going to happen, when, and I knew I would already be there in time for the much-needed epidural, lol.    I will say that I was 4cm when they induced me w/ Connor (and 100%) effaced.  They did it around 5:30am on Friday and my doctor told me he would be back mid-morning and I should be ready to deliver (he went back to clinic in the meantime).  I thought for sure since it was my 2nd child and my body was so ready that it would be fast.  He wasn't born until 4:01pm!!!!  I was shocked!!!|`|xXnFx6qLaa	I was induced on a Tuesday.  Went through everything, sat at the hospital all day, and at 4:30 that afternoon, the doc told me that I wasn't dilating and they sent me home to return again Wednesday morning at 7:00.  They got me started again on Wednesday, they could finally break my water, I was in and out of pain all day long, I had two epidurals and at around 8pm, my blood pressure and temperature sky rocketed and I ended up having an emergency c-section.    I honestly wish I would have waited until I went into labor on my own.
1Si9RlEXaa	It would seem hard at this stage to get him to latch, but anything is possible. If Dr. Newman (I really don't know who this is) them I would at least try it. Then you can at least say you tried it. As for your family and friends remember that it is your baby and your decision to try this. If you feel it will work for your LO then try it.    Your son has never been fed directly from the breast? I would imagine this wont happen over night, but keep trying.|`|nAOlBmzDaa	It IS weird that you are trying to do that at this stage. He should be weaned from breast/bottle by 1 ANYWAY, so WHY start now? ... that is just strange... sorry|`|1S5AbPueaa	I had to use nipple shield with my sons because of the pain and improper latch.Well instead of just using it for really bad pain I used it at every feeding.When I finally decided to stop.It was like starting breast feeding over from the beginning.It hurt like heck.I didn't give up and he learned to latch on.So i say yes it is possible with patience and dedication.|`|RqcLxDesaa	Maybe this will seem rude; but why didn't you start from birth? 8 mos is when you start introducing solids and baby will probably resist your efforts now. You should have been in contact with a group called La Leche from day 1. His instinct to 'latch on' is undeveloped and in my experience, 'self wean' didn't occur until my babies were over a year old and they nursed less and less frequently. You have gone about this completely wrong and I say go forward not back. Good luck!|`|Ot8lxaMEaa	I'm an excusively pumping mom too. My son nurses first thing in thing  in the morning and if he wakes during the night (so he was never entirely on bottles). I have thought of doing this, but worried that he wouldn't be getting enough (I have to supplement with formula occasionally). I would say to start by doing it when he is half asleep, like during the night or when he first wakes up to get him used to the idea. I hope you have been giving him bottles with nipples that are compatible with breastfeeding (wide base) otherwise he will try to latch wrong and it will cause you some pain. After that, start each feeding with the breast for as long as he will, and then offer the bottle/sippy cup of formula/breastmilk after. You might not be entirely successful, but you may be able to get him on the breast a few times a day and then transition to the sippy cup. Good luck
93e5e66462cba8bcd411219422deababaa	my son is almost 22 months and still nurses sometimes he'll go days without it- he drinks out of cups as well obviously though- i don't have as much milk anymore so it's not really for milk anymore it's more for comfort when he's upset or not feeling well. never ever thought about weaning to a bottle late in the game, what would be the point of that? he jsut got less and less interested in it|`|vue9NOhYaa	I weaned at 14 months.  She weaned from the breast to sippy cups containing whole milk, water, and juice.     (The AAP recommends at least a year, so I'd try to go a little longer if you can.  When you do wean, no reason to go to a bottle -- you'll just have to wean all over again.)|`|1S5AbPueaa	My son were both around 6 1/2 months.Since they were so young they went to the bottle and around 9 months we started using a cup too.|`|Yn2n26zXaa	My son is 13 months and going strong. I would suggest going to two year like the WHO advises. Good luck with your decision.     There is more to breastfeeding than breast milk.|`|0QYIbn1saa	10 months.  I still gave my son a bottle at night until about 13 months, but otherwise he was exclusively on sippy cups.|`|YO1w7gpiaa	Weaning my children,  the oldest was 18 mo. (I had to travel out of town)  the next was14 mo.  the next was 3 mo.  (I became suddenly ill and lost my milk)  the next was about 18 mo.  the last child was 3 yrs old.|`|QuKzGOBoaa	DD is 18 months old and still nursing. But started to eat more and more solids after 6 months old and cow's milk after a year. I am waiting for baby to wean naturally when they are ready. They nurse less and less.|`|iMMQSF7baa	I started weaning at one year.  My son's last feed on the breast was at 13 months.  We started giving my son a sippy cup at about 10 months but he still took from the bottle.  Currently we are trying to get him off of the bottle, but he still has one at night and sometime one during the day (1 out of 3 to 4 days).|`|AA11348933	My oldest daughter was 2.5 years when she weaned herself.  My youngest is 15 months old and showing no signs of weaning. There's no real reason to quit prematurely if things are going well.|`|mfpix8xkaa	First child was 6 months when I began to wean him off brest  feeding, had all the time in the world then, I slowly introduced solid food, second child, bottle-fed from birth, easier all round, felt better in myself, bonded with both babies. My advice, maybe you should be giving your child more substantial food now. Best visit your child clinic for advice. Although, if the clinics are anything like the one I attended, they would have had me breast feeding both children into their teens!!! by people who had never even had a baby. Of course that was then, not now.  At the end of the day, its your baby, your decision, you do what YOU want to do. My second baby took to the sippy cup much earlier than first. Means nothing though. each baby does things differently. Had third baby later in life, bottle-fed , started weaning 6 month also. All big healthy strapping lads, Good Luck.
orIAir11aa	When I was pregnant with my son, I had a benign ovarian cyst that developed on my right ovary. It hurt quite a bit, and when it ruptured, it caused me to spot lightly for a few days. After the cyst resolved, I had no other problems and had a healthy baby. Maybe this is what is happening to you? Your best bet is to get in touch with your doctor. I wish you the best of luck. God bless.
Dz1AvLjwaa	Well it depends on which gene made both mother and father blind by birth i.e.congenital blind.Because there can be different reasons for it.Some people  have congenital blindness, which means they are visually impaired at birth. Congenital blindness can be caused by a number of things  it can be inherited, for instance, or caused by an infection (like German measles) that's transmitted from the mother to the developing fetus during pregnancy.My 3 year old niece is suffering from it...her parents are not blind.  Although scientists are still working on it but no one can state for sure.  A Canadian team of doctors claim they have found a gene that causes congenital blindness.  So my dear friend if the man and woman have gene problem then most probably the child might be blind.|`|7QTXV0Jkaa	I don't think the child will be blind,but if the problem is a hereditary one,there are possibilities of vision problem.|`|95NYsIXUaa	lt may possible.... but consult your family doctor|`|ngtVbyQDaa	not necessary...Bcoz blindness not bCM from gene|`|co1kYF6Oaa	No, not at all.  Because, I saw a blind couple, whose children having good vision.|`|4Q3yCx5taa	it can be good vision.....[since the blindness is not a hereditary disease].
537fb036f0d7f523891b1281ae7d57d1aa	wikipedia could probably tell you everything    but I toured a diaper factory, for an engineering field trip, and was amazed at the mechanical engineering that went into the tabs (so a baby cant pull things off and choke) and leg elastics, plus the chemical engineering that went into the gels, and the materials engineering that goes into the textile of it.    Plus they send them all thru metal detectors prior to shipping out.    There are so new things - called gdiapers, or something like that, that are better for the environment.  If you are writing a paper, you could end it with developments, like this.  Diapers of the future.
fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	Generally its not a problem until they have permanent teeth.    Baby teeth are temporary (obviously) but they also have very little pulp so they can grind, chip, break (from falls), etc a lot more before its a problem (allegedly)    You SHOULD take your baby to a dentist 6 months after the eruption of their first tooth or 12 months of age whichever is earliest.  If your baby is grinding excessively there will be signs of damage and the dentist can advise you, however this behaviour is normal and rarely damages the teeth at all.      http://www.askdrsears.com/faq/az40.asp  In general, grinding the baby teeth is not a problem. It is often a sign of teething, very likely for a 12 month old. When he starts losing his baby teeth, the grinding should stop (if it even lasts that long). If he is grinding his adult teeth, then that is a different story, and a dentist should be consulted to look for damage. He might suggest that a tooth guard be worn while sleeping.      http://www.drgreene.org/body.cfm?id=21&a...  Like sucking on pacifiers and thumbs, grinding the teeth (called bruxism) is a common habit that usually disappears on its own as young children grow. The two peak periods of bruxism are as the baby teeth arrive in very young children and again at 5 or 6 as the permanent teeth begin to come in. Grinding could slowly damage the enamel of the teeth, but the baby teeth do not remain in place long enough for that to be a concern. The habit usually stops long before permanent damage to the adult teeth occurs. In the short run nothing needs to be done, but anything relaxing before bed might help (a warm bath, a backrub, some soothing music, some chamomile tea). If the bruxism continues, your dentist might provide a temporary appliance to break the habit of nighttime grinding.     http://www.babycenter.com/0_teeth-grindi...  Why does my toddler grind his teeth?    Experts don't know for sure what causes teeth grinding, but they point fingers at tension or anxiety, pain (from earaches or teething, for example), and malocclusion (a dental term for when the teeth don't line up just right). Some also suggest that allergies may play a role. And there's some evidence that pinworms are sometimes the culprit. Finally, your toddler may just be getting used to the sensation of having teeth in his mouth.    Your child is a bit more likely to grind his teeth if you do. He's also more likely to grind if he drools or talks in his sleep.    About 38 percent of children grind their teeth, according to a 2005 study published in the Journal of Dentistry for Children. The average age for starting the habit is around 3 1/2 years and the average age for stopping is 6  though, of course, people of all ages grind their teeth. Almost all teeth grinding happens at night.  Is it bad for him?    In most cases, teeth grinding isn't harmful. It's very unlikely that your toddler's doing any damage to his teeth, and it's very likely that he'll soon outgrow the habit. Mention it to his dentist, though, so she can check the teeth for wear and any resulting problems, like pulp exposure, cavities, and fractures.  Can I do anything to help him stop?    Although the noise is probably disconcerting, most likely you'll just have to wait for your toddler to grow out of it. In the meantime, it won't hurt to work on a soothing bedtime routine  maybe a leisurely soak in the tub, a little back rub, or extra cuddling in the rocking chair. If he's teething or has an ear infection, consider giving him the proper dose of acetaminophen or ibuprofen to ease the discomfort.    Older children are sometimes fitted with a night guard  a plastic device fitted to the mouth to prevent clenching and grinding of the teeth during sleep. But your child's dentist probably won't consider this an option until your child has at least some permanent teeth, around age 6.|`|93e5e66462cba8bcd411219422deababaa	it's normal- my fiance's aunt works at an orthodontists office and they said it was completely normal and they usually stop when they get use to having those teeth. my son did it and he got over it- if i made a big deal about it he would have done it more|`|7uy8iy7laa	The little girl I babysit did it all the time. It's toltally normal. She used to do it when-ever she was teething and her teeth were hurting her. She just recently stopped though. :) it's nothing to worry about.  Just give him something to chew on.   Hope this helps! :D|`|tmh42R6Caa	There's not much you can do to stop it at this point.  My son did the same thing when he started getting teeth.  He quickly stopped.  I think he's just getting used to them.|`|RwoN3E9Uaa	How funny, my daughter started doing this last night!  She has her two bottom in fully and the two top are slightly in.  I think it is just her way of getting used to the teeth.  He will stop in time, no harm done...|`|50lIaC8zaa	My daughter also grindes her teeth, ive noticed she does it more when shes getting another one through, I have never tried to stop her as im not really sure how to lol, from what i remember my 6 year old use to do it as well and her teeth are fine.    I wouldn't worry to much as long as he isn't doing it all the time.|`|f27ac1251735cd69b33683d739d56466aa	They do that because it is new to them. He will stop eventually. Why not give him a biter bits cracker or maybe even a cold, clean washcloth to chew on.
FcHplZtQaa	Seems fine to me!    Babies who are on solids should be getting 20oz of milk per day, 20oz = 1pint!|`|75NM6Zhtaa	Hi there I do not know what age your baby is,however does she ever get plain boiled water to drink (cooled of course)? I found with my sons a drink of water was very acceptable and they now as adults drink water,which seems these days unsual as many children nowadays expect squash .   I would say if your baby is content and gaining weight you are  doing very well ,babies do tend to let you know if they are not happy.    Best of luck|`|YXWmaOryaa	hey, how old is she and how long has she been on solids for?    EDIT: right, yes that sounds about right for 11 months....they say from about 7 months  when your baby is fully weaned she should get roughly 3 7oz bottles each day, (so she shoud be getting approx 21 ozs, doesnt matter how or when she takes them.) By about 12 months these can be cut and her meals made bigger so that she is eventually sustained with 3 meals a day like you and I, and can also have healthy snacks etc throughout the day. If your daughter is hungry though Im sure she will let you know (I know mine does lol) Finger food snacks such as baby rice cakes etc are a great way to develop hand eye co-ordination and to develop feeding herself (if she isnt already) so you could try introducing a snack inbetween lunch and dinner if you wanted to or if she has been really active some days she may be hungrier than others. Anywya hope this helps!! (p.s have you tried baby signing its a great way for your baby to tell you she is hungry!!) all the best xx|`|YfTk9f56aa	It all depends on her age and what she is eating food wise.  My 7 month daughter (4 month corrected as she was prem) is having 25oz milk a day and then 3 half baby jars for breakfast lunch and dinner.    It looks to me though that you are constantly feeding her, where do you find time to feed yourself??      In my opinion, and remember it is an opinion, not an instruction, but I would try to get her to have more milk in one go.  My daughter feeds at 7am, 11am, 2pm and 6pm.  7am is a full 9oz bottle and 6pm she has a full 9oz bottle also with her half jar of food.|`|vue9NOhYaa	How old is she? It looks fine for an older baby.  If she's hungry, she'll let you know.|`|ac4b51e4dd9a1ac339ede85a6869a7a1aa	Depends how old she is - more info needed.  If she is newborn - too much!  If she is 18, no.|`|MoLQsZeXaa	yes|`|cypZ0ykXaa	first tell us whats her age???????
NwNBswpuaa	oh my goodness... please dear god read this book called 'taking charge of your fertility'  doesn't sounds like you're preg.
kbdkOPHDaa	my first born will be 3 in april, so she is 35 months, (over 2 and a half) and i just had my son in dec. he is 9 weeks. they are pretty close together.     let me tell ya, i am a BUSY woman. this is the only time i will get to sit down today- because my son is taking a nap...my daughter took it pretty well. i think at first she was a little taken back by not being with us while we were int he hospital because she stayed with my mom, and when she saw us she was kinda mad but she LOVED her brother. she thinks he is so neat. she shows him toys and talks to him and she always wants to hold him (with my supervision of course) and feed him. she watches as i bathe him.    about the jelousy thing, you gotta even it out. the new baby is new so its fun and stuff but you gotta give the first one the same amount of attention...everytime my mom comes over she always talks to my daughter (first born) first, and gives her attention and then takes the baby.    whatever feels right is right. maybe talk to your first about being a brother/sister.    good luck!|`|79F1VhEJaa	well my brother and i are 2 years apart, and 1 year apart in school, and its great, we fight sometimes but we are also close, it think that it will be fine.|`|397b528338dbd9036ae6de0f84b8f817aa	there is 2 years and 1 months between my brother and i. apparently he loved me as a baby and would want to hold me and sit by my side for hours.    my children are 7 years about and thats cool too, the older one is a big help.|`|JJ60Ppdvaa	i was born 7 years behind my older, dont do that, and i was born 4 years before my younger, thats ok but 2 sounds like the sweet spot to me|`|W1JSp0blaa	i think its the perfect time period for a gap ...   not too lesss and not too much     go for it ... u r ready    i have 2 daughters that are 1 year apart .. so my gal was only 1 when i had the second one.. she didnt even noticed that she had a  baby sister  at that time   and eversince my older one turned 2... she wanted a baby  .. she still asks me to get a baby for her (shes 3 now)  so i think 2 years is the perfect time|`|dXcm5971aa	My mom had me 10 years after my sisters- I swear! They are adults now, while I'm in middle school!!!|`|HWYiTOSkaa	I dont but my friend has 5 kids and they are all about 2-3  years apart. The oldest is 13(boy)  and the youngest is just a toddler. So cute. But she doesnt have any regrets. She thinkn its easier to have space cuz then there wont be any problems with competition later on...|`|7f5af7e7fb02a50e93290cbababdc097aa	I have 4 kids and another on the way.  My oldest will be 13 next month. When my 2nd was born she was 5  years old.When my 3rd was born my 2nd was 4. When I had my 4th, my 3rd was 20 months.  When this baby is born, my youngest will be turning 2, the same month, so they will be 24 months apart. From my experience, having the kids gapped further apart was MUCH easier on ME. Having two little ones , is a big PITA.  But with that said, for the kids' sake they really enjoy each others company. My 7, 3 and 1 year old all play good together and they are never bored or lonely. My oldest has moments where she plays with them a too, but being so much okder she is more into "big kid" stuff, and gets annoyed with her siblings.  Shehas tried to convince her Dad and I to adopt a girl more her age as well.  The best thing for her having all these little kids around tho is she has told me she is NOT having kids and its a good thing I have all these other kids to give me grandkids, because she is not! Lol I figured at least its been good birth control for her :p.  But seriously they all do love each other and as long as everyone stays out of my oldest daughters room everything is good :)
fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	Milk spraying out is a sign of overactive letdown, which can be separate from oversupply but they usually go hand in hand.    Oversupply and overactive letdown are not necessarily problems, but usually they do have some effect, some of the common ones are:  1) Plugged ducts and mastitis in mom  2) Baby swallowing excess air  3) Baby disliking comfort nursing which leads them to suck their thumbs or pacifier   4) Baby gets too much "foremilk" and has digestive discomfort from it.  5) Baby gets used to the fast flow and when it does finally slow down (and it will usually between 9-12 months in moms with an oversupply) they may get upset and go on strike.    There are things you can do to help baby deal with the faster flow or to reduce your supply.  Certainly if you have had problems with plugged ducts or mastitis I would recommend reducing your supply. Because he is unlatching a lot I would recommend at least doing the tips to help him control the flow, but probably you should try to reduce your supply since he is 3 months and that's long past the normal duration of excess milk (common the first 6-8 weeks)    http://www.kellymom.com/bf/supply/fast-l...  Is forceful let-down the problem?    Does your baby do any of these things?        * Gag, choke, strangle, gulp, gasp, cough while nursing as though the milk is coming too fast      * Pull off the breast often while nursing      * Clamp down on the nipple at let-down to slow the flow of milk      * Make a clicking sound when nursing      * Spit up very often and/or tend to be very gassy      * Periodically refuse to nurse      * Dislike comfort nursing in general    If some of this sounds familiar to you, you probably have a forceful let-down. This is often associated with too much milk (oversupply). Some mothers notice that the problems with fast letdown or oversupply don't start until 3-6 weeks of age. Forceful let-down runs the gamut from a minor inconvenience to a major problem, depending upon how severe it is and how it affects the nursing relationship.       What can I do about it?    There are essentially two ways you can go about remedying a forceful let-down: (1) help baby deal with the fast flow and (2) take measures to adjust your milk supply down to baby's needs. Since forceful let-down is generally a byproduct of oversupply, most moms will be working on both of these things. It may take a couple of weeks to see results from interventions for oversupply, so try to be patient and keep working on it.     http://breastfeeding.hypermart.net/toomu...  Although it is quite normal to worry that you don't have enough milk for your baby (see "Is My Baby Getting Enough?"), many moms actually wish they had less milk. These women are said to have overabundant milk supplies, also known as hyperlactation syndrome, when the supply is more than what is needed by the baby. Often, these moms will suffer with frequently engorged breasts that many times lead to bothersome leaking and plugged ducts and breast infections. Their babies may seem fussy a lot, many times exhibiting colic-like symptoms with excessive gas and spitting-up (and even vomiting). These same babies may also have consistently green, watery stools and gain more than the typical 1/2-1 ounce a day during the first 4 months. They also tend to nurse frequently from both breasts, sometimes as often as every hour. Some babies may clamp down on or fold over the nipple during feeding as a means to slow the flow of milk down, especially if mother also has a forceful letdown (see below). Often the nipple will be white at the end of the feeding and/or creased and feedings will probably be painful. The baby may periodically refuse to nurse due to his frustration at "keeping up with the milk".       (Picture of milk spraying)  http://www.breastfeeding-basics.com/html...      http://www.normalfed.com/Continuing/gulp...  Gaining, Gulping, Grimacing?         Is your baby thriving but nursing is a struggle?  See if many of these sound familiar:        * My baby chokes and gulps and splutters when she nurses, especially at the beginning.      * My breasts always feel full, or they spray when they let down.      * My baby "wrestles" with my breast, pulling off, coming back on as if she's starving, pulling away and crying, backing off once she has the nipple in her mouth, arching.      * My baby has lots of went and poopy diapers perhaps even with streaks of blood.      * My baby is colicky, or gassy, or spits up frequently.      * My baby sometimes - or always - has frothy or greenish stools.      * My baby is gaining rapidly, or grew fast at first with weight gain dropping as fussiness increased.      * My baby rarely falls asleeep at my breast; nursing is an athletic event rather than a peaceful one.      * My baby will nurse only for food, not for comfort.      * My baby grimaces when she nurses, as if there's something wrong with my milk, or she frequently seems to have uncomfortable intestines.      * I try to make a point of nursing on both breasts each time.      * If it's been less than two hours, I look for some cause for fussiness other than hunger.|`|1S5AbPueaa	Wow! I wouldn't be alarmed it sounds like you got enough milk> I would freeze extras too.I had a low supply and had to stop nursing at 6 months with both of my sons:(At the 6 month mark they stopped gaining weight and started losing even though they were also eating solids.|`|aWkp6AJOaa	i don't have the milk spray you do but i have an abundance of milk.  be glad you have this "problem".  i was pumping & getting so much out that i had to buy a fridge just for the freezer part.  :)  i don't think this would be a problem.  i know some women that can hardly produce enough milk for their baby.  i think you just have a fast let down.  if it is too much for him try & pump a little first & then let him latch on.  but sounds like he is handling it well.  good luck.  i would just buy some of the storage bags & freeze your leftovers.|`|stUzx5VVaa	As long as he's not having any problems eating, don't worry about it.  It's not going to hurt anything by having too much milk at this point, and your milk will adjust eventually.|`|RwoN3E9Uaa	You would see a problem in the diapers if you had an oversupply.  Just keep feeding on demand and don't worry that you can pump out 4 oz - I can too!  When I had an oversupply I was pumping a full bottle in 2-3 minutes.  My daughter had a terrible gassy belly and had green explosive poops all day long from the milk imbalanced caused by the oversupply.    If you son is nursing successfully without fuss and crying than he has already gotten used to your fast flow, no worries.|`|deIzFnV8aa	So you do sound like you have a lot of milk - I wish my pumping sessions went that well!  The main problems this could cause for you are being sore from engorgement, and an increased probability of clogged ducts as a result. You don't sound as if you were sore, though, and nursing is the best way to prevent clogged ducts.  The main problem for babies in this case is the milk comes out too fast and they have to gulp and can choke a bit. If your son is used to this by now, though, it isn't a problem. It does mean he might take in a lot of air while nursing, so burp him well.  Also, you can use your hand to kind of pinch your nipple to slow down the flow, if it is a problem. However, if he is eating fine and you aren't sore or anything, I don't see any problem.|`|AA11903503	My son and I am the same, he is 5 weeks old. I have a very fast let down, he can finish in about 5-10 minutes, I do have an over supply (never seems to be empty), I can pump even more than 4oz if I massage my breasts in about 8minutes. If my son unlatches we are both soaked within a second, and he gulps.  The only problems I have had so far are engorgement, and green poop in my son (i think he might be getting too much foremilk). He is also very gassy and fussy on the breast at times. The lactation consultant told me to try things like pumping an ounce before feeding him so he gets the hindmilk sooner and he'll be satisfied longer, to feed from one breast for 2 feedings if its only been 2 hours, and to try different ways to lower my supply and see if that helps.
HNnVrvCfaa	I like Lydia as a first name as it has two syllables and two syllable names go well with one syllable surnames.|`|aHWDZiLaaa	I like it!|`|8mchLCQhaa	I think it is pretty. I personally knew a girl that I didnt like with the name Lydia but I think it is cute.|`|WoxHi03eaa	It's lovely, but the --Jade Cox bit is a bit awkward. The "D" and the "C" sounds don't really flow. What about Lydia Marie Cox?|`|fXj2kVpPaa	I like Jade Cox.  Jacob and Jade....now that is cool!!!!|`|xXnFx6qLaa	Awww, I think that's pretty! :)|`|GFzDwIk6aa	I don't like it, but it does flow.|`|mRQxlNH5aa	It flows very nicely. Very pretty!|`|eabe4c3a6e53ede1a2078c8d7dfcf4b7aa	yup..at least it's not Anita.. I knew a woman once names Anita Cox....say it fast and think about it...lol|`|7uy8iy7laa	It's beautiful! I think it flows very well. :)|`|R0sfdiNeaa	flows well and very beautiful names together|`|tWKZVDG2aa	Yeah that is a lovely name.  I really like the name Lydia.  Will there be a middle name?|`|ZX2so3twaa	it's cute :]  no middle name?|`|FvYqKZSMaa	It flows very well.|`|0Nfr3leOaa	awww it sounds cute|`|KOcCenrEaa	I like the name Lydia alot.  I think it flows fine.|`|xrJqmRFqaa	Yes.|`|iZDsMCghaa	Love the name, but not sure the three flow very well but good enough. Its really the Jade Cox that sounds a little choppy. But not so bad I wouldnt use it, its a good choice.    ADD:: Well, the good news here is that Lydia jade sounds absolutely beautiful and rarely if ever will someone call her by the full name and when they do, its still going to sound pretty. Maybe Jada Cox but I still think Lydia flows better.
KrkftOfkaa	Hey KKingS,    She IS living off your tax dollars, at least in the state of CA and some Federal programs.  She has no job, the state covered her invetro, all of her kids are effectively premature from low birth weight, and care from that level is going to be about $1/2 million EACH by the time they are able to leave the hospital.  Any money she gets from talk shows should be routed into the babies' care before she gets to touch a dime.|`|Fh4B88ZGaa	I hope the doctor who agreed to do this loses his/her license.|`|2448af06b59df00dd8a1a3ac6d057c75aa	i think shes nuts and i am with you we are glamorous these family's|`|Dhsyroekaa	I know!!! and whos going to pay for all those kids and for her to be a lazy ***??? WE WILL BE! WELFARE. I f*ckin hate her!|`|cj7sSPZEaa	Just a quick side note- but the whole thumbs down thing is stupid- people won't give thumbs ups for good answers- they give thumbs downs just because they don't agree.  I'm sure you gave a great answer.  Anyway---   That woman is very sad.  She's going to use her children to make money for herself.  She definitely needs to mature a little more.  I hope her mother kicks her out.  What was she planning on doing for her kids before she found out there were so many in there?  How was she planning on supporting them?  And how was she supporting her 6 kids?  It sounds like maybe her mother was enabling her without realizing it.|`|em8A42Bqaa	The Duggars and the Gosslins are married and I beleive that they didnt set out to have multiples.  The Gosslins wanted 3 kids and I dont know about the Duggars, but the kids seem well rounded!  IDK about this other woman|`|7SKVCPcSaa	i figured she would pull some crap like that too.  and yay for her mom for stepping up and making a good point.  but that woman, the mom of the million kids, does definitely need professional help. when you have a million babies just to get attention and a tv show.. damn, you have serious issues!|`|3fcf101a2615a631d556e32ec980eae0aa	Personally, I STILL don't care what she is doing...as long as she isn't living off my tax dollars.  Exploiting yourself and kids for money is sad...but she certainly isn't the first and won't be the last.|`|cYRZpGkqaa	I think it's crazy. I was floored when I heard about it. But my opinion... I think we should pray for those babies in the hospital... They aren't in the clear yet. They didn't ask for this. And I also don't think it would do any harm to check out the show. Just because everyone is enraged about this doesn't mean she isn't a good mother. Maybe she made bad choices, but that doesn't necessarily make her a bad person. We know basically nothing about her. I don't think it's fair to judge her. As for the money, those producers already have so much money that it's pocket change for them.|`|MQ34YW28aa	i just find the whole thing to be fishy. she's 23 and already had 6 kids?? what doctor would do invetro to a 23 year old that already had 6 kids. I think he should be fired, i think the father has a cult going on or something and making his daughter pop all these kids out and paid the doctor a lot of money to do it i think.|`|8oAlBL91aa	What I'm trying to figure out is why someone gave her invitro without a job don't you have to pay for that? I have no clue.     Well she needs some form of money and now that the media is going away from her she needs to spot light her self somehow and I heard she wouldn't talk unless paid. Your right though. I wouldn't watch her show either probably for the same reason why I stopped watching jon and kate because there only about the money and using there kids to make the money.    EDIT* But guess what as of right now she is living off our tax dollars. Where do you think she is getting those diapers, I'm sure she has to use both formula and breast milk that's not cheap of course there is WIC but I don't know if all states have that, clothing, bills, food....Where is she getting the money for that...Welfare of course.|`|DXh2BlCraa	"It costs money to raise children. To raise these kids is probably going to cost about $2.5 million, just to give them basics," he said. "That is not baseball lessons or piano lessons. That is food, clothing or getting to school every day -- that is a lot of money."|`|e90a8e2ee095e648a3f92f15f7959eb6aa	I totally agree!  And, yes, she is living off our tax dollars!  She doesn't have a job, thus, no insurance.  So, who's paying for all these babies right now?  Yep, we are!  I hope she gets all the kids taken away from her.  She doesn't want children...she wants babies.  Well, babies grow up!  Who ever her doctor was should have his license revoked and put in jail.  It's horrible!
xib2cBIJaa	I asked my wife and she has just had a baby and she says its because your hips are widening so the baby can come out easier.  Her hips hurt in the be gaining and then her ribs hurt later.|`|zuZKj3xXaa	yup. that was the most painful thing ive ever went through! at work, i stand 14 hrs a day...i could almost feel my hips Spreading.. like physically feel them spreading! and here i am, having to stand all thos hrs :( omg it hurt..... i couldn't take any medication for the pain, my hips spread really fast, the only marks i have on my body are the ones from when they were spreading.. it was MISERABLE. constant pain, the only time they really wernt hurting was when i was sitting in my recliner at an angle :) i loved my recliner!! ha ha ha hopfully you already have some hips lol cause getting them that fast, hurts like a *****!     36 weeks and 4 days! with a baby GIRL!|`|VRiz80tqaa	I'm going on 32 weeks preggo and my hips hurt more and more each day! Joys of pregnancy I guess! There is a hormone released when you're pregnant that helps the muscles start to relax to prepare your body for childbirth.|`|ZbJ0bx3Uaa	Yes, the increased pressure from your uterus growing and the added water and blood and baby all put a lot of weight on your hips.|`|VmqOq8Qjaa	o yea|`|7SKVCPcSaa	yep!|`|fmr98EBtaa	How early is early? Either way, I would say it is normal so long as the pain is not excruciating, in which case I would recommend speaking with your doctor.|`|t6OGh0Edaa	Definately! It has only gotten worse for me the further I get!|`|uRuoINt0aa	hi, dear..    i think yes its normal but the pain should not be severe i 'm also having some pain there but its on & off type & its mainly when i sit for a longer time in one position...try to take a walk when you feel pain there just for 2 to 3 minutes & you will slowly feel better...    hope i have helped..!!
W0d6NsGBaa	Ultrasounds are VERY different today then they were back 20 years ago....they are much more vivid. So if she couldnt get good angles then I would request another ultrasound. You also didnt mention how far along you were....if you are past 20 weeks then you could also do a 3d ultrasound (you would have to pay for it)....unless the baby is very stubborn those are really hard to mess up! 70% is a good percentage but I dont think I would settle with it......|`|uRuoINt0aa	hi, dear..    i think you should just believe on what your scanner said as they won't make a 70% guess...well many women will tell you that they were told a boy & they got a girl & vica versa but that is not the case with every1..    but if you feel confused you can ask for another scan..hope you find out the right thing asap..!!    hope this helps you..|`|8mchLCQhaa	I was told my son was a girl! I didn't find out til he was bron that he was a him. and they said 90% a girl. Wow were they wrong!|`|0edad872accfa7019b8218de1c740bcbaa	Yeap.  My boss lady said her second one was suppose to be a boy and then came out a baby girl.  They had three days to pick a girl's name.  The girl has no complain on her first name, but dislike her middle name a whole lot.  She's now 8 yrs old.|`|ed052b6f800dc43932558f491194a7b8aa	i was told boy but only once the tech was 100% sure and showed us so we were  70% is good odds but maybe get checked again if u not convinced|`|NPmRmnG6aa	My mom was told I was a boy about I am a girl. But this was in the 80's and the doctor guessed by my size ( i was 9 lbs almost 10lsb ) and not from what he saw on the screen.|`|7SKVCPcSaa	my mom was told i was a boy... and here i am.. no penis.. no..|`|9vgZNLP8aa	Not me, but I have a friend who had that happen to her. She was told the 3 times at 3 different ultrasounds that she was having a girl and then at the very end of her pregnancy they had to do another ultrasound for some reason (can't remember why) and they told her she was having a boy! Low and behold she had her boy a few weeks later.    It sucked for her cause she already had everything bought for a little girl.
NC1yS0H5aa	i know exactly what you mean. my daughter is already 18 months and i never let her just cry and i definitely would not even consider that for a five month old. you are right you can not spoil a baby with love attention attentiveness and empathy. you are building a strong bond of trust that lasts. my babies grandma is always saying we should let her cry herself to sleep or if she is upset put her in the other room alone to cio. i really think that just sets up a bad relationship with your child and teaches them that you can turn off emotionally to them. we all know babies model behavior so they will learn to turn off to you emotionally too. i think it is an old school way of childrearing. i just tell her no that is not how we choose to raise our child and request that she respects our wishes. if i find out she practices cio with my daughter when she visits her once a week. i will not hesitate to limit her visits because it is emotionally damaging imo. it is your baby so you can raise her how you want and feel good about and they have to accept it|`|4f3cauAmaa	I say hold your baby as often as you feel the need to.They need that sense of security in your arms before you know it they will be to big to carry although never to big to be held. so enjoy carrying your little angel.|`|sHKrDChwaa	I 've heard that more times than I can remember.. a lot of it does comes with a "spoiled baby" remark. I don't feel very good about letting my baby girl just cry, so yeah.. I pick her up and love on her. I usually give the "my first baby" excuse followed by something along the lines of "she's gonna spend the next 18 years trying to get away from me.. I'm gonna get all I can now!" I can't feel bad about taking care of my child the way I feel I should. After all all no one parents the exact same way, right?|`|3CVfUiiJaa	My own mother told me that I was going to spoil my son because I pick him up whenever he cries.  And when he was 4 months old and we spent a week with her, she commented that I barely ever let my son cry.  Honestly I think that is a good thing.     I told my mom that I am not going to spoil him, and if in the end it did end up being a bad thing that we would deal with it.  I was not going to let my so cry to please her or anyone else. Keep on with what you are doing.   Every mother is going to parent differently...even in the same family!  Your daughter won't be spoiled at her age.|`|dc49d60c4d19a92e193ce2f41c92cfedaa	You can spoil a baby because it's letting them know that all they have to do is whine and they will get what they want but it's your baby and you can do whatever you want to. So just tell them to mind their own and if they want to give parenting advise then to have a baby of their own and they can practice it on their own kids all they want|`|Hub1UGqPaa	Simply say (with a smile):  mind your own damned business, this is my child and I'll hold her as much as I want.      I held my babies as much as possible....and they're not spoiled.  Enjoy them being babies.  Hold them, love them.  Don't go by the books.  It's YOUR child.|`|gGW7K9U5aa	I get that all the time. My daughter is 8 months old and when someone says that to me that Im spoiling her, I just tell them "I like to do things my own way"  Or I tell them, "Yeah I spoil her, O well"  They dont say anything after those remarks.|`|2eae4bf1e3779c435068e2d7d68a747faa	I agree with the first answerer.   I am getting too much unwanted advice so now all I am doing is saying Thank you with a smile on my face and go on about raising my baby my way. I am the one who have to deal with crying all the time so I might as well find a way to console him.|`|GmTMVmASaa	you raise your baby your way, and i'll raise mine my way. tell them that.|`|bc29eaf19302ac3e6d0492b8facf1027aa	There actually have been studies done on the physiological effects of prolonged crying in an infant- it's similar to the valsalva maneuver and the baby's brain ends up being deprived of oxygen during crying.  Trust your mother's instincts and tend to your baby.  They cry to communicate a need, even if that need is close human contact.|`|k4gxs7a3aa	i don't have any children but I absolutely hate it when a baby is spoiled so you shouldn't spoil them because they will grow up being cry babbies and who likes a crybaby?>|`|MeYILJeSaa	Oh lord-yes, it drives me nuts. What, am I supposed to let him scream?   I don't pick him up every time he fusses, but I do acknowledge him. I'll bend over and talk to him, etc. But my mother in-law thinks I should let him cry-like full-on screaming.   I just say "It's impossible to spoil a baby" but I say it like I'm talking to him; in my baby voice, looking at him. I think she's finally gotten the picture.|`|jrVlzffeaa	I had this ALOT with my son, I don't let him cry and held him constantly when he was younger and people used to say, why do you hold him so much? Why don't you put him down now that you've nursed him to sleep, but I never listened to them and do you know what? Now that's all people say to me now is how come he's such a calm mellow baby 15 month old? An di honestly think it's coz I used to hold him and carry around everywhere and never let him cry, so I think I shocked people, especially my MIL. I just told them I kept holding him coz I love him and I like sharing body heat!! lol. Don't listen to silly people like that Xx|`|qZml9VRmaa	I totally understand you but just know people are giving you some advice from their past experience and theres no need for you to take it offensive. Once that baby is a year old or older shes going to want you to carry her every time she cries or wants something. I know parents always want to give theire kids all the attention and anything they need. Especially when we see those little tears rolling down their cheeks. But just know sometimes we have to be strong and hard on them and make them understand they cant get it their way every time. I know shes to small for her to understand but shell get the point when you dont pick her up. Just some advice I know you wont listen to it but wait a couple of months or years and you wont get no rest, sore back and all Take care and if you dont want to be rude when someone tells you something just ignore them. Or just say Im sorry but this is my child and I can raise him/her the way I want too that will shut them up. Take care and best of luck to you and your beautiful baby! ?|`|f27ac1251735cd69b33683d739d56466aa	Anytime anyone had any opinions about me and my child, I let them have their say -- is their opinion and I don't have to agree with it so I would just smile back and give absolutely no response because well, everyone is entitled to think and to have their say.  After all, they don't know your baby like you do.|`|PYSMK0JBaa	do what your gut says to do, forget everyone else. YOU know best.|`|3GHXk05saa	I don't have any kids and I got ripped on another question where others thought a baby should be allowed to cry, and not just a wimper but scream to the point of exhaustion, and I'll take my lumps here again, I guess, but:  You are NOT spoiling your daughter. Babies cry for a reason, and sometimes that reason is just to be sure Mom is there. They know how helpless they are and if you let them cry too long they begin to mistrust their own instincts and you. It can also raise blood pressure and cause other physical distress in the baby. Letting a baby cry repeatedly and at length can cause social and psychological developmental issues.  You can't spoil a baby. A three year old is another matter, but you'll find if you respond to your child the first time they need you, they will respond to you the same and they'll be less terrible when they're two.  I can tell you as an aunt of 9 children 15-33 years old now that the ones who were allowed to scream had more difficulties growing up than those who were attended to, and the non-screamers are by no means spoiled. They're the ones with good jobs and college educations and one family has two kids, one they let scream, the other not and they follow the same pattern, so it's not just one set of kids having different parents all along.  Here's an excerpt  For decades, the advice from respected child development specialists and pediatricians such as best-selling authors William Sears ("The Baby Book") and Penelope Leach ("Your Baby and Child"), as well as a host of organizations such as the American Academy of Pediatrics, Zero to Three National Center for Infants, Toddlers and Families, the Brazelton Touchpoint Institute at Children's Hospital, and Brigham and Women's Hospital, is to respond to a crying baby as quickly as possible, especially a baby under 3 months old but including up to 6 months.    "Here's what I tell parents," says Sears, a pediatrician in San Clemente, Calif., who is known as the father of attachment parenting, a practice based on a high degree of responsiveness. "When in doubt, put yourself behind the eyes of your baby and ask yourself, `If I were my baby, what would I want my mother or father to do?' "    Most of the time, that means parents will -- and in his mind, should -- pick up a crying baby.    "The more we know about brain development, the more we know that when a mother is not responsive, it's linked to [poor] cognitive development and social behavior," says Leach. "The hazard is of a child with too little conviction that he is really loved, as in unconditional love. If you don't respond to him when he cries, he comes to distrust the validity of his own feelings and your willingness to respond to them."    I would tell the well meaning ones that you're the mom and you're doing as you feel is best. If they argue, you can show them the studies that back up your position.  For the jerks, well, tell them that you're not too lazy to love your baby and you're sorry they are.|`|h85kkDsbaa	i always pick my son up if he cries, hes crying for a reason and i hate just listening to him cry.

Don't let other people make you feel bad for loving your child.

People would run the whole gambit of "suggestions" with me.  Honestly it drove me crazy.  Spoiling was the big one.  Honestly, how can you spoil a 5 month old?      My grandmother is the one who actually set me straight on other peoples advice.  She told me that as a 90 year old woman...her fondest memories of her children was when she was holding them.  Time is fleeting, hold your little ones as much as you can, because all too soon, they are grown up.    I have taken her words to heart.  When people come up to me now with advice...I simply tell them thank you for their concern, but you honestly cannot spoil a baby...and I leave it at that.  If they have a problem with that.  Tough.  It is not their child.    Time is indeed fleeting...my Grandmother passed away 7 years ago, and my first is now 8.  With number 4 on the way, I continue to take her words seriously.  Other peoples opinions are just that, opinions.  They have no merit, unless you give them merit.
jsdDgIuRaa	I would try to avoid a humidifier, maybe when he has a cold but otherwise they are a pain.  You have to clean them very often, at least twice weekly to avoid bacteria/mildew/mold inside them and they can cause mold to grow in your home, which is NOT what you want. We used to use one a lot until it caused mold to grow because of the moisture so I stopped using them.  Believe me you would rather have dry air than mold!    I would only use a Vicks vaporizer when he is sick, not all the time.  We have one of the plug in ones and it works great.    Edit: I just read the first person's answer and totally agree.|`|f27ac1251735cd69b33683d739d56466aa	At night we do not need to have heat turned all the way up to 75 degrees. We cut our heating down to 65 at night because we are after all under blankets, so in our case we don't need humidifiers.   We use to wake up with stuffy nose and dry mouth prior to cutting heat down. Try cutting your heat down at night prior to going to bed and see if this helps. If it still doesn't help, still lower your heat and turn on the humidifier, which it would be better in keeping moisture in the air.  Also remind you that humidifier you need to clean it at leat 3 times a week otherwise you will get mold growing on it and also change the filter on a regular basis.  Try to air out the room as much as possible too because moisture can gather in the walls and windows with the use of a humidifier creating mold and this can create a bigger problem for you.|`|ba1de16220287f2a6ca02288c1a71636aa	We run a humidifier every night in our bedroom. My 3 month old son sleeps in our bedroom and seems to sleep better with the humidifier on.  I wash it every other night so that mildew and bacteria don't grow in it.  It works for us.

fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	Of course all babies self-wean.  Just like the all learn to walk, talk, smile, etc assuming they are physically able.    The average age of self-weaning is 3 years.  However anywhere from 2-7 years is normal; but the vast majority wean between 2.5 and 3.5 years in Western culture.    Of course it is better to let your child develop at their own pace.    http://www.llli.org//llleaderweb/LV/LVMa...  After attending a recent Southern California Area Conference, I am convinced that there is much confusion in LLL about the term "baby-led weaning." The phrase itself seems to be misleading, particularly since LLL's concept statement says "Ideally the breastfeeding relationship will continue until the baby outgrows the need," not even mentioning the term "baby-led weaning."    To some Leaders, baby-led weaning seems to imply that mother does nothing, or should do nothing, and that total responsibility for weaning must be given to the child. Now I will agree that with an infant, the control of how long and how often that baby should nurse really does lie with the child alone and rightly so. We cannot begin to know or guess when the baby will be hungry, or how much he needs at each feeding, or whether or not he just wants to nurse for comfort.    However, as that child grows, develops, discovers, and expands his capabilities, our relationship changes and it should change. We begin to know the child and can often anticipate his needs. We can tell by his actions when he is hungry, tired, overstressed, or bored. We can recognize whether he needs to go potty, when he needs to be held, or whether he needs to be given attention in other ways. I can often tell that my son needs a nap even though he says he is not tired. I lie down beside him, maybe read him a story, perhaps rub his back or nurse him, and within minutes this child who said he was not tired is fast asleep.    As a child grows and develops, we can sense when he is ready for various new steps. We do not force these steps, but we are active in leading and encouraging change and progress as the child shows readiness and capabilities for these changes. We do not expect a child to learn to walk, use the toilet, or ride a bike totally on his own. We give him help and encouragement and teach him the skills he needs to use while we lead him gently step by step. It would be cruel to just say "you're on your own kid and you have to learn how to do this by yourself," without offering our encouragement and support along the way.    Some people mistakenly think that baby-led weaning does not include substituting, limiting, or encouraging the weaning process in any way. Yet when we do things to encourage walking, or buy special panties for toilet learning, or become involved in leading the way for other stages of growth, we can see that we are doing the right thing as long as we keep in mind the capability of the child and always consider his feelings.    Considering and validating children's feelings does not always mean that they should do everything their own way. This touches on the topic of loving guidance as well as baby-led weaning. Perhaps that's why both subjects are often misinterpreted.    http://www.kathydettwyler.org/detwean.ht...  My research has looked at the various "life-history" variables (such as length of gestation, birth weight, growth rate, age at sexual maturity, age at eruption of teeth, life span, etc.) in non-human primates and then looked at how these variables correlate with age at weaning in these animals. These are our closest relatives in the animal kingdom, especially gorillas and chimpanzees, who share more than 98% of their genes with humans. I came up with a number of predictions for when humans would "naturally" wean their children if they didn't have a lot of cultural rules about it. This interest stemmed from a reading of the cross-cultural literature on age at weaning, which shows that cultures have very different beliefs about when children should be weaned, from very early in the U.S. to very late in some places. One often hears that the worldwide average age of weaning is 4.2 years, but this figure is neither accurate nor meaningful. A survey of 64 "traditional" studies done prior to the 1940s showed a median duration of breastfeeding of about 2.8 years, but with some societies breastfeeding for much shorter, and some for much longer. It is meaningless, statistically, to speak of an average age of weaning worldwide, as so many children never nurse at all, or their mothers give up in the first few days, or at six weeks when they go back to work. It is true that there are still many societies in the world where children are routinely breastfed until the age of four or five years or older, and even in the United States, some children are nursed for this long and longer. In societies where children are allowed to nurse "as long as they want" they usually self-wean, with no arguments or emotional trauma, between 3 and 4 years o|`|93e5e66462cba8bcd411219422deababaa	usually kids will wean between 2-4 i think. even so weaning an older child from the breast would be much less heartbreaking     when one reffers to self weaning it a child wenaing themselves from the breast     baby-led weaning is the baby weaning on to solids on their won time with real food     most older babies /toddlers who are nursing don't so it frequently. my son never wants it when we're out and about. he's too interested in other things|`|vue9NOhYaa	Allowed to self-wean, most children do so between 18 months and 3 years.  A few wean a bit earlier ... a few go a bit longer.      The choice is yours.  It IS best to go for at least a year if you can.  At that point, if you feel strongly that you want/need to wean, and baby is willing, then go ahead.  Or, if you and baby are still enjoying nursing, feel free to continue until one or both of you IS ready to stop. There are many benefits, and no negatives (beyond those associated with personal preference)  to nursing a toddler.|`|hieQHR0daa	Self weaning is allowing your baby to decide when to try other foods. Bottle or breast feeding continues until the child has displayed interest in family diet. To do so the child must be at the table with adults at mealtimes so that they have the opportunity to grab something from mum/dad's plate. There are advantages and disadvantages to this method of weaning, as with any parenting style.  It is a very personal decision. Most children are ready to try other foods from about 4-6 months of age. Some would suggest that leaving weaning till later makes for fussy eaters but there is evidence to back this up and other evidence that there is no difference. It depends on the person you ask.|`|RwoN3E9Uaa	I fully recommend letting your child self wean.  My daughter is also 10 months and I plan to let her take the lead.  Most children will self wean around 3 years.  It is much easier for them to understand at that age, also less traumatic on your breasts than a cold turkey wean.    The benefits of breastfeeding and breast milk extend well beyond one year for both you and baby.  At least try to go to 2 years and then take it from there, IMO.|`|nAOlBmzDaa	just cut out one feeding at a time until he is weaned. they only know what WE teach them...|`|RqcLxDesaa	They're all different.

Let them self wean, even if they don't self wean until they are 10 years old.  It's always best to let them decide.
b3892e48ce1ff2d86e671ceef5fd7a83aa	Hi :(     I'm so sorry you're so sick. I think morning sickness- especially severe morning sickness- is nothing to sneeze at. I have had a life threatening illness and I know what pain is like, but I think nausea is so much worse. I had severe HG for the first 3 months of this pregnancy- then- miracle of miracles- it went away! (I'm 36 weeks pregnant now and I can tell you without a doubt that the first couple of months were the roughest of this pregnancy. I feel great now!)     As bad as this is, it is temporary :) eat what you can, when you can, and don't push yourself to do things you can't do. Try and get your hubby to help out, tell him how sick you are. Can you get your boys to help out at all if they are old enough?    Get somebody to stock the house with foods and drinks that you can tolerate- if it's just Popsicles, then have tons on hand. The most important thing is to keep hydrated. I kept bags of ice in the freezer (couldn't make it fast enough at home) and I kept a glass packed full of ice and water by the couch or wherever I was and would sip whenever I thought about it. For some reason having the water barely below freezing really helped.     The medication really helped me- without it I would have been dangerously dehydrated. Do what the doctor says and hang in there! You can do it!    *hug*|`|uRuoINt0aa	hi, dear..    i think i can relate to you...as my morning sickness has turned into all day & night sickness & its horrible at the night time i need to have a vomit at night before sleep as i can't make the food stay in or you can say down...i was feeling good till i was 10 weeks but after that i 'm feeling really sick...    hope you feel better soon..    well how far are you now..    hope this helps you..!!|`|AA11348933	I know the feeling.  Though during my first pregnancy I would vomit constantly and I didn't feel better afterwords.  I just kept feeling bad.    I'm sorry to say that your doctor will probably not prescribe you Zofran.  Zofran is not an anti-nausea drug.  It is an anti-emetic.  It doesn't prevent nausea, it prevents vomiting.  I took it during my first pregnancy from 15-20 weeks.  It helped me keep food down, but didn't really help with the nausea.  I would have been hospitalized without it.  My doctor wouldn't prescribe it until I called and told him I hadn't been able to keep food down for four days.  (FYI, If you can't keep food down longer than 24 hours call your doctor)    Have you tried eating small pieces of raw ginger?  Its really strong but just shaving a small piece of ginger root and putting it in your mouth helps.|`|CuCrGDuRaa	I am almost 17 weeks pregnant and have been sick all day, everyday since I was 8 weeks pregnant.  I can rarely leave the house because I do puke, and often.  My husband took me out to dinner for our anniversary and I vomited in the car, and in the parking lot in front of the restaurant.  It's awful.  I am trying to stay away from medications during this pregnancy though, since I'm high risk and having twins.  I keep telling myself that today is the last day I'll be sick!    Hope the medicine works for you!|`|FgvnitQfaa	i totally agree with Herdoula, ginger is great. if you can't abide raw, ginger biscuits and ginger tea work just as well. try to avoid medication unless you are in real bad trouble. sometimes the sickness feels worse because you are stressed out with mothering and taking care of the house. monitor yourself to see what times the sickness is at its worst then try to arrange to have help at that time or to have the kids involved in something. fresh air also works wonders.|`|jwRej2hPaa	I also had severe morning sickness, I couldn't keep anything down. Lost 20 pounds in 10 days before my doc sent me to the emergency for and IV. Ended up staying overnight because of protein in my urine and FINALLY got Zofran. It worked great!!!! After I started taking it, it was like a whole new experience no more vomiting. With my second son, not so bad so ginger ale and those square crackers worked pretty good. You just gotta talk to your doc and wait it out. Hopefully you can get some relief soon. Congrats!!
prqrQcd1aa	Ok.. it does not matter what my own personal opinion is here... Telling a woman she can not have any more children is a violation of her rights according to the constitution. This is why they are no longer allowed to "sterilize" people who are mentally retarded or else wise impaired!|`|cAtWxJG1aa	I think it's wrong.  A judge ruling that someone is "no longer allowed to give birth" because she gave some children up for adoption sounds to me like a ruling ripe for successful appeal.  She didn't leave any kids in dangerous situations:  if she felt she couldn't care for them she gave them to a family that could and wanted to.  What's so wrong with that? How about directing her to services that could help her care for herself and her children? What if her circumstances change and she later is able to financially support more children? Isn't that kind of order criminalizing for the poor what is a basic human right? How would that even be enforced? Forced abortion or sterilization? Criminal penalties for becoming pregnant? Does she go to jail if she gets raped, too?    I can understand taking a child into foster care if that child is being abused or neglected.  But the circumstances you describe sound totally wrong to me.    Is this something that actually happened? Do you have a link?|`|TQW5E6olaa	Makes sense, she can't take care of herself, let alone children. She's homeless, she probably can't even get prenatal care...    A judge did something similar here in LA. A girl gave birth twice and each time threw out the babies, he ordered her NOT to get pregnant for a year or so...    I understand and respect the points of the people who have differing opinions than me and I do understand it is a violation of her rights, but i'm more concerned with the children she can't care for...Doesn't every child deserve to be born with the most basic prenatal care (I doubt she'll get it) and as a helpless infant do they then deserve to be on the street with their mother? She KNEW she couldn't care for the other children, that is why she gave them up. Why would she get pregnant again???|`|vue9NOhYaa	The law cannot force a woman to give her children for adoption. At most, they might be put into foster care until she's able to care for them.   Nor can a judge force a woman to have an abortion.|`|G2auAv1Saa	I think it is wrong the woman had another child after already knowing she can't take care of the ones she already has.|`|ed052b6f800dc43932558f491194a7b8aa	its tough to answer as a mum BUT someone has to think of these children she can not care for so yes it seems the right thing to do|`|0F8hauikaa	I think people should have to pass some kind of test to be allowed to breed, so yes, I think the judge made a good decision in this case.  There are a lot of bad parents out there raising children that are or will be a burden to society. If a person proves to be irresponsible, mandatory sterilization should be enforced, however, I don't think the baby in question should be aborted just because the mother is indigent.|`|a3MSSvdcaa	I think it's right.

How can a nation that is so quick and willing to grant women the 'choice" to abort their babies also be okay with the government meddling in people's everyday lives so much they they actually LIMIT the amount of children one can have.  This world is so hypocritical I can't even stand it.  Everyone always whines and moans that women should be allowed to choose to abort or not and that it isn't fair for anyone else to make that choice, but those same people (some right here on this page!!)  would turn right around and take away a more fundamental choice and tell a woman she can't have anymore babies?!?  I don't understand.  I understand that she is unfit, I understand that she is causing a hardship to society....I get all that and it is a sad shame,  BUT it is still her biological right as a woman to give birth if she wants to....like it or not.|`|P4LBygv2aa	wow she can spread her legs but can't flip burgers   judge is right.   seems she spends time having sex and not finding a job.  I think she needs to get a job and her life back before she needs to have sex , and for that guys sake hope she showered and shaved , lol .|`|nzY94B7waa	They said she can no longer have children?? I didn't know the court could do this.  I think it would be in her and her children's best interest to get to the route of the problem.  Maybe there is drug addiction or some sort of physiological issue.    For me this is a sensitive subject because my mother had 5 children and was not capable of caring for us the way she should have.  I am so happy she was not forced into giving us up for adoption.  That would have broke all of our hearts.  We were temporarily given to family.    I can see why the judge would make that decision but I didn't realize he was allowed to do that.|`|rISHTfK3aa	It is the right thing to do. Children need stability in their life's and to know that there is someone who is reliable to care for them.|`|3CG3rby0aa	I think the judge is trying to make the best decision possible for the circumstances.  It is a hard decision to make but do what is best for the children and hopefully the mother will be able to help herself and then see her kids later on.  So for the most part, as long as the judges lets her have the baby she is pregnant with and then give it up (instead of an abortion) the judge is right.|`|DDFSITiYaa	I agree with the judge.   BUT I would also as the judge offer the woman as much social service as possible. She needs education on birth control.  Why does she keep having sex?  Is she a prostitute?       I think allowing a child to be born into a situation of homelessness is wrong.  I think the judge is looking at the greater good of the child.
KQU5y20waa	okay....this is my story.<br>  by best friend does not take bc for many health reasons. she has had 7 kids in the last 11 years. and every single time that she got pg.....was either after she dried up, or quit breastfeeding. everytime. each time was within a 6 months or less period of time......she and her husband are TOTAL sex freaks. when ever she would breast feed she would never get pg. never. but she would if she wasn't breastfeeding.....|`|oqUlYXqtaa	i don't think breastfeeding it's affecting it since now you do have regular periods, but i'm not 100% sure, you can also ask fertility specialists online for free, try fertilityties.com<br>  good luck!!|`|64OsCr8laa	no you can still get pregnant while breastfeeding for sure|`|PviIOflqaa	It's possible.<br>  <br>  There are a thousand other reasons that might also apply, and no one in cyberspace is going to know all your circumstances.  So, no, you can't know for sure that that's the biggest problem, let alone the only problem.<br>  <br>  But, yes, as long as you're still breastfeeding you'll be less likely to catch pregnant again.  If you're going to try for the next one, your body has to believe that this one doesn't need to keep using your body's resources any longer.|`|F3dWvVy5aa	You're not really breastfeeding that much. But it can be an issue. I noticed breastfeeding that when I tried to conceive it wasn't working either. i think maybe ovulation is hit or miss during the year following.|`|gzQIstDFaa	i'm not a doctor or anything but ive heard that it can cause problems. its because of all the hormones your body still has i think
cErLq7f3aa	Ryan Michael, yes it goes, and Leah|`|hhocL3aWaa	It really is according to which is most important to you.  Try both out for a while.

Although Ben Briana, Liam and Luca sound better. <br>  <br>  PART 3<br>  Hey you could always name her Michelle? But its not a favorutie of mine.

ZbJ0bx3Uaa	I don't see anything wrong with it, in moderation of course. Don't base your idea of love or idea of sex even off of it. It doesn't show either accurately.    Wrong? That's a personal opinion. I don't think it's wrong, but it depends on your personal morals and how it relates with them.|`|H2IqzG12aa	Two dangers:  One, it's addictive. And two, the people you see aren't real (they're cast in those roles because of their unique "attributes", among other things) nor is the sex real (in the sense that what seems like a marathon session may be several occasions spliced together).  And that can give you an unrealistic idea of what to expect in real life.    It's natural to be turned on by porn, that's what it's intended for.  But it's not good for you.  Better that you should be hanging out with your friends and getting fresh air and exercise.|`|a3MSSvdcaa	well it's illegal....but there's really no way to stop you    Just keep in mind that most of the time it's way way way off base....it's not always the typical way of having sex.  It's good you know that sex and love are different things....but sex with the one you love is also way different then sex with someone you don't.  Sex isn't just about getting off.  It isn't about seeing how kinky and flexible a girl can be.  It's about wanting to be as close as you can with the person you love.  It's passionate and wonderful.      Also be careful how much you watch.  It can honestly become an addiction.|`|ZQfGvUgMaa	Why not? I'll tell you what I told my teenage nephew. Its cool to look at, but when you get older you'll have to pay good money to get girls to do those things in real life. Most women don't approve of porn, and aren't quite as limber as the women in those movies..  Just don't set yourself up for disappointment :)|`|FZQ2KHDvaa	Porn is wrong.|`|5tqh0akYaa	honestly its pretty normal. If your watching every day then that's a problem. Its a lot better than sex and i think its okay for guys to do x)|`|7SKVCPcSaa	only if you watch it in moderation. you're becoming more interested in sex and you have to learn some where.    i don't think anything is wrong with you. i know my husband started watching porn when he was like 10.. and he is normal! well, normal enough that i married him and love him so much!!|`|4DoXomHZaa	It is illegal.    Is it normal to want to? Of course. But it is SO SO SO far from reality it ain't funny.|`|LfGQjuZnaa	I reccommend not watching it. It is made for adult in the first place. Having sex is supposed to be a way of showing your love towards the other person and in the majority of these shows they are doing it for pleasure, money or to promote something.   =)|`|ejJD6BBXaa	no its not|`|ySKK7lCyaa	As long as you don't do it everyday and that is all your thinking about.|`|YO1w7gpiaa	Atleast you are asking.    Today on the radio will be broadcast a recorded interview with mass murderer Ted Bundy, in the hours just before his execution.   He was interviewed by Dr James Dobson, who he asked to come and hear his story and to broadcast it for all of America.  (I heard this just last week)    Ted Bundy, in his interview said that of all the murderers he'd met in prison, they all had one thing in common.  They were fueled by their  use of porn.  Bundy was convinced that violence was increased against women by the men who's minds were accustomed to increasingly violent porn.    Find Focus On The Family on your local radio station today.  Listen for yourself.  (You can look up their website to find the station and time)    .............So, is it wrong?    Think of the lovely girl you desire for your life partner.  Do everything you can to become the kind and gentle, clean minded man she deserves.   Would she want to be with you if your mind were filled with such porn expectations of her???|`|46uiaxPUaa	Nothing but just know that all the stuff you see on there is probably never going to happen in real life.|`|c90TJKe4aa	dude i started when i was 11 i watched it maybe 3 or 4 times a week just dont let it stop you from doing things that you need to do|`|Vmim6dv0aa	It is not wrong of you, it is perfectly normal.  Don't feel ashamed or embarresed.  Just make sure you make the right decisions when it comes to the actual act.  Remember a lot of decisions you make now will carry through for the rest of you life and a man will tell you anything to get in your pants.  Just follow your gut, there is a reason we have those feelings.|`|AXEqOEloaa	I think you are a child putting youself in an adult situtation, you need to be a kid and leave that crap alone. I know you are at a curious age but really I think you are too young.|`|a5hkW9Mxaa	Yea it's wrong....the more you put in your mind the more it will affect your view of women. you can be better then that. if it becomes an addiction then it will hurt you and your future relationships|`|rYQCtRGgaa	It's not wrong at all. Just don't watch too much plus some girls may find it as a big turn off. So just keep track of how much your watching because some ppl become addicted to it. sounds crazy but it happens. So i'd say it's normal.

aac7c6d4d79683e9cae0fe6a541bbccdaa	The students and parents can legally fight this.  Unless they have a search warrant, this is NOT legal.  Both the student and the parent has a right to refuse.  Even if they have passed something, it would get trampled in court if someone opposed it.  I woudl accept the suspension and go public.  It is NOT acceptable to strip search every student because $40 is missing.  <br>  <br>  This is a form of abuse-emotional and yes, perhaps even physical.  I do not care if it is nurses and gym teachers or who.  If they so much as TRIED it with my children, there would be hell to pay-however, I homeschool my children, so it will not happen.

Do none of the other parents in your home town care that this is happening?  Those parents should organize, stat.

rdGQMSyjaa	Eleanor. It's on my favorites list. I have Josephine as the middle name. I think Nora is a cute nickname, and probably the one I'd use if I ever used this name. Ellie is cute too though, although a bit more expected. Which isn't a bad thing, I'm just saying. :)|`|S3vYMNzFaa	Eleanor is my favorite here.<br>  But, I have to say Lyra has a lovely dare-I-say lyrical quality to it.|`|CxRJwJsraa	Lyra.|`|miFe45quaa	I love Eleanor. <br>  Lyra sounds like "liar"...|`|e4M4uQXNaa	I love both, but Eleanor's classic and sweet sound wins out for me.<br>  <br>  I like Lyra a lot, and it's definitely more unusual and spunky (but still has a really sweet, pretty feel), but Eleanor has always been one of my all time favorite names, so if I had to go with one or the other, I'd definitely go with Eleanor.<br>  <br>  Lyra Eleanor would be a lovely combination though.<br>  <br>  PS By the way, somebody mentioned they thought Lyra sounds like "liar".  I actually thought of a pretty opposite word - "lyric" or "lyrical" lol.  The lyre instrument also helps with the whole musical theme lol.|`|m6EUv8zgaa	I don't really like either, but I'd say Eleanor because I like Ella|`|423983e632cb60a59de566f2b6c70711aa	Eleanor|`|nSJ6q5SQaa	I like Eleanor. She could be Elle, Ella, Ellie, or, Lea(h).|`|1dVoVp1gaa	i like Eleanor more but i would prefer the name Eleanora instead :)|`|aIjOfkM8aa	I like Eleanor.|`|oYmZUO8Caa	Lyra is pretty.|`|AA11265535	I like Eleanor. Ellie could be a nick name for it.|`|SxPhldhhaa	I prefer Lyra over Eleanor. Lyra's just a very melodic and beautiful sounding name. It sounds very pretty and free. Actually, one of the main characters in a play I wrote for a contest was named Lyra (I didn't win, but I did get "honorable mention"). It suited her character very well, and that might also be a reason why I'm fond of the name, but I mostly like it just because of the way it flows neatly off your tongue.<br>  <br>  I love the name Eleanor because it's a classic and Ellie and Ella are cute nicknames that could be used for the name, but it just seems a little too dated to me. I can see an elderly lady or an adult named Eleanor, but not so easily a child. Ellie and Ella as nicknames do help, but Eleanor alone doesn't appeal to me too much for modern times.|`|Sob4zaUSaa	Eleanor sounds pretty and smart and as a little girl you could call her Ella, Ellie, and Nora if it seemed too old. I like that name a lot, except for it sounds a bitlike an old lady. Other than that, though, it's a great name.<br>  <br>  If Lyra is prounounced "Lye-rah", then I hate it--sounds like the beginning of a disease, like Lyra-ingitis or something. I think it's ugly and I would hate for it to be my name. But if it's prounounced "Lee-rah", then it's kind of pretty, but a tad too weird for my taste, especially since it's not even a real name.<br>  <br>  I like Eleanor better. :)|`|uSpHh1NPaa	One of my favourite names is Lyra.<br>  It has a really pretty sound to it , and i think its adorable.<br>  <br>  Eleanor is really nice aswel, but i always think of old ladies when i hear this name.<br>  <br>  Lyra all the way|`|Tj2jMlTvaa	Lyra it has a different ring to it, and Eleanor is a nice name but it's a little out dated|`|nQwSlue1aa	I love the name Lyra. It's very pretty. Eleanor just makes me think of an old woman in diapers.|`|y9TVkzQYaa	In my personal opinion Lyra is very pretty and would be a good name. <br>  I think Eleanor is a pretty name but is outdated. Its very old if you ask me.|`|bzkSIJYnaa	I prefer Lyra. I think. Eleanor has so many cute nicknames though. I love both! But, I will say Lyra for now.
kPl8TTzNaa	In my opinion, there is no such thing as a unisex name, there will never be a unisex name. All these so called "unisex" names are nothing more than horrid, masculine, boy names been shoved on poor little girls. <br>  <br>  Just look at he meaning of Unisex.<br>  <br>  Unisex - not distinguishing between male and female; undifferentiated as to sex<br>  <br>  When a name is masculine, that is distinguishing a sex...the name is male. When a name is feminine, that is distinguishing a sex...the name is female. So it cannot be "unisex".<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  As for why people cannot have girl names like Isabella and Ava...it is because people are ignorant and hypocritical.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  [Edit] Person above, Francis and Blaire are both masculine names and perfectly fine on males. where they belong.<br>  <br>  [Edit] Taylor is not a girl's name. It is masculine. Tailors were always male.<br>  <br>  [Edit] Done. Sorry about that.<br>  <br>  The only "unisex" names that I tolerate are as follows:<br>  <br>  <br>  Lee - Unfortunately it is my middle name. I hate it. So filler. But I hate even worse is that people say that Leigh is the "feminine" spelling. I fail to see how it is feminine in the least bit. The 'gh' to me is harsh and masculine.<br>  <br>  Vivian / Vivenne - My great Aunt was Vivian. I plan on using the Vivienne spelling as a middle name for one of my children, to honor her.<br>  <br>  Ariel - I doubt I ever use it but I have it on my female's list. Only because as a child I watched The Little Mermaid so much that I actually wore out two tapes of it.|`|b3fcaed1380d38d593a8cb71556b4d96aa	I have two grown sons, and I didn't give them unisex names.  I would have loved to name a son Robin, and that's not unusual in England, but in the US, I didn't want him to be teased.  <br>  I am not crazy about the unisex trend.  I am not crazy about the "lets make up some weird-a*s name for our kid" trend.<br>  And I have no idea why all these women think Brooklyn is a girl's name.  I keep seeing that on here, and I don't get it.|`|syrh8J6Vaa	I like unisex names.  My name is Kelly which is unisex.  In my opinion their are a lot of boy names that I would never use on a boy because they sound too feminine.  For example:<br>  Tristan<br>  Ashley<br>  Lindsey<br>  Madison<br>  Aubree<br>  Unisex or predominately boys names I love and would use:<br>  Toni<br>  Andie<br>  Morgan<br>  Dylan<br>  Danni<br>  Sam|`|SrcoG7JRaa	I generally do not like them.<br>  There are some more traditional names that have historically been used for both, or names with unisex nicknames that I do like (Alex could be either Alexander or Alexandra, but I do prefer the longer name being the formal, legal name instead of just the nickname), but I despise the, "OMG, let's call our little girls Madison, Cohen, Holden and Logan! We're so unique and cool!" trend. It's gross.<br>  <br>  My daughter has a largely unisex FN, Remy (funny that you mention it! It's so uncommon for either boy or girl in the US!), though we rarely use it. As the months have gone on, her middle name, Arabella and subsequent nicknames, has kind of just drifted in =P Mostly Belle or Bella (which I hate myself for, with all the -Bella names drifting around right now, but it's just become habit) Remy-Belle, Remielle/Remiel, Belle, Ari, Aria.<br>  <br>  I wouldn't name my son Isabella or Ava, just as I wouldn't name a girl Logan, Elliot or Jack. Most names have gender connotations, and I think except in a few circumstances the genders should be respected.<br>  Exceptions, as I said, are nicknames and HISTORICALLY unisex names, as in not recently just used by parents of girls. Names that have been well documented and widely recognized as both a male and female name.<br>  Examples would be something like Terri, which is used both by males as a short form of Terrence and by females as a form of Teresa. It's long been given as a full name to both in various spellings and I think it's been so long enough to be considered an acceptable unisex name.<br>  Merle has also been used by both males and females for many decades.|`|9dvmMRX4aa	Well none of my kids have unisex names but I guess I would try to stay away from them just because in my opinion a girl should have a girl's name and a boy should have a boy's name. Also, names like Isabella and Ava are extremely feminine names and in the languages they come from they are considered feminine names with feminine suffixes so not only are they considered feminine but they actually are feminine, but it's not like that for Ryan or Taylor. And c'mon, if you met a guy named Isabella and a girl named Taylor which one would you think was the freak?|`|0hxK0khKaa	These are my views on common "unisex" names:<br>  <br>  Addison-boy's name<br>  Alexis-can be used for either<br>  Ashley-boy's name<br>  Avery-boy's name<br>  Aubrey-boy's name<br>  Bailey-can be used for either<br>  Caden/Cadence-boy's nam<br>  Cassidy-boy's name.<br>  Carey-girl's name.<br>  Cameron-girl or boy's name. Cameryn is feminine, Cameron is masculine.<br>  Cecil-girl's name.<br>  Kristin-girl's name.<br>  Dana-boy's name.<br>  Dallas-boy's name.<br>  Dylan-boy's name.<br>  Gabriel/elle-El-boys, Elle-girls.<br>  Hailey-girl's name.<br>  Harper-boy's name.<br>  Harley-boy's name.<br>  Hayden-boy's name.<br>  Hunter-boy's name.<br>  Jesse-boy's name. Although, Jessie is a feminine nickname for Jessica.<br>  Jordan-boy's name, and Jordyn can be used on girls just fine.<br>  Kendal-boy's name<br>  Kasey-boy's name.<br>  Kennedy-boy's name. Or, a girl's name on a doll. A doll. Not your child.<br>  Leslie-girl's name.<br>  Lindsay-girl's name.<br>  Lee-Lee is feminine. Leigh is masculine.<br>  Lynn-girl's name.<br>  Mackenzie-boy's name.<br>  Madison-boy's name.<br>  Mallory-boy's name.<br>  Micha-boy's name.<br>  Morgan-girl's name.<br>  Nicole-girl's name.<br>  Olive-girl's name.<br>  Paige-girl's name.<br>  Paris-boy's name.<br>  Parker-boy's name.<br>  Peyton-boy's name.<br>  Quinn-boy's name.<br>  Ray-boy's name.<br>  Riley-boy's name.<br>  Robin-boy's name.<br>  Ryan-boy's name.<br>  Stacey-boy's name.<br>  Sean/Shawn/Shaun-boy's name.<br>  Taylor-boy's name.<br>  Taryn-boy's name.<br>  Tyler-boy's name.<br>  Vivian-girl's name.<br>  Whitney-boy's name.|`|NePgB9b2aa	They can work, only if they are truly unisex, meaning they have gained enough popularity on girls to consider it also a girls name. Bailey, Rory, Avery? Sure. I can see them on both genders. James, Ryan, Elliott? Um, NO. Just because some "uneek mommeigh" wanted to be special and pick a random BOY name for their girl does not make it a solid unisex or girl name at all.|`|PmT8dPEqaa	Well, I personally think unisex names are nice for girls but so much for boys.<br>  <br>  Frankly because girls can get away with names like Jordan, Alex, etc. and boys will get teased for a name like Leslie.<br>  <br>  I'm actually planning on giving my girls unisex names when I have my babies =]|`|vRvXvnRZaa	Honestly I think they come in handy if the child decides to have a sex change in the future, as to mine, well, all my boys have traditional hispanic names, either way I don't see them as a bad or good thing.|`|oYmZUO8Caa	I like SOME unisex names. But others, NOT AT ALL!|`|OXxKTM6vaa	I personally would NEVER call my child a unisex name. I love masculine names for boys and pretty girly names for girls. I know a lot of people who love unisex names, they are not for me though. I just don't see the point.<br>  <br>  For example, my aunt is obsessed with unisex names - 3 of my girl cousins are called Courtney, Billie & Charlie. They are all male names to me. Now I think something like Olivia Grace, Ava Jade & Sophia sound much better??? <br>  <br>  Names help a persons individuality, why wouldn't a parent be proud of her daughter and want her to sound beautiful instead of like a man??? I just don't get it.|`|qXq0nmBzaa	I've been very outspoken on the subject.<br>  <br>  For the most part, I heartily dislike unisex names. Most of them are masculine names co-opted (stolen!) by women in this country to be "yoo-neek" or creative, or some other dumb thing.<br>  <br>  Now we have males with what used to be masculine names having to explain that this time (Taylor, Hayden, Peyton, Riley, etc) is a GUY!<br>  <br>  I think it's unfair to the guys.<br>  <br>  It's also unfair to just about everybody else. Teachers initially bear the brunt of hurt feelings when they put the female Jordan in the boys' line. It continues through all departments in the school setting from nursery school through post-graduate work.<br>  <br>  Then it spreads like ripples in a pond.<br>  <br>  Pretty soon the confusion spreads to anyone in customer service like pharmacists and other medical personnel, government agencies, and the financial sector.<br>  <br>  I think it's unfair, uncalled for, and extremely rude not to mention narcissitic and ego-centric. These parents think they are so cutting-edge, cute (or cuteeee as it appears on Y!A), unique, or whatever but in the long run their self-centered ideas make things miserable for many who come in contact with their children as well as causing emotional confusion to the child.<br>  <br>  I would say that's a basic explanation of why I would never, never, NEVER give my child a gender-bender of a name.<br>  <br>  BTW, all of my children have expressed thanks that I made their names gender-specific. They told me it was one less thing to aggravate them in school.|`|ctra63V6aa	In general, I don't like names that are gender-neutral.<br>  But, I think it works with certain names. Riley, for example, sounds like a girl and I know a ton of little girl Riley's. When my sister named her son Riley, I thought it was weird, but it's grown on me and I really like it for a boy - and it is actually a boys name, I was surprised to learn.<br>  I was also surprised to learn that Avery is really a boys name, despite the recent trend to use it for a girl. I wanted to name my girl this until my husband told me it's not a girls name.<br>  Bottom line for me is if it sounds like a girl name and it's cute, I'm cool with it. I had a girl friend in high school named Kyle, and it really fit her.<br>  If it doesn't fit, it's disturbing. I recently met a older gentleman named Lynn and a woman named Shawn. I had a hard time calling them by their names.<br>  Personally, I stay away from unisex for my kids because it could end up being a mistake.|`|Sob4zaUSaa	Not unless I really am in love with it, because if the kid ends up not fitting in and they have a unisex name, they will be made fun of almost for sure. But I think it's easier for girls to have boy's names because girls can lean more towards the masculine side and not be called lesbian, while boys with girl's names are always picked on and called gay. It's a guy thing I guess. Lol, I wouldn't know.|`|Lo5yiBqzaa	Depends on the name.  I love Morgan for a boy but hate it for a girl, same for Christian but some names for boys are just wrong, like Leslie and Shannon.|`|YUDVmb77aa	for me it depends on the name if its like jesse or something i don't mind but some of them sound like more of a girls name or more of a boys name for me it really depends on the name|`|ALM0J9Wlaa	I named my girl Jordan. So, yes.|`|TE7foNwMaa	This is a really hard question... I'm not even sure what I think...<br>  <br>  I agree, I do love Remy for a girl... And there are some names that I would seriously never use for a boy because it's been taken over by the girls, but I'm not sure what my actual views are. <br>  <br>  I have a really close friend who has a daughter with an extremely masculine name... She was told that she wouldn't be able to have any children after this one, and her husband had just passed away. So, she chose to name her daughter after her husband. So I really don't know my opinions about unisex names... I love this friend of mine, and I love her daughter, and I think it's great that she wanted to honor her husband... But I can't say that I could ever be bold enough to do what she did. She's often looked down upon because of her daughter's name, and I'm definitely on her side... She's amazing... but I still try to stay away from unisex names (besides Remy). <br>  <br>  I suppose I don't like the trend of girls' having boys' names. As weird as this sounds, I seriously think it makes it sound like women are taking over the country... Haha, this is a weird way to look at it, but women are getting more and more of what they want, and making it harder for men to be masculine at all... I mean, we hardly wear dresses anymore, we vote, we have jobs. I think that's great, but it just seems like people want to prove that women are just as good as men. That's obvious, I think we're great. ;) But it just doesn't seem fitting or right to have girls with extremely masculine names. <br>  <br>  On a different note, I'm totally fine with boys AND girls named some certain names. Like Taylor, Aubrey, Lee... I would probably never use any unclear names, but I think they're fine for anyone else. <br>  <br>  Okay, so maybe I have a strong opinion about names being after a person. For some reason, that's extremely important to me. So, I'm completely fine with parents naming their kids whatever they want...masculine or feminine. It doesn't effect my own love of names, and my own love of people. I guess my own personal use for unisex names is limited. I want it to be obvious about WHAT exactly I'm having, but I won't hesitate to consider a name that's after someone that I love. Though, I'd never be bold enough to name my son after a good friend named "Melissa" or something, but I would definitely consider "Mel" as a middle name for him. So, I guess I'm fine with unisex names used by other people. It doesn't bother me that much... but I have no intentions of following the masculine girl names trend... <br>  <br>  Overall, I guess I don't totally think it's a big deal as long as the baby's loved. The parents are welcome to do whatever they want, that won't change how I feel about unisex names...and I'm totally unsure what that is... <br>  <br>  Sorry if this makes absolutely no sense... But this was an interesting question. I really did find it extremely hard...haha, I can't think right now. <br>  <br>  -- Amy|`|aLAmvX5Naa	I dislike unisex names and I would hate my parents if they named me Ryan.<br>  <br>  I'm all for parents naming their kids how they please as long as they stop to think of how the name will look in the future when the child is applying for a job. Christopher Smith could be a CEO but Kriztoefer Smith would look horrible on a company's annual report. If a girl was named Ryan Smith think of all the drama and teasing she would go through in her life.|`|CMuL7XpKaa	I prefer to put each name for one gender. As a girl who has (and was named after) a boy i believe each name should be labeled a gender. For example Taylor (girl) and Ryan (boy). We have a girl named Ryan (and 2 boys named Ryan/Ryan) at our school, she hates her name and goes by Ryan Lea (Ryan Lee) because Lea is her middle name. If her parents would have called her Rachel Lee her issue would be solved, but no her parents had to call her Ryan Lea. I also like knowing some ones gender so you won't be shocked when you meet them. Let's say my sister's friends are having a party (say they are Taylor Ariel Lancaster & Alexis Ryan Lancaster) my mom would go out and get them a dolls (my sister is seven) only to find out when my mom takes my sister to the party that "Tay-Tay" & "Lexi" are BOYS! What embarrassment. I remember that not to long ago my twin brother was invited to a birthday party (actually this was a few years ago) and  the mom said (she was talking to my mom on the phone) "So Yarden is coming to Andy's party?....... Great.... If you want you can bring Tom, Andy talks about HIM alot.... Wait Tom's a girl?..... Yeah she can come.. I guess.." So it really annoyed me. My kids will be getting names that are not gender neutral for that reason.

Don't think people will judge...anyway, you aren't able to save up $20?  I mean...you aren't paying for the other two or three people going right.  So you only need $10 for your ticket.  Then I'm sure parking won't be much more than $10-$20, so maybe another $5, but if you can't come up with it just park a little further away for free and walk...I mean...not going to kill you guys to walk one mile to save $20 if it's really that hard to come up with the cash.  Even if I had the cash I'd probably do that.  The only other thing I can think of is if they make you chip in for gas.  Since you say it's about 30-45 minutes away I'm assuming that'd be equal to less than $10 of gas, so maybe another $2.50.  So, so far, it's a total of like $17.50.  The only other cost is if you want to buy food or a drink, or a CD/Shirt or something.  You can probably bring a bottle of water and a candy bar from home, and the merchandise is just a luxury so no need to worry about money for that.  Is there really NO WAY you can make $10 real fast?  You didn't say what your age is, but I'm assuming you're something like 12-16.  Surely, whoever you're going with, is over 18, and I'd assume he/she has a job...can't they lend you $10 until you can pay them back?  Or can't you go walk someone's dog once or twice and get $10 for it.  Or wash someone's car...or babysit...or something.  Back when I was younger than sixteen my Mom and Dad would lend me money to go places.  And I'm not talking $5, I'm talking like $100 from each of them.  Once I turned sixteen and got a job I was always expected to pay for my own entertainment...unless of course it was a family event...but I never had a problem.  I'm sure there's someway you can earn the money in a month...I mean, I'd have found a way to earn it in a week if I wanted to go.  Or maybe try making a deal with your Mom.  Ask her if she'll give you $10 if you do good in school for the next month.  Or try to cut back on stuff.  If she gives you lunch money try to save $1-$2 out of it every day/week and try to build up a bit of cash.  Do you have to have the VIP ticket?  If you just go with the general admission ticket for $10, and park a mile away, you should only need to pay an additional $2.50 for gas maybe, for a total of $12.50, so you're already set.|`|EZrYH6tdaa	well you can try to earn the money (not the best choice) <br>  you can ask your friends to pay for them selves<br>  and if your mom is anything like my mom she just wants to watch over you s ask for her to come along you don't have to hang out with her the whole time it may even be funner those are my only suggestion|`|vQy7V6ZMaa	Earn the money. If your family is tight on money and they can't afford to pay you to work around the house for the ticket money, try doing stuff for neighbor or family members. Clean house, babysit, yard work. <br>  Double check around your house. Maybe there are a few things that need to be returned to the store. If you have the receipt you can get money back most of the time. That can score a few extra bucks too!|`|IL4Vv0Ptaa	hmm... growing up sucks at times, because your parents will be concerned about your well being this is only normal is it a band that she likes? I mean if it's a band that she might like then she might end up going with you. Unless you really want to go to this show I'd just walk to it, but sense you seem like an honest person I would just stay to your mom's "no" and go to a concert later on in the Summer time.|`|SzlezY7Baa	Try to show your mom that you are responsible and can help out more around the house (chores, etc.) so maybe she'll see that you deserve to go.<br>  Now, also, if you are having 2-3 other people come, tell them to pitch in for their own tickets so you all pay $20.|`|0THi6Q9Baa	What are you thinking?

AA10015577	The EDD is just a guesstimated day of when baby could make his/her appearance.  They measure all sorts of things while doing an ultrasound so they can get a more accurate guesstimation on how baby is developing and when they could be due.  I would just keep both EDD's in mind.  Good luck!|`|wl7tlYOYaa	well their both just estimates...the sonogram measures the baby and thats how they determine how far along you are but babies grow at a different rate so its not 100% either. If your 100% sure about your last period then that's the due day you go by thats what my doc told me because I had the same issue.|`|5yAsj29Vaa	Most Dr's will go by your LMP so you need to go by March 14th.  An ultrasound can be off by up to a pound either way, so that is not a totally accurate measurement.<br>  Just remember though, a due date is only an estimate no matter which one you go by, and you can't depend on your baby being there on that exact day.  They almost never come on the due date!|`|d6df9c3bab13d4a609d4641b785de6b0aa	The due date you get by your last period is an estimate based on the fact that women "typically" ovulate 14-15 days after the first day of their period. So they use the same due date calculator for everyone. Which of course we all know we can ovulate a few days late or early. The due date you get when they give you an ultrasound is based on the measurements of the baby. It is more accurate, especially when done in the first 8 weeks of pregnancy.|`|i9M0U9Meaa	i wouldnt worry too much about the date, the baby will come when its ready, not by a date anyone picks!|`|RjoCYCkQaa	just make sure you baby doesn't turn out retarded.

Maybe Robin Gwen. <br>  <br>  Wren and Robin are both birds and the 2 R's make it sound like a character in a children's book.|`|1TgCidVPaa	Not really.

Sob4zaUSaa	The thing people don't realize is that words can sound pretty when you say them but they are horrible things to name your kid. My favorite word is frugal, but I'm not gonna go name my kid that. If you really like that name, though, then go with Tierney. The guy I like's little sister's name is that and I think it's really cute:)|`|1TgCidVPaa	I dont like it. Its kind of weird to name your child that. When you think of tear you normally think of sad so why would you want to associate you childs name with something unplesant?|`|uSpHh1NPaa	Thats ridiculous.and stupid.<br>  Anything other than that.|`|ctra63V6aa	I don't like it.<br>  <br>  Maybe if you did Teira (rhymes with Keira), it would sound more like a name than a sad word.|`|2LB3bWdpaa	I dont like Tear as a name AT ALL.

But if i met a girl named tear i would think of a very unusual and outgoing girl. Maybe spell it Tere so that its not completely like a teardrop. But i suppose then people wont be able to spell it so maybe go with Tear, lol sorry im probably not helping much. Overall though, i really think thats a cute name, and heaps of ppl here are going to say its silly but dont listen to them!!<br>  <br>  :)|`|LoP2CRE2aa	Like you cry a tear or like you tear a piece of paper??

Its just a random word.|`|KWV6ZtBsaa	nahhh<br>  that would be weird<br>  like apple.|`|qXq0nmBzaa	I couldn't imagine anyone would ever possibly suggest Tear (as in crying) so I thought this was some kind of name from "Stargate 1" as in Tee-ar.<br>  <br>  I thought Tee-ar was weird until I read the rest of your question.<br>  <br>  What could possibly make any rational human being think of using this as a name?<br>  <br>  ...totally bizarre...|`|fnj8BsoGaa	I would still be nice to her, but in the back of my mind, I would feel bad for her for having such a name. I don't like it very much. Reminds me of tears of sadness, or a rip (tear).|`|0BX1yFGuaa	I would think that a knocked up teenager who hasn't quite gotten through the teen angst years named her.<br>  <br>  I think it's pathetic and a horrible idea for a name.|`|oYmZUO8Caa	I don't like it, at all. Sorry. I wouldn't know if it was Tear like crying or Tear like ripping something.|`|EdLeOUBfaa	I don't like it... it seems hippie, which is cool, but it seems sad.|`|AA11265535	If it's spelt like Tier it might be an ok name.|`|WJW4qOlUaa	I like it!

J5TbYvVZaa	I started a week ahead of time telling my son that he was going to get to go potty in 7 days. We counted down. On the day before we started, I let him help me color a potty chart and let him pick out the stickers for it. We even went to the store to pick out what treats he wanted. I also had him help me put things in his 'potty box' - puzzles, books, trucks that went in the bathroom. I had already purchased underwear and put them in his drawer - where he could reach. On the morning of the big day, we put all his diapers in a box for the baby (his little brother) and took them out of his room. We used a timer the first few days, so he knew that when the timer went off we were heading to the potty. We bought a child urinal - Peter Potty. We had both pottys in there and told him he could pick which one he wanted to use. The first couple days were accident after accident. When he asked for a diaper, I reminded him they were gone. By day 4 he was accident free. We put on 'nite nite pants' (goodnights pullups) and never said diaper again. The other thing I did was keep a log of when he would go to the bathroom and by day 7 we were out and about because I could schedule small errands around his potty schedule. I know all kids are different but I think it really helped him that he was involved in everything and felt like he was making the choice! Good luck and be consistant.|`|JvM44Bx5aa	Most children are potty trained between the ages of two and four.   Some are ready sooner; others take longer and may not be ready to potty train until age five.<br>  <br>  When your son is ready, let him practice pulling his pants on and off independently. Provide child’s potty-chair, you may find some styles of potty chairs here, <a href="http://astore.amazon.com/potty-chair-20" rel="nofollow">http://astore.amazon.com/potty-chair-20</a> <br>  <br>  ? Give simple instructions and praise when he performs a request correctly.  Praise him for having dry pants each time.<br>  ? Ask him to go potty every hour.<br>  ? Boys should sit to urinate until toilet training is well underway. <br>  ? Consider rewarding him with a special treat such as a favorite cookie for each successful potty experience.<br>  ? Placing O-shaped cereal in the toilet can help little boys learn to aim a stream of urine.<br>  <br>  If he shows resistance to your first toilet training attempts, please go back to diapers until he is ready. There is no right or wrong age for potty training.   Good luck!|`|Zjtdpbqpaa	offer him candy, or an afternoon in the park with me!|`|HuKDmP4Paa	Maybe a little tough love is in need. Sit him there often and don't let him get up until he does his business. If treats, target practice, books and bribery are failing to work, it sounds like tough love should be tried. You can always use the tough love tactic and then reinforce it with a treat after he has done his business.|`|hh5E9n4Oaa	I started my almost three year old off with a sticker chart and lots of praise, love and affection.  For the first couple of weeks it worked but then he started to regress.  I was very concerned, we started training with training underwear because I didn't want him to treat his pull ups like a diaper but when he started to regress I went ahead, bit the bullet and put the pull ups on him for a few days while he got the rest he needed then he got right back on track again.  What I am trying to say is it takes consistency not bribery.  I tried to bribe with stickers and he became disinterested in them within a day.  So it takes lots of praise, patience, consistency, and devotion.  If he is not ready don't force him to be by bribing or even punishing him.  If you find yourself losing patience, take him out of the diapers put him in pullups, ask him to try and keep them dry and let him do it on his own.  Occasionally see if he will go to the bathroom with you, that is what we do is go side by side sure it's weird for me but it works for him I am his potty buddy.
3884ed81dd37e4db9226c11478973595aa	Now probably wouldnt be the time to be kicking her out. She is probably more scared and confused and stressed out than you are. She is the one who has to make this decision.<br>  I do understand your concern. I am sure you feel like the one that will be raising the baby. And she doesnt yet fully understand the magnitude of being a mother.<br>  But as a mom yourself...i wouldnt give up on her just yet.<br>  Having a baby impacts everyone. But it is a baby..a human...that still deserves love and warmth. It didnt ask to be brought into this situation.<br>  And maybe after the baby is born you will realize just how wonderful it will be to be a grandma!<br>  I know you dont see it now. Right now is the hard part.|`|wl7tlYOYaa	Maybe your parenting skills have to do with why shes a screw up because if thats the way you treat her now that she needs your support the most you can only wonder how you treat her on good days. No you cannot kick your 16 year old just because shes pregnant...she is your responsability legally until she is 18.And you cant make her have an abortion or give up the baby either. I have a daughter and you know what if that happened to her I would give her my support as her mother.|`|FpeEJbhaaa	Shenanigans|`|U1RcZjqJaa	As far as I know she is your responsibility until she is 18. Just because she is pregnant doesn't make her an adult. And I know its stressful times but try a little sympathy, she is your daughter and needs to know you are there for her.|`|i9M0U9Meaa	your a HORRIBLE mother. your daughter is trying to make a responsible decision and you want her to take the easy way out. you shouldn't even have kids.|`|9cu82009aa	Troll! Thanks for the 2 points.|`|FRwaGpJaaa	Be a good mom and don't kick your daughter out! She's 16 and confused and alone. Don't you care about her well being? If you make her get an abortion, you could scar her for life and send her into a life long depression, especially if she doesn't want an abortion. There are many stories about girls who are forced to get abortions by their parents and have to spend a life time in therapy because they are so scarred. And if you kick her out she could be stuck on the streets, forced into prostitution or some other horrible things. Just keep her and have her get  a job.\<br>  <br>  If you kick your daughter out, you are also fitting the white trash stereotype. Who cares who the dad is, she is YOUR DAUGHTER. It is your fault in the first place that she has been sleeping around. Don't you set any boundaries for her?<br>  <br>  Edit: Your daughter isn't the screw up, YOU are.|`|OCTvfDsxaa	I don't think you can kick her out but you can find alternative living arrangements for her. However,I don't see how you can be responsible for her child--that's on her. She is old enough to get a job and take care of her baby but she is not old enough to live on her own. Try having her pay rent or help with the bills. That's the responsible way to help her become a good mom. Buy the way,my opinion is not as good as my advice. You should probably keep yours out of the question.|`|ECTPfxJNaa	i am 15 years old and am 5 months pregnant. as much as i disobeyed my parents and still to this day don't really get along with them, i can honestly say this is the time when i need them the most. i would not know what to do without them so to disown her is REALLY the wrong thing to do. the choice to have an abortion is not yours, its your daughters so you can not force that on her. she can call social services and get you arrested...but to answer your question, the hospital's laws think of her as an adult now but unless she gets emancipated, she is all yours.|`|ojAo1U1caa	HA HA HA.<br>  <br>  This is totally your fault. Just re-read the question and think about it love! LOL!<br>  <br>  You're obviously more interested in the prestige of your family than the connections within it, which is not unusual for mother's with troubled daughters like you. Your youngest child has obviously ever been able to feel loved by you because you dish love and praise out on a success basis (sounds like that's going well for you!) and therefor had a deep craving for affection and love inside of her.<br>  <br>  And the best way to get to that big, sad hole is through the snatch. Why would you think she would no any better? Did you teach her to respect herself or did you teach her that success gets you respect? Like say...the success of seducing a man? Lol It's not an irrational jump lady to see why she would take any accomplishment and the rewards that came with it.<br>  <br>  You can legally kick you daughter out, love, so do it. No one would expect any more than that from you I'm sure.<br>  <br>  Just realise that children are made by nature and nurture. You don't give a child love and it will find it wherever the hell it can.<br>  <br>  Oh and I'm sure your older daughter is making something of her life, but she probably is a skank too. Girls with mother's like you are 95% of the time.|`|812874d02f72331b1d1a4fa6424dc06daa	Wow. Everybody makes mistakes and right now is when your daughter needs you the most. She needs your emotional support and you're abandoning her and trying to make her homeless. It's her baby, so it's technically not up to you to decide what she does, but you're her parents. You need to be there. You don't have to raise her baby for her or even help her, but you shouldn't throw her out on the streets. Make her get a job to take care of her own baby. Allow her to even pay rent to stay at home. But don't abandon her when she needs you most.|`|VFIF4zpAaa	Why don't you give her a chance. just because she is pregnant at 16 doesn't make her an adult. she is still your baby girl. who just chose the wrong path and made a mistake that will affect her for the rest of her life. What kind of mother are you if you kick her out and she has no where else to go?<br>  <br>  ~jesus is love~<br>  <br>  don't kick her out give her the chance|`|hr24wI0daa	You are a very heartless uncaring mother. Would you have killed your daughter if your mother had threatened to disown you or something along those lines. If I was your daughter I would move out and disown you!|`|wxbGmxbOaa	You want your daughter to kill your grandchild or give your grandchild away? That's really horrible, that's not a very motherly thing to do, glad your not my mother. And yes maybe her getting pregnant at 16 wasn't the most responsible thing to do, but she is now trying to take responsiblity for her mistake and you are trying to have her take the easy way out. You should thank God you have a daughter who owns up to her mistakes and doesn't take the easy road out. Also, it's pretty crappy of you to kick your daughter and your unborn grandchild out on the street. You'll regret it later down the road, unless your heartless that is. And how do you know you'll be taking care of her child? Your daughter might surprise you and turn out to be one of the best mothers in the world, which would be great considering who her rolemodel of a mother is. I might get a thumbs down for this and you might not like my answer, but someone needs to give you a reality check.<br>  <br>  I was 18 when I found out I was pregnant, am now 19 and my parents were both upset with me, but my mother NEVER would kick me and her unborn grandchild out on the streets. She's an amazing mother and I thank God for her every day, especially now that I see how heartless some mothers could be. Oh, and before you even think of judging me for my age, let me just say this. I graduated high school in May of 2008, I have a full time job, I am still saving a planning on attending college, I was a virgin until I was 18 and I lost that to my bf of at the time 3 years and a month. Me and my bf are still together, will be together for 4 years in June. We both have jobs and will have no problem supporting our child. My mom and dad are letting my bf, my baby, and I stay here until we are stable enough to get our own place, we buy groceries and help out in any way that we can around the house. I do NOT count on my mother for every little thing. And she hasn't had to buy one thing for me or my baby since i've been pregnant. Of course she's already gotten the baby, her grandchild some things, but that was buy choice, I never asked for anything.<br>  <br>  So don't judge anyone, especially your OWN daughter by age. She made a mistake and is owning up to that mistake, you shouldn't kick her out for that. Have her get a job, finish school, and support her child.<br>  <br>  I hope you get things straight, so you don't lose a daughter and a grandchild.|`|AajjvZUPaa	I know that as a mother you must be scared. But your daughter is extremely brave for wanting to keep her baby. Im sure that all she wants right now is to have the support and love from her mother. So try to put away the fact that the father is a dead beat and put away the thought that YOU want her to have an abortion because its her child, and you should be lucky that she wants to keep and take care of her child. She needs all the help and support she can get right now.|`|TvYos4fhaa	first of all no you can't kick her out... She's still a minor and in your care, well you could kick her out but It's your choice. Also forcing your daughter to give up her child is a terrible thing... Abortion is just wrong. That baby did nothing wrong and it doesn't deserve to die. If you don't have the time or the money then talk to her about that when she's deciding what to do. Tell her that she needs to be able to support the baby if she wants to keep it. Also the father could be a problem. he might not want adoption, so keep that in mind....|`|og9mxwK4aa	first of all NO your daughter is not considered an adult just because she is going to become a mother. She is however the legal guardian of her child and she gets to decide what she does as far as that goes. <br>  <br>  and second of all.. you're mad because she's pregnant? well get over it.. there is no "fixing" it now. and putting all kinds of stress on her as far as "having to choose" is hurting not only your relationship with your daughter but also your unborn grandchild!! <br>  You talk about the father of this child being white trash??? what about a grown woman calling her teenage daughters reproductive organs a SNATCH?! are you a mother or a adolescent boy?<br>  <br>  she can be responsible for her past by making positive choices now.. like being a woman and raising this child to the best of her ability. <br>  <br>  I pray for your family and wish your daughter the very best of luck.<br>  <br>  <br>  By the way, congrats on the addition to your family.|`|F3dWvVy5aa	Yeah and I just read where you suck your doctor off for pills in another question.

Thats really messed up of your mom to let her do that to you but not let you do that to her. But just hide them or something.|`|geuF7GsHaa	explain this to your mom.
8LrnysX8aa	No. No sex at ten. That is far too young, especially when your little girl doesn't even know what makes penises grow bigger. She doesn't even know what sex is yet, and probably her little boyfriend doesn't know either.  Even leaving aside all of the emotional and ethical issues, sex at her age could really physically hurt her.  No, no, no.<br>  <br>  Have a talk with Cameron and explain to her that sex is for older people. Since Dylan seems to trust your husband a lot, maybe Chase should have a talk with Dylan, as well.|`|lzivF4Idaa	kids are still going to be curious no matter what you say. KEEP THEM AWAY FROM EACHOTHER. <br>  <br>  10 years old??? what the ****?!?!|`|AA12088442	tell her to wait until she is married. she is 10 and has a bf? hmmmm...|`|F3dWvVy5aa	Oh my god no sex to a ten year old please! I swear I would beat my daughter for trying to have sex that young. Thats too much for a kid to handle, let a kid be a kid. It will mess up her body and she will get pregnant by 12 or so. thats awful.|`|bdWO9wSAaa	LOL<br>  <br>  Let em at it!<br>  <br>  Then if she regrets it we can all have something other than GWB and Sarah Palin to laugh at =(|`|fdnbXfvfaa	Your 10 year old has a boyfriend?|`|NHIQl6VTaa	Okay--<br>  <br>  Your daughter is ten. Not even in Junior High. At her age, no boyfriends should be allowed. You should make a rule in your home that there will be no dating till sixteen. Explain to her that sex is something that should be shared with the love of your life, and that most of the time, when you have sex at a young age, the chances of you being with that person for the rest of your life are slim. You should keep those two away from each other, and show her that condoms and other contraceptive devices don't always work. Do not let them try...
zQhixyRCaa	my doctor said the tenth day, i would try an ovulating test but there is a possibility that you could be pregnant i would start on the tenth day and have sex every other day not every day because it can lower his sperm count good luck and sending baby dust

F3dWvVy5aa	Not pregnant. Your just stressed.|`|7uNjjP06aa	it needs to be in you, you say it rubbed around, not equivalent to having semen in your body. it is not a bug that can crawl into your vagina hole.|`|3aBZanXAaa	dont do that with ur cloths off|`|0jpep8S9aa	No|`|AA11282101	not klikely at all.. 1 in several hundred thousand actually. but not completly impossible probably just the stress.|`|whYlVR2saa	if that is the only exposure you have had to semen, then you are not pregnant. you should probably learn a little more about conception before you start having sex with people. maybe be a little more careful.

AA11348933	No.  My oldest didn't bother crawling because she was busy cruising.  She was cruising by 6 months and walking by 10 months.  Her brain is fine.  Her pediatrician says she's perfectly normal.|`|gx4s68s8aa	I think that is completely ridiculous.  My daughter just didn't see a need to crawl. She enjoyed standing up.  And from standing she wanted to start walking.  She never enjoyed tummy time.  I think so children just don't like being on the floor like that.  She always seemed to want to see as much as possible.<br>  <br>  My daughter's doctor was not concerned at all that my daughter walked (at 9 months) and never crawled until 18 months.  The doctor doesn't see crawling as an important milestone.|`|lGSUToFQaa	wow, i have a degree, i worked for 3 yrs as a child psychologist and i grad in may with a masters in pediatrics, i have never heard of this before, some baby's don't crawl, they just don't for whatever reason, my son is 7 months old and he knows how to crawl but unless you give him an incentive to crawl he won't, if you put his fave toy or book on one corner of the blanket he will crawl to it and stop, he doesn't like it, my aunt's baby never crawled, but started walking at 9 months, so she skipped it all together, some baby's do i am sure you have nothing to worry about, have a great week.|`|pVWk12oOaa	The only thing I've heard is that babies who go straight to walking have worse depth perception (whether they mean right away or later in life I don't know). That's just something I heard from a friend, I don't know if I believe it. My little guy is 9 months and not crawling. He loves to stand (although doesn't pull himself up yet, he just wants us to hold his hands while he stands and "walks") He hates being on his belly! I have a feeling he'll skip crawling and I'm not too worried!!! :)|`|JsEd4H0raa	I don't think so but I could be wrong. My neighbor he will be 2 the end of June 2009. He is also deaf and he hasn't crawled. he is pulling himself along with his arms and he is starting to pull himself up onto every piece of furniture and his mother and I think he is going to go right to walking. I don't think so.|`|2448af06b59df00dd8a1a3ac6d057c75aa	i have work in special education for yrs and all the pros say it is a myth . i wouldn't worry we are all different . my girl walked super early but hasnt talked early (just normal)|`|y6g0RnuAaa	Well my mom said I went straight to walking. I think my brain developed properly. At least I hope so... good thing my husband isn't going to see this. The jokes would never end.|`|yMHs4V9kaa	I think that is stupid, my daughter wouldn't crawl for the longest time she crawled for like amonth and than started to walk at about 10 months. For me I think it is their personality. She hates to let people do things for her and she realized walking got her things faster and she was more independent that way. If he is having like motor skill issues like can't bring hand to mouth, strenght problems or something like that than yes there may be an issue but undeveloped brain because they skip a step no to me they are smarter LOL|`|Mr6U1TiHaa	no that is not true.. AT aLL..... my nephew skiped crawling because my siste put him on the walker alot.....kids do that sometimes, not all babies crawl..and my nephew is a very very smart boy..i dont think part of his brain didnt develop..tell thaT CO-WORKER TO FIND SOMETHING BETTER TO DO|`|95pvqcMpaa	Thats really silly in my opinion. Some babies just hate being on their stomach. My cousin never crawled first she started walking early though and later learned to crawl when she saw other babies crawling.|`|H2ZMDc4Iaa	Our doctor told us babies learn from the core outward -- meaning they roll, then crawl, stand, then walk.<br>  <br>  But, some kids skip crawling and may roll or wiggle alot, then begin to pull themselves up to stand. My daughter is 7 months, she can crawl somewhat, but in a walker she can go forwards, backwards, and turn in circles. So my thought is she's kinda of trying it all out at once, because she also pulls herself up on certain things.<br>  <br>  I wouldnt worry about it, it isnt really common that a baby skips crawling, but they've been known to do it. I don't see why there would be something wrong with it.|`|Ye88kT6Uaa	It doesn't neccesarily mean that part of their brain didn't develop, but crawling is very good for a child in developing the ability to focus, pay attention to detail, and use hand eye coordination because they put so much effort into their movements and when they are only a couple of inches away from most of the things they see they pay attention and focus on those things.  Sometimes it can affect children who start walking without ever crawling later in life when they learn to read (it can be difficult to concentrate and focus on what they are learning).  The only time I would get worried is if he loses interest in things or never crawls and doesn't want to walk either (usually between 12-15 months but sometimes they walk earlier).  My daughter crawled from 5 mos.-10 mos. and then started walking.  My son didn't crawl until 6 1/2 almost 7  mos.-12 mos and then started walking..so every child is different.  I'm sure he will be okay :)

7mLeksI3aa	Just keep the Wii. You might even get a 360 eventually. They probably won't sell it because they just spent $250 on the Wii and don't want to just get rid of it because that's kind of wasteful. Feel lucky that you even have a Wii and a choice of a 360.|`|rAEIG2jbaa	beg them and make them breakfast|`|qz7c0deYaa	Well, does any of your family uses the Wii? If not you can tell them that NO ONE ever plays the Wii and it'll just sit there and gain dust on itself. Tell them you would use the 360 a lot more than the Wii and you'll actually put it to use then just having a white box sitting there for years. But if they actually play the Wii then that would be a little unfair to them and you could always do chores and have other ways of making money to buy a 360. Then you can have both a Wii and a 360. But best of luck~!!|`|KYC8SrPnaa	Do nothing.|`|f3b1660d1175bdca51838f4f15b36b49aa	just enjoy your game and count your blessings.|`|XrKviWgSaa	dont.|`|t0VQGp0Jaa	get on your knees

They might not be as accurate as other brands, if tested too early. The longer you wait to test, the higher your HCG levels will be.|`|e7ElUQ9Raa	yup. I used 2 when i found out i was pregnant. All they are just hcg tests. Thats all. You just don't have a fancy stick to pee on!!|`|AA12226162	yes|`|QwHLZaS6aa	maybe but i would get a more expensive one to be sure|`|GBpLZ2REaa	They are ok but they aren't as sensitive. When I first found out that I was pregnant, the dollar store test barely showed a pink line. I took a First Response test and it was a definite positive. I think the dollar store tests just don't show positive as early in the pregnancy as the name brands do.|`|28QPS6V9aa	I've heard many people say they are, but from my own experience I'm not impressed with them. I had two false results from dollar tree brand tests. If you want cheap, I found the equate brand at Walmart works well. I've never had any problems with theirs and they're not overly spendy.|`|izSUt509aa	absolutely not - unless you don't care about an accurate reading.  Dollar store items are usually knockoffs and unreliable|`|JfrBedpJaa	i wouldnt say just as good but use three and they will probibly be accurate|`|pZu6Mk42aa	they have a 98% accuracy|`|d949d6371febf9695b8f8993df12ab4caa	yep they work just as good as the expensive ones|`|HvQjU2vCaa	You would have to check and see

It looked really good. <br>  For you, dont get stuff you're not comfortable in. if you dont like tight stuff, dont get it too tight. look at stores like forever 21 and old navy has great clothes for men adn women that are cheap. <br>  <br>  if you tell me more about what you like to wear i can try help more<br>  <br>  ETA~ Def check out old navy<br>  <a href="http://oldnavy.gap.com/browse/product.do?cid=11174&pid=634835&scid=634835002" rel="nofollow">http://oldnavy.gap.com/browse/product.do...</a><br>  <a href="http://oldnavy.gap.com/browse/product.do?cid=46470&pid=634297" rel="nofollow">http://oldnavy.gap.com/browse/product.do...</a><br>  <a href="http://oldnavy.gap.com/browse/product.do?cid=46470&pid=634370" rel="nofollow">http://oldnavy.gap.com/browse/product.do...</a>|`|CVdcrY3kaa	Try stores like Marshalls, TJ Maxx, and other stores like that.

jaT35u4oaa	When I was pregnant, my doctor figured out my due date according to my last period and date of conception. The ultrasound was off by a week. In the end, both were wrong anyway, as my daughter was late. <br>  <br>  Don't stress about it! Some people have their babies 3 weeks early, some have them 2 weeks late.... the baby will come when he/she is ready. Just stay healthy and take care of yourself!
BOJEbnCtaa	I like the way you spelled it. I love the name|`|5y9kJjDdaa	I have a friend named Alisha. Its a cute and nice name, and your way of spelling is good to. I lke it better than alicia, cause to me alicia is pronounced UHH-LEE-SHEE-A, and yours is A-Lee-Sha, which is the way you pronounce it.|`|zGjZG1wSaa	I have a personal fondness to the name Alicia. Alisha is good, but I worked with an Alisha and she was very particular on how you pronounced her name. Are you thinking of UH-LEE-SHA or UH-LISH-UH as the pronunciation? At least it's not a ridiculous name. Good luck.|`|7XIWtNr6aa	Alicia is a better spelling.|`|EPIpgw2Gaa	i like it but only spelled alicia.|`|6QLlaONDaa	no I dont like it it sounds too playful|`|f6526244f4eebe959379baecf04684a1aa	I like it kind of so so because if your kid learns about militias it would kind of sound strange.

bGIKzvBEaa	the nicotine would have been out of her system for SO long by the time the baby was born. that sounds completely ridiculous! i wonder what nursing school let her in. ha|`|udUzdU7Raa	Ignore all the other responses. The nurse is right.<br>  When pregnant mothers smoke or take other drugs, it enters the baby's system. This happens to hundreds of baby's. They are then cruelly put through the withdrawal symptoms when they are born. Even though she quit early in the pregnancy, it still would have entered the baby's system and stayed there.<br>  The nurse wasn't lying.|`|whYlVR2saa	well, i have never heard of withdrawals from cigarettes. just a small piece of knowledge....my mom smoked throughout all three of her pregnancies and we never had withdrawals, i could be a bit taller though. just joking!|`|zmpk29BLaa	maybe shes withdrawing from crack. is your sil a druggie?|`|SnJVwA95aa	It's not the smoke, it's the nicotine. <br>  <br>  Do you see any reason why this nurse would make something up like this? Most nurses have better things to do than make up stories to their patients and their families. And, it just so happens that she did smoke for 12 weeks.   <br>  <br>  Perhaps your sister smoked more frequently than she said she did. If she smoked during the first 12 weeks (the most critical time for the fetus development), this already shows she has bad judgment- so, it's not unreasonable to think she actually smoked past this time and didn't tell anyone. <br>  <br>  I would have her talk to a pediatrician about the topic.|`|JduQHocdaa	She probably bs'd her husband into believing she wasn't smoking. She probably did smoke throughout her pregnancy, I find it to highly unlikely. That a baby would go through withdrawals if she quit in the beginning of the pregnancy. I hope the little ones are doing better!|`|PN7ELn3aaa	Um, yeah, that is pretty ridiculous sounding. I think that if she was off of the cigs for that long the baby wouldn't be suffering withdraw. <br>  <br>  Weird...shouldn't she be checking for colic or something?|`|hAuemuWTaa	Well that the nurses cover up. they failed to soothe a baby. and didnt no wat to do, so blame the mum. <br>  It could be something else happen with the baby, that night. As it doesnt take tat long.|`|i9M0U9Meaa	i think the nurse needs to stop bein so nosey. that's what i would of told her! the baby wouldn't be going through with drawls like that. you SIL should have checked the nurses degree!! :)|`|kT7GVOosaa	yes that is ridiculous. it sounds like the nurse got fed up with a fussy baby and wanted to blame someone other then herself.|`|3cLE5L7Saa	I don't think the baby would be withdrawling from cigs....yeah, it sounds redic to me.
BTuFtui3aa	They can't be identical, but they can look as alike as any other set of non-identical siblings. They don't have the same genetic code and came from different eggs, but they can have a very strong family resemblance. Not identical, but could look very very similar (or could look very very different, depending how the genes work out.)|`|f3c8a5f174ca386a6855ce97b71adbfbaa	I don't think they can be identical identical, but I definitely think they can look alike. My twin bro and I are total opposites though.|`|wZtv16syaa	It is very possible for the children to look the same but they will not be identical because identical twins came from the same egg that split in two.|`|AA11537580	they can not be identical!!<br>  they can look very similar but never identical|`|b978f631fc787a963337206aa3833370aa	Identical twins are ALWAYS the same sex. However, fraternal twins can look as much alike as any other pair of siblings.
WkaWSKNAaa	The standard is to go by the first day of your last menstrual period.  If you think your dates are off, the doctor can order an ultrasound to determine for sure how far you are.|`|2de422e579b099a457e9236ca0a2b210aa	You are at 7-8 weeks of your 40-week gestation cycle. This cycle includes the weeks between your LMP and conception/implantation. It does *not* mean the fetus is 7-8 weeks old.|`|W1p6LetFaa	Nope, that's exactly right.  They measure your pregnancy from your last period (LMP) and not from when you conceived.  I have no idea why they do it that way, but they do.  This means that you will always be 2 weeks "more" pregnant than when you actually conceived.  So that's exactly why you are 7 or 8 weeks pregnant when you actually conceived 2 weeks later than that.  Weird, isn't it?<br>  <br>  Best wishes to you and your little one!|`|qUS9Zwl6aa	They date it back to the first date of your last period. And 7-8 weeks sounds about right, You ovulate typically 2 weeks after your period which would put you right about January 13th for your fertile time. I just found out that I am pregnant 5 weeks exactly, and I conceived on January 29th. So that puts you a couple weeks ahead of me. Congrats!|`|AA10015577	They only use that date by your LMP for a reference.  Wait until you get an ultrasound and they will give you a more determined EDD (estimated due date).  It's just how they have a EDD for you.  Good luck!|`|kT7GVOosaa	you are right but they have to go off your last period until the ultrasound proves otherwise. just go with it for now but be ready that your due date will change

lTDeZ0Obaa	You should absolutely find a therapist you feel 100% comfortable with.<br>  <br>  BUT, have you considered that in her work at PP she may be counseling people about their decision to have an abortion and to perhaps consider other options. A counselor or therapist at an abortion provider is not there to convince the person to have an abortion...they are there because they have chosen to have an abortion...the counselor is there to talk to them, find out if that is the decision they are truly comfortable with, that they have made the decision for the right reasons, talk about other options, etc. with them. Your therapist is helping you through a difficult time, just as she helps other people through difficult times. You may not believe in abortion, but do you believe women should receive counseling prior to undergoing abortion? You do not know what led these women to this decision. This woman is just doing what she was trained to do. Just remember...therapists see all kinds of patients. You never know who else your therapist is treating. It's their job to help troubled people of all kinds and all backgrounds with all problems.<br>  <br>  But, to get the help you need you have to have a therapist you feel comfortable with and that you trust. So, if it's not this woman find someone else.|`|a8faa51f64a988b0e4081e561a610820aa	I think you should find another therapist right away. I can tell from your speech patterns here that you're suffering from an acute case of anxiety right now. I know how that feels, believe you me! You should ask your therapist if she can refer you to someone else. If she can't, then you should go to your primary care physician and ask for a referral. If that doesn't work, call your insurance company and ask them for a referral. Good luck!|`|wZtv16syaa	I think if you feel like you are being judge by your therapist (for any reason) then you will not feel comfortable enough with her to be honest and therefore will probably not benefit much if at all.
cIn8BkYHaa	I had the scan that was supposed to be 12 weeks yesterday, but then they told me I was only ten weeks due to the size of the baby. It is important to have one at 12 weeks they can see if there are any red flags for birth defects, and the sooner you catch anything the better it is. I would definately find yourself an OB very soon, since you are already 9 weeks, I think they like to see you for the first time around 10 weeks. Good luck, hope everything turns out fine. :)|`|KNxs4PrZaa	you need to see a OB as soon as possible, they are trained for these kind of issues during pregnancy, it is important to just have one doctor following your progress so you are not getting mixed messages or treatment and that doctor needs to be an OB, get the referall right away and start going to the OB they will tell you correctly what to do.|`|AGlpdpAKaa	i'd go to a walk in clinic and get another doctor to refer you, definitely.  your doctor sounds kindof like a jerk.  i don't see why he wouldn't write up a requisition for you.  that's lame! definitely get another doctor, get back and get that second dating scan.|`|4hNdYjjraa	i got my 12 week scan, it was beautiful, you need to see your baby's development. all pregnant women should get this scan. tell him he has no choice you want the scan, if he is your doctor its your rights not his, this is about you and your baby.|`|WkaWSKNAaa	It doesn't make sense that you were told you to go back for the proper dating scan.  There is no specific time to be able to tell dates.  The ultrasound calculations show what the baby is at that time.  <br>  <br>  As for the 12 wk scan, it is done to evaluate what is called the nuchal  translucency, which is a specific area in the back of the neck.  An increased measurement indicates an increased risk for Down's.<br>  <br>  The next scan is done between 20-22 wks to check the baby's anatomy for any abnormalities.  It is the best time to see all of the organs properly.  16 wks is too early and not appropriate.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps clarify things.|`|xq7S9H5Raa	You are still early in the pregnancy.  Get another doctor and also you need an OB/GYN.
Tj2jMlTvaa	Both of mine moved into the position at about 32-34 weeks and it just felt like nomal when they move around in you. The only thing that made me realize what they were doing was because down there it just felt a little heavier...sounds weird but it does and when they kicked i could feel and see there feet straight up now|`|kbcPPGfvaa	The last month or two before birth.With your family history,it might be a breech birth(Feet first);so make sure your delivery team knows ahead of time.|`|KMtd5gr0aa	out of the 4 ive already had the first 3 they were ready to go by the 6th month my very last baby girl never did go into position i ended up with a c section.

The only difference I noticed was that her hiccups moved.  The entire pregnancy I had felt them by my left ovary, but suddenly I felt them under my ribcage.  That was the only thing that tipped me off.  But she still hasn't dropped yet, and I'm due in 3 days.  Arg!|`|tQPvv0Glaa	My first one didn't - he was breech.  My second one was still in the upright position at 32 weeks, but she moved into the right (head down) position before birth and I never felt anything.
lGcpXteaaa	Oh i hear you!! <br>  I have two dogs a chihauha and a bulldog. The little one is no problem but the bulldog has been a hassle since the baby has been brought home. 10 months ago!!<br>  <br>  But it is totally my fault. She doesnt get enough walks even though i have to find the time to take her out for an hour a day..shes a strong dog and sometimes its impossible to take her out with the baby. The lack of exercise is what causes them to destroy things, its out of boredom.<br>  I suggest trying to walk her more often, or try to distract her. Along with discipline and praise of course.<br>  <br>  She sometimes really gets on my nerves because she is so much work but then i just try to remember she has feelings too and doesnt mean to be annoying. That helps a lot! <br>  <br>  I send you sanity! x|`|2448af06b59df00dd8a1a3ac6d057c75aa	you are jsut over welled , wait till your girl falls in love with him and it will not matter and the dog loves her a  wonderful protector !!|`|54f89f63b29123e8efe33f4bdc6a2d74aa	Oh my.. that is a hairy dog. He's probably acting out now because of the baby. Dogs are just like children, they get jealous and want the attention they used to get. If they don't get it anymore, they become destructive. Just like children, any attention, negative or positive, is good attention. <br>  <br>  I felt the same way when I came home with my son - all the dog hair drove me nuts. Luckily we have a big yard and I was able to move them outside. They transitioned pretty smoothly, considering they lived in the house for almost 6 years.<br>  <br>  I feel awful though, because they don't get the attention they used to get before I had my son.<br>  <br>  All I can think of, is that you need to take him for frequent walks so he can run off his energy. Bundle baby in the stroller, attach the dog's lead to the stroller and take them both for a walk.<br>  <br>  Groom him as often as you possibly can. With a dog his size, with all that hair I'd also suggest you take him to a professional doggy parlor and have him shaved once a month. I have a border collie and she's shaved frequently - far less hair to deal with than before.<br>  <br>  I'm sorry, I wish I had better advice for you. But, short of giving your dog a new home, that's the best I can come up with.|`|FLpMShKNaa	I think you are in a tough position cause my hubby and I are reversed-he'd rather be without pets, but it would break my heart. Of course I clean up after them. So, consider talking to the vet about some obedience training, maybe the local humane society has low cost classes. Also he may have anxiety the vet could suggest some meds to help with that. Even begging hubby to walk the dog and burn off more energy might help. I hope you guys can make it work, if not please find a no kill rescue group or some place you know he has a chance for a good home.|`|P0AprKg7aa	Why did you get a dog if you hate it? He's just being a dog, that's how they are. You're being cruel, get over yourself. Seems you're one of those over-obsessive over-protective mothers.|`|DcLiW4bbaa	How often is your dog getting walked and for how long?<br>  <br>  Dogs need to exercise every day (walking, running, playing, w/e) so if he's not getting enough then he will turn his energy to other things, like chewing on things he's not supposed to.<br>  <br>  Also, does he have his own toys? Or more then just a couple? Maybe you could get him more of his own chew toys so he'll leave the babies toys alone. Or you can get him some of those rawhide bones, my dogs love those.<br>  <br>  I have a 2 month old baby and so far the dogs have been great, but they have a big back yard that they run and play in for at least an hour every day so they have an outlet for their energy.<br>  <br>  As for the hair, I have to brush my German Shepherd at least 3 times a week or there is hair all over the place. Plus I vacuum a lot and sweep the floors to keep up on it. <br>  <br>  It can be hard to fit that stuff in with taking care of the baby, but maybe you can get someone to help you out. Maybe pay a neighbor kid $10 to take your dog out for an hour or something. Good luck!|`|HqOkC2YHaa	I agree with Mommy and wife...my dogs only get destructive if they aren't taken for walks or ran everyday. Also since you are not home all day you should consider buying a dog create to leave him in during the day he won't like it at first but if you make it a good experiance to put him in he will get used to it,and no surprises when you get home! My dogs know they will be in there for awhile when we give them a treat and they know when they have been bad when they go in without a treat. Also try and keep a baby gate to the room that has all the babies toys this way not to confuse the dog that these toys are for him too.<br>  <br>  Not sure how well your dog is when it comes to walking, but if the pulling is down to a minimum you could go walking everytime you go out with the baby and attach the leash to the stroller...but if your dog pulls a lot it's not a good idea (I have 1 dog that can walk with the stroller but my other one will make it tip over)<br>  <br>  Also if you devote about 10-15min in a day where your child is not around (maybe during naps) to love and cuddle the dog it would help too...because remember the dog was there first and is probably jealous of the baby because all the attenion has now left him and is now directed elsewhere<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|KyhnSRrJaa	What changed that made you start hating him after you had the baby?  Do you not have the time to take him out and work off all his extra energy now?  The dog did not change... he's still being a dog, you changed or something in your household changed to make you hate the poor little puppy.<br>  <br>  If he's destroying your house while you're gone, you could try crate training him.  My dog loves his crate, and even though he's good and doesn't need to be put in the crate anymore, he is so used to it, he goes in there by himself anyway when we're not home.<br>  <br>  If your dog is older, though, I don't know if it would take a little more training to be able to put him in a cage.<br>  <br>  As for the hair, that's no reason to hate a dog... just vaccuum a lot, groom the dog, and deal with it.  They're dogs... they shed, you can't do much about that.|`|TWCskV2aaa	Dogs are smart creatures...maybe he knows you "hate" him or at least resent him. Try having him take a walk once a day. If you really feel you can't handle him then it is not fair to him or yourself to keep him. Maybe you should slowly find him a new home BUT this is your husband AND yours decision. I have a 6 month old and two dogs one that sheds A LOT but I love the reewards they give me even if they are a lot of work. Talk to your husband!|`|b5ae6c4a0700956c375f37b49f896632aa	i would suggest to get rid of the dog.. the destructive behavior is not a good sign and he has a potential of treating your baby as a rival (your attention, your love and your time spent with baby means less time for the dog).. and let's be perfectly honest here - he IS an animal.. he's not a human but an animal.. i cannot vouch for my own sister at times and i dont know if you can predict what the dog will come up with in the future.. he's been with you for awhile, so take this time to find a good home for him.|`|YmEGCGtnaa	i have been in a  similar predicament...my bf and his dang cat. first when i was pregnant i was kinda iffy about keeping herr bc he HARDLY EVER changed her litter box even though that was HIS cat, and i was not going to risk putting my baby at risk for toxoplasmosis effects and damages to change her cat box. then, when our baby was born, a couple months later, the cat developed a terrible flea problem and then worms. mind you, i know it isn't the cat's fault and i felt bad for her, but she wasnt' my cat, i didn't feel responsible for her, my bf agreed since i was doing so much for the baby, and he barely helping) that he would keep taking care of the cat more. but he didn't. and so her fleas manifested and grew in the house, were in our bed sheets, on our baby's crib, etc. to top it off, she had tapeworms yuck which is contagious to humans, esp. infants, though even then rare. but it was still the principle of the matter rare or not. then our baby got  a bunch of flea bites and i just got soooo mad...i said either i'm going to take the cat to his mom's one day and if no1 is home just leave her on the porch (shes an indoor never been outside) and he saw how serious and mad I was, he got really mad at me, finally I realized it wasn't even worth it w/him if he was going to value the cat as much as our baby to the point where it was putting HER at risk, so I said "fine, you care so much about that cat? we'll leave" and i was dead serious.  and finally he acted. he got her professional flea treatment and that solved both the flea and worm problem. and for a few months after he continuously gave her flea baths and treatment.<br>  I suggest just try talking to him about your feelings and see what he says. Maybe he could take him to obedience school? or train him to be an outside dog instead that comes in only at night time? <br>  Honestly this is making your life as a mom much harder. and i do know how you feel---when the cat had fleas, i had to vacuum so much, to keep them from multiplying. and i had to bathe my daughter more often bc they would sometimes get in her hair terrible i know. <br>  Maybe sit down with him and tell him all that you have to do with the baby and then the dog. Maybe he could take care of the dog more than you do? clean up after him, etc.?|`|CVdcrY3kaa	How often is he taken on walks? He sounds like he has a lot of built up energy that definitely needs released, especially if he's living in a home without a huge yard to play in. I have a Norwegian Elkhound (also a massive shedder) I have to brush him three times a week, and once a day during shedding season. I walk him an hour a day and it takes a lot of work to keep up with everything he needs. SOmetimes I do get irritated, it's so much extra work...but that's what being a dog-mom is sometimes!
cqVU2IjWaa	skin color is not as easy as being termed dominant or recessive.  skin color is based more on blending of the genes for skin color.  the extent to which the  chemical reactions that form skin pigment are catalyzed, which could be based on a number of genes, would determine the offspring's skin color.  you and your husband may or may not pass these genes on to your offspring. from your description of you and your partner,and as a a general rule,  i would expect the child to probably look halfway between you and your husband.|`|sV2mmEadaa	well i know, this might be different but if he has skin color like iranians then...<br>  i am iranian, tan skin, i am darker than my mother, brown eyes<br>  my mother is iranian, tan skin, brown eyes.<br>  my father is iranian, if you saw him in the street you would never know that he is iranian, he looks like a typical white male that you would see, and he has green eyes..<br>  <br>  i did not pay much attention in biology class but thats all i can tell you and i am sure that is a good enough example.|`|qW5jLIJtaa	Of course it is.  The hispanic gene is most likely the more dominant, like Asian.  When judging a babys' skintone, it's kind of like the lotto, in a cheesy sense. It's the same combination, but different result every time.  But your child will most likely have tan skin, especially if YOU tan easily.  Hope this helped!|`|QxX1Nz3oaa	No, because one of my friends has green eyes, black hair, and white skin. So does his 3 year old brother (hes 10). His parents both have dark skin, dark eyes, and dark hair. They are Bangladeshi. So in rare cases it will not be dominant.|`|FLpMShKNaa	It all depends-kids can get dominant or recessive genes for skin just like all else. My husband is Asian, I am a very fair redhead, our son has very white skin, hazel eyes and brown hair. There is no doubt he is mixed because of his eye shape, but coloring wise he's very light.

Make some coleslaw/potato salad and corn on the cob with some drinks.<br>  <br>  If you mean "grilling" and are just calling it BBQ then hot dogs or burgers are easiest with some chips, set out different condiments and maybe some kind of salad (fruit or pasta are good, especially if you have people that won't eat meat coming).<br>  <br>  As for goody bags, if it is a BBQ theme how about getting each of the kids a canvas apron from the craft store and let them use some fabric paint and stamps to decorate them.  Do some balloons and let the kids take them home afterwards.<br>  <br>  There is also the option of getting red bandanas and putting in some bubbles, sidewalk chalk, stickers and tie it up in a little bundle to give each child.|`|bmoCpcdraa	hot dogs cheese burgers corn on the cob grilled butter bread cup cakes bob the apple marshmellows chips juice boxes them whole dill pickels .....finger food and paper plates    lots of ketcup kids like to dip.....you could bake a big pan of tator tots.........or fries......................................

We're huge eggs, bacon, sausage, and croissant lovers - especially sausage and eggs. <br>  <br>  I don't see any rule in the book that says you're children can't have "breakfast food" for dinner.

HuKDmP4Paa	Well I would fire her. But I wouldn't do it officially, I just wouldn't call her back for her services and use someone else. If you guys don't go out often it won't be a question of being fired or not. If she ever confronts you about it you can just say that you don't feel that she is up to handling four kids. I'm 20 and about to be a mother, and when I baby sit my aunts 3 kids it can be a hair puller (ages 4, 3, 2), so I can understand to an extent, but what she did was plain wrong. If she doesn't know that you can't let little ones out of her site she shouldn't be baby sitting. It only takes 2 seconds for a three year old to get into some hefty trouble, let alone a five year old or one year old. <br>  <br>  This sounds horrible but thankfully your daughter was only sick in the bathroom. If she was that neglectful there are a lot more dangerous things in a bathroom that a child can get into at that age even if you think they are put up. <br>  <br>  Also it sounds like she purposely neglected your daughter. Anytime I have babysat in the past kids are always eager to tell you what the other is up to, whether they are doing right or wrong. So I could see your 8 or 5 year old mentioning that your 3 year old was sick all over the bathroom. Sadly she probably just didn't want to deal with the mess or a sick child. Which is really horrible.<br>  <br>  I hope you don't use her again, for your kids sake because next time something could go seriously wrong, not just caffeine and a missed bedtime.|`|8LrnysX8aa	Yes.  Find a new babysitter. I'd try to find someone a little older, even it means that you'll have to pay them a little more.|`|BRT2teSqaa	Cmon now..<br>  Obviously you should fire her<br>  Why did you pay her and WHY are you even asking this!?|`|AA10475412	Fire her and explain why.|`|HqbFzOnSaa	YES|`|BUyu6vL4aa	First of all, you should let TWO girls, a little older, responsible, kid-friendly baby-sitters watch your kids. Do you really think that a 15 year old girl could handle 4 kids? Up to 12 am? I'm really sorry to put you down like this but when you want to hire a sitter, talk to the sitter and her parents and other people who know the girl well so you can make sure she is very responsible.<br>  And yes, do fire her.|`|hNr3GFvlaa	Four children are a handful not every 16-year old girl is equipped to deal with. <br>  <br>  I would replace this babysitter, the main reason her lack of care and lack of attention.<br>  <br>  I would be careful when hiring one and be sure to convey expectations or even better, provide a checklist we can go over together before and after the evening. <br>  <br>  With a 1-year old in the house, I'd want someone who is caring and alert so that if something wrong happens, there would be a fast and proper response. <br>  <br>  I would prefer paying a little more and get the best babysitter around, who I know will be kind and attentive to my kids.|`|uHzBl17maa	Yes I think you should, I am 16 and want to start babysitting but I would never agree to babysit that many kids if I know I can't handle it. I also think if she tried harder and distracted them by doing things with them, they would have been more complying to the rules.<br>  <br>  <br>  As for her using your straightener, that is not right. She is there to work for you not use your things! And your poor baby, she should have called you to tell you your child was sick!|`|RMYvrn1Qaa	YES. Fire her. There are much more responsible teens out there.<br>  Consider the worst situation...|`|qW5jLIJtaa	Yes.  Your children are your the most precious things on this earth, they deserve to be taken care of the correct way.|`|F6lZHRkVaa	I didn't really read your entire question, but your headline alone is enough. If you even *think* about considering firing your babysitter, you should absolutely fire her. You don't need a babysitter that you have to think about firing. You need a babysitter that you'd never consider firing. Good luck!|`|b978f631fc787a963337206aa3833370aa	Oh, that poor, poor baby! It breaks my heart to even hear that she had to endure that by herself! What was going on? It doesn't sound like she's done this before, based on your brief description. <br>  <br>  I think yes, not asking her to babysit anymore is definitely in order. You don't even have to fire her, per se - just don't call her anymore. That is absolutely terrible and I can't even imagine how you must have felt coming home to that mess. Those poor kids!<br>  ETA: Dear Lord, I just thought of something - was she sick because she got into something in the bathroom? I hope not.|`|35JIECGRaa	Yes! After all that, why would you even ask? Sorry, that sounded harsher than I meant it to be ... but those are your kids, and if you were a kid with a babysitter like that, would you want her to be your babysiter? To be someone who doesn't care to check on you when you're sick?<br>  <br>  That is just appalling, and I wouldn't have even paid her after that!|`|nKXTjqQWaa	I think 4 kids for a 15 year old is a bit much. I think if there were two 15 year olds it would be better. I would fire her or get her a helper. If you fire her get someone older and more mature. 4 kids under the age of 8 is a lot for a young girl.|`|SlBsJ3NRaa	Yes, she should be fired. I personally would not leave 4 kids with a 15 year old. That was a mistake.|`|2Pp2cDbJaa	no i would sit her down and lecture her and then i would talk to her parents and warn anyone else who might want to hire her not to. I know i put little nanny cams in the house when i have someone watch the kids, so i can watch when im out or at work. They are a life saver i want to know whats going on when im not their, If im paying them they better be doing what they are being paid to do<br>  <br>  <br>  personally if i came home to that, i would have yelled at her then told her to go, and i sure as hell would not pay her

Every baby develops differently, even in the womb, but based on what I read, it is possible.|`|2448af06b59df00dd8a1a3ac6d057c75aa	defently way to early i dont think there parts are even there yet. i did at 18 weeks and i thought i was pussing it <br>  we are having a boy <br>  our girls u/s was at 21 weeks|`|24a78cc0007d10093367ee4cc375a0f6aa	You are going to have the wait a few more weeks.  Even the 3d/4d places don't do sex determination until 15 weeks.|`|AA11282101	amniosentis(not sure of spelling) is the only way.. but your doc wont do it for no reason . best to just be paitent until about 20 weeks:)
OCTvfDsxaa	Try to quit smoking but if you can't (because of with drawl) use the patches. The feelings your having is a form of morning sickness.|`|lJIzFC8iaa	This did happen to me. I was not having symptoms yet, but I would start to smoke and throw up. I quit the next day and that next week the symptoms can full on. Took a test and it was positive. So if you think you could be, you should try to quit. For you and the baby. Good Luck.|`|hr24wI0daa	My best friend had that problem throughout most of her pregnancy. She just dealt with it. So you either deal or you quit. I suggest quitting but that is your choice.|`|0ER34nnqaa	dont smoke if it makes you throw up!! the baby is probably reacting negatively to it!! dont smoke anyways!!|`|RjoCYCkQaa	You have never opened a book have you.
oiJITSNZaa	I myself cannot at all recommend clomid. I had terrible side effect even though it was a very low dose. I had headaches lots worse than migranes...to the point of throwing up til I couldn't any more. PLUS severe cramps and many other living hell side effects. As far as when to start and how much ask your doctor after all you should be following a doctor's orders because they must check evry few days and several ultrasounds because clomid can cause cysts and when that happens you must wait for the cysts to clear up b4 continuing. Trust me I know.|`|0e27a736d12fa17e74fd3387bd95aa93aa	You should research basal body temperature beforehand. Temp for quite a while before even requesting it. Any doctor worth your money will want to see something like that first. Clomid has some rather nasty side effects for some....and more than just a few. You need to be prepared adn know your cycles before you start so it takes the least amount of cycles. You take clomid on very specific days of your cycle, either 3-7 or 5-9 for most women. You should take the absolute lowest dose possible. I took it for more cycles than should have been allowed adn was still unsuccessful. I did go on several years later to have 2 children without help.<br>  I only have on average 2 or 3 cycles a year when not on BC or something else.|`|oqUlYXqtaa	most doctors will start you with 50mg and then move you up to 100mg if necessary, they'll also tell you when to take it sometimes they'll want you to start on cycle day 3 or cycle day 5. it can work for many so it's good to talk to your Dr. about it,<br>  you can also ask doctors online for free and find others who are takiing clomid, try fertilityties.com<br>  good luck!!
tQPvv0Glaa	Yes, it sounds like that would be right around your ovulation time.|`|oqUlYXqtaa	i think you cover your fertile period :) good luck! you can test 2 days before your next period is due, you can also ask doctors online for free, try fertilityties.com<br>  good luck!!|`|ULo8Cwdfaa	If you have sex, theres a chance of getting pregnant, always.|`|oHNrktxTaa	Yes, there is always a chance:) <br>  <br>  Wishing  you TONS OF BABY DUST!!!!!!<br>  <br>  Keep me posted:)
4cehW3S9aa	Start studying in your spelling book because you are terrible at spelling!<br>  <br>  Homework should definitely be your priority after reading this.|`|2448af06b59df00dd8a1a3ac6d057c75aa	who ?|`|OCTvfDsxaa	It's still open for debate!!!
SnJVwA95aa	Perhaps there was a mistake, I would have them retest. <br>  <br>  hCG levels *must* go up (until around week 16 where it then levels off) for a healthy pregnancy. As the embryo grows, the level of hCG rises and, as a general rule, hCG beta numbers should double every 36 to 48 hours. A dramatic decrease in the levels may indicate a miscarriage has occurred or is possible. In other words, a miscarriage could be coming. I would definitely get retested in a few days. <br>  <br>  Here is some more info:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.pregnancy-calendars.net/hcg.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.pregnancy-calendars.net/hcg.a...</a>|`|jrCZ6fadaa	it usually means a miscarriage, perhaps the first or second was a mistake. do another.
AA11282101	depends on which way the baby is laying. you could also have the tech just tellyou fiance and tell him to keep it a secreat.|`|2448af06b59df00dd8a1a3ac6d057c75aa	well mine sure looked like a boy i guess i will see in may lol <br>  no really the tech didnt think twice that is wasnt a boy . Ohh fun for you . i couldnt wait but if you can more power to ya girl!  <br>  no zooming needed lol|`|AhBM5w8maa	I'm not sure for everyone else, but when I had mine it was very very very obvious.<br>  You could see my little boy's penis right there on the screen.<br>  Then the ultrasound technician said that's no girl it's definitely a boy.<br>  <br>  But if you don't want to know then tell the ultrasound tech.|`|W1p6LetFaa	If you tell them you don't want to know, they won't even look in between the legs, so you don't have to worry about seeing something you don't want to see.  But then again, even when they told me what I was looking at, I sure couldn't tell the difference.  I personally think it is SO much easier and more fun to know that I am having a little girl, but you need to make whatever decision is right for you and don't let anyone make you find out if you don't want to know yet!  Best wishes to you and your little one!!|`|3cLE5L7Saa	Mine definitely looked like a boy.  There was a little penis there I'm pretty sure.  I'm due in a couple days, so we'll find out soon.  On the other hand, they told my mom I was a boy and WHOOPS! That was 23 years ago though, I don't know if tech might be better now for that.|`|kT7GVOosaa	if there are three lines it is a girl. three dots its a boy|`|ECTPfxJNaa	only the technician will be able to tell. my mom, boyfriend and i were staring at the sonogram screen the whole time and we had no idea we were looking at my baby's penis until the tech shouted "It's a baby boy!!!" i was astonished because i would have never known it was a boy unless the tech told me|`|AA10381258	I still have the pictures from my ultrasound. No matter how many times they pointed at it, drew arrows, etc, I still don't see what in the heck they are talking about. I just take their word that its a girl. I am also taking their word that those are perfect little hands and feet. I honestly can't see a darn thing, except when they look at the whole baby. I wouldn't worry too much.|`|hAuemuWTaa	No u wont notice it only people trained in tat area no wat they looking at. If they notice than they will point it out to u, tat if u request it. they will show u there is a penis ect. And u will than see it clearly. but if u hve another ultrasound later it is more clearer.|`|lJIzFC8iaa	Well. We really wanted to know. I had my Ultra sound done at 19 weeks and my baby decided to keeps its legs closed the enitre half hour I was in there. Its ultimately up to you too. But remember it may or may not work for ya. Baby may have different plans.|`|ca9dEvSAaa	lol It takes a trained tech to really know what their looking at. You won't know honey. :)

60052eab38f27341cc86e1493496f261aa	For my daughter's first birthday we are doing a blues clues theme.  We are going to have hamburgers and hotdogs for the kids and we are going to do a blues clues game for all the kids where they all get their own notebooks and can try to figure out what blue wants to do.  I'm making a fun birthday cake Blue Clue themed and I made her invitations and decorations.  We bought a large piece of red fabric to go over a chair in our living room for the "thinking chair".  Should be super fun.  She might not really remember it, since she is only 1.  But she will have the pictures :)|`|AA10188961	It's the first party.  If you over do it you're not going to enjoy it and if you have to entertain, you'll miss spending time with your little one.  He/She is too little for a jumper.  My suggestion, keep it close, quiet with family take lots of pictures and revel in the first year of your child's life.  You have another 10 of birthdays with friends and food and mess.|`|TJezsCkHaa	BBQ fr the adults and healthy food for the little ones and play day at the park maybe better than "the jumper" thing.At that age,i don't think so.|`|bmoCpcdraa	a jumper for a 1 year old? have you herd of shaken baby sydrome? bbq is nice but i would not let my 1 year old be shaken' well all my children are grown' i bet if you called the people who rent them, they will tell you there is an age and weight limit to be at least 30 lb.s or so,im not trying to sound mean just check into it,  i hope i helped         i would just have it in your back yard or a family members backyard ,so you can use the frig and stove in house, i would make tator tots for the tots and cheese burgers so they have softer food, and grill whatever elese but it would be less work at a home.|`|PLgNsOF9aa	A first birthday party is something you dont want to make too big of a deal, or too long of a chaotic, loud event or it will backfire and depending on your 1 year old she may be scared, nervous, not herself, or cranky. Keep it low key, have family over, decorate with a cute theme, have visiting, cake, presents and shoo people out the door within a couple of hours.

qz7c0deYaa	Well, you should make your own decision to go or not, but I think even if there is a girl you dislike that's going to be there at least go for your friend. She's kind enough to invite you hoping for you to come to her party but you don't want to go because of one girl? Not only that, all your other friends consider that and still go. It's not like you have to interact with the girl you dislike or anything. Don't worry! I'm not putting you down or anything but this is just my opinion. And just because she befriends with someone you don't like doesn't mean she hates you or anything like that either! There will be people she likes that you won't like and vice-versa. But it doesn't mean she can't be friends with anyone she wants just because of that. As long as she isn't being mean towards you she sounds like a kind person. If you really have some extremely bad blood with this other girl and you think something may start up during the party then it may be best if you do not go. You could be truthful with her and tell her about the girl or you could say you are busy.<br>  What I'm saying is don't let one girl rain on your parade! This is a chance to go to a party AND hang out with a bunch of your friends and have fun! You can't let this one girl keep you hiding in a house forever while your other friends continue to go out and party and grow up on the outside. I hope you are happy with the decision you make! Good luck!<br>  <br>  EDIT:<br>  The girl who is at the party? If she says stuff like that then she doesn't sound like a good friend at all.. but maybe if your friends are with you it won't be as awkward and you could even personally ask one of them to hang out with you throughout ALL the party, so you won't be alone at all. If you do not go and stay home and they group your friends together and get them to dislike you then they weren't good friends to begin with. Good friends believe in you no matter what words are said.|`|uabSXizlaa	Just go to the party|`|zal6shPUaa	stay away from her till after the party|`|yIdwMPsoaa	Be straight forward and tell her the truth.<br>  Be honest.

9ebe04169d04d9c952a946440b3ad139aa	It's a lot of money to pay for a test that has an accuracy rate of 50% i.e the same as a guess! There's no test on the market that can accurately predict the sex of your baby, so save your money, I'm sure there's lots of other things that you could spend it on. Ignore the testimonials, they're not gonna put the negative ones on their website are they?|`|3cLE5L7Saa	Don't waste your money....ask if you can get another ultrasound....you could go get those 3D ultrasounds, and you'll have pics to go along with it.  How does this predicter work?|`|eeyGYRcPaa	if you're 28 weeks your ultrasounds can tell you for free if you have insurance....and besides i would trust the ultrasound over some random test...? sounds like a money scam to me...|`|ME62Mtv4aa	oooo that stinks the cord was in the way, I never bought a test but i've done the chinese gender predictor things online they're only right about 75% of the time but it's something free and fun to do. Nothing to base your nursery on though lol. If you have the $$ to spare just buy it and find out.|`|SxxXBC4vaa	I think you should just wait a couple months when your baby comes. let it be a sweet suprise :) the only 1 true way to know for sure before birth is through an amnio.. what are you hoping for?|`|bc7e0ec8c3bc5dbc9ec1cdd56e6ebe81aa	I can't imagine what this test can do that can predict the sex of the baby.  Most of the "tests" that people use are based on old wives tales.  Can you possibly pay for a 3D ultrasound somewhere?  At least that way if you're going to put out some bucks you can see the whole baby and enjoy the amazing experience.  Do you expect to have any more ultrasounds for any reason?  If so, ask the sex again and maybe this time he/she will give you a better view.  I'd love to hear if anyone that has done the itelligender test actually replies.  Good luck.|`|8C87ZfMwaa	I did try it and it was confirmed by ultrasound, however, if you just get draino from the shop and put a little urine with it you will get the same result, so don''t spend the money.<br>  <br>  Put a couple of teaspoons of draino in a cup (not too small and one you will throw away later) and then about 10ml urine and swirl it around.  Don't get too close because it is potent stuff and it does have a reaction that makes it bubble up.  By the way...it stinks|`|d949d6371febf9695b8f8993df12ab4caa	Ive never heard of that kind of test, but I would just make sure that it is a reliable product and if you have the "extra" money then go ahead and buy it. Or you could wait 2 more months and let it be somewhat of a surprise! Best of luck and Congrats on the baby..|`|1qKvCldEaa	Go for it.. however I wouldn't go nuts and start buying ridiculous amounts of blue or pink things.|`|TorfpKnDaa	I know a few women who have tried it, it's a scam.|`|6Yw4zmJEaa	I took the test and got a girl result which was correct for us. I read that girl results are a bit more accurate the then the boy results as many people who get a boy result still end up having a girl. I guess if you take it and get a girl result then thats a pretty good indicator however if you get a boy result there is still a chance it could be a girl. My advice is if you have the money to spend to take it for fun then go for it, I just wouldn't start buying clothes or decorating based on the results. Best to either get another U/S or just wait for the birth. Good Luck!

TE7foNwMaa	Sorry in advance, my answer will most definitely NOT be the fastest answer... :)<br>  <br>  Boys: <br>  <br>  Zander/Xander Rylan James -- I prefer Zander. Xander just looks kind of clumsy and sci-fi to me. I think Zander flows amazingly will with Rylan and James. It's great. Zander gets 8 / 10, but Xander would only get 5 / 10...<br>  <br>  Xavier Michael James -- I'm assuming that you want Xavier pronounced "ZAY-vee-air / ZAY-vee-er", but I do know a little Mexican boy that pronounces it "HAW-vee-air". I do like Xavier, but the spelling kind of annoys me now that I know it can be pronounced different ways... I suppose I like the pronunciation to be clear and obvious. Zavier might look kind of odd, though... This name flows really well, again. 7 / 10<br>  <br>  Wyatt Lachlan James -- I love Lachlan. Wyatt is also a nice name. It's not too common, but is still classy and comfortable. It also ages really well. 8 / 10<br>  <br>  Aiden Bradley James -- I definitely don't like Aiden, unfortunately... It happens to be the number one most popular name at the moment, and I tend to steer clear of that... Bradley is great, though. 5 / 10.<br>  <br>  Roman Alexander James -- I love this one! Roman is great. This one is probably my favorite so far. I really love it. 9 / 10<br>  <br>  Ashton Ryder James -- I do like Ash... Thanks to the girl that I know (whose name is Ashton), I kind of can't picture Ashton on a boy. I don't think it's a bad name at all, it's just not my style exactly. But I do like Ash and Ryder. 6 / 10.<br>  <br>  Dominic Alexander James -- Dominic Alexander James seems kind of long... It's almost a mouthful for me. Dominic isn't a bad name, but it's another one that's not exactly my style. 6 / 10<br>  <br>  Girls: <br>  <br>  Isla Pamela Grace (EYE-LA) -- I've never really liked Isla. Mostly just because I'm not a fan of names that end with -la for some reason (like Kayla, Layla, Myla, etc.). Plus, I don't like that Isla and Pamela both end with -la. It doesn't flow very well. And I'm not suggesting that you drop Pamela, I'm stating that Isla isn't my favorite name because of this... 5 / 10<br>  <br>  Harlow Pamela Kristy -- I love this one. Harlow is gorgeous, and I really like Kristy as the second middle name. I love this one. 9 / 10<br>  <br>  Liberty Pamela Blaire -- Liberty is cute. I like this one. Blaire flows wonderfully as the second middle name. 7 / 10.<br>  <br>  Vivienne Pamela Rose -- I like Vivienne, especially with Vivi as a nickname. It's nice and classy, and I like that. 8 / 10<br>  <br>  Alison Pamela Maree -- I don't really like the spelling of Maree...is it necessary /or after someone, or can it be changed to Marie? Alison is cute, I really like it. This name flows really well, again. 8 / 10<br>  <br>  Emily Pamela Rain -- I suppose Emily has been pretty abused because of its previous popularity... I would personally still not be ready to use it after its extreme overuse... It's not my favorite. 5 / 10<br>  <br>  Ella Pamela Scott -- Don't worry, I really like Scott with this name. Ella is cute. It seems really sweet and quiet. It's kind of musical and relaxing to me. 8 / 10<br>  <br>  Meredith Pamela Sky -- I don't really like Meredith, I guess... It seems a bit old hat again, to me. It's not a bad name, but not my style. 5 / 10.<br>  <br>  <br>  So, my favorite boys name is...<br>  Roman Alexander James. I absolutely love it.<br>  <br>  And my favorite girls name is...<br>  Harlow Pamela Kristy. It's amazing.

F4Byhsm5aa	My 3 year old has had tubes twice now.  He has such bad fluid build up that he lost over 75% of his hearing before the first tubes.  He was almost completely deaf when they put them in and two weeks later he was back to 100% hearing.  And while the tubes are in, he never gets ear infections.  We had to take them out because some kid with a MRSA infection at his school, licked his finger and stuck in in my sons ear.  So we had to take the tubes out.<br>  He had 4 ear infections in one month this winter and went back to 50% hearing loss, so we put them back in February.<br>  They put him in early in the morning and we were home by 3 PM that afternoon.<br>  It is always scary to sign your child up for surgery, no matter how small.  Trust me, my son has had 8 surgeries in his 3 year life.  But once they come out in a lot less pain and things are fixed, it will be well worth it.<br>  Good luck|`|PrWZCtvIaa	my nephew had them because he constantly had ear infections and they helped dramatically. He is two now and just recently had them removed.|`|hCPPojKYaa	Maybe you could consider eliminating some/all of the dairy products (if any) you are giving him. When I was a baby I cried & screamed ALL the time. When my mom took me to the doctor he said that I had an extremely bad ear infection & that my hearing might be permanently damaged. My mom gave me the what the doctor prescribed, but also took me off dairy products. When I went back to the doctor, he was shocked at how much "healthier" my ears were & I definantly don't have any hearing problems. It might be worth trying no dairy products before getting tubes...it worked for me when I was little.|`|vN4JLBl0aa	my now 2 year old had them done last summer and she hasn't had an issue with her ears since, she kept getting them and no medicine would keep them away. Her being in day care played a huge part in my decision and i didn't want her to lose her hearing. I definitely agreed with the surgery
c61e78b56fe81c5d313b6a174723c1a1aa	In all your considerations, please do RULE OUT a VAGINAL Hysterectomy the supporting  ligaments etc. that 'hold' the uterus in place are stretched  to get the uterus out.  They don't  pop back good as new.!!! The bladder also loses support,  after 2 pregnancies  you don't need more problems.Many women use "Depends" for incontinence and it's not funny !   Also the  'bikini  cut' is small and hidden by a bikini.   DO NOT have your ovaries OUT, even if Doc says it won't cost extra !  Those ovaries are precious and the natural hormones also. Your girls will really love helping mommy picking up things and doing for you - great lessons for them and cooperation with each other.  Dr. has not given you a concrete reason for the bleeding?  If it's fibroids and you don't want more kids, a hysterectomy is great!  A real relief from periods and pads.!!  I would like  to know the reason  for bleeding (Pathology should be inspecting the organ after) and  if  your blood tests reveal  changes (anemia) .I understand about the fear you feel because of your young mom dying.at 46 .!I dreaded 35, then 60. Did I deserve to live longer? After years of chest xrays, the last just before surgery in 2001, I had to have a  SPIRAL CT SCAN, with & without contrast , of my chest just 2 days after.  They found CANCER!   Tiny, tucked  behind shoulder blade.! You will be getting your mammograms  earlier (history) and sonagrams  if there's any doubt. Use these diagnostic tools!    Count , on 2 weeks for sure. to have some help. But more with the lifting if you can. The burden will be LIFTED when you're done and you should feel GOOD.   Best wishes.|`|IDIuG7W1aa	a hysterectomy can be done one of two way, either partial or complete, meaning partial, they only take the uterus and leave the ovaries, so that you will not have to take estrogen, or complete where the entire reproductive tract is removed. <br>  <br>  i havent had one, and at 26, i would rally hate to. but it will help. you could have had PID (pelvic inflamatory disease) a severe case of endometriosis or other uterine infection that caused this. <br>  im suprised that your doc never checked this out before it progressed this far. <br>  removal of the uterus will solve the problem. i just pray that there are no additional problem with the ovaries or fallopian tubes so that you dont haveto do hormone replacement thearpy. <br>  good luck. <br>  ask your doc if he could do a contrast scan of the tract, to make sure this is what needs to be done before they go removing stuff from down there|`|p77IaBoIaa	I would go with the ablation before an abdominal hysterectomy.  It is far less invasive and they have a high success rate.  I don't know anyone who had problems with them and ended up needing hysterectomy.|`|68edad4826bc75b2b9f39ed5a85d8cf5aa	Yes, a hysterectomy helped me so much.<br>  It is a long recovery but so worth it.<br>  If something in your body is making you sick and you don't need it, get rid of it.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|AA11104372	If you are considering a hysterectomy, I would recommend the website www.hystersisters.com.  They have all kinds of information to help you make your decision.  If you do have a hysterectomy, I would recommend a vaginal hysterectomy vs. an abdominal incision.  The recover is much quicker, and much less painful.  You still need to plan on about 6 weeks for a full recovery.  You won't be allowed to lift anything over 10lbs., do housework, grocery shopping, etc.  for those six weeks, but you will be surprised how good you feel within a few days after surgery.  You will probably spend 1-2 nights in the hospital, then you will need to rest when you get home.  It's helpful to have someone (mom, sister, etc.) stay with you for the first week, to help with the kids, cooking, laundry, etc.  Good luck!

Que ambos, adoptado o biologico, son hijos iguales para los padres, me refiero al sentimiento de amor, cari?o y respeto hacia ellos. <br>  Ahora si como tu dices a un hijo adoptado se tiende a ponerle mas atencion que a un hijo propio, tal vez sea porque se lo  va conociendo de a poco y porque seguramente viene cargado con una historia emocional que los padres que lo adoptan desconocen y que deben descubrir de a poco para entenderlo y asi conocerlo mejor y poder entenderse con el. Esta es mi opinion. El hijo propio (biologico) comienza su historia emocional con sus papis, y por decirlo asi: es otra historia diferente que seguramente conlleva otras actitudes de parte de sus progenitores.

Depende de la educación que los padres le brinden. Los hijos que saben que son adoptados, muchas veces son mas conscientes, se dan cuenta de la oportunidad que recibieron de tener un hogar, buscan salir adelante, en sus estudios, y son obedientes. Ahora, el hecho de que el hijo o hija, no tenga la misma sangre de las personas responsables de su cuidado,  es decir, los padres adoptivos, no significa que no sean familia. <br>  <br>  Yo sé de un caso real: Una tia, mujer con hijos propios, ya grandecitos, adoptó hace muchos a?os a una ni?a, y la crió entre los suyos, los cuales, fueron jóvenes normales.

Remember she's going to have nine months to plan for this, and I'm sure she'll get help from friends and/or family.  I had my daughter before we were ready and you make do.  You do what you have to when you're a parent.  If I were your friend I would sit matt down and just tell him.  You never know, he could be thrilled.  Because they've talked about having kids before and it's something they do want chances are he's not going to be as upset as she thinks.  They're married, and in this together, tell her not to feel like she's in this alone, she's got you and she's got him.|`|AA11379643	Why is she sobbing if she is happy about being pregnant?

TaD9OxkLaa	I would sand off as much of the old finish as possible then repaint.|`|95357efc3ba8d7fb66c1e91e89a10e05aa	honestly, its nice to have good used solid furniture especially if its been handed down but when it comes to babies...you should use old or used items. You never know what will make them sick. <br>  <br>  But if you do, yes, sand and strip as much as possible.. I would even go as far as sandblasting to make sure their is no lead paint|`|355232ca109d88be6fb23e594e9e9813aa	Yes, definitely sand and strip it, give the paint a clean surface. The crib company who made my crib obviously didn't strip the crib of its clearcoat before it was painted, as it's been in use for 5 1/2 months and the paint is flaking badly. I have to get it stripped before my brat is able to pull herself up or else she'll be eating paint. Take the time the first time and save yourself the pain of doing it again later :) Good luck!|`|8IFRRxcOaa	I would, just to be safe.<br>  <br>  Google "Lead in paint" too. Baby furniture needs to be Lead free, and if you can't be certain that yours is, strip it all!<br>  <br>  Lead in paint can cause major sickness in bubs.

Al igual que no se debe usar como método anticonceptivo. saludos|`|0594ad41e677ab54c0d016ed1914a5a4aa	nuca se puede estar totalmente en contra,y a nadie le gusta abortar,estas decisiones son muy personales,no se puede juzgar a la ligera.|`|08gJFUJHaa	estoy a favor, pero creo que lo mejor es una buena planificación|`|114d179ef0247e06adfcd54d908df3aeaa	Aunque sea muy larga les contare una historia: <br>  En una clínica nació una bebe sin cerebro, como es de saber el cuerpito solo vivió unas horas. Los padres de la bebe le pusieron Milagritos, y a pesar que sabían de la malformación desde el embarazo aun asi siguieron con la gestación. Cuando la bebe nació, tenían todo listo: colchitas,pa?ales, ropitas y cositas mas para su nena. Cuando ya el cuerpito no pudo más, la mamá lloró desconsoladamente y se despidió de su nena dando gracias por siquiera haberla gozado unas horas. Mi tía es enfermera de dicha clínica y me contó esto con lagrimas en los ojos. Es una historia real, esos padres sabían lo que iba a pasar y aun asi por el tiempo que pudieron, le dieron todo su amor a esa peque?a criatura. <br>  Las personas que son violadas pueden dar en adopción al ni?o que nace si no lo quieren, los ni?os que vienen con malformaciones pueden sentir el calor de sus padres por el tiempito de vida que tienen, EL ABORTO NO ES JUSTIFICADO EN NINGUN CASO, DIOS NO LO ACEPTA!<br>  LAS MUJERES NO ESTAMOS EN LIBERTAD DE DECIDIR YA QUE NO ES NUESTRO CUERPO, ESO ES ASESINATO!|`|1930dd498af4a1024edf4bf8271e5ab5aa	el aborto es algo muy serio  claro que estoy en contra pero si por alguna razon la persona piensa abortar seria por algo que lo justifike ay casos ke las personas son totalmente entendidas para ke recurran a eso|`|19Mpik0Naa	la verdad yo estoy en contra por que nostros no te nemos que disoner de una vida que no es nuestra, en caso de violacion podrian tener a el bebe y darlo en adopcion o las chicas adolcescentes que no pueden mantener a un bebe tambien pueden darlo en adopcion, ya que muchas personas busacan la posibilidad de tener hijos y por una u otra razon son esteriles, podrian encontrara la felicidad con un hijo adopatado, y yo pienso que el aborto no deberia de exixtir, aparte la persona que lo practia se arrepiente toda su vida, o se puede morir, corre muchos rigesos, y despues de el aborto su vida nmo vuelve a ser la misma.|`|2cd783e5002c34c7cb2f34e8b8c4934faa	no soy mujer no puedo opinar,ellas son las unicas que deben decidir que hacen con su cuerpo.|`|75e42a3d8e69e04bf1c1ee5979de33a1aa	Creo que nadie puede estar a favor de quitar la vida, y menos a un bebé. Como madre no estoy de acuerdo. Y no lo digo solo por tener hijos pero creo que a  nadie, ni joven ni viejo se le deben quitar los derechos de elegir.<br>  Pero teniendo en cuenta ciertas circunstancias, hay casos en los que realmente no se justifica el dolor posterior de saber que quizás ese ni?o tenga problemas, o en casos de violación, (uno no está en la mente ni en la circunstancia personal de la otra persona). Ante la posibilidad eterna de resentimiento y sufrimiento u odio, hay casos en que sí es valedero. <br>  Hubo casos en Argentina de chicas con insuficiencia mental violadas y que se pidió el aborto. En ese caso no lo veo mal. Es necesario someter a una persona que no se puede valer por sí misma a semejante consecuencia? y quién piensa en el chico? criado por abuelos que no son ni serán su madre, ni conocerá a su padre, es difícil....<br>  Sí.! no estoy de acuerdo en dilatar esos casos, el tiempo corre y no se puede abortar a los 5 meses. Eso es un horror.<br>  Es un tema para discutir largo y tendido ,  nunca la gente se pondrá de acuerdo, pero si tengo en claro que uno no es nadie para juzgar al otro, las circunstancias son personales y las decisiones también. Es un tema difícil pero no podemos pensar que muchas veces la razón absoluta sobre ciertos temas.|`|d2b212957872dbf0d38578bb39721b50aa	Me parece que cada cual es responsable de su vida y su cuerpo. Pienso que lo que no nace no muere.Yo personalmente no abortaria a no ser que me violaran o mi vida o la del bebe corriese peligro, pero cada cual puede tomar sus propias decisiones. No me parece que alguien que aborte sea un asesino ni mucho menos, ademas no es una decision facil.|`|ff61c1920227571621d0dc27e9dc08f6aa	A mi me parece que tendrian que hacer unicamente abortos a personas violadas, que hallan dejado embarazados.

A través de la historia alrededor del mundo y en muchas religiones las mujeres han utilizado el aborto como parte de su cuidado de salud. <br>  <br>  No todas las mujeres creen que está bien abortar, pero toda mujer tiene el derecho de tomar su propia decisión. <br>  <br>  Otras opciones en caso de embarazo inesperado son: entregar al bebé para que lo adopten o quedarse con el bebé. <br>  <br>  Las mujeres decidimos abortar por muchas razones: <br>  No podemos mantener al bebé en este momento. <br>  Nuestros padres se enojarían y estarían desilusionados, y hasta podrían echarnos de la casa. <br>  Si tenemos este bebé no vamos a poder terminar la secundaria, ni podremos ir a la universidad y nos quedaremos sin una carrera. <br>  El papá del ni?o o de la ni?a no va a ayudar. <br>  Tener esta ni?a no sería saludable ni para nosotras, ni para el bebé. <br>  No tenemos el dinero para cuidar a un bebé. <br>  Nos embarazamos por causa de incesto o violación. <br>  Cualquier razón que tengas por decidir en favor del aborto es una buena razón. éstos son nuestros cuerpos y nuestras vidas.

BUCcd2aBaa	I had one done during my pregnancy because I have a 15 year old half brother who was born with Spina Bifida and Triple screen is suppose to check for that. The Dr. told me it would be a good idea since I had something that big in my family. I suppose if you don't have anyone closely related to you that has one of the problems it screens for then you shouldn't worry. But I would have it done. It's just a precaution, so that if they find something with your baby you have time to prepare. I have never heard of anyone getting a false positive. I guess it could happen, idk. Good Luck. By the way, mine came back fine and my daughter is healthy as can be.|`|2cf01bf819941ed60286c326addce637aa	I didn't have it done. I just want the baby to be here and if something is wrong with her we can figure something out when she's here. I heard too many false positives and I wouldn't want the amnio done! Good luck!|`|KA4dVajlaa	I did not have it done because I heard allot of bad stories.  I thought about it for a while ask your self this if you found out something was wrong what would you do?  I knew that I would continue on with my pregnancy and have my baby no matter what.  So to me the test was point less.  You have to make your own decision.  Good luck!|`|0GWiYjOzaa	Do it. You'd rather knpow if something is wrong now rather than later when it could be to late to fix it.|`|1lsqtix4aa	The screen is just routine blood work. If it comes back positive, it doesn't mean anything other than a flag for a possible risk factor. It's not a 'false positive', It's completely inconclusive. At that point, you can either go for the amnio or not. I had the amnio with both of my pregnancies. If there was a problem, I wanted to know and plan for it, not be suprised in the delivery room, or spend the rest of my pregnancy worrying about it. The amnio was done by a very reputable and experienced doctor. It was intense, but it was fine. My results were negative, and I got on with my pregnancy and my life. Now they have a really cool and non-invasive test for Down Syndrome called NUCHAL TRANSLUCENCY SCREENING, done by ultrasound. Check it out at your local hospital. Amazing. Good luck.|`|31fd8991d3ff0d1cf4d587bc7339f665aa	I had a triple screen done, there's no harm in getting it done, they just draw blood from you and send it off to labs.

I would recommend taken it.|`|9ee460dfe8cb3a9325dc7299b62be23caa	I have been urged to take it,  I have 2 weeks to get it and i think I will, however, it comes up positive i am not getting an amnio, I thin k there are too many risks.

Totally uneventful.|`|QBtpmKEgaa	Almost every pregnant woman in the U.S. has the triple sreen test done. It's almost mandatory.|`|d1d0b17673b1043ce4092a05bb82975daa	I opted not to do it.  The reason was because of what my doctor said.  If there's a false positive it could mean unnecessary stress.  Amniocentesis has about a 1 to 2% miscarriage rate, which even that small is too much for me.  Also, he said he didn't recommend it if it wouldn't change the way we treated the pregnancy.  Nothing will change how we treat this baby so we felt there was no reason to go through with the test.|`|d31bdafb8778094ca310353afa1c2680aa	I had it done with this pregnancy and with my current pregnancy.  It feels good when the test comes back normal.  Less to stress over.  The screen is just that, a screen.  It doesn't guarantee anything, but it is nice to have a heads up.  <br>  <br>   I decided if it came back abnormal, I would much rather have time to look into it and research than have a shock when the baby came.   I've heard of the false positives and decided if mine came back positive, I would opt for a second bloodtest and an ultrasound rather than the amnio.  Too many risks there.  I would continue with the pregnancy also.|`|dyTb2N4Zaa	I opted out from getting it.  1/2 of those choosing to get it have a positive result and need further investigation.  Of those, less than 1/4 really have a complication.  To me, it seemed like a lot of worrying, especially since I had already fallen in love with this tiny person and wasn't going to do any changes to alter pregnancy results!  :)|`|pA4S3atwaa	I just got my results and I have a 1 in 100 chance of having a baby with down syndrome. I haven't decided to have the amniocentesis done yet but for me the results don't really matter because either way I will still love my baby with all my heart. So what you need to decide is if it will change your mind about having a baby.

f5ZdHKvyaa	take the ultrasound to the doctor that you think there has been a mistake because you couldn't have got pregnant at that time. As for the rest of it the best thing to do  is ask your doctors advice.|`|o8OTk6xYaa	I'm guessing June 10th and June 27th refer to your due date?<br>  <br>  If there's a discrepency of 2 weeks or more from an ultrasound reading, then you need to make sure you verify what your LMP was, and how this compares to your measurements, and take the closest date of the 2.<br>  <br>  As far as the compliations you mentioned, this is something for your provider to monitor.  With either due date in June, your baby is pretty much out of danger for lung problems (assuming you've stayed pretty healthy during pregnancy).<br>  <br>  Hope you do well with your new baby!|`|2uSP9JIdaa	If u are in a lot of pain like u say, im sure u could ask them to do sumn to ease the pain..? Good luck n congrats|`|Jj56ALSJaa	Are you saying you got pregnant in Jail? Or that is the day you went in to jail? And why wouldn't you take all your information with you to the Dr's? Of course you should take it. You want them to help you right? Then you need to tell them that you got different results in the  Jail. Sometimes the jail don't always have up to date equipment either. So maybe the ultra sound machine just was not up to standards?? I would not let the baby be  forced to come out. Maybe if you have it induced professionally if your Dr thinks it is deemed necessary.But stripping membranes sounds so terrible to even just say it!! And I am glad you plan to love your baby no matter what....That's what  a good mom would do. Congrats!!! Best Wishes! Good Luck...and God Bless!|`|SErhF1OSaa	Most pregnancies can be off by two weeks either way.

That's like letting a child play with fire and then saying "if it's meant for them to get burned they will".<br>  <br>  You need to be honest with your boyfriend that you want and are trying to have a baby now.  It's evident he DOESN'T want a baby yet cause he's using condoms and pulling out.  <br>  <br>  So why beat around the bush?  You being dishonest with him is no different than if he cheated and was dishonest with you.|`|FxzHpPNsaa	You like to "let things happen???"  What happened to being responsible?

LAZRQ86uaa	Pour ma part, je n'ai jamais envoyé ma fille en mini-schools mais j'y ai travaillé et , à mon sens, c'est l'age ou le cerveau des enfants peut retenir des tas d'informations, à cet age les enfants ont un bien meilleur accent que quand ils apprennent l'anglais plus tard Ce fut un vrai régal pour moi car à cet age là les enfants sont curieux et avides d'apprendre sans s'en rendre compte à l'aide de jeux, chansons et autres Cependant, les enfants doivent être en tout petit groupe et surtout ne pas dépasser 45 min, 30 minutes me semblent plus adéquats de 3 à 7 ans Puis 45 minutes de 8 à 10 mais là aussi tout dépend du nombre d'enfants dans le groupe|`|07ec08013bacb6bf75c238af2ca27e5caa	je connais pas...mais ca a l'air bien|`|AECaWANtaa	Ma fille a 29 ans , et elle a été en mini school .

I'd go and purchase a pregnancy test and see what shows up.  When my morning sickness hit I got a CLEAR positive on my First Response test.  Why not try?  Best of luck to you and wishing you all the best! xxx|`|yMXWrhL4aa	Even though they call it morning sickness, it can come on at any time of the day or night.  It is a little hard to tell after only 1 day, but it possibly could be.  Morning sickness doesn't normally come with a temp, though, so you might check for a fever, in case you are coming down with something.
AA10811784	HaHa! That is cute!<br>  <br>  My daughter used to call cheeseburgers "chicken burgers". Her Mamaw took her to McDonald's once and she told her she wanted a chicken burger. So, she bought her a chicken sandwich. She took one bite of it and got mad and said, "I want a chicken burger!" My mistake, I never told her that's what she called them. LOL<br>  <br>  Oh, and she calls computers "puters". She has been sounding out letters and the other day, when talking about the letter "P" she says, "Puter starts with P" Well... not exactly honey. It actually is pronounced "computer" and starts with a C. She just gave me this weird look.|`|62hGVNhoaa	Clocks were called dogs when my son was little, he could say clock but everytime he saw one he would point and say DOG!|`|BjY1iZS0aa	For the longest time my son called sunglasses "eyes" - I didn't have the heart to ever correct him cause it was just so cute. He would grab them and say "I got my eyes."  For a short time he also called a hat "head". The "eyes" one though lasted until recently. Also when I was teaching him manners and saying 'thank you', when he would say it I would say "you're welcome", and then he would repeat that also. So now when he thanks someone he says "thank you, you're welcome". He's 4 and he still does it, but I don't have the heart to stop it. I love hearing it. |`|1270a2c558de1c5ce444bf6f3447f4beaa	My neice and nephew that are now 12 and 13 used to call my husband "nail" instead of Neal.

My daughter said "Aww...that's their mummy" I think she thought it was the "mommy"<br>  Also my sister name is Angie, and she calls her "Antree" It's Aunt Angie all strung together. And I have no idea why, but she calls Angies husband (whos name is Theron), Homer.

1270a2c558de1c5ce444bf6f3447f4beaa	I got positives for three to four days when I tested.  OPK's test for the hormone surge, and some women can surge longer and test positive longer.  My OBGYN said to consider the first positive as your "o" day.  You will ovulate anywhere from 12-36 hours after getting your first positive. <br>  <br>  Yes, Bd'ing Wednesday and yesterday is good!  The month I conceived dh and I bd'd two days before my first positive, the day before, and the day I got my first positive and that was it.  I was worried, but now I have an eight month old little boy so it was obviously enough!! <br>  <br>  Good luck and baby dust!!!!!!!!!!|`|6CU00J1Yaa	too many acronyms, I can't follow you.|`|KOwzDLPdaa	Your body releases the hormone that means ovulation is just around the corner anywhere from 36-72 hours before ovulation. So its possible to get three days positive if the hormone is still present in you urine.<br>  <br>  Give him a day's rest and have at it one more time tomorrow maybe. Best of luck!
Y8ZmuWwgaa	I love Madeleine too :)<br>  <br>  My favorite spelling is the classic French one; Madeleine. I think it looks the prettiest and most dainty. The pronunciation is Mad-uh-len.<br>  <br>  While I do like Madeline, Madeleine's variant spelling (it reminds me of the book series, which I loved to read when I was younger), it's liable to be pronounced Mad-uh-line, which is actually a mispronunciation. While this pronunciation has in fact become more common and does sound pretty, it's actually an American/British mispronunciation of the proper French one. Most people wouldn't recognize that, though (unless they're French), so it shouldn't be a deterrent to stop you from using the name if you like it, though! I pronounce both spellings as Mad-uh-len, but maybe that's because I speak French.<br>  <br>  Madelene is pretty sounding, but I don't think I'd use it. While it's, as you said, a legitimate variant on Madeleine, it sounds and looks like a typo to me. That my own opinion, because I'm so used to seeing it spelt Madeleine, but it is interesting.<br>  <br>  As for the nickname Maddie, Maddie is my favorite spelling. I had a friend in elementary school named Maddelena (she was Italian), and went by Maddie; that's the only way I've spelled it since.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|24rBuTqOaa	Firstly, love the name Eva.<br>  <br>  Secondly, I think Madeline or Madeleine (pronounced "line") is my favorite. It reminds me of the French cartoon girl Madaline and that's how it was pronounced. And I like foreign names. Madeline (when pronounced "lyn" is more Americanized to me and too popular). I do like Madalene as well, that's a nice take on the name. You should go with "line" or "leen" as a pronunciation.|`|FFbWgs0Xaa	I love Madeleine; it is one of my all time favourite names.  I pronounce it MAD-e-len so liek Madelyn I guess.  <br>  <br>  I also really like Madeline.  I pronounce it MAD-e-line.  I think that if you want it pronounced like Madelyn you need to use Madeleine as everyone will pronounce Madeline with the LINE bit.  <br>  <br>  I don't like Madelene at all, people will probably just assume it is a typo.  <br>  <br>  As for the nickname I definately prefer Maddie to the other spellings.  |`|VSBWOI6gaa	Hello!<br>  I've always loved the name Madeleine too!<br>  Hmm...for spelling, I think go Madeline. See, if you have an extra 'e', people might mispronounce it. I know people who HATE having their names mispronounced, so Madeline is probably your safest bet. However, if you like the "Mad-a-lyn" pronounciation, I suggest Madelyn. xD<br>  <br>  Hmm...but I think I like 1 and 3 best, haha. <br>  <br>  For a nickname, Maddy's the way to go. My friend's little sister Madelyn is called Maddy, and it's adorable!<br>  <br>  Have fun choosing! :)|`|e17025d63b591426b1c43c2197cd3fc8aa	I prefer Madeleine but I say it more as mad-uh-lehn than mad-uh-lyn.<br>  <br>   I would say Madelyn as Mad-uh-lyn and Madeline as mad-uh-line. They are nice but very common. <br>  <br>  I don't care for Maddy. It has been ruined buy Madison and all its various spellings. I prefer it spelled Maddie though. <br>  <br>  If I use Madeleine, I plan on calling her Minnie as a nickname. |`|X3758Sftaa	I pronounce my name Mad-a-lyn, but spell it Madilynn. But my nickname is Maddie.<br>  And my best friends name is spelled Madeline, and pronounced the same as mine. Her nickname is Maddy.<br>  <br>  It drives me mad when people say their name as Mad-a-line.  Hahaha. And I've never heard of Madelene, its very unique!|`|GEoAHj2paa	Madeleine/ Madeline- I like the name but I would prefer it to be spelt Madelyn. <br>  <br>  Madeline- It always reminds me of Madeline from the books and TV shows. <br>  <br>  Madelene- Can't say I like it too much.<br>  <br>  I like it spelt Madi.<br>  <br>  Good Luck! :)|`|dlHg3r1Vaa	madalin, madilynn, madilin, madelynn, madilen, madulin, maduhlynn, madulinne,  madaulen, madaulin.

I've never heard herd that before. Though I think it should be spelled Madalynn, for simple pronunciation purposes.<br>  <br>  I like the nickname spelled Maddie the best.<br>  <br>  :)|`|lk7iaxqkaa	I like:<br>  Madeleine pro. mad-a-lyn<br>  Madeline pro. mad-a-line<br>  Madelene pro. mad-a-leen (and spelt Madaleen)<br>  <br>  I like the nickname Maddie!|`|KCvsgcqqaa	I like the 2nd one.

Madeleine - pronounced Mad-a-lyn<br>  <br>  I like the pronounciation, but hate the spelling with it. It looks like Mad-uh-LINE to me. Madalyn is cute though.<br>  <br>  <br>  2. Madeline - pronounced Mad-a-lyn<br>  <br>  Again, same as above.<br>  <br>  <br>  3. Madeline again - pronounced Mad-a-line<br>  <br>  Yes, I like it. The pronounciation and spelling work together.<br>  <br>  <br>  4. Madelene - pronounced Mad-a-leen. <br>  <br>  Interesting. I don't know if I've ever heard that before. It's not bad.<br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck! =)<br>  <br>  EDIT: I prefer the spelling Maddie. I think it's the only one that looks right.|`|57xobgj2aa	Madeline is very cute because you can always let her collect the Madeline dolls and books. You should call her Maddie for short, tats a really cute name. Or Maggie. I have never met a Maggie who didn't have a personality!|`|dwOLnFnlaa	I'm the same way, I pronounce Madeline and Madeleine the same way :)<br>  <br>  I personally like it spelled Madeline, pronounced Mad-a-lyn, but I like Mad-a-line too, either way. Not too fond of Madelene.|`|rabjcdjHaa	I like Madeleine and Madeline, because I like the name pronounced Mad-a-lyn. I think it sounds pretty pronounced that way. I also like the nickname spelled Maddie. I think it looks cute spelled this way.|`|cvPjlv0Paa	I personally like Madaleen best, but thats just me|`|GAj9hwWvaa	I like 3 and 4 the best, they are a unique twist on a classic name. I think I like Madalene the best!|`|z6BtwSE8aa	I like Madeline, pronounced mad-uh-lyn. I actually like the spelling Madelyn better. Maddie is an adorable nickname.
U1h6Dntjaa	I like the name Celeste, but my husband said 'no way' to it immediately.  Come to think of it, he knocked down all of my slightly interesting choices when we were pregnant.  We already have a girl name picked out for the next time we have a baby, but I can see that the boy name is going to be difficult.|`|bIaywrBCaa	I wanted to name my daughter Tina Michelle. I had always loved the name. My husband hated it, so we named her his choice of Barbara Jane. I later named one of my chihuahuas Tina Michelle because I love the name so much.|`|mRQxlNH5aa	I love Felicity but he says it makes him think of a cat (Felicity--Feline). It's a bummer because I love that name and it's not so common.|`|IuzaNq2Uaa	I love the name Oliver - my husband thinks it's effeminate and too much like "Oliver Twist" and olives. <br>  <br>  My husband loves the name George - it reminds me of the lumpish Hanoverians, and the former President.<br>  <br>  With girls there isn't any real loving or hating, but I like the name Harriet and he thinks it's ugly, and his favorite girl name is Emma, and I find it boring.|`|CxRJwJsraa	hmm. Well, I love Thaddeus, but my husband refuses to consider it (but not because he hates it, but because we know a Thad).<br>  I like his faves (Gabriel, Alexander, and Michael), I just find them a tad boring.|`|LPEWAoWCaa	I love Xavier but he hates it|`|Y3DR1EBUaa	my husband is hispanic & he loves american names bc he dont hear them alot in his country i love hispanic names bc i dont hear them so much hear<br>  <br>  he likes catelin i dont<br>  i like jazmin he dont<br>  both we both like alexis (yes i give in but it has to have a middle name hispanic)<br>  <br>  our sons name is isaiah rafael<br>  i like izrael he hates it<br>  he likes brandon & i am sick of hearing it|`|NOjcTeT4aa	My husband and i agreed that i can name our children anything i see fit as long as we can have the number of children he wants.<br>  <br>   So, that is either 4/5 children.

I look pregnant but feel fine.  If you are worried I would call the Dr to make sure.|`|dNlCfhD2aa	I am so glad you asked this!  I am 16 weeks 5 days, and just like you I have hardly had any symptoms.  I don't really have any advice, but I wanted to let you know that you are not the only one that feels this way.  I'm sure our babies are fine, it is just frustrating to not feel any movement yet.|`|ECPdAeHQaa	You are probably just fine! My next appt isn't until March 9th and I sometimes feel the way you do but if I keep thinking about it I would have an appt everyday to make sure everything is fine. You only have a couple weeks but if you can't stop stressing yourself go in and make sure everything is okay but really try and relax! :)|`|QQUZRXa3aa	everyones pregnancy is differant! i had really bad morning sickness for the first 3 months...and then it just suddenly went away. im 20 weeks and im feeling a WHOLE lot better! some days youll feel like crap and others youll feel great. dont worry about not feeling any movement at 17 weeks, youll usually start feeling movement roughly between 18-22 weeks. im 20 weeks and i feel light movement. and ive heard some say they didnt feel movement as late as 22 weeks. its normal to worry alot, i do it to but as long as theres a heart beat and your checkups with the doctor are good and youre eating good, the baby should be just fine!! As far as sexual intercourse, its totally normal, youre not hurting the baby, sex actually helps. because of hormonal changes there will be days where sex is uncomfortable or doesnt appeal to you! good luck and dont worry to much!
jrVlzffeaa	I just read your last question and was completely disgusted and shocked at how many people left nasty comments!! These people have clearly no idea what you're going through and they can't empathise!! I wish you the best of luck, and for the people who say that you shouldn't be trying until you get married: what Century were you born in? you don't have to be married to raise a family, and in case you didn't get it they're engaged which means they intend to marry at some point so BACK OFF. Hope you're wish and dreams come true Xx|`|9f3784bdf3bdc20b62d4d53dedacfdfeaa	yes, I actually posted a question to determine the actual age of people on here and found that many were children (18 and under) and 80% were under the age of 23 -- which to me says that lack of life experiance leads to many questions receiving stupid answers by stupid people.  I am 29, married and also TTC and have also found the same -- then again how many 'am i pregnant' questions do we also find on here?  I have also found this on the Politics section of here as well.  Do know that you have some people on here that are intelligent and going through the same thing you are, so you just may have to weed out those answers.  good luck :)|`|MgVbgbT0aa	This is an open forum and just the public itself there are bnice people and there are nasty people.

I'm sorry you had to go through that, and my heart goes out to you with your TTC journey.<br>  <br>  When I first found this site I had just started TTC, and didn't know too much about it all. I asked if saliva kills sperm, and I got one or two horrible stupid smart *** answers. I just thought, what in the world makes you so miserable? Do you need a shoulder to cry on? Do you feel better about yourself now? There's a lot of ugly people in this world. However, the majority of us here are very nice and have the desire fo a baby in common. I've found so many supportive women here, and I was just telling someone yesterday how funny it is that this brings perfect strangers so close, and how we understand each other sometimes more than the people in our everyday lives do. I have made some buddies on here, and keep in touch with some great women. I know how you feel. It takes a woman with a lot of strength to take the TTC journey, and I tell everyone here that we are very admirable women. Chin up and stay positive, and don't let those unhappy fools bug ya. If you ever need anything, someone to listen or talk with, don't be afraid to ask. Good luck to you and all the baby dust in the world for you!! :)|`|paKkFWXSaa	Hey Lola!<br>  <br>  I read your last question and I must say I have NEVER seen so many rude and uncalled for comments. Dont stress about it just take the ones that answer for real and dont feed into those haters. You know you are better than all that. I really do wish you and your fiance' much luck on your TTC journey. I hope it works out for you soon. I was actually thinking this might have been your months since you got engaged and all. I thought that your mind might have focused on that and that would help you. Maybe it still might. I have experienced problem with answers. I am on here all the time answering peoples questions thoroughly and seriously and it seems whenever I ask questions I rarely get lots of good answers. It seems that people are more concerned with getting on answers and either writing negative crap or only answering the silly "Im 15 and touched my BF penis can I be pregnant" questions. I really do wish that answers would be what it is supposed to be for those out there who really do respect it and use it for what it is meant for. Good Luck and Baby Dust Lola!|`|Gcdt9U3Aaa	I've been lucky not to receive those kind of answers myself but i have read a lot of them. Sadly there are some people that get a kick out of being smart arses, some people like to write those kind of answers because they think it's funny to wind people up or to deliberately upset you, others will write stuff because they know it will cause a stir. There are numerous members that will randomly ask stupid questions they know will cause offence, they obviously have nothing better to do with their time(at least polite members are trying to be helpful)<br>  <br>   At least there are some people that will give honest polite answers and they're worth sticking around for. Ignore the idiots.|`|lAWS0pZiaa	I haven't asked any questions myself so I haven't had any bad answers, but I have seen some completely stupid answers to some other peoples questions and on other kinds of websites.<br>  <br>  There are some jerks in the world, but thats why theres a "thumbs down" button :)|`|XysYiksbaa	Yes i have had some nasty comments b4 there is clearly no need for this but some people dont have a life and have nothing better to do just ignore all the rude comments and people like myself are there 2 give them the thumbs down<br>  <br>  best of luck and baby dust xx|`|b3206817713592651117c3452f9e3f1faa	Ignore them. There are some nice people on here too, who totally get what you are saying about TTC so don't worry! :o)|`|8EOBWGXDaa	My God! I've just read your previous question and all the answers...went down thinking well these aren't bad. There was that one having a go at you because you weren't married - what's that got to do with it?? But all OK.<br>  Then scrolled down to the end and there were tons of digusting rude and offensive answers!!<br>  I can't believe people would write things like that when you're obviously frustrated, losing hope and upset.<br>  Gah some people are jus pathetic. And why would not capitalising you're I's have anything to do with it?<br>  <br>  Good luck in TTC hun, I hope it works out for you and you managed to relax and conceive. I can slightly (not trying to conceive myself but want one badly - only 21) understand and hope it all comes to you. <br>  |`|EcK7GhY8aa	I haven't read your replies, but I can imagine. Another poster said that a lot of replies are from very immature people and this is part of it, they simply are so young and self-involved that they do not see that their reply is being read by a vulnerable human, they just think they are being clever. I do hope for humanity's sake they improve as they grow up. <br>  <br>  The other reason is that people can be very very cowardly on the internet, they are not face to face with someone and don't have to deal with the response. So out comes all the crap they would never dare or dream of spilling in public. We are talking about people holding in a lot of bad feelings and anger that is nothing to do with you, and they are venting it on the internet because they are too cowardly to speak out in real life.<br>  <br>  I have seen it all over, extremely cruel and nasty (and completely unwarranted) attacks on people. I find that it is much, much less likely if you join a group that vets its members, for example Yahoo has many ttc email groups where everyone posting is in the same position and swapping support and information.<br>  <br>  Hunny, you don't deserve this at all, remember this bile is really aimed at someone else and nothing to do with you. <br>  <br>  If it's any help, I have experience of struggling with ttc too and the thing I wish I could get to every woman free of charge is acupuncture.  This has worked like magic for me (obviously my husband still has to play his part, LOL). I go to a Chinese dr near to me. I am currently pregnant with my second.<br>  <br>  Roxy|`|xxXQaXMVaa	If your fiance is going to leave you its not going to be just because you might have trouble conceiving. It takes time not all people are lucky enough to get pregnant in the 1st year it can take longer all due to everyday stress and other things it all just depends on whats going on at that time. As for the person above a you can still have a baby with a fiance even if you ar not married i have been with mine fiance for over 6 years and the only reason we are not married is caues i have not set the date and would rather wait till i know the time is right. I know that the is the fredom of speach but do please join the 21st centary not every one wants to wait and thats there chioce get all the facts before you judge a person for all you know this lady may have been with her hunny for a very long time.<br>  <br>  As for people being nasty in the ttc section there will all ways be people out there that just have not had the better luck with ttc and take it out on everyone else. I have just learned to ignore them they are not worth the time.<br>  <br>  You can find support it just takes a little bit of weeding out the baddy. Witch can be hard at times. People can be retarded so just ignor all those stop drinking answers it's just kids be stupid and trying to get pionts.<br>  <br>  The rude and horible answers will always be there you can never change that you just learn to move past them.<br>  <br>  As for you ttc i wish you the best of luck and lots of sticky baby dust your way. All that Dust worked for me i am 40 weeks and 2 days and ingaged to be married to the love of my life and ready for my little man to come into this world. Best of luck to you and God bless|`|e20e778807f334f6575085b3abdf95fcaa	Just ignore the idiocricy and move on. You'll find them in all the sections.

She will sit & spin the little animals for hours at a time!! <br>  <br>  And at night she won't go to sleep unless she has her little blankie with the taggies on it.. She loves the bright colors & the sound of the crinklies for some reason!!|`|yUyx2nhmaa	My son loves a little squeaky lamb which was only 50p in the sale! he is 10 months. he crack up whenever I squeak it as it pops up to see him. Hilarious. he also n he loves his walker and a drum which makes a noise and lights up when he bangs it.
WPI0Z47saa	I breastfed for 18 months and my son went through spurts like this. He may not be having a growth spurt or may not feel well. There are so many reasons why they can get disinterested sometimes. It is important to make it available to him and if he doesn't want to eat then you need to pump it so that you don't decrease your milk supply for when he is ready again. It will pass but you sometimes have to let it happen on their terms. You don't eat when you are not hungry right? As long as he doesn't start losing weight then this is perfectly fine. Good luck.

If not, you probably have nothing to worry about, if you're worried about pregnancy.  Though STD's are still something you should be concerned about.
H5F1NSf7aa	nO TE recomiendo el DIU, es incómodo, doloroso, e inseguro, mejor investiga donde ponen los implantes gratuitos, el implante dura 5 a?os y no te lo tienes que checar jamás, no causa dolor durante la menstruación y es a mi parecer mejor.<br>  No se donde lo pongan, en puebla es en el hospital de la mujer, pero pregunta en alguno de salubridad.

Also extreme emotions can raise your heart rate. If your resting heart rate seems to fast. Get a second opinion.|`|a1x0xqARaa	Yeah, I think it's just cuz you have a baby in there to pump extra blood to.  And the sack, and everything else.  Doc says it's all good, I'd go with what the Doc says.  I'm sure your heart rate will go back to normal once you have the baby.  Plus, now in your third trimester, your lungs are more restricted.  Your heart may be trying to make up for that somehow.|`|ca9dEvSAaa	Well I have that and sometimes it's painful. I have a heart condition so I'm not sure for healthy heart people, but I do think it may be normal during pregnancy.<br>  <br>  Remember, pregnancy strains your body.

40Q4gpi6aa	It could be because you are getting so close to having the baby, and the baby is situating itself inside of your uterus that it gives you pain.|`|67QVKHQ3aa	maybe the baby is on your ciatic nerve, ive heard that can be very painful, just talk to your doctor and see what he/she says...dont wait till your next appointment. just call!|`|b978f631fc787a963337206aa3833370aa	I doubt it's because of size, but because it's sitting on everything - your pelvis, your bladder, your sciatic nerve, etc. My pelvis feels like I've been riding a horse for the last couple weeks, and it's horrible. <br>  <br>  I doubt they will induce because you're uncomfortable; unfortunately that's the breaks of being pregnant. Inducing before the baby is ready, unless there's a medical condition, is not always safe, and doesn't mean it will work, either. Hang in there and try to get comfortable - load up on pillows, do leg stretching, etc. Take a hot bath. It'll all be over soon!|`|8zdPI8Qsaa	It's common for the baby's movement to be painful as your pregnancy is near it's end. I remember crying a lot when my son moved around in the last week or two of my pregnancy. He'd get into such a painful position and then just stay there forever. He was a pretty little guy though (6lbs14oz), so I'm not sure if it really has to do with their size. <br>  I never got a sweep so I'm not too familiar with it... but since you're so close I'd definitely mention your concerns to the dr when you go for your next appointment and see what they want to do. <br>  The discomfort is normal though, congrats on being near the end!! Hope your last days go well :-)|`|S8x3eHQhaa	What is a sweep? Just curious I've never heard of it. <br>  Anyway when I get to 39 weeks I plan to do exercises to get the baby moving and wanting to come out that's what I did for my first. Nothing drastic just little things like taking the stairs, doing little squats or getiing on all fours and sway your hips this gets the baby moving and within a day or two you should go into labor. Good Luck|`|CwUvYu66aa	it could be that he is ready to come out! and that your body is not ready for him to come out. he is probably bigger then your uterus can handle. good luck. your almost there. maybe if everything is ok you can deliver the baby sooner then your expected due date. good luck with everything! hope mommy and baby does well. =)|`|uuHPneEcaa	well it could be because u are very close to having him. and he so big that its going to be painful. I am sure ur okay. u can ask ur doctor for a sweep. <br>  <br>  I will probably be like that when I am about to have my son also

The huggies wipes are great for getting stubborn poo off, but the pampers are a little more gentle.<br>  <br>  Also, a bit of unsolicited advice.  J&J makes a great no talc "medicated" powder that has the active ingredient from desitin in it (zinc oxide).  I have been using this since my son was six months old.  Only then because he only had breast milk before that and if you change them often and use good diapers, they never get diaper rash!|`|4yGGjs7zaa	pampers for both! i found with huggies nappies they left white bits from the nappie on my babnies bottoms and around that area which i found hard to remove as it just moved around! also i found that pampers holds more during the night!<br>  as with wipes i found that huggies ones tended to rip in half when getting them out of the packet and the pampers just stretched which i didnt find as a problem!|`|2GhwuXksaa	Hi!<br>  <br>  Pampers are ok but I prefer Huggies personally. I found that Huggies protected my daughter better against leaks than Pampers did. As for wipes, my daughter has very sensitive skin but I found the Tescos own brand sensitive range is brilliant.

ZNhP3mpUaa	many women "spot" through their entire pregnancy... as long as severe cramping doens't accompany it, you're dr will probably say it's ok. Constipation is also normal. Add more fiber to your diet. <br>  <br>  constantly peeing is probably from the increased liquid in your diet. your uterus isn't big enough yet to be putting THAT much pressure on your blader. Drink lots of water.<br>  <br>  she's right DON'T let her scare you. my wife has spotted through much of her pregnancy. Dr. said in many women it's completely normal. it's also said the same thing in ALL the pregnancy books i've read.|`|6r6s5AfXaa	If your spotting, you need to see the doctor immediatly because you might be having a miscarriage.|`|8aqveZrWaa	I don't want to scare you, but i'm a mother of 5 and i never experienced any kind of spotting like blood, but when a woman has an infection she could spot some kind of fluids, you need to go to your doctor and get checked out, and about the bowel movements, that is normal in some women your body changes alot when pregnant, and urinating yes that is normal, we pee alot when pregnant!!! you will get tired of peeing so much, but there is nothing you can do about it, it goes with being preg. Good Luck
pLO3k76Maa	Personally it's ugly, I wouldn't name my kids that or animal. It sounds like Tom Cruise's daughters name YUCK! There are far more beautiful names out there to pick from.|`|zbyDZIRgaa	I went to school with a girl named Yuri. @ first we thought it was strange, seeing that we were in 2nd grade and she was a new girl. But we forgot about it and all became good friends. I believe it is a Russian name, and it seems unisex. I feel its a cool name, just be prepared for ignorant jerks to add their two cents.|`|2X8rJ4c5aa	Yuri is a Russian boys name, so be prepared for a lifetime of boy/girl confusion if its for a girl.<br>  <br>  If its a boy, stick to the common equivalent for the country you are in, if thats the US or England then that would be George.|`|RyjMNUKcaa	I think it is nice if it is part of your heritage.  It isn't a name I would choose but it isn't my heritage. What is the English translation?|`|AA10412414	Very Russian.  It's not bad, I think it would grow on me if I knew someone named Yuri.  I think if he has Russian heritage and/or a Russian last name, it would work okay.|`|hparYLb1aa	it reminds me of the pink panther!  but on a scale of one to ten i would give it a 6.5- i think it grows on you :)|`|DC4Civrvaa	I think it's a cute name, for a girl though.  Please don't name your kid Yuri if it's a boy.  Good luck!|`|nARGjs7Iaa	i love it for a girl name!|`|doLyOac0aa	Yuri? Yuk!  lmao|`|5sYzlAjPaa	I think it was a character name in No Way Out. it sounds kind of mysterious.<br>  |`|LSkeAPBIaa	i know a guy with that name. he gets called yuri-nation. urination.  i personally like it though |`|OHfZFR31aa	Fine if you are in Russia. But unfortunatley in English speaking countries the child will be called "Urine"|`|mGubEYTRaa	I think Yuri-n idiot if you name your kid that.|`|ablhNL0Maa	I don't care for it, sorry.
TK0HKu0Iaa	I'm still in TWW...the extended edition : / At CD31 and a few days late. But the overall latest AF could possibly come is btw the next 2 days.<br>  <br>  I'm going crazy b/c I've had a few symptoms past 2ww incl a really severe headache right after suspected OV day(s), 2 "isolated" incidents of vomiting, breast tenderness since mid last week, but the latest annoyance of the past 3-4 days is this AF type cramping that makes me feel like she's gonna drop any min but she doesnt...and as quick as it comes is as quick as it goes away (awful trick). Usually by the time I feel this kinda cramping I'm in full flow lol. I know I should've tested by now but I have a big phobia of BFN's. I really want to test but I'm scared.<br>  <br>  ~Baby Dust To All *~*~~*~*~*~*~~*~*~*~~*~|`|RE6GBw0Baa	heya ladies, <br>  <br>  im on the other wait....the 3weeks before fertile period ( i have a longer cycle) i hate this bit as you know you can t do anything, although i do have a dr appointment this week which im kinda excited about as i can finally see if there are any probs xxxx<br>  <br>  i wish every1 a BFP and i hope its good news for every1 ttc in october :) xxxx|`|zKDHetmEaa	Hey there,<br>  <br>  I think I am a 2ww....I am not sure if I ovulated this month - but am on 50mg of clomid and just got a blood test this morning - day 22! but I will find out in about 1weeks time if I have ovulated this month...been doing tons of BDing!!! <br>  <br>  So I guess I will do a pregnancy test in about 2 weeks time! Does this make me a 2ww-er?!?! <br>  <br>  I hope you get your BFP this month Honey, and tons of baby dust to you!!! xxxxxxx|`|s56Hv7BSaa	im 14 dpo and i plan on testing tomorrow morning! ^_^ im so excited i think i may be. my boobs have been soo sore i cant even hug people anymore and my nipples are a little darker than usual and have bumps, i have  been cramping all the time and i just started getting nauseous but its only in the morning and early afternoon. i also had some clearish discharge so i hope that's a sign too. im so excited i wish lots of baby dust to you!|`|TAufQoc7aa	hey there I dont know what TWW is? But I am the same trying to sit on my hands to stop me testing, i did a test yesterday and it was inconclusive so i wont do one now til wednesday but its so hard!!! ;-)|`|c97b62c8660b1041d9759f33d466797faa	i am and afraid to get another BFN...<br>  <br>  I hope this is my month...<br>  <br>  Good luck to all of us|`|XlxZIhs7aa	Hi im on my 2 week wait also.. its driving me mad i think i have become obsessed or something!! i cant believe how long these two weeks have been (when i am off to dentist -something i hate- the two weeks fly by then)!!<br>  I am due on some point this week between today and thursday so i guess these 3 days will be longest 3 days ever to me. I tried a test last week cos i couldn't wait any longer but it came up negative :-( i know it was too early but still felt really gutted and wish i hadn't.<br>  Good luck and baby dust to everyone<br>  x|`|mkveZfqOaa	I am also on the TWW, its frustrating, but I seem to be handling it better this month than last.  This is our second month trying.  I just got my IUD out Aug. 7 it then took 6 weeks for AF but I'm hoping my cycle is all back to normal and we'll be pregnant this month.  We are working on baby #3.  I have two girls 3 and 18 months and they keep me busy, its nice.  I took a few OPK's never got a postive, took 5 and started earlier than I should have I think.  I'm pretty sure I still ovulated but of course am paranoid that I didn't.  I had all the right CM, so we'll see in two weeks.  argh!  I just keep telling myself that I got pregnant instantly with my girls and to just chill, but that is of course easier said than done.  But I'm paranoid that the IUD (Mirena) messed me up, even though I have no signs that it did, I guess we'll find out. **baby dust to all**|`|vfEnxToSaa	I'm in the TWW too! Well a bit past it now. AF was due on the 1st-ish. She hasn't graced her presence yet. I tested on the first but got a big fat negative, so I'm waiting until Wed. to test again. Too many times I wasted a ton of money on tests only to have her arrive. But no symptoms of her yet. It's driving me crazy too! Hang in there! I hope we all get our BFP's this month! <br>  <br>  Baby dust!|`|WfJ5ad0oaa	It's crazy...here you are, trying your hardest to get <br>  pregnant..and then on Yahoo answers, you see 13 year olds <br>  posting  questions about how they became pregnant, whether they <br>  should or should not have the baby, and how they're so scared <br>  because their parents are going to find out and the kicker <br>  is...they weren't even trying to get pregnant in the first <br>  place! <br>  <br>  It's almost a joke, really. <br>  <br>  Just as a little story, My husband and I tried to conceive for <br>  a while year. Last year around Thanksgiving time, it finally <br>  happened. I think it wasn't happening for a whole year because <br>  I was stressing so much over it. I kept thinking about the <br>  baby. I kept counting days, researching my ovulation charts, <br>  reading about all kinds of crazy methods to conceive a child. I <br>  had baby on the brain. Finally in November last year, I gave <br>  up. I had a move to think about. I had to pack things, clothes, <br>  furniture...had to get an apartment, start paying new bills <br>  with my husband, make a road trip to our new state..things were <br>  hectic and I forgot about baby-making, and somewhere around <br>  that time, it happened. I think when you are anticipating a <br>  child, your body isn't going to respond only because of how the <br>  stress hormones are high even though you don't know it. And <br>  this can even put your cycle off. It sucks, really. I have some <br>  really helpful sites for you though..you should check them out:<br>  <br>  *Find out when you are ovulating:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.associatedcontent.com/article/227230/trying_to_conceive_find_out_when_youre.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.associatedcontent.com/article...</a><br>  <br>  *Side effects of personal lubricants when TTC:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.associatedcontent.com/article/227220/trying_to_conceive_side_effects_of.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.associatedcontent.com/article...</a><br>  <br>  *Tips for Conceiving:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.associatedcontent.com/article/162109/trying_to_conceive_when_you_want_a.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.associatedcontent.com/article...</a><br>  <br>  *Increasing chances of getting pregnant:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.associatedcontent.com/article/227218/tricks_for_trying_to_conceive_how_to.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.associatedcontent.com/article...</a><br>  <br>  Good luck..I know it's so frustrating...but it will happen. <br>  Like I said, we tried for a year..now I am a mom to a beautiful <br>  baby who was born in August 2008.<br>  |`|VMASMHX6aa	I'm playing the waiting game too! Currently only 3dpo so ages until I will know.<br>  <br>  I had a m/c in July and only just ovulated for the first time since then, so it's been a very long wait for me to get to this point.

CFRh859zaa	Having had to work a job that I hated, I know what its like.  I ended up getting pregnant while at that job (unplanned) and then never returned.   Now that I am a mom though, i can assure you that ability to care for your baby and be financial secure is a huge burden.  I say, start trying RIGHT NOW!!  do whatever you can to get pregnant now, enjoy the benefits of what this job you do not like will give you.  After the baby is born, your priorities will change.  The flex thing might end up being perfect.  Or you may find that you dont want to work at all.  Either way, after the baby, you can still always look for a different job.  Given the economy out there right now, though, I wouldn't want to be the new person at a job and then have a little baby - if they make any cuts you may end up out of a job not because of the baby, but because you are the newbie.<br>  <br>  As an FYI - my "i hate it job" turned out to be great too - those flexible things like extending my maternity leave and covering my insurance while out were REALLY appreciated!!  Good luck!|`|iLDDoTkXaa	the law has changed in the uk so that it doesn't matter how long you have been at a job you are entitled to maternity pay and leave so it doesn't matter when you go. start looking now for a new job all employers have to give a option for working mums when they come back so nowhere is different, i think you answered your own question  your not happy!   and if you really want a baby your options are changing jobs while pregnant or changing jobs with a baby, part time jobs for working mothers are like gold dust so move now get into a good full time job and then go back part time after the baby comes, yes of course its scary telling your boss your not going to work for them but you still want to be payed, but we all have to do it! healthy couples take up to 2 years to get pregnant so dont panic, pregnancy is  long, slow and boring so you need a good job to keep your mind off it good luck|`|UtOVEzG3aa	with all respect I think what you are thinking is wrong, don't ever rush and think about things not happeing yet, first of all, do it step by step, you not happy in your job and as long as you not then that might delay your pregency you need to be relax, if i was you i first will change my job, put your pregnency a side don't think about the cost and your employee, etc.. then when you feel good about your job it will make things easy for you good luck with trying i wish you best of luck! and baby dust|`|F1Gw6qO6aa	I would stick with the job I have currently. Getting a new job and than going on maternity leave might not be the best thing, but really what are you going to do? Regardless of what you're going to do - oyu're going to need time off.<br>  <br>  If you have been at your current job for awhile and feel your job is secure I'd stick with it, especially if you think they are going to be flexible when you return.<br>  <br>  Good Luck.|`|Ylrc1hkXaa	It would be better to stick with your old job and ask for flexi time and a change of duties if you're not happy<br>  <br>  There is a reason you're not happy about the alternative - you would be screwing them over |`|osDB2fSRaa	Im kind of in the same boat because we are ttc but want to move out of state. I know that I couldnt move to a new state with a new job and then have to leave in a few months because of the baby. I think you and your husband should talk a little more about your options, maybe if you can be a stay at home mom for the next year and then start working again after the baby is born, or look for the new job now and wait a few month before conceiving. Even if you werent trying and you switched jobs you have a chance to get pregnant anyways. Just discuss the options of what you both can afford and go from there. Good Luck!!|`|b3206817713592651117c3452f9e3f1faa	I'm in EXACTLY the same situation!! It's crap isn't it? I'm not sure how much longer I can stick with my current job, but I know that it would be the safest thing to do while TTC (same reasons as yourself!!) <br>  PM me if you want to chat (or just have a bit of a moan!) :o)|`|tKDflZNMaa	I went through this last year.  I had a crappy job with excellent benefits and was actively ttc.  I was honest at my interview of the new job of us trying and I wanted to work from home after my baby was born and they said they would work with me and all will work out fine without any problems. After I quit my job and started the new one I came up pregnant not even a month later. When I came back from maternity leave everything changed.  I had to fight to work from home and only got 2 days a week, I forfeited my health benefits, cut back to part-time and still had to go into the office 2 days a week which is over an hour away from home, I have no family here to help with daycare nor the money to pay for it and after 6 months working my new schedule they let everyone go who was working from home if they could not go into the office full time so now I am with no job collecting unemployment.  They promised me this position and then changed it.  All of my supervisers told me they were very pleased with my work but their "policy" was no one was to work from home anymore.  Point is, I didn't put off ttc b/c I was going through fertility tx: (IUI and IVF) and to me that came first before any job and my hubby and I are not young enough to where we would have time to wait to conceive later.  You and your husband should really sit and talk about what you want and to need to happen and back up plans if plans end up having to change.  Due to my job not fulfilling their end of the deal we now have to sell our dream house.  Don't get me wrong, my son is worth it but had we have known this was going to happen we would have never bought this house.  I only took this job b/c they told me I could work from home full time after my son was born.  Whatever you decide just make whatever preparations needed for any changes that could occur and don't let anyone tell you what you are doing is wrong.  No one can tell you what you are feeling or going through and why your reasons are what they are.  As long as you and your husband plan the best that you can no matter how rough it gets it will work out.  No job is ever worth stressing over.  Your family is guaranteed to always be there.  No job can do that.  Find what is going to make you happy and don't put your dreams of starting a family off just b/c of a job.
3a72ae0c30ef90de390ceb62b46fb44aaa	Yes...who in the entire planet hasn't??  In fact, I'm so tired of hearing about this welfare scrub of a mom.  She shouldn't be allowed to keep her kids.  She can't afford or care for them all by herself in the first place.  She can't even work.  I feel very saddened for those children and what they will have to endure.|`|a88c35ef9c55d87377ccb9c18365cc44aa	Yes. It came out like 2 weeks ago that she had 6 kids already, all conceived from in vitro, her moms house is going into foreclosure, she gets food stamps and aid for 2 of her older children, yadda yadda yadda.|`|jfEOIeSIaa	yep.|`|8yTP3jO8aa	I joke about crazy cat ladies, but come on!  If she has hoarding issues and feels like she needs tons of kids to make herself feel worth while as a person, why can't she channel that to cats instead?<br>  <br>  Edit:  I'm so astounded at the fact that she hasn't been working because her back was injured, yet  she decided to become pregnant with 8 babies... what the?|`|oDGpmkMaaa	I think everyone and there mothers have heard of this. it was on Dr Phil yesterday|`|EMKuBql8aa	I think everyone has.....|`|yUyx2nhmaa	err, where have you been????|`|vimB7Rhqaa	Yes, in fact if you type in "octuplet's mom" in the "search for questions" space, you'll find a treasure chest of dialogues on her...|`|0pAczRv2aa	yeah<br>  and how we have to pay for her dumbass <br>  and she planned it i think shes very air-a-gent women<br>   hah|`|zg7myZiBaa	Um.. and the question is? <br>  Yes, i've heard of Nadya Suleman.|`|AA10548610	Yes I've heard and that is quite a herd isn't it?|`|4iXL4C6paa	*sigh* who hasn't|`|YCJz2DiWaa	yes|`|Hx2a3xGoaa	not be to be rude but, who hasn't heard of octo-mom?|`|WnWO1iHSaa	Has anyone NOT heard of her?!?!
8WRnqs08aa	Sounds like you are doing a fine job in trying to prepare yourselves for the birth of your baby.<br>  <br>  I was 20 when I had my first baby and I was scared as hell. I read, read, read and took lamaze. The parenting classes you are taking are a tremendous plus!!<br>  <br>  The more educated you are about what to expect, the more relaxed you will be by the time baby arrives.<br>  <br>  I had to do it all by myself. You are fortunate to have the babys father with you to help. Babies do not come with manuals, but somehow we mom's tend to figure out what each of our baby's little cries means. The first couple of weeks will be the most difficult because you will be tired, feeling overwhelmed and trying to learn what your baby wants.<br>  <br>  Have faith in yourself and it will all come to you! Best of Luck to you & your BF.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Mother of 4 beautiful children with Twins due 09/10/09|`|AlnItc6Gaa	I think every first time mom feels that way, no matter what the age. My advice to you is don't aim for perfect, do what you feel is right. The nurses will be able to help you while you're staying in the hospital and they can answer any questions you may have. You're also taking classes which will help when the baby comes. <br>  <br>  Good luck, i'm sure you'll do just fine!|`|1ezYfkX7aa	Well i think so far your doing as much as you can =) I would go onto diff webpages and look up stuff about babies, i would say buy a book but its a waste cause you can find all the same info online for free. Just try to relax....your going to be a first time mom and believe it or not it pretty much comes natural once you have the baby here. I would just start to get the room ready, if anyone is planning you a baby shower then i would make a registry etc. Nothing to be scared of...its going to be the most amazing day of your life when you have that little blessing...best wishes =)|`|7vt21U1naa	Just relax i'm sure you're going to be just fine. Don't stress out too much because it'll effect the baby and it might cause you have a miscarriage.  As long as you're ready and the father is ready then you have nothing to worry about. You'll be a great mom i'm sure. You're old enough to take care of a baby =] <br>  <br>  And being scared is pretty normal. So don't freak out too much =]|`|PYIA2FCFaa	it will come natural to u once you have your baby. I wasnt sure what I was doing either but, for some reason it just all clicked in immediately. we all have this mother intuition :)  <br>  <br>  just dont be like some mothers i know who leave their kids at home by themselves with a baby so she can go out and get drunk and be a slut.|`|rC6gL7KOaa	It sounds like you're on the right track. It's good that you are taking parenting classes and taking lamaze. I would advise you to continue with the parenting classes. Becoming a mom for the first time is scary, don't think you're along. I'm 24, married to a wonderful man, and we're financially and emotinally ready for this baby. But I still get scared, and it's ok. Do the best you can and start practicing patience because you'll need it. Are you bipolar ( I see that's your screen name). Make sure you take all of your meds. Oh and read, read, read. The doctor's office usually has lots of baby and parenting magazines and they don't mind you taking them home. I have tons of them and I read a lot in my spare time. I learn a lot too.|`|8UujqaV0aa	i was pregnant with my first child, my son at 19 and i definitely know what you are talking about the fear, but once you see that little bundle of joy you almost instinctively know what to do with them. its normal to be fearful of many things during pregnancy, i am now 7 months pregnant with my 2nd child and im afraid of a lot of things. just do whatyou ree doing now in trying topreparew and talk to your partner about your fears, you might be surprised on how hw feels alot of the same way. just know thatyou ree not alone and it will turn out to be okay. best of luck.|`|gClDDlgjaa	Well first to get ready for the baby you should start getting baby things if you haven't already.you should also make sure you have plenty of diapers and bottles trust me I know these things and also make sure you can focus on the baby when it's born.|`|AA11542929	every new mother goes thru that at some point.. im currently 35 weeks tomorrow and im haviing 2nd thoughts but when the baby iis born u will know what to do when it comes down to whats wrong.. its called maternal instincts.. and u can also ask family.. they know more cuz they been there.. good luck|`|pSOMZH66aa	my only piece of advice to you i am just like you but you will love her no matter what trust me just love her and just be goood to her and do what you can!

How else can you tell them? She's waited so long, they're going to be MORE hurt. She should have told them right when she found out she was pregnant. <br>  I'm sure once the parents see her and how her belly is growing, they will know that she is pregnant. There's no other way but to just straight up tell them. They will be upset no matter what.|`|QrZcKRsDaa	I'm a little confused...it's way too late for her to get an abortion, you know that, right? <br>  As far as adoption, the decision is ultimately up to her, but it should definitely be something you all work out together. The best thing to do is just tell her parents & get it over with...yes, they'll be upset, but when they see that baby I'm sure they'll fall in love with it. Good luck to both of you!|`|AA11542929	not to be rude but u sound like my baby dad.. lol.. u need to tell them before tehy find out adn wanna kill u.. lol.. and being catholic dont mean anything.. my parents are catholic and i am fine not dead still alive.. lol.. BE A MAN AND MAN UP TO UR ACTIONS TELL THEM AND HAVE HER TELL THEM TOO..YALL TWO LAID DOWN TOGETHER AND HAD THAT FUN U TWO GOTTA PAY FOR THE CONSEQUENCES.!!! GOOD LUCK/.. AND BE SURE TO TELL THEM U GOT ANTOEHR ON THE WAY!!|`|159e15bc29abe3e551d868753b39f233aa	well, honestly if she wants to keep the baby........ support her behind it. your her man. She wants/needs your support. Try and work with her on it. Good luck though!! :)|`|seU9VwIJaa	If you're responsible enough to have sex, you are responsible enough to deal with the consequences. Sex does create a baby believe it or not! If she didn't call to make an appointment for an abortion, maybe she actually considered the baby's life. If she is interested in adoption, have her look at open adoption. <a href="http://www.adoptionhelp.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.adoptionhelp.org</a> is a really good site that explains it. If you tell the parents with a plan in mind, I'm sure they will take it much easier. Don't just say "hi, your daughter is pregnant." Explain to them how you are going to deal with the situation. If they are strict Catholics, don't even mention considering saying you were going to abort it. Most places won't do it now anyways. <br>  Have Nicole look at open adoption. You will always know how your child is doing and still be responsible about it.<br>  Good luck with your decision|`|YuVd3Vx2aa	Well,I dont believe in the abortion. If someone is going to have sex they need to take the resposibibty. The way to tell her mother im not sure. I would just sit down with them. They might be mad for a while but they will get over it and love that baby. I just got pregnant and i still have not told my parents. but wheather they like it or not. idc. it was my choice, and my boyfriends. I think yall should keep the baby, and be a family.

Because I'm pretty sure they pay for that with the money THEY earnt from THEIR jobs, and I'm pretty sure they've forked out quite a bit more than the price of a cell phone for you.

Iz5tNA5aaa	It may not be CP, don't panic yet.  The foot specialist should be able to help.<br>  <br>  My oldest child (now almost 11) was a chronic toe walker.  He couldn't stand flat footed at about age 4 to 5 because his Achilles' tendon was "tight" or short.  He needed special braces he wore when he slept that helped stretch the tendon. He never complained that it hurt. Once the tendon reached the proper size, we did exercises to strengthen it and then he started walking flat footed more.<br>  <br>  We had to keep reminding him to walk flat but he now walks almost all of the time flat footed, especially in shoes.  Every now and then he will walk on his toes barefoot until he remembers and than walks flat footed. <br>  <br>  If you notice, some adults bob up and down a little more than other people, it's because they are toe walkers.  As my son is maturing and growing, his weight is naturally helping him walk flat footed.  <br>  <br>  Hope this helped.  Good luck!|`|mx3gFmIKaa	Yes, its a concern.  It should have been addressed at age 2.  <br>  <br>  Suggest switching pediatricians.  What is tight is the achilles tendon.  He needs physical therapy.<br>  <br>  You can start now by pulling up on the toes a few times a day.  <br>  <br>  Does he toe walk with shoes on?  If so another thing to get him down is ankle weights.  Buy women's fitness neoprene wrist weights in half pound each weight or 1 lb each weight to help keep him off the toes.<br>  <br>  Another thing about sensory issues, which could be a problem to try brushing the bottoms of his feet with a bristle brush, use deep pressure.  This will help develop his immature nervous system, which is immature in all children till age 6-7.<br>  <br>  CP is a catch all diagnosis referring to uneven body tone or dystonia.  This would mean that one side of the body is weaker than the other.  It can be dx on clinical opinion, or an MRI, or both.  Mild CP can be undx, or dx later.  Certainly if he has it its very mild, and not going to impede his development, its not panic worthy, he is very agile and able.<br>  <br>  Suggest seeing a neurologist.  I don't think he/she will tell you anything else but I do believe in preventative medicine rather than waiting for a problem to grow to address it.<br>  <br>  I am not an advocate of wait and see its fine.  It may be, but what if it isn't?  Address it now before the problem grows.<br>  <br>  I know not everybody takes this approach.  But this seems like a no brainer to me.  Example:  my husband's family has a history of heart disease.  My FIL had several tia's  (mini-stroke) 25 years ago.  In the past 10 years all 8 of his siblings have had a heart attack or stroke.  Now if it were me after a couple of my siblings had this, I would be at the doctor saying I need an EKG, blood pressure monitoring, stress test whatever to prevent it from happening to me.  All of them waited until they stroked out or had a heart attack before getting any cardiac treatment.<br>  <br>  Contact your local school district if in the US.  He will be able to be assessed and begin the developmental delay preschool for Physical therapy, there are typical paying peers in the class as well.<br>  <br>  Prognosis is excellent.  He will get PT for this year, maybe into next too.  He may need orthodics (support) in his shoes.  These are covered by medical insurance.  The PT will refer you if necessary.|`|MAbqM6aEaa	My daughter who is 2.5 toes walks.  We were referred to get her a physical therapy evaluation to make sure the tendons in her ankle were stretching enough.  She can walk flat footed when she wants but 95% of the time she toe walks.  She has been identified as having sensory integration disorder and this is one of the many symptoms.  You might want to research it to see if your son fits any of the categories.  My daughter is fine and will most likely grow out of it I was told.|`|0SIhrYCbaa	When she said its tight, I'd say she was referring to the tendons in his heels, feet, legs?<br>  My friends little girl does this and she has just been referred to a new doctor also. She is just four but has never walked flat footed.<br>  I can't imagine having a CP diagnosis at your sons age. That's normally something that's obvious much earlier. Good luck.|`|7BKmhV47aa	my nephew walked on his toes for several years, the doctors told him that alot of kids do this because they are alot smaller so to reach things they stand on their toes to make it easier to reach. it just a phase and they will out grow it eventually. |`|AA10186411	When I saw your question, thats the first thing that came to mind, Cerebral Palsy.  But I'm almost certain it would have been diagnosed before now.  Children with Cerebral Palsy drool alot, have developmental delays, can be extremely floppy or stiff, and toe-walk.  Your child only has one of these symptoms, so I'm not quite sure he has it?  They do an MRI or CT of the child's brain to determine if there is any brain damage, to rule out CP, or to make it a diagnosis.  I hope the best for you!

My 3 1/2 ws doing that (but he was very clumsy) and the doc refered us to physical therapy(which he loves) he is a little delayed, but no one can see it but the therapist- I guess because she knows all about what age they should be doing stuff. <br>  talk to food doc and see if they think he will just grow out of it?<br>  good luck<br>  ps. the super hyper part scares me because I have another child who is /has been on asthma meds for most of his life. if he starts being super hyper I will go insane..lol

Certaines conditions sont cependant à respecter pour pouvoir interpréter correctement les conclusions:<br>  <br>  Le moment de la réalisation : <br>  - pour la femme : en période pré-ovulatoire (un ou deux jours avant la date prévue de l'ovulation ), car le maillage de la structure mucoproté?que se resserre dès l'ovulation sous l'effet de la montée de progestérone. La surveillance de la température est par conséquent une aide précieuse pour l'interprétation, à posteriori. Un éventuel traitement stimulateur peut améliorer la production de glaire si elle a été constatée insuffisante lors d'un test précédant.<br>  - pour l'homme: après une abstinence sexuelle située entre 3 et 5 jours avant le rapport servant au test<br>  <br>  Le rapport sexuel : <br>  - doit avoir lieu entre 6 et 12 heures avant le recueil de glaire. <br>  - doit être suivi d'une période de repos allongé pour la femme d'une durée minimale de 30 minutes.<br>  - ne doit être suivi d'aucune toilette vaginale avant le recueil de glaire.<br>  <br>  Le recueil de glaire: <br>  - d'éventuelles sécrétions vaginales sont prélevées à l'écouvillon pour analyse cytobactériologique.<br>  - l'exocol est nettoyé ("mouché") par un tampon cotonneux pour éviter la contamination par les sécrétions vaginales.<br>  - la glaire endocervicale est aspirée (Aspiglaire de Jondet, seringue à tuberculine sans aiguille, ...).<br>  - le recueil est apporté au technicien dès que possible.<br>  <br>  Le transport de la glaire: <br>  - ne pose aucun problème après obturation de l'extrémité du dispositif type Aspiglaire par un bouchon, pour éviter la déshydratation. <br>  - il faut également veiller à réduire au maximum la quantité d'air présente dans le dispositif de prélèvement.<br>  - la conservation de la glaire peut être effectuée jusqu'à 4 jours au réfrigérateur à 4° sans problèmes particuliers. La congélation est déconseillée.<br>  <br>  Le test biologique:<br>  - il s'agit désormais d'un examen biologique à part entière (B 45), avec obligations de résultats, remis au patient.<br>  - le résultat doit comporter (obligations légales de la nomenclature, n° d'ordre 070): "le jour du cycle, le délai depuis le co?t, le degré de dilatation du col, de l'abondance, de la filance, de la transparence de la glaire ; la densité de spermatozo?des par champ, le pourcentage de spermatozo?des mobiles progressifs, non progressifs (avec précision du caractère éventuellement oscillant) et immobiles", ainsi que le PH.<br>  - L'examen s'effectue au microscope (si possible en contraste de phase), à l'objectif x 25.<br>  <br>  L'interprétation : <br>  Le test est satisfaisant :<br>  - le délai depuis le rapport (8 à 12 heures), l'abondance (+++), la filance (viscosité minimale), la transparence, la cristallisation (de troisième et quatrième ordre), le PH (entre 6,5 et 8,5) sont corrects.<br>  - La glaire ne comporte que peu de cellules, peu de leucocytes, pas ou peu de germes<br>  - La glaire renferme plus de 20 spermatozo?des mobiles (fléchants et lents) par champ microscopique (fonction du grossissement, habituellement entre x250 et x400).<br>  <br>  Le test est négatif du fait de la mauvaise qualité de la glaire : <br>  - La glaire est peu abondante, visqueuse, opaque, cristallisant mal<br>  - La glaire comporte d'assez nombreux leucocytes et / ou cellules <br>  - Les spermatozo?des vivants mobiles sont rares ou absents.<br>  <br>  Le test est négatif avec une glaire de bonne qualité: <br>  - Le délai depuis le rapport (8 à 12 heures), l'abondance (+++), la filance (viscosité minimale), la transparence, la cristallisation (de troisième et quatrième ordre), le PH (entre 6,5 et 8,5) sont corrects.<br>  - La glaire ne comporte que peu de cellules, peu de leucocytes, pas ou peu de germes.<br>  - La glaire ne renferme pas plus de 5 à 10 spermatozo?des vivants mobiles par champs.|`|48de382f241d8b79b826238433311aebaa	Bonjour!<br>  Ce test a été réalisé pour ma part après plusieurs tentatives de stimulations simples infructueuses. Il a été réalisé juste avant l'ovulation  : il faut avoir un rapport la veille au soir et 12h après ce rapport, il faut se rendre au CPMA afin que le gynéco fasse un prélèvement de ta glaire cervicale. Il va ainsi voir si ta glaire est de bonne qualité et si les spermatozo?des sont nombreux et bougent bien.Si oui, tout va bien, si non on te proposera s?rement l'insémination ou la FIV.<br>  Bon courage<br>  Pour ma part, je ne suis toujours pas enceinte après 4ans de tentatives.....|`|9b35251e2b591603f3c3ea85f9660006aa	c'est un des plus beaux examens de ma vie.<br>  <br>  On a fait le test de Huhner ou post coital au milieu du cycle soit le 02 mai 2007.

5mrdSChMaa	It's possible, but more difficult for someone with PCOS. I have PCOS. The doctor can prescribe medication to help you ovulate if you are trying to get pregnant. See your ob/gyn. If your periods are regular now, great. But just because you have a period one time doesn't mean they will be regular again. My doctor prescribed Glucophage for me. It helps. Google it for PCOS. Talk to your ob/gyn and they can even refer you to a specialist if needed.|`|af357a71c25eaeb1c68fbbea2e1a3560aa	It is extremely rare to have normal periods while pregnant. Most likely you are not.

LAZRQ86uaa	On pourrait te faire une césarienne<br>  Ma fille a eu ce problème à la naissance mais comme ma dernière écho datait de mon 6ème mois, ils ne s'en sont aper?u qu'au moment de la naissance, elle avait le cordon qui faisait 3 tours autour du cou, ils n'arrivaient pas à le couper tellement il était serré, son rythme cardiaque est descendu à 60 et j'ai cru qu'elle allait y passer ou avoir des séquelles tellement elle était bleu comme un schtroumph<br>  Après ils m'ont dit que s'ils avaient vu cela plus t?t, j'aurai accouché par césarienne pour éviter le traumatisme et les risque de séquelles. C'était il y a 16 ans et tout va bien depuis<br>  Je pense qu'on va surveiller le cordon afin d'éviter tout problème pour ton accouchement et pour le bébé.|`|596b11a8394de9734d8de8b6ddde7a01aa	Le risque, c'est surtout que le cordon se serre.<br>  <br>  Mais on surveille le coeur du bébé pour vérifier qu'il va bien., comme pour tout le monde, en fait.<br>  <br>  Environ un bébé sur 3 a le cordon autour du coup, en général à la naissance il suffit de le faire repasser autour de la tête, ou parfois de le couper t?t, à peine la tête sortie, et tout va bien.<br>  Ne vous inquiétez pas, ?a n'a rien d'inquiétant, des bébés avec le cordon autour du coup, il en nait tous les jours.<br>  Des petits coquets, en somme!|`|d3613d486b19548f85c0a0ba90e73d01aa	Tu ferais mieux de poser la question à ton échographe et à ton gygy !|`|ACanZIHoaa	Puisque le cas a été découvert lors d'une écho, l'équipe est désormais au courant !

tM1Osw60aa	First of all, there's nothing gross about your question!  Colostrum and milk are part of baby-raising, and so is leaking :)  Let-down (the reflex that makes you leak) is partly emotionally-driven, so it is normal that you would leak if your son is upset or crying.  Most breast feeding mothers will leak for the first few months when they hear a baby (any baby, not just their own) cry or fuss.  Some will leak if they just so much as think of their baby!<br>  <br>  So, yes, it's normal and no, it's not gross :)|`|93e5e66462cba8bcd411219422deababaa	ok, it snormal for when you ehar your son upset or hungry you will leak or even if you think about him<br>   i am a nursing mommy and its easierr for me to pump if my son is near|`|p77IaBoIaa	Well I can't answer your question as I am not breastfeeding :( but I just wanted to tell you that it is NOT gross!

It will help you too with the "maternal stores" of fat you will require gaining during pregnancy....eat healthy drink water and love those beautiful babies!!!|`|O2de9lAvaa	Yup.  Normal... and not gross at all!  I remember wlaking through Wal-Mart when my daughter was tiny, a baby in the next aisle started to cry and instantly my shirt was wet!!

cnMXJMFUaa	Normal. Pregnant women can have some light irregular bleeding during pregnancy, but it should not be like a “normal” period. Some women can confuse this for their period because often it can come right around the time she was expecting her normal period. The irregular bleeding or spotting that can occur during pregnancy is often a dark brown color or a light pinkish. It should not be enough bleeding to fill pads or tampons.<br>  <br>  No need to worry IMO|`|GjHzKkahaa	Sounds like it could just be implantation bleeding but you really should have it checked to be sure.  I understand that you have no insurance, but you are indeed pregnant and will be needing to see doctors to ensure a healthy pregnancy.  There should be some resources in your area to help with costs and care...  I'd give more info but I'm not sure where you are.  In our are we have Planned Parenthood which will help expecting mom's that are not insured.<br>  <br>  Good luck to you and your little one!|`|54801871c050b024821535493cce8924aa	Constint bleeding is not good if you are past twenty weeks. If you are having intercourse that could cause bleeding. My expierence of was that I had a miscarriage. Honestly the best thing I can tell you is so go to the emergency so that they can check you. Another thing you should look into getting medical or some kind of assistance from the county that way you or that baby can get checked to make sure you are in the best of health. Good Luck!|`|PSlnDh8eaa	It could just be implantation, a lot of people get this confused with other things. The part that worries me though is the heavier, red blood. When I had my miscarriage I had a balloon shaped pocket of RED blood come out, so just keep an eye on it, and my doctor has said if you bleed enough to fill up a pad, go to the ER ASAP, it is your child you are talking about!! Good luck!!|`|Q0WARis0aa	first off it sounds like you may have but also it bleeds for much longer i would noe it happend to me you dont have to worry about insurance when you get to the hospital and tell them whats wrong and they ask for it say you need CHARITY CARE they pay for all expenses so you dont have to worry..<br>  hope i helped...|`|d2ac8b67123a9bcea490ee26fff78022aa	It happened to me when I was pregnant. The Dr. asked me a series of questions like was I active riding a bike or had engaged in sex recently. Sexual activity can sometimes cause bleeding. It turned out to be nothing I guess I have a beautiful perfectly healthy 4 year old.|`|UxYWC2CNaa	Some people they have a normal period during pregnancy that is what I know.
OsRIALBOaa	it seems like she is not ready and she doesnt want to be ready. I think adoption is the way to go. Is better for the baby to have adotive parents that having a mother who is indifferent to him|`|dA4gShdVaa	Why does a 16 year old need taking care of?  She's pregnant..not sick.  If you are giving her a roof over her head and feeding her..the least she can do is help around the house.  Regardless of that, adoption seems like the best option if you ask me.  She can't support a child and it's not her parents job to do it either.|`|UzGGflRfaa	as a parent who has given up a child for adoption, this would totally be the best way to go.(for her)  what i would do is ask her to watch your son for a day or two to give her a real taste on what its like. i swear if i had actually had to take care of a child by my self for a bit b4 i got prego i would have been a virgin for a loooooooooooonnnnnggggg time. but then on the other hand...now that i AM a parent of 3 other children....i couldnt see giving up a child again. while i wasnt ready again after the adoption.....and i was ambivilant about it....once she was here EVERYTHING changed  no partying no drinking and keeping a real job..........but i would def get her to watch ur son for a few just to give her a taste|`|30df7c325ae8f7474ce61c26a63fc215aa	First of all i think that you taking her in is good.<br>  But sit her down and ask her if she has questions.<br>  Take her and have her take care of your son.<br>  <br>  Connect with her, share stories.<br>  tell her what she will be in for in the future.<br>  <br>  good luck, and have fun.|`|AA10168060	Perhaps she has given up the idea of keeping her baby and she feels like it is better not to ask you things or to interact with your son. Some females believe they will just know what to do as if it comes naturally with child birth. She may feel uncomfortable having strangers care for her in her pregnancy rather than her parents. Maybe she could find a foster home for the child  until she is 18 and able to move out of her parents home.<br>  Was she placed in your home to learn how to be a mother or just somewhere to be while she is pregnant? If it is the latter, then that explains why she is not taking interest in motherhood.|`|IwrBZ8zvaa	talk to her about it see if she even wants to keep the baby|`|LyVjjelGaa	I think adoption is for sure the better way to go. My mother got pregnant with me when she was 15...and she let me be adopted. And speaking from a childs perspective it was the best thing she could have done for me....I love my life and I had an amzing childhood thanks to my birth mother being brave doing what was best for me. I found her when I was 16, and though I love her....I am so glad that I didnt grow up with her, I wouldnt be in college right now or anything had I had a different life.|`|cAqvVRsPaa	get out now while you can, why do you think her parents dodged this bullet? because they knew that she would have the baby demand to keep it , get bored with it and vwola! you've now got two infants and a teenager that disrespects you cause all you want her to do is look after her baby and thats not fun. she will go out and party ect make your life a living hell and quite possibly get pregnant again. She doesn't seem at all phased with the fact that see has created life. toooo immature|`|e256f3872ba1daf6569b52715f60585daa	hey cowboy,<br>  <br>  No one can be forced to raise a child if they're not ready -- it's not good for the child or the parent.  does she have a counselor she's been speaking with?  has she voiced her plan to you about what she wants?  Perhaps you can drop a bug in her doctor's ear and he/she can discuss ideas with her.  is she still in h.s. and going/passing her classes? is she physically taking care of herself and unborn child?  Can you put a folder together of programs available should she decide to parent as well as a folder regarding the adoption option?<br>  <br>  She deserves to see all options in front of her and she has to make a decision best for the baby.|`|i1829mriaa	I would talk to her and make sure she knows that adoption is perfectly ok in her situation. She is only 16 and well I acted the same way when I was that age, just too young to care for a baby (not to say she is a bad person) She has her whole life ahead of her. It suxs that her parents ditched her in time of need, whether she made a bad decision or not. That is her family, and I agree family should stick together. Good Luck with what happens...|`|nWvWyS1raa	its a hard decision just let her know whats going on your mind ... but too i would start asking alot of question.. alot.  im 16 weeks pregnant and man i havent told my parents... she just needs to pay more attention to your routines... let her know have a talk with her...|`|tbMV3yOFaa	I think that it sounds like you are doing a great job.  I would continue to be a good example to her and show her how much you love your son.  With that being said you could sit down and have a conversation with her about her possibly giving up the baby for adoption.  It would be hard for her but it would be a loving thing to do in her situation.
XOoxPm0gaa	You can but it's not advised, it's messy and you are usually pretty sore anyways!|`|VELnLnIKaa	you can but its so gross dont do it|`|8VJwoGXKaa	Of course.  As long as the guy doesn't mind lol.  I made my bf wear a condom because without one it BURNED really bad.|`|ZwW5YlVgaa	absolutely. Its messy but harmless. You still need to use protection though, you can get pregnant even if your on your period.<br>  <br>  ** also your last question about shaving, you can buy a cream called "bikini zone" and it is meant for those red spots after shaving. It takes the itch out immediately and the bumps are gone within a day! You can use it to prevent them as well. So right after you shave, put some on and you wont get any bumps at all! Its cheap too like maybe about 8 bucks?|`|cc881f333a62c4ba5cd8491952218616aa	Personally i have never done it. Nor will i do it. I think it's gross to think about. But u can have sex on your period. It is harmless, but gross.|`|aoQHWpwMaa	Yeh you can but its pretty messy!!|`|rFLW1kVYaa	you can yes...its a bit messy but no harm in it|`|VsbIcFC5aa	you can, but who really wants to?|`|WsCgi50Zaa	Go for it!!!(: a girs gotta do what a girls gotta do.|`|df9WsYFNaa	Sure can.  My periods have always been really light so it's not much of a bother.|`|LuNIHklsaa	Yeah, no problem
Rwwhp2BFaa	Yes, you should definately take a test. Some women can have their period right up to the day of delivery. If the test is negative, you should go see a gynecologist to see why you are leaking. There could be other reasons.|`|yVvnZ4hpaa	Of course!  I promise, no one will look at you weirdly when you purchase the test. They won't even notice.  Though the spots on your nipples could be lactation, it would certainly be very early for that to begin.  If you think you are pregnant...what date due you think you conceived? In any case, buy the test and see what it says.  I would also make an appointment with your doctor to see why your periods are so irregular.

mVcwgVq3aa	I've had both. My son was an induced vaginal birth and my daughter was an emergency c-section. I think if I had one more child I would choose a vaginal birth. I had an epidural with my son so I felt nothing and the recovery was a lot easier. With my daughter it was very difficult and painful to get up and move around and even the simplest tasks were almost unbearable. I was confined to my couch for a month after the c-section because I was in pain, but I do not handle pain well. As for after the vaginal birth, I was back into it after a few days. It was a lot easier.<br>  Good luck!!!|`|s5c01qRLaa	I don't know of any doctor which will let you opt for a c-section if they feel you can have a vaginal birth, except in some cases if the dad is deployed with the military (my OB has done that in some cases). My doctor is requiring that I have a c-section due to the size of my baby boy. If I had the option, I would definitely go with a vaginal birth. There are risks with a c-section and the recovery (from my reading) appears to be easier with a vaginal.<br>  <br>  Yes, you can have more than one child after a c-section. Depending on your doctor and your hospital you may be required to have a c-section, but some will allow you to attempt a VBAC (vaginal birth after c-section).|`|znkumaA1aa	Im not sure why someone would "opt" for a cesarean. Cesareans are for emergency complications. Deciding to have a c-sections should be illegal and I'm sure that once people start being honest about what's happening years after cesareans, it will be. Ask women who have had them how horrible the recovery is and how painful the scar and scar tissue is afterwards. You would do better getting the baby out in the same manor that it went in.|`|YJNql5Mgaa	I had an emergency C-section, otherwise I would have done a vaginal birth.  I'm still recovering from my C-section, almost 2 weeks later.  I heard that vaginal births are easier to recover from.  <br>  <br>  I don't know about Elective C-Sections.  When I talk about it, I don't say I gave birth, cuz I kind of feel like I didn't since it was a surgery.  I dunno.  I'd say stick with the vaginal birth.|`|HWITL3O4aa	I work in an NICU, if you have a medical reason, then C-section, otherwise vaginal.  I've seen to many C-sections that were due to basically Mom being tired of being pregnant and the baby paying the price plus the extended recovery time for Mom and potential hazards from the c-section itself.  It is rare with a c-section, but with any surgical procedure there can be very negative consequences.  I have seen them all over the past 18 years.|`|dd2d386096f95b4c9c13d046234f4dddaa	C-section should be reserved only for cases in which a vaginal birth is not possible.  <br>  <br>  It makes me crazy that a major surgical procedure is being offered as an alternative birth method for women who don't need it.  It's a MAJOR SURGICAL PROCEDURE.  <br>  <br>  They cut through your stomach muscles and remove the baby from the womb, then they have to sew all those layers back up.  And for what?  So you don't have a painful birth experience?  Sure.. and the three week recovery time isn't painful at all...<br>  <br>  If you don't NEED a c-section, what on earth would possess you to choose one?|`|38ddc9bef24d3c1eb6a19425a506078aaa	I had a vaginal delivery and wouldn't want it any other way.

45xNJ7Ncaa	Try re-testing in 2 days.  If you're pregnant, it will show a darker line.|`|wENdWT5kaa	Doesn't matter or faint or dark the line is, as long as you see a line, it means that you are pregnant. Congrats. |`|MHg9JhEKaa	Yes this happened to me. The line wasn't there at first, but then it appeared oh so faintly. It was positive. But this was right on the day my period was due, rather than 4 weeks after. Do another test first thing in the morning, and also see your GP for a blood test. Like someone else has said it is very rare to get a false positive....  <br>  <br>  |`|Xc02z608aa	they say any sign of a positive result, no matter how faint means that you are pregnant as false positives are very rare.

Heck ether way make an appointment and they can let you know for sure and can rull out any health issues that could be causing late periods! Good luck!|`|isokr9cfaa	yes this happened to me and I was pregnant. Some brands are like that, and they're very faint. I chose to get another test done after that one to make sure I was pregnant and I was. I recommend, clear blue digital or First Response. Those two are one's I've had the most success with. Good luck. And congrats if you're pregnant. |`|twNXyBLVaa	you can always have a false positive test but it is very rare to have a false negative. i would suggest you go to your doctor or local health dept and get a blood test. if you need to they offer reduced priced blood tests. the one in my area only charges ten dollars |`|krPMGnMAaa	i think you should take a digital test, they say positive or negative, and also they are much more sensitive then normal tests, i was still getting positive on them 20 weeks after my miscarriage, if your still unsure go see your GP for a blood test|`|U1dpsk6haa	yes! you are pregnant! i had the same thing happen to me and was told that if u ever see a line, no matter how faint, its positive. if u read the insert ot will say the same thing. congrats!!|`|17676a9a63e170f7326aee84a83037cfaa	I had that happen to me a few months ago.

You can never never get a false positive|`|orSehCahaa	try another test just to check if nothing then and your still concered pop along to your doctors and they will run some tests to see if you are. good luck.|`|Jy6G6vfQaa	I have two children and one on the way.  I found out with the first two babies 2 days after my period was due.  I had started taking pregnancy tests a week before and i kept seeing a very faint line, but kept telling myself it was an evaporation line. With my third baby, I was so anxious that i started testing a week and a half early and got the same results about five minutes or so after doing the test when the directions state to not interpret results, but i was pregnant. All women's bodies are different and you might just now have enough hcg in your body to register positive.|`|jCFOJAH4aa	I had this problem a couple of years ago. My period was late so I took a test. The faintest line showed up, but as it was so faded, both me and my partner weren't sure. So I made an appointment to see the nurse. I didn't tell her that I had already taken a test the day before. So when she made me do another test at the nurses practice. She said it was negative. I must have given her a strange look because she asked me what was wrong. Which was when I told her about the test I did the day before. Just as she was about to throw the test in the bin. She took another look at it and held it up to the light, which was the only way she could see it. All she said to me then was "Oh.....it is positive."<br>  Anyway, go see your nurse or GP. Just make sure they look at the test properly!

XQ3jHM9aaa	Since you are breastfeeding, it could possibly be the food that you are eating that is making him have bad gas.  Most vegetables messed with my kids stomach when I was nursing, especially things like cabbage and broccoli, and also beans.  Anything that would give you gas, could give him gas since it passes through your milk.  I hope that this helps.  I remember one night I ate sour crout and my daughter was up all night...<br>  Best of luck.|`|fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	The nipple shield can effect this in two ways:<br>  1) Baby swallows more air<br>  2) Baby can't effectively empty the breast so they get all "foremilk"<br>  <br>  If  you are using a nipple shield you need to also pump to maintain your supply, this milk is not offered to the baby unless absolutely necessary and never in a bottle.  It can be frozen for later use.<br>  <br>  Another cause of gas in babies and nipple pain in mom is yeast/thrush.<br>  <br>  You really need to get help in person to stop using the shield.  In the meantime try breast compressions to increase the fat content of the milk the baby does get.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.kellymom.com/babyconcerns/gassybaby.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.kellymom.com/babyconcerns/gas...</a><br>  Some causes of gas in babies<br>  <br>      * Many young babies have a certain amount of gas and seem to strain as it is passed or as a bowel movement occurs simply because of the immaturity of their digestive system. This doesn't always indicate a problem. Most babies' bodies manage gas more easily with growth, maturity, and greater activity. As long as your baby is not overly bothered by the gas or has no other symptoms of food sensitivity or other problems, then "tincture of time" is likely the best solution.<br>  <br>      * Too much milk too fast, so that baby gulps and chokes and takes in too much air along with the milk. See forceful let-down.<br>  <br>      * Anything that causes baby to take in too much air may result in a gassy baby (what goes in must come out!):<br>            o Crying - Babies swallow air when they are crying, so crying is more likely to be the cause of gas, rather than the result of gas. Respond to baby's feeding cues promptly.<br>            o Bottlefeeding - Babies usually swallow more air when drinking from a bottle. When using bottles, use the slowest-flow nipples so baby doesn't get overwhelmed with the milk flow. To reduce air swallowing, keep baby at about a 45 degree angle (rather than lying down), make sure baby has a good seal on the base of the nipple, and keep the bottle tilted so the neck & nipple are filled with milk. There are also varieties of bottles that aim to reduce air swallowing. Don't let baby suck on an empty bottle. Burp baby more often if he seems to be swallowing too much air.<br>  <br>      * Overabundant milk supply. See Too Much Milk?<br>  <br>      * Thrush can cause gassiness in babies.<br>  <br>      * Babies who skip several days between stools tend to be gassier. Older breastfed babies (after the first 6-8 weeks) can go several days without a stool. Ten days or more is not uncommon! The long periods between stools in a baby who is obviously thriving is not a cause for concern if the baby's abdomen remains soft, baby is content and alert, and the stool is soft and profuse if several days have gone by.<br>  <br>      * Sensitivity to something in mother's diet, including any vitamin/iron supplements, etc. See Dairy and other Food Sensitivities in Breastfed Babies. If this is the reason, you will most likely notice other symptoms, such as excessive spitting up or vomiting, colic, diarrhea, rash, persistent congestion or runny nose.<br>  <br>      * Anything that baby is eating/drinking other than mother's milk, including vitamins, formula, teas, medications or herbs, solids, juice. Any substance (other than breastmilk) has a much greater potential to increase gassiness rather than reduce it.<br>  <br>      * Formula feeding tends to cause more gas and digestive upset for most babies because it is not specific to the human baby. Formula-fed babies overall tend to spit up more, be constipated more, have more gas, be more colicky, have more intestinal illnesses, etc. Remember, too, that supplementation most always undermines your milk supply and may result in premature weaning.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.kellymom.com/bf/concerns/baby/wean-shield.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.kellymom.com/bf/concerns/baby...</a><br>  Disadvantages to using a nipple shield<br>  <br>  Disadvantages to the nipple shield include:<br>  <br>      * baby may get less milk if the shield is used incorrectly<br>      * mom is more at risk for plugged ducts and mastitis (due to reduced milk transfer)<br>      * it can be difficult to wean from the shield<br>  <br>  Although nipple shields should be used only after other options have been tried, it is better to have a baby on the breast with a shield than not on the breast at all! <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.kellymom.com/newman/15breast_compression.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.kellymom.com/newman/15breast_...</a><br>  The purpose of breast compression is to continue the flow of milk to the baby once the baby no longer drinks (“open mouth wide—pause—then close mouth” type of suck) on his own, and thus keep him drinking milk. Breast compression simulates a letdown reflex and often stimulates a natural letdown reflex to occur. The technique may be useful for:<br>  <br>     1. Poor weight gain in the baby<br>     2. Colic in the breastfed baby<br>     3. Frequent feedings and/or long feedings<br>     4. Sore nipples in the mother<br>     5. Recurrent blocked ducts and/or mastitis<br>     6. Encouraging the baby who falls asleep quickly to continue drinking not just sucking<br>  <br>  Breast compression is not necessary if everything is going well. When all is going well, the mother should allow the baby to “finish” feeding on the first side and, if the baby wants more, offer the other side. How do you know the baby is finished? When he no longer drinks at the breast (“open mouth wide—pause—then close mouth” type of suck).<br>  <br>  Breast compression works particularly well in the first few days to help the baby get more colostrum. Babies do not need much colostrum, but they need some. A good latch and compression help them get it.<br>  <br>  It may be useful to know that:<br>  <br>     1. A baby who is well latched on gets milk more easily than one who is not. A baby who is poorly latched on can get milk only when the flow of milk is rapid. Thus, many mothers and babies do well with breastfeeding in spite of a poor latch, because most mothers produce an abundance of milk.<br>     2. In the first 3-6 weeks of life, many babies tend to fall asleep at the breast when the flow of milk is slow, not necessarily when they have had enough to eat. After this age, they may start to pull away at the breast when the flow of milk slows down. However, some pull at the breast even when they are much younger, sometimes even in the first days.<br>     3. Unfortunately many babies are latching on poorly. If the mother’s supply is abundant the baby often does well as far as weight gain is concerned, but the mother may pay a price—such as, sore nipples, a “colicky” baby, and/or a baby who is constantly on the breast (but drinking only a small part of the time).<br>  <br>  Breast compression continues the flow of milk once the baby is no longer drinking from (only sucking at) the breast and results in the baby:<br>  <br>     1. Getting more milk.<br>     2. Getting more milk that is higher in fat.|`|oXzHvsBpaa	Try sitting him up for about 20 minutes after each feeding. That might help. Also talk to your doctor to make sure that he doesn't have Reflux. Our son was very fussy and hated to be layed down and would cry after all his feedings and it turned out that he had reflux.<br>  <br>  You could also pump and use Dr Browns bottles. Which work great for gas and colic. We swear up and down by them.|`|m3qSZelkaa	DR. BROWN BOTTLES!!!!! I had the same problem. I breast fed my son for the first month and probably got about 5 days worth the sleep out of that month. I tried everything as well. So a friend of mine suggest I go get a pump and pump then use Dr. Brown bottles so I was kinda skeptic on it but I tried it for a few days and WOW!

I have overactive letdown, and he is sensitive to any chocolate.<br>  <br>  Side lying nursing helps tons, I co-sleep and he goes to bed at 6-7pm and we don't get up until 7-8am. Side lying helps him relax and I tuck his knees up against my tummy while he feeds so it keeps his tummy compressed and helps keep out the gas.<br>  <br>  Also gas drops before feeding helps because it doesn't let the gas get to his lower intestines which then can't be helped by drops.|`|bUkwtZghaa	there is a possibility it is infant reflux or gerd.  Have you asked your pediatrician?  Otherwise, I would try things like, letting him either sleep in the car seat or do you co sleep at all?  That may help the lack of sleep.  If you nurse in bed you can at least catch some sleep then.  <br>  Also, try Gripe water.  We call it Magic Baby Water at my house.  It is great for any kind of tummy upset and it is all natural.  <br>  It stinks having a baby that is sad and in pain all day!  I hope it gets better for you!|`|mJKWF7I9aa	I've read that sometimes babies react to what you are eating.  If you eat a lot of dairy - he may be reacting to that.  Or there may be something else you are eating that is giving him gas.  Try changing around your diet.  <br>  <br>  Also - call your pediatrician - s/he may have some good suggestions.
U4JEgNPNaa	Sounds like you have an increase in estrogen in your system. Id get a blood test to check your levels.
bQTATDTyaa	Before I even opened the post I thought teething from the title.<br>  <br>  Sounds like teething. Try some teething tablets or a little tylenol. As long as he's still nursing some and going to the bathroom normally he'll be ok.|`|93e5e66462cba8bcd411219422deababaa	soundds liek he is distracted- try going into a quiet<br>   dim room to nurse him.|`|fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	<a href="http://www.kellymom.com/parenting/sleep/4mo-sleep.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.kellymom.com/parenting/sleep/...</a><br>  Has NO ONE stopped to consider the developmental stage of the breastfeeding baby that begins at about four months and can go on to 6 or 7 months? Think about your four month old breastfeeding -- what are they doing? This baby is on and off the breast -- so interested in the world around him he can hardly stand it. "Oh look! There's the dog! Hi, Mommy, I love you SOOOO much! The phone?! A car went by. The TV is on. Big sister comes into the room....hey, there's just too much going on for me to concentrate on eating. I think I'm full now. I'll see you later....."<br>  <br>  When I get one of these babies in my office, I have to observe the feed without saying a word to the mother. The entire feeding is done in complete silence so that the baby will EAT and not look around at me. How many times have you been told to go into a darkened, quiet room to get a good feeding? OK, now think about night time. Buford is really hungry -- he didn't eat well during the day. Nighttime is here; it's dark, quiet, and he has mommy's undivided attention. So he has a really great meal. Doesn't take long -- he's pretty efficient by now. But it is down to business and complete.<br>  <br>  But WAIT! Someone told the mother that the baby can't possibly be hungry -- just let him cry it out. Now mom's milk supply diminishes because punkin isn't eating well during the day -- too many things going on, and he's going through some new developmental stages (when Hildegarde is learning something new, she doesn't nurse as well until the new skill is mastered). IF mom has kept Buford/Hildegarde on a schedule since day 1, then she will probably NOT be able to increase her supply -- not with pumping, not with herbs. If she fed her baby frequently enough and laid down enough prolactin receptors in the first two weeks to a month, there is hope that we can bring the milk back up. But if she was truly "obeying" a schedule and only feeding every 2.5 to 3 hours, she may not be able to (depending on mom's breastmilk storage supplies, etc). <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.kellymom.com/babyconcerns/distractible-baby.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.kellymom.com/babyconcerns/dis...</a><br>  Is my baby distractible?<br>  <br>  Latch on, suck a moment, pull off... latch on, suck a moment, pull off. Nurse a minute, pull away to smile at mom. Nurse a minute, pull away to see who just walked in the room. Nurse a minute, pull away to listen to the TV. Nurse a moment, pull away because the dog wagged his tail.<br>  <br>  Sound familiar?? Baby starts to nurse and just as soon as your milk starts to let-down, baby pulls off and wiggles around in your lap. Babies aged two to six months are notorious for pulling off the breast at any distraction (real or imaginary) and tend to forget to let go before they turn around (ouch!).<br>  <br>  This is a passing developmental stage that can be quite a nuisance - it's usually at it's worst between four and five months. At around 2 months, your baby will become able to see things clearly across the room. At around 3 months, he'll start to stay awake longer and take a greater interest in the world around him. Your baby is also beginning to recognize that he is separate from mom. All of these things can result in a distractible baby. When baby first becomes aware of the rest of the world, he will have a hard time concentrating on nursing. In effect, he will be unable to "walk and chew gum at the same time." Once he gets a little older, he'll find it easier to both nurse and take in the world around him at the same time.<br>  <br>  [...]<br>  <br>   Many moms find it more and more difficult to nurse a distractible baby, and sometimes even interpret it personally ("I don't want mom any more" or "I don't want to nurse any more"). At the very least, it's frustrating to deal with a distractible baby. Less frequent/shorter nursing during this distractible stage can lead to a low milk supply, so do your best to get in a few decent feedings during the day.<br>  <br>  Until this stage has passed, baby may need a quiet place to nurse and/or more night nursing until he's figured out how to deal with distraction. Do take advantage of night nursing during this time - it doesn't matter when baby takes in his calories during a 24-hour period. One study showed that older babies can consume as much as 25% of their total daily intake of mother's milk during the night, probably partly because of daytime distractibility.<br>  <br>  Nursing in a quiet, darkened, boring room often helps. Talk in quiet, soothing tones (if you talk at all). Nurse while lying down; nap nurse. Cover baby with a shawl or put him in a sling to nurse. Nursing while in motion (walking, rocking) can also help baby to focus better on nursing. Try to catch your baby when he's more willing, such as when he's just waking up, already a little sleepy, or actually asleep. Baby's initial pulling off is probably not an indication that he is finished - just an indication that he saw/heard something interesting across the room. When he pulls off, try to coax him back to the breast a f|`|bUkwtZghaa	When babies abruptly stop nursing, it's a nursing strike - not weaning. Babies rarely wean on their own before 18-24 months, and self-weaning is almost never abrupt. <br>  <br>  Will baby nurse while asleep or just waking up? This is usually one of the best times to try. You also might try nursing lying down or while walking around. See also the tips at the top of this page for persuading baby to nurse. <br>  <br>  As long as baby is not nursing as often as before, you'll want to express milk to maintain your supply, stay comfortable, and reduce the risk of plugged ducts and mastitis. <br>  <br>  Don't miss the great links below about nursing strikes.
OI3bf4yjaa	Some foods that you can eat to help relieve the nausea could be anything salty like chips or pretzels, anything tart/sweet like pickles, lemonade, anything earthy like brown rice, mushroom soup, peanut butter, anything crunchy like celery sticks, apple slices, nuts, and anything dry like crackers. As for liquids you can try drinking juice, seltzer, sparkling water or ginger ale. Stick with eating cold foods instead of hot foods. (Cold foods tend not to smell as strong as hot foods). I know that strong smelling foods made me sick no problem. I found that sniffing a lemon or ginger relieved my upset stomach. (Sounds weird, but it really worked for me!)<br>  <br>  I hope I helped!
JP2h62qiaa	Once I was in the store for a really long time trying to shop with my son. I was standing in the check out line and this woman kept looking at me a worker. I felt like she was following me around the store. After I checked out and walked outside the woman was there with a security officer and the man said "Empty out your pockets" all loud. I was like "Excuse me?" The man was like "we called 911 and the cop's are on their way" So I started pulling out my pockets that contained only my cell phone, chap stick, D.L, and ATM card.     The woman thought she saw my son hand me stuff and I was putting it in my pockets. But she really saw me putting me phone in my pocket every time he fussed to get out of the cart and I knelt down to hug him while still pushing the cart.             I was so offended. They even checked to see if they had my son's pacifier in stock, in case I shop lifted that. Thank goodness they didn't carry Mams.|`|8ZEqAwJ7aa	This has happened a handful of times to me. However, what I find more interesting is when they charge you a way lower price for something that you know is wrong. Do you say anything? I had a cashier charge me $2 for some pictures that were $40. She didn't realize this, but I did. I was not going to say a word. Retailers screw us constantly, when they make their own mistakes it's their problem, not mine!|`|3dxwK9v3aa	My kids are constantly throwing items into the diaper bag when we shop, it sits in the cart and things get thrown into it. I have started checking the bag at the check out to make sure we aren't shoplifting anything out of there by accident! Opps! Not like Wal-Mart hasn't ever cheated me. Almost everytime I shop an item or two are rung up twice, never the cheap can of pineapple but the dishwasher tablets that cost $8!|`|nzY94B7waa	It never happened to me.  The only thing that happened is once I bought a bunch of cards and noticed the cashier didn't ring them all up.|`|KK3RkRjxaa	Many people go back in the store and pay for whatever it is they have "forgotten" to pay for.|`|3K7ffKn2aa	honestly i did that before i got pregnant lol. I would have something in my hands and get side tracked by something else and not realize i just stuck something in my pocket. My friends would always have to remind me to get things i would use out of my pocket(nothing big maybe a pen, or something like that). They knew i wouldn't do it on purpose. I guess just check your stuff before you leave next time and  don't beat yourself up about it.|`|9EW08emXaa	After waiting in what seemed like an especially long line, and hungry kids, I realized, at the car, that the girl never scanned the pumpkins on the bottom of the cart. I checked my receipt, and sure enough, they weren't there. I was so frustrated.  While I should have remembered to tell her to ring them up, I was grumpy that she didn't check the bottom, since that's sort of part of her job.     Anyway, I left them on the bottom of the cart and stuck it in the cart return.  I had to go pick up kids at school and didn't have time to go back in that crazy place. If someone else decided to take them, oh well.|`|prqrQcd1aa	Let me tell you about my experience with wal mart. My 3 year old daughter got something and put it beside her with out me knowing about it, it was a small can of nuts. I noticed it as soon as i got outside and was about to go back in to pay for it and was stopped by someone telling me that i had shoplifted something. They asked me to come back inside and talk to them in an office. I explained to them that i knew nothing about my child getting the nuts. I said i was on my way back in to pay for it, or else say sorry. They luckily believed me, and told me to keep my child further away from the shelves next time. They also told me that if i had not of said all this and had they not have believed me i would have paid a "civil fine" to them of $150 and they would not have pressed charges, but i would have been kicked out of wal mart for ever!  I was so embarrassed and pissed off it wasn't even funny. Now i check the cart twice before even leaving the register. I still can't believe that wal mart does this, they must have a lot of shoplifters that they don't press charges against that pay this "civil fine"... I wonder if they report it on their taxes??!!|`|ZadTQtJaaa	I accidentally shop lifted... then walked out the door at Wal-Mart the greeter asked to see my receipt... I said "ok, here you go" then she proceeded to say "Mam, those items on the bottom of your cart have not been paid for, please wait right here."  She went and got the manager and I apologized profusely.  I didn't do it on purpose, and was SO embarrassed.|`|GnXfEdegaa	I did a couple times like you did (had it under something in the top part of the cart) covered up. It was accidentally done and I went back in the store the times it happened and went to customer service and pd for it.  It was a pain, but I sure felt better for it.|`|90zcKChJaa	It's happended to me too. While unloading the stroller from a trip to the mall I found that my daughter had stolen a beanie baby. At Target we accidentally took a little toy she was playing with and set by/under her coat.    It happens to all of us at one point. I have walked back into stores and returned items that I didn't realize my daughter had when we walked out. I make sure that she knows that we have to pay for everything. ;)|`|hl5WdXnbaa	it happened to me when my son was about 8 months old. We were in walmart and he was getting fussy. I walked by a display of these vibrating back  things. I knew he loved mine at home so I gave it too him to hold. And it did calm him down. Of course, me not thinking walked out the door with it....my son still holding it in his stroller.  I returned it right away.    I use to be an uniformed store detective at walmart. Sad thing is there are so many parents who will knowingly use their kids to steal. So if anyone gets stopped and wonder why they are so hard on you...because it is common for parents to hide things within the baby stroller. More common than the teenage girl stealing make up or the young guy stealing CD's or DVD's.  People will actually use other peoples kids ( ones they baby sit or relatives)  so they can use the stroller to hide things. It can be hard to tell who made on oops and who did it on purpose. You really do not know until you stop the person and see how the act. Innocent people will be shocked and embarrassed.  The 150 $ fine is used to of set the cost walmart pays for security and what it loses to shoplifters so they do not have to pass all the cost on to their customers.|`|VwMkiLFPaa	You know those big bus shopping carts they have in stores? My son always wants to drive it. (The turning radius on those things STINKS) Well there is limited room for groceries in there because the stupid bus is so big. So sometimes I end up putting things in the actual bus part where my son will sit.     Ive never actually walked out but I have come VERY close before. And I always felt guilty because I dont want the cashiers or bag people to think Im TRYING to walk out with things.     There have also been times I brought no shopping cart and threw things in my stroller when my son was smaller. And with diaper bags, no shopping cart, baby stuff all over, its very easy to forget that wasnt yours and it was the new stuff you were buying.     Mistakes happen..now if youre walking out with a high definition TV, well then, youre on your own! LOL!|`|TQW5E6olaa	Just last weekend! I was at Target with a friend and we were gabbing the whole time, even through check out, well, I didn't notice till we got outside that my daughter had 3 items from the $ section, so we went back in and waited in line again...    And i've done it at Costco with a book|`|537fb036f0d7f523891b1281ae7d57d1aa	yeah, at ikea, I had brought bags back in to re-use, and forgotten I had put in some $2 chip clips.  I ended up getting a larger item on a flat bed, and forgot about the small one.  Although when I got out I realized it, and instead just put them back in the store versus standing in the checkout again.  Sad thing was, i didnt even have the kids.    I have since bought them, and its a wonderful thing to always find a chip clip when you need them.|`|hKJIDdVqaa	I have one better, I had an infant and was pregnant with another. Tired with  infant in tow I went to grocery shop at walmart.  Bought all the groceries, paid with the check book, walked outside, put the baby in the car and left. I got home and my husband asked where the groceries were???  :0  I forget them in the cart in the parking lot, and the check book on the counter in walmart.  So i "un shop lifted"|`|SnQvsOPwaa	Happened to me once. I took my daughter and the item back in and paid for it.|`|bYhqPOtwaa	Yep, it happens. A time or two a jar of baby food rolled back behind the car seat and I didn't notice until I was loading everything in the car.|`|eeGN977eaa	You are not the only one. Last summer I was at Walmart with my three children who were all crabby and fighting. I got through the checkout line as quickly as possible so we could just get the heck out of there. After we were in the parking lot I realized I forgot to pay for a gallon of paint that was on the bottom of the cart. I considered going back in but decided against it because I just simply couldn't go through the stress again!|`|AkFag8tNaa	Yes. A pack of hair ties fell between the seat and the cart.....I was too flustered from children and the hour long errand that I didn't return them. I would if it happened again though.|`|xxDjV6Axaa	Once, my 3 year old put a lipstick in the zippered pocket of her stuffed bear.  We marched right back to the store and she apologized.  I don't think she even knew what it was.  It was shiny gold and she liked that.  But that was the only time.|`|Am1wfhBDaa	Lol! I dropped expensive make up things in my Ex Wife's purse so when she went through the doors at Walmart she was arrested for shoplifting. God it was hilarious to watch her red faced and wide eyed while the Cops walked her to the police car. ROFLMAO. And to talk about poetic justice, I was to meet her at the Walmart Diner to give her the final settlement check in our divorce. The B***h got what she had coming.|`|Ya2j2ENaaa	My daughter is 18 months and we've come very close a few times.  The one time it did happen was with a flat of water under the cart that they didn't check because my daughter was entertaining the cashier and bagger...I felt bad, but frankly they've over charged me enough times that I think a flat of water about covers it and it IS part of their job to look.|`|A7SJT50Kaa	bad, bad mommy!    J/K    it happens. it's not like you were intentionally stealing a $50.00 pair of jeans!    yes, i have done the same on occasion. i used to use my stroller to go grocery shopping. i remember once, i was shopping and i forgot that i picked up a couple pairs of socks. i found them a few days later folded up in the basket of my stroller...what should i have done, gone back to the store and said "excuse me, i stole these a few days a go, i'd like to return them now"?    EDIT: i forgot this one: i actually almost stole a whole cart full of groceries. $150.00 worth of food! i went through the checkout, talked with the cashier and bagging person (we of course were all gushing over how adorable Bella is ;-) LOL)  i took out my debit card, but put it back in my wallet while gabbing away b/c i thought i had payed. they packed everything in the cart and i left and packed the car up. so the car is all packed up and i'm about to drive away, when the bagging person chases after me:  "Ma'am! Ma'am! Maaaa'am!!!"     I look around and realize she's talking to me..."Did I forget something?" (Thinking I forgot my wallet)    Bagging lady says "Yea! you forgot to pay!"    Thankfully, everyone had a good laugh! (It was a small town that I graduated highschool from. I was back visiting friends)
e4ec8a26064d1b408b4d493f2b6d5d8baa	Probably the length of your cervix. I know when your pregnant it shouldn't be under 4 cm unless your almost full term and ready to deliver or it rises a concern about preterm labor or miscarriage.|`|Ev9UpLNvaa	I believe it means how far down your cervix is or maybe how close baby's head is to your cervix if baby is head down??|`|Mib1Jq9Gaa	How far along are you? Sounds like the size of the baby.|`|d6df9c3bab13d4a609d4641b785de6b0aa	Before labor, the cervix is usually high and posterior, meaning it points toward your back. And is normally about 3 inches long. As you get closer to labor, your cervix begins to move lower and forward into an anterior position. (meaning it gets shorter) This can happen a few weeks before, a few days before, and perhaps even during the early part of labor. So the 2 cm long more than likely meant that your cervix is still 2 cm long. <br>  <br>  I am sure that the 1 cm meant that you are 1 cm dialated. This too can happen weeks or days before labor.|`|b07c5ab23b5694bf2e87027fecc000efaa	I think it just means your cervix is still 2 cm long.  When it's completely gone and you are fully dilated, that's when the fun begins :D

I have heard there is a back log so I'm expecting up to a six week wait, possibly more.  Don't expect anything to soon from the Government, they drag every thing out with regards to money.  I had to go on to Income Support because they warned me of the long wait for Maternity Allowance so I had some money coming in but I have been waiting 4 weeks for them to process that claim so I haven't had a single penny in four weeks!  Could only send my Maternity Allowance form off Monday 26th as my Midwife was on holiday at my 28 week appoinment so I had to wait for my next monthly appointment at 32 weeks for my Mat B1 form as my Doctors only had an appointment for 4 weeks time and wouldnt let my have one just to get the Mat B1 form! Good luck with your wait.|`|cjd29FNnaa	Hi good luck and be patient; I applied beginning of November and got my money 2 weeks ago!  I was told the back log was due to Xmas!  I would suggest you call them once a week to see how they are progressing, especially if it is your only income.
P544Sbmqaa	The marrow program handles cord blood donation.  If you are in the US you can find out how at <a href="http://www.marrow.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.marrow.org</a> .  If you are in a different country, you can search for your country's marrow program or call the US registry for info in your country.<br>  <br>  It is free to donate, but you will probably have to do some leg work...   You have to sign up for it by a certain time and they follow many of the same medical requirements for donating marrow and you have to make sure your birthing place is set up to do the donation.<br>  <br>  Donating is a good thing.  I am here today because of cord blood that was donated to the public bank =>.  (I needed a bone marrow transplant but had no matching donors in the registry.  The same type of cells that make the transplant work are also in cord blood, and my transplant used cord blood).|`|wkd5CMNaaa	Google Cord Blood Donation. <br>  You will find lots of good info.  If the hospital you plan to deliver as is affiliated with a donation program, then you just need to fill out paperwork.  If not, you can still donate, but you will have to pay to have it properly transported to the donation center.|`|532XA7lkaa	My hospital was set up with a company that accepted it and all I did was tell me doc.  There is a kit the hospital must get.  The only thing they do is when you go in to have the baby, they take an extra vial of blood....which they take blood anyway...so it's not another prick...they are already in there!  I donated my son's and he is almost 4....well I got a call last year when he was 3 from the place I donated it to telling me that they were able to successfully use it and he helped save a life!  What an awesome phone call it was!!!!  I am pregnant now, 15 week, and doing it again this time around.|`|AA11327039	To donate the cord blood you need to call ahead and have a kit delivered to the hospital.  Call the hospital you plan to deliver they SHOULD be able to help you, if not call one of the donation registries, they might be able to help as well.<br>  <br>  The good news about donating, is if you should ever need it, there could be a slight chance it's still hanging around and you'll be able to use your own cord blood.
SxPhldhhaa	Elfrida, while a cute name, doesn't seem to age very well to me. I can see it on an elderly lady, and perhaps a young child, but I can't quite picture a teenager or an adult with that name. It seems a little silly, like a fairy tale character, to suit a teenager or an adult. I do, however, like how it's not very popular, and Ellie and Ella are both very cute nicknames that oculd be used for the name.<br>  <br>  Lydia would have to be my pick over Elfrida, though. Lydia's just one of my absolute favorite names, because it sounds strong and bold, yet still beautiful and sweet at the same time. I can easily picture a girl named Lydia for all age groups, and it's just such a pretty name. It's actually one of my favorite names at the moment, and I would consider it if I were to have children (although I won't be having any for a while). I know a little girl named Lydia and she's very sweet and pretty, so that might also contribute a tad to my liking of the name.|`|3AfQ9UXYaa	I love Elfrida because of the meaning and the sound is growing on me.

Would you shave your head if a family member asked you to because they had cancer?<br>  A. I'm not really sure.  I'd like to say I would, but I really wouldn't know what to do unless I was put in that position.<br>  <br>  Q. What would you do if the doctor told you that you were pregnant?<br>  A. Oh my God, I'd flip out.<br>  <br>  Q. Did the one person who hurt you the most in your life apologize?<br>  A. He didn't know he was hurting me and it really wasn't his fault.  In order for him to stop, he would've had to give up something that wouldn't be fair for me to ask him to give up.  We're good now, though.  He's my best friend.<br>  <br>  Q. Are you good at hiding your feelings?<br>  A. Yes.<br>  <br>  Q. Are you wasting your time on someone?<br>  A. Yes, I am. :/  It's very frustrating.<br>  <br>  Q. Last thing that made you cry:<br>  A. My dog dying.  -sniffles-<br>  <br>  Q. Do you have a bad temper?<br>  A. Not really.  <br>  <br>  Q. Do you think you'll be married in 10 years?<br>  A. I...don't know.  I'm on the fence about marriage.  I don't see the point in getting married if there's a 50% chance that I'm going to get divorced. :P<br>  <br>  Q. How many funerals have you been to in your lifetime?<br>  A. My aunt's, my grandfathers and my great uncle's.  <br>  <br>  Q. How often do you think about suicide?<br>  A. Just about suicide in general or about commiting suicide?  I would never commit suicide, even though life can be tough I have a feeling that it can always get better.  Plus I have my friends that are absolutely wonderful and will always help me and make me feel better.  About suicide in general...there was recently a kid in my school district who killed himself, so I've thought about that a little.  <br>  <br>  Q. What is your deepest fear?<br>  A. Losing my friends and family.<br>  <br>  Q. Do you REALLY love all your family?<br>  A. I suppose so.<br>  <br>  Q. What do you want to believe in?<br>  A. I honestly don't know.<br>  <br>  Q. Do you have a secret crush on someone?<br>  A. I do. :]<br>  <br>  Q. Are you proud of who you are?<br>  A. Yes I am.<br>  <br>  Q. Do you feel alone even in crowded rooms?<br>  A. It depends on who's in the room.  If it's with my friends, no, of course not.  If it's with people I don't know, then yes.<br>  <br>  Q. What is the worst thing a person could do to you and still be forgiven?<br>  A. Blowing me off when they're supposed to meet me somewhere.<br>  <br>  Q. You're dying in 10 seconds, what are your last words to your best friend?<br>  A. I love you, I'll miss you and I'm sorry.<br>  <br>  Q. ...to your worst enemy?<br>  A. I hate you.<br>  <br>  Q. Do you care if people hate you?<br>  A. It depends on who the person is.  If it's someone I don't really know, then no.  But if it's someone I was friends with suddenly started hating me, I'd have a problem.<br>  <br>  Q. Freedom or safety?<br>  A. I do like being free, but I also enjoy being safe.  I suppose safety.<br>  <br>  Q. Think of a random person, and give them a message here, no names:<br>  A. You mean so much to me and I don't think you even know it.  Thank you for being there for me.<br>  <br>  Q. Has a song ever made you cry?<br>  A. Several songs have made me cry.<br>  <br>  Q. A book ever made you cry?<br>  A. I think it was page 661 in the 7th Harry Potter book.  That was the page where I found out Tonks and Lupin died and it was like 1am and I was, like, sobbing, haha.<br>  <br>  Q. Is the world crumbling to pieces?<br>  A. I'd like to believe it's not, but it probably is.<br>  <br>  Q. Name on moment where you couldn't control your rage:<br>  A. There haven't been any times where I've just completely lost it.  I would if someone hurt my friends, though.  I would flip.  Honestly.  Beyond belief, it would be scary.<br>  <br>  Q. Name one moment where you sincerely wanted to just die:<br>  A. When my aunt died.<br>  <br>  Q. For the last one, just say anything you want, anything at all:<br>  A. Thank you very much for this survey.  It made me think, haha.|`|IcxoK6j4aa	Would you shave your head if a family member asked you to because they had cancer?

The dip is probably safe, too, unless the label specifically gives a warning about the eggs being raw.  Most companies don't produce food with raw eggs or unpasteurized dairy, because they don't want the liability if someone gets sick.<br>  <br>  The chips are fine.  Just take it easy, those things are addictive!|`|Bhy4k9wPaa	Not many dips have raw egg in anymore, you'd be better to check first as it may very well be fine for you. And of course crisps are okay to eat!|`|4fdeb5e83b0e4e59d0ce45d49190dc78aa	Of course it's fine!  I have got no idea why you would think that a dip sold in a supermarket would contain raw egg.  Even if it did all eggs nowadays are pasteurised before they are even on sale so there is no risk of salmonella from eggs.<br>  <br>  The reason pregnant women are told to avoid certain foods are not that it would harm the baby directly but that you might get sick and therefore affect the baby indirectly.  The only exception to this is alcohol as it is absorbed into the blood and offal / liver / foods high in Vitamin A.<br>  <br>  The reason they tell you not to eat shellfish / soft cheeses etc. is in case you get ill from listeria etc. even though it's almost unheard of nowadays from fresh food and no such restriction exists for pregnant women in France.<br>  <br>  Eat sensibly, eat what you normally eat and don't stress.|`|qayCggxMaa	Try not to worry so much.  The pringles will be fine.  Actually, most foods they tell you not to eat when pregnant won't actually harm your baby - it's mostly a precaution so you don't end up sick while pregnant.  The only obvious exception I can think of to this is eating too much of the kind of fish that are prone to mercury contamination because mercury can hurt the baby.  <br>  <br>  Edit:  Ok, listeria from undercooked meats is bad too and a couple other things...  But really, chances are small of contracting anything anyway.  Worry less, enjoy pregnancy more.|`|kaqPSgTVaa	Why would it be bad for you? Eat them...|`|zSABr7praa	There's not raw eggs in either.. you're safe.|`|aWL7mkbMaa	Chips and some kind of dips are probably ok.  The problem with raw stuff is that it can have Salmonella or other bacteria that your body can fights normally but when you are pregnant your immune system is not as strong so is more vulnerable.  Some bacteria can cause birth defects or miscarriage.  You should not eat raw eggs, sushi, soft cheese, cold deli meat or things like that.<br>  <br>  You should also avoid, caffeine, alcohol, cigarettes or any type of drugs but probably you already know that.  Tortilla chips with melted cheese is great for you and taste great.|`|13561ef688d651ebae907f5ff2f7fc41aa	It is not advisable to eat soft cheeses or similar during pregnancy. It is nothing to do with Salmonella..it is the risk of Listeria from all soft and blue veined cheeses, which can be serious if transmitted to th unborn baby. Didn't realise there were so many ignorant people out there. Look at the NHS website all of you|`|lSiv5PDlaa	ITS DRY MIX ON THE CHIPS, DOUBTABLY THERES EGGS GO FOR IT! STEER CLEAR OF THE DIP IF ITS RAW OR UNDERCOOKED (EGGS, MEAT,ETC) ITS A NO-NO!<br>  ITS GOOD TO BE PRECAUTIONARY BUT DONT DRIVE YOURSELF NUTS...GOOD LUCK!<br>  IF YOU HAVE FURTHER DOUBTS ASK THE OB OR W/E|`|wkd5CMNaaa	Yes you can eat any kind of chips you want.|`|MTxZRhiraa	yeshh as long as its not cigarettes or alcohol|`|0fe4f3702c5dd1a403524194d3e9fabdaa	Yep they are perfectly fine so eat up! :)|`|3Rr5SAhhaa	There is nothing wrong with eating them|`|q4ppgGe1aa	They're just fine!! Enjoy! :)<br>  <br>  Darn, now I wish I had some, lol...|`|FuvMTGXzaa	Don't worry about all the things you can't eat the only thing i haven't ate during my pregnancy is whippy ice cream. Just eat them lol they're yummy!!!|`|NhTN2KFNaa	Seriously?? try eating some fruit. that will be better for your baby! Put down the junk food! geeze people|`|fc6ea8b86526b74940932c4e482c4842aa	the chips are still baked, eat them!|`|cnK4X2sZaa	eat

It is so sweet!!!<br>  <br>  Noelani is such a beautiful name and i love it when the first and middle names do not have te same amount of syllabals...it has a better ring to it.<br>  <br>  Lani is such a cute nickname for her too!|`|RMppfinbaa	Love it!

4YfehneDaa	You can ovulate at any time during your cycle including during your period, so you probably just can't accurately get your due date from LMP.  It was probably just one of those freak things, maybe due to being on and off the pill.  Im not quite sure why you are worried about it now, you know pretty sure when your due date is going to be.|`|oqUlYXqtaa	that's very strange because usually LMP is more accurate!! are you sure you ovulate around that time?<br>  i'm not sure of the correct answer but you can ask fertility specialists online for free and find others going through similar situations, try fertilityties.com<br>  good luck!
ce8COixxaa	I know so many people having baby girls! We are TTC now and every time I hear of someone else having a girl I feel like my chances are lessened! LOL I know that's not how it works! Honestly I know of 2 baby boys and about 20 baby girls either recently born or on the way. It's nice to hear someone else noticing the same thing!|`|75c742d5acd622a0bb5f444e18bb5853aa	I am pregnant and so are 4 of my friends.

Me and 2 of girlfriends are having girls, and 3 more girlfriends of mine are having boys. <br>  <br>  Dead even in my group.|`|3hUR2SQ9aa	I just had a girl in November, a friend of mine is having a girl in April.|`|XzbRZCPUaa	i always noticed girls are born more,  i am having a boy and i am sooo happy !! we have all girls in my family|`|wkd5CMNaaa	Everyone I know is having a boy.|`|SJ9lOnCOaa	for me its boys. everyone, including myself is having a boy|`|CYwha8Baaa	CRAZY but here in missouri there are ALOT OF BOY<br>  <br>  I am 6 months prego with a girl myself due june 1st<br>  <br>  but I know about 13 people that are all having BOYS|`|eMCCQD8Faa	yea the girl era is over I had a girl now all my cousins are having boys|`|zwctZ812aa	Maybe this will be the girl year!!

Anyway, I had a boy last year :-) but I have several friends having girls this year...weird! lol|`|NPmRmnG6aa	I am the only one I know who is having a girl. All my friends are having boys.

Apparently male organs can't develop properly due to the estrogen.  Don't know if this is true or not.|`|09061e5674207e8f8a877ca8a18d54f5aa	Well i really dont know what im having....Hubby and I decided to wait til the baby is born BUT i am going for a girl and everyone i know keeps telling me cause of the way im carrying the baby its gonna be a boy:( than again the people who tell me im having a boy..theyve never had kids lol|`|55IMnlcwaa	I am due with my 3rd girl in June.

iuWfp2fEaa	I would send him to the best school available, regardless of whether it has a sports program or not.|`|df56ca79f426d12c4a6737af42e04037aa	unless your son is on a track to get sports scholarship for college, keep him out of sports.  fathers who have played sports don't understand it as much, but his education comes first.  in high school he can pick up on school sports.  another solution is to get him a tutor.  places like sylvan learning center are good and my brother did very well.  good luck|`|FlSCb3dxaa	Well, if his grades are not good the schools will not let him play sports..    I would never, ever do that to my seven year old son.  I think that is messed up and i totally agree with your ex on this one.    By the time he enters Jr. High, he will probably suck at sports (or not be nearly as good as the other kids playing) because you delayed him.  You really need to start them out young for that.    He is a boy for God's sake.....|`|Hzf3QK9faa	As a parent my understanding is that we are to note our children's strengths and interests and help them build on them. I apologize, dear friend, but I am with your son's father on this one. Some kids are not academic and don't learn well the way information is "taught" to them in mainstream schools. I, for one am more of a visual and tactile learner than a old lecture style learner, although I managed very good marks because I took courses that held my interest.|`|aEmdURPTaa	Activity is essential for children.  Not only for the physical benefits, but also for brain fitness.  You can't really expect your child to be able to concentrate as much on his academics if he's not allowed to do sports in the same time.      Besides, as much as it is important to have good grades, he's still young.  He needs to enjoy life too!    Like others mentioned, schools with sports program are not just about having fun either.  Kids need to have good grades, otherwise no sports.      I'd say that your 11-old child needs to go to a school with sports program.  It's the best thing for him, both physically and mentally, and also considering that it's what he likes.|`|FERfSYtzaa	i agree with your ex beacause it's not fair for him .i  mean come on he is a teenage boy he has to play something if you continue to tie him down you will loose him before you know it. sportsa is a way of expressing how they feel and secondly his wouldn't be day dreaming if he knew what he is dreaming of ould be a reality.|`|jojKjhUcaa	My oldest son is graduating college this summer, played basketball all 3 years, and may play after college, but he has never been left off the deans list graduating a year early, attended public high school and play 3 sports, since he was 10, 25 out of a class of 900 in 2006. My youngest is nearly the same great student gifted athlete, will be a freshman this summer at my alma mater The Jackson State University,  So let your son grow and develope sports are important to most young men esp. if they are naturally gifted, go to practice and watch him, then help him with his homework later there is a balance.|`|GRyFxwTbaa	You're ex is right.|`|9DpbUdKcaa	I agree he should focus on education but I think you should use it as a reward for good grades.  If you withhold sports through middle school he will be behind the other kids play level.|`|AA11370204	I will have to agree with your EX on this one. For example, Sports instills Discipline in your son and would make him a better student. Also the school has the final say on whether  he plays sports or not in case his grades fall below a certain threshold!|`|UTjWlj9Yaa	You're basically stunting his growth mentally and physically. If he wants to play sports, let him and take him out if his grades aren't up to par. By using sports as an incentive, he is more likely to actually concentrate on his school work. This I know from personal experience from both myself, as well as my brother.|`|ZSSUfSXwaa	You know it's very common for your son's age to be daydreaming about football plays rather than study, though it doesnt make it right. He does need to focus on his studies, but sending him to a school that has no sports would make a difference on him?? Or he would resent you for that, and be unhappy AND still daydream about football plays??    Usually schools that have a lot of competitive sports regulate the kids' grades. If they dont get good grades they cant play etc etc. Besides playing a sport seriously is quite healthy for a kid. If he's serious about the sport that would mean that on days he has games or he has to practice he'll have to get up early, and be disciplined about it. No late nights partying etc.   I used to teach Middle and high School and the kids who were involved in sports were the healthiest of kids. They were the most disciplined ones.   I think your son's father has a good point, he's not just blocking your idea just because.   And yes, if his grades are still not good, you can always ground him with not going to practice or something like that, and that would hurt him a lot, really, rather than something else.    EDIT:* I didn realize that Y! had cut me off before I finished .|`|eCZ6YW4Paa	Your ex has no realistic reason for not supporting your decision. The chances of your son doing anything real with sports is very minimal so unless you want the high light of his life to be high school get him working on school and not sports.     Tell your ex to quit trying to live through his kid.|`|mggll8dRaa	I would let Him play Sports, He has to Maintain Good Grades to keep playing (I did it,it is a great incentive).....!!|`|ySKK7lCyaa	If he goes to a school with sports then the school regulates his grades if he don't have good enough grades then  he can;t play.     But i would talk to your ex and your son about your concerns and talk this thing out.|`|eabe4c3a6e53ede1a2078c8d7dfcf4b7aa	Kids have to make certain grades to even play in sports programs...so don't worry about it. Talk to him and tell him it's wonderful he loves sports so much but his education comes first and once he proves he can get good grades THEN he can join in with sports. Make him work for it first and prove to you he can get good grades before letting him play sports.|`|PExOJJLgaa	If he goes to a school with a sports program, you can demand he have good grades to balance it out.  Besides, if the sports thing works out, so many possibilities are available in the future: scholorships, etc.    I agree with your husband.  Besides, you can always pull him out of sports if the grades are falling and/or he doesn't like it.    it's just more motivation to do good.|`|FZQ2KHDvaa	I agree with you AND, your ex.    I agree with your wanting your son to focus on his grades.    I also agree with your ex, in that, your son needs physical exercise.    The daydreaming needs to be nipped in the bud.    Make a deal with your son, he can play sports.  BUT ONLY, if he gets good grades.  If his grades start to slip, stop sports altogether.
H0fXySX9aa	hun i wanted a boy and got 2 girls when the second was born all i could of think of was is she ok does she have all fingers and toes|`|FjGeKhY0aa	Once you hold your baby (girl or boy) in your arms, I really don't think that you'll feel disappointed, it is your baby! You don't have to play a dress up or do a make up with her, just teach her stuff that you like, even if they are boy's activities. Nothing is wrong with that.|`|ad9efc98eb0fbeeae6b6c4abfd63046caa	when you see the baby when its born no matter what it is boy or girl you will love it|`|imIiuaAAaa	lol well I imagine that when you hold your little miracle for the first time, whatever the sex is isn't going to matter. But there's nothing wrong with wanting one over the other...it's just a matter of not trying to turn your child into the opposite gender if it wasn't what you wanted ;]|`|AA11100890	My sister in law was the same way.  They both wanted a boy, but had a girl. It won't matter once the baby is here or you are pregnant and get used to the idea that it one gender or another.  Maybe if it is a girl she will be more of a tomboy and like more of the things you like.  <br>  My new little niece will probably have to hunting with her dad unless she gets some little brothers someday.|`|rlMbcfpXaa	I know exactly what you mean. I just KNEW I wanted a girl so bad and that is what I thought we would have. I could never picture myself with a little boy and I had even bought some little girl clothes. When I found out it was a boy, I was so disappointed. AND, I felt so guilty for feeling like that.  I am now 32 weeks and am glad that we are having a healthy boy.  I think its normal to feel the way that you do.|`|gWiZAsfBaa	I wanted a girl, I had a boy instead. At first I was disappointed, but when I saw my son for the first time, I didn't care at all that he was a boy and not a girl. Of course there are times when I go to the store and I look enviously upon all the cute baby girl outfits, but I still love my son.|`|1pbWoSZ2aa	you will lose all these fears when your baby is born, besides if it is a girl and she is growing up around you, there's a strong chance she will be into all the same things as her mummy! whatever your baby is you will love it. your maternal instincts will just kick you up the backside! gl ttc x|`|EUTRJqCsaa	you won't be upset. I promise.<br>  <br>  I ALWAYS pictured myself with a girl...so when I find out I was having a boy I was a little upset at first. but now he's almost 7 weeks old and I CAN'T imagine having a girl. wouldn't trade him for anything =).
D35xKICoaa	sound like it to me.good luck(****)|`|4DoXomHZaa	Sounds like your period is coming.    Most likely you O'd around the 20th but of course no one knows that. You can buy Ovulation Tests at Walmart.    Implant bleeding happens to a very small percentage of women, tho all TTCers hope it's them. It happens 5-12 days after ovulation, normally 7-10.    Shooting pains are not typical with implantation. Most ladies feel nothing and most have no bleeding.    Good luck
CuCrGDuRaa	I would do them at 32 weeks or so.  That way you can have a pretty good idea how big your tummy got later on when you look back on them.   I love pregnancy pictures!|`|znjl6WrWaa	I think you should wait until you're at least 30 weeks. I think they look so much cuter when you have a bigger belly.|`|nEgIBjOZaa	If you want your cute little preggo belly I suggest taking em before your to big where your uncomfortable for it.  So maybe 30 weeks, just a suggestion.|`|KZMezu7oaa	I would say that 28-30 weeks would be the best time. You will be bigger by that time and almost near your delivery size. Preggo pics are cute!|`|f2MmEMg5aa	when you know that bub is healthy and you are apparently showing then you should take a preggo pic! :)|`|cYRZpGkqaa	I waited until I was 36 weeks so it would be accurate of my size. But if you're going bare belly for them I would suggest a little earlier. As cute as the pictures are, in that last month our naked bellies aren't that beautiful. I love those pictures!
SUT3yL0oaa	I'm 29 weeks and at my last appointment (26 weeks 4 days) was told to start coming every 2 and a half weeks. At 32 weeks it'll go to 2 weeks and then at 36 weeks every week.|`|vygYFdsSaa	I'm 14 weeks and I've had very frequent prenatal appointments so far just because in the beginning I was very small and getting sick frequently.

J6IOqzL0aa	Im so sorry about what happened. There really are not any words to say i just hope you are in a better situation now.  Not having your period regularly is quite normal especially if you are breastfeeding it can take a very long time for your periods to return to normal. However the pain is not a good sign. It is possible you have an infection especially as you had sex (although not with consent)before the recommended 6 weeks.  You also might have some stitches still in there. i know they are meant to use disolving ones but with my mum they didnt and they did not tell her and she went to the doctors because she was uncomfy and she still has stitches in her.  Is there anyway you can get to the doctors earlier than march? I suggest waching the area in warm salty water to keep it clean until you can get there.|`|qZml9VRmaa	OMG im so sorry this happen to you... Please go to a hospital and get this checkd out immediately... From there  you can file a report the police will come to you and if you are in fear of your life... your babys life is in the line too.... please get out of whatever situation ur in not just for you but for your baby too... good luck...|`|60a3bbdca78e74fb19db426e27b9a087aa	Who raped you repeatedly for 4 weeks? You need to seek medical and mental health care immediately.    Something is really amiss with this.|`|o2YHnKXiaa	Well I was raped when I was 18 years old and I hope this is a real question because rape is nothing to fool around about. But if you had your son 7 months ago and this happened months ago there isn't a lot they can do to be honest if you would have went within the first 3 days of being raped to a hospital they could have done a rape kit and caught who did this. You still need to go to a doctor and talk to them about what happened. Right when I went in two days later they gave me plan B to reduce the chance of me getting pregnant. This is an awful thing that happens to women and I am sorry you experienced this. If you are depressed or stressed out talk to a counselor to get through your pain and do everything in your power to get this person caught.|`|955YoHvVaa	You were raped for 4 weeks and didn't go to the doctors? You could have even gone to the ER- It probably hasn't healed right and the stitches were probably gone-but I am not a doctor so the best option you have is to get yourself checked out..|`|qYbFMRcUaa	GO TO THE DOC NOW!!|`|jXZeoPAwaa	ohhhhh dear hunni can you not get seen alot quicker than that??? i really feel for you honest i do i hope you are ok, can you not go to maternity at your local hospital and get seen|`|Y5NXQ0JPaa	How were you raped repeatedly? Why? Who? Well besides that you so need to get checked as soon as possible. Its only common sense. You need to get help!!|`|tht0DrHsaa	Yes it could be serious. You could have a very serious infection.  You need to go to the doctor and tell them what happened. They need to not only check you where you tore but they need to also check your uterus for infections.  Bless your heart you probably need to also talk to a counselor about what has happened to you.  I hope everything works out for you.  Hang in there and God Bless.|`|nEgIBjOZaa	I can tell you I tore too and you cant have sex til the stitches heal which takes about 5 weeks.  So yes if it openned back up the tears they could be infected or causing more problems to your uterus, call your doctor and tell him your situation they will more than likely work you in sooner.  Im so sorry that happened to you.  Good luck!|`|BUCwZYnzaa	im so sry. and im glad you  are out of that situtation. but yeah it could be serious id go asap. and good luck and God bless|`|4f3cauAmaa	I think you should get to the nearest hospital asap. you know your boy better than anyone,so if something is not feeling right then that is your body giving you signals that something is not right. please also find help to get you out of that situation,remember you are not alone.|`|vSLHaTFHaa	Go to the police and go to the doctor.|`|nAOlBmzDaa	what? do you know how to call 911?|`|AA10390690	sorry for your pain. you need to get checked up && most def. also see a counselor for this. i would def. not wait until march to go. i'd go asap! goodluck|`|K7usHFX0aa	Of course its serious! What the hell??|`|cYRZpGkqaa	You need to go to the doctor asap. And counseling probably wouldn't hurt either, because your son deserves the best mother, not some one who is hurting mentally and emotionally.|`|EHY3FnAmaa	go to the police and/or a hospital ASAP!|`|AA12057835	Raped repeatedly for 4 weeks straight?  Something is wrong with this picture.  Without knowing more details.....you should have called the police, went to the ER with your newborn right then, came home, changed the locks in your house and bolted the windows!|`|uhj76Fkpaa	of course this could be serious!!Go to a dr and don't wait till march!|`|WLvGFqAwaa	Go to the hospital, you've been raped, you need to report this and get yourself checked out. GO NOW|`|zpIrU1yCaa	The fact that your periods aren't regular could be because your hormones aren't back to normal or you are pregnant again.  If you didn't use contraception it is best to take a test.    The pain could be internal bruising or tearing from the rape.  Please phone your doctor and tell him/her that you require an urgent appointment, as you could be in danger of infection or worse.    I am so sorry to hear about the rape.  I would also suggest you talk to your doctor about counselling for such a horrific experience.    I wish you all the best x|`|f27ac1251735cd69b33683d739d56466aa	Honey, I am sorry that this happened to you.  Seems like the stitches may have thorn off.  I don't think it is serious but you still need to keep your doctor appointment.  Try not to fall in bad relationship next time. You got a child to think of now.
wKuQC4yTaa	As long as your not bleeding you should be fine. But if it gets bad to see a doctor to make sure. Some  Miscarriages you don't bleed right away.|`|rxjdovzyaa	Most likely it is round ligament pain -  your muscles and ligaments are stretching to accomodate the baby, and that can sometimes hurt.  Congrats on the baby!|`|plI0WOrUaa	I guess it depends on what kind of pain you are having.  I know that its normal to get some light cramping like you are going to get your period.  I got that for a long time. Its your uterus growing and expanding to accomodate the baby. Its also normal to have sharp pains on the sides of your belly, especially if you move quickly.  These sharp pains are your ligaments stretching to support your growing uterus.  If you are unsure, just go to your doctor to ease your mind.|`|UYnDxJWDaa	I had some cramping/shooting pains there around that time too.  They say that is just your ligaments stretching to prepare for preggo belly.  If there is no bleeding or anything you are probably OK.
63e053d915c8cfbfa781e590abd94ee2aa	Hey Bunny!  Try not to worry too much.  As the baby grows, so does the placenta and the uterus enlarges.  As long as your doctor monitors you closely (and you call if there's any spotting), you should avoid any problems.  <br>  I did not have this problem, but I did have an emergency c-section with my first child, and a planned one with my second.  If you do end up having a c-section, please ask the doctor/nurses for a belly band (binder).  You may even be able to get them to give you a spare (so you can clean one while using the other) before you leave the hospital ( OR you can always buy them at CVS).  I found it to be super helpful in my recovery the second time.  <br>  Also, my doctor has started using a technique that not many people have heard of: she uses a "walking" epidural for 48 hours post-op, and this helps manage the pain for the first few days.  This may or may not be available where you are at, but you could ask.  I'll gladly give you more details, but at this time, you really don't need them.  <br>  <br>  Relax and totally enjoy your pregnancy!!!! YEA!<br>  Have you felt the baby moving around yet?!<br>  That's so cool!|`|SJ9lOnCOaa	at my first u/s (19 weeks) they said the the placenta was way too close to my cervix and i had to make another u/s appt to see of it moved. I had my 2nd u/s appt at 29 weeks and everything was fine. the placenta had moved (thank goodness) so dont worry too much it usually moves!
1wJ6C0VJaa	the best way is to tell them  straight up. i just told my dad today and i am his first duaghter and i am going to school to be a mechanic.  i was scared becuase of the fact my dad would yell at me and not want me, but since i was straight up and front with him it was not as bad.  i is better then trying to hide.  the divorce has nothing to do with you and if they make it their problem then it is best if you all go to family counsoling.|`|tu7aqUoxaa	girl, get a life. first of all, you are too young to be having sex. You better tell the dad that you're pregnant to see if he'll help you.|`|ffAmoqFTaa	You've got issues, you got yourself into this and now you need to grow up and take responsibility.  Sit your parents down and tell them - they love you and will help you in any way that they can.  Talk to the father of the baby, he'll be mean but it's something that he did too and he needs to own up and take responsibility as well.  Talk to a counselor, just because your pregnant doesn't make suicide a reasonable option - it's taking the easy way out and you will hurt a lot of people!  Your body is going through lots of changes now and you need to take care of yourself - drugs and alcohol and smoking are a selfish thing to do, you aren't just looking out for yourself .. you have a baby who needs you to be healthy.|`|nSrour73aa	okk, girl im 18 years old I know what situation you are in.<br>   what I think yu should do is get a abortion. so you dont have to kill<br>  your sself over what you and your partner made a mistake on.<br>   If yu want to keep it you can or yu have some adopt.|`|Gkf2nS51aa	okay im sorry, this is going to sound like I'm a total ***** but if your going to kill yourself(and the baby) over this, then u have some serious problems and if what one person says on this makes u turn to drugs and alcohol and then kill yourself,, even more problems, just chill,,  you have to tell ur parents , if not, im pretty sure they will notice very soon, for the dad, try an e-mail or get a friend to tell him if he wont talk to you, and you have to explain it to your boyfriend now, i don't know what you should do with the baby, cause if u kill it(abortion) apparently it causes depression because you killed your own child, adoption is good, but when you get older you might miss the baby and you have to go through the whole six mouths of having a huge stomach and everyone will know, killing yourself,,okay,, you ******* 15! please,, at that age, you will want to kill yourself at least once a week, so chill out, teenagers are just like that.  i know this was kind of harsh, but i really think you need to hear it :P
EHQCkDaqaa	Miscarriages can happen from a variety of things.. And if you are healthy otherwise, I wouldn't worry about having another one. Sometimes they don't really know what happens to the baby, and a lot of times, its no fault of the mother. Usually what happens is something didn't form with the baby correctly, and so it will "abort itself" (for lack of a better word) because of the problem. You could have another miscarriage, but just follow the guidelines that your doctor gave you, and hope for the best. <br>  <br>  Good luck & congrats!|`|VS8mactUaa	The reasons are too many to think of, its an act of nature alot of the time, I had a miscarriage 3 months ago and yesterday I found out I was pregnant and today Im having all kinds of pains, But I wont give up hope, and neither should you, never let the fear of losing the baby stop you from enjoying your pregnancy, it is an amazing ride that I hope we get to fully see through. I wish you all the luck in the world.|`|OBn4a7rzaa	well, my first pregnancy was a miscarriage at 7 weeks. I hadnt had my first prenatal appt yet, and i started spotting, so i called them and they moved my appt up to that morning, when i went i had an u/s to see what was going on and there was no heart beat. The obgyn said that there was a defect in the embryo, and that was likely the reason for the miscarriage. Now i am in my second pregnancy and am currently 21 weeks. Sometimes when things just arent right, you have a miscarriage, the chances of you having a healthy baby now, is really good.|`|JRXpYW3Naa	Need more info. Was it an early miscarriage? Before 12 weeks? Most miscarriages happen before 12 weeks due to a problem in the egg or sperm. If thats the case, then you have a 83% of having a healthy baby. Almost 50% of women have miscarriages and never know because it happens before they miss a period. Its really nothing to be too concerned about in other pregnancies.<br>  (17% is about the same percent as for woen who have never had a miscarriage, I think its only like 4% more, than a woman with no history of miscarriages)<br>  (I'd say sorry for your loss, but I know that doesn't help, you just want the facts for a little reassurance)|`|uxmqgmCCaa	i too had a miscarriage and now ive had a beutiful little girl. i was so nervous but the doctors reassured me that the chances are high with your 1st pregnancy of miscarriage but dramatically decrease with your next pregnancy.Good luck and try not to stress.Miscarriage can happen for numerous reasons but always remember its not your fault.|`|SihmWU0Baa	miss carriages are just a normal natural way your body rejects a fertilized egg if something would happen to be wrong with it<br>  <br>  its nothing you did it just happend i had a miss carriage in may 2008 and i was pregnant agian in august 2008 and now my baby boy is due may 2009 ironic right..<br>  <br>  but there isnt a chance your miss carry but up to three mnths is when the body can reject and exspell it if anything would seem to be wrong|`|rg4lS9E9aa	sometimes they don't know why women misscarry.if you don't have any medical problems your chances of carrying full term are good. my daughter has had 6 miscarriages and no live births.she is a bad diabetic.
gJrHBtp1aa	It could be your cycle. I always break out with painful pimples around my period. I have just started using proactiv religiously. I do it once a day before I go to bed and I've already noticed an improvement only been doing it a week. Hopefully when my period comes I don't break out.|`|BUCwZYnzaa	you that is not true. the 'i cant get preggers while breastfeeding.'' it happened to me. well if you are having unprotected sex then there is a HUGE chance you could be preggers. but it could mean you might be getting your period
ZbJ0bx3Uaa	According to my ob/gyn I could go to the dentist, but my dentist wasn't comfortable working on me while being pregnant... so it's really just up to your doctors and your comfort level.    I had a hell of a time quitting. Some women got morning sickness that helped them, it sure would have helped. Hurting the baby through withdraws would only happen if you smoked more than a pack a day. Either way begin to cut back so when you do find the strength to quit it will be easier.     I had to change my routines. I stopped going to the gas stations that I bought them from, I actually used candy cigarettes in the car because that was the hardest place to be without a cigarette. I quit hanging out with people who smoked (which is hard, everyone I live with smokes). Before I was completely done, I told everyone I had quit so now I had to make it true. I knew that everyone would be disappointed with me if they caught me and I would feel ashamed. Remember that nicotine is easy to quit the habit is the hard part... find a replacement for the habit.      Good luck and Congratulations on your baby!!|`|0F8hauikaa	You should check with your obstetrician about the dentist but it should be fine as long as you don't have any x-rays or anesthesia. I would recommend that you try behavior modification for the smoking habit, which is where you make daily changes that help you quit gradually. It's true that cold turkey could cause you enough stress to possibly affect your unborn child.|`|Bw1h5xAcaa	You can definitely go to the dentist, just make sure you let them know you are pregnant.    As for smoking, if you were a heavy smoker, I would slowly taper down and wean yourself off smoking and not quit cold turkey, because yes, it can cause stress in a developing baby. If you didn't smoke a lot (less than half a pack per day, for example), quitting cold turkey is just fine.|`|t6OGh0Edaa	Going to the dentist is totally safe and encouraged at least by my doctor.  There are a lot of things that can hurt baby if not taken care of in your mouth like gum disease and infections of teeth if they get really bad so yeah stick with the dentist!  They know how to take care of pregnant people!  As far as quitting smoking can't help ya there! Sorry! Good luck! :)|`|3fcf101a2615a631d556e32ec980eae0aa	Yes, go to the dentist for your check ups and cleaning during pregnancy.  Perfectly safe and good for you.    Quitting is insanely hard, I know.  I went cold turkeywhen I found out I was pregnant, my doc said that was a good choice, and my baby is fine.  However, I know other doctors that will say cutting back is better.  The only thing that helped was getting past those first 3 days of withdrawl.  I still crave them daily (quit for 5 months now,) but that 72 hours was hell.    You must find what works for you to quit...there are tons of resources out there to help.  Talk to your doctor about options and check out some of the online quit support groups.  Good luck!|`|MkCTwE95aa	Yes you can go to the dentist let them know your pregnant and they probably wont do x-rays. I had x-rays done at the dentist before i knew i was pregnant but my midwife said it was fine especially since they use those covers over your body.   At this point it will not affect the baby to quit cold turkey and when i was reading up on smoking while pregnant there was nothing i read that said it would be better for anyone to smoke while pregnant no matter how far along or how much they smoked.   What helped me quit was thinking about my baby. I was 7 weeks when i found out and it was very unexpected so i was crying and stressed within the first 10 minutes of taking the test, i lit a smoke because thats just what i did when i was upset or stressed took a drag or two and had to throw it away because it just made me feel sick knowing that there was a precious little baby in there and what i was doing to it. And i havent looked back for the last 24 weeks (im now 31 weeks)   A few of my friends still smoke and there are certain days where i wish i could just have one ciggarette but i just think about my baby girl and any urge to smoke just goes away...i really hope you can quit for your baby and good luck from one smoker to another!!|`|DRb4Qlypaa	The baby wouldn't go through withdraws this early, that is not true. The best way to quit though, in order not to stress yourself out, is slowly.  And you can go to the dentist for general cleaning, just say you are pregnant so they will know not to do any x-rays.|`|Rsq1G60zaa	You may want to call your dentist.  Mine would only see me after the first trimester, and yes it was only for a cleaning.  Good luck on the NS, I know it can be extremely difficult!

0FXVTZf7aa	I believe people should pay for their own contraception and not burden the tax payers with it.  I agree with religious conservatives who want to challenge the youth to delay sexual activity for a while.  But I strongly disagree with their message that a condom is a provision for sin.  That message is a public health nightmare, so I send my Christian friends to the website below because it debunks the whole thing against premarital sex in the Bible.  That way they have no excuse not to support comprehensive sex education.|`|t0mb150gaa	Good for you!! You are one of the few teens out there who is showing self control and making responsible decisions. I agree with you about this whole parents giving there teens the safe sex speech...i mean that in itself is encouraging it. I think more parents just try to be there teens friends rather then there parents because it is easier. If more parents would take control of there teens and instill proper morals and values the teen pregnancy rate would drop! Your mom had obviously done a very good job with you and she should be proud!|`|LNnRSLdtaa	just becuase you EXPLAIN sex to someone doesnt mean they wont still want to have it <br>  <br>  and if you where a parent and your teen said (not in these words) they are going to have sex, nothing you say will change there minds<br>  <br>  would you rather they be safe while they do it<br>  or <br>  you tell them no and then they still do it behind your back with the posibility they didnt use protection?<br>  not many teens are going to take the idea of abstinence seriously. <br>  im 17 and a virgin <br>  im not saving myself for marriage<br>  and im not going to give it out to just any guy who says they love me|`|ghz5D5iLaa	If you are saving  yourself that is great. More should do it. Self control is very achievable. Good luck and I commend you for it. Abstinence only does not work. We have to educate you and make condoms available. We still don't want you to do it but we want you to be educated in case you do. You are in the minority and a lot of teens will have sex and a lot of them will have unprotected sex.|`|prqrQcd1aa	I agree with you. It is the responsibility of the parents to explain what sex is, and what can happen when you have sex, even sometimes when you use a condom. All aspects of sex should be discussed... All that being said, congratulations on saving yourself for marriage.|`|1k6UUC8qaa	Teen sex is a very complicated subject.  It isn't just about being pregnant its about not contracting any diseases.  It is also about wearing a condom because you can have a warehouse filled with condoms if you don't wear them guess what they don't work.  Its not only about sex that is an adult issue its about getting yourself involved in adult feelings and problems that you might not be ready to handle.  Sex can cause a lot of psychological problems if you he down the wrong path and you end feeling bad about what you are doing and if you get pregnant remember you are the one with the problem its in your skin no one elses.  I can go on its not as easy as buying and supplying condoms there are a lot of other things that come with it.|`|LwbwMFX9aa	just because you give them condoms doesn't mean they are smart enough to know how to put it on<br>  <br>  I'm proud of you for waiting, I wish I had but I can't turn back the clock.<br>  <br>  I have a little girl now, she's almost 4 yrs old. Im just going to explain to her that GOD gave her this most precious gift she can only give away once and that she is sooo loved and important to not to waste it<br>  <br>  wish someone had told me that, as far as that special gift|`|lY2XI8kUaa	you have a very good head on your shoulders. and you are right more parents should talk about sex and abstinence at home, that way they know their kids are getting the proper information. but sadly most parents are way too embarrassed to be talking about sex in front of their children.|`|PumDOQC9aa	Its good that u think like that only if all teenage thinks like that then parents shouldn't be worryed all the time about being young grand parents|`|SXS2Gf72aa	"My moms rule is if you live in my house you are going to make me a grandmother in it." ....so your mom wants you to have kids when you're still living with her?<br>  <br>  I don't know why people don't talk about it. I hate it that so many school are doing just the abstinence talk. Because.. if they don't know about STDs and condoms and stuff.. when they eventually are faced with the choice to do it.. and they choose to do it.. they'll be risking a lot.<br>  Parents now days are too lazy to talk about it at home, so it's left to the school and they do a pretty sh*tty job.|`|hNr3GFvlaa	I think the main question is not whether teens should be having sex or not but should young adults be allowed to decide what to do with their own lives.<br>  <br>  Teens are not property but citizens. You have decided to go with the religious dogma and that's satisfying for you. That is your choice and I wouldn't call it old fashioned by all means. Others, however,  may choose something else and that's their choice. <br>  <br>  Lives are custom and there's not one choice appropriate for everyone. Everyone gets to be right about what they need and want their own life to be, and experience the resulting actions and consequences.<br>  <br>  From what you wrote I am not 100% sure whether this is your choice and your mother's.
eDmdkUO3aa	Yep the nurses check you during actual labor too.

"in the beginning, my baby's dad and his father thought i was the biggest whore on the planet" now they want everything to do with this baby.. its FUNNY as hell lmao     Get away while you  have the chance.. and dont take his *** back. MAKE HIM PAY SUPPORT! you'll learn more about that :)    36 weeks and 4 days, 18 years old :)|`|0aVHTRAEaa	RUN dont walk away from him as fast as you can.  If he is physcially abusive to you as well as mentally, it will NEVER change.  He sounds likes an angry person and having a newborn in the house is stressful and the only way a baby communicates with you is through crying, when they are hungry,need to be changed, need to be cuddled, or just want to cry.....would he be able to handle it w/out being abusive toward the baby?  Ask yourself that.  I think you and that baby are in danger and you are a fool if you dont get away from him.|`|AKl3Twuuaa	I would get out of this situation as quickly as possible. There is no need to put up with abuse in life,  it can only get worse.   Go to your local pastor or  woman's abuse center  (here it  is called Woman's resource center.)  Do what ever it takes to make your life better for yourself and your unborn child.  Do NOT stay in this abusive situation.  You are worth more than that.   good luck                                             here is no need to put up with abuse in life.

Get a restraining order, there is no way a person should keep him around. It's dangerous for both u and the baby. I would try anything to get him away. :/ situations like this are always really scary. A baby should not have to grow up in an environment like that.    Hope this helps! :D|`|5bc21d2d2a57683cdbd5ef3c4094ebc4aa	I definately wouldn't be with the guy and i would get a restraining order against him.|`|pkdDEJd4aa	IS this a serious question? What else do you think? You freaking leave him already.|`|cj7sSPZEaa	Leave him, get a restraining order, press charges against him, find a safe place to live, and after the baby is born if he isn't in jail, get a paternity test done and take him to court for child support and get everything he has.|`|pqZAhBLvaa	I went through that, get out. I stayed too long, and it's not good for the kids. Don't settle.

Just to prove it to him.|`|3fcf101a2615a631d556e32ec980eae0aa	First, I would call the cops on his sorry *** the first time he laid a hand on me.    Then I would move as far away from the jerk as possible (maybe stay with family or friends?)    If you are asking for yourself...please leave.  There are domestic violence hotlines you can call (google for your area,) but no human being deserves that type of abuse.  ESPECIALLY when they are carrying a child.|`|QsIco3Fxaa	If you live in the US, you probably have those social workers, or you could report him to the nearest police station. Assumptions are never a good reason to physically hurt someone.    You don't deserve to be hurt, more now that you have a baby with you.     No one deserves to get hurt. Report him, or leave him.|`|i9M0U9Meaa	if he is getting physically abusive you dont need to be anywhere near him while your pregnant! he's not doing any good for you, so dont be with him, in the long run your only going to hurt yourself and your baby by being with him, leave, now. get a restraining order and just take care of yourself and your baby. thats what is important now.|`|aEmdURPTaa	How far along are you in your pregnancy?  Maybe you should just tell him the baby is not his, so that you're stuck with him having a say in how you raise your baby, considering how abusive he is.  And then, leave him and cut all communications with him.  If you're afraid he might stalk you, then get a restraining order.    Protect yourself and your baby.|`|cYRZpGkqaa	Photograph any marks he leaves on you. Get a restraining order against him. Once the baby is born, take him for child support (if he truly believes that the child is not his he can get a dna test). Use your photographic evidence to help limit his visitation, and make sure you let them know that you want it supervised.

But the DRs know whats best|`|KZMezu7oaa	I'm guessing your uncomfortable?? I'm 8 months pregnant with my 4th so I sympathize. However...you should not try to induce yourself, being that you are only 37 weeks. Your baby is obviously not done growing or dilation, or effacement would have begun. Keep in mind that unless you know the EXACT date of conception your due date could be off. Virtually nobody delivers on their estimated due date. For all you know you could be 35 weeks. It's safest to let your practioner be the judge of when you should try do-it-yourself induction tehniques.|`|vue9NOhYaa	There is no safe way to induce labor yourself.  THe most you can do is try to encourage it IF your body is about ready to go. (All the usual tricks -- walking, sex, spicy foods.)  The doctor will not induce at 37 weeks unless there is a clear medical reason, and with an unripe cervix, an induction at this point would almost certainly fail -- leading to a c-section.    Relax. Being dilated/effaced, or NOT dilated/effaced at 37 weeks means nothing.  You might go into labor tomorrow, or not for 3-4 weeks.  If it's a first baby you probably WILL go a little over (the 'average' for a first baby is closer to 41 weeks than 40), but what matters is that you WILL go into labor when your body, and your baby, are ready.
bTlhBX3daa	My guess is that the baby has hiccups. It is very common around this time. I am 30 weeks today, and I have noticed a very similar feeling a few times recently.<br>  <br>  I'm pretty sure it's hiccups.|`|d6r5hRjYaa	its probably just the excess blood flow. i get heart palpitations when im pregnant with both of my babies. its just the extra blood flow. i wouldnt worry|`|SxxXBC4vaa	hiccups maybe? when my baby gets hiccups I feel and see the pulsations in the same spot and sometimes they can last for quite some time.|`|1ezYfkX7aa	Your baby could have the hiccups.|`|aYCjy8Neaa	Any rhythmic motions in your stomach are most likely a case of the hiccups in the baby. They have them on and off the entire time, but now that they are bigger you really notice them.
z74wSbQoaa	My daughter in dance at age 2.  It was a Mommy & Me class and I did it for a socialization activity.  I didn't have a day care.  We did half day two days a week of preschool starting at age 3.|`|SYaKlWy6aa	My 3 yr old isn't in anything at the moment, 5 yr old is in dance, 12 yr old is in swimming and soccer, also plays clarinet|`|0qP8gLpyaa	My little guy is only 2 so he's not big enough or old enough for any organized activities where we live yet.  When he's 3 we will probably get him into T Ball with kids his age so he has something to do.      As for now we work with him in late spring- summer in the pool for water comfort and doing some basic things like learning to float and kick, hold his breath etc.. We've been doing that for 2 summers now with him and will again this year. He loves the water and will jump in to waiting arms, kicks with support under him and can hold his breath.  Probably won't put him into formal swimming lessons until he's at least in kindergarten though.    He also goes to a toddler group for 2 year olds at our church once a week.|`|zuZKj3xXaa	Karate...7 lol he LOVED it :)   martial arts..same thing right? haha    36 weeks and 4 days pregnant!|`|QHpq3QpAaa	My Son is 3 and a half and in November I put him in YMCA simming lessons. He absoloutely LOVED it. They have one coming up again and I am going to put him in another class. We tried Karate but his attention span just wasnt all there yet. It was also quite expensive. The swim lesson were only about $35.00.|`|80Zlwifsaa	I put my first child in ballet when she was three and I figured out it was a waste of time and money, she didn't really care one way or the other if she went. Since then with the rest of my kids I have waited until they were in elementary school to put them in activities of their choice.    My oldest who is almost thirteen has been in basketball for three or four years now, she did do soccer for a few years, and now does volleyball, she played clarinet and saxaphone for a few years as well.    My middle daughter who is almost eleven is going on her fourth year of wrestling, and has been in girl scouts for almost six years, and started playing trombone this year.    My youngest who is in Kindergarden isn't in any extra activities yet.    I don't believe in overloading a child with activities and paying a bunch of money to one up other parents. I let my kids do one sport/activity of their choosing a season, I don't want them to be overwhelmed and I don't want to be overwhelmed either. My oldest are both in Highly Capable programs at school so they have extra homework as well so I think they have enough to do.|`|aJjV5b95aa	My son is 7, he has played basketball and done karate. He is stating soccer and baseball this year. Oh and he also rides a dirt bike.|`|AA11403695	6 year old - swimming since age 2. Karate since 5, spanish club with school, horse back riding since age 2(he has a physical disability and this is therapeutic),basketball this year with school       4 year old - swimming alone when brother swims( doesn't like lessons) ; tried karate but didn't like karate.  going to try soccer this spring    2year old- nothing yet; going to do Irish Dance at age 5.|`|0f9d22aead147d22fd2ab9b6839eb1d4aa	I started my daughter in YMCA mommy & me swimming classes at 9 months and she LOVES it!!  she learned early to become aquainted with the water,  she would even try to swim (kick and reach) in the bath tub.  Now that she's turning 2 we're thinking of signing up for a class at "My Gym".(another mommy & me for her age group).. it looks like alot of fun with climbing swinging & tumbeling... it's like Mini Gymnastics...     She also goes to preschool three afternoons a week for one on one peer interaction, Her teachers are amaizing; she's always learning new things and doing arts & crafts and having a great time ... Which also leaves me open to working part time (my adult interaction)     We keep a busy schedule but she has always been Very Active and enjoys doing structured activities so I like to encourage as much safe & fun activity as she likes.
9OsjdsrZaa	Yes.  You could be.  Symptoms of pregnancy can come on rather fast. You will need to have a blood test to confirm though.  The reason for the blood test, is that often when you are on birth control pills, you can get false readings from a pregnancy test...either +/-.  Birth control pills regulate your hormones and can often mess with home pregnancy tests.  Probably not what you want to hear, but to be safe, you should go in and get the test.|`|aWPQXoIAaa	This actually just happened to me. I took a pregnancy test the week I was suppose to get my period and it was negative. I then took it a week later and it was positive. Good luck!|`|5bc21d2d2a57683cdbd5ef3c4094ebc4aa	You could have tested too early.  Wait a week and if no period, take another test.    It is a myth that antibiotics make birth control ineffective.|`|tmh42R6Caa	Yes.  I had 3 negative tests before one came out positive.  I was testing too early to the conception date.  If you really think you're pregnant, wait a week and test again.|`|VmqOq8Qjaa	Try again in 5-10 days, there is always a possibility, if you get a neg from that then most likely you are not.|`|RnM4Rr5oaa	i think you should wait a week and test again  i too am getting negative results even though i feel pregnant  even though its sooo hard not to test again  im gonna wait until the weekend and see what happens|`|zJv8LA5Yaa	Yes, possibly.  Some women take longer to test positive.  Plus pregnancy tests read your hCG levels & if you aren't very far along, they might not be high enough to be detectable.    It could be something else to, of course.|`|pfGffL30aa	barney is a dinosaur that loves to play and eat food|`|FgvnitQfaa	the antibiotics may simply have upset your digestive tract and are causing gas. your symptoms don't sound like pregnancy ones but all of us are different. what you have not said is how long after your last missed period you took the test. thats the one symptom thats almost always certain:)|`|5NclgoIxaa	Yes u can be prego. Its possible that you took the test too early. Depending on what type of pregnancy test you used, it may not be detecting any hcg in your urine if its the cheap kind.
njAD3U5Aaa	They have a book I got when I was pregnant of all sorts of things you could do to predict a boy or girl. It was fun to do just to see. You can do an ultrasound. But its kinda nice to be a surprise. And if any one watched Private Practice last night... we know ultrasound isn't always right... so don't get the hopes too high. : )<br>  <br>  I answered your other question too. Good Luck.|`|P1TzeWNyaa	They only way to know is wait until you are far enough along and am able to get a clear view during ultrasound or wait until the baby is born. I kept looking at the sites that say whether it's going to be a boy or girl and they always came up like 52% Boy and the Chinese calendar said boy but we got a clear view this Wed and we are having a little girl! The sites were also wrong with all 4 of my little cousins.|`|ca9dEvSAaa	Honestly the only way to know for sure is an ultrasound with a trained technition. <br>  <br>  He or she will be able to tell you for sure.|`|nYioXmnGaa	Yeah wait a few weeks  and have an ultrasound !|`|ZNhP3mpUaa	other than a 20 week scan, no.|`|J3JClsuQaa	Like everyone said, the US is the only way to know for sure, but I still have about 6 wks to wait for that and would like to do some little fun things too... If you could, I'd love to have an email about the two you've tried.  Oh, and someone told me the other day that the heart beat could be a way to tell... she said that in the 150's or slower rate means a boy and higher rate, 170's is a girl... but not concrete, of course... Congrats!|`|4259a8b8fa5899f30c0e319fda9936fdaa	an ultra-sound at your 20 week checkup can usually determine the sex....if the baby "cooperates" and shows the important parts.<br>  <br>  an amniocentisis is an invasive test where the doctor uses a needle to take out some of the amniotic fluid.  The analysis of the fluid can give 100% results of the sex.|`|Zbn8A7Geaa	A sonogram should be able to tell the sex of the child. If the technician can get a good shot that is. Sometimes the babies aren't cooperative and won't move a certain way so you can't tell,  but usually you can.|`|zLVZyfwUaa	CVS (chorionic villi sampling) or <br>  amniocentesis|`|9LqHgmcLaa	THEY CAN SEE IF THE BABY IS A BOY OR GIRL WHEN THEY DO A ULTRA SOUND AT 20 WEEKS OR LATER.
AA10458750	The first thing you need to do is make your Drs. appointments....get on somebody's insurance if you are nto already covered and then buy some prenatals! After about 12 weeks, you can start buying things , little by little. The main things you will need is diapers, formula, a place for baby to sleep and some clothes. You can get clothes for $5- $10 bucks off of Craigslist and by going to second hand shops.|`|1qnbvUYPaa	Lol hunny 9 weeks is very early considering you don't even know what your having yet! Wait untill your 20 weeks [or once you know what sex the baby is] to buy things.<br>  <br>  I'm 31 weeks and all I have for my babygirl is a few onsies and a few crib shoes haha so you've got PLENTY of time.<br>  <br>  Congrats! =]|`|CpiLHcTlaa	i wouldn;t get anything yet... not until your first trimester is over. if something (god forbid) were to happen whatever you buy just looking at it would break your heart. i know how it is i was 17 when i had my son and i really just wanted to buy stuff for him.  just calm down. if you really can;t resist buy a teddy or something small like that.<br>  <br>  besides its bad luck! my mom wanted me to have a girl she bought something pink and poof it turned out i had a boy! lol|`|Fj4FjEpaaa	i got my baby stuff after i noticed i was having a boy.but you can start now.you can get it's towel,wash cloths,bottles & ...<br>  good luck.|`|vygYFdsSaa	It's wayyyy too soon to buy things for your baby. You are less than 1/4 of the way through your pregnancy. I am way too superstitious to buy anything for my baby yet and I'm 14 weeks...|`|k4z2pTSraa	Nothing, it is bad luck to buy anything for the baby until you are 6 months.  Start buying some nice maternity clothes...|`|Tv6mKW1xaa	I would wait cause 9 weeks your still in trouble for a miscarriage so I would wait till you are at least 4 months long!|`|Fh4B88ZGaa	Just save your money right now. There will be plenty of time to buy things when you are farther along. Open a savings account, and start putting as much money away as you can.|`|d508e71226a169afed7ebfc7e78bbc5baa	buy stock in some company that produces birth control pills and more painful castrations.  You also should get yourself a storage unit and just by as much diapers that you can get, since you are only nine weeks by girl diapers and if you have a boy don't worry that mostly fit the same. It is just in the coloring pink for girls and blue for boys and boys that were pink that early in life will never know until you run out.  It is a very costly thing to keep up with the diapers when you and the daddy don't, oh yea do you know who or which one is the daddy, have any money
znjl6WrWaa	oh yeah. Your hair changes too when you're pregnant. Sometimes it won't hold a dye job, or it will turn out a completely different color. Sometimes your hair will become more thick or curly. <br>  <br>  Sorry<br>  <br>  It should go back to normal after you have your baby<br>  <br>  ...hopefully :)|`|FAGI8owFaa	my hair wouldnt curl......so go figure.and my baby has major curly hair I think she stole it from me.lol
fHjSonssaa	cramping in the first tri-mester CAN be normal.  It can be caused by stretchig uterus- implantationc can cause cramps.  Dehydration can cause cramps.    If you're not bleeding and don't start to bleed, and the cramps subside, it's fine.    It also could be implantation- therefore you might spot a bit (depending how exactly how far along you are).    Unfortunately, even if it was a miscarriage, there's nothing they can really do for you or baby at this point- except to make sure the miscarriage is carried out the way it should be so you're safe.    3 minutes - totally normal.  I had them a little longer at first.  Don't panic.  They come on and off here and there- however they shouldb't be constant.|`|VmqOq8Qjaa	I was cramping all the way up to 8 weeks, it is very normal, if you are not bleeding then there shouldn't be anything to worry about.|`|QsIco3Fxaa	Go see your doctor. Having cramps while pregnant is always a bad sign. It should never be ignored.  I wish you health and luck.|`|RnM4Rr5oaa	i have the same thing  but im still unsure if i am pregnant or not  i get these cramps like af is coming but doesnt  but i think it is normal during the first stages of pregnancy|`|DRb4Qlypaa	This camping is caused by your uterus stretching. I had really bad cramps and nothing was wrong, but if they are worse than period cramps you should call the doctor or if you already have an OB call them and tell them everything that has been going on and they may tell you to come in.
wzM5WB8Xaa	I did not have a normal bowel movement from month 7 on. I think that as the baby gets larger and pushes down on things like your colon, it makes your poop squishier and gives you the urge to poop more often (same as with your bladder). It's normal, but go see your doctor if you suspect that you have a flu.|`|ZZ6fJqCbaa	I have the opposite problem.  I am anemic so I was told to triple my iron pills - UGH -  you can imagine my problems with that.|`|4iXL4C6paa	I had those problems in all four of my pregnancy, I would also wake up in the middle of the night with my stomach messed up, and would have diarrhea also...it is normal, did you eat anything that you usually dont?  Well it really doesn't matter what you ate because you can eat the same things you always do and still have to stay in the bathroom...just part of being pregnant.lol.|`|AA12062311	I have had issues through this whole thing. If I am not constipated, I have diarrhea. Seems like there is no in between for me.
vygYFdsSaa	I'm planning on finding out the sex of my baby as soon as possible. I probably won't share my name ideas, just because me and my boyfriend aren't going to officially pick the name until we "meet" baby in real life, lol...have to make sure it suits him!! Maybe some people don't tell others their name picks because they aren't 100% sure of it yet.|`|VHHis05Naa	My motives?  My motive is to have the pregnancy and birthday experience that I want.  I'm going through the sickness and birth, I want to do things my way.  I am proud of the names I've picked, but I want the element of surprise.   That's my choice.  You made yours now your friend is making hers.  Not a big deal, is it?<br>  <br>  We are not finding out the sex, either.  Again, MY choice.  And yes, everyone will find out eventually.  So hold your horses.|`|dPULl5hjaa	She wants to keep things to herself - there's nothing wrong with that!|`|ckgiPMm4aa	Well like you, I choose to tell everyone, but at first, me and my husband kept both the sex and the name a secret. If people don't know the baby's name until it's born, it's less likely that people with give you $hit for it, and sometimes it's just a nice surprise, especially if your naming the baby after someone. And as far as not finding out the sex, some people like to do things the old fashioned way, we thought about not finding out the sex, but we just couldn't wait to find out.|`|ca9dEvSAaa	I found out the sex. I changed the name I wanted for her so many times that there is now a running joke. People won't call her the name I picked now. They say they'll call her what I write on the birth certificate. lol<br>  <br>  So my next baby I will keep the name a secret. But I will find out the gender.|`|J3JClsuQaa	Well, with both pregnancies (I'm 3 mo.s now and have a 6 yr old daughter)  I wanted to know the sex of the baby and always ask for advice on the name.  Like if I have a boy, I'm thinking of naming him Silas James.  : )  It's kind of an unusual name... so I even asked a man named Silas (here on yahoo questions) if he liked his name in an email.  I've also polled the peeps in a question to see how many of them liked it.  I did this because I don't want to name him something he doesn't like.  : )  What I'm saying is... besides being proud and wanting to share a name, you also want to do your research, see what people think... And, about the sex of the baby,  I want to know mostly because I can't wait to find out : ), and also because it makes it easier to prepare financially.  : )|`|sXCSVFBaaa	I personally think it'd be a fun surprise to not find out the gender with one of our babies, but since this was my first... I couldn't hack it. As far as names go, my husband and I decided not to tell anything about names until after she's born.<br>  <br>  a.) we haven't even decided for sure on a name. We probably won't until she's born anyway.<br>  b.) I don't want everyone's opinions on possible names. I've heard of some people picking a name and changing it after everyone made a big deal about it.<br>  c.) It's fun for it to be a surprise!|`|rSCeB6T6aa	We definitely wanted to know the sex of the baby so we could buy appropriate things.  But i could see how some people would want to have that wonderful surprise of finding out when he/she comes out.  It could be a very neat experience to wait to find out.  Though i could never do it!  Also, I hesitate telling names we are thinking of because people always have their opinion of the names.   I have had family members that did not like names i did, and it brought hesitation to naming her that.  You don't want to hear your family say they don't like that name.  I can totally see why people would not want to tell.  Plus, maybe they aren't 100% sure yet.|`|ce8COixxaa	I will definitelyy want to find out! I think it's practical to find out so thatyou haveve gender appropriatete items, and you can get more excited! On some level, I understand about the name decision. What if at the last minute you change your mind about what you want to name it, then you would have to go back and tell everyone "no nevermind it's this" and it is exciting to introduce your baby for the first time to your family after he or she is born! Although, I think I will tell people once we decide a name after we find out the sex.|`|GUUgeptjaa	My hubby and I have found out the gender of all three of our kids, so we can plan and be prepared clothing wise, room wise, etc.<br>  <br>  Its my choice not to tell the names, mostly because I am not sure of what their names will be until they come out, because the name we pick now may not fit that child, just my little quirk
4259a8b8fa5899f30c0e319fda9936fdaa	I waited to tell my job until i was about 10 weeks pregnant.  Most people don't have many prenatal doctor appointments in the first trimester, plus the chances of miscarriage decrease once the first trimester is over.  Congrats and good luck.|`|Brqd1YcDaa	check the human resource dept. first and see what needs to be done in advance.|`|Q05rrSX4aa	You can tell them right away if you like.  But it may be best to hold off until you have hit the 12 week mark.  Most people wait until then anyway.  If your job requires any lifting, or things that could affect your pregnancy, then you need to tell them right away.|`|rSCeB6T6aa	I told them a little sooner than my 3 month mark.  I wanted them to now early on.  12 weeks pregnant is usually when chance of miscarriage goes down, so i told them right around that day.  Plus, i didnt have too many appts before then, so it wasnt bad.  good luck|`|PTW0BSuZaa	Tell them now, the sooner the better. They need to know so as soon as you get your boss alone just let them know in private.<br>  Good luck.
vhuqAqNdaa	it's 26 weeks paid here in ireland, so sounds about right for you!<br>  Edit: if you are feeling too unwell to return to work yet you could come off your maternity leave and claim sickness benefit!|`|3Rr5SAhhaa	Depends on your company, I think the average is 6-8 WEEKS, so you are lucky if you have 6 months off.

CiFR2xuBaa	It will be hard, but it won't take as long as you think. Just take the bottle altogether. Throw all the bottles away and replace with a soft spout sippy cup. He may cry, but as soon as he realizes that the only way to get his milk is with the cup, he will take it and be happy. Trust me, I successfully weaned my 4 year old off the bottle when she was 6 months and I weaned my 17 month old when she was 5 months, and I plan on doing the same with baby #3. The key is to take the bottle before they become too attached, that way it won't be hard on you or them in the end. Hope this helps! :)|`|bmoCpcdraa	just ,be a parent , throw them all away, give him a stuff animal to sleep with , i hope i helped|`|sFGgPTk3aa	We introduced a sippy cup before taking off  the bottle.  Then we just packed all the bottles up and told her she had to use a sippy.  He will cry because so far it has worked.  Show him all the bottles are gone and tell him he will have to use a sippy. It may seem like you are being cruel, but once he realizes the bottles are all gone (get them out of your house or hide them somewhere he won't find them) he will get used to his sippy.  Good luck!|`|TJezsCkHaa	What i did.I gave my little one his bottle one morning and asked him to throw it in the garbage,then we took that garbage bag out and "waited"for the garbage truck to come and we waived bye bye.<br>  <br>  But,that night,he cried his lungs out.Then i replayed the day with him and reminded him that the garbage truck took it and left him the sippy cup because he is a big boy now.And it worked!|`|LAsYy7C8aa	less milk....more water.  put something that he wants in a sippy cup.  And babies also shouldn't go to sleep with bottles for a number of reasons.  Sometimes its ok to let him cry, it isn't mean unless you are truly neglecting him or something of that nature.    My first daughter, I felt the same way.  Now after having number 3...she can cry a little while.  It won't hurt her and she knows that its not going to get her her way...babies learn manipulation at a young age.  If I cry someones gonna give me something.|`|aDQlDFdraa	I am in the middle of this situation now. What I have done is to give her a cup during the day with juice and water. She will drink that great. Sometimes I even put a little soda just to coax her into a cup. Gradually we are giving her more in the cup. Last night and this morning was the first time we have had no bottle. Just keep trying. =)
6XRJT6Xbaa	- Hallie, Arianna, Brooke, Holly<br>  -  Brandon, Brody, William, Gavin<br>  <br>  I love your girl names especially Ariella. One of my fav boys names is Declan I love Irish names.

Ariela is ok, definitely pretty and very unique. However, I strongly dislike Serenity and Meadow. I just feel like Serenity is kind of a trashy-sounding name (sorry!) and to me, Meadow isn't really a name.<br>  <br>  I really like Avery for a boy, but I don't really like your other names. To me, words and places aren't names, so Ever and Harbour just don't cut it. Also, with names like that you can't tell if they are male or female just from looking at the name on the page, and names like that tend to bother me. Just personal preference! Oh, and Declan is OK, it's a strong Irish name, which is a plus, but it sounds so-so to me.|`|o7I8vy3Oaa	4 girls names:  Serenity (I love that one) , Melodie (Reminds me of music) , Skye (Just beautiful), and Jasmine (Like a princess)<br>  <br>  4 guys names: Daniel (Simple, and common), Liam (I don't know..

Fsr2Rofzaa	I took those with all 4 of my pregnancies, the regular prenat vit. made me vomit!  I took 2 of the flinstones daily|`|ZNhP3mpUaa	you need to take more than just flinstones... if you aren't, you need to take at least 2 a day AND get on 5-800Mg of Folic Acid. Not to mention find another source of calcium and VitaminC, since flinstones don't have as much as prenatals.|`|WPI0Z47saa	I hear alot of girls say their doctors tell them to take 2 flinstones a day. Prenatal vitamins are much better though if you can tolerate them. They have things in it that flinstones do not. If you don't have a prescription plan then there are some pretty cheap OTC ones for under $8.|`|eU5Eth2aaa	My aunt had to take Flintstones 2 times a day because her prenatal's made her sooo sick.  I would totally ask your doctor though..|`|QrZcKRsDaa	Two. I took those at first & my doctor told me to take two. Now I just take some from WalMart because chewing those Flinstones made me nauseous!!|`|AA10458750	they usually recommend a double dose...so 2 a day should be fine.|`|oZEPi0nuaa	You have to take folic acid, if there is none in the vitamins, you can buy just folic acid. It helps prevent against a lot of birth defects.|`|seU9VwIJaa	Most people will say 2, but check with your doctor just in case. They may have you take another supplement such as iron if you're anemic.<br>  Congrats and good luck!
ZNhP3mpUaa	You don't deserve help. Use you're head. Hearing crap like that pisses me off. You don't get pregnancy symptoms that soon dumb@ss. don't come on here with your questions of "i'll never do it again cause the Lord himself knows you will. I don't even care if I lose 10 points for this. Idiot. You're worried about a cold. God damn.|`|1ezYfkX7aa	Really sounds like you are on the wrong road in life and need some major help. Not only are you hooked on drugs but your not even worried about not only pregnancy, but stds. You really need to smarten up and hopefully your not pregnant cause you are in NO shape to raise a child....it would turn out just like you!|`|eU5Eth2aaa	It is definitely to early for symptoms.  Your body is probably out of whack since you had so much crap in your system.  Take a pregnancy test on the day of your expected period, just to be safe.  Since you said that you would never do the drugs and stuff again, you should quite the smoking too.  Especially if you might be pregnant.|`|ggfE4rlvaa	It's the drugs. Too soon to tell if you're pregnant, even more too soon for symptoms. Be careful next time, and quit doing drugs so you don't have these questions.|`|OI3bf4yjaa	There is a possibility that you are pregnant. However, I hope that you are NOT!! You clearly have no responsibility what so ever.|`|AA10458750	Ewww NASTY! I PRAY you are not carryign a child. Reading that was such a dispointment. Get a LIFE! a JOB! Better yet, just get a CLUE!|`|tMtLebtNaa	a lot of people are being mean. im not one of those people. i would say the drugs but i am twelve so that may not help. i hope you feel better soon and try some chicken noodle soup. if you are addicted to drugs, you cant really help that but try to do your best and may god be with you.|`|vigFmfLmaa	I really hope you're not pregnant.  What are you, 13?  Perhaps it's all the crap you're putting in your body that's making you feel ill, and rightly so.  That hard life you're living will eventually kill you.|`|oQ5oKILHaa	Like you said its probably too early to tell. But just incase no more drugs. Especially no more thizzles!!! Just try to be healthy until you know 4 sure. Good luck girl try to be more careful.|`|ouh5eXcmaa	either your pg or your sick cuz the drugs...<br>  the eating non stop means your most likely pg!! <br>  how old r u?????<br>  plz message back|`|ihL0FkJYaa	wait 2 more weeks and test again|`|rC6gL7KOaa	You're disgusting. I hope you're not pregnant, for the child's sake.|`|axCFlk5Zaa	lol, I have to say you are going to be a great Mother.|`|d678f8b7d26c1604273a818860d37290aa	With taking Ecstasy pot and adderall you could have causes a lot of Internal problems. Something in your body may not being working right and failing. You need to see a Dr asap!!! Some people use drugs that was lace with something and or had to much of something and dye any where from that night to week to 2months after. Its very important you go see a dr. go to the ER get some test ran. Also while your there get a full round of std test and hiv. You never know where he has been and if a condom has broke before. Even if you trust him you still need to be tested people get it live with hiv for years before they know it. Test 6mo later it can take up to 6mos to show a + test. <br>  <br>  best of luck!!!<br>  <br>  EDIT ITS NOT TO LATE FOR SIGNS<br>  <br>  its been a week. So that would make you 3 weeks pregnant. THe two weeks from when your last day of your period till your egg is ready baby making day is very important stage with out that stage you cant get pregnant. then you have sex make a baby. That would make you 3 weeks so yes you can have signs. <br>  <br>  but i think your sex b/c of the amount of drugs you took.|`|AA10770446	Troll...
oehA2KMWaa	thats very very good levels i would not worry hun those are excellent|`|9hrJfhIIaa	<a href="http://www.americanpregnancy.org/duringpregnancy/hcglevels.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.americanpregnancy.org/duringp...</a><br>  <br>  this site has been a great help to me!!|`|5deb28fe9fecaef7f55e1f593df11203aa	sounds really good to me...try not to stress
1z3C0R2Vaa	They are very effective if you  use correctly and they do not affect period good luck.............|`|PDcnXgE6aa	they are 99% effective ..........but it does not mean u use it often because its clearly mentioned that prolonged use of these affects health.<br>  <br>  They doesn't effects periods date.|`|Q05rrSX4aa	Most are 99% effective when used correctly.<br>  <br>  It will effect your period when you first start taking them.  And you will get your period with in a few days of the non active pills.  You may have spotting, or irregular period for the first little while.  Birth control pills come with information that explains all of that, speak to your doctor about it as well.
85o25Wd4aa	I lost my plug a month before I went into labour.  They say it could be a couple weeks before, but some women go within 48 hours.|`|AuVtUjVAaa	you can loose your mucus plug and still not go into labour for up to 2 weeks. since your already at your due date it could be any day for you.<br>  I lost my mucus plug slowly over 1.5 weeks, but I had gotten my membrane stripped twice. than went into labour the next day after the 2nd stripping.  good luck|`|WaoGiPHIaa	the mucous plug sheds and rebuilds itself, so losing the mucous plug is not a sign that labor is imminent. the only way to tell is by ultrasound and checking if the fluid is lowered.|`|ihL0FkJYaa	well first of all how far along are you if that was your mucus plug it should be soon|`|whBQ9Q7saa	sounds like it but how far alon are you? i went into labour the day after
7add460ae24c9452ae87b5a99c5aa756aa	Far too soon to tell.  <br>  7 days after sex is implantation<br>  14 days after you can test|`|Qd0sFMdHaa	not pregnant yet; your body is trying to regulate itself from coming off the birth control. give it another cycle and then your body should be ready to conceive.|`|imIiuaAAaa	Since you two are TTCing, you may just be making yourself have the symptoms subconsciously. It may just be getting off the birth control that's making you feel weird...if all else, test in a few weeks.<br>  <br>  Good luck with everything!|`|Tv6mKW1xaa	If its to early to test than I am pretty sure its 2 easy to have symptoms!<br>  You dont start to get symptoms for at least a couple weeks!|`|Khs7HBYmaa	ITS TOO SOON RIGHT NOW. YOU SHOULD WAIT A COUPLE OF WEEKS TO BE SURE.|`|tu7aqUoxaa	too soon to tell
IkB1OyjCaa	I would say maybe. You have a justification for every symptom you are feeling so maybe not. The only way to find out is to do a home pregeancy test or wait till you miss you period. GOOD LUCK!|`|LI1KG9Zpaa	Go to a Store (walmart) And buy one of those disposable Test. and find out.|`|HFRP1Qzgaa	your breasts wouldnt of grown that quick it takes months through pregnancy to grow but they could of sweld abit... after about a month n a half of pregnancy i started getting really hot sick to the stomach and dizzy. . . but going to the toilet twice in the night wouldnt av anything to do with being pregnant you only start going to the toilet alot a good few months into the pregnancy when the baby is pressing on you blader so id say thats down to the water your drinking, but i drank alot when i was pregnant so its hard to tell weather you are or not so i gess you will just have to wait a little loner just keep looking out for more signs but the change in your discharge is a good sign|`|e2HW9iQ5aa	Go to a drugstore and buy a home pregnancy test. I know doing a TEST to find out is a really out there suggestion as opposed to asking strangers on yahoo, but....|`|AA12041870	You could be.  Of course, you may not be, either.  YA isn't a clinic.  Go see a doctor.|`|2nNfD4T1aa	if you have a sore throat you  may have a bacterial infection.<br>  <br>  <br>  you really need to go to a doctor.|`|X0ooc06vaa	Consult a doctor.|`|g9TxgMlwaa	No... Take a pregnancy test.. That'll tell you. Not an answer board|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	It sounds like you could be. Good luck with the test in about a week!
P1TzeWNyaa	You will it may just take a little longer. I am a lot overweight and the doc told me it would be much later for me to be able to feel her move inside or from the outside, but I am currently 20 weeks pregnant and have been feeling her since 15 or 16 weeks and my husband can occasionally feel her from the outside starting at 18 weeks.|`|VHHis05Naa	It depends on how overweight you are.  Are you obese?  If you are, I'm afraid that you might not show for a long time, if you show at all.  I'm sure you'll feel the kicking and bumping, though.  I've never seen a foot push out of my belly and I'm not a big girl.  I do see my belly moving all over the place, but no feet sticking out.  With my daughter, I could see body parts moving around, but there was no way to identify what those parts were by just looking.  <br>  <br>  Being thinner does not guarantee and enjoyable pregnancy.  Mine as been terrible with Hyperemesis, headaches, restless legs, itchy skin, facial acne, keratosis pilaris, and being tired 24/7.  Enjoy what you can and don't worry about what other women are experiencing.  This is YOUR moment and revel in it.  :)|`|rxjdovzyaa	THis really depends on how overweight you are.  You will still feel the kicks - they are coming from the inside after all, but you may not be able to see or feel the kicks from the outside as strongly depending on how much padding you have.  <br>  Still , once the baby is here and healthy, you will get to enjoy all the parenting things!|`|WaoGiPHIaa	being overweight does make you at high risk for complications during pregnancy, especially during cesarean section. starting a pregnancy overweight, like being underweight, has it's pros and cons. ALL pregnant women are supposed to stick to healthy nutrition and being overweight or underweight is no exception to this rule. Your weight gain should be closely monitored due to having access weight, which may lead to diabetes, which is very common in pregnancy, especially among those that are overweight.|`|rSCeB6T6aa	I am overweight and 29 weeks pregnant.  You will def feel her kick and move around, it just may take a little longer.  Around 23 weeks is when i felt the stronger kicks, and theyve been getting stronger ever since.  Also, I havent gotten the "pregnant belly" as prominant as skinnier women.  I dont think strangers can tell I am pregnant.  But maternity shirts do wonders!  They even make me feel that i look more pregnant, and they are so cute!!  good luck!|`|yKS2UI87aa	Really depends on how big you are. You will still be able to feel the kick may not be able to see the foot. It depends on how you carry your weight whether you will be able to tell. Congrat's|`|Khs7HBYmaa	Yes you will experience everything that a skinny woman does. Your weight does not determine that.|`|Un4y3lWqaa	It depends on how your weight is distributed.  If you are heavy in the midsection, it will take longer before you can see movement from the outside.
plI0WOrUaa	I'm not sure. Usually that happens when the baby is pushing up against the bladder, but at 8 weeks, i'm not sure if that can happen yet or not.  I would talk to your doctor about this, just to rule out any infection that may be coming on.  I know that having fibroids can cause bladder issues while pregnant, because the pregnancy can make them bigger and play havok on the bladder.  Don't freak out about that, a lot of women have them, and they aren't cancerous.  I have one, and many women do too.  Just check with your doctor to ease your mind.  Good luck!! :)|`|3X0t8JrXaa	It sounds a little abnormal.  I get sudden, really strong urges to pee but I've never peed on myself or been unable to hold it.  I'd tell your doctor just in case there's an infection like urinary tract.  In the meantime maybe you can wear pads or something so it doesn't happen in public.
fdalc5Rcaa	,YOU COUNT FROM THE FRIST DAY OF YOUR LAST PERIOD <br>  WHAT WAS YOUR DATE OF YOUR LAST PERIOD ??

Good luck!!|`|4aguqVyIaa	When you go to your doctor for the first time they will most likely calculate it for you and possibly give you an ultrasound to give you a more accurate due date.  I hope everything goes well for you.  Being a mommy is great.  I know you may be worried but its the best.  I got pregnant with my first at 21 and was very worried, but its the best thing thats ever happened to me.  Good luck!  (also, you can just add 40 weeks from the first day of your last period if you don't want to wait)|`|Q3kLsH1waa	it seems you have the easy part of knowing the day you conceived. now add 41 weeks to that date( a full-term pregnancy is 41 weeks) you can also go to pregnancy websites like www.pregnancy.com they have calculators that automatically do it for you if you know the first day of your LAST cycle|`|e4ec8a26064d1b408b4d493f2b6d5d8baa	Use this page! <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.americanpregnancy.org/duringpregnancy/pregcalc.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.americanpregnancy.org/duringp...</a>|`|PvnnWE1Baa	I'm 6wks preggo & my last period was Jan. 4th.

aWL7mkbMaa	Go to a clinic and get a blood test just to be sure.  <br>  <br>  Sometimes the levels of hormones are not that high during the day, you get a better result if you take the first urine of the day.  I have to tell thought, that if one said yes the probability is like 95% that is yes, unless you did the test incorrectly and that is hard to believe. <br>  <br>  I'm in the same boat right now... exact same symptoms and just found out on the 17th that I'm pregnant.|`|3Rr5SAhhaa	My magic 8 ball say.... Take a pregnancy test.|`|goMgkYRTaa	stop thinking that you're pregnant - it'll stall the whole cycle - which will make you stressed and gain weight and make you neasuated..and SERIOUSLY..you cannot tell if you're prego the day after... wait a month.|`|yQKN8xyIaa	its a good chance u might be hunny um just talk a other test but take a clear blue test! that's what i took and it said i was pregnant so now im 10 weeks & 1 day pregnant! :) i wish you the best of luck hunny.|`|TmYwUdFLaa	I would say that you are.  Pregnacy tests don't normally say you are pregnant unless you are.  They have however been know to shown a negative result when you are pregnant.  Good luck
dlqa6yFkaa	Call the doctor now, and get to your hospital. Don't mess around.|`|OLW0Irbhaa	I don't mean to sound harsh but honestly....why would you even be asking this question on-line?  You know you are at risk and I'm sure (as a mom w/preterm labor issues) they told you to call/come in with any issues like you are describing.  You know exactly what you should be doing instead of asking questions on-line.|`|dRd5d6Bgaa	I'd go to the doctor and get checked out, that's the least you could do for yourself. I'd hate for you to let it go and relax and then tonight be in complete labor. good luck.|`|UxhzluZnaa	if you have already had problems with preterm labor you need to go to the doc chances are your having this baby early|`|KNxs4PrZaa	definatly call doc, if you are in labor you need to let them know incase they want to try to stop it again.|`|l7U9dGrWaa	call doc
EzuYExM4aa	Nose bleeds are common during pregnancy but as you probably know, just because you have a nose bleed doesn't always mean you are pregnant.  my nose didn't start bleeding until i was about 3 months along.<br>  <br>  But the other symptoms sound like what i went through especially sore back and and sore boobs|`|K2jT1z5jaa	Possibly by those symptoms. Nose bleed can be from change in hormones in body.<br>  take a tst . Only way to confirm<br>  <br>  god bless x|`|wkd5CMNaaa	Nosebleedss can occur in pregnancy, but generally don't start occuring very early, so they aren't considered signs of pregnant. <br>  Cramping, back and headaches and heavy breasts are all signs of pregnancy, but also signs of an upcoming period. <br>  You will just have to wait and see.
yQKN8xyIaa	yes hunny these are signs of pregnancy i believe just get her a test a clear blue test would be a best one that's a test i took and it said i was pregnant and now im 10 weeks & 1 day pregnant! i wish y'all to the best of luck :)|`|EUTRJqCsaa	lmao, sorry but pre-ejaculate is NOT something you control. it just comes out. so unless you had a condom on, it did get in her.<br>  <br>  yes, they are symptoms.<br>  <br>  go buy her a test. good luck.|`|U6CF0Gh0aa	If you had unprotected sex then yes, she could be pregnant.|`|wkd5CMNaaa	You had unprotected sex.  So yes, she could be pregnant.|`|tUD4KMzBaa	Hello....<br>  Most guys don't feel it when the pre-*** comes out.<br>  there is a gland that is inside of you and when you get<br>  aroused sperm can make its way up, and the gland helps<br>  the sperm move along, and it can drip out without you feeling<br>  it.<br>  <br>  if you didnt want to get her pregnant you should have used a <br>  condom.<br>  <br>  good luck.|`|xK2IMLPLaa	Yes, they are symptons. Get her to take a pregnancy test.
kaqPSgTVaa	There is no way other than seeing a doctor or taking an at home pregnancy test. Most women do not get accurate results until 14 days after ovulation or sex.  <br>  <br>  The Dollar Store sells FDA approved accurate tests. If you have a dollar you have the money to test. I used one and got a positive right away.|`|jgtfWjE4aa	if you want me to be completely honest with you, really the only thing you can do is wait for your stomach to get bigger and/or harden.<br>  <br>  i knew i was pregnant before i tested because EVERYTHING smelled by 5 times and i could smell food from a mile away...my breasts were very sore also.<br>  <br>  don't trick yourself into "feeling" pregnant<br>  a lot of women do that!<br>  <br>  just give yourself some time but if you TRULY believe you're pregnant stop drinking/drugs/smoking now...just in case.<br>  <br>  good luck i hope you get whatever you're wishing for.<br>  <br>  BY THE WAY...the first test i tested with was $1 at the dollar tree...i'm sure you can find four quarters somewhere! don't forget you may need some change.<br>  anyway the test was accurate...then my boyfriend and i went to walgreens and picked up $15 tests to be sure...and they were also positive|`|qitXGd0qaa	No way to know for sure without a test. <br>  <br>  Check the dollar store, they usually carry $1 pregnancy tests and if you're past due on your period, they'll work just as good as a $15 drug store HPT.<br>  <br>  A Planned Parenthood clinic or your local health department may offer a free test. If you aren't pregnant, they'll offer to give you an exam and birth control.|`|7IHMjy2caa	Nope, you need to test. You can buy cheap ones at wal-mart that work just as well as the expensive ones, they just don't have all the neat digital displays. <br>  <br>  When I was testing, I got a 2 pack for 4 dollars.|`|sAbah6dTaa	they have tests at the dollar general for 1 dollar that will work, that's what i buy, or you could go to the doctor, those are really your only two choices of really knowing.<br>  <br>  good luck.|`|17cd02c243ad95cd0a7ac5eee0305905aa	Go to planned parenthood i think they give them for free.|`|SJ9lOnCOaa	no, taking a test or going to the doctors is the only way, unless you want to wait and see if you dont get your period for a few months, but then again its still not a for sure answer.|`|sXCSVFBaaa	The only other way is a blood test through your doctor and that takes 24 hours to show. Seriously, a pregnancy test is not that expensive. Go to wal-mart and get one.|`|EUTRJqCsaa	no. you need to take a hpt or go to the doctor to find out.<br>  <br>  or maybe find a free clinic somewhere that can test you.|`|QCUPeW8aaa	Go to the dollar store ...and buy a test there they have a $1 and a $3 test.<br>  They are just as effective as any name brand test.|`|Ccq8zEcnaa	Go to your local public health unit and ask them to do a urine test on you. Most public health units will not charge you.|`|wkd5CMNaaa	No. <br>  And they sell tests at the Dollar Store, if you can't afford that, you shouldn't be doing having sex.|`|gPg7qYGIaa	going to dr and getting him to do test lol<br>  there is no other way its home test or dr test
pnppmAF8aa	yeah, but the worst menstrual cramps u have ever felt and will ever fell...they just keep getting closer..mine was like 2 minutes apart|`|c271e0d140cbe1902cabe87b6f0e3485aa	Yes, mine did, but much much stronger!|`|ca9dEvSAaa	Yes. Really low and in the back sometimes.|`|0844781bb7790202c3eef84c190b3e2daa	At the beginning they do but they get stronger and last longer and get much more regular.|`|EUTRJqCsaa	mine didn't. maybe at first, but when the bad ones started they weren't like anything I've felt before.|`|fc6ea8b86526b74940932c4e482c4842aa	mine did|`|AA10338839	let me tell u the truth as raw as i can contractions hurt like hell!!!  No period paid i've ever felt can ever compare to that trust me prepare yourself|`|ZCSIrQduaa	mine didn't - they felt more like an extreme tightening in my abdomen
AA11327039	I'm so sorry to hear there might be some problem, weather or not the doctors said not to worry, I know you're probably worried sick.  I've been there.<br>  <br>  When I went in for my 20 week ultrasound, they tech. saw two things wrong.  One thing they saw was fluid on my child's heart and the other thing they saw were several...several placental lakes.  I was so completely worried sick thinking I was going to have a sick, deformed, baby full of problems.<br>  <br>  Well two weeks later we go in for the level 2 ultrasound and they did in fact see the placental lakes but they actually said "Why did your doctor send you to us for this?  This is nothing at all to worry about, in fact they are so common that nobody cares about this anymore.  I can't believe your OB hasn't seen this before, who is this guy?"<br>  <br>  As for the fluid on her heart, he said that it was gone.  He explained that sometimes if mom gets a little cold, virus or something, the baby gets sick too.  He said that the baby was probably sick with the same cold I had....and maybe it was even so mild in me that I didn't notice anything at all...maybe a day of sniffles or something.......anyway the fluid was gone and  her heart was just fine.<br>  <br>  This child is now almost 4 years old and has been the most remarkable healthy little girl ever.  She is smart and healthy and perfect in every way.<br>  <br>  So anyway, I really hope my story relaxes you a bit.  I'll pray for your little baby and that things go well at your appointment next week.
7IHMjy2caa	Been there, done that, have the 3 year old to prove it. <br>  <br>  A real man who loved you wouldn't tell you to have an abortion or he'd gone. A real man would support you making the decision and would stand by you. <br>  <br>  That's why I've been living with a man who is not my daughter's father for almost 2 years now and he couldn't love her more if she was his.|`|EPaYoJaiaa	What a way to say 'I love you' huh? 'I only love you if you get rid of the life you helped create that is now growing inside of you.'<br>  <br>  Sounds like your high school sweetheart is also no good. Get rid of him and start focusing on a happy healthy life for your baby.|`|LKIhUMCgaa	that baby isn't just a part of ur ex b/f...that baby is also a part of u. i'm pro-choice, and i think it's up to YOU to decide wut to do, don't even think bout wut he wants, bc if u end up getting an abortion not wanting to, it'll ruin ur guys' relationship later bc u'll end up blaming him for it. so make sure u think things through before u make the decision.|`|J3JClsuQaa	I agree with the rest of the posters... He is being selfish, thinking of himself and not you.  If he hasn't had much time to deal with this, then keep talking to him.  Tell him you want to have a child with him, and still can.  But you're not aborting your baby.  If he still won't understand and wants you to go through a situation that can scar you physically and mentally for the rest of your life, then he is NOT worth it.  Please don't make a decision based on his feelings, he is being very selfish right now.  Good luck and God bless.|`|9IFF0vIoaa	As far as an abortion...you should weigh your options & even think about adoption.  If your sweetheart was so "sweet"...he wouldn't be pushing difficult medical decisions on you.  And he wouldn't be pressuring you to have his child, while you are pregnant with someone else's.  If you were to have the baby, would he leave you just b/c the baby isn't his?  If he loves you...then he loves ALL of your, including your baby.  He can't pick & choose.|`|4A8lGwYJaa	please before you have an abortion read my question.... hope it helps you change your mind....<br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=Ah2axFLNhrRpbgbggyBjoC_sy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090220135214AARPQoW">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|H2IhRXIIaa	Wow, leave him for saying that. if he loved you, then he wouldnt care. At least you didnt get pregnant while u were with him...|`|W6S6WpsNaa	Nobody can tell you what you should do.  You have to follow your heart.  I have 2 kids from a previous marriage, and it was really abusive.  When I got out of that marriage, I worked and supported my 2 kids.   He never paid child support, and the courts won't do anything about it.  Anyways, I have since remarried, and I had a baby a year ago with my new husband, and we are expecting again.  My husband tells everyone that he has 3 kids and one on the way.  He loves the 2 just like a biological father does.  Just thought I'd share that with you.  Again, you follow your heart, and it will be alright.|`|c271e0d140cbe1902cabe87b6f0e3485aa	I don't know what you are going to do about your situation, it seems to me that you are in a lose - lose situation.<br>  <br>  Sorry.<br>  <br>  I am much older than you, but when I was young, we were encouraged not to have babies with men who were not our husbands - it seems like a good idea to me now that I read so many questions from young girls - how about not having a baby with anyone who has not married you?  Its just an idea.|`|KNxs4PrZaa	sorry i know its hard but even though its early, you are a mom now and you have to put your baby before a man.  who know if it will work out with him either, dont make life changing decision based on a boyfriend, and truthfully he isnt all that sweet if he would want you to go through such a painful and harmfull experience.|`|ki5hZbcTaa	if he says he will leave you, then he is not worth having around. I left my son's father when I was 2 months pregnant and fell in love with an old friend of mine. He said he would be there for me and my baby no matter what. We are now married with a child of our own and he wants to adopt my oldest.|`|kKsPYFSgaa	he is being manipulative and its your baby if you dont want to get an abortion then you shouldn't be with him because if he loved you he would be happy with whatever decision you make.|`|ca9dEvSAaa	Remember NO ONE can force you to have an abortion. Please look inside your heart and follow it.|`|sXCSVFBaaa	Then he's clearly not worth your time. Keep the baby if you want to. That's what I would do.|`|AA10312653	i say keep the baby...if he cant appreciate a life in the making ...then he isnt worth it.....he should want to love the baby and help raise it with you...........i say keep it..|`|s0qmSDIWaa	sorry to say but u did a very big mistake my friend. well now u need the solution right? for tht pls let me knw tht ur sweetheart is ur husband or boy friend
4YfehneDaa	If you got 2 lines, is the test line darker or as dark as the control line?  if so then you WILL ovulate within 24-48 hours.  If the test line is not as dark as the control then you don't count it as a positive yet. Are you testing twice a day, once after 11am and once in the evening?  I get my tests from www.babyhopes.com they are pretty cheap and have very helpful and detailed instructions.  i usually go through about 3-6 tests per cycle.  I start testing a few day before i normally ovulate.  its best to test twice a day so that you don't miss a positive result.  Also, after 11 am b/c the hormone (which peaks in the am) doesn't show in your urine until later in the day. Good luck!|`|oqUlYXqtaa	it might mean you already ovulated...if you have regular cycles (you get your period every 28 to 30 days) then you'll ovulate around 2 weeks after ther first day of your last period, hope this helps, you can learn more about this and ask doctors online for free, try fertilityties.com<br>  good luck!|`|oHNrktxTaa	I suggest the easiest one to use is the Clear Blue Easy digital OPK sticks. They are so much easier to read than the ones with the lines & trying to compare colors.<br>  It is either a O or a smiley face:) <br>  Usually when it picks up your LH (lutenizing hormone) surge it is telling you that your best time to conceive is 24-48 hours from the positive.
SEzIkGNiaa	Start by handing out flyers to neighbors/people you know with children. If you don't know any, you could ask people if they know anyone that needs a babysitter. On the flyer put:<br>  <br>  Name<br>  Number or Email<br>  Age<br>  Rates<br>  Experience<br>  Availability/Flexiblity<br>  <br>  **Please do not advertise over the internet, as it is very dangerous!<br>  <br>  Good Luck!<br>  <br>  :)|`|bmoCpcdraa	check with your state law i think your to young to watch other peoples children i hope i helped|`|AA10988719	some good ideas is to make a flier on your computer and put them up in the neighborhood you live in.  go around to some of the houses on your street where you know they have little kids, introduce yourself and tell them you would be interested in babysitting.  Also, a service I am familiar with is called phonebabysitter, you fill out a profile on the internet and you go into a data bank and people can access your information and give you a call when they need help.  HOWEVER, as a mother myself, if you go with the profile on phonebabysitter, please show the site and registration to your mom/dad before going ahead with it, that is the responsible thing to do and everyone wants a responsible babysitter.   To check out the phonebabysitter, read this article.  It might give you some other ideas too!!  good luck.|`|Ke9gAvJTaa	Hi there! <br>  First, Get certified! <br>  Parents LOVE when there kids are certified.<br>  Next, Just post a few posters in your library. No creaps really would go there. Or ask your libraran to recommend you to the little one's parents.<br>  Good luck.<br>  Hope I helped!<br>  Emma.|`|Y6jOPMboaa	Ussualy the local brothel can send out a siter quick when i need them for cheap too and not to metntion the after perks
UrZ8SFpqaa	Hi there,    Just forget about him; there are so many other guys out there. I remember being in a similar situation as you when I was fourteen; this guy I was with was a total jerk. I eventually ended it with him when I was fifteen and he kept crawling back. It was painful to watch, but he really hurt me a lot.    I ignored him throughout high school and since then my life has been so much better. I'm in college now, happy as can be!|`|ejJD6BBXaa	u will cry 4 him but i think u should move one babe its the best thing 4 u|`|PExOJJLgaa	He's probably mad and trying to ignore you because he's embarassed that you'd say that to everyone but him.  I think he might've gotten his feelings hurt when you acted like..    "yeah...so?"    he mightve gotten insulted by the way you asproached the situation.|`|rh12tX8Naa	He's probably just hurt because he found out through somebody else that you want to break up with him. You should've have talked to Kyle first. You should've went directly to your ex. If your boyfriend was thinking about breaking up with you and told your friend instead, wouldn't you get mad about it?|`|FZQ2KHDvaa	Breaking up was stupid.  His supposed 'immaturity' could have been responded to as a test of the relationship and, working it out.    Jumping ship because of someone's faults doesn't solve anything.    It still means, you can't cope with the slightest imperfection in a boyfriend.|`|wluJx79taa	I think you kinda embarrassed him, hes probably upset.  and is showing it with his anger toward you.that's probably why hes mad with yah.  If you don't feel you can work the relationship out then talk 2 him again, end it civil.  and just move on.  -Good luck (:
coj54cacaa	Anyone who goes through in vitro fertilization after having 6 kids already is NUTS!!!|`|gwuTKiNXaa	no it's not normal at all and it's just crazy she has to be in this for the money and that is it|`|00ddc7f7cc561904db032288ec417cc6aa	It is crazy because honesty what kind of reality show would someone watch with a single mother who took full advantage of her parents?  Her parents lost their home because they were not only paying their bills/housepayment but also the bills/housepayment for their 33 year old daughter and no doubt financially providing for their six grandkids as well. The oldest kid is 7 years old. To me it just doesnt seem like it be as interesting. At least other large families that are featured have older kids who can actually do some cute/interesting things. What are 8 newborn infants going to do but cry, poop and sleep?    This lady has no story as her mother said she was baby obsessed since she was a teenager. Always wanted kids did not want to get married. Ok no problem there not everyone wants to get married and one can be a good single parent whether by choice or they end up being a single parent by other circumstances.  However one should be able to take care of their kids this woman clearly can not afford to even take care of six kids, let alone 14 kids. She should have used this settlement money to provide for the kids she already has not bring 8 more into the world.  What this woman has done is completely irresponsible and selfish.  Her mom even said that when the babys come home she is leaving so from that I take it neither of her parents will be there to help since her father returned or will be returning to work in Iraq. It may be cruel but I think we need to stop aiding people who clearly abuse the system at least have them at the very back of line.|`|BY4ZVyRHaa	she had to do this for the media attention. what woman in her right mind would have invetro when she already had 6 children? she knew she was having at least seven more kids and thought it was fine? i don't know. people will do just about anything to be famous these days|`|0aVHTRAEaa	I think this woman did this for the media attention and for money.  Ive been hearing reports that she is shopping her story for 2 million.   This nut case probably sees shows such as Jon and Kate plus 8 as well as the others programs that showcase families with multiple kids and thinks that she can get it on the action or have some type of reality show with 14 kids.  I think the woman is a totaly dumba$$, 14 kids, no husband, no job living at home with Mommy and from what I understand filed for bankruptcy a couple of years ago.  So the good taxpayers of California will have to save her sorry A$$ and take care of all 14 kids.......California cant even afford to give tax refunds this year, I saw a news story this morning on Fox that tax refund checks will be delayed to Californians....what a crock, so people that are working and pay into the system will have to wait for their refund while idiots like these rape the system.  I think the doctor that conducted the procedure should have his medical license revoked.....|`|U55NCXmUaa	this woman is crazy.  and her doctor is an idiot for transferring that many embryos.  an article i read said that all of her kids were conceived through ivf.  after knowing that she can get pregnant through ivf, why would a doctor risk multiple births (especially since she already has 2 yr old twins).  i remember having to sign a selective reduction form - if we didn't sign it then they would only transfer 1 or 2 embryos.    she's a moron and her doctor's a joke.  now we have to pay for it.
62hGVNhoaa	Neighbours have forgotten what it's like to be kids.  Tell the kids to try and keep their voices down and not to antagonise the grumps, however, if they take it as far as the police, chances are that the police will side with the kids, it is still legal to be outside playing so long as they are not causing damage.
mhSjwuntaa	I've been ttc for 8 months now. It really is hard month after month. I have 5 baby showers this month alone to go to. Everyone around me is pregnant...just not me. You're not being selfish...just human. Still it shows you are a good friend by trying to be supportive of them. You're happy for them...just sad for you. No harm there.|`|OY1y0HIvaa	It's natural to feel this way... I have been trying for almost three years and nothing.. Some of my friends have married and got pregnant right away and around October and December everyone had kids...  Everywhere I turned there was a baby or baby shower or something.... I keep thinking that my day will come but so far it is not here...lol  I just have to be positive and try my hardest to be happy for everyone else.... I sometimes break down and cry and I am not the happiest for anyone including myself...  I can't help it!!!  but there is hope!!!|`|AXEqOEloaa	No you are not being selfish, but after two years of trying you really need to see your doctor.|`|Pxe5jVpPaa	No u r not selfish. U are just going through normal emotions a lady would go through.But I suggest u go to a doctor and seek help for TTC. It'll only help.
0VHolTVEaa	Its too early to tell, wait another week or two and take another test. That should give a more accurate answer. Also see another doctor if she was rude, dont let her be horrible to you|`|gwuTKiNXaa	the blood test is only thing that would detect the pregnancy at this point. you may ovulated late which is causes all of this. I was the same way last month. nothing showed yesterday I started seeing spotting and now I'm on.. I was going through everything that you were. twitching and everything kept having cramping like I was about to come on and everything nothing.yesterday I was so shocked because I was so sure that I was pregnant. I'm still waiting to hear back from the doctor because I did get a blood test on friday. Maybe I'm still pregnant and it's just too early for anything. That is the same for you some people can detect the hormone until after 8 weeks|`|zlJYZMGMaa	If you were pregnant you would not produce 3 negative test results.|`|x4uGfC4oaa	You're probably not pregnant, but you should find a different doctor. If there's something wrong with your body, it needs to be checked out.|`|ezMoS0mqaa	Unfortunately, the doctor does know what shes talking about and you may not be as in tune as you think. Have you been pregnant before to know what it feels like?  There are other causes of a missed period including ovarian cysts which would also cause that twinge you describe.  Also if you are trying to conceive, it's easy to convince yourself that you are pregnant even if the signs say you aren't. I know because i've been there and done that, the exact same as you. I didn't have a period for four months because of cysts.|`|VRxAgYyGaa	Has the doctor thought about, ectopic  pregnancy? Blood test is the accurate way to go it can even tell the doctor if you were at one point, if you are and the hormone is not in urine, yet. How far along you are and if you need ultra-sound to check you tubes. An ectopic preg. can kill you if it ruptures and you can't get to the hospital fast enough and is extremely painful.
d5ec0d14b20f77a346c8dcc04807a042aa	if u started taking different prenatals some of them have stool softeners and that might make a change, could also be that ur body is getting ready to deliver and it is starting to have minor contractions|`|AA10390690	it's different with every lady and what they experience but i had the most trouble about middle of my pregnancy going to the bathroom... i started to have the more loose bowels toward the end of my pregnancy though. no worries.|`|IFqY2w1Paa	Lucky you! I'm still struggling with constipation and I'm almost 35 weeks pregnant. Are you drinking more water and eating more fiber? I try that, but it doesn't seem to help. It doesn't sound like anything is wrong with you, dear. You're getting better! Some women get constipation worse in the third trimester, but it doesn't happen for every woman like that. The cramping is either from your bowels working more lately or the weight of your baby stretching those ligaments.    Good luck and congrats!|`|9vgZNLP8aa	Everything is normal so don't worry. I find I have to go the the bathroom more because of all the pressure as the baby gets bigger. Honestly, for me constipation gets worse if I'm not eating right. As long as I'm eating a good diet and drinking plenty I find myself going number 2 more often without the constipation or problem.
jXZeoPAwaa	you babys foot can be pushing against it mines did i was in agony   hope you get on ok at docs
AA11100368	if he can talk, tell him you don't understand/can't hear screaming and if he needs something he will have to tell you what it is|`|AA11981363	well, that was long LOL sorry , I know how it goes, I have my own 2 yo drama queen. I just tell her I can't understand her with all the whining and screaming and tell her that when she has calmed down I will pay attention and walk away. This means that in less than 2 mins she is looking all over for me, not whining, not crying and saying "mommy I want a xyz" or at least pointing and saying "I want that". He knows the words, make him say them, don't rush to get everything for him. When he points tell him the right name of it "oh see, you wanted a xyz" and repeat the name several times. I know it is hard.
xK6wehG7aa	As you know from Mason's pictures, he is a very serious little man. So, he just stares at people. Then they talk to him and he keeps staring, then they get uncomfortable! lol I hope he's going to be really smart and not a serial killer!     Maybe when he gets a few months older he'll start flirting too. Sounds like you have quite a little ham on your hands.|`|qrfJ0ffiaa	Oh, the happy people are out today! haha..  Well I don't have a son but I have a daughter, who is the ame with men, when her aunties and uncles visit, she is only interested in showing her uncles her toys. She shows off and blows kisses etc to them too. It is so funny.    When we go to restaurants etc she always stares at men on different tables, it can be quite embarassing sometimes when she doesnt stop staring at them and showing off. I always apologise lol... but they never mind because she is so cute!|`|nHpd4lRXaa	My son is the worst flirt ever. If I'm holding him is shrieks, has a lop-sided smile, and burrows his head into my shoulder. If he's in the stroller he waves, has the same lop-sided smile, and babbles. I have no idea where he gets this behaviour, because it's only women, never a man, he just stares at men, nothing cute for them. Like he doesn't give a hoot about men, only women, and he'll actually follow a woman with his eyes.|`|UYfqzCoMaa	My son blows kisses, but it's only to women that he knows. He cocks his head side to side and and gives his adorable smile. I think it's adorable. Why are you so concerned? It's natural for boys to do this. You are not and are never going to be the ONLY woman in his life. Sounds to me like someone is a little jealous of these other women that your son gives attention to.|`|58b352907ba2def5e2248c3df2e55128aa	That's cute! Landon will look at me, my MIL or the little girl I babysit and say hey then blow us a kiss. It's adorable.|`|Qz3sii2caa	Oh yeah lol my eldest is a HUGE flirt. All the ladies love him, I don't think he's ever cried or been fussy with them. He's nice to the guys to, but he doesn't flash the pearly whites for them.     I've got a 6 month old who is currently following in his brother's footsteps. *sigh* it's adorable but gosh... they'd flirt with their kidnappers.|`|zQWNb6neaa	My son is 3 and is fine tuning his skills still! He was quite a flirt as a baby and made most people melt by flashing them with his big blue eyes and gracing them with a smile ;). Even now he will chat with the ladies, just two days ago I was buying pants and another women was next to me picking something out and Riley told her "Oh, that is cute!". He also invited an ER Nurse home with us to share a bowl of ice cream (amazingly, this was right after they gave him two staples in the back of his head to close a deep laceration!). She was quite flattered. I have a feeling he is going to be a charmer just like his Daddy.|`|1270a2c558de1c5ce444bf6f3447f4beaa	That sounds so adorable!!!  My son is the "professor".  he always gives a very serious face to people, and inspects them from head to toe.  It is hysterical!  That is why we nicknamed him the inspector.  It takes a bit for him to warm up enough to give someone a smile.  Everyone comments on what a "serious little guy" my son is.  I always say he acts like his daddy!  LOL      Gees, I guess some people don't have a sense of humor!!!!  I always say I'm the only woman in my son's life, and joke about no girlfriends until he's thirty.....I'm OBVIOUSLY kidding!  Ignore the uptight answerers, they can't even take a joke!|`|2F5HNPqPaa	I can't believe how seriously some people take simple questions... they seem to read into it too much and start throwing accusations.  I don't understand how some people can be so desperately self-righteous.     Lukas does the shy smile and sometimes I swear he flutters his eyelashes... he seems to do it to all women.  Lately he's been sticking his tongue out and/or blowing raspberries at men.  He had vaccinations yesterday and stuck his tongue out at the male nurse, screamed at the needles then 5 seconds later laughed and stuck his tongue out again at him.  I couldn't believe it... I was expecting tears all the way home!|`|lGcpXteaaa	Get ready for when he turns 18! hehe  No seriously that's too cute!    I don't have a boy but my girl is a flirt too. She really knows how to work the crowd and i can pretty much guarantee she's going to be the class clown! Shes only 9 months so i'm getting worried!    My best friend has a boy at 12months. We swear they have something going on between them, he's the only baby Mia sits down and plays with. He once 'kissed' her...well more like sucked her face and accidentally bit her :(   Lets hope that keeps her away from the boys in the future!   haha      Why are some people so uptight?? I'm confused....|`|EHY3FnAmaa	LOL. That's so cute!  Ryan is only 4 months so I dont think he "knows" this behavior, but he does do the smile and grin thing!|`|AA12057835	OMG yes!!!  It's great when we go out to eat or something because all the waitresses just think he's SO cute.....then he goes and does his flirting thing.  Needless to say, we get great service lol|`|x4uGfC4oaa	I work at a children's clothing store in my hometown, and there are many babies that come in to the store who are total flirts and their mothers say so. It's a normal thing if many baby boys are doing that.    Don't be the mother who thinks no girl is good enough for your son, even when he's twenty years old and ready for it.|`|vSLHaTFHaa	My son respects women.|`|DIZKlxNraa	Mine does that too. He is 8 months now, but is sick at the moment:(.|`|bd22ca32eb55bc06eaa923b22bd0e54aaa	Yes! Especially at the Dr.'s office. He loves the nurses! I should probably be worried if he's like this at 7 weeks!|`|1df275facdab3bf8f20a968ba4673b17aa	That is too cute. I've noticed my son gets giggly when little girls are around him.He smiles from ear to ear when they are around.|`|CoSdW7xQaa	lol omg yes!  my son is the same way, such a ladies man lol.    & you're right, some people dont't have a sense of humor =/|`|NC1yS0H5aa	not my son but my daughter that is now 18 months. she has been flirting like crazy with anyone that she can catch the eye of since 5 months old. i definitely think it is just them trying out what works best to get smiles and attention from others while we are out. my baby is such a social butterfly and the complete opposite of me. i always try to avoid conversation and eye contact when we are out. i guess she just is like that all by herself without learning it from someone.|`|BypjotRpaa	we are gonna be in so much trouble later!!! LOL    Logan is the same way.. he is 11 months old and walking..trying to keep him away from the ladies is really a challenge.. he does the head tilt, blink-blink, waves hi, and blows kisses!  once he's got their attention, he walks over and chats away!  he also kisses the baby girls at daycare..|`|irP2yTMWaa	Oh yes my son is a flirt.At nursery (he goes 2 days ) he sings when he wakes up and all the baby girls crawl to him and he smiles and laughs at them and they stay with him till they get him out lol !! He loves kisses and cuddles with the ladies.He is such a tart I hate to think what he'll be like when he'd older!!! xx|`|5Ppmmy4qaa	my son is almost 6 months old and has been doing this since he was 3 months. his twins sister does look away thing its soo funny. the girl will start talking to dylan and give that smile and his whole face will light up and then they will say oh twins.. and start talking to denise and she will look at them and then turn her face. its sooo funny. now my three year still does it too. but he likes to put hands on.. we have had to punsh him a few times for hitting the girl on the butt. (we don't even know some of them..) lol|`|X4ZBrRD7aa	OMG yes, Juliace is such a flirt. We go to the bowling alley a few times a week and there are always girls there and he always gets their attention. His newest thing is running past them and falling/dropping his cup, he will look right at them and say "uh oh" and smile.  I also try telling him that im the only woman in his life but he just doesn't listen. LOL.  I guess the saying is true that boys are men from the day they are born.|`|PBI3tCKaaa	Yes!! Ezekiel is three months old, but knows how to work the women.  He will gurgle to them while flashing his dimple and then he smiles and burys his head in his shoulder.  He is absolutely ridiculous! I just hope he isnt like this when he is 18-then i will have problems! haha.|`|LhvKTYftaa	Lucas is very much the same!  Although, he definately prefers blondes (honestly, and my enitire family is brunette).  He spots a blond woman and he turns on his 'groove thang' as my hubby calls it (loser I know..lol)    Since he was a baby he had these powers...I suspect that I will be chasing a lit of girls away from my house with a broom as he gets older.  No little hussy is taking advantage of my baby boy!!      :-)  lol..|`|3CVfUiiJaa	Yes Daniel is also a flirt.  He does this smile, then looks down or away still smiling.  It's very cute!  I don't know where he learned it though lol|`|p2Njf5gBaa	Oh god yes, he loves the ladies.    He loves to flirt with my brothers girlfriend, he absolutely adores her.  Its so cute, he will tuck his head against my chest, and then peek out and smile at her and giggle, and then tuck his head against me, and peek out and smile.    He's such a cute flirt, I don't know where it comes from, but he definitely didn't get it from daddy...lol!|`|aJLx0nhNaa	I think they figure out pretty soon what behavior pleases people and makes them pay attention and smile at them.  My son  flirts indiscriminately with both men and women.|`|bYhqPOtwaa	Oh yeah! Brendan says hi and smiles at every woman. And if they start up a conversation - OMG does he turn on the charm! LOL
aJjV5b95aa	When she is a day care she might be more attentive about when she needs to go because she does not want to get embarrassed and also he friends are probably being potty trained to. When she is at home it is a different story she is much more comfortable in her surroundings and  will probably not be as embarrassed if she makes a mistake. It may also be an attention thing and no I do not think it is abuse.|`|SnQvsOPwaa	Well then, I guess she's not really potty trained then is she. Why in the world do you want your daughter to run around in soiled clothing? Why do you want to push getting out of diapers so badly? It doesn't make one bit of difference in the long run.|`|NwTggQ2Baa	Well I have 2 year old twins and I am working on them but they are not even close to being completely potty trained! SO i first wanna say good job for that! I think maybe it might be because she knows you better then she knows people at day care so she doesn't want to get embarrassed or maybe get in trouble. I hope this helps    best of luck    Stacey|`|Vw7Ji0zUaa	yea don't do that...well that's the same with my niece i guess they know that no one will change them so the have to use the bathroom idk but you should leave her without the diaper and only leave here with the choice to urine or poop on herself or use the toilet.....because once you put on the diaper she i going to do it in it...i wish you luck!|`|9DQjfmFvaa	I think in the morning it's easier for her to use the bathroom instead of in the afternoon.  Believe or not, my daughter is 16 months, I started introducing her to the potty at 8 months.  I did not force her or made her sit up the potty, I showed her what it was used for.  Now that she is 16 months she is able to go in the morning but not at night.  Toddlers have to really have control during the night too be fully potty trained.  If you give your toddler liquids try to stop 1 hour before bedtime.  Good Luck!!!  And good job.
DRb4Qlypaa	Not if you take a Early Response, they can tell up to 5 days before the missed period. But your chances to getting an accurate result are better if you wait a few days.|`|zJv8LA5Yaa	Depending on the test & how far along you are.  Tests measure hCG (pregnancy hormone) levels, so it depends what you level is & how sensitive the test you take is.|`|U6rCN4R8aa	i'd say wait nine months, then see what happens.|`|NrV65TKxaa	I'm due saturday too! have you taken a test yet?|`|ed052b6f800dc43932558f491194a7b8aa	i used the first resonse ept that tells u upto 6 days b4 u due and got poitive results i then went on to do another 8 tests because i was so sure it couldnt tell me that early!!  so u could try|`|uRuoINt0aa	hi, dear..    i would like to ask you your LMP..if you remember & if its the same date today or after one or two day i would recommend you to test that very day...i did it that way and got a BFP..!!    hope this helps you..and you get the results you want..
vSLHaTFHaa	No I delete questions because I know more than all of you.    ADD* I don't know why you think it's funny.  I AM smarter than all of you.|`|UUpsa35Daa	The same thing just happened to me...a woman reported my question just because i had her previous question as an example and she didn't agree with my view on it. I was completely within all of the terms and violation regulations...i wasn't offensive or insulting in the least bit. She just didn't agree with me.    Oh well, if she wants to act like a 5 year old, that's hers and her family's problem. I could care less.      Edit: It does bother me how people can be so immature as to report people because they don't agree with you. It doesn't take a genius to know that when you're dealing with people from all around the world OF COURSE there are going to be differing opinions. Which is why most people post here, because they want differing opinions and differing points of view.     If people can't handle other people disagreeing with them, they shouldn't be in a public forum. It's no secret that things can get a little heated here, they need to be able to brush things off. This is where the saying "if you can't handle the heat, stay out of the kitchen" can be used.|`|ZadTQtJaaa	It drives me crazy when I get reported for answering a question, and the asker doesn't agree with me.  If they don't want open minded opinions... then don't ask the question.    I have reported a few people just because they were so rude and obnoxious and being ignorant.  Otherwise if somebody disagrees with me, so be it... I come on here to see what others think.
p2Njf5gBaa	Back when I was pregnant, I got good advice about breastfeeding, I had a whole bunker of advice saved and stored up and some troll that was stalking me finally succeed in deleting my account.  Its sad that these trolls don't know that they are really messing with mamas that need advice.   I also have received good advice on teething, how to handle colds, help with MIL's, and just about everything under the moon.  I also seen really great links with info.

Or is Jervis the surname? :S    I never thought of Caleb as a girls name. If you reverse it you more or less get Bella. That could be quite sweet.    If you do use Caleb as a first name (and Jervis is surname) Marie, or something else soft would sound nice in the middle.  So for example names like -Marie, Sophie/a, Amana/Amanda.    But really it is totally up to you and your partner! Ask your other kids if they have any ideas!

Caleb for a girl?? or are you looking for a girl's name and a middle name. Well if your thinking about Caleb for a girl I might reconsider, as it is a boys name. Kids will make fun of her, not even considering the confusion of people looking for a boy when someone calls her name. If your just looking for a girl's name try the top 1000 names of 2008. Skip the top 50 as they are too popular. As for middle names if Caleb is for a boy: Caleb Lee, Caleb Dean, Caleb Alexander
hr24wI0daa	Everyone fluctuates weight even when you are pregnant. Thats why you always hear not to weigh daily.|`|KMtd5gr0aa	Could be many things... Did U have a bm after u weighed urself a full bladder. Eat a good mean or drink alot be u weighed in at 130? God i wish i was 130  imma PIG compared to U
vue9NOhYaa	They will put in the cath after you are numb, so you won't feel it.  An indwelling catheter drains your bladder continuously, (it's connected to a bag)  so you don't actually voluntarily  pee at all. It's not embarrassing ... it's just part of the package.|`|Qz3sii2caa	They stick the catheter tube in your urethra and it sort of siphons the urine out from there. You don't actively go pee, it just drains. I've had two kids, both with epidurals and hence catheters. The first birth the nurse was so good I barely felt her put in the catheter. The second birth, it hurt but it wasn't unbearable (by then the labor pain will overshadow most the other pains you may be experiencing). Once it is in, it doesn't hurt.     As for embarrassing, that's a matter of opinion. I wasn't embarrassed by it, it's not like people were watching the catheter bag going "oh look it's filling up she must be peeing". LOL it's totally fine, it's better than peeing your bed.|`|DDIBEvUTaa	i was unable to pee for several hours due to the pressure of baby's head. but after i got my epi a catheter was inserted- it was just in long enough to draw out pee w/a syringe then removed. it shouldn't hurt w/an epi. i was too relieved to be embarrased|`|8oAlBL91aa	I didn't get one while pregnant or in labor actually I have never heard of that. But I have had one to check for an ovarian cyst and they are not pleasant. They burn and you are very aware that it is there, then after it's removed then you feel like you have to pee for hours.     Why are you so worried about what's going to happen when your bodily functions are normal? The doctors are not going to be disgusted by that at all it's all normal plus your not going to know it happened. Your going to be in a much more worse position to worry about what comes out. There not going to point out the fact that you peed or pooed. I have no idea if it happened to me and I could care less if it did because I was more concerned about my baby boy. So don't stress :-)|`|1f440895db82d46ea39724bf6ad660e1aa	I had one inserted and never felt it because I had the epidural. Once you have the epidural you have to have a catheder (sp?) inserted. You won't be able to feel when you have to urinate and that is why they give you one. It's not embarassing at all.|`|tmh42R6Caa	Mine was put in after my epidural, so I didn't feel it go in and I didn't feel it come out.  Also, you don't realize that you're going, you just do.  Because I had a c-section, I had an epidural for over 24 hours.  I didn't feel ANYTHING while it was in.|`|EHY3FnAmaa	yes I had to have a catheter because I was numb due to the epidural. I could not feel if it hurt since I was numb lol.  and honestly I didnt care if it was embarassing at the time!|`|remZ5gDUaa	I had one with my second..they gave me one because my baby was crowing and my bladder was full.. (I DID NOT have an epidural) that's not the only time they use em.. i didn't feel it.. they put a tube inside you and the urine just comes out.. and when your in pain from labor and your business had been all out there, there is nothing embarrassing at that point..|`|oXzHvsBpaa	If you are having an epidural then yes you will have one. They put it in because you have no feeling in your legs and can not walk to the bathroom and you also can't tell when you have to go because that area of the body is numb. They insert the tube and the pee just drains out. No it doesn't hurt and you really don't feel it because like I said that part of the body is numb. No its not embarrassing at all remember that these doctors and nurses have seen everything.|`|kOmS5hCJaa	only if you have c-section!  and you will not be thinking of embarrassment when you get to that just getting your baby out! good luck|`|0nb1rQhnaa	You won't care.  :)|`|DLDweOcYaa	They will only give you a catheter if you decide to have an epidural.  I had one when I was in labour.  It was a little uncomfortable when the nurse put it in but it didn't hurt.  Once it is in you don't feel like you need to pee because it goes in your bladder and it just releases any urine that's in there and you don't even realise it's happening.|`|955YoHvVaa	I had one put in because I had an epidural and couldn't get out of bed..they only do it if you have epidurals..and I didn't feel it going in nor did I feel it while I peed--it doesn't hurt coming out nor did I even see the bag..they put mine under the bed and nobody mentioned to me seeing it so I doubt you should worry about it.|`|RqcLxDesaa	I was catheterized only when it was decided I would have a C-section. While in labor, they will give you a bedpan. I had my cath while conscience, both in and out, it was uncomfortable but not painful. The worst part was feeling like you need to urinate the whole time and then relaxing and letting it flow. Good luck with your birth. You'll do fine.|`|d5ec0d14b20f77a346c8dcc04807a042aa	shouldn't hurt, and no reason to be embarrassed they deal with weirder things than catheters every day, and unless u have something like a spinal block/epidural won't have a need for catheter    Hope u have a quick delivery with minimal pain and ur baby it a beaut!|`|BE9cjcxgaa	they put it in after you've had an epidural, you don't even know it's there and you better get over being embarrassed about things, when you're in labor it seems like everyone in the hospital gets to check you.|`|PYSMK0JBaa	I had a catheter after I received an epidural. It didn't hurt and you don't even know you are peeing while it is in. When I didn't have an epidural, I got up and went to the restroom when I needed to go.|`|1df275facdab3bf8f20a968ba4673b17aa	yes they put in  a catheter. i had already been given the epidural so when they put in the catheter i didn't feel a thing. i also never knew i wa peeing.pretty funny experience|`|4YfehneDaa	i didn't have one permanently inserted they just did it a few times to empty my bladder during the end of my labor. i had an epidural but it didn't work, so it HURT LIKE HELL!!  it was one of the worst parts of labor.  it was soo painful when it when in and out.  i assume if your epidural works it wouldn't hurt.  its definitely not embarrassing peeing like that b/c at that time you really don't give a crap what they are doing b/c you are so focused on labor.  i am a VERY modest person and i was buck naked during my delivery and i didn't care at all!|`|b87b85aa4ddf7d0f2ab7f0a07b240470aa	you won't feel it because you get the epidural first and you are still numb when they take it out....I have had them before kids so yes they aren't fun but in labor they aren't a big deal.|`|aJLx0nhNaa	I believe that they only insert a catheter is you're having a c-section, like I did.    It's a tiny tube inserted into your urethra that goes to a bucket underneath whatever bed or stretcher or table you are on.  Mine was inserted while I was numb from the waste down from my spinal, so I barely noticed.  But it in there for about 24 hours.  It did not "hurt" exactly, but it was uncomfortable.  I was extremely relieved when they pulled it out.    In terms of embarrassment, there's so many people in your business when you have a baby, I think most people just forget to be embarrassed.    Edited:  Apparently I'm wrong and they give you one when you have an epidural.  I had no idea, I didn't have any pain relief until my c-section.|`|YuVSDBkzaa	I didn't have one put in me and I know it's not mandatory. In fact, about 30 minutes before I started pushing, I felt like I had to go pee so the nurse actually put an adult diaper under me because she didn't want me pushing while on the toilet. I was in quite a bit of pain at that time so embarrassment at that point wasn't an issue. My mother did have one put in her because the doctor told her to push and she didn't realize she needed to go. She ended up spraying the doc and he got pissed and jammed a catheter up her. She said it was incredibly painful but what he did was completely wrong. Doctors and nurses have seen it all so I wouldn't be worried about it. Just tell them if you feel like you have to pee.
60b853fe7d4335e1b74668b328b358b7aa	I am full of questions (as you know, lol).    I have a pretty good idea, considering this is my 2nd time around but I will probably still ask to confirm things like the amount of sleep needed, eating habits, teeth, and things regarding his motor, social, and communication skills.      Connor has been VERY healthy and Aidan was the opposite so I'm not used to only seeing the doctor for well child check-ups but am loving it.      Connor goes in 3 weeks for his 1 year check up so I don't know his weight yet.  If I were to guess (which I'm pretty good at, considering I ship things at work daily w/ no scale, lol), I'd say he's around 22lbs.|`|xXnFx6qLaa	From what I can remember (my brain is foggy today, I have a headache) the 12 month check up was just normal for us.  The only real questions I had was about turning his car seat around and getting rid of that nasty formula.      He weighed right around 21.5 lbs at that check up.  (I know, I know, he's a tiny boy...lol)    ETA - Uhhh... typo this morning too.  He weighed 20.5 lbs, not 21.5.|`|58b352907ba2def5e2248c3df2e55128aa	Landon's 12 month appt. was just like his other well checks. The doctor checked his iron levels, looked in his ears, measured him, checked his circumcision, asked a whole bunch of questions about his development and he got shots. He weighed 20 pounds.|`|gJrHBtp1aa	My son's is coming up soon too and the only things I'm going to be asking is he's still not interested in babbling. I brought it up at his 9 month apt, and the doc wasn't concerned. But he's almost 12 months and he still doesn't say anything at all. He doesn't even try.    I'm also bring up he's still pigeon toed, again i brought it up last apt and he said once he starts standing and walking it will correct itself, well my son is walking and he's still got it.|`|68c6B8dRaa	I have a healthy child too and not much chit-chat with the doctor. "When do you think the first visit to a dentist should take place?" is about the only thing I've ever asked.|`|MxhNzW7Oaa	Riley was 21 lbs & 29.5 in. (i think) at his 12 month appointment (that's a long way from 3 lbs 10 oz at birth!!).     The only question I had in regards to him was if the pedi wanted to keep him on formula (due to being premature) or if he was ready for whole milk. His pedi said whole milk was fine as he has caught up quick. I believe he got 2 shots (Prevnar & DTP, I think).     His pedi also asked what milestones he's doing (walking, talking, sitting up...etc...)|`|ee2ce7f4a4671d3a72fbfecf0348ee49aa	ask about immunizations ... not just does he have any due .. but "when are the next ones due?" and "can you give me a sheet with all the immunizations my child will need and how old should they be to get them" this will get your dr thinking and will help you stay on top of your childs appts in the future
C4bxnKDXaa	he will be ok. Let him be. Every child develops differently...if you compare him to others you will keep banging your head on a wall and think something is wrong wiht him.

My twins are 9mths, my smallest one crawls, sits up, rolls, and pulls himself up...  My biggest one sits and rolls, and my twins are identical!
KV7OGaJbaa	My eldest son didn't crawl, went straight from moving around on his bum to walking. He walked at 11 and a half months, after cruising around the furniture for ages. If you moved something out of his reach before then he wouldn't even try to get it. My other son, who is 1 just now, crawled really early and cruises around the furniture. He doesn't have an interest in walking himself, although he does stand himself. I guess crawling is a much faster way for him to get around. I wouldn't worry about it, all babies are different, develop at different times. Enjoy it while it lasts!|`|2s5WSVbPaa	My second daughter skipped crawling altogether and didn't walk until she was 23 mths.|`|ZTuBl0qLaa	Some baby's wont roll over and a lot of times they go right from laying down to sitting up. It really all depends of the baby. Every baby is different and develops at different times. If you are truly concerned i would suggest the next time you go to your doctors appt ask the doctor what he thinks.|`|BkS8LQdkaa	idk|`|KkSW6EViaa	they will learn at some point don't worry, a lot of babies skip their milestones  but you never see a fully grown man crawling because they never learned to walk in time.    :)|`|I6dcRgD6aa	Just call your Dr. & see if you should be concerned. I know I would not compare the two babies. A boy might be up & climbing & running & active while a girl might sit & read books that the boy can't read. So they are going to be so different. I remember years ago we had neighbors with twin boy & girl. The boy was built like a football player & the girl was so petite. They are fraternal so just like you might have a child that is so different from any other sibling these two will be the same way. There are charts you can find on the internet to get an idea about the milestones so I would look through a bunch of them rather than just one to see if you really have something to be aware of or if you just need to see them as individuals with him having the physical lead.|`|FcHplZtQaa	This is normal, every baby is different and will develop at their own pace!    My twins are 9mths as well, my smallest one sits up, rolls over, crawls...  My biggest one rolls over and sits, the weird thing is since my smallest one started crawling last week, my bigger ones started getting stuck sitting, before if you sat him down he'd be able to roll and lie down, now he just cries and acts like he's stuck?????    My twins didn't sit up, when they were about 8mths I thought Why??   So I sat them up, and lo and behold they sat up fine, roll your little girl on the floor, you never know she just might start doing it herself...|`|0VHolTVEaa	I wouldnt worry all babies are different. My baby is 11 months old and cant crawl or walk but he can roll over and sit unsupported. Your daughter probably doesnt like it on her tummy but i wouldnt worry all babies like doing different things|`|yUyx2nhmaa	h ha, my boy is 9 months and can only crawl backwards and toll over to get around...he is also just starting to pull himself up. i think he might skip crawling forwards, as he's not seeming to be trying to go forwards, and has been going backwards for weeks!    ignore saint - obviously no idea about babies. some are walking at 9 months, some take nearly 2 years!|`|UrrRgmDwaa	My nephew skipped crawling. He went straight to pulling up. His doctor said it was because he was a really big baby. It's harder for him to crawl, roll, etc... There is just more weight to push around. My little girl rolled a few times, then wouldn't roll for the longest time. I read an article saying sometimes they do it once and it scares them, so they don't do it anymore. I started playing with her rolling her over and smiling and making a big deal out of it. Within a few days she was rolling over again. Anything you want them to master just practice. That is what they do in physical therapy for kids with developmental problems. They just do it over and over again. Hey I wouldn't worry too much. I've never met a "normal" adult who can't roll over. hehe|`|OHq5gSjJaa	Yes, my daughter never learned how to roll from her tummy back onto her back.    She is now 7 months and is crawling and can get herself into a sitting position, but I still have never actually seen her complete a roll.  She would try so hard, but couldn't figure out the mechanics of how to do it.    Both of your babies sound just fine!|`|9EW08emXaa	The milestones a basic measurements to watch for proper muscle and mind development.  If your girl can sit, but doesn't roll over, that's actually fine.  They use rolling over to measure whether they are developing muscles to help them sit up.      I actually think that at each well-child check-up, the doctor should give parents a list of milestones to look forward to in the coming months.  I understand that they don't want to make parents feel nervous if their child isn't doing some of them, but with so many different things for parents to do these days, it seems that some of the milestones just don't happen because baby isn't in the situation to achieve that.      With one of mine, the nurse asked if my son could say 'no'.  Well, we had really not used the word no with him, so of course he couldn't say it.     My daughter also skipped rolling and went straight to sitting.  Our doctor said it was fine...you can actually lay with her on the floor, or sit next to her and help her roll over. Let her pull on your hand just so that she gets the idea of rolling. She will do it on her own when she needs to (she may see a toy she really wants and will realize that the way to get it is to roll).    Have fun!|`|AtXoQlY3aa	Of course! Mile stones are only a generalization of what children should be doing, not something conceate. Look at the entire picture with your children, I am sure they are just fine. If you have concerns always talk to your child's Doctor. They are always the best source of information.|`|4YIUxSlYaa	My daughter skipped rolling over.  Never interested her.  She is 8 months now and pulls herself up on things, crawls and gets about easily.    I wouldn't worry.|`|8QGt44O3aa	Aren't kids supposed to be walking by the age of like... a year or almost?      wtf?|`|4dd9374df6045331049807f2de428a9aaa	My son never crawled. He went right to walking. Even when I would try to put him on his belly, he would roll right over. He always wanted to be held upright or play in his bouncy chair.|`|psjyBi6iaa	My daughter didnt crawl! She kind of shuffled and just walked at 9 months instead of crawling! Also neither of mine would use a potty just went straight on the toilet!|`|955YoHvVaa	My daughter didn't roll over, crawl, or sit up until she was almost 10 months and by 11 months she was walking..I wouldn't worry they will do things when they want..who knows I know babies that don't crawl and go straight to walking I wouldn't worry if they are going to do it they will when they are ready.
FslUZLsyaa	i like them all.<br>  my fave is Paige Lisa (Lissa?)<br>  <br>  Hope I Helped!<br>  Madi xD|`|S6bsdP1Vaa	Paige Lisa- not really a good choice....maybe Lisa Paige..that sounds better!<br>  <br>  Pierce Armando- do not like Armando but love Pierce<br>  <br>  Peyton Finn- no likey on Finn but Peyton is great for both but i love it more for a girl<br>  <br>  Payton and Peyton are the only ways i know how to spell them!|`|34VXCyvVaa	Paige Lisa -- a very awkward-sounding name.<br>  Pierce Armando -- the two names don't go well together at all<br>  Peyton Finn -- ugh, what's with the popularity of Finn?  It's a better name for a fish!|`|ot0TqzSvaa	Paige is cute but Lisa REALLY doesnt match.<br>  What about Paige Riley? thats a very cool name. If you dont like Riley, look for another middle name.<br>  <br>  Pierce Armando is different, and certainly not my taste, but i kinda like it anyway. dont know why bcuz i usually hate these kind of names, but it sounds so cool.<br>  <br>  Peyton Finn is an ugly name for either gender (sorry) if i were to use Peyton, i would spell it that way, and use it only for a girl. Finn is an alright middle name, but i would only ever use it as a middle name, and definately for a boy. Peyton Blaise is best middle name i can think of.<br>  <br>  hope i helped.|`|o9Ckf0h4aa	Lisa PAIGE SOUNDS MUCH BETTER! peyton finn is a great spelling for a boy. payton/payten(especially) for a girl.peyton finn is great for a boy. but payten finley would be better for a girl.Love those names!|`|RMppfinbaa	Paiton ( girl)<br>  Armando (boy) <br>  I'm not really a fan of two names, sorry.|`|r0HYuHubaa	Soz they dont go -they dont even have a ring to em|`|j0Jkq4z2aa	paige lisa is nice, but lisa doesnt go as well with it as some other names. if you have to stick with it:<br>  Isabelle<br>  Madelyn<br>  Madison<br>  Audrey<br>  Abigail<br>  Charlotte<br>  Peyton<br>  Gabrielle<br>  Alexandria<br>  Michaela<br>  Catherine<br>  Christine<br>  Caitlyn<br>  Ashlyn<br>  Kaelin<br>  Jordyn<br>  Juliette<br>  Jasmine<br>  Brooklyn<br>  Meghan<br>  Mackenzie<br>  <br>  most of those go with lisa.. theyre all modern, and i think a longer first name would go good with lisa<br>  <br>  pierce armando<br>  thats an awesome name! just love it!!!<br>  <br>  peyton finn<br>  for a girl, i do love peyton, but definitely not with Finn. Not so fond of Finn for a boy either, and I don't really like Peyton for a guy either. So I like just Peyton for a girl, but neither for a boy, but Finn's ok for him, I guess (middle name)<br>  <br>  hope i helped! : )|`|qUS9Zwl6aa	Paige is a nice name, but I don't think Paige Lisa flows well, it sounds better as Lisa Paige. I don't like Pierce Armando, and Peyton Finn is ok, but it feels boy not unisex. IF you wanted to keep it unisex you could do Peyton Finn for a boy and Peyton Fiona for a girl.|`|m6EUv8zgaa	Paige Lisa - like<br>  Pierce Armando - don't like<br>  Peyton Finn - like Peyton but not Finn<br>  <br>  I like your spelling of Peyton|`|tGGVeW3yaa	I'd go with Lisa Paige for a girl<br>  Pierce and find some thing different then Armando it sounds like "A Man Made Of Dough"<br>  And I hate the name Peyton Finn wether it's for a boy or a girl|`|OXxKTM6vaa	I dislike all of those names (no offence, just my opinion).|`|4mSpN3Rxaa	do not name anyone Lisa.<br>  They all seem to be bitches. <br>  all the other ones are fine.|`|7XIWtNr6aa	I like the first name, hate the middle names.|`|ch3O0I9Paa	Paige means "young" in old English and Lisa means "God's promise."<br>  <br>  Peirce, descended from the name Peter, meaning "rock," and usually means "son" while Armando means "man in the army."<br>  <br>  Peyton means "royal and noble warrior" and Finn means "strong."<br>  <br>  I hope the meanings of these names will help you decide which one you like the most. Good luck.|`|mI2BAbUjaa	I don't like how the middle name for Paige ends in an "a", either that or I do not like how the middle name is 2 syllables while Paige is 1 and the middle name sounds longer, I'm not really sure!<br>  I don't really like the names Pierce or Armando, sorry.<br>  I like the name Peyton Finn better than Pierce Armando, but I still don't really like the name, I'm sorry.<br>  I hope my opinion helped!
CuCrGDuRaa	I get that too sometimes.  My doctor said it's heartburn or natural stretching that comes with being pregnant.  Your body is just making more room.    As for the last answer, DO NOT use a heating pad during pregnancy.  My doctor made it very clear to never use heating pads or heated blankets because they raise your body temperature which can harm the baby.|`|aWPQXoIAaa	If it's a sharp pain and it wraps around your back, it could be the baby pushing on your gall bladder. It's very painful, no matter if I was sitting, laying down or walking...it hurt. Nothing you can do, just use a heating pad.
w0eRRsoVaa	I would avoid names that sound similar to the kids who already exist, for instance, Jarred and Jeremy are a bit too Jer-.    Jason, Jackson have my vote as Jack can be a nickname.

e0eb82b689e1db392eb51c89982ed115aa	mine still does it and you can see her hands and feet on my skin poking out every which way, but she wont turn herself to the head down position yet and I am 33 weeks. Right now as I type she is punching me in the ribs and its not feeling so great. It gets worse and then gets less as you reach 35 to 40 weeks. Some babies are way active some are not. Depends on what your eating, you sleeping habits, and there activity level.|`|b978f631fc787a963337206aa3833370aa	Could be he's just heading into position! Yay!    Mine was heads down at 18 weeks already, but about a week ago I felt SO much movement I swore I was giving birth to an alien. I hope it's still in position because I do NOT want another c-section. But anyway, babies have sleeping/waking cycles, sleep starts, and are just itching for more room at this point, so you'll feel like you're having triplets when it's really just one. :)     Just wait until the baby decides to press its head into your bladder and cervix and you feel like your bladder is going to explode ... that's always a fun sensation!|`|63c46881d0aa0376d34c1858ee0f160faa	totally normal my daughter kicked me in the nose in the next few months it will happen more then it will start to get tighter in there & it wil be less spinning & more boxing like ur bladder when my wife was about 7 months she ate a cherry corgel she had waves going across her tummy|`|yUyx2nhmaa	that's normal. he'l stop soon when he runs out of room! it's mad when you see their foot or hand stick out of your tummy!|`|Sk6lrUeXaa	It is absolutely normal.  Babies need exercise, too.|`|em8A42Bqaa	I was wondering the same thing.  I am a little over 28 weeks and the feeling now is WAAAY different from a couple of weeks ago. (light tapping)  Now it feels like she is stretching, rolloing around or something but it is weird.|`|YXRRpodKaa	Hey, I'm 25.5 weeks. I too noticed my boy doing this. Its been about a week and half since he started. I notice around midnight he sleeps on my right side. Can actually see the bump of where he's sleeping. Its so cute. It feels so weird at times! :) My baby is doing the same thing. Its normal, I believe. He's just got a lot stronger and bigger and we can feel their movements more.    :)|`|RmQ7oZfaaa	It's normal and don't worry, he isn't angry, just having FUN and at Mommy's expense! Yeah!! Mine use to do what I called the "Swim" all the time and when they stretched, Oh my, I had to stand up and stretch too just to give them room.  Both my boys where 22" long and still very active. My youngest was still doing the swim on his birthday too! So there goes the myth of the baby getting less active closer to birth!   Make sure you are eating baked or steamed meats, chicken, fish, stay away from red meats as often. A lot of fresh veggies, fruits and exercise as much as possible. You need to stay in shape and it helps your muscle tone too! Drink lots of water, stay away from soda. Kool Aid is ok, that's what I had and only gained 14 pounds with my second baby and he was 7 lbs. and 12 oz when he was born.

9CUaikUEaa	i know, i agree with you.  but a lot of people just feel like the relationships stronger if they get married, because its their way of knowing their partner is prepared to stay with them forever.  but i think its silly that its looked down on not to be married when you have a child.|`|AA11226842	The length of your question says to me you already know what you want the answer to be. You are looking for outside justification. You should be talking to family, friends and a counselor not strangers on Yahoo.  To answer it anyway what a hard thing to do to a kid. They would be the only thing keeping your marriage together if it went wrong. Thats a big load for such tiny hands.|`|sC0NvRzEaa	It also depends on the culture and even the place you live in, in bigger city's it doesn't seem to matter as in towns it does.  To me personally, I don't care, Im married because I wanted to and my mom has a 15+ year relationship with my stepfather, they never got married and they have a baby.   As long as there is love, respect and honesty.|`|ee2ce7f4a4671d3a72fbfecf0348ee49aa	marrige is a way to protect yourself ... it is a legal way to join so that if you do decide to part ways no one is left to fend for themself finacially.  When you have a child you may be unable to work and support yourself.  If you are not married and he leaves he may win in a court of law and take your child because you have no means to support the child.  marrige is not necessary for success but it can help protect you legally.  It also tends to make people think real hard one last time right before they say "I do" ... you can be fine without marrige, but it is fun. good luck|`|XLsnuAqmaa	because it is traditional.  same thing with gay marriage.  it really doesn't matter; people are just stuck in their ways and see it as taboo.  but i agree with you...|`|JnlYIzwdaa	ok. so?  it doesnt make a diffrence! so long as your hapy ... dont give a sam hek bout no1 else!  i think the married one is betta..  juzz cause god made us to make a commitment..  if your not married your man.. could leave you in the blink of an eye and you cant do nufin your stuk with da child,,. he wont be like ohh well now you gotta pay for the ba do this al that., no cause yall aint married and ja nada your all alone!  your married...  and your husband is having an affair you go to court see who gets what?  And there he pays child suport.. .  and u get some time. alone... but BFS and hes gone 4EVA!  MY opinion but wat eva ur choice!|`|E7GwqMotaa	well baby is a huge commitment even more then marriage .....    now , when you are only a boyfriend and girlfriend it's easy just to cut everything and say bye bye and when there is a baby involve the baby will be the one that suffer.    when you married you try to work everything up for many reasons , and it's way more complicated just to get up from marriage and just leave so there is more chance of staying and think twice befor leaving.    of course if love is gone nothing will keep ppl together but still.    and also there is way more weight to couple that is just couple or married for allot of things.    religion way i don't really care but i am one of the ppl that think that baby outside of a marriage is bad .........|`|jojKjhUcaa	Two part answer but simple, I'm 43 with two son's oldest is 21 a senior in college, the other is 17 a senior in high school, my oldest was lived with my ex and her husband since five, and summers and vacations with my wife and I, he's well adjusted, bright with a beautiful future, a lil selfish, he's often expressed that he wanted the time that he thinks his brother got that he didn't, although both families are middle class or slightly above and my wife and other children travel a lot to participate in his life, football games, basketball games, camps, he still feels he got less, the reason is that kids are forgiving but they hold grudges for thing adults deem as trivial, theres is no doubt he resents the fact that his mom and I didn't just leave or new spouses to raise him together, he use to ask when his brother was younger when were me and his mom going to have a brother for him..So marriage is very important to your children and you own sense of guilt later in life.|`|piCOVRC6aa	if you're married then the guy is less likely to run off and leave you alone with the kid|`|8ff3196b10cd4c3afc116407535b3666aa	Not getting married doesn't show that people just "don't need the proof " of their love. It shows a lack of commitment. It shows if one decides to end it it's just as easy to break it off as it would have been a week after dating.     Marriage may just be symbolic in some ways but in others it's a good thing. Marriage shows the joining of two people, shows their commitment to each other. Just because the divorce rate is high doesn't mean the problem is with getting married. The problem is the people who are jumping in and out of marriages as if they don't count for anything. Also marriage comes with some great benefits that just dating doesn't have, so in the long run if you really are in love it makes more sense to be married then not.    To answer your other question, both families you've described seem to have no difference on the surface. But throw a curve ball at each family and see which has a more stable foundation to deal with the curve ball. It's the married couple because they have more than just love, they have commitment.|`|YkseyT7zaa	True, it does not guarantee anything, however it doesn't hurt anyhting either.  If it does not matter, then there is no negatives in getting married.    Do you think of the child that has to respond to the situation?|`|4cc767b496173b3227cf5f9f17efd2b5aa	You're right. There is no difference, and marriage statistics support your point.  Given that divorce is seemingly the option of choice for unhappy couples, if two people are committed and choose to not formalize their committment in some kind of ceremony, then that's their choice, and again, given today's climate, is generally recognized as a viable alternative more and more.   However, let me offer one qualifier: in the best context and representation of a marriage, one assumes that one's family and friends are invited to the wedding not just as gift givers, but as an extended resource for supporting the long-term success of that marriage. It should be well-known by anyone approaching this decision that any marriage will have it's share of challenges. Having an extended support is a huge help for people who need guidance, advice, or just someone with whom they can vent. This does not mean that unmarried couples cannot have this same broad network of support, but it is certainly not built in to the concept of this maverick partnership. In terms of financial security, however, legally, neither partner has any rights to the other's finances should things turn sour beyond any hope of reconciliation. Marriage, then, protects a couple (and subsequently, any children they may have) at the very least, in this regard. Best wishes to you~|`|AA10390690	it's to each it's own...    by that i mean some people follow what i'll call traditions. unfortunately now a days lot of us do not. i know i'm one of those. my boyfriend && i have been together for over 3yrs && have been to hell && back && we have an almost 11mth old daughter together. we both agree that marriage does not have to define our love && we joke we couldn't afford a divorce =] but it's just not something we're both wanting to commit to. if it happens down the road then we'll deal with it then but i don't see a piece of paper or an expensive ring (i do not like to wear any ways) having a say in how we define our love but like i said...    to each it's own|`|5bc21d2d2a57683cdbd5ef3c4094ebc4aa	I agree.  Pretty much all my friends that got married are not divorced.  The ones that are still together?  They never got married.|`|LLeQyWGcaa	i think for some, they think it looks better in the public eye. I know people who have been living with their partner for 30 years. people always ask them why they don't get married and they always say "what for". no one has really come up with a good answer for that.|`|AA11100518	marriage is a legal commitment.  you haven't been together 10 years.  people normally get married because there are advantages.  the reason marriage is considered important before baby is because it's darn tough to raise a kid by yourself.  with two people it's a little easier.  you need help to raise kids.  single parenthood is very difficult.  marriage is a formal way of including and connecting the families of support together.  also there are financial advantages.  the certificate is not the issue.  it's the commitment i guess.  the most important thing is that if you have a baby you can afford to support it and take care of it and someone will be there for it.  that you have a home, money for clothes, food, etc.|`|qZXIm3Ksaa	so that you that you KNOW that the father is committed and won't walk on you. nothing is guaranteed but marriage shows that you're ready for a commitment :)|`|zkTx6iOIaa	My Parents weren't married at all even after they had me and they loved each other more even tho now they are separated as my mum died "/   but it does make a difference , i think people just think it will make there relationship stronger but in fact it does , it just makes them disagree more .   you are not children , you can make up your own mind and if you love him go for it and i hope you both have a happy future together :D   xx|`|FZQ2KHDvaa	It does matter, if they are underage.  Because, Children shouldn't be having children.|`|NVrLg3Bjaa	Well I'm 19 and my fiance' is 30.  He has 3 children, he was with their mother for 9 1/2 years.  He asked her to marry him and she said no.  I don't see a problem with getting pregnant before marriage.  We've been trying since Aug. 2008 and we're getting married Oct. 30, 2010.  We would LOVE to have a child right now.  I really don't hear that much about marriage first anymore, especially from my family.  My mother wants grandchildren so badly and a couple times a week she tells him to hurry up and that I need to get pregnant soon.|`|QePbhS8Caa	Technically, in some states if you live together for a certain number of years as a man and wife would or have a baby together you're considered to be in a common-law marriage.    There are legal benefits, medical benefits, tax benefits, work place benefits that a married couple gets that a non-married couple has to struggle for and/or just will not get. That's why it makes me angry when same-sex couples can't get married. They're missing out on all these bennies because of other people's religious beliefs.|`|YW74O9aNaa	I think being willing to get married shows committment from both the partners.. at least at the time.. it doesn't guarantee that they'll be together forever but yes it does show at least some amount of commitment.   I agree with what you say , that its only the love that matters and it doesn't need any proof. But i would rather follow the marriage tradition. And if there is really no difference between not being married but having shared home, finances, kids etc and being married with all these, Then, why not get married ? :)|`|x3EPqezJaa	I'm not sure what you mean when you say: " a marriage certificate doesn't make this happen (in fact it seems to have the opposite affect if you check out divorce stats)." In order to get divorced, you first have to be married. So while 100% of divorced relationships started in marriage, 0% of living-together couples started in marriage, so none end in divorce. So what exactly are you saying? If you look at divorces of couples who lived together before marriage, vs. couples who didn't live together before marriage, stats show that couples who lived together before marriage divorce in higher percentages.     In any event, while it might SEEM that unmarried couples can potentially have the same committment to each other as couples who are married, it doesn't typically end up that way. It works in theory, but, because marriage in our society has become a symbol of the committment couples have to each other, it is more often the case than not that couples who don't WANT to make committments to each other don't get married. So it's self-selected groups who decide to not marry or marry. Furthermore, there is a difference between married and unmarried relationships. Unmarried relationships tend to have as their foundation a mutual enjoyment in each other. When mutual enjoyment is gone, then the relationship's foundation is gone, and the relationship typically ends. On the other hand, marriage, while it typically begins in our society with mutual enjoyment in each other, has an additional foundation--a shared committment to each other. So even when there are rocky patches, or people aren't having "fun," this committment to stick together means that one is willing to make sacrifices and stick by the person through difficulties, which often arise when one is raising kids, or just plain living.  While nothing precludes an unmarried couple from sticking by each other through difficulties, the fact that they didn't get married, and were unwilling to make committments, is a sign that they don't necessarily intend to stick by the other person.|`|Tc23KWgzaa	I absolutely disagree.  Commitment to each other and to our family is exactly what defines our marriage.  We promised, vowed to be together for always, and keeping this commitment to each other and to God has added an understructure that keeps our relationship strong.  We've gone through some terrible things in this past 24 years, and less committed people would have gotten up and walked away.  (Not necessarily you).    I'm glad you're planning marriage, and you've waited until after graduation to have a child.  These are characteristics of serious, stable, mature people.  Promising to love each other and your children can only make your relationship stronger.    TX Mom|`|FHRfTlCxaa	Well I had my daughter before I was married..|`|aEmdURPTaa	I'd say it is a very personal issue.  But one good reason is financial security for you and your child.  :-)|`|fc201279b728cf66cb3edc5fb588f42eaa	1) Parents pressure them to for image reasons; otherwise it often gives the impression the baby was not planned.    2) Religion; adults are suppose to be married before sexual intercourse.
aEmdURPTaa	Firstly, I would recommend that you take a second pregnancy test.  I know false positives are rare, but it happened to me once.  I got a + one day, a negative on the second day.  Then, I got my period.  That being said, false negatives are rare.  So, you are likely pregnant.  If so, congratulations! :-)    Since you're asking, the first advice I would give you is to really not take too much on your shoulders during the first trimester.  It is the most difficult trimester of all three, because you get to be soooooooo tired all the time!  It is also possible that you'll start nausea and food aversions around the 6-7th weeks, and it's not always easy!  If your nausea becomes really difficult to deal with, there is a great medication called Bendectin, which requires a prescription.  There is also ginger and vitamin B6, but it didn't work for me.    After the first trimester, it usually gets better energy and food-wise!    The other advice I would give you is to read the most possible about pregnancy and having a child.  People around you will throw their opinion at you all the time, especially since you're only 23.  But you'll be the mother of that child, and you need to build confidence and have opinions of your own.      Some great books I would recommend are the following:    From the Sears Parenting Library:      1.  The Pregnancy Book: Month-by-Month, Everything You Need to Know From America's Baby Experts     2.  The Baby Book: Everything You Need to Know About Your Baby from Birth to Age Two  (very complete, covers everything you need to know)    3.  The Birth Book: Everything You Need to Know to Have a Safe and Satisfying Birth  (indispensable  to help you determine what kind of birth you want for you and your baby, so you can draft your birth plan accordingly)    4.  Becoming a Father: How to Nurture and Enjoy Your Family (great book for dads, as it's not just about how to change a diaper, but it covers the emotional part of fatherhood).    These books foster attachment parenting, which in my humble opinion, makes for happier, more intuitive and self-confident parents and children.    From other authors:    5.  The Pregnancy Countdown Book: Nine Months of Practical Tips, Useful Advice, and Uncensored Truths (you'll enjoy the sense of humor)    6.  Ina May's Guide to Childbirth (amazing positive birth stories)    7.  A Child Is Born, by Lennart Nilsson (so you can see developmental pictures of the embryo/fetus along the 9 months of your pregnancy).    You'll also need a good pregnancy organizer, such as "40 Weeks +: The Essential Pregnancy Organizer", by Dani Rasmussen, to make sure everything is ready by the time you give birth.    Books I would really, really avoid are any one from Tracey Hogg (Baby Whisperer) and Gina Ford.  Those are not fact-based and provide really outdated opinions that can be detrimental to your child and to you, as a parent.    I would also recommend "The Science of Parenting" by Margot Sunderland; and The Womanly Art of Breastfeeding: Seventh Revised Edition, by LLI.    Do not hesitate to email me personally if you have any question!    Good luck!|`|5bc21d2d2a57683cdbd5ef3c4094ebc4aa	False positives are extremely rare.  You can pretty much assume you are pregnant, but the doctors office will confirm it for you.|`|PLK1p8cUaa	A false positive is less likely than a false negative.  You are most likely pregnant.  Keep your appointment and good luck.|`|b3892e48ce1ff2d86e671ceef5fd7a83aa	Try taking a couple more tests- including a digital if you can. That spells out the word "PREGNANT" and they are very accurate.     If you got a positive test, you're most likely pregnant. :)     Congratulations :D I'm 24 and we weren't planning ours either. Me and hubby are 36 weeks along and we're pleased as punch. It's going to be okay! Deep breath! If you need support and answers this section is awesome.|`|WgyGipBMaa	no ur prego|`|e0eb82b689e1db392eb51c89982ed115aa	These tests measure a hormone thats only made while pregnant. Its very very very rare to have a false positive. Only if you are going through a mock pregnancy, even etopic pregnancy's will most likely turn up false NEGATIVE at first because of the low amount of HCG hormones. SO I would sit back and be happy if you want it, and defiantly act pregnant by doing all the correct things for now. Take another test in a week and then call the docs and make appointments. Most wont see you till you are at least 8 weeks along or there is a problem.|`|WPI0Z47saa	A positive result is very unlikely to be wrong whereas it is more common to have false negatives.|`|BE9cjcxgaa	you can have a false negative, but if it's positive then you're pregnant...get a blood test to confirm but it sounds like congrats are in order.|`|W0d6NsGBaa	False negatives happen often.......false positives are much more rare. Besides making your drs appointment there is not much left to do. Just start making sure your diet is in good order and if you drink or smoke then stop...|`|CuCrGDuRaa	It is highly unlikely that it is a false positive.  Almost all false positives result from fertility drugs.  It's good that you scheduled an appointment with a doctor right away.  Your doctor will be able to answer your questions and tell you what to expect.  I've miscarried before, but this is my first healthy pregnancy as well.  I got pregnant at 21 and am 22 now, but this was a planned pregnancy.  My advice is to always listen to your body.  Make sure you eat when you are hungry, rest when tired, and drink lots and lots of fluids.  Congratulations and good luck!|`|zJv8LA5Yaa	As mentioned, you are more likely to get a false negative & false positives are rare.    I found out I was pregnant a week before my 23rd b-day.  I also wasn't planning on having children anytime soon.  I was nervous, scared, excited, all kinds of emotions!  My son just turned 3 this past November & I can honestly say he is the best surprise I've ever gotten!    Sounds like you are on the right path with making a doc appt.  It also helped me to read (reliable) websites (babycenter.com sent me weekly emails about what to expect & continued after he was born too).  Someone gave me "What to Expect When You're Expecting" & that was nice to, to have a reference to look up things or see what's coming, so I would suggest getting some kind of book.  I also got a book from my doc at my 1st appt.    Good luck w/ everything!|`|uRuoINt0aa	hi, dear..    i don't think that pregnancy test give you a false positive you should feel happy as mostly the pregnancies are not planned you should find out the correct results when you see your doctor...and things will be really fine..    hope this helps you..!!
NePgB9b2aa	I LOVE Siri! I'm so thrilled to see someone else who likes it! :)<br>  <br>  I'm not fond of Freya though. Too close to the Spanish & Portuguese word for "ugly" (Feia/Fea..prn. "FAY-ah")|`|SJlLdJg5aa	Both are gorgeous names.  I've always swore I was going to have a daughter named Freya--but really I think it's just because Scandinavian names are my favorites.<br>  <br>  Anyway...<br>  <br>  Freya -- A darling name that is very easy to pronounce in multiple languages.  It has the feel of the 'owner' being a girly girl--ribbons, dolls and dresses.  It reminds me of someone who would be intelligent but still interested in the average going ons of the world/day to day life.  I'm not sure if 'Freya' would be really sporty, it does remind me of ballet/dance, gymnastics/tumbling, cheerleading and such though.<br>  <br>  Siri -- I really like this name it seems fun.  The name would be rather difficult for some speakers of certain languages to pronouce though.  This name kinda reminds me of a softball or soccer player.  It seems like the name of someone who was intelligent but was more concerned with other things.  <br>  <br>  I guess that's about it.  Good luck!|`|0sbhjGiraa	Siri|`|1dHe0Hfdaa	Siri|`|BjDJfagmaa	I like Zuri, which means beautiful in Swahili|`|Sob4zaUSaa	I like Freya. It reminds me of Fritos and queens for some reason:)|`|tGGVeW3yaa	I like Freya but it's probably because I know a Fraya|`|dAniZ4ouaa	Siri is so cute! it makes me think of Suri Cruise...Siri Naomi?|`|qTWIoVEraa	I agree that Siri sounds too much like Tom Cruise's daughter Suri. <br>  <br>  Freya reminds me  of a character in a an animated series (Chobits). In the story, she is a beautiful humanoid computer girl that falls in love with her adoptive father/creator. An odd Oeipus-complex type situation plays out. Very weird story, I've provided a link if you're interested. <br>  <br>  That aside, I still think its a beautiful name :)|`|aJLx0nhNaa	Siri is a little bit too much like Suri Cruise.  I like Freya.|`|eBKJRmEgaa	Freya is lovely, but Siri is is really just a nickname for Sigrid. <br>  How about Shiri rather than Siri? It means 'my song' in Hebrew.|`|OXxKTM6vaa	I don't know how Siri is pronounced ............ so can't really comment on that. It must be unusual though for me to have never heard it. Which is a good sign, I hate common names.<br>  <br>  Freya is such a pretty name. I love it.|`|miFe45quaa	Freya is too similar to the word "feia" (it's Portuguese meaning "ugly". It's pronounced >FAYE-uh<).<br>  <br>  So I don't like Freya. <br>  Siri has an awkward feel to it...but I definitely prefer its meaning over Freya.|`|ot0TqzSvaa	Siri is alright but i would never use it for a child. <br>  Freya makes me think of a freita...<br>  they would be ok for middle names, but i not first names.|`|ppE0GtkIaa	I love the name Siri, its cute :o)
AA11222790	You will have 2 ultrasounds if you are not an at risk pregnancy.  The first ultrasound will be done to measure the baby to make sure your due date is on point.  I had mine done at 10 weeks.  I had my second scan done at 22 weeks to make sure the baby was okay and to find out the sex.    I would talk to your doctor about the pain.  My doctor asks me if I've had any bleeding or cramping at the beginning of each appointment.  Therefore, it is important to share this info with your doctor.  Although slight cramping is pretty normal.  But if the cramps are accompanied with bleeding then you need to see your doctor ASAP.    Are you drinking enough water?  You should be drinking at least 8-10 glasses of water a day.|`|AA10762544	You can yes, the bending and walking around is ok, not harmful. For the urine that is dark yellow, i will advice you take more fluids, drink more water it will help a lot.    Good luck with your preg.|`|i9M0U9Meaa	i had an ultrasound done when i was about 8 weeks because i was having pains, you have to have one ordered by your doctor but yes you can. and yes you can be 4 months and not showing what so ever, i know girls who were 8 months and ere barely showing at all lol it just depends on the person. the pain you are feeling is just your uterus expanding and it will be a little painful at first but believe me it will stop, i was having the same problem. if your urine is that yellow, watch what you are drinking, try to drink more water if you have to, and this is also a sign that there might be an infection, such as a Urinary Tract Infection, you'll want to get that checked out because it can be harmful to the baby if untreated. walking is fine for your baby, it gets you the excesses you need while your pregnant, but be careful with bending so much, for yourself, not the Baby, it will cause really bad back problems while your pregnant, instead try squatting down instead of bending! good luck with your baby!|`|98WKYtfwaa	Yes it's possible, you can get one from 6 weeks onwards, the best time to get your first ultrasound is 12 weeks, but i got my first one done at 10 weeks because my dates were wrong, the baby was still perfectly clear though.    But you're not 4 months yet, you've still got 6 weeks to go before you're 4 months. It is normal not to show then though, i started showing at 14 weeks, got bigger at 16 weeks and now i'm pretty much noticably pregnant to everyone in the street at 19w2d. Some don't start showing until 20 weeks upwards.     Pain is normal, as long as it's not agonising or accompanied by blood you're fine. It's ligaments stretching.    The urine being dark is either because you're not drinking enough water or because the prenatal vitamin you're taking (if you're taking one).    No, walking and bending down won't bother your baby. It's actually good.|`|5bc21d2d2a57683cdbd5ef3c4094ebc4aa	Walking and bending will not harm the fetus.  At 10 weeks the doctor might have to do a transvaginal ultrasound instead of the regular one.  They usually don't do an ultrasound until 20 weeks though.  You will be able to hear the baby's heartbeat though at that stage.  I didn't start showing until i was 6-7 months pregnant.|`|42N6I9tKaa	sure|`|VmqOq8Qjaa	Yes, as long as there is something in there, saw my baby for the first time last week and I have only 3 weeks on you!  Walking is good for you, makes the delivery easier, but make sure you sit down when you get tired.  The dark urine just means you are dehydrated, drink drink drink!  As for the belly, I'm still waiting for the bump, but to me I am showing a little.|`|tmh42R6Caa	You can ultrasound at any point.  I had an ultrasound at 5 weeks, but only the yolk sac was visible.      Also, I didn't start showing for a while.  Well, I just looked like I put on a few pounds, I didn't really look pregnant.  Enjoy it!|`|v3LnJycKaa	10 weeks pregnant is fine for an ultrasound you would see the baby, hear the heartbeat everything... umm but your not quite 4 months you are not even 3 yet? an perfectly normal not to show yet... I am on my 3rd baby and didnt show with my first until 26 weeks, 25 with my second, and now at 20 weeks with my third i am still not showing.|`|IFqY2w1Paa	You have lots of good questions!    1) Yes, at 10 weeks, you can get an ultrasound. They might do a transvaginal one at 10 weeks, but for either type of ultrasound, the doctor is able to see baby and heartbeat.    2) Every woman carries differently, and some women are barely showing at 4 months. I knew a couple girls that carried this way. It doesn't mean the baby is unhealthy or small - it just means mama's body is built differently. Your doctor will begin to take a fundal height, which will determine if baby is growing correctly or not. Fundal height is the measurement from the pubic bone to the top of the uterus.    3) Pain happens during pregnancy. Sometimes it's a dull ache, and sometimes it's a sharp pain. Where you are at, pain in your abdomen is coming from stretching ligaments and the relaxing of the pelvic bone. Your body releases hormones called Progesterone and Relaxin in order to prep the pelvis for birth, making it more flexible. This causes pain during pregnancy because of the ligaments it is attached to.    4) If your urine is dark yellow, that means you're not getting enough water. Keeping hydrated is especially important during pregnancy. You need 8-10 glasses of water per day. You actually need more water during pregnancy than pre-pregnancy.    5) Walking is safe during pregnancy. In fact, it's wonderful for your pregnancy. It's recommended that a pregnant woman gets some type of exercise each day, and walking is one of the best. Don't worry about it. =) The only thing you should not be doing right now is lifting any heavy objects.    Good luck and congrats! |`|8mchLCQhaa	You are not 4 months pregnant at 10 weeks! I have a belly and I am 16 weeks. I had an ultra sound at 10 weeks and saw my babies heart beating it was amazing!
by6skUmMaa	It means something to your mum, that's why she picked that name for you.  People who tease you about your name are low life's... They feel bad about something in their life so their way of dealing with it, is to make someone else feel bad. Unfortunately that's you, just because you have an unusual name.|`|uS07WAwcaa	Its not ugly it just sounds like your a 57 year old church going worker woman  I mean Maggie is cute|`|GFzDwIk6aa	Its not really ugly. Its quite cute. My next door neighbour is called Margaret, but we call her Maggie.    My name is Sailor. Sailor Aurora Laker-Gray. That's worse than Margaret. I usually just go by Aurora or Rory. If you really don't like it, try going by your middle names, or a diminutive of your middle names.  Dot  Dotty  Ethie  idk?|`|iMULlxdgaa	well.. it does sound like you were named after your grandmother.  I don't know how they tease you though?  There isn't anything  wrong with the name Margaret..its an older name but you can just tell people to call you Maggie.  But wow Egetha is really ancient old...what's your mom's name?|`|HjiqMDI6aa	I'm going to be honest.    Your name is beautiful but old understandably becauseyou've been named after your grandma.     Magaret- I like it because you can have some cool nicknames  Dorethy- I like it because its very cutesy but I would have liked it a bit more if it was Dorothy  Egetha- Sorry, but I'm not sure about this one! Its a bit too archaic for my liking.   Cantombarry- Well there isnt much you can do about it because its your surname but I don't love it neither do I dislike it because surnames have to be ike that!    I like your first and second name. Not so sure about your third name but the surname is just the way it should be!|`|cn2rvsdOaa	No|`|UJaCObdyaa	My god you sound like you are 75 years old.     Margaret - 1/10 - every Margaret I know is over 50  Dorethy - 0/10 - the most disgusting name ever.  Egetha - 0/10 - gross    I am so glad my parents didn't give me a name like that.|`|FvYqKZSMaa	No.|`|mhSjwuntaa	its not ugly... just a mouthful to say|`|XHZtwfuIaa	Margaret is one of my favorite names, I think it's beautiful. And I love old fashioned names like Dorothy and Agatha. If you don't like it Margaret has a lot of nicknames. You can go by Maggie, Meg, Peggy, Madge, Margie|`|zlJYZMGMaa	Your name is Margaret. You dont need the long string of middle names. It's a nice name. No big deal :)|`|7zVvAzJCaa	Given that your mother has chosen names that are spelt incorrectly, I can imagine you are open to all kinds of ridicule.  Ask your mother if you may change them by deedpoll to the correct spellings so that you avoid humiliation for the rest of your natural life.  Good luck!|`|6SB4ufEYaa	Ehhh.. Honestly yeah :/    BUT.. you could call yourself Maggie which is cute. Or Dottie.     And you can change your name when you're 18, if you choose.|`|8mQVfDRqaa	it's not that bad, just a bit of a mouthful.  at least your name has meaning, and at least your names are actual names!  I admit it is old fashioned, so I can understand why people would tease you, but they're just dumb.|`|kL1HgrBYaa	its a mouthful, could have been shortend to Maggie|`|5NhartQ3aa	Margaret is a good name.....I have a friend named Maggie and I think it's great!|`|fO1ZzPXyaa	I think it sounds sophisticated. Regal almost. Be proud of your name. A lot of older names are coming back. If your friends tease you about it, they're not very good friends anyhow. Anybody else, why should you care what they think? I think it's wonderful that you were named after your great grandmother. That makes you a sort of legacy for her.|`|WoxHi03eaa	You have a beautiful name! At least your name IS actually a name, not like Shazeeka or Paxamie or whatever they're going for these days! Maybe you would prefer to change the spelling of your name. Like (original spelling) Margaret Dorothy Agatha Cantombarry..?    Or you could go for Maggie as a nickname for Magaret? You have been honoured by being named after your great grandmother -- she was clearly a special lady (as you've been given her name) and she is very important to your mother.     Put it this way, would you rather have your name, or a made up bunch of letters for a name? Some of the most ludicrous names I've heard recently are couples naming their kids Adolf Hitler, Aryan Nation (look this one up in Google is you're too young to understand it [Hitler should be obvious]), and, unbelievably -- "@". Not "At", just a symbol...@.|`|kN4EaiUDaa	its alittle old fashion for my liking, but after you get out of school no one will tease you on your name and could honestly care less what you name is. don't worry about your name and accept it as thats who you are and remember your obviously named after a special lady or they wouldn't haven chosen her name for you. hang in there
z74wSbQoaa	I think the one-on-one attention your child would receive from grandmum is better than any outside service.  Look at it differently.  Try not to be jealous, but take comfort in knowing your child is completely and totally cared for.|`|mRQxlNH5aa	I don't think it's wrong. You have a perfectly legitimate reason behind not wanting your child to be with her all the time. Something you could do is have grandma watch your baby 2 or 3 days a week then put your child in daycare the other days. That way he's not always spoiled and has an opportunity to grow used to be around different people.|`|NFt3h7dHaa	Ugh.  This does not sound like a fun situation...unfortunately I haven't been in it.  We live thousands of miles away from either of our parents and I'll be staying at home with our baby, so I can't relate to this.  I do still have a few thoughts I hope you find helpful.    Your concerns are totally valid and you should continue to be honest with your boyfriend about your feelings concerning the matter.  Ultimately, the decision is between you and him.  His mum, your mum, or the queen's mum have no say about what you do with your own baby in the end.    Perhaps a good compromise might be to "accept her generous offer" (notice, that's very different from "let her have her way"--I would make that VERY clear if it's what you ever decide to do that it is YOUR decision, not hers) for the first little while.  You might actually feel more comfortable leaving your baby with his/her nan for the first little while you go back to work than a total stranger, it might give you a great grace period for the adjustment of being away from your baby all day.  Nan will be able to focus 100% of her attention on the little one 100% of the time--that would give me a lot of comfort knowing that my baby wasn't lying in a crib crying for who knows how long before the daycare provider can finish changing the nappie of the baby she's got her hands full with at that moment.  And, it's a lot cheaper!    However, it's perfectly valid for you to only do that for a certain period of time.  Whatever age you feel comfortable with, you can make it clear from the beginning that you only want to do that for a period of time and that you want your child to be in a more structured environment during the day, and also very important, with other children.  Ie: daycare.  And it's up to YOU.  It might be her first grandchild, but it's YOUR first baby.    That's what I would do--but I would very highly recommend that you do what YOU and the baby's father feel is best.  Come to a decision together and stick to it and make it clear to everyone that the decision is YOURS and no one else's.  It's YOUR family.    Good luck!|`|80Zlwifsaa	You would rather her spend five days a week with a stranger then with someone who has bonded with her and loves her?|`|23MPcnNqaa	First of all....be thankful that your child has a grandparent that is that concerned about your child.  I have twin boys who never got to meet my mother-in-law because she passed away.  Second....get used to her!!  My mother is CONSTANTLY telling me I should do this or I should do that with my kids.  We argue all the time because she tries to contradict me as a parent.  And a lot of mothers and mother in laws are like that.  If you are that concerned about how your mother in law will take care of your child, try to sit down and talk with her about it.  Explain what you want for your child (as far as guidelines and routine).  If she doesn't respect your wishes, then I would go for the daycare/nursery.  You have to at least give her a chance though.|`|JsqMSU9Haa	As long as you trust her to take care of the baby sufficiently, if I were you, I would let her watch the baby full time.. and then when the child is old enough to socialize around 2years old - put him in part time preschool where they will be at least some structure and guidelines.  I hate to tell you but daycare/preschools are not sufficient disciplinarians either.  Your child will know the difference between grandma and mommy.|`|dpCsTIEIaa	Honestly, be appreciative that your child will have a grandparent like her. I have 2 children and it's like pulling teeth to get heir grandparents to watch them for an hour. But all in all,  I understand you situation. Explain to her that it is important to you that your child go to daycare just because it helps them in the long run to be with other children and become independant. But do understand also that your child will not receive the attention at daycare like he would with her.|`|mXO2TOUjaa	No one will take as good of care of your baby then you! After I had my first child I was able to be a stay at home mom.  Is there anyway you could work part time? If I were you I would let the grandparents watch the baby then sticking the baby in day care and letting total strangers raise the baby.  You would have to tell the grandparents that they could watch the baby but on YOUR TERMS! You tell them the rules and if they don't follow them then think of day care.
0lnamekJaa	Your teen years are when you should be allowed to do almost any stupid thing you want to your hair, clothes, and make up.    If you want to do it and it isn't permanent... What is the harm...    You could go out dressed up in clown makeup and a bright red wig and floppy shoes if that is what makes you happy...    Just remember... We ALL regretted what we did in High School when we grow up and look at the photos...    Just go look at your parents yearbooks and see how stupid THEY look...     What is "Cool" today will make you cringe in horror in 10 years... But other then future 'what if's' GO FOR IT!    As long as you keep pants on... It is your body... Go for it!|`|0781f56992749b6d9de1b9aa61424bbbaa	If the school has rules against wearing makeup, then I would not allow you to wear any.|`|aLAmvX5Naa	Nope. Not a chance. I don't mind concealer or lip gloss, but I can't imagine why a 15 year old needs so much eye make up.|`|LLeQyWGcaa	a little mascara, that's it honey.|`|wZYPFtL9aa	yes, i would as long as you wouldnt put a ton of it on and make sure you make it look good:)|`|Ya2j2ENaaa	If you aren't allowed to wear makeup then I would cut out the eye shadow and liner because it's a dead giveaway that you are wearing makeup.  I would ask you to commit to non-color lip gloss - just something with a good pinkish shine to it, and only a HINT of blush, instead of foundation/concealer I would also do a good tinted moisturizer with loose powder over it - looks more natural.  And be sure not to use a clumpy mascara!     Then I'd probably help you put it on...but I am a makeup artist (and a mom of one girl).  I'd also insist that you clear it with me before you go to school every morning and no complaining if I asked you to take some off.    Good Luck!|`|np58wJjsaa	not if u can get in trouble. well maybe concealer|`|42N6I9tKaa	yes....  it doesnt sound ike it is antthing to over the top|`|YqNSqUPvaa	I would allow you to!  honestly it doesnt hurt anyone....  so yeah!|`|AA10390690	i see nothing wrong with it personally.|`|qZXIm3Ksaa	if you wanna ruin your skin then SURE.    too much make-up is really bad for your skin. lipgloss and mascara maybe eyeliner and that's it. :||`|36IsVhu5aa	r u sure ur gonna go to school or is it a prom party with all this makeup on?!!! i never even put all this makeup all at once when i went to work and we were supposed to wear very formal.. go to school without any makeup, as simple as that. it might be ok to have some lip gloss, but thats it!!! (if u were my daughter ofcourse)|`|agTCqkLDaa	If you could get in trouble for it, then most likely, no, I wouldn't.    If it were at my school, then that's fine as long as it's natural.  We started wearing make-up (LIGHT LIGHT LIGHT make-up at 13) and our school didn't care.  I mean, we're talking a little mascara and lip gloss and on *some* days we could wear eyeshadow.    I think at 15 that's your decision personally, but I wouldn't want my daughter getting into trouble over something so silly.|`|rWV2lRZpaa	yes!  i wear all of that except concealer, foundation, and blush...  but everything else, i use!!!  but i use SO LITTLE of it, it IS noticeable but BARELY.  Just dont pack it on your face...  use just a tiny bit.|`|yUyx2nhmaa	yes..but only very natural stylie...maybe not eyeshadow|`|K5uoaetaaa	No, because it breaks the school rules, and by sending you to that school I tacitly agree to abide by their rules.|`|zwaCsOeVaa	You are are 15 years old... Grow the hell up. And put on some d@mn clothes. Nobody wants to see that.|`|Dv43MoGaaa	Nope|`|LXEqtNlbaa	GOD YEAH.! every girl should wear make up when ever they want or if its needed   14 is a bit to young but 15 up is reasonable.!|`|99735a22fbfaab5561850052bda71db5aa	Just be 15, quit trying to be an adult.  Once you are an adult, you never get to be a kid again.  Don't rush to grow up, enjoy the time you have and be a kid for as long as you can.  The reality of adulthood is that you have to take responsibility for your actions, it's not just dress up.|`|XLsnuAqmaa	yes, you are 15.  plenty old enough to wear a bit of make-up.  i would forgo the eyeliner for school and just wear it at ngiht, out with your friends...|`|FEp8330paa	if your not supposed to wear make up at school, you shouldn't. if they dont care any more i would say you could start by wearing a little bit. you dont want to push it and get the reputation for breaking the rules.|`|02023201c466ca1751d4f14fb53cd526aa	No.   Your mom is trying to keep you out of trouble.    Listen to her.  Your lucky to have such a great mom.|`|bWirSb8Paa	why do u need all that make up in school ??  but IF i were i'd say "do whatever u like sweetheart ,u control ur own life not me"|`|Q40ekcUxaa	yeah foundation is normal and lip gloss, maybe not the eyeshadow though that's a little bit too much for just school. but come one make up makes everyone look prettier maybe you should tell her that : )|`|Kn1PSmN1aa	it really depend on you your an adult now you got your choisces......... some which are bad and good. =)     its AMERICA you can do anything you want. =D|`|FvYqKZSMaa	No.Its not allowed in your school.|`|e0EG293naa	I am a mom and I would say no.  Wait one more year.  But if you insist, try to keep it minimal.  A little mascara & blush.  Maybe powder instead of foundation.  That's it.    And as a mom, I would tell you that your inner beauty is so much more important and impressive than make up.|`|SAMRKyZsaa	I would not if it is against the school policy.  Also I don't thin young girls need to wear that much make up maybe on special occasions.  lip gloss and eye liner maybe daily if the school allows it|`|gAuIixm6aa	Just remember like my mom always told me-- the point of makeup is to look like you're not wearing makeup. I hang out with a lot of guys and you'd probably be surprised that most men find too much makeup a complete turnoff. I hear em talking|`|jL9myhmqaa	nope|`|yper8qYoaa	NOOOOOO!!!!!|`|xde0uuuBaa	Sure. I started wearing makeup when i was 14. :] my mom didn't really care.|`|1nXLHtQPaa	Yeah. Just don't look like a nightwalker or a circus clown then you can wear all the makeup you want... If i were your mom.|`|RtvAu2Hcaa	Nopes.  It's stupid and pointless.    What kind of assassanine school do you go to anyway?    Geez....|`|4dd9374df6045331049807f2de428a9aaa	No I probably wouldn't.     But you can do what I did: take your make-up to school with you and put it on there.     I used to bring entire outfits too.|`|ZKXapKXBaa	I would let you to some extent. youd be able to wear about half of that and not look so fake.|`|3Fma3URSaa	ya but i would make sure you don't look like a sluttt wearing make up    cuz i think just a little bit is fine|`|nLw3hZy9aa	ummmmmm...nooooo.ur probably pretty just the way u r without make up...OWN IT GIRL|`|uXOE0eS8aa	I would definitely allow you but I'm 16 so that doesn't really count.  I wore that much last year minus the concealer, but of course not excessively.  Since your school doesn't really allow it though, I would skip the eye shadow and eyeliner because those are more obvious than the others.  Mascara you cant really tell unless you like glop it on, foundation and concealer- as long as you match it properly to your skin and blend it well it is unnoticeable, and blush you could just have rosy cheeks.  Lip gloss is iffy too.  I personally dont really wear it unless im going out somewhere, but not on a daily basis.|`|vSLHaTFHaa	Yes.  Kids need to express themselves.  Your mother is too uptight.|`|GnXfEdegaa	I'm confused.  If you are not allowed by the school to wear makeup then why would your parents allow you to wear any make up to school?|`|dHExxG2maa	As your mom I would not allow it.  For one it is against school rules.  Just because the teachers turn a blind eye does not make it right.  I also personally don't think young girls need to wear much makeup, but understand the desire. On weekends I would allow you to wear some makeup, but not all of that. To me that much is completely overboard.  I would allow mascara, blush and lip gloss and that would be it in the 14/15 range.  At 16 you would also be allowed to wear eye shadow and foundation.      Sweetie you have your entire life ahead of you and more than enough time to grow up and look older than your age.  For now enjoy this time.  Whether you wear makeup or not will not impact your life forever, really it won't,but breaking with rules just because everyone else does, that could have an impact.|`|V31Vs0nJaa	well 15 is close to 16 u gotta realise that but all this make up just to go to school is a lot ... if you wanna look young still, not like a whore who just wanna f*ck guys then id say use foundation that matches ur skin color, and concealer for the little break outs. if u want eye shadow then do a natural color thats a bit darker then ur skin color... like if u are white then use a light-medium brown eye shadow but dont color all the way up to your brow, just color the bottom on your lid. a little lip gloss would be ok but not a strong color, you also want a light color there. blush, mascara, eyeliner may be too much for school and wanting a non-whore look.    so yea if i were ur mom id let u wear what i just said but the blush, mascara,liner would be a bit overboard. i understand that u wanna flirt with the boys and thats alright for ur age. but u dont wanna sell urself u know what i mean? XD
oXzHvsBpaa	Maybe a few hours. Usually when my son is napping or playing in his crib or bouncer.|`|c4e0f4398cbb2577d252628c76d0781baa	The only time I get on the comp is when Lilah is napping or when she's asleep for the night.  So it really depends on her how long I am on the comp per day...|`|AA10390690	depends on day and so forth. if she's content and playing by herself or her uncles then i may steal some time to get online but it's not excessive i know that. and def. during nap time if i have nothing to do (ex: cleaning)|`|BkS8LQdkaa	idk|`|w5bZ8Hhqaa	Maybe like 30 minutes.|`|kOmS5hCJaa	not a lot i would imagine!|`|QP1ZQqPfaa	Since i don't go anywhere this is my only connection with people. I am a stay at home mom.  I get on when they are taking a nap, or at night time when they are asleep.  At night i can stay on like a hour so in all, all day i do about 2 hours.|`|FHRfTlCxaa	I spend like half an hour on computer everyday but since my husband has to work with computers all the day,he uses computer a lot..|`|AtXoQlY3aa	I don't spend anytime on the internet at home unless the children are asleep. Everybody who has children and who works understands that time with the little ones is precious, and it can be scarce. I try to do all that I can to maximise it.|`|sFPk14Zbaa	I spend about 2 hours all together, I go on for short periods throughout the day to check Ebay and stuff. but then I go on at nyt for bout 1hr n half...I don't mean to. I just wanna go to bed but it calls for me lol|`|umPQv5LLaa	no time they love kids better
oXzHvsBpaa	I would think not considering how dirty laundry rooms are with all the lint and such around and all the dirty clothes. Why doesn't your husband dry anti-snoring methods. Such as a spray or a nose strip. This is one of the sacrifices that you make when you become a parent. In our house anyway the baby comes first.|`|KHZLPldraa	It depends, is there any gas ran things in there?  Example:  Water heater, or dryer?  If there is then it is a no way.      *Another words, if everything is electric it should be fine as long as they are turned off.  But if you have gas appliances the pilot light(flmae) is always on so I would highly recommend another route!|`|GJksrOfzaa	maybe convert another unused room into the babies room. No, it is not safe to put a young baby in the laundry room, even if the bed protects him. put his crib maybe in another avialiable space, that's the best thing becuase just incase he climbs out and get's injuired. it's just a small crib, squeeze it somewhere that the baby is safe in, and that won't disturb you.  hope the nights will be peaceful!|`|yUyx2nhmaa	as long as they're not on. doesn't baby have a room of its own?|`|8tc5Ne3waa	well i have heard of mom putting baby to sleep in the dryer room bc the sound lulls baby to sleep- bt using this as a room... i am not sure if i would like to do that. i would prolly keep hubby on the couch or figure out another arrangement... it does depend on what is int hat room- fabric sheets, detergent, fabric softner, gas ... any fumes are more damaging then hubbys snores... be careful : )|`|AA12057835	why would you want your baby to sleep in the laundry room?  You baby should have a room of his own!  The dust particles from the dryer alone is reason enough for me to not want to keep a sleeping baby in there.  I understand the circumstance, but I would rather keep the baby's crib in the living room rather than a laundry room.|`|umPQv5LLaa	no. are you so dum|`|RqcLxDesaa	I can sympathize, my husband is the same way. I can't imagine why your baby wouldn't be perfectly safe where he is. Gas is supposed to be perfectly safe and the noise a dryer makes is kinda soothing...s long as there isn't any sneakers!
aJLx0nhNaa	I made a suggestion to another question about themed nurseries that worked well for the asker.  Go on etsy.com, find someone who makes children's bedding and ask them how much they would charge to locate the right fabric and make something that matches your theme.|`|fPkqnxfhaa	I couldn't find any bedding sets I liked either. I was looking for a western theme. I just found a plain bedding set that I liked, and buy accsessories that you like (basketball things).
fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	Woah that's a scary situation.      What I suggest is that you wait for the 3D scan, as this should be more accurate? (I assume, I don't actually know).  Then you get those results, assuming you still have more than one opinion and you do not know which one is correct the go through the hospital directory and there will be listings for a social worker and for patient errr... I can't think of what it is usually called but a liason, advocate, or something like that.    First talk to the social worker if you can find him/her.  They will help support you emotionally and act as a liason between you, the hospital, and the doctors.  Then you (and the social worker) will probably go through the administration who will contact the doctors and they should arrange for a meeting of all the doctors involved and you.    Don't give up until you are sure that there either is a problem and your son is going to get appropriate treatment, or there isn't a problem|`|QsIco3Fxaa	I suggest you ask more doctors while you can.  There is nothing wrong with getting lots of opinions, it narrows down the choices actually.    I suggest you ask more doctors who specialize with that.    I wish you luck.|`|tht0DrHsaa	First off thank you for explaining what everything means.  Second there is nothing scarier than not know what is best for your child.  What I would do is call a meeting with all the doctors or a team of specialist. I would have them all sit down and explain what and why they feel needs to be done.  Of course you will have to do what is best for your baby but if you have three different doctors telling different things then you should probably find more doctors and see what they say.  Good luck and keep us informed of how things go.|`|RqcLxDesaa	You poor people. What a ton of stress and pressure this must put on you. Is your child physically or mentally challenged? Motor skills and development normal? Any chance that he could just grow out of it? You know, Drs are always looking at the liability point of view, and are interested in covering their own backsides. For all you know, this is the result of birth trauma. As long as there is no life threatening or pressing developmental issues, I think I'd wait a little and see how things work out. I would be concerned that you are getting such conflicting diagnosing. Good luck and I will keep you in my prayers. I can't even imagine what you're going through.|`|Ojgqd4xNaa	You need to seek a different doctors opinion.  If he does need the surgery then the sooner the better.  The brian grows extremely rapidly in the first year of life, and even though not as rapidly as the first, it grows considerably in the second year of life.  The constriction on the brain can, cause serious problems, including seizures and death.  I would seek another opinion as soon as possible, or even ask to meet with a 3 doctors at the same time.  That way it can be discussed amongst everyone, including you, as to why each of them thinks, ar doesn't think you son needs surgery.  I hope all goes well, and that in fact he doesn't need this, but I'm sure your a strong mommy, and can take care of him no matter what!|`|AA10390690	well... would the 3d ct show you the exact results?? i'm sorry best thing i can suggest is getting another opinion or going for this 3d ct.|`|UrrRgmDwaa	I would find the best neurologist in the country and send your son's X-rays to him/her. In the meantime, I would get 2nd and 3rd opinions from neurologists in your area. Sounds to me like no-one really knows what it is.|`|PYSMK0JBaa	First, I'm so sorry! This must be a very scary time for you and your family. I would suggest finding yet another dr and getting another opinion or 2. Time is of the essence, it sounds like, so the sooner you can be seen, the better. Good luck and hope the third doc is right.|`|AA12057835	Sorry you have to go through all of this!  Go in for the 3-d CT for sure, but if you keep getting different answers, go to a different hospital for second (third, fourth etc) opinions.  Obviously this is not a cold/flu sick case, this is something way more important.  Keep records of every doctor/hospital you have seen/talked too.  In the worst case scenario, you need to know who you can sue.  Good luck to you and your baby!
ddP3klT3aa	Don't worry until you get a positive pregnancy test. You are not stupid for having sex at 16. A lot of people are having sex younger than 16. It does not make them stupid, they are just curious. But then things like pregnancy and STDs happen some times. You will be fine. You can keep the baby or give it up for adoption. All these symptoms you have could be a hormonal change or it could be all in your head. Some times we worry ourselves about the possibility of being pregnant and end up convincing ourselves that we have symptoms that were never there before. Don't worry until you get a test and it is positive. Its only been 3 weeks. I don't think people usually get symptoms this early. Good luck. Also, get on birth control and use condoms, or don't have sex.|`|LXEqtNlbaa	ok have you gotten your monthlies.? or are you due them.? maybe your just hungry alot and you feel sick from eating.?     more signs are your boobs inlarge a lil or alot.  you get a spasific craving   also it could be just you subconciously putting this in to your head making your self beleive you want food alot    iv had alot of scares b4 aswel and im 16 but i got my womenly monthlies so i new every thing was fine  wait for them.!    look up more stuff to make full sure or even a pregers test would do no harm.    hope al will be ok.!|`|iXSoX6Rnaa	You need to talk to your parents about this or an adult you can trust. 3 weeks is enough time for signs to show.

These are all signs of pregnancy, but you could just be scared that your pregnant.. so your mind and hormones go into a state of "being pregnant". I guess you could call it a mind game. That's what happened to me when I was in college a couple years ago. My doctor just said it was nerves.     But.. we strangers online aren't going to be able to tell you if your pregnant.    Some signs are:    Nausea   Fatigue  ALWAYS hungry  Having to use the restroom constantly    There's many more, but those are the norm.     Good luck, hun. AND GET A TEST!    Heather|`|nyGh01ltaa	If you slept with him 3 weeks ago, and you were pregnant you would be 5 weeks pregnant.  Most of the time people do not get any pregnancy symptoms until week 6 and sometimes not until week 8.  You can get a very accurate pregnancy test at most dollar stores.  You can go to Planned Parenthood and they offer both tests and birthcontrol.  Most really early pregnancy symptoms are slight cramps and tender breast..also those tend to be pms too.|`|UZhYso4paa	get a test..the sooner the better  and..those signs dont prove prego..  nxt time try take some pills atleast...|`|UOfitYbmaa	you could be pregnant.. go see your doctor to be sure!! sypmtoms: nausea vomiting food cravings always tired dizziness and alot more!|`|gFldqybSaa	Even if you are pregnant, which it doesn't seem like it..

iCqfmRC3aa	Let's see my youngest is 26, he,and his wife visited our nudist resort with my wife and I.at the end of last summer.  My children were raised to wear clothing when appropriate, but free to go as naked as they wanted, again when appropriate.  They grew up to be fine upstanding parents of their own.  Children raised in this manner do not have the body issues of those that are taught their bodies are "naughty" and something they should hide.  They also don't have to sneak around to find out what other peoples bodies look like, so are less likely to get into sexual situations as teens.  There are studies that support my comments ... but then there are studies that can be found to support just about anything, isn't there?  All I can say is that for us, and some of our friends, we found raising our children with the belief their bodies hold no shame has worked well.|`|lzivF4Idaa	uhhh...6 months old.|`|PFO1jxZGaa	My oldest is almost 6 and I see him naked all the time. He actually likes to streak thru the house... <br>  I expect to kep seeing him naked for the next two or three years too. If he gets shy then so be it but if not I think I would stop peeking in his shower at around 9|`|CC6dSdJmaa	Oh heck, I have to own up to being mature, my youngest son a week ago at the swimming pool showers, he is in his thirties! Oh, his son was there as well, he is 10.<br>  There should never be a problem with seeing family, or friends, naked at any time!<br>  Nudity is not pornography!|`|prqrQcd1aa	well, i just had to give my 3 year old and 17 month old a bath, so that was the last i saw them naked! My oldest is 7, i last saw her naked couple hours ago when she was getting a shower!|`|B9KwqnuDaa	My 3 year old son is naked right now. Ha ha he's potty training.|`|fdnbXfvfaa	..this sounds like a pedo question|`|1k6UUC8qaa	I don't even recall you know when to stop looking its automatically and a mutual sense of privacy that just happens you just know|`|0sbhjGiraa	I still see my 2, 4 and 6 year old daughters completly naked. I don't see my 7 year old son nakes anymore. Only his dad does.|`|hNr3GFvlaa	Is this a survey or are you concerned about the effects of nudity on children? If the latter, could you please clarify your concern?|`|tQ4QlE8Waa	They day they learn to use the bathroom on their own|`|tLXY9QsAaa	I saw my daughter naked just today.  She is 3 months old.
F3dWvVy5aa	The girl that wrote 'what to expect when expecting' was given it twice they thought she was late too. She was really pregnant. Get a copy of the book and read the inside cover, her baby was fine. She delivered full term I think she said girl baby.But you should really check with doctor, they could tell you more.
cDVAEHgCaa	The minute my daughter made her entrance into the world, she was laid on my chest.  I would have been BEYOND PISSED OFF if the doctor handed her to my boyfriend!!  <br>  <br>  And the only other family member who held her that entire day was my boyfriend.  I wasn't about to play "pass the baby" on the best day of my entire life!!|`|6Zdfx7QOaa	The doctor put the baby on my belly immediately after she was born. They didn't even take her away to bathe her or weigh her until an hour or so later, they let me breastfeed first.<br>  <br>  I have seen on television doctors hold the babies for a few minutes, or hand them to the nurse though. I would have been upset if I wasn't the first one to hold my baby.|`|syrh8J6Vaa	They usually put the baby right on top of the mothers stomach.  The dad then cuts the cord and they take the baby to "clean them up".  If he is standing there they will hand the baby to him.  In all honesty I was so tired I could not lift my arms.  He held the baby next to my face and continued to hold him while they stitched me up.|`|b5ae6c4a0700956c375f37b49f896632aa	the person who's conscious gets the baby.. personally, i had too much anasthesia and epidural, so i was in a la-la-land, so i was not in the position to hold the baby, so my husband had the first honor :).. but i would suggest that you don't take those movies too close to your heard - they are like sci-fi.. honestly.. the whole process is painless (epidural that numbs the female waist down) and much quieter.. i mean i seriously suspect that 99% of those writers that come up with the birthing scenes have never been present at the regular delivery..|`|eNulfbs7aa	Well...it is up to you who he/she hands it to...I did the Bradley Method of birthing...and i made sure that the doctor was very aware of my requirements.  I did not want the umbilical cord cut until the baby was latched on to my breast nursing...This is a special bonding time and I didn't want them being whisked away.  It also helps to deliver the placenta quicker.  It was very special.  Unfortunately with my son, he came through merconium and had to be taken away immediately for his safety..if they ingest any this could cause serious complications...but the responsibility lies in your hands...make sure you tell them your wishes...educate yourself...you will be glad you did.|`|54f89f63b29123e8efe33f4bdc6a2d74aa	That's odd... everyone here who had c-sections said the baby was given to the daddy first. In my case, the baby was taken away to be suctioned and cleaned then my arm was unstrapped and the baby was given to me - not my husband. I suppose it depends on the O.R. staff.<br>  <br>  My husband did get to leave with the baby while the doctor finished sewing me up though.|`|DcLiW4bbaa	They gave her to me first. Then they took her and weighed her, measured her, and wrapped her in a blanket and then they gave her to my boyfriend.|`|46cbd785e6475e81fd1cbbaa46a93a81aa	both my sons were placed on my chest right after.....while dad cut the umblical cord!!!|`|SThzwfAlaa	Well usually the nurse gets it. And he or she dries the baby checks it out and wraps it in a warm blanket and than hands it to the mother.|`|GWQKm5y4aa	Kind of a weird question... But, I say who ever can hold the baby or who ever's closer.|`|TczFL0p0aa	the mom gets it first unless complications occur or if it is asked other wise.|`|GexgmXMJaa	yes they hand it to the woman unless she is uncapable of doing so.|`|xrNzLYhAaa	when I had my little girl my doctor handed her to me first.|`|aLAmvX5Naa	If the baby isn't in need of emergency medical care the baby goes to the mom.|`|aJLx0nhNaa	It depends.  If you have a normal, vaginal birth with no complications, you can instruct the delivering doctor or midwife to place the child on your chest immediately if that is your wish.<br>  <br>  In my case I had a pre-term baby via c-section so he was examined by a NICU doctor first.  My husband was walked by a nurse over to where he was being examined, and then handed the baby to hold while he sat at my head.  I could not have held a baby - I was being sewn up.<br>  <br>  After I was transferred to a rolling gurney, the baby was placed in my arms.|`|IXBl5l5kaa	I got to pull my daughter the rest of the way out to my chest, but I was capable of getting her and she was not in need of any emergency care despite having the cord wrapped around her neck twice.|`|vGH9ghiKaa	I was in the delivery room when my son was born, I was the first to hold him.  Why, I don't know, maybe it's just more convenient.  2 weeks later my wife got to see and hold our baby.  What's wrong with that?|`|2Pp2cDbJaa	uaually the mother holds it, sometimes the father, sometimes neither, all depends if there are any complications and if the baby is crying|`|pJiTbIpYaa	They usually put the baby straight up onto mummy's chest to help with the bonding process but if mummy has had a c-section them daddy gets first hold and mummy gets a look. TV really is not a reliable source for such info. They just show that on tv because they think it looks better. <br>  <br>  My fiance cut the umbilical cord and then Isabella was placed on my chest. It is the greatest feeling in the world.

You might want to add  a herbal product into your life as well. I had the best results with a herbal tea called Breastea. You can get it online, and it's very affordable. Try drinking a glass when you sit down to nurse or pump. Hope this helps.|`|itiJVgRsaa	start pumping with an electric pump a.s.a.p. also your baby builds your supply as she nurses. is she falling asleep before she is done? are you switching breasts often? are you eating well? these all factor in on your supply. don't let her fall asleep. if she does, wake her by changing her diaper or caressing her cheek. your breasts might just feel light and your supply is fine. eat 5 small meals a day. and switch breasts constantly. she will be going through a growth spurt and her demand for breast milk will increase. be positive and dont give up. check this site for help. they helped me greatly.=)|`|dxcr0eyaaa	I struggled with low milk supply as well, but a lactation consultant told me to get a natural remedy called "More milk" from the brand Motherlove. Those drops are available at any good health food store or from their website. Trust me they do work! And keep pumping and nursing as much as you can!|`|TczFL0p0aa	i would suggest pumping a lot! good luck and congrats on the little girl, im sure ur a good momma!
