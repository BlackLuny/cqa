I hope the programs you have in your P.C. are updated so that you can execute it successfully. the media player will do it for you and you can even broadcast it via internet.

So Vincent's dad writes him a letter:<br>  <br>  Vincent,<br>  It isn't the same without you here. I wish I could dig up the soil to plant, but it's so much work! I miss you, Son.<br>  <br>  REPLY:<br>  Dad,<br>  Don't dig up the yard! That's where I buried the BODIES.<br>  <br>  The next day, the FBI goes to Vincent's dad's residence and scour the yard. Finding nothing, they apologize and leave. The same day, Vincent writes another letter to his dad:<br>  Dad,<br>  That's all I could do. Have fun planting.|`|ktj5qv4faa	omg that was so lame i laughed. lol!|`|UbR8EfMxaa	no they just bury you at the spot of breakdown

420e0e2496807e15c86ec78f8ff9a5b3aa	It seems that this sort of behavior has been there all along.  Sharon went through a similar episode after her mom's accident where she didn't remember taking things...losing chunks of time, blah, blah, blah...but I think she's nuts! LOL.  She always has been it's just coming out now!|`|cf85b0d809f1b2dc27176a201e84e8f9aa	those writers are all over the board...they have a bunch of teenagers writing the story or what. And for what reason is Sharon acting this way? She wasn't in love w/Brad. It doesn't make sense.|`|EPPb5pRBaa	I feel bad for Eden, Sharon needs help...|`|gW0nD5cEaa	I wonder if her contract is up for review and maybe she's heading toward suicide, or a suicide attempt. Or they are going to write in a storyline about bi-polar disorder or something like that. <br>  <br>  But she does not have to have been in love with Brad to feel guilty about his death, I mean she did care about him. He would not have died if he had not left the cabin when he did, because she rejected him, but then again, Noah would be dead if he hadn't so I guess there is conflict. But she is really messed up. <br>  <br>  As for Eden, I don't think she and Noah should be kept apart|`|Xgn57WGfaa	She truly has lost it!!|`|30r4coInaa	I can't believe Sharon!  I really really can't believe I feel bad for Eden.  <br>  <br>  Sharon has lost it and I hate her more now than ever!

Please.|`|uVwPykXlaa	she s depressed abt brads death,heartbroken over nick,she thot they were going to be together.<br>  and with all happening at once,she having a nervous breakdown.<br>  an anxiety attack is coming in thext next few episodes..|`|fcPiQDwEaa	Officially!|`|O0b9Kiosaa	Straight up BANANAS!

vEiaoR3Saa	I think that you have tried your best to talk to her.<br>  I mean it would be good if you keep trying, but you should know that atleast you tried to talk to her.<br>  And if she is immature enough to not talk to you about buisness crap.<br>  Then, just let her go and go on with work/life.|`|D71XiC1raa	i would just  keep going on with my day cuz what can you do if she wants to be difficult and not listen to you. i know its hard but i would just tell her what she needs to know about work and that's all. its up to her if she will listen  to you or not and if she chooses not to the out come might be bad and it would be her  fault. but to make peace maybe you should tell her how you wore both wrong and that your sorry. and if she dose not want to make peace than just go on with your day. you did your part by trying to make peace so its up to her now. just live life and be happy :D !!!!!|`|XHTlAFcpaa	did you try to settle the matter with her/him?<br>  if not,then do it as quick as possible.<br>  maybe the person is not co-operative,but as he/she is your colleague,you are bound to meet her/him at school,so better keep contact well,rather than invite detest and enmity..|`|Vbi7FeRTaa	seems like she's mad at you...try to make up with her...|`|PLXc64xjaa	i would just move on if she dont want to talk to u is for some thing <br>  but if u like her its another story but i wouldent act like that i would of talked and not make weird faces i would just move on let her come to u when she is in need then u go and make her happy|`|HYDIjgCJaa	I m completely agree wid Ramag<br>   would just move on if she dont want to talk to u is for some thing <br>  but if u like her its another story but i wouldent act like that i would of talked and not make weird faces i would just move on let her come to u when she is in need then u go and make her happy|`|P8uh4joQaa	your question is kind of confusing.

cjLxrrTBaa	You should show him your boobies.|`|FgsRcuDpaa	Just walk up to him and say something like, "hey, how's it going" or something along those lines. Just talk naturally to him.|`|PugkFRRpaa	i can't tell you what to say. You just go up and talk to him. Hey what's up? Ask him to just go somewhere like with you, like if he is on the bench say hey will you come with me to get a drink, etc. Talk about interests, likes, dislikes, etc. Hopefully you to will get along. Good luck ;)|`|wmCv1Sn3aa	well if you want to get to know him then the obvious answer is that you have to talk to him. if he's shy and you're shy, then its going to be a little awkward or so at first unless you can be the one to open up.  (which would be a good idea). If it looks like things are going good, then stick with it and maybe something good will come from it.|`|FnxswaoPaa	If you know your kinda hot talk to him he will like it.|`|LRwQEnLnaa	This is how I make friends with anyone; I pretend I'm really hyper and joke about and giggle with some of my friends. So round up a few of your friends and pass a few 'hi's' when you walk past him and then after a few days compliment him and say something to the effect of 'you're a really good drummer'. You also might want to mention that you know his friend. It will get you into conversation easily enough and then you can start sitting beside him at lunch but don't throw yourself at him because if he is really shy, it might put him off. It seriously does work and it has boosted my confidence as well and also expanded the amount of friends I have. I used to be unbelievably shy. One thing not to forget is SMILE. :) He'll notice you're really friendly if you do. x

Nctd8Xyaaa	The original Hairspray was much better for many reasons.<br>  <br>  Devine was experienced in crossdressing and was just an amazing actor that was made to play that role. Ricky Lake was also amazing in her role, I don't even know who this girl in 2007 is.  And John  travolta was horrible in this role, it was very easy to see that he couldn't play a woman.|`|152b3a8ec4e56ae376c7fcca43292d4daa	i liked them both but hairspray 2007 is way better than the original mainly because it's a musical. i have to say im really glad that it was amanda bynes that played penny pingelton because i aws the original she was just as funny as the oringinal penny.|`|YKSF6aoraa	I like them both.. hairspray 2007 is a musical and the music is awesome.. and 1988 is not a musical and it is a little boring, but I liked Ricky Lake in it!|`|B2vFQLU0aa	2oo7 john travolta was hilarious !! <br>   and duhhh ZAC EFRON!<br>   no but liked it better it was funnier.|`|AA11110732	No contest, the original was better.<br>  <br>  John Travolta doesn't deserve to rinse Divine's stockings let alone play Edna Turnblad.|`|y8WBcehmaa	I liked the new one more, because it was a musical. Also it had Christopher Walken singing...sweet.<br>  <br>  But I did like the 1988 version, Ricki Lake did a good job.

1UOIoOzKaa	She is quite slutty, she's had enough of Twilight already! She wants to be done with the films as quick as possible!<br>  But whatever, she's not the Bella in my head|`|1620f8acd8e6a1bab16fb6d4bd625f7baa	Chill. I don’t like her either,  she’s a horrible actress and extremely ungrateful  for the undeserved fame  and fans she has.<br>  She totally ruined the movie, her acting was awkward and stiff and just plain 2 dimensional. She made the bella character flat. it was painful watching robert try to make the movie work on his own..<br>  horrible..  <br>  <br>  i <3 rob pattinson though and that is the only reason im watching new moon..|`|uwg62QBAaa	omfg totally agreee.! she seems soooo ungrateful and pissed at the fans all the time... shes always like "oh i wish i hadnt done this movie theres always people following me around"<br>  im like wtf millions of girls would kill to play bella. they should have deffinitely picked someone else. plus she seems nervous, stiff and akward all the time even in the movei. shes not even a good actress.<br>  <br>  <br>  idk she might be a cool person but she kinda seems like a whole ***** about twilight.|`|a6j0cwgqaa	I personally think the movie would have been much MUCH BETTER without her as the main freaking actress! She can't act to save her life!!!!!!! I wasn't impressed with her at all and she seems snotty, If she knew just how bad she sucked she'd feel terrible about how she ruined that movie for thousands of fans!!!!!<br>  <br>  If they do replace her, I'll be excited for the next ones that come out...|`|2UWeXKZ2aa	Woah, calm down. I personally don't give a damn about her at all. Twilight was alright movie and I'm happy I got it for free. It really is kinda a big money maker because of it's fan base. Seriously, there is a lot of ungrateful people in the world, she isn't the only one.|`|zJoVm4SSaa	Okay my friend is kin to her. i swear it. I have never met her prob never will but I have asked her about it because i too like twilight. She says that kristen has always been a very private person and HATES the attention she has been getting. She isn't a people person and doesn't get along with a lot of people, which causes my friend to ALWAYS complain about "why the f*** did she even start acting if she hates the attention, her stupid dad pushed her toward it and she doesn't even like it.Ill gladly take it from her" <br>  <br>  She has even told my friend once that if she knew what twilight would have brought(fame) she wouldn't have signed up for it. She can't say that because everyone will hate her, but thats what she said. She had never heard of it b4 until she had already signed it thinking it was another low key project she usually does. <br>  <br>  kristen is a nice person, she just hates attention. She is one of those people who don't get close to a lot of people. So if youre her friend, you must be special lol cause she doesn't have many close friends from what my friend says. also her and her bf, have recently been having problems. she is getting tired/bored of it and NO she does not like robert pattinson. this is what came out of her mouth.( like more than a friend)|`|NrMcYLwjaa	I totally 100% agree. I hate her and think she should have never gotten the role of Bella. I mean the screen writers had to rewrite the whole Bella part, because she didn't want to say the things that Bella actually said. Because she said that she didn't want to say anything cheesy. She completely flips out on her fans, cursing at them and everything. She was the reason that Rob almost gave up his role for New Moon. She needs to be replaced.|`|a0Qcx9oKaa	I couldnt agree with you any more.<br>  She is stuckkk up.<br>  Like she was supposed to announce with Robert at the oscars but she deiceded not to because she felt like she didnt deserve to be there .<br>  She is very annoying. I didnt think she should've even been casted as Bella, becuase she doesnt even act like the part is suposed to .<br>  Shes an actress that bothers me highly with her attitude towards her career|`|SzL9vUkSaa	I thought she was a good actor in The messengers but i didnt like her in Twilight.<br>  My brother said he would have watched the movie if she wasnt in it.|`|soiBUFi2aa	you jealous.|`|2rla3DOIaa	Reasons Why I Hate Kristen Stewart<br>  <br>  1. She isnt a good actress at all . Every movie that shes been in , she acts EXACTLY the same .<br>  2. She is a bad influence on people who look up to her . I mean smoking pot in her front yard with her boyfriend ? Wtf ? !<br>  3. Shes very bitchy to the paparazzi . Doesnt she know that they come with the whole acting deal ? She needs to know that shes in the spotlight and needs to stop acting like a brat .<br>  4. She calls her fans 'Retards' First of all , that canbe very offensive to people who are mentally ill , and to her fans. If she keeps that up , she wont have any fans at all .<br>  5. She ditched going to the Oscars because she'll go when its a good movie , not one that just makes money . First of all , that movie made her known . Sure shes been in other movies but not 'big' movies . I bet she doesnt think the movie is so bad when she gets that check in the mail .<br>  <br>  That is why I hate Kristen Stewart .<br>  <br>  : )|`|fb354a77b36b49f24a90b9e5ba0548f7aa	She's such an ungrateful *****. She did such a horrid job at bringing Bella to life..<br>  She made Bella seem SO cold, boring and all emo. I watched twilight again last week and I was paying more attention to Bella, and it was almost like she had every move scripted( I know its a movie and its scripted but what I mean it's supposed to be believable)especially that scene in the green house when she was supposed to trip, Idk if anyone saw this but it was almost like she was counting to three and then did that awkward unbelievable trip...I was like WTF.....<br>  In the book Bella as a person you would want to be your best friend or would like to get to know( she moved in with her dad so that her mom could be happy only a really selfless person does that).<br>  The only reason Twilight was worth watching was because of how good Rob Pattinson played Edward Cullen..he was soo good, that you barely paid attention to Bella.<br>  I wished they had picked someone else to play Bella( like Emmy Rossum she would have been perfect), someone capable of making Bella as lovable and cute as she was in the book:(

I didn't see that one coming as I hadn't read the spoilers!  Wonder if Earl's Mum will resort back to the booze again and mess things up.|`|UMtxht9Laa	OMG it was SO sad!!!!!!!!<br>  the little boy who got blamed for bringing the gun to school may be released and rachel hands in her resignation|`|G2gf2ZJyaa	omg i cryed too it was so emotional and there are no spoliers for a reason as there were none on tv either lol
6rR7LTl1aa	Anime is used by and large to reference animated works produced in Japan.  As such, no anime studios exist in Florida.
6fxr3VBGaa	Depends what the other people are ghostwriting. If they write the hooks or skits, intros and all that extra stuff on an album that is cool. It's only when they start writing full verses. And that really doesn't make the artist a sellout unless the artist doesn't acknowledge or tries to make it seem as if they didn't have something written for them.|`|cYmIMtGOaa	ok but they got money for it didnt they??????<br>  we all knew lil wayne fake he throws up bk|`|a02180765517a018eecd133f0f7b2876aa	Not a sellout, no.<br>  To be a sellout you have to:<br>  A)have integrity to begin with<br>  B)compromise that integrity<br>  <br>  I don't think Weezy ever had integrity. I could be wrong. . .<br>  <br>  The ghostwriting thing is still bad if you do it all the time; Or most of the time; Or much of the time.<br>  <br>  Picking Boogers was one of two songs that Biz Markie had Ghostwritten for him, and even then the basic concepts and rhythm structures were entirely Biz's.<br>  <br>  I don't think it's ghostwriting if a guest spot writes your lyrics or vice versa.<br>  <br>  I don't like ghostwriting.|`|uKXgg9heaa	Prove it! Lil' Wayne's lyrics aren't all that great anyway, so if he hired a ghostwriter he need his money back! Know That!|`|HL8W9yU6aa	Not a sell out, but they are no longer relevant.|`|9wUrbqT3aa	I think Drake is writing Wayne stuff now.  What yo thoughts on that Ms. NP?<br>  The song November 18, has Drake and wayne on it... they sound identical.<br>  <br>  To the question at hand... Not a total sell-out but a sell out to the art form.  Dre is a legend and he knows that he aint a rapper.. he had a ghost his whol MC career.  He just dont wanna embarras himself, plus he dont claim to be an MC.<br>  <br>  Any other MC that claims to be a MC that has a ghostwriter... yeah a Sell out.  Ex. Will Smith.  A hip-hop pioneer, but he was lettin Skills & Smitty write his recent works.  Thats hella weak... if u lost yo touch, then dont rap!
14f68b3ce9b74fe1effcb259219a38a9aa	Yes unless it is repaired by true love, the only thing that can help.|`|oDGttkmLaa	Yes. It happens a lot. You'll notice one elderly person die..and their spouse dies a couple months later. I really believe it happens b/c of the brokenness of losing a life partner..and not b/c they're just 'old'.|`|GBRmOem8aa	I have always believed this.... it has always seemed to me that when someone's lover dies that if they truly did love that person then they would die at most a year later of a broken heart.|`|6UlOorwMaa	in a way yes, you can become so depressed you can basically just fade away from the sorrow|`|nkmwGAKjaa	I am inclined to think so.  So many times we hear of couples who have been married for many years... and one dies and the other soon follows.|`|5jqfKDdfaa	I know ppl can die of lonliness so its possible|`|AA10838250	many have, yes|`|c5a50631f90f4ba04d88c923dc2aa963aa	it happens more often than u think!|`|o5Tb8ZQ0aa	Yes I do believe that if you truly are in love with someone and they die, that it could send you into cardiac arrest or cardiac failure from the deep pain you feel over the loss. I know if my daughter died, I would surely die shortly after of a broken heart. She keeps me alive, so why wouldn't her death take me with her as well?|`|Mu3UvybKaa	Seriously, I do. Look at really old couples - often times, when one dies, the other dies very shortly afterwards because they just don't know how to go on without the other. Johnny Cash died from a broken heart not that long after June Carter died in my opinion.<br>  June died in May 2003, Johnny died in Sept. 2003|`|Sw0yxyueaa	yeah, even animals have died of broken hearts.|`|E9MF18FRaa	NO!! you may feel like you are! but at the end no one dies! well at least i think so cuz if that was true i wouldnt be here lol or maybe i would because that person wasnt worth it and now i found the one :)|`|cGiED4sJaa	I wouldn't dwell on it, lest you manifest this untimely demise....but yes, people have done so...high corollary between one partner dying and the other dying within months...the mind can be powerful, but remeber this also has postive implications as well... :)|`|107405bbcdb915439a0fd322a6701663aa	maybe not exactly what you mean but it makes me think of really old people that have been married for a million years that die within a week of each other. so ya.|`|PugkFRRpaa	Yes. They can become so miserable that they cease to do anything. they refuse to eat, drink, anything. they jsut lay in their bed and welcome death.|`|20c96a5e1e1d8742c7835d3700704d38aa	Yes, I've seen it and its awful. I have only seen it though when a spouse dies suddenly and the widow stops cherishing life.|`|7LdjNoX7aa	wow, I'm actually surprised of how many people said yes. <br>  <br>  Me, I'm not sure...|`|QevBVANtaa	Yes I think you can..|`|1H0vYaJxaa	it has been  medically proved it is called broken heart syndrome|`|btrMdy5Uaa	Yes|`|dgGtwSIzaa	Yes !|`|obvLU0HSaa	of course! & believe it is not uncommon at all!<br>  take care!|`|4zeazkWOaa	yes I am dying of that|`|3505983107c631451310c5009361ae76aa	ya|`|grTFRJVjaa	yea i think it is possible:<br>  <br>  the example that i present is one that i think we can all relate to:<br>  <br>  older people who have been married for years and years. it seems that once one spouse goes the other one is soon to follow in the next year or so. its as if their will to live dies out.<br>  <br>  i have seen this happen with my great grandmother and great grandfather. my great grandmother passed away and after words it was as if my great grandfather started to shut down,. he was eating less and becoming more reclusive. about a year after the death of my great grandmother he too passed away.|`|e8bRcVNAaa	Yes I do. I already did. December 6, 2009 is going to be the end of my life litterally, I'll be 21. No grandma, no 1990's, no childhood, no me!<br>  F____ this life! I don't know why I'm alive anyways!|`|AA11841749	I think a broken heart can lead to someone's death (suicide).  I don't think people should kill themselves over a failed relationship, but too many people do.|`|PR8qBbMmaa	In a way yes because the broken heart can lead to depression which could lead to suicide or something like that =(<br>  Sad but true =)|`|yGr1VRQSaa	on the inside you can it can last a long time or it can last a short time depending on "you" but u could never really die|`|48SlX2Yiaa	Literally speaking, yes|`|ddf8df78e38155f197807599013a70c1aa	yeah, you can.|`|RyYV3aXlaa	a 1000 times|`|Y0RBIZJzaa	yes I heard its possible. i don't remember the technical reason why.|`|I5VvAniXaa	YES|`|IeLBIACaaa	i take it you have never read "Where the Red Fern Grows"<br>  Yes it is possible.|`|a386ef2869afa3e59c3ae1150654e650aa	depends on the person who has it.|`|X1uW4cpuaa	someone could get so down and out from a broken heart and starve to death|`|cjLxrrTBaa	Not if they have the heart of a lion...or lioness...|`|0VbAMZccaa	no|`|cF5fdfFxaa	yes|`|iJbslaQNaa	yes|`|n1SVl991aa	It feels like it.<br>  and they might commit suicide.. so..|`|Z8Ui1ugLaa	Yes, if they are so heartbroken they can take care of themselves to sustain life. HJ|`|4bWUiIVdaa	Lol no that's stupid|`|9qUnD0sBaa	Yes.. it happens every day, as some have mentioned in the case of  a spouse death the remaining person, in a loving relationship, statistically goes in six months, broken heart.<3<3<br>  Young people suffer from broken hearts too, and it is one aspect of maturing and a rite of passage as ,painful as walking on coals.  The good news is we survive the pain grow from it, and go on to find true love.|`|PIeronuZaa	Yes that can and does happen, especially if the bond shared lasted for many years..I feel that the love lost can have a direct effect physically besides emotionally if that's all one person had in life or chose to believe was all they had in life.|`|7eEFKDrOaa	Yes I do, and I will tell you why, When a person is near death they try to make all the amends that is necessary to free themselves of any burdens before moving on to the other side, This is an experience like no other that can sometimes make your World come to a complete end, something that can hurt you so bad you just don't want to feel anymore.  V....V|`|FSyaAnuKaa	Sure. Have you ever seen Somewhere In Time? Christopher Reeves died of a broken heart in that.

va4DLO1Daa	The interesting thing about this language is that it's the most spoken language all over the world and it has many versions.Because it's innate,you won't have to learn it but need someone to speak with.In my case I know I can use it when needed.<br>  <br>  <br>  (<D>)|`|6OnqUyseaa	,, the language comes naturally - when love is real .<br>  <br>  It's not difficult at all - it comes sooooo automatically - like it's built inside of us .. unless !.!. -  the feeling is not the real earth-shaking love that takes resident in our heart .. and when we try to make false love, real -  it just never works and the language is then difficult, if not impossible.|`|3N0silDMaa	yes ~<br>  maybe it is difficult to some people<br>  and I know that I'm always having a clear mind when I'm speaking it so that the people hearing it could understand.I teach the lauguage of love to some of my friends ^^|`|YJKS5v4iaa	I know the language.<br>  But cannot express it very adequately.<br>  Something wanting in me.|`|E9MF18FRaa	no once your in love it comes out naturally|`|k7Rtcqfraa	I believe I can.

M1ymLE9Paa	You can't get much soapier than that.  =)  That would make for some good old-fashioned drama, which I am all for.  Plus, I think I like Liz and Lucky better as friends now, than as a couple, so it would be nice to see Lucky move on to someone else.|`|ZmGOL8kCaa	I like Lucky with Rebecca, but I don't think it would make sense if she was Emily. I think it would be awesome if she was Emily's twin, but both of them were adopted, so they never knew about each other until Rebecca came to Port Charles looking for work.<br>  <br>  Anyways, I think that they'd be a good couple. :P|`|sJs0nuTSaa	I think GH should give you a call.  I wouldn't like it, but it would make for an interesting storyline.  I would feel bad for Nicholas having to watch his brother fall in love with the Emily look-a-like.  :-(|`|7XM4QJiuaa	That could be interesting.|`|tgVGE2Umaa	I could see that happening. They never did get a chance to explore their relationship at all. But on the other hand, the way she was looking at Sonny at Kelly's could mean she is going to go after him when Claudia gets the boot for helping with Michael's shooting. Oh there are soo many ways this can go!|`|VU7YIW5haa	I think they might hook up too. But I thought  Rebecca and Nicholas were gonna get together until I saw them at Kelly's today.|`|EhBF31evaa	I HATE this storyline.  I fast forward through any and all scenes that Nicholas is in.  How many times and how many different ways can you say the exact same thing??|`|SL22F2KAaa	I think this combo is very likely, and will happen or will come close.<br>  ABC is enjoying this.  Nik will be angry.|`|CFZ4ISNNaa	You know when they were at Kelly's talking...(and btw...geez Kelly's was built kinda fast)....I was thinking a little love triangle between Lucky/Rebecca/Nic would be kinda interesting. But WOW! What about the Rebecca/Sonny chemistry!!  <br>  <br>  It would be pretty interesting also to see Nic not get his way for a change. Emily was always the persuer, Nadine was the persuer, that crazy chick was the persuer, ....It's nice to see Rebecca saying no, stay away from me and Nic trying to deal with that. To see Rebecca cozy up to Lucky would be awesome....leaving the possibilities for a Liason reunion    (yeah, I said it! A Liason reunion!!   What???!!)<br>  <br>  I'll go now and wait for my thumbs down from the JaSam Fans...I love you guys anyway!!|`|PnPiq8ehaa	I was thinking the exact thing. I just don't want that to happen for Nikolas's sake. He truly loves Emily and he wants to be close to Rebecca, but I have to say she is being pretty cold to him...I cracked up when she said "well you took me to spoon,moon island whatever you call it"..that was pretty cold . They haven't really showed what Nadine is going through but it can't be good. She really likes Nikolas ans he kinda left her in the wind and not to mention Elizabeth..shes kind of falling back in love with lucky you can def tell....Who knows whats to happen....<br>  <br>  <br>  P.S- I felt so bad for Spenelli, when Sonny was yelling at him yesterday....|`|VAp5ICaBaa	I've been thinking the same thing. I think it would be great to see this storyline play out|`|NGNeT3rYaa	I think it could happen and I read that she connects more with Lucky than with anyone because he isn't oh Emily this and that with her. He respects the fact that she is not Emily, at least for now! I think it would be interesting to see them as a couple and it would put him and Nikolas at odds again!|`|AA12315431	I could see the writer's doing that but I am not sure how I feel about it. Lucky and Emily grew up together and were more like brother and sister. It wouldn't seem natural to me but I am sure I would get used to it seeing as how Rebecca is supposed to be someone else, not Emily. I would also feel pretty bad for Nikolas. Maybe they will put Lucky and Rebecca together and Nik and Liz, then we will find out Rebecca is really Emily and then the $hit will really hit the fan.

CL5kLE2paa	i think Jade Goody would sell her soul for a bit of decent publicity.  I hear her sons are going to get christened.  I'm sure she'll be selling the rights to that to the highest bidder.  Where will it end?|`|ePim7L2zaa	well said janjan i totaly agree with you...she makes me sick|`|eHUXcYZhaa	I agree with you completely. She should be spending time with her children instead of parading around on the television and doing magazine shoots.|`|LLnNjH94aa	All I know is that you Brits are getting weird.|`|la9zji2Uaa	I don't think so but if she is "Go Girl" - if they are gonna pay you????|`|2c89cd9f9d087548a3d65a53e0d5756baa	Not really, she is just trying to live out her last days as normally as possible and for her 'normal' is what she is doing. The general public, by reading about her and wanting to know more made this her way of life.<br>  Jade Goody, from the very little I know about her is not intelligent enough to be a racist bully. All she probably did was open her mouth without even realising that she might have caused offence. I've only seen her once or twice on TV and she surely is not the brightest spark on the planet and I for one applaud that she is doing her damnedest to secure her children's future so that they have a better life and the sort of education that she did not have the benefit of.<br>  What many seem to be overlooking is this - celebrities only become celebrities because Joe Public craves the stories in the media about those people. I doubt Jade realised how being selected for BB would affect and alter her life dramatically I suspect she did it 'for a laugh'. The millions who buy and read magazines like OK or watch programmes like BB are the people who turn ordinary (and Jade was very ordinary at one time) people into a celebrity.|`|Q7Sy9Cnraa	You have a point even if i don't fully agree with you on all of it.<br>  <br>  I think it's SO sad that she's dying of Cancer,i feel really sorry for her,her Boys and the rest of her family/Friends,..they are loosing someone they love forever to this dreadfull disease.<br>  <br>  If it was someone else who was getting all this publicity about there Cancer battle,..i bet know one would batter an eye.<br>  <br>  For example Kylie Minogue,..when she had Cancer,..everyone was interested in every aspect of her battle,..and it was all over the Mags/Papers daily.<br>  <br>  The public felt sympathy for her though,..so whats the difference with Jade?<br>  <br>  She has terminal Cancer,..and will unfortunetly die of it ;(<br>  <br>  And cause according to everyone out there,she hasn't got any fans,..and doesn't deserve ANY sympathy cause she's "Racist"!(People obviously need to look that word up in the dictionary,..and realise what she said wasn't!)<br>  <br>  Louds of us ARE interested in her story,..she's quite indearing in her own way,..she's very real amongst the fakery in the "Showbiz World" thats why people turn there noses up at her cause she is everything that they are trying to conseal to the public,...yet she doesn't and allot of us still like her! ;)<br>  <br>  I do agree about her Wedding being sold to the highest bidder,..but why not? The cash is going to her Sons future,..it's not linning her pocket like all the other "Celebs" that appear on the front Cover at there Nuptials, i.e Cheryl/Ashley Cole etc etc did!<br>  <br>  I think the Media are feeling very guilty after the way they treated her in the "Shilpa-gate" saga,..and now are trying to make ammends cause she's dying!<br>  <br>  If it was me and the Media treated me that way,for something that i'm not guilty of (which she aint!) i wouldn't take any of there blood money,...i'd tell them to $tuff it up there Ar$e$!<br>  <br>  I would Marry in a private Ceremony  and fund it myself.<br>  <br>  I may let the press have a few pics of my happy day,..but they wouldn't be at the Wedding at all!<br>  <br>  But thats just how i would do it,..Jade and many other Celebs do what she did all the time,...thats why the Mag exists,..and the public buy it to have a peek so know one can't moan at all!|`|i6tyscumaa	Okay maybe it's not "fair" but she is raising the money for her children. honestly, if you were in the same positionas she was, and you were able to make money from it, could you really say you wouldn't do the same? Maybe it's not fair, but if anything, it should be the magazines you should be complaining about - they're the ones offering her the money.|`|7gfNIajYaa	You have to remember that it is the media and people who work on these magazines that edit the titles of the interview etc and alter the Jade Goody story in such a way to attract the reader to the articles,and alter the outcome of whether the reader likes her or not too.|`|sVkBdQ28aa	It's like she said; if she stopped to think about it, she'd live her last days as a depressed wreck. She owes that much to herself- to keep on as normal.

I mean It's like the Maddie McCann thing. Millions of people have cancer and go missing every year, but just because she went on BB she makes a big deal of it. I am supportive of her and I do wish her well, but it's just wrong.|`|HnNJAJeJaa	Whether it is right or wrong with what she is doing,she certainly has made alot more girls aware with the dangers of not going for smears,which can only be a good thing..|`|774c0eb5f31b806e89824993621a7184aa	Jade is selling her death to the public.|`|9F76AUgfaa	No, i believe Jade is just trying to get as much money together as possible for her kids.<br>  Stories like this sell newspapers and magazines,so the media is going with it.<br>  Yes, you are right there are many many folk/families that are victims of cancer and i am sure if they could raise some cash for their families they would.<br>  Please don't be bitter about Jade. Yes, she was a bit silly, but that's the past. The girl will be dead soon.Let her do what she has to do.|`|70d867ec0ce9c05d098a7efb66f7d809aa	She knows she has little time to live and she is using every opportunity to sell her stories to the media.  But i don't blame her, because she is leaving behind two young boys, and she is a mother.  So the money she receives from the press, she is putting it aside for her small boys, so when she passes away at least their mummy has secured they future for them.|`|SuOfRTXzaa	She actually isn't using her cancer as a Claim to fame, but merely looking into the future for her children, perhaps one wouldn't judge too quickly if one was in the same predicament.   I personally feel she is courageous to open up her life for all to see.  I for one take my hat off to her.|`|2tMJIVSEaa	She is a celeb now for gods sake they do everything for the camera nowadays!!

s6miUiKSaa	Mr. Lizard, "hump day" is called such because it's in the middle of the week. As in "getting over the hump" that is the middle of the week. It can be still be hump day for the unemployed, I am guessing it would just be less meaningful as everyday is a day off when you are unemployed. <br>  I am unemployed but enrolled in school over full time this year. I showed up early for class and the school generously has put computers everywhere. I am using one of the schools computers right now to surf the internet and troll Yahoo Answers. <br>  I am guessing that a lot of other people have put the words "hump" and "unemployed and "pregnancy" in their questions and that is why is popped up. There must be a high correlation amongst the words.<br>  Unemployment in California is at a all time high. I believe in the country as well. In case you do become unemployed, you might want to consider becoming a inspirational speaker, writing that book about "doing the least to get by" and taking a vacation to refresh and rejuvenate your shine.<br>  Cheers.|`|83dc622a9447fc8c5ffba386894737ceaa	Sadly, probably not. I would miss Hump Day, if it lost its significance. If you are ever to become unemployed, or "freed from the confines of employment", please contact me so I can join you in a greeting card venture.<br>  <br>  I do admit I would be giddy at all the free time you would have to ask and answer questions, and hope that you would take the time to relax and unwind.<br>  <br>  I suggest being proactive, and applying for your share of the bailout money now. Perhaps a trillion dollars would suffice. It would buy you the finest hot dogs on Earth. Speaking of hot dogs, that reminds me that your question was suggested to Pregnancy because "unemployed" looks similar to "uterus"......or something like that......<br>  <br>  :)|`|4TmN5Dohaa	when un employed every day is a hump day, you have to get over it every day|`|jeLehwmpaa	i dont see why i wouldnt <br>  <br>  i bet you they chose pregnancy cuz of the word hump<br>  like a beely hump>>camel<br>  <br>  i dont know|`|8aa2ea728deb10155c8014220bf22a62aa	Every day is "hump day" if you can get it up and keep it up.

c77b996327401a827d6f388748da1db8aa	Yes. It's total and utter bollocks|`|4VNFsmanaa	Most people don't believe in astrology because they don't take the time to learn about it. Every person has a detailed natal chart, which is unique and you'd be the only person with one like it. Only going by Sun signs is unreliable, because 1/12 of the population has the same thing. We are a blend of many different signs in our chart. To answer your question, yes I do believe in astrology, but not daily horoscopes.|`|fmkwdNJyaa	I believe and of course we are all individual and add  unique personality traits to the horoscopes readings. I'm gemini and my two greatest friends are aquarius (call her my sister) and leo(we've been close from day 1 when i was 7) <br>  My mom is leo and father is aquarius<br>  My horoscope says I get along with them the most|`|Ygb1llTeaa	I don't believe in it. Now and then, it can be fun to look at them and laugh at how right or wrong they are, as I have come across both extremes. But the stars are so hugely far away that they can't possibly have any influence on our lives. The doctor that delivers a baby has more gravitational pull on that child than the planets or stars that the child was born under.|`|Hn3drOO3aa	They've done studies on this stuff. Basically, if you took a bunch of people and showed them descriptions of personalities (basically covering up the Zodiac sign and randomly mixing them all up) and told these people it was their Zodiac sign, they'd all agree with it.<br>  <br>  Zodiac descriptions are so vague they can apply to anyone. I mean, just think about it. Don't fall for this hocus-pocus!|`|ZS38T8M7aa	I've always believed in astrology, but one must really take the time to learn all about and read about it. The back of Seventeen magazine DOES NOT show you real zodiac readings. Try trusted astrology sites or reading old age astrology books if you want to read something promising.|`|k8F0n289aa	I’m not sure  really<br>  Once  mine said beware  danger is ahead and I nearly got hit by a car I was stunned about that.<br>  But if you think how can all those stars mean anything to us how can all of them <br>  Have purpose for us all..<br>  I wish I could believe but who knows ….<br>  <br>  <br>  xx|`|KmwrfHPtaa	I think everyone's opinion is different about it. Like religion, none of it can be proven and there will always be skeptics. Religion has been disproved more often than astrology.<br>  <br>  I don't believe that the horoscope of the day will predict my path, but I know that I am the textbook definition of a Capricorn. I do believe that a lot can be discovered about a person by knowing their sign. It wouldn't be good to make definite judgments but it could be useful to consider.<br>  <br>  It depends on your source. This is one of those things that is much better left to books than the internet. So much crap circulates on the internet that it is hard to know what is correct and what is not. If you care, find some older books about astrology but skip yahoo horoscopes.|`|AA10315175	I don't believe it at all because if it were true then everyone would be match up perfectly with their soul mates. And the world would be a better place. Because then we would all know how to handle each other without getting to know them. We will be able to tell who are bad,  good, and who are back stabbers. Everyone's life would be pick out for them. That's why I don't believe in Astrology because most people don't act like their horoscope sign. And I  wouldn't ever won't to judge anyone for their horoscope and miss a good friend because the stars say that my sign doesn't go well with his or her sign.  My Answer NO WAY don't believe in Astrology.|`|E2VUH8Q0aa	Yes...no, wait......No....um...<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  ..sometimes?<br>  <br>  Depends on what you're talking about!<br>  <br>  Sun signs?  Yes. Total rubbish.<br>  <br>  Natal chart? No...<br>  <br>  ..it works too well for me to discount..

fcPiQDwEaa	Nothing as far as l see, they've just added a little extra to her usual pitiful character, you know, the one where she has no backbone and the most simple things sends her crying and wailing and gnashing her teeth!

That's an insult upon insults. Still, maybe not entirely undeserved. Mean though. Funny.|`|LWXMUmFOaa	hahaha thats very funny i wonder why all the jonas fans havent answered|`|eeKlogL4aa	I know! I heard about it and I laughed my head off!<br>  I now love the NME for awarding them that!<br>  A truly deserved award!|`|G4iHDhpvaa	Haaa I laughed so much! I like them and all but i'm so annoyed at Joe for what he did to Taylor Swift! It's what he deserved!|`|PugkFRRpaa	hahahhaha hhilarious.. hilarous|`|Qr1ENha3aa	They worked so hard for this award! Well deserved!|`|CUEco2LEaa	When I first saw your question I was ready for a rant about how I expected more from NME than to give an award to the Jonas Brothers. I find it very funny and very deserving. All they do is wear trousers far too tight and pout.<br>  <br>  It's sad when your best song is the theme to a Disney cartoon - American Dragon. <br>  <br>  Don't worry one of them will get a DUI soon, then the other will want to release a solo album of rock music, because that's where his heart is. He's a rocker at heart but sang bubble gum pop for years just to satisfy his brother. As for the last one, the Church of Scientology or coming out as gay is in the future. If not, there's always I'm a Celeb!<br>  <br>  In all honesty, I'm surprised they didn't win a razzie for their awful Disney film. Although there are so many awful Disney films to choose from.|`|8gOR04Emaa	Those awards are just messed up.<br>  Fall out boy and tokio hotel are not bad.<br>  neither are the jonas brothers.<br>  and apparently oasis got voted in that category too whoever that is and also won best award wtf??|`|B3N388wBaa	I heard about that!<br>  <br>  I laughed my butt off!

215646253ac5e0903ab28bc43e031fd3aa	I think your other question answers this one.<br>  <br>  If you "bang" a guy a few times he may in fact want more.|`|86acf988bd253bcd1586d895b2e5a43aaa	Looks like your question was already answered. Hope you solved your problem. It could also mean that he feels you're a tease because you're nice to him, but won't go any further. I could give you a better answer with more info. Good luck!|`|AA10838250	the questions you ask,  and all the banging may be the reason|`|YW1DXceqaa	example:tell a guy he has nice eyes..then he asks you out and you say you aren't interested|`|jGgOVd5Zaa	Men's default receiving position is 'she is interested in me'.  If you don't send a clear override signal we take every action as a positive.  For instance, <br>  <br>  You say, "So, I guess I'll see you at the party Friday."<br>  He hears, "So, I guess we could go to the party together on Friday."<br>  <br>  You say, "That's a nice shirt."<br>  He hears, "She's checking me out."<br>  <br>  You say, "I just need a friend."<br>  He thinks, "Does she think I'm hitting on her?  Is she just saying she just needs a friend because she just wants to be friends or because she is worried that I haven't made a move and she doesn't want to be out on a limb and feel rejected... I better make a move!"<br>  <br>  You show up at his house wearing something sexy.<br>  He thinks, 'Wow, she wore something sexy for me.'<br>  <br>  Remember, as soon as a guy thinks your interested oxygen stops going to his brain and his IQ drops 80 points, so you need to be really clear and consistent, like you were training a dog.|`|TKNQWdVwaa	lol.<br>  basically a mixed signal is that if youre acting in a certain way to someone that makes that someone think that you like them, and it turns out that you dont.... its like you're kind of leading them on but then you don't like them after all. <br>  you send signals that you like them but then you don't.....|`|AA11404742	Mixed signals are those that say two or more different, opposite messages.  Like, "I like you", but "I don't want to date you".<br>  <br>  How you do this, I have no clue.  Think about what you say, what your body language is, etc.  Ask your friends, or ask the person that says you're sending them out.|`|2xaVpnNNaa	a mix signal means you are giving the guy indications you like him and you dont like him, in other words you are confusing him.<br>  <br>  you might not even know you are doing it. try to examine and observe your own behavior, and put yourself in the guy's shoes.|`|UzlkwSC3aa	What your first answerer said. But frankly, even if you paint a picture, some guys just don't get anything girls say or do, they're very dense when it comes to understanding girls or reading between the lines or taking hints, (this is assuming that it's a guy you are referring to).|`|wLa4rKAFaa	Mixed Signal basically means that you are confusing somebody because you are sending them messages that are unclear.<br>  It could be that you are undeceive, or you are contradicting yourself.|`|PN7XMglOaa	Because the community doesn't know where you are coming from .|`|RyYV3aXlaa	could it be there is some thing wrong with you ?|`|22ojjhZhaa	It depends on who told you this.  If it was a person then you're sometimes showing them you like them and sometimes you're not.  maybe you're a closet flirt.  its ok if you are, i was until i figured it out, now i'm just a flirt haha.  anyway if you like  or dislike the person who said it to you (or the receiver or the mixed signal or whatever), all you have to do is act the way you feel.  If you like them and they said it to you, theres a good chance they like you too so maybe tell them that.  I hope this helps!|`|d4ba37a620ee56dc0702e184994be422aa	If you are sending out mixed signals, that means, that you confuse the people around you. One day, you draw them close, by being nice or needy, the next day you push them away by treating them mean. Check yourself, does that sound like you? If yes, you have to adjust your attitude.|`|dQj0wMRpaa	Acting interested in someone, then telling them something that would mean your not.  The term mixed signals means to act on something then to contradict it.|`|26f4e131b55aac50d58e01695131bb6eaa	When someone thinks you like them when in actuality.. you don't. You are most likely just being really nice and friendly and they are misunderstanding you getting big ideas!! Poor nice people :(|`|5kXB9Ftgaa	cause your a horndog|`|a4LWildhaa	A mixed signal means the guy isn't sure if you are flirting and interested or you are not. It isn't you-guys only always want one thing-it ain't friendship.|`|frwlypDWaa	Beats me. And I'm already married, thanks.
ZYJdpXEBaa	Im sure you cant be banned <br>  god always forgives <br>  <br>  <br>  What did you do anyway ?|`|8rKZlLkFaa	I don't believe so.  I guess if you did something really bad, that congregation could kick you out.  But that is only if you did something almost unforgivable and they give you a restraining order or something.<br>  <br>  Generally, the answer would be No.|`|sVFkMVujaa	sure can be.  it's called a restraining order.  you can be banned from any place on the planet.|`|9BR3nBTCaa	lol i don't know maybe :L|`|PoNMnNPyaa	no u can't|`|50b696d6ca858cc9222722f864760f92aa	i don't know but probably yes ^^ sorry for not being so helpful|`|igI5yX0vaa	Yes, your own church.

Then when any sorta of tough guy came around they had to use a giant robot suit to win.  lame.<br>  <br>  ill take Liono against and flavor power ranger.|`|WCkEzzDpaa	This question is ridicuous man.  Cuz everybody in their right mind knows the Power Rangers are just good ol Japanese fiction and never really existed.   The Thundercats, on the other hand, are an integral part of intergalactic history.

Qua273wUaa	I am agree with u. this movie is not belong to India. this movie just on India. i am happy to got Oscar because of Indian artists and A.R Remain. but we are not called it INDIAN movie... this is a British movie. Our Indian director just know how to copy Hollywood movies , that is it..Who said our Indian director didn't make any great movie, they did, to make copy of great movie. for example :BLACK.|`|Ew6kXVWFaa	I saw this film.<br>  Before I saw it I was expecting a 'feel good' type film,I think this was because of the marketing about the film.This was very clever because the film was much tougher than I expected.<br>  <br>  Indian film makers are in business to make money,it is a huge industry and very successful,the phrase 'if it ain't broke don't fix it' springs to mind.|`|60b33bd45b92f5bdfaae46eb8ea6b583aa	It's a british movie about Mumbai, India, made by a british person.<br>  In my opinion, it's a good movie but not as well as it's been recieved. But then again, it portrays parts of India well but the guns, underworld thing as far as I know doesn't exsist in such a horrific and exaggerated manner. But hey, i reckon i need to watch it again to understand the plot..etc.<br>  Indian directors make movies for what the Indian public would like to watch, I for one being indian love the Bollywood movies and although the movies in my opinion were even better in the 90's I still love them. <br>  They make movies for the public in India, i think the movies they make are well recieved by the public there, they are not made just to win awards and such, they are made for entertainment which is their aim.|`|ml2FDYECaa	When it comes to making movies it's all about making money. Once in a while you get a genius like Danny Boyle who makes a Gem like SL. Every director has his style, and ideas into making a movie. Think of any American director, I mean a good one one who has put gold on the screen. It may have not been what it is now. It is not that Indian filmmakers are making movies to make money. They make great movies. It's their style...they are not lacking anything. How many television shows, and movies did it take for Danny to make before Slumdog. My top movies of all time are "The White Balloon, Children of Heaven" along with "Shallow Grave." They are great movies with different style of film making. I'm not Indian, nor English...does that mean I can't make a good movie? Love your topic, and hope you get some responses worth reading...TK

sJs0nuTSaa	She's not dead, she's in Europe.  If I remember correctly, at one point she married Jason so that he would lock her up if she went crazy like her mother did.  They eventually got a quickie divorce and she went off to Europe.  The last time they mentioned her was a fight between Carly and Jax.  He had run off during one of their many fights.  Carly suspected he went to visit Brenda.  Hope this helps.|`|NGNeT3rYaa	She wasn't dead.

Yes, Brenda was a special character and I think GH is still trying to fill the void Vanessa Marcil left behind. But fans are still awaiting for her return. She left town because Jax didn't marry her and humilated her at the alter after Carly told everyone that Sonny and Brenda kiss before her wedding to Jax, causing trouble for her in Port Charles.|`|CFZ4ISNNaa	Brenda's in Rome. Jax visited her last year during a Jarly break. There have been talks of the character coming back to GH, but just rumors. Vanessa Marcell says she has no plans of returning as Brenda.  On GH: Night Shift season 1 it was hinted that Brenda may have been a burn victim in an accident at GH...but it wasn't her.  We all miss Brenda too!!|`|EhBF31evaa	I loved Brenda too.  I really wish they could get her back even if only for sweeps or something.  She isn't dead.  She is in Europe (Vegas). LOL

Ow3O7h4caa	Stelliums in Libra are not uncommon. I have 5 planets in Libra 5th house. I focused all that energy on arts, arts, and more arts. I play music proficiently, toured, have my own business as a Graphic Artist and above all, love Astrology. <br>  <br>  Uranus rising trines my Stelliums and my Aquarius in 10th. I am into marketing and Publishing which corresponds to Aquarius in MC. As for your Stellium, the difference depends on your other planets and the aspects.<br>  I have a kite formation and use my Moon / Sagittarius as a focal point in 7th house.<br>  <br>  The only bad thing about so many planets grouped in one sign is that, under a bad transit from Mars or Saturn, it will hit those 5 planets. Even when squared or opposed. You need good supporting aspect to mitigate the bad.<br>  I have Jupiter in Libra as part of teh Stellium. Don't foret that the planets in the Stellium, even if not in close conjunction, can still do a tranfser of energy from one planet to another which acts like a conjunction and thus, link them together.<br>  <br>  An attunement to Air indicates that you can see things in a certain perspective. When the emphasis is too stron in Air, the mind is over-active which needs constant control and guidance. You live in your head and if there is little earth or fire to motive you to act on the ideas, you can become a dabbler in all sorts of things without much effect or developing much depth within yourself.<br>  With proper discipline, you can be an innovator in the world of thought. Just to point out a fact that statistics show more Nobel Prize  winners with Sun in Air than any other elements. <br>  The down side of this Stellium is that it can make you out of touch with your body, allowing your mind to run away to the point of exhaustion. The nervous system is higly activated and extremely sensitive and with many planets in air, you can use up energy more quickly thatn others since you are using it more. A restful period of recuperation or meditation is necessary to allow the nervous system to recharge itself and to keep the mind from driving you to a state of psychic exhaustion.<br>  Having said this, a change of scenery away from your usual work and domestic duties allows the mind to get out of its deep rut of worries, second thoughts and endless plans.<br>  <br>  Good Luck.|`|12VQ4ETcaa	A five-planet stellium is really strong.  Not very common.<br>  <br>  What it means is that you have an unusual focus in that house and that sign.  That means you have a stronger version of the positive and negative traits.  It's bad if you are not introspective.  It can be very good if you harness that energy and have a clear purpose.

O2hmjOPyaa	First of all, since you are not of legal age, you would need to hire someone to represent you (preferably someone that knows the ins and outs of the television industry- and no, someone from your family would not be a wise choice, unless they already have experience with this sort of thing). And, since you already seem to be having monetary problems, you probably won't be able to afford to hire someone like that. So, applying for a television commercial is not, in any way, a feasible way to make money.<br>  <br>  Get a part-time job if you're interested in helping to support your family.
4imsjgE2aa	Bette Midler <br>  <br>  "You Bette Your Life"<br>  <br>  Season: 4 - Episode: 23<br>  First Aired: 4/30/1997-<br>  <br>  Fran offers herself for the charity auction Mr. Sheffield is putting together with Bette Midler. A gifted 10 year old pianist, son of a big time investor, wins the auction and gets to have Fran as his babysitter for 5,000 dollars. Fran takes him to Yetta's retirement home and while entertaining the elderly with his piano skills, one senior collapses and dies in front of the kid. Shocked, he says he will never play again, and his father cancels the 5 million he promised to invest. <br>  <br>  Bette Midler goes to the mansion herself to teach Fran a lesson, but luckily Gracie picked up a few things from Fran over the past 4 years, which is enough to convince the kid to play again and his father not to back out on the investment.

wdcasADcaa	There is a rumor about Zack from All My Children (Patrick Thornhart) possibly joining the cast of One Live to Live.  I truly hope that this is not the case, because I love his character on All My Children.  I honestly think that the writers are going to pour it on heavy with John and Marty for a while (which I also do not like).  Ray may just have to wait his turn.  If they do bring Patrick Thornhart back, then it is obvious that Marty will go running back to him!|`|UY3zl9dFaa	I don't really see them together, but maybe he could be her new bff to replace Wes.|`|AA12336927	I don't know, i really think this is OLTL's way of giving us an insight to Ray's true self, so we can all get past thinking he murdered his wife.<br>  <br>   I gotta say, I'm so GLAD Vanessa will be going bye bye. Christian just looks like a big old sap right now.|`|fjNxzd6Baa	Possible, but I think their different perspectives on Tea Delgado may be a sticking point.|`|jHDeIPEfaa	It hadn't occurred to me but it is a good idea.|`|NGNeT3rYaa	They just might when I saw the preview yesterday the thought crossed my mind!|`|7XM4QJiuaa	Marty and Ray? I'm not sure that would work.|`|WjuSuKjoaa	No, I don't see that happening.  I don't know if A Martinez has signed a contract, so not sure how long he'll be around.  Maybe he can hook up with Carlotta, that would make Christian crazy, and since Antonio is leaving the show, it would give Chris a good storyline.  I also heard the rumor that because Thorten Kaye (Zack, AMC) isn't resigning with the show, he will come back to OLTL as the presumed dead Patrick, giving Cole some support and a 4 way love match between Patrick, Marty, John & Blair.  I'm not sure if Tea is hanging around, but you could always throw in her & Todd.... Wow, what a concept that would be!|`|Qc3svDzNaa	Nahhhh.  Maybe Zack will be with Marty - they are married in real life, ya know. Cassie DePaiva is a great actress but her storyline is old - no where for her to go. Dr and Mrs McBain should take their leave too - another dead end. Tuc is SO FUNNY - I LOVE his character but I guess he will be going back to Wisteria Lane.|`|DfbR2Traaa	Cant wait to see these storylines they sound like keep watching everyday especially for patrick {brownpenny{ thornhart.

After gaining some popularity you should start recording demos and start sending them to all record labels you wish to be signed in. It takes a lot of time and patience.

811ea9ca2ab8061aef7359c396ed9139aa	ohh, i agree. my dad likes watching WWE, or whatever its called now. its soo FAKEE, it annoys me.<br>  <br>  like, when the wrestler has the other guy in the 69 wanna be position && he drops to his knees or whatever. the other guy's head doesnt hit the floor! its so upsetting.):|`|O3l33DVJaa	Brock Lesner<br>  Dan Severn<br>  Ken Shamrock<br>  Tank Abbott<br>  <br>  These are just a few of UFC doing WWE & there was an interview with Ken Shamrock about the difference between Ufc & Wwe & he said well you dont get hit as much but you still have to maintain athleticism,endurance & strength ,for the most part everything is scripted but the energy put into it to get the crowd going takes alot out of you physically (so you do have to be mentally & physically prepared)<br>  <br>  I personally agree that one is more extreme than the other but lets not get ahead of our selves ,it still takes athleticism to still do the things that they do & some times they go to far to please the fans & it leads to major injuries to even deaths in the ring but i do agree that UFC is more violent & there is no script there (YET ?!)|`|hFojLOq4aa	They are actors and not even good ones, Mickey Rourke an actor can play a wrestler better than they can themselves. WWE is a joke.|`|FKaoaD2yaa	Should this q even be here? Pls dont get offended, but I think you'd get useful replies if you post it to the right section.|`|y2pErbI2aa	I'm not a fan of pro wrestling anymore, but I would say that they are hybrid athlete/actors. You have to be super strong (lifting up people, slamming them down, etc) and have lots of endurance to work a match. Wrestlers get beat up all the time, they take a lot of bumps a night, and they work every day.<br>  <br>  You should rent the old Tough Enough series if you're not convinced. It was a reality show that showed how wrestlers train, etc. It's actually pretty intense|`|FxAD44Moaa	DING!  you win!|`|T1qzML1Zaa	I agree with poalo. <br>  <br>  The definition of athlete is a person who is trained or skilled in exercises, sports, or games requiring physical strength, agility, or stamina.<br>  So they are athletes, they destroy their bodies for their sport/our entertainment. A lot of them don't live to be over fifty. Give them some credit.

NF1w4l04aa	you know what, I'm beginning to not like this friggin school she's going to more and more.  I think chimps would do a better job running it.  Your poor little one.  Personally, I'd talk to the teacher in person (as I have had to do many times many years ago) but a letter would more than suffice.|`|M7W7lZBBaa	Yes, def write the note. Have the teacher be on the look out for any rude behavior. They should have let her use the bathroom, well actually at that age they should have ALLOWED time for a potty break. I have chaperoned many a field trips and that was a must. Kids can be cruel, and she doesnt deserve ridicule for something that was not her fault. The teacher needs to be made aware of the situation.|`|3e817bbcd346c2c2745cc92bc09d0ef2aa	that's just not right.teachers should know they have small bladders in the first place.I would write a note.....and pour water on the pants of the kid that will make fun of her right before school starts tomorrow|`|YdXhZka8aa	Ooooh this sucks bad Jen but it'll die down soon enough. Put her teacher on guard so she can stop anything before it gets out of hand and let your daughter know she'll have to go in tomorrow.  It doesn't get any better by putting it off.|`|ZkDjl5I8aa	Yeah, definatley!<br>  If your child gets bullied because of this its the teachers fault.<br>  They should be providing a toilet, just like they would [hopefully] back at school.<br>  Expecially if they provided so much drink! Its out of order if you ask me.<br>  If your child continues to get picked on, tell the headteacher.|`|KAkiPY3kaa	Yes, the teacher(s) should be aware of the situation and have proper warning for any other kids that might make fun of her for it.|`|JNQezEGqaa	I work for a school system....<br>  and<br>  THAT WAS WRONG!!!<br>  First...those chaprones are the ones at fault and need to be called on the carpet....Shame on them!<br>  Second I completely and totally agree with Agent 47...go into the classroom and talk to the teacher....She needs to made aware...also, I would report this incident to the principal...as that is the person who can make sure this does not happen in the future.<br>  Third after reading some of the answers...I get the feeling this isn't the first problem you have had.....TAKE IT TO THE SCHOOL BOARD.  You have that right.  If the school is not addressing the problems appropriately get someone who will.....<br>  Do not put up with crap where your little one is concerned....<br>  Peace.|`|UYCvwh6Paa	I know I'm not a contact, but I must say, I feel for your daughter and if I were you, I'd be right pissed off at the chaperones and the teacher.<br>  <br>  Raise a stink with the principal and talk directly with the teacher.<br>  <br>  Kids have a bad enough time without irresponsible chaperones making it worse.<br>  <br>  I hope your daughter can live this one down, see if you can teach her to turn any cruel comments into a joke.<br>  <br>  Again, I do feel sorry for your child.|`|sVFkMVujaa	yes, write a note to the teacher.  also the principle, the bus driver's supervisor, and the superintendent.  someone seriously dropped the ball on this one.|`|5eArOiRxaa	Definitely give the teacher a note and tell her about your dissatisfaction. In a professional way, of course.|`|X3ma2Qu4aa	I'd bring her to school tomorrow and talk to that teacher face to face.<br>  Poor thing.  Tell her I wet myself when I was 25.|`|bYWTE40Vaa	nice phone call|`|YSTfOSOqaa	definitely Jen....let the teacher know, she needs to be aware of how upset it made your daughter...we went through the same thing....kids can be brutal at times...good luck hun!|`|E5rhAaLGaa	Awww, yeah. give the teacher a note and her a hug!|`|BJkfY3g4aa	Awww Jen...that poor little girl. She has been through far too much crap, now this? Yes I'd write a letter.|`|lijNJznEaa	just write an note, and give the teacher permission to beat up any kid who, if you'll pardon the pun, takes the PI55 out of her. <br>  <br>  oh yeh, and tell her it was a accident, and it's the chaperones fault. <br>  <br>  <br>  It is actually in the LAW that there MUST be provisions to use the toilet, under the Helath and Safety act.|`|XlhBBZPxaa	I would have been furious if that happened to my child... Write the note to the teacher and just tell your daughter the truth that everyone has accidents and it is nothing to be ashamed of. actually my youngest daughter is 8 and she still has a bladder problem and has her accident almost on a regular basis|`|V6Fxf3Dbaa	Sadly you can write all the notes you want but those kids are still going to find a way to tease her. The good news is that like the other kids shes 5 and the teasing will last about as long as the next kid shoots milk out his nose or eats a bug. They have short attention spans.|`|Usx5zMNRaa	I feel so bad for your daughter.  I don't have children, but I would definitely write a note explaining the situation and your daughter's possible humiliation.  I'd threaten the little asssswipe before he/she sees her :)|`|YtDp0wjdaa	if u make a big deal an tell her teacher 2 treat her special it will make them tease her more so u should let it go.  do u want them 2 tease her for the pee pants and tease her for the teachers note. =\|`|0154e31673244b2bea94b54516ec675aaa	you should actually speak to the teacher before school starts explain the whole thing and just let your daughter know it was an accident|`|DLuDg2vyaa	stupid chaperone's,<br>  yeah, write a note, and don't forget to write how silly it was to not give them a bathroom break.|`|Mu3UvybKaa	I sure as heck would! Try to prep her on how to handle any teasing that may come her way before she goes back to school. I've done that with my son & it made him feel a lot better.|`|PugkFRRpaa	Ah, so sorry. I see you on here every day. Yes you should, kids are ruthless.|`|uQUqZ7k5aa	i wouldn't write a note, i think maybe you talk to her face to face or over the phone.|`|AA11538538	I would go in and talk to the teacher.  <br>  <br>  I can't believe that they would take the kids on a field trip and NOT allow them to go to the bathroom before they loaded them back on the bus...I would talk to the prinicpal as well...that is just crap.<br>  <br>  While it probably won't stop the teasing, and it is no consolation to your daughter right now...something will happen next week to make them forget it.  Just keep givin' her your lovin and be there for her.  <br>  <br>  You'll both get thru it.

wdcasADcaa	I actually thought the remorse was genuine at the go red campaign (Babe's hospital wing event).  She was in tears on two different occasions...seeing Greenlee's picture on the Go Red poster, and then again when she gave her speech!  I mean, she is definitely colder than usual but that's because she woke up and her entire life has been rearranged.  She's been in a coma for three months, wakes up to find that she now is the proud owner of her brother's heart, her employee was killed in a tornado, her husband has a baby with her sister and has been carrying on with her sisters lover.  To top it all off...she killed her best friend in the heat of an argument driving down the wrong side of the road!  Just wait until she finds out that Zack is the reason that her brother is dead!!!  I truly think that is what is going to send her over the top!|`|UY3zl9dFaa	Up until today I would agree with you, but I agree with Gyn-E that she seemed quite sad and remorseful today.|`|jHDeIPEfaa	I don't like the new Kendall. I miss the love story of Zach and Kendall. I think AMC has screwed this up for good. How can she ever trust Zach again after he fathered Bianca's baby. I just hope that Thornsten Kaye renews his contract. His portrayal of Zach is much more interesting than that of Patrick Thornhart.|`|rRFiSOxuaa	Kendalls coma (second one, no less) plus her heart transplant leaves plenty of room for her to have a personality change.  She surely has some brain damage in this is a way it can manifest itself.  I don't think she's being mean on purpose as much as she's trying to deal with losing 3 months of her life while everyone seems to have moved on without her.|`|4sIyzL7Baa	She's filled with grief and guilt. She was driving the car. She's got so much to deal with right now.  It's the new Kendall they promised us.  Cold is cold.|`|VU7YIW5haa	She is acting so weird. I don't like it. I want the old Kendal back so she can fix things with Zach. Zach and Kendal Forever!!!!!|`|NGNeT3rYaa	Maybe it is a side effect from the heart transplant.Lack of emotion!
eVEUOGF4aa	Ha ha! <br>  <br>  <br>  I've been to Oakwood four times. Once when I was a baby, meaning I remember nothing, once with my parents when I was young, and twice with my school. I went on Megaphobia with my parents, this was my first ever rollercoaster. I sat next to my mother, we sat in the back cart (the one RIGHT at the end, meaning that's the fastest part). I sat comfortably, jumping with joy. The ride started, slowly it went up the creaking, wooden steep hill thing … AND THEN …. Well, let me tell you ... I could have died. I now officially have a phobia of heights because of that flipping ride! I wanted to hang myself when I stepped off that ride, I couldn't **** for three days straight, and I had/have nightmares about rollercoaster’s every single night ... They are my worst nightmare, it makes me wanting to vomit thinking about it, I actually have a stitch in my side when I hear it, I had to inhale VERY deeply when I read your question ... I know this sounds extreme, but I HATE it so much. That was my first time, and my last time. All my friends loves the rides, when I went with the school, my friends knew about my phobia and insisted they went on the baby rides with me (they didn't mind, but I felt so guilty about it, still we had fun). And ANOTHER bad thing about them, is the queue’s are horrendous. We had to queue for four hours, I swear. And that Megaphobia ride is so dangerous! I better stop writing now, before I pass out.|`|wyAbkG3oaa	Yes, and I hated it and never went on one again. I was not scared, I was terrified and felt like I was going to have a heart attack. Some people enjoy them because of the fear but I like my feet firmly on the ground.|`|NNtHuHCXaa	I loveeeee rollercoasters, they are wicked.. the really fast ones that go upside down and really fast... the adrenaline rush is amazing!!!!|`|UXKUJgEHaa	Yeah It Was Dudey :D .x<br>  But Once I Went On This One At Thunder World And It Was Called The Samuri And The Safety BAr Didnt Lock So I Was Like Holding It Down Whilst I Was Upside Down  :S .x Lol .x|`|AA10436809	Life is a rollercoaster.|`|4rdKpvPGaa	Yes at blackpool but i hate it.|`|1SzACFodaa	yep :) the theme parks in florida are AMAZING :)|`|RbGWftzmaa	yeh oblivion in alton towers the best ;)|`|iBH7NTl3aa	loved it hun!|`|ym7J7gToaa	Yeah, I love them.|`|d5LRSguMaa	iv been on oblivion|`|ODvnyAdlaa	i love them all! x|`|cZqGs6xCaa	yes, I love it.|`|KRJNjxJzaa	yep...<br>  liked it..<br>  i was down in mayo..<br>  (:|`|UgxF5nxhaa	yes i've been plenty of times <br>  <br>  my first time was two years ago.. when i turned 18 <br>  <br>  never riden one before that.... lol  seriously|`|j6RbKNmjaa	yep I have, love them worked on a fair|`|2g8m8USQaa	Many, many, many times.

He was having none of that because he felt it did not apply to him, so he drew the hydrogen atom on his forehead and it became his symbol.

8VlDuMFOaa	As much as I possibly can Baz. I may be just a small drop in the ocean, but I do believe that every little bit helps.<br>  <br>  I'll shop at the local small businesses~ eg fruit shop, butchers, bakeries etc rather than buy them from the supermarket giants that try to put these people out of business by beating their prices. <br>  Same as take away night...pizza is brought from the little family business down the road instead of someone like Domino's or Pizza Hut.<br>  <br>  I will not buy any form of furniture that is made from Rainforest timber..something I have been passionate about for a very long time, nor will I buy products that have been tested on animals.<br>  Eco friendly products are always my chosen preference, even if they do cost a couple of cents more.<br>  Even small things like eggs, I buy them from a local farm where the chickens roam around free and happy and are not stuck in tiny cages where they are fed hormones.<br>  <br>  And as always, I will always buy locally and Australian made products over imported ones to try to keep our economy strong.<br>  <br>  Ohhh..and I bank with a co-op rather than a bank, because I absolutely refuse to pay a fee for everytime I need to make a transaction!|`|VEXKm1Obaa	I always buy Energy efficient appliances nowadays.|`|a577675893457f8844900f790e549222aa	Buy home products.

CSC4zmgEaa	The reason they made him blind is because he was going to become a beggar on the streets, he was going to sing for money. <br>  <br>  If he was blind then passers-by would feel sorry for him and make his boss more money. <br>  <br>  After this part in the film Jamal says "everyone knows blind kids make double" or something along those lines.|`|fmnZF4YXaa	The previous answers were right on! This is the reason that I detested Slumdog. The violence against children and women - burning people alive - torturing people with electricity and drowning.  Come on, I see no reason to support such inhuman actions. No, I am not a prude and I actually enjoy action movies but not those that come directly from today's headlines. They don't even refer to these unfortunates as children but rather a "slumdogs".<br>  I went into this movie being led to believe that it was joyful and uplifting but instead found it depressing and dehumanizing. I have shared my opinions with my friends but judging from the success of this film, I feel like I am alone in the world harboring this opinion. What do you think? Is there something wrong with me?|`|vHktLKiMaa	So he would draw in sympathy from tourists. Make more cash signing on the corner. There are many street kids in India, the chance of stopping for a blind one is more common.
hFojLOq4aa	After I saw Dakota in "PUSH" she really proves that she can act way different from what you are use to seeing her. She palys a 13 year old girl with powers that is pretty creepy and messed up she can really act.

She's an excellent actress.|`|kvmWDuOJaa	I don't know of the girl you're talking about, but she looks very pretty.<br>  I think Dakota Fanning will probably make a good Jane, but I kind of think she's too young and looks younger than she is. I imagined Jane as being small and looking young, but I didn't think the book made it seem like she was in her early teens. Maybe I just got the wrong gist, though. =S<br>  I can only imagine her in the WOtW and she just seemed so young and creepy. Maybe she'll do a good job, I guess we'll just have to wait and see XD<br>  <br>  Please spare a few seconds of your time to vote for my school by clicking the below link?

2e41492627923affb8e7fc267ed04777aa	Being overrated doesn't take anything away from the music. Overrating something simply means that the media has over-hyped it. It still might be pretty good stuff, but maybe not worthy of what the media credits them.<br>  <br>  As for U2 and their music, they've done plenty good work with music, and much better than most. I rank them within the top ten bands - performing and composition.<br>  <br>  Obviously, you don't always have to agree with the critics. That would be ridiculous, wouldn't it?

xLO4m7snaa	If you go to YouTube there are many tutorials on there on different songs. It's really easy and many of them show step by step details. But if lessons aren't an option then the best way to learn it is by ear. What i did is I would get instrumentals and put them in my iPOD and listen to it over and over and over again. I played with the keys and after much practice I could play what I heard on the piano. You could try that. Here are some websites.<br>  <br>  gopiano.com<br>  pianotricks.com<br>  playsmoothpiano.com<br>  pianonanny.com<br>  <br>  there's more .. that's just a few.<br>  <br>  I hope this really works out for you.

XBGaYJ2waa	I don't think either would win, the Jedi would recognize the goodness in Superman and then they would team up and fight against all the bad guys.|`|zBkaqIWcaa	Point for Superman:<br>  * Jedi's are mortals (human or aliens) who would be knocked out if hit with Superman's force.

Superman would faint if Force-choked and fall back if force-pushed.<br>  ---<br>  Jedi giving in to ego?

I've seen him perform live twice and he holds down the stage himself with no help.  I respect that he writes and produces his own stuff and when he does performs he uses a live band and orchestra.  He's a solid emcee.<br>  Large Professor has been around longer, but isn't as "solid" of an emcee Kanye.

It constantly changes to fit something that's going on in your life. <br>  <br>  Love of mine some day you will die, <br>  But I'll be close behind. <br>  I'll follow you into the dark. <br>  <br>  No blinding light or tunnels to gates of white; <br>  Just our hands clasped so tight, <br>  Waiting for the hint of a spark. <br>  If heaven and hell decide, <br>  That they both are satisfied, <br>  Illuminate the no's on their vacancy signs:<br>  <br>  If there's no one beside you, <br>  When your soul embarks; <br>  Then I'll follow you into the dark. <br>  <br>  In Catholic school as vicious as Roman rule, <br>  I got my knuckles bruised by a lady in black, <br>  And I held my tongue as she told me, <br>  "Son, fear is the heart of love." <br>  So I never went back. <br>  <br>  If heaven and hell decide, <br>  That they both are satisfied, <br>  Illuminate the no's on their vacancy signs: <br>  <br>  If there's no one beside you, <br>  When your soul embarks; <br>  Then I'll follow you into the dark. <br>  <br>  You and me have seen everything to see; <br>  From Bangkok to Calgary. <br>  And the soles of your shoes are all worn down; <br>  The time for sleep is now. <br>  It's nothing to cry about, <br>  'Cause we'll hold each other soon. <br>  In the blackest of rooms. <br>  <br>  If heaven and hell decide, <br>  That they both are satisfied,<br>  Illuminate the no's on their vacancy signs: <br>  <br>  If there's no one beside you, <br>  When your soul embarks; <br>  Then I'll follow you into the dark. <br>  Then I'll follow you into the dark.|`|AA10309492	Imagine-by John lennon<br>  <br>  Imagine there's no Heaven <br>  It's easy if you try <br>  No hell below us <br>  Above us only sky <br>  Imagine all the people <br>  Living for today <br>  <br>  Imagine there's no countries <br>  It isn't hard to do <br>  Nothing to kill or die for <br>  And no religion too <br>  Imagine all the people <br>  Living life in peace <br>  <br>  You may say that I'm a dreamer <br>  But I'm not the only one <br>  I hope someday you'll join us <br>  And the world will be as one <br>  <br>  Imagine no possessions <br>  I wonder if you can <br>  No need for greed or hunger <br>  A brotherhood of man <br>  Imagine all the people <br>  Sharing all the world <br>  <br>  You may say that I'm a dreamer <br>  But I'm not the only one <br>  I hope someday you'll join us <br>  And the world will live as one <br>  <br>  (this song just just makes me think what the world would really be like if it was like what the song talks about.  it makes my mind go forever.........)|`|2OHjXfBKaa	um err just about any my chemical romance lyrics there so emotional!|`|0dnfyDWqaa	my thoughts were so loud i couldn't hear my mouth...my thoughts were so loud.<br>  <br>  <br>  it's cool

mD7eAAoNaa	The people above explained it to you, but here is a link and you can get your birth chart and it will tell you what your moon and rising, as well as other signs are:<br>  <a href="http://astro.cafeastrology.com/cgi-bin/astro/natal" rel="nofollow">http://astro.cafeastrology.com/cgi-bin/a...</a>|`|4VNFsmanaa	I would be happy to tell you what your moon and Ascendant are but I need your place and time of birth. Your sun sign is the sign that most people go by based on month, like you're a Cancer. Your Moon sign represents your emotions. And your Ascendant/Rising is how you present yourself to other people and the world.|`|ZS38T8M7aa	You can tell a lot from your sun rising, your ascendent, and your descendent.<br>  Basically they all will tell you what other signs of the zodiac you relate to.<br>  Although you may be a Cancer, you can just as easily have a Leo rising, which has to do with the time and/or year you were born, which contributes to your overall personality.<br>  Also important to remember is that you will not always have a different rising. It may stay the same as your original zodiac sign.|`|Hn3drOO3aa	Your typical Zodiac sign (the one you read about in the horoscope section of the newspaper) represents your "sun sign". There are supposedly other planets that determine your personality, not just the sun. People have "moon signs" as well.<br>  <br>  For example, you were born on July 17. What this means is that on July 17, the sun supposedly was passing through the Cancer constellation of the sky, from the vantage point of earth. I say supposedly because traditional zodiac signs, aside from being a bunch of hocus-pocus to begin with, actually represent the way the sky looked some 3,000 years ago and not today. You can read more about this phenomenon which changed the orientation of the stars (caused by the earth's "precession") here: <a href="http://cse.ssl.berkeley.edu/lessons/indiv/beth/beth_intro.html" rel="nofollow">http://cse.ssl.berkeley.edu/lessons/indi...</a><br>  <br>  Anyway, as I mentioned before, we have all kinds of signs -- a "moon sign", a "Venus sign", a "Jupiter sign", etc. This is because at the moment of your birth, the other planets were passing through other parts of the sky as well.<br>  <br>  Personally, my "sun sign" is Sagittarius while my "moon sign" is Scorpio. This supposedly means I have the traits of both Sagittarius and Scorpio. You can supposedly find exactly where the planets were aligned at the moment of your birth by going to a thing called a "natal chart" and entering the date, time, and coordinates of your birth.<br>  <br>  OR you could try another method that is just as accurate as zodiac horoscopes: throw tea leaves on the ground and then interpret what they tell you based on how they fell. :)

5BBy6G36aa	Yea the first guy who answered was right.<br>  It ended up being funny because Monk figured it out in the middle of the match. The third person in the game ( a girl) had NO idea how they were getting it right before the announcer asked the questions. So then she decided to randomlly start shouting out answers (what she thought they were doing) and she got them wrong.<br>  <br>  But of course, they arrested both of the guys and lived happily ever after.|`|PugkFRRpaa	he held the cards at angles. Say if he held it at the top right, that meant a, if top left that meant b, bottom right c, bottom left d. It was very clever.

e4h5yVXgaa	We'd get along wonderfully. 3 of my best friends are Gemini moons. 2 of them are Scorpio guys. Gemini moons are my favourite type of ppl.  So I would say find ppl w an ARIES moon!! I like fire and air moons by far. I certainly don't really get along w water or earth moons. <br>  <br>  I love to travel. I'm not much interested in the domestic life. I won't even consider marriage until I hit my 30's, and they have to be a free-spirit, as well. No ROUTINE, and I can't go w/o... I need my freedom right away!! I can sacrifice for my family, but I'll only truly be happy when I can have everything! So no kids unless I can still maintain my lavish lifestyle. I have a 4-yr degree and a career and I still am enrolled in college full-time, bc I need information! It's what makes me emotionally nourished!! w/o educational pursuits, I feel completely depressed and unfilled. I constantly need a challenge! And travelling? I've moved 25 (at least) in my life (not visiting or vacationing- but actually residing), I'm 24 btw. I've been to other countries to study(once) and for fun, but it's not enough!! I watch the travel channel and I swoon and get so excited, like "OMG!!! Look at that lucky girl in China!" "Oh look at that mountain side over looking the ocean in Italy!!" and I can literally just feel what it's like to be there!! But it's not enough! I've actually got to go! And I will one day! I've also go a Sag venus... so I don't take love relationships seriously, I've dated probably over 50 ppl for sure!!<br>  <br>  I'm telling you, find a sun and merceury water sign w/ an Aries moon, particularly... bc Gemini moons are my favorite. Make sure they have a venus in a fire sign.|`|84726b724d7d1fd7da09652c50425c38aa	Friendship- Gemini Sun, Cancer Moon<br>  Love- Gemini, Cancer, Leo, Sag|`|rnqgiRkWaa	you need to find someone with a libra moon. <br>  <br>  stay away from <br>  <br>  Taurus moon <br>  <br>  Cancer moon<br>  <br>   Pisces moon<br>  <br>  <br>  Mars in Cancer - Venus in Leo<br>  <br>  With Mars in Cancer you have a sensitive and moody sexual energy. Your need for emotional connection must be satisfied in order for you to fully enjoy physical sex. In fact, you are likely to become emotionally attached to anyone you sleep with. It's difficult for you to separate love and sex since they are, for your sign anyway, two sides of the same coin. You have a primal need to nurture and protect both yourself and those you love. This can make Mars in Cancer a sign that becomes too self protective and even passive aggressive in the pursuit of desires. Mixed signals are likely from this sign. When you are in pursuit of your desires however, you're likely to be very romantic.<br>  <br>  If the planet Venus is in the sign Leo in your horoscope then love is a grand, romantic adventure! In fact, you're an incurable romantic and with Venus in Leo you're likely to be in love with love. You need loads of attention and open displays of affection and anyone lucky enough to romance you will be doused with warm, generous gifts. Venus in Leo expects to be treated like royalty in love and sex, but you also know how to treat your romantic partner like the King or Queen of your castle in return. Venus in Leo has a tender ego and strong pride in love so you do need loads of validation and attention but you're free with compliments and have such a strong need to experience true love that once you find it, your loyalty knows no bounds.<br>  <br>  <br>  venus in scorpio would be ideal for you

SRVXka9Iaa	it is a fact that 80% bands fail after less than a week|`|hJP9y6kjaa	Be original. Be honest. Don't substitute fashion (ie trying to look cool) for real music. Do it for yourself, don't do it for money, or fame, or the glory of a "record contract", whatever. Have fun, but take it seriously - be dedicated to the art. My personal ethic is to treat it like a job - show up on time, show up ready, show up prepared to learn and grow, and practice like you're playing in front of a crowd, even if you aren't. Keep your gear well-maintained, practice recording material before you get into the studio (assuming you get that far), and be prepared to fail a LOT. Most bands don't work out - everyone has to be on the same page musically, be equally dedicated, and have the same goals. Even friends (or perhaps especially among friends!) it doesn't work out a lot of the time.<br>  <br>  Get over stage fright by practicing until you can perform the song without thinking about it.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Saul

But it could set you back an hour.. <br>  <br>  I'm not sure about the order, but I'm guessing Brokencyde and Haste the day will open first, and then Senses Fail, and then Hollywood Undead <3. <br>  <br>  Maybe just tell your parents there was a ton of traffic because the show was so packed?

wsJePb1maa	my ex believe it or not hehe<br>  for the better.  One of the most smartest guys I've ever met.  He never failed to wow my mind. <br>  Why I let him go, I dunno.|`|AA12201234	Yes.<br>  One of my first nights in college, I met this guy who was watching a football game in his dorm room. I knew that he would somehow impact my life, I just wasn't sure how. Little did I know I would marry him 4 months later. <br>  That was several years ago and I love him more everyday.|`|iizKx4Bvaa	everyone I meet always has an effect on me anmd or my life. I love people. <br>  My husband though definitely paved a nice route for us though. yakahulalulaloo.|`|PN7XMglOaa	Oh yes .

It is a matter of how perceptible the change is.  I changed schools my freshman year in high school, being vulnerable I befriended some people I would not have otherwise.  One of these new friends was jealous, I guess, and helped to put my life on a destructive course.  Of course I am responsible for the choices I made, so one should be very careful who they take on as a friend.|`|ASddA7FDaa	Someone did,<br>  but I was also secretly suffering,<br>  it's hard to explain,<br>  in the end I had to let him go,<br>  he changed alot,<br>  and so did I,<br>  and yeah,<br>  but I will always love him<br>  *-*<br>  I'm still always thinking about him.|`|ujsrruYmaa	yep,my physics teacher<br>  he wz d person which knew about everything<br>  and he enjoyed little moments of life<br>  n he wz a v down to earth person|`|sU6wSn05aa	Yep I met this guy one time and had like a four hour conversation with him that night. He read me like a book! We are still friends - nothing serious though.|`|bfDFWqc5aa	Yes. Seeing my daughter for the first time changed what type of person I was and what type of person I wanted to be.|`|aAD1JRgdaa	Nope, don't think that person will ever come and can't say that I'm wanting that person to come either.|`|iJbslaQNaa	YES AND BAD WAY|`|tCpBJynXaa	yes, in a very bad way...lol|`|CPWrxvE5aa	Yes...the IRS when they came to my front door !!!!|`|iVNAuo88aa	yes badly!|`|5fcvxZkfaa	Absolutly!

My current BF is one of them. We immediately knew we were meant to cross paths in this life; but at the time we had no idea it would end up in a 3 1/2 year love affair. (Especially since he's 26 years older than me.) But there was something inside me that knew this person was someone I was meant to be close with.<br>  <br>  And then there is my very best friend, whom I met the first day of church camp when we were 13. She is the light in my life, as well as the biggest pain in my *** and I wouldn't have it anyother way. I can't imagine what my life would be like without her. We've been through nearly everything together, weather we were 3000 miles apart or living in the same dorm room; we are in eachothers hearts where ever we go.|`|mggll8dRaa	Yes, I fell Head-Over-Heels, and Married Her, had 2 Children, and have been divorced for many years....!!|`|AA10838250	no|`|CEKZsoFRaa	Yeah and I think it was for the worse...verdict is still out on that!|`|T7qgrOJzaa	Yes.

43F4SI3paa	You would more than likely be a cashier. (That's the area of the store where you're least likely to get injured or have to use equipment).<br>  <br>  Not a bad first job. Your supervisors will be all over you, making sure you take your required breaks and lunches on time, since you're a minor. You wouldn't be allowed to ring up alcohol (if your store sells it) and you wouldn't be allowed to close (9:45 is the latest you could work).<br>  <br>  Also, you will be considered a minor by Target until you're out of high school, even if you turn 18 before that time.|`|3buQDaRDaa	It is better than working at a fast food place like I did for my first job. You would probably work at a register.|`|2ISGwSK7aa	I work at Target as a second job. For being 16 years old, its an ok place to work. You will get about $7 an hour and you can only work until 9:45pm at night because you are a "Minor." Its an ok place to work. NOt the best, but not the worst.

iuWfp2fEaa	Only take a bath or shower once a week. You will not only save on your water and energy bill, it will also discourage unwanted guests, which will further reduce your costs of entertaining and feeding them!|`|M7W7lZBBaa	go to the dollar or 2 dollar movies, it's even cheaper than renting a movie and you can see them usually before they hit dvd<br>  <br>  buy groceries in bulk, large sizes, and break it down and store or freeze <br>  <br>  dont buy fast food, eat out or anything like that.<br>  <br>  Dont turn off your heat/air, a lot of people think they are saving money by doing that when they are not home, when in fact they are costing themselves more by having to heat the entire place (or cool it off) after being off. Instead, turn it down or up as needed.|`|nkmwGAKjaa	The trend now seems to be giving up land line phones.<br>  <br>  Turn your computer off when done.

That will save about $7.00 a day.<br>  <br>  Make your own coffee or tea in the morning and take it in a travel mug.  Savings - $2.00 a day.<br>  <br>  When you buy something, only pay with dollar bills and put the change aside.  At the end of each week, throw all the silver in one clean coffee can and all the pennies in another one.  In about 6-7 months you should have about $150.00 in just quarters, dimes and nickles.<br>  <br>  Instead of going to the movies, join Netflix.  They have a 2-movies a month program for $4.99.  Even if you take the $8.99 a month plan, you still can watch all the movies you want and pay less than the cost of one ticket at the theatre.<br>  <br>  Instead of running an errand at lunch every day, make a list of the things you need and do one lunchtime trip a week.  Saves on gas.|`|ffab01a92e978af828e5f1703775e5ddaa	Pay yourself first. Every time you get paid, make a deposit or a transfer to your savings account before you do anything else. Even if it's only $5.00 each check, you'll learn that once you've moved the money into that "savings" account, you won't miss it.

twVyisGnaa	I love watching gangland and gang documentaries!  Some of my favorite shows ever.  Seriously, these gangs are just pure monsters, a shame to the Latino race, and freaks of nature.  I hope they all die.<br>  <br>  Anyways, maybe the ms-13 gang just does a lot of rape, and it shows more than with other gangs, and they are in 48 American states, and they control part of Central America.  When they do a lot of raids in Central America, that's when they do a lot of rape.  I don't know much about bloods or crips, but I'm guessing that they really do focus on other stuff other than rape.<br>  <br>  Here's a link to the gangland site.  They have info on all the major gangs in the U.S and Central America.<br>  <a href="http://www.history.com/minisites/gangland" rel="nofollow">http://www.history.com/minisites/ganglan...</a><br>  <br>  Try doing some research on Google and see whatever else you find.  Hope this helps!<br>  <br>  VIVA LA RAZA!|`|Kw2IMCdZaa	You mighta missed the ones that did say crips and bloods rape. I never heard much of that from crips but in a documentary i saw once said a girl had a choice to fight her way into the gang or let the whole gang hit it.

gnucbiExaa	I think people wanted it to be just as good as the original Woodstock and honestly, nothing could ever compare.  It has nothing to do with how good the bands were at either one, more the people and the mood and energy.|`|grifjdr0aa	cuz you can't compete with Woodstock.|`|Ev5YsBqhaa	There was alot of riots, It was 100 degrees. Girls were raped, Bottled water was $5, a slice of pizza was $12, people did crazy ****. Those are the only reasons I can think of why people say it sucked, but the music was very good and there were great performances.|`|fEKCRmv8aa	it was insanely hot outside.  It wasn't organized well.

80lWqRFiaa	Oh no, you just brought back a bad memory. My boss years ago mind you, came to work in a skirt and pantyhose with his legs shaved. True story, it was just a week before Halloween and I started laughing, just could not help myself. Turns out he was a cross dresser and I seemed to be the only employee who did not know it. I felt horrible, and left shortly after that episode. Just could not look him in the face again.|`|t9htoO50aa	When I make gestures at my boss I make sure he's watching.|`|3TLuSf9Yaa	Yes & thats why I don't work there anymore, knew more than she did.|`|b138671ae3255ea398ff2f873fbf25e8aa	Oh U know it!|`|XAioHGKbaa	Sawman and I work together and I am the boss....lol.....yes he has caught me making faces at him and other things|`|AkKqcKX2aa	yes|`|votsoxeGaa	Not in recent history. ;-p|`|P8uh4joQaa	once my teacher caught me pointing a laser pointer at his head.

jlHz0Fg1aa	I prefer the sweet kiss of death|`|0p9wHjSWaa	I dig forehead kisses.  They are so innocent.<br>  <br>  Well, I havent ever had to tell anyone they are a bad kisser.  I have a rather big mouth and the guys I have made out with have big mouths so they went together pretty harmoniously.  I did make out with a guy once though, not too long ago that wouldn't stop sucking on my lip, in a weird way, so I just stopped making out with him and went to another room.<br>  <br>  He got the hint.|`|c5a50631f90f4ba04d88c923dc2aa963aa	i have not frenched since i was19.. its been over a decade + since i kissed so the memory is vague!|`|JWSCTek3aa	how do you zay eet ? oh yes...<br>  <br>  zee french style mon chi chi.|`|VXCCjdZhaa	*crotch explosion*|`|m3ThrbDMaa	It just so happens that I am the world's greatest kisser...(I've been practicing for years now, and I think I'm finally ready to try it with a girl...blush)|`|DjifToZgaa	There is a subtle science to kissing.<br>  <br>  It's in the conveyance of energy and an electric activation of the senses with the utmost care.<br>  <br>  I prefer battery of kisses, each intended to provoke a reponse.<br>  <br>  First the lift of a chin gives way to the delicate stroking of tongues without full contact of the lips.  A nibble to the nape of the neck, with a whisper in the ear may follow.<br>  <br>  Tender sucking of the lower lips before a more decisive exchange with tongues.  So slight that one can sense the texture of the tongue, and discriminate it's texture and subtle movements.<br>  <br>  There's no need to rush whatsoever.  Less contact is better initially.<br>  <br>  Sadly, there may not be a solution.  You either can do it well, or you can't.|`|8a262a9c5496ee057e063ab90852f0c4aa	Pecks -- ugh.  I'm with you. Well, not literally, unfortunately.  Crash Davis in "Bull Durham" said it best:  "I believe in long, slow, deep, soft, wet kisses that last three days."<br>  <br>  Well, not literally three days.  I believe Crash was employing hyperbole, but you get the picture. Anyway, it's been my experience that you can teach somebody how to "do it" (it's kiddie time on Yahoo!) easier than you can teach them how to kiss.  Especially the peckers.  Well, not literally the "peckers," but...no, wait. Yeah, literally.|`|AA11538538	I prefer the savor and lots of tongue too.  I hate it when a guy jams his tongue in my mouth right off of the bat and thrusts it like he's....<br>  <br>  go slow...lots of tongue, and nibbling...<br>  <br>  the ones that peck and do it hard and fast annoy me as well...and take care of yer facial hair...it shouldn't poke or rub me raw...|`|hz7Ek1HKaa	I open my mouth, smash my lips against theirs,  and jam my tongue down their throat... <br>  <br>  OK no I don't, but that practically describes my ex husband and I tried teaching him and telling him and  whatnot. but alas it wasn't so. It got to the point when I hated him coming near me!!|`|DzIlM76Xaa	I'm so hot right now. Slow, tongue-y, and savory is about right.|`|VtToRnykaa	Why wouldn't you want him to spend his energies kissing you where it counts the most?|`|5eArOiRxaa	(((1thousand)))<br>  <br>  In this instance, I prefer to let the girl take the lead. I can just go with the flow...|`|Rx6p8Cvfaa	between my legs is fine|`|LdBCvUu0aa	i like long, passionate, slow, tongue kisses that makes your body flash with heat, and curl your toes... <br>  <br>  the ones that are so hot, there is no need for any fore-play, or maybe even no need for sex, the kiss took care of it all...|`|tcSimSSaaa	(wishes he was a ShamWow rep right about now...)<br>  <br>  <br>  Holy Oz reruns, Batman, how wrong did Crash make me feel?!!<br>  "Show us on the dolly where the bad Garfield touched you..."

AA11596713	the only reason for marriage is to have a label and to please parents... and it will get rid of the Guilt if you have kids. <br>  <br>  I'm engaged and i only see it as a label.|`|z9hRuFDiaa	I think it's overrated, but is very useful in some situations. If something happened to me and I was unable to make a medical decision that may save my life, it's good to know that my husband will make the decision that I would make if I was in a stable state of mind. Other than that, it's just a legal document, a piece of paper.|`|PAA4uWPuaa	Yeah<br>  It gives you a piece of paper that says according to the state you have the right to love each other and pull the plug, if need be.<br>  <br>  Edit: Looks up at my darling Siva and wonders WTF?<br>  Maybe I am thinking of the ceremony that leads to getting a piece of paper. I could stay true to my spouse with or without that paper. A commitment is between he and I...a marriage is nothing more than someone else recognizing that commitment...I really don't need that, except for legal reasons.|`|vGbTKA2Haa	I would love to get married! but mostly for the wedding cuz I love planning weddings! <br>  <br>  My parents have been together for 25+ years under common law and we consider them to be "married".. no need for a license or a church ceremony<br>  <br>  I see marriage as way to have secure written rights in case a couple separates and they have children, property, etc..<br>  <br>  Kris, my parents are committed to each other and my father gave us his last name|`|tvdabilNaa	I think there is really no reason for the institution as we know it.  And a wedding only fills others pockets.  I think if people want to commit to each other and have children, a legal document is sufficient.  I am appalled at the money people spend on weddings, which 50%+ have a snowball's chance in Hell of being a success.|`|f9b40efd5b7600a550f492fb27e76707aa	No, not at all.  I highly recommend it to anyone in love and has enough respect for themselves and the person they have given their heart to do it.|`|vmlArXqAaa	sommetimes. like my aunt's friend got married last year just to get married. the guy who she married was a sexist jerk drug dealer who cheats on her but she won't believe anyone who tells her so. but im pretty sure thats just blatant stupidity.|`|17100981ca59977dbefa374ecd987125aa	no I don't think so.. if you love someone and you want to be with him or her forever than it's good.. but if you marry someone who you don't love but because of his or her money than I think it's superficial|`|IHwMbLX5aa	Well... it just shows you are committed to the person. And it makes it easier on the kids when the whole family has the same last name.|`|Kg681jL8aa	it is ok but i think it is superficial, there really is no reason for it.|`|UIzaamJ7aa	There is but what happened is that the whole world is shallow now.

I think it is "normal ficial"?|`|7ee11f32ce402e558134b3f3e6323823aa	I think it was you make it...I personally don't feel the need for the paper, but that doesn't mean marriage is superficial..I know some loving couples who are (and have been) committed to each other for the long haul..nothing superficial about it. Just , to each his own.|`|8f79a6907c34a502a5158ce4ade3c011aa	No.<br>  <br>  Marriage is the ritual that changes a man into a husband. Without marriage men are far more likely to trade women in for a younger model every few years. <br>  Also marriage served as a method of assurance to a man that any child a woman Had was his child thus he was responsible for it. Without marriage it is very easy for a man's fear of commitment & responsibility to dismiss any children that he may be the father of, by saying "how do i know that it's mine?"<br>  <br>  This is why evolution has shown the benefits to the survival of the tribe by having marriage. in fact i would say marriage is the foundations of the social contract that binds society together.<br>  <br>  Then again I'm an unmarried guy so what do i know.<br>  <br>  _()_<br>  <br>  (edit) @ Darling QueenofYack, i took the question to be about the idea of "marriage", not the "marriage ceromony" or "legal marriage". but the concept that we call "marriage".<br>  I may have missed the point of the question :-/|`|cuIX13BKaa	It is "We" who give meaning to any ritual or contract....marriage included. personally I do NOT think it is necessary save that it binds us and legally we are (allegedly) closer...nothing could be further from the truth. Only people can be superficial....and then anything takes on less meaning.<br>  <br>  Garbo|`|C6ZJcNJjaa	Marriage is all about property.  I am not property.|`|AA10283080	Only to those who make it superficial.<br>  <br>  Some people know how to put meaning and purpose into their marriage.|`|jYmvtUC5aa	....if you feel strongly enough about each other to want to be <br>  together, why do you need the state to tell you it's ok.....|`|s1zitZMOaa	Yes and no. There isn't an absolute reason for it. Obviously people are able to get divorced and it doesn't make a couple committed - people cheat and do all sorts of horrible things to their spouses. But, when you are married it is not as simple to just pick up and leave as it is when you are dating or living together without the contract of marriage. Marriage makes a relationship a legally binding contract and in order to get out of it you must at least go through some sort of legal effort. Most people aren't just going to disappear in the middle of the night, never to be seen again (though that can and does happen). <br>  <br>  Would my relationship with m husband be any different if we were not married? No, it wouldn't. But saying "my husband" says to the world that we have made as much of a commitment as we can and it says that to each other as well. Some people have negative feelings about marriage - that's fine and I can understand those feelings, but I have positive feelings about the word. Marriage to me says that I love this person, I intend to stick with it, and I'm willing to make it a legally binding contract.|`|6UlOorwMaa	marriage is not superficial unless a person enters marriage for a superficial reason. I personally don't think we need a piece of paper to commit ourselves to someone but maybe just for legal purposes. I have known couples who have been together for more than 30 years and they are totally committed to each other|`|eS9nPWqBaa	I don't think there's a reason for it.<br>  <br>  Be faithful, love each other move on with your life.  <br>  <br>  I've met so many people that are cheats or stay married "bec it's the right thing to do".<br>  <br>  Community States - "Whatever I have is yours" - no fool, get your own crap.|`|6k5fhFyBaa	I think it's meaningful when you find the right person. But I don't think the greatness is comprehensible if you haven't met that person yet.|`|a1566efb5533aa90596e330bc315a547aa	There certainly is a reason and you shouldn't ever forget it. I think this country, US, they marry too soon and that's why they are unhappy but most marriages are good.|`|AA11644298	No, marriage is not superficial<br>  <br>  And yes, there is a reason for it|`|50UbJp14aa	there is to live and have kids|`|AA10838250	no

voETd7tSaa	I like it. However, FDR was reviled by the rich. He did not pull us out of the depression, WWII did, but he gave Americans hope.

voETd7tSaa	Not a bad idea. You should be hired as a consultant. How does $125,000 sound like for a retainer fee? How much bull do we have to put up from the government? This really stinks. True story. In the Oregon coast town of Bandon(well known cheese making area with lots of dairy farms) the town has harnessed the power of methane gas created by the god awful stench that emanates from the cow barns, and it has used this power to generate electricity for the entire community. One man's cow shitt on the bottom of his boot is another man's power source. Keep those cow farts coming.

8ad6fQiNaa	Comics tend to bend the rules of reality. Although Batman is portrayed as a "normal" person with no powers, he still has the superhuman ability that the comics endow into him. He has the magical abilities of oppurtunity and fast travel.<br>  <br>     While he's routinely on patrol, he'll "happen" upon crimanal activity all the time. If you were to drive around NY city for 8 hours every day, you might come across a crime once every few weeks. With Batman's comic ability he finds a crime a night. That's just not humanly possible.<br>  <br>      Also he's tied into the police frequency. Whenever a crime is reported, he knows about it. When it's a big crime, he'll go to it and usually arive before the cops. He could be across Gotham and he'll get to a crime beside the precinct quicker than the cops. That's just silly.|`|0g2fDpUbaa	Well, if you saw the Dark Knight movie, you saw a bunch of guys being "Batman" and failing miserably.

yqe0I5zpaa	I know right, i was just thinking about how many ANTI-Suburb movies their are.<br>  <br>  Sam Mendes has made TWO movies about the suburbs in a bad way (he directed American Beauty and Revolutionary Road)|`|sVPjp3dUaa	The reason is because suburbia has many secrets. The facade is based on the fact that everyone is happy, as long as no one sees what goes on behind closed doors. Big cities get a rap for being congested, crime infested, dark places. And more often than not, big cities have a lot more to offer and people are portrayed as being more up front with others. Suburbanites always get the nice house, good job, 2-3 kids with a dog. But that kind of life is also portrayed as boring. Many people in the suburbs DO put up a front because they don't want to be seen as a bad or eclectic person. They want to fit in with their surroundings much more than city people, so they tend to hide their secrets. That's why their facade is seen as empty, because people just can't be themselves.
AA11898755	Tim Burton has a delightful sense of the macabre, but next to Gilliam seems remarkably light and flat. Gilliam offers not only a sometimes frothy take on the macabre, but a wonderful intellectuality and sense of irony that brushes seductively up against schadenfreude. Even so he never degenerates into bitterness and hubristic judgement , rather wistfully hovering above like God's holy fool, a witness. His intimate and cogent representation of intra-apocalyptic angst coupled with his dense visual expression serve as a fully formed subtext to his equally potent narratives.   Tim Burton is surely sophisticated, but frankly he is more like Gilliam for beginners.|`|JCJVi8Qraa	T.G. Twelve Monkeys!|`|5be9aa5e850f569d457ff490fdccb316aa	Thats tough. Both have outstanding films and a few monumental failures. If forced to choose, I would go with Tim Burton because he is more consistent and has a larger body of work. Both have such identifiable and unique styles, especially visually, with rich use of their respective artisitic backgrounds. I enjoy boths' work immensely. <br>  <br>  Tim Burton:<br>  Pee Wee's Big Adventure - good fun. interesting first feature film.<br>  Beetlejuice - terrific. so unique and visual appealing<br>  Edward Scissorhands - arguably his best film, utterly brilliant<br>  Batman - redefined the superhero/comic movie at the time<br>  Batman Returns - decent and enjoyable sequel<br>  Nightmare Before Christmas - terrific, a unique classic, even though he didnt direct<br>  Ed Wood - often overlooked masterpiece<br>  Mars Attacks! - quirky, often overlooked film that was fun but had its faults<br>  Sleepy Hollow - pretty good actually, very enjoyable<br>  Planet of the Apes - terrible and unecessary<br>  Big Fish - my favorite Burton film. so heartfelt and visually mesmerizing<br>  Charlie and the Chocolate Factory - once again terrible and unnecessary, but had a few good moments<br>  Corpse Bride - good, not great<br>  Sweeney Todd - once again, visually fantastic. Pure Burton.<br>  <br>  <br>  Terry Gilliam<br>  Monty Python and the Holy Grail - best Monty Python film<br>  Jabberwocky - weird and enjoyable, but not that great<br>  Time Bandits - very good, but forgotten <br>  The Meaning of Life - not bad, but weaker than other Python films<br>  Brazil - terrific, probably his best film. such a uniqe vision<br>  The Adventures of Baron Munchausen - confusing and too crazy, but watchable and enjoyable<br>  The Fisher King - very good, distinctly different from most of his other works<br>  Twelve Monkeys - very good also, if you liked it watch the short film its based on "La Jetee," its even better<br>  Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas - one of my favorites from Gilliam, next to Brazil. So entertaining with brilliant performances, but overall a pretty hollow film that doesnt capture the essence and meaning of the novel<br>  The Brothers Grimm - interesting, but not very good. Not his final vision due to studio interference.<br>  Tideland - terrible and confuddled, but still visually unique to Gilliam<br>  <br>  <br>  As for the respective directors, I am looking forward to both their upcoming films:  Burton's Alice in Wonderland and Gilliam's Dr. Parnassus.  Burton may be the perfect director to tackle Alice in a weird, visually appealling way. Although when Burton tackles previous works (Charlie and Choc Factory, Planet of the Apes, Sleepy Hollow) they are his weakest films, but Batman was good, so who knows.<br>  Dr Parnassus looks like the quintessential Gilliam film and looks like it could be one of his best since Brazil, and not just because of Heath Ledger's death, although that will make it more appealing to a wider audience than Gilliam's films are used to getting. Also, supposedly Gilliam's take on Don Quixote with Johnny Depp is back on track after its numerous previous failures (as seen in the brilliant documentary Lost in La Mancha)|`|zovrJ0yXaa	terry gilliam. his movies are as weird as the best of them but theres a depth to them that you dont find often. his movies provoke a lot of thought and discussion. plus they have a great sense of humour carried over from the pythons. burton is great for making imaginitive fairy tales but personally i prefer guillermo del toros fantasy movies|`|MouJoCo3aa	Tim Burton all the way! All of his movies are absolutely amazing! Especially Sweeney Todd!

Hes Awesome!.|`|VuGMOf4Caa	No it doesn't make you a bad person <br>  But just don't be mean to people who do - that would make you bad.|`|wZloBlGlaa	nope|`|ekEj2Mbiaa	No, you're not.|`|e7c28740060350d2f181d79ca9b56dffaa	no|`|6pk6HnuSaa	no - you are a bad person if you post God questions in P&S ?|`|toLCaFc9aa	No, I don't believe in him either.|`|mJmG3i4Oaa	no|`|MPba9IUBaa	no<br>  i agree|`|gnucbiExaa	It doesn't make you a bad person.  But there is also a lot of good in the world that suggests there is a God and He is good.|`|4EflpUK8aa	Not at all.

I agree that it is hard to believe in god when there is so much hurt and pain in the world.  But I believe it is Satans doing to try to take us away from God by creating the misery this in turn tests our belief.  Temptations and evil are put in the way to help us to trust and believe in God.|`|AaXl5YYkaa	it doesn't make you a bad person, but you are a lost person. the pain and suffering is not of gods doing. satan creates it. and besides, how are people supposed to die if nothing happens to them? the world would be so full it might fall right out of gravity.  ok maybe not but you get my point. sometimes satan does bad things to us to test our faith in god. it has a story about job in the bible and it happened to him. you are not a bad person, but you would be a better person with god in you.|`|mvIMPpSIaa	no. you can't be in a bad person for not believing in god. believe what you want don't choose a religion just because you feel like you're forced to|`|632BbbUtaa	of course not. i dont believe in god either. doesnt make me a bad person. the other things i do in my life make me a bad person.|`|st2zmU88aa	No, ur allowed to believe what ever u want,<br>  just don't expect everyone else to agree with u.|`|6ClURMmWaa	Nop.<br>  everyone has different opinions.|`|vxEWguqqaa	I believe in God.<br>  <br>  But no you are not a bad person. You have your own believes just like everyone else.|`|XTWClFLQaa	No, I'm agnostic and I don't think I'm a bad person.|`|sixm6Vlraa	No not at all. Everyone is entitled to their beliefs. That just happens to be yours. there are many people who do not.|`|de29070765c097b8f505a737e52df5bfaa	Not at all. And just keep telling yourself that when you are burning in Hell!|`|wVOaRoKvaa	No it don't make you a bad person... it just what you believe..|`|6Htq80Z9aa	No way man, not at all|`|hSDWIslFaa	You'll only be considered a bad by those who believe in God. <br>  <br>  It's interesting, they say they do not judge, but religious people, or at least Christians, are so quick to label a person bad or good. You don't believe in God, you have a logical argument for not doing so, and you're not going around judging people who do not conform to your belief system. Yet, you're the bad one. Hehe, funny stuff.<br>  <br>  Nah, you're just a person. Belief in god makes one neither good nor bad.|`|dpCsTIEIaa	No, everyone has a right to their own opinion and religion. I'm a christian and I do not look down on you for that. You do not have any effect on my beliefs. Being a christian and would like to remind other christians God is the only one to judge.|`|20y5KZbraa	No, you're not a bad person.  Everyone is entitled to their own beliefs, and believing there is no God does not make you a bad person.|`|64515c9dd3f1d42fce2093056b18e17aaa	yeah. fire and damnation. lol. <br>  <br>  i'm so teasing. ignore the hypocrites in the room. <br>  <br>  do your own thing and a happy productive life is your reward.|`|gLJBnqYmaa	No you're not.<br>  <br>  But he does care. The reason he doesn't fix it all is because without suffering there would be no joy. And everything happens for a reason.|`|LbBGjnX0aa	No.<br>  You sound extremely intelligent to denounce godgobber and godsmuck rubbish.|`|teSCVfRoaa	You are only bad when you do bad things.|`|Lqy9Lc9Oaa	No.  Only hurting other people in life is a bad person.|`|5LMm9AWZaa	no your not i dont belive iin god, if he was real why are we all in so much pain and hunger|`|eH2zEXVAaa	no, look into richard dawkins|`|aIjOfkM8aa	No, it doesn't.

And it is so disappointing!<br>  <br>  New format - stinks.  <br>  New Judge who repeats Paula - stinks.  <br>  New Contestants show 1: Loved 'Em.  <br>  New Contestants show 2: Too painful to watch.<br>  <br>  Would they put the Queen of England on as the Half-time Show of the Superbowl to tell people to get to a museum?  No - that would be ridiculous.  Yet, last night they put on that Norman person to mock the audience and show?????????  Worse, there were qualified kids from the first show who would have won last night.  <br>  <br>  Thank you for the opportunity to be disappointed with you.  It's one of the few shows we still watch.

When my teacher introduced me to the director, she grabbed both of my hands, and looked straight into my eyes, and said "No! You're Martin Sheen!" This was in the mid 80's. I have no idea what she was talking about. I've never thought that I looked or sounded anything like him.<br>  <br>  Guy - An obvious cop asked me for drugs at a concert. That or he was a Mormon.

AA11923447	No. In fact, I had the opposite problem. It was very difficult for me to cry. When I was a toddler, the response to any sign of tearfulness was a punch, or getting smashed against the wall. I became rather emotionally cold due to years of abuse and neglect.

PIeronuZaa	It does me, that's why its a good idea to keep your mind as fresh as long as possible, meaning that if you allow your consciousness to dismiss the meanings and effects of your ventures and experiences in this life because of neglect, then you are setting yourself up for some not very golden years perhaps..best to try and keep an open mind during your lifespan so that when the answers to your questions your mind/body/spirit consciousness have long searched for appear, you will hence be prepared, able to comprehend memory and understand..unlike one with hereditary or genetic distortions or malfunctions of the mind like senility, who will be left behind,..plus because of diseases such as Dementia or Alzheimer's which will render ones mind/body/spirit complex with a disabled consciousness and mind, which tends to cause physical maladies and incapacitations as well,..during the final days of ones life on Earth.|`|9qUnD0sBaa	Yes it does.  We are constantly in the now with a moment ago past and the moment to come future. By what we do in the now we affect the future, and consequently the past,  we are in control of every aspect of our time.  We by controlling our future time also impact others time as well.|`|556f6a84a1e72fa5f9fa440c37251fe4aa	It's possible that it does.  Consider that many physicists these days, in their efforts to make a combined Theory of Everything, have resorted to making *time* cancel out on the level of mathematics to explain everything else.<br>  <br>  Meaning?  A large chunk of your top scientists subscribe to a theory that renders time *imaginary*, or more precisely, it makes time a calculus, or way of thinking that helps people who think too much (all of us) make sense out of cause and effect.<br>  <br>  And so, if time really is a tool the brain uses to make sense of the world...it makes sense that a mind could alter the way that tool is used.<br>  <br>  This may or may not change things for other people though.

It was only 10 months...but I only could talk to him like once every 6 weeks and he's a Marine, and most of the time he couldn't tell me where he was or what he was doing, I was sooooo scared to death), I decided it would be a good idea to go to school online and have 3 jobs at the same time. I worked roughly 80 to 90 hours a week, and did all my school work all day Sundays. I thought that would make me think about him less because I was busy. <br>  <br>  Wrong! It just made me more stressed and crazy. I ended up getting into two car accidents in a row, had to get my wisdom teeth taken out, and I was always sick because I was so stressed. <br>  <br>  My advice, take it easy. Relax. Don't make yourself too crazy with activities or a job. But don't just sit in your room and cry all day either. You have to be productive. I started helping out the USO and sending care packages to soldiers. That REALLY helped me feel like I was doing something. It didn't take my mind off of him, but it helped me feel better.

I saved up $800 for a piece of crap car, got a little apartment, a full time job, and enrolled in school.<br>  If I can do it, you can too.|`|iFTa9FqZaa	....probably not unless you have over $10,000, and thats if you use the dorms for only the school year, apartments are much more, so you'll have to have more $ to make it through the summer. Plus you have to have money for tuition, which is anywhere from $4,000-50,000 depending on the school.|`|fCHH1ZQYaa	My family want me to get out, I'm goin straight to LSU to party :) But hell yeah, don't let anyone tell you that you can't do it on your own.

They're the cute ones.|`|jRpT3a4waa	I'd rather live maybe somewhere in my eighties. Because people who live until they are 100 suffer alot. They can hardly walk, and diapers? No thank you!

rH2LcH9waa	No, there is nothing at all wrong with feeling that way. To still have a passion like that for your partner after 6 years is a great thing that many couples are constantly striving for.  I can tell you that I know many men and women alike that enjoy have sex multiple times daily. Most women enjoy sex just as much as their male counterparts. Throughout society it is been told different but I assure you it is not. It is very important to make time for you and your partner, and you really should feel great about yourself for maintaining it. With the schedule you seem to have I am sure it is difficult to find the time. As for your other guy friends, it may not be completely the woman's fault or choice. There are many daily reasons a man or woman may not feel up to having sex, and this is still normal.|`|AA11596713	well..my fiance wants to have sex 4 times per day.. but that's just ridiculous because we only see each other during the night.  so it's once/day unless i'm menstruating.. i won't allow him to touch me.

QZtRVdRtaa	I am neither.<br>  <br>  'Kira' is a relitive term. I feel nobody has the right to take the life of another, no matter what reason they have to justify it. Even though Light killed criminals in jail for the thought of 'Justice', he didn't have the right to take the life of another, nor was there any way to know all the facts. Light was a genius, but  as we see throught the manga/anime, there are always things hidden, evidence not seen or heard, things going on being the scenes. Just because a guy is in jail does not mean he did the crime he was accused of. People can make mistakes, be framed, be at the right place at the wrong time, take the blame for others, and otherwise seem guilty but really be innocent. On the same note, people can seem innocent when they are really guilty, if they are smart enough to manipulate people or under certain circumstances. Then there is the qustion of where to draw the line. Do you kill: the man who steals bread to feed his family? What about a man who kills another in an accident? What about a woman who kills a man in self defense who is trying to rape her, beat her or molest her? What if your a nice, quiet guy and you kill bullies who have pushed, shoved and called you names ALL your life? What if someone breaks into your house to steal stuff? What if somebody waves around a gun and robs a convinience store? What if someone is depressed, or wants to die because they are sick or old? Also their is the question of context. If a Nazi got hold of a Death Note during the time of Hitler, he would think it 'Justice' to wipe out every single Jewish, Polish, Russian, Christian, etc person on the planet. What if someone had the Death Note when the US dropped the bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki? Or when the US attacked Pearl Harbor? Or during the Cold War when the US was afraid of Communism and everything Communist? What about now, with terrorists everywhere?  <br>  <br>  L was a good guy in many peoples eyes, but one of the key points Near brings up at the very end of the Manga was that L was flawed in that he only took on cases  that interested him. He took on the fight against Light because nobody was able to figure out who Kira was and how he was killing. Granted L did have a sense of Justice and wanted to stop Kira from killing people, but he sacrificed the life of a criminal on TV just to learn more about Kira. And it was more that he had to solve the case and stop Kira because it was a challenge than because he was killing people. L wouldn't take on a case of a mass murderer or copycat murderer if it didn't interest him.|`|3N2ElzcQaa	I'm an L's friend. I'm neither a follower or a leader.|`|4qVWj3UHaa	im aLL about L|`|hzH75VDXaa	I support L.<br>  A murderer is a murderer no matter what the reasoning behind it.<br>  Kira kills people who are in jail for killing people.<br>  Kira is willing to kill people who haven't done anything, only trying to stop him.<br>  He can't even be sure if they are truly guilty.<br>  There are so many cases of people being in jail for years (even death row) who are proven to be innocent with new forensic technology.<br>  <br>  A criminal is a criminal no matter why they do what they do.|`|QkFnEIWSaa	As for the morality of the whole thing, I was a supporter of Kira until he killed that FBI agent and his fiancee. There was no reason to do that. I didn't mind when it was against criminals and people that performed crimes, but right when he started killing the very people that try to bring about justice, he stopped supporting justice in my eyes.|`|1p0qP4yXaa	L all the way<br>  <br>  But not just L, Near and Mello as well. And in the words of the great Near: "You(Kira) are just a murderer" <br>  <br>  No matter for whatever cause he chose to do this for, Light Yagami is a murderer.<br>  <br>  And yes, because he is a murderer, he is a criminal.<br>  <br>  Peace Out|`|dY61VnW2aa	im a kira follower <br>  since the ppl he is killing r all criminals he is just making the world a better place with less crimes n etc...|`|jiSMcjQ8aa	I am a Near supporter.  Actually, I agree with everything that L did, so I think you could say I am for the anti-Kira team.  <br>  <br>  What I understood from Near was that he said "although there are criminals in the world, it is not up to humans to punish them."  I don't think Near or L were as concerned about the morals of the whole thing, it was more important to just catch Kira.<br>  <br>  I could write pages about this.  Pretty much, I don't agree with anyone who thinks they are God and they have the right to kill bad people.  Although he did help the world from some viewpoints, it was an even darker world than it used to be like.<br>  <br>  Good luck on your essay.  I wish we got interesting topics like that.|`|pTERJdzQaa	RYUZAKI L 4 LIFE!!!!<br>  <br>  Eff Light Yagami, He is my least fav. character on Death Note, he was seriously effed up in the head, of course Light is a criminal that needed to be silenced for good, what gave him the right to kill of random people like that, he was just a Genocidal Psycho.<br>  <br>  I wanted Ryuzaki to survive through the entire series, I would have like the ending better if Ryuzaki finished off Light instead of Ryouk, and the detective angency[L should have killed him].<br>  <br>  L IS JUSTICE!!!!!|`|XQMm3Ahraa	I'm an L follower becuase kira's intentions are good it's just that he got power hungry and started killing innocent people for his own selfish reasons and that is why he wound up getting killed by ryuk becuase that is what would happen to a shinigami if they used it for there own reasons|`|3VvphaC2aa	i'm kira followe because i agree with his motives world would be much better without criminals and in anime we can see that crime rate decreases because people are afraid to be killed by kira he also gives second chance to people he considers to be able to become better! about 70% of people are like beasts and beasts should be controlled by fear.....<br>  AND ALSO LIGHT IS VERY HOT!!!!|`|sDIjPUnBaa	Kira|`|LjBVF3c7aa	Kira. He kills to save other people and does what has to be done to continue saving (and killing) people.|`|KO5qrswnaa	L!<br>  I cried so much when L died ;~;|`|RUQpHoYnaa	I'm L follower. at the beginning I wasn't really that against kira he was killing only criminals though its stupid to think to become the new "god" and a murderer is still a murderer no matter what. he killed a whole crew of FBI agents coz they were after him. they were just doing their job, he had no right to kill them. and light knew how much Rem cared for Misa and that if they discovered that she was the 2nd kira they were going to catch her or execute her, and he forced rem to kill L and Watari. And his father died coz of him. coz he wanted to kill mellow and when his sister was captured as hostege by mellow he was going to kill his own sister, he didn't only because everyone would know that he's kira. and when his father was dieing the only thing he was warred about was that mellow was still alive! he killed a lot of Innocent people for nothing, he was no different from those criminals he was killing.

That's reserved for a boyfriend or something.|`|7vBJGMvtaa	have you ever by mistake kiss a friend on the lips intending to kiss him or her on the cheek?|`|ScIMRB6Eaa	no, that would be very awkward, to say the least|`|KXs6Y0APaa	I would never.|`|h2i92yA7aa	just my baby brother, Justice :]|`|03ls3iXmaa	no|`|1d010ac6ed05b2a9b003115da2eb43b2aa	I don't kiss my friends or my family.|`|U5LZDb68aa	on the lips no and would feel really uncomfortable if a family member or a friend for that matter did kiss me on the lips to me that's something you do when your romantically involved with someone a hug or a kiss on the cheek is all I would feel comfortable with from a family member of someone I was just friends with. Some people are comfortable with it like walking around naked I think it's all in how you are raised weather or not you find it okay or not.<br>  <br>  edit: could they have been hitting on you and then sensed you weren't interested so they tried to cover it up by saing it was nothing|`|OXHkcNEbaa	I dont know what do you mean with a peck kiss, but I come from Mexico and there EVERYONE says hello with a kiss in the cheek.. exept boys with boys.. thats just gay. I know its really common in spanish culture for experience. My my husband its american and he thinks its weird...|`|XIy7uSU8aa	My daughter, who's 12, does that to me every morning as she leaves the house to get on the bus. I never really thought about it before.|`|L8sKYNJbaa	i see plenty of parents kissing their young children on the lips. it probably gets less common the older the kids get though.|`|sOC3UY5Xaa	ummm... yeah I guess. I don't really think about it. But when I think about it... yeah.|`|wXQwX67uaa	I did once friend she kinda kissed me tho in a friendly way ^.^'.<br>  Umm but besides that my mommy.|`|kAxVZKqVaa	yea its normal. its just how the US has become in other countries they do it all the time even guy friends|`|u7Vp848Oaa	when I was little I'd kiss my mom, but everyone else was cheek|`|T3k7gjBmaa	Yeah, I come from a smoochy kind of family.  No big deal!  <br>  <br>  No tongues, though, lol!|`|2f2338425d995c6d00e32cb38d57ee7faa	I was born and raised in Russia, and there it's very common to kiss friends/family on the lips. But here in the US, the kisses seem to be always on the cheek. At least, this has been my experience. In fact, if someone tried to kiss me on the lips now (other than my romantic partner, of course), I would consider it downright creepy.<br>  <br>  I've lived in the US for almost 16 years.|`|dd2d386096f95b4c9c13d046234f4dddaa	I've kissed friends and family on the lips.  I wouldn't call this cultural.  I'd call it safe and loving.  Not all of my friends warrant a kiss on the lips (just a peck, as you stated), but I have a couple that are extremely dear to me.  <br>  <br>  Some families don't even hug each other.  You weren't raised this way, so it might seem strange to you.  Your friend was, so to not kiss on the lips seems strange to him.  (Although I think women are more prone to kiss friends and family on the lips than men are.)|`|OjS2wJZWaa	I'm not doing that but I would love to...<br>  I don't think that's wrong...<br>  I've been kissed on the lips when I was a kid...<br>  I think it's just a very sweet way of showing affection...|`|B2Itq6Fcaa	family ewwwwwwww, kiss my mom on the cheek. friends -no homo only daps,  but girls who are friends sometimes|`|k6M48eUMaa	Nope, just the cheek.

yqe0I5zpaa	Robert De Niro is the better actor. He is known for so many roles like Capone in The Untouchables, Conway in Goodfellas, Neil in Heat, Jack in Meet The Parents, Billy in Men Of Honor, Ace in Casino, Jake in Raging Bull, Vito in Godfather 2, Travis in Taxi Driver, and Micheal in The Deer Hunter and Al Pacino is arguably only known for his iconic turns in Scarface and The Godfather.<br>  <br>  De Niro is a legend because of his MANY iconic roles, Pacino is legend because of the cult of Scarface and The Godfather.|`|BJIo6twUaa	De Niro, not a big fan of Pacino but i do like some of his film.|`|zovrJ0yXaa	de niro. both great actors but de niro has just given more great performances, and he has his ace of raging bull, the greatest performance of all time, period. pacino is still a great actor and gave some electrifying performances in his youth but de niro has just been more consistent for longer. pacino has been overacting for quite some time now. to be fair, both sold out a long time ago. either way, no actor ever can match de niros CV.|`|akcGfgdcaa	For me, Pacino's earlier work had a bigger effect on me than De Niro's did.<br>  <br>  Dog Day Afternoon<br>  Serpico<br>  The Godfather I,II<br>  ScarFace<br>  Carlito's Way<br>  <br>  All amazing films. <br>  <br>  It's a shame that neither Pacino or De Niro seem to have that hunger to make great memorable performances anymore, they both just seem to play themselves now.|`|IHWngaDxaa	De Niro, period.|`|JCJVi8Qraa	DeNiro.|`|0J2Tihe7aa	DE NIRO<br>  Pacino is only good for gangster flicks<br>  De Niro can act in any kind of role|`|VQmaus90aa	De Niro
yqe0I5zpaa	The beggining was slow, but it gets really funny towards the end. Paul Rudd is funny throughout the film but Seann William Scott just isn't a good enough comedic actor, he had his fame in American Pie but he just isn't that funny, they should have casted Jason Segel or Jay Baruchel, it would have been funnier. As an overall film it's good, but not great.<br>  <br>  Final Grade -  B-|`|z6qIZRFFaa	haha i thought it was hilarious|`|IHWngaDxaa	It was, but not through the whole movie.<br>  I was kind of disappointed.

ac53eed0ec00a2d980be53069b559e62aa	wrong Wikipedia page there, Waldo.  that's the GAME, not the movie.<br>  <br>  "...the town was abandoned after a terrible fire 30 years ago..."  the setting of Silent Hill was based on a town by the name of Centralia, PA.  Silent Hill was a mining town that burned down due to an uncontrollable underground mine fire.  this is pretty much the same thing that happened to Centralia, but some of it is still standing, though it is unsafe.|`|aCcRsh7uaa	Here's some good info from wikipedia:<br>  <br>  Prior to the 1600s, the town of Silent Hill was the home of members of an unnamed Native American tribe that used the land for sacred rituals. At the end of the century, settlers arrived and founded the town; shortly thereafter, they began to rapidly die off. The deaths were attributed to an epidemic, and Brookhaven Hospital was built to treat those affected. Eventually the settlers fled the town, leaving it abandoned for nearly a century, until it was resettled as a penal colony in the early 1800s. Twenty years later, another epidemic broke out, and Brookhaven Hospital was rebuilt and reopened. In the 1840s, the prison was closed, and the town once more abandoned; in the 1850s, coal was discovered there by another wave of settlers, and it became a boomtown.<br>  <br>  During the American Civil War, the town served as a prisoner of war camp; after the end of the war, the prison used to house prisoners was converted into a state penitentiary, and shortly thereafter, Silent Hill became a resort town. Around roughly the same period, a group of religious zealots founded a series of small doomsday cults based upon the eschatology of the unnamed Native American tribe which occupied the land before settlers arrived. Collectively referring to themselves as "The Order", the cults, each of whom worshiped a different sub-deity, practiced human sacrifice and necromancy in an ongoing effort to resurrect "The God", an ancient deity which they believed would usher in an age of paradise by killing all humans. In order to fund their efforts, The Order dealt a psychedelic drug called White Claudia, manufactured from a plant indigenous to the town. The drug trade served to increase tourism to the town from the residents of surrounding areas, who traveled there to obtain White Claudia. The drug trade was eventually crippled, in the midst of a war between The Order and local authorities, during which members of the order murdered several police officers.<br>  <br>  Silent Hill manifests itself in at least three distinct parallel layers, or dimensions: a normal, populated town; a quiet, seemingly abandoned town veiled by supernaturally thick fog; and a dark and decaying town (called the "Otherworld") filled with disturbing, hellish imagery. Only the latter two layers are explored by the games' protagonists, where demonic and disfigured creatures roam the streets and buildings (appearing in greater numbers in the Otherworld). Electricity and lighting are extremely limited or nonexistent as well. Occasionally, characters will transition between dimensions, and in some cases the dimensions may intersect with each other, creating an incoherent space called "Nowhere."<br>  <br>  The different appearances of both the town and its inhabitants are made manifest from characters' personal fears, though not necessarily those of the protagonists. These manifestations may be shared between characters, or otherwise appear exclusively to only one of them. It is implied that Silent Hill always held a supernatural presence, but the town's violent and deadly history since the early modern period had perverted these energies into something darker.[6]|`|2088750e2e24db94af84bd0688460755aa	Jenova's right.<br>  <br>  However, Rose (the mom) and "Sharon" (the girl) aren't in purgatory.

The other guy whips out his cell phone and calls the emergency services. He gasps to the operator: "My friend is dead! What can I do?" The operator, in a calm soothing voice says: "Just take it easy. I can help. First, let's make sure he's dead." There is a silence, then a shot is heard. The guy's voice comes back on the line.

I don't know who he banks with but if I report my card stolen they will give me a new one for free. Perhaps you are right and he is a cheapskate, in that case break up with him and find a man who is more giving. However the way you react to the situation I kind of feel bad for the guy and hope he finds himself a woman with a little more maturity and respect. Perhaps take his card and buy stuff so not only will he report it stolen but then you can go to jail for theft.|`|sn7bbROnaa	give it back<br>  its against the law.<br>  ithink...?<br>  yeah im pretty sure it is.<br>  *xo* Lindsey<3<br>  I'm back, bitchez!|`|cjLxrrTBaa	I suggest you buy football pads and a helmet, cause he's gonna kick you @ss six ways to Sunday when he finds out the truth...|`|N3ioHJwDaa	I don't see this relationship lasting very long.

In any forward tumbling your landing is blind and it is harder to get momentum so as not to land short and fall on your back.  There is also more risk of losing control if you over rotate and plunging head first into the springs of the trampoline doesn't sound like much fun.  No one without a decent amount of training should do a front flip of any variety on a trampoline.<br>  <br>  It's funny to me how so many people seem to think you can see where you are landing doing a front flip.  You can't.  Think about it:  You are looking at the sky and in front of you the whole time.  If you try to spot the ground, you won't complete the flip or you'll fall forward on your head.  In a back flip, your head is naturally in a position to spot the ground as you are completing the rotation.|`|P284Snoyaa	back flip|`|zn3NC3ezaa	Me and trampolines don't get along too well.

3dcc2948a003c40d98c8ef0d9a516e9baa	I agree it has it faults, and I don't think it's a masterpiece.  But I do enjoy it.  The idea that in post apocalyptic world, the people who facilitated communication between the communities would lead the rebirth of civilization is an interesting idea.  You can't help but love the group of kids who band together to deliver the mail and fight off the dictator.<br>  <br>  As far as Mad Max, I don't get the comparison at all.  Yeah they're both about a post-apocalyptic world, but that's the ONLY thing they have in common.  Mad Max is much darker and more violent.  It's rawer and shows a pessimistic view of life and the men who would rise to the top.  In comparison, the Postman is cotton candy. It has an optimistic view of people and what's possible.  It's putting forth a different idea.|`|6IGph0K9aa	i really liked it....after waterworld people were calling it dirtworld jokingly.. i thought it was a really great movie. It is not riding on mad max..in times of distress in any nation you have those who attempt a dictatorship...some suceed, some dont...and then you have those who lead a group--who leads another group ----and so on, for the greater good... he was simply trying to help out communication and with communication it becomes order.  In dire need sometimes people need to know that they are not alone...and it is human nature to strive to do better when they hear it is possible from others..

It may sound scary but its only hair - it'll grow back before you know it.<br>  Its simple and it'll change how you look, you'll find you wear different clothes, and jewellery without really realising it.<br>  <br>  Its fun, i did it, my hair was always long, i felt like a change so i went to the hairdressers and said cut it above my shoulders, it looked great, i got loads of compliments (a few of my friends copied me) and it achieved what i wanted - something different.

She was a little bit sad but she didn't cry. I could sense that she was kind of disappointed because that was one of her favorite shows and she didn't want it to end. But now, she enjoys the sweet life on deck.  My daughter was too young to watch rugrats but i think she might have watched all grown up when the rugrats were older but im not sure if she liked it or not.

UAHjJpC0aa	Your problem is probably signal loss....<br>  <br>  you can't run a high impedance signal, more than about 20 feet, without out "loosing signal", especially highs.<br>  that's why 1/4" cables are limited to 20'.<br>  (you may find the occasional 25 or 30" cable, which "might work" at those (30') lengths, if the preamp signal is hot enough)<br>  <br>  If the aux out is TS, it is high imp,<br>  if it's TRS, it "might" be low imp.<br>  the owners manual might/should tell you.<br>  <br>  You WILL need a true balance "Lo impedance signal", to run those cable lengths, <br>  and it had better be a pretty hot signal to go over 100 feet.!<br>  <br>  I haven't done this for  couple years, but Shure used to have a Transformer, that could handle "preamp levels" (not all can do it cleanly,)<br>  <br>  the best bet, is if the mixer has an XLR balanced Lo Impedance output.<br>  you would just buy the correct cable length, for a standard XLR cable, you can get these made up in any length.<br>  <br>  individuals....<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.sweetwater.com/c810--Balanced_Cables__XLR_to_XLR" rel="nofollow">http://www.sweetwater.com/c810--Balanced...</a><br>  <br>  snakes ....<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.sweetwater.com/c986--Pro_Co--Stage_Snakes" rel="nofollow">http://www.sweetwater.com/c986--Pro_Co--...</a><br>  <br>  Next best, would be to get a transformer for the output of the mixer, that has an XLR output.<br>  then you could plug the loooong cable from the transformer to the power amps.<br>  <br>  this is a LOT hard to explain in an email/post, since I don't know just how much you understand hi/lo impedance?<br>  <br>  Check around local business that specialize in "installs"<br>  <br>  the equipment keeps changing<br>  <br>  you do NOT want to by cheapo transformers, direct boxes, cables etc.<br>  You whole PA will not sound any better that the cheapest part.|`|DnWsMhwLaa	they deffinately make them. but they are specialty, i would guess you are looking at like 400 bucks for a 200 foot 5 (i'm assuming youll have to get one that does 8) 1/4th cable....

I hate how these days, these stupid popular artists sing these crappy songs, usually just be talking like a retard with fairly interesting BGM behind them, and they call it music.

Jn09dNMvaa	Starting on acoustic guitar should give you better technique. Personally i really don't think its a necessity. although one big advantage is that you focus more on what you are playing vs messing around with amps, guitar effects, etc.<br>  <br>  the cool thing about musical instruments is that so many people throw in the towel so early. Meaning there are a lot of unwanted guitars out there waiting to get played. I got my first guitar for free from my uncle. I bet there is someone you know that also has a guitar just collecting dust. see if they would let you borrow it until you decide to if you are going to commit to the instrument. they just might let you keep it?<br>  <br>  Avoid pawn shops. unless you really know what you are looking at, there is a high likely-hood that you will over pay or get a bad instrument. <br>  <br>  musiciansfriend.com is a great resource simply because they have such a massive collection. decent prices, but only the major brands.<br>  <br>  and most importantly what are some of your favorite artists? I would imagine you would want a similar sound to theirs. so if your going the electric route you cannot go wrong with a les paul or a strat. tonewood matters alder is preferable in a strat, and mahogany for a lespaul. often times budget guitars substitutes for other varieties such as basswood. It does not mean its necessarily a worse guitar, but it will definitely contribute as to why it sounds different than more expensive rivals. <br>  <br>  A good reputable company to check out is rondomusic.com<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.rondomusic.com/st802rn3ts.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.rondomusic.com/st802rn3ts.htm...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.rondomusic.com/al2000whitegoldhw.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.rondomusic.com/al2000whitegol...</a><br>  <br>  the first one is a strat. and the second is a very well price les paul alternative. Their agile line is very nice and will suit a beginner to intermediate player very well. I have ordered from them and they are great. The les pauls are much nicer than similarly priced epiphone models. stay away from their sx line, mostly for people who enjoy modding their guitars and know how to set them up. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://guitars.musiciansfriend.com/product/Squier-Deluxe-Strat-Electric-Guitar?sku=517231" rel="nofollow">http://guitars.musiciansfriend.com/produ...</a><br>  <br>  here is a comparable guitar made by squier. it does have the basswood body, but the finish on these guitars really is quite good. and you can pick it up at your local guitar center. <br>  <br>  a well made electric guitar will be plenty resonant for practicing. amps will not be needed. <br>  <br>  I hope you have fun getting your first guitar. get an instrument within your budget and wail away.|`|e0WfWpwTaa	Yeah, you should definitely start learning on an acoustic guitar. It is what I did, and really made a huge impact on my playing. Musician's Friend is a quality place to buy instruments, but EBay is also pretty solid if you're looking for a good learning guitar at a super low price. Here is one that I found for you if you want to check it out: <br>  <br>  <a href="http://rover.ebay.com/rover/1/711-53200-19255-0/1?type=2&campid=5336202548&toolid=10001&customid=&ext=320344261669&item=320344261669" rel="nofollow">http://rover.ebay.com/rover/1/711-53200-...</a>|`|V4ZSGQBoaa	Yeah you should definately start with an acoustic.  This will really build your finger/hand strength up and your callus on your fingertips.  I actually bought a steel string acoustic and a mandolin package from musiciansfriend.com for like $90 made by Rouge.  I have far too many guitars now and I have been playing for like 8 years.  I was completely clueless when I fist started.  But musicians friend is definitely the best way to go.  Most of the time they even have free shipping.  I got that a few years ago so it is likely not the same deal anymore.  But I always wait until there are really good deals like the spring deals, and Christmas.  So look for a really good deal on an acoustic, and read the customer reviews on the right side of the page when you click on the product to look at it or buy it.|`|DNxZuoOGaa	Get an acoustic first. The are cheap, and practical. Spend between $150-$250 on a starter guitar, something like an Epiphone or Washburn. If you decide that you like guitar, get an electric.|`|LDGk6Irsaa	epiphone les paul or SG

e12a1f2ed505be8021ede0df33b7238faa	Looking forward to 'Terminator: Salvation', Christian Bale should make a good John Conner.  I'm also looking forward to the rom-com 'The Ugly Truth' even though I know it will be very similar to every other rom-com chick flick.  I'm just a sap for them.<br>  <br>  Ok, and don't thumbs down me, but I'm actually looking forward to 'New Moon' even though I'm fearing the acting of Kristan Stewart isn't going to be any better.  Someone should teach her how to evoke emotion.

vsy4QMHMaa	Straight-up transposing a Major key will always transpose to a Major<br>  ... and a minor to a minor. <br>  <br>  The difference between Major and minor is the tonal center of the music.|`|CrAwmz65aa	A quick and dirty way to find out what key a piece is in is to look at the last chord.<br>  The last chord is usually in the key of the piece.<br>  <br>  If you transposed a piece, you didn't change the mode, just the tonal center.<br>  So the piece should still be in a major key.<br>  <br>  I am glad you have been practicing transposing.<br>  It's a good musical exercise.<br>  <br>  As for the title of the piece, that is a dilemma.<br>  Brahms wrote the same waltz twice exactly the same, except that one version is in G major and the other one is in A-flat major.<br>  The version in A-flat major is known as the "Brahms Waltz in A-flat."<br>  The other version is known simply as "Waltz."<br>  I guess nobody wants to give Brahms credit for writing two waltzes when he really wrote only one.|`|qswrz268aa	The difference between A-flat Major and f minor is that f minor is the relative key, meaning they have the same key signatures, but are two different keys, one if for pieces in 4 flats that are major and the other is for pieces in 4 flats that are minor. <br>  <br>  So if the song is in Major, as you said it was, then it would be in A-flat Major, not F minor.<br>  <br>  You can call it either, the key of a-flat or the key of a-flat major. <br>  <br>  Traditionally, (it doesn't matter too terribly much though) when referring to a major key, major is left out so it'd just be A flat... When referring to a minor key, you add minor to the phrase, so if it was in F minor, it would be called F minor. <br>  <br>  When you hear a piece described in, say the key of A, then you assume its major, but when its described in A minor, obviously its minor. <br>  <br>  Hope this helped!!

956d43fbc612852be9834658deb4139faa	Writer and co-creator Scott Peters announced on December 18, 2007 that due to the ongoing Writers Guild of America strike, budgetary problems, and lower-than-anticipated ratings, The 4400 had been cancelled and would not be returning for a fifth season, despite the fourth season's cliff-hanger.  Fans of the show mounted an unsuccessful campaign to resurrect the series, sending petitions and sunflower seeds to SciFi and USA Network president Bonnie Hammer.  In April 2008, the campaign shifted to target Jeff Zucker, president and chief executive officer of the NBC/Universal TV group, again with little success.|`|fEBOzWeXaa	it was canceled in 2007|`|5Pgs61ePaa	The series ran for four seasons from 2004 until its cancellation in 2007.[3]|`|HFMx5LmGaa	I don't think they plan on making anymore seasons of the show.

In desperation, the British Government evacuates as many survivors as it can out of the infected area, and then builds a wall, preventing the remainder from escaping. Thirty years later, with the wall still up and the victims all but forgotten, the virus breaks out again. The Government decides to send a crack team of operatives, led by Major Eden Sinclair, into the hot zone to investigate the possibility of a cure. <br>  <br>  Here eye was so cool, it was like a video camera like thing and she used it to look around corners and things:D   Really good movie.|`|8b140fWJaa	sara chronicles

ZzqWzFNiaa	Moreso, I've come to find in the past that with groups like the Rolling Stones and the Doors, and some others, I don't really need more. I like some stuff, and I've heard some stuff that wasn't the hits, and really all I need from them are some tunes so I'll be pleasantly surprised with a tune here and there on shuffle. So, I've explored them further, but I just don't feel like I need to hear, much less own, a ton of material and the hits work for me. Mostly. often a good hits collection can spare me from having to buy several records that underwhelm me on the whole just so I can get my hands on a few key tracks. It actually kind of bothers me, people with this fascist attitude about a right and wrong way to enjoy music, or purchase it. Honestly, I probably wouldn't own any of the Stones without the existence of a greatest hits record because I'd rather buy other stuff (actually, I did buy Let It Bleed and thought it was pretty ok, but it was because someone gave me a gift card but encouraged me to buy it. it was fine, but meh). Same with the Doors. I know how I feel about them. I don't need any records. I like having some tracks, but I'd honestly rather grab something else.<br>  <br>  Some good ones...<br>  Paul Simon - Negotiations and Love Songs<br>  The Beatles - (the blue 2 disk one, the later years one)<br>  Changes Bowie|`|kP0JGI1waa	Megadeth, I have their greatest hits album that I bought a long time ago and have listened to it alot, but nothing really past that.

6QDaqIXbaa	Technically they are considered meat, however they are eaten on Ash Wednesday as a tribute to our Lord and Savior who fed the towns people with fish even though he knew his own death was imminent.|`|Q5eckzbraa	Fish is meat when it's killed for food. Fish are animals. Fish do bleed red.<br>  <br>  Not all fish meat is white. There are trout with pink meat/muscle. Salmon meat/muscle can range from white, pink, orange, and yes, even red (depending on the species). <br>  <br>  There are other fishes that have brown, beige, yellow, or gray meat/muscle (they all bleed). If someone eats fish, they are eating animal meat.|`|AJB1QcHzaa	That whole "Don`t eat meat on Fridays and Holy Days" BS was just made-up by the Catholics so Catholic fishermen & mongers would get a piece of the pie.....(good point, though...why wouldn`t fish be considered "meat"...?)|`|568ac9941468bad6571c214f5eba0fa7aa	i have no idea why fish aren't considered meat. They are animals and we do eat their flesh...???|`|tcSimSSaaa	aaarrrggghhh<br>  <br>  too    <br>  <br>  many<br>  <br>  euphemisms...|`|a118b8144112704be52f2ab81596333baa	It's not considered meat because people need to eat something during Lent.  I think it should be considered meat, but I'm not that religious anyway and eat what I want when I want.  Let the overly religious types define their rules themselves.|`|AA11967247	theyre cold blooded and nothing like carnage.

AA12301664	hey huevo<br>  <br>  not bad at all.<br>  my favourite - kick the tragedy. immediately listenable.<br>  <br>  ba: catherine wheel|`|wLxmn2xtaa	Awesome selection, Huevo; definitely a huge 'aye' from me. "Kick the Tragedy" was my favorite by far. I'm on my 3rd listen right now and I think I, too, could get lost floating in it for days. There's something the about rhythmic, repetitive distortions I can't get enough of. I also really liked the vocals on all the songs, especially on"Angel." Lovely, lovely band. I bookmarked them for sure. Thanks again, Huevo!<br>  <br>  BA: Slowdive (I've gotten lost in them for months, lol).|`|Hck22n9Faa	I really liked it. I thought "Kick The Tragedy" was awesome. I was caught into it right away and just blew right through. The others were interesting as well. I think they could be a band that I could get into. With most shoegazing bands, I have to concentrate on the music and make an effort the first couple times listening to get a gist of the song, but it wasn't so with them. Thanks, Huevo. <br>  <br>  BQ: I'm not where I want to be with this genre, listening wise. But, right now I'd say A Place to Bury Strangers are my favorite.|`|dFacbjIZaa	I had never heard them before which isn't a surprise as I am woefully unfamiliar (sadly) with the whole genre. However I did like the sound of all three songs with "Kick The Tragedy" being My fave.<br>  <br>  I also posted a comment to all three.<br>  <br>  *Edit*<br>  Hey Huevo, so many Genres, so little time, and thanks Dude.

UHIi8AuQaa	negative....i live in ireland............a school is a school & i dont attend & a block is just known as down the road somewhere|`|7h0qfos1aa	Um, it would probably depend on your situation. If you have a daughter or son attending high school or grammar school, it would be a positive. If you don't, I would think it's a negative because a lot of kids smoke and meet there at night to drink, litter, spit, climb fences in back yards, etc.|`|AA10648436	I would say for the homeowners negative.  More traffic, more obnoxious kids by your house, plus schools are not the nicest looking things.  I would not want to buy a home a block from the school.  Plus with high school you would have to listen to all the games and the lighting is really bright.  Then for kids that go there they have to look at the school all the time when they are not there|`|UYCvwh6Paa	It would depend on wether or not people in your household go to that school. It would be a short, cheap commute for them anyway, and the neighborhood would have a slower speed limit during the day. So those are positives.<br>  <br>  Property taxes would be higher, there would be more noise and possibly more vandalism(depending on the kids in the area) So there is a negative side too.|`|M2VneBW3aa	highsschool: negative ..i dont want any highschoolers within 50 miles of my house.<br>  <br>  grammar school: yes, it would be great for my kids<br>  <br>  but when my kids are in highschool, i feel they are responsible enough to drive themselves there, so that wouldnt be an issue when they get older.|`|s4FEJiNHaa	r u a drug dealer?  If so, negative.  Does ur commute take u thru the school zone?  Negative.  Do children annoy u?  Negative.  I actually don't see any positive benefits here unless u attend or work at the school.|`|2rGTBWw7aa	positive, closer commute, easier access to getting work if your absent & such|`|Gk4kNAWsaa	LET'S SEE....<br>  <br>  if you're a drug dealer, it is negative!<br>  <br>  if you are a home owner, it is positive.|`|So00Bd5zaa	Positive. Closer to home. Sleep late. Home early.|`|Yi4ja5Lkaa	positive... exercise is good|`|x5dXU8vWaa	negative<br>  less time to listen to music on my mp3!|`|LxZFioqwaa	Um its good because it takes you a minute to get there.|`|NGYcQnboaa	postive...it doesnt take long to get there....you get to sleep in later|`|mR9ydwz5aa	well.... i go to a highschool about 3 blocks away from my house. and its a good thing. does that answer your question?|`|J8qvkWsNaa	depends on whether you're planning to molest the children.  if that's the case, it's baaaaaaaad and you should go straight to hell lwithout collecting 200 dollars.  if not, i dn't see why it would be a problem.|`|dKLEBO5Saa	If your children attend the school it is a positive.  If not, you have to decide for yourself.|`|VPDR0tazaa	positive|`|jvJG6uDvaa	i would think it'd be positive|`|eW5D8rKPaa	BOFFFFFF.<br>  <br>  -<br>  gangstuh kids be everywhere.<br>  <br>  +<br>  but the schools close to yuhhh.|`|h8Mqno3daa	depends if you hate school then it's bad.

The cashier asks, "Oh, these must be for your mom, huh?" <br>  <br>  "Nope," says the boy, "not for my mom." <br>  <br>  The cashier responds, "Well, then they must be for your sister then?" <br>  <br>  "Nope," says the boy, "not for my sister, neither." <br>  <br>  The cashier is now curious, "Oh. Not for your mom and not for your sister -- then who are they for?" <br>  <br>  The nine-year-old says, "They're for my little brother. They say on TV, if you wear one of these, you can swim and ride a bike, and my little brother can't do either of those things."|`|S2uAq7i4aa	Do you know that you're actually supposed to give us the ANSWER with the question so that we laugh?

d3zT4NFaaa	OK... You want me to be as descriptive as I can? Well...You asked for it!<br>  <br>  Firstly... I don't actually have a definition of what "love" is, but I found a good recipe for love... And it is as sweet as your pastries!<br>  <br>  Please share this recipe with others!<br>  <br>  <br>  "How To Fall in Love"<br>  <br>  It is true we live in hectic, trying, scary, stressful times. It is not surprising that it is ok or common to speak of violence and the economy and a host of fearsome things CNN will draw your attention to: things that try your compassion and make you wonder at humanity and lack thereof. People will talk comfortably of sexual issues as they do of violence and tragic events but to mention things like love and romance? They scoff; they snicker. They twitch in discomfort. At best, it is seen as silly fiction. At worst, a lightweight new age soul search and yet..... At any rate, here is my own user's guide to love in the millennium.<br>  <br>  To fall in love, you must put away everything you have learned up to now. You must put away pride, wisdom, street smarts, and sophistication. You may keep dignity, patience, instinct and an open spirit. Relax your body, unclench your hands and open your palms. Look up to the stars and let snowflakes fall on your face without intercepting them.<br>  <br>  Wait.<br>  <br>  First, you must find someone or let them find you. In fact, it is better if they find you and you find them but this is only possible if you both walk backwards and into each other. But you must start unaware and without expectations. If you are waiting and ready, you will not fall in love. You might find romance but you will not fall in love.<br>  <br>  The next thing you must do is to think of yourself as a house with all the doors and windows open. The other person will appear as sunshine that sneaks its way in and sends unexpected warmth upon you. You will bask in this delight. But then, it will change. That sunshine will become alternately rain and wind and cool breezes, and topsy-turvy gusts that upset your furniture and send your pictures on the walls all askew. You will want so very much to close the windows and slam the doors and slap your hands together in that brisk motion that says, 'enough of this nonsense'. You might feel fearful and cover up the fear with the most wicked of all tonics: rationalization.<br>  <br>  You might be so good at this that the rationalizations of things that are really a blessing and a gift, will seem as the truth. In fact, the opposite is so. The rationalizations are the lies - the truth will seem, well, unseemly. But no matter - if you go this route and forget this counsel, there is little to be done.<br>  <br>  You will protest the weather and shut it out and forget that in minutes, days, hours - that same annoying wind of fearsome gusts can turn back into that sunshine that first warmed and beguiled you. But I urge you to become a student of the weather and simply watch it unfold. Welcome the rain and wind, knowing it will not harm you and besides, will soon pass. If you can manage to keep the door open, the rain will dry up and the winds will settle. You can look out again and see those rays which first caught you. You might marvel how it all changes while you have sat still.<br>  <br>  If you can sit still.<br>  <br>  Then there comes a hard part. You will relax and get used to the changing weather. You will learn to take to the wind and rain and not notice as much. Instead, happily, you will focus on that sun. That sun will become glorious. It will become larger than your own open house. And just when you get to that point and are reveling in this light, a big cloud will come. This cloud might stay and obliterate that sun which you have grown to love so well. It will stay so long until you know this is not a change in the weather. It is indeed, the new landscape and a painful reality of the heart.<br>  <br>  At first, you will hope the sun will return but as the days turn into borderless chunks of time, you will know that is unlikely.<br>  <br>  Now this is odd - because clearly, this is not simply weather changes but a permanent state of affairs but still, you will have that same urge to shut the windows and close the door. Now, there is no rain, snow, or wind to make you do that but still - you will want to take a hammer and nails and hammer down shut every crevice that sun or any light might creep through.<br>  <br>  You might even close the shutters around your heart. I urge you not to.<br>  <br>  If you are telling the truth about wanting to fall in love, this is how it is done:<br>  <br>  Take the glow from your own heart and your own truth. Set it in each window sill. Make candles of your faith. Take the glitter from that plant called hope and the twinkle from the dreams you cannot give up. Adorn your home with these things. In time, you will not miss that sunshine you grew to love. The light will go from inside, from your own heart, to the outside. You will not need those flippant rays you first experienced and learned to rely on. That warmth that starts from within and stays.<br>  <br>  One day, you might even look out again - because after all, you are still, in your heart of hearts, a student of weather. You might see another home - similarly lit. That might be an indication of another full, strong, open house - the only possible match for your own abode. It might be a place worth visiting. It might be a place to go to.<br>  <br>  They say falling in love is wonderful. It is. But at first it will be scary and it might not always work out. You might only taste romance which, as lovely as it is, is simply love's residue. To fall in love you have to be smart but naive. Hope against hope. Hold your heart high, proud, but unfettered. Celebrate its scars. Cry until you do not know what to do anymore. Sleep. Dream. Wait and be ready. There is always more weather. There is more sun. Put the hammer and nails away. Turn your palms open and upwards.<br>  <br>  And that is how you fall in love!|`|PIeronuZaa	The WORD love inspires new meanings other than generics<br>  <br>  Love:#1 soul mates bound and shackled in restraints to one another during fires of passion, lust, sex, desire<br>  <br>  Love:#2 soul mates whom dance to their own tunes together as one soul incarnate<br>  <br>  Love:#3 soul mates that journey to the center of they minds as one<br>  <br>  Love:#4 soul mates that share confusion, chaos and disorder<br>  <br>  Love:#5 soul mates that if or when they have reached the end of their rainbow find that they are no longer compatlbe ( *not soul mates no more lol ) introduce themselves to others as, "meet my future ex"<br>  <br>  Love:#6 soul mates that kiss and make up via new categories of loveplay (* kama sutra comes in handy at this point lol )<br>  <br>  Love:#7 and last but not least (* lost me train of thought..happens lol ) soul mates that after deciding they never want to grow old together, hold hands and jump off a cliff together (* Ireland ) singing this song..well at least a portion of the song<br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4SZhumbv0s" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4SZhumbv...</a>|`|UjPArJZ6aa	The love a parent has for a child.

3d40b4f2a24630bfafce9bb96d212203aa	I LOVE Jason and Sam together!!! They are perfect complements of each other! I just get bored with Liz, I don't find her interesting or entertaining, her character is dull and just so boring. (I think if Jason was still a Quatermine and didn't have the accident then he and Liz would stand a chance) but Sam brings out the best in Jason she doesn't sit at home and wait until he is okay, she goes out there with him and watch his back, she is his "ride or die chick" The chemistry flows easy for them and they are exciting to watch because they are like Bonnie and Clyde. They are the best because they accept each other without explanations. I' am so sick and tired of people keep saying that Sam has done to much and can't be forgiven, who in GH hasn't done anything terrible and down right evil to get there way and everybody look the other way, I think Sam should be forgiven for her mistakes and move on, nobody is perfect and Jason is no angel either.|`|M1ymLE9Paa	I love Jason and Sam together (even though they are not really together, LOL).  I always thought they made a great team and were fun and funny together and I prefer Jasam over Liason.<br>  <br>  That said, fair is fair, and speaking objectively, Liason has a huge following.  They were actually paired together before Sam ever came on the show so there are a lot of people who have been rooting for them since the 90's.  And since there are a lot of Jasam fans as well, there's (obviously) a huge rivalry between the 2 fan bases.  So anytime Jasam looks like they might be getting together, Liason fans rally together to show support for their couple.  And visa versa. <br>  <br>  I've learned the hard way to just be happy when a couple you like is on together and not to worry about other fanbases and what not.  B/c in soapland, nothing lasts forever.  So all you can do is enjoy what you've got, while you have it.  I'm just happy that Jasam is getting so much more screen time.  I've really been enjoying it.|`|CFZ4ISNNaa	I think anitnut said it best.  I'm one of Liason fans that has been rooting for them since the 90's.  I wasn't a big Sam fan until recently, so that's why I haven't jumped on the Jasam bandwagon.  I actually enjoyed LuSam until the writers totally botched that up.  I enjoy watching Jason and Sam in action, but just refuse to see any chemistry that they might have. <br>  <br>   I'm not sure how SID gets it's ratings...but I usually feel like I'm in the minority when it comes to being a Liason fan.|`|33462b45e7f5e8fa0d2c9a98b11323c9aa	YES.... I do LOVE watching Jason and Sam together....  I am a long=term GH viewer, and I wasn't enthused with alot of the newer characters, but these two really capture my attention.  They belong together .....  I don't know if it will ever happen again, but I am hoping to see them regain their passion!!|`|o5jSID4Jaa	I like them together too. I liked Jason and Liz too but I would rather see him with Sam. She's better for him, they have much more in common. They work so well togetherI haven't been liking Sam's stories lately, she's much better with Jason.|`|EhBF31evaa	I love Jason and Liz.  I would love for there to be a way for them to be together.  Sam and Jason work well together in tight situations but I don't like them as a couple.|`|SL22F2KAaa	I am a Liason fan.<br>  <br>  The current Jasam scenes remind me of when they went on vacation together.  They were cute then.  Too much has happened now for them to go back together, but they are fun working together!|`|DfbR2Traaa	yes!  i love them together again  hope they hook up again!|`|28WPZ06Jaa	I love Jason and Sam together. I really didn't like Elizabeth and Jason together. It was annoying. Sam and Jason just seem to go together. I'm hoping they will get back together soon! :)|`|5XV8A2Xbaa	I know I think Elizabeth is a complete bored, at least with Sam , Jason had someone that didn't want him to change. Elizabeth just want a better looking Lucky,U are not alone girlie|`|4fjbW07Kaa	Love Jason and Sam<br>  best couple on GH!|`|NGNeT3rYaa	Because people LOVE Jason and Elizabeth. Sam and Jason work good together as a team but come on, a woman who loves a man, no matter how badly betrayed she felt, if she still loved him at the time, like she claimed..she would not have done what she did to his son!|`|AA12315431	I used to love Jason and sam together and I never thought in a million years that the writer's would split them up. I thought they were going to be the next long term supercouple. After what went down, I started liking Liason again like I did in the 90's. Now that Sam has sort of made up for what she did, I think Jason will be able to forgive her one day and perhaps they will get back together but who knows. They are a good couple. Jason doesn't think he should have kids in his life because of the danger and Sam can't have kids. They work well together, they watch each other's backs, etc.. They are a good match. So basically what I am saying is that I wouldn't mind if they got back together even though I did like Jason with Liz. What Jason and Liz had was really sweet and they have a child together but obviously they can't make it work so why make everyone suffer by hoping it will happen when we all know it's not?|`|ADBMrG87aa	I love Jason & Sam.  Don't believe everything you read in a soaps magazine; we don't believe for a second that Elizabeth and Jason are #1 for 4 weeks; its gotta be rigged.  I think Jason & Sam has been and are still so cute together and are the best couple even though they're not together as couple anymore; but we can still hope that they will become a couple again in the future.<br>  <br>  (\__/)<br>  (='.'=)<br>  (")-(")<br>  Sweetie|`|EQP8VZwiaa	There for a while I hated Sam. She just simply got on my nerves. I'm not sure if I want her back with Jason but she seems like she's a better person when they're together.|`|7XM4QJiuaa	I have to admit I am liking together again.|`|SqNPj54Kaa	I Love Jason & Sam together.

Some of the stuff you here like this could be a publicity stunt and may or may not be true.  But, I don't think Rob is in love with Kristen.  <br>  <br>  A good friend of mine is a makeup artist in Hollywood.  She's met Rob on occasion and he's even texted her and called her a couple of times.  She says he doesn't have a girlfriend.  She didn't tell me why other than going back and forth between England and California and other sets around the world would be difficult for any relationship.  That's what she even said when I asked her why doesn't she date him.  <br>  <br>  Take it for what its worth.  She's says he's a sweetheart though.|`|9a7ce9bcff550c5b27451cc6201f2885aa	No 1.) He was referring to his role in twilight when he said that cos obviously he's NOT a vampire, and his co-presenter (the one in mamma mia) also said that she has 3 fathers which i doubt she meant in real life.<br>  <br>  No 2.) I'm not Rob so I wouldn't know exactly but I think he does fancy her a bit, cos he has dropped hints in many interviews (which I really don't understand cos she looks half dead most of the time and seems like a complete depressed *****... but that's just my opinion) but she doesn't seem interested in him at all (???). But who knows what will happen in the future... I'll be interested to see who Rob does hook up with xD|`|OaXsSAPdaa	OMG stfu.<br>  <br>  The statement "I needed to become a vampire to find love." would mean he does NOT love Kristen in real life.<br>  But that aside, just stfu and realize they are PAID ACTORS.<br>  <br>  Holy ****.|`|If2ww2i9aa	Yes.

Whether it's a painting or sculpture you should feel winded upon seeing it. You just have to trace every line with your eyes, you have to marvel at how precise a hand is drawn/painted etc. It moves you to tears at times. It's the light in a dark world.

Feeling depicted through music, drawings, paintings, etc.|`|cH3l3myKaa	Art is being able to portray an opinion, emotion etc. on a blank canvas & to be able to show/express to other people.

UC9Wjjscaa	Well when I was about 10 me and my mom were at the grocery store.  We had just got in line at checkout and my mom told me to go grab a soda off a display right there at the front of store.  (you know those where they have them stacked like pyramids) Anyway I ran over there and grabbed one from the middle.  I ran back over to where my mom was. Next thing I know I see the whole display rocking and then it falls down with a huge crash and one of the bottles hits this little old lady on the head.   Everyone is running over there and hollering to see if she is ok.  I am standing with my mom praying nobody remembers that I was just over there.  So then my mom looks at me and says did you get that coke from middle.  Now everyone at our register area is staring at me. I was so ready to die.  I looked and told mom noway I know better than to do that, that would be stupid.  I was so glad to get out of that store.|`|RWEyZZXWaa	Well there was a time I was having sex with my fiancee in my car....we were in a parking lot at the Capitol Center.

While she's trying to wrap me around her like a towel, I roll down the window.<br>  The cop tells us to get dressed and gives us a little privacy.  After I am clothed I ask him how did pick my car to check out.<br>  "Hell, me and Jimmy could see the roof rocking 100 yards away!"  Followed by a fatherly talk on the potential dangers of having sex with your girlfriend in a parking lot.<br>  It wasn't the cops so much, it was the horse just looking into the window, calmly chewing on it's bit,  I could almost here him thinking,"Well I never would have seen this if I was pulling the Budweiser wagon."|`|wXh4QpaYaa	Ugh...Being a girl, I have plenty of period related horror stories.<br>  <br>  The worst one is the first time I got it, I was at school, and I leaked all over my pants.

I ran into thte room and started asking my teacher questions, we have an inside joke about the library so I was like "hey can i go to the library??" and everybody looked at me, I got sooooo scared. i almost started to cry so i tried to run out of the room, but slipped on a piece of paper, fell against a table that pushed me backwards landed on top of emily and rolled off of her onto the ground. everybody was laughing sooo hard.<br>  <br>  <br>  Not that funny, sorry <br>  ):|`|xSOAwIXsaa	Well today was a student council meeting, so this one guy from an organisation came in, and his son and wife came too.

Well, the bad part is the teacher said "Hi Mr Miller... I see you brought your daughter"

zjeKZAicaa	I've watched 130 Episodes of One Piece in 4Kids dub and enjoyed it, but thats as far as it goes... They stopped Dubbing in 4Kids version so im watching the subbed version and i would say the Subbed version is better but. There is no problem with the dubbed version's Voice Actors, The pirate rap doesnt ruin it but there are alot of better Openings in the subbed version in my oppinion|`|lCDo5CSAaa	i love the 4kids version of ONE PIECE! i don't see why others don't!|`|gJhwH335aa	I'm sorry if I go off topics on this question but I think people don't necessarily hate / dislike the dub version of One Piece by 4Kids. What they really hate is, the way 4Kids Americanized One Piece the changing and heavily editing a lot of stuff 4Kids done to their version of One Piece from the original form. Most of it are really unnecessary to begin with.<br>  <br>  - There's no blood on that series (ie; Nami stabbed herself with a blade but 4Kids edited it)<br>  - No smoking (Sanji sucking a lollipop?)<br>  - There is no drinking even though bottles of wine are there, people are said to be drinking a lot of juice (wtf?)<br>  - No gun, they changed the guns into a water gun (wtf?), and I remember on one scene, Kaya is about to shoot Jango with her pistols. What did 4Kids do? They edit the pistol and changed it into..... a sling shot! O.O<br>  <br>  They also cut out several arc in One Piece. One thing you must know about One Piece, all those randomness serve its own purpose and some of the arc isn't randomly made by the creator. It all have its own reason to be there. One Piece covered a huge scale to the point that the mangaka had to break down a particular saga into several arc. For example, 4Kids cut out Laboon arc (the one about the whale) and later on, we learned that the arc is somehow connected with the past life of the newest member of the Straw Hat Crew. The creator already planned for that story when he first introduced Laboon. See how messed up it is if 4Kids continue dubbing One Piece? There will be a lot of plot holes if the company continue dubbing One Piece.<br>  <br>  Watch the top 10 worst 4Kids dub moment here though I don't think the user captured all worst moment in 4Kids version of One Piece<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2GXQlTZgxA" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2GXQlTZg...</a><br>  <br>  If we are talking about the voice actor, I didn't really dislike / hate the voice actor for 4Kids version in comparison to Funimation though I still prefer the subs better. Its the dialogue / script that I hate because of that puns and silly jokes made by 4Kids. <br>  <br>  Check out this guy rants about it<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rl9hjYtyzU&feature=related" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rl9hjYty...</a><br>  <br>  Combined this with the changes and heavily editing, no wonder people claimed this series to be childish and stupid series. On the most recent arc of the series the mangaka plays around a theme of human bargains / slave trade, racism and slavery. I don't think that theme is a childish and stupid :| Subs has more emotion to it.<br>  <br>  *SPOILER* When I watch the funeral of Going Merry I can actually hear Luffy voice sobbing when talking. It really felt like the voice actress for Luffy is crying at the time.<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrA4EowwCGo" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrA4EowwC...</a><br>  <br>  About the rap song.... You might enjoy this dude rants about 4Kids rap though XD<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3PbHjd7Y3I&feature=related" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3PbHjd7Y...</a><br>  <br>  So there ya go. The main reason One Piece fans didn't like 4Kids dub is because of those heavily editing. Dub is the add up factor. If you take a look around in this section, 60-70% of people here claimed One Piece as a childish, stupid pointless anime and they aren't willing to give this series a chance no matter what. 4Kids version gave that bad first impression to them and that's why we, One Piece fan 'hated' 4Kids that much because One Piece has been one of the series that has been misunderstood for a lot of people ever since they hit the States.|`|Ix4bLc16aa	unfortunately, many anime fans have become addicted to the subs. By the time the dubs came out, they just couldn't adjust. There were many flaws in the English dub, though. the only ones that really bothered me were the silly jokes and puns the characters would make when they were supposed to be serious. Other than that, i thought the voices were great, especially Zoro's. I loved Sanji's and Shanks' accents.<br>  In my opinion, the 4kids dub is / was far better than the funimation dub. Robin, Sanji and Zoro's voices suck.<br>  <br>  P. S. - I know all you die hard anime fans will disagree, but it's true!!!|`|SUknQxAEaa	The 4kids version is crap because they change the story, edit the art and give them ridiculous voices.<br>  <br>  They don't only edit blood, to not scare kids, but they also edit weird crap like from Rice balls to cookies. And Marine to Navy.<br>  <br>  <br>  A line from One Piece 4kids:<br>  "So Carue made it back home!"<br>  <br>  "I'd Say Carue was a lucky ducky."<br>  <br>  <br>  O-o;<br>  <br>  seriously. wtf.<br>  XD<br>  <br>  <br>  and they edit black kids to be white!!<br>  and they gave my favorite character, Sanji a horrid voice!<br>  DX<br>  <br>  <br>  Just because he has a cigarette and a suit does NOT mean he has to have a gangster accent.<br>  <br>  And just because Nico Robin has a cowboy hat doesn't mean she's from Texas, either.<br>  <br>  And they made Luffy sound like he has A.D.D.<br>  <br>  And Usopp sounds like a drunken clown.<br>  <br>  <br>  If you want one piece dub, i suggest watching the Funimation version.<br>  <br>  <br>  Sanji still has a f*cked up voice, but its better than David Moo.<br>  <br>  Moo.<br>  lol.<br>  <br>  >_><br>  <br>  <br>  anyways, Japanese is best in my opinion, the voice actors are just the best.

TJ2EfH7oaa	So, are you saying that blacks are getting special, or better treatment?  <br>  I don't think "racist" is the term you're looking for, unless you are saying that black people are being put in a bad light because of the show.<br>  As far as "equality" goes, I know what you mean.<br>  If there was WET (white entertainment television), like the BET, I bet there would be all kinds of moaning.  It's not just blacks.  Around here, there is the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce.  What are the chances of having the White Chamber of Commerce?<br>  <br>  Now days, if white people want to form a group, then they are accused of being a splinter of the KKK, no matter how noble the cause. <br>   "Reverse discrimination" is what is going on.|`|Hf94X5Wvaa	No, see, it's not racist because it makes fun of white people, if they made fun of black people THEN it would be racist.<br>  <br>  Seriously though, and yes I am kidding, no it's not racism, it's just a TV show. If you don't like it, don't watch it.<br>  <br>  Angelina: "Narrow minded American"<br>  <br>  You're one to talk, you don't even know what racism is...|`|ExaerfDraa	Black folks cant be racist. Only whitey.<br>  <br>  Just like if their was a white history month, a white affirmative action, and a christmas holiday reserved for only white people, a organization called the National Association for the Advancement of White People, a White Entertainment Television. You see, there is a double standard where blacks can segragate themselves from white society and not be called racist.|`|0742b3f870575abd3141e5f0a0eb40ffaa	VH-1 isnt any more a representative of all black people than Beevis and Butthead are of all white people.  Everybody is representative of themselves.|`|4kuWOZowaa	stop fussing whites got many shows with only white people on it...like housewives of orange county..boooo hooo|`|AA12305234	For them it's ok. But when the role is reversed, let's cry foul.|`|vGuZijMFaa	no its only racist if whites are doing it to blacks.<br>  gayy!<br>  i do agree.|`|9ZLoeoxIaa	It is, it's total bullshit|`|BW6sQQvAaa	idk why everyone getting all flustered over a question. <br>  <br>  anyway, i saw that commercial and i was like wow. it's not offensive to me, (i'm white lol) but i think it is hypocritical, like you said. <br>  <br>  and to the girl who said that white people have plenty of shows with all white people on it, well so do blacks, even with out the black to the future one. how about BET? i'm sorry but if blacks dont want to be segragated then why are they doing it to themselve with networks and shows like that? it's not offensive i'm not crying or anything - but like you it - makes me wonder. <br>  <br>  and as for completely white casted shows, they don't come right out and say " there's no blacks on our show " like 'black to the future' did which i though was a little much.<br>  <br>  but it's whatever :P|`|uyvSCUY7aa	i guess you could look at it that way, but really its just a bunch of shows that they are tying together with a common theme, which in this case is the black actors. Like a halloween movie marathon or something.  Its also putting the spot light on a minority, as opposed to most shows with a mainly white cast.  Who would watch a show about old white shows? almost all shows are already white! how would that get people to watch it?|`|x7zeMBa0aa	I'm feeling you, thats just how it is, whites segregate as blacks do to, all over the world thats how it is, and will be unfortunately|`|1hnVxJehaa	I agree|`|IGCZq7BXaa	i dont see anything wrong with it just dont watch it....|`|o2FJIXS9aa	If that's supposed to offend white people, it doesn't offend me. Maybe you could watch it to see if that's really true. See if a white person sneaks in somewhere.|`|b3fcaed1380d38d593a8cb71556b4d96aa	I would agree with you except for one thing:  how many "white" shows are there compared to black shows?  How many black people did you see on hugely popular shows like Seinfeld and Friends, for example--and they took place in NYC, which in reality is a very integrated city.  These shows aren't exactly from the distant past. <br>  I don't have a problem with this.  I do have a bit of a problem with people like you who look for racism where it doesn't exist.  Get over yourself, and don't worry--the white folks are still running most things, President Obama notwithstanding.<br>  Edit:  3iam, I find it disturbing that your question shows that you think of the world as being made up of us and THEM.  Your avatar shows a pretty young girl, but it seems your beauty is only skin deep; there are some ugly thoughts in that pretty head.|`|Rj3epU5yaa	didn't you get the memo?  it's ok to be racists as long as it's towards whites.  <br>  <br>  i'm not overly miffed about it, its not like they don't have reasons to be bitter.  i'll just forget it about it and remember that i have a job that i got with out having to pull a race card.|`|ytQfxuPyaa	White shows have always been like that. They just don't say it out loud.|`|hLSIRDtZaa	I'm black, and I agree it's not cool on either side. I have to ask you though...Why is it that in every scary movie the Black people have to die first, much less survive in the scary movies? Explain that to me. Kind of tells me subconsciously white people want to kill black people.  I mean, we don't make movies of white people coming to the hood and killing them. We do have black directors too, so we can make our own movies too. Not just depending on a white director to give us an acting part. No one said anything about back in the days when white people painted their faces black and had pink lips, all because they didn't want to put black folks in movies. Then when they did put black folks in movies, they made them play as if they were so terrified of the white man. PLEASE! No one's afraid of them! Not even the Klan. That's the role they wanted us to play, when in reality they were afraid of us. What's funny about that, is why would white people be afraid of black people when we never did anything to them since we came to America forcefully even after Slavery? Things you should think about. However, I agree with you on racially offensive statements are bad on our part as well. Blacks and Whites need to have topics like these to eliminate some of this bad tension and get it off our chest in order for things to get better for both of us, because we're all Americans. Good question though.

92n42vksaa	Thanks for bringing a smile to my face!!<br>  If thats what you look for in a friendship you may be right...... <br>  I would prefer the truthful friends myself (all women in your story)|`|S2uAq7i4aa	Ermm..what?What's the point of this "question"?<br>  Well,in my opinion your opposite sex makes a best friend,especially if they're loyal.|`|0oSMTHs7aa	girls are better because in the first scenario none of her friends told him like anything but in the second the guys friends make it seem obvious that he lied.... but i think only in that scenario, but usually guys probably make better friends because girls like to stab you in the back and talk about you behind your back where i guess guys arent as sneaky|`|kPbvGBDuaa	First off thats just 1 scenario. Not all people do those things. And second, the man could have just been smart about it and told his close friends to tell her that if she called and asked. You never really know. Its different with everyone.|`|KRNaKdpgaa	Guys make better friends<br>  <br>  Here's the deal<br>  <br>  Women constantly compare themselves to one another.

7taeKueVaa	well i play acoustic guitar. it  does take a while to learn. if you can't read music i suggest going to a music store and picking up alfred's basic guitar lessons.study the book adn read what it says after you've read it pick up the guitar and begin to learn the notes.  i suggest get lessons. if you are stubborn read it like i said before. then the first time you learn it will be the right way. if you really want to know how to play then go for it. even if you give up maybe all you really are doing is taking a break and after a week or so you will pick it right back up again.

Mizlm9ndaa	Well, I'd have to hear you sing and play to really know what your chances are, but as you seem to know, they're not good.  That said, go for it.  Most successful musicians have lived as bums for a good part of their lives until they finally made it.  You just have to give it everything.  I, too, just can't find a niche other than music.  And if it ends up that I can't perform for a living, then I'm going to get a music engineering degree and try at least to sell my songs.  Anyhow, best of luck to ya!  :D

Vg1YugjEaa	i hope this helps <br>  <br>  <br>  Annelies Marie "Anne" Frank ( pronunciation (help·info)) (12 June 1929 – early March 1945) was a Jewish girl born in the city of Frankfurt am Main in Weimar Germany. She gained international fame posthumously following the publication of her diary which documents her experiences hiding during the German occupation of the Netherlands in World War II.<br>  <br>  Anne and her family moved to Amsterdam in 1933 after the Nazis gained power in Germany, and were trapped by the occupation of the Netherlands, which began in 1940. As persecutions against the Jewish population increased, the family went into hiding in July 1942 in hidden rooms in her father Otto Frank's office building. After two years, the group was betrayed and transported to concentration camps. Seven months after her arrest, Anne Frank died of typhus in the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp, within days of the death of her sister, Margot Frank. Her father Otto, the only survivor of the group, returned to Amsterdam after the war to find that her diary had been saved, and his efforts led to its publication in 1947. It was translated from its original Dutch and first published in English in 1952 as The Diary of a Young Girl.<br>  <br>  The diary, which was given to Anne on her 13th birthday, chronicles her life from 12 June 1942 until 1 August 1944. It has been translated into many languages, has become one of the world's most widely read books, and has been the basis for several plays and films. Anne Frank has been acknowledged for the quality of her writing, and has become one of the most renowned and most discussed victims of the Holocaust|`|IQ3pERJOaa	that sucks you should of read the book. we shouldnt have to do your report for you. take responsibility!|`|AA10895264	ummm sparknotes ya? dude, its a way easy book, just read it now|`|eta0c25yaa	She was hiding and this lady was protecting her and her family.

At the start of her diary, Anne describes fairly typical girlhood experiences, writing about her friendships with other girls, her crushes on boys, and her academic performance at school. Because anti-Semitic laws forced Jews into separate schools, Anne and her older sister, Margot, attended the Jewish Lyceum in Amsterdam.<br>   <br>  The Franks had moved to the Netherlands in the years leading up to World War II to escape persecution in Germany. After the Germans invaded the Netherlands in 1940, the Franks were forced into hiding. With another family, the van Daans, and an acquaintance, Mr. Dussel, they moved into a small secret annex above Otto Frank's office where they had stockpiled food and supplies. The employees from Otto's firm helped hide the Franks and kept them supplied with food, medicine, and information about the outside world.<br>   <br>  The residents of the annex pay close attention to every development of the war by listening to the radio. Some bits of news catch Anne's attention and make their way into her diary, providing a vivid historical context for her personal thoughts. The adults make optimistic bets about when the war will end, and their mood is severely affected by Allied setbacks or German advances. Amsterdam is devastated by the war during the two years the Franks are in hiding. All of the city's residents suffer, since food becomes scarce and robberies more frequent.<br>   <br>  Anne often writes about her feelings of isolation and loneliness. She has a tumultuous relationship with the adults in the annex, particularly her mother, whom she considers lacking in love and affection. She adores her father, but she is frequently scolded and criticized by Mr. and Mrs. van Daan and Mr. Dussel. Anne thinks that her sister, Margot, is smart, pretty, and agreeable, but she does not feel close to her and does not write much about her. Anne eventually develops a close friendship with Peter van Daan, the teenage boy in the annex. Mr. Frank does not approve, however, and the intensity of Anne's infatuation begins to lessen.<br>   <br>  Anne matures considerably throughout the course of her diary entries, moving from detailed accounts of basic activities to deeper, more profound thoughts about humanity and her own personal nature. She finds it difficult to understand why the Jews are being singled out and persecuted. Anne also confronts her own identity. Though she considers herself to be German, her German citizenship has been revoked, and though she calls Holland her home, many of the Dutch have turned against the Jews. Anne feels a tremendous solidarity with her aggrieved people, and yet at the same time she wants to be seen as an individual rather than a member of a persecuted group.<br>   <br>  During the two years recorded in her diary, Anne deals with confinement and deprivation, as well as the complicated and difficult issues of growing up in the brutal circumstances of the Holocaust. Her diary describes a struggle to define herself within this climate of oppression. Anne's diary ends without comment on August 1, 1944, the end of a seemingly normal day that leaves us with the expectation of seeing another entry on the next page. However, the Frank family is betrayed to the Nazis and arrested on August 4, 1944. Anne's diary, the observations of an imaginative, friendly, sometimes petty, and rather normal teenage girl, comes to an abrupt and silent end.<br>   <br>  Otto Frank is the family's sole survivor, and he recovers Anne's diary from Miep. He decides to fulfill Anne's wishes by publishing the diary. Anne's diary becomes a condemnation of the unimaginable horror of the Holocaust, and one of the few accounts that describe it from a young person's perspective.<br>   <br>  Since Anne's diary is a true personal account of a life in hiding, it is inappropriate to analyze it as a novel or other work of fiction. Parts of the diary were intended for public view, but others clearly were not. To appreciate and interpret the diary, it is necessary to consider its horrible context, World War II and the Holocaust, before any discussion of plot development or thematic content.

So when we go out, why don't we try imagining the sky FULL of amazing stars?! Tell me if it works.

You can search the internet but I doubt you will be able to find it.

wck4MHREaa	Teh suckksssss!!!<br>  <br>  Answering your question: Depends where you live kiddo. Are you from a small town with one theatre or a bigger one with like 5 or 6 theaters in a 20 mile radius (like I am)? Your best bet either way would be to buy your tickets on Fandango, especially since the same thing happened last year w/ the Hannah Montana 3D concert thingy. Normally when you buy online though, it is more expensive (like $3 surcharge or something). But you're paying for convenience and piece of mind that you won't get sold out. You can always try to buy tickets the day of the show, but you're risking not getting tickets that way.<br>  <br>  Or, one other solution- wait until next week. I (yes, I, a 19 year old college student) went to the Hannah Montana 3D concert a week after it opened, and the theater had 7 people- me, my two friends, a mom and her daughter (and her friends). So you'll be able to see it I'm sure.|`|bd499f5017ffc8776de9bfd98e2a4ef1aa	BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!<br>  JONAS BROS SUCK!!!!!<br>   and thats a fact, not my opinion|`|DEK6CQQQaa	Check the company you buy online from my company charges a dollar extra per ticket.  You can buy tickets early but it won't make a difference if you don't show up early to get a good seat.  <br>  <br>  My theater doesn't sell out all the seats so even if you buy the last ticket there should be at least 30 seats open.  For 3D all kids have to pay for tickets so those 30 seats should be there.<br>  <br>  If you're not in school go in the morning when all the kids are in school.  I'm watching it only for the fact that its in 3D and its the first movie we are ever showing in 3D.|`|yV1jZkqGaa	i dont know!<br>  <br>  are you in the uk or somewhere else?<br>  <br>  if you're in the uk, they're not on sale yet i don't think, and if you're in the usa, probably.. they're massive over there :(:( aww im sorry if they are.. <br>  <br>  OH! check out the IMAX website, they'll have JB on there :)|`|pkeAI7h9aa	NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
QyQ6XoLbaa	I could be wrong, but the whole "Alternative" scene began with groups like Nirvana, who completely distanced themselves from the then-norm of hair bands and bad eighties stuff.

What are you looking for? <br>  <br>  Most folk find that when they need spiritual of psychic guidance a Psychic falls onto their pathway, maybe you should leave the search alone as your lack of faith will enable you to be defensive during a reading & mistrust the reader, neither are good ingredients darling.

Their music still makes a bit more sense than the rest.|`|ETWQ3SaPaa	TOTALLY!!!!!! I thought I was the only person in the whole WORLd who thought that!! I mean what happened to the music??? The lyrics to the songs are all of the meaning and the lyrics is the soul to a song. I mean the lyrics are the big present and the beat is just the wrapping on the box. There needs to be more songs like the songs sung by the Beatles, Eagles, Billy Joel, and Boy George. <br>  Right now most people just care about the beat and if you can dance to it or something. What happened to the TRUE Music??

People influenced by Sabbath, Zeppelin, etc. will form bands that overtake the mainstream. We may also see some grunge influenced artists and pop/hiphop will lose much of it's fanbase.

Production begins in late April, and SAMCRO should be back on the air in September, give or take a month.<br>  <br>  Another quote -<br>  <br>  On October 6, 2008, FX said it had ordered a second 13-episode season of the series. <br>  <br>  According to Kurt Sutter these episodes will likely premiere in September 2009.  He also says that writing has begun for the second season with filming beginning the last week of April.<br>  <br>  <br>  That is the closest to a date I have found.  So, who wins the bet?

AA11402685	It really depends on a lot of things. What kind of movies does your mom like to watch. Do you have common interests in the types of movies you each like. I'm 42 and my daughter is 12. We both enjoy watching her type of movies (like Cinderella Story, Camp Rock, John Tucker must die, Beverly Hills Chihuahua, Journey to the Center of the Earth-with Brendan Fraser & Josh Hutcherson. etc.) and we both enjoy movies I like (Indiana Jones, National Treasure, The Lake House, etc.) as well as some old 80's classics. Just ask your mom what types of movies she likes and see if you can come up with some common ground. Good luck. It's fun when you can sit down with your mom and watch movies, have popcorn, laugh together, cry together.

U8aXa8xEaa	I have been hearing that for a few years now.  I believe that the show IS in trouble.  But they are on the right track bringing back classic characters like Phillip and Edmund.  I hear they might bring back Michelle and Danny Santos too.  I would love to see them bring back Jonathan.  (But please, bring back the same actor that played him before.  He was so good as Jonathan!)  I think that they are planning to bring him back.  I think Phillip will be the one to bring him and Sarah back to help make things up to Lizzie.<br>  <br>  Edit --  That's why the CBS station in New York moved the show to 10 a.m.  So they could get more New Yorkers to watch the show and they put Dr. Phil up against General Hospital at 3 p.m.|`|8xdcBKfUaa	This rumor has indeed been around while, especially since Guiding Light's conversion to handheld video taping rather than the multi-camera setup. I too have heard this several times, even today. It was thought that the returns of Phillip and Edmund would boost ratings, but this turned out to no avail. It's almost like Guiding Light is taking the storylines purposely slow, in order to buy time. At this point, I think that Guiding Light will go before Days of Our Lives does. It's almost ashamed to see a 72-year-old history maker go out in a blaze of bad ratings, bad acting, and bad storylines, but that looks like what it will come to. Don't get me wrong; I love to watch Guiding Light, or I used to at least. And I hate this for them, but it's just come to be that time in a soap opera's life that is its time to expire. R.I.P Guiding Light.|`|irSBrZiQaa	This rumor has been swirling for quite some time. Apparently the ratings keep getting lower and lower. A lot of fans stopped watching when they switched to the new filming format in February of last year. Then people started to watch less and less as all the well loved characters started to leave(Harley,Gus and so on)..Guiding Light has been the longest running soap in daytime history, so I hope that they will be able to pull themselves out of this mess. With them bringing back Phillip was a good move and hopefully they will continue to do that with some of the other long term characters. <br>  <br>  There was a question asked a few days ago about canceling Guiding Light here is the link to the question. <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=Am6xx9CzLG0bqK2liipvewrsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090224132257AAQ3VEr">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|2kpr2arRaa	the show has been in trouble for a couple yrs now- they had to move to a cheaper studio - go to handheld cameras and shoot outside more- which cuts down on the tech/studio crew<br>  <br>  they fired or had actors take pay cuts-some actors left<br>  <br>  the ratings having been going down for 2-3 straight yrs now-Gl is at the bottom of the soap ratings<br>  <br>  it currently gets half the viewers ( ratings wise) of what Y&R gets- thus making the network less money|`|pI5EAAUcaa	This is the 2nd time I've heard this today. <br>  I've been a loyal fan since 1980! I really hope they don't cancel it. It IS the longest running soap and I hope it stays running! <br>  I think it gets better and better. <br>  I also read that they're bringing Michelle and Danny back this spring. <br>  Perhaps all these actors coming back (recently Phillip) is a last hurrah for the soap??<br>  I just hope they don't cancel it.|`|a1Ngi39Xaa	Anita gave you a link to a question that lists the phone number, email and mailing address you can use to contact the Powers That Be at CBS and tell them you are a GL fan.  Don't know if it will help at this point, but I suppose it is worth a shot.<br>  <br>  I started watching GL with my Mom after school and in the summers, many years ago.  We had stopped watching it for awhile but I have gotten back into it the past 3 months or so.  There has been such great acting performances lately.  Beth and Buzz have done wonderful jobs.  I thought bringing back Phillip, Alex, and Edmund would help.  <br>  <br>  They are now getting back to the core of the extended families, which, in my opinion, is what made it a great show to begin with!

They show a diagram of where to put you're fingers!|`|oqUCqiFeaa	The note after the slash is the note you're supposed to play at the very bottom.<br>  <br>  i.e: C/G<br>  <br>  E  0<br>  B  1<br>  G  0<br>  D  2<br>  A  3<br>  E  3<br>  <br>  As opposed to a normal C, which is:<br>  <br>  E  0<br>  B  1<br>  G  0<br>  D  2<br>  A  3<br>  E  x<br>  <br>  It gets a lot more complex than this, but you get the idea.

hzH75VDXaa	I personally love the animation chosen for some Marvel cartoons.<br>  All the X-men cartoons are wonderfully animated.<br>  The 90' Spider-man was well done, as so was Spider-man and his amazing friends though now it looks old since it's from the early 80's.<br>  I also really liked the animation from Hulk vs. though they made Deadpool too scrawny.<br>  <br>  Have you seen the new Batman cartoon?<br>  That's better than Wolverine and the X-Men?<br>  <br>  The 90's Superman, Batman and Justice league (well Justice league was early 2000's) were nicely drawn though (considering all three were done by the same artists) I prefer the 90's X-Men, Spider-man, and Hulk.|`|dfjIBHe3aa	Frankly, I enjoyed the Dr. Strange DVD more than I enjoy the Brave And the Bold (for example).  I enjoyed it more than I've enjoyed a LOT of the Dr. Strange Comics of the past fifteen years.  Marvel has always taken more risks than DC.  Seriously.  And sometimes they haven't worked.  I don't know what to think about that they are going to do Thor again.  And not animated (no wooden ships in space? Sigh).  I can't argue with your opinions of the shows you cite.  Mine isn't much higher.  But that Dr. Strange is awesome.  I strongly suggest you get your hands on it.|`|5EtiRi2yaa	Not completely. Ummm X-Men 90s animation by far rivals Justic League in my opinion. I agree right not DC is kicking but as far as animation. umm i liked the new FF series but I never knew it was on b/c of lack of promotion. I think the stories were just dumb and slow that's why it got cancelled. I agree I didn't like the look of this Spiderman, but honestly that was the only thing I watched on Sat. mornings. I think the 3d looking one that was on Mtv was cool.  What else are they releasing? I know Wolverine and X-Men is out (which i hate the wolverine being added in there. I'm not impressed with the costumes or storylines as of yet)<br>  <br>  I'm thinking it's cheaper to do it this way b/c it takes less time = less money. On X-Men that was the best but drawing all the muscles and maybe shading toook a lot of time. I dn't knwo. maybe the budget isn't there either. When 90s x-men was out wasn't the comic selling a million each issue?|`|4Gukq5xPaa	I think they all are good. IM a true DIE HARD MARVEL fan. and everything they do is flawless.<br>  The Fantastic four on was good. The Spectacular spider man is the best! and The new Iron man one is Great! Im sorry but your off!|`|Yw1zIYK6aa	Sir, that is completely and utterly opinion. I know many people who like the Marvel animations.<br>  Dr. Dog|`|oGuV3yMtaa	well if the story line is good does that art really matter?|`|1Zc4NZJsaa	I have to disagree. As was already mentioned before, this is your opinion. <br>  <br>  I'll agree that their older cartoons are lacking in certain areas, but no more than other cartoons, ones from DC as well. <br>  <br>  The newer cartoons are fine, though a bit to Anime-ish for my tastes...|`|xkZcDVbjaa	OMG that is so not true. Marvel animation, in my opinion, is way better than DC. Marvel also has better superheroes and storylines. I think DC is the one that needs to take some lessons from Marvel.
376abf017f5ceda0dc7a5f6414b42db2aa	Yeah, I agree with you!! Rose is way interesting. I love how she always has a comment, and she always has a comeback for when people try to tell her her business. She's so quick and snarky. Bella is just so boring. She's too passive and that gets really annoying. She only seems to have a glimmer of a personality when you make her angry. Time well spent in her opinion is swooning over Edward.<br>  <br>  I love the twists in VA. Mead really isn't afraid to "go there" with her books (I know, I've read them all). I love and hate Shadow Kiss because of the twist at the end. But I really do think it makes for a better book, and a better series. There's a point to the books now, and Rose and all of the other characters grow so much throughout the series. It's awesome how Mead shows their growth. I'm guessing we'll see Lissa grow and change too now that she's without Rose. She'll have to learn to be on her own for once.<br>  <br>  In contrast to Rose, Bella never changes. She doesn't grow. She doesn't even have to do anything to get everything she wants!! Rose has to fight for everything, even the right to be able to let herself come first for once in her life (I'm talking about the last few pages of Shadow Kiss here).<br>  <br>  Bella is like the anti-Rose. She doesn't fight for anything. And Rose is like this badass guardian that isn't afraid to do what she has to do even if it means putting her life in danger. Bella can't even tie her own shoes without risking her life.<br>  <br>  The real problem with Twilight is that Bella doesn't have a life outside of Edward. It's sort of sickening actually. Her life is meaningless, even to herself. I find that kind of sad. And with Rose, her life has purpose. She's so young, and she already knows her responsibility. She'd give her life to save those she cares about, and you see that in the books numerous times. Bella on the other hand, doesn't care about anyone else but Edward, including herself. Like she says, she'd rather die than be without him. And that's another thing that I love about VA. Rose loves life sooo much. And Bella is so ready to throw hers away.<br>  <br>  I also love the relationships between the characters in VA. All of Mead's characters are flawed, and it changes how they interact with each other. For example, Rose and Dimitri's relationship. They don't fall in love upon meeting, and it takes them months to even admit that they care for each other. I never really understood how Bella could fall so in love with Edward and want to throw her life away for him.<br>  <br>  I also never liked that Edward was so jealous and controlling. What exactly was Meyer trying to say when Edward disabled Bella's car because he wanted to keep her at home?<br>  <br>  IMO Bella is the worst character in creation. She is so selfish. I really don't even think she loves Edward. When he goes away, she only misses him because SHE can't live without him. She never even considers HIS feelings because she can't think past her own. She's like an infant.|`|nQ25rpTuaa	These books are not comics nor animation!!

I have to say ._. That Twilight DID have a plot and a good one.<br>  <br>  From what I can tell from VA is, it's Romance and Action drama-ish.<br>  Twilight is pure 100% all love romance drama. Seriously that why it's good that's why people like it so much. The drama of being human, choosing between to guys, maybe dying and parting from Edward. o-o<br>  <br>  P.S. And for thoes who Say Twilight is NOT a comic, please look again.<br>  <br>  Twilight was made a Manga in Japan instead of a novel! >_< So Twilight **can** fit here but **Shouldn't** since we are all talking about the novel not the manga :x So please move this question to the B&A!

rsAqrbsgaa	I don't really care about the genres.  I just listen to what sounds good.<br>  Just cause you asng one song to country doesn't mean you have be a complete country singer and that you can't have any R&B songs or rock songs.  Just sing to what flows with the words, it really doesn't matter.  I like pretty much all her songs and i can't tell which ones are pop and which are country.|`|wA8Dyhq7aa	You decide for yourself:  listen to "It Wasn't God Who Made Honky Tonk Angels" by Kitty Wells, then listen to a Taylor Swift song, then tell me they're the same genre.  If you think it is, then ask yourself why do so many people who like Swift and her ilk claim they cannot stand that "whiny, twangy" country music?<br>  <br>  And let me assure you I'm not "picking on" Swift.  I say the exact same thing about those Jimmy Webb songs that Glen Campbell recorded back in the late 1960s, that woeful "A Touch of Velvet" album Jim Reeves did in 1962 (and he is my favorite singer!), the garbage that was winning awards in the early 70s (the music then was so pop it spawned Waylon, Willie, and others to create the so-called "outlaw" movement -- the sad thing is I don't see people rebeling against it today), and even the song that bears the distinction of being the first #1 song in the history of the "Billboard" country music charts ("Pistol Packin' Mama" -- by BING CROSBY).<br>  <br>  IT IS NOT COUNTRY.|`|CoCn3GbOaa	Just because you are in the Country genre does not mean you are country by any means. Country is a way of life, and REAL country music reflects that life. The stuff coming out of Nashville today would make Hank Williams Sr. spin in his grave. Taylor Swift is not from the country and has not lived that life, so for most of us who actually live in the country she seems like an imposter. Someone who is pretending to be something she ain't.|`|yARnuOpraa	she just sucks..and has bad hair.|`|PuRpsENEaa	She sings Pop music. shes good, just not country.|`|9f0d54c35894f05249bcafb57c720e4baa	....Taylor has a beautiful voice,but her tone and the subjects of her songs are a "Bubblegum" view of a teens life.She is a writter and can pen a good song but it is time she should look into another style of song.I have always said her voice would fit a 70's or 80's country song but until she "matures" her songs she wil;l be looked to as an "alternative-bubblegum - pop - Country " singer.|`|AA11065140	Hm...I have mixed feelings.<br>  <br>  In truth, if you listen to her sound, and compare that to Reba McEntire, or Martina McBride, she has a VERY pop sound...at least in comparison.  Pop fans probably think she has too much of a country twang to fit in with their music!<br>  <br>  Generally, I like her singing, but would appreciate having her lyrics "grow up" a little bit.  I know she's young, but there's a lot more to life than ex boyfriends.|`|CbywwVSdaa	In my opinion, she's a country artist. All her songs have that country edge to them, the least country song she has out there is "Change" and I think the pop versions are AWFUL. She is a country singer and she should stay that way!|`|Q7jLqFZmaa	I think she is a great country star and she should stick with it. Just because she is young and is a favorable musician by most tweens and teens doesn't mean she should switch genres. I agree with you.|`|4c874e283dd92b6b16b07e3f459300f8aa	How can you call the song "Tim Mcgraw" not Country you ask? Pretty easy..IT'S NOT COUNTRY!!..See?

As a songwriter, however, she has real talent.  No one has ever captured the teenage girls viewpoint so well.|`|YUDVmb77aa	her songs are more pop real country is the older stuff like Johnny cash and hank williams sr. and jr. she not country it changed a lot so that more people will listen to so it would become more popular that's all|`|7eI8DtuUaa	I think that she should be country because that's where she started and that's where she should stay.|`|At7iKpONaa	"Taylor Swift always says she is going to stick with country music because that's what she's heard all her life"...no she hasn't heard country all her life. She listed people like Shania Twain as her role models, Shania also helped w/ the pop country movement that I can't stand. But at least Shania could sing, and her songs could be related to by someone other then a teenager. Just because Taylor is on CMT doesn't make her country..CMT also plays kid rock, trading spouses and other crap that has nothing to do with country music. It gets under my skin because I grew up with country music, its a part of my life, and it means so much to me, and to see where it is now, and where its heading kills me. When people who 5 years ago could NOT stand country music, now say they like it, it makes me laugh. Because what they are hearing and saying they like is nothing close to country music. Taylor = pop fluff. And here's the kicker, I actually like pop music, but only if you are calling yourself a pop singer. I really don't like her because I think she's a poser.|`|9wGsFBZPaa	Well her first album Taylor Swift is more country. Fearless is classified as "Country Pop" but it s definitely leaning more towards pop. If I had to pick between the two, I would classify Fearless as pop, but I would call Taylor a Country-Pop singer. Either way, she's still amazing :)|`|efLPLAt9aa	i think it is kind of a mix. It could be consider as both i guess.|`|rM5Tofhwaa	She sings a lot of pop|`|WuKI9WiVaa	I consider her country. i love her. :)|`|wztGyr0daa	country of course!!!  hello!!!!  she was born to be a country star!!!!

BbiyBG0oaa	At the beginning he just wanted to kill people thats why he thought he was brought into the world was to kill people because he was the "sand's secret weapon."  But when he fought Naruto, Naruto showed him that even though your alone you can still find people that are there for you and you fight for the people who are important to you.  In Shippuuden Gaara finally realized that and wanted to fight for the people he cared about and wanted people to do the same for him, which is when Naruto came after him when Akatsuki captured him.  In one of the episodes it shows kakashi talking about how Naruto has a mysterious power because he can change people and he changed Gaara.  Gaara's brother also talks about how Naruto has changed Gaara as well, so yes Gaara is a different kind of person in Shippuuden and yes he likes a lot of people.|`|fVl8dJbIaa	Not romantically, but he does respect a good deal of people after he comes down from his psychotic murder phase, especially Naruto since Naruto was the one to open his eyes.|`|3N2ElzcQaa	He doesn't have an interest in anyone.

PumYhJSvaa	I've never heard of it, but there was that movie Twitches. Now I am curious if that is the plot. Edit: Definitely not Twitches. <br>  <br>  Or it could be The Initiation of Sarah.<br>  <br>  When Sarah, a girl with magic powers, and her normal twin sister Lindsey are invited to join both Alpha Nu Gamma and Pi Epsilon Delta, they discover that the two sororities aren't just rivals, they're bitter enemies. Suddenly, Sarah and Lindsey are initiated into an ancient battle between good and evil that threatens to drive the sisters apart and force one of them to make the ultimate sacrifice. Can Sarah learn to master her magic in time to defeat the resident evil on campus? Who can she trust and who will commit an unforgivable act of betrayal? The magic starts flying and anything can happen. When these supernatural forces collide, they'll give new meaning to hell week.

ubrYk78waa	I remembered that movie and I think I found it.<br>  <br>  Hope and Glory (1987) <br>  <br>  Bill Rohan, a young boy living on the outskirts of London experiences the exhilaration of World War II, as seen through the eyes of director John Boorman, who also wrote and produced the autobiographical film. During this period, Bill learns about sex, death, love, hypocrisy, and the faults of adults as he prowls the ruins of bombed houses on Rosehill Avenue.

Well, you could talk to someone and then you will forget about the song, or you could listen to the song that is stuck in your head because after you listen to it, you won't want to hear it in your head anymore and then you will stop hearing it in your head. You could also start humming a song that you randomly make up and sing a little tune. There are a million ways to get a song out of your head, basically just occupy yourself with something else. So it could be reading, going on the computer, playing video games, watching a movie, doing homework. So hope this helps you (= .|`|kDcw5QkKaa	Sing a different song. Loud.

vsy4QMHMaa	Acciaccatura (with the slash through the tail) is played at the same time as the note that follows. The Latin root word for Acciaccatura is to "crush" or "squash together"<br>  <br>  Appoggiatura (Grace note; no slash) is played before the note. the Latin root for the word is to "lean on", "support" or "base, foot, podium"|`|qswrz268aa	One is an Appoggiatura and the other is an Acciaccatura. The Appoggiatura is the one without a line, and an Acciaccatura is the one with the line. (big words!!!) <br>  <br>  Anyway, an Acciaccatura is played quickly leading to the note, and before the beat, like "biting" the note. <br>  <br>  An Appoggiatura is a note that is played on the beat and, well... On second thought, here's a nice wiki article... They can explain it a lot better.

That is a really hard question because I like the wolves too.|`|3d40b4f2a24630bfafce9bb96d212203aa	Tough choice: I love Jacob, I think his character really developed as the book went on and seem a bit daring and awesome because he didn't treat Bella like a child and when she was with him she seems more independent and stronger. I love Edward too because he give you depth and emotions, so it is a catch 22 for me. But I love them ALL even the bad guys were kind of cool. Sorry, but I still think Bella was an idoit for the most part of the books I really didn't like how she was written I think she could had been more developed as a character in her own right.|`|vqlkecS5aa	EDWARD CULLEN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Love his cocky little attitude. ^.^<br>  <br>  'What happened Bella, fall down again?'<br>  'No Emmett, I punched a werewolf in the face.'<br>  Favorite quote, ever.|`|5kgCYM5Caa	I for one don't like how Edward was portrayed in the movie.

And not everyone has either.<br>  I'm sorry you got yelled at when all you were trying to do was help her.  What I'm trying to say is that if she is telling everyone about it, she just wants attention.<br>  She wanted to hear you say "Please don't." That's why she acted like a b**** because she didn't want to admit that what she's doing is wrong.  She knows its self-destructive... try to talk someone about it, like a counselor at school, someone who can take action. <br>  And If she starts bragging about how her pants are too big for her now, don't let it get to you.  Just go, "Gosh, you're conceited.  I'm not gonna listen to you whine incessantly, idiot."  Turn her words against her!  That was rude of her to say that to you!|`|OqyZeL9uaa	noo wayy..im on the heavy side and im like "ohmigod im soo fat im gonna starve myself" and then i go home and eat like everything lmfao<br>  so i doubt it..just check on her once in a while. nothing big.|`|4FqP313qaa	if you starve yourself you actually end up losing less weight, because your body senses crisis, so it burns calories and stuff wayy more slowly. <br>  tell her 2 eat a lil more.|`|AA12382198	She sounds like a minor......tell your friends parents what she told you....there's nothing you can do to change her mind if she's serious about this.|`|ZMPMqYV0aa	if she tries to starve to get skinnier she will just get bigger when she eats again.|`|0b09e77e84e77844850e09ff87b52905aa	Ask her about her diet.  How many calories is she getting.  What exactly did she eat yesterday.  If its quite small or you think she is lying, or she gets defensive you need to talk to her parents.  You don't have to let her know you spoke to her parents.  If she is indeed bulimic or has anorexia nervosa she will need help.  This syndrome can cause malnutrition, irregular or non-existence periods, osteoporosis, esophageal varices, electrolyte imbalances and even death.  She needs help.|`|qlA9Lhazaa	Get her help. Tell her parents or a guidance counselor IMMEDIATELY. Please please please help her before  it gets worse. I suffered from anorexia and bulimia and no one would help me. She is  so lucky to have someone like you. I still struggle. And don't listen to Jean. This is not normal!|`|eFo0Zih6aa	she should probably go to the school guidence counselor.|`|GZgH1kp8aa	yus, she iz a phattie.|`|eKSAUWpFaa	Firstly i would just lyk to say tat u r a really good fren! :)<br>  some ppl just let her go by herself and dun care abt her.. but u r doin the otherwise- caring abt her.. :)<br>  <br>  First of all, try tellin ur fren to try losing weight the traditional way cuz its the most healthiest and the best way compared to slimming pills or starvation..<br>  if she starts starving herself now, firstly her metabolism rate decreases and when she starts eating "normally" again she is sure to put on around 10 or more pounds.. :(   further, her body will not have the proper nutrients and tat might lead to health problems..<br>  talk to her slowly abt this. cuz sometimes she is SURELY not gonna listen to u.. and try to build her selfconfidence back into her again!<br>  its not gonna be easy.. but GOOD LUCK! :)

Music is Eminem's passion. When one loses him or her self "in the music" they are living their passion, so to speak. Music is such an important aspect of his life, he submerges himself in it when he writes, sings, produces, and raps. He is sending the message to his audience that they should do the same and pursue their passions.|`|MZHXUcXbaa	Taking advantage of what you have in front of you take do something great|`|0deO62tvaa	listen to the lyrics<br>  <br>  they're pretty self explanatory|`|fKZxK8gKaa	it's about when he lived on 8 mile

4zscfvvoaa	You are really asking way to much and not giving enough information for a correct answer.  You have to know what kind of guitar you want.  Accoustic or electric.  What sound do you like?  If you know the difference between electric and Accoustic you have a good start.  I highly suggest learning on accoustic, do to building finger strength.  You might find this discourages you from learning though, since if will be harder to play.  Most start with a nylon stringed accoustic making it easier on the fingers.<br>  <br>  My suggestion to you is that you go to your local guitar store.  Most of the guys working in these stores are not going to try to steer you wrong.  They will give you good advice.<br>  <br>  One thing I will tell you is if you purchase an accoustic guitar, make sure that it is constructed as a solid body.  Not a laminate, but solid body.  This will cost you a bit more, but makes a great difference in sound.<br>  <br>  You really need to know what you want though.

GqtSwmdqaa	yeah it is,, i wouldnt buy it though|`|Vi8RDbhUaa	I have a Epi Les Paul Custom.  I find it a bit heavy (weight) but it is a good guitar.  If you've never held one and played around with it, don't buy it until you handle it. This goes for any Guitar purchase. Get down to the music store and play around with them and see what feels good to you.|`|2k8TEiRtaa	I think so. I would buy it. Especially if you go through paypal to pay for it. Paypal will help you dispute the sale if you don't like it. Even if the seller refuses to retun your money. I have done this before with a computer. You only have a few minutes. If you don't have paypal , then I don't recommend it.|`|ahH0AD80aa	<a href="http://www.ciao.co.uk/Epiphone_Les_Paul_Custom_Electric_Guitar__48941" rel="nofollow">http://www.ciao.co.uk/Epiphone_Les_Paul_...</a><br>  <br>  Scroll to the bottom, there's peoples reviews :D|`|sJNoTGQVaa	Les Pauls are great guitars, especially epiphones. but I really do suggest you stray away from ebay if you wanna buy a good guitar|`|NXrYtxFmaa	looks sweet, but cant you get it at guitar center on sale.|`|DIxbib1paa	A few words of advice, NEVER buy a second hand guitar!|`|6ISBTafTaa	You would be better off actually playing the instrument you are going to buy.

I'm just going to link to it, because it has descriptions and video clips.  There are some magical girl shows mixed in there, though.<br>  <br>  For ones I think you would like that aren't on your list: Scrapped Princess and Fafner in the Azure (Soukyuu no Fafner).  ESPECIALLY Scrapped Princess, which is an anime about a princess destined to destroy the world, and kind of fits with the "feel" of some of the other stuff on your list.  Check that one out.

(Utena is really pink, but also pretty twisted...moreso the more you get into it.)

And if you like D. Gray-Man, check out Trinity Blood.  And if you like Death Note, check out Monster and Spiral.

M8qLP7MLaa	I don't think it's in America yet. I've heard a lot of rumours of when it's going to be airing in America but it varies a lot. I don't think anyones really knows for sure. The last rumour I heard said it would be some time in June, but don't hold your breath. I guess you could say that Shippuden is only in Japan, but there are people who translate the episodes and add subtitles to it so a lot of people just watch it online. <br>  <br>  In the first part of Naruto, Naruto Uzumaki is 12 or 13 years old. In Shippuden, he's 15 or 16 as Shippuden begins after Naruto returns to the village after being away training for 2 and 1/2 years.|`|BcxFmLRiaa	yeah i also like it a lot piushthegreat<br>  you can watch stream here<br>  <a href="http://sn.im/cdit8" rel="nofollow">http://sn.im/cdit8</a>
m4PtEEDNaa	...actually, that sounds more like the murderous exploits of Michael Myers, in 2002's "Halloween: Resurrection", rather than one of Jason's movies...|`|waGFlfRUaa	Halloween: Resurrection / 2002.<br>  <br>  6 college students appear on an internet reality show and spend the night in the childhood home of Michael Myers. (Not Jason).<br>  <br>  A sequel is in the works...|`|vCidaEbCaa	it wasnt a "Jason" movie but you were close,<br>   it was Halloween: Resurrection (2002) when a group of kids streamed their night in the meyers home over the web while getting killed Busta Rymes was in it,
SHwuzsPyaa	who watches television anymore?|`|7XM4QJiuaa	<a href="http://abc.go.com/daytime/" rel="nofollow">http://abc.go.com/daytime/</a>|`|ADBMrG87aa	Tea apologized to Antonio for not divulging what she knew about Vanessa before Cristian got married to Vanessa but Antonio didn't accept her apology.   Cristian told Vanessa at the police station that he'll have their marriage annulled and Vanessa continued to profess her love for Cristian but Cristian didn't believe her and then Ray Montez was brought in handcuffs and Vanessa and Ray looked at each other and Vanessa said that until the day she dies, she will know that Ray is guilty of murdering his wife but then Lola appeared and shouted at Vanessa to stop it and then Vanessa plead to Lola that she loves her and she was trying to protect her but Lola didn't believe her.  <br>  Meanwhile Blair and John were in Wes's apartment, the crime scene and Blair kept accusing John of being in love with Marty and John kept denying it and then Blair said she's had enough, that she deserves alot more and that's something John can't offer her and so their relationship is over and they both shed tears and Blair left.  Meanwhile back in jail, Ray Montez spoke with Marty and told her to fight if she believes she's innocent of the murder charges so Marty called John and asked for his help.<br>  Talia and Antonio were discussing what was going to happen to Ray Montez now that it seems that he was framed by Vanessa and Antonio said to Talia that this would mean that the killer is still out there somewhere.<br>  Ray and Lola spoke briefly before he was taken by cops in handcuffs and Lola said it was all her fault why Ray is in handcuffs and was in jail for so long in Columbia and Ray said that its not her fault, that it was all Vanessa's fault and then he was carted off in handcuffs.  Lola said to herself; "Pappi, its all my fault, I did this to you, I hurt Mom."  I guess the writers want to lead the viewers to believe that Lola might be the killer.<br>  Bo is told that he's the father of David and the Buchanans demanded that new tests be run again so swabs were taken again.  David Vickers called Bo Daddy and that he wish he had known Bo years ago and maybe he David would have turned out better and Bo told him to knock it off and Bo left feeling irritated and confused.  Meanwhile Rex was confronting his mother Roxy but she wept and said that the father was a very bad man and that she had killed him and he was so bad that she don't want to relive the memories or utter his name and that she didn't tell him to protect him so he wouldn't think that if he came from a bad seed, then he will turn out to be a bad seed.<br>  Blair showed up at the Buchanans mansion and Renee opened the door and said that the last vulture is here.  Blair entered and went to see Dorian who was on the phone trying to see what she can milk out of the Buchanans since David is Bo's son.  Then Dorian saw that Blair wanted to cry and then Blair started to cry when Dorian asked what was wrong.<br>  <br>  (\__/)<br>  (='.'=)<br>  (")-(")<br>  Sweetie|`|28WPZ06Jaa	Ok. Soo. If you watched yesterday, you know that Bo found out he is David Vickers' father. (Weird!) Everyone was shocked, obviously, and they had the test guy take more samples and run the tests again. Rex went to see Roxy and she won't tell him who is real father is. She said he is a horrible person and that she killed him, even though she didn't. Marty is still in jail and Ray Montez talked to her today and convinced her she didn't kill Wes. Blair and John are officially over. Andd I think that's about it. :)

NQ37mnWkaa	Vangelis is rather good, though I only have his "Chariots of Fire" soundtrack. <br>  <br>  <br>  Some of these aren't really 'New Age', but similar in style :~<br>  [artist : album]<br>  <br>  Enigma : "MCMXC a.D." ; "Love Sensuality Devotion" <br>  Delerium : "Semantic Spaces" ; "Karma" ; "Chimera"<br>  Jean Michel Jarre : "Oxygene" ; "Equinoxe"<br>  Rondo Veneziano : "Very Best of Rondo Veneziano"<br>  Mike Oldfield : "Tubular Bells" ; "Hergest Ridge" ; "Ommadawn" ; "Incantations"<br>  <br>  Various Artists : "Pure Moods" (original 1994 album)<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_Moods#Pure_Moods_.28original_1994_release.29" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_Moods#...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  I completely forgot about Clannad!<br>  Their early albums are rather traditional 'Irish folk' in style, so you would probably want their later ones, such as : "Magical Ring" ; "Macalla".<br>  <br>  And maybe Mediaeval Baebes : "Salva Nos" ; "Worldes Blysse"|`|T5DbLLgQaa	Vangelis is great! Try also Jean-Michel Jarre, Klaus Schulze, Mike Oldfield and Kitaro for example! Also, check out these: Eri Sugai, Libera, David Arkenstone, Ludovico Einaudi, Adiemus, Clannad, Sissel, Hayley Westenra.|`|IkLzsqNVaa	Don't forget about Karl Jenkins/Adiemus.<br>  <br>  Or I also like Cusco, though I'm not sure it's the category of music you have in mind. <br>  <br>  See source references for song examples.|`|pLPKo6mBaa	Well I guess it depends on what side you're looking for. Aeoliah is great for meditation but for simple listening, you might get bored with it easily. I suggest Bill Douglas (try "Angelico"), Angels of Venice (try "Luna Mystica"), and for something a bit "heavier", try Lesi?m (my favorite song by them is "Fundamentum").

It has the Brooke Shields appeal, and can be easily pruned, trimmed or otherwise taken care of.<br>  I have had a moustache for 30 years, and have only taken it off twice in all that time. The rash that breaks out, and the rough burlap feeling on the upper lip is simply not worth it. <br>  Kissing a woman, who would give me moustache bristle burn, would be gross. A full moustache is much softer, and even tickles a lady's body, when lovemaking.<br>  Bristle does not.<br>  There was a woman in a tank unit next to mine in (W.) Germany many years ago, and the guys used to call her "Gorilla Woman". She was evidently also a body builder, so she actually could do her job with track maintenance, but damn....she was UGLY!|`|fvPoiaAXaa	unibrow i guess. its a little less manlier than moustache. both are highly repulsive.

NC67WVlEaa	The "Paul's Dead" conspiracy. Some people think that Paul McCartney died in '64 and was replaced with a look-alike.<br>  Also, some think that Meg White of The White Stripes died in a car crash and Jack White replaced her with a robot. (A bit far fetched, if you ask me.)<br>  Oh, and that the government was supposedly after John Lennon and that's the reason he was killed.<br>  <br>  EDIT: And in addition to the Kurt Cobain ordeal, some claim he's still alive and he and Courtney faked his death. I think not.<br>  <br>  EDIT AGAIN!: Jeez, I keep forgetting things. I thought I'd mention the "subliminal messages" that people claim to find in songs when played backwards. Most people know of the "Stairway To Heaven Is Satanic!" conspiracy and you can find almost every Nirvana song on youtube, played backwards, with subtitles explaining the socalled "message". If you play a certain White Stripes song backwards, (I forget exactly wich one) you can hear what sounds like, "Meg is dead and I replaced her with a robot" but, it sounds more like, "Cranberry sauce".|`|Catsy82Caa	there is a bunch of stuff going around that music and musical instruments were meant to be played and tuned at 432 hz instead of 440 hz and that 440 was just something made up by nazis or something...it's crazy look it up|`|OrAk4Fpoaa	- Elvis′s death<br>  - subliminal/hidden messages in many songs such as Stairway to Heaven<br>  - the endless critics to rock and metal and it being the cause for many suicide ex: trial vs. Judas Priest...|`|LkN5nr6faa	Sid and Nancy|`|0NpR26jfaa	I've heard about Charles Manson, uhhhhh, he thought that there were messages in "The Beatles" songs to tell people to rise up and destroy people who don't belive or something. <br>  <br>  I've also heard that the song "Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds" was created to get more people hooked on LSD. Take a look at the captalized letters,..... thats the way it's supposed to be spelled.<br>  <br>  Now I hate this one, people say that "s tair way to Heaven" is a Sataic song. You just need to listen to it back wards.|`|jheoB3Ftaa	How about that one "Roller Coaster" song that supposedly has the scream of someone's death in the studio integrated into the song. <br>  <br>  Although its fake|`|gx7s1M5gaa	the brown note lol<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_note" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_note</a>|`|f948d748facdf196074d849ea9c465c4aa	Some people think Elliott Smith war murdered.

u0ljcg7jaa	What he is wanting to do is to have control of everything that goes on around your home, finances mainly. This is a fear that he has that once you start making money, you will leave him.

This isn't an unusual case. Then there is also the matter of him maybe thinking you're going to meet other people especially men at this job and that might give him a sense of insecurity. If you really want a job i think you should communicate this to him and cite some really good reasons, obviously i dont know what those might be. But remember you only live once, and if you want to feel like you're doing something with your life and also want to feel that sense of achievement that he does when he works then you should express that to him, i don't see why he would deny you that.|`|jajmF5Uvaa	He wants you to make babies and cook for him. Scared you going to become to independent.|`|AA11370204	Maybe he's having a mental breakdown!|`|7eEFKDrOaa	Sweetie, its because he doesn't want you to be his equal when it comes to making money, He is afraid of you making your own way.

I wish you well dear.<br>  V....V|`|bNRUjnGZaa	You don't want to get me started.

V9uMoELzaa	It means you can do better. Sometimes your too high or too low. Try recording yourself when you sing and listening to it. You should also breathe from your mouth instead of nose. Its hard, but it makes you sound MUCH better|`|vUuD9YExaa	If someone says you singing pitch is all over the place then that means its not to good (no offense). The kind of pitch you want is a nice steady one that stays with the song. You can start to fix it by parcticing singing with songs that have no high pitches.|`|H659yRKAaa	its not a good thing, it might mean you are "tone-deaf" which has nothing to do with your ears. It just means that you can't hold a pitch. try getting an automatic guitar tuner that plays and recognizes notes. play a note off of the tuner, then sing it back to it and it will show you if you are off. it will have little lights that show you if you are sharp (too high) or flat (too low). hold the note until it is right! keep practicing!!!|`|KnCcEfBpaa	It's when Randy Jackson says " I don't know, it was pitchy for me" which is not good. Fix pitch problems (some ways)<br>  1. Sit at the piano and practice singing scales, hold the notes to make sure you are on pitch<br>  2. proper breathing goes a LONG way to fixing pitch problems<br>  3. get a few refresher lessons with a vocal coach, they can usually correct any errors in posture and breathing right away.

Many people turn to comfort food for familiarity, emotional security, or as a special reward. The reasons a dish becomes comfort food are diverse but often include pleasant associations of childhood[1]. Small children often seem to latch on to a specific food or drink (in a way similar to a security blanket) and will repeatedly request it in high stress situations.[citation needed] Adults eat comfort food for a sense of continuity.[citation needed]<br>  <br>  The term "comfort food" was added to the Webster's Dictionary in 1972.<br>  <br>  [edit] Types of comfort foods<br>  <br>  Various foods or snacks could fill the urge for a comfort food depending on a person's taste, but in any given culture or cuisine there are foods that become universally accepted comfort foods.<br>  <br>  Comfort food has always been the staple of diners and other informal restaurants, as well as home cooking. Traditionally, there has been an emphasis on authenticity and low cost. One recent development, however, as chefs have explored the roots of American cuisine and tried to define it as a unique style, is the advent of fine dining comfort food restaurants that feature more careful cooking and presentation, higher quality and fresh organic ingredients, and consequently, higher prices.[2]<br>  <br>  [edit] United States<br>  <br>  Favorite home-made comfort foods in the US include macaroni & cheese, mashed potatoes (or twice-baked potato), applesauce, fried chicken, pizza, peanut butter, ice cream, and bacon, eggs, and hash browns for breakfast. Many creative mixes of foods have emerged, but probably would be too individualized to be considered authentically accepted comfort foods.<br>  <br>  [edit] Canada<br>  <br>  Comfort food in Canada has many similarities with comfort food in the United States. However, distinctively Canadian comfort food exists. These include poutine, which originated in the province of Quebec and is considered a distinctive part of Québécois cuisine, as well as beaver tails in eastern Canada. The former consists of french fries with cheese curds and gravy, while the latter is a Canadian equivalent of fried dough. Kraft Dinner, tourtière and mashed potatoes are popular comfort foods in Canada.<br>  <br>  <br>  [edit] Japan<br>  <br>  Japan has many types of comfort food, typically simple, hearty, inexpensive dishes like miso soup, ramen, onigiri, or Japanese curry.[3]<br>  <br>  [edit] Philippines<br>  <br>  Filipino comfort food is synonymous with home-cooked meals. It is also associated with street food such as balut, isaw, mani, mais, chocolate, and the ubiquitous ice cream.<br>  <br>  [edit] United Kingdom<br>  <br>  In the UK, the term "nursery food" has a similar meaning, although it also refers to food given to young children. It may refer to childhood favorites that are still enjoyed in adulthood, such as boiled eggs and soldiers (the soldiers being buttered toast cut into strips and dipped into the egg yolk). Traditional dishes that are often considered comfort foods in the United Kingdom include stews - especially in northern England, and "bangers and mash" (sausages and mashed potatoes). Rich steamed puddings, made from flour and suet and with considerable quantities of added sugar and spice, are also popularly considered to fall into this category.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Stuffed animal<br>  From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia<br>  Jump to: navigation, search<br>  This article is about toy animals.

For other uses, see Plush (disambiguation).<br>  Duck stuffed animals<br>  Soft toys are not necessarily animal shaped.<br>  Some stuffed animals have names that come with the product, while others, such as Zurlain, above, are named by their owners.<br>  <br>  A stuffed animal is toy animal sewn from cloth, plush, or other textiles, and stuffed with straw, beans, plastic pellets, cotton, synthetic fibers, or other similar materials. Stuffed animals are also known as plush toys (U.S. English) from plush, the outer material used, and soft toys or cuddly toys (British English). They are made in many different forms, some resembling real animals, some in a caricature with emphasis on different features, some in the form of Legendary creatures or Cartoon characters.<br>  <br>  Some stuffed animals are very old – home made cloth dolls stuffed with straw go back to at least the 1830s, perhaps much older. The most well known type of stuffed toy is likely the teddy bear. They are often used as comfort objects.<br>  Contents<br>  [hide]<br>  <br>      * 1 History<br>      * 2 Today<br>      * 3 Current brands<br>      * 4 See also<br>  <br>  [edit] History<br>  <br>  Stuffed animals in the past were used for random stuffing of the evacuated skins of hunted animals.

With his dummy on his knee, he starts going through his usual act including his repertoire of dumb blonde jokes.<br>  <br>  Suddenly a blonde woman in the middle of the crowd stands up and starts shouting at the stage.<br>  <br>  “I’ve heard enough of your stupid blonde jokes. What makes you think you can stereotype women that way?”<br>  <br>  “What does the colour of a person’s hair have to do with her worth as a human being?”<br>  <br>  “It’s men like you that keep women like me from being respected at work and in the community and from reaching our full potential as a person. Because you and men like you continue to perpetuate discrimination against not only blondes, but women in general, and all in the name of humour!”<br>  <br>  The embarrassed ventriloquist starts to stutter an apology when the blonde yells, “You stay out of this, mister! I’m talking to that little **** on your knee.”|`|KXHM5BgWaa	A blonde was recently hired at an office. Her first task was to go out for<br>  coffee. Eager to do well her first day on the job, she grabbed a large thermos and hurried to a nearby coffee shop. <br>  She held up the thermos and the coffee shop worker quickly came over to take her order. <br>  "Is this big enough to hold six cups of coffee?" the blonde asked. <br>  The coffee shop worker looked at the thermos, hesitated a few seconds, then finally replied, "Yeah. It looks like about six cups to me." <br>  "Oh good!" the blonde sighed in relief. "I'll have two regular, two black,<br>  and two decaf."

Maybe you could clarify for me in an edit? <br>  <br>  1. Are you playing the first or the second violin part?<br>  2. Where exactly is this hard place? Can you give me exact minutes?<br>  <br>  I hear some string-crossing fast notes on the second violin part at around 1:49-1:57 and 2:10-2:20, then 3:10-3:20. If this place is the problem, then I think you should try to play just the open A string and the open E string without the notes on the left hand, but in a fast rhythm, then the open D and A strings. Practice those string crossings a few times until you are comfortable with then, then try to add you left hand.|`|jCfBVC02aa	How to play the violen there is some steps <br>  1. make sure u have a violen <br>  2. have rosin ( helps out the bow ) <br>  3. practice first with a type of playing called plucking, you put your tumb on the bridge ( where strings lay on wooden thing) then you pluck the stings <br>  4. once your ready for the bow you must get a good bow hold where your tumb is in the middle and u hold it with the index, middle, and ring fingers and pinky off the bow. <br>  5. then u should try bowing from frog ( closest part of the bow to your fingers ) to the tip ( farest from your fingers) then learn the notes from books and you'll be playing in no  time|`|sLgI3cRpaa	SURE Y NOT

You must have no work ethic at all to not add in "I'll find out" after saying "I don't know".

You went to Wal-Mart and asked for plant advice?<br>  <br>  With what they pay and what they require to work there, you were lucky the person could answer you in your own language and even knew what a plant was.<br>  <br>  That being said, you probably could have bought the plant cheaper there than anywhere else.|`|1l04qpOKaa	I had the same trouble a few weeks ago!

They are sent to a certain department whether they have any expertise in that field or not. At least the person had the decency to be honest with you, instead of actually pretending to know something about plants and giving you bad advice.|`|9IvcV7tiaa	I've noticed so many stores are like that these days.

Hence all the crappy sequals to classics.  I think they're getting back to the old ways, though.  Give it a little more time :)|`|MCTyWCu2aa	I know. Nothing is cartoons anymore. I miss lion king toy story cinderella. I like the cortoon movies. When they use real people its just not as good.|`|BLLdUrWVaa	ohhh hahaha.<br>  <br>  maybe cause kids arent into that kinda stuff anymore.<br>  <br>  sooo i guess they wanted to catch the attention of kids<br>  <br>  with more exciting, musical movies.|`|jtjISk6qaa	=[ its sad.|`|IxzJ6SN5aa	IDK. They really dumbed down their stuff in my opinon. When you do that... it stinks.|`|J6KraUzUaa	good question!|`|akcGfgdcaa	Ah, yeah I know what you mean, although I think they have been trying to do better I guess, in terms of regular movies, Enchanted was definitely one of Disney's better ones. And Wall-E was fantastic.<br>  <br>  Ratatouille and Finding Nemo were also great. But yeah, I agree it will never be as good as old skool Lion King and Aladdin.|`|kLe5pXx8aa	i agree I am looking forward to Toy Story 3<br>  <br>  Well mainly the cause is kids these days. They dont want to see the classic Disney stuff anymore. At all. They want to see things like HSM and Hannah Montana. Its the age now that kids want to grow up faster, and I dont like that.|`|RQdFRaANaa	Some people have argue Michael Eisner drove the company downhill.|`|LWmstMGkaa	In all of the Disney movies,(cartoons) one are both of the parents are dead. It is mostly the mom who dies or is dead. So happy THAT!!!|`|6098ebd9c2c175997bc815b09ad17e01aa	nothing is magical anymore and it is us to blame. you cant blame disney because whatever they put out we buy into it. its like brainwashing (anything on tv)|`|bE1XFBfraa	I believe it is in a transition stage right now. They are switching to the new graphic movies with their acquisition of Pixar.|`|duIQeYWOaa	Jafar goes to the optometrist 2|`|v7ZmPEwOaa	disney is too grown now. all the shows have teenagers making out and crap...young whipper snapper are a modern reflection of todays youth. sign of the times!|`|8agCewImaa	I blame Miley Cyrus (aka HANNAH MONTANA)|`|YKSF6aoraa	what! Wall-E just won an academy award...<br>  Disney is the best!|`|DeQY98MYaa	i kno i feel u...i used to love disney channel but there lettin me down|`|yj3GT7jOaa	I'll go out on a limb here since I don't watch the musicals.  There would seem to be a low overhead, ease of production, wide audience and huge profit in such productions.  The animated classics are difficult and time consuming.  When the animation comes out, people have forgotten about it by the time sequel is out unless huge amount of advertising is invested.  The cost of production and advertising alone would be more restrictive guiding the production concerning animation.  And then the big question that I'm not sure of, where have all the good animators gone?|`|Bbn1ZSTcaa	I totally agree with you. High School musical sucked,they break into song every 5 seconds.<br>  I love all of the disney classics.<br>  Walt disney would never think of High School musical and that is a good thing.|`|tqfkHiEQaa	Disney didn't change... your outlook on life did. Now that you're older you realize there is no magic in the world and that life is hard. Sorry but the vail has been lifted. Good luck.|`|fk7ZA9b8aa	the fact that there is going to be a toy story there is already a letdown, its just for money.|`|bOgvUEzvaa	No kidding, so disappointing :(|`|osoTq2dcaa	I know exactly what your saying, im going to disneyland in may. I hope that hasn't changed too

Cant wait to see them with Slayer and Cannibal Corpse this summer!   My fave jam is Inner Sanctum\m/!
Ew7hXGFtaa	I LOVE Eluveitie!!!! =D They are one of my favorite bands!!!<br>  <br>  MQ: I don't know what I love so much about them but I just do haha. I love all the metal aspects of it that get really heavy and I love how they tie the folk into it too. So I guess you could say its both for me too.<br>  <br>  MQ2: "Your Gaulish War" I remember I saw it as a favorited video on Roxels youtube account actually. I saw the pic of them and just had to check it out!<br>  <br>  BQ: Slania is my favorite album (I actually listened to that whole album earlier today). And my favorite song, right now, is probably "The Somber Lay"<br>  <br>  <br>  Oh, and I can't wait to see them in a few months!!! :D|`|pLPKo6mBaa	MA: They're good and fun musically, I just can't take the vocals in most of the songs, not my kinda stuff. =/<br>  <br>  MA2: Some song that started off with a really pretty keyboard intro, and I was all "Awww" and then it went to RAWWWRRR and I had to turn it off, lol.<br>  <br>  BA: I don't have a favorite album but I like the song "Slania's Song" because it has some clean female vocals in it. :P|`|UnsZKr4saa	I think it's the fact that they combine two of my favourite Metal subgenres ; Melodic Death Metal and Folk Metal.  Their songs are fun and catchy, like a lot of Folk Metal, but it also has a deeper side as well.  <br>  <br>  MQ: Yep.<br>  <br>  MQ2: Inis Mona as well.  <br>  <br>  BQ: "Spirit" and "Your Gaulish War".

Also, there are many institutions that you can contact such as Scott Trade and talk to a broker directly and get his advice as well........I do deal with brokers, but on a limited basis.|`|547Ln6rNaa	Yes I think this is in the wrong place for any great answers (no offense anyone) but good luck with your future career.|`|M5Sw5SWfaa	Unless you want stupid answers, go to the education section. I don't know your school so nobody would really know what classes are available in your school~|`|CWZR9ipFaa	ask this elsewhere|`|6oASoFr7aa	Idk, but i felt like a stock broker ripped me off once. I invested in crude oil back in 2001, when crude oil was like $23 a barrel. and I put $6500.00 in it. even though it went down to $21 dollars a barrel,  he convinced me to put another $2500.00 in it.  It was a call and i'm assuming since you want to be a stock broker , you know what a call is, so you know they expire. anyway crude oil dropped to like $18 a barrel and stayed underneath $23 a barrel all the way up to the expiration of my call. Another stock broker told me that if i would've just taken that extra $2500 and invested in a put (i'm sure you know what that is) than i would've broken a little bit above even with my $6500.00 call, been able to keep my commodity and would've have made atleast $150,000.00 by the time my first call expired, because the price of oil shot way up right after the beginning of the war. Anyway it's not too many things in life I'm fu**ck'd up about, but that's definetly one of them. Whatever you do look out for clients if you dealing with commodities, make sure if they have a big call, they back it up with a small put and vice versa. You got the right idea, stock brokering is where the money is. Those people are leeches.

MIZgSLxAaa	o i like wat that girl sed not the ne bout having a weird momma lol. ye some stuff most r true of wat she sed. uhmmm ye idk virgos have a neatness problem ROFL nd uhm like to be alone ndddddd hold on lemme search it on google rofl <br>  One thing you need to know about a Virgo woman - she has guts and lots of them! It doesn't mean that she is not as shy and as reserved as she seems to be. It's just that she can do anything and everything for the people she loves. By love, she mean real love, no other type of love exists for her. A Virgo female is a complete woman! She has all the charms and tricks that any other female has, but she is not weak. Infact, she has quite a determination and can do anything if she sets her mind to it. <br>  werddddd to thatt niggggga<br>  She is very sensitive and her feelings are pretty fragile, but she will become exceedingly strong when you need her support. With kids, she will be very considerate and you will never see them running around in their underclothes. She will gentle, but firm and will demand complete discipline from them. Even though a Virgo woman is very critical, she will not take criticism very nicely. It never works the other way round for her<br>  this shiznips is enough yo <br>  time for some math hw <br>  roflmaoo|`|GTr4kX7raa	Hi there!<br>  I've experienced a lot with Virgos:)<br>  They're VERY emotional, practical, critical, kind, loyal to others, can be shy, hard-workers,... and so on..<br>  Virgo's can be very emotional and sensitive, due to cruelness but they can also criticize people in ways and not realize others have feelings too :)<br>  That's one of the things Virgo Sun have.<br>  But it mostly also depends on all the signs such as moon, rising, venus, and etc in the chart.<br>  They are very friendly when it comes to friendships and love to have fun.<br>  They are passionate in relationships and very fun to be with :)<br>  Since they are a EARTH SIGN, they are best with their other Earth Homies, Capricorn and Taurus lol.<br>  But they are good with WATER AND AIR too.<br>  Water such as Scorpio, Cancer and Pisces.<br>  And not the worst, yet pretty good with Air signs such as Gemini, Libra, and Aquarius...<br>  They can be also good with Leo and Sagittarius.<br>  BUT most Virgos should stay away from Aries!<br>  Aries are too aggressive and boring for a Virgo.|`|8VKRcJmYaa	There very critical of themselves and others even if they dont always speak it<br>  <br>  They have a tendency to feel like a martyr<br>  <br>  They are really good listeners and reliable friends<br>  <br>  Tend to get in private moods and need alone time more often but usually really good in social situations<br>  <br>  Usually like domestic animals and good food, kinda picky eaters<br>  <br>  Usually good home decorators and have good problem solving skills<br>  <br>  Virgos are good with Taurus, Scorpio and Pisces from what Ive seen<br>  My mamas a virgo also|`|glK5ZCayaa	ok sure, my mom is a virgo and i love her so much shes very nice very friendly and uses people for information and then kiss their (oops i cant cursee in here sorry) ^.^ shes very weird though my momma, she has problems very emotional as a virgo.|`|fIxzUq5laa	I am not a Virgo but have a Virgo guy friend who is an absolute weirdo in a nice way. He is very closed off, not very emotional at least not in public or in front of anyone. He comes across as honest however, I have caught him in a lie several times- just little white lies. He acts all confused but is actually really smart. He is very well spoken and polite, however he can come across as a jerk if provoked. I guess the point I am trying to make is that the sign is only a very small indication of what a person is. It has to do more with their upbringing and the values and morals the parents have taught him.
675240e4767a78efb825e156326f38d1aa	Lol yes I checked on Youtube.  It definitely has similarities to unchained melody which was the song used in the film Ghost.  Although it's also not exactly the same melody but perhaps they were inspired by it?  Or was it a coincidence?

DRu98adJaa	hmm, well I've seen the drama version of it (^^) <br>  <br>  I think its really interesting, how akiyama is able to use his brain towards such things, and how he is able to manipulate people! I find it positively amazing ! Death Note?...well, in terms that they both require the viewer to think, and the characters really know how to use their brains they are alike. Deathnote is more.. death-scary and Liar game is more... Money-scary.|`|AA11991193	I just like the whole "trying to guess" your opponent's behavior.

9BbV2xqIaa	meaning like, you adopt a kid who isn't of the same race as you are?<br>  <br>  I think it can be good if you adopt someone from a country where the children are treated horribly in orphanages. you just may be saving the child from abuse or child labour, hunger, poverty, poor living conditions, disease, etc.<br>  <br>  also, it makes the child grow up around different races just in the home. this will automatically breed a tolerant mind in the child, which is of course very good.<br>  <br>  personally (and I know at the age of 18 that I'm not having a biological child), if I were to adopt, I would not really consider race or gender to be a factor (although in some countries male children are preferentially adopted, leaving girls without homes, so then I would adopt a girl for that reason).<br>  <br>  living in North America, while the orphanages here I'm sure really suck, they're probably infinitely worse in other countries. so it'd make sense to adopt a kid out of a country that has worse conditions. doesn't matter if the child is of a different race.<br>  <br>  bottom line: so long as there is love for the child from the person who adopted him/her, it doesn't matter in the least what race the 2 parties are.|`|UYCvwh6Paa	If someone is adopting a baby from a Third World country where the children are starving and dying, and giving those children a loving home, how could there be anything bad about that?<br>  <br>  It gives childless couples the opportunity to raise children and it gets children out of a potentially dangerous situation.|`|547Ln6rNaa	They usually try to avoid it here and place children with people that are of the same race. <br>  <br>  I think it must be pretty confusing to grow up with people who don't look the same as you, teenagers are hard work anyway, adopted teenagers who say "you're not my real mom!" (no, she left you in a box on the road side, I loved you and brought you up all these years) when they are angry are even more trying, and a black teenager living with white parents probably feels more mismatched then the rest as they very well may have a different cultural that they are missing out on too.|`|h8x4EgO6aa	First of all ALL adoption is good providing that the adopting parents will treat their child well. Race shouldn't be an issue in adoption.|`|WVVdf4ILaa	It mixes cultures and prevents racism around the person who adopted the kid|`|M0mmIH9jaa	it  not|`|WpGROxH8aa	the kids grow up learning that people who look different can still love each other :)|`|G4wDlSh7aa	race shouldn't matter.<br>  if you love and care for someone it should be about whats on the inside.<br>  :)|`|6Uohf1h1aa	because then you won't grow up predjudice...|`|J4lfOSPiaa	Most people know that I have said that I could not have children when I was first married, but my husband and I desperately dreamed of a house full of children.  I feel God cut us both some slack because we were both M.D.'s/Surgeons so we went to put in adoption for any child in an orphanage or other circumstance needing adoption. We were elated when we got a call to go an orphanage in Russia where there was a young man of 4y/o who had been abandoned by his single mother. Now if anyone on this web tells you that they pass these children out like crackers they are fat out liars. You go through so much paper work and so many lawyers, and then the individual governments that it is ridiculous so that a child may have a home.  Many people also think Surgeons are millionaires and there is a perception like it or not that many in other countries believe that all Americans are rich - if I heard it once I heard it many times coming from other governments who said that we lived in the land of 'milk and honey' so the inference that we had it all was a given.  We tried to adopt children in American orphanages but were constantly on a merry-go-round when one day changed our life.  We were at the home of 2 other friends in medicine who said they had someone they wanted us to meet.  We were so excited because this couple had also been trying to have children but could not!  We thought we would see an ultrasound  picture of a surprise baby on the way!  We were sitting on the patio when our friends proudly introduced Akeem a darling 5y/o child from India.  We felt like we had been hooked to electrical current because we were so excited at the prospect of maybe our being allowed to get on a list before our death!  Sorry, gallows humor!  Anyway we spent the most wonderful day with Akeem and we sucked up all the information we could on how they got the adoptoion pushed through!  They sent us to a local group of families with transracial adoption and the rest was history.  It would be unfair to say adoption was easy, inexpensive, and at times it had the that black market feel especially when we were warned to always take lots of extra money because once the governments had you over there it would seem some problem arose that "needed extra money" to push the paperwork through.  One couple told us of a horror story of flying over to China with the paperwork, a special guide and spent 1 week in a hotel in Bejing only to be told the adoption had been canceled.  They lost all the one thing they desired so badly that the woman came home and had a nervous breakdown.  They had been trying for years to conceive a child by artificial insemination.  They had attempted this 6x at $45,000 per time =$270,000 to have a child of their own so not getting the little girl promised was worse than could ever have imagined.  They took very little extra cash along and when the Chinese government wanted more money, they simply did not have the amount they wanted. So to be forewarned is to be forearmed - we got our call to pick up Alexei and my husband managed to wear a money belt for just such a circumstance which by the way once we were in Russia we faced somewhat similar circumstances to the family trying to adopt the Chinese young girl.  I will never forget the shy but quiet way that Alexei approached me because I sat on the floor of the orphanage so I would not tower over him. We exchanged smiles and he came over to feel my long black hair and then I swear by the angels this darling kissed me on the cheek.  My husband knowing that I was about to become 'Niagara Falls' bent over to pick him up and it was an instant take.  I excused myself to turn around and wipe my tears, but love in any language straight from the heart, what can I say?!  Alexei was the child that was 4 y/o and then we were blessed with no older than 1 or 2 y/o not that age was important we kind of liked the idea of naming them after my deceased mother who loved children and passed it on to me. I had the good fortune to marry a tower of strenght and best friend.  He has always made a wonderful Father for the children. I would never want to pass this way again under any circumstances because I got the dream.  I eventually had 3 children from my own womb but I proudly tell you my family is as close knit as a family can be in this whole country. Please adopt because every child needs a loving home and we felt a Christian one.  Here are the names of all my children - they all have A starting names because as I said they are named after my mother Annie in the <br>  A tradition - there is not one I love more than the other and when we are separated by college and life.  My eldest son Alexei is an M.D. taking after his neurosurgeon Father.  He is married with 2 children with his wife, Amy!   Love always my angels and my grandbabys too<br>  Alexie - Russian-B, Aaliyah-Arab-G, Ashanti-<br>  African-G, Adam-B-, Antonio-Spanish-B, Andrew-B, Akira-Japanese-G, Andreas-Greek-B, & Annie-G <br>  The source below is a quote-Albert Schweitzer|`|3mJiPveSaa	Same reasons as any other adoption.

5yaNeOcSaa	I use sidereal measurements, so i would take everything back 17 degrees.  Sun would be in Canceer.  Very emotional and sesitive.  Moon would still be Aquarius.  You are a natural leader and not afraid to embrace new thoughts/ideas.  Mercury would be in Cancer.  You are an emotional communicator.  Asc would still be in Leo.  This means that you like to be number 1 and that you like attention.  It also means that you have lots of hair and it magnifies your face...like a lion.  You have a lot of Cancerian planets.  This make you a very emotional person.
TzHsjqcIaa	*Hmmm, now you have me wondering. My boss rubs my back, butt, and shoulders when he talks to me. I thought it was normal, but now I'm rethinking that. (And yes, I did say he)|`|qdsVS1dDaa	That is too close. Business  should stay at least an arm's length away.<br>  <br>  Regards,<br>  Dan|`|avWArdYbaa	No...until she puts her hand down your pants...then you need to start being aware of a "closeness" issue...or take it to the copy room.  Your choice|`|sVFkMVujaa	depends on what you're talking about|`|19da204b17b5b7cec2adfc4630aea4d1aa	Oh..wishful thinking again on your part!!!!<br>  <br>  Proper work etiquette is in keeping a proper "bubble zone" of propriety depending on your job and one should not be thinking of intruding or getting oneself in the "forbidden" area of improper MONKEY BUSINESS. That is,..... close enough to talk yet not to be construed as though something is going on. Sometimes you need to be close to talk privately, but to me 3-6 feet seems adequate in a teaching/educational situation (in my case) when defining a closeness in space. Also choosing a spot that is not so private so to be perceived as though you are not acting on the up and up. I've heard of some weird situations that my husband has been involved in litigating on the corporate level on this topic and it makes me agree that everyone should be on their guard when you have an office/work situation piranha in the picture.<br>  <br>  Good question BLACK SQUARE....but I do have to admit that there are people out there like this...seriously. Rule of thumb, don't find yourself in these situations if you want to keep your job. Jobs are hard to come by and many stand in the wings  looking for your job and are ready to take it on to support themselves in this hard economy.<br>  <br>  WOW...you really got me going on this one!!!<br>  <br>  Take care BLACK SQUARE!!!

AA11640951	I think it may be more of a "secret societies" thing we've not been shown the full scope of yet.  There's various groups who can time travel, and may be manipulating the course of the world.  The actual battle may be just Ben, Widmore, or whoever, but their petty struggles have an effect on those around them.  <br>  <br>  I'm wondering if the reason the Six have to go back is because they've already had an effect an the past.  For example, Locke has meet Widmore, but only because he was there when the island started shifting.  If the Six aren't there during the shifts, does that mean history will take a different course?|`|TFhf5skNaa	as with everything on this show, they are vague for a reason.  I love the mystery of the island, and constantly ponder it's meaning.   the war could be between the different groups trying to control the island, or the fate of the island could trigger a war between nations.  maybe it is just between Ben and Charles.<br>  if the island is where the "butterfly effect" starts from, then restoring balance there would 'save' the rest of the world, kinda like the 108 minute button to save the world. <br>  the only thing i know for certain, is that i know nothing for certain.  the writers of the show have promised to answer most of the mysteries of the show by the finale, but not all.|`|DUg1IkTIaa	The only "war" that I could imagine in the TV Series "LOST" would be a "war" between us and some kind of extraterrestrial.

Du8QhOmaaa	What i find attractive in women.<br>  Here is a list and why(Most important first):<br>  Smile- It is very attractive when a girl has a beautiful white smile. I take care of my teeth and i really like women who do as well.<br>  Balanced personality- I think it is attractive when a woman knows how to have a good time, laugh and goof off, but they need to have a serious side.<br>  athleticism- I think athletic women are attractive. You don't have to be athletic though. I just like women that are thinner. Not too thin though. I'm just not looking for a beached whale. Just be healthy<br>  Outgoing- You have to be willing to go out and do stuff and try new things.<br>  Eyes- beautiful eyes are always attractive.<br>  Dress- Dress well and take care of yourself.<br>  <br>  Honestly i don't think breast size matters. I like them all. lol but seriously forget any thoughts that your breasts are not good enough.<br>  Be open and fun to be around.<br>  Have self confidence<br>  One thing that really annoys me is when a women is very attractive physically, but can not hold a decent conversation or is very uneducated.<br>  <br>  I hoped this helped. I kinda just rambled.|`|MVViKeYeaa	Face|`|MzSFaebraa	Face.|`|O4KQx5Ldaa	It's all good...<br>  <br>  but the final destination is your "special place" between your legs...|`|bW6NpTXdaa	a great smile, a sexy voice, and intelligence|`|ogYrGjYuaa	Face,abs,and then the butt ./////|`|x7CmpR6baa	Face fo sho

4zscfvvoaa	I have a friend that majored in sound engineering.  He now works making books on tape in a studio.  He records and masters bands on the side using the studio though.  It is a cool gig for him.<br>  <br>  I have another friend that majored in musical theory with a background in business.  He is now working in the music industry as a sales representative for a label.<br>  <br>  I have other friends that have focused on musical theory and production.  Most of them are in bands or operas.  They had loads of talent, but haven't made the mainstream.<br>  <br>  If you want an everlasting career in music, obtain a business degree as well.  Profit from music comes from making it a business.<br>  <br>  If you play music and love music with all your heart, focus on theory.  You may not make it in the big times, but you will always be around it.  There is always a community band, or a teaching job.  There is always a need for musical minds.  The industry of music is a business though, so learn business if you want to be in the industry.
UHGQI2p8aa	lmao <br>  probably|`|c8TXAAj1aa	Nope, it would be the opposite. Ballroom dancing encourages order, routine, grace, poise, respect. People need to learn those skills, a high school is a great place to learn!|`|13hDE66Oaa	No, as a matter of fact I think many would enjoy it.  Exercise is important and dance is a perfect way to exercise.  Plus, dancers have the best bodies.|`|So00Bd5zaa	Ballroom dancing is fun.

A school class would really help those who want to learn the art of dance w/out the money cost.|`|bankzwwYaa	Actually... quite the opposite...<br>  <br>  <br>  They'd figure out they could get up close and personal with a young lady.... and we'd all be off to the races...|`|e7410cdd309fbe8be4f14fa845e27703aa	Yes.

Rx6p8Cvfaa	i'm just here to say, i adored your confidence!!!|`|AA10838250	with some there is no line|`|nqlk9iUCaa	It all Depends on where That Lines Starts..|`|GdBUmFFCaa	I know plenty of "Confident" people and they are most humble, sure of themselves without pushing their believes and ways to others; and that's what "Arrogant" people do.<br>  Arrogant people "assumes" he/she is self-important, that his/her self-worth should be overbearing, pushing to everyone that "self-importance". But see? It is just "self-impossed". Arrogance Is Never included in a Job Title or in Any Position in the world.<br>  Confident people are those that make a mark in the world, a path for all of us to follow and succeed. Such examples of great confidence are Abraham Lincoln, "Bobby" Kennedy, Dr. King, and the great Amadeus Mozart, a most humble man, born a genius, and after so very many years, we still hear of him, listen to him, read about him, and make our lives warmer and worth it when his name is pronounced...|`|09e9e668bf34764b457b9ea98c39eb5daa	No I do not think so. Why your may ask?  Because arrogance is that I don't care what others think I will have my way whereas confidence is that quality that blends humility and caring in knowing you are the best you can be and proud of it and willing to listen to others.|`|0d48efb9bb3ec04d1446c03dc1edcde3aa	Of course, just like the thin line between sexiness and skankiness... I never cross that line, I stay on the sexy side.. *walks away swaying hips*..LOL<br>  <br>  Confidence is sexy, arrogance is not!<br>  <br>  Cheers =)|`|u86NV1Enaa	Arrogant people "Lacks" of Confidence and sef-worth, so they push their ways onto others.

I know I already feel *more* like crap than usual in the winter, when there's little sun, lots of rain, ice and snow, and no good reason to look up.  o_o<br>  <br>  In other words, I'd have problems in a space station where looking up only gives you a view of a *ceiling* and not a sky.  ^__^  That's what I thought you'd ask about.  That would be the worst-case scenario right there--even someone with fused vertebrae from a neck injury can still look straight ahead and see a horizon (which implies a sky).<br>  <br>  But yeah, I think it would make *my* life a lot worse.

THE TOASTY WRAP.... I gotta have one! Then just as I was picking up the phone Rich Uncle Pennybags (You know.... The Monopoly Man) walked in my tent and slapped me in the face with a bag of macaroni... I then lunged at him but he's to quick.

I hate to see repetitive questions like those.|`|UepGEiR9aa	anime would definitely fall under the comics and animation category, since it's ANIMATION. so i really don't think it needs its own category.<br>  <br>  now twilight? those twilight fan-girls need their own category...|`|ybjj5WIhaa	Yeah! It deserves a category all by itself. But it also makes it easier for trolls to do their work. BUt then again.... they are always around. As fir Twilight getting it's own section, it's not gonna work. Harry Potter fans did make a request to Y!A requesting a Harry Potter section but alas.... I guess because it was too specific. I think if enough people appeal, we might get a Manga/Anime section|`|4qVWj3UHaa	*raises hand*  I DOOOOOOOOOOOOO|`|kBek6QCLaa	this pretty much is it's own anime section..so ...no|`|YHu0TUxdaa	I believe so too. It probably wouldn't happen for the people that run the site will say just keep. It here. BUt it would be nice. Every once in a while a Person who reads comic will have some smart @ss remark about anime being here, and to shut him the h*ll up i gladly move.<br>  <br>  And yes no twilight questions would be F-ing amazing|`|CQX3TAIoaa	What part of Comics&Animation don't you understand? haha, kidding<br>  Besides, a majority the people who watch anime don't know what it is. They just think its a cartoon. <br>  Now a manga section, that'd be nice. But again, it's not worth it.<br>  EDIT: I agree. Twilight does need its own section.|`|XQMm3Ahraa	yeah thenfor sure we wouldn't get those bliddy twighlight questions where they don't belong and we would have a utopia<br>  <br>  <br>  FOOT NOTE: I also agree with blackwing there would be a huge troll flood that we would need to develop a coding system or just block everyone who puts a bad comment|`|Yw1zIYK6aa	Ttoottaallyyyy<br>  Dr. Dog<br>  ADD: yes, deffinatley, Black Winged Assasin.

5a328dcc94efb65565b23591fae9787caa	All of his CD's are great!  Gemini is a nice one.   "From here to there" is great!  Its has one of my favorite songs on it, "Anytime". Its like a Best of Brian Mcknight CD.  But if I had to pick just one, it would be <br>  "I remember you" CD.<br>  <br>  I have been admiring him and his music for years.  He is one of the best R&B artist out there.  So many idol wannabes have tried to emulate him. Singers like him, and Luther Vandross are hard to copy, there voices are so unique.  Anthony Hamilton is another artist that is well on his way.  I love his music as well.

eokH64z0aa	While it sounds like your still undecided [but, I won't lie, you sound like your leaning more towards doing it]. I probably wouldn't. You care about your girlfriend, as you said, and if you do decide to do the photo shoot it will not only seemingly look like your choosing your sister-in-law's sister over your girlfriend but also that you have complete disregard for your girlfriends feelings. Her response of "it's fine" usually means, "it's not fine and if you do this, yes, I'll get over it, but I'll never let you live it down, so technically, I won't be over it". <br>  <br>  I can understand you wanting to help your sister-in-law's sister, but honestly, you care about your girlfriend, and you may like [as a friend] the sister, but what is worth more to you? Making your sister-in-law's sister happy, or keeping your girlfriend happy?<br>  <br>  In the long run, we can all offer you advice, and hope you listen to what you know is right, but in honesty it all comes down to what you think. You know your girlfriend better than anyone here. Yes, you'll be helping a friend out, but it's most likely not worth the betrayal your girlfriend will most likely feel. <br>  <br>  Good luck though Dylan. It's a tough situation to be in, and I hope everything works out for you.|`|cFktUueyaa	I say do it. You have a friend that's in need and you sound like you are okay with it. Your girlfriend will get over it, i promise.|`|oDL02s8kaa	maybe you should let your girlfriend see you naked first then do the shoot. and then invite said girlfriend to come with you to the shoot!<br>  <br>  (just giving my personal opinion!!)|`|U1LknLaWaa	Man up and do it. She said she will get over it so let her get over it.|`|IPpOd2wmaa	Yes...although its kinda creepy and aren't you kinda young|`|KAkiPY3kaa	Talk to your girlfriend about it more.... tell her its art and not a tryout for the Chippendale's. I have posed naked as well, but you are never shown completely naked. There's always a prop in the form of a blanket, towel, etc. If she still has a major problem with it, then you will just have to weigh in her thoughts and respect her decision. She is your girlfriend after all and if you guys are seriously commited then sacrifices have to be made every once in a while.|`|eAarsjjMaa	It sounds like she doesn't want you to do it. To be honest, I would feel the same in her position, but in the end it's up to you. If it's only the class that would see you, and she's kind of counting on you, then it might be worth doing it. If I was you I would talk to your girlfriend properly before doing it, and say that you don't want to do it if she's not 100% happy with it. Then see how it goes I guess.|`|xreWOKBYaa	If your girlfriend will get upset (even if she says she won't) then don't do it.<br>  I can tell you what she really ment, because i too am a women, she ment "i am going to act like i don't care to see if he will still choose not to do it, because that is what i really want but don't want to sound like a controling gf"<br>  Why not find a friend who is willing to do it to help your sister-in-law?|`|9EmR4cWBaa	i think ur gf doesnt like that dont do it plz that is very bad thing if ur sister in laws sister want anybody y u r worried and ur naked body must only be seen by ur gf thats going to be ur wife in the future plz dont do it for god sake|`|DYBh8bo8aa	u should go for it ! if u are pretty and want to model then nothing and nobody should stop uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!...|`|Zy5AkW1kaa	Don't do it if you're girlfriend will be more upset than she says.<br>  <br>  It would probably help out your sister-in-law's sister though.<br>  <br>  Do what you think would be best for both people, and yourself.|`|85S7YRQdaa	Whip it out on your girlfriend that way she will have seen it before your sister-in-law which is really gross.|`|MIKn9HyOaa	Yeah you totally should.<br>  It's good you respect your girlfriends enough to ask for her permission.<br>  But I think you should do iut. It would be fuhn (:|`|b1b6e3d33b1a99da35a245dd5c6cae76aa	If your girlfriend is upset with it then dint do it, you sound kind of Young to do it anyways.|`|T0r5hofiaa	How would ou feel if your gf was posing nude for a bunch of dudes and you hadnt seen her naked?|`|RLoilwCNaa	This is one of those opportunities in life that you will regret passing up. Don't live with regret. It's art! You'll be glad you did it.|`|TCcalWKWaa	no, ur gone crazy|`|PN7XMglOaa	Don't do it . You will only shame yourself|`|pvvNuOXlaa	I don't believe that a nude model who is paid, would be any different than you nude and unpaid... something doesn't ring true here.  Good luck.|`|RNpaBwxzaa	I don't feel like reading all that. I'm just answering this because you asked us for help in a more recent question...|`|0b749584c35f2d85b042fb4c77b72f79aa	If you are really loking forward to the experience of the photoshoot, then talk to your gf about how and why you really wanna do it And then do it if she approves.. But if you have no personal interest in the shoot and are feeling embarassed, too, and your gf's upset about it, then I think you shouldnt do it.|`|sn7bbROnaa	If you'd like to. but just be careful, those pictures may end up on the internet, it happened to my best friend Carrie, who posed nude for a friend for a "photography" class, but it was a male friend, who just wanted to see her body for enjoyment, and than he posted them on his MySpace and FaceBook and said it was his sexy p*rnstar/model girlfriend. And he also told everyone that afterwards, they had sex. so i would be careful. do it if you please, but if you don't feel comfy with doing this than DONT!<br>  *xo* Lindsey<3<br>  I'm back, bitchez!|`|tLVZXLRSaa	If you feel comfortable with it, I think you should do it. I don't think your girlfriend is mad at you or anything, I think she's just confused about what to feel. But I don't understand why she said she'll be over it. Get over what? It's not like something will happen between you and your sister in law. But she probably just feels a little uncomfortable but I'm sure she wouldn't break up with you over something lke this. It will probably blow over after you've done the photoshoot. But ask her if she's sure she's okay with it. Because if you do it and she gets mad at you, its not really your fault because she should've said something|`|jjMvvJrmaa	She probably wants you to do what you want, but she also doesnt want you to do it. I know is hard to understand.. I say dont do it. It is your choice though..|`|tkSXjqhuaa	Do it. <br>  If she breaks up with you over it, she's very petty and immature.|`|gUdlaaGwaa	I say go for it, because it's purely for professional reasons, but make sure your girlfriend is 100% okay with it. Bringing her along is a good idea if she's willing to go.|`|AA10628838	Sounds like you have already decided to do it.|`|nqlk9iUCaa	With you Dylan, I'm never sure if it's a Joke or Not, Haha|`|bankzwwYaa	The sister in law... albeit distantly.. is FAMILY...<br>  <br>  There is a BIG difference between FAMILY and a GF..<br>  <br>  Invite her along, and if she's not comfy with it... you've done all you can do...

If he asks you another time why you never responded, just tell him your phone was dead, or it was on silent and you didn't get it until way later, or just deny you ever got the text.  Phones sometimes do that, and then delete the text and show him you never got it|`|hpKJP2Ciaa	Tell him that you have a lot of home work to do,<br>  or you do not feel good,<br>  or do not answer and say that you were sleep.|`|KtSjN7vcaa	I would tell him that you are doing something "with the family" or "with a friend."

I think that Jacob is really John Locke's real father.   I think the island is a UFO disguised to look like an island.  Obviously the island has healing powers and someone on the island even has the power to bring back the dead like the entities in the Q Continuum on the Star Trek series.|`|ibiO4VEQaa	personally, I think Richard is the Smoke Monster in a human form, that's why he never ages.<br>  But he might be "undead" like Locke and Christian, so that's why he never ages.|`|667fbb3f5754a94cb0e93724d53755a5aa	I think the island has some "special" powers or a fountain of youth, one or the other.

Usagi is only good with herbs and making medicine, she can’t even do the basic things all ninjas know and everyone knows that. The only thing is she wants to be a ninja so she can go on missions and leave the small village she has always lived in. One day Usagi’s great grandfather (the leader of the village) tells her that he has an assignment that only she can do, “marry Hanzo Hattori and bare his children”. Usagi along with Mamezo (a child she has raised from a young age) go to Segachi, the place Hanzo lives at. Hanzo instantly rejects Usagi the moment he finds out why she came, but she doesn’t leave and he is made her ninja instructor by… Her grandfather? With love on the horizon, enemies almost around every corner, a strict teacher, and her ex-fiancé Goemon around all the time, will she be able to do such a treacherous life-long task?<br>  <br>  Tokyo Crazy Paradise<br>  After the death of her parents, Tsukasa turns to her classmate Ryuji, a yakuza boss, for shelter and a job. Ryuji is generally grave, but purposefully indebts Tsukasa to him so that she has to keep working for him, and he can keep his friend near him. Tsukasa is a simple-minded girl who desperately searches for money to pay off her debts to Ryuji. To make money, she takes on suspicious jobs in addition to being Ryuji's bodyguard, but always ends up in trouble. Ryuji and Tsukasa take turns saving each other as they fight together against the spread of dangerous drugs and weaponry that would destroy Tokyo even more than it has already degraded.<br>  <br>  Love Monster<br>  After failing her high school entrance exam, Hiyo Osora becomes desperate; so when she receives an acceptance letter from the prestigious SM Academy it is like a godsend.

Mikan misses her friend so much that she runs away to Tokyo to find the mysterious Alice Academy. However, once there, Mikan discovers that it is actually a secret school for children with special abilities. Alice Academy is filled with boys and girls who can do anything from make crazy inventions to control fire. In order to stay with her friend, Mikan tries to enter the Academy, but there's a catch: she doesn't have any special powers! Now Mikan must prove herself to her classmates in order to stay by Hotaru's side.<br>  <br>  Ayashi no Ceres<br>  There is a legend of an angel who fell to Earth many years ago, and was forced to marry a man because he held the key to her only way home.

To pay back the damages, she is forced to work for the club, & there she discovers just how wealthy the boys are & how different the people at that school is compared to every one els that she is usually around.<br>  <br>  Rave Master<br>  The Continent of Song is in chaos. The sinister secret society known as Demon Card is using the power of Dark Bring to destroy everything in their path. The only things capable of stopping Dark Bring are the Rave stones. Unfortunately, the Rave Stones were scattered around the globe in an explosion 50 years ago, so now they must be collected by the Rave Master in order to stop Dark Bring once and for all. This new task has been given to Haru Glory; a sixteen-year-old boy from Garage Island. The World's fate now rests on the new, young Rave Master.<br>  <br>  Kare Kano (aka: Kareshi Kanojou)<br>  Yukino had it all. Brilliant, athletic, popular and pretty, she was the perfect school girl with many friends and admirers. But then one fateful day she met her match: a handsome young man named Arima. Now, not only is he beating her at her own game, she's becoming more and more dismayed to learn that she's developing her first real feelings of romance. Can Yukino maintain her model student appearance, or will love ruin all her plans?<br>  <br>  Loveless<br>  Ritsuka Aoyagi's psyche is in dire straits; his mother is insane, his brother Seimei has been killed, and over the past few years he's seemed to become a different person. When the enigmatic Soubi Agatsuma arrives, claiming to have information about Seimei's death, Ritsuka is determined to uncover the truth. Soon, however, he is caught up in a web of darkness and spell battles, all the while searching for the reason behind his own personality change. Wary and defensive, Ritsuka is unnerved by his relationship with Soubi, as well as the tentative friendships offered to him by his classmates. But the world of spell battles, fighter units and sacrifices is an ugly place; and Ritsuka, in the middle of it all, finds himself having to choose who to trust.<br>  <br>  Backstage Prince<br>  Akari has no interest in Kabuki Theatre, but suddenly she finds herself as the assistant of seventeen-year-old Ryusei Horiuchi, a famous young kabuki actor.

Akari and Ryusei's relationship is difficult at the beginning, but eventually the two find themselves falling in love. What challenges will Akari and Ryusei face as they try to maintain their relationship against all odds?<br>  <br>  Beast Master<br>  Yuiko loves animals, but given the overly-aggressive way she tries to show her love for them, they always run away. One day Yuiko meets a strange boy named Leo who seems to be more beast than human; his fierce eyes frighten everyone away, and he harbors a dark secret: when he's threatened or sees blood, Leo loses control and behaves like a wild animal. Can Yuiko tame this wild beast, or will he run just like all the other animals she loves?|`|SpFGzKPbaa	Ultra Maniac - I LOVE these books! There's 6 and it's about a teenage witch (who's really bad at magic) who comes to a human high school. Contains romance and it is SO cute!!! seriously, I really recommend reading this!!<br>  <br>  Vampire Knight - This is kinda gory in places (not really, but just a warning in case you don't like that kind of stuff) but it's a really good story. It's amazing as an anime as well. I think the anime is actually better than the manga because it's more dramatic but the books are awesome too! Contains romance, action and it is so DAMN GOOD!! seriously, watch/buy this!! <3 <br>  <br>  Fruits basket - I LOVE THIS!!!!! Reeeeally cute! Tohru is the cutest, most innocent character ever! Lots of adorable romance! ^ ^<br>  <br>  I.O.N - This is really cute! It's just a one off, not a series but I definitely recomend this! About a girl who finds she has natural physcic powers. She falls for this boy but is worried he sees her only as a physcic and not as a girl.... really cute read! ^ ^<br>  <br>  The gentlemens alliance - Haven't actually read this but I've heard great reviews on it. I've heard it's REALLY good! =]<br>  <br>  I recommend looking here, there's a really good list of books to read:<br>  <a href="http://www.shojobeat.com/manga/sb_vols.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.shojobeat.com/manga/sb_vols.p...</a>|`|QWhrxorIaa	Karin is good <a href="http://www.onemanga.com/Karin/" rel="nofollow">http://www.onemanga.com/Karin/</a>|`|7JU4ssEtaa	Suzuka<br>  Kimi no Iru Machi<br>  Vampire Knight

I can't even describe the awesome zaniness. I would assess that many manga are cheesy and overly done, but Urusei Yatsura, from a guy who hates cheesy and stupid things, thinks it's good.<br>  <br>  Number 2: School Rumble. I like the whole thing, it has great characters and I especially like Kenji. :D<br>  <br>  Ranma 1/2... Love Hina... <br>  <br>  There's tons. I would assert that everything I suggested is not primarily a romance manga, but romance is an element instead. I don't like most mangas with romance as a focal point... the characters tend to look... ambiguously gendered... mostly the males.<br>  <br>  @.@|`|1lkxpqAIaa	Red River<br>  Fruits Basket<br>  Full Moon<br>  Fushigi Yuugi

Even though the FX were good, but the movie for me kind of sucked.

R5I5Znlmaa	Jack Nicholson because he's done much more variety of roles than Denzel Washington. I also think he's brilliant in One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest, The Shining, A Few Good Men, About Schmidt, and As Good as it Gets.|`|Klb4ZYcVaa	Jack N. has proven what a real actor can be. Aside from his personal problems, the guy's a f*cking legend. Denzel isn't as close to how many Oscars this dude has received for years. In fact, he should've been honoring the nominees at the Oscars last week, alongside with Robert DeNiro. I think Al Pacino & Dustin Hoffman should've been up there too.|`|jcL7gDMKaa	Jack Nicholson for sure! his acting in The Shining was brilliant! HEEEERRREE'S JOHNNNNNYYYY!!!! haha|`|bwygouP8aa	As much as I like Jack all the way back to his "Five Easy Pieces" and Easy Rider days, Denzel is a more diversified actor.<br>  <br>  Sorry Jack, maybe it was Mars Attacks that changed my mind.|`|ZVwqmfDEaa	jack nicholson hands down is a better actor i don't really like denzel washington  as a actor i think he sucks...|`|9CN0otoQaa	Jack.|`|zovrJ0yXaa	jack nicholson is a legend for a reason. denzel hasnt given a performance equal to one flew over the cuckoos nest, five easy pieces, and especially chinatown. even jacks lesser roles are memorable, like the joker. jack hands down|`|TVLlkYUiaa	Jack Nicholson is way much better actor than Denzel Washington ever thought of being.

If I last, then that means I'm worthy of being liked by them - not because I'm a nice person, but because I let them humiliate me.  Even though I'm "in," I'll still get talked about behind my back.  If I do something "wrong," I can get kicked out and lose all my "friends."  AND I get to PAY for this privilege.

As long as it's a hardbody electric, you can play metal... the sound will come from the effects you run it through for the most part, and your playing style.  Eventually, you will afford a guitar you really dig.

How does that make you feel.|`|mBXu5G5saa	Immigration, i believe our new president, (Obama) should pass a law/bill to give illegal people their citizenship only if they have never been in trouble with the law, never been in jail or gotten a ticket or things such, going to school and/or work and have been here for at least five years, and came here legally meaning, with a passport and visa, not the other illegal ways like crossing borders, Some people discriminate,and think that oh because someone was not born in the U.S, they automatically think and assume that they do not need to be here and they are criminals, this is never the case, there are people who come here to better themselves because they family cannot afford to help them with school or give them money to live a successful life, so they come to America with good intentions and they struggle alot but they do not have their citizenship so they really cannot get anything done.. but those Americans (most of them) who DO have theirs, they waste their time, doing drugs, smoking, getting into all kinds of trouble, dropping out of school,.. when there are people who would die or do anything to be a citizen because they are hard-working and dedicated!

AA11615501	I think she is a lovely girl.  I dont care for one note of her music, but her music isnt for a guy like me.  I think she has a lot to offer the world, even when she doesnt do what is popular.  It would be nice if she pulled herself out of the trenches and back on to the stage where she seems to be the happiest.  Did you ever notice how miserable people look when they are photographed at clubs and bars or getting arrested?|`|NQ3eETlYaa	I think she rocks!!

In general, March men|`|jcL7gDMKaa	I would say Scorpio, but I am one and I hate Cancers, far too emotional and clingy!! ugh|`|AA10197672	Caner is a match made in heaven with Scorpio! The passion these two insanely signs share once in love is incredible! Both are water sign, both are very sensitive and passionate, loving, caring. Both are very loyal and care about family and care about one another. They are a great team together and will be very successful in life. Scorpio makes Cancer feel like home and makes him feel comfotable to come out of his shell. Scorpio provides a great deal in emotional security for Cancer and assures him that he can trust her.

She told him she wanted to private time with him, after no much time he left the party because he had to catch a flight to Japan. But today I saw on e news that paris just arrived to Japan as well. So she is after than man but I dont think he is intrested at all. He has said many times that he likes talented girls. And well she has NO talent. And she saw seen getting to Japan with a new boyfriend. this guy names Doug . . .|`|GOSMZMpwaa	ROBERT PATTINSON IS HIDEOUS! HIS FACE IS SO UGLY OMG I WANT TO SHOOT MY SELF IN THE FACE!!!!

cOUvCZCraa	I was sooo furious. Hosea did nothing throughout the whole competition except say.."I'm the seafood guy.." <br>  <br>  I cannot believe he even made it to the finale, let alone that he won. It should have been, Stefan, Fabio, and either Carla or Leah. Stefan should have won. So he was arrogant, but guess what, this is not a personality contest here! He makes the best food, and won the most challenges. He deserved it, if your basing it on that.|`|04f66f1c66b0524d97b2f5defbc9979daa	I was disappointed that Carla didn't win she was my hopeful then Hosea. I always skip dessert even if it's free!<br>  Stefan not only was cocky they said his meal had hi's & lows but Hosea's was consistently the same even without dessert.|`|5QFuenebaa	I was surprised both Hosea and Leah made it so far into the competition. That said, I think the quality of this season's chefs were not on par with past seasons. <br>  <br>  Couldn't stand Stefan because of his arrogance, and I was sad to see Jamie, Fabio and Jeff go. I agree they didn't pick Stefan because he was cocky, and would rather have seen Carla or Jamie, Fabio or Jeff win on an emotional level, but the bottom line is it's a cooking show and the best chef should win despite my feelings. I guess you can't pimp out somebody as a winner that nobody likes!<br>  <br>  Finally, I eat desert may 3x a year, so I wouldn't expect it but my daughter would - even after breakfast! lol

And who has Aaron right now? maybe Claire?<br>    I think it would be sad for Kate to give up Aaron, but I don't think she would begrudge Claire's claim. Kate only took him because Claire wanted her to.|`|El4XqmVZaa	Charlie died.  Claire "disappeared." Aaron "disappeared" as well.  It has been stated that Claire will not appear in this season or will appear very little.  But there is a good chance that mother and son will be reunited in the final season.|`|ba52jQHyaa	If Locke gets to come back to life everyone should|`|ibiO4VEQaa	Charlie's gone, but I think there will definitely be a big Claire and Aaron reunion in the last season.<br>  As well as a big moral conflict between Kate and Claire over him.<br>  I would LOVE it is Claire whooped Kate!|`|JxUFDutxaa	With this show..you never can tell..<br>  Maybe they'll all walk off with Jacob into the sunset or something.<br>  <br>  Oh how I love this crazy confusing show.|`|8Kwwgtvlaa	Yes maybe Claire and Aaron will be together before series end...thus bringing true Desmond's vision of seeing Claire and Arron being rescued by the helicopter. Fraid Charlie is a goner BUT I would not be surprised seeing all the former dead Losties alive and well at the end of the show.|`|DUg1IkTIaa	No, I don't see Charlie coming back to life.  Claire might be one of the survivors that gets off the island towards the end of the Series, but I don't see much of a story line for her, Aaron, or Charlie.  They need to start "writing off" some of the characters.|`|ZVwqmfDEaa	for charlie he is gone  he died i don't think he is coming back.<br>  <br>  and for clair if she is alive she's  going to have a rough time convinceing  kate to giving up aaron.. she raised that lil boy  kate is the only mom he knows|`|57f6ab92048e820f90e75894de592233aa	The only way they'll all be together is if Aaron dies.
YAoSgET5aa	two Pisces do not work out together, i will read you something form one of my astrology books.<br>  <br>  Pisces & Pisces: If all of life's problems could be resolved in the bedroom they'd be happy, but both need what the other does not have. Each is a weak-willed, dependent, and drains the other emotionally. Both have a tendency to sink into a mire of self-pity and negativity, and they accentuate each other's confusion, self-indulgence, and muddled thinking. They find it hard to cope with practical realities, and there's no strong partner around to push either one in the right direction. This sexy affair has no place to go.<br>  <br>  Sorry to say honey, I don't think that he will be coming back. Both of you need someone to lean on and two Pisces just constantly drain each other emotionally. Its better to let things go and look for a new boyfriend. Some of Pisces' best matches are Scorpio, and Capricorn.|`|Eg1G2mvVaa	I don't think star signs have any bearing on this one.  It is over!  You need to leave him alone now, he has made it quite clear that he is no longer interested.|`|4769b530e02572d6a0c84645a6d398cfaa	i think he is done with you, and the reason why he has flimsy excuses is because he doesn't want to tell you the entire truth and risk hurting your feelings. he does care about you a lot, but he may need some space. pisceans dont really express themselves verbally and tend to keep some feelings inside, so there's a big chance he's not telling you everything; again, this is so he won't hurt you. i think you're thinking about this a little too hard. he may reappear, maybe to be friends or fulfill some emptiness he may have. dont be surprised if you hook up one day but he still doesn't want a real relationship. i dont think he finds you to be what he wants...usually pisces & pisces relationships dont work because pisces needs a more dominant, practical partner.|`|bvwYVGJOaa	Pisces are also too clingy which has lead this relationship all the way to the end. I feel you should move on as he's simply won't come back.<br>  you deserve a guy who would give you the confidence and stability in relationship.<br>  <br>  Don't waste time thinking "will he come back? does he miss me"? You need to be real with yourself and look at the reality. It would take time but you'll heal and be more stronger than before.|`|1PdUecpYaa	he was actually being honest to you when he said he couldn't do this anymore. he wanted it to end. when he came back to you, he really missed you... some pisces have a hard time letting go. <br>  don't call him or do anything. try to live your life like normal and just wait if he comes back, then great.. if not.. don't feel too bad|`|nmC7qgtZaa	hmm well i went back an paid my ex who cheated on me money I owed her before moving on, your only shot is to let him and dont contact him for as long as it takes he'll probably be thinking about you non stop and if theres any chance for ye's it'll be him who contacts ye|`|8VKRcJmYaa	most likely yes he will
YwtXSUAdaa	Lol at Firesign. He's right. I hate when people say that music sucks just because they are too lazy to look for anything.<br>  <br>  Layne makes a good point, but is wrong about one thing. The earliest post-grunge bands were not corporate, they were formed under their own terms and everything it's just that they weren't so extreme in their anti-establishment beliefs. Bush was by no means a corporate band.<br>  <br>  However, a few years later the corporate labels did begin to pick up on it and started to create post-grunge bands for money and profit.... and so came bands like Nickelback.|`|cUjcn2lsaa	It's unfortunate, right? Mainstream rock is so mediocre these days. But if you look past the mainstream, there are some great bands out there. You just can't rely on the radio for new music.<br>  <br>  90s is my favorite decade, and over half of my Top 10 bands were popular during that decade. However, I listen to music from the 60s up until now. <br>  Oh, and to the person who said that the questioner is 'stuck in the 90s': What's wrong with that? Just because he/she is a fan of it doesn't mean he's STUCK in it!<br>  <br>  <br>  Just so you know: Alice in Chains, Stone Temple Pilots, and Pearl Jam will be releasing new albums this year. And Chris Cornell is releasing his new solo record next month. You might want to check them out.<br>  <br>  Layne Staley: I HATE HATE HATE Chris's solo ****. I just thought that maybe the asker might want to listen to it. That's all.<br>  Chris may be my favorite musician, but his solo crap is total ******* ****.|`|DbtS5jzEaa	it doesn't...<br>  <br>  look at <br>  <br>  Opeth<br>  Underoath<br>  Machinemade God<br>  Scar Symmetry<br>  Soilwork<br>  <br>  it's all there|`|f948d748facdf196074d849ea9c465c4aa	Lily FYI Chris Cornell sounds like justin timberlake now. Please for your own good do not check out his new cd. I did and i am psychologically damaged and am no longer able to enjoy soundgarden/temple of the dog to the fullest potential.<br>  <br>  Anyway here is my theory<br>  <br>  basically the grunge bands had minds of their own, they made fun of mtv,they wore shirts that said "corporate magazines still suck" to rolling stone photo shoots,they made fun of the interviewers,they sued ticketmaster,they mocked themselves for being on major label, they tried to create follow up albums that were less radio friendly. While that is great for music fans who enjoy their sense of humor and anti corporate attitudes it was not good for the people who control the media. Bands like Nirvana and Pearl Jam became hard to market because they had minds of their own. So they created "safer" alternatives like Bush and Candlebox, that they know would never challenge the big corporations. These post "grunge" bands began to get worse and worse, eventually leading to horrible bands like Creed and Nickelback. When people stooped listening to most post "grunge" the media created pop radio friendly versions of other genres, such as metal (nu metal) and Punk (pop rock)|`|rFBypeEfaa	Because you quit doing research and looking for albums, got lazy, and only paid attention to the radio?|`|zZPbmxWkaa	Firesign is right. There are a lot of great bands out there, you just have to look for them.|`|HBST5Rlxaa	It's all about MARKETING. It takes no talent anymore. Perfect example: Paris Hilton. How many albums do you think she sold? And why? It's marketing. Who's hot, has the look, the appeal to the targeted audience. It's marketing and money. Plain and simple. Why do you think the music business is crap now? They're reaping what they sow. It doesn't take talent, it takes a fad. I'm confident that 90% of the bands around today, on your top 40 radio or hard rock stations, won't be around or popular in 2 years. I'm sure record deals are probably half of what they used to be. I'm not in the biz or claim to be an expert, but I believe some bands used to get those big, lucrative 5 or 6 album deals. I'd put money on it that most bands don't get anything more than 2 or 3 nowadays, because that's all they're expected to last. They get this "great" record deal offer for 2 or 3 albums and they take it, thus furthering the cycle of awful music we are fed on the radio. Satellite radio is where it's at. Expand your horizons. I have.|`|KSFMUnlbaa	well rock an metal today is much heavyer and you must been growing up in the 90s so u are use to grungey rock thrash metal and speed and all but metal now is like slipknot,lamb of god, and all that u know music does not suck it is changed and you are not use to it!|`|Rd1FLoCbaa	all i ever listen to is metallica, godsmack, pearl jam, the offspring, nirvana, system of a down, smashing pumpkins, sublime if it wasnt for the 90s i would be screwed|`|PMUa4sgaaa	Depends on what you hear and read about... try some online radio stations like RTDS (Radio That Doesn't Suck) for music that you wouldn't get / hear on everyday radio or even see on MTV 2 or Scuzz.|`|kC3VwbfRaa	not true!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br>  <br>  did you hear some new albums that came out lets say in 2008? i am NOT EVEN talking 2000s here...go buy The Way Of ALL Flesh by Gojira and tell me it sucks.

5f0111f71db8592710a5d1cb4897be4aaa	I'm thinking.... Crazy Cane thinks the baby is his because he watched it grow in Crazy Chloe's belly ( and the occasional tap on the big belly ) If Cane had a ounce of dignity...he would walk away from this mess and let Billy be the daddy SO he can be proven right that Billy would make a crappy daddy !<br>   I haven't trusted Cane since he was behind the bar making Harvey-Wallbangers > <br>   You are so correct with all the Crazies running around Genoa City > I'm thinking that someone put something in their water supply and has turned the residents NUTS.  <br>   Jack always finds a way to get what he wants, as far as the company coming back into his hands ???? I have no clue <br>  <br>   You ask when does it all fall apart ,,,, I'm thinking when the viewers tune out ! It's always going to be the Young & Restless ...( even IF their not so young any more )|`|gW0nD5cEaa	In defense of Cane, he spent months thinking, despite the fact he could not remember being with CHloe, that the baby was his. I'm sure that is something that is hard to let go of. Even though he and Chloe did not have a 'real' marriage, he still thought of it as his baby. He had acted like an expectant father. <br>  <br>  I never really watched soaps until I started watching Y&R some days a few months ago. But I thought crazy characters and characters with amnesia (Katherine, Sharon to some extent) were normal. <br>  <br>  As for Jack, Gloria, etc. I leave it to the writers. They obviously are smarter than I am, or at least make a whole lot more money.|`|AA11111233	Sweeps month will be next month instead of this month.  Expect the building to come crashing down then, and Sharon will indeed melt like the Wicked Witch of the West.|`|lGdzb8aqaa	what is really going to happen to Victor,Jack, and any one else who has any thing to do with Jabot they will all lose what ever they got from the will or bought Mrs C. still owns Jabot and she is not dead.. Cane has no chance for any type of custody, as he can't prove Chloe is unfit as she is only a liar, there are no men available for Jill and she told Jeffery she would respect him in the morning meaning he was a booty call only, they need to quit bringing all these young people to the show and get the older woman a life too.I hope they keep Murphy for Kay,<br>  Despite Michael and Lauren's advice, Gloria still wants Jeffrey. She goes to his suite where she finds Jill. Gloria gets into a catfight w/ Jill over Jeffrey then realizes he isn't worth it and walks out leaving Jill who stays w/ Jeffrey <br>  Karen finally confronts Neil over his kiss w/ Tyra, she tells him if he wants to be w/ her [Karen] then he needs to get his act together or their marraige is over! <br>  Cane tells Lily he plans to divorce Chloe and have joint custody of Delia, he wants Lily to raise Delia w/ him and proposes to her while Billy does the same w/ Chloe, he tells her he wants to be a part of Delia's life and asks that Chloe marry him! <br>  Katherine gets Annie on her side, together they try to escape but it's too late. Roger arrives w/ Esther behind him (she followed him there). Esther slaps Roger pissed to know he's been holding Mrs. C hostage, and even more shocked when Clint walks in saying no one is going no where! <br>  <br>  Next - Katherine is held hostage again; Kevin's w/ Amber and Murphy he reads back the note supposedly left by Katherine and notices the beginning letters of the sentences spell Clint!; Ashley threatens Victor saying she'll take herself and her daughter and leave, that Victor will lose them|`|RIRRITy8aa	I totally agree with the part about Cane. The baby has not even left the hospital yet and he is convinced that this child is his. If he lived with the child for a few month, then maybe I would buy it but this instant connection business is not flying.<br>  <br>  And Jill sucks as a parent, showing her blatant favoritism to Cane by not discouraging him from this insane endeavor of his|`|Kx3I4RC7aa	Yeah Cane is crazy, I used to like him but not any more all he douse is wine about every thing. In a weird way it makes me like Chloe more. Sharon is just as crazy! What the hell is up with her? Jill I wish she would take Billy's side once and awhile. Cane started the fight but Billy is the one that has to leave.|`|fkEnKjK0aa	i agree what part of the baby is not yours does he not understand.ester is so clueless chloe i don't know what to say about her,Jill needs to mind her buisness sometimes,and i think nick needs to leave sharon alone.To me Y&R is getting good.|`|r7sgshwKaa	I think all the storylines are going to hell on that show. Maybe the writers are dropping acid or something.|`|AA10906922	I wish they would come up with a good story line. The soaps have become so boring. It's the same old thing over and over. Give us something interesting.|`|ab2a840460fbbeb0af2b8c4445d4667baa	what that show needs is a good shrink...and no, not Taylor from B and B...|`|4kuWOZowaa	Dude these story lines got me seeing stars right now..and cane done went nuts!|`|EPPb5pRBaa	yeah, & don't forget Sharon she has loss her mind.|`|uUzbqGh5aa	Dumb Cane and Dumber Chloe should go to court and the kid should stay with the mother and Billy should see another skirt pass by and go after it leaving Chloe with Noone!|`|a7590c3c5bac6d04d5fbb3e0c50319baaa	You know, never thought about it, but ya know, they are all crazy.

NQnOw4Qbaa	First off is your guitar properly set up?  This is something a luthier or an instrument tech needs to look at but a quick and dirty check goes like this:  Install a capo at the fifth fret and try to slip a bank note, or paper of similar thickness, between the string and the first fret.  If the paper passes freely in the gap between the string and the fret your "nut" needs to be filed or shaved as it is holding your strings too high off the fingerboard.  Next move the capo between the "nut" and the first fret and hold down the first string between  the twelfth and thirteeenth frets.  Try passing the paper between the fifth fret and the string:  If it passes freely the neck might have too mucn bow, if the paper will not pass through the neck is too straight.  Repeat this check with the sixth string.  If the results are much different than with the first string that indicates a twisted neck, a major problem.<br>  <br>  I have never used Epiphone brand strings but I imagine they are goo because Gibson is unlikely to put out a substandard product with their brand name on it.  The brand of strings does not have to match the brand of guitar.  I've used Ernie Ball brand strings for a long time.<br>  <br>  Before buying the strings have a guitar tech or a machinist mic the first string you have on your guitar so you have an idea what you are starting with.  .012" is medium heavy.<br>  <br>  Going to lighter guage strings on acoustics can result in string buzz.  Be prepared to experiment until you find a combo that you and your guitar will be happy with.<br>  <br>  My bet is that the nut came from the factory not fully trimmed and this needs to be done.  This is a common practice, sort of like a musical equivalent of pants that are sold off the rack but still have to have the cuffs measured and seen.|`|aQcsrgLCaa	People have personal preferences for their guitars as different strings have different properties that can either exploit or defeat the natural resonance of the guitar. For interest I use Newtone strings that are 15s, but then, I use  resonator guitars.<br>  <br>  I have generally found that the thinner the strings, the more they hurt the fingers. But there again old strings can also hurt the fingers. Thinner strings will tend to give a thinner and lighter sound to the guitar. Eventually your finger ends will firm up and you will be able to play without the pain. If you already have hardened finger ends, where are you getting the pain? I have a tad of arthritis but I don't get any more pain than usual when I play guitar.<br>  <br>  When a person refers to a set of strings being 12, they are referring to the thickness of the 1st string. The bigger the number, the thicker the string. Most of my musical colleagues use 12s and they are made from a mix of phosphor bronze.<br>  <br>  I guess Epiphone strings are O.K. but I've never used them. Try them and see how they are. You can always try some others and compare them to the strings you have now and the Epiphone strings.<br>  <br>  It would also be a good idea to get someone who knows a bit about guitars to have a look at yours to make sure that it is set up correctly.|`|aOuRlpAPaa	not too good with gages...<br>  <br>  but generally i've found that the thicker the strings the more it's going to hurt..<br>  <br>  as for strings working on the guitar..of course, all strings (guitar ones of course) work on guitars..<br>  <br>  obviously:<br>  <br>  strings designed for electric guitars are not meant to be used for acoustic ones...<br>  <br>  best example...a spanish classical guitar should never have steel strings like those found on acoustic guitars, because it just wouldn't take the tension<br>  <br>  <br>  hope that helped ;)
xMnN99T8aa	Get a teaching book or take a lesson|`|JQZzI49Paa	you have to have something to wrap around the strings. Like in Oasis- Wonderwall. it is in F#. Put a barre over the strings|`|zmab07Giaa	a barre chord is a chord where you use your pointer finger as a barre.|`|17ixPSQQaa	A barre chord is when you lay your index finer across the neck right behind the fret and use your other fingers to form an Emajor or minor ( the most common barre chords) the trick is to get every string to ring out clearly. This will be tough at first and probably painful but keep practicing and it will come with time.|`|paV2LdR9aa	a barre chord is simply when you use your index finger to 'barre' on a fret (i.e hold down all strings on a single fret with your index), and make the chord shape with your other three fingers. If that makes sense.

aaqKW3pRaa	Apparently, this new discovery is based on some 1986 work done by the famous mathematician Joseph Keller. He argued that the only fair way to toss a coin is to toss it so vigorously that it spins perfectly around the horizontal axis in the center. Since it’s impossible to throw it with such precision, every other toss becomes biased — because the coin spins around a tilted axis. The end result is a coin will land on the same face it started on 51 per cent of the time. You’d need to flip a coin 10,000 times before you noticed this bias, mind you, so for all human purposes a coin-flip is still 50/50.<br>  <br>  Though if anyone ever tries to do a coin-flip by spinning the coin on its edge on a table, watch out:<br>  <br>  This slight bias pales when compared with that of spinning a coin on its edge. A spinning penny will land as tails about 80 percent of the time, Diaconis says, because the extra material on the head side shifts the center of mass slightly.<br>  <br>  This also makes me wonder: If the problem with a coin-toss is that humans cannot achieve perfect spin, what about robots? Maybe we could make a robot to do perfect coin tosses with genuine 50/50 distribution. Oh, hell — there’s probably already a robot somewhere in Japan designed specifically for that purpose.|`|7RziqsDcaa	Well, there's always the chance it will land on its side, so I don't know.|`|3ME7sBxjaa	It's closer to 70-30, and you can influence it by the way you flip it.  With a little practice you can make it turn up to the side of your choosing.|`|AA10565295	How you flip it and if you catch it or let it drop.<br>  <br>  The theoretical probability is 1/2, yes. But the experimental can be anything that it comes out to being.|`|jIufI9Zaaa	It depends on  the starting position of the coin before you flip it. The chance is more 51-49, dependig on how the coin is flipped|`|xlxZV0Xsaa	yes. 1/2 is one of two sides you will land on any side of the quarter.|`|DXvsemWtaa	yes|`|Y2AK1Ysvaa	Technical yes its a 50-50 chance.<br>  <br>  Also, a little heads up, flipping a coin to decide weather to go out with someone or not is one of the dumbest things I've heard of.  And don't go out with your best friend!  What happens when you two break up? You hate each other and don't have a best friend anymore is what.|`|VWgUb2Jeaa	in theory it is 50/50, but of course it will not come out that way all of the time. the height, how many rotations it takes and the gravitational pull are all factors. If you keep on doing it, it will land on the one you want at least one time.|`|fhoFrk9Yaa	The heads side is a little heavier than the tails side. <.<<br>  So it's not completely a 50-50 chance.

PumYhJSvaa	I had a huge panic attack when I went to watch Phantom Menace at the theatre for the midnight show. I didn't even get into the credits before I nearly puked on myself. The theatre was packed and everyone was loud and obnoxious. They wouldn't refund my money, but they gave me a movie pass to see the same title at a later date. <br>  <br>  So I am going to say no.|`|Oo3PC1yQaa	To answer your question, yes, you could ask for a refund. Sadly you aren't going to get one.|`|ab250551cde4aadbf54a0fea8a7b14e1aa	You CAN get a refund IF you walk out before the middle of the movie. If you watch over half the movie, the manager will not give you a refund. He or she may offer a ticket exchange to see another movie, as an alternative. Some people are fortunate enough to get a refund if they just think that the volume is too loud and approach the manager with a legit complaint--honest!|`|Klb4ZYcVaa	i dont think that's the case, you paid a ticket to view the movie, whether you liked the movie or not.

I don't think they do that on a daily basis. You can ask for a refund during the middle if you don't like the movie, but would settle for a ticket for a nother movie. I would say something like you have an emergency, or something but wouldn't say you didn't like the movie...GL|`|ELIKp5tDaa	lol i wish<br>  ive been to quite a few movies that i thought sucked... :/ <br>  it would be way too easy though,even if someone enjoyed the movie they could tell theater managers it sucked and theaters would lose tons of money|`|LZqHQTZpaa	That would be a good idea, but then theatres would lose money.<br>  But if it was that way then there wouldn't be so many bad movies out there|`|OuFhcdX9aa	bottom line no you can't.|`|GfG6wupTaa	Yes, you can ask for a refund.

Astrology is not superstition. Not even close.<br>  Astrology is a language. It exists. Like Estonian or French. It just plain<br>  exists. Like hard boiled eggs or chutney. Now, for some, languages that they<br>  do not know and are unable to read or converse in, constitute a sort of threat.<br>  When we hear friends chatting in a language that we don't know and we are<br>  present, we almost automatically imagine that they are talking about us. This<br>  is a kind of natural paranoia. We cannot understand. So we feel threatened or<br>  left out and perhaps even targeted as a victim.<br>  <br>  Astrology, like any language, does have to be learned in order to be used.<br>  That's why some people are astrologers and other have other learnèd<br>  professions such as doctors. An astrologer might tell you that your Sun in<br>  Leo means that you tend to want to be in the spotlight, but if your rising sign<br>  is Pisces, that Leo need for the spotlight might be mitigated.<br>  <br>  This sort of "diagnosis" is not unsimilar to when a Dr tells you that the lump<br>  on your arm looks like a cyst, but if the tests come out positive, it might be<br>  something more serious. He looks at the cystic physical evidence, but he<br>  also digs further to find out if it might be something more dangerous.<br>  <br>  Now the language of Astrology has been much squelched and derided by a<br>  sector of the population we refer to as "scientists" or , in any case, people<br>  who believe that science (another language) is the pathway to understanding<br>  every human ill - including mental, emotional and physical ailments - and to<br>  conquering and refining and owning whatever commodity it available to<br>  man. (Space flight for example or improved hard boiled eggs)<br>  <br>  But squelching a language doesn't always put it out of existence. And<br>  Astrology has survived the giant squelch of science and remains a means of<br>  communication between peoples and a method of both diagnosing and<br>  better understanding the human condition. Astrology is not in competition<br>  with science. It's just there alongside it the way that TV is there alongside<br>  the Internet. The two media must co-exist. They cannot afford to be at war.<br>  The Internet will win. It's bigger. And younger. TV knows that the way that<br>  Astrology knows that it must coexist with science because if there was a war<br>  between them Science would win. It's bigger. And younger.<br>  <br>  Nonetheless, there is wisdom in what it ancient. So Astrology continues to<br>  exist. Some people study it and are able to use it in their work and daily<br>  lives. Other people don't study it sufficiently to become astrologers. But they<br>  dabble and they enjoy dabbling. Other people (most people) consult<br>  astrologers. They are the clients or the patients or the consultees who come<br>  to people like me for advice and information about their astrological charts:<br>  Who am I? What should I do about my mother-in-law's interfering in my<br>  marriage? How can I get a divorce and keep my children? Why do I not have<br>  self-confidence? Where am I making my mistakes and why do I keep<br>  making them over and over again?<br>  <br>  What some skeptical people (the Science-blinded or prejudiced) don't know<br>  is that the answers to all of those questions are sitting right there in peoples'<br>  astrological charts. Moreover, just because most people don't know how to<br>  read their charts and don't speak the language or know how to interpret the<br>  letters (symbols), doesn't mean the answers are not there. They are.<br>  Astrology never lies. I have watched it tell me and my clients the truth over<br>  and over and over again, thousands of times. A client writes and asks me<br>  why she cannot seem to get a husband. She's young and beautiful and<br>  accomplished and owns her own home. Yet, she has nobody to share it with.<br>  What should she do?<br>  <br>  I find out her birth date, time and place (sometimes she sends me a photo as<br>  well) and I do her chart. First thing I note is that she is more accomplished<br>  than she let on in her query letter. I know already that she is president of her<br>  own company. But she is also an Aries with Leo rising and she was born in a<br>  Rooster year. This woman is what my mother used to call "a tough cookie"<br>  and a multitalented cookie at that!<br>  <br>  She doesn't bend easily. She is not soulful and won't listen to whining - even<br>  her own. She wants to be in the spotlight (Leo rising) and she is indeed in<br>  her own spotlight all the time.<br>  <br>  She's also a Rooster which is one of the most successfully non-flexible signs<br>  out there. Rigidity lurks in this woman's chart and has already done some<br>  dama|`|hXVpP16saa	Most Defiantly. It's a complete lie, and a complete waste of time.

ZyGyDLsDaa	Yes, Sybil, who had been a virgin, stayed with Dorian that night. His "friend" had said that he could tell what sort of girl she was if she had sex with him. Sybil was a naive girl who loved Dorian and would do anything for him, even sacrifice her virtue. Dorian then acted as if she was a "sleep-around" type of girl. So, she committed suicide from the shame of being cast aside by a man who seemed to love her. <br>  <br>  Actually, deep down, I think Dorian DID love Sybil. He keeps  the sheet music of her song and reacts strongly to reminders of her.
AA10197672	They might forgive but don’t forget. Cancer is very emotional, and is very hard for them to trust someone, have a communication and come out of their shell. It takes a lot of time and you have to be there for them to be able to come out. As in don’t be all shy, when they take the first step you take the next not one backwards or he will just leave. <br>  <br>  They are very sensitive, and aggressive. As in if you do something to hurt them, they will retrial to their shell and will just mind their own business and will wait for your apology, until then don’t expect them to even look at you.<br>  <br>  They are very loving and caring. They also expect you to show them you love and care about them. Once in love, you kind of have to keep that balance and make sure you let him know how much you love him as they are very insecure and emptional racks!<br>  <br>  Cancer with cancer might be pretty though to balance. You both have to be careful to not hurt one another or else you both will find yourselves in your shells alone for hrs! See how it goes, good luck!...|`|V20PTwMmaa	Thats so weird because Im going through a very similiar experience with a cancer male.  I must have somehow hurt him because I got a new myspace without telling him and when I sent him the friend request he outright denied it.  We have a past as pretty good friends and he even cheated on his first love with me, He knew I always liked his best friend though and i think he was jealous of that.  Anyway I think he denied my request because years have past and I have made no effort to talk to him, see him or anything.  He is probably a little hurt by that...so I am just letting him go, because after all im in a relationship with someone else now and he knows this too so he thinks its hopeless to accept my request I guess.  They are very easily hurt because I didn't even realize I was offending him.<br>  <br>  virgo female|`|8VKRcJmYaa	Not at all, I never have met one that has

t0MiDBMEaa	Neonatal Nursing if you can handle it. It can be sad at times but you will witness a lot of miracles too.  The pay is about $60,000. per year and up to $80,000. if you move on to be a Neonatal Nurse Practitioner.  <br>  <br>  Teachers are under paid and you have to deal with the parents which can be worse than the kid.|`|9g734Pjaaa	Well, I'm a little squeamish every once in a while (okay, maybe more than once in a while), so I doubt I could make it very far as a neonatal nurse. I love children, and I love the idea of teaching, so, er, I don't think I would be of very much help here. What do you think you want to do?|`|Kbgc6x5raa	with the economy how it is, jobs in the health department are the most secure and being a nurse will pay you better.|`|V95Gfiwmaa	Elementary Teacher cuz I don't know what Neonatal means.  <br>  <br>  Plus I've heard they get a good retirement fund.....w/e that means|`|G4wDlSh7aa	Neonatal Nursing.|`|haN9IMbCaa	Hooker|`|JEOWwUELaa	whichever pays better, we're in a recession.|`|f3SyOyMEaa	I've been an elementary school teacher and I would have to say that even though the neonatal nursing would be taxing not just physically, but mentally as well, it would be the better choice. You will have as much good things happen as bad (hopefully) and you would also make more money. Once you're off of work, you won't have to grade papers, or parent teacher conferences and all of the rest of the things that teachers have to deal with.|`|3f3c29287aa543056f2f47ef05dbdf6baa	Nursing, especially RN, but teacher is cool too because you get all summer off, plus weekends, holidays, spring break and winter break. I'd choose teacher, more time off. Nurses get worked to the bone.|`|hH1eNmUyaa	i think neonatal nursing would be better, but if you like working with children, you could pick elementry teacher...but also...you get payed more for nursing..sorry! i can't decide for you! i like em both!!|`|ZREbHs7Kaa	nursing being a teacher doesnt get a lot of pay and in the summer, you might have to get a summer job|`|T55YPfXUaa	Neonatal Nursing<br>  because it is better paying.|`|d0b19b6e53bf5f04f7ade24285468c28aa	Neonatal Nursing|`|dcd11iUwaa	nurse would be cool.<br>  both are good because your helping the community<br>  nurse would get better money.|`|lFzXZQQDaa	nursing.|`|b0iUaUJXaa	What do you really want to do?Think about "a day in the life of " these professions- 'Typical' day in the life of a teacher vs neonatal nurse.I know many nurses and can tell you it can be very stressful-very,very sick children,families in crisis,etc.Teachers being responsible for the child's education,also dealing with parents,lesson plans,papers,grades,difficult students,etc.Do you feel drawn to either profession? Look at amount of schooling necessary,subject matter you will be studying,cost of education may also be a factor.How much money will you be making when you are working? What is the job market like? It's not always "cute' or 'fun' working with kids-both professions offer special challenges. Give it all some careful consideration,and I hope this helped.|`|wy5SiCS2aa	Well it depends on what you like doing the best. Neonatal nurse will make LOADS more money, teachers don't make squat, but you get two to three months off every year with the summer. They both have their benefits, but I would go into nursing, health care is leading the job market in new jobs, and is one of the only careers that aren't laying people off right now.|`|AA10672842	It would depend what you were truly interested in .Both careers require updating of skills, require you to think on your feet and work under pressure,, to work as part of a team as well as independently..Neither career will be satisfying long term if you only view it as a paycheck. In both careers parents are entrusting their children in your care and they deserve your best.|`|eR2rrcJcaa	Nursing. you will get paid a lot more than an elementary school teacher. however, if u really want 2 be around kids and teach, get a job for a high school. you'll get paid about double the money and you still get 2 teach.|`|ee5d94d202c1ba2f1c1e242ec1d4ec20aa	BOTH ARE STRESSFUL AND REWARDING EMOTIONALLY...HOWEVER, THE NURSE HAS TO DEAL WITH INFANT MORTALITY...AND THE TEACHER WITH IRRATIONAL PARENTS.<br>  <br>  THE NURSE GETS PAID BETTER AND IS RESPECTED HIGHLY...WHILE THE TEACHER HAS TO STRUGGLE WITH FINANCES...<br>  <br>  OF THE TWO IF YOU CAN ADJUST TO INFANT MORTALITY I'D CHOOSE NURSING|`|WQcxODKLaa	Neonatal Nursing|`|3866f8902aa539f737e362949ec4f25baa	Nursing would pay better than teacher but Neonatal can be really hard when you deal with losing patients|`|P284Snoyaa	Nursing|`|AA11969873	elementary Teacher|`|sKTmxnx1aa	I think that neonatal nursing would be because you don't have to go through the stress of being a teacher.|`|bbHoF5jsaa	Depends on what you like to do....<br>  <br>  I would be an elementary Teacher....blood grosses me out!!  I cannot be a nurse!!|`|NFG9zF4zaa	neonatal nursing|`|Oa4QZGXSaa	neonatal nursing|`|wdLzpIAiaa	Nursing..<br>  why you ask.???<br>  because i've always wanted to be a nurse silly : )|`|7ROXROUxaa	health care is always an "in-demand" job|`|Jgehale2aa	I'd say it depends.  With being a teacher there is a lot of room to grow and get a higher career.  But obviously being a nurse your wages are much better to begin with.  But... being a teacher takes less education, which means less money, and its an easier field to get into.  And I don't know if you've taken and Early Childhood Education courses but its not as easy as some people make it out to be.  I'm an education major and I've learned things and it amazes me, you never know how many bad parents there are in the world until you really start studying a child's mind.|`|AA10197673	well i depends, if you like kids and also want more breaks, but you get a little less pay, then teacher. but if you like helping others no madder what they are, want more pay, but is willing to get less breaks, almost none, then nursing|`|K9CtTL1Daa	are you girl first of all because boys usually don't be nurses. Or elemenatry teachers either i would be nurse if i were you. you would gain more money.also again. but then againb boys can be nurses.so if i were you i would be  a nurse.|`|V3WsdeYIaa	nursing and teaching are pretty much the most popular careers right now. how boring. <br>  i think teaching.<br>  although i don't know how people can stand all those runny nosed little kids every day.|`|bY5Bjmhgaa	what ever you choose should be what you like if you like none of these think of something else rather than teaching or nursing do something you wont regret|`|EKoRHgdgaa	That is a tough one!

I've only been in a crowd before, I'm not so wild about this "arena tour" thing....<br>  Anyway, you should try to meet all time low after, I'm not a big FOB fan, but I think they're probably worth more time , because everyone will be going towards pete and such.

Im in a really nice mood right now and that's why im telling you this because i would normally be like "EWW THEY SUCK HAHA". Also you not adding extra letters to everything like most FOB fans do may have helped me.<br>  <br>  just FYI they are one of my least favorite bands now sorry about my honesty everyone.<br>  <br>  But i tried to dress all scene and i was on the balcony, most the "scene" kids were standing up and the balcony was mostly like 10 year olds instead of the like 12 year olds standing up. So maybe don't overdo it. If you are standing up don't bring anything valuable because fan girls will bump into you in hopes of getting closer to there hero pete wentz. <br>  <br>  I am totally going to regret this post later so please dont choose it as best answer and im not saying this to make you choose best answer.|`|FivqlPUCaa	Good for you!!!!!!!!!!

Ftkr9jqYaa	It is very similar to "Hello, Dolly," the well-known movie starring Barbra Streisand.  In both, you have a female protagonist who is a professional marriage arranger who finds ideal mates for eligible couples, and ends up getting married herself.<br>  <br>  I am out of time, so I would suggest reading the two synopses below, and making a comparison.
TSQxwlbraa	It might be "Let's get down" by "Bow Wow"<br>  Hope this helps

They are required to take care when inspecting personal bags, however, they can be held responsible if anything is 'damaged'.  As for your knitting, you'd need to consult an attorney for that to be sure.  The TSA has been known to be very careless and full of screeners that steal from passengers.  Don't believe me?  Look it up.  JFK had many that were arrested.  The TSA failed to check backgrounds of many screeners, many had criminal records and active arrest warrents!!  They are still neglecting to check their employees.  Good luck with your lawsuit.  I say give it a try and don't let them get away with it.  If anything, file an official complaint so something is on file for your records.  If you don't report it, then as far as theyre concerned, it never happened.  FIGHT!!|`|GZVMl494aa	i wish that was possable.  tsa just took over my field of work so i was forced into joining there ban.  my experience at the airport recently was about my laptop.  they made a big deal over my phone being velcroed to the lid.  so i popped off with well you let that old couple through with a stick i dynamite.  ohh the fun that started with his heart pills and her and sanitizer.  lol.  got my computer back and turned and ooh by the way you missed that kid with 50 knives (DVD's and CD's break in half real easy).|`|9PfEKygaaa	get over it, why did you try to bring banned materials on a flight?<br>  <br>  A couple of large needles on an airplane... in this day and age...<br>  <br>  <br>  Put on your big girl pants and get over it.|`|RQfLKOPQaa	I don't like it when people go through my stuff when I'm not watching.

Most recently it was that everyone who are on Food Stamps are lazy people who want to live off the government and not work at all<br>  <br>  I guess people forget about the thousands being laid off everyday|`|YdXhZka8aa	A majority of the homeless are veterans who have mental illness and aren't being treated.  Surely the army made sure they could read.|`|6pk6HnuSaa	People that assUme - well you know that one dont you?<br>  ?<br>  <br>  Assume NOTHING and question EVERYTHING|`|gnucbiExaa	I don't think that is an assumption|`|6173ede5e3ea0a8b44522ccd89de7fe0aa	I think the assumption comes from this:<br>  <br>  1. They are homeless because they don't have a job.<br>  2. They don't have a job because they can't fill out an application.<br>  3. They can't fill out an application because they can't read. <br>  <br>  <br>  You can get a simple studio apartment for $350/month. There are plenty of low-paying jobs that pay more than $350/month. So why are you homeless?|`|6In638rbaa	I don't make the assumption that they can't read. I do make the assumption that they are not educated.|`|ZsKrYCYCaa	I'm not even joking with this, I used to live next door to a homeless man (he lived on the sidewalk across the street) and he actually did my taxes back in 2006.|`|Hw3n0nenaa	Been there.

There is a tendency to believe that all people who are living on the streets are either mentally challenged or uneducated.<br>  <br>  Most would be surprised to learn that there exists some who have given up their material lives and are homeless by choice.<br>  <br>  Also, just because someone has fallen on difficult times doesn't mean they cannot read. Several people who become homeless do so because of drug addiction. People like to think that such an addiction could never happen to them or their family, but you don't have to be stupid to make a wrong decision. Everyone does it at some point. Yes, even the best educated among us.|`|2hMhANqDaa	cuz most arrogant people that have never payed any mind to homeless people associate the word homeless with stupid. I've talked to alot of ambitious, smart homeless people that were living on the streets of Chicago, trying to sell newspapers and other things to try and get back on their feet. <br>  <br>  They're mostly smart people that ended up in a bad situation|`|Dn8i9sIlaa	That's stupid..

02c048e10733ab7f5a7f2b2faf444d62aa	Answers have a way of getting away from us sometimes.  We really have to reign them in, like a pinto, or a wild stallion.  I had a Pinto once.  Actually, it was my brothers, but he drove me around a lot.  Then he got rear ended, twice, by a gasoline tanker.<br>  <br>  It didn’t even have the decency to explode in a giant ball of fire.<br>  <br>  Imagine my dismay when my brother was able to salvage the Pinto for some spending cash, and he didn’t even share it with me.  I mean, really, we’re brothers after all.  If you can’t share cash that should have paid for your funeral with your brother, who can you share it with?<br>  <br>  Chris Barry.  He took her out on a “Some Kind of Wonderful” date.  Of course he wasn’t a pathetic artist/mechanic with a tomboy best friend.  He was on the football team.  She was a cheerleader.  No real romantic story there, in the end they had a great date, she spent his money, and moved on.<br>  <br>  Does that answer your question?|`|NIYYN6tpaa	As a red head I do just the opposite. When people ask a really long question, I don't read it and put a random answer|`|DbIL3BItaa	What, even if they ask something like 'do you prefer red or blue?'?|`|0b749584c35f2d85b042fb4c77b72f79aa	I do!|`|82RpMUdEaa	Right|`|cLGVSuFqaa	well not really|`|eta0c25yaa	this is too long to read. sorry|`|iVq1byuwaa	I love doing that. It actually feels like ur helping ppl u know.|`|kApF62cxaa	I try to leave a long legit answer to get *BEST ANSWER*.<br>  There is really no point in getting to higher levels. It's not like we get anything in return but I guess it's just for the fun of it. I like to see what people in this world are really thinking about. Some of these questions on here are extremely odd but it's also educating to read and see other's opinion. Some are also very annoying I must say. I usually stay in the Beauty, Relationships and Entertainment areas because I know a solid high IQ isnt required to answer those questions.|`|Qlo4ZWGraa	The Church of the SubGenius is the PAN-RELIGION of the FUTURE, and REBELS against the namby-pamby, goody two-shoes "NEW AGE" and "AQUARIAN" ideals of most occult weirdos. Such people are fools, they do not curse, they have no understanding of the need for spiritual violence in this modern space-age a-go-go society.<br>  The SubGenius wants no part of the "New Age," it is already here and it obviously sucks. The SubGenius would rather RETRIEVE the manly Past, before 1971 or even 1953, or else dwell in the naughty, fun-loving REMOTE FUTURE, a strange time when anything made of plastic is a valuable antique that collectors will KILL for, when SEXHURT will be recognized and indulged in as sane human nature no matter whether any 'church' or 'government' allows it. But such things are TRIFLES! The SubGenius knows that JEHOVAH 1 is a VENGEFUL GOD OF WRATH! JEHOVAH 1 - a.k.a. YAHWEH - is a mad alien, full of eyes round about, He cometh with the clouds, radioactive, all-pervading, He has forged His covenant with the SubGenius in CHAINS of GENETIC PROGRAMMING and DEMANDS OBEISANCE to His caveman sense of humor. He has been denying us SLACK and what He is making us do dates back to Homo Connectus, First Whole Man; only by letting our bodies obey the Code of financial lust survival that is built into them can our brains be freed from his INEVITABLE FIST.<br>  <br>  Everything we do, have done, or will ever do, normally on-the-job but also and especially on the causational level of micro-atomic occurences and billionth-of-a-nanosecond electron collisions, is dictated by the permutations of the great SKORE, the cosmic worknet of cause-and-effect, the mutamorphic ARCHIVE of the shapes and movements of every blood tick, sperm whale, vampire gnat, movie star and gorgosaurus, "all the molecules of oil on all the grains of sand of every moonlit beach of the world. " No, "YOU CAN'T CHANGE THE SKORE." But JEHOVAH 1 can...and like an ax this TOTAL FATE PROGRAM confronts our similarly-encoded SENSE OF SLACK and cleaves our heads straight down the middle into schizocephalic right and left sides whose sub-id battleground is responsible for our precariously balanced NENTAL IVES: clones of us in the spirit world whose duplicate lusts influence our behavior on this material plane. Yes - JEHOVAH 1 smote us in primeval days with BAD BRAKES by which we cannot stop our devil twin from overcoming our 'better nature' and by which, furthermore, we cannot even begin to tell the difference between the two! Brakes keep us from committing ANYTHING WE MIGHT IMAGINE IN OUR MOST DANGEROUS FLEETING FANTASIES, such as chopping off noisy children's heads and giving... well, all of us, even non-SubGeniuslike whimps of the second and third waters, are Jekyll/Hyde monsters of two conflicting Noggin Polarities in our personalities; the SHAFT OF SUPPRESSION rears its ugly Head in response to this utter psychosis which squirms for most of our lives only in the dim, unseen reaches of our behavior-pumps; we act completely normal most of the time, but who is to say at any given moment which side, the 'good' or the 'bad,' is currently in control of The Animal? Thank "God" we are usually never aware of the subconscious Armageddon which expresses itself, physically, in our paranoias, human Work Instincts and universanal compulsions, and, spiritually, in our unruly but subtle psychic powers - which result not so much from any 'inner aura' but rather from a somewhat mindless 'ghost' standing invisibly at our sides: it is the half of our intelligence which is currently not controlling The Animal, it is the NENTAL IFE, and it erupts from its usual idiot blithering into weird, occult pheno-manifestations only when our turbulent mental background reaches such peaks of simultaneous crisis and repression as the stormy glandular rampages of adolescence!|`|G2QNC22eaa	yes i do that too leave a good long answer is like showing you actually bothered to read what they put and you know what you are actually talking about it's kind of fun because you can get best answer too even if you was not expecting  it|`|fFzfPqjBaa	This is a best answer!

2vhXqnJzaa	Everything!!!!! I live in the UK but have visited the USA twice and I adore it, I would move there in a flash if I could. Everything is so big, the roads, the houses, the cars, you feel free and less claustrophobic because you have so much space and the place is so diverse, where else can you go on holiday and see the Grand Canyon, Yosemite, Death Valley, San Francisco etc etc all in 2 weeks!<br>  <br>  The food is great and diverse and I found the people to be genuinely friendly and happy to come and talk to us, the British are made very welcome. I love it!|`|A4qtTlKSaa	I love the vastness of America, its so huge and so diverse.

c04c66fe2f7520a305d4676ca06e8647aa	I would prefer a hunky guy with brains, great sense of humor and common sense. But there is no such guy (:D) so I guess I am stuck with option 1.|`|IMENWksEaa	My husband fits the second description, but he's not so bad with the ego deal now that he's older.|`|UPgLy0Ahaa	Spirituality is more important, but if I had to choose...<br>  <br>  I would have to say #1. A sense of humor gets me every time.<br>  <br>  Not into the buff, egotistical type. The mirror is usually only big enough for one.|`|cbZdeOSPaa	It is obvious that many of us will fall for "looks" and choose the most attractive hotter guy but when it comes to their qualities we choose the smart, less attractive type of guy. In my opinion guys that are the "Hunk Type" tend to be vane and egocentric, ya know full of themselves..not that all of them are the same but most of them are, meanwhile 'Nerd Type" guys are sweeter, smarter and care more about the good qualities of women instead of just looks...besides I love shy guys (since I'm very bashful) and I think they are "marriage material" Hunk guys are less willing to commit. But it all depends perhaps there is a Hot Nerd around , who knows.|`|JZxZ8mKRaa	Number 1 by far.<br>  <br>  My husband, probably a tad better looking than you are crediting your character fits the rest of the description.<br>  <br>  A little age took care of the needed pounds naturally. He's known circuit, no I'd say several states wide for his jokes, more intelligent than I give him credit for (sometimes he REALLY surprises me) and just shy enough for his humility to be easily seen.<br>  <br>  We've been married for going on 42 years. I would do it over again in a heart-beat.<br>  <br>  And I will say, when he was in his 20's, he had the "Elvis" look.|`|k03dYskYaa	Neither<br>  I can't deal with timid or egotistical.<br>  <br>  I'm happily married to a good looking man who is confident but humble. We laugh together all the time. And he's sharp as a tack.|`|AA10671142	how's about I say both. this way I will be safe|`|py39L7Wraa	1. A Nerd Type - from what you said he possesses the qualities for a future marriage mate who is going to be stable. <br>  supremely intelligent is a bonus, all home work kids have to do head straight to the father.<br>  Always thinks two steps ahead, there is another asset for marriage. not necessarily see through danger, but he is able to point out pitfalls in certain decisions which are going to be made. <br>  great wit and humour, we all need to laugh at some point in time. ease the stress off of us.<br>  not the best looking, unfortunately we can't have everything. as long as the person is pleasing to look at no problem. but looks shouldn't matter there. <br>  shy and timid part, i could live with that. though, some girls would take advantage of it...because they get to control him. interesting thought.<br>  <br>  2. A hunk type- if we all got buffer and hotter we would all be happy girls and women. he's basically the type which screams out temporary relationship. which means chances of it lasting are very slim. <br>  <br>  so i'll go with the first. if i can get the second one look's with the first one personality type then great for me. but the chances of that happening are like one in a million.|`|01e20da0d169c7d0c6c0a2c2631a8036aa	My man is kinda smack in the middle of both when you get to know him. Hes not really scared of anything, but he would never put him self in danger to show that.Now if any one ever broke into our home I know that he would be able to hold his own.<br>   Some think he is shy but he just doesn't talk allot. Unless its something that he really enjoys.<br>   He does have humor (but not the kind I like lol) Im more for the dry humor.<br>   Hes not the hottest guy but he does turn a few heads. He sure does still turn mine.<br>   Not too dense....lol JKING <br>   Now the non-critical thinking well hummm... I would say that he fits that one. But its fine because it fits me....<br>   So I guess that what my over all would be is that most people are some place in between.<br>   Gosh I wonder what he would have picked if he would have had an option.  LOL|`|Xt9wIj4Iaa	Generally speaking most women, given these two options, would SAY they would go for number 1. But given a real world situation, they would completely ignore number 1 and be interested in number 2.<br>  <br>  But that is only in general. Individually, many women would pick number 1 over number 2.|`|ZjM0ghSnaa	hmm...Probably the nerd type. I hate guys with big ego's, and think they're all that. <br>  <br>  But I dont want a guy who is timid or shy all the time. If a guy can make me laugh, that's all that counts.|`|Zl3re1Vhaa	i married #2 he's a wonderful man i just wish he had a larger vocabulary|`|2mCiqG3maa	I actually would go for the nerd type, they are hot!|`|MdXwD2JSaa	1 for sure.|`|Wy4gBVmpaa	Well, I think beauty is in the eye of the beholder.<br>  <br>   Because even if someone is extremely good-looking, but they have an awful personality and doesn't care about others, well then I think I would call that guy ugly.<br>  <br>  A nerd can be good looking.  Besides, who wouldn't want someone who cares for others, is intelligent, critical thinker, and funny?  Looks are superficial.  It's what's in one's heart that counts.  : )|`|JbCAxMVjaa	Oh the nerd type for sure- no doubt about it! I adore nerds. Looks fade, I want to marry for who someone really is-because I love them for who they are- not because they're good looking. Looks mean nothing, in the long run. Good looks fade.|`|b0d1be009491a87c770b3458819fb122aa	Ladies, how would you like a mixture of both?<br>  <br>  A tasty mix of Albert Einstein and Hulk Hogan?<br>  <br>  Wow, quite nice...  but, the sad point is:<br>  <br>  with the brains of Hulk Hogan and from Einstein the figure...|`|a9uA8vfQaa	My mate is both I married a very smart man that's buff and sexy. But it was his caring and intelligence that attracted me to him. The sexy buff part added to it. Still in love after 6 years of marriage and two kids.|`|y4nbDf8waa	i would invent something so i can merge 1 & 2 to make the ULTIMATE man. haha.|`|64cUxJn1aa	Pew!

BVQcBbmIaa	I'm not sure that the old definition of English stands the test of purity any way. Since the Bronze age the Uk and it's islands have been host to a series of invasions, settlements and waves of immigration. In my mind THIS is the ultimate definition of England and indeed the entire UK. <br>  <br>  In administrative and political terms:<br>  If you are born in a country then as a general rule you acquire that nationality. Regardless of racial background and the original nationality of your parents.<br>  <br>  <br>  I'm born in Wales  but grew up in England, Scotland, USA and Scotland again.<br>  <br>  My family are a true mongrel mix of Cornish, Scottish, English, Welsh no doubt some Irish(and all the various ancient mixes that implies). I prefer to be of the United Kingdom rather than England as it is the most concrete Identity I can find for myself. <br>  <br>  Others feel different. <br>  <br>  That's the whole issue though, we define ourselves.

If you feel good, you tend to find yourself more attractive, but if you feel like sh*t, then you look like sh*t. <br>  You shouldn't put yourself down like that, being beautiful is not the most important thing in life. You should be happy with what you've got and stop worrying about what you don't have because you are who you are.|`|c8a7b3fbcca5a241bbfcb1c09597749aaa	When I was younger (teens and early twenties) I really hated my face, because it didn't look like the "pretty" faces I saw on TV and in magazines. By the time I hit my late 20's/early 30's I had grown comfortable with it, and now that I'm in my 40's I'm downright thankful not to have a face that looks like everyone else's. I think as you get older you value your individuality more and you lose that preoccupation with having to fit some sort of societal standard of beauty. I think my face fits my personality, which is a little fun and goofy. So I'm cool with it :)|`|AA10354077	No, never.|`|SYJhGXu4aa	no.|`|NfhsXAOeaa	I fell the same ways sometimes.

You can slice it and have a hot SPAM sandwich, or it's good cold too. <br>  I do understand how people would be grossed out. I mean that jelly that it's packed in isn't exactly very appetizing, but it washes off with warm water.<br>  And no, it's not that I can't afford anything better. I grew up eating it, and just like the way it tastes. I also like Porterhouse steaks and lobster, with a nice Chardonnay. But SPAM and beer is great too.
