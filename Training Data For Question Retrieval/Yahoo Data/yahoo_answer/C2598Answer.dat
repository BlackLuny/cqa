jNNQdlqnaa	its not anti freeze you need!. that goes in the engine as coolant<br>  its quite common for a/c units to lose there charge, you just need to have the system regassed,<br>  various places will do it for around ￡80 but shop around for a good deal<br>  nationwide crash repair centres can do it but go online to find a local technition|`|AA10431229	Unfortunately it is likely to be quite expensive to fix. It's also not recommended to disturb the system yourself as you may release the gas (freon) to atmosphere, which is illegal in most countries, as it a CFC. Your best option is to take it to professionals but that will be costly. <br>  As, like you said, it went out gradually, I don't think it is an electrical problem so I think there is not a lot you can do yourself.|`|b3cacdff5027b294a46ed7d569de53dbaa	its the A/C charger. go to your local shop and ask for a A/C charger kit. pretty cheap and easy to do yourself , or you can probably get it done for about 50 bucks or so.|`|gRrv02bPaa	It's not anti-freeze, it's most likely your AC needing a "recharge".  You can get that done either yourself (by topping off) or pay someone to do it.<br>  <br>  The pros and con follows:<br>  <br>  If you pay someone to do it, a reputable shop will drain out your system, flush it out, check for leaks and put in new refrigerant.  But it can be costly.  Expect to pay around 100 - 150 bucks or so.<br>  <br>  If you do it yourself, you don't have the equipment to check for leaks, drain it, flush it out.  But it can be a low cost "quick fix". $35 or so dollars.<br>  <br>  Here is a good link for you on how to recharge it (Make sure you connect to the LOW pressure port!)<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.id-usa.com/how_to_recharging.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.id-usa.com/how_to_recharging....</a>|`|6ff9pCeIaa	anti-freeze would be my guess, i mean, if it still blows then its doing its job, but the antifreeze is what makes the air cold, so i'd justput that in ther and call it a good day : )|`|boYnYejVaa	antifreeze goes in the radiator and cools the engine, that's obviouslynot what you need.  since you said the a/c gradually got less and less cold, what you probably have is a refrigerant leak (aka FREON or R-134a).  so you need to take your car to a place that works on a/c's as this is not something you can repair yourself very easily.  it probably won't be cheap either.<br>  <br>  good luck
AA12261615	regular maintenance on the car is not much more than a regular car is,oil changes shouldn't cost any more either,but most places will charge a lot more,but i have heard too that maintenance is high on them yet i have  a few customers that own them,and their not spending that much on them,maybe including the cost of insurance and other things it might be that high,but if its in good shape now,it should remain that way ,you have to fix things as they tear up though,don't wait on them to long,because in some cases one part may make another part go bad,and this could get expensive,but just on routine maintenance,it shouldn't cost that much,good luck with it hope this helps.

AA11163266	No but would you believe me if I told you about the blind mechanic who teaches kids how to rebuild engines. I am a smog tech here in Los Angeles, California so we get news fliers every quarter and had an article on him. Guy is really good and I guess if you rebuild so many you can do it without looking. So anything is possible.|`|AA12261615	i haven't ever heard of anyone being any kind of a mechanic and being deaf,it would be real hard to work on anything and be deaf,I'm not going to say it would be impossible,but it sure would be hard.|`|10787ad9d50568131f1d42580a55956aaa	Well i am not deaf in both ears but stone deaf in one ear,does not bother me or inhibit my ability to diagnose problems,some times it helps to isolate noises because we don't get it in stereo,novel sometimes.
TCINOEX1aa	Wrong section.....
wpgRMjgraa	Sure..............you just need to search for a auto radio repair shop in or around your area and let them check it out for you......this is what we do if our customers need radio repairs, we just pull them out and send them off to the radio shop...
cfcuBxdsaa	yes that is about right you can pay on the average anywhere up to 200.00 and be within the guidelines.|`|groIDUPJaa	Don't forget you are getting tags too...they are right...I'm sure you have some sort of motor vehicle agency you can confirm with online. <br>  <br>  In NJ we just registered a used vehicle and it cost over $100.
addaf7237cf3d32190cfc96546e98709aa	The CAI will add power and better sound.<br>  It should add 5-15HP depending on the brand.<br>  go with Injen or AEM for most power.<br>  <br>  If this was a turbocharged Mazda 3, the CAI would add even more power. 15-35HP.<br>  <br>  For Exhaust, go with Corksport, Vibrant, HKS, Injen, or BuddyClub.<br>  <br>  These reliable websites have all the performance parts for this car at cheap prices.<br>  <br>  www.corksport.com<br>  www.protegegarage.com<br>  <br>  A CAI is worth it. And Easy to install yourself.|`|Rwn0svq0aa	Absolutely. AEM for CAI and Magnaflow for a cat back exhaust. The upper end of the rev range from 4500 to 6500 rpm you will notice the power band is more robust. When you hit 80 mph and higher the car doesn't run out of breath. It seemingly inhales to the car's top speed. Very nice, very satisfying. The sound is appropriately sporty, but you might want to get insulating material in the doors and trunk area to minimize the drone and to better enhance the stereo. Magnaflow is not cheap, cost around $600-$700.00, however you get what you pay for. The AEM CAI is maybe a couple hundred, both mods are worth it. I would do it again.|`|dYa5AEwSaa	yes you could put a fluwmaster, you can find this at any shop of accesories, and you should put a fluwmaster, these sound good. and cost around $150 dollars.
8GDBr2U9aa	One has nothing to do with the other. You signed a contract to borrow the money to buy the Jeep. That money has to be repaid, regardless of whether or not the car runs or whether you have a warranty. The car was sold "as is", you just bought a third-party warranty, which the dealer never paid for. If you can find the dealer, you could sue to get the money you spent on the warranty back, but not the Jeep. The Jeep is yours, either fix it or pay $7000 for a vehicle you can't drive.|`|c11fee07c98ac2e271f2ab5acd400781aa	You're stuck.<br>  <br>  The dealer skipped town because he's broke.  <br>  <br>  Good luck collecting from him/her.<br>  <br>  If your hubby had done his homework and gotten the Jeep inspected before signing the papers, this would never have gotten to this point, warranty or not.  This Jeep is NOT a lemon, either, as that only covers factory defects and the like.<br>  <br>  There is no way a 2001 Jeep would be eligible for even a 3rd party warranty anyway!  It's too old.  Even my 2003 F150 is too old and has too many miles.|`|1hciyvKdaa	Your going to have to spend money and sue him, that is if you can find him. Call up a dealership and ask what liscensing beareau you need to contact, the better business bureau may be able to tell you. Call the finance company and ask if they can help you find him too.|`|RbsRpcIyaa	As alluded to, contact an attorney. My guess is that going the small claims court right will see the dealer skip out if he's already gone under. If he was indeed incorporated, you probably are going to find that there isn't much that can be done. <br>  <br>  I did want to add one quick note, though. The BBB would be absolutely powerless in this situation. Even if the dealer was a so-called "member", all the BBB will do is deliver your complaint to him/her, and wait for the dealer to respond to it. No matter the response, positive or negative (the dealer can reply with "I told the buyer to go fly a kite"), the BBB will mark it as "resolved". The dealer can have thousands of complaints against them and still be a member of the BBB. All they have to do is pay their annual dues. If they've gone under, however...|`|mTwn8p79aa	Oh no!<br>  <br>  What a terrible situation.  I've got some really bad news.  Your only option will be to try to sue them but it's going to be tough.  If the dealer was incorporated and they went bankrupt there'll be nothing you can do, you'd be completely stuck.  As it is, it's going to be tough to find out who even owned the dealer to find out who to sue.  Contact the BBB and make a report.<br>  <br>  What a bad spot to be in, I'm very sorry for the situation that occurred to you.  Always make sure you run a carfax and have a mechanic check out a used vehicle before you buy it.  Generally speaking, extended warranties aren't worth it.  Most pro's say to avoid anything that isn't by the vehicle manufacturer but that doesn't help you much in this situation.<br>  <br>  Again, very sorry for the tough luck.  I think your real option here is to fix the truck and keep driving it.<br>  <br>  Just FYI, lemon laws are specifically only for brand new cars.  There's no such thing as lemon laws for used cars.  But, a car that was deemed a lemon by the original owner/manufacturer would show up on a carfax report so you could know to avoid it.
r1D9P4Vyaa	For this one you will need to get it scanned. then it has to be checked over why that code was set. Like a broken wire to a wheel sensor. A bad wheel sensor reading, poor contatcs in the wiring, Etc. You will have just the normal braking with the light on. The wheels will lock up when the brake is pushed hard. Not the anti-lock that you are used to.|`|DV4xyeChaa	get computer scan see which sensor is bad<br>  check brake fluid level...|`|YTG3bCeDaa	The problem is that it's a 2001 Pontiac Sunfire. You can fix it by trading it in or taking to the junkyard.
UAW1U3Uoaa	Previous answer is incorrect, you may be charged with carless or even dangerous driving, it depends on how bad the accident was. If you are charged and convicted you will have a criminal record, probably a fine and points added to your licence. Based on the info given I doubt you would be charged with Dangerous drving but Careless driving is a definate possibility. You are unlikely to be fined thousands of pounds if no one was injured and the damage was minor.|`|91b447d14a20a5eb99e6371357163e4faa	Something similar happened to me last week. The police noted the accident, but no action was taken against me as it was an accident and there was no evidence or suggestion that my driving was poor. The insurance company have sorted out the claim and yes, my premium will be a little higher next year. No court papers, fines, points or hard labour!|`|7qffxf3Vaa	nothing - you insurance will pay out and your insurance premium may rise a little  - and you will loose any no claims bonus.<br>  you wont be treated like a criminal|`|96DnmD7baa	Wow! you damp lucky cause nobody get kill/hurts. No worry just pay some compound fine cause its consider lost off control of vehicle. The third party will claim under your insurance|`|91f68d84e5baee88c4ba91159a357ae4aa	Probably you'll be charged with failing to comply with the traffic signal. That would normally gain you 3 point plus a smallish fine. Conceivably they'll charge you with careless driving, that would get you 3 - 9 points plus a more substantial fine. It won't be thousands.<br>  <br>  I know it's easy to say, but don't panic too much about it until the paperwork arrives - you aren't the only one by a long chalk.|`|f6ae2bf2ebd4ad49b32dea3818324e4caa	in the uk that is careless driving and would be dealt with by the courts normally in the form of points and fine, plus the increase in insurance.

If you going for the guiness record I advise you not to do so because you are short of 500 more time. Now I know what don"t wear a cap to cover your face.|`|r1D9P4Vyaa	You did not say what the stupid reasons were, maybe try going to a different testing place as to not be doing it with the same guy. Good Luck =^)|`|EMC7JwVBaa	If you truly don't know why you failed 4 times, start from the beginning of learning to drive: Get in a driving school and pay attention to all the lessons, then practice doing what they teach you and not doing what they teach you to not do. While you're not driving, study the rules and make them your rules. You will pass if you do it this way. If you cannot do it that way, forget about being a licensed driver.  You paid too much already- waaaaay too much.

9496974db835ff1a0850895b0709efe8aa	First you need to establish whether it's really a Judge or not. The easiest rule of thumb is to look at the paint code - does it say "72" on the data plate under the hood? While it's not a sure-fire way, it can help narrow it down because most Judges were built in this red/orange color called Carousel Red. If it's one of the other two reds - there was a basic red and a maroon - you can't use this rule of thumb. However, Judges in "other" cars are a lot rarer than the signature Carousel Red.<br>  <br>  Your best bet, however, is to get the original invoice from Pontiac Historical Services. This will show if the car came with the Judge package, not to mention whether it has the optional Ram Air IV engine.<br>  <br>  It's hard to say how much the car is worth until we know more, especially since there are no pictures.|`|2ee9ba3f8fa52a8c3bd583c6f12f11b8aa	Hard to say, without seeing the pictures.  Could be $10,000 - $20,000.|`|84AVcZ9laa	.I believe the original paint would be orange . If it is a judge in mint condition it would be worth $45,000 in the condition you are describing If it is a judge I would say about$5,100 so it would be a good investment if you have the means to restore it .hope this helped info from old car price guide ..
zOIgzIy4aa	it could just be the gas filter needs changing.|`|AA10331789	A red flag should immediately go up because the problem could even be a failing automatic transmission for all you know $$$. I would take it to a Ford/ Mercury dealer and get their diagnosis of the problem because they've seen and fixed the toughest problems on their own cars. Also get a general mechanical inspection at the same time needed to register the car in your state. It will be worth the money even if you don't buy the car.|`|cN4pYes0aa	Take the wings off and quit tickling it before takeoff- where did you go to school?|`|3mo8vrpTaa	Try a jug of LUCAS in the trans.

AA12243350	As long as you use the recommended lubricants and supplies, and follow the check list in your service manual, and you keep the receipts, you can do the work yourself and not void your warranty. But You need to make certain you have the equipment and skills to do it right.<br>   I do 90% of my services myself on my Harley's. Always have, and never yet had a dealer give me any grief. I always do them early, have a folder in the back of my service manual to keep the receipts in, and I write right on the receipt what it is for, IE: 5000 mile service etc and make certain I use the proper supplies. And, I save myself a ton of money doing it. If there is a part of a service you can't or don't want to do yourself, like adjust steering head bearings for instance, do the rest of the service, and have the dealer do just that part of the service.<br>  ride safe|`|BZMPax7Naa	It would make it easier in the event that something were to happen.  However, they can't refuse warranty service unless they can prove the damage was caused by negligence.   So get a service manual and do it all yourself|`|1ca078fb6ac9d1741007da931ca6cd16aa	You do not have to go to a dealer to maintain the warranty.<br>  You do need to keep accurate records.<br>  One tip: photocopy all your receipts. Why? I found that the thermal printed receipts fade out to unreadable within 6 months. Can't prove anything with blank paper...<br>  Another, less expensive alternative to the dealer is an independent shop. I do my own maintenance, but for stuff I don't want to do or don't have a proper tool for, I go to a local shop. He and I work together. I save a bit and sometimes learn a bit. He charges me $50 an hour, so that clutch adjustment you want would be $50 and a half hour of shootin' the breeze.|`|98NiEivhaa	That's a dealership ploy to get you back for an overinflated menu priced service.  You can so do it yourself and document it all and still have your warranty in place.<br>  Some stealerships pull that, while others don't.|`|dNrR8sJGaa	If not you better use all HD brand parts, oil filters etc. any problems down the road that you can not document using their stuff will give them an excuse to not honor the warranty. They are famous for that|`|6f89b5d16dbdb895634e3f8c49efb428aa	If your dealer tells you some crap about having to use HD oil etc. refer him to the Magnuson-Moss Warranty act of 1975. If they say you must use their stuff then they have to provide it at no cost.

The security code can then be entered using the station buttons 1 to 6 on the unit, enter your number in the correct order and it will automatically come on. If you make a mistake switch it off and start again. An incorrect code will show four dashes after which the radio will be locked for 5mins up to and an hour. If an incorrect code is entered leave it switched on untouched until the 'Code' prompt again then repeat process.

He does not reset the lights but most of the time when that light is on, it doesn't mean anything major. We drive everything, even if the light is on. It doesn't always mean there is something wrong with the vehicle. but if there is a diferent light on like the alternator light or the oil pressure light you should get it fixed. So I say if the only light that is on is the check engine light then you can still buy it and drive it but if your concerned then you can get it checked by and mechanic and most likely be overcharged.|`|AA10627854	if you have your own scan tool it will say a trouble code is present even if the check engine light isnt on if not do what the others say drive it around for 20 minutes or go buy a scan tool they cheap then return it when you done with it|`|WWqmHTYSaa	yes you can, easily drive it. Not 10 miles not 20 miles, Drive it long and hard. If there is a problem the light will come back on in a hurry. Cylinder misfire can only be covered up for about 15 miles or so. So yeah you can. Do yourself the favor and drive it. Say your taking it to lunch. I worked at a prestigious car lot. Trust me they'll do whatever. Even wipe your ***.
5xxuKzXPaa	fill the reservoir and with the engine running, go from stop on the steering to stop. this will move allot of fluid and should bleed the air out.|`|AA10406093	Generally you need to raise the front end of the car as much as practical, then slowly turn the wheels all the way back and forth left to right 10 or 20 times, to work out the air.|`|Q4O1v13Qaa	Hands down, there's one way that works best by far. Hook up a hand held vacuum pump to the opening where you pour the fluid in, while the engine is running. Only takes a few in/hg. Sucks all the air right out of the fluid in less than a minute. Works even when nothing else will.<br>  <br>  As far as the method the others have mentioned, do it with the wheels on the ground while parked. The pressure builds up higher that way. Don't leave the wheel turned all the way more than a moment or two. Oh, and you want the engine on. Not enough pressure otherwise.|`|NbCBk3mqaa	i had the same problem with a ford ranger after i replaced p/s pump.What i did was have the front wheels of the ground,engine off and slowly turned the wheel full right and full left.give it time to let the air bubbles settle.Than i drove around making as many turns.I stopped and shut the engine off and checked the fluid lever,than drove some more(it took awhile to work)|`|3mo8vrpTaa	Turn off the motor wait 3 min.

Kinda excuse me, ghetto.....<br>  <br>  Polished rims are much more s leek, sexy, and show much more class.|`|Ty32khkaaa	Chrome is best, but there are some nice polished alloy rims out there. They both look good. Stay away from painted rims. If you must have colored rims have them powder coated. It will last much longer.|`|ytgjFFq6aa	chrome is the best look in my opinion, easiest to clean, polished wheels look good but if you use any type of tire cleaner it will turn them white then you have to polish them out, to keep the polished alum looking good you will have to polish them quite often and trust me it gets old over time. painted rims look good as well and are easy to clean like the chrome wheels are.|`|jHmepKRMaa	Depends on your wallet i'd get polished aluminum.

gOQ5mZ7Xaa	328i. The 318i's 4-cyl is a pretty gutless thing, and if you love power and speed that's certainly not what you're getting from your uncle's 318.|`|sCqdisvnaa	It's not as fast, but a 318 handles and steers a little better than a 328, because there's less weight over the nose, thanks to the lighter engine.<br>  <br>  A 318i isn't fast, but a 328i isn't an especially fast car either, and it increases your opportunity as an inexperienced driver to get into trouble.  <br>  <br>  Get the 318, enjoy the BMW driving experience, work on your skills, and upgrade later.|`|r9lQQ0gEaa	Get the 328. I have the same year that you are considering. I love it. Its fast, small, looks nice, and females love it. Tint the windows, get some nice rims and a good sound system and you're set. <br>  If you can afford to constantly maintain the vehicle then I definitely recommend that you find a 328i!<br>  <br>  DOWNSIDE:<br>  Not to scare you or anything but the insurance is going to be ridiculous being that you are so young. Im 19 and I pay about 462 monthly and that's JUST liability. And its expensive to fix. 600 bucks to fix the left fender and another 500 to change the radiator. <br>  <br>  PS<br>  I must warn you that you might have a **** load of problems with the a/c unit. Alot of 97 328i's have that same problem.|`|86692840fce86f8a24dea58512123d09aa	for that price  you should grab up your uncles car.

IXLH4Hsgaa	Now listen as I HAVE ACTUALLY BTDT, you first put<br>  the crankshaft in the block and install the main bearings and caps.  A little oil on the journals and the crank should turn VERY EASILY in the block.<br>  <br>  Now if it turns very freely, you install a piston and rod.<br>  <br>  Again, you turn the engine over, but now the drag from the piston and rings will be obvious, but you should feel no binding, just some drag due to the piston rings.<br>  <br>  You do this with each piston and rod, always making sure it turns.<br>  <br>  I think it takes about 35-40 ft-lb to turn a V8 chev with the crank and all pistons installed.   <br>  <br>  He needs a good shop manual for sure.|`|gUaXZPYmaa	well first you have to check the clearances on the mains of the crankshaft and make sure theyre in spec. also you need to check the clearance on the rod bearings aswell, and make sure those are in spec. then when u attach the rods and pistons make sure to turn the crank and see that it turns freely. and it should feel slightly harder to turn as you add pistons.|`|9740e5e8ead5b37471166c9abd4dfaa7aa	Did he use "plasticguage" on all rod caps and main bearing caps (torqued properly) before he tried to turn the crank? There are set procedures that must be followed with an engine rebuild. I think some of the steps have been missed. I'm not going into detail, but look it up.|`|Ty32khkaaa	Sounds like there is not enough room for movement. Did he torque them? If not take them off and use a torque wrench this time. He could also have bad or the wrong bearings. Try checking the gap between the bearings. Your local auto part store will be able to help. Good luck|`|XHcpxLRDaa	I hope hes not re-using the old rod bolts......... Rod bolts stretch and should not be used twice... Also if the crank wasnt machined and check for clearance with the rods and bearings he is using there is no point in rebuilding the engine|`|3892a47ffe478c2cd83ade91886d7bf5aa	did he shim the caps for proper clearance|`|EMC7JwVBaa	He needs to measure the bearings and plastigauge the crank to tell what the right size bearings should be- and always use assembly lube on new bearings. I rebuilt a lot of engines and used the same rod bolts, though you should replace them. I never had a problem. Also, the rod bolts should all be torqued to a specific tightness- not more, not less. If this engine was completely rebuilt with new pistons, the rings should have gap clearance measured. That covers friction, now let's address compression. A completly rebuilt engine is going to be very tight. It should turn over, but the compression is going to resist rotation along with the friction of parts not yet bedded in.  If he messed with the cam, and that is possible, it could be that valve timing is wrong and the pistons are running against open valves. If all he did was the rod bearings, then he needs to make sure he has the right size, assembly lube them and torque the bolts correctly. If that's all he did, then he has the wrong bearings.|`|6Zflv6cpaa	he may have the rod and main bearing caps too tight .did he lube the cylinder walls before reinstalling the pistons?  either one of these could be the problem|`|G55yuZlgaa	the rods and caps have numbers, they must match each other.  if a rod has the wrong cap on it, the engine won't turn.
AA12261615	the only thing i got from either of those codes was the fuel sensor may be bad and you have evap leak,which could be anything from a loose gas cap to a hose being off,anyone can read the codes but interpreting them and knowing the meaning and whats wrong with it is a different thing,if you d have to pull the sending unit out on that one it would be a good idea to replace the pump assembly as whole unit,it may save having to do it later on,but there's nothing there about a fuel pump going bad,good luck.|`|Yq2CUhtYaa	What part of that would say anything about a fuel pump?<br>  <br>  It says your fuel sensor is bad, and your evap system isn't working properly.<br>  <br>  Neither of which, is a fuel pump.

JLayHNZCaa	Yes there is, but why?  Daytime running lamps are there for a reason, safety.  Use em'<br>  <br>  Oh, and you realize that a vehicle that has them and they don't work, is a valid reason for the police to pull you over?  Any equipment that is standard from the factory has to be present and working or you can be pulled over and ticketed.  Why give them any reason to do so?|`|1xkc6Ktmaa	The daytime lights are there for a reason, for safety. That's why bikers ride with high beams on in the day, so they can be seen.

If you don't understand this, don't do it.|`|8ifKojOXaa	Pop out the day light headlight relay that will cause them not to work , it should be in the fuse box under the hood.<br>  <br>   Hope that helps and best of luck.|`|ND1nFEWSaa	pull the emergency brake up one click, or push pedal down one click|`|NWsiJleKaa	There should be a button near your headlight switch that's labeled "Dome Override" or something to that effect. Press it in and out 4 times in quick succession and you should hear a "Bing" like the tone that sounds when you leave the lights on after the car is shut off, or the key is left in the ignition when the car's door is open. After that tone sounds, your day-time running lights will remain off until you shut the car off and start it up again, and you can operate the lights manually using only the switch. Like I said above, you'll need to repeat this process every time you start the car in order for the automatic lights to go off. It's a bit of a nuisance at first, but after a while, it becomes second nature.|`|qsozRiDGaa	Remove the DRL relay. Upon removal of the relay, you may not have a drivers side high beam light. Run a jumper wire from the passenger side high beam positive wire to the drivers side high beam wire. Best of luck.
JNUWt9IAaa	In realtà quello che genera veramente il rumore non è la compressione e l'espansione dell'aria.<br>  Ad esempio un condizionatore fa rumore perchè è il motore elettrico ad essere rumoroso, come anche quello di un frullatore se è per questo.<br>  Quello che fa rumore è la combustione.<br>  <br>  Questo è ben diverso dal bang sonico che fanno gli scramjet che forse può confondere.<br>  <br>  Le temperature che si raggiungono in camera di combustione arrivano fino a 2000°C.<br>  Pensate anche al rumore dello sparo di una pistola. E' l'esplosione che genera il rumore.<br>  Ecco in un motore a propulsione è come se ci fosse una pistola che spara di continuo e questo sparo è generato dal cherosene che "esplode", o meglio brucia, al contatto con l'aria compressa.<br>  <br>  Questo infatti spiega anche come mai un aereo con afterburner attivo faccia molto più rumore nonostante non vi siano ulteriori lavori di compressione ed espansione.<br>  Il rumore in questo caso è più che raddoppiato perchè la combustione avviene direttamente all'esterno poco prima dell'ugello e quindi non ci sono le pareti della camere di combustione che assorbono parte del rumore.<br>  <br>  I motori di oggi sono meno rumorosi di una volta in quanto la parte di aria combusta è minore di quella non combusta (su vecchi motori tutta l'aria che entrava andava alla combustione).<br>  Infatti ora gran parte dell'aria che viene aspirata dal ventolone frontale (fan) non va dentro al compressore, ma viene spinta attorno al motore, come se fosse un elica intubata.<br>  Di conseguenza all'ugello si avrà un flusso "caldo" rumoroso circondato da un flusso "freddo" silenzioso.<br>  <br>  I vecchi B737-200 sono ancora equipaggiati con dei vecchi motori rumorosi - JT8D - gli stessi che montano gli MD80.<br>  Su questi 737 è stato montato un "Hush Kit" (silenziatore) che prevede infatti la presenza di una presa d'aria vicino all'ugello che aspiri aria fredda, la quale va a coprire l'aria calda riducendone le emissioni sonore.<br>  <a href="http://www.airliners.net/open.file?id=0893468&WxsIERv=Obrvat%20737-230%2FNqi&Wm=0&WdsYXMg=Nve%20Fybinxvn&QtODMg=Qbegzhaq%20-%20Jvpxrqr%20%28QGZ%20%2F%20RQYJ%29&ERDLTkt=Treznal&ktODMp=Whyl%2015%2C%202005&BP=1&WNEb25u=Fgrsna%20Jryfpu&xsIERvdWdsY=BZ-ENA&MgTUQtODMgKE=Avpr%20ratvar%20jvgu%20irel%20ovt%20uhfu%20xvgf.&YXMgTUQtODMgKERD=5545&NEb25uZWxs=2005-08-04%2019%3A03%3A24&ODJ9dvCE=&O89Dcjdg=23156%2F1082&static=yes&width=1200&height=842&sok=JURER%20%20%28nvepensg_trarevp%20%3D%20%27Obrvat%20737-100%27%20BE%20nvepensg_trarevp%20%3D%20%27Obrvat%20737-200%20%28G-43%29%27%29%20NAQ%20%28ZNGPU%20%28nvepensg%2Cnveyvar%2Ccynpr%2Ccubgb_qngr%2Cpbhagel%2Cerznex%2Ccubgbtencure%2Crznvy%2Clrne%2Cert%2Cnvepensg_trarevp%2Cpa%2Cpbqr%29%20NTNVAFG%20%28%27%2B%22uhfu%22%27%20VA%20OBBYRNA%20ZBQR%29%29%20%20BEQRE%20OL%20cubgb_vq%20QRFP&photo_nr=2&prev_id=0990027&next_id=0888964" rel="nofollow">http://www.airliners.net/open.file?id=08...</a><br>  <br>  E' previsto che anche gli MD80 debbano essere aggiornati con un Hush Kit, ma siccome sono vicini alla pensione probabilmente rimarranno così fin quando non verranno dismessi.|`|7fd28f52af7b66b97310920f8c346b80aa	Il principio della spinta a reazione implica che il reattore soffi aria ad altissima velocità, e la fuoriuscita di una grande massa d'aria ad altissima velocità implica la produzione di onde sonore di grande energia.  Ecco il perché di tanto rumore.  Va comunque detto che i motori moderni sono diventati più silenziosi di quelli di una volta.. tanto che hanno creato delle classi di rumore.  Gli aerei delle classi più rumorose non possono utilizzare gli aeroporti "cittadini", e siccome quasi tutti gli aeroporti sono "cittadini" gli aerei più rumorosi hanno poco da volare.|`|mrZHH25Faa	Perchè le turbine dei reattori per funzionare devono comprimere moltissimo l'aria, che poi si miscela al carburante iniettato a pressioni elevate facendolo bruciare ed espellendo i gas con grande forza.<br>  Tutto ciò crea un gran rumore.|`|170qUt5Waa	te lo dice il nome fanno rumore perkè sono a reazione|`|fM130pJXaa	mi associo a idrico e a selei5|`|nhznEjsJaa	Perchè sono molto veloci e poi superano, il muro del suono.<br>  ciao<br>  selei5|`|Ie5T7bCFaa	In poche parole perchè generano dei rapidi e violenti cambi di pressione, comprimono ed espandono gas in frazioni di secondo. Questo genera delle onde sonore di diversa frequenza in base al tipo di motore. D'altronde saprai che il suono non è altro che onde di compressione e decompressione che viaggiano nell'aria e il tuo timpano raccoglie. Stesso motivo per cui fa rumore un motore a scoppio per le auto, o un'esplosione, o un battito di mani. al contrario di quanto si pensa non è dovuto alla pelle che "sbatte"...

Mi hai chiesto di non bere visto che dovevo guidare, così ho<br>  bevuto una sprite. Mi sono sentita orgogliosa di me stessa, anche per aver<br>  ascoltato il modo in cui, dolcemente, mi hai suggerito di non bere se dovevo<br>  guidare, al contrario di quello che mi dicono alcuni amici. Ho fatto una<br>  scelta sana e il tuo consiglio è stato giusto. Quando la festa è finita, la<br>  gente ha iniziato a guidare senza essere in condizioni di farlo. Io ho preso<br>  la mia macchina con la certezza che ero sobria. Non potevo immaginare,<br>  mamma, ciò che mi aspettava... Qualcosa di inaspettato! Ora sono qui<br>  sdraiata sull'asfalto e sento un poliziotto che dice:"il ragazzo che ha<br>  provocato l'incidente era ubriaco". Mamma, la tua voce sembra cosí<br>  lontana!Il mio sangue è sparso dappertutto e sto cercando, con tutte le<br>  mie forze, di non piangere. Posso sentire i medici che dicono: "questa<br>  ragazza non ce la fará". Sono certa che il ragazzo alla guida dell'altra<br>  macchina non se lo immaginava neanche, mentre andava a tutta velocità. Alla<br>  fine lui ha deciso di bere e io adesso devo morire... Perché le persone<br>  fanno tutto questo, mamma? Sapendo che distruggeranno delle vite? Il dolore è<br>  come se mi pugnalasse con un centinaio di coltelli contemporaneamente. Dì a<br>  mia sorella di non spaventarsi, mamma, dì a papà di essere forte. Qualcuno<br>  doveva dire a quel ragazzo che non si deve bere e guidare... Forse, se i<br>  suoi glielo avessero detto, io adesso sarei viva... La mia respirazione si<br>  fa sempre più debole e incomincio ad avere veramente paura.Questi sono i<br>  miei ultimi momenti, e mi sento così disperata...Mi piacerebbe poterti<br>  abbracciare mamma, mentre sono sdraiata, qui,  morente. Mi piacerebbe dirti<br>  che ti voglio bene. Per questo... ti voglio bene e... addio.Queste parole<br>  sono state scritte da un giornalista che era presente all'incidente. La<br>  ragazza, mentre moriva, sussurrava queste parole e il giornalista<br>  scriveva... Scioccato.Questo giornalista ha iniziato una campagna contro la<br>  guida in stato di ebbrezza.|`|odOHyBeCaa	"Fate come io dico e non fate come io faccio!"|`|170qUt5Waa	ke domande kon la bocca e le parole facendo muore le corde vocali sai a tutti gli esseri umani viene spontaneo|`|BthJalDyaa	giusto mio padre quando guida parla al telefono e poi va a 180KM orari in autostrada................<br>  mangia mertre guida ecc...........<br>  e io devo prende il motrino e mi dice: non lo prendere cheti ammazzi ! ciao !|`|GBRwhpnSaa	forse adesso si rendono conto di aver sbagliato|`|vrgZNAVJaa	a me lo diranno per 100.000 volte ma tanto non ridurrò la mia velocità..<br>  mio padre ha fatto 20 km in autostrada a 200 kh/h e intanto era al telefono...<br>  ho un bell'esempio..e poi.. valutando come sono adesso (cioè pazza) quando avrò la macchina farò tutte le cose che ho sempre desiderato fare adesso..... e poi vorrei anche fare un bel rally...<br>  che aspirazioni...per una ragazza poi.. sono il massimo!!<br>  uh uh!

2f9824f26c5c0aff862cb30b3373b9a3aa	The thermostat being stuck is a good option but other things can cause your problem.  The valve to he heater is not opening so you are only getting a small amout of hot water.  The water  level in your radiator is low.  The water line to your heater is plugged.  check the hose going to your heater in the engine compartment to see if it is getting hot while your engine is running.  You should see a valve that opens when you move the lever for hotter inside.  Make sure it opens completely.  Check your radiator and overflow tank.  Make sure there is enough water in your radiator and overflow tank (better done when engine is cold so you dont blow hot water all over the place) If these are not the problem better check with repair garage or someone  who knows what to look for.|`|iJd7Ryfjaa	Check your vacuum lines, some are vacuum accuated and a blend door in the dash to devert air is stuck half way between cool and hot.

kgk3Yz9Naa	the 2 work in different ways..sparky are constantly sparking when the engine is running.it uses the spark for ignition...diesels on the other hand use compression ignition[no spark]..the glow plugs simply warm the fuel up to aid starting...once running they arnt used again till the car has to be restarted....hope this helps|`|ZEwAalKPaa	No. Spark plugs in general have a life span of around 10k miles. Many glow plugs can last much of the life of the engine. They are also expensive and if you got hit for a new set every time you had your car serviced you would scream blue murder at the bill.  My car currently has its original glow plugs in at 83k and they are all working at their original efficiency.|`|4ec5baf736e5e1b4200f6e39ea8eda12aa	only if they are faulty|`|DRGchuRGaa	thats always been the case.. sparkplugs do need changing at service..<br>  whereas glow plugs generally last a lot longer [years].. if your car starts ok in this cold weather,then they should be ok..<br>    allways let the timer do its job with the glow plugs and you should have no trouble<br>    glow plugs can be quite a job on some engines usually theres an odd one thats very hard to reach.. and you got to take other stuff off to get to them..|`|de292ad47a31aedcb683cf279d2cb997aa	It depends what the service schedule says.<br>  <br>  Spark plugs are not changed every time a car is serviced anyway.|`|d4wD2z6daa	No because glow plugs are not like spark plugs at all.|`|te6AfRcnaa	glowplugs also known as heater plugs are not like spark plugs in a petrol car they rarely need changed as they are not causing the engine to fire/run a diesel fires using compression and not a spark to ignite

New cars could go 100,000 miles.  A poor running vehicle could need new plugs in less than 1000 miles.<br>  <br>  Looking at the plug is the best way to determine their condition.  The amount and type of wear, the color, and the deposits or lack of that exist on the end of the plug will tell you what is going on inside the combustion chamber, and whether or not they need to be replaced.<br>  <br>  Google "spark plug reading".  You'll find pictures of what healthy and sick plugs look like.  Compare your plugs to the images and make your own decision.|`|nhGRdDaQaa	30000 for non platinum and 60000 or 100000 for platinum

Many of the post-80's BMWs have strayed far from "the truth".  Too big, too heavy, gobs of electronic driver aids.  And many of today's buyers purchase them for ego enrichment and the status they bring.  Wrong, wrong, wrong.  BMW should put the engineers back at the helm, not the marketing mavens.  And by all means, retain manual trannys.  Porsches and BMWs are meant to have manual trannys.  Let the people that don't know how to shift buy a M-Benz.|`|a0565811de871e19a5c2a7b27aeadf50aa	By far, the best looking M6 was the E24.

It is not just the bike skills.

It is likely the insurance will cost you (teen male) more then the bike.<br>  Good luck and ride safe.|`|3e5vTQxoaa	first,you should collect some resource  by searching the relevant keyword in search engine,if you got good luck there ,then your problem solved.however,if you are not able to find the ideal answer by doing that,here <a href="http://www.insuranceidea.info/free-insurance.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.insuranceidea.info/free-insur...</a>  is the resource i recommend.|`|9447d6d4627edef320b8495e7ad8a770aa	Yes, insurance on all motor vehicles is required. If caught without it the fine is $400 minimum for the first violation. Minimum liability requirement is 25/50/15. That's $25,000 per person bodily injury, $50,000 per accident and $15,000 for property damage. Personal Injury Protection of $3,000 is also required.<br>  <br>  Since 92% of all motorcycle accidents involved riders who were self-taught or learned from family or friends, I highly recommend you take an approved training course. The most important things you need to learn is to be alert for vehicles making a left turn in front of you without signaling, stay out of another vehicle's blind spot, be skilled at controlled swerving (using gyroscopic precession) and sudden braking (by keeping your knees in on the tank you'll dramatically reduce fish-tailing), as well as being aware of what you will be putting your foot down on (like slippery oil) when you come to a stop. If your bike should weigh over 500 pounds, you should know how to lift it back up if you drop it or fall off (one way is to lift with the bike behind you using your leg strength, then pivot around).<br>  <br>  When looking for motorcycle insurance, it's best to use a company that specializes in insuring motorcycles, like Dairyland. Premiums at 16 will be high.<br>  <br>  If you want to save money, buy a Toyota Corolla or similar until you're at least 18.

Your the one who is actually uncertain about what your preference is and bcuz of that your not only using that as a cop out but you're afraid that by riding with your friend others may see right through you and know that mildly attracted to women and that scares the crap out of you and the fact that it's your friend that you maybe even attracted to. You're ready to face that fact that you like girls and  bcuz your still telling yourself things to convince yourself that ur not attracted to women it wont go away. Even if your friend maybe the ones who's gay(which I believe she maybe) I still stand behind what I said bcuz I know for a fact it's true bcuz if you weren't so scared this wouldn't even be a question nor would you care what total strangers think bcuz you'd be secure with in yourself and a "Heterosexual" woman but we know that is not true, huh Bi-curious girl lol.

PAceoX2oaa	The TD04 turbo you speak of probably came off a 1g car with an automatic transmission, didn't it? The TD04 13g turbo is much smaller than the T25 that came stock on your 2g car, and much much smaller than a S16g. Not only that, but the manifold/turbo flange is smaller; it's not even a 6cm2 housing, if I remember correctly. <br>  <br>  So no, it would not work in replacing your 16g. A TD05 turbo off a manual trans 1g would be very similar to what you have and are very easy to find in salvage yards and online.

EooU3QGnaa	For once I disagree with 45- the volvo stern drive was the most salt resistant of all marine drives. From the factory they had all heli-coil and stainless hex head fasteners. Their weakest link was allowing the water to get to the drive plate spline when the u-joint boot would rupture. Then you had a hard time getting the intermediate shaft out without destroying the drive plate.<br>  <br>  The drive it's self had a big bronze cone clutch which could be run forward or backward. So if it slipped, you just ran on the reverse face of it for a while. <br>  <br>  Personally I did not like the elect tilt they had.<br>  <br>  They did have a few "funnies"-- like the raw water intake manifold on the stern drive that came out of the water on plane and could suck air and over heat. <br>  <br>  If you have original volvo engines I'd stick with them, (6cy and the 4) if it has the 302 ford or the 305, 350 Chevy then change them out. If all gets running good, I would consider heat exchangers.|`|4KvLIa6Saa	If there all 1978 than best to look around and find some up dated running take outs> As those engines and outdrives have out lived there life spans > Just my thought>Unless they have only been if fresh water>Not salt water>

Tell them to throw it in with the deal. Ford has a recall on them because of a bad batch that was put in the motors. The tip of the injector has been known to break off after 5,000 - 10,000 miles. Great trucks tho. I'm trading in my 03 for a new one next week.|`|6RuuSkDkaa	navistar/international  its the new 6.4 twin turbo that replaced the 6.0 last year  if your in the market for a diesel you should really check it out  i had a 7.3 powerstroke foe years and test drove an 08 and bought it on the spot  the new superduty rides and handles like a car  the new powerstroke is quiet and sounds and performs like a gas engine withe the durability reliability and power of a diesel  im really impressed|`|JdGOsdXtaa	If the vin comes up when they run OASIS then the unit falls under the recall. The build dates for the units was from may 08 thru oct 08. The tips did not break off I love where people get there info from. They have an issue with the o-ring that seals the solenoid to the base, the o-rings were not diesel fuel friendly and would fail. International changed the o-ring and never said anything to Ford until they were replacing a ton of engines due to overfilled crankcases. The injectors with the tips gone are a result from the engines running away from the overfilled crankcase, if he ever removed the head from one (which i have done dozens upon dozens) he would have found the pistons too were starting to melt.
KxamRvReaa	To put it in as simple form as possible it is:  You have and engine block which houses your pistons.  It is the pistons that actually drive the engine crank that transfers energy to your transmission.  The "heads" as you put it sit on top of the block. The heads consist of at a minimum of 2 ports per piston.  One for the fuel air mixture and one for the exhaust.  Timining in an engine is set such that on every other stroke of the piston the engine is exhausting or combusting.  When the piston 1 is beginnning at the top of the stroke a port(or valve) is opened(this is in the head) which allows the fuel air mixture into the piston chamber.  When timing is correct the spark from the spark plug ignites the mixture which drives the piston down.  The port is then closed.  When the piston comes up again the the other port opens which allows the combusted materials(exhaust) to exit the chamber.  The idea behind porting and polishing had to do with having the area in the head that gases enter and exit the chamber are clean and smooth.  Typically, porting is done if your increasing the size of the valve seat area.  After a lot of mileage the flow of gases tends to wear out the seats(They don't stop the gases, they seep through....very inefficient) of the valves and in order to be efficient larger valves are installed.  Or in the case of racing/high performance you may want greater fuel/air delivery and exhausting capability.  This would in effect raise the rpm of the engine.  Polish is what it sounds like.  Make the metal smooth.

Buy your truck from a reputable dealer, get a Carfax report on the truck you are looking at  (most dealerships offer this free of charge to their customers) & have a trusted mechanic look the vehicle over BEFORE you buy it.

wra8Q7O3aa	Since your going to buy the Eclipse GT 3.0L 210bhp one then I believe you can put just bolt ons like intake and exhaust and headers, etc. Its a V6 engine and its powerful. You can turbo charge it by going to a local tuning shop to custom make a turbo kit for you though. A lot of eclipse 4 cylinder one had done this many times by just going to a local tuning shop. Engine swapping will probably be out of the question if you really have only 4g's. Theres really nothing much out there besides just rebuilding your engine and getting a custom turbo made. If I was you with the 4gs, I would go visit a local tuning shop to see how much is to make a custom turbo kit for the v6 eclipse. If its beyond 4gs, I wouldn't take it and use that for later or just use on completely bolt ons but still will gain enough power. If its lower than 4gs, make sure it comes with everything provided. But just run it on low boost.<br>  <br>  The IS300 are one powerful v6 cars and their sedans too and there RWD. The eclipse v6 (the one your getting) is fwd. But the looks just doesn't get to me though. The 240sx I would get anyday EVEN without the sr20(as long as its in good condition). You can do a swap out less than 2g with labor at a local tuning shop. Which will bring your 240sx with nearly 220 bhp and turbo'd. My cousin has one with sr20 redtop for s13, and is already achieved 400 whp which is fast, but he said its a beast and a beast at gas eating and uses it at special occasions only. I didn't get one because I just don't have the time to build a 240sx.|`|XMOwmWM0aa	Go to this forum<br>  <a href="http://www.eclipseforums.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.eclipseforums.org/</a><br>  <br>  ask ur question in there they are eclipse fanatics they can give u the best info about ur car  u can also get parts for cheat in the buy sell trade area|`|OZh2TtwHaa	port and polish the head, bore the cylinder walls out 40-60 over, pully kits,titanium lifters and valves,cold air intake, NOZ, header, 3 inch pipe al the way back, t-sodo racing exust ,,,, or just go get a crate motor

xMnN99T8aa	No such thing as a 2200 watt amp. Car audio is unregulated as far as the labeling goes. Home audio must be labeled in RMS watts, a measurement of "average" watts and also must be labeled per channel. Car audio usually is reported in peak to peak total watts. This is totally misleading as to the real power. Two channels =1100 watts peak to peak per channel. Cut that in half for the peak, or 550 watts peak per channel. RMS of that is about 385 watts per channel in real life. Then you have to know if your amp is good,as in high current output, or if it's crap as in low current/high voltage. I suspect it's a piece of crap, because, good amp manufacturers  don't BS you with watts. A high current amp like a Rockford Fosgate with 50 watts per channel will blow the doors off your 2200 watt amp. Current is expensive to produce, voltage is cheap to produce. The price of a good amp will reflect the quality. FYI. Watts = volts x current, so, if you have 100 volts and 1 amp, you have 100 watts and a bad amplifier. But if you have 100 amps and 1 volt, you have a (rocking and expensive) great amplifier. Don't be fooled. A cheap amp will distort early (called clipping) and burn up your speakers.|`|bADgVLswaa	It would be ok for two of the subs you mentioned. One sub wired parallel to each channel on the amp. For only one sub, it would be ok but turn the gain on the amp down and turn it back up SLOWLY so as not to overdrive the sub and maximize output. This amp puts out 550 watts rms per channel at 2 ohms and 375 watts rms at 4ohms.
qO5xm5BSaa	my bad, ok we do have an amp , put the amp gain up to 100 percent and the deck should pick up the subs at a much lower setting|`|Q4NFFBizaa	take it to a car audio store and have them tune it for you!|`|7ObGOaPPaa	your woofer is probably underpowered.<br>  <br>  try turning the bass up from -3. you might not have the subwoofer hooked up to the sub level.<br>  <br>  also turning the gain up will help also. if it really is that quiet, then you shouldn't have to worry about turning the gains up too high.<br>  <br>  also one more thing would be to check the setup, and make sure everything is wired correctly.

Getting the license at 16 is considered a privilege contingent upon you meeting the extra requirements such as driver training, parental consent, staying in school, etc.<br>  <br>  You would also get a ticket and a fine, and I think maybe the parents get fined, too, because they were supposed to adequately supervise the driving instruction according to the permit.<br>  <br>  It is probably similar in Kentucky--certainly not worth taking a chance!|`|a1566efb5533aa90596e330bc315a547aa	It has nothing to do with the state.

NjEfPMOsaa	O.K then, the cylinder miss detected-cylinder number four. Is saying that the number four spark plug is not producing any spark the cylinder is basically dead with out a spark, no spark no combustion no power. The Power train code is basically the same thing. The ignition system code is saying that it could be the ignition coil, are the ignition wires that are causing the problem. the other three BB2, Is saying it could also be a vacuum leak in or around the vacuum lines, and or emission lines. BB3,is saying possible low or no fuel coming through the fuel injector. and BB4, is  basically indicating how the fuel pressure is reading during the time  the number four plug is failing. Now the last three codes could be due to the ignition failure. You could try a basic tune up or a complete tuneup, being the basic is just changing the plugs only.  or changing the ignition wires and distributor rotor button, and  replace the fuel filter and have a fuel system cleaning done. Most basic tune up average cost is around 90.00 to a 150.00$ and a complete on your truck depending on the motor size could cost between 250.00 to 450.00 $. Try to use a national chain type of repair centers they usually have good deals and they have good warranty and there all over the U.S. Look for the ASE certificates on the wall this well tell you if they have quality  experience techs. I hope this was some help to you guys. Good luck and God Bless.|`|51d9e39c71aaaed7424c9ac49e9069c5aa	Simply interpreted, it means that cylinder #4 is misfiring. <br>  This can be caused by the ignition system, the fuel injector or it could be a mechanical problem with the engine.<br>  Start simple - have the spark plugs replaced. If this has a coil-on-plug system, swap the coil and electrical plug from #4 with an adjacent coil.<br>  If the concern is still present, have it rechecked. If the misfire swapped cylinders, replace the coil.|`|WfSDUNGyaa	Modern vehicles are equipped with coils directly above spark plugs...exeeding a lethal 80,000 volts while yes being at milliamps but still enouph volts to kill. i just wanted to put that out for fun<br>  <br>  but how does a spark plug contribute to shaking, more like a bubbled tire to meor missalignment. ehh modern day **** sucks friggin 350 smallblocks with coils and distributors baby....22re is also an exeption for me.|`|htsQ6HXCaa	1The very first test that you can do is(and the cheapest) is go buy yourself a good brand fuel injector/fuel system cleaner, Gumout does good. Read instructions. Throughout driving, see if this fixes anything.<br>  <br>  2Next check for a vaccuum leak. In general, just look under the hood at hoses and tubes. If there are any disconnected, cracking, or broken ones. Have it replaced. See if anything is fixed.<br>  <br>  3Check your spark plug wires. Follow each wire check if there are any burns, meltings, tears, of breaks. If you find a bad one, replace it. They usually come in a pack, so youll just replace  them all.<br>  <br>  4Next check your spark plugs, they could be fouled out. Take each one out and inspect them. They should be a dark color. You can find a chart somewhere on the net to see what could possibly be wrong with it. Or take them to a auto parts store and they should help you.<br>  <br>  5Last could be your ignition coils or your crank position sensor. The only way to check these is by replacing them. Which is costly, but if none of the above solved your problem. This is the solution usually.<br>  <br>  Good luck, hope this helps.|`|QrD8toduaa	go to auto store buy some new spark plugs, new wires and put them in. its not that hard. if its more than that leave it to the pro's.|`|Drkql0syaa	Always go with the cheapest & most obvious thing first. And  It looks as though you need to change the Spark Plugs & Spark plug Wires. It appears that spark plug #4 is mis firing.-. If you intend to do it yourself You can buy the parts cheap & Kragen/Chucks or Napa. I'd call around for the best price. If you have a mechanic do it, shop around for that too. If you are trying to save money, (aren't we all?) let them know that you are low on funds. They should be able to do it for about $60.00. That's parts included.|`|c11fee07c98ac2e271f2ab5acd400781aa	Plugs, ignition coils (I doubt that engine uses plug wires), check injector function and compression.<br>  <br>  That's what goes into causing a misfire.|`|AA12261615	whats causing the problem can be any of the above that you just named off,id start though by replacing the spark plugs in it if you know for a fact that they haven't been replaced in a while,then check the out put of the coil for that cylinder that's miss firing,a bad plug or bad fuel injector or a wire could be causing that too happen,but without trying to replace the plugs and see if that helps it i couldn't tell you to go buy a bunch of parts just to be putting on it and see if they work,adding new plugs cant hurt it only improve gas mileage and performance of it,if that doesn't help try switching coils from a good cylinder that fires and see if the miss fire follows to where you put the coil if it does you have found your problem,if it has a single coil pack it may have a bad coil,good luck with it.

First of all, clean out your idle air control valve and throttle body. If you have EVER had a trans fluid change, there is a good chance that the dummies that worked on it put some kind of universal fluid in, that has an improper viscosity or thermal characteristic for this "classic". Have someone drop your trans pan, and wash down the valve body with chlorinated brake cleaner chemical. This will get the clutch filings out of the way. Remember, your torque converter holds an additional 2-3 quarts of old, decomposed fluid. Sometimes, you have to change the fluid 2-3 times to improve the concentration of new/old fluid. Use only trans fluid that states, "formulated for use in GM cars." If it were me, I would use only Mobil One synthetic fluid here.

If you are low, you may have a leak, which will eventually damage your power steering.  Check the level, if it's low, top it off.  Check it again in a week and if it has gone down, you have a leak, which you will need a mechanic to fix.  I would say a few days normally, but where it's cold, the fluid will be less viscous and won't leak as fast.|`|SGDMvKGnaa	start with a power steering fluid flush. if it keeps doing it the pump is getting weak and needs to be replaced.<br>  i had the same thing in my car and the flush worked good.|`|AA11389246	Your belt is slipping.

AA11397643	tell them to pound sand and take it out of the gross profit. The law does require full disclosure when it comes to cars. Go over you contract again, it should be listed in the final part of the contract. As far as getting all the financing done, some times it takes 30- 90 days in some cases. Contact the owner of the dealership explain your case to him and see if that produces a desired effect. As far as payoffs go, me, I would all ways get a 10 day payoff and daily interest/ perdium so as to avoid any complications as that.|`|c11fee07c98ac2e271f2ab5acd400781aa	Are you really expecting legal help in this forum?<br>  <br>  You got messed over by a dealership that probably is teetering on closing down and they couldn't pay off your trade immediately.<br>  <br>  Yeah, that's out of our hands here.<br>  <br>  We could play lawyers here and do a good job of it, but that doesn't help you any.
3MTYGEbWaa	Not much chance. A score of 482 is terrible, and 622 is not much better. Maybe with a score of around 640 there would be a chance.

M9HoeFOcaa	To increase the speed of your computer, you need to buy more RAM (Random Access Memory) stick of probably 1 or 2 GB. This will increase your speed. If you are don't want to spend money for RAM, the other solution is to install free programs which free up RAM and increase system speed. But the former is the real solution for long-term.<br>  For the software, just search in google for "Freeware RAM Booster". You will get loads of free programs. Just install one of them. <br>  Good luck+|`|2x5t9c82aa	The speed on the computer!

dyIyJqauaa	In the USA, Assuming you mean  co-signer as in an auto loan. Co-signing for a loan has Absolutely nothing to do with liability issues in a wreck.  The owner(s) listed on the auto's title is liable.  If the auto was financed, the lender would have required insurance coverage and then the insurance will pay.  A loan co-signers liability is limited to paying off the loan ....If there was no insurance, the loan co-signer will still have to continue paying the lender until the loan is satisfied, whether the car has been junked or is being driven|`|kjAWsDwLaa	If you mean the cosigner on the auto loan, no, that's not part of the insurance.

28622Qgiaa	clr2316, I've always purchased an extended auto warranty for every car I've owned in the last 5 years.  I used to get them from the dealer, but I've found it's cheaper to get them from a auto warranty company. <a href="http://www.goodinternetdeals.com/Auto-Warranty.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.goodinternetdeals.com/Auto-Wa...</a> They offer free quotes, so it's easy to see how much one would cost for your automobile.|`|ikF1jZOdaa	GM will still exist if they go bankrupt, and your warranty will still exist.

S8HC6cyQaa	I'm 10 years younger than you and I know how to pump gas!!<br>  Please follow steps below:<br>  <br>  Step 1: Insert you credit card or debit card in to the card reader. If youre using debit hit debit or credit hit credit. If using a debit card when it asks you to enter a pin# then enter a pin number. Most pumps though ask for a zip code when it does enter your 5 digit billing zip code. If you pay in cash go inside make sure you lock your car so nobody will drive off with it. When youre at the cashier remember the pump# and give that to the cashier and say how much gas you want to purchase for example $ 20.00.<br>  <br>  Step 2 remove the gas cap<br>  <br>  Step 2: Select the grade, regular, mid-grade, or premium.<br>  Most cars only need the regular, but is would go with midgrade.<br>  <br>  Step 3: remove the gas pump from the pump<br>  <br>  Step 4: insert gas pump into car tank.<br>  <br>  Step 5: When finish pumping gas normally you know when the gas pump stops pumping gas automatically!<br>  <br>  Step 6: remove gas pump from car return to the pump. and tighten the cap on the car preferabbly 11 clicks.<br>  <br>  Youre Done!!|`|Gax0IIvOaa	It may sound silly but make sure you remember which side of the car the gas cap is on.  Some are on the drivers side while others are on the passenger side.  Its rare these days but some use to fill from the back behind the license plate.<br>  If the station has more then one person working just tell them its your first time.  You may have to wait a few minutes but I am sure they would rather show you and make sure its done right then lose a pump for the weekend.<br>  If you are a hotty, they will be really anxious to show you how "manly and smart" they are.  This is one of those times when acting like an airhead can payoff, but it shouldn't be required.<br>  Also make sure what kind of gas you need, it will say the fuel door or in the owners manual.  Some cars need Premium.<br>  Good luck, I'm sure you will be fine.|`|PmjeWyn2aa	Pull out the nozzle at the pump from the slot that says 87 or something like that. It might say regular. 87 is the octane. The higher the octane, the higher the cost. I'm guessing that regular gas will be fine for u. When u pull out the nozzle, the thing that it was sitting on, tilts up like a lever. Tilting this up, turns the gas on. The teller inside needs to turn it on also, so it might take a few seconds before it starts pumping. Pump as much as you want, then replace the nozzle to its slot by tilting the lever back down so that the nozzle will sit on it. Then just go inside and pay.|`|F5PUol8vaa	First of all, my congrats to your husband. Not only for his service, but for helping you learn to drive so quickly. And good for you for your dedication and hard work to learn.<br>  As for pumping gas, after you do it a couple of times, you will be teaching others. Have a little self confidence. The previous answerers have done a good job of explaining the mechanics of the gas pump. Read them all. I want to advise on the human standpoint.<br>  To begin, I recommend you not go out for the first time very late at night unless you are confident in the neighborhood. If the station is in a populated area and well lit and a not so high crime area, you should be ok. Get someone to go with you if possible.<br>  Don't be afraid to ask someone there for help. All they will do is say yes, or no. If they say no, ask someone else. Men will be more willing to help than women, usually. Have them watch you to make sure you do it right. After that, you should be ok. Then you can start to work on pulling in to a busy station. I have been driving over 40 years and I haven't mastered that yet.<br>  If you go to a convenience type station, it is possible the attendants are young and as inexperienced as you at pumping gas. Also they are probably not allowed to leave the register unless there are 2 or 3 of them in the store.<br>  When looking for some help, ask the man who is not alone first. Any man would not pass up the chance to "show off" in front of his buddies. A woman with small children will not be willing to leave her car. Teenagers are not a good choice to ask for help. They are always in a hurry. <br>  Happy motoring.|`|OF4FiIKPaa	Don't go at night or even when it's getting dark.  Call a good friend and explain your situation.  Ask them to ride to a gas station with you and show you how to pump gas step by step.  Then try it on your own with them watching.  If no friends can assist you be careful and ask someone at the gas station to assist you, preferably a store attendant if possible.  If not then ask someone who's already pumping gas.  Maybe a mother with children or something.  Someone who doesn't appear to be creepy.|`|VnFOCEgaaa	pull up to the pump, make sure the gas thingies are on the same side. Pay inside first.Tell them you want 10 dollars worth. Give them 10 dollars. Stick the nozzle of the gas pump in the gas tank. Squeeze the lower lever up with your fingers. You may have to push a bottun or something on the pump to turn it on. Just ask inside. I have to ask from time to time. Its no big deal. No one will make fun of you.|`|WfSDUNGyaa	Depending on whether or not the gas station is prepaid (most likely) you park your car with the gas fill next to the gas filler hose (make sure its a gasoline post and not diesel fuel). walk in, say the number pump your parked in front of, say how many gallons give them the money,walk out put nozzle firmly in the gas fill on the car. then press which octane (87 octane button) then just pull the handle on the nozzle and it should lock....then you can stand there and it will shut off automatuically. pull out the nozzle and put it back on the pump. drive away but dont forget to put the cap on.|`|l1bFKacmaa	Don't feel bad about not knowing something, we all have to learn sometime and since you have a condition that, until now, prevented you from driving it's understandable, I know people who've been driving for years and still do weird and unusual things at gas stations, don't feel embarrassed when you go if you're not as quick or "professional" as everyone else.   Anyways, when you drive up to the pump make sure the pump is on the same side of the car as your fuel door, try to park your car with about 2-3 feet between it and the pump and stop so that the pump is near the fuel door.   If you have a debit/credit card most stations will let you pay at the pump so you don't even have to go into the store afterwards.   Most gas pumps nowdays have a digital computer screen somewhere on the pump that will give you step by step instructions for that particular pump.  Different brand stations have different steps/procedures for activating the pumps so just do whatever the screen tells you.  Usually you slide your card in the card reader and remove it when the screen tells you to, then it will tell you when you can remove the nozzle from the pump.   Stick the nozzle in your fuel receptacle, then select the grade/type fuel you need for your car.   Unless your car has a sticker or a caution note in the owners manual saying you need a particular grade of fuel you can use any grade you want.   Once the grade is selected, squeeze the lever under the handle to start pumping fuel, almost all pumps have a second, smaller lever that you can swing into place to "lock" the nozzle in the "on" position and the nozzle will automatically shut off when your tank is full.   DO NOT get back into your car while the gas is pumping, this could generate static electricity and cause a spark -- not a good thing around gas fumes -- try to maintain contact with your vehicle, this will ground you to the car.   Once your tank is full, replace the nozzle in the pumping station, replace the cap on your car and shut the fuel door.   By the time all that is done your receipt should have printed out but some pumps will ask you if you want a receipt before it prints one, I would recommend getting a receipt when paying at the pump because that's your only proof that you paid for your gas.   Sorry this was so long, hope it helped!
