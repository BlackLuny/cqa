kO6nOtuEaa	People will never admit to being wrong are doing something hurtful. It's probably rumor are accusation that you know nothing about have a talk with a close friend by yourself and keep digging you will find the truth if there a good friend. There,s one one thing could it be paranoia?
iUzSlmSbaa	No that does not make you into a man hater.. but you are contradicting yourself.. I understand why.. you mean you don't want to be bothered by guys who walk up to you and ask for your phone number.. but if you want to meet a decent guy, which also exist..even if it's hard to believe,  you can't be against all men and think all men behave that way..     Do you work in a job where this can happen a lot that guys walk up to you and ask for your phone number?    Do you walk alone late in the evening in lonely areas.. and some drunks approach you and ask for your number.. in that case you are lucky.. don't ever walk on your own in streets which are not populated... after dark.. something more dangerous could happen that way than some drunk approaching you  and asking for your number    I am just trying to figure out why this happens to you a lot of times.. not to find fault with you?    I believe everyone should be allowed to dress the way they want.. but do you dress in mini skirts.. low cut tops... wear a lot of make up? I am not trying here to blame you for anything.. every girl has a right to wear what she wants and that does not make her into a bad person..  but it might attract guys more.. the wrong sort of guys.. if you do that..that's the only reason I ask.    Do you have to walk on your own...can't you go with a friend?    Do you look somehow ''vulnerable'' or shy when you walk on your own out there? that might again attract some weirdos to ask for your number.. if you walk with confidence at all times as if you always know where you are going.. not looking arrogant but looking confident..  then it's not very likely a guy will approach you...    Do you live in an area of city where there are a lot of bars or pubs nearby... (again trying to find out why when you walk this happens to you.. are all those guys coming from a bar or pub or are they on their way there.. is this a kind of poorer part of city you live in?    All I can advice.. don't believe that all guys are like that.. join a club or something.. maybe a hobby club.. try to make some friends that way.. even if it's female friends... if you socialize with nice people and they invite you to a party.. it is quite possible you meet a nice guy there..    I fully understand you don't want to be seen as a sex object.. and that you want to marry for love.. and not be approached as if you were some lady of the night...    Is it possible that this area where you are living some ''ladies of the night'' use that part as their patch... from where they allow customers to pick them up?''    Everything is possible.. because this happens to you so often... just walk with confidence.. Don't go out alone after dark..Always look businesslike as if you are in a hurry to get somewhere without looking at all frightned.. look confident.. but walk at a normal fast pace.. don't run.. don't look down...look confident.. consult your watch.. that makes others believe you have to be at a certain place at a certain time.. always take the long way back if this means avoiding little alleys or backstreets when walking home.. at any time of the day.. it seems to me it's the area where you live in... is somehow responsible for that to happen on such a large scale...    Happens to every girl that some stupid guy walks up and says something like.. Hi sweetheart... xxxxx happened to me as well...in a shopping mall even.. I try to ignore that.. try to ignore it..  as long as they only say something.. ignore them.. if they don't touch them..  just walk past them as if they didn't exist...There are nicer guys out there..this is not the norm. There are some freaks|`|32b5862608cd641eff2b289e3a95ca58aa	I wouldn't trust a guy who just randomly approached me on the street and asked for my number either!  You're just being smart by trusting your intuition...it doesn't mean you hate men.|`|cfvAJJqdaa	Okay first of all, unless you somehow meet somoene over the phone or internet, it is always going to be about looks- the first attraction.    Something must have happened in your past which has made you see men as a threat or maybe you were hurt by a man. It doesn't mean you're a man-hater it means men are reminding you of someone or something that happened in the past.    I can understand why you're fed up of being hit on, but I don't see why it would freak you out. They obviously think you are nice looking, and are making the first step towards having a loving relationship.    Relationships between couples have to start with either lust or friendship.     When they ask you for your number just say to them, actually I don't give it out but give me yours? You don't need to call them.|`|vUSLyZzZaa	no, u just don't want to be bothered now.|`|wbJXqkVGaa	No. it means that you have functioning brain cells....which is good:-)|`|ONWCXzUMaa	If some complete stranger comes up to you on the street yes I can see the way you feel. I don't think your a man hater, or you would not be a contact. But I would not expect you to take to me, if I did the same on the street as this other guy did either. You did the right thing.  take care  dave|`|xkD8z2hJaa	alright, i admit men can be a little hasty but when someone asks for your number just say that your looking for a serious relationship.
MQ3EyxQYaa	That's a really interesting question. I think it would depend a lot on the pheromones and chemical reactions that go on that cause us to become attracted to each other.     I have a feeling he would choose the more attractive girl. Society made her attractive or a reason ^^ But beauty is very subjective.
JdqDauEDaa	To see your husband in your dream, signifies the waking relationship with your husband and the unconscious feelings you have towards him. The dream may be trying to focus on hidden elements that you are not addressing in your waking life.    To dream that you have a husband (but you do not in your waking life), symbolizes some sort of partnership and/or commitment. Often, it is also representative of the qualities of your father in which you projected onto this figure or the masculine side of your own personality.     To dream that you are abandoned, suggests that it is time to leave behind past feelings and characteristics that are hindering your growth. Let go of your old attitudes. A more direct and literal interpretation of this dream is that you have a fear of being deserted, abandoned, or even betrayed. It may stem from a recent loss or a fear of losing a loved one. The fear of abandonment may manifest itself into your dream as part of the healing process and dealing with losing a loved one. It may also stem from unresolved feelings or problems from childhood. Alternatively, the dream indicates that you are feeling neglected or that your feelings are being overlooked. Perhaps the dream is a metaphor that you need to approach life with "reckless abandon" and live more freely.     To dream that your mate, spouse, or significant other is cheating on you, indicates your fears of being abandoned. You may feel a lack of attention in the relationship. Alternatively, you may feel that you are not measuring up to the expectations of others. This notion may stem from issues of trust or self-esteem.|`|1i5HLscqaa	Usually, it seems that dreams are extremely complicated and you have to do a lot of self analyzing and researching to try and figure out what the dream may have meant. But with this one, it seems pretty obvious - you feel like he doesn't love you anymore, and that he may be thinking of leaving you. But, if you're searching for him in your dream, it must mean that you still love him in real life, right? You probably just need to work on your marriage. You could try talking to him about it, or even seeing a marriage counselor.|`|bgi0AtiFaa	I think your dreams are a reflection of your fears. Instead of focusing on your dreams, focus on making him happy. Try for a week cooking him his favorite meals, wearing cute nighties to bed and pampering him. He'll be very grateful.     read "The Proper Care and Feeding of Husbands" by Dr. Laura Schlesinger
R0NfdgzLaa	people who judge your character by the blemishes on your face are superficial.  if they'd rather talk to a blemish-free skank, let them.  it's their loss.|`|S55mhoSgaa	uhh, well i dont know crap about dating, but yea i notice that too. I kinda accepted the fact that most ppl have some blemishes, but if it's kinda abnormal such as instead of just some pimples on ur face, it's like holes and hairs growing in weird places...yea.    To put it short, it's normal.|`|kANR98tIaa	umm no its not normal, i think its a disorder or something. I forgot what it is called, its like similar to the effects of longterm drug using.|`|6UmjlJHTaa	YES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!...|`|mxVq4mOeaa	i have this to!!! i resently asked a question like this and someone said it might be social axiety or somthing like that i forgot|`|xkD8z2hJaa	yes it is normal and some thing you can do is not care about what other people say or think but be yourself.
JdqDauEDaa	To see your grandmother in your dream, represents nurturance, protection, and unconditional love. Consider the qualities and characteristics that exist in your own grandmother.     To see a coffin in your dream, symbolizes the womb. It also signifies your thoughts and fears of death. If the coffin is empty, then it suggests that you are having some irreconcilable differences. Alternatively, the coffin represents ideas and habits that you are no longer of use and can be buried.    To see a body in a coffin, signifies that you are going through a period of depression. You may feel confined, restricted and that you are lacking personal freedom. There may be a dead or decaying situation or issue in your life that needs to be addressed. It is time to end this situation or relationship.|`|ZnfZiZyzaa	you could be feeling out of control,  thats what most scary dreams mean,  no shes not a ghost:).maby your really  just missing her, and emotionally cant get  over it, but mentally has already moved on.
JdqDauEDaa	Chase  To dream that you are being chases, signifies that you are avoiding a situation that you do not think is conquerable. It is often a metaphor for some form of insecurity. In particular, to dream that you are chased by an animal, represents your own unexpressed and unacknowledged anger which is being projected onto that animal. Alternatively, you may be running away from a primal urge or fear.    To dream that you are chasing someone, signifies that you are attempting to overcome a difficult goal or task. You may also be expressing some aggressive feelings toward others.     To dream that you are being watched, suggests that you are feeling confined in your work environment or personal relationship. You feel you are lacking a sense of privacy.|`|iIGOi2Idaa	No one can really answer this question but yourself as only you know what's going on in your head. What are you trying to get away from in life, or in your head? Who's controlling you? What does weather mean to you, and so what does it mean when it changes?    I always look to how I felt about the images in a dream to work out what they meant. Feelings don't always match the images. Over all I'd say this sounds like you've got some minor turmoil that your mind's trying to work out. Were you scared or even terrified when being chased? How did you feel about the metal giant controlling you - scared, or even angry? How exactly did the weather change, for the better or worse, and how did you feel about that?    Chalice|`|1i5HLscqaa	Now, none of what I found could have anything to do with you, but maybe if you do some in-depth personal analyzing you may find that some of this could be true?  To dream that you are being chased, signifies that you are avoiding a situation that you do not think is conquerable. It is often a metaphor for some form of insecurity.   To see iron metal in your dream, symbolizes harshness, anger, aggression, ruthlessness, and conflict. On a positive note, it may signify strength, endurance, and willpower.  To dream that you are at a park, represents a temporary escape from reality. It indicates renewal, meditation, and spirituality. You are undergoing a readjustment period after experiencing some serious personal conflict or an ending to a passionate affair.    To dream that you are being watched, suggests that you are feeling confined in your work environment or personal relationship. You feel you are lacking a sense of privacy.|`|DVB8XhCBaa	In your dream, dream up a SPAS-12 shotgun and blow Iron Man (lol) away. Same with the guy chasing you :)

0EUsaTfoaa	Most likely it is part of growing up.  I know that won't help but you can do things to help yourself.  When you start to get the negative thoughts change the subject and tell yourself you are not going to go that way.  Think of something funny or look at something and make it funny in your mind.  Keep it up and those negative thoughts will go away after a while.|`|dBkEqT2naa	Maybe it's because people who caused it are too cowardly to fess up and you're not going to associate with people who you know have been involved with him/her.|`|deb263b4b540e6e15eba4bdb58835e4aaa	We can't help you this way. You need to talk to a mental health professional.|`|tp61e25Eaa	Helping other people when you can will take your mind off of your worries. Life is filled with worries and it never seems to get any easier, but the fact that you are aware of this is good. You can control how you handle things. Just try to have faith and be stronger than the negative thoughts. If you let the negative win, that is what you will have in life. Embrace the challenge of overcoming the negative forces around you. Live like a salmon; swim upstream, the easy way is to let the negative in life carry you downstream. You do have the power to overcome many things in life, and the power to change many things as well.
JO8FKDRhaa	its a question of extent. if fear paralyzes you, and turns into... well... panic then its obviously a bad thing. some people handle fear better than others. i like being scared to the level that i dont even realize i'm scared, if htat makes sense. like scary movies and stuff. but when i'm afraid that someoens giong to do somethign really sreiously harmful or scared for my health. thats bad. but a litlte thrill here and there isnt bad|`|AA11773731	Being scared, even in a bad situation, invigorates the body. It's our natural reaction that allows blood to flow faster giving our brain and heart more oxygen to allow us to make quick decisions and react faster. Being scared can let you know you're alive.|`|DyeKk9HKaa	I've been in situations where being scared saved mine and other peoples lives. It is a justifiable reflex that everyone has.

WLPDJ3Npaa	because dreams don't work like that. You may never have that dream again. Or, you might have it 5 years from now.    Thinking about it probably is making it worse too.    Just sleep, and dream.
cWxwHMQWaa	If it works for you and you're happy, what's the harm?    Me and mine have always had our time apart, we go out without one another and it's not a big deal.    Plus, if you have single friends, going as a couple all the time can be really irritating. My friends all love the guy I'm with, some don't really wanna be around him all the time though, and same with some of his friends. We all get along, but that doesn't mean we have to be like one united entity where one *always* goes with the other.    I think for people where that works and they all enjoy it just as much, great. For most people I know though, we do our separate things without our partners some times.     Do whatever works for you & your partner/s, **** what anyone else says =o)|`|pzLDXL6gaa	It's not weird to not lose your identity - I'm about your age and the people I know have different groups of friends they go out with separately from their partner. Everybody needs time with friends, time with partner, and then time with partner in a bigger group. It would only be a problem if you think he's too close with any of those girls. And I have no idea if that's the case or not, so you have to decide. Sorry I've probably made you a bit paranoid too. If he's always had a lot of friends of both genders, but not been a massive flirt, it's probably okay.    Harriet|`|yUMH5u6daa	I think it's fine... did you want to be invited?

It's ok to have a little distance.|`|DpbZdIsUaa	It's entirely up to you but I think your mum only has your best interest at heart.  I'm probably around the same age as your mum.    I see it all the time as i work in a bar environment, guys that have boyfriends, even wives, but when they go out they are with others.    Two guys and two girls going out together is a recipe for disaster.    I personally know guys who sleep with other girls while they are in relationships.  One of whom just broke up with his girlfriend of 9yrs because she finally realised all the rumors about her dearly beloved were true.  He'd made her look like a complete idiot for 9yrs, sticking up for him when people accused him of it.    Such as the time he was had up for sexual harrassment in the work place.  There were about a dozen girls who all said the same thing but he told his girlfriend that they were all radical feminists and he'd only given them 'compliments' which they had taken as harrassment.     He didn't tell her that he was txting them asking them to go out for coffee and saying he wanted to make love to them.  Sorry, got a bit carried away with that explaination, but look at the answers from guys on YA!  Alot of them say they can't be just friends with female, there is usually a physical/sexual attraction to them!
JdqDauEDaa	To dream of hell, denotes that you may be suffering from a seemingly inescapable situation. You may have placed your decision or course of action into someone else's hand. Alternatively, you may be possessing a guilty conscious, some inner fears or repressed negative feelings. It is time to quit punishing yourself and take it easy for awhile.    To see your or someone else's pet in your dream, represents civilized instincts. You are keeping your temper in line. Alternatively, it indicates a need for love and acceptance. You are lacking attention from others and are feeling neglected. The pet may also be a pun for "petting" as in some sexual behavior.|`|44f971d7ae1936193e159c0b3819760baa	It means nothing at all, why do people still think dreams mean anything ?

JdqDauEDaa	To dream that you fall and are not frightened, signifies that you will overcome your adversities with ease.    To dream that you fall and are frightened, indicates a lack of control, insecurity, and/or lack of support in your waking life.

MgVKy8CUaa	Fantastic question.  Kudos to you for asking it while you're still in your 20s.  It's not something that has one clear answer.  There are a lot of layers this - the individual, family, upbrining, education, gender, fear, societal pressure, friends, perceptions, insecurities, human nature, and many more.  Also, maybe even more significant, there's also a herd mentality component to it, too.<br>  <br>  The way many people are brought up, having, striving, and achieving those things is often "perceived" as the true definition of a success adult.  Also, for some, the only way they can feel like a mature adult is by achieving those things or striving for them.  If they didn't have everything worked out in their 20s, they wouldn't be equal with their parents.  And with many girls, the only way they can truly be accepted and taken seriously is if they get married and have kids... like their family and friends.  <br>  <br>  Also, keep in mind that marriage and having a family is often perceived as the magic solution for many people who don't have everything worked out yet let on to others that they do and internally simply want to have everything worked out.  As a result, people get marruied and have kids for the wrong reasons completely. <br>  <br>  Here's a true story - After university, I left the mid-sized town I grew up in.  But while in college, all of my good friends - anywhere from 21, 22, 23 and so on - were planning to get married, settle down, have kids, get the perfect job and lead the life that they "thought" they were supposed to lead to be a complete and well-rounded individual.  They were all buying houses, taking out huge mortgages, buying expensive cars, having two or three kids, and leading the perfect life.  All huge decisions that have a major impact on your future, and the future of others, right?  <br>  <br>  And I remember standing back watching them and sitting down with them, asking, "So how do you know this is what you want?  How do you know you truly love this person after only eight months (sometimes less)?  How do you know that this is the right time to have kids?  What if you hate this job for the next 20 years, are you just going to tough it out for the sake of it?"  <br>  <br>  Flash forward 15 years, and all except one went through messy divorces, had to sell the homes, lost the big time jobs, ditch the cars, some are now single parents. and most have had to start over after a lot of pain in their lives.  All for what?  Because they didn't take a step back and actually think about what they were doing, thought they had it all worked out, and made most of their decisions for all the wrong reasons when they didn't even know who they were themselves at 22, 23, 24, etc.  <br>  <br>  The best advice one of my friends (not in this group) gave me was that there's no rule book of life that stipulates you have to buy a house in your 20s, have a great career in your 20s, have kids in your 20s, and lead what others deem is a perfect life.  Imagine getting married at 22 only to then find your true soul mate at 28.  How tragic is that?  <br>  <br>  I'm not painting everyone into this, some people do have everything worked out in their 20s.  But if you look deeper, there's usually a reason.  One of my friends wanted to be a doctor, had everything worked out, and he's been a doctor for the past 17 years. <br>  <br>  There's nothing wrong with striving for any of it.  A lot of people simply think they have everything worked out, don't really know themselves well enough to make such major decisions, and don't give themselves time to figure out what they want in life or what's right for them.<br>  <br>  The fact is, there is no big rush.  I didn't know what I really wanted in life until I was in my 30s and I'm glad I didn't rush into anything because most of what I do now comes from knowing what I don't want in life... which I found out in my 20s.  But that's just me.... everyone's different.|`|AA12231462	Yes it is something I hear talked about a lot at the moment that young people who are getting married now want it all at once - whereas my own generation -I am now a granny - were happy to do up one room at a time and start with second hand stuff -I still haven't ever bought a new settee.<br>  <br>  I hear a lot of children talking about wanting to be rich when they grow up rather than what they want to achieve - It does seem weird. I agree with you what is there to look forward to?|`|LKiVXEcCaa	AMEN!! All good things come in time. Its just the way were breed once something new, or better, or bigger comes out we have to get it.... a new car comes out we have to get it, or a new gaming Console, or the damn tickle me elmo that one christmas everyone HAD to have. I think the way the economy is now, people are starting to take a step back and see this|`|mDYsr62maa	I know I wished I was 25 at age 50, but only if I retained the knowledge of the missteps along the way.|`|NAGiNKFWaa	Well you have a good point, but it is not new to this generation.  All 20-year-olds through the years wanted it all and fast.  They didn't realize that their parents didn't get everything they owned all at once.  I think the dilemma with this generation is that they did get a lot of things fast.  My niece had her own computer before she could even write.  By age 12, she has her own tv and vcr/dvd player.  She has a newer computer now too.  She has a cell phone and a lot more possessions at her age than I did by my 20's.  I think kids these days get a lot of things at a young age, so realistically, they have little left to dream of achieving.  I think the cost of things these days is more extreme.  I would never be able to afford a car or a house with today's prices.  A decent car is going to cost you over 20,000.00, and won't last you as long.  Nothing these days last as long.|`|qThmcR1Aaa	Honestly, I think it's the way a lot of kids this age have been raised. Yes, I know it's a stereotype, but it's true that much of Generation Y has a strong sense of entitlement. And a lot of that has to do with the way they were raised. Schools focused on self-esteem, and parents who felt guilty for leaving their kids at daycare all day made up for it by lavishing their kids with praise and material things. Basically, if they wanted it, they got it.<br>  <br>  And that expectation has carried over into their adult lives. They were raised to think they could get anything they wanted, whenever they wanted it ... and not just that, but they *deserved* it. To a lot of young people today, "paying your dues" is incomprehensible. You want it all, you want it now, and how dare anyone get in your way.<br>  <br>  That's my observation as a Gen Xer working around a lot of Gen Y folks. They have a peculiar outlook on the world. Highly narcissistic and materialistic, in my opinion.
8d8ejHPfaa	Hi Jophiel, In my personal practice, I am eclectic Pagan as well, in the larger scheme of things I consider myself to be a Universalist...<br>  I don't think there is any particular significance to the order in which the dreams were presented.  You think about spiritual ideas on a regular basis, and also seem to be of a Universalist bent, perhaps you were simply enjoying the beauty to be found in a more traditional religion, and comparing it alongside with some less traditional ideas such as getting to know someone by writing their astrological signs on the board, instead of their names.... of course there is also the possibility you could have been Jewish in a past life...<br>  Hm....if there is any one idea that seems to connect the two, it's the idea of "community" (Jewish community, Pagan Club).  Are you a Solitary (I am), or do you belong to a Circle, Grove, CUUPs or some other group?  If a Solitary, perhaps that's what is going on here, perhaps you have a desire to be connected to a larger community of like minded folks.... Just a thought...<br>  Blessed Be )O(|`|xggSASTwaa	well i have a dreamers almanac and this is what is says: <br>   <br>         Titled: Religious Rites and ceremonies<br>  If you were a member of a dream congregation, participated in, or witnessed, a religious rite, your dream reaction is paramount. Depending on your current situation, the feeling of being comforted, or uplifted, or blessed could either donate your joy at being in harmony with prevailing moral code or, alternatively, a deep-rooted desire to fall in line with the attitudes and beliefs of the rest of the flock. Or it could also mean that you might feel restricted if you were in line reciting prayers.<br>  <br>  hope this helped!|`|H9zCmv81aa	That's a hip religion, i want to join the ecletic blend of judaism, with a sprinkle of satanism, with an uber overture dabble of taoism.  j/k get to know Jesus Christ my friend, you'll never have to search for some "cool" religion again, oh yeah and you'll be saved.|`|874EAxkfaa	the world is truly full of blind fools!|`|sIhPpdv3aa	It seems to me that you are thirsting to deepen your spirituality! Your subconscious isn't sure which path you really want to take, so it was "trying them on". Trying to decided what you really want.<br>  <br>  I would suggest you do the same thing in real life... try them on. Learn more about what it is to be Jewish. Learn more about what it is to be pagan. It sounds like you are feeling a need to commit (since in both dreams you were committed to one rite) and you are feeling a need to learn more (performing a rite in a hall, learning in a class) but you aren't ready to decided yet.<br>  <br>  Personally, I'm a Roman Catholic. I get a kick out of learning the aspects of my faith and finding how the traditions work (or don't work) with my spiritual, emotional and psychological needs as a human being! <br>  <br>  Go on and seek that you may find. Do some reading. Take a class on Judaism or Paganism. Then you can decided what to do next and what you really need.
32Uyhmggaa	Obama is governing by fear, something he promised not to do.<br>  <br>  People are what essentially drive financial markets, not businesses, and not government. People are the ones that decide to invest in companies and help spur innovation. Obama is prolonging this recession by convincing people the situation is a failure of capitalism, and not just a bump in the road. Obama is a powerful speaker, and people listen to him. If he says we're doomed, people listen. Obama needs to take the responsibility of having the power to manipulate people more seriously, or this country may sent into another depression.<br>  <br>  But of course, spending almost a trillion dollars to curb a recession in an economy that is already one trillion dollars in debt is sort of misguided as well. This stimulus package was never meant to "stimulate" the economy. It was meant to get some spending in that the left couldn't get in when Bush was in power. A stimulus package that does not invest directly in infrastructure will certainly prolong this recession. <br>  <br>  They use Keynesian economics to justify their actions, but Keynes said that the only thing the government should spend money on is infrastructure. Spending money and offering tax breaks to people that buy "green golf carts" is amusing, but not good for the economy.<br>  <br>  Obama is putting us in very dangerous territory. We need to have a little more faith in the free markets, and let the recession work itself out. Government intervention will simply make this recession worse than it already is.|`|uxT5okWKaa	I do believe the people are being spooked into saving their money rather than spending it. Is that really a bad thing though?? It is hurting the economy at the moment, but it is also teaching people NOT to rely on a very irresponsible government that wants us to spend, spend, spend!
QRPvIB8Yaa	Well actually thats just not true. The LGBT movement had to fight to be included in the feminist agenda as well. It was only through consistint campaigning of radical feminists who were lesbians that it became a part of the line in NOW. <br>   Its much easier for the LGBT movement and womens movement to marry because they agree on a lot of things such as male oppression and sexuality. Now if you look at lot of the mens rights activists they are not only in favour of mens rights but are traditionalist and want to reverse or stop the feminist project in its tracks. They are not interested in co-operation polarising them from the feminist movement|`|dmCyY2SKaa	I've noticed that feminists like to align themselves with other "oppressed" groups in an attempt to demonize straight white men "the patriarchy".<br>  <br>  I also notice that feminists sweep some injustices and oppression under the rug if it doesn't fall in line with their patriarchy/bogeyman theories. So it's not even about advocating the civil and human rights of all people, but about selectively choosing which people deserve their attention, and which people don't. If feminism can't use a person's oppression/suffering to further itself politically, then that person's oppression/suffering might as well not exist.|`|XwqePXrOaa	Obviously this is an attempt at a straw-man argument.<br>  <br>  You and I both know that almost everyone (save for a couple psychopaths) will agree that being supportive of homosexuals and unsupportive of heterosexuals is bigotry (unfortunately, not so many would agree about the other way around - our society still has some progress to make in that area).<br>  <br>  So why try to tack this on 'feminists?'<br>  <br>  If you were to elaborate on what exactly constitutes being "supportive" or unsupportive of someone and cite an example of what you're talking about, we might have an interesting discussion here.  (Given that I've never actually been oppressed as a heterosexual person, I'd be genuinely curious what you're talking about.)  But it seems that, as with many questions, the focus is more about the people who disagree than it is about the issue itself.|`|YQOT68xFaa	Hooo boy, I'm not touching this one with a ten-foot pole!<br>  <br>  But maybe I'll star it and see if Trevor decides to stalk me. lol

The best I can do for you is answer in a "If this were my dream" format, and you can fill in the gaps.<br>  <br>  1. How did you feel with these people? Were they strangers or people you know? If you know them, consider your relationship with them. How do they make you feel? Are you facing issues with any of them?<br>  <br>  Your brother's dog - a symbol of friendship or loyalty between you, perhaps? - had a sharp object in his head, one that cuts an object cleanly into two parts, in this case the mind. Have you been facing a dilemma of any sort lately? Have you had any problems with your brother?<br>  <br>  Perhaps there is something you or your brother need to make your mind up about. A divided mind speaks to me about decision making.<br>  <br>  2 - I am looking at an image of a child I might or might not give birth to, which also has a pair of scissors in it's head. If this were my dream, it might mean I have a choice - wether to let doubts be born into my mind, or the opportunity to make the right decision about something.<br>  <br>  3 - My life partner / other half and I are being made to go into the army - which could very well represent war. I am upset and do not want to go.<br>  <br>  Could your dreams be tapping onto the image of your husband as the representation of the Animus? Let me explain: The animus are all those traits in a woman that she's been told are masculine and not for her.  A man would have an anima--all of those designated-feminine traits that he has been told not to develop.  <br>  <br>  (Sometimes women raised sternly to be tomboys will also have an anima--feminine traits they've been told to "overcome".)  We're all taught to disown them, yet ultimately we need them, in order to be full, complete human beings.<br>  <br>  It's a tricky relationship, nevertheless.  We can't let the animus seduce us, because then we become parodies of the worst sorts of male stereotype. (The same thing happens in reverse to a man seduced by his anima.)<br>  <br>  Perhaps, then, if my Animus and I are being made to go into fighting mode there are some aspects in myself I need to balance out so that I can give birth to a better me.<br>  <br>  Women who have completely driven out their animuses are too weak, too docile, to accomplish anything.  They might get lots of ideas on what they want to do next, but they can't seem to find the energy to build any kind of reality from those ideas.  The animus carries all of their energy.<br>  <br>  In the same fashion, the man who banishes his anima banishes creativity.  He has plenty of energy, but it goes nowhere.  He squanders it in the bar or at the race track or in minor league sports, all sorts of manly but unproductive ways, but he never quite gets the inspiration to do something constructive with it.<br>  <br>  For the record, other ways that the animus or anima might get people in trouble is if they forever pursue fantasy lovers that no real lover can compare to, or if they seek the traits of an animus or anima in flesh-and-blood lovers, which leads to spousal abuse, because the inner masculine or feminine can be a holy terror if not approached properly.|`|xggSASTwaa	I have a book about dreams, and i cant really find anything like that. I took some psychology classes and what I would say is that these dreams repersent your feelings about all the things you hold dear. Maybe subconsiously you are afraid that you wont be able to take care of everything once the new baby is born. Maybe you were thinking of all the responsibilities or something. I definitly think it has to do with you being a little nervous about the baby.

In a general fashion, however:<br>  <br>  Horses - Power, and movement. This power may run wild or be tamed and bring a particular benefit.<br>  <br>  Wind - Pure movement and power again. It can be like a gentle caress, or a wild storm (tornadoes, anyone?). Either way, you cannot control it, but you can use it for a benefit (windmills, sailing, etc.)<br>  <br>  A beautiful, sunny day - a positive, pleasant experience. Hapinness.<br>  <br>  Stalking - Something following you in a negative way. Alternatively, you may be 'following' someone or something, which, though you realize it not, can be very hurtful to you (both).|`|OYZDAyihaa	Go to this sight, you can type in anything and get the meaning for free.|`|RyYV3aXlaa	nothing, nothing and nothing...that's why its called a dream ....|`|xJyEhiHeaa	it means your ether going to find your true love and he or she is going to be hot as heck or you want to go out with some one but there going to ask you first just as fast as the wind and as smooth as a horse.|`|XH1YkgqPaa	1 u smoked too much pot<br>  #2 maybe used some crack<br>  #3 possibly some drinking involved<br>  #4 all of the above|`|ULLUZzmraa	just go on the site they have the answer for you.|`|FlgTkLn0aa	wind can mean you have some unresolved issues in your life|`|zJHrFBtNaa	Look on:<br>   <a href="http://www.dreamcrowd.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.dreamcrowd.com</a> <br>  Hope This Helped! :)|`|LBdqqISCaa	anyones guess.
xGb2CBgkaa	of the people who are saying the best thing to do is nothing, none are experts.  most are politicians and idealogues who don't know anything about economics and apparently don't know much about u.s. history either.  <br>  <br>  i'd say the policy response of the government has been pretty level headed.  they've pretty much made the right moves.  <br>  <br>  currently, the two big unknown threats that could turn this recession into a much more severe one is deflation and housing.  the banking sector is an obvious one but it's survival as a non-nationalized entity hinges on where housing goes.  <br>  <br>  the impact of the us is so big, that if they can't solve this, it will start a global banking calamity that will bring waves of economic crises, and further implode global trade.<br>  <br>  this is why the policy response is so big.  the magnitude of the risk and the problems are at an unprecedented scale.|`|VuaOKpYXaa	Do nothing.

EDLRhh01aa	Hypnosis is nothing more than an "altered state of consciousness" and is completely natural for all human beings. For example, everyone goes  into a Hypnoticic state at least twice a day (when we wake up and fall asleep). At those times the brain-wave  cycle per second activity actually slows down and speeds up, causing that dreamlike state of semi-consciousness we interpret as "being half-asleep" Research shows that most of the time when you are watching TV or a movie, you are actually in a light hypnotic state.|`|O3i7zJB2aa	Yes of course it works if the hypnotist is good.

For example, spelling the name snake, reading it outloud, seeing picture, seeing a snake from far away, holding a snake....    Sometimes we may be so preoccopied on why we do something but no action to correct it.|`|9YfhGWMMaa	Lol, ur the exact same as me. don't worry, it's perfectly normal! im with you here:)|`|LQ6nBJkGaa	perhaps because there one of the most deadly animals    but snakes are nice XD|`|s8wsFeA0aa	some snakes are scary and dangerous but lots aren't when i was 6 i was in the girl guides and they brought a whole bunch of harmless snakes, one of them was so huge he was on like 10 six year olds' laps at the same time it was so cool. if all snakes were dangerous they wouldn't have let 6 year olds touch and hold them. as long as they're trained they're fine|`|HyulW3aiaa	Perfectly normal in Britain because you grow up without exposure to these vile creatures. In Durban,South Africa,if you need the loo at night,you always put on the light first,check your slippers and floor etc before moving.Often drawer the curtains and a green mamba falls down.Generally a snake is more scared of you and won't bother you unless cornered-except for a puff adder-he's lazy and well camouflaged so doesn't give way so you step on him and he bites.Cytotoxin.Look at this-very interesting:|`|ADYR3KuHaa	Try and be near them, face your fears
AJeaWX8Paa	I think you're confusing standard deviation with a confidence interval.  Do you know you have an above average IQ?  I don't think you can extrapolate your IQ score from a relative comparison of other people.  I would recommend taking an IQ test and seeing where you fall.  The test will give you a number, which will have some range of error associated with it.  That error is not going to be the range that you're talking about 85-115.  It'll be much smaller.|`|94NYYq5Haa	IQ is on a normal curve, most psychological attributes are distributed the same throughout the population.  This means that there is considerable variability in the population, which is expected.  Not everyone is going to have the same IQ.  And confidence intervals are not the same as the standard deviation.  Confidence intervals are determined based on how much % correct you want your decision to be.  so, being 99.9% sure of your score would me you need a pretty wide confidence interval.  There is error in any type of test and actually IQ tests are some of the most reliable and valid psychological tests there are.  We can never be sure what a person's true score is.  Using different norms for above average and below average people won't change the fact that test scores contain error.  Score ranges are better because it avoids putting a number on something when we can't really be sure that number is correct.|`|AA10287830	I agree but haven't the foggiest idea how to change the standards.  I rank in the genius category but both my sons are much smarter.  They missed the genius category by 15 points!
iUzSlmSbaa	I don't think that has anything to do with subconcious message.. you know the driving and are not nervous there.. you probably did not prepare so well to study for the theory.. that's  why you failed.. I am sure that the majority of people who fail in a driving test fail the practical part due to being too nervous.. I never took driving lessons but I am sure everything to do with theory I pass.. I am not sure that I would not fail on the road with an instructor by my side.. due to nerves... If you know all the practise it should now be easier for you to understand the theory...because you know what you have to do when you drive... so if you know all the signs and their meanings and what you have to do in practise in certain situations.. then you only have to read the questions carefully all the way through and if those are multiple choice questions.. study well for it.. you have now an idea what kind of questions will be asked.. Just learn all that.. and ask a friend once you are pretty confident you understand it.. to ask you random questions.. then you get an idea how good you are in theory.. if you are right in most answers then I would give theory another try.. and in multiple choice questions.. if you practise hard and study hard .. then follow your gutt feeling when you are uncertain.. follow your first instinct. but read all possibilities carefully.. eliminate what seems unlikely.. and if you have to make a decision between 2 answers go with what sounds right to you.. don't change it later most of the time if you studied well and still are uncertain.. your first instinct is right.. stick with that...and don't miss out on answering any question if they are multiple choice questions.. if you don't answer at all you definitely don't get points.. if you answer you always have a chance to get it right...just by guessing..|`|nvsVXlBlaa	get some practice and try again|`|lSAdkvDFaa	It depends upon how much you want to pass and become a driver.

72H4hFaHaa	Maybe you should look at your sister first. Looks to me like she's the ugly one. I can't help but suspecting that she is jealous of something (or some things) that you have and she hasn't. Maybe its integrity, likable personality etc.?  You know good looks aren't everything. A friendly, helpful personality (which your sister seems to be lacking) overcomes many beauty flaws.    Now to your main question:  'Most people confuse selfishness with self-love. That might be one reason you find self-love so hard to accept.  Self-love is something you develop (like love for another person)  First take a good look at yourself (not your physical self, but your character traits) There will be things you like and things you don't.   Change what you can and accept the rest (like you would with a close friend) -   As a matter of fact: why don't you treat yourself as your best friend -  because that is what you are and that is basically what self-love means.  Know that nobody is perfect - so you don't have to be perfect either.  Here's a little trick:  Whenever you have doubts or negative thoughts about yourself, sit down and put a chair next to you.   Imagine your closest friend sitting in it - with your problem.   (If you don't have a closest friend - invent one)  Now give him/her the best advise you would think of - and then apply it to yourself.  As with most things - practice makes perfect.|`|dBkEqT2naa	To ignore losers who act like fascist nazis.|`|J0RJ3MS7aa	genes pay a large role in your personality.    fortunately and unfortunately, i'm the aggressive type. so aggression leads to more confidence but aggression can lead to think that you're too good for everyone else.    i stopped caring a long time ago.    just be more agggressive in sports, then apply that to everyday living. it's a start|`|JO8FKDRhaa	well you said confidence and self acceptance/ love. are you having trouble with both? well my recommendation is to go off and do things that challenge yourself. when you are able to succeed at something that challenges you, you will have more self confidence and be more happy with yourself. so if you always wanted to back pack across Europe but you've been too afraid, do it! if you always wanted to hang out with a certain crowd of people, well make your best attempt and keep up the positive self talk even if you fail. if you want a different career, go out and apply for jobs, seek info about education. do something challenging and make yourself proud|`|OFZh3GlVaa	jack daniels|`|14dc5a2caf80531c380c037d989d53edaa	Listen to the terms "confidence" and "self-acceptance".   To become confident in something one must be assured that it is what one perceives it to be?  Does this "fit" you relative to your perceptions of yourself?    Self-acceptance?   I do not believe this is what you have trouble with because self-acceptance merely means that one accepts that oneself is, period.  Now if we are talking about whether or not the "self" one is talking about is acceptable then that is another matter, is it not?    The killer of self-acceptance is ones "expectations".  Holding certain expectations, and then not being able to meet these is a prime way ones MIND keeps ones discontent.    Best to simply love ones Soul and then laugh at ones life that ones Fate Karma puts one through.   Life is too important to take too seriously.    Peace

MQ3EyxQYaa	Bipolar disorder or manic depression is when a person goes through major "ups" and "downs." So this person will feel on top of the world and ready for anything one day and then the next he or she may not want to get out of bed. Schizophrenia is a more serious mental disorder caused by (some believe) a chemical imbalance in the brain. There are many kinds of schizophrenia, the most serious involving auditory or visual hallucinations. And finally. MPD or dissociative personality disorder is controversial as to whether or not it actually exists. But if it does, it occurs when an individual is traumatized as a child and therefore, he/she creates other personalities to suppress these experiences and to protect him/her self.    Schizophrenia and MPD are treated with intensive therapy (Freudian, cognitive, maybe even behavioral) and drugs to "fix" these chemical imbalances. Bipolar disorder too.. drugs and therapy.    You probably need more information- you can e-mail me if you want me to go more in depth on treatment.|`|zR7QXAiiaa	Bipolar Disorder  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipolar_dis...

AA12144404	I take it that you are rather young.  From what I have seen, most families are dysfunctional if you take small bits out of context.  A family may be dysfunctional to you, but just fine for your parents.  The only real way to tell if it is indeed dysfunctional is if it doesn't function at all.       Ask yourself if it meets the needs of the people involved...is everyone unhappy, or just you?  Either way, whether it's just a projection of your own discontentment, or an actually dysfunctional experience, your only real choice is to learn from the experience, and leave as soon as you turn 18.

AJeaWX8Paa	Sports psychology is the application of psychological concepts to improve sports performance.

AJeaWX8Paa	You might be experiencing what's known as confirmation bias.  A simple cure is to keep track of how many times you think of a show and it doesn't come on.  Whenever something like you're describing happens it really sticks out for us, because it seems so unlikely.  However, when our premonitions don't come true, we don't think twice about it.  This makes the times you're right seem more salient than the times you are wrong.  If you do keep track and find that every time you think of a show it always comes on (even 30% accuracy would be amazing) then you might have something.|`|oG3MyQTyaa	okay so that is great..

The ability to pre-cognize something you later observe is not uncommon, although if limited to just TV, this may be more rare.    Every persons MIND is an aspect of the Universal MIND, and so it is not uncommon that people pick up the communications of others that none of the people involved  is aware of sending or receiving, but it takes place nonetheless.  If it becomes a danger to you or it threatens your life in some way, seek help.  If it is just a curiosity, enjoy it while it lasts.    Peace

mCAWxobNaa	Hero, basically I don't know what her motivation was in telling you these things, but here's how things work:  both college aged women and old women prefer youngish looking guys (right around age 18) because they are regarded as having the greatest amount of physical attractivness.  Old women will always try to go for young looking men, like in the film Thelma & Louise.  The two old women tried to get Brad Pitt was was like 19 or so in 1989.    As long as a man has money, it obviates the need to be young and you can still get the highest quality women as long as you have money; it's the ultimate equalizer.|`|zWqKuIQuaa	Why is it that you look older?  Are you overweight, then lose weight.  Do you have bad skin, then fix it.  Do you have a crap hairstyle, then get a new one.  Do you wear kmart clothes, then buy new ones.  Everybody can look reasonably attractive if they know how to take care of themselves.|`|AA10241709	Generally speaking, your counselor is right.    When younger, many women prefer a more mature and older looking mate, and when older, especially if single, women tend to want to try something new and try a younger mate.    There are always exceptions to this rule, but your counselor is not just trying to make you feel better, she is being truthful.|`|pzLDXL6gaa	That's good because I always advised you to get therapy about your issues and I'm glad you are.     I don't know if it's true or not - all the girls I know are differences with their preferences regarding age, looks etc. And yes it does shift between wanting a guy about the same age and an older-looking guy, but not for everybody and not at the same time.     However most of these preferences go out the window when you meet somebody you like and click with - doesn't matter their age or the age they look if they get on well enough.    And I have no idea how you counsellor was trying to make you more confident by that, ask her. I think it's a bit irresponsible of her to make blanket statements about all girls and that's probably her personal view but she doesn't realise it.    Harriet|`|DpbZdIsUaa	For a start she should not have interrupted you, she is your counselor!  Most college girls will date college boys because that's where they form friendships and connect to people.  Looks don't have alot to do with it.  However, unfortunetly, alot of young girls are hung up on what their boyfriends look like rather than their personality.  If you look like you're in your mid twenties, it may be girls around that age from 20-25 that would be attracted to you.  You will find as you get older younger girls will be attracted to you but it will probably be because you will look more your true age.  I mean when you're in your early to mid 20's, girls in their late teens will start to notice you more.  When you're closer to 30, girls in their early-mid 20's will notice you.  My brother was 18 when he met a lady who was 33.  She thought he was in his 20's and it wasn't until they'd been together for about 4 months that she found out at his birthday party how old he really was.  Later she said if she had known his age to begin with she wouldn't have had a relationship with him.  So your therapist is right in one way and wrong in another.    Some (not all) older woman over 30 may be attracted to guys in their 20's but I wouldn't say they are attracted to the college boy look.  Maybe she knows of someone who is, or maybe she is herself.|`|uhchod38aa	Why would she say that? Maybe it's her opinion that some women of a certain age prefer younger men, just as some men of a certain age will prefer younger women. This is certainly not some kind of rule, but sure, it's true for some. Personally, I have always preferred men my own age.    There is also this to consider: Just because someone may have a preference for dating younger people, doesn't mean they are not open to dating people who are their own age or older. Age is only one of many factors. When you date someone, you date a whole person. Because no one is perfect, no one will ever fit your image of the perfect mate.     Finally, you say you look a few years older than you are. First, there is not really much difference between looking 20 and 25. Secondly, even if what your counselor said was an absolute, looking 25 or even 30 still looks pretty young to a woman over 40. It's all a matter of perspective.|`|qcDHyhdtaa	All women have different tastes. I think your shrink is not all that great. She's making a blanket statement. I know women who would never go out w/a younger man.   I like variety. I've dated cute boyish looking 25 yr olds to manly looking men that look like Paul Bunyan.     Of course many women like the college stud-muffin. However, one of the profs where I go is in his late 40s and he's delicious looking...and *gasp* has grey side-burns.|`|yUMH5u6daa	I dont know why she would tell you that. Growing up I had crushes on guys my age. All girls are different. It might have been a personal situation for her maybe that's why she said it.|`|AXNowGPyaa	I doubt your looks are your problem so much as the fact that you are so insecure that you pay some woman to talk to you about how concerned you are over your looks. You surely radiate a sense of hopeless insecurity.|`|emOhSyY5aa	To be honest, I don't think you want to feel more confident with your looks. You ask the same question and we tell you that you looks fine. But you only respond to the negative comments. Why? Why do you enjoy negativity?|`|RZmAGYusaa	Man women aren`t a book in which you can open it and read , women are a human being as you as any , if you don`t try to do anything you ll propably stay there. Now about your counselor , in my opinion women always like the better but this doesn`t mean they don`t give chance to lower than them in beauty , i have also a problem in confident and honestly in my mind i think 1000 and 1 reason why i shouldn`t talk to her or ask her for a dinner , but i do understand after making everyhitng sh*t that i should try even though i would get a negative answer. Cheers
DHyUnhS1aa	She probably found it funny because it sounds like you feed the dog under the table all the time even though she tells you not to and you deserved it.|`|iHKJsyfTaa	If your mother is a feminist ,then yes , she will enjoy injury to any males genitals , even yours.|`|s3IBrhZCaa	women are sick creatures aint they?|`|a231cd46589d3ea6efabcc68cdd6e69baa	Do you fetishists all copy and paste these stories from some central archive?  Can't you manage to be a tiny bit original?  I mean, you do know this one version has been posted hundreds of times before, right?  And exactly how do you get your jollies by spamming places like this will your ball-busting fetish stories?|`|6H1ie8WXaa	There are plenty of websites out there with fantasy stories for your fetish, so please don't spam Y!A with your questions.|`|DpbZdIsUaa	If you weren't doubled over in pain, I would tell you that's another good reason not to feed the dog under the table.  I have a son and if he was hurt in anyway I wouldn't be laughing.  My dogs are always sitting there staring at us when we're eating.  My little dog will try to get as close to me as possible, even try and jump up on my knee.    It's amazing what dogs will do when you have food.  It's a good way to train them as well.  I've taught the dogs that they have to lie down and wait until we're finished then I always keep a little bit of something to give them.    When I get up from the table, I make them sit and then tell them "gently" so they don't bite my fingers and give them their treat.  It stops them from scabbing when we're eating and they get their reward for behaving.    You should try it too!  It will stop your mum from getting angry at you and your dog will still love you as long as you don't forget to save some for him/her!|`|8miMWB64aa	Mostly laughing because you got hurt.  And, it makes it easier to laugh at people when you don't empathize with their pain as much, which is easier when someone gets hurt through a means that the individual believes couldn't happen to them.  (i.e., Females can't empathize with being hit in the nuts as much because it's never happened to them).    Plus some people just find getting hit in the testes to be funny.  Men and women.    No worries, it's normal.
5qdnePl5aa	sometimes you might relate to the message in the movie or someone died and your just drawn to crying maybe supressing other issues in your like and your unonsious is pushing those emotions up knowinng its a sad movie..     good way to not cry at a movie is to suck on your drink with a staw youl have to pee alot more but you dont cry|`|V675pNwiaa	it feels good sometimes|`|GMrtEYj6aa	depress.
uhchod38aa	You could be bi-sexual. Or maybe you want to be in a relationship but because you can't imagine having a relationship with a man, you form attachments to women. Maybe you are frightened of having an actual relationship: if you form attachments to people who are unobtainable, you never have to deal with a real relationship.     You don't want to be with women physically, just emotionally...well, that would mean you want close female friendships.|`|cWxwHMQWaa	It's normal to want to get to know people as friends, see if she wants to go to lunch or something. Talk to one another, see if you have anything really in common, who knows, if you do you'll probably spend more time together and be friends =o)    It's hard for most adults who didn't get close to anyone in their lives to make friends, to actually let themselves really care for someone, but it can be done. Just give it a shot and see what happens.    If you don't end up friends, it's not necessarily that you did anything wrong, not everyone are great as friends even if they get along well at work, best luck, have fun =o)|`|7aK81hsbaa	i would find an emotional rapport more rewarding than a purely sexual attraction myself. i'm lesbian for that reason, i find women much more desirable, more approachable, more reasonable, and stronger emotionally because we don't have to hold it all in or try to hide our emotions.  we're prettier too.|`|8miMWB64aa	Emotional needs commonly trump physical attraction.  One difficulty for you is that most women tend to prefer men, so the chances that she's interested aren't great.  Further, inter-work relationships can be messy and risky.    Still, if you want to give it a shot, it's your life.  It seems like a risk to me, but if it's worth it to you.. well, again, it's your life.    Edit:  Oh, if you don't want to date her, then you can just ask her out for coffee sometime or something.  I mean, it's really common for people to just be friends 'n such.|`|AtHBtTaJaa	you just whant a close frend x  you sound like you analyze things , sit there and think , just like me x  stop worrying get busy it will kepp you distracted and calm down  luv x  find out if shes got something in common with you   ask her to meet up for a coffe after you get to know her a bit more at work   good luck and let me know how it goes x|`|DpbZdIsUaa	Everyone needs friends and that's how you are interested in her.  Rather than asking her out with you alone, invite her and someone else to go out somewhere for lunch or coffee.  Good luck.  She may feel the same way about you.
m2cxGTwgaa	think of it as a good thing. you will make more friends. i ended up having no friends in one class, and made alot throughout the semester. im taking a class in photography, a year below me, and i know there will be no one i am friends with already, so im just going to wing it. even though i am not the most outgoing person. good luck.|`|Kl4kv5khaa	Do a get to know your classmates activity.

Be confident. You should not lose heart at this juncture. Postpone your nervousness till the exams are over. I hope you know how to do it. Get involved seriously in studies. Do not divert your attention towards the subject of nervousness. Remove the word nervousness from your dictionary.|`|AA10287830	Regardless of how you feel your classes will start.  So face your fears.  You will soon get to know people in your classes. You just have to get through the first couple of days.  What is the worst that can happen in your new classes?  Can you handle the worst?  Probably.  So you know that the very worst things won't happen so you can handle it.  Good luck.  Study hard.  Try to relax.  You're going to be fine.  You might even meet some pretty interesting people.

J4lfOSPiaa	I don't know you or much of your past since I am new to Yahoo.  I would ask you to find out the real title of this lady you see because there are huge differences to approaches based on a psychologist, social therapist, and psychiatrist. I feel certain that with all these "P" titles that you can get lost in what they are capable of doing for you.  A physiologist is more frequently known for dealing with the biology of functioning living matter and organisms, but as a rule of thumb I don't know any qualified to handle anxiety disorder or social/psychological issues.  Now I am not attempting to belittle your knowledge of these individual titles.  Here is what I want to understand, if your therapist is good then it behooves her to go outside of the box once in a while to get a reluctant patient to speak their real thoughts. The mind and the many files and tapes it keeps buried are just below the surface - it is a difficult task for any seasoned professional to try to finally peel away the layers of a patients self protection mechanism to get to the nugget of truth!  He/She must try to sort out the reasons you sought out their care from the first place. If you have been seeing this therapist for nearly 7 months once a week then surely you have established some rapport(special relationship), with this lady that would allow you to eventually touch that very "sore spot" that causes you pain, and you are unwilling to verbalize or can't at this point. A good Dr. will look at your body language and a myriad of other things they are trained to use when a person has trouble expressing this "something" that bothers you.  This was the reason I asked you about the exact title of your therapist because even psychologists can not prescribe anti-anxiety medications or any meds, but a pshychiatrist can give you proper medications if the need warrants. In your discussion you have brought up 3 red flags already - You have a secret that you desperately want to share.  You feel regret after your sessions for with holding more insights into your particular situation. Last but not least you even express anxiety over having to wait until your scheduled time frame next Friday to see your therapist.  I am a Dr. and I have  built in urgent spots in my schedule to take care of emergency situations.  I am a surgeon and not a Psychiatrist, but I can't see why you couldn't call to request an urgent time slot with your therapist.  It could be the single most important thing you can do. If you are on the verge of a breakthrough in your therapy then any therapist worth their salt would want to speak with you, now that you are willing.  If you don't want to move your appt. time up, then you can do journaling which allows you to put your thoughts on paper to bring up at the next session.  The last option is risky but for you pretty innocuous(harmless) and that is you could communicate with me via e-mail or IM because the anonymity of the situation might allow you to open up better when you are not staring across at another person.  That is about all I can offer you.  Some therapists give you a home phone number so you can talk in an emergency or if you feel it is the right time, but whatever your choice good luck and God bless.  I hope you get some resolution to your anxiety real soon.|`|wUVz8bL5aa	Print this and give it to her.  Or if you think you'll chicken out, you could mail it in time before the next visit.  You seem to be able to express better when writing.|`|9NDaOGVsaa	I think that you acknowledge your feelings is a great first step.  You have figured out that this isn't working and need a way to change... good for you!  I myself do not like to open up, either.  I think that can be said for most people.  However, your therapist is in your life to help you work through problems that you need assistance with.  How about you try telling her a piece of what you want to... then see how you feel afterwards.  I bet you'll feel so fantastic for opening up that you'll be ready to talk some more.  The first step is the hardest;  I don't know you, but I will pray for you; that God will give you the courage to take that first step.|`|AA10287830	Since you do have to wait try writing down some things you want to share with her and then burn the note so no one will see it.  I am so glad you are going to level with her.  That is the only way you will begin the healing process.  You have to be 100% honest with yourself and everyone you come in contact with.  You sound like you are ready to begin a new life.  Good luck.|`|V675pNwiaa	Tell her what you have been wanting to tell her. She is there to help you not judge you. I know it is hard to open up to someone you don't really know. I had to go to a physiologist for depression and anxiety also. You should ask her if you can write down how you feel at home and then bring it in if that is more comfortable for you.|`|RXeuiz95aa	Hey,     There's honestly no need to feel like this; you're probably feeling so bad because you kept it all bottled up inside. Don't worry, friday will be here before you know it. Remember, if you don't tell her how you're feeling, you'll have to go through this all again. Be as 100% honest with her; if you can't tell her, who can you tell?     Good luck, and don't worry; friday will be here before you know it. Promise. (:|`|tTIXhe7daa	Do you like yourself? If you do than you wouldn't run or be passive to talk to people. You have issues with yourself. Just talk to her already. Who cares the lady is not going to be   alive that long to know about your whole life. And she is the type of person that as probably heard more embarressing   stories anyway. Yours would just be another story formular to something else.|`|14zk9dldaa	It must be so very hard for you emotionally, when you're unable to speak. I'd suggest paying attention to your voice. Where IS your voice (when your stuck)? Is it in your throat, your stomach, your head?? Where is your voice? Once you locate your voice (within your body), you may have more control to "will" it out,"push" it out. Your therapist sounds very understanding and she doesn't want to push you. You have to be ready. So, ask yourself, why am I ready in my logic/head but not in my emotions/heart? Who wouldn't allow you to speak? What happened when you did? Just some questions to ask yourself. There may be a connection there. The writing response was good and there may be yet another way to use that tool. You could write it (something simple) and hand it to her when you get there. How about, "give me permission to speak about...." And let her do the rest. You could leave her a voice mail (they are usually confidential and say so on the message). The goal of therapy is to feel better...to get relief. Set a goal for yourself (no matter how small) and then don't allow yourself to come out of that office without meeting your goal. One simple goal. One step at a time and you'll do fine. Affirm you have a voice and it's your right to use it. And for gosh sake...STOP beating yourself up!!! It will happen EXACTLY when it is SUPPOSE to happen. Give yourself a break!
93b4ed7bd08774a53436f8fa3f60471baa	Although we don't know you, we care about you. You see how many people answering your question and trying to help? Not to say your parents. I am sure they do care about you. But, they may have different ways expressing their cares of you.    Go pick the soft parent (usually one parent offer love and understandings and the other deliver disciplines), and tell him or her that you need love and cares from both of them. You surely can mention your cutting habit to him/her, but do not be confused yourself and not to confuse him/her that you want to trade your blood with their love, because love do not work this way, but make things even worse.     At the same time, you are encouraged to talk to someone you trust who is much older than you. You may ask them to go see a trained counselor with you, because without proper trainings, no one could do better job helping you than a trained counselor.     Stop cutting, stop crying, and start living. =)|`|44f971d7ae1936193e159c0b3819760baa	Been there. done that, got over it, have a hundred ugly scars 30 years later. Is that what you want?

I'm sorry that your parents don't want to listen, but there must be other adults who will listen, a school counselor, a priest or minister, a neighbor, a friend's parent....Also, in the phone book, there are local places that will allow you to get help and charge you what you can afford, including nothing if that's how much you have. You can reach out to these people and get the help you need. Perhaps once you reach out to someone else, your parents will realize what's been going on and get involved.     PLEASE, PLEASE GET THIS HELP! REACH OUT TO SOMEBODY and if they don't want to listen, REACH OUT TO SOMEONE ELSE until you get help. You can do that!     Good luck and God bless!|`|fkQUCwUhaa	seriously hon, dont do that ! you need to get help very soon.|`|AA10287830	You won't go to hell for cutting yourself but you are in such pain that you need to talk to a professional.  If you can't talk to your parents talk to a counselor at school or call a church and ask for a minister.  Do you have an adult you trust that can help you get the help you need?  You know that it isn't right and it's unhealthy but just knowing isn't enough.  You need help that trained professionals can give you.  Be gentle with yourself sweetie.

As a youth worker, I think you really need to speak to somebody about this, either a close friend or a guidance-type teacher at school? If all else fails, find a number for some kind of hotline you could call and talk you through it - you'd be shocked how much better the personal touch is than on the net :(    your parents will care more than you expect, it's just very easy for people to get self-absorbed with the things that they do.

oFV48JbGaa	Your question doesn't make much sense...|`|6Bddw25Taa	karen horney perhaps commented on this: the difference between the idealized self and actual self can result in neuroses.  In laymans terms, if you are taking a "stand" is it really you? Do you stand up for things that you take for granted or just those things you "want" to believe. In street lingo: if you are trying to be something u arent, you are a poser.    Sometimes it has more to do with others own insecurities about the issue... or it looks like a social trend rather than a personality, philosophy choice.   what do you think?|`|OtycNjSqaa	Some stands are just for show.

AA10287830	You most certainly have more of a 6th sense than most.  I haven't a touch of it myself but have a friend who blows my mind with her abilities.  Develop your abilities especially if you are young!  You can probably be of help to a lot of people since you can sense when they are hurting.  It is a gift.  Use it wisely.|`|B4YESGmwaa	I think some people are more in tune with what another person is experiencing and with very little conversation can sense what kind of mood they are in. I think some of us are much better at reading non verbal clues and if we know that person at all can get in touch with what is going on. If you can do that with a total and complete stranger with no conversation then....I do see it as a honed sense but I'm not sure psychic|`|Ctc6DzCsaa	Oh yeah, another one.    Well, be sure to train yourself to better your abilities. From personal experience, it will help, greatly. Make it something enjoyable, as to not have it as a problem. When I turned 16, I had to start meditation with my dad! He is one of those people that can tell were you are by just the sound of your voice, know if something is wrong, or if there is something you are doing wrong. My dad claims he can see the future, and since I was 15, I have believed every word he said.     The reason I believe him was because me, my friend, and her boyfriend were going to a movie. And for some reason my dad would not let me go, I was so mad at him. Being me, I went too my room and cried about it. I turned off my phone and cried into my pillow. My dad opened my door slightly and told me to turn on my phone, I'd be getting a call soon. I don't know how I heard him over my stereo blasting, he said It was just a gift for good hearing. Anyway, he was right. I got a call from my Friends mom. Whom was crying and all in a panic, yelling at me to get to the hospital. Sadly, my friend and her boyfriend had gotten side-wiped by a semi. The back of the car was completely smashed. She died at the scene, along with her boyfriend who was in the front seat.    Now that I am 19, I have gotten a good grip on my abilities. I have learned when to touch, when not to touch. When to read, and when not to read. Sometimes when I have a strange dream, and I have a feeling about it, I can end up sleeping for a day or so.     When to touch and When not to touch, that is important for you. Yes, you can hug people, kiss, and the such. But when you feel your abilities coming on or something Don't touch. Unlike me, I have to live with it. Anything I touch I attune too...(Don't worry about that)    Now about the dreams, sometimes It is just a one time thing. So take the time to get the full meaning of the dream. Only then will it go away, or until the event happens. All 6th sense's are different.    Controlling it is more important than anything, but understanding it is Vital.
AA11299516	I will do my best with the info provided, but analyzing dreams like yours is much simpler when the details are there to work with. Keep in mind that not all symbols are actual symbols & many times our dreams are just what they are. Like a dream about losing teeth could mean, Go to the dentist! So here goes...If the main mood or theme in this dream is the violence it could represent your aggression towards another person, place, or thing in your life. Most likely this is something you've been holding in and are unable to confront the issue. Example: You're sister is married a cheating jerk whom you've hated since childhood. You have to spend time around this person for family functions etc... (which would explain the recurrence of the dream) But your sis is a blissfully ignorant wife &loving mother so you keep it to yourself. Pent up anger galore! Try to focus on WHO your killing & WHERE (school, work, public place, the crowded freeway, etc.) & WHEN it happens. (are you older, younger, present, night, day, during a storm?) Determining these symbols may lead to the WHY you seek.Now if the main mood or theme or overall feeling in this dream is death and dying you could be dealing with a great loss (or not dealing with it for that matter) and you are stuck in the anger stage instead of moving on to guilt or sadness or closure. Could you be upset at the loss of a job, home, or loved one & someone else is to blame? [his would explain the outward violence because you're not angry or agressive toward yourself.Then you might dream of self destructive behavior such as reckless driving or suicide. Chew on these suggestions and confront whatever situation or person you want to "kill" and let die. You may find peace in finally blowing up and snapping. We all do it & we have a right to our anger when justified as long as its dealt with before it festers into violence that cannot be reversed. Good luck.
cucY09Xvaa	I suppose it depends on the person.  If you are a spirtual person, maybe you care not for your body as it just holds your spirit before you become your true self?  However, you might feel that life is all there is, so your treasure your body.  I hope that made sense.|`|hWBxpGyXaa	i dont even understand ur question  try making it clearer huh?

DuLhv7Ajaa	Ok first I'd like to know where you're getting those stats... the Maury Show maybe? I would need some serious proof before i would even come close to believing that.  Second, no it should not be mandatory. If you don't trust the person you are in a relationship with than move on. Other wise what is the point to being together.|`|7J6m0L3Haa	First, post some sources. I smell BS.    Second, that's an invasion of privacy. Does anyone give a crap about children any more? I mean, do children not deserve a father? Are fathers so shallow and possessive that the idea of a child that is not theirs is enough to make them abandon a child that has called them "daddy" for years?    Yeah, and I totally do not buy that 20% of babies born in this country have concealed parentage and that 20% of new mother are liars. This smacks of more paranoid anti-feminist wishful thinking.|`|FL67UPPHaa	I don't think any medical procedure should be mandatory. DNA tests are a private matter that are required only by a few couples; if a man feels the need for a DNA test, they are available. The government shouldn't have to fund people's relationship problems, especially when they don't apply to 4 out of 5 fathers. I think all it would do is create a sense of mistrust and extra stress between couples, when they should be bonding with their new baby. I also don't like the implication that women lie by default... most women would never consider lying about the father of their child.|`|qPlx1Ejhaa	The say it would consume a huge amount of resources.  I think in all child support cases, a DNA test must be done.  Also whenever the man has any doubts he should be able to get a test done. Amazingly some women's groups are trying to stop this right!.    Any woman who commits this kind of fraud should be jailed.|`|pzLDXL6gaa	It's not a very good use of resources and I think a lot of people wouldn't want it. This has been asked before and a lot of fathers didn't like the implication that they didn't trust their partners and said they wouldn't have chosen the test. I don't think it should be mandatory, like I said it's not a good use of resources because in the majority of cases the result will be the partner as expected, also if the government has to pay it's a waste, but if peole have to pay they might refuse. But maybe it should be suggested and they can opt out? I think it's a better idea in child support cases. But making it mandatory all the time is just an invasion of privacy.    Harriet|`|AA11589988	Frankly I don't think society is ready to face the consequences of this. Some women love getting the bad boy genes whilst the good guy chump is used to raise the child thinking he's the father when he isn't. That have your cake and eat it game for women would come to an end and it would be interesting to see the effect of this.|`|AA12187979	Absoulty great idea.  Let the truth set us free!|`|jf1f7vNxaa	What?    And make women more accountable for their actions?    HERETIC!|`|yUMH5u6daa	because the kid would probably be abandoned and lead a very unhappy life.|`|AA12144404	And who would pay for that?|`|LR48Rtv2aa	Every child should have a father.  So what if it's not their biological father raising them!  At least there are men out there willing enough to even care that much.|`|CHlxBbkHaa	I wouldn't care if it was mandatory to have a DNA test.  I look like my dad.  I was raised in a stable home with reasonable beliefs and morals.  If I can't let my baby have a DNA test to prove that the guy I said was the father really is the father, then I shouldn't be having kids and should be figuring out my life.|`|ZjrFsYz5aa	In a lot of states they have you sign a paper saying that they gave you the option. You can refuse it or go ahead with it but they must offer the test.  Although i agree everyone should have to take it|`|NNHdkLDWaa	Yes, because it is the state who appoints later child support and jails you if you do not pay up, so they should go after the right man.|`|8ff3196b10cd4c3afc116407535b3666aa	That would be an invasion of a person's privacy. I mean sure, if you have nothing to hide then why object, but still trust is what should be at the center of every relationship and that would eliminate some need for trust. Also in many cases it doesn't matter to the father if the child is not technically theirs. Parents are who raise you not necessarily the people who you share DNA with.|`|tf8QShf9aa	Well, the costs^^  Simple as that.  As long as the fathers dont know they dont care, right?  There are lots of reasons.  What about the child?  There would be a great increase in divorces.   Families breaking apart.  I know im forgetting the morality but in the big scale you have to think macchiavelisticly.  In Germany (that's where I live) a DNA test made by the father without the knowledge of the mother cant ever be used in court.  @Somebody:  "Parents are who raise you not necessarily the people who you share DNA with."  That's a very interesting fact as it shows flaws in the evolution of mankind.^^  Maybe its part of some social indirect advantages?|`|8miMWB64aa	DNA testing really should be more common if that's the case.  It's horrible to lie to a parent about their child like that, and I'm all for the jail sentence.    Still, that seems like a lot.  Do you have a source for your statistic?    PS-  Just to put it out there, there have been huge, very recent advances in biochemical technology that will make DNA tests much cheaper and far more accessible.  It seems likely to me that these sorts of tests will happen in the future without any real motivation, since they'll be so easy to do.|`|M4fiDYE6aa	my dad is not my real dad. my mom told my dad b4 I was even born|`|eK2nRJL3aa	Well, your question does not really seem complete. If your stats imply that 1 out of every 5 men raise children that they KNOW are not theirs, then a DNA test would be irrelevant because if they know and still care enough to help raise the child, then that is between he and the mother.    Now, if your stats imply that 1 in every 5 men raise children that they BELIEVE are theirs but really are not, then yes, I would agree that in their particular situation, a mandatory paternity test would be beneficial. But I do think we need to be careful about what we begin mandating. But I really don't see the harm in it, the man deserves to know the truth and make up his own mind of how he wants to handle the situation if it's proven that he is not the biological father.|`|NhMfGXmxaa	It's not true at all that 1 in 5 fathers raise children that aren't theirs.    I call bullshit.
lsmk8gEGaa	I don't think anger would do it, mind games might. I don't think many people commit suicide out of anger, they might kill someone else out of anger.
AA11763656	I know what you are feeling. Stop and take a breather, and pack it in for the day. Sit back and listen to some of your own favorite music. Stop stressing, that's not what music is about. It would seem to me you are working on something that you love. Keep that in perspective. Not everyone gets to do things they love doing.|`|1b7bf9c9f6da80aefc5336146294cca1aa	Give your mind a break, find some peace somewhere in the house or just go for a walk (all depending where you live and what's the weather like), but only you know what is wrong and why you are feeling Depression. Depression is an emotional Psychological mood swing that some of us all fall into. You just have to decide these 3 things:   1.) What is the Depression  2.) How long do you think to endure the Depression  3.) How long do you want the Depression to last.  You know what you should do, just listen to your conscience and it be your guide. Believe in yourself, you can overcome all obstacles that may come way.  Trust God and yourself.  Good Luck|`|AA10287830	This may sound trite but it works for me:  Just do it!    You know you will feel much better having this behind you so do the right thing and the thing you know will make you feel good about yourself.  You can do it so get cracking:)|`|oFV48JbGaa	Do it, or I'll come punch you in the face.
PV0UjVfLaa	Not at all! It's nice and sweet and cute and charming and... oh I could go on :D|`|QJfMKDpDaa	Not at all...I have always loved the wallflowers and their shy, secret smiles.|`|AA12336246	If you did look negatively on her, then you wouldn't be able to call yourself a friend. Everyone is different and being shy is not the worst personality trait ye can have.|`|530KySo9aa	no, i know people like that. and i think most people are likely to be honest and real in a smaller setting. it's cool that she actually told you that rather than put herself through a weird situation.|`|lSAdkvDFaa	Not at all. If everybody was the same then the world would be a boring place. Its a case of horses for courses. Whats for one person isnt always for another thats all.   x|`|uaT2KCgMaa	no some people are like that i have a friend in that situation|`|bA94Uy4Saa	Definately not. Many people feel like that. I wouldn't go to bars with her unless she wanted to. I would go to clubs with other people so that i would not make her uncomfortable. I could do other stuff with her instead|`|c3h3qgNpaa	no but i would feel sad  tat since i like da opposite  it'll b harder to find time 2 hang out with her|`|tp61e25Eaa	I would like her more actually because I am like that as well. If I was a "bar person" maybe I would think less of her for not wanting to "have fun" like me; but I am not like that and that would not be fun to me, so I would get along good with that type of person and not think less of them at all.
7BZYUHpjaa	get mad! you have to feel. something. anything. get mad and talk to them talk to anyone. scream and yell at them if you need to. just do and feel something.|`|wyXCRGv6aa	being gay is wrong, dude.|`|4f98fad5ad9e1132273168090fa4638faa	Just know that it won't last forever. If you are gay, talk openly with them and tell them you are gay and you don't want to come around them when they talk bad about gay people. Tell them you already feel gay bashing by the general public sometimes and you never expected you would feel that way around your own family. Discuss it with them.  Good Luck|`|AA11216736	im with multitask and questioner49 wish i was level two. any ways if things goo bad when you confront them just move on forgive. hopefully they won't mention some thing anti-gay. if they do then just walk out of the room to express how you feel. they might get why you walked out and wont want to make you depress. oh and dont feel depressed ppl are gonna say things anti that you dont't like throughout your life. just confront them properly. deal with it and dont let people make you sad because of stupid comments. feel bad for them because of how they wrongly view things. if i were you id feel outraged but would control that anger.  arguing is good once in a while too. if you stay depressed just know you wont feel like that forever. you will move on.nothing lasts forever. want to get over your depression, eat and watch funny **** on the internet. or get your mind of the problem do something that demands your full concentration so you can forget the problem for a while. you will then afterward feel stronger to confront your problem.    PS.you got to be ******* kidding me KRN its people like you that make everyone in this world sick to the core dont listen to him he has worst problems than you i can guarantee it .  he mentions he feels bad because  of anti gay comments and you just mention something anti gay you are very ******* stupid.|`|tTIXhe7daa	It probably runs in the family.|`|lsmk8gEGaa	they are from a different generation and time. Why do you expect them to understand something they were taught their whole life was wrong but you make ZERO effort to understand them? They can't make you depressed only you can, sounds like to me you haven't dealt with your own feelings and acceptance of being gay and when someone has a differing viewpoint it depresses you. If you were ok with it and understood where they are coming from it wouldn't bother you, at least not nearly as much.|`|2iqBP8cLaa	I've totally felt like if I died it wouldn't bother me at all at one time (or maybe two).    I'm guessing by how you wrote about anti-gay talk that either you are gay or have friend(s) that are gay?  If so, you need to release the frustration/depression by confronting them and tell them flat out, in a kind tone, that this is who you are (or your friend(s)) and they need to accept that because you are finding it impossibly sad to be around negative talk about something you feel strongly about and would like them to stop.  Ask if they'd be willing to give that a try.|`|WFYtrtRmaa	well im guessing your gay if those things bothered you.    maybe confront them with your feelings. and if you get a negative response....move out?
14zk9dldaa	Yes, I have had it done. Years ago, and I now wish I hadn't. If you believe it is possible, (and you must if your asking this question),then you know there are forces, spirits, if you will.   Opening yourself, your mind, YOUR spirit is allowing yourself to become vulnerable to....? Do you know???? No, you don't. Trust me. Pass this one by.|`|7BZYUHpjaa	i think thats really cool. ive never done it but ive always wanted to.|`|lrS8UXnYaa	I get regressed every time I talk to my ex-wife.|`|5O7op0oIaa	That would definitely be a worthwhile use of your money.        Also - can I sell you a bridge...?|`|bjqjkDMHaa	If you actually believe  a past life exists...?  Like, you're hindu or something?  I'm a skeptist in most of the fortune telling mess.  But if you beleive it...what the heck?  I believe, personally, that what used to be will eventually make sense in the next life.|`|y8HyP1bzaa	I'm not really sure what you're talking about...?|`|GqfiRXu3aa	I read a book about it.  I wouldn't put much faith into it as far as it being legitimate.|`|6kUx7fwcaa	I think that past regression analysis is false and that it is nothing more than someone's use of imagination.  We may all be made up of the same energy that existed since the big bang, but it has not been in the same composition as our form before and never will again, so what would we be regressing to.  Reincarnation does not exist in the simplistic notion we conceive it to be.  At this point in time the general consciousness is too limited to conceive of what how it works.  So don't get sucked in.  People do it for money, not because you can.|`|CB15kchkaa	I have recalled a past death, but not through mainstream techniques.  It's quite an experience because when you get the thread of a memory, you suddenly start remembering more and more.   In my experience I recalled being upset by a girlfriend and jumping into my car and driving off only to crash into a tractor as I rounded a bend. I went straight through the windscreen and head first through the radiator! As I recalled this, I suddenly had the most sickly physical reactions, and wanted to stop the session, but was encouraged to continue. Eventually I realised I was recalling being separate to my body! Eerie!  Reading Cavassis comment I would like to say that if we were to suppose that man has a spiritual nature as well as a physical one, then we could easily deduce that spiritually we exist forever. So reincarnation is more the 'taking' of another body after leaving the present one. There is much evidence for this spiritual nature, but then again that can easily be refuted. On the other hand, we do inherit features from our ancestors, and could it be that we inherit memory also?  What I can say is, regardless of what it is we experience through regression techniques, we certainly do experience something, and it most often explains loads about our current perceptions and personalities in this lifetime. Psychological trickery or real past lives? Who knows, but the experience is certainly worth it.

Also, Christmas was actually fun.|`|AA10412319	i guess high school because i met some cool people. and meeting my bf for the 1st time, but now we are broken up, we were together only 5 months, but talked since december 2007. we went to high school and i couldnt wait to meet him. we were in a long distance relationship because he currently stationed in korea.|`|plxrH0vKaa	high school|`|c3h3qgNpaa	i havnt had any gud years yet   i reckon my best years will be wen   i hav a child and raise it.....|`|XWdc2qk4aa	college. no doubt.|`|FaNrYZoTaa	i think 17 has been the best year....still in high school. but a senior so that's cool...and now it's not the crappy beginning years of high school, it's almost over, yay! still not too many responsibilities because i still have my parents. i have more freedom because i'm older and can drive. i think my body is at it's best...fully developed pretty much, yet still fit and young. you can walk the streets drunk and not go to jail if you get caught. it's just really fun...but in a week i'll be 18, so shiiit on that.    but wait...actually being a little kid, because you don't know how much the world actually sucks...and you have no worries, at least i didn't|`|rFLHaPc3aa	right now...(that would be high school)  i am going to have THE most amazing summer/spring ... here is my list beginning in march:  school trips: (which are awesome because of my friends)  NYC/Broadway  Gettysburg  Honors Picnic  Wallops Island {4days/3nights!!!}  OTHER:  Creation Fest {week}  Australia {17 days!}  and then! me and friends came up with a list of fun things to do in 2009 and let me tell ya. this summer is going to be amazing with them!  i can NOT wait.  i have cabin fever SO bad.  so yea... right now.  ?have fun
oTV3Bro5aa	I wouldn't worry about it. It was just one of those silly dreams. Your brain is just telling a story.

B9r1yigYaa	it's the same for any behavior, good or bad  from excess to balance, belief moves a mountain--or not|`|8GDd6lrnaa	everyone wants to have an excuse not to try.|`|rYdEVC0xaa	of course it would be different, if you base your whole life on what you feel, look like, or believe at teh present time, then it just leads you into a miserable cycle that you cant get out of because you do not think you need to anymore. Once you establish a pattern of behavior, people label you as the fat person, or the unreliable person, or the depressed person. People need to realize that as time goes by, everything changes, no matter what they might think. there is no harm in tweaking your behaviors in order to feel just a little confident in something you do
AA10461474	Right answer is B. the development of empirical methods. Empirical methods are an integral part of cognitive-behavioral theories.    Wrong:  a. introspection is just the opposite of the type of research method used in cognitive approaches.  c. that's a description of psychoanalysis  d. chimps & language learning are irrelevant to cognitive theory & approaches.
pzLDXL6gaa	No not really. I would only care if it was too big (painfully) or too small so that we couldn't have sex properly. And then, in a relationship, if we couldn't work around that sex problem and it caused bigger problems. I'm assuming that's what I'd do anyway - I like guys around the average size and because it's the average, most guys are so I've never been with somebody freakishly large or small.    Harriet|`|jnI7bEuFaa	yea, they do. If it's not thick or thicker what good is it?    if it's skinny it's no good. and if it's under 6 inches no good either,|`|ZjrFsYz5aa	Yes they do most woman would not be with a man with a 3 incher unless the woman was really fat or the man was rich.  Just like some guys like big breasts or a tight vagina|`|BkleL3F4aa	they like girth over length but women come if different shapes and sizes too. some feel nice and tight and others feel like a bucket of warm soapy water. some dont like it too deep and some like it when you are pushing into their cervix.    All shapes and sizes you see.|`|MyX42szoaa	Yes they do. 6 inches is about the average size and apparently they don't like em too big since it has the potential to cause pain.|`|qcDHyhdtaa	Anything under 6 inches is too small..over 9 is too big.  I got spoiled. My 1st lover was endowed.    That's just me though.|`|M4fiDYE6aa	no, im a virgin, I dont know what kind of penis I like.|`|yUMH5u6daa	I care.. it has to be normal.|`|AA12242940	In general, we don't look for big, just big enough. The threshold is relatively low enough to accommodate most guys, usually. For the one- and two-inchers out there, it is imperative for them to become skilled in the art of oral sex. A good tongue is hard to find these days!|`|uhchod38aa	If the man is considerate, it really shouldn't matter. If it's only an inch, that presents a challenge, but there are ways to work around it. Being hung like an elephant would actually be less desirable because that could be painful.|`|LR48Rtv2aa	I think women do in fact care about size.  But what I also think is that men think we care more than what we actually do.  A lot of men associate their penis size with how manly they perceive themselves to be.|`|4KlVkaDaaa	Generally, no.  I think that's a myth created by porn made by men.  Women are far more interested in erotica, romance, foreplay, and everything that leads to good sex.  It's knowing what to do and how to use it that counts.|`|AuDzLYWjaa	of course they do. would u want a girl with no ****? they are human just like the rest of us.|`|rhslylPZaa	As long as it's not too small or too big, I don't care.|`|AA12336246	A penis can be too small, and too big! I think shape is more important ;)|`|V1MptCMiaa	I'd rather it not be too big.  It can actually hurt when a mans penis is big.  But other than that, no I don't really care.
AA11764903	There are actually 7/8 different intelligences. The founder of these intelligences are by Dr. Gardner. He is amazing. I actually learned his ways at school. Intelligence comes in so many ways where it be word smart, logical smart, picture smart, nature smart, even person smart. I suggest you look up Dr. Howard Gardner's 7 intelligences. Intelligence- We all have it but like I said in different ways. The two most commonly known and are highly recommended in the school department are Word and logical smart.  You must look at intelligence from a different point of view, just because someone didn't score the highest on there GPA, or SAT doesn't make them stupid. It just means that they haven't "awakened"  those intelligences. It's complained to explain, but in my opinion, it's amazing that Dr. Gardner had discovered the 7 intelligences. Just see for yourself!|`|Kl4kv5khaa	Yes approximately 6 or 7 different intelligences. It boils down to what do you know and how much of it.  While you are in school, the schools are supposed to be able to adapt lessons to all 6 or 7 intelligent strengthened minds. That way all are able to learn the necessities of life their own way.|`|YCvgjLdnaa	I would say that some people are naturally born intelligent and so do not have too concentrate as much, or try as hard. however you can become intelligent by studying harder and concentrating more in class etc.  And people are intelligent in different ways, and in different subjects  some people dont have to try as hard and others have to try really hard, just to get the same grades.I guess its a bit unfair, but hey..that's life :) xxx|`|j2glsImzaa	They way I see it, people only call other people intelligent if they are smarter than them or if they think they are smart for their age.
6kUx7fwcaa	That is a quote that expresses an irony of how some people live their lives, since once your dead, your toys are meaningless.

H8LfYkpvaa	Hi there.     It sounds like you are an introvert - that is, given choice, you prefer to be alone versus with others - and meeting new people is probably a chore unless they share a lot of common interests.    A lot of this is very normal. It's normal to want to study the depth of life, and seeking comfort by reviewing thoughts is okay in moderation.    As you said, it's also important to be fully present - or "all here". Part of being here is going out and forcing yourself to be around people, and going into unfamiliar situations, even if you don't want to. A lot of the time, when you complete tasks, you feel better AFTER you complete it - even though you dread it BEFORE you do the task. This is how you get out of a "funk", and this is how you gradually build your self-esteem.    By the way, college is TOUGH. You're in the stage of life that involves learning about who you are - soul searching, figuring out what path to take, etc. It might help if I tell you that you have plenty of time - most people are not taking until their mid-30's to figure out who they are (the ages 18-36 is a stage I call adult-escence LOL)    You can begin "snapping" out of the funk that you're in by getting things done - at your own pace - and in your own way - but definitely by getting things done. You don't have to get them done exactly like everyone else.     You probably have a greater need for privacy than the average person and this is normal - but don't let it become a problem - reach out and make new friends whenever possible.    And finally, counseling always helps - for EVERYONE, even when things are going well. Why? Because it provides an objective view from a professional. Just a thought. :)    Best of luck to you!|`|af644b7256e7bf5a53974bb99a32d482aa	Seek some counseling. Honestly, you sound like you are suffering clinical depression, and you can't beat that without help.  Good luck to you.|`|gZJEroLiaa	I agree spending time alone is great but to much time alone can be detrimental if you constantly get lost in your thoughts. Try to get out more or talk to friends on the phone, computer etc.|`|ScATHphGaa	I think u should come live with me. I'd take good care of u :) OK, enough of me being an agressive lesbian - Look, just grow up. I don't mean that in a bad way. The thing is, I went through what ur going through. I think a lot of young people have. I've learned that life moves on. There may be things we have to deal with, I mean MAJOR things, but life moves on. Don't think I'm minimizing ur problems cos I'm not. But don't let anything be an excuse for not facing reality and moving forward.    What got me through my hard times was my TRUE friends. U need to figure out who's ur friends and who's not (because getting through my problems also taught me that). Ur friends will be the ones picking u up when u fall and pushing u forward and cheering u on. Giving u inspiration. NOT the ones who want to wallow in ur problems with u.    I hope u get where I'm coming from and r not offended by my honestly. I really want u to succeed.|`|fNv6yVqzaa	I do the same thing... but I don't think it's a problem. Maybe you have to learn to work with it. Like take a class that has the same type of people.  So you're independent. There's really nothing wrong with you. Least I don't think so.
2iqBP8cLaa	It's more like you get to a point where you totally accept that what other people think of you (or me, whatever) are their own feelings and have nothing to do with who you are.  It's their thoughts/feelings/observations, whatever - their issue to think about and not yours.    So to answer your question, absolutely you can get to the point where you don't care what other people think of them on a certain level.  Life is too short when you have your own feelings/thoughts, etc. to balance out, why worry about trying to figure out how to balance someone else's life?  (Unless you're in that business).|`|7BZYUHpjaa	i think everyone cares about what others think about them. and if they tell you they dont then theyre not telling you the truth.|`|V675pNwiaa	I dont deep down but then i get over it and dont care anymore|`|tTIXhe7daa	We is not me or you but probably somebody else. So don't label people in we because we don't mean we it mean somebody else.|`|urQQ6kbcaa	You do get to a stage in your life when what others think of  you just doesn't matter. When you know who you are & feel confident in your skin life's a whole lot rosier!|`|EZmDdNl2aa	Not possible. Everyone cares a little about how others see them. Anyone saying otherwise here is a liar.
1JSblCBsaa	Maybe he likes you and gets nervous when you look smokin' hot, so he acts like an *** or avoids you to cover it up.      what do you mean "i noticed something else"? Was there a part 1? lol|`|tTIXhe7daa	Get your mind out of the gutter before you start becoming paranoid.
uhchod38aa	He likes you. When you dress up, it especially reminds him that he likes you. But you've turned him down in the past so he's trying to play it cool. The fact that you caught him looking should tell you that.|`|qcDHyhdtaa	He's trying to get his blue-liner to go down. He likes you.|`|s65op1hGaa	Maybe he does like you and when you dress up he thinks your trying to impress other guys?|`|iHKJsyfTaa	Maybe your business outfits are ugly .    "If you can't say something nice , don't say anything at all."|`|DpbZdIsUaa	Lol!  Think yourself lucky.  It seems to be opposite for me,  If i get dressed up (because I'm going out after work or something), I constantly get asked who I'm trying to impress or someone who has a major crush on me thinks I'm dressing up for him.  I tell you what, that is far more irritating than being ignored when you're dressed up.|`|ZjrFsYz5aa	He doesn't want you dressing like a slutt.|`|jf1f7vNxaa	If he comments on how nice you look when dressed up, he's exposing himself to a sexual harassment case.|`|AA11674745	Sounds like "he" might really be a "she" under the hood. Your dressing like a knockout leaves "shim" flamingly jealous.|`|8miMWB64aa	Fun fact:  69.45% of men are oblivious to when someone is dressed up or not.  (Note:  95.35% of statistics are made up.)    It's quite possible he's not treating you any differently at any time.  If you dress up and expect him to notice you more then, but he doesn't, you may feel like he notices you less when you dress up.
AA11633383	Depression can be a serious condition requiring outside help, however before going there lets look at a few things:  -You're away from your friends.  -You're in a new place.  You've gone from being a Senior who knows it all to a Freshman who knows very little.  (Which will change!)  -You're uncertain about the future.  -It's winter and that really can affect people's moods.      So what to do:    1. Call some of your friends.  Send them an e-mail.  Maintaining ties over a distance can be tough but it can be done.    2. Are their any groups on campus that seem even REMOTELY interesting to you?  Extra curricular activities can be one of the best things about college.  Also you'll connect with upper classmen who can help teach you the ropes.    3. Uncertainty about the future.  You would be surprised how many people are in the same boat.  Probably most of your class, whether or not they admit it.  This may take some time to sort out, but that's OK!  Try to take general classes that will fit most majors.  And don't be afraid to try out some more specialized classes if you think that might interest you.  Is there a career center of any kind?  Maybe there is an apptitude test you can take.  Might help you sort things out.    -Winter.  Not much we can do about that, but remember that each day brings us closer to spring.    -Finally if you have an advisor or counselor you can talk to DO NOT HESITATE TO DO THIS!!!      I hope this helps.  :-)|`|538a3c5b1e9686434b5bf75aa651572faa	I get depressed quite a bit. I find that going for a walk really helps. I also discovered that joining an old time ballroom dancing club is a good way to meet people and stay fit at the same time.|`|C6XF82Mnaa	A friendship never parth with distance, time, death, or anything. So eventhougth you are distance in space but maybe you can make it closed in your hearth. And I think, You can get another friend in your college, and more friends is better.    Don't hate yourself.  I'm ready to be your friend.|`|fdcbdb56252d1caf7416c0866d1723c2aa	Sounds like you may just be going through a bout of depression.  Are there counselors that you can speak to at the college you go to?  Are you able to get out and get some exercise--I mean how many classes do you have and how much homework?
KG3MptIdaa	I've been out of work for over a year... I lost my job because I had a baby. I was told I had maternity leave for three months, was on it for two, and then got a letter in the mail I was a month short in qualifying for the leave so I was terminated due to dereliction of duty. And now I have this baby to support on no money when i use to make $16/hr... I feel the same way, but keep you head up hun. Hopefully Obama can help get the economy back on track. For now, just try to occupy your free time as much as possible. Find a cheap or free hobby, exercise, whatever. Just don't become a depressed blob on the couch, sitting around doing nothing will always make you feel less purposeful in life.|`|igI5yX0vaa	I am kind of hunkered down but happy.  I have my job and my health.    Understand that nothing is permanent.  The economy will improve and so will your life.|`|4tFuosueaa	Wait it out. I've been through a lot of recessions. None quite this bad, but it will change and if Mr. Obama keeps his word thing will be a lot better for the middle class.....finally!|`|wyXCRGv6aa	don't worry about it.|`|hhcrxPWLaa	Not straight?  Is that a gay joke...?
aIZfiU6Kaa	I am now a recovered alcoholic and I've not had a drink since joining AA in 2006.    The liver does regenerate itself but only for so long, my wife died of liver failure when she was 50 years old from alcoholism.    It's also true that alcohol destroys brain cells but you have a lot to spare, as a depressant alcohol does deplete your feel good factor, but more importantly your will power and your acceptance that you have a problem, all quite common in alcoholics.    I went into rehab in 2006, they gave me Librium for a week to help wean me off alcohol,  my liver thank god is now back to normal, my intelligence and will power have returned, I got remarried last year and at the age of 66 I feel as good and happy as a teenager.    It depends on how long you've been drinking as to how long it will take to recover, I drank for nearly fifty years and it took me about 3 months to feel the way I do now, and about a year to know that I will never drink again, my late wife was not so lucky.|`|ihxSSjd3aa	No, alcohol does not deplete slowly but it does kill directly your natural good feeling chemicals fromyour brain.    need explanation?  It is a law, meaning people have studied and proven it    How about medications?  Medication is taken with proper directive.|`|dzuiWVZjaa	the good thign about ur liver is tht it regenerates itself which no other organ can, apart from the skin    alcohol is a well known depressant thts y if u suffer from depression or having a bad day, don drink it!    x    hope this answers ur question|`|gebIjqnWaa	I know that alcohol destroys brain cells when you get drunk and it is very addictive. Illicit drugs eventually turns you into a fried egg. Stay away from the two.
2mHbi6Exaa	i got off work one night and had a terrible feeling something was wrong with my mom. i couldn't get reception on my cell phone so i decided to just drive out to her. when i got to her work there were 2 guys robbing her store. i called the cops and they were arrested. turns out they were in a bunch of trouble for some business fraud a couple states away.|`|07YBD5mJaa	every day i seem to listen to that "inner conscious".It's great to have, for little things here and there or what not, but It has helped me out of some very dangerous situations. Myself, my husband, and a very close friend of ours went to our Local Walmart not too long ago. After shopping we remembered that we had rented a movie from our local video store that needed to be returned. So as we're driving towards the store we all had this strong feeling that we'd shouldn't go into the video store. Not thinking much of it, we called it a night a headed home. Well, a few days later we were told that that very video store was robbed that night, shortly after we had decided not to go. Two people were shot and injured while being robbed.  if we would have gone in, we would have been robbed as well, and God forbid something horrible could have happened to the three of us.      my advice, listen to that inner voice, your intuition. It could save your life!|`|ec35c45458d391650124caccb1cab120aa	Whenever I'm around people I know I shouldn't be with. My mom says that my intuition and good decisions are one of my best qualities. =D|`|XZlFLecLaa	yeah !!! all the time! always go with your instinct ...|`|ZVUrLZpXaa	I use it constantly...|`|5lbKGofgaa	Just this morning.  I got something out of the pantry and shut the door...then as I walked down the hall I had a feeling that one of my kitties might have walked in so I went back and opened the door and there was Yumi!|`|P6kw1Umxaa	my gut feeling comes when something bad is going to happen.. whenever i go with my gut feeling to make a decision it's always wrong.|`|c3h3qgNpaa	neva   i always do da opposite and i also  end up getting it wrong|`|1u5beEnjaa	When Im being lied to it usually kicks in and lets me know. Even people good at lying dont usually get by me.|`|dVMfCdikaa	Intuition is sometimes mistaken for a reflex from repetition but since I have been in many new situations and used it, I would say the outcome has been good. I believe if you put your mind to anything it will happen but letting yourself be guided by Intuition in hard or unsure circumstances is good.     The funny thing is that when you use it people will say it is just coincidence but to yourself it was a choice, freaky!|`|uzWqpG0Maa	When I travel, especially to foreign nations and I don't speak the language or really understand the fine points of the cultural situation. Many times I have been in rough situations in macho places on the Gringo Trail. Other men are sizing you up, victim or equal?  Respect or grief. Back ally's of Asia, dark places, drunken crowds of locals and you are the only foreigner in sight, turn the corner into a riot , Muslims acting up near a mosque (somewhere India), walking the Tondo district of Manila or Smoky Mountain, when I got hijacked by the Western District Police of Manila and taken from bar to bar as they tried to drink me under the table. Driving like crazy men and showing me their guns under their shirts. Yes, I did use my intuition and knew when to hold 'em and when to cut and run.  Outrider.|`|72H4hFaHaa	I use it all the time. It's a 'gut feeling' to do or not to something or to do something differently. Some people describe it as 'a little voice in their head'.  So far my intuition was always right, even though sometimes it was against 'logic'.  One example would be: recently I felt the urge to drive to work using the side streets rather than the main road. When I arrived at work at my usual time I heard that there had been an accident blocking the main road both ways for 2 hours.

I don't suggest it. You could hit your head or get other injuries in the fall.|`|ic7GSkM1aa	don't lock your need just fall over kind of like you lost your balance watch some videos on youtube of people fainting|`|zE6KabiWaa	you have to hyperextend them, go less than 0 degrees
4f98fad5ad9e1132273168090fa4638faa	I am like you, I am an extrovert, funny, the life of the party when I am around people, but I am more happier being at home. It is where my "stuff" is. It is your comfort zone. Just know whatever age you are, you are normal.|`|V675pNwiaa	Thats normal sometimes you just want to be at home.|`|Kl4kv5khaa	You feel out of sorts, it will pass.|`|6kUx7fwcaa	Home is where the heart is.  Accept yourself.  There are all kids of people, and there should be.  Just accept it.  Be what you you want as long as you don't hurt anybody or yourself.|`|hxrJo6Z4aa	You're probably a cancer. Jk|`|bOxlw3ZHaa	I'm the same way sometimes, I go 6-7 months before I'll go out with my friend to a bar or something. There is nothing wrong with you, you just prefer to chill at home, I do too. how old are you? maybe you've already had your party time and prefer having more fun at home, lots of people are like that Anyways going out but then they realize there tired of it and just prefer to have fun at home but you can have loads of fun at home though.|`|7BZYUHpjaa	i dont think anything is wrong with you. thats like me. i have a lot of friends and they ask me to go out but i never really want to though i do sometimes force myself to go out. i just enjoy relaxing at home. its normal if you ask me.|`|AA11216736	its fine im the same way just learn to accept yourself oh and force yourself to go out SOMETIMES you are extroverted as you say so every thing will work out and you will have a good time. then maybe you will get a sneak peek of the other side of the fence and you will want to stay there. change, its just a part of life. if you stay the same thats fine too but dont waste your time do something that is worth your time. i force  myself to go out sometimes and i end up having a good time but im still a "homebody" thats just who i am. Oh maybe meeting a girl will make you want to go out more because if you meet some one you like you will most likely want to spend time with her and go out with her.
uhchod38aa	This particular guy may be persistent. He may think that if he keeps trying, eventually she'll come around. Maybe he sees it as a challenge. Edit: When she gives short responses, she thinks that should put him off; he finds encouragement in the fact she responds at all.|`|63fe052e0e72a9279edf979222302c66aa	ok most guys are clueless we are just not not that smart and we know nothing about women|`|Dk2XsR8kaa	You made a mistake. He understood he has a chance.|`|6H1ie8WXaa	Maybe we're just more aggressive in pursuing women than vice versa?|`|M4fiDYE6aa	My dad does that alot! I think its most guys not all.|`|8miMWB64aa	The whole concept of "signals" is asinine; people really should drop it.  A "signal", practically by definition, is a short symbol with a larger implication.  Such a thing would only work when there is an agreed upon convention for signals.  (Examples range in anything from "lol" on the net to "10-4" on a radio to "SOS" on the ocean to sign language to real language to... well, you get the point.)    Just like words, signals are useless without a clear meaning.  Misinterpreting them is a potential source of endless drama.  I just ignore them altogether.    There is such a thing as realizing a behavior, though, which I think is what you mean.  I suppose he may just be continuing since that's what people have to do.    I mean, seriously, how many girls just agree to anything from dates to sex right off the bat?  A lesson of growing up as male is the call for persistence.  Women are fickle, and this doesn't always mean that they change their mind against men; often times, they change their mind about rejecting.  It's even common in nature that a male animal makes many advances towards a reluctant female before she embraces the idea of mating.|`|UspK4SQBaa	Most people are.    It's not fair to lead people on, even if it's not intentionally.  She should tell him straight up that she's not interested, and that she'd like him to please stop contacting her.  It's actually less cruel.  If he continues after that, then he's just a jackass, and she should block him.|`|V1MptCMiaa	Easy - guys are idiots.
o5Tb8ZQ0aa	It's a part of the ever loving addiction process. You are never recovered and since they don't use they are keeping you clean and in the back of your mind they are a kind of enemy.   Also, your grandparents didn't save you from that life with your own parents and those are the parents that raised one of them. So in a way they are also as guilty as your own parents for allowing you to use, and live that way by being apathetic.  People with addiction disorders, get frustrated and angry easily because they usually have a personality disorder of some kind to begin with and the drug lifestyle fed the action oriented part of that disorder. Example: the desire needs chaos to function best. or close contacts of touch. and during using you had those fulfilled. now that you're clean you are edgy because you need to stay away from those things or else you could fall back into an abuser again.   Good Luck!!! Stay clean!! stay lean but stay healthy!! try to forgive even though it's a *****!|`|ZZQk010faa	They remind you of how down and weak you were before. That you could not do it without them. You always hurt those that love you. They are easy targets. They do not hit back.  Thank them, love them. Learn that they helped you live.  Be grateful.|`|Kl4kv5khaa	Guilt within yourself that you put them through that? I am not sure why you feel this way but perhaps you need to talk to them. Try everytime they do something that annoys you, stop and rationalize what exactly is it and what you can do about it.
1PHbUIYlaa	Most guys equate being called sensitive to being called a wuss.  Most men pride themselves in not being carried away or controlled by their emotions.|`|UspK4SQBaa	Any emotion shown other than anger is looked down upon in macho male society.    EDIT: Guys don't get mad at anything, but sensitive guys do.  I wouldn't point that out to him, as you may be taking your life in your hands.|`|V1MptCMiaa	Cause they're supposed to be all strong and macho.  In their dreams.|`|MyX42szoaa	Men aren't supposed to be sensitive. Their supposed to be tough.|`|9tnZeIvDaa	I don't get mad.  Call me anything..just spell my name right!|`|AA12219135	You've found a way to differentiate between men and guys.  A guy will be offended or pissed.  A true man won't and accept the observation.|`|qPlx1Ejhaa	Women usually say a guy is being too sensitive after she insults him and he reacts negatively.|`|LR48Rtv2aa	Men are supposed to be macho, right?    I think it's just another one of "society's" crazy ideals of how the two genders are supposed to behave.|`|8miMWB64aa	Sensitivity is a feminine characteristic.  It may be an insult to their gender identity.    On the other hand, they may just be upset that you're misrepresenting them.    Edit:  Have you ever tried telling your girlfriend just before her period that she's being senstive due to PMS (when you know it's medically true)?  No, you haven't.  I know because you're still alive.  :P  Point being, people in general seem to hate it!|`|uhchod38aa	Because they are sensitive about being sensitive?|`|mnXxJtqmaa	idk.  its a compliment....
c3h3qgNpaa	just keep telling him that   you value his friendship and his very talented  of course not in a mantra like way    i mean weneva he starts doubting himself and u notice|`|tHDkxCy3aa	-tell him that God will never turn down who does his best and to accept his destiny. future hasn't happened yet and its in his hands. he shouldn,t worry as long as he is he pleased with himself...........etc  -your words' effect however is temporary. the real cure is to participate in social activities and serving the society he will have working relations with his colleagues that grows into friendship. also these activities will help proof he can do something and he is effective in society....|`|Kl4kv5khaa	I do not know. I would have to know why he feels that way and he may not know what to expect from others.  I have met ones like him but that was because they were home schooled. And once he started getting used to a regular school and meeting others, he was fine.
2jxWrnUGaa	haha!! your so funny!    now stop makin fun of me! Jk Jk!    idk... good question!    edit: could i have a sip?|`|ftixHrOnaa	Don't make fun of me.. They're not!! :P|`|wufY5yXkaa	how many insane people do you run into?    if that were really the case they probably wouldn't do as much damage because people would be like HOLY CRAP, THAT GUY HAS OJOS LOCOS!1!!1ONE!!  and then they'd haul butt.    people on movies and tv, when playing insane people, probably use the big eyes because it's creepy and more menacing.|`|uzWqpG0Maa	They don't want to miss a thing. By the way, yours are a bit wide...|`|MnGGEMwBaa	Why are people saying idk. They are tense and exited for no reason. If you were about to crash your bicylcle into a pole youd look like a horny vampire aswel. Just tense Edit: Also like when fat kid see's cake|`|tHDkxCy3aa	-they come like that on tv to scare you.  -however if that is true , then it's probably because they have weak control over their nerves so they can't set it right , u may notice they are shivering.....|`|ZZQk010faa	Mine aren't......|`|LDSL0DUiaa	Lol...  idk|`|1D2UiAJeaa	O_O    EDIT: lol brownie|`|h7uHcpBhaa	your eyes look fine
Kl4kv5khaa	behavior (see spelling differences) refers to the actions or reactions of an object or organism, usually in relation to the environment. Behavior can be conscious or unconscious, overt or covert, and voluntary or involuntary.  Mental functions and cognitive processes are terms often used interchangeably (although not always correctly so, the term cognitive tends to have specific implications - see cognitive and cognitivism) to mean such functions or processes as perception, introspection, memory, creativity, imagination, conception, belief, reasoning, volition, and emotion  in other words any thing we do with our minds.  That both are about dealing with everything outside of our own minds.|`|I8voelnWaa	complicated, hazy and foggy
AA10287830	I don't think there is a certain personality that does this.  Some people are just greedy and they have to want to be different before they change.  Most people never see their faults enough to want to change until the behavior becomes unacceptable to them.  He can change only when he decides to.|`|lSAdkvDFaa	A tight scrooge thats wat type. And there are loads of them out there too.|`|lwG6tvOqaa	A person that gives someone something, and doesn't seem botheree by the idea, and then shortly there after, that person demands their stuff back.    When dealing with people like that, try not to accept things from them.

They tend to be greedy people.|`|c3h3qgNpaa	a tight ***
79WvpmeBaa	Well I looked up the meaning of some of those words in a dream:    Lake  To see a lake in your dream, signifies your emotional state of mind. You feel restricted or that you are unable to express your emotions freely. Alternatively, the lake may provide you with solace, security, and peace of mind. If the lake is clear and calm, then it symbolize your inner peace. If the lake is disturbed, then you may be going through some emotional turmoil.    Death  To dream about the death of a loved one, suggests that you are lacking a certain aspect or quality that the loved one embodies. Ask yourself what makes this person special or what do you like about him. It is that very quality that you are lacking in your own relationship or circumstances. Alternatively, it indicates that whatever that person represents has no part in your own life.    Running with your friend  To dream that you are running with others, signifies festive and prosperous times.     What a terrible dream. You were probably vey relieved when you woke up.|`|7BZYUHpjaa	wow thats quite a dream maybe youre just feeling like you dont have enough support and enough people to talk to. maybe youre missing all your old friends and wish you still talked to them. maybe you feel like your one true friend is the last one in the dream with you. its hard to interpret dreams. but thats what i think it may mean.

899c6a371bce238646502edb0cee925aaa	I thought that the image, in fragments, went through the retinal ganglion cells, through the thalamus, and into the visual cortex where it was processed and sent back to the front of the brain.  However, seeing as visual cortex is not an answer, and it is true that nobody knows exactly where image generation occurs because the brain is such a complicated system, I would have to go with C.
mo3SwJfOaa	Luckily my older brother is a psychologist of sorts, and usually if you have physical contact with someone you are interested in during a dream, it means that youre having insecurities about yourself whenever you think about him, according to him|`|UKtZS3Wraa	it means you want to be closer with him. in the dream, did you enjoy it when he did?|`|NBT5PoRVaa	dreams don't mean anything. i bet you want it to mean something though.|`|j2sxi6Gvaa	It just means that you were thinking about it somewhere in your mind, maybe even subconsciously...

899c6a371bce238646502edb0cee925aaa	Well sometimes you can examine why something is there by wheat happens when it is gone.  When people get sleep but are disturbed and do not dream, after a couple days they begin to have hallucinations and delusions.  This tells us that dreaming is necessary to brain function.  We know that sleep is necessary to learning (because we can study learning across sleep and not across sleep) and this may also have to do with dreaming, though to my knowledge it has not been examined.    I don't think you really know what causes dreams, because nobody really knows the processes involved.  We know psychologically what goes into dreaming - various recent activities and thoughts, etc. - but what activates it, and how does it occur?    I think that dreaming may be a neurological system's necessity for maintenance - our brain flushes backward with the signals it has received; it balances and cleans out the old and solidifies that which must be maintained.  We just happen to experience it, every so often, in a way we call a dream.|`|YCvgjLdnaa	i dont think anyone knows exactly why, but its to do with your mind and things you are thinking about, or have thought about recently. which is why you dreamt of the aliens when you saw them on the news.  The mind is a very complex thing and so is very hard to understand.  Sometimes dreams have nothing to do with that day, and we hardly ever remember them. We have over 36 dreams every night. xxx
sG7E4vDgaa	All spiders are deadly killers, especially the one under your chair.    Fear of spiders is normal.  I hate walking through a web or seeing one on me.  But watch a spider through a window and they're really interesting.|`|af644b7256e7bf5a53974bb99a32d482aa	Seek counseling.  Very few of them are poisonous, which makes your fear irrational. You can be cured.    Personally, if they stay in their own corner, trapping & eating flying nuisances, I let them live--they earn their keep!  But if they wander around the hose, like Daddy long-legs do, I squash them.|`|fkQUCwUhaa	maybe because they look really unusual and move just a little too fast so it blurs when they move....damn what other creature does that ?|`|YCvgjLdnaa	There are many reasons why you could fear spiders.Loads of people do, just like i fear small spaces.  You might fear these because of a past experience, or something you have seen - maybe on TV - that has scared you. Most people get these fears because they build what is a small fear in their head into a phobia.  As i dont know you then i dont know exactly why you are scared but the reasons for most people are ;   - Bad personal experience  - Seen personally - or on TV  - Build from a dislike into a real irrational fear.
899c6a371bce238646502edb0cee925aaa	I have heard that same argument, for babies.  It is not true for adults.  However, adults usually have very adverse effects from sensory deprivation.  Regardless of if they develop illness due to lack of emotional stimulation, they still need it to develop mentally.  So yes, during development it is necessary.  However after development, while many people will say it is absolutely needed, it really isn't necessary for life.    --edit--  I'm sorry but I have to add that the aforementioned movie is a fiction, as human clones have not been successfully made (and proven).|`|fvawLM1naa	It is not a simple emotional physical dichotomy.  Many died because physical stimulation is necessary for proper brain development, just as good nutrition and mental activity develops the brain. Feelings are not what we need.  However, they are inherent in our evolution.  People vary in levels of affect, but the question does not really address the point.  We do not need feelings in the way  we need food or water.  However, our values are based on feelings, and our values define our lives|`|Kl4kv5khaa	There is a movie you need to watch where scientist made humans and found that unless they gave the clones emotions they would die off. So it is needed.
iUzSlmSbaa	He may have feelings but he is absolutely right.. no display of feelings are supposed to be shown at the workplace... if you are colleagues that is as far as it is supposed to go at work.. what happens between colleagues outside of work is their business but if you gossiped out of line about something..you have to understand he does not want to endanger his job over a possible relationship.. you only know him as a co worker.. it may only be a crush you have on him. You never dated privately and I don't know what you told management about you and him.. if he never had a relationship with you.. did you make it sound as if there was something going on between you and your colleague.. that would be untruthful..  as he did not date you.. I believe his job is very important to him and after your ''breach of confidence'' there is no chance that he and you will ever be a couple... Move on and try to date someone outside of work... it might have worked out if you had been a lot more sublte and nothing happened between you and him.. so why did you talk to management and risk your own job and his?|`|Kl4kv5khaa	The heart, what to do about her when business is involved?  I do feel for you, so much. But you know what is on the line and neither of you want to have to face the repercussions of love in the work place. So I say cool it off and look else where even though it hurts. If you care about him as much as you say you do, you could never do anything to jeopardize his future and yours too.  Good luck. Maybe something could turn up in the future with him. Stay positive.|`|4f98fad5ad9e1132273168090fa4638faa	He is probably just being nice to you if by now he has not asked you out on a date. Whatever you said, you need to think of something to reverse it. Get on with your life. Work and sex do not mix. He lost trust in you when you talked. Talk about that you have a new boyfriend to fix things at work. Just know its up to you to "fix" it.

What is defined as "ladylike" anyway.<br>  <br>  I'm a firm believer of what's good for the goose is good for the gander  (within reason).  Crack your knuckles all you want, hon, but I do think it makes your knuckles bigger.

But you don't have to be conditioned and defined all your life by those influences. So it is good that you are asking yourself this question...     We can only grow as human beings and become happier if we can question ourselves, acknowledge our weaknesses, try to better understand the world around us outside our close circles and let ourselves change.    Thinking poorly of women can also be a sign of deeper insecurities, such as fear and feelings of inadequacy or rejection. It is absurd to be prejudiced against half of the world's population.    Good luck to you|`|mZVk3fP4aa	Because you're hung up on yourself.

Edit @ Professor Loiterer  Tiny brain:   I shall teach you something; you don't know good grammar.  "i know this things." should read "I know these things."

NAGiNKFWaa	Well you need to see if you can figure out what triggered this.  There could be an annoying person in his life that is bugging him.  Maybe a baby sitter or someone that has triggered this fear.  I don't think a child this young would know to be afraid of bugs, it is possible that someone in his life is fueling this fear.  I would talk to someone in your church for help, or seek a child psychologist to help him.  There is probably an issue here that really doesn't have to do with bugs at all.|`|gKciLUBLaa	try to get him close enough so that he can see you and a bug, show him you interacting with it i.e going up to it maybe even touching it if possible, try assure him everything will be ok.<br>  <br>  If not it might be quite a serious affliction, and might need professional help.
CCKFIUEuaa	Reading someone's body language is so much fun and so interesting. Experience is key! Hire out some books at your library on body language and psychology. Try speaking to an extremely diverse group of people so you can understand how totally different people are still very similar.   Online communication is hard to analyze. Usually you can tell something about a person by the way they type, how much information they give out on MySpace/Facebook etc, what their pictures are like and such. The internet is an amazing way for someone to show their true colours because being online eliminates their fear of being judged. They subconciously become a lot more confident and whether they realize it or not, they let out a lot more of their personality than in real life.   Phone conversations, however, are very hard to read. You need to be very experienced to be able to tell what someone is thinking just by their voice. I'm sure there are books on how to read someone's voice.|`|XvO4iLk0aa	G Study clinical psychology and use the LDK. The LDK will connect you with the ultimate reality out of which we all arise. No, it's not god. That is a limiting concept developed by people.  Life Decryption Key  By Generalist 12-08     Life often looks like a secret puzzle or an encrypted message, especially when we are facing problems. We need to decrypt the message and make some decisions.  The first is to decide if we want to control our lives, or want to rely on an outside force. The second is whether we believe that causes produce effects. This document is intended for people who want to be responsible for their lives, and who accept that causes produce effects. Effects are produced by causes and  we have to make the right causes to get the effects we want. Those who want to control their lives rationally and responsibly, and accept that effects are produced by causes, please read on.    Instead of guiding ones life by the flurry of concepts, hopes, fears, and aphorisms we learn, it is more effective to conduct daily life while using a concise, accurate and short set of reality descriptions. We need a mental key to make the jumble understandable and make decisions more accurate and easier to enact.     The key exists. It is intended strictly to improve the conduct of daily life. It is a primer on how to improve the here and now. The future will be determined by how we deal with the present.     The question naturally occurs, What are the right causes to optimize life for oneself and others?    Please write down all the words of intangibles that attach to life such as love, imagination, dreams, life, hope, fear, hate etc. Then write down all the words that relate to the tangible aspects of life. Think of brain, body, table, car clouds, air, soil, and on without limit. Yet, there is no mind without a brain. There is no car without thought. There is no wood for a table without the intangible life of a tree. The list of tangibles and intangibles is endless in English. However, the inseparability of tangible and intangible aspects is summed up in the words Myoho.      Write down all the words for causes you can think of and effects those causes can have. They are all summed up in the words Renge-Causes simultaneously produce effects like the flower and the seed of the lotus.    Everything is always changing. Write down all the words that come to mind about things changing-Clouds, faces, butterflies, concepts, memories and on and on. They are all summed up in the Japanese word Kyo. Because everything is always changing, no one is stuck where shehe is.       The three words Myoho Renge Kyo include every aspect of life and exclude nothing.     This formulation, used with focused intention, serves as a life decryption key to enable anyone to see the relationships that exist between good concepts and harmful ones. It was derived over thousands of years by brilliant people in India and China and finally used as the title of the Lotus Sutra in Kumarajivas translation of the Lotus Sutra. A 13th century Japanese monk named Nichiren recognized it for what it is and realized that anyone could guide their life better by using this key. He discovered the great treasure of life where anyone had access to it and dedicated his life to providing clarification and access.    The way to use it is to add the shortened Sanskrit verb for focusing intention and create Nam Myoho Renge Kyo. This is spoken repeatedly with the palms pressed together to close the energy circle and focus the mind-brain-body on the essential realities. It releases delusions and limitations as reliably as vitamin C cures scurvy.    Since we each have our unique paths and desires, there is no prescription for what people should focus on when they use the tool.  It is all available. The human mind has vast possibilities to explore once we resolve the confusion. There is no intent to move anyone to think in a certain way. There is definite intention to help human beings to think more effectively in ways that improve their individual and collective lives.  For more detailed information see   http://www.sgi-usa.org. Or  http://www.SGI.org    Caveat; SGI does not use the term life decryption key. That term is my attempt to summarize the essence of the philosophy taught by SGI.|`|AA11239733	You just do it. You cant focus on it. You need to focus on the outcome of the read and the rest will fall into place.
2UDbOpxTaa	I picked it up at AS level, carried it on to A level, and now I'm doing a degree in it. I think it's fantastic, really stimulating and also applicable to the real world, unlike subjects where you're sat there thinking when am I ever going to use this??? It's really great, I recommend it.|`|GbiFRG5eaa	Yes at A level.<br>  Did enjoy it? Not really, whilst some theories are pretty much common sense based I found it more like brainwashing.<br>  To be honest, at the end of the day it is a bunch of academic theorists who tend to contradict each other as to how society and the individual should behave.<br>  Each decade seems to produce a different theory, Also, a "science" rooted in determining the uniqueness of the individual seeks instead to make everyone think the same way.  <br>  It's not for me I'm afraid, I believe in being an individual with independent thought.  There again maybe I'm just weird lol.|`|e50e6ca9411acd39c8aec91e4abe2b89aa	Yes, many courses at the university level and enjoyed all.|`|05bf614d400b126e98a6f037a990f73aaa	Yes, level 100. its really interesting and challenging.. a lot of critical thinking.|`|ixPskp3Oaa	I still am now.

nWHNbKIfaa	Do you think other guys are cute? I think you should be real with your boyfriend. Tell him exactly how he makes you feel when he calls other girls pretty. If he really cares about you then he will stop if not move on and find some who respect your feelings too.|`|fE8XV98Haa	Sit him down and tell him how you feel. Its not right what he is doing and he needs to know that. Guys can be? a little short on the brain cells if you know what i mean. There is nothing wrong with you. Ever girls goes through this. However if you focus on the qualities that you like best on, it also really helps.|`|c4KcwDZZaa	In my opinion, you should trust him if you really love him. IF YOU HAS SUSPICION ON HIM, hire a PI on him. If you totally don't believe him, break up.    But my advise to you, follow deep inside your heart. Find a quiet place, play some CLASSICAL music and think deeply, what you really think of your boyfriend.    Good Luck! I hope you will overcome this.|`|UsbkgrxIaa	if your bf is checking out girls in front of you...then you may want to talk to him about it and let him know that it's bothering you.

Don't take it personally or over analyze anything.|`|1fGBLJvVaa	someone ur w/ should think u are the prettiest girl in the world and if they cant see that than it just isnt right|`|fkaZPupsaa	He's probably cheating on you....you should tighten his leash.|`|dQ0LpBiZaa	get a pet|`|VZFEB85Iaa	nothing is wrong with you.  something's wrong with him.  he shouldn't be telling you that these girls are pretty.  i'd feel very insecure and jealous if my boyfriend did that.|`|PJikMsi7aa	It's not your fault. Tell him straight up it's not ok to say things like that around you. All guys talk like that when we're around other guys but some aren't smart enough to realize that's guy talk, not appropriate in front of a girl, much less your girlfriend. I think everyone is insecure about something, so don't worry about it so much. You're perfectly normal and it's totally understandable. Just let him know he has to cut it out.|`|9xSsSb5eaa	definatly talk to him...... make sure he thinjs only about you and find out his past life with girls and if not then dump him and go out with someone who appreciates you for who and what you are

As for some tips; try to get out of the house more... you have to at least have on friend, or one close family member... tell them about your problem and ask if you can go out with them and their friends. You gotta socialize some more, my friend! Don't be afraid of other's rejection, I'm sure you will find your group somewhere, but not if you don't start trying.

The fact that you were in the back of the room signifies that right now you feel like you are on the back burner in his life...you want him to pay more attention to you and single you out and bring you to the forefront with his family.  You want to be a part of his achievements and happiness--by his side to support him.|`|zWBYxMvWaa	Dreams don't tell the future, how could that be?

You just wish it could be a normal happy friendship, since you like him to much.|`|whMygrGBaa	i dont know about dreams telling future, but because you were angry at him you might had a dream like this. you might be angry at the guy but you love him, so your mind used your dream to make the guy look better so you wont be angry with him anymore. because you cant love someone if you hate him. you said in your dream "During this I was so complete & so happy & proud just to be sitting next to him. & it was so realistic" probably after having the dream you werent angry at him anymore, but more over happy and probably you are telling yourself unconsciously that the guy has a lot good points. Just my way of interpreting your dream.|`|GGpkMLwUaa	Well, I do have dreams with snippets of the future. I found it out when I went to a camp in 5th grade. I had had a dream abput a.

ZMQLV1t4aa	Don't hate yourself for something like that. It's normal for someone to not like it for someone to disagree with them or tell them they are wrong. Nobody likes to here that they are wrong. No one. I know i don't. I do get mad too, but then i realize later that i was wrong and i apologize afterward. I don't hate myself for it though. It's not worth it. If you waste your time thinking about your flaws so much, you end up not changing them and ignoring the good qualities that you have. I know it sounds kinda corny, but its true. It's something you have to slowly change. So when someone tries to argue with you. Take a deep breath and try to remind yourself that it is an opinion and you should hear it out. If you don't like what they say afterward, then argue. Just make sure to reflect on it later and if need apologize.|`|j98CkMzVaa	First of all you are taking the first step in overcoming this problem by admitting it whreas other people like you would not accept it. You are normal most people are like this. If someone trys to give you a lesson then you feel like they are undermining you and treating you like a child. Get into your head when someone is trying to tech you a lesson to just take it on board and tell that to the. Then later on comtemplate on what they said and make your own conclusions. You are on the right path.|`|6dQzmsXuaa	Give value to others then you will listen the others and your attitude will be changed.|`|1IVEYMA9aa	Leave your attitude at the door, and be open minded.|`|QcbgIBghaa	high five|`|r2rU2Ehfaa	Dont worry, your not evil! I went through a stage like this. When someone offers you an idea or advice, then if you dont like it tell them politely that you dont agree but thanks anyway.

Good luck :)|`|jd6I0sk8aa	Aww, don't be so hard on yourself i understand where you are coming from because I am exactly the same.

I usually fuss and fight cause I know I'm wrong. But I don't admit right then and there, ya know? I know I'm wrong, but it sucks cause they're right. Makes me feel bad, but it's a habit.|`|XSEWADI0aa	you said :"but after a while, i started to think that they were right"<br>  there's your solution, wait and think before you respond to anyone, you can do it, it will take time, but you can..its called self control :)|`|dd6rgtL7aa	I think its best to try to gradually change your personality. It can be difficult, but obtainable. If you are being bone headed when someone is giving you constructive criticism and you later feel you were out of line - go back up to them and talk to them about it. You'll feel better, and there will be some sort of consequence for acting the way you do. In turn, over time you'll be able to become the even keeled person you want to be.
b919231cdc9dcf8edee5a210e4d7a40faa	Are you familiar with Purely Obsessional OCD (also called Pure-O or Pure Obsessional OCD) is a lesser-known form or manifestation of obsessive-compulsive disorder. For people with Pure-O, there are usually no observable compulsions, such as those commonly seen in those with the typical form of OCD (checking, counting, hand-washing, etc.) While ritualizing and neutralizing behaviors do take place, they are almost entirely in the form of excessive mental rumination. [1][2]<br>  <br>  The nature and type of Pure-O varies greatly, but the central theme for all sufferers is the emergence of a disturbing intrusive thought or question, an unwanted/inappropriate mental image or a frightening impulse that causes the person extreme anxiety because it is antithetical to closely-held religious beliefs, morals, or societal mores. While those without Pure-O might instinctively respond to bizarre intrusive thoughts or impulses as insignificant and part of a normal variance in the complex and creative human mind, someone with Pure-O will respond with profound alarm followed by an intense attempt to neutralize the thought or avoid having the thought again.<br>  <br>  I'm working on my bio-psych doctorate and I have OCD, the reason why you walk into people is probably because you use heuristics (kind of like shooting from the hip) in life so that you don't have to focus on what is happening to currently. By following people or walking next to them you can act without thinking, they do the decision making for you basically, and they pay attention to their surroundings so if you follow them then you can have all of those same benefits without having to focus. The reason why you sometimes walk into people is because, like I said, you are using heuristics so you use as little energy as possible in getting things done, you aren't actually focusing like you should. Now the balance may be something similar, but you shouldn't have to consciously focus on balance like you do for walking around so you must have really severe OCD is my assumption.
Gt8Ej1njaa	An excellent question! First of all, this is sometimes in the eye of the beholder. We can't help making judgements based on the information given. If you see someone for the first time and the only thing you have to go by is the way they are dressed or the way they look, it is only natural to have some assumptions. However, we might consider that to be 'judgmental' if we act on those assumptions without giving the person a chance to be known any better. If you are known to cast aspersions based on how someone acts without knowing their side of the story (or worse, not caring) then you might be judgmental.       Having Moral standards is a good thing, even if yours differs from mine. The thing to remember is that moral standards have to be reasoned against opposing views. Within yourself, an argument takes place that assesses information and then makes a judgment call. Then the test becomes living by those standards. Many are the hypocrite who assails others with high standards only to prove incapable of living by them when the pressure is on.       But, and this is a HUGE "but", when we express those standards without being asked, we will be called judgmental by those who disagree with us. As I said, it is often in the eye of the beholder.       "Judgmental" technically the making and expressing of judgments.|`|rroE37HTaa	To put it simple being judgmental would be like saying all teen mothers are sluts, having moral standards would chose abstinence for your self, and not labeling all teen mom's as sluts!   Having moral standards is something you would impose on your self, not others.   (a teen mom may have been date -raped, and because of HER moral standards chose not to abort!)|`|AA11530601	when you are judgmental you judge others,   when you have standards you simply keep to your own and let others keep to theirs.  having no standards morally is quite different from the actual quality of being open minded too as im sure you can see from the example below.  With no moral standards, someone might continually cheat on their partner but be very judgmental of a person for skin colour or social class and thus be closed minded.That would be someone who is not managing to be open minded despite having no moral standards.  I also think to equate having moral standards with being judgemental would be just as incorrect as to say that no standards = openmindedness,, because although moral standards can be judgemental, so can a whole load of non moral irrelivant standards e.g. whats in fashion and whats cool  so its possible to be moral and judgemental, but they are not linked as closely as some would say.|`|65653c6c063e99db1f7f272c5c93e006aa	We all have a value system we live by, it is how we navigate through this old world.  Expecting others to live by our set of values is where we often feel let down and begin to find fault in someone else.

c59485c5fb066f0af7ae58a856c4b126aa	Getting a masters or a doctorate might qualify you for teaching economics . . . but I'm not sure it's the best major for a good-paying job.     If you are going for a double major anyway, get the other in something practical. Business management, or electrical engineering, or even Dairy Management. Then your poly-sci or econ major will be looked on as extra value.     But just getting a degree in anything puts you ahead of the job race.    Good luck, and happy studying. (BTW, USE your university's resources when looking for a job. Your professors should have links in the field. Consult with them about the job possibilities.)    EDIT: if you have any skills whatsoever in the arts, you might look into getting an illustrators/econ degree. Drawing comic books about economical situations or political science situations may be the wave of the future. I know they use the comic books a lot in Japan to teach/propagandize people -- and I think it's starting to catch on in the States, too. Although the Austrian School of Econ --LOL! Yeah, comic books are about the right speed for that.|`|ktcGmpFPaa	The key is to double major in economics and Math & statistics --and then go to graduate school.

t2R3mEMoaa	This theory only holds true if one does not make the changes that will ensure a different path will be taken and this is a great deal of inner work on oneself. Once abused ones self esteem has dropped to an all time low and that makes one vulnerable to perpetraters looking to reoffend. And so the cycle continues until the courage is found to change and this isn't easy by no means, neither is it impossible. Much has changed over the years and statistics are better than before.  It is very frustrating at times to watch people go back into abusive situations on a promise that the offender has changed, but has done nothing to insure that it is true. The victims do not give themselves enough time to heal and so the cycle of abuse continues.|`|XvO4iLk0aa	G There is a very highly developed concept from a philosopher in the sixth century China named Tientai, who demonstrated that what you believe determines your environment. There are also many modern scientists who have partial, yet carefully researched answers to this question. They can be found in clinical psychology and in counseling programs at universities.|`|aNIiGpzeaa	i think its somewhat true. i personally think that you attract and choose what and who you want to, but,     my friend, lets call her sandy, so, sandy was abused by her dad when she was very young, now, she has an abusive step-dad and an abusive botfriend
vKFneEuIaa	I recently read a book on the Fed and Alan Greenspan. One interesting piece of information I picked up is the fact that the Fed and banks are responsible for a smaller percentage of lending than they were in the past. Venture capitalists and private lenders are now doing the majority of the lending. Thus the influence of the Fed is not as powerful. Perhaps the more pressing matter is to find a way to regulate these lenders and prevent similar catastrophes from occurring in the future.    Aside from that, it is most crucially important to ensure that legitimate business has access to capital. The GDP fell as much as 25% in the years following the great depression. If business at that time had had access to capital, much of the subsequent poverty and suffering could have been avoided. The fed needs to ensure that credit is available. It is like applying the brakes to a fast moving train. The harder you apply the brakes, the more you slow down. Prolonging a tight credit situation will slow down the economy too much, and it will take that much longer to regain the momentum. Regulation will solve the problem with speculative creditors, and fueling the economy with needed capital will solve the recession problem.             You can get much detailed info on the fed at Wikipedia. If you are really interested, an excellent book on the fed is William Greiders Secrets of the Temple. I read it years ago, and found it not only informative, but also one of the more interesting and well written books on the fed.|`|trMsK86jaa	Imagine data corruption on a computer, except this is a system critical file.
H55nCLqPaa	I'd cut state spending by around 60%. All of the saved money would be given back to the taxpayers.    I would require banks to hold a 100% reserve.    After that I'd do absolutely nothing and just let the economy recover on it's own.|`|cX79gknGaa	1. I would deliver truly substantive tax cuts to consumers and businesses, not tiny cuts that do little to spur growth.    2. I would radically reform the broken, soon-to-be-busted pyramid retirement schemes (Social Security and Medicare) that are by far the biggest threats to our economy going forward.    3. I would drastically reduce the size of both the federal and state governments.    That government is best which governs least   -Henry David Thoreau|`|ovdC82nRaa	1. i would create more jobs  2. i would  have every big business run inventory  and revenue report   along with pay rolls  3. remake  a ccc type thing to create city rebuilding projects
aNIiGpzeaa	females would be more organized, less cat fights about men.    men would slowy become dissorientated because usually they are lazy    thats just my opinion, so, no offense to anyone    EDIT:  oh, btw:    i think that both would fail due to imbalances. perspective plays an important role and when there is a lack of something like the different perspectives between men and women, well, things usually fall on their faces|`|AXNowGPyaa	I think both genders ought to be involved, but if we only picked one, how could we do worse than men? I am an adimirer of the Iroquois model, in whih a bunch of old ladies decided which wars were worth provisioning and which weren't. Men were free to go fight whoever they wanted, but they needed the female support to really make it happen.     I don't think a community with all of one gender ruling would be very good for anyone. But I do think we would be better off if we had a culture where women were in charge of feeding everybody and the men were charge of making sure everybody was tough enough to defend themselves. Right now we have a culture where male right-wing politicians block hungry people from eating while left-wing female politicians try to turn everybody into a ******* sissy. I am tired of both sides and ready to declare war on them all. The world at this point needs compassion and toughness.|`|XLQ9wCUaaa	Mr Vanhuizen has given one of the silliest answers I believe I've ever read so I had to answer.     I'm not sure how either community would operate but they definitely wouldn't last very long.    However. I'm a First Nations person (Maliseet) and before the colonizers arrived we existed in a matriarchal society for thousands of years and everyone was pretty happy. Women held a lot of the power.|`|uOI4Zy73aa	I think both would fail. Most men are usually lazy. And women like to fight among each other and have much more drama. The women would probably start killing each other.|`|rrMYRLpXaa	Replying to Mr. VanHuizen:    Women would NOT convert the country to socialism, because it has shown too much in history how the system fails. History does repeat itself, but I don't think that women are as stupid as to make it repeat again.|`|6H1ie8WXaa	Both a all-male community and all-female community would fail for different reasons. One difference between these communities though is the fact that men would run by hierarchial captalism and the women would run by socialism.|`|OTT79NAtaa	This answer seems to depend on whether you favor a technologically savvy yet perhaps somewhat objective and cuthroat capitalistic society, or a 3rd world type agrarian and barter society built in the image of socialism or communism.|`|trMsK86jaa	One of two scenarios for both;    1) On naturalistic impulse, the males/females tear one another apart.    2) They wouldn't.

uxwSd0KLaa	Yes its the beginning of your physic opening ; just stay alert to all messages you are receiving|`|xWg1krzBaa	Yes it is the very start of psychic capabilities.  You cannot test yourself you have to leave yourself open to be able to receive the signal.  You are not going to think about those things they are just going to come to you for no rhyme or reason but because you are touched by the gift, you are blessed.I've never heard of anyone attaining it by force.  Everyone has the ability to be psychic, whether they believe that or not, there are numerous reports in medical science that supports it.  Not everyone is able to tap into it for the simple fact that most humans only use about 10% of their brains.  I first had experiences when I around 8 years old. I have many gifts, not miss Cleo I see what is shown to me I get it in flashes of colors, premonitions, dreams.  They come to me though I do not seek them out for they will find me, it can be a wonderful thing it can also be a curse. I embrace it.

That is incorrect.  We have some lovely parting gifts for you.|`|qVmIokXPaa	mmhmm...... Good, however I'm sure you will never have to be concerned about it due to your lack of attention, Miss not biased.. haha..|`|7LSonIoraa	maybe they have better things to do|`|ZdAGJPlqaa	There is some truth to that I think. If the woman is attracted to the man she will see more of his attentions as flattery as that is what she wants to see, but if she finds the man to be unattractive she will tend to look upon what he says as distasteful simply because she is not interested in him.<br>  I have been complimented by men that I did not find attractive in the physical sense, but the compliment was sincere and well intended and not meant as a ploy to get into a physical relationship, I thanked them and appreciated the nice compliment.<br>  On the other hand I have known men that I thought were very attractive on the outside but inside they made me feel very uncomfortable by the ungentlemanly way they talked to me.<br>  I guess it comes down to your own perception, but I think women should be mature enough to know when a compliment is just that and lady enough to know when a man is a true gentleman regardless of his looks.<br>  My personal definition of harrassment is when a man keeps talking to me or touches me in a blatantly sexual way when I have told them not to and fairly warned them of the consequences of continuing, then if they do it again I follow through.<br>  I have found that if you act like a lady it is rare to have a man treat you with disrespect and if one does cross a boundary simply telling them in a nice way will set things right.<br>  And remember men get harrassed too, and deserve the same respect from us as we want from them.|`|IWWZdZRpaa	Harassment in itself is how a person internalizes someone elses behavior.  Two people can say the exact same thing and your reaction could be totally different.  I believe the quote.  If a charming man comments on how nice you look, it's flattery.  If an overweight sloppy oaf does it people fail to be flattered.|`|CHlxBbkHaa	It comes across that way because you view the good looking guy's comments as flattery.  If you were to put a bag over both of their heads then you'd see that there is some flattery to most of the comments but there is still desperation.  I don't think looks plays much of a part in the desperation.  I think that is personality based.|`|RpHewn8gaa	CAustin above is incorrect. Sexual harassment is simply unwanted sexual attention. No threats need to be involved. So pretty much by its very definition you're right because women generally want attention from good looking men and don't want attention from unattractive men.|`|kvIDcbBiaa	Sorry, I disagree.  I've been harassed by attractive and unattractive guys alike.  It's about respect, not desperation.|`|XwqePXrOaa	Well, as I said in the previous question, sexual harassment is using the bribe and/or threat of abuse of power as a negotiating tool for sex.<br>  <br>  Generally, if the sexual attention wasn't unwanted, no one would bother to threaten/bribe the other person for it.<br>  <br>  So yes, sexual interaction where the desire isn't mutual is usually pretty integral to genuine sexual harassment.
72H4hFaHaa	What you are concerned about is losing your friends and leaving an environment you are familiar with. - That's quite normal.   Even though some of your friends will be excited about their future prospects - they will feel sad just like you, to leave this part of their life behind.  Many people are afraid of change - and the future, because it's something we know nothing about and what we don't know frightens us.    There are things you can do, to make you feel better:  Concentrate on your future plans. Look at the best possible outcome, it will make you feel more excited about your new life.    Stay in contact with your old friends, talk to them about how you feel (and you might find that many of them feel exactly the same).  Plan to meet on a regular basis (like once a month or so) and exchange experiences. E-mailing  each other is another great way of staying in contact.    In order to achieve a happy life we sometimes have to leave friends behind, find new ones, get used to a different pace, accept a new situation, etc.  Leaving is never easy, but once you get over the initial sad feeling you may find your new life can be  just as beautiful and fulfilling.    Someone said once: Change is the spice of life  and I believe it's true
uxwSd0KLaa	They hit   on you not because the way you dress ; but because of your personality|`|ONWCXzUMaa	I hate to say it but don't take it the wrong way, a lot of men and this is coming from a man, will hit on anything with two legs and even sometimes four. Some may just be hitting on you because  you may be very attractive to.  take care  dave|`|uy6sBhipaa	Look cheap and easy. If that doesn't work, pin a sign on the back of you coat i.e. a note card taped on by an enemy, and pretend you don't know it's there. I won't tell you what to say on the sign but if you say the right thing I guarantee you will be hit on. You can also figure out what to put there and then position yourself next to the guy you want to hit on you. Or it this a trick question. There's a girl in America NOT being hit on?  Let us know! 8~)
PwvU3LQBaa	It's called "friends with benefits".  I had a friend like that.  We are still friends but without the benefits as I am now married.  Having sex with him never changed my friendship with him.  Neither one of us got jealous if the other had a girlfriend/boyfriend, we just stopped having those benefits if one or both was involved with someone else.  We didn't stop talking to each other, or stop being friends.  I just think some people can't separate their feelings when it comes to sex and friendship.  I had a guy friend who I never slept with become emotionally attached to me and I wanted nothing more than friendship.  I finally had to set him straight, in a nice way of course.|`|pzLDXL6gaa	Well some people do.

And was in an open relationship for about six months, which ended amicably as we drifted apart and I found someone new.<br>  <br>  Obviously I think it's fine to have casual sexual relationships, but they are not usually good friends, as the "friendship" usually disappears more or less as soon as you stop having sex, especially if one of you starts a relationship with someone else.<br>  <br>  I would never judge someone for having sex with a friend, but I don't think really close friends having sex is a good idea because it can get very complicated if one or the other ends up having more feelings or when one does get into a relationship. Would you rather have a shag and lose your friendship or resist the urge and keep your friendship? (Your answer to that will tell you whether or not you actually care anything about the so-called friend in question)|`|AA10873763	Maybe they just don't want to have sex with YOU.<br>  I don't have sex with my friends because I don't want to end up falling ***-backwards into another relationship.  But that's just me.|`|sfn6SpbCaa	Once you have sex you've become intimate; friends aren't intimate with each other.
iUzSlmSbaa	No that is not important to be great looking for an office job.. just neat looking and it's okay to be somewhat overweight... as long as you are not obese...  Some companies would not hire someone who was obese.. that means if your BMI is over the high part of overweight.. that would be obese.. some companies believe people who are very heavy are more likely to get sick or that they don't have the energy.. There ar also a lot of overweight people out there who got jobs.. so I would not worry about this now.. overweight is still ok ...looks should only be important if you are working as a newsreader... on TV.. if as a woman one works as a stewardess.. (one does not have to be great looking for that.. but meet body weight standards and also not be too small.. a receptionist who is overweight would not be so nice as she is the first person a client sees.. otherwise it really should not matter at all..if you look neat and well groomed with a good haircut and neat clothes and with the right attitude that is enough.. polite, professional, reliable as a worker.. willing to learn, always on time...etc...|`|2fSCAmLiaa	VERY...|`|fCxuvmJXaa	No, your face isnt a biggie, but make sure to dress nice and to look clean.|`|g2lQxz75aa	looks are the most important thing in  the hiring process...sad but true..if your ugly you have to work twice as hard and have twice the personality..when your cute people automatically like you and some managers will  just hire you  just to get to know you, but if your ugly you have to be supper nice and charming and have lots of credentials just to get the job. i  use towork @ this clothing store and my managers did not hire ugly people, fat people, people who didnt dress nice,ect..but good luck..|`|Kl4kv5khaa	No it is nothing but having to do with your abilities. I mean come on have you seen Bill Gates? Not the best of looks but what he came up with has made him worth billions.|`|AJeaWX8Paa	I do research in this area.  Unfortunately attractive people are rated more positively in almost every respect.  It's called halo error...when someone uses one characteristic (being really attractive) as a short heuristic for other characteristics (will the be good employees).      However, being well-qualified will overcome this effect.  Just all things being equal, attractive wins out usually.|`|2nJh3RIqaa	I would say yes to an extent.  I recently went on several job interviews. Most that interviewed me were men. One was a slightly older woman. Can you guess which job i got. While some people would purposly pick the more attractive candidate, others probably do so subconciously. But a clean image, a smile and the right attitude will probably get you a job.  Besides charming is better than good looking

Maybe    1/ you have an ability to help them  2/ you have an undealt with incident in your past attracting you to them. It will keep happening until you properly deal with it.  3/ you create it by insensitivity to their weight.    Remember a lot more women than we realise have eating disorders. Be sensitive to food, weight, comments about celebrities looking good and research eating disorders on net and what you can do to help someone with one.

He could have just given you the names of friends.  It doesn't make you racist it makes you an informed consumer.|`|f6f40965eb7d5df6aa94440ec71e32dcaa	Well, why wouldn't you hire a White guy from South Africa?<br>  <br>  And yes, interacism exists, especially when the person is from a different country.|`|s6GKHKccaa	I would say it does if you refuse to hire him based on just the fact he's from another country....And what if you miss out by not hiring this guy? He could be a very skilled contractor|`|qKkTI0jnaa	Are you trying to be funny?|`|KF8CHY2faa	CA Austin made a very good point. The famous actress Charlize Theron is actually a native South African who moved to the states when she was discovered. There was even a young white man that applied for an African American scholarship fund, and won the contest; but was denied the funding when it was found that he was ‘White’ according to American standards.<br>  <br>  I think the problem this poster has with this contractor that is of African descent is the fact that he could possibly use the term ‘African American’; based on the fact that he was once a citizen of Africa.  Do keep in mind that this was also a lame attempt at making a funny, but it speaks volumes of the posters dislike or maybe even fear of native African Americans. He probably wouldn’t have a problem with the contractor performing the services required, if he hadn’t discovered that he could use the title of African American. In which his true feelings towards blacks here in the U.S. is what’s causing his bias opinion of the contractor. <br>  <br>  He’s torn between the conflict of buying into the serotypes that he believes to be true of native born African Americans and trying to link this contractors ‘title’ or ethnicity to the negatives of those who look like the distant relatives of African American slaves. It’s truly ignorance’s at its finest, but hey, you can only expect ‘simple’ thinking form a ‘simple’ mind. It’s very difficult for someone who’s behind on the learning curve to think outside of what they’ve been taught in the past, because it’s hard for them to mentally comprehend and grasp new concepts of life and the people within it.|`|WCkEzzDpaa	Naw.  It just makes you a wary business man... as you should be.  Contractors in general are shady regardless of race or color.  Id check his previous jobs and see what he does.  Talk to his previous customers and see what kinda headaches, if any, he gave them thru the whole thing.  <br>  <br>  Its your money and your house man.

AA11899313	Ciao, Senior Gambino.<br>  I miei rispetti, la mia regina magificent di dancing.<br>  <br>  The answer is going to depend upon the individuality of this Capo, de tuti Capo.<br>  <br>  The need for an outward display of loyalty through apparent 'respect', would bolster his Authority over the organisation, from those whose role is to serve him and The Family. <br>  <br>  Therefore, he would need to appear to demonstrate a ruthlessness in dealing with the rigours of the organisation and its enemies, whilst at the same time, to appear to be 'with a heart' at times when some humanity would not come amiss.<br>  <br>  It all depends on the type of person he is and what areas within his psychological makeup he may need to reinforce.<br>  <br>  The whole Mafia make-up (from what little reading I have) reminds me of the Beehive.  The Queen Bee, being the Boss, her role it is is to keep the workers etc in line in order for the collective (hive) to survive and for her to go on producing eggs ~ in order to produce another Queen Bee to succeed her and so the cycle goes on.<br>  <br>  As such, the Queen / Boss needs to be strong and or ruthless in order for this to happen.<br>  <br>  Sash ...Ciao.|`|urs5cYf2aa	Power, Money, Respect.

When things are stressful or unsure in our lives it can cause nightmares.<br>  <br>  It also seems that your worries may be related to feeling like you have no control over circumstances (car accident) that could have huge implications (death).<br>  <br>  And maybe you are missing your bother a lot lately.

xif22nwoaa	It depends on what kind of psychologist.  I assume you mean the type that does therapy, which would be either a clinical or counseling psychologist.  <br>  <br>  For either, you would need to get an undergraduate degree in psychology and then at least a Master's degree in the specific area you want to practice (clinical or counseling).  However, most states require that you have a doctorate in order to be licensed; some states will give you a license after about 5 years of practice under the supervision of a doctoral-level psychologist (and assuming you pass the exam).  But other states will not ever grant you a license with just a Master's degree.  Without a license, you can't practice independently, although you can still work under the supervision of others.
B6CKyzngaa	YES!  Believe it or not, some people are TOXIC to you.  There are past relationships,old buttons they can push, ways in which our core families can bring us back to square one, or old loves, past friendships, etc., that can bring out the absolute WORST in us despite our being prepared for it and in spite of how much we have 'moved on'.  These are people you need to have limited contact with in life, they suck the best part of you right out of the picture and leave you wilted with disappointment, hurt, and drained from the expended energy.    In short, they make you "soul sick", and you become depressed or physically ill at some level every time you're around them.  That is a HUGE CLUE that you need to severely limit your contact with them by however means you can before they kill the very life out of you.|`|eAhkr1ruaa	Yes, I think it's possible.  Sometimes it's their actions that make you feel ill.  ?.blondy|`|6b24cf642defa808f4e13cc745076453aa	Yes.  They could feed me contaminated food.

Consider [but I warn be careful-- this is a loaded position but not less valid a supposition than some others as cause for physical illness]: --    Mortality rates among men are higher in the age range of the 70's and older than in women of the same age range.  The women go on to live as much as 20 years longer.      Just what is sickening and then mortalizing the men so relatively early on?    'My point?  Not only can a person make you ill, but can be outright poisonous to you; in effect can wipe you out.|`|WvfTOjRFaa	in love and hate situation, we can just fall ill by the sight or thought of that person. definitely yes, they affect us and it could be worst at times.|`|d76540548b78851b2b0db3441e66ae54aa	Yes, the more someone disturbs you, the more likely they are to create a visceral response in you.

g8JGLnk6aa	Hey! I LOVE the MBTI. I have studied the test so much that I can usually guess someone's type if I know them well-enough. So far I've accurately guessed most of my relatives' types and a few of my friends'. <br>  <br>  I am an INFP. My college roommate (and one of my best friends) is an INTP. I found the results to be very accurate. <br>  <br>  However I agree that you should never take the test TOO seriously. It should be seen as a guideline for understanding yourself and others. But you should never use a personality test to compartmentalize yourself or other people...because no one fits perfectly into a neat little box. Likewise, you should never use the results of any personality test to limit or justify any of your behavior. it should only be used as a guideline to facilitate further understanding and growth.<br>  <br>  That said, there is nothing wrong with being an Introvert! American society favors extraverts, but it's not always so elsewhere. I am experiencing that myself right now, during my study abroad in Denmark. Here, introversion is much more respected and people frown on overly loud, showy and talkative behavior. <br>  <br>  I don't know if you've heard of these sites I'm about to link, but I think you'll find them interesting nonetheless:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.intpcentral.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.intpcentral.com/</a> - Community for INTPs<br>  <a href="http://www.intpforum.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.intpforum.com/</a> - Another INTP forum<br>  <a href="http://www.theintrovertzcoach.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.theintrovertzcoach.com/</a> - Good resource site for Introverts

You have started writing; in fact you started long ago, in your own early years of life and of school.<br>  <br>  Now, all you have got to do, is to keep on writing, writing more and more carefully. You will write, and you will carefully diligently revise a couple of times that text or poem which you have written.

You might try and find and speak with somebody at a publishing house.<br>  <br>  Also, you might see if there in your own nearby is a good place where would-be writers meet and discuss their problems, and invite great authors, and perhaps also openly confess some of  their dreams.<br>  <br>  You might more daringly try and go ahead.
