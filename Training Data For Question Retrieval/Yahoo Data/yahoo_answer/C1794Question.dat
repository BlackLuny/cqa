It's not like my cat hisses at the tv screen or anything lol.  I watched a tv doc ages ago that said Nostradamus (yeah I know) had named Hussein as the main antichrist after Hitler (which he spelled wrong) and at the time they thought this was Saddam.  Hussein is Obamas middle name though, freaky or what!  He does fit the descriptions as well!!  Opinions, please.

20090130153830AAYitea	News & Events;Current Events	What is a Zionist wanna-be?	The person who used this term seemed to be writing about people who support Israel but do not live in Israel. I don't know.       I am a Christian, and I support Israel on the basis that it is officially recognized by my country (Canada). Canada voted at the U.N. in favour of a Jewish homeland in 1947 and gave full de jure recognition to Israel in 1949. We have a free trade agreement with Israel and do a lot of business together.      I also recognize the hand of God in the establishment of Israel and am absolutely certain that it is invincible.       http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada-Isra...       de jure: 'legally: by law; conforming to the law; by right; according to law; "de jure recognition of the new government"'   wordnet.princeton.edu/perl/webwn

20090130163000AAjE7oV	News & Events;Current Events	Is anyone more disgusted with Wall st. and charity orgs. than I am?	I have just listened to the NBC nightly news and I think I am so sick of the greedy SOB's, I will not trust big organizations again.      The idiots!!   We give them bailout money - they throw a million $ party to celebrate!  And they have given themselves boocoo money as bonuses, even tho their own businesses need more $ they .   Then there is the ridiculous purchase of another $50 mil. for a luxury jet.      Enough to make you sick?   Well, that is not all, folks.      Several of the very well known charity orgs. have mysteriously   '  lost  '  hundreds of millions of $.  It is 'unaccounted for.'   I am sure if we could look at all the top people in these  'humanitarian' charities, we would find the 'missing' money real fast in fat bank accounts.      I know it will not do any good to rant and rave and say how sickening these people are, but it makes me feel better to complain loudly about it.  Now is the time I wish I used profane language -  I would use every word I've ever heard to describe them.      Does anyone feel more anger than I do?

20070226144110AAwT5u6	News & Events;Media & Journalism	Do we traitors within?	It is very transparent that the bulk of the news media, whether it is newspapers, TV, radio, the entertainment community (Hollywood), or whatever...they all have the same agenda...and that is to constantly criticize the Executive branch of our government. It makes no difference if that branch is controlled by Democrats or Republicans. It is my opinion, that the media reads from the same script. What they write, depict in cartoons(sick), or vocalize, is wrong, dishonest, and un-American.          Contrary to the slanted and biased polls, the majority of the people in the United States are proud to be Americans. We live in a country where we can express ourselves without ending up on the other side of the lawn in more than one piece. I use the following term in a very complimentary manner: True Americans are “Red necks”. We love family, country, freedom, and are more than willing to defend ourselves, whatever it takes, against those Terrorist that want to murder us.

Someone said that the babies grandma actually WORKED at the      fertility clinic...Could this be the reason it was done ? I find it really strange that the mother and family DID NOT want to be known. This means she didn't want help from the public like everyone keeps talking about........
