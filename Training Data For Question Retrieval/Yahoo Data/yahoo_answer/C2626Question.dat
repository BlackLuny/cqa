20090129045831AAEi8xa	Cars & Transportation;Maintenance & Repairs	One wind shield wiper not working?	Hey all,      I'm having trouble with my right wind shield wiper.  On wednesday there was a good amount of snow on my car.  I cleared it all off, but apparently there was some stuck underneath my right windshield wiper that stopped it from going all the way down.      I realized this when I turned on my wipers while driving, to get rid of some light snow that was still falling.  The left windshield wiper got all tripped up in the right windshield wiper.  As the left wiper came up, the right one was already there, and it hooked under the base of it.  I couldn't use the wipers there.      I cleared this out when I got to work and tried them and they seemed to work.  On the way home that afternoon, I tested the wipers, and, to my surprise, the left one (on my side) that had gotten all caught up and manhandled, seemed to work fine, while the right one was having trouble.  It would go fine for a few swipes, especially after not having used them for a moment, and then would start only going about 2/3 of the way up, and then would drop down all the way to the position they usually take when they are completely turned off.      This morning, I made sure that they were all cleared out, but the right wiper wouldn't go at all.  When I got to work I tried pushing it up a little to see if maybe it had been frozen in the cold or something, and then tried them again.  It did one little half lift up, and then I couldn't get it to go again, so I just went into work.      Does anyone have any idea what this might be, is it anything I could possibly fix myself?  I just got the car out of the shop last week for an alternator and a couple little things, and I was hoping that I wouldn't have to deal with any of that stuff for a while.  Any idea what it will cost if I have to bring it in?      This sucks.  Thanks for any help you can give.

20090129062612AAwf7G1	Cars & Transportation;Insurance & Registration	I hit a pedestrian (in Georgia) with my car yesterday.  What should I do?	It was at 5 pm and I was leaving work.  He was standing in the median between a 4-lane road.  He was not standing on a sidewalk, in the grass or on a place designated for pedestrians -- he was standing in the middle of the median where cars are frequently turning, doing U-turns, etc.      I looked left and pulled into the median and did not see him.  My vision was blocked by the frame of my car.  I looked right to see if there were any cars oncoming once in the median, then accelerated to pull into the road.  As soon as I began accelerating, I hit him.  I wasn't going more than 10 mph; I hit him from behind, but he was looking at me.  His back landed on my hood and he fell forward when I stopped.      He was laying in one of the oncoming lanes, and I went over to ask him if he was okay.  The first thing I noticed was that he had headphones in his ears, because he didn't hear my question.  I asked again and said I was going to call 911 and he said "ok."      When the ambulance/police arrived, I sat in my car while they put him on a stretcher.  I asked one of the medics how he was, and he told me he was complaining of minor back pain but would be fine.  When the officer gave me my ticket (for failing to see him) he said the man would be fine.      Now I'm worried about the obvious -- he could claim post-accidental injuries.  Should I call my insurance company immediately?  Should I wait until he possibly files a claim?  I was told to get a copy of the police report immediately by a friend.  There was one witness, who told the police his name/number and left.  The witness came up to me when the ambulance arrived and said "make sure you tell the police his headphones were in when you hit him."      Any help would be greatly appreciated!

20090129063048AAdM3kd	Cars & Transportation;Safety	School crossing guard/traffic question?	I live near a busy (major) intersection in Florida that also has school crossing in the morning. I was making a left turn with the arrow still green and all of a sudden the traffic guard is walking into the middle of the street with a kid. I had to stop gradually in the middle of my turn as I was afraid the two cars behind me that were also turning were going to hit me from behind. I know that I must of scarred the guard and the kid (and myself), as it came very close. The problem from my side is that you can't see the guard (or anyone for that matter) until you've already started to cross just because of the dynamics of the intersection. Also, shouldn't the crossing guard be paying attention to the traffic light or can they just go into the road with moving traffic?

20090129071340AAG1Tua	Cars & Transportation;Maintenance & Repairs	??My honda civic car scraping plastic underneath car after drove over ice ?	The plastic cage like piece in the center front of the bottom of my car is broken/bent. This morning, to get out of my parking spot, I drove over a small pile of frozen snow. Hardened ice must have snapped it or bent it. When I drove away I could hear a scraping noise. I looked underneath my car to see what it was and saw the plastic piece bent downward which was scraping against the road to make the scraping noise.     Is this expensive to fix? Is it important to fix it ASAP or can I just bend it up so that it doesn't scrape anymore? Does it compromise the car having it like this? It's a Honda Civic 2005 or 2006 if that helps.

It was miss firing pretty bad along with a ticking sound that pretty much is a steady tick weather idle or moving. I changed the plugs and wires an d oil and filter. WA LA car runs great lots of power, but the ticking is still there. People tell me that some off these oil and fuel additives work wonders, so I put rislone in the oil today and a fuel additive as well. The valve lifter got louder. I have only driven about 5 to 7 miles since the additive. One person said its normal to get louder cause the additive thins out the oil. Is this the case if so how many miles should I drive it before changing the oil and filter again? Also if this is this case what kind of oil should I put in when I change oil again? If you think this is not the case please explain your thoughts. FYI a diagnostics computer did not show any codes regarding the lifters, in fact it showed nothing.      Thanks,   Josh

20090129070042AAZqlSN	Cars & Transportation;Insurance & Registration	Car accident question; who's at fault?	So this is what happened. The other night I was on my way home from work. It had been heavily snowing that day, and we were having an ice storm. The roads were very icy.      I get to a traffic light that is green, and I notice the car ahead of me slowing down so I started to slow down too. The next thing I know, they come to a complete stop and make a right turn without a signal. Out of panic, I hit my breaks because it was either that or rear end them.       My car started to slide and spin all over the road. I did end up back onto my side of the road, but the car behind me hit their breaks after I had hit mine and was sliding on the ice too. She ended up on my left side, where traffic should be coming in the opposite direction and hit my driver side.      We pulled over and exchanged info. There's a small dent the size of the palm of my hand in her car, and no damage to mine.      I honestly would've rather not gotten the insurance companies involved. But she did.      So legally, by the insurance companies I mean, who's fault do you think its going to come out as? I mean she was behind me, and she knew the roads were icy. I somehow managed to avoid any collision whatsoever, and she is the one who hit me.

Every time we kick it over, it sounds like it is trying to start but it just won't.  I have already replaced the spark plug, ignition coil, and the fuel line.  I also drained the gas and put in some fresh.  I also took apart the cylinder, head, and piston, and removed all the carbon and whatever else was in there.  Just recently while I was kicking it over, every five or so kicks, it would shoot a big, loud, high pitched blast of air out the muffler.  Any ideas as to what could be wrong?

20090129071758AACs5Cx	Cars & Transportation;Buying & Selling	Why is this car so cheap?	I have been in the market for a used car. I came across an individual the other day who has a 2005 Honda Odyssey for sale.  It is fully loaded and only has 22,000 miles on it.  From the pictures I have seen the car appears to be in pristine condition.  After doing some research I found that similar vehicles sell from between $16-20,000.  The gentleman who is selling the car is asking about a quarter of this price.  This seems almost too good to be true.  The seller is in the military and stationed over seas-he will be shipping the vehicle to me for free, and I have five days to drive the car after I receive it.  If I find something wrong, or that it is not as advertised, I can return the car.  Ebay will be holding the money until the transaction is complete, so he will not get the money until I authorize it.    Can anyone speculate as to why the car is being sold so far below its value?

20090129074329AAedL1Q	Cars & Transportation;Maintenance & Repairs	Why won't car start with new camshaft?	I recently installed a new camshaft, lifters, and timing chain on my 78 Camaro. I followed a Chilton guide step by step for the whole process. Piston  1 at top dead center (turned crank until both lifters, intake and exhaust, on  1 cylinder were down / recessed) and Camshaft gear timing mark at six o'clock position / crank gear timing mark at 12 o'clock position. Monday night I finished re-assembling the engine but could not get it to start. The motor turns over and backfires. I tried turning the distributor (advancing timing) to no avail, only backfiring. What do I need to do?    The car is a 78 Camaro, 5.7L V8 SBC, Holley 650 cfm carb, Headers, edelbrock intake, etc. The newly installed cam is COMP with .470 lift.

I was desperate, but it ran great and I became fond of it... however, it's RPM was 1500 at an idle, and for smog it had to be at 1000.      I went to a certified local mechanic and he reset the timing to factory, but 45 min later he called my cell to tell me I'd lost all my acceleration!      He wanted more money to "find out why" and since he didn't know what was wrong, I decided to just putt-putt her home. I'd like some advice from a few car lovers and gear-heads before I go back or take it elsewhere. What's wrong with my Honda?!

20081022204118AADTNOz	Cars & Transportation;Maintenance & Repairs	What is wrong with my Car?	So I recently Replaced the battery in my 03 Impala, so I know its not the battery causing this problem. The problem I am having is I went to go start it today and when I put the key in the ignition and turn the key to start it... nothing. No cranking, no sounds, nothing at all happens. The battery works fine the lights work, windows work, radio works, I don't have a check battery light coming on. The other thing is usually about 10-20 minutes later after waiting the car will eventually start. And sometimes when I start the car it seems to have trouble. My theory is the starter is probably going, but with my budget I don't want to spend the 200 bucks on a starter and find out that wasn't the problem.  Could it be anything else or am I correct and its the starter?
