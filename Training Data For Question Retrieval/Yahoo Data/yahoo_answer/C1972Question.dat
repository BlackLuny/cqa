I have the nintendo wii system, and I am currently (right now it is literally running on my TV) playing Super Mario Galaxy (for wii). I have the nunchuck & the wii remote plugged in. I seem to be playing the game quite alright, but I need some help now.       I have traveled to the terrace (looking out onto all the planets) I chose this planet called the Magic Dino Egg or something like that. I have beaten the first star in the galaxy, but now am on the second one. The 2nd star is right infront of me and Mario is standing on a giant orange star. Little blue stars are on each sector of the larger orange star. The star I want is in the middle of the large orange star I am standing on. How do I get to it? I have tried pressing A on the blue stars like it told me in the instructions, but I can't seem to get off the planet or get a hold of the star in the middle.      I know this might be a little confusing, but any help would be appreciated.

However, I've owned it for almost two years and it has ALOT of wear and tear on it (because I traveled ALOT, dropped it alot, etc..). So when my contract expires, I'm going to take my $50 credit and get me another Verizon G'z cellphone (and another contract)! Unfortunately, they stopped making my favorite phone (in my favorite color and look) and released two new phones in the Verizon G'z series about a year or so ago, the Verizon G'z Boulder and some other one (pictured below).       http://images.intomobile.com/wp-content/...       I really don't like the new look of the phones (but I do like the features)!      Anyway, my question is:      When will the next new Verizon G'z cellphone come out? And if possible, can you describe what it'll look like and post a link to the picture?

20090222174435AAfMoTx	Consumer Electronics;Camcorders	I think the heads of my dv cam are clogged, can the footage be salvaged?	I have a dv cam with what I suspect are clogged heads (because when I tape footage and play it back it plays with horizontal bands. You can see new footage with bands of old footage behind it).  If I clean the heads, or put the tape in a different camera, do you think the footage will playback without the horizontal lines or is the footage permanently damaged. Also, could the tape also be the problem? Or do the horizontal lines sound strictly like a clogged head problem?

I'm 18 years old high school senior, getting ready to go to college this fall. I've had a job for about 6 months, and I finally decided to break for a new phone. I had a Blackberry Pearl 8100, which was nice, but it's worthless now. I also had a LG Shine, which has just been a disaster. I like both the HTC Fuze and Samsung Epix, majorly because of the touch screens and wi-fi. I'd take either one, but I need some input from people who own these phones. I don't want to put down big bucks for a phone and then get stuck with another big data plan each month, which is why I refused to go for the $30 a month Blackberry data plan. If I just want wi-fi, and unlimited texting/MMS, will I need a data plan for either phone? Also give me some input for each phone. Thanks in advance.

So, I just recently bought rockband for my ps2 and pointing out the obvious, there's the guitar, the drums and the mic. There's only 2 usb ports in the system. What do I need to get for the third equipment if two of the ports are already occupied. *sigh* I feel so dumb. All I know is that a multitap is for controllers. So where do I get another usb port? (Or whatever you call it, I ain't tech savvy. Ha!) I'd appreciate the help! Thanks. =)
