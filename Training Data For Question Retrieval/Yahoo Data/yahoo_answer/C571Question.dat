I definitly think that i should get checked out by the doctor tomorrow but i tend to over react about everything so i wanna make sure this isnt alright. Are testicles supposed to be perfectly egg shaped?,cause i notice these bumps at the bottom of each ball in the same place which makes me think it might be normal. Also if its not normally, is the only possibility cancer or could it be something less severe? Thanks
20090309232620AAeQ8UV	Health;Mental Health	I think i have cognitive impairment? anyone else like this?	when i was in 4th grade i got the highest on an iq test or some standardized test. i got higher than some girl who went to stuyvesant high school. of course i know these things arent always accurate. anyway, i was a very god student and when i entered high school my fear of rejection made me depressed and my grades werent terrible but nothing great. for some reason,   i have a short attention span,    i procrastinate because i fear doing hard work (im a soph in college)    i forget easily.      i am also impulsive and i dont mean i am promiscuous or waste money. i just blurt answers out without thinking.    sometimes people are sharing stories and ill share something that is slightly related to what people are talking about.    for the past few years i have had a hard time comprehending things easily. sometimes i can. i try not to over think things also.      i have great linguistic abilities, but on tests sometimes i get overwhelmed and i just make no sense on tests.      im terrible in math.   i need people to repeat things to me over and over.       i like to philosophize and think about free will selflessness. im in touch with my feelings and i think i am somewhat wise. i feel so stupid. ive also been called stupid by my family and i think this is because i am the youngest. my dad is negative and my mom has a lot of anxiety over stupid things. ive learned a lot about my self, but i think i am slow or something. i dont know why all of this has taken so long for me to figure out, but it has.

I was wondering if anyone can tell me an estimate of how much an eye operation would cost without a really good health care plan?   I think the surgery has something to do with the cornea, maybe not, but i've heard that those cost around $50,000.   A health care plan is active with kaiser permanente, but we get a pretty decent salary in my household, so we don't have a great plan covering us.   Also, i heard that health surgeries are just a tad bit cheaper than beauty surgeries, because it's not for any sort of cosmetic surgery, it's an attempt to regain eyes sight, does anyone know around how much that would cost?

20090309233735AAWWeLS	Health;Mental Health	Should I talk to my doctor about switching to Xanax for my anxiety?	Last September, my doctor switched me from Effexor XR to Lexapro, and since then, my anxiety and stress levels have doubled and has gotten worse.     I panic a great deal and get really worked up, especially about the economy.  I have a seasonal job at Six Flags and I keep worrying that I'm going to get laid off or get fired for some stupid reason.  I've been a great employee there for almost four years now.  My bosses really like me, and I even got promoted, but for some reason I just fear I'll get canned for some stupid *** reason, and that I'll end up working at McDonalds or being on the street for the rest of my life.  I got my bachelors last May and finding a full time job in graphic design has been difficult cause of the economy, so I still live with my parents like a douchbag saving up money.  My parents offer to help me out and I get embarrassed and feel guilty about it.  I know I have a good resume since I've gotten interviews and phone calls before.      I also stopped having sex with my boyfriend cause I get extremely paranoid about getting pregnant.  We both use protection!  I'm on the birth control and I always remember to take it everyday as instructed, and never missed a pill before.  I'm not on any antibiotics nor anticonvulsants, which could hinder the pill's effectiveness.  He also uses a condom properly each time.  Yet, I still get freaked out that I will be that 1 out of 100 who still gets knocked up.  I still got my period, and I've taken several home pregnancy tests in a row and thank god they were all negative!  I'm gonna take another one within the next week just to be sure and I hope that it will also be negative.  If I had the extra money, I would get my tubes tied and have my boyfriend get a vasectomy because I NEVER EVER WANT TO HAVE KIDS AND WILL NEVER BE A GOOD MOTHER!!!      Seriously, I have been extremely tense and worried about these situations.  Taking deep breaths doesn't always help, so is going on Xanax a good call, or would I become too dependent on it?  Also, will it show up on a drug test?  IDK, maybe I just need to stop watching the news so much.

Years ago I  noticed that my friends kid was constantly moving his index fingers, I at first thought it was involuntary movement then I asked him about the swirling and he said that he sees/thinks about things, and then acts as if he's tracing them.       Yesterday I saw this same kid, well hardly a kid anymore, he's a freshman in college... and he was doing it without even knowing. He is a very bright kid but has several other out of the norm behaviors, like when he walks he holds his thumbs in, and I've seen this in children with downs syndrome.       He also says that he can not distinguish hot/cold at times with his fingertips so will feel the object (i.e. food, coffee cup etc.) then touch his face with his finger.

I also am very sick but my symptoms all seem flu related rather than strep throat related. My symptoms are:   Sever chills (so bad that 3 sweaters, 2 pairs of pants and 4 blankets wasn't enough to warm me up).   Fever...I had a fever come and go for the last 2 days.   HORRIBLE body aches and headache for 2 days straight (it was so bad I couldn't sleep)   A slight sore throat that comes and goes when I swallow. It's not that sore...but whenever it isn't sore it feels like something is in there...like a small swelling or something. It makes me cough because it's annoying.   Extreme tiredness...and dizzyness and weakness that has lasted 2 days now..but is starting to get better.   Extreme runny nose (yeah..enough said about that one)   No appetite at all..and at times I feel a bit like vommitting but haven't.      So I don't know if I should worry about strep. My roommate has it...thats why i think i might have it. I can't go see the doctor's until march 11.   What do you guys think?

20090225091553AAhvX0l	Health;Mental Health	My husband who has bi-polar, has been angry for days....don't know why and will not talk...call the doc?	He has just suffered the opening of a wound - distance from mother for over 7 years, she called to talk to him, the talks were ok, normal, simple. She's called me a couple of times to ask if he's ok, she's also called to say she is contemplating backing off because of the distance for so many years, however, his void seems to be the approval of his mother. I'm not getting in the mix, have told my husband she's called me, he's been honest about his talks, but as a recovering alcoholic he fell off the wagon Saturday night and asked for space to work this issue out (the mother thing and his self-absorbing destructive behavior) He's fine with everyone else in the house, talking like nothing is wrong, but is refusing to talk to me. I've written him notes that if and when he wants to talk I'm here......and given him the space he requested (it's normal for him to do this from past depressive experiences) but I'm concerned he should seek professional help that I can't force upon him. Is it time to get the professionals involved? Or wait out the wave of emotion until it either blows up or he comes out of his shell. Anyone with Bi-Polar disorder who can shed some light on this would be greatly appreciated. I don't know what you go through, but advice is always appreciated to get a clearer understanding.  Thanks in advance for your input.

He doesn't have any health insurance. He was discharged from the army after being in it for 3 weeks, but he spent the whole time in the hospital so he is not considered an army veteran. He is on  two types of medicine, one for his heart and zoloft for depression. The zoloft and everything he went through in his army experience have made him start to forget things, I guess you can say he's dealing with short-term memory loss. Everyday that comes, he can't remember what happened the day before. His heart rate has been realllyyyy high and his blood pressure is really low. I don't know if that's because of the medicine...but either way, he needs some sort of immediate health care, he's giving up hope and having suicidal thoughts. He NEEDS to see a doctor ASAP and be able to afford it. He does not have a lot of money and there is no one who can lend it to him. Please tell me some of the options.

Its tiring, VERY tiring not being able to enjoy all the luxuries i have because i keep on thinking of others, what they have and what I dont have. I mean, OK, this year we did a full renovation of the house, adding a pool, new floors, changing the whole garden landscape. And when we DO go abroad, once a year, we do stay at pricey hotels like the Hilton, or the Ritz in London, Paris, Spain, Athens and all that. Its not like I dont have what I ask for, its just that i cant enjoy it coz i think of what every1 else has. How can i block out all these feeings of envy, and be GRATEFUl and LOVE all that I have, which is so much more that i need? Thanks everyone---No cruel comments.:p

It is now Wednesday and the abcess still hurts and is still developing a decent amount of pus even after I have totally drained it. The swelling seems to have gone down at least a little and I cant seem to find any red lines running out of the infection anywhere...

Then the morning of 2.22 I woke up to light pink spotting on the tp. Throughout the day it got a little heavier, it went from light pink to brownish red to red then back to just spotting.I had sex that night & I started bleeding lightly for 5 min then nothing. The next morning there was nothing on my underwear then when i went pee there was light pink again. Today it seems like the pinkish, brownish red. is gone and i'm only having brown CM so far and maybe a dot of pink. What could this be?

I'm not sure if he likes me, but I've caught him looking at me a few times, and once when we were smiling, we made eye contact. We never talked much, but before he found out how old I was, he would always say hi to me. Now he sort of ignores me. I have noticed that he stands next to me a lot, though. I'm very shy, so I'm too scared to ask him or even talk to him about anything really, for that matter. Today, I noticed that when he stood next to me, he stood the same way I did and he's done this before. I read somewhere that this is a sign he like you . Recently, however, I heard him talking about not wanting to date girls (yet) and not wanting to go out with older girls either.  I'm not interested in going out with him, I just want to know does he like me?

I did the usual (4 ibuprophen, 1 benedryl, 2 tylenol and a long hot bath, after the bath cold compresses and then a nice long nap). That usually takes care of the headache. Not this time. In fact, this headache is slowly getting worse. On a scale of 1 to 10 its a 7 right now. I took some migraine prescription meds in the middle of the night (Frova) and have taken the maximum allowed in 24 hours. I have no health insurance. What should I do?

Funny thing is whenever I have been away on hols or for the weekend, it goes, i still eat the same foods when I am away as at home.

Fortunately I do not suffer with diarehea.  I know a lot of people suffer with ibs, but how many have got the same symptoms as me.

I've been too depressed for too long, & I've been abused too many times, & the police wants ME arrested. I got my college degree, & I'm too successful for my life to be thrown away, & people expect me to live off og SSI & Social Security all my life. I have a degree & deserve a high salary. My family even hates me. No one cares about me. Me getting arrested or mentally hospitalized for being the victim of my roommate charging @ me with 2 knives, & they want to arrest me & not her? They're supposed to protect & to serve. I should commit suicide. It's pointless for me to live. People treat me like I don't have a right to eat, sleep, & breathe. People always are threatening to hurt or kill me. Or I may as well hurt someone & let all my anger out because somewhere in my life, I'll be going to jail anyway. My future is in the garbage. I got a college degree I can't even put to use.

Ever since August, I have gotten sicker and sicker: Now I am homeschooled which means I usually get atleast 8 hrs of sleep & drink plenty of water, but every day I end up feeling very tired, dizzy, and feverish. I also get headaches 5-6 days out of 7 every week, and most of the time they develop into migraines, which make me very nauseous. I end up taking medicine to relieve the symptoms, usually it gets a little better, but everything starts over the next day.      My mother has hyperthyroidism (along with her mom, & her only brother and sister), and she believes I have it too. I also have a very bad bone density even tho I consume plenty of calcium (she said hyperthyroidism may be the cause of that).      Hopefully I am going to the doctor soon, but meanwhile, does anybody have any suggestions as to what I can do to feel better? Can any foods do this to you? Thanks!

My hair has been short to very long ,length has nothing to do with it, it continues no matter what the length. If anyone has an answer to this very annoying night time activity, please respond!

20070210111604AA1EWqj	Health;Diet & Fitness	People are so ignorant...do you even know what anorexia is?	anorexia is a mental disorder-not a choice. for everyone who says they are "lazy, sick, disgusting, stupid" and all the other ignorant **** i've heard maybe you should understand what it is. It is not a choice, people do not just wake up one day and say "i think i'll starve myself to the point where i cant walk since i've stripped the padding from my feet and i'm just bone" its not something controllable, because if it was people wouldn't need therapy to recover. And lazy? once again this goes back to the whole "diet" thing. it is not at a diet at all; most of the time people do not even start out overweight, most of the time they are of normal weight. its not a diet at all.      Second-for girls who think its a diet and an easy way to loose weight and ask for tips? your ignorant. If your overweight; loose weight the healthy way; don't "Become" anorexic. because you cannot "become anorexic" by picking up bad habbits. its starts out as something mental; not a fad diet.

20070320073758AATHGdg	Health;Women's Health	Does my friend have bulimia?	I have a friend that just told me that she throws up the food that she eats, but only in periods. She told me she started doing it when she was 14, (that's now over 10 years ago) as she had a complicated upbringing and wanted to let her feelings out somehow. She has also had a complicated relationship with her weight her whole life. Now she only throws up the food she eats when she is in stressfull situations or when she feels over weight. The problem is that she doesn't think she has bulimia. She says that if she had bulimia, she would throw up every day, over a very long period of time. She defends herself by saying that she can go months without throwing up at all. Still, she goes into very heavy bulimic peroids - it can be a week or a month where she keeps alot to herself and told me she throws up up to several times a day. Does my friend have bulimia? Should she get help or is it not nessecary as it only is going in periods?

20090227104752AAEDrZ1	Health;Other - Health	How long should I wait to see if it clears up before going to the doc?	Okay I have IBS. On Wednesday that evening I had a little bit of bright red in the toliet bowel and on the toliet paper after a Bowel movement (That was probably the 6th BM I had that day)      Yesterday it happened again twice. Not my first BM but my 2nd.      I then called the doc and set up an appointment for today. Well I had 2 more BMS yesterday and no blood.      This morning I got up and there was no blood. So I cancelled the appointment thinking I was fine.      The second BM I had today had a little bright red blood with it (But not as much as yesterday)      I mean I feel fine. I don't feel sick or anything. I have a little stomach pain (same area I get the IBS pain) its not as severe as normal.         When should I start to worry? If it isn't better in the morning should I go on down to the doctor?      ------------------------------------      My mother who is a nurse doesn't seem to concerned and she said it should clear up on its own......      She said bright red isn't too much of a concern but dark red to black is         She has IBS as well and she also has Crohns      My mom thinks it was just a tear because I have the IBS and I had so many BMS that first day (after a few days of constipation)            What stresses me out the most is I know I can't afford to go to a specialist or anything and make rent.      So that has got my tummy in an uproar.      This is all new and scary for me....I'm 22.      I had it similar a few times when I was a teen before I was diagnosed
20080708133057AAIdBFW	Health;Diet & Fitness	Is this a healthy way of dieting?	I'm 19, I stand at 5"7' and I weight 140. I'm thin but not skinny. I've been cutting my calorie intake immensely. Instead of snacking in between meals, I cut out the snacks and substitute junk food in my meals for fruits or veggies. For breakfast I usually have shredded wheat cereal with tons of fiber. For lunch I have wheat bread with colby cheese, turkey, and light mayo. For dinner I usually have rice and chicken, no dressing's added. I sometimes mix it up. Like for dinner I'll just have carrots and grapes. Sometimes I skip a meal, and that's only when I'm actually not hungry.       Before I go to bed every night I do 100 crunches, 50 leg lifts on each leg, 90 degree arm rotations, all of my stretches, and 50 ab slides.   People already tell me they see results in my mid section, which is where I am trying to get more fit. I am going on vacation in 2 and a half weeks and I've been working out for about 7 days, and I've lost about 4 pounds.      Is this a healthy way to diet?
20090227092413AAOeblO	Health;Women's Health	Did you have prenatal depression?  If so, what did you do?	I haven't been diagnosed with depression, but I'm sure that's what is going on.  I am 41 weeks, 1 day pregnant and for the past month or so, I've been so moody, so irritable.  All along, I've said I want a natural, drug-free labor and delivery, but my body is showing no signs of upcoming labor - the baby hasn't even dropped yet!  I am really, really uncomfortable and just want this baby to come out, by whatever means.  Honestly, sometimes I think I am starting to resent the baby for making me so miserable.  I've always thought I'd be a good mother; even all throughout this pregnancy (up until lately), I was so excited and ready to meet my little one, and be a good mother.  I tried to talk to my husband about it, but he didn't get it.  He was just like, "Think happy thoughts; imagine how wonderful it will be to hold the baby.  You'll be okay; it's mind over matter."  I've tried not to feel so bad.  I've tried to imagine what it'll be like to have my baby.  But really, I just can't!  I feel like I'm never even going to have this baby, and I'll be stuck in this pregnant misery forever!  I don't really have anyone to talk to who would understand!  What can I do?  I don't want to take medication...

20090109204018AAubaGT	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Other - Diseases	If I smoke, will it effect...?	OK So I'm 15 years old. I been feeling really lousy for the last 2 or 3 months, always tired, occasional sore throat, constant very bad headaches, body aches, a slight to moderate fever on some days. Just not right at all. I'm pretty sure I have mono, I've had it before I think I have it again.   Anyways, I've been smoking on and off for a year (mostly off, maybe a total of 100 cigarettes through all of 2009/2009). I'm trying to quit and I haven't had one in 4 days. But right now, I'm so sore and in so much pain and so tired, I just want one. My body is CRAVING it. I've eaten lots of food in the house to stop my craving, but I need to have one.   So I decided I will have a cigarette, just one, tonight.   Because I think I have mono, or something that's obviously pretty serious, I was wondering, if I smoke a cigarette tonight, and I go to the doctor tomorrow morning or afternoon, will that effect my blood test results(if they think you have mono, you need a blood test)? Will there still be a level of nicotine in my body that is traceable?   How long until nicotine wears off in your blood? I don't want to get caught smoking and I haven't been caught yet, I'm trying to quit, matters are in my own hands.   Just answer the question, will they be able to find nicotine in my bloodstream tomorrow if I smoke tonight?   I don't want to mess up my blood test results.         Thanks.

20080301125220AA1Ggr7	Health;Other - Health	Informe de la BBC: Distrofia muscular: avance médico?	Investigadores dicen haber dado el paso más significativo de los últimos 15 a?os en la comprensión de la fatal enfermedad neuromotora (MDN, por sus siglas en inglés), conocida también como distrofia muscular.        El descubrimiento es nueva herramienta biológica para comprender la enfermedad.       Un equipo asegura que una mutación de un gen está detrás de una forma de la enfermedad, y que ese descubrimiento puede ser utilizado para comprender mejor este mal.       Defensores afirman que el estudio, publicado en la Revista Science, es el más importante desde que un primer gen fue identificado en 1993.       La MND implica la pérdida progresiva de los músculos, mientras que en términos generales, la mente no resulta afectada.       En el Reino Unido, al menos 5.000 personas sufren la enfermedad. Cinco mueren diariamente por esa causa.       Herramienta biológica       El equipo internacional, liderado por King's Collage de Londres, encontró que en una familia afectada por una rara forma hereditaria de la enfermedad, hubo mutaciones en el gen codificado de la proteína TDP-43.         Esta nueva información será un trampolín hacia una mayor comprensión del proceso que causa la enfermedad que provoca la muerte de las neuronas motoras       Brian Dickie   MDN Association       Desde hace tiempo se sabe que la proteína se acumula de manera anormal en los pacientes con MND, pero se pensaba que esa era una consecuencia inocente de la enfermedad.       El profesor Chris Shaw, director de la investigación, dice que ahora está claro que esta proteína es "directamente tóxica" de las neuronas motoras.       Mientras que la forma hereditaria del mal que causa esta mutación es extremadamente rara, con tan solo el 1% de los casos de MDN, los investigadores podrán utilizar sus descubrimientos provocando la enfermedad en animales y estudiando su evolución.       "Esta es una nueva herramienta biológica para comprender la enfermedad y desarrollar tratamientos", dijo Shaw.       Rompecabezas       La primera parte del rompecabezas fue descubierta en 1993, cuando investigadores encontraron la mutación del gen SOD1, responsable de una forma de la MND.       Los expertos dicen que este hallazgo mejoró su comprensión, aunque todavía debe impactar significativamente en materia de tratamiento.       Pero la MND Association dice que este último hallazgo podría acelerar ese proceso.       "Esta nueva información será un trampolín hacia una mayor comprensión del proceso que causa la enfermedad que provoca la muerte de las neuronas motoras", dijo el doctor Brian Dickie, director de investigación.       "Es a través de esta clase de comprensión que desarrollaremos las estrategias de tratamiento para derrotar esta devastadora enfermedad".        http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/spanish/science... 
20090227110459AAfrphS	Health;Other - Health	Shaken baby syndrome, information inside.?	We got a 6 week old baby who had been in the hospital for shaken baby syndrome. (we are foster parents) and the baby's shaken baby syndrome is chronic and acute. Which means the baby has been shaken before and this time the baby had to go to the hospital because she was having seziures. But she is at home with us now and she seems perfectly fine, and the only thing they said might be wrong is her eye sight. but she follows my hand and figures with her eyes and she will stare at things and her pupils dialate and everything just fine. I think she is acually excelling because she is already pushing herself up and holding her head up a lot and acually crawls up my chest.       She acually smiles, not gas, I'm serious. We will be talking to her and she'll grin and then when we do that same thing an hour or even a day later she'll smile to that same thing so I'm pretty sure it's smiling, because also when she has gas it's usually loud, not silent and she usually grunts.       She seems to acually be up to almost 3 months in what she is doing. She just needs to build a little more muscle but she is already doing everything a 3 month old does pretty much.       So if her shaken baby syndrome is chronic and acute, I thought shaken baby syndrome ment they were veggies at the worst or were delayed? She acually mimmicked me one day. Yes, cause when i said it again she said it.       She seems to be growing and learning at lighting speed, more than a normal child.    I know that sometimes when people hit their head they get special powers or abilities like one guy he was hit in the head he could remember the weather every single day from that day. But ofcourse that's someone who has had their head hit, not shaken. So could this baby's brian could of healed perfectly and won't have any problems? I know we can't really tell till she starts talking, crawling and doing more things, but right now she seems to be excelling in a lot of things.

I am 18 and 5'2" I want to weigh 95 lb (this is healthy for my age and height)   I got down from 130 lb to 102 lb eating very little daily for a long time. sometimes nothing, sometimes 500 calories. and jogging on the spot for like an hour a day.       I got so depressed I started binging and purging; eating so much that I couldn't move. My mind was totally preoccupied with thoughts about food. I couldn't just eat a piece of bread... I had to eat the loaf.      Now i have gained a little weight - am currently 108 lb   I am not unhappy at that weight, but I still want to get to 95 lb   except I learned my lesson and now i want to do it healthily.   I think my metabolism is probably damaged - I should have to eat 1400 calories to maintain my weight, but apparently if you starve yourself it drops by as much as 40% so I think i only need 1000 calories to maintain my current weight.      How do i lose weight in a healthy way? If I ate 800 calories a day and jogged for half an hour, would this be sensible?    I know its not recommended to go below 1200 calories daily, but thats for the average person - and theres  big difference between a tall large man and a small girl.      advice?

My husband and I are planning on getting pregnant, but we want to wait until summer (four or five months). I want to go off the pill soon so our chances are better when we are ready, but for now I don't want to get pregnant. We are going to start using condoms when we quit the pill(I have been on it for about 16 months), so will we have to use them all the time? Will a basal thermometer chart work for me since I have been on the pill? Help!

I've been prescribed to Xanax and I take it on an "as needed" basis. I had 0.25mg around 11am yesterday, but none since (so it's been 24hrs). I'm only worried because last time that I tried this I had a panic attack after I started drinking because I was worried that the Xanax might still somehow be in my system...   Also: I don't plan on getting smashed, just planning of drinking a few (likely two) glasses of wine. I also am prescribed to Zoloft, but I have had drinks on that before and no subsequent problems.    I'm also 121lbs, and a vegetarian (and I plan on eating a rounded meal before these drinks). Am I safe? I know I may seem paranoid about this, but I do have panic disorder, you know?!

I decided to go off of the pill to give my body a break of all the hormones and because I wasn't sexually active.  I've been off the pill now for 9 months.  The first month I was off of it I got my period when I was supposed to no problem,  Then I went 3 months without a period and finally got it.  then I went another couple of months with out getting it.  The last time I got my period was in December.  It is now the end of February and I still haven't gotten it.  I know for a fact I am not pregnant because I went and got a pregnancy blood test just last week and I haven't been sexually active in over a month and a half.  Where is my period?  I'm 24 years old.  I've gone to my GYN for all my yearly appointments and everything, and just went right after my last period.  So I would think she would say something if she noticed when she was doing the scraping and exam down there if anything was wrong.  I just want to know whats wrong with me and where my period is, or if this is normal?   Thanks Guys!

I am over 8 months pregnant and I found out yesterday that my boyfriend and the father of my child has been cheating on me. We've been having sex without condoms because I am pregnant and in a committed relationship so we didn't see the need. I have found out that he hasn't been using condoms and has had sex with at least two other girls. I found a video so I am sure of everything. My problem is that I have been tested for HIV and STDs and come up clean. But, when confronted he admitted that he had sex this past weekend with a complete stranger, unprotected. I'm worried that I may have contracted something. I know with HIV I can't test with secure results for 3 months. Am I putting my baby at risk with breast feeding? I can't stop worrying. I am going to ask my doctor on Monday but I am freaking out. I don't know what to do. Any advice would be amazing.      PS. We've broken up. So no worries there!

My problem is I can't cough up the mucus and its really clogging my throat. I've been like this for over 2 weeks, and now have a incredibly poor appetite as well. I have tried both Robitussin and Mucinex. Robitussin seems to suppress the clogging and clear out some of the phlegm but its quite temporary. I have seen 2 doctors about this and neither helped, the first told me to get mucinex(which doesn't work at all) and the second one gave me nasal spray and an appetite enhancer. The nasal spray helps a little.Also I don't smoke or drink if that helps. I really wish I could just get the PHLEGM/MUCUS to surface and cough it up. Most of time I feel much better after that.

The reason i kept my virginity was because i was waiting for the right guy, ive had many guys make their attempts but i always said no.Most girls before loosing their virginity have been fingered, but ive never have.      I lost my virginity, without even planning it. it just happen, i was crying while he was putting in. In my head, i was like "what am i doing?!" I wasnt excited so my vagina wasnt wet and it hurts like hell when he was putting in. He forcely put his penis into my vagina, i yelled to the top of my lungs. after he kept putting in and out which even hurts more. I didnt bleed whatsoever. when i got home i was in denial, i couldnt believe i wasnt a virgin anymore, i took a shower and put my fingers up my vagina to see if i really wasnt a virgin, when i did it hurt once again, i checkd my fingers and i had blood.      im confused. i dont know how to handle this situation.   he didnt use a condom. i wasnt on the pill. my period is coming soon. i dont know if i bleed or not, because when i heard that girls bleed i thought it was big enough that it can get to the sheets like having your period.      somebody help me!

Is it still the workout commandment to workout till exhaustion and then to take off a day and rebuild.  I have been working out for 4 and a half months, and I am seeing some results, but not the results that I expected thus far.  Any and all feedback will be much appreciated.  I am 43+ years and I know that  will not build as quick as if I were 20, but I just want to make sure that i am not doing anything to defeat my purposes.  I don't want to be huge, but I do want definite defining muscles!!!!

I was emotionally upset, but then they started beating me with Cafetria trays and all the faculty did was laugh. No one likes me. My only friend is my Squirtle on Pokemon in my Gameboy. And he doesn't listen to me because I have yet to receive the Thunder Badge. Man.. I really need some friends to talk to. Help? What should I do? My parents spit on my supper before I eat it. Help me

20090225101112AAGhoZU	Health;Diet & Fitness	All kinds of stomach problems, multiple doctors visits/tests no diagnosis. Help?	I am 16 male, had all these tests done on digestions, camera looking in my stomach xrays mri's etc. I have anxiety and servere depression so I think that my problems are connected with my mental problems. But regardless if there connected or not I still have these stomach problems that make my life more miserable then it already is with my mental problems and they must be diagnosed so i can have my doctor prescribe me something, change my diet or whatever. Here are my symptoms:      1. Occasional random diarrhea (it can happen once a week, once a month. twice a week, whenever its random but painful I will be on the toilet for an hour sweating and rubbing my lower stomach right at my waistline)   2. Constipation -- I have had it all my life, I can only have a normal bowel movement once a week, sometimes more, sometimes less, this is also random and never can pinpoint when ill have a bowel movement. Laxitives don't work. Fiber increase in diet doesn't work. Nothing will give me a normal daily bowel movement.   3. Every acid reflux that is somewhat controled by a prescription ant acid like prevacid or zegerid. It is worse when I first wake up and I can not eat for hours until the ant acid takes in then i am starving. This is a daily everyday thing.    4. Lately I have had blood in my stool, I have lost my apetite having hunger cravings at random times like before I go to sleep. Its hard for me to eat normal meals I used to enjoy like a sandwich for lunch it just doesnt taste good and if I force myself ot eat it I feel sick.    5. I randomly get stomach cramps that range from the waisteline through pain that happens at the bottom of my ribcage. The ribcage pain feels like somebody is pushing the bottom of my lungs upward torwards my head.    6. Also I get gas along with these cramps.       So based on these symptoms give me your opinion on what I may have since the doctors are doing nothing but giving me medication with no diagnosis, Please dont tell me to go to another doctor ive been to over 20 just give me your opinion, suggestions etc. anything would be appreciated.

20090225093957AAqZwxe	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Heart Diseases	Could I be having a heart attack?	I have mid-left back pain.  Can't figure out if it's muscle related or what, but when I breathe I feel the pain more.  It's not intensifying, but it's odd that it's only in that one spot.  It' s too high to be kidney.  I have been doing research on the internet about mid-left back pain and that is one of the symptoms, but I don't have any other symptoms accept mild indigestion and it's not hard to breathe, but my chest feels kind of tight which happens when my back needs popped.  I know for a woman the symptoms of a heart attack can occur months to even weeks in advance.  I would like to hear some experiences or even a little advice.  I guess my worst fear is that I'll go into the doctor for something stupid and make it a big deal for nothing.     I'm a healthy 32 year old woman and I've never had any medical problems, so this is kind of new to me.  Any help or advice is much appreciated.  If you have a medical background that would be a great insight as well. Thanks!

20090225095650AA3BfLM	Health;General Health Care;Pain & Pain Management	Is it bad to walk on a knee with tendinitis?	I injured my knee four days ago playing indoor soccer. I went to the ER and got X-Rays. The X-Rays were negative and I was told that I had a knee sprain. I have been doing RICE and taking some painkiller medicine. Yesterday I saw a doctor who said I did not tear anything and that I just had tendinitis. I started walking yesterday afternoon with a profound limp, but is this bad for me? Also my range of motion in my knee is very limited. I can only bend it to approximately 45 degrees. Is this normal for someone with tendinitis? Also how long till I get full range of motion back?

He lvies in a flat with his smoking Dad but I don't think these factors bear any impact. Sometimes he wakes up with really severe cramp in his right leg and ends up punching and kicking the bed in agony, and his knee aches for long spells on a regular basis. He was kicked just below the kneecap about 10 years ago by a horse, what could be causing the problem now? Doctors have said there's nothing they can do.

His symptoms include runny nose, cough, fever, greenish brown snot. we notice that now his face is swelling near the eyes so now he can not open them. also he can barely walk anymore. we take him in and the doc just looks at his nose and ears and says he just has a virus and told us to wait it out. we go home and his temp is now at 104.5. the doc never checked this mind you. we then go to the ER where they start treating him for cellulitus, and they also prescribed him meds. what you you do in this situation. im pretty sure im about to call a lawyer.
