You have the right frame of thought when you put "I would associate myself with whatever political party would aide me best in my quest to be the president."  But in order to do that you'd have to sellout your ideas for that party's or lobbyist's.  There's other ways to change the world for the better than to be president.  All you have to do is stick up for what you believe in and never give up trying to get your message out.<br>  <br>  *if only it were that easy, and the ends don't always justify the means.  If you have to tell the people in control and the people what they want to hear at the same time, but actually have no intention of fulfilling your promises then what would make you any different than every other politician?  Who's to say that your ideas are what's best for the country and not the people's or everybody else's.  The best way to make change is to be true and stand up for what you believe in.  If your intentions are truly honorable then eventually people will come around.  This country/world needs a leader more than it needs a politician.

President Obama's stimulus package for creating work in the construction industry in America in 2009 will greatly benefit illegal construction workers. The report says somewhere in the neighborhood of 300,000 illegal immigrants working construction in America will benefit from the stimulus package! This will also spur more illegal immigration knowing the more construction jobs gained by those here illegally, the more money they make can be sent back to Mexico and other nations to support their families and local towns! The Mexican government applauded Barack Obama for helping the Mexican illegals in his stimulus package and vowed to make sure he has all the cheap Mexican labor needed to do these projects and assured the president they will work a lot cheaper than the American construction workers are willing to accept. Mexico stated $8.00 an hour American money is plenty for construction workers, working in the USA, anymore than that is being greedy! The Mexican government is elated with the Obama Administration! The "White House" declined to comment to the Fox news network!  Legal American workers simply cannot win according to Fox News!
u9g2Cl6Eaa	Do not know really.

All state and federally funded clinics and hospitals are bound by law to provide care for the uninsured and the indigent. That is a fact. NO ONE in this country goes without medical care.<br>  <br>  Anyone who thinks that socialized medicine is so great needs to talk to Canadians and Mexicans and South Americans and ask why it is they come to the U.S. when they need care. <br>  <br>  A prominent government official in Canada has promoted social medicine there for years and years and used her entire career to ram it down everyone's throat. She was recently diagnosed with cancer and is getting treatments in California. Go figure.<br>  <br>  You might also speak to people in England about how many years they wait to get a pacemaker, how many patients are misdiagnosed and how incompetent physicians are since the best of the best no longer care to subject themselves to the rigors of medicine in exchange for the government-determined salaries.<br>  <br>  Universal/national/social healthcare -- no matter what you call it, it's still a pig. <br>  <br>  People who promote it have no earthly idea what they're talking about.|`|hdUmMuN9aa	Perhaps I missed it...<br>  <br>  Where exactly did the federal government come in  and control the health care in your links?<br>  <br>  If you refuse to derive an understanding as to the reasons for our descent...perhaps you should remain on the sideline.|`|3785eeef30e9bd9c24c59001fddabeb6aa	I have the ultimate compromise for you.

Then they tell the kids that their account is overdrawn and expect them to remember to tell their parents.  (This is the grade school)  Finally you receive a notice in the mail when their account is over $10 in the negative.  You are being charged a normal lunch price when the kids are only receiving crackers.  I try to pay extra, but I can't keep up with the charges.  Especially when they charge other kids lunches to my child's account!  I send her lunch everyday and she still has to pay at times.  When I call to confront them they tell me she ate both.  <br>  <br>  At the high school my daughter there can't even take her account a nickel into the negative - they just won't feed her.  So she goes home to eat. <br>  <br>  I realize that food is expensive and it is hard for them to keep up, but when my oldest was in grade school if she got down to $2 in her account she was sent home a note and I always sent a check the next day.  <br>  <br>  They can't blame the parents for all of this ( I know their are parents who can't pay and at anytime their income changes they have a right to fill out the free lunch forms) but some of this falls in their hands to for not keeping the parents informed on the accounts.|`|2CO7pPdoaa	there were NO school lunches when I was in school, you either brought your own or went without....too many people are depending on the govt. for everything and that is the beginning of the end of democracy...BEWARE!!|`|WD6uLJxvaa	beggers cant be choosers.

It is possible to ingest enough energy without a well-balanced selection of individual nutrients and produce diseases that are noticeably different from those resulting from an overall insufficiency of nutrients and energy. Although all foods are a source of energy for the human body, it is possible to consume a seemingly adequate amount of food without getting the required minimum of energy (calories). For example, marasmus is the result of a diet that is deficient mainly in energy. Children who get enough calories, but not enough protein have kwashiorkor. This is typical in cultures with a limited variety of foods that eat mostly a single staple carbohydrate like maize or rice. These conditions overlap and are associated with multiple vitamin and mineral deficits, most of which have specific names and set of problems associated with them.<br>  <br>  <br>  Marasmus produces a very skinny child with stunted growth.<br>  <br>  <br>  Children with kwashiorkor have body fat, an enlarged liver, and edema-swelling from excess water in the tissues. They also have growth retardation.<br>  <br>  <br>  Niacin deficiency produces pellagra characterized by diarrhea, skin rashes, brain dysfunction, tongue, mouth and vaginal irritation, and trouble swallowing.<br>  <br>  <br>  Thiamine (Vitamin B1) deficiency causes beriberi, which can appear as heart failure and edema, a brain and nerve disease, or both.<br>  <br>  <br>  Riboflavin deficiency causes a sore mouth and throat, a skin rash, and anemia.<br>  <br>  <br>  Lack of vitamin C (ascorbic acid)-scurvy-causes hair damage, bleeding under the skin, in muscles and joints, gum disease, poor wound healing, and in severe cases convulsions, fever, loss of blood pressure, and death.<br>  <br>  <br>  Vitamin B12 is needed to keep the nervous system working properly. It and pyridoxine (vitamin B6) are both necessary for blood formation.<br>  <br>  <br>  Vitamin A deficiency causes at first loss of night vision and eventually blindness from destruction of the cornea, a disease called keratomalacia.<br>  <br>  <br>  Vitamin K is necessary for blood clotting.<br>  <br>  <br>  Vitamin D regulates calcium balance. Without it, children get rickets and adults get osteomalacia.<br>  <br>  People can recover from severe degrees of starvation to a normal stature and function. Children, however, may suffer from permanent mental retardation or growth defects if their deprivation was long and extreme.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  ETA:  This just proves that conservatives are only interested in children until they are born.|`|lyhnHhuWaa	The entitlement mentality is taking over the masses, I'm afraid.  This policy is in place at my kids' schools and I've never had a problem with it.  If I don't send their lunch money and their accounts are empty, they're given a peanut butter sandwich, veggies and milk.  Prior to the implementation of this policy, students would be sent to the office to borrow the money for a regular lunch.  The office would send notices over and over and there were children whose parents NEVER sent lunch money and NEVER paid the school back for the lunches their child received.  If anyone thinks families are the only ones hurting in this economy, they're nuts.  Schools usually have limited budgets to begin with.  It only becomes worse when it costs them more to feed kids and are expected to do it for free.  Now, there are programs in place to assist low income families.  Everyone is free to fill out the forms to apply for free or reduced cost meals.  If they qualify, their child will receive a free or reduced cost regular meal just like the ones who pay.  The school is reimbursed for these lunches.  When someone just doesn't bother to send the money to feed their child, the school doesn't get reimbursed.  IMO, it's outright theft and I'm glad the schools are cracking down on it.<br>  <br>  Edit - For people giving thumbs down to the evil uncaring folks, please explain what else the schools are supposed to do.  They don't get reimbursed when this happens.  In the case of my younger daughter's school, they were faced with a choice between stopping the lunch program altogether and going to this policy.  Which is worse? A sandwich for a few or no food for any of the kids?  I feel for any family that's caught in a tough spot.  As a single mother of two, I've been there myseslf.  When I've found myself short on money for lunches from the school, I've purchased the items needed to pack a lunch for a lower cost than the school lunches.  Bread and sandwich meat aren't that expensive and at least my children ate.  Again, someone please explain to me what the schools are supposed to do when they have NO control over the budget that they're given to work with.

So, he introduces the Second New Deal (which is less effective). Then, along comes WW2. And gets us out of the recession. FDR's programs worked, he just mis-calculated on the budget balancing and created another problem."<br>  <br>  Wow. How do you manage to survive from day to day when you dont live in reality?|`|AGP2dI6uaa	Gee, this recession started before President Obama took office.  It was not entirely caused in the month of January.  It won't be fixed in a month either. <br>  <br>  If you realistically expect the situation to be resolved by now then you are kind of an idiot.|`|FSsl25SLaa	If you talk about REAL conservatives, at least learn what a REAL liberal is.|`|ig7prXkvaa	Obama's policies are nothing more than recycled DNC playbook failed socialism!|`|AA10818613	LOL, there are no such thing as real conservatives.  LOL, they had control over the house, the senate and W.H for the last 8 years and they have proven themselves complete failures and can't even admit that fact.  They just offer more of the same policies and same answers to the problems that they created and that this country faces.  Roosevelt's programs helped unemployment drop from 25% to 30% down to 10% when he first implemented them.  He then proceeded to try to balance the budget by making cuts in the budget and that ended up creating a recession that drove up unemployment to 15% again.  Then along came the war and got us out.  His programs and the war were both government spending programs that got us out of the depression.  It's really too bad that you conservatives are so bent on rewriting the facts of history and economic history.  It only proves how desparate the GOP are when they try to pass off their lies and propaganda as history.  They have no new ideas to get us out of this mess THEY created except to try to push for more of the same crap that got us into this mess in the first place.  Liberalism has never failed.  This entire country is built by liberals.  If conservatives were in charge since our beginning we'd still be under British rule saluting the queen.<br>  <br>  The conservatives are bound for a big loss in 2010 if they keep up this same garbage they are trying to pass off as something new.  They have no vision and no policies to deal with the issues we face. The American people know it and are smarter than that.|`|yhTPcF81aa	First off, you are just repeating twisted facts you heard from right wing extremists.   The truth is:  The Great Depression was caused when the stock market, with the lack of regulations, crashed during a REPUBLICANS watch.  The Republican (Hoover) made a few programs to create jobs, but it did nothing to solve the 40% unemployment.  Then, comes FDR who intorduces the New Deal.  He gets banks back on their feet, creates jobs (by creating highways and electricity plants which are invaluable in todays society), and ends the depression by 1937.   THEN, in an effort to balance the budget (against the advice of his economic experts), he ends up creating a recession.  So, he introduces the Second New Deal (which is less effective).  Then, along comes WW2.  And gets us out of the recession.  FDR's programs worked, he just mis-calculated on the budget balancing and created another problem.  <br>  <br>  And now, in todays America, the financial markets and housing markets were deregulated (yes by clinton and republicans) which then  put us in the mess we are in today.  <br>  <br>  Now, im not saying we need to regulate everything.  We need to keep our economy free from too many regulations because that will merely restrict growth.  But we need SOME restrictions so banks dont run the economy into the ground (as they have just done).  Its all about BALANCE.  Once we find that right BALANCE, our economy will be stable, and flourish once again.  <br>  <br>  So please, end your petty political biases and see the truth.  We need both regulations and free-trade for our economy.  Not one or the other.|`|50e4ff35eca1b414ab4d2b69cbd101fbaa	First he wants to be like HONEST Abe (that comparison is ridiculous, isn't it?), now he wants to be like FDR.

Public paid Teachers Union members teach to always vote for a Democrat, no matter how bad and unqualified they are.<br>  <br>  Now, they've even ignored the Constitution and elected a foreign born and educated president.|`|AA10811674	Well it worked when FDR did it.

He sounded like he was talking to the American people as if we are a bunch of children.  It was patronizing, condescending and the content was pretty nonexistant.  The GOP is going to lose in 2010 big time.  They have no new ideas, no vision and absolutely no sense of what the 21st century needs for the country.  They are the party of old southern farts.  The fact that Jindal brought up Katrina as an example of government failure is hilarious since it was the GOP in charge of government at the time!

DCT5NlXcaa	They would never buy it back if Sarah Palin came with the deal.|`|AA10024510	No likely.  Not only does Alaska have a lot of oil and mineral wealth, but (more importanly) it is a transportation hub for North America.  While not much freight hits the shores of Alaska, ships skirt the Aleutians, and shipping/supply planes (both military and commercial) stop at Anchorage and Fairbanks more than most people imagine.  While this is very advantageous for us, it is too far from Moscow to be as much value to them as to us, so their offering price would be commensurately low.  Canada, on the other hand, might be interested in making the purchase (I would welcome that!), but that is equally unlikely, being as it would probably take a few decades of Canada's GDP to buy Alaska...|`|PaLJ4pU8aa	How much could we get for Detroit?

Maybe as revenge for her "lonely disfunctional childhood".  She also has no grasp of reality, she keeps saying that the church, her neighbors and her family will help her out.<br>  I see TMZ camped out front of her parent's house everyday and I don't see any other volunteers helping her folks out.  Only person that offered her shelter and help is that "Little Angels Group" and so far crazy lady has not accepted it.  Still holding out for the million dollar donations I guess.|`|c9bdef5bb31ceed680934e1e0696f061aa	I heard she has been paid 2 million and is looking for a bigger home for all her children.

She is an idiot and cruel mother.|`|e2104bb6f4cd0597228a673340a9a643aa	I grant you that she's not too bright, but some of your allegations aren't correct. Child endangerment is not defined by any of the criteria in your question. Furthermore, none of the octuplets have yet left the hospital. So no, I don't think she belongs in jail. However, you can be sure that CPS will be taking a hard look at her and her ability to care for so many children, and because this case has garnered so much publicity, they will be under pressure to act. Hopefully, they'll take these babies and put them up for adoption. Even better would be to force this woman to have her tubes tied.
8ENRWmoMaa	IDK, but I liked his speech, he seems like the indian Ron Paul.  Most of his ideas are in line with pure republican fiscal policy and I agree 100% with him on the obama stimulas bill.  Pulling out of a recession involves lowering taxes and reducing the gov't spending, not increasing the size of the gov't and deficet, and nationalizing the banks.  The american gov't is going to own 40% of Citibank.<br>  <br>  Also note that in his state he has a 75-80% approval rating and has actaully completed his campaige promises in his first year of his first term.  It just all the Obama bots don't seem to want a fix to the gov't they just want a free handout and way to get money out of this stimulus.|`|pLbRwbX8aa	This man is unrealistic.  In his speech he told a story of how the governent got in the way during the rescue process after Katrina hit.  Repubicans preach limited government, but they don't ever practice this concept when they govern because it is an unrealistic approach.  Would he rather the government completely ignore this situation and not send any help or fudning to the Katrian victims?  How bad would this situation be without government help?  Can you imagine the outcry from the peolpe of Louisiana if we had this so-called limited government in place.  The only thing limited government does is protect rich people.  The peole of this country vote and elect government officals so that they can allocate tax money for this exact reason.  Republicans, stop living in a dream world and try to offer some real solutions.  Doing nothing during a crisis is irresponsible and selfish.|`|Cn1tSHLpaa	I suspect he's counting on the 3rd Grader vote since his speech last night seemed geared toward those with that type of mentality.  the only thing missing was "boys and girls" after each GOP talking point and maybe a Muppet or two.|`|goe3y4FPaa	ITS ALL ABOUT ''WORK ETHIC''|`|AA11828439	Yes, and doing it badly.|`|dl1yuCoFaa	Yes, it seems so. He's a fast moving politician. He's gone from Congress, to governer of Louisiana, to potential Republican candidate in 2012 much too fast. He danced all around a question recently when asked whether he would consider running for president in 2012. He never would say "Yes" or "No." He's already raising funds, stating that it is for his bid for reelection in the next Gov. election. However, I'm willing to bet that he runs for President with those funds instead. <br>  <br>  The guy who states that he just wants to serve the state of Louisiana and its citizens, just wants to serve Bobby Jindal and family in reality. Just another career politician.

Some are mocking him for offering a piece of his life story, but it was actually a pretty clever move.  Immigrant parents, came here with nothing, worked hard and succeeded.  They did it without the government and proved that the American spirit and desire to succeed does result in success.  In other words, people can make it without government and we're being led down a path that's stripping us of that drive for self-reliance and independence that make the country so great.  He may be served up as the clown, but his words will go a long way toward helping the party to rally.  I wouldn't discount the speech as a total failure so readily.  If you look past delivery, there was a definite message there.  As for Obama's speech, however eloquently delivered, was more of the same... nothing to see there... move along.|`|DypTl9Zdaa	You haven't been looking very hard.  There are quite a few places that are doing fact checking for example the Associated Press.  You should read it.  Obama sounded great unless you know your facts and can see the inconsistencies.

Since there were no modern conveniences, it took an incredible amount of time to cook, clean, do laundry, sew clothes, take care of children, etc.<br>  <br>  We had a patriarchal society.  Women owned very little property.  When a woman married, all of her assets became her husband's.  Therefore, if she was in a bad marriage, it was impossible to leave because her husband would retain all of the assets and keep the children as well.  She had very few ways to support herself and she would be an outcast.<br>  <br>  What is very incredible is that Madame CJ Walker created a line of skin care and cosmetics that were sold door to door, like Avon in later years.  This was a way for women to earn money and it was an acceptable method.  Madame Walker was also black.  You can imagine the courage and determination it took for her to be able to accomplish this.

There would then be the chance.<br>  <br>  You have to be willing to die for your country, and since they would be illegal aliens, the USA is not their country.|`|AA12365543	No. Only legal immigrants and US citizens can enlist.|`|ipqxNSvCaa	You can't legally join the U.S. military.  Legal permanent residents can, and do.  There's also a plan afoot to allow H1-Bs to do so, but in all cases, legal residency is required.|`|f5058943507feef30be15c90091dab2eaa	It's not legal, but there is a possibility.   There is some evidence the Army lies about this to recruit.   Some times they do follow through.   I wouldn't depend as a way to legalize.
rfMwhOA3aa	Such a thing has never occurred, but I would have to say that state's do not have the constitutional power to do such a thing. A territory can petition to become a state, but not visa versa. The federal government, to my knowledge, does not have the power to cause a state to return to territory status by act of statute. (It would require a constitutional amendment).|`|goe3y4FPaa	MP|`|g5nSbVzIaa	Last time States tried to leave the union, there was a huge war.
yPbdCa5Baa	I was in the Navy a long time ago. Back then Boot Camp was kind of a walk in the park. We didn't run all that much. <br>  <br>  To be honest, I was nervous about PT too. I guess everybody is... to some extent. Some can swim, some can't. Some are track stars, some have a tough time walking fast up a flight or stairs. Some can do pull-ups. Some can hardly get their arms over their heads. Keep in mind that millions of kids have been through it... and passed. In Boot Camp, they still want you to make it. So, if you have a problem in one or more areas, you'll get extra time to improve. <br>  <br>  Now, when you get into special training, things change a little. In "A" school it's more up to you. If you need help, you have to figure out a way to get it. In SWCC or SEAL training, they really don't want you to make it. At least that's the way it is in SEAL training. They try to get you to quit.<br>  <br>  I'm sorry, but the answer than comes to mind is, "It's not the pace.... that's pretty easy... they only expect about four miles... it's carrying the 160-pound guy on your back through the obstacle course..." But that's not true. I'd check the Great Lakes site...<br>  <a href="http://www1.netc.navy.mil/nstc/rtcgl/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www1.netc.navy.mil/nstc/rtcgl/ind...</a><br>  <br>  I checked it out and also found the reference to a 20-minute run, but the only distance I saw was a mile and a half. I'm an old goat and I think that's pretty easy... almost a fast walk. I used to swim a mile in 20 minutes. That was a few years ago... when I lettered in swimming in college ;-) <br>  <br>  If it's bothering you, you might contact Great Lakes... their number's on the site.<br>  <br>  Really, don't sweat it. You'll make it.|`|LUosDsYaaa	In the Navy you run for your PRT.<br>  <br>  We only run 1.5 mile.<br>  <br>  How long it takes you to run 1.5 mile is how long it takes you.<br>  <br>  It is timed. <br>  <br>  As an old man, ready to retire, I was allowed to 'run' it in 15 minutes. Which was really a walk.|`|fJ67andPaa	The longest you are required to be able to run is 20 minutes.  That doesn't mean it is the longest amount of time you'll run.  If you get hit with Intensive Training (a form of punishment), they can make you run 5 miles or more (it just isn't required to be sustained).  Not to mention during IT, they don't stop until someone goes to medical.  Good luck!|`|wUJYhaYVaa	The pace would most likely depend on the distance you have to run in that given time. If it's a group run then it would probably be paced by whatever PT group you get put into. I'm not too familiar w/ Navy, that's at least how it works in the Air Force. Sorry this probably doesn't give you the info you were looking for.|`|x76M2DBNaa	actually the longest substained run is 30 minutes long. at whatever pace the rdc will let you run just no walking

zhk8o514aa	They always do that at the "speech to congress".  I do agree it's very annoying.|`|4bWUiIVdaa	I felt the exact same way brotha. It was annoying as hell|`|xxDjV6Axaa	Don't think for one minute that the people in the audience are not plants.  They HAVE to be cleared before they can even attend an event like this.  Selective audiences.  But I would like you to read something about Obama and his personality so you might understand him more.<br>  <br>  The problem with Obama’s superiority complex is that he is blinded to the fact that many can see through him.  Like all people with that personality disorder, he assumes he is so much smarter that no one will actually be able to figure him out.  And that is the fatal mistake which causes their downfall.<br>  <br>  Obama has a narcissistic personality.  I am not just pulling this out of the air. There is much more to this personality disorder but these excerpts condense it pretty well.  I am sure other behavioral scientists and psychologists spotted this fairly quickly.<br>  <br>  “Narcissistic personality disorder (NPD) is a personality disorder defined by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, the diagnostic classification system used in the United States, as "a pervasive pattern of grandiosity, need for admiration, and a lack of empathy." <br>  “excessively preoccupied with issues of personal adequacy, power and prestige.”<br>  “Though individuals with NPD are often ambitious and capable, the inability to tolerate setbacks, disagreements or criticism, along with lack of empathy, make it difficult for such individuals to work cooperatively with others or to maintain long-term professional achievements.”<br>  “ To the extent that people are pathologically narcissistic, they can be controlling, blaming, self-absorbed, intolerant of others’ views, unaware of others' needs and of the effects of their behavior on others, and INSISTENT THAT OTHERS SEE THEM AS THEY WISH TO BE SEEN.”|`|hUYaaXBvaa	i just came in at the end so i didn't go through the entire 50 minutes or however long it was<br>  they do those things becuase they agree, they want the point to be emphasized as more relevant or something<br>  yes when people clap incessantly it does lengthen things and draws focus away, which can be annoying<br>  That was Nancy Pelosi next to Joe Biden|`|7nGwou8uaa	i totally agree, it was the most annoying thing ever, i gave up on paying any attention to it|`|WCkOUF9aaa	They always do that & I hate it too.|`|c2hfVjxgaa	Nancy Polios annoyed me two....She is in love with him|`|d65d0f197c64d26de1e69f8246554c11aa	I didn't bother to watch it. I read the transcript this morning. I find that I get a much better understanding of what is being said from the transcript regarding political speeches in general. It removes the emotion and audience reaction. Based on the comments from this morning. The lady you are complaining about was Nancy Pelosi Speaker of the House. The general consensus is that she seriously over did it in the reaction department.|`|oojO4WAraa	I agree.  That lady was Nancy Pelosi - and she was up and down all during the speech and seemed to be smirking and laughing at what Obama was saying.  <br>  <br>  The whole thing would have been shorter if not for all the applause.  They could have held all that til the end so we could just hear the speech.|`|htxwTAAQaa	Most of the clapping was partisan support from the democrats, sometimes republicans got up when they heard words like "taxpayer" or "fiscal responsibility"<br>  <br>  The lady behind Obama was Nancy Pelosi, senate majority leader.|`|AA10164318	This is a traditional way that Congress responds to a new President address to Congress.<br>  <br>  They did it for Bush too, only it was the other side in majority then.|`|gDuDNeRcaa	they probably did that on purpose whenever he was going to mumble something about the devils work that he's following.|`|wnzK56fiaa	It looked like they were doing the 'wave'.|`|kyTBaYFlaa	it can take a little patience to sit through one of these sometimes especially if you are not a political junkie. if you just want to know what he said the best thing to do is check out the news immediately after the speech and you will get all the hi-lights along with "expert analysis" . you don't have to sit through the actual speech. the applause is meant to show respect and encouragement to the speaker and if everyone just sat there staring at him with no reaction shown it would be very discouraging to the speaker.|`|9979bb6f0e03a8d3d1be61eab96d087daa	I found it funny - you know Biden was about to fall over from standing up so much and that other lady would almost bounce in order to stand up so friggin much.<br>  <br>  I found in stupid and senseless - but fun to watch those who didn't stand up just sit and look like they weren't impressed, LOL.|`|KOd5Spehaa	<a href="http://www.minnpost.com/ericblackblog/2009/02/25/6950/obamas_speech_9_on_a_10-point_scale" rel="nofollow">http://www.minnpost.com/ericblackblog/20...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.thenewsstar.com/article/20090225/UPDATES01/90225006" rel="nofollow">http://www.thenewsstar.com/article/20090...</a><br>  <br>  its a tv show dude just another sick boring worthless piece of $%t<br>  show. dont believe any of it...real things start off here<br>  <a href="http://www.thebigagenda.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.thebigagenda.com/</a>|`|i3KOwxeyaa	LOL, yes that was very noticable. I understand everyone's gesture of respect and agreement with the President's speech, but let him get deliver several points before applauding after each statement!|`|VhHVjMe8aa	I agree!  Did you see the programs they were holding?  I think that was  the speech written down and the "green lady", she's Speaker of the House, was reading ahead!  The clapping was over the top!|`|Ho3lRmDMaa	The majority party always does that for the president if they are from the same party. Nothing new.

Uxe1GjP0aa	I think that those wishing to use the laws available to avoid responsibility do so because they have the desire and the knowledge, from Wall Street bankers to trailer trash. Most people are responsible, though. <br>  Governments only know how to spend. That is their nature. Tax and Spend. It's the irresponsible behavior of a government to give away money from all tax payers to a few who clearly have nothing to offer in return that needs to stop. <br>  A hike in taxation is sure to happen, as it's been put off now for at least 2 and half years. Pay off your debts, minimize spending if you can, save if you can because it's not going to get better.|`|l9Xg8Dv4aa	I guess no one wants to be responsible for this!|`|a9e937dafab0e1205c0c23b2f6caefa6aa	i would say that your understanding is wrong.

As a matter of fact we DO know what its like to run a business.  I have owned several.

What gets on my goat is, they got the majority vote in the election, why?.|`|EQfXpmX6aa	Its not just labour,all politicians including the house of lords are selfish money grabbers and only represent the rich who bought them their ticket.|`|44AkhdRnaa	Off course they can sink lower.<br>  <br>  new labour are inept, deluded & as you rightly say morally bankrupt.|`|goe3y4FPaa	LIKE THE ''TITANIC'' YEAH|`|G8zAPz8Maa	Damn Mandy's good.<br>  (Why do you think I brought him back from disgrace again)|`|v811KD7raa	thats a very cynical take on it.  id prefer to give him the benefit of the doubt<br>  <br>  i suppose labour couldve sank lower by opposing the minimum wage, but only the tories would be so immoral|`|99399280e2e93e47c5b56b48ad0d3730aa	Yeah........ New Conservatives are the answer. They are full of sTORIES that will make you sleep. Check with your local council and see what they are doing!|`|JhC6BvPpaa	I think you are correct, and Mandelson used today's 'Ivan Cameron's story' to bury that story. I think there were a few other things that may have slipped us buy too. The fact that there were no PM questions gave NuLab the opportunity to leave unanswered Q's about the FSA and the banking / bonuses scandals and the LDV van makers and other vehicle manufacturers financial problems. Gordon Brown must feel like he's got off the hook this week.|`|AA12121752	Yes, probably|`|AA10352420	No  we have reached the bottom of the pit of the politics.

Time for a clean sweep, we have had their s**t under our feet for far too long. <br>  Vote for anyone but these soldiers in arms. this country is in desperate need of salvation and neither of these party's have the b***s to deliver. <br>  Spin? It is we who are spinning at their audacity.|`|ab37b6bdb0bbbf15c8bbba9c3715bb8faa	You think maybe Mandelson has 'bottomed' out now ?

Welfare entitlements do not cover fertility treatments. It will cover testing but not the IVF procedure. She got the money for the treatments from her disability payments.|`|rJJhMQ37aa	And who is going to decide what is blatant?|`|dsSRL2Jlaa	in this case, the govt on california should take them away. Eight kids in one 2-bedroom house=child neglection.<br>  However in general if you do it blatantly you have to go situational. If its no worse than other kids whose parents are not recieving welfare, then maybe. As far as laws, somthing has to be done here. If this slides without major improvements to the system and they get that 1 mil house they were eyeing... I will be surprised. You have to keep in mind that this whole thing is up to california alone which is a very liberal state.|`|TcMa4a7paa	I am not in favor of milking the system  However, the fact remains that the children have been born.  We should not punish the children by starving them because their mother and her fertility doctor have bad judgement.  This situation would have never occurred if the doctor would have acted ethically.
bda08b314a4966c36d4acd161c9ec0f6aa	He is going to change how we do business in our country and how we do  business abroad. He is going to change the secrecy of the last eight years of the previous administration and be above board and straightforward with the American people and not sugar coat everything. He will try and regain the respect of other countries. Bush lost the respect of most of the citizens in our wonderful country, President Obama will try and give us hope  and make us realize we are the only ones who can change our country for the better. The President has laid out some of how he wants to accomplish this in his campaign and more since he took office, he laid out more last night in his address. He has not laid out all of his plans because the recovery has to be done in small steps. You cannot change eight or even ten years of the wrong actions and non actions of the previous administrations over night and not even in five weeks time. Getting banks to give responsible loans to people, getting people to spend money and not be afraid to, making businesses accountable to the American people, giving tax cuts to some and raising taxes on some, creating jobs (already happening.) I am sure I have forgotten some things.|`|FDVuAiHOaa	Infrastructure, energy, foreign relations, education.  That was his platform when he ran, at least.  Just because some of his voters are stupid doesn't mean they all are.|`|FSsl25SLaa	He promises the abolition of partisan politics - failed.<br>  He promises a step up for those who can't help themselves - going about it the wrong way.<br>  Dependence on green energy as opposed to oil imports.<br>  Regulation of Wall St.<br>  <br>  Etc.

You were inspired by President Obama's speech.<br>  <br>  I think it's very easy to criticise the President for his "rampant" spending. However, I think the clear cut logical answer to this is in the form of a question...."What else CAN he do?"<br>  <br>  We can say "let's just leave it in the hands of the American People". How can we do that, when we tried that already. The American People squandered their savings buying houses they couldn't afford.<br>  <br>  We can't say "let's leave it up to the banks and main street to fix this". We can't say this because, we've tried that already, too. It's been stated time and time again about the high level of mis-managed investments and the like that has ALSO contributed to this messotopia.<br>  <br>  So, what else can we do? Lead into a decade of doom?<br>  <br>  Kemo City is no Obama cheerleader, but instead, is a REALIST.

I agree that it is a  lowering of the bar for them... but then, since they have to play to the moronic masses....|`|i5F2jwvhaa	who is responsible for blacks being free?<br>  <br>  Republicans.<br>  <br>  Next..<br>  <br>  thumbs down will not change history|`|Yzb44aV6aa	I wouldnt generalize that far..I'm female and dont want to be put in the same group with Palin!<br>  <br>  But they are trying to hard and choosing the wrong candidates for the job.|`|c85WWXV7aa	It seems you really don't pay attention to your nation the way you should. If you did you would know Bobby Jindal was close running for the V.P. with McCain.  And if you would take your blinders off you would see there where some very valid points brought up last night. I do find it funny that when the Democrats looked to the future in 04 with Obama nothing was said. But, now that the Republicans are doing the same it is looked at as trying to inject a ploy.|`|ASXeYOjAaa	No, they plan to show they're Americans. They already spent plenty of time showing they were Democrats. That's why they lose.<br>  Palin, "that Black guy" and "the Indian guy" are conservatives. That YOU see gender and color pretty-much proves you're a liberal.|`|73A0T8ltaa	Don't talk that jive 'round here turkey, because it seems the republicans are rather diverse, and the ones coming forward seem pretty educated to me.

And Bobby Jindal is probably one of the most hardline conservative voices in the party.<br>  <br>  Its not like they just pulled women and minorities off the street.  Those three you mentioned are all qualified and capable leaders who worked their way up by doing their jobs well.<br>  <br>  Isnt that exactly how a race-neutral party SHOULD look?  People becoming leaders by qualification, not to meet an arbitrary sense of affirmative-action balance (Roland Burris)?<br>  <br>  Minorities arent as stupid as the Democrats want them to be.  Some of them realize that being dependent on government handouts and voting for Democrats to keep them coming isnt a blueprint for success in America.

He owed paybacks for the favors he received during the campaign.  He HAD to follow through on those promises.  It was urgent that he immediately give them the money for their pet projects.  Of course he knew that we could not afford these projects but that didn’t even factor in this decision.  Since he was able to get elected by telling people what they wanted to hear, he figured he could do it again with the stimulus bill.  Obama: Just tell the people that it will help them.  They’ll believe it.  They believe everything I say.<br>  <br>  How is it being bipartisan to force a bill like this?  Asking for input but shooting down every suggestion.  Because he had no intention of changing the bill to any significant extent.  He couldn’t and still pay back the people he promised.  We need to just accept that is what he did and now we will all pay for it.  <br>  <br>  Higher taxes are coming and he knows that too.  But there’s still plenty of time to blame the Bush administration and tell the people that the crisis was just too huge to overcome.  We will all have to be patriotic and pay more taxes.

I do not understand how he, as a Republican, could complain about Obama's proposed spending budget when George W Bush went absolutely crazy with out-of-control spending, no-bid contracts, failure to include the costs of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan in the budget, earmarks for Republicans and total lack of accountability. And his delivery was sadly like a Mr. Rogers script, targeting three year olds. But I think it would offend the memory of Mr. Rogers, late of Latrobe, Pennsylvania, to compare him with Gov. Jindal. Fred Rogers was far superior even in Spanish.|`|zmmP52P3aa	I'm apparently not as big a fan of Mr. Rogers as you, so I'm not sure.|`|iy9xz6oNaa	Yes it was but a scary one.. i have seen no birth certificate for bobby jindal and there may be a link between him and terrorist!<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism_in_India" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism_i...</a>|`|0cee90c25888a78a0b401efe2b753fd3aa	He looked like he was reading a book to a group of 6th graders.

All I care is that he's president. Don't really care what he does.|`|l9Xg8Dv4aa	yes.
t3QAaSN9aa	According to modern-day conservatives, apparently yes.  They define socialism as any kind of government action of which they don't approve.  Government action that they like is not socialism.  There is no rhyme or reason to their thinking, just propaganda and buzz words.|`|48b84a8f546ab32d894f3370f4eca47faa	Tax policy and the political definition of socialist, are two separate things, socialism is when the government controls things that the public could easily control if allowed, a possible return to 91% tax rate was one reason why smart thinking people began calling for a national sales tax.|`|c3vPZfghaa	No. they were just trying to get taxes out of the rich that used loopholes to pay ittle or no income tax whatsoever.<br>  It is the reason for the Tax Reform Act of 1969.<br>  <br>  Even at 91% tax rate in that era, there were so many loopholes for the rich, that they stil didn't pay anything close to that in taxes.<br>  Just like today when they have those 50% tax brackets where once they use their loopholes, tax shelters, and subsidies they end up paying more like 20% in taxes, and even less if they are using offshore tax havens to prevent paying billions in income tax.|`|DB7UMkGCaa	"Was the US was a socialist country in 1958 under Eisenhower, when the rich were taxed at 91%"<br>  <br>  No, but that is a socialistic tax rate. And you must remermber: Eisenhower was a liberal-moderate Republican. Not a conservative Republican.|`|wnzK56fiaa	They have been slowly implementing socialism in this country since Wilson.|`|Yzb44aV6aa	FYI...socialism is not a form of government, its a political theory.  If you are going to fling dirt, at least do it correctly.|`|TYW2OQM5aa	Wow. You're using wikipedia to try to prove a point? <br>  <br>  That 91% wasn't on a person's entire earnings. It was only on the money earned after a certain level was reached. There was a war and like the tax it didn't last. The rich were able to pay more of their money for the war so that you could sit at home and have the freedom to complain about how much money their making and offer you a place to work. <br>  <br>  We weren't Socialist then and with any luck you and Obama won't let it happen to us now.|`|AA11634870	Excellent, we need to go back to those days of taxation for the rich.<br>  I think it was Bush's guy who first brought up the word socialism because of their economic answers or no answers, giving away Clinton's surplus to the rich, now they want to place the blame if anyone will listen on Democrats.|`|091ca1bd7e49158f5110601cac84ad3baa	Every since the income tax started we have become more and more socialist. So yes<br>  <br>  And someone still needs to convince me how taxing someones labor is not a slave tax...?? If I first have to give a cut to the "man" by force before I get MY money then I am some type of slave for sure?|`|73760ec70f62b217eab4a5ab28ce822baa	No, it wasn't, and neither will it be under Obama.|`|AA10465540	No, it was not and the rich have never been taxed at 91%.|`|de0fc1da097f66a349eb15de28f1834faa	Yes. It started in 1933 under FDR.
R02vAa48aa	The possibility exists that innocent men and women may be put to death.<br>  Financial costs to taxpayers of capital punishment is several times that of keeping someone in prison for life. <br>  It violates the "cruel and unusual" clause in the Bill of Rights. <br>  The endless appeals and required additional procedures clog our court system. <br>  We as a society have to move away from the "eye for an eye" revenge mentality if civilization is to advance. <br>  It sends the wrong message: why kill people who kill people to show killing is wrong. <br>  Life in prison is a worse punishment and a more effective deterrent. <br>  Some jury members are reluctant to convict if it means putting someone to death. <br>  Mentally ill patients may be put to death. <br>  It creates sympathy for the monsterous perpetrators of the crimes.|`|fSlZQzS4aa	I'm opposed to the death penalty because it only would work if murderers were capable of rational thought instead of being motivated by alcohol, drugs and testosterone.  It is about time that the United States joint the rest of the Western civilized nations and abolish it.<br>  <br>  The death penalty may be a regular feature in the news but in real life, it isn't even a blip on the criminal radar screen and hasn't been significant part of the justice system for over a century. During the last 100 years, the most people executed in one year was 198 in 1935. There were 50 or so killed in 2007 and 37 in 2008 (half of those in the enlightened state of Texas.) This represents one execution for every 8 million people. For a nation of 300 million people this is statistically zero, absolutely insignificant when compared with the number of murders that happen.  There is much hoopla but little results.<br>  <br>  If it was done away with entirely the savings could be spent in ways that prevent murders. Most of the expense is up front at the investigation and trial stage and serves only to let grandstanding prosecutors pander to the public by showing how tough they want us to think they are. <br>  <br>  There may be a great amount of support for the death penalty including on this board but I don't think most people realize that it is a very glitzy package with nothing inside--a reality nothing. <br>  <br>  In my state, California, there has been about one execution every three years since the death penalty was reinstated.  There are over 600 inmates on death row so at that rate it will take 1,800 years to kill them all provided we don't get any more.  The most common cause of death on death row is natural causes followed by suicide.  Lethal injection is a distant third.  <br>  <br>  The expense of keeping capital punishment on the books is absolutely enormous.  Prosecuting a death penalty case which is unlikely to result in an execution costs about three times what the same case would cost if death was off the table.  As an example, the state of Maryland figures it has spent $37 Million EACH for the executions it has carried out since reinstating the death penalty. When you look at the costs, this is a criminal waste of the public's money. <br>  <br>  Like it or not, the death penatly is pretty pointless.|`|b6a091811b28070a1bddd2f561070d4baa	The point of debate in school is to be able to debate for either side. When I was in school the teams switched half way through so that you would have to debate from the other point of view.|`|LJ0fRcMGaa	i am not religious but how about''Thou shalt not kill"|`|2425cc2cee9552b0f1a53567bfd23012aa	Here are a few:<br>  <br>  130 people wrongfully convicted people were sentenced to death and were lucky to be exonerated and released, eventually. DNA, available in less than 10% of all homicides, can’t guarantee we won’t execute innocent people. If someone is convicted and later found innocent you can release him from prison, but not from the grave.<br>  <br>  The death penalty doesn't prevent others from committing murder. No reliable study shows the death penalty deters others. Homicide rates are higher in states and regions that have it than in those that don’t.<br>  <br>  Life without parole, on the books in 48 states, also prevents reoffending. It means what it says, and spending 23 of 24 hours a day locked in a tiny cell is not a picnic. Life without parole costs less than the death penalty.<br>  <br>  The death penalty is much more expensive than life in prison. The high costs of the death penalty are for the complicated legal process, and the largest costs come at the beginning, for the pre trial process and for the trial itself. The point is to avoid executing innocent people.<br>  <br>  The death penalty isn't reserved for the worst crimes, but for defendants with the worst lawyers. It doesn't apply to people with money. When is the last time a wealthy person was on death row, let alone executed?<br>  <br>  Families of murder victims are not unanimous about the death penalty. However, even families who have supported the death penalty in principal have testified that the drawn-out death penalty process is painful for them and that life without parole is an appropriate alternative.<br>  <br>  Problems with speeding up the process. Over 50 of the innocent people released from death row had already served over a decade. Speed up the process and we will execute innocent people.<br>  <br>  Sources:<br>  Terrific resource specifically for students writing papers or debaters at<br>  <a href="http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/article.php?did=1917" rel="nofollow">http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/article....</a>  It has links to both sides (click on curriculum) and is easy to navigate.<br>  <br>  Death Penalty Information Center, www.deathpenaltyinfo.org,  for stats on executions, reports on costs, deterrence studies, links to FBI crime stats and links to testimony (at state legislatures) of victims' family members.<br>  <br>  FBI   <a href="http://www.fbi.gov/ucr/cius2006/data/table_04.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.fbi.gov/ucr/cius2006/data/tab...</a>  <br>  <br>  The Innocence Project, www.innocenceproject.org<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/COcosttestimony.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/COcostte...</a> page 3 and 4 on why the death penalty is so expensive<br>  <br>  And, for statements of victims’ families:<br>  <a href="http://www.nyadp.org/main/70308Statements.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.nyadp.org/main/70308Statement...</a><br>  www.mvfhr.org and www.mvfr.org

They are the ones who will process your ticket and will know all the laws and regulation. You should also ask the courts if you are allowed to take a driving school class. This will prevent your insurance from going up and points from being placed on your license. Just make sure you get the courts permission before doing so.

If so I'd recommend freezing the meal in it's entirety and not just keeping the box and screw. Seems odd that they would have the attorney call out of the blue like they did unless they know they had a problem.<br>  <br>  Good luck<br>  <br>  ADDED NOTE: thanks mrscasti for stating product liability attorney...I drew a blank on trying to remember this one.|`|wzwUcjvhaa	Better think this one out Buckeroo Put a metal screw in your microwave and turn it on and see what happens are you trying to say you bite into it?

'You ask a simple question which anyone should answer with no trouble. If the person hesitates, that puts you on the track.' <br>  <br>  'What sort of question?' asked Pelosi. <br>  <br>  Well, you might ask, 'Captain Cook made three trips around the world and died during one of them. Which one?'' <br>  <br>  Pelosi thought a moment, and then said with a nervous laugh, 'You wouldn't happen to have another example would you? I must confess I don't know much about history.'|`|8gnp5Kkjaa	Are you kidding?  She was smiling the entire time!  She was on the edge of her seat.  She could not wait to jump up and applaud her new president.

Personally I think she and Senator Reid are going to be more obstructionist than helpful to President Obama's administration.|`|le0DCZOFaa	She's kinda the equivalent of Paula Abdul.

36a3ynpJaa	I was really disappointed when I saw Jindal on TV the other day.  I thought he was another young Turk, like Obama, but he came off as a moron spewing the Disneyland-Vegas train line.  <br>  <br>  I want the US to have a two party system, but the Republicans are simply catering to to the far right and losing ground.  Obama could win by even more in 2012.|`|kZeu2Dyzaa	Gov. Jindal was questioning how doubling the funding for volcano monitoring was going to stimulate the economy (the current number of scientists performing this job is more than sufficient since outside of seismic activity there is no way to detect a potential eruption). This money was more additional pork spending to a group of people who supported Obama's campaign.<br>  <br>  <br>  As far as the ignorant comments above about pandering to the right, those posters are obviously not even remotely familiar with the Republican party and only know what the little liberals on the TV tell them. Bush 1 & 2 as well as McCain were more liberal than many Democrats and are not representative of the majority of the conservative base. The reason McCain lost was because the Republicans stayed home in disgust at the shameful pandering that McCain exhibited to left-wing agendas.<br>  <br>  EDIT @ Solitaire:<br>  A community-minded politician with the people's best interest at heart is the definition of a conservative. Liberals are the ones who believe that the government needs to interfere with everyday life because we aren't capable of living it on our own.|`|C7FtRe69aa	The Republicans are deperately looking for someone radical enough to appeal to the right wing fanatics that control the Republican party and dishonest enough to present a sane face to the American public.<br>  <br>  So far they have not succeeded. The problem is that there are very few Republicans who have been in politics long enough to run for high political office and who has not been caught with their hand in the cookie jar as have so many Republicans. Even newbies with little or no political experience or ability like Sarah Palin still misuse the power of their office to get at the people they don't like. The Republicans have found that it is very hard to run for office if you are in jail, or soliciting for gay sex in a public bathroom.|`|dl1yuCoFaa	As a native Louisianian, I was very disappointed in Jindal's speech Tue. night. This is not the first time recently, though, that I have sat and shaken my head at the TV when he speaks. He refused to answer a question on national TV last Sunday morning when he flatly refused to give a "Yes" or "No" answer to the question, "Will you consider running for president in 2012?" He danced all around the question.<br>  <br>  Jindal picked the wrong time to mention Katrina in his speech last night. It was a horrific incident, with great prolonged impact to the region, but people in other parts of the country are tired of hearing about it. To them, it's over. Mr. Jindal doesn't seem to understand that. Work on these issues at home, deal with it, don't speak about it on TV when rebutting the president's stimulus plan.<br>  <br>  Jindal's speech wasn't one of his finest last night. He seemed somewhat patronizing, and well, it just didn't sound like his typical speeches. And don't sell him short. Jindal is extremely intelligent. I've heard him speak numerous other times. However, his speech to Congress indicates to me that he's not just "Gov. Jindal" anymore...he's sounding more like the standard conservative Republican fare that we hear on a regular basis. It's too bad. He started out in Congress representing Louisiana with "the district's best interest in mind". Then a successful run for Gov. with "the state's best interest in mind". Now he seems just like any other career politician.|`|i9V7t3pRaa	It's his first time giving a speech to a wide audience.  You ever have any issues the first time you did anything?  And to the responders who say the Republicans only try to appease far right wingers... live in the real world.  Bush 1, Bush 2, and John McCain were as moderate and centrist as they come.  Real conservatives/right wingers don't claim any responsibility for them.<br>  <br>  Republicans in Washington haven't been following conservative principals since the times of Reagan.
1AgD0dsBaa	History making speech or History making Jargon?  The question needs to be answered with the truth. After all, Obama wants nothing but the truth, <br>  <br>  ""In 1769, the very first self-propelled road vehicle was a military tractor invented by French engineer and mechanic, Nicolas Joseph Cugnot (1725 - 1804). Cugnot used a steam engine to power his vehicle, built under his instructions at the Paris Arsenal by mechanic Brezin. It was used by the French Army to haul artillery at a whopping speed of 2 1/2 mph on only three wheels. The vehicle had to stop every ten to fifteen minutes to build up steam power. The steam engine and boiler were separate from the rest of the vehicle and placed in the front (see engraving above). The following year (1770), Cugnot built a steam-powered tricycle that carried four passengers.<br>  <br>  In 1771, Cugnot drove one of his road vehicles into a stone wall, making Cugnot the first person to get into a motor vehicle accident. This was the beginning of bad luck for the inventor. After one of Cugnot's patrons died and the other was exiled, the money for Cugnot's road vehicle experiments ended.""http://inventors.about.com/libra...<br>  <br>  So now we know the truth as too who inveted the first automobile, there are no symantics or skimatics to this arguement. Its not about gas powered or steam powered. This French man was the first designer of steam powered automobiles. Yes, a "Frenchy"<br>  <br>  So as far as the speech, like a I said before we need to regulate those banks. All the contraversy and problems with these large corporations taking hand outs. <br>  <br>  The Debt Forgiveness act should be inplemented. Forgive all debts to US Citizens and give every one a clean slate. Since our tax payers money is going to pay somany dam bills to Corporate Executives who """Hog"" all the cash.<br>  <br>  I really did not watch the speech. I went to sleep.|`|Wq8vQqvbaa	No Surprise Here that Obama did that!<br>  <br>  He also thinks his own Uncle Helped Liberate Auschwitz ~ LOL!|`|4pHTkTUaaa	I think the sad part is that people on here are going to somehow try and defend it.|`|AKjACjkOaa	maybe his speech writers are tryin to set him up, they could have a lot of fun with that!!|`|MvC6n3DWaa	I suppose it depends on how you review history. The first successful gas powered car was invented in the US. However, there were more basic versions prior to that which I believe you are referring to. But I must ask, was that the entire content of the speech? Is that all he said? Of course not! If that is all you heard.............well............that's pretty scary!<br>  <br>  The even funnier thing is that the best criticism you could generate was where he misspoke. Oh boy...that's a knee slapper!|`|tP8W6Q1Qaa	His speech writers should have known better... after all, Obama thinks there are 57 states out there.|`|7OQWOaGmaa	Obama followers will have a great comeback for you.  I don't.  Maybe he thought that the American created the automobile in one of the 7 extra states!  The liberal media drooled all over themselves for a teleprompter speech, go figure.|`|q3Vo1s2caa	Facts don't matter to Obama supporter - only FEELINGS matter and Obama makes them all leg shakingly tingly.|`|48b84a8f546ab32d894f3370f4eca47faa	The man doesn't do well giving speeches, clear and simple.|`|B7qO5CsYaa	LOL GH  Good one!

He cannot fathom why we have to rebuild roads and bridges, advance volcano monitoring and such, and discontinue the 8 years of endless superrich tax cuts which is the cure-all solution of the GOP since 2000.|`|65755559ca83cd6ecbcfea0edf2b02bdaa	Please forgive governor Jindal.

Sadly, no matter what she wears or does not wear, it will be Vogue and will be lionized by the media.<br>  <br>  Let's hope that the women of this nation will stand firm and wear what THEY like as individuals and not be forced to follow the foolish whims of the media's fashion police.|`|1ksrcsYzaa	It revealed her hairy armpits|`|7HdgMaOnaa	I had my brother whip out the aed when I saw her jaw I dropped dead|`|36a3ynpJaa	She doesn't have bat wing arms like Hillary does.

POygTyTAaa	I agree with you.  What I have a problem with is that being a Muslim is considered a bad thing when we have the right to practice whatever religion we choose.   Hatred or prejudice against the Islamic religion is unpatriotic because it violates our bill of rights.  There are many Muslim Americans living in this country, and they are just as "American" as anyone else else.  I grew up in a Baptist Christian Church, and I do not consider myself a Christian.  Am I still consider a Christian even if I do not go to a Christian church, do not donate to the church, and I study and practice Buddhism?  I am from the south and married a man from Detroit, does that make me a southerner or a yankee?  <br>  <br>  also, chuck sounds like  as--hole.  He also has a stupid hat.|`|gQYIphZtaa	You  cannot be born into a belief, you have to actively profess your personal belief in its validity.<br>   These people do not know what they are talking about, one of the pillars of the Islamic faith is the sha'hadda. This is when you publically state that you believe that Allah is the one God and Muhammad is his last messenger, Then and only then are you a Muslim.Birth has nothing to do with this.|`|k5WdChc7aa	We say Obama is a Muslim because his father was a Muslim. And sharia law (Islamic religious law, sort of like the Christian/Catholic Ten Commandments) states that children born of a Muslim father are Muslims.<br>  <br>  Plus, he was registered as a Muslim in that school.|`|U6CF0Gh0aa	I agree with you. However, there seems to be a lot of conspiracy theorists on Y!A, so you'll see a lot of people on here who think that Obama is Muslim, the Antichrist, eats puppies for breakfast, etc.|`|9bgBIzjFaa	Obama sitting in a church of h8 for 20 years and being tone deaf doesn't make him a Xian.|`|ZP0Ez7RWaa	No but depending on type of moron you meet it could even mean you're a terorirst.|`|BfFI7TUsaa	TO ALL  DUMMIES THAT'S ALWAYS SITTING AROUND BAD MOUTHING MUSLIMS>>>YOU REALLY DON'T KNOW A DAMN ABOUT THEM !!!!!|`|ss0vy4tFaa	i will stand with the muslims<br>  <br>  obama said it himself|`|c85WWXV7aa	First off. just cause your from a Muslim country does not mean you are Muslim it is a religion right or wrong.<br>  And as for me I have a hard time believing a man is a christian when they have spent their whole life. In the Islamic faith. That's it end of story you can't be Islamic for your life then just cause you are running for office change your ideas and beliefs.|`|WYPEG8l7aa	Your comparing ideology with race that's just stupid.<br>  <br>  Ever wonder why Conservatives are still Conservatives even after they moved to liberal cities or vice versa? Don't you think it has something to do with the fact that they were RAISED with those teachings?<br>  <br>  If I get a California liberal and put him in Alaska do you what do you think his ideology would be? Would he turn into a Conservative or still believe in his liberal ideas?|`|SWkaGJpgaa	No. According to custom, however, if your father is a Muslim (women don't count in Islam) then you are Muslim by birth. This is a fact. I do not, and have not, claimed that Obama is a Muslim.<br>  <br>  Most Republicans know that Obama is Christian - he attended that black church of hatred and victimhood for 20 years.|`|bkav003oaa	No, depending on the country. Some Muslim countries have outlawed other religions and require all children to be given a Muslim education. <br>  <br>  Indonesia is not one of those countries, so Obama was not and never will be a Muslim. <br>  <br>  The Audacity of Hope quote is taken WAY out of context.|`|5zJmqpMPaa	From Audacity of Hope: "I will stand with the Muslims should the political winds shift in an ugly direction." <br>  <br>  Now, you tell me which side of his toast is buttered.|`|GfIwCC6saa	If it looks, smells and talks like a muslin. then it is a muslim.|`|Ac3UkTXYaa	My children were raised in Muslim countries and guess what ,none are Muslim.

ag8g4STpaa	I think its a great idea, the people who don't approve, don't do it. It will help generate money for the state and mind set might switch over to other parts of the country. Billions of dollars could be made, as well as having marijuana users out of jail, instantly saving money. Marijuana is the same as alcohol & tobacco in there own ways, its a choice. No known deaths caused by marijuana, yet millions due to alcohol and tobacco. Get rid of the Black Market!!|`|E6EbbZXzaa	I'm in favor of it. I don't think the government should protect us from ourselves.|`|5f52c5c3d1d0deab80192fb888e39e9aaa	I think it's a good idea. Marijuana is no more dangerous than alcohol, and therefore legality should be determined by each individual state.|`|T2JlDJD7aa	I don't live anywhere near CA but I'm dead against it. The state should not have to sink so low as to legalize a very dangerous drug to save their economy. I can't believe this has a 95% approval rating, it just means that 95% of CA citizens are pot smokers.

7tj1d2y5aa	Are you kidding? Republicans won't even admit that trickle down economics trickled our industries the hell out of here. You may get one who will say yes, he/she had a business that went belly up, but they'll never admit that they will take government assistance. Even though many of them are farmers. And, if one group of people, in this country, has received more government assistance, than farmers, I'd sure like to know who they are. Hell farmers have been being paid, by the government, NOT to grow crops for years now. And 99.9% of them are republicans who will swear on the Bible that they would never accept any government assistance.<br>  <br>  If you ever meet a farmer, be prepared to hear him poor mouth his business. He could be sitting in a brand new pickup truck, but he's gonna tell you how hard his life is. <br>  And make sure you keep one hand on your wallet while you're talking to him.|`|AA10284358	I;m sure there have been but i didn't see anyone with their hand out begging the gov. togive them outrages bailouts either. so they lived with their parents. alot of people do.

Black clothing, dressed like a ninja, ignoring the on coming car or whatever does not make a difference. <br>  Most states the pedestrian is in the right wherever they are, crossing not a a crosswalk, walking in the road, darting between cars.|`|B8khcpukaa	I would say it would all boil down to how severe the injuries were to the person, the statements given by witnesses, and any CCTV footage available.<br>  <br>  For example, if the pedestrian was paralysed from the head down, you would probably be the one at fault, because juries tend to side with the one they feel sorry for.  Having said that, if they simply jumped out in front of you, there was evidence to prove this, and you had a decent barrister, they would be the one at fault.<br>  <br>  I wouldn't want to put it to the test though!

The president and congress have made it unpopular to be successful.  There is a problem with this philosophy, however;  Nancy Pelosi, Harry Reid, Obama, and all the media and hollywood swooners are economically successful.  Does that mean they hate themselves...or are they exempt from their own loathing?  Don't be fooled America.  When you raise taxes on the richest 1-2% of the nation, you are effectively raising taxes on the individuals that depend on them for jobs (i.e. the lower and middle classes).  This is just a ploy to retain power.

M3maZgdyaa	From Wall Street to BO.<br>  <br>  Dear Mr. President,<br>  <br>  Unfortunately, it’s true. The stock market doesn’t like you. <br>  <br>  Only one month in and investors are giving up. Another 30% haircut would put the Dow at 5000.<br>  <br>  <br>  And that level wouldn’t just put a crimp into your presidency. The ensuing collapse in savings and the U.S. pension system would destroy it. <br>  <br>  Now, some advisers may tell you not to worry about the stock market. That it will take care of itself. But that’s wrong. Especially today.<br>  <br>  At its core, the market is a measure of belief — the belief that investors can make money by buying a slice of America.<br>  <br>  And a plummeting Dow means they really don’t believe in the country. Or in you.  <br>  <br>  You need to turn this around and fast. Here’s some advice:<br>  <br>  1. Channel Ronald Reagan, not Jimmy Carter<br>   <br>  Everybody knows the economy is lousy. Everybody gets your “underpromise, overdeliver” routine.<br>  <br>  But if the economy doesn’t come around in a year, you’re still “wearing it” as they say on Wall Street.<br>  <br>  You’re the #1 salesman of America’s hopes and dreams. Quit moaning and go out and sell some optimism.  <br>  <br>  2. Enough already with class warfare<br>  <br>  Make no mistake. All that populist anti-Wall Street rhetoric in Washington scares the heck out of investors. <br>  <br>  What good comes from your Press Secretary attacking CNBC’s Rick Santelli? It makes the White House look weak and out of touch with the markets.<br>  <br>  Maybe you are. How else could you have signed Senator Christopher Dodd’s executive pay amendment into law? <br>  <br>  Forget that the amendment is poorly drafted, vindictive public policy. It serves nobody’s interests but the politicians who sponsored it.<br>  <br>  Dennis K. Berman<br>  <br>  <br>  Tell Harry Reid, Nancy Pelosi and your own staff to turn down the volume on the “outrage of the people.”  The election is long over.<br>  <br>  3. Rule out bank nationalization — even if you haven’t completely ruled it out <br>  <br>  Tell your Treasury Secretary to immediately announce that the nationalization of Citi and Bank of America is off the table.<br>  <br>  With their shares worth so little and the government already backstopping them, this is largely a matter of semantics.<br>  <br>  If you have to revisit “full nationalization” over the next couple of months, so what?<br>  <br>  Secretary Geithner can say the situation has changed. And it will have. The situation changes every day.<br>  <br>  4.  Make peace with Wall Street<br>  <br>  Go to New York, press the flesh and put some confidence into the markets simply by showing up.<br>  Meet with the same eight bank CEOs that were bashed two weeks ago by Rep. Barney Frank and his House Committee. <br>  <br>  Scold them for the cameras and then declare that a healthy America needs a healthy Wall Street. <br>  <br>  Announce on the NYSE floor that the SEC is re-instating the “uptick rule” as a way to protect small “Main Street” investors.<br>  <br>  Wall Street will give you a hero’s welcome.<br>  <br>  5. Shelve liberal, Democrat pet bills<br>  <br>  Why are your fellow Democrats so keen to frighten US industry?  Are US companies not terrified enough nowadays?<br>  <br>  Show that you want American business to win. Put the kibosh on Henry Waxman’s efforts to undo the Supreme Courts’ limitations on suing medical device makers. <br>  <br>  And while you’re at it, call for an indefinite postponement of the Employee Free Choice Act, the anti-business union card check bill. That one’s a real stock market no-no.<br>  <br>  6. Get the bipartisanship thing going<br>  <br>  It made investors nervous that Senator Judd Gregg ditched you and that you could only come up with 3 Republican votes on the stimulus.  Let’s get that bipartisan thing going.<br>  <br>  Join with the Republicans and put GM into bankruptcy. That’s the endgame anyway. Might as well co-opt the Republicans and give yourself some political cover.<br>  <br>  Of course, none of these measures is a guarantee that the stock market will go up. And certainly, many in your party will cry Judas.<br>  <br>  But you urgently need to do something to shift investor sentiment. Dow 5000 is in nobody’s interest. Especially not yours.<br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/deals/2009/02/23/mean-street-obamas-dow-5000/" rel="nofollow">http://blogs.wsj.com/deals/2009/02/23/me...</a>|`|v7Wflu78aa	Historically, Democratic administrations produce more stock market growth than Republican administrations.  Looking at a month or two of the Dow is hardly indicative of anything.  Many statistics and metrics being reported are for economic activities of the last 3 or more months.  They are negative, and a drop in the Dow would be expected.<br>  <br>  Although, perhaps part of Wall Street's reaction is to the Republicans cutting some of the most efficient stimulus spending from the package?<br>  <br>  Uncertainty is a huge factor in the fall of stocks.  When more details and additional spending are announced, we might get a bounce.<br>  <br>  The tight credit market is having a ripple effect, which continues to hammer stocks.<br>  <br>  A short-run distaste for liberal policies could indeed by part of the decline.|`|tP8W6Q1Qaa	***Shaking the majic 8 ball***<br>  <br>   - Doubtfull|`|todJGCP8aa	No..its down because of the housing news that came out this morning.|`|lyhnHhuWaa	Why should they?  The decline in the market has been over a decade in the making and is the result of a series of policy decisions and events.  What you're seeing today is the panic driven reaction of a whole bunch of folks based on this series of policies/events that have led to a recession.  If you want to be taken seriously as a conservative, I recommend you read up and learn how the economy/market works before spouting off.  I'm guessing that you didn't pay a bit of attention to the market before the election.<br>  <br>  No, I'm not a liberal.  I'm a fiscal conservative with a brain.|`|6gZynUKzaa	no blame the market decline on bush because he allowed no regulation and obama is been president for a month so dont blame him the economy will rebound later this year or next year so u republicans need to help the democrats and not bicker|`|96e391ed38447964faf042cf980c1571aa	LOL... an Obamabot saying something that doesn't shower Obama with praise or love.

BdvGQAqhaa	Well to start ,He is not the savior of our world . God is and His Son Jesus Christ. Obama is the current Leader of our Nation, yes, but not our savior. Now as to why he is dogged so. Well partly because he is black,and the white people who are dogging him resent a black man in the office. Also because they are miserable and can't stand to see others happy and doing better than they are especially a black man of all people. This world is full of evil and racist unfortunately that is the way it is , wrong way to live ,but alot live as such.|`|g5nSbVzIaa	Because his ideas are in conflict with how we want this country to run.<br>  <br>  Obama is pushing big government with a 'government is the answer' attitude.  <br>  <br>  Conservatives small government with more reliance on the individuals instead of the government.<br>  <br>  Obama is not a Savior.  He is not God, and he is not the Messiah.  <br>  <br>  Obama hasn't even been in office 40 days (biblical reference intended) and you are declaring him the best President ever?

UvzKiis0aa	Jindal looks like he belongs in a terrorist training film in Pakistan. Will he produce his birth certificate that proves he was born here?  Neither of his parents were Americans and they sucked off the government teat to get what they have.  Smart and intelligent?  No, he acts just like your typical H1B suck up.<br>  <br>  Piyush Jindal looked wooden and spewed the same old GOP rhetoric about cutting taxes.  Louisiana has one of the highest unemployment rates and is one of the poorest states in the Union.  The only reason Piyush became governor was because many of the Democrats were flooded out of the state with the aftermath of Katrina.  I don't see any improvement with Jindal and he plans to take the money, just not the unemployment money because LA doesn't want to have to continue to pay unemployment when it runs out.  I bet the voters of LA will have something to say about him letting them starve for his own political gain.|`|MvC6n3DWaa	Did you hear a different speech? He did well, but I was not influenced.

His speech was so full of partisan self campaining mesh I couldn't digest it. Is he saying the Gov. should  not GIVE money for aid because thats a government take over.  He doesn't want any stimulus money because he says  Americans can work hard and are resilient. Will he help us out financially? Since his republican party is so concerned with government hand outs to tax payers will his rhetoric replace the money we need to feed our children. Trusting our health care in the private sector (unregulated without gov. based litigation which is designed to protect Americans from money sucking medicare predators).  We can see what will happen in privatized health care by looking at the Morgage Crisis.  Americans were given bate under unstable pretenses, Big wigs profited off of our naivity and ignorance and now Republicans blame us and tell us not to take money in our homeless, jobless and moneyless lives. Again, what do you have to offer us? This thing is bigger than "irresponsible people" preyed on by lender/brokers. This thing is bigger than "Handing out Welfare" which oldandnew republicans and demacrats are grateful for in these hard times. What do Jindal and his party think Wall Street is crying for...for Welfare money again and again. The second smart thing i heard on CNN was that it cost lets sat 3Million to repair the levees before Katrina trashed his state, now we have the backlash from years of NOT investing in our infrostructure that NOW cost us lets say 3Billion to clean up. Republicans are crying about the spending spending spending... the sore is bleeding so bad it takes more than just 2 bandaids. Whats worse is things we don't take care of now hurts us and become worse in the long run. Republicans seem to leave us as sitting ducks in a pool of sharks as they selfishly refuse the life line Jindal shouts "try swimming a little harder". He and any American who wouldn't take THEIR own money is like a FOOL.

When they are finished researching, the skull or entire skeleton can be cataloged and sent to another educational institution like a school.<br>  <br>  No, you can't buy one to mount on your bike/motorcycle (at least not without a ton of documents and getting pulled over by the cops all the time).|`|YAiKlPkMaa	Schools use cadaver corpses for anatomy, so yes, it's legal. People donate themselves.|`|AA10478980	Yes, I believe it is quite legal.  It is for educational purposes.|`|S4X8zOUoaa	Well if someone's selling them and that is legal then a school buying them is generally legal too.<br>  <br>  I think the laws about it vary, but animal skulls are generally perfectly legal to buy. I'm not sure about human skulls, though.|`|b8TgKnBwaa	Yes, but only to use them as decoration... <br>  <br>  I went to FIU, and I broke into the nursing school one night and went into the refridgerator, I counted 11 full cadavers. Im sure they have plenty more.|`|2MvdB6SJaa	yes cuz it's for educational purposes.|`|9oZduCMHaa	no it's not but they do it anyways cause they think they have the right
1c74cc7ee9876780e94d288d920e0d0aaa	No, unless you can PROVE nothing ever happened in any of those places, then you could get them for defamation of character or harassment., but good luck with that. You have what is probably called a Notice of Trespass against you, which only prevents them from entering their property, but nothing saying you can not be around the girl legally. At this point in time however I would rethink all of that.<br>  <br>  I am not answering on what I would do, he asked a question and I am answering form a legal point, not a personal point.|`|AA11995384	Technically you probably do since they are spreading malicious gossip but in reality, if you were to report them to the police, the police would probably simply advise them that this is not a sensible course of action (in other words give them a warning).  In any case you make it pretty clear that you did have sex so if you were to pursue this further, you might turn your girlfriend against you.<br>  <br>  I'd just leave it if I was you.|`|LJkPRqN0aa	if youve done these things its not harrassment and her parents have the right to protect their daughter as they see fit. you have no legal issue here its called reasonable doubt, and parents have the right to keep their children away from people they dont trust. sex is sex, even oral sex thats why its called ORAL SEX you cant change that it doesnt matter what you think she is their daughter and you cant do anything|`|ryjnt3dhaa	They can say anything they want as long as they don't make it public like putting it in the newspaper.  I assume you are both minors?  Her parents took out a restraining order on you which you have the right to contest in court.  However, you don't have a leg to stand on.  It is their daughter and the court will see them as trying to protect her from you.  I would advise against sneaking into her parents house at any time.  They could have you arrested or worse if they catch you in their home.  You are playing a dangerous game sneaking into any ones home.  They could legally shoot you.  By the way, "oral" is sex according to the law.<br>  <br>  Try to put yourself in her parent's place.  Imagine it was your daughter who's b/f was sneaking into your house late at night and having sex with your daughter.|`|AA11634870	Yes you have legal standing, you could ask your girl friend to have a gyno test for sexual activity if recent, but be warned you can only die once. Most fathers will have quite a few reasons to hurt you. So now the school the girls family and your family know of this whatever this is huh?  how did you manage to be so stupid and not expect this awkward situation to happen? go back to school apologize write a letter to her family with regrets and get on with your life before someone beats you up.|`|FeivZKiaaa	No, you are lucky they are not trying to charge you with breaking & entering or sexual assault.  <br>  <br>  I guess you are just to stupid to figure out that your actions could have caused your death. What it her father would have caught you on your way into the house and shot you as a burglar? <br>  <br>  I can't believe you are the self involved or are you just that stupid. <br>  <br>  I pray for your parents.|`|RjUhISEIaa	You are screwed and not by your g/f. You have no legal standing at all against them...none. <br>  <br>  Time to grow up just a little and try and understand what they are going thru due to your actions with their daughter. Your attitude here shows why they think this way too.
AA10118655	As long as they didn't get the list of the competitor's customers illegally, it should be fine in most states. There is also the issue of the Do Not Call list. If one of the competitor's customer's name is one the list, they can't call them unsolicited.
DcCECelaaa	As the news bureaus point out, Obama as a new President is at the height of his popularity right now if the popularity patterns of past Presidents are to be taken as an object-lesson.  Today you may have some people professing that yes, they voted for him before and would vote for him again if the vote were taken today.<br>  <br>  But the other shoe has not dropped with regard to what the $787 Billion Stimulus ("Spending" / "Porkulus", whatever) Bill is going to do (or not do, i.e. create sufficient jobs) to our economy and our future.<br>  <br>  I sense your question might be more interesting to compare to past Nov. 4, 2008 voting records IN A FEW MONTHS than right now, simply because Obama is still surfing his wave of popularity.  I sense you may be looking to see how many Obama-voters NOW feel the same way as they did last November.<br>  <br>  My sense is that the majority of those who voted for Obama are still sticking with their original vote, despite the blinding fact that he has blatantly LIED to the American people in his campaign promises of 5 days of transparency posting significant bills on internet for comment BEFORE the vote is taken (and not AFTER, as he is doing now).  He ran on the campaign promise of HOPE, yet in his first month casts shadows of GLOOM and DOOM ("Catastrophe" I believe was his word) if his Spending Bill wasn't passed.  He made promises of BI-PARTISAN legislation, yet with his first big bill, didn't even give Congressmen 24 hours to read the 1000-page Behemoth before banging the gong for a vote.  So he got only 3 derelict Republicans to vote yes on his bill, and that sure doesn't look like Bi-Partisan legislation and certainly not Bi-Partisan process.  He RAILROADED the thing.  It was a CRAM DOWN.  And we, the American tax-payers, are ultimately the ones who got STUFFED.<br>  <br>  So in answer to your question, I didn't vote for him before because I saw him for his dishonesty, false promises, and many connections with multiple shady characters.  I feel VINDICATED now that within his first 30 days, what we predicted about him (he is a liar and a charlatan who will promise anything to get elected) is coming true.  So NO...I would not vote for him today either.<br>  <br>  And I'm sorry, he did not "inherit" the deficit because no-one died leaving him as Boss.  He APPLIED for the job, he COMPETED for it, he WANTED it, so now his moaning about it just shows what kind of an irresponsible, blame-shifting supposed "leader" he really is.  Remember "The Buck Stops Here?" --  Not with Obama.  He will buck IT ALL.  Mark my words and I just hope more Americans begin to wake up and realize what is unfolding right before their very eyes.|`|H7ENkTxaaa	No, I would wait to see who the Republican candidate is.<br>  <br>  I really wish that there would be at least one more political party.|`|9HRkwzruaa	Pffftt...are you kidding?  I didn't vote for him the first time, and after the crap he's pulled so far, not many others will either.|`|25faf33e24f40cd4a39b1314c62123a4aa	Hell, I didn't vote for him the first time and all I see is him making things worse. So that would be a BIG no for me.|`|4pHTkTUaaa	Didn't and won't.|`|nlj7sk5uaa	He cant run a country as it is, what would make me vote for him for a second term?

Goes to the same mosque as Barack Obama.|`|RermzbWgaa	He was born Hindu, but is a converted Roman Catholic (since high school).|`|7y6yfrQlaa	no i heard he worships ganesh but thanks for this information|`|bb5a54df57374dc4de372500ff862a7daa	Actually, Jindal's family were Hindu's, not Muslim.  Bobby Jindal converted to Christianity.  <br>  <br>  The factor that will say whether of not he is in fact a Christian, will be his actions.  Christian to to many is a label that means nothing to them.  A real Christian is one who actually obeys God's law and respects and loves God.  They show this in their morals and values.<br>  <br>  I know, I kow, cheap shot at rebuking the Obama claim to be Muslim.  Doesn't fit though.  You have the wrong religion and so do articles.  Jindal conceded his former beliefs himself - without having to do a song and dance before the truth came out.  <br>  <br>  BTW - I don't think Obama is a Muslim, but I don't think he is a Christian either.  He has done to much to show the opposite.  I think Obama falls into the category of a labeled Christian - self proclaimed.  In the long run, it will mean nothing.|`|27sSI5wxaa	I don't know that.<br>  <br>  But what I do know is that is was a practicing Hindu until he decided to get involved in politics.<br>  <br>  Then he became a Christian.|`|ZP0Ez7RWaa	Yup, then he became a Catholic which is an equally bullsh*t religion.<br>  <br>  OH MY GOD HE WAS MUSLIM!! HE A SECRET TERRORIST!<br>  <br>  dude, whatever|`|8SdnCGxIaa	At least he was born in America and we know where his loyalties are!<br>  can't say the same about BHO<br>  Bobby is waaaaaaaaaaaaay smarter and more qualified that Mr. Transparency|`|yjBPsN90aa	Who cares, he's not a communist that believes in Lenin, so he's ok by me.|`|vwYbFtkqaa	I thought he was a Hindu, you know the people who believe in and live by the caste system. Very appropriate for a Republican.|`|AA11450062	Wikapeda says he is Roman Catholic.|`|Cn1tSHLpaa	It doesn't really matter what religion he is...he's a joke.|`|SEwG8Yl4aa	Wrong.  He was a Hindu.  He converted to Catholicism in High School.|`|ceac5e1af44045f0a37db88050efe019aa	Actually, he is Catholic. If you think Louisianans would vote for a Muslim or a Hindu, you have never visited that great state.|`|Wt01utSbaa	WHAT! OH NO! A terrorist! A Muslim is ALWAYS a terrorist.<br>  <br>  <br>  I'm going to freak out, and harp on this day in and day out just like my Republicans friends did for 12 straight months!|`|fAp3YMfmaa	Islam will rise in the name of the Republican party!<br>  <br>  Allah!

Of course, voters with limited intellect explains why the Democrats are in power...|`|dHjya1Yoaa	People are entitled to their opinions... if you don't like that opinion then don't pay heed to it... Now even you must admit that there is something about that man that would allow him to be on talk radio since the repeal of the Fairness doctrine... Personally, I find him dull and repetative... but I know he does make some good points too.. And I have to wonder just what cords he has hit amongst the liberals and the democrats to have them in an uproar over him... He must have said somethings that are truthful and stung the American Left....
yB0fWb1Uaa	Its not going to work its going to be worse!!  Ask England and Canada.  First off the President is going to mandate all medical records are computerized.  Then he will appoint a Federal Council to review approve or deny  treatments.  How this will work:  Computerized records that council will look into your records and based on a formula = the cost of the treatment divided by the # of years that patient will benefit for approval of that treatment.  page 464 of the current stimulus package just signed.  So another wards if your fat overweight and need a knee replacement dream on DENIED!!!<br>  <br>  People we already have the best Health Care in the World!  Cutting edge research Gifted Doctors willing to go the extra mile for their patients.  I say we clean it up cutting out Illegals It is a huge problem with all of our systems.  If you are not an American Citizen why are you here draining our systems?  Go back home!  End of story!<br>  <br>  Our Country spends more on Illegals per year than the entire War cost us!  Why??  Go home back to your Country!  Dont come to this Country waving your Country's flag speaking only your lang feeding off of us!|`|Souvww0maa	If Obama was for people running blindly into a woodchipper, the democrats would support it whole heartedy and rage against anyone who through shear exercise of common sense decided it was a very bad plan.|`|25faf33e24f40cd4a39b1314c62123a4aa	Universal health care will be a big mistake. How do people think this will be payed for. The government does not give it for nothing, Taxes will go up and up and up. Look at Europe and Canada they have high taxes to cover it. People will suffer because along with universal comes low quality health care. If people think they have it bad now with insurance companies butting in and denying certain procedures just wait until the government can step in and tell your doctor what he can and can't do. People wake up!|`|e5229cd398fab1a52d67a832b2db54c1aa	Because he has a comprehensive Health Care plan, and it covers all Americans not just those born with silver spoons in their mouths.<br>  <br>  Here's the link.<br>  <br>  .|`|Rh5b4R5Iaa	Hey, they were behind the "stimulus bill" when there wasn't one.|`|4pHTkTUaaa	Because they buy into whatever he says....so if he says there will be one they already believe it is the best thing.

Any country in history actually.  And we have near the worst education system in the western world.<br>  <br>  Obama said, last night that we shouldn't give money to the auto industry and support the poor decisions they have made over the past decades.

He told the Swiss bank UBS to either open up their books and show him every American Client or he will basically stop all trades, etc..with the Swiss. 1000 years of secrecy is gone... The Swiss had no option but to crumble and do as he said. This will collapse their banking empire and the Swiss Franc is going to have to go bye bye and the Euro will have to be adopted.

An extremely unpopular Republican president has just left office and a Democrat president was voted in by an overwhelming majority of Americans to replace him. Obviously, it is much too soon to be predicting the downfall of the Republican party, especially when they still hold around 40% of the Senate and 178 of 430 seats in the House. Students of history remember how the Republican party began: it would be the height of irony if Republicans went the way of the Whigs.

There was a Spending Bill, sure, but there's no impact for months & months.  The giddy-ness of the media having the Executive & legislative branches ALL their own.. is feeding the nonsense of saying how GOPers, etc. are some kind of cancer, etc. -- when, in fact, there will be NOTHING DONE. Across neither Healthcare, Economy nor Education -- nothing but talk. And in 2 years, fingerpointing when the Dems lose a ton of incumbents for the PORK spending.<br>  <br>  You're watching a 1-termer. No matter the excuses over his last 2 years -- he's done. He's a poser. The Dems and the media LOVES him to pieces, but Americans in general are learning more & more about him & know when they're being BS'd (or, as Dems like to say self-lauding.. "finessed"). <br>  <br>  The Dem media from Rachel Maddow to Bill Maher to David Letterman, back to CNN and the NY Times.. thinks the more they shovel-it -- the more they bury the GOP. But, it's the ONLY voice of OPPOSITION, now. That's the way it goes. This is the reason why people voted for Obama -- and would have voted for a POTTED PLANT really running vs. the GOP in 2008. But, over time.. you realize how much BS can flow, from a slick package of a President that really has no idea what he's doing, but thinks "image is everything". Sean Penn likes an eloquent president, and that's nice -- I like one that can roll up his sleeves and PRODUCE. <br>  <br>  For the same reasons we think there's no sharks in the water. <br>  <br>  Keep wallowing around & getting fat (on pork), and you'll see what happens.|`|PhTQn6ycaa	The republican party is temporarily irrelevant, just like the democratic party was in 2001.

I think it is good that people listen to the President but be more proactive in understanding what is being said between the lines.  There's no surprise that a politician will sugar coat, exaggerate and even stretch facts in order to gain support.  I was listening to the speech last night and noticed several discrepancies just from the information that I have been researching about this stimulus package.  Just because a President sounds good and comes off as sincere does not mean that he is being honest.

For example, I know Texas (and even the city I work for) is going to lobby for some stimulus money because our sales tax revenue is down and we don't have an income tax... but I think we are going to pick and choose what we need vs. just taking it all with strings attached.

5ba80eaa27ef01651d328d5caff2a3a0aa	It was a great answer. It reminded me of the quote by a Native American: "We didn't land on Plymouth Rock, Plymouth Rock landed on us."  I have always been sympathetic to the cause of Israel, but in order to give the Jews a homeland we( world powers) have had to uproot the lives of countless thousands of Palestinians whose only crime was to be in the wrong place. It is a little bit like living in the path of a new highway that is being built.  I watched a PBS show years ago that focused on the Palestinian situation in Israel, and how it affected their daily lives. One older couple who had built their own home and raised their family in it, had to move out so that a Jewish family could move in. A woman who needed to see an eye doctor was not able to because her doctor lived in a part of Jesusalem that she was not permitted to enter by Israeli soldiers. There have been a number of such injustices that the Palestinians have had to endure. I can understand their hate and bitterness, but still, I support Israel's right to exist.

Certainly some are, but just as certainly many aren't and most fall somewhere in between the two extremes.  Franklin Roosevelt certainly was 'rich', but just as certainly his heart was with the working class.  So much so that he was called a 'traitor to his class.  In turn he called many of of the people IN his class 'economic royalists'.  The Kennedys' certainly have been on the side of the American wage-earner.  So much so that the current Kennedy, Ted, has been called the 'most liberal man in the US Senate'.  Of course they called President Obama that when he was running in the last election so its not always easy to tell who's 'the most'.  John Kerry has been a supporter of the working class for his entire career.  He got royally reamed for that when he ran for president, and the Rockefellers, both the democratic ones and the republican ones, never let their money interfer with their sense of social justice. The Clintons' didn't start out 'rich' and they both seem to remember where they came from.  In fact, Bill Clinton has been called 'trailer trash' by some of the right wing talk show dummies, proving, at least to a lot of people, that he's.....one of us!  Good for him! Right now, all of us 'working class' Americans, and that's 95% of the US population, need all the help we can get.  If the multi-millionaires in government want to lend a hand, good for them.  We'll know who they are and we'll reward or punish them at the polls.  I'd let this one go.  We're all pretty much in the same boat, and the boat is sinking.  Let's play fair.

Cromwell became convinced that if he could produce a well-disciplined army he could defeat Prince Rupert and his Cavaliers<br>  <br>  Cromwell trained his cavalry to keep together after a charge. In this way his men could repeatedly charge the Cavaliers. Cromwell's new cavalry took part in its first major battle at Marston Moor in Yorkshire in July 1644. The king's soldiers were heavily defeated in the battle. Cromwell's soldiers became known as the Ironsides because of the way they cut through the Cavaliers on the battlefield.<br>  <br>  The Parliamentary forces were also able to capture the Royalist baggage train that contained his complete stock of guns and ammunition. <br>  <br>  The Battle of Naseby was the turning point in the war.

2496ba022fe646c69a3703b777537b91aa	Je n'aime pas beaucoup cette décision qui risque d'en faire un martyr pour une partie de la population (celle qui le soutient encore) et cela risque de relancer les hostilités de plus belle et aussi de réactiver cette haine entre les deux "types" de population de l'Irak.<br>  Oui, bien s?r, George Bush doit se sentir conforté dans sa position. Il a déclaré que cela prouvait que l'Irak avait enfin sa propre justice, pour moi, il s'agit de la justice américaine et nulle autre.<br>  Bien s?r comme je l'ai mentionné ci-dessus, cela va alimenter les conflits entre les deux types d'Irakiens, ceux qui soutiennent encore le dictateur et les autres.<br>  Je n'ai pas entendu toutes les réactions mais j'ai été choquée de mon premier ministre Verhofstaad qui n'a rien trouvé de mieux à dire que "c'est une bonne chose malgré l'avis de l'Europe en ce qui concerne la peine de mort !" ... pas très fière d'être belge quand mon représentant va déclarer une chose pareille !!!<br>  Je pense aussi que la peine de mort ne doit plus être appliquée. La loi du talion divise au lieu de renforcer le peuple. Même si Saddam Husse?n fut un dictateur et un génocidaire, on a pas tuer Milosévich ni Pinochet !!! Et personnellement, je pense qu'être privé de sa liberté est bien plus difficile à supporter (car cela dure et dure) que la peine de mort... d'autant plus que son exécution ferait de lui un martyr pour ceux qui le soutenait et un véritable "culte" pourrait lui être dédié... (anniversaire de telle décision, de sa mort, de sa naissance, de sa prise de pouvoir, ...)<br>  Alors que vivant, cela certes décevrait une grande partie de la population mais empêcherait tout débordement de la part de l'autre partie de celle-ci.

6ca4e1796a3f38e95221b75da25194e4aa	Mi sembrano filmati alquanto poco chiari e tendenziosi. Non c'è neppure un fotogramma chiaro, dove si possa evincere con certezza che il neo c'è o non c'è e si cerca di suggestionare lo spettatore con scritte "assente" o con freccette che in alcuni casi vanno a coprire addirittura il punto dove ci dovrebbe essere il neo. Ci sono poi delle contraddizioni palesi del commentatore, ad esempio quando dice che le armi agli iracheni sono state vendute dagli americano, mentre sappiamo benissimo che sono state vendute anche dai russi e dagli europei. Altra contraddizione quando insiste sul fatto che Saddam non ha mai parlato male degli americani: a parte il fatto che il commentatore sembrava deluso, ma era obbligato a farlo? Ed oltretutto in più di una occasione ha manifestato il suo dissenso contro gli oppressori e gli invasori....e chi erano questi....forse i cinesi?<br>  Ennesima contraddizione sul nodo: si vuol far credere a chi assiste che la morte avviene per "soffocamento", mentre in realtà la morte sopraggiunge per la rottura dell'osso del collo e quindi le dimensioni del nodo non incidono: in più di una occasione poi la fuoriuscita di sangue è normale.

La giustizia e la democrazia americana ci hanno insegnato che la guerra preventiva genera solo odio e torture.

Helping banks by the way, and businesses does help the average citizen, that's where they go for jobs and loans to build their own businesses and car and home loans too.<br>  <br>  Next time listen, sticking you head in the sand is never a good way to form a logical opinion, and you won't worry about hearing "I am superman", at least not from Obama|`|Wt01utSbaa	Oh yeah.<br>  <br>  By not watching it you can keep your head in the sand and be completely unable to make informed decisions!<br>  <br>  In fact, what gives you the right to make judgements and predictions about this country if you don't pay attention?<br>  <br>  Typical to the Republican party, ignore the facts and give us the personal commentary...

He has always said that he knows the situation is dire and that he has concrete ideas about how to fix things. That's what being a politician is. Coming up with ideas to fix the problems in a society. EVERY politician says that because...that's what politicians do. The stimulus does provide help to the ordinary citizen, much more so than the Bush economic "stimulus" plan, which was just an excuse to give rich people more money. The Obama stimulus package was passed less than a week ago and has yet to gain traction, these things take time. <br>  <br>  To answer your question, no, ignoring the political rhetoric is not a good way to keep yourself informed of public policy. It is, however, a good way to keep yourself completely out of touch with the political climate in this country and holding on to your beliefs that are founded somewhere outside reality. If you are worried that Obama's speech would have swayed you to agree with him, then you obviously don't agree with the political beliefs you currently hold. Don't be afraid of changing your mind. <br>  <br>  As an aside, you have no idea what Obama's stimulus plan is about. The Bush plan was to bail out the banks instead of addressing the more pressing issue of stabilizing the housing market. Not one dollar of the Obama plan has been put to work yet, so you don't know whether it will be effective.|`|tQOhM5gWaa	I think by not watching any of his speeches, you're keeping yourself from knowing your opponent.<br>  If you're truly against our president, then you must study things for yourself, and not base your opinion on what others have told you what he says! =]

Yeah, well, slam into the rear of one o' them and the gas tank explodes, then the car, including the engine, becomes 'combustible.'<br>  <br>  Lookie here, I know that you meant the 'internal combustion engine' but before you slam someone else on a minor error, check out your own stuff first.<br>  <br>  What you heard last night --, I mean, what you heard from someone who thought they heard the speech?-- was a clear message, presented positively, of how we, as a nation, can and will take positive steps to get us out of GWBush's morass of fear-mongering and a collapsing economy. Trust me, very few people last night were fondly reminiscing about Dubya's sideways leer that always reminded of that snake-oil salesman in "The Outlaw Josie Wales," speciifically the scene where the salesman offers a bottle of it to Chief Dan George, after having made numerous spurious claims as to its efficacy in treating a wide range of ills including gout, gas, acne, halitosis, bunions, pyorrhea, conjunctivitis, hemorrhoids, hernias and blue-balls... the Chief asks the salesman "What's in it?" and when the salesman blusters and flusters and then says "I only sell it, I don't  know," to which Chief replies: "Then YOU drink it!!"|`|AA11828439	Therein lies the problem. For someone to report what they HEARD was said as fact, leads to idiotic assertions with no basis in fact. By the way, there is no such thing as a "combustible" engine.

69e786b3fb2c0d4117bea4fdf02537a9aa	The country of Germany was in economic turmoil at the time of Hitler's rise to power.  He was great because he instilled pride back into the German people, which most Germans will tell you.   He was a magnificent speaker.   If he had just kicked the Jews out and concentrated on his own borders, he might have gone down as one of the most beloved leaders of all time.  He became power hungry, which led to his demise.  As a result of his actions, he will always be known as an evil person.|`|bb16cba11af5ed8cfcb5870eedd8a276aa	I think the best leader the world has ever choosen in modern age is Hitler the great.<br>  The way he managed to clean the area from zionist regime was wonderful. i am hoping the middle east also needs a leader like this.

Their moral relativism is still much loved throughout the west. Their disdain for all things religious outside of their Pagan/Atlantan/Space alien cult has been all the rage among the elite left. As for mass killings, we're way past that with abortion, state assisted suicide and the notion that Ebola and bird flu combined might be just the thing to relieve Mother Gia of the burden of so many unnecessary humans. So, which right idea was that?|`|e0aef802081111860f368a01515ab29baa	What 'idea' do you refer to?  You don't want mass killings so I am assuming its not the holocaust. National Socialism?  Lebensraum?   You misunderstand the history involved. The pleading of England did not get us involved in WW2, all it got them (and the USSR) was the Lend-Lease plan. The American public was extremely isolationist at that time and Roosevelt could not feasibly get America actively involved. Even after Pearl Harbor, we only declared war on Japan... Hitler then did a really stupid thing and declared war on the US 3 days later. Without that declaration we STILL would not have been militarily involved in Europe.  Hitler was a charismatic mentally twisted thug who made the Germans feel good about themselves after the Treaty of Versailles drove the country into economic chaos. He was no military leader (Thank God or whichever Deity floats your boat) because Germany damn near won that war despite his numerous serious miscalculations. Even as late as D-Day Germany stood a chance for a political way out of the war, if only Hitler had believed Rommel when he told him the invasion they had expected was at Normandy.  Rommel pleaded for the release of two entire Panzer divisions located at Calais, Hitler refused. Had those two tank divisions been unleashed on the beachead at Normandy the outcome would have been an extremely bloody loss for the allies.

In the global sense 'liberalism' adheres to a smaller government, no intrusion, free market economics etc. Check it out - Adam Smith is famous for it, 'Wealth of Nations' is an excellent book if you can find it. <br>  <br>  The US political scene is happy to use terms to label everything. Obama is not a socialist, for example. He has given millions of dollars to big corporations. In this sense, the term liberal would apply to left-wing politics. Obama is basically a left-leaning centrist, bearing in mind that the whole American political spectrum is shifted further to the right than anywhere else in the world. If you want to live free in pursuit of liberty & happiness, there is nothing wrong with adhering to a the liberal model put forward by Smith, Locke and the Founding Fathers.|`|R0LM9Hy8aa	The biggest danger in leftwing thought is their enormous sense of being superior. A perfect example is our shiny new foreign policy in which we will "dialogue" with the murderous regimes of the middle east and show them the error of their ways.

They are so convinced they are right they can't see the reality that every single bunch of leftists from Mao and Stalin to Bill Ayers and Barack Obama have felt that same sense of self-righteousness.<br>  <br>  Liberals are actually very limited people which is why they are so desperate to limit you.

LIBS believe it is OK to snuff out innocent unborn life via abortion but that capital punishment (taking the life of a condemned first degree murderer) is wrong.

I don't agree wholeheartedly with Coulter for example with respect to Islam and her quote after 9/11 that we should invade Islamic countries and convert the Muslims to Christianity - obviously I don't agree with that.    But I'll recognize that she was unafraid to reference the undeniable connection between fundamental Islamic tenets, written in black and white in the Qur'an and Hadiths, and the conduct of the terrorists who literally interpret those tenets.   They behead infidels because the Qur'an says to behead unbelievers.    It doesn't have to be interpreted literally but it does say that, and pretending that it doesn't or that there's some unspoken but obvious context like in Issa's haikus is not only silly but allows the terrorists to claim that theirs is the true faith.<br>  <br>  As for O'Donnell's sexuality, that's probably the only plus - I can identify with her love for that part of the female body.|`|JKtw7nFMaa	I think that they are both dumb Cu**s that have zero capability to think logically <br>  <br>  I also think your an idiot for asking such a stupid question... who cares what two talking heads on your TV think.

The tragedy is that price controls are only effective if they control and limit the supply of services. In time, that means waiting lists and other barriers to accessing care, along with skyrocketing costs to the taxpayer. That’s the true bottom line of the Obama plan. <br>  <br>  today’s dominant employment-based system of private insurance. This is reassuring to those millions of voters who see the need for reform but are generally satisfied with the coverage they get today. Unfortunately, the Obama spin is nothing more than that. In truth, the Obama plan would sow the seeds of destruction for private health insurance, whether provided by employers or offered on the open market. <br>  <br>  Fortunately, voters will not have to rely exclusively on information from a swooning press corps and the Obama propagandists for the duration of the coming campaign. There are, and will be, more rigorous assessments by outsiders of what the Obama plan would really mean, financially and otherwise. Indeed, a partial assessment of an Obama-like plan is already available - financed by an Obama ally, no less. Tellingly, even it points to the inescapable bottom line: Obama’s plan would put the country on an irreversible fast-track to government-run health care for everyone.|`|Nkwv2hygaa	Because "government-run" healthcare doesn't always work.

The audacity of Obama's rhetoric is amazing, somehow a tax cut for 95% of Americans' turned into the re-introduction of welfare. Using the same technique Obama will attempt a stealth takeover of the health care system. It will start with "health care reform" and a promise to let you keep your current insurance. In the following excerpt from Human Events Tony Blankley, commenting on Tom Daschle's book, explains how "19 words would spell the end of independent private-sector health care in America."<br>  <br>      On Page 179, he writes, "The Federal Health Board wouldn't be a regulatory agency, but its recommendations would have teeth because all federal health programs would have to abide by them." But here is the kicker: Although his board technically would have no say on the 68 percent of health care that is provided through the private sector, at the bottom of Page 179, Daschle modestly adds: "Congress could opt to go further with the Board's recommendations. It could, for example, link the tax exclusion for health insurance to insurance that complies with the Board's recommendation."<br>  <br>      Those last 19 words would spell the end of independent private-sector health care in America. Obviously, no health insurance would be sold if it were denied the tax deduction. Thus, every policy, every standard decided by this board would be the law of the land for every drug company, every hospital, every doctor and every health insurance company.<br>  <br>      Indeed, 20 pages later, in the section in which he identifies "losers" under his plan, Daschle is admirably candid. Among the explicit "losers,” he includes: "Doctors and patients might resent any encroachment on their ability to choose certain treatments, even if they are expensive or ineffectual compared to alternatives. Some insurers might object to new rules that restrict their coverage decisions. And the health-care industry would have to reconsider its business plan (emphasis added)." That is to say, they can stay in business and deliver their services, but only as the government bureaucrats say they may. They no longer would be genuinely independent.<br>  <br>  <br>  Say goodbye to freedom of choice, the government bureaucrats will now decide what treatment your doctor will be allowed to give you.<br>  <br>  In fact we are already part way down the road to universal health care, The Dems are working from the margins. Congress recently reauthorized SCHIP and now allows some states to cover adults under this "children's" program and now there is talk of letting those 55 years of age opt into medicare. It won't be long before every age group will be looking to the government for health care and then it will be too late.|`|96e391ed38447964faf042cf980c1571aa	What is single payer, but goverment run healthcare?  His healthcare plan is currently in use in the UK.

Sure rich people can have their own insurance, just like they can in Obama's plan... lets seperate the classes a little more over here why don't we?  A goverment (or single payer plan) would allow companies to stop offering plans (which is how the majority of Americans get health insurance and if you believe they won't you are a fool) since they will be carrrying the burden of the single payer plan, which would send more peole onto the goverments plan than are currently on it.

It's all been done and has a 100% track-record of driving-up cost and reducing access.<br>  <br>  Places with similar plans have people dying waiting for operations even if they can PAY. Simply seeking service on your own is a CRIME and this feature is so far the ONLY part of the Obama plan already in law, awaiting the bureaucratic infrastructure before being implemented. (it's in the "stimulus package.")<br>  <br>  Further, it would be a criminal enterprise. The Federal Government has no lawful authority to do any such thing. Moving beyond that, it's immoral for government to vest YOUR health-care choices in a 3rd party unknown to you or your chosen provider. Moving beyond even that . . . it's been DONE every-which way you can think of and ALWAYS makes things worse.<br>  <br>  Cuba's head of state had to get FOREIGN care for a bowel resection. You can get that done in a poverty-stricken Appalachian clinic, for the love of God. Canadians leave the country, go to prison and/or DIE waiting for procedures we get in less than an hour after their need is discerned. Of course, if your vet says your DOG needs something similar, Canadians can get THAT done same-day since the government doesn't "provide free" veterinary care.<br>  <br>  I can tell you first-hand VA hospitals indeed suck but NO other government system anywhere in the world is as good as they are. If we get the Democrat health plan, you will be jealous of VA care.|`|6b6ff719959d29a5aa770465d592c901aa	My simple viewpoint is that government should have no role in things that can be done without the goverment. You indicate that "obama health care plan" is not "government ran health care". My viewpoint is that if the feds or state have a "plan" they are involved in it, which I dont want. As  to why I dislike govt health care - costs, taxes and it doesnt work. As my first witness I would call my sster whom lives in Canada. Wont need to travel since she is in states every 6 months to see her doctor. Its now about 4 years since Canada told her she was terminal and untreatable, so no more visits.|`|DypTl9Zdaa	As of now I really don't know what his plan is.  During the speech last night it didn't sound as if he was particularly leaning toward a universal health care but that's what many of us have been expecting.  He said that it was going to be a tough chore figuring out how to make things better and he said he would have a panel of doctors, nurses, republicans and democrats in order to find out how to make things better.  This does sound rather optimistic to those of us who are not interested in universal health care.  I will wait and see what happens before I judge Obama for this.  If a universal health care plan does come about it will be a disaster so I suggest that we all hope otherwise.  If you need facts on that then you can do research on Canada.  Theirs is not working so well.  Anyway, thus far we really have no real facts on what is going to happen so I can't argue with you on an intelligent level.  <br>  <br>  One thing I can say is that billions of dollars (tax payers dollars I might add) are going to more medicaid, welfare and monies to people who are too dependent on government.  That is a real problem for me because our government already spends too much money on this.|`|FpMCFvV5aa	To start with, It gives health care to people who have no legal right to be in this country.

It is Government run Health Care!  What do you think the Federal Council is?  Who do you think will be approving your care Doctors??  Please Try the Federal Council!

Try this out for size that Federal Council looks at the cost of the proceedure and has a formula that divides the cost of the treatment by the number of years that patient will benefit from that treatment in order to approve that treatment.

The reason for this is that they CAN'T POSSIBLY pay for all the health care that everyone WANTS, therefore, THEY will decide what they think you need.  If grandma is over a certain age, they will say, her life expectancy is shorter than that younger person that needs the care, so grandma can't get it.<br>  <br>  3) In order to PAY for all the people that don't work, welfare suckers, illegals, students, elderly, etc.  They will have to RAISE taxes even more on those of us who do...

baa8285ac363d839e94ceb0ab0dd8450aa	He can possibly sue for Defamation of Character|`|AA10178603	Now that you've gotten 3 or 4 answers that are based on pure speculation, you get an answer from a real attorney.  Nearly every state has adopted something called the "litigation privilege".  Reported crimes is basically a form of protected speech.  It is nearly impossible to recover for defamation connected with the reporting of a crime.<br>  <br>  You have possible theories for recovery: (1) malicious prosecution; and (2) abuse of process.  A claim for malicious prosecution usually involves the following elements:  (1) intentionally (and maliciously) instituting or pursuing (or causing to be instituted or pursued) a legal action (civil or criminal) that is (2) brought without probable cause and (3) dismissed in favor of the victim of the malicious prosecution.  Besides being very difficult to prove, the fact that the prosecutor decided to even FILE the charges indicates the existence of probable cause.  Criminal cases are dismissed or settled all the time for lack of evidence.  Lack of evidence doesn't mean innocence.<br>  <br>  Abuse of process usually involves the malicious and deliberate misuse of regularly issued court process (civil or criminal) not justified by the underlying legal action.  I don't see any facts here to support this claim.<br>  <br>  As with answer answer you receive in this forum, the laws of our state may vary and you always should consult a local attorney.|`|AA11985760	You can sue for just about anything in this country, so yes. However, slander is very hard to prove. You will need proof that the accusations were not only false, but made with harmful intent. Then you will need to prove that it damaged your husband's reputation in a way that either affected his livelihood or his emotional well-being. <br>  Many lawyers will offer a free consultation, so if you want to go this route, you should seek out an attorney. Just know that the fees and court costs will be pretty high, it will take quite a bit of time, and the odds are not favorable unless you can prove the above.<br>  It's one of those things that you have to decide if it's worth the hassle, or if you're better off letting it go and moving on.<br>  Good luck!|`|416a1305a7e1e1e514880ff731a32b18aa	Read this then go to an attorney for advice.

82330ec6a4e338fdb69b9b5f5371982baa	L'opposizione si rivolta a Prodi perchè è l'opposizione! E' normale che ci siano critiche continue è il gioco della politica. Ora, penso che rispetto agli altri anni la critica sia più ampia per più motivi:<br>  <br>  1) All'opposizione c'è coluti che detiene 3 canali televisivi tra i più importanti, ma anche altri media quali radio e web. E' logico che questi siano chi in modo più diretto e chi no a favore di chi gli paga la pagnotta.<br>  <br>  2) Il Governo Prodi in fase pre-elezioni doveva essere più chiaro, ma anche dopo nel dire: "Ragazzi, ci dobbiamo rimboccare tutti le maniche all'inizio, perchè stiamo toccando Terra, a fine del mio mandato vedrete che le cose saranno migliori!". Invece No, mi pare che si siano troppo soffermati a fare i petti gonfiati come quelli di Destra.<br>  <br>  3) L'aumento delle tasse c'è stato e l'opposizione fa leva su questo perchè è il mal che tutti vedono, questa campagna pubblicitaria negativa fatta dall'opposizione ahinoi colpirà proprio coloro che sono di bassa cultura e gli indecisi (..e anche coloro che non segue la politica e capisce 0 di come gira l'economia)<br>  <br>  4) Al nostro Governo ci sono persone molto valide e si stanno vedendo i frutti. Purtroppo Prodi, pur essendo un ottimo lavoratore (molto di più di tanti politici) non ha un'immagine dirompente come colui che lo combatte. <br>  E' vero Prodi si è migliorato nella dialettica e sembra molto più sicuro rispetto agli anni passati, ma di faccia sembra sempre l'orso buono e tranquillo (a volte sonnolento). Il capo dell'opposizione invece è tutta immagine, ha un team che lo gestisce e che gli trova la retorica migliore per colpire il popolo, è anche un buon oratore.<br>  <br>  Purtroppo in politica (ci insegna il passato) è importante più l'arte oratoria che altro e Prodi e il suo staff in questo devono lavorare ancora molto, soprattutto per colpire la fascia degli indecisi e di coloro di strato culturale basso (e ce ne sono tanti).<br>  <br>  Concludo dicendo che spero che questo Governo resista fino alla fine.

AA10956319	We were very successful in fostering a peaceful government in Japan after WWII.  America occupied Japan until 1952, and the Japanese people were unified in their desire to lead a pacifist future, based on the total destruction they experienced in WWII.  But they were already a highly organized civil society.  When you have these primative cultures in places like Vietnam, Korea, and much of the Middle East, they have no appetite for peace, and have no concept of what prosperity would even feel like.  The problem with Iraq and with a great deal of the world is the lack of unity and their burning hatred of other groups of people, based on religion, political ideology, wealth, race, location, or what have you...  Some theorized that, if you introduce these people to civil society, they will become civil... but that has not come to pass.

Why? <br>  Because:<br>  <br>  I have seen many of the projects implemented by USAID across my country (Afghanistan) or in the course of implementation which have been in very, very low quality.<br>  <br>  The biggest project of USAID in Afghanistan is one of the longest highways of Afghanistan called “Kabul-Kandahar highway, Through USAID, the Louis Berger Group was responsible for the reconstruction of the 389 km of the Kabul to Kandahar highway. The Louis Berger Group was awarded this contract through a competitive bidding and award process in September 2002. USAID is providing approximately $270 million in financing, or approximately $640,000 per kilometer.<br>  <br>  With so expensive cost, immediately after completion of the road, although it was supposed to be first level according to international standards but it appeared that it was matching to level III, as truck with load of over 25mt. coming on the road, asphalt of the road started moving with wheel of the trucks at time of breaking.<br>  <br>  The biggest problem with USAID is lack monitoring, USAID is awarding the project to US companies, US companies awards that to a foreign company, the foreign company awards that to a very cheap afghan company.<br>  <br>  If you see the number of people, organizations and companies involving the project, you can understand that how much of the real amount is wasted along the way and how many people or company should answer to other.<br>  <br>  So far USAID has spent nearly $3b. since the fall of Taliban regime, but if you have spent this many trough better channels, you could have got at least six times of the result of you get now.<br>  <br>  On the Afghanistan government side, based on many reasons, they can not comment on the issues.<br>  <br>  Either they are puppets or they think it is better than nothing, lets take it.<br>  <br>  Over 12 billion US dollar has been spent in Afghanistan, but still the capital is missing proper electricity, and no power station is currently under build.<br>  <br>  No USAID personal or authority has directly supervised their founded project to see whether it is implemented properly or improperly.|`|651026ed93d3a8cc465459add690e982aa	If you're starving and cold and the recipient, I would imagine it is.
AA10304847	While the political leaders and military brass publicly state that nuclear forces are controlled by the commander-in-chief or the next in line, the realities are that the hair triggers make that policy meaningless.  I read an article by Sen. Sam Nunn regarding the fallacy of the chain of command in face of an imminent or existing attack.<br>  <br>  The bias in favor of launch on electronic warning is so powerful that it would take enormously more presidential will to withhold an attack than to authorize it.  The option to “ride out” the onslaught and then take stock of the proper course of action exists only on paper.  That is what presidents never learn during their tenures.  Their real control is illusory.  What’s more, the truth has been kept from the presidents intentionally and the public in general.<br>  <br>  The reality is that the decision to launch is based in minutes, rather than hours (or even half hours).|`|c5cf033b92622e4c4a96d7676d5bfd15aa	Not really.  Command authority is very real and certain things have to happen to arm one and the things that make that happen come from high places.|`|2bb016b1e780abaa80d9a9bd66d8e804aa	No, it doesn't.<br>  <br>  "Launch on warning" is more of a movie script term... even if we had a warning of an attack, our military would still need Command Authority to launch.<br>  <br>  Since the mid-90's our missiles aren't targeting anything, therefore, we would need a launch order to facilitate targeting.

If you were given a summons to appear and not arrested just go and pay the fine and forget about it.  If the cop gave you a summons on the spot he gave you a break.  You could have been arrested for theft of service and criminal trespass.  If you are going for a city job and are asked if you had any encounters with the Police just say you got a summons and paid it.

Now with parent or guardian consent might be another thing.??|`|c34895fb3078ed6b839d8ec9443a9ab2aa	Legally, minors don't exist.  They have no ability to make, or break contracts, or enter into agreements. To see this in action, watch any of the Court reality shows on daytime TV.  <br>  It's possible, I guess, that a minor passing themselves off as an adult, might be held to a contract.  If the contractor, in good faith, believed they were legally able to enter into it.  It's equally possible, that in this instance the legal guardian of that minor would be held to the contract.|`|780848c898295a0b64baa3cc6a3906a4aa	A minor is not of the age of consent and cannot enter into a legally binding contract.

First, you have to show that the post was actually broken, and you have to prove that it has been broken since August of 2006.  Supporting letters to your landlord, photos, and/or witnesses will all meet this evidentiary burden. Next, you will have to show that you, as a tenant, diligently notified your landlord of the problem in a timely fashion.  For something as serious as a post or supporting structure, it should have taken you no longer than a week or two from the time you noticed the problem to report it.  Evidence should include phone call records to your landlord, letters, or any other proof you have that you notified him timely.  If your landlord made an attempt to fix or repair, and you denied him entrance to the property, it will hurt your case.  You must prove that this is YOUR landlord, and that he had a duty to fix it, he didn't perform that duty, and then you must prove that your broken arm was a direct result of his negligence. If your landlord can prove that you broke your arm for another reason - carelessness, drunkenness, intentional act, ect.  your case may be dismissed!  Once you prove that the broken arm came directly from or resulted from the broken post, you can show damages:  your broken arm, medical bills, emotional damages (possibly), missed work, etc.  This is a NEGLIGENCE TORT CASE.  Check NY Statute of Limitations. You may only have 1 or 2 years from the date of occurrence to file. Also, these types of cases almost never go to court.. if the landlord is guilty, he will SETTLE.  Get ready to pay your representation 1/3 of your winnings.  The good news is most lawyers will take a readily apparent "winning" case on a contingency fee .. meaning you won't have to pay legal fees up front.  Whatever you do, DO NOT WAIT TO FILE. You will lose important evidence!  Good Luck
fmzNgPD4aa	The French or the Israeli.<br>  Why ?<br>  <br>  26 december 1994, the GIGN storm the Air France airplane at Marseille, killing the 5 terrorists who planed to crash the plane on the Effeil tower in Paris. Please see the video:<br>  <a href="http://www.videoplayer.es/video/gign-assault-at-marseille/RSsLMnlliz0/" rel="nofollow">http://www.videoplayer.es/video/gign-ass...</a><br>  Result: all terrorist dead, no dead passenger during the operation, 10 GIGN injured. So the French (which Americans despise) managed to stop the terrorists from flying the plane into a building, 7 years before 9/11. Just a coincidence ? Talk about being a pro ... SWAT is using this film for their training.<br>  <br>  In June 1976 an Air France aeroplane wa hijacked by the Palestinians to land at Entebbe Airport, in UGANDA !!! At Entebbe, 83 Israeli citizens were held hostage together with 20 others. In the subsequent Israeli rescue operation, all but four hostages were freed, and one Israeli soldier died... So these guys flew 3000 miles over Africa unseen, undetected, landed in a foreign country on their international airport and rescued all the hostages, and left, went back 3000 miles to Israel !!!!

Daran gibt es eigentlich nichts zu rütteln. Ist der T?ter aber z.Bsp. geisteskrank, so gilt er aufgrund seiner Krankheit als "schuldunf?hig". Für die Anlasstat bekommt er zwar eine Strafe im o.g. Strafrahmen, wird aber zus?tzlich mit der "Einweisung in eine Anstalt für geistig abnorme Rechtsbrecher" (§ 21 StGB) belegt. Das hei?t, in jener Anstalt wird mit medizinischen oder auch therapeutischen Mitteln versucht, diesen Menschen von seiner Krankheit zu heilen. Erst danach beginnt seine eigentliche Strafe. <br>  Gehen wir nun davon aus, dass ein Mensch für eine Straftat, wie du sie befragst, die eher unwahrscheinliche Strafe von 10 Jahren erh?lt, so k?nnte er im frühesten Falle nach 5 Jahren (Halbstrafe) entlassen werden, soferne er nicht in den "Ma?nahmenvollzug (§ 21 StGB)" übergeben wurde. Die Realit?t sieht eigentlich so aus, dass solche Straft?ter durchwegs 20 Jahre oder lebenslang erhalten. <br>  Wer eine sechsj?hrige vergewaltigt und erwürgt, hat meiner Ansicht nach das Rechtheit auf Freiheit verwirkt. Es gibt nun einige, die in solchen F?llen durchaus die Todesstrafe einfordern. Dem halte ich entgegen, dass die Todesstrafe bei uns in Europa (Gott sei Dank) abgeschafft ist. Desweiteren haben wir ein Strafgesetzbuch, in welchem die verschiedensten Delikte durch verschieden hohe Sanktionen qualifiziert werden und danach haben wir uns zu richten. Wenn nun ein Gericht eine Straftat - was immer diese war - mit einer zeitlichen Freiheitsstrafe für schuldangemessen h?lt, so hat der Delinquent nach Verbü?ung dieser das Recht, wieder in Freiheit und soferne es ihm m?glich ist (immerhin l?dt so ein Mensch eine gewaltige moralische Schuld auf sich), auch glücklich weiter zu leben.

L'economia spagnola è una delle più floride dell'area euro, ma non per le scelte di Zapatero ma per un fatto di contingenza economica. Non dimentichiamo come Zapatero è salito al potere: ti ricordi gli attentati ferroviari di Madrid alla vigilia delle elezioni in Spagna che, sull'onda dell'emotività popolare, hanno sovvertito i pronostici della vigilia ? La democrazia è la forma migliore di governo solo quando fa comodo, quando gli USA cercano di esportarla nei paesi oppressi diventa "fascismo".

nfSxJts8aa	Fact: more crime in cities with more stringent gun laws.|`|AA11702773	Concealed carry laws are shown to reduce violent crime due to its deterent affect on perpetrators.  You could as easily say that if a bunch of students at VT commonly carried guns to class, the outcome might have been shorter.<br>  <br>  Unfortunately, bad guys get guns.  There are over half a million guns floating around the country that were sold legally.  There is no sense in only keeping the good guys from carrying them.  Because the bad guys don't care about the laws.<br>  <br>  However, I don't mind the 'secondary' private sales background checks so long as licensed dealers are required to accomodate them for a nominal fee.  <br>  <br>  Otherwise it is hard for aunt Hattie, who suddenly found herself in possession of all of uncle earl's old guns, to sell them, even to the right sort of person.<br>  <br>  She's more likely to give them away if selling them is too difficult.  And that is where the problems start.|`|UqN8wicfaa	My right to own weapons is the same as your right to free speech. If a lunatic attacks innocent people how is a legally obtained firearm the cause?

Guns are promoted way too much in America. This is an outsider looking in and I know I wouldn't want my children going to schools in America!

Ich kenne hier keinen Araber der hungern muss. Ich lebe seit 15Monaten in Kuwait(da es hier keinen Alcohol und keine Tanz Bars gibt, kenn ich mittlerweile auch den ganzen Rest der Emirate ;o) ) ehrlich gesagt, kenn ich kaum einen Kuwaiti der arbeitet. Wer hier arm ist( und dies ist in den gesamten arabischen Laendern so) das sind die Gastarbeiter aus dem afrikanischen und asiatischen Raum. Die Loehne fuer diese Menschen sind unsagbar niedrig. Zum Beispiel.... eine Hausmaid ( vorzugsweise Phillipina-weil sehr gute englisch Kenntnisse) arbeitet von morgens um 5 bis nachts um eins) wird behandelt wie eine Sklavin bekommt mit Glueck 45KD= ca 120Euro fuer Ihre Knochenarbeit, wird nebenbei geschlagen, vergewaltigt oder sogar umgebracht. Leider zaehlt ein Menschenleben hier nicht viel. Aber schlimmer ist es in Saudi Arabien. Ich denke ich muss nichts zur dort herrschenden Sklaverei(mmmh darf ich ja eigentlich gar nicht sagen..ist naemlich nicht offiziel)  sagen....aus dem Sudan verschleppte Kinder die den gesamten Haushalt einer Familie fuehren muessen.....Nun, die Haupt und Lieblingsbeschaeftigungen der Frauen hier ist...Shopping, Beauty Saloon und schoen aus zu sehen.

Dies ist für mich ein Eingriff in die Pers?nlichkeit und nicht ein bi?chen Spucke auf einem Wattest?bchen.

Il governo italiano ha avuto le mani legate nella trattativa per la liberazione di Hanefi, in quanto dopo la liberazione di Mastrogiacomo (che non è comunista , scrive per la Repubblica che non è certo Il Manifesto) le critiche mosse dagli altri Stati, U.S.A. e Gran Bretagna su tutti, in merito a come è stata condotta la trattativa, hanno impedito la piena libertà di negoziato con i talebani. Non è che se ne sono fregati, semplicemente non hanno potuto fare molto purtroppo, a causa delle restrizioni alla trattativa imposte dagli americani (ennesimo caso di sottomissione politica agli states).<br>  <br>  Per l'idiota che scrive che Gino Strada è un pirla...ti rendessi tu utile alla società quanto Strada invece di passare tutto il giorno su answers..|`|cd73d965390fcf46cbb1d3a22c0889c7aa	tutti in galera, loro.<br>  Si, mi fa schifo, hanno liberato  5  terroristi per un giornalista, e adesso se ne sono fregati di altri.

b1ec0c793bd6973fdc165c42637630efaa	ein oskar für die geile bande.<br>  habe alle folgen gesehen<br>  <br>  <br>  egon hatte immer einen plan und ein stummel zigarre<br>  yvonne immer eine piepsstimme<br>  kjelt immer diesen zwischenhopser im schritt<br>  sie fuhren ein schwarzes auto um egon aus dem knast <br>  abzuholen<br>  <br>  Egon Olsen, Gentlemanverbrecher mit starkem Repetitionsdrang und Perfektionist, ist Chef und Namensgeber der Olsenbande. W?hrend seiner Gef?ngnisaufenthalte (stets im Vridsl?selille Statsf?ngsel) entwickelt er jedes Mal ?geniale“ und ?todsichere“ Pl?ne, die er nach seiner Entlassung der Olsenbande vorstellt. Seine Spezialit?t ist das Knacken von Tresoren, besonders von denen der (real nicht existierenden) Firma Franz J?ger, Berlin (oder Frantz J?ger). Als einziges Bandenmitglied hat er Zugang zu ?besseren Kreisen“.<br>  Egon beherrscht au?erdem die Kunst, anderen das Wort im Mund umzudrehen: Einige Male, wenn Yvonne sich wieder von ihm lossagen oder ihm die Pl?ne ausreden will, gelingt es ihm, sie davon zu überzeugen, dass seine Absichten sich mit den ihren genau decken. In Film 10 fordert Benny eine Entschuldigung von Egon, nachdem dieser ihm den Coup vermasselt hat. Die Szene endet damit, dass sich Benny bei Egon entschuldigt.<br>  Egon wurde entweder 1925 oder 1927 geboren[1]. Seine Markenzeichen sind Melone, Nadelstreifenanzug und Zigarre (in den frühen Filmen raucht er sie meistens noch, sp?ter zündet er sich eigentlich nur noch zur Feier seiner Entlassung eine Zigarre tats?chlich an) – den kalten Zigarrenstummel beh?lt er selbst dann im Mund, wenn er geknebelt wird.<br>  Au?erdem verfügt er über ein betr?chtliches Repertoire an Schimpfw?rtern (siehe Running Gags).<br>  Die Anzahl seiner Haftstrafen ist nicht genau feststellbar. Nach Aussage von Benny aus Film 2 sa? Egon 1962 (also mit 27) zum ersten Mal in Haft. Im selben Film feiert er seine 10. Haftentlassung. Insgesamt sitzt er w?hrend der Filme mindestens 20-mal im Gef?ngnis - laut der Filme meistens jeweils etwa 6 bis 8 Monate (au?er im 1. Film - dort sitzt er zweimal je zwei Jahre). Im 8. Film ist die Rede von 20 Verurteilungen. Trotzdem wird er am Ende des 10. Films feierlich vom Gef?ngnisdirektor zum 10. Mal begrü?t.<br>  Egon Olsen ist einer der typischen Antihelden der Filmgeschichte, ein ewiger Verlierer, der immer ein Stehaufm?nnchen bleibt.<br>  In den sp?teren Filmen wird h?ufig Egons fortschreitendes Alter und seine angeblich verminderte geistige Zurechnungsf?higkeit thematisiert. Seine Ansichten und kriminellen Methoden werden ? obwohl Egon recht h?ufig Erfolg damit hat – sowohl von der Bande als auch von ihren Gegnern als nicht mehr zeitgem?? angesehen. Dies endet schlie?lich mit der Einweisung Egons in eine psychiatrische Anstalt am Ende des 13. Films. Trotzdem wird er im 14. Film von Oberstaatssekret?r Hallandsen engagiert, da dessen Ansicht nach Egon der Einzige ist, der noch ordentlich arbeiten kann, auch wenn seine Methoden nicht unbedingt zeitgem?? sind. Im selben Film bezeichnet Inspektor Jensen Egon als Gentleman, mit der Begründung, er habe wenigstens immer nur illegale Verbrechen begangen, nicht wie viele Wirtschaftsverbrecher ?heutzutage“, deren Verbrechen legal sind.<br>  Egon wurde in allen Filmen von Ove Sprog?e (1919-2004) gespielt.<br>  <br>  Benny Frandsen ist eine Art gro?er Junge mit einem losen Mundwerk. Als Fahrer der Olsenbande kann er nicht nur Autos steuern, sondern zum Beispiel auch Kleinlokomotiven, Kr?ne oder Panzer. Bennys Markenzeichen sind neben dem braunkarierten Sakko die zu kurzen Hosen, gelbe Socken, Schlapphut und ein leicht t?nzelnder Gang. Zu kurze Hosen tr?gt er selbst dann, wenn er seine normale Kleidung gegen eine Verkleidung getauscht hat. Ob er nun den Koch, den Polizisten oder den Saubermann spielt, immer sind unter den zu kurzen Hosen die gelben Socken zu sehen. Sein ewiger Standardspruch: ?M?chtig gewaltig!“. Dieser Spruch wurde aber in der DEFA-Synchronisation eingebaut, im d?nischen Original sagt Benny an diesen Stellen ?Skide godt“, was übersetzt etwa ?Schei?-gut“ bedeutet.<br>  Benny muss eine schwere Kindheit gehabt haben – Bennys Bruder Dynamit-Harry erz?hlt im zweiten Film, dass er und Benny nie einen Vater und nie eine richtige Mutter gehabt h?tten.<br>  Benny h?lt fast immer zu Egon. Wenn es zwischen Kjeld und Egon Streit gibt, ist es Bennys Aufgabe die beiden zu vers?hnen. Auch ist er eigentlich immer mit allem einverstanden, was Egon tut und sagt. Nur einmal ist er wirklich sauer auf Egon – als dieser ihm in Film 10 seinen Coup vermasselt, um wieder hinter Gittern zu landen.<br>  Benny hat weder Familie noch festen Wohnsitz. Sein Bruder Harry kommt nur in zwei Filmen vor. In Film 1 hat Benny eine Verlobte namens Ulla, mit der er zum Schluss des Films auch ein Kind hat. Aber weder Kind noch Ulla tauchen je wieder auf. Der Darsteller von Benny war in allen Filmen Morten Grunwald (*1934).<br>  <br>  Kjeld Jensen ist dick und ?ngstlich sowie der einzige Familienvater in der Bande. Er sorgt sich sehr um seine Frau Yvonne (der er sich stets unterordnen muss) und überhaupt um sein Privatleben. Nicht immer sind die Coups der Olsenbande mit seinem Gewissen vereinbar, das Verbrechen ist für ihn lediglich ein Mittel, um seine Familie zu ern?hren und seiner Frau ihren oft verschwenderischen Lebensstil zu erm?glichen.<br>  Kjelds Aufgabe ist die Besorgung all jener Gegenst?nde, die die Bande für die Ausführung ihrer Coups braucht. Diese tr?gt er stets in einer Hebammentasche bei sich. Durch seine z?gerliche, ?ngstliche Art, aber auch durch seine Naschsucht gef?hrdet Kjeld manchen Coup.<br>  Kjeld hat oft Streit mit Egon, meistens entweder wegen Yvonne oder weil ihm Egons Pl?ne zu anstrengend werden. Spricht er dann vom Aufh?ren, so muss ihn Egon meist nur daran erinnern, dass es seine Aufgabe ist, Yvonne zu beichten, dass wieder alles schiefgegangen ist, um ihn davon abzubringen.<br>  Kjeld spielte Poul Bundgaard (1922-1998). Als er vor Abschluss der Dreharbeiten zum vierzehnten Olsenbandenfilm starb, doubelte ihn Tommy Kenter (*1950).<br>  <br>  Yvonne ist Kjelds Ehefrau. W?hrend sie in den ersten beiden Filmen noch Nebenfigur ist, rückte sie seit dem dritten Film mehr in den Vordergrund und wurde so schlie?lich zur weiblichen Hauptfigur der Filme. Ab dem vierten Film geh?rte sie für Bahs und Balling zu einem der Ausgangspunkte für die Entwicklung der Drehbücher.<br>  Durch ihre Ansichten – einerseits ihren Geltungsdrang, der sich sowohl im Bedürfnis nach einem gutbürgerlichen Lebensstil als auch im Wunsch nach schnellem Reichtum niederschl?gt, andererseits auch ihrem hohen Ma? an Naivit?t – steht sie h?ufig im Gegensatz zu Egon. Die Diskussionen zwischen der Olsenbande auf der einen und Yvonne auf der anderen Seite, die sich meist w?hrend der Planungen für Egons neuesten Coup in Kjelds Wohnung abspielten, entwickelten sich so zu einem H?hepunkt jeden Olsenbandenfilms. Yvonne gelingt es regelm??ig Egon zur Wei?glut zu bringen, so dass er mal wütend das Haus verl?sst, manchmal sogar durchdreht (Film 6). Kjeld und Benny verhalten sich bei diesen Auseinandersetzungen eher passiv: Kjeld widerspricht Yvonne niemals, w?hrend Benny meist nur zaghafte, aber wenig fruchtlose Vermittlungsversuche startet.<br>  Darstellerin von Yvonne war Kirsten Walther (1933-1987). Nach ihrem Tod schien zun?chst ein vierzehnter Olsenbandenfilm nicht mehr machbar. Erst 1998 wurde ohne die Figur der Yvonne der endgültig letzte Film abgedreht.<br>  <br>  B?rge ist der Sohn von Yvonne und Kjeld. Im ersten Film ist er zw?lf Jahre alt. Seine Entwicklung ist für Yvonne ein wichtiges Thema. Seine Konfirmation (Film 4), der Beginn seiner Lehre (Film 7), seine Hochzeit (Film 8) und die Geburt seines Sohnes (Film 11) sind für Yvonne wichtiger als die Coups der Olsenbande.<br>  Von Anfang an ist B?rge durch seine Gewitztheit und schnelle Auffassungsgabe ein unverzichtbarer Helfer der Olsenbande, h?ufig zum Missfallen Yvonnes, die ihm ein m?glichst gutbürgerliches Leben erm?glichen m?chte. So beginnt er zun?chst eine Ausbildung bei der Staatsbahn und gründet eine eigene Familie; als er im letzten Film wieder auftaucht, ist er jedoch ein international gesuchter Finanzbetrüger geworden.<br>  Im ersten Film hatten Kjeld und Yvonne au?er B?rge noch zwei bzw. am Ende sogar drei weitere Kinder, darunter den ?ltesten Sohn Birger. Ab dem zweiten Film tauchen diese nie wieder auf, so dass B?rge im vierten Film schlie?lich als Kjelds einziges Kind bezeichnet wird.<br>  B?rge wurde von Jes Holts? (*1956) gespielt. Nach den Dreharbeiten zum 8. Film war er au?er zwei kleineren Auftritten in den Filmen 11 und 14 nicht mehr dabei, da Holts? glaubte, am gro?en Erfolg der Filme nicht genügend beteiligt worden zu sein.<br>  <br>  Zu einem Ganovenfilm geh?rt natürlich auch die Polizei. In den ersten beiden Filmen vertrat sie der pflichtbewusste, aber tollpatschige Inspektor Mortensen, dargestellt von Peter Steen (*1936). Im vierten Film tauchte Mortensen wieder auf, nunmehr von Jesper Langberg (*1940) verk?rpert. Sein übereifer führt dazu, dass er am Ende dieses Films in eine Zwangsjacke gesteckt wird und auf Nimmerwiedersehen verschwindet.<br>  Im fünften Film wird die Polizei durch einen noch namenlosen, von Axel Str?bye (1928-2005) verk?rperten Kriminalkommissar repr?sentiert, der ab dem sechsten Film als Kommissar Jensen bekannt wird und seinen Assistenten Holm – normalerweise gespielt von Ole Ernst (*1940), im neunten Film von Dick Kays? (*1947) – zur Seite gestellt bekommt. Die Dialoge zwischen den beiden entwickelten sich zu einem der vielen Running Gags der Olsenbandenfilme – w?hrend Holm darauf bedacht ist, durch die Aufkl?rung gro?er F?lle die Karriereleiter emporzusteigen, r?t Jensen seinem ?jungen Freund“ stets, dass solche F?lle besser niemals aufgekl?rt werden sollten. Stattdessen sollte sich ein Polizeibeamter lieber Dingen wie der Organisation von Betriebsausflügen widmen. Die Entwicklung der FIlme gibt mal Jensen, mal Holm Recht: So wird Jensen am Ende des siebten Films wegen des gelungenen Betriebsausflugs bef?rdert und erh?lt am Ende des achten sogar das Ehrenkreuz. Am Ende ist es trotzdem Holm, der Karriere macht, w?hrend Jensen frühzeitig pensioniert werden soll (aber wegen eines Computerfehlers 17 Jahre lang, bis 1998, darauf wartet).<br>  <br>  In den meisten Filmen hatte die Olsenbande neben der Polizei auch noch einen weiteren Gegenspieler. Waren es anfangs Verbrecher, die ihre Taten mehr oder weniger offen verübten, wie der Mafiaboss Motzarella (Harold J. Stone) in Film 2 oder der so genannte ?K?nig“ Victor Emmanuel Jensen (Arthur Jensen) in Film 4, so waren es ab Film 6 immer scheinbar ehrbare Politiker oder Gesch?ftsleute, die unter der Hand Steuerhinterziehung, Unterschlagung oder illegalen Waffenhandel betrieben. Diese Leute hie?en meist Hallandsen, Holm-Hansen oder Bang-Johansen und wurden h?ufig von Bj?rn Watt-Boolsen (1923-1998) dargestellt. Im achten Film ist der Gegenspieler der Olsenbande ein Adliger – der ebenfalls von Watt-Boolsen verk?rperte Baron L?venvold.<br>  <br>  Als Handlanger dieser Kapitalverbrecher fungiert ab dem sechsten Film das Dumme Schwein. Diesen Namen gab ihm Benny im siebten Film, im Original hei?t er ?B?ffen“ (= Bulette). Seine einzige Aufgabe ist meist, Egon zu ?beseitigen“ und ihm dabei das gestohlene Geld wieder abzunehmen. Obwohl er sehr einfallsreich ist, Egon loszuwerden, k?nnen Kjeld und Benny seine Pl?ne stets in letzter Sekunde vereiteln.<br>  Das Dumme Schwein wurde von Ove Verner Hansen gespielt, einem bekannten d?nischen S?nger und Schauspieler, der bereits im vierten und im fünften Olsenbandenfilm in zwei kleineren Rollen zu sehen war.<br>  <br>  Obwohl er nur zweimal dabei war, geh?rt auch Bennys Bruder Dynamit-Harry zu den popul?rsten Figuren der Olsenbandenfilme. Im zweiten Film ist er als extrem trinkfreudiger Sprengmeister zu erleben. Im fünften Film ist er erneut zu sehen, als Egon (von dem sich Kjeld und Benny losgesagt haben) für eine Weile bei ihm unterkommt und Harry (vorübergehend) versucht, trocken zu werden. Das misslingt, nachdem ihn Benny und Kjeld zwingen, im Laderaum eines Bierwagens zu sitzen. Harry ist vollkommen unf?hig irgendetwas zu sprengen, wenn er nüchtern ist, da er viel zu nerv?s und ?ngstlich ist.<br>  In den norwegischen und schwedischen Adaptionen der Olsenbande war Dynamit-Harry ?fter zu sehen.<br>  Dargestellt wurde er von Preben Kaas (1930-1981), der im dritten Film Better?v spielte, den stummen Gehilfen des Schrotth?ndlers Mads Madsen.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  ....<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  wahnsinnig genial und fast immer alles gelungen|`|48a590914cd5dcd13b78426777897759aa	Die waren immer im DDR-Fernsehen. Das war richtig was für die Dummen in Europa.|`|52d134b230ab0fe210084756bf0854b7aa	Die Olsenbande ist ein bekanntes Gaunertrio, die in 14 Filmen ihr Unwesen trieb. Die zwischen 1968 und 1998 entstandenen Filme erz?hlen von den immer neuen Versuchen dreier Kleinkrimineller, durch einen ?gro?en Coup“ reich zu werden. <br>  Die Ganoven werden von Ove Sprog?e (Egon Olsen), Poul Bundgaard (Kjeld) und Morten Grunwald (Benny) dargestellt. Regisseur der Olsenbande war bis auf den letzten Film stets der für seinen Perfektionismus bekannte Erik Balling der zusammen mit Henning Bahs auch die drehbücher schrieb. Beim vierzehnten Film konnte er aus Altersgründen nicht mehr selbst auf dem Regiestuhl Platz nehmen, sondern wurde von Tom Hedegaard vertreten. Als dieser w?hrend der Dreharbeiten verstarb, beendete Morten Arnfred den Film. <br>  <br>  In D?nemark und der DDR wurde die Reihe ein gro?er Erfolg. Einige der Filme waren auch im westdeutschen, Schweizer und ?sterreichischen Fernsehen zu sehen, erreichten dort jedoch bei weitem nicht den Bekanntheitsgrad wie in der DDR. Das ist wahrscheinlich auch auf die westdeutsche Synchronisation zurückzuführen, welche nicht die Qualit?t derer der DEFA erreichte. <br>  <br>  Au?erdem entstanden zur Olsenbande u. a. noch ein Kinderfilm (Olsenbande Junior) und mehrere Theaterstücke. <br>  <br>  Geschichtliches <br>  Der 1. Film hatte am 11. Oktober 1968 Premiere. In D?nemark wurde er ein ungeahnter Erfolg, worauf 1969 die Fortsetzung Die Olsenbande in der Klemme gedreht wurde. Dank seines gro?en Erfolges konnte der erste Film auch ins Ausland verkauft werden (DDR und Polen 1970, Schweden 1971). <br>  <br>  Waren die ersten beiden Filme noch mehr oder weniger Experimentierfeld gewesen, so wurden ab dem dritten Film Die Olsenbande f?hrt nach Jütland (1971) die Hauptfiguren mit ihren St?rken und Schw?chen mehr und mehr gefestigt. Von nun an folgte j?hrlich ein weiterer Film. <br>  <br>  1974 wollten sich die Macher der Olsenbande mit dem Film Der (voraussichtlich) letzte Streich der Olsenbande von ihrem Publikum verabschieden, doch schon im Folgejahr setzten sie sich erneut hinter die Schreibmaschine. Der so entstandene Film Die Olsenbande stellt die Weichen wird von den d?nischen Fans sogar als der beste der Reihe bezeichnet. 1981 sollte dann aber endgültig Schluss sein – zum Abschluss der Reihe wurden die Filme Die Olsenbande fliegt über die Planke und Die Olsenbande fliegt über alle Berge gedreht, die eine drei Stunden lange in sich geschlossene Handlung erz?hlen. Diese Filme sollten die unwiderruflich letzten sein. <br>  <br>  Als die Hauptdarstellerin Kirsten Walther (Yvonne) 1987 starb, schien ein weiterer Olsenbandenfilm endgültig nicht mehr realistisch. <br>  <br>  Doch 1996 drehten Sprog?e, Grunwald und Bundgaard unter Ballings Regie den viereinhalbminütigen Werbefilm Olsen-Bandens spareplan für einen d?nischen Energieversorger. Nach den positiven Reaktionen auf diesen Film beschlossen Balling und Bahs, es doch noch einmal zu versuchen. So entstand 1998 schlie?lich Der (wirklich) allerletzte Streich der Olsenbande. Das Projekt drohte zu scheitern, als Hauptdarsteller Poul Bundgaard w?hrend der Dreharbeiten und kurz darauf auch Regisseur Tom Hedegaard starb. Doch man entschloss sich, den Film mit einem Double des Hauptdarstellers fertig zu stellen. Am 18. Dezember 1998 hatte er in D?nemark Premiere. <br>  <br>  [bearbeiten]Filme<br>  1.

nSxwBvZjaa	Um das übergewicht der UdSSR an konventionellen Streitkr?ften in Europa auszugleichen, setzen die USA Mitte der 50er Jahre verst?rkt auf atomare Abschreckung. Gro?britannien und Frankreich arbeiten an der Entwicklung von Atomwaffen. Die Bundesregierung will ebenfalls an der atomaren Umrüstung der NATO beteiligt sein und dr?ngt auf eine gleichberechtigte Bewaffnung der Bundeswehr. Auch NATO-Oberbefehlshaber General Norstad fordert im Februar 1957 für die Bundeswehr den Besitz von Kernwaffen. Im Dezember 1957 beschlie?en die Regierungschefs der NATO-Mitgliedsstaaten, die westeurop?ischen Armeen mit Mittelstreckenraketen und Atomsprengk?pfen auszurüsten. <br>  Weil die Bundesrepublik in den Pariser Vertr?gen auf die Produktion und den Erwerb von Kernwaffen verzichtet hatte, soll die Bundeswehr nach dem Willen von Verteidigungsminister Strau? zumindest mit Tr?gersystemen für amerikanische Sprengk?pfe ausgerüstet werden. Auch Bundeskanzler Adenauer tritt für die Atombewaffnung der Bundeswehr ein. Auf einer Pressekonferenz im April 1957 bezeichnet er die taktischen Atomwaffen verharmlosend als "Weiterentwicklung der Artillerie." Gegen die Politik Adenauers protestiert eine Gruppe angesehener deutscher Atomphysiker, darunter die Nobelpreistr?ger Otto Hahn, Max Born und Werner Heisenberg. Im "G?ttinger Manifest" vom 12. April 1957 fordern sie ?ffentlich den Verzicht der Bundesrepublik "auf den Besitz von Atomwaffen jeder Art". <br>  Eine von der Sozialdemokratischen Partei Deutschlands (SPD), dem Deutschen Gewerkschaftsbund (DGB) und pazifistischen Gruppen im M?rz 1958 angeregte Kampagne "Kampf dem Atomtod" führt in den darauffolgenden Wochen zu gro?en Demonstrationen. Eine der Leitfiguren des Protestes ist der evangelische Kirchentagspr?sident Martin Niem?ller. Auch im Bundestag kommt es zu einem heftigen Schlagabtausch zwischen Regierung und Opposition. Die absolute Mehrheit von CDU/CSU und Deutscher Partei (DP)im Bundestag beschlie?t am 25. M?rz 1958, die Bundeswehr mit Tr?gersystemen für Nuklearwaffen auszurüsten. <br>  <br>  So gesehen, ht sich das Volk mit Vernunft weitgehend durchsetzen k?nnen.|`|3488029e9f84c9ffebcd744bfef00c53aa	Die Bundswehr hat keine EIGENEN Atomwaffen, das stimmt.

ldFKRPqoaa	Hab gerade letzte Woche in Berlin noch einen mit Pfeife gesehen...<br>  Aber zugegeben, ein selten gewordenes Ph?nomen. Ich denke, da? liegt daran, da? heute nur noch sehr wenig Stellen zu finden sind, wo regul?r der Verkehr durch die Polizei geregelt wird.<br>  So etwas sieht man nur noch bei unerwartet ausgefallenen Ampeln an stark befahrenen Kreuzungen o.?..<br>  In diesem Fall wird spontan eine Streife dazu abgestellt, den VErkehr zu regeln. Da aber eine Pfeife nicht zur Standart- Ausstattung eines Streifenwagens geh?rt (vermutlich mal wegrationalisiert), trillern die Streifenbeamten nicht.<br>  Früher war das anders: An fest vorgegebenen Punkten wurde der VErkehr durch einen Schupo geregelt, der morgens schon wusste, da? er den ganzen Tag auf dieser Kreuzung verbringen mu?te. Er nahm von vorneherein sein Pfeifchen mit.<br>  <br>  Was mir, wo wir gerade beim Thema sind, auff?llt, ist etwas ganz anderes: Kaum ein Polizist, den ich bisher den Verkehr auf einer Kreuzung habe regeln sehen, benutzte die einfachen und durch die StVO vorgeschriebenen Zeichen, die die Signale der Ampelfarben ersetzen, sondern die Herren in blau (bzw. ab und zu noch in grün) improvisierten mit eigens erfundenem Herumgewinke.<br>  Das führte teilweise zu Z?gerlichkeit und Mi?verst?ndnissen seitens der Autofahrer.<br>  <br>  (zu den Signalen: Laut § 36 Abs. 2 StVO: <br>  - rot: seitliches Ausstrecken der Arme quer zur Fahrtrichtung<br>  - grün: Austrecken der Arme l?ngs zur Fahrtrichtung<br>  - gelb: Hochhalten eines Armens, Oberk?rper quer zur Fahrrichtung<br>  - rot-gelb: seitliches Hochhalten des Armes l?ngs zur Fahrtrichtung|`|LMb3WgOZaa	Hallo Mr. Brian,<br>  <br>  die Pfeife geh?rt (in Bayern) immer noch zur Grundausstattung eines jeden Polizeibeamten. Leider sind unsere modernen Fahrzeuge inzwischen so l?rmged?mmt (und mit leistungsstarken CD-Playern ausgerüstet), dass kein Mensch da drin das Trillern mehr h?rt. Und deshalb wird das Teil halt nur noch beim Dienstsport als Schiedsrichterpfeife benützt.<br>  <br>  Spass beiseite: früher hatte jeder Polizeibeamte in Ermangelung eines Funkger?ts noch eine Pfeife, nachdem die Fu?streifendichte wesentlich h?her war und er so in kurzer Zeit Kollegen alarmieren konnte, wenn es notwendig war. Nachdem es aber kaum noch Fu?streifen gibt (weil es immer weniger Polizeibeamte gibt), hat das Teil kaum noch einer dabei. Und wenn man die Pfeife nicht dabei hat, kann man sie auch nicht benutzen, wenn mal eine Ampel ausf?llt.<br>  Die erste Begründung stimmt übrigens trotzdem.<br>  <br>  Gru?,<br>  Stefan|`|b2fff8bb1602f629576684ff327f4872aa	wirklich wissend kann ich dir die frage nicht beantworten.<br>  aber ich denke es liegt daran das die Autos heute "leider" geworden sind und damit ein Polizist keine Trillerpfeife mehr braucht, um sich Geh?r zu verschaffen.<br>  Einfach Handzeichen und auff?llige Kleidung reicht.|`|d8360b284248edf586aa487f54e1d816aa	Weil es durch den im Laufe der Jahre immer mehr angestiegenen "Ger?uschpegel" in den Autos wahrscheinlich sinnlos ist, mit Pfeifen auf sich aufmerksam zu machen.<br>  Ich wohne selbst an einer Kreuzung (ohne Verkehrspolizist *g*) und wenn da der ein oder andere Wagen etwas l?nger h?lt, drehe ich schon mal den Fernseher lauter, damit ich die Dialoge nicht von den Lippen der Darsteller ablesen muss.<br>  In mancher Disco ist die Phonzahl niedriger.|`|c6dcec4ff397219708d99dba8b54e28caa	Weil die Polizisten früher intelligenter waren und zwei Dinge gleichzeitig konnten (pfeifen und winken)<br>  Heute sind sie schon mit einer Sache überfordert !

AA11900231	couldn't agree more. jail time supposed to be a punishment, not leisure, yet inmates get clean clothes, 3 meals a day, cable TV, internet access, etc. etc. etc. they should work at least 40 hours a week, do the real hard labor. in case inmate refuses to work - no meals and put him/her in a seclusion room with no TV, etc. rapists/murderers and other criminals of that type do not deserve to be treated like humans because they are not, they're animals. and the last thing I'd do is spend any $ on them.|`|616fa670a5aad30835b68399d5cb0d9aaa	Three meals a day is considered decent human treatment. The people who are hard working and don't always get 3 meals a day need to apply for food stamps or stop by soup kitchens, and they can have more meals too. <br>  <br>  As for television--I'd rather have the prisoners watching American Idol than learning how to be a better criminal from the other criminals. But what I'd really like to see are more educational opportunities, which not only get the prisoners away from the TV but help them be better people when they leave the prison (since the majority aren't in there for murder or violent crimes). 60% of all American prisoners are functionally illiterate. Many people think that's a causal factor in them turning to crime in the first place.|`|644fe9633265c82afa8cdeb71d97a23daa	Prisoners probably don't deserve anything.<br>  <br>  It is we, the non-prisoners, who deserve to maintain our humanity.

And the result would be disastrous.  Going to prison itself is pretty serious.

You know how you tell your kids not to watch too much TV because it rots their brains?  Its true.  Jail run so much smoother when the inmates sit in front of a TV like zombies.  Take away the TVs, they act out, riot, learn from each other how to be better criminals.

Most of the time, like here in the south where I live, the inmates plant and grow their own food.  Most of the cost comes from the maintaining of the building, paying for law enforcment, safety, cameras, and it cost millions to put someone to death for some reason.  And many other things, I think they should just send them to somewhere like Iraq or Kuwait so they can take out some of that negative energy on terrorists.|`|435efbe75d0f16cf19d825a5cc1213e7aa	why don't we send all them scum of the earth to a island and forget about them that would save money too.It what seperates the U.S  from other  inhumaine countries.If we did take away inmate rights we would be no diffrent from China, Cuba,Cambodia|`|98df42003a2f750c8c74c7065030eb61aa	Wow! You know, I think that our government is not doing a good job with the people in prison. Not because they give them too much food, but because they punish them instead of helping them. Prisoners stay there while we pay the taxes then they get out and commit another crime and teach their children to do the same. So that's not working. We should help the people that need help by letting the prisoners talk with a psychologist, pastor, priest whatever. What you want to do is punish them more by giving them less food so that when they get out we have even more poor people because they'd be so worn out.<br>  <br>  Don't be harsh with the people in jail.

The loss of freedom, rights and in some cases life, is considered to be enough by law. Treating prisoners with a decent level of human dignity separates us from barbarism.|`|diGiFQUWaa	Don't agree at all. The food in jail/prison isn't exactly high class - some places boast that it only costs something like 40c per serving which isn't much at all. If you are in prison you still deserve the basics including proper food, clothing and healthcare. Somebody complained about prisoners getting clean clothes - so you're in jail for a DUI and you should have to wear what exactly? Spending your days in an orange jumpsuit - isn't exactly high fashion.<br>  <br>  As someone else said most of the money spent on prisons and jails goes to pay the staff - the inmates don't get to see much of it. And in most places you mighthave 2 TVs in a dayroom of 60 or 80 people - it's not exactly costing a fortune. In jail boredomis a big problem and the TV is something that helps to deal with that but it's not a luxury.

Certamente Emergency è il punto da cui partire, ma il vero "mediatore" della situazione non è lo Strada, ma quello che si dice il suo vice afghano, che ora sarebbe arrestato dal governo locale, che è il vero capo della struttura in quanto "vicino" ai talebani, molto vicino, tanto che a nessuno viene in mente di far del male a Strada.

Gino ha fatto tanto e penso che farà altretanto...ma è una persona umana... cercare di "gestire" questo tipo di emozioni da parte della stampa ..mi sembra fuori luogo ... il dolore delle persone non si gestisce ..si cerca di renderlo meno doloroso nel possibile ... buttare benzina sul fuoco la chiamo questo cercare risposte da Prodi o chicchessia ... l'unica cosa "finisco" e rivedere appunto l'azione dell'Italia in questu conflitti ...redendonsi conto che di tutti i pro e i contro ,sia in caso di abbandono..lascianfdo il paese in mano a dei "banditi"...sia in caso di un rinnovo dell'azione che in alcuni casi può essere di Pace come di guerra...e che hai a che afre con della "gentaglia"...io sono d'accordo sulla seconda ..sempre che sia basata su una fine in tempi brevi ..costi quel che costi..cioè portare una democrazia in quel paese...non certamente ad un'azione basata su una torta di investimenti "militari"....cosa che mi sembra la + palusibile visti i ben 5-6 anni o + non ricordo di conflitto...mi sembrano troppi ... a questo punto o la cosa la finiamo in 1-2 anni oppure,facciamo + bella figura ad andare via ...Ciao.|`|8a80777ef8c5739297f08753943625ccaa	allora, Strada è un farneticatore, che al momento sta smarronando questo governo di burattini.

Ricordate Prodi cosa dichiarò quando aveva anticipato l'ubicazione del cadavere di Moro? "l'ho appreso in una seduta spiritica".

Ma la Magistratura si stà interessando a questi fatti?|`|ay77Zx1waa	Allora, io la penso così. Cercando di ragionare senza farsi prendere dall'emozione del momento (che c'è ed è tanta), o dalla tentazione di strumentalizzare tutta la faccenda per dare addosso al governo. Capisco perfettamente Strada, che lavora in quei posti martoriati per portare assistenza alle vittime innocenti di una situazione assurda, e che adesso assiste impotente alla morte di un altro innocente; penso però che la colpa di questa morte sia da attribuire prima di tutto ai suoi esecutori, cioè i talebani, alla loro inumanità, al loro fanatismo; Karzai ne porta certo la responsabilità, essendosi rifiutato di trattare. A Prodi cosa si rimprovera? Di aver chiesto a suo tempo a Karzai di fare di tutto per salvare l'ostaggio italiano? Non era certo lui che poteva decidere se liberare o no i prigionieri talebani, la decisione spettava a Karzai. Chiediamoci cosa sarebbe successo se i talebani avessero ucciso Mastrogiacomo. Credete che nessuno avrebbe protestato? Che tutti avrebbero plaudito? La verità è che in Afghanistan la situazione è terribile, e le decisioni da prendere di volta in volta sono cariche di responsabilità che solo chi prende quelle decisioni sa quanto pesino. Dal di fuori è facile dire si doveva o non si doveva fare. La verità è che occorerebbe una concertazione in campo nazionale e internazionale, perchè dalle polemiche gli unici che traggono vantaggio sono proprio loro, i talebani.

Si parla appunto di MORTE DISSOCIATA, che consente il mantenimento artificiale delle funzioni vegetative ALL'UNICO SCOPO DI TRAPIANTO nei pazionti con una condizione ACCERTATA di MORTE CEREBRALE.<br>  <br>  LA MORTE CEREBRALE è SCIENTIFICAMENTE E COMPLETAMENTE IRREVERSIBILE.<br>  <br>  La mancata comprensione di questo concetto (il paziente NON è vivo anche se il cuore batte! è morto!) nasce dal fatto che molte persone, ovviamente, ignorano la complessa fisiopatologia elettrica del cuore. IL CUORE e' DOTATO DI UN SISTEMA DI PACEMAKER INTRINSECO, che GENERA LO STIMOLO ELETTRICO ALL'INTERNO DI UNA SUA PICCOLISSIMA PORZIONE, il nodo seno-atriale, CHE GLI PERMETTE DI BATTERE (accoppiamento elettro-meccanico) IN TOTALE INDIPENDENZA DAL SISTEMA NERVOSO.<br>  <br>  NON é IL CERVELLO CHE COMANDA AL CUORE DI BATTERE!!IL CUORE BATTE DA SOLO e il cervello (inteso come sistema nervoso autonomo orto-e para-simpatico) può solo aumentare o diminuire l'attività cardiaca, MA IL RITMO SI GENERA SPONTANEAMENTE. <br>  <br>  Per questo motivo, il cuore, una volta cessate le funzioni cerebrali, può continuare a battere per un periodo variabile tra i pochi minuti fino a un quarto d'ora (ovviamente morte non causata da arresto cardiaco o infarto cardiaco massivo, ma in tutte le altre cause di morte che non riconoscono un'etiologia cardiaca). Poi si arresta anche lui, ED é A QUESTO PUNTO che in caso di AUTORIZZAZIONE ALL'ESPIANTO LE FUNZIONI CARDIOVASCOLARI VENGONO SOSTENUTE ARTIFICIALMENTE.<br>  <br>  Spero di essere stata chiara..<br>  detesto gossolane sciocchezze spacciate come verità  sconvolgenti|`|0735a7ae55257fd3d52696fc80fd4367aa	da padre di bimbo trapiantanto e salvato a nuova vita, pur rispettando l'idea altrui, dissento da quanto sostieni. l'espianto avviene sì da persona che non è un  cadavere rigido, ma nella quale sia stata accertata la morte cerebrale.

b536c8e14ed51cfe62ac9ab8ee215f46aa	Mi hanno cancellata una domanda sulla questione Visco. Vedendo questa domanda altro che decreto notte e nebbia....<br>  <br>  Ci deve essere sotto qualcosa di talmente inconfessabile che :::::|`|YIKTMRIkaa	Basterebbe informarsi bene, e si capirebbe la trappola nei confronti di Visco, però voi di destra vi riempite la bocca senza informarvi prima. Faccio copia incolla di una mia precedente risposta. Anche se so benissimo che non servirà a niente, i pregiudizi sono duri a morire.<br>  <br>  1. Speciale presenta a Visco qualche mese fa un piano di avvicendamenti comprendenti l'intero quadro di comando della G. d. F. Motivazione: è prassi che ogni tre anni gli incarichi siano avvicendati per ragioni di funzionalità. <br>  <br>  2. Visco esamina il piano e vede che l'avvicendamento riguarda tutti i comandi salvo quelli di Milano e della Lombardia. Ne chiede ragione. Speciale, in ottemperanza, s’impegna a riformulare il piano includendovi i comandi della Lombardia. <br>  <br>  3. Visco sa benissimo il motivo dell'esclusione dei generali e dei colonnelli che hanno incarichi dirigenti a Milano: si è formato da anni in quella provincia un gruppo di potere collegato con il comando generale di Roma. Risulta a Visco che quegli ufficiali abbiano "chiuso gli occhi" su gravissime irregolarità verificatesi nel sistema delle intercettazioni telefoniche, avvenute nel corso di scalate finanziarie a banche e a giornali. <br>  <br>  Alcuni di quei documenti sono stati trafugati e consegnati a giornali di parte per la pubblicazione. In alcuni casi le intercettazioni non sono neppure arrivate all'ufficio del Pubblico Ministero ma trafugate prima e consegnate ai giornali senza che la magistratura inquirente ne avesse preso visione. <br>  <br>  4. Passano i giorni e le settimane ma Speciale non consegna il nuovo piano di avvicendamento. <br>  <br>  5. Nel frattempo lo stesso Speciale avvisa, all'insaputa di Visco, il procuratore della Repubblica di Milano che i comandi della G. d. F. milanese stanno per essere sostituiti. Il procuratore si preoccupa per i nuclei di polizia giudiziaria che operano ai suoi ordini effettuando inchieste delicate e importanti. Speciale lo invita a mettere per iscritto quelle preoccupazioni. Arriva la lettera del procuratore. Speciale la mostra a Visco. <br>  <br>  6. Visco, dopo aver riesaminato la pratica, telefona a Speciale per manifestare la sua sorpresa e il suo malcontento. Speciale mette in vivavoce la telefonata alla presenza di due alti ufficiali che ascoltano la conversazione. <br>  <br>  7. Il tribunale di Milano, richiesto di verificare lo stato dei fatti in via di accertamento, esclude che esista alcuna indebita interferenza da parte di Visco. <br>  <br>  8. Speciale rende pubblico il conflitto in atto presentandolo come un'interferenza di Visco sull'autonomia della G. d. F. <br>  Di qui i seguiti politici che conosciamo e che portano all'autosospensione di Visco dalla delega sulla G. d. F. e alla rimozione di Speciale dal comando generale per rottura del rapporto fiduciario tra lui e il governo. <br>  <br>  Dove sia in questa arruffata vicenda l'attentato alla Costituzione e alla democrazia denunciato con voce stentorea da Berlusconi e da tutti i suoi alleati, Casini compreso, è un mistero. <br>  <br>  Il vice ministro delle Finanze aveva - ed ha - il fondato sospetto di gravi irregolarità compiute da alcuni comandi collegati con il comando generale. Rientra pienamente nei suoi poteri stimolare il comando generale ad avvicendare i generali non affidabili. Alla fine, accogliendo le preoccupazioni del procuratore di Milano, lo stesso Visco consente ad escludere i comandi milanesi dall'avvicendamento dei quadri nel resto d'Italia. <br>  <br>  Tra i dettagli (dettagli?) incredibili c'è quella telefonata messa in vivavoce all'insaputa dell'interlocutore ed ascoltata da due ufficiali di piena fiducia dello Speciale. Basterebbe questo dettaglio a rimuoverlo dal comando. <br>  Del resto - e purtroppo - non è la prima volta che il comando generale della G. d. F. dà luogo a gravissimi scandali. Almeno in altre due occasioni dovette intervenire la magistratura penale e fioccarono pesanti condanne di reclusione.

Il credere in un potere superiore, eterno e assoluto è rassicurante ma è anche la  negazione della dialettica, del relativismo materialista e della scientificità della vita, della sua evoluzione in ogni sua forma e fenomeno. Credere in un assoluto, sia esso Dio , sia esso un re, un duce significa credere e desiderare l'immutabilità della realtà, significa concepire la ciclicità e la linearità evolutiva  della realtà come come un ripetersi immutabile di stessi eventi  in forme diverse. Invece la concezione materialistico.scientifica di Marx considera la ciclicità simile ma anche sostanzialmente cambiabile e la  linearità evolutiva caratterizzata da cose profondamente diverse in forme sostanzialmente diverse anche e soprattutto per l'azione della volontà umana che esprime la razionalità e il controllo scientifico  dell'evoluzione economica, politica e sociale delle società umane. In questo senso, il pensiero religioso, è loppio dei popoli perché crea una resistenza a priori, al nuovo e al cambiamento determinato dalla evoluzione della mente e della volontà umane, in particolare quando questo nuovo, tende a cambiare lo stato di cose esistenti in modo profondo e quindi a cambiare le regole strutturali di sistema, fondamentalmente inique, dispari e diseguali, in regole strutturalmente eque, paritetiche egualitarie dando vita a un sistema nuovo in cui lo stile di vita, il modo di lavorare, produrre, distribuire la ricchezza collettivamente prodotta , le risorse e le energie planetarie sia equo, paritetico egualitario. In tal modo si dimostra materialmente possibile il cambiamento dei criteri della ciclicità e della linearità evolutiva per opera dell'intelligenza e della volontà umane e non divine. Si dimostra la possibilità di poter cambiare profondamente, radicalmente e sostanzialmente lo stato di cose esistenti. Marx insegna a non aver bisogno del pensiero religioso  indipendentemente dal credere o meno in Dio.|`|3c46d6d887bcf52b876dff7b166267c4aa	gli esempi dati a dimostrazione delle guerre di religione sono superficiali: le crociate furono fatte per difendere i pellegrini cristiani che nei loro pellegrinaggi venivano assaliti dai banditi locali (musulmani o meno che fossero); la seconda guerra mondiale non fu fatta contro gli ebrei ma per ragioni di egemonia territoriale (si potrebbe dire contro il comunismo in quanto l'obiettivo finale era quello: lo sterminio degli ebrei fu un "valore aggiunto" della follia di Hitler).

Fondamentalmente le guerre si fanno soltanto per appropriarsi di qualcosa di ben più materiale come nell'attuale caso degli Stati Uniti (e dei loro alleati, compresi noi Italiani) nella guerra di conquista mediorientale<br>  L'11 settembre è stata una vera menzogna, è lo è stato dimostrato da vari documentari, prodotti negli Stati Uniti e  non da qualche "pazzo comunista", quindi il motivo di conflitto cristiano-musulmano che tu indichi non sussiste.<br>  E l'attuale guerra, pianificata dagli Usa ben prima dell'11 settembre ha un unico  movente: garantire agli Stati Uniti e all'Occidente il proprio stato di benessere e la propria libertà al consumo andandosi a prendere il petrolio mediorientale e cercando di aprire nuovi mercati. Il motivo religioso viene fatto credere alle masse per creare paura, disordine e intolleranza, ma non è il movente di una guerra <br>  ,

Tutto è stato spiegato molto bene dal 1999 in poi. Il nome di Prodi è sempre venuto fuori nei vari passaggi di cordate bancarie, di capitalisti senza capitali, di statalizzazione e di privatizzazione e non ultimo nel caso Rovati dove il Presidente del Consiglio, Sig. Prodi Romano, ha perso la faccia e Rovati l'incarico. Tutto questo è verificabile, ma niente di male e comunque qualcuno direbbe che sono tentativi della destra di infangare il PdC Sig. Prodi Romano. Il problema è che il Sig. Prodi, smentendo Tronchetti Provera e negando di aver avuto contatti con lui per l'ennesimo tentativo di cordata bancaria e capitalisti senza capitali lo ha fatto innervosire e gli ha praticamente dato via libera per la vendita, peraltro vantaggiosa, a investors stranieri. Tutti vorrebbero che la Telecom rimanesse patrimonio italiano per cui Fassino ha ventilato l'ipotesi che un intervento del G.S:B. (Grande Silvio Berlusconi) con Fininvest e/o Mediaset potrebbe essere benvisto. Il che ha scatenato le ire di Giordano e Compagni Bolscevichi (G&CB) che hanno detto in coro: giammai, giammai. Nessuno ha capito la strategia di Fassino. Berlusconi acquista, la Telecom rimane italiana, quando la CDL ritorna al governo Fassino sguinzaglia la Bocassini e la Famosa Magistratura Democratica di Sinistra in modo che in parlamento si ricominci con la tiritera del conflitto di interessi e la B.e.F.M.d.S.

Damit meint man ihre Auslegung der marxistischen Theorie, die sie für die Sowjetunion enwickelt haben. <br>  Sozialismus ist das schwierigste. Im Marxismus stellt er eine Zwischenstufe auf dem Weg zum Kommunismus dar. Viele Parteien und Organisationen die den Sozialismus zum Ziel haben verstehen darunter aber eher eine gerechtere Gesellschaft in verschiedenen Auspr?gungen. Die alle aufzuz?hlen w?re jetzt zu langatmig.<br>  Ich hoffe ich habe dir jetzt ein bisschen weiter geholfen.

dd4865d0e0d9940448690e8389b62bb6aa	Es kommt darauf an was man will. Ich bin eher gegen einen Mindestlohn.<br>  <br>  Begründung:<br>  1. Viele unqualifizierten Arbeiter erhalten sonst keine Chance mehr auf Arbeit.<br>  2. Es gibt viele Arbeiten, die sich mit dem Mindestlohn in Deutschland nicht mehr lohnen. Diese Arbeiten kauft kein Verbraucher mehr, da dann zu teuer sind.<br>  <br>  Was für Auswirkungen der Mindestlohn hat, kann sehr gut in Frankreich beobachten. Dort arbeiten bereits 15% der Bev?lkerung für den Mindestlohn. Folge: Besonders viele Zuwanderer und Niederqualifizierte k?nnen nur noch illegal schwarz arbeiten und dies unter dem Mindestlohn oder sie bleiben ohne Arbeit. Dies führte zu dem Aufstand in den Vororten von Paris, da Migranten keine Chance mehr erhielten regul?re Arbeit zu bekommen.<br>  <br>  Besser halte ich  das Modell des Grundeinkommen. Jeder soll vom Staat 500 € im Monat erhalten und krankenversichert werden. Von dem was er dazuverdient, mü?te er generell 25% versteuern ohne Ausnahmen. Alle anderen Leistungen des Staates würden gestrichen werden.<br>  Eine Familie mit 2 Kinder bek?me so 2000 € vom Staat und wenn dann noch 1000 € dazuverdient werden würden, h?tte die Famile 2750 € zur Verfügung und das ohne bürokratische Antr?ge ohne komplizierte Mindestlohnregelung usw.|`|86c3a50996271346332c8d88e0abffe6aa	Da kann ich Dir nur Recht geben.

Aber es ist nichts bei herum gekommen....viele Bauer stellen keine Deutsche ein ( finde ich diskriminierend ! ). Ich selber habe anschlie?end mit den Betrieben gesprochen, die sogar beim Arbeitsamt annonciert hatten, weshalb meinn Freund abgelehnt wurde... die sagen einem ganz frech, dass die keine Deutsche einstellen. ( Der Lohn lag bei 5,80 € + 0,80 € das Kilo, also nicht mal so schlecht also, ca. 8 € die Stunde ) Die anderen Betriebe hatten das Problem, dass die gestellten Unterkünfte mit Polen oder Russen belegt waren.

Aborginal people are more challenging in today's society than they had been 50 years ago.  <br>  <br>  Yes Aborginal I agree were nomadic people, they owned all of the continents before the coming of the European contact days. They travelled in areas of hunting, fishing, trapping & gathering.<br>  <br>  They went were the animals migrated to, where the could get fresh water and you will notice that most Indian Reserves are by by lakes.  They sure as hell weren't in one area years ago.<br>  <br>  My Indian Reserve has not settled thier land claim nor Specific Claim where National Defence had some involvement.  Hunters were locked out of this one area that National Defence took over, <br>  well the government is getting presently sued after 50 years.  This is when my late father was Chief of our first nation.  Imagine having your livelihood depend on Trapping for furs and feeding your family by hunting.<br>  <br>  That area called Primrose Air Weapons Range in Saskatchewan has hit oil and gas to begin with.  I believe the aboriginal people should continue protesting and taking the government to court. <br>  <br>  Our Politican in Ottawa is Aboriginal - Gary Merasty more people are turning out at the polls for elections in our area.  This is what we need to continue having our own people elected in Parliament.<br>  <br>  Isn't is an aboriginal grave yard that started the Oka crisis.  Building a golf course over an graves is so despicable.  Imagine the aborignal people having a Pow-Wow over graves in which terms thye know better to have more respect than that. <br>  <br>  Where white people see $$$ and money to be made is what their society rules by.<br>  <br>  I have a mixture of blood, not to say that I have some white blood too.  However, the two worlds are very different.  Money and greed rules one culture!

duGlyKwMaa	Die Frage ist wirklich schwer zu beantworten. Was meinst du denn mit Gerichtsbetrug? Und wie kann man so etwas über 2 Instanzen erfolgreich abwenden? <br>  <br>  Wie auch immer, Betrug iSd. § 263 StGB selbst w?re mit einer Freiheitsstrafe von bis zu 5 Jahren bzw. einer Geldstrafe zu bestrafen, in schweren F?llen sogar mit einer Freiheitsstrafe von 6 Monaten bis zu 10 Jahren.<br>  <br>  Da du es aber "Gerichtsbetrug" nennst, ist es vielleicht eine falsche (uneidliche) Aussage. Die wird nach § 153 StGB mit einer Freiheitsstrafe von 3 Monaten bis zu 5 Jahren bedroht. Wenn dazu noch ein Eid geschworen wurde (Meineid, § 154 StGB), dann droht eine Freiheitsstrafe von nicht unter 1 Jahr. <br>  <br>  Da du einen Streitwert angegeben hast, kann man davon ausgehen, das die Gegnerin sich ursprünglich wohl eher nicht wegen Betruges im strafrechtlichen Sinn strafbar gemacht hat, sondern dass es sich wom?glich um eine Streitsache vor den Zivilgerichten handelt?<br>  Dabei sind u.a. Gerichtskosten und Anwaltskosten, wenn nicht sogar noch mehr entstanden. Wenn du die bisher bezahlen musstest und die andere Partei nun doch "aufgeflogen" ist, kannst du deine Kosten evtl. in einem gesonderten Gerichtsverfahren im Wege einer Schadensersatzklage wieder einklagen. Dafür solltest du aber einen Anwalt fragen.|`|393deea993caf0eded06c11d5a6db3eeaa	Warum diese Frage,ihr habt gewonnen,die andere Partei verloren.Du legst es als Gerichtsbetrug ,was es war aus.

Die Kostenübernahmebest?tigung schickt die Rechtsschutzversicherung nach Prüfung an den RA und den Versicherungsnehmer. Da aber oftmals die Lage nicht eindeutig ist, ist es natürlich klug, den Rechtsanwalt zu beauftragen,  den versicherungsschutz abzukl?ren. Lehnt die Versicherung ab, sind ersteinmal zumindest die Kosten für die Erstberatung zu tragen. Falls Du weiter Leistungen des Rechtsanwaltes zwischenzeitlich ohne Deckungszusage in Anspruch genommen hast, musst Du diese auch selbst bezahlen.<br>  Es gibt aber Versicherungen, die entsprechende Klauseln haben, die dann dazu führen, dass selbst im Ablehnungsfall die Erstberatung bezahlt wird.<br>  Beleidigung und Bedrohung ist ein Tatbestand der Vorsatz bedingt, im Allgemeinen ist Versicherungsschutz dafür generell ausgeschlossen, eigentlich müsste ein RA sowas wissen.<br>  Ich empfehle Dir, erst einmal zur zust?ndigen Rechtsanwaltskammer zu gehen, die sind gerne bereit, bei Unstimmigkeiten zwischen Rechtsanwalt und Mandant vermittelnd und beratend weiterzuhelfen.

Spessissimo, per consentire ai mercantili di mettersi in salvo, delle minuscole cannoniere di poche decine di metri e scarsamente armate, si scagliavano contro 3, 4 o 5 navi nemiche per tenerle impegnate il tempo necessario affinchè i mercantili potessero allontanarsi. Per fornire un dato, delle più di 100 cannoniere che la marina Militare contava all'inizio della guerra, nel 1943, al momento dell'armistizio, non ne rimaneva più nessuna!!!

Il figlio, decise di vendicare la sconfitta paterna e organizzò subito una nuova spedizione. Se la guerra portata da Dario doveva configurarsi solamente come spedizione punitiva nei confronti delle città che avevano aiutato i rivoltosi ionici, l'impresa di Serse si poneva, invece, intenti di espansione e conquista territoriale del continente greco, al fine di ridurlo a satrapia dell'impero.<br>  Serse affidò al generale Mardonio la costruzione di ponti di barche sull'Ellesponto per traghettare l'esercito e l'apertura di un canale a nord del monte Athos per la flotta, inoltre curò l'organizzazione del vettovagliamento dell'esercito. Si trattava di una spedizione più vasta ed organizzata della precedente.<br>  <br>  Di fronte al pericolo i rappresentanti delle poleis greche si riunirono presso l'istmo di Corinto (481 a.C.) e decisero di costituire un'alleanza difensiva, conosciuta come Lega panellenica, sotto il comando del re Leonida di Sparta, ritenendo che fosse opportuno coordinare le operazioni militari e qualunque decisione di carattere politico e strategico. All'accordo tuttavia non aderirono Argo, Corcira, Siracusa (a causa degli scontri che la vedevano impegnata con i cartaginesi alleati dei persiani) e neanche le città della Tessaglia, della Beozia, della Focide e della Locride.<br>  <br>  All'inizio del 480 a.C. gli ambasciatori di Serse I si recarono presso le città greche (ma non Atene che non avrebbero comunque risparmiato) e chiesero che offrissero loro terra e acqua (γ? κα? ?δωρ) al Gran Re, cioè la loro sottomissione formale. Le città rifiutarono.<br>  <br>  Incominciarono le operazioni belliche: mentre la flotta persiana navigava verso l'Attica, l'esercito passò l'Ellesponto con un ponte di barche e penetrò prima in Tracia e poi in Tessaglia.<br>  I Greci riuniti in una lega si trovarono però subito in disaccordo su quale fosse la migliore tattica difensiva: gli Spartani premevano perché si affrontassero i Persiani sulla terraferma e lo si facesse all'imbocco del Peloponneso, presso l'istmo di Corinto, che nel frattempo veniva fortificato; gli Ateniesi ritenevano invece che fosse preferibile opporsi con la flotta. Sui due diversi punti di vista pesava soprattutto la considerazione dei rapporti di forza all'interno della Grecia, dato che la fanteria oplitica spartana era di gran lunga la più forte e un'eventuale vittoria sulla terraferma avrebbe arrecato gloria e potere soprattutto agli Spartani, mentre Atene avrebbe ricavato benefici da una vittoria navale, dato che le sue navi costituivano il grosso della flotta della Lega. Nonostante i progetti di iniziativa comune, I Greci si presentarono dunque sostanzialmente divisi di fronte all'invasione: prevalse il piano spartano, ma gli Ateniesi spinsero perché si cercasse di fermare il nemico più a nord. A causa di questi contrasti, solo un ristretto contingente si posizionò al passo delle Termopili.....continua....|`|W6NAkmSBaa	forse se studiassi sapresti che i partigiani hanno fatto la gloriosa resistenza per tutti gli anni della guerra in cui l'italia era alleata con la germania nazista che uccideva gli ITALIANI nei campi!<br>  VERGOGNATI!!!!!!!!!<br>  e forza con i pollici giu..nn me ne frega un c***o<br>  ah cmq trecento è basato su una leggenda

Sie wurde nur nicht verboten, weil der Verfassungsschutz Mist gebaut hat und die Beweisaufnahme deshalb nicht rechtstaatlich w?re.<br>  <br>  Aber das Problem sind nicht die Parteien, sondern ihre W?hler.

Am Beispiel der Grünen hat man gesehen, das sich erst was tut wenn sich eine Partei für den Umweltschutz einsetzt. Es wird Zeit das es eine Partei gibt die sich für diejenigen einsetzt die arbeiten, aber wenig verdienen, die arbeitslos sind, gerne arbeiten m?chten aber weit über 40 sind und keiner sie mehr haben will. Diejenigen die auf der Stra?e stehen weil die Konzerne die Arbeitspl?tze ins billige Ausland verlagern oder Teile des Konzerns verkaufen und der neue K?ufer den Laden in den Sand setzt weil er eigentlich nur an den Patenten interessiert war. Den Rentnern, denen st?ndig gekürzt wird, damit die Gro?unternehmen Steuererleichterung bekommen, für die breite Masse bleibt da dann nichts mehr übrig. Solltest vielleicht nicht ganz so blau?ugig in die politische Landschaft blicken und daran denken, man kann schneller arbeitslos werden als man glaubt, das altern nicht verhindern und h?tte vermutlich auch gerne mit 50 einen Job der einen und die Familie ern?hrt und last but not least auch als Rentner will man nicht nur von Wasser und Brot leben.|`|X0XgkzV4aa	Wir haben viel zu wenig kommunistisch und Marxistisch denkende Parteien im Staat.

Vielleicht hat auch die besondere N?he zu den USA eine Rolle gespielt, wo seinerzeit eine regelrechte kommunistische Hysterie herrschte. Wie auch immer, "Die Linke" ist keine kommunistische Partei.

e43b6e42489365436493bb48c6bb0ce2aa	It's amazing, and sad at the same time, how many modern liberals and democrats mistakenly liken themselves and modern liberalism to the Classical Liberalism of our Founding Fathers'. They just see that common word 'liberalism' and assume it means the same. They couldn't be farther from the truth.<br>  <br>  Modern liberalism is like you said, borderline socialism, aka Social Democracy akin to the European systems. Libertarianism is what Classical Liberalism is called today. And I'll take Classical Liberalism over quasi-socialism any day!!!<br>  <br>  Modern liberalism is just one step toward a paternalistic nanny state government hell bent on telling us what's good and bad for us, and will prevent us from those bad habits whether we like it or not (e.g. smoking bans and seat belt laws). Which is the antithesis of freedom and equates to tyranny, the very thing our Founding Fathers' fought against! Modern liberals are wholly concerned with societal and behavioral engineering in order to achieve their Utopian, classless society where everyone is equal in all respects and society is 'fair', akin to the movie "Demolition Man." No thanks, I'd be just like Edgar Friendly (Denis Leary's character) if that ever happens.<br>  <br>  Jonah Goldberg described liberalism perfectly in his book "Liberal Fascism," that progressive liberals will bring their liberal fascism with a smile; under the guise of a caring, sympathetic, paternalistic government. Again no thanks! I prefer my liberty and individualism, I don't live for the collective!<br>  <br>  Corinne S is spot on. Classical Liberals (aka Libertarians) are not unsympathetic to the down trodden nor are they greedy as modern liberals like to claim. We just think helping the needy is an individual or private charitable organizations responsibility to handle, not the omnipotent governments job to forcefully coerce people into helping. How is legalized theft by the government (taxation without compensation or any direct benefit to the taxed individual) from the citizenry not considered any less immoral than one individual stealing from another? For the modern liberal, the ends justify the means, no matter how debilitating the means are to individual liberty.<br>  <br>  EDIT: Boss H, if the government didn't use force to coerce you to pay taxes, then why do you go to prison or have your wages garnished if you refuse to pay taxes for services you do not benefit from? That is FORCE!<br>  <br>  And as John Locke points out, yes we enter into a social contract to form a government that protects our natural rights, but when that government does not adhere to upholding those natural rights or infringes upon them, then they have broken that contract. I don't consent to having taxes taken out of my paycheck to subsidize farmers or welfare recipients, but if I refuse to pay that, I go to jail or have the IRS confiscate my property, how is that liberty? That violates my natural right to life, liberty and property.|`|ERGGLvYiaa	They have nothing to do with each other. Modern Liberalism has chucked the idea of individualism & the right to private property in the good faith of what they now consider "Gloablism". Though I do think most citizens who follow such ideology are doing so in good faith, I say they do themselves and others a grand disservice by ignoring the hazards such a system brings in the long term. They see the glass as half full, but they ignore too often the possible motivations of those who supply the water.|`|iVv6bFW2aa	Classical liberalism favors laissez faire. Most countries of the world, subscribe to the theory ofn Classical liberalism. The US is one of the few countries that defines liberalism as left of center and that it advocates a mixed economy. Personally I am in favour of the latter.|`|9klx10iKaa	Classical liberalism is very close to current conservatism. Current liberalism is fascism.|`|9qKAy0dlaa	I just think you are trying to drive a wedge where you can't to accommodate your political philosophy. "Divide and conquer".|`|wnzK56fiaa	Sure - liberals.|`|u33x2hqzaa	No I don't but then again modern conservatism (baring of course RP) has little to do with classic conservatism.<br>  <br>  I do think that liberals have historic roots in socialism though.  Truthfully, in principal I'm not 100% against the idea of socialism.  I like the idea that government can step in to help people and redress inequity and social problems not dealt with in a private market.  However, that said, I do think that in practice it results in a greater level of control by government that allows for a dangerous accumulation of power over the individual and that it ends up serving the interests of the elite anyway and also that it applies controversial band-aids that do not solve the problem.  One of the things being discussed that strikes fear into my heart is a proposal to add yet a new tax on mileage use & track people by GPS.  This is big brother and it may well be foisted upon us by a so-called liberal (though really not) for a way to make ends meet.  I feel like a noose is being tightened around our necks and truthfully I'm scared.|`|TyI0jbcqaa	Classical Liberalism was popular with the Founding Fathers, and this type of liberalism did not mean big government, restrictions of arms, government intervention in the economy, etc.  Classical liberals can be compared to paleoconservatives - both were ideals of the Founding Fathers.|`|eafeb487799eda2a8dd4f1d8cb95f9c8aa	Nothing in common with each other.

I do not think that medicine will be avaiable in the new health plan though.|`|2MfFXmNMaa	No, not at all.<br>  Classical liberalism. I consider myself this.|`|Y7RbTYNvaa	Good one.  I really wish more people understood the difference between classical liberalism and modern liberalism (or what I call "neoliberalism.")   <br>  Neoliberalism is to classical liberalism what Neoconservativism is to true conservativism; that is to say, they are dissimilar, for the most part.<br>  <br>  Neoliberalism emphasizes collectivism.  Classical liberalism emphasizes individualism.  While both modern liberals and classical liberals may sometimes agree on some social issues, they differ on fiscal issues as classical liberals are traditionally fiscal conservatives.  I prefer classical liberalism.|`|c3vPZfghaa	Actually they do.<br>  both took their philosophies form the same political philosophers.<br>  <br>  Modern liberalism however, expanded to include philosophies of Thomas Green to varying degrees, which is the philosophy that right-wingers like to refer to as "limosine liberalism" or "nanny state liberalism".<br>  <br>  the idea that liberalism has changed, is nothing but a misconception created by right-wing pundits who want to make liberalism out to be anything that is bad. Its actually a marketing tactic designed to provide the same effect of a purge.<br>  <br>  i could provide you with a couple good books you can read to provide you with a view of what modern and classical liberalism is and where their views came from, if you would like.<br>  <br>  This is why libertarians and liberals tend to agree on many points with disgreement appearing in areas of help for the poor.<br>  <br>  The whole idea that liberals want big government while conservatives want smaller government is also a misconception promoted by the right.<br>  Conservatives actually support big protective government with unecessary bloated military spending, while liberals want that spending to help the poor.(these days there are only 2 types of conservatives really.... neocons and libertarians, or classical liberals if you wish)|`|QX2xnrhWaa	Classical liberalism, as it is the roots of American capitalism.  <br>  Modern liberalism can be tempting for some issues, but, overall, it does not work.  Modern liberalism implies a big government, classical liberalism does not.  <br>  <br>  BTW, in France, the term "liberal" is still used to describe classical liberalism.  Followers of modern liberalism belong to the left, which in practical terms there,means the Socialist and Communist parties.<br>  <br>  Edit: it's totally possible to be a classical liberal and social-minded.  The classical liberal who happens to believe that the poor ( or any other group or cause) should be helped will help them VOLUNTARILY and will encourage others to do so as well.  The modern liberal will pressure the government to force society as a whole -through taxation- to do so.  This process implies a big government and ends up making it even bigger, while the freedom of the citizens get smaller and smaller everytime Mr. Government gets involved.|`|jwTVz0q2aa	Most certainly not.

Of course, when you consider that the Republicans had Newt and Denny, and since then the Democrats have had Jim Wright and a dead man masquerading as Tom Foley (if he was really alive, he would've smacked those Repubs around like Tip did), it's not saying much.|`|KF48OjyDaa	She has twice the approval rating of John Boehner and Mitch McConnell, so they must REALLY suck. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.pollingreport.com/p.htm#Pelosi" rel="nofollow">http://www.pollingreport.com/p.htm#Pelos...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.pollingreport.com/A-B.htm#Boehner" rel="nofollow">http://www.pollingreport.com/A-B.htm#Boe...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.pollingreport.com/l.htm#McConnell" rel="nofollow">http://www.pollingreport.com/l.htm#McCon...</a>|`|7de370467c1bd78c2289f9e195b0bb85aa	NO.

Its pretty remarkable. I noticed this the other day when Obama was giving his address. Also, She looks a like a Pomeranian...that could be a plus to dog lovers?<br>  <br>  PS I live in the Bay Area (not SF) and I hates her too. So really you are talking about people with in like 10 sq.miles who actually like her in the entire country, yet she holds so much power...insane. Samething with Harry Reid...he represent a population of 600 people and look at the pull he has....kinda scary.|`|LTNLIT98aa	I googled her--and am surprised how little she's ever accomplished?<br>  <br>  Hardly any thing of noteworthiness since 1989--but somehow has been re-installed for six terms? Why is what I want to know.<br>  <br>  If someone can find anything good sh;e done--please list it...i'd like to know.|`|duXvWtmlaa	She supports not making it mandatory to learn English.  She is for the foreign population votes.  She has dumped the American way and laws in place.  I email politicians including her, just get stock letters back.|`|EzsnkxgVaa	She is a big mouth, vindictive, partisan, dim-wit in a position of way more power than she deserves.<br>  <br>  I am a Democrat...and that was me being nice.|`|7UqccTp6aa	Sorry all I can say is, she's a puppet. Obama only has to open his mouth and before any words come out she's already clapping.|`|cr5EoqVjaa	She is the worst Speaker in history. But many thought little or worse of Newt Gingrich. I miss Tip O'Neal - he was a caricature of himself.|`|hilEWrDYaa	She's a socialist sea hag.|`|AA12090570	I think she looks pretty good for her age?
ZZzQLjaKaa	In case you didn't know, the people of the Great State of Arizona have elected him their senator and would like him to complete his term. IF he then chooses to retire, there is not shame in that. But I will assume you do not really care about the real answer since you are asking a ridiculous loaded question. How dare you insult a man who if nothing else is a decorated veteran. He need do nothing else to prove his integrity.<br>  <br>  What is shameful is people calling others racist. You do Obama no favors by calling other people racists while at the same time saying you support him.|`|VELnLnIKaa	he will be fine he will go cry on all cindys millions lol|`|5ff6c450a0786035aba431374bf6fc0aaa	He'll go back to the senate and Maverick things up until his term ends and then he'll probably retire. |`|DYNaQ6Yzaa	I cannot believe you used Algorythym and integrity in the same sentence, what are they teaching you kids in school, he is scamming the world with his carbon credits, while he also consumes three times his states national average in energy consumption.<br>  <br>  While AlGorythym talks a big game, he is typically Democratic and does quite the opposite in his own life, ask Gore why his film has to have a disclaimer in many countries and has to be listed as "a political piece" not a documentary, inconvenient hype.........................|`|ipWRgKetaa	Integrity like Al Gore? There has never been a more self interested or resentful individual. <br>  <br>  But to answer your question regarding Sen. McCain, I suppose he'll continue to be a Senator as long as the people of Arizona continue to elect him. I doubt he'll go off in a frustrated huff like Al did.|`|xUQDTEbZaa	Put on his PJs and spend the rest of this days watching soaps...dinnertime at 4PM...bed by 7PM|`|AA10873763	Go back to the Senate, like he did last time.|`|3UTlASavaa	One can only hope that he will take advantage of the situation, finish his term in the Senate and take a well deserved and well earned retirement.  Someone who, as he did, fight to protect all of us and became partially crippled as a result of that deserves the best that we can provide.  It was a selfless thing for him to enter politics.  I believe that his legislative initiatives, despite the fact that I disagree with him, are heartfelt and untaken in hopes of improving the country and not his personal position.<br>  <br>  What integrity of Al Gore are we talking about? The ecohypocrisy?  The "I'm not really a candidate (wink, wink)" flirting with the media prior to the primary season?  The stunning magnitude of error misstatements in his alarmist books (the seas will rise 2, not 20 feet, etc.)?  The vicious attacks on those of faith?  I do believe that he, as well as McCain, believes what he says.  Unfortunately he does not act in a way to reinforce that belief.  <br>  <br>  |`|A6Xjzhdaaa	He is practically destroyed himself physically and most importantly morally with this negative campaign.. Most likely this is his last year on earth..|`|sS5abD8Vaa	you mean what will he do with the few months he has left after the election?...He will probably eat a lot of Jello and complain about how cold it is.|`|yynC47EMaa	Crash another jet?|`|JxYLnTGiaa	What life? He is 73... <br>  <br>  He will just fade away and probably spend his last days with family and friends. |`|zI3YXvGLaa	sell viagra like Bob Dole did.|`|kPWGVeWhaa	I think he'll retire. And live in one of his houses.|`|1f9ae62867e615825fab65d29d47f217aa	integrity?<br>  <br>  Al Gore?<br>  <br>  Al Gore is either the greatest monster alive, or a con artist/snake oil salesman who believes nothing he says.<br>  <br>  He lives in a huge mansion with a several thousand dollar a month electric bill, has a private jet, and rides around in fleets of SUVs.<br>  <br>  If he thinks global warming is real and still does this, by his definition he's a monster.<br>  <br>  I think he's a con artist.<br>  <br>  as to your question about McCain, he has already done more with his life than you, me or just about anyone else.<br>  <br>  Unlike John Kerry who betrayed his country McCain is a genuine american hero, no matter how you feel about his politics.|`|3CSPfJu3aa	McCain is a sitting US Senator and unlike Obama actually has spent time working for the American people and not just campaigning for the next office up like Obama has done all his life.  AL Gore is the biggest liar in History with the "Global Warming Myth"  The earth had a couple hot years from Sun Spots which have now cycled down to a cooler period and this winter will be colder as the summer was also cooler because Sun spot activity has virtually disappeared.  The temps showing higher amounts are from locations that once where in fields and now next to heat sources like parking lots and a/c units outdoor pour out hot air.|`|6c738af4ac776343f2bc535bba7907ceaa	Al Gore has little integrity but McCain will continue as Senator of Arizona until he retires...he seems like a man who can keep himself occupied without any difficulty...don't worry about him...|`|ci4m7YSNaa	I think he'll finish his term as senator and then retire.  And if he wins, I think it very possible he will only serve one term as President.|`|WjkVSWZRaa	Should Senator McCain lose, he'll return to the Senate.|`|eNl8GhPUaa	it's not like he's a spring chicken. all i know is that he won't be looking in the employment section of the newspaper....he'll be fine.|`|2259b1cc1a0608fbdc95dced2bd8bf0daa	Viagra spokesman. Like Dole did.|`|zSeQIDxQaa	Keep on trying to win, over and over again. Desperate and pathetic.|`|fBvhkalFaa	Not much.  i think this campaign is really hurting his health.  i see him retiring soon.|`|8c1a7d74e1a9bd82b06628aba8b6b6e5aa	Cindy and Sarah!<br>  <br>  Menage et trois.|`|pbeXkX0raa	he will continue to be a Senator |`|270c6c1779a03eafb25d7751b21ab80aaa	You mean when he loses.  He'll go back to the Senate.  |`|ZG62NNukaa	He doesn't have much left, so he had better act fast!|`|ycj8NdoYaa	Buy more houses.|`|bAwIlGpcaa	He will still be a Senator, and fight for good|`|l3L5eYj4aa	Ha!  You need help...|`|AA11861088	Take it easy and for every perceived mistake Obama makes, he can dust off the "If I were President..." speech.|`|713d09d4e24b6e6ced1f1de7fff7fc4aaa	He does not appear to be the type to just disappear so think if he lost that he will suddenly pop up elsewhere.|`|vEuY5rHNaa	Well, he couldn't shoot himself in the head or hang himself because he can't lift his arms past shoulder level. |`|dOGHH8luaa	He's used to losing.<br>  Maybe he'll try again in 12 more years when he's 84.|`|edglcOydaa	he could advertise frozen chips|`|Gresiesqaa	be in changed of a nusery home|`|e4596390515e8d11a71ef13fed732cc9aa	He can keep better track at how many homes he owns which he really doesnt know.  (and I read it's SEVEN)
UIueiJnZaa	Sometimes I think yes.<br>  If someone is in a vegetative state, and is suffering, then I think it should be allowed.<br>  It's not fair on the family and friends.<br>  We wouldn't do it to our own animals, so I don't see why we can't do it for the ones we love also.|`|12VQ4ETcaa	Yes.  If someone is deathly ill and in terrible pain, why insist that they keep on living those last few days or weeks if they don't want to?  Why punish someone who loved that person enough to help them end their suffering, especially if they begged for it?|`|jxg88KqFaa	Voluntary euthanasia yes|`|arZQTSjiaa	Yes, for criminals and drug traffickers|`|4mpO3i8vaa	YES!!!|`|iyEYXiq8aa	Yes|`|stEUrlwjaa	That depends on the country.  In money dominated society like the United States where the value of a person is frequently determined by the amount of money they have in the bank it would not work.  Euthanasia can easily become a murder to eliminate the inconveniently sick poor people, not necessarily the ones who are really suffering and whose lives are pure hell.|`|AA11705909	It should be compulsory for some people. Put them out of my misery.|`|8ZcGDTzOaa	It is technically already legal.  Doctors are allowed to prescribe palliative medicine that will kill terminal patients.  (Officially, it is called palliative medicine, not euthanasia, but in reality it is euthanasia.)|`|He5XWnJtaa	Yes, it is a victimless "crime".<br>  <br>  In a free society, a crime is the situation where someone violates another person's rights. There is no such thing as violating your own rights.|`|0fviV0lNaa	everyone should just write a living will. it's the easiest way to solve this problem. That way, those of us who are against it don't need to worry and those of us for it get our way.|`|XRYAfxpTaa	No.
6adAoU5Naa	I would say it depends on the circumstances.  If someone was raped which led to pregnancy then yes abortion is ok, otherwise no, simply because the people involved had that chance of protection, but hey this is only my opinion.|`|0v7Msiznaa	hmm this is a tough question to answer i mean if i got pregnant i would have the baby hands down.  I know a friend of mine who tried for years before she had a child but i think its really up to the person themselves it they want to do that thing.
gQYIphZtaa	  If they had video of him beating a prisoner to death with his own hands they would still defend him.|`|NS0LjZ68aa	Are you reading it "Alleged abuse of prisoners in Willacy County's federal detention centers." and "assaults on detainees."  <br>  <br>  How in the world could Cheney be involved by owning stock in a company?  I own stock in a bank, and I should be charged for what the CEO did or perhaps the janitor did?  <br>  <br>  Who knows, McAllen is a tiny town, a suburb about 30 miles outside of Dallas, where I live, and nothing is on TV local news.  Perhaps I should wait until the 10 pm news for the REAL story.  <br>  <br>  There have been numerous frivolous suits filed during the last 8 years and this is nothing. Since the AP is in the tank for Obama, anything should be suspect.   <br>  <br>  Don't make a big deal out of a small town prosecutor trying to get a better job in the big city...if it was the prosecutor who filed.  I take it as a big joke, but I'll keep you updated if big news breaks here. <br>  <br>  I think you stepped in it for not reading it.  <br>  |`|GFdppnFHaa	He was indicted by a Grand Jury in McAllen TX.   Do you even know where that is?   The indictment cites conflict of interest and misdemeanor charges for his investment company's ownership of private prisons and alleged mistreatment of prisoners.   Sorry to inform you it's not the indictment you haters have been praying for.  |`|2bb016b1e780abaa80d9a9bd66d8e804aa	And Willacy County is important because...????<br>  <br>  This means nothing - they have no jurisdiction.  An indictment from them is a kangaroo court.  <br>  <br>  Ask the question when Congress brings high crimes and misdemeanors against him.|`|olQeRW5Taa	Could this possibly happen?<br>  <br>  Marven G will actually try to answer a question rather than cut and paste the same diatribe over and over again into any question that has to do with politics?|`|Th0cGRctaa	wow - i feel sorry for the grand jury members and their families.  I wonder how many Dickless will have killed.<br>  <br>  He did it to Kucinich family.|`|bsU5Ar3raa	The Vice President is merely being harassed by obsessive liberals.|`|wrKJTMOYaa	don't sweat it.  this is a DA trying to make a name for her or himself|`|wNMQGkzLaa	Hmmm......well what do you know!<br>  <br>  We'll see how far this goes.|`|58607c6ba5c8f548e69203c94d723527aa	Well its a start. There are still thousands of people in government that need to be rounded up.<br>  <br>  Lol @ Amy. Wow this country is in bad shape.|`|5ac2dCxJaa	It will never happen Cheney bought a property in Dubai and cashed out his dollar denominated assets. Dubai has no extradition law so as so as he gets there he is literally home free.|`|bb5a54df57374dc4de372500ff862a7daa	And when Congress was one vote away from impeaching Bill Clinton - did those supporting him stop?  No they didn't.  <br>  <br>  It is pointless to bring these things up - Cheney will not be the first nor will he be the last.  It is not as unusual as you present it to be.  Do you recall the entire Iran Contra hearings?  That us just ONE example.  I believe they wanted to impeach Carter as well.  This is common and to make such an extreme finger pointing at one party or person is nonsense - there are many examples from both sides.|`|0f6a1cdae0a3ce3617b1109a091741bdaa	I would have to see the evidence before I could make a comment. I don't like Cheney, but I will not judge someone unless I know for a fact that something is true. I don't believe that any news service is unbiased...<br>  <br>  I will wait for the court to act.|`|BsQcplTQaa	Unless he had direct knowledge or ordered the policy he will not be found guilty. Nice try, but no cigar.|`|HI0oQriqaa	what's the matter now? sheeeeezzzzz!|`|meVH73dOaa	His name was brought  into it because he had a investment in several prisons. If you had a investment in a business, but did not actually work at the business and  someone got killed during a robbery, would you like to be indicted on murder charges, of course not. It is a big bunch of the usual BS.  You know how the media loves the new Messiah of the left, just wait and see, that new Messiah will be in deep...S before he is there a year. This is one of them usual BS far left liberal things, the die hard take down a Republican witch hunt.|`|Z5QL6THYaa	He will get away with it. If not on lack of evidence, a star witness or two would conveniently recant or move to Guantanamo Bay unless President Obama close it in time.  Don't start dancing yet.|`|utbfT0APaa	I must have missed this earth shattering news. I hear Dick Cheney is looking for a good shot gun caddy when he retires, you may want to apply. Nice try anyhow.|`|zqPjdhgKaa	I hardly call that a true indictment.  A county has no standing to truly do anything about what people say he did wrong.  Sorry, try again...  keep dreaming.|`|2fcfad55502ac06d4c0b54db7447b18aaa	All Bush has to do is pardon Cheney and that ends it.|`|c14d59914c10e59234c623e16b572f1eaa	Man I cannot wait until they indice Kennedy, Barry, Jefferson and Murtha.|`|0440336faf3bbaada17aec78b1b564b2aa	Wow.  i doubt that it will hold up.  Of course they will.  He's the head neo-con.|`|LvVlkQhDaa	Good <br>  
ciQFlpuLaa	the Globe Super-Market Tabloid also said that Michelle Obama is suicidal because she looks too ugly. can she sue her mother?|`|yprHJNHAaa	LOL...perhaps Bush is having second thoughts about how badly he did... that people have actually died because of his lies. He is paranoid...even the republicans are disowning him.  Steele did a pretty good job trashing Bush.  I don't think Obama has the time to even worry about Bush.|`|NcQVQiQMaa	LOL Even George wouldn't fall for that one.|`|A560oUeyaa	Just consider the source....|`|i7EcRQe4aa	Never heard of Bush for a while. He has lot of money he does not need to sue.|`|AA10482044	Bush is probably with Sue right now!<br>  and couldn't give a monkeys..|`|WCkOUF9aaa	Great source.

Gee, what a deal!|`|JLayHNZCaa	Nope, it is refreshing to see intelligent people in control, for a change.   Good things coming for the U.S. now that the Dems are at the helm.|`|hiCSVwchaa	No, I don't find it scary. <br>  <br>  If people are truly unhappy with it, then Americans will vote the Democrats out of Congress is less than two short years.|`|tFAKwsv6aa	We are all about to find out!!!<br>  I am very concerned.|`|fPMVuB87aa	no|`|7ONKVbbiaa	sorry, you make absolutely NO SENSE at all. <br>  One party.. or the other party.. is ALWAYS in control of the govt.

The people of the country are supposed to control the government, but it seems that's no longer the case...<br>  <br>  The fact that we're not a socialist country, and the government is trying to make us one even though the majority of the country is against it (very adamantly), should scare the living daylights out of everyone.  Will they go against the will of the people?  Did they already (stimulus package)?  Can we do anything to stop them?<br>  <br>  Buy a gun.|`|FSruw622aa	It is pretty huge that they control both the house and the senate and both with almost enough to over ride a filibuster, the president, and I've heard that in a few years some of the supreme court will be retiring.  Yea, it's scary that one of the two main parties has so much control.|`|JpvXhgmraa	Nope. I find it comforting in War Time, and a recession to see so many capable people, back in power in America.

Some people on both sides have certainly behaved badly, but it is time for all of us to recognize that people of good mind and good heart can still look at the same set of facts and have very different interpretations of what those facts mean, can draw very different conclusions from those facts.

The official government method of calculating unemployment is now not designed to actually count all of the unemployed.|`|33ppbrMJaa	The Unemployment rate in Michigan is around 12%.  Other states may be doing a bit better, but not much. The figure of 6% doesn't include those people who do not qualify for Unemployment, such as those who laid off before they worked the necessary time.  It doesn't include the millions of workers who have collected benefits and no longer qualify for extensions. It doesn't include the jobs where independent workers like so many who worked in construction and other jobs where they were responsible for their own Unemployment payments and just didn't have enough money to turn them in.<br>  <br>  On top of that, there are many workers in this country working in part time jobs or jobs that pay about a fourth of the money their previous jobs paid.  They aren't Unemployed, but they are Underemployed, but are not included in any national record.<br>  <br>  Neighbors of mine have told me that, when they put in an application, there is often as many 300 applicants for one low-paying job.|`|6a29fa9432cd11f6628b8d1ef1265ca6aa	No. They remove people who have been looking for work for more than 6 months from the numerator of the rate equation.

Some people have been unemployed for so long that they have given up looking. Others work part-time but are counted as employed, when they should be counted as unemployed. Still others work in jobs that are far below their skills and educational level (not to mention the pay level they deserve), so they should be (but aren't) counted as unemployed.|`|keN8vwCQaa	Yes, in the Northwest we cannot find people to work.

From soldiers dying on desert battlefields to communities dying as corporations out source jobs to cheaper labor markets, Bush has done nothing.  <br>  <br>  We as a country are at war.  But the war is Economic.  Sun Tzu was right, all warfare is based on economic's, and Bush allowed our enemies to buy the American Industrial Economic base right out from under the people of this country.  His tactic of trying to monopolize the worlds oil supply in response to the European purchase of major U.S. companies failed, and looting the tax coffers seems to be the Bush administrations only real activity.  <br>  <br>  His daddy broke the Savings and Loans during his term, and W did Herbert one better by breaking the banks during the last four years.  A little Federal regulation would have saved a lot of trouble, but greed got in the way.  The World Trade Organization, backed they the World Bank is who America is really at war with, the globalist economic agenda of these fascists, is what is destroying the American economy.  Our enemies use the greed of our own corporate executives to destroy America, and just like in Europe with Euros, they substitute dollars for bullets and conquer without firing a shot.<br>  <br>  This is why I am angry with Bush.  He sold out the American pubic.|`|BD7yd8D4aa	No. I am more upset with democrat "leadership" in congress that pushed for questionable loans to the economically disadvanted people to begin with.|`|LK3GOgS5aa	With no hearings the proof is solid and point to the Dems|`|xFeGxPtoaa	yes|`|diq9htpuaa	The problems are considerably more complex than you state.<br>  <br>  Bush's administration is responsible for most of the overspending, with the wars, with "rebuilding" Iraq (which I consider a thinly veiled ruse to channel billions into the pockets of Haliburton), and giving away the wealth of America to other cronies and foreign governments.<br>  <br>  Bush flatly refused to do anything at the beginning of the mortgage crisis.<br>  <br>  Many people could actually afford their homes when they took out the mortgages, but with taxes spiralling, and costs of everything else skyrocketing, they became unable to afford the mortgage payments.<br>  <br>  Some people's property taxes alone have gone up more than 400% this year!      And noone in government, federal, state or local tries to reduce taxes and government waste.<br>  <br>  Bush didn't do anything about the rise in energy costs, either.<br>  <br>  The oil companies instantly raise prices on gasoline that was paid for at much lower rates months before, and that's how they make the windfall profits, at the expense of the American taxpayer.     Seems to me that this practice should be illegal; it's obviously gouging.<br>  <br>  Banks' greed was also to blame.     Instead of renegotiating the loans down to a more reasonable rate, they foreclose, ending up with houses that they can't sell, and the government could have forced them to renegotiate, but again, they failed to act.<br>  <br>  Yet the banks that were failing could still afford to pay execs millions.<br>  <br>  The crisis has much more widespread causes than just Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, Frank and Dodd.<br>  <br>  Government overspending and overtaxing has been the cause of our problems, and this isn't going to go away, as long as we have those politicians that waste our tax dollars uselessly.<br>  <br>  Bush is the head of the government, and bears the responsibility, yet men like him can never admit their mistakes or take responsibility for them.|`|2bb016b1e780abaa80d9a9bd66d8e804aa	Yes.  <br>  <br>  As a moderate Republican/Libertarian, I am pissed that this so-called Republican never once vetoed a spending bill in his first six years.<br>  He never once listened to moderate Republicans/Democrats screaming bloody murder about the impending credit crisis.|`|vFGojyBHaa	Angry doesn't quite describe it.

Xwg2BotRaa	If its a private house, the Land Registry will give you (for a small fee) a copy of the deeds to your grandmother's property.  I think you can also go to their offices and inspect them for free.  That will prove beyond doubt who owns the garden.<br>  <br>  If its a Council House, I suggest using the Freedom Of Information Act to get the Council to produce copies of the deeds (don't let them refuse - take it to the Information Commissioner if they do).<br>  <br>  Once you have proof of who owns the extra garden, go back to the Council.  The advice to threaten them with the Ombudsman is good, if it comes to it.|`|ASXeYOjAaa	Your grandmother forced the issue.<br>  -She insisted on doing this maintenance.<br>  -You aren't very specific but the context implies she did it with neither consultation with nor approval from the neighbors. If they take no action to STOP her, it becomes "hers" through squatting. It seems like your council has simply recognized as hers de jure what she made hers de facto.<br>  -The council insists the upkeep be done, so if SHE hadn't done it, the neighbors would have found themselves in the council's sights, no?|`|ec2ee9613c6bdc3dcad61f9d849d618eaa	No offense to Gran, but she shouldn't have been doing other people's gardening just because she didn't like the way it looked. It's their property and they can keep it any way they want. Surely now that it has been a year, they have no problem relinquishing it to her as they could care either way!<br>  <br>  Gran should stop caring so much about what people think of her neighbor's garden. It's not hers.|`|JEicBoq5aa	This is an intriguing situation.  I would advise you gran to go to Citizens Advice to get to the bottom of the legal situation.<br>  <br>  If the land is hers she could enclose it or use it to park her car on, or rent it out to someone who wanted car parking.

I'm sure neighbours won't care... your gran no longer has to worry and it saves any unpleasantness....afterall... they have to be neighbours..|`|jQBM2AGkaa	Sadly I think that the council are right. It must be upsetting for your gran as she likes to see things tidy, as I do, but she has no lawful ground here, and her neighbours do. It is lawfully their property and unless they're doing something dangerous/illegal with their garden, it is up to them what and when they do with it. <br>  <br>  I'd advise you to encourage your gran to leave it alone, else they could take her to court for trespass and potentially harassment. It's just the way the legal system works, and you can't fight it with the case of simply disliking untidiness, unfortunately.|`|TKDi70uTaa	that sounds ridiculous, the only thing i can think of is the garden does belong to her property on the boundary map. get a look at the map if you can. also make an official complaint to the ombudsman. the council will never do anything unless the ombudsman is mentioned..|`|aIakDSstaa	Im completely lost here, Your Gran was doing someone elses garden without their permission...surely that's trespassing??

Trees. hedges, etc. are natural growths.<br>  <br>  You are under no obligation to maintain a boundary division unless it becomes in a hazardous condition (most unlikely here) or if a danger to passers by.<br>  Talk to a solicitor, as I beleive that, unless there are reasons you have not described, the coucil is speaking out of its ***. (not at all unusual)|`|gvvHN58eaa	If your gran owns or is responsible for the garden then you cant blame the neighbours, who must have been told it was not theirs when they moved in. If there are any other properties similar in the area, why not ask if the same situation exists. The best idea would be to get rid of the grass and make it into a very low maintenance garden. Your family could help to do that. Leaving your Gran the minimum of work to do.<br>  Sounds hard I know but thousands of other grans have to do the same thing if there is nobody to help. Good Luck

Holding someone in a cell is not generally considered torture.|`|5d9pCmjyaa	So you're saying you support genital mutilation?

I especially enjoy watching republicans torture logic.|`|WCkOUF9aaa	Its different when Obama denies them rights for some reason. Hmmm...
QI74CxD0aa	Yes, I do believe that everyone's human rights need to be respected.<br>  <br>  But it seems to be the tendency of people to demand human rights for themselves and their own gene pool, while finding excuses for why some other people (including their children, disabled, and old people) do not deserve those same rights.<br>  <br>  I goes back to a limited ability to care about other human beings, especially those outside of one's own culture, religion, or social group.<br>  And there is a tendency to believe life is a zero- sum game, with any gain in safety and security to others being a loss to one's own.  That is a delusion  which promotes war and injustice and ultimately causes one's own safety to be undermined.|`|u23sBafTaa	Well I agree with the idea of human rights I don't think it is this nations job to provide it for the world.  We have problems to fix here that are very important or our people will be denied those basic rights.  I also think you need to understand that you can't help those who won't help themselves.<br>  <br>  John I agree with you about torture, if it is needed to save the lives of many, have at it.

It depends on the circumstances.<br>  <br>  Those who have been given the death penalty should have that sentence carried out. They were aware of their crimes, in most cases, they committed murder themselves, so they deserve to die.<br>  <br>  Health-care? I don't believe in universal health care, as it raises taxes. Nothing is free. I also think that the universal health care system is more flawed that what we have now. <br>  <br>  Abused and tortured? That's a tough one. If someone ever did anything to my child, you can bet if I ever got a hold of them, they would be abused and tortured. But, just without justification.. no, I don't believe in it. In torturing of prisoners... no, I don't believe it is right. However, I don't believe in special treatment of them either.<br>  <br>  Denied life's essentials, like food and water? Well, where are you going with that? Homeless people get denied all the time. However, there are many reasons why people choose to be homeless (yes, some actually choose it by putting themselves in that situation by their choices in life). For those who drank themselves there, or did drugs, and lost their house, family, life over it... they did it to themselves. For other circumstances, I'm a little more tolerant, and I don't believe they should be without food or water. <br>  <br>  Human rights is something that you hope everyone gets, right from the start, but some abuse that right. Like any other right that has been abused, it can be taken away.|`|9ylKx7sIaa	what would you do if you're interrogating a man who has info on a possible attack that will lead to many many deaths? torture should not be used lightly...but sometimes its the only way.<br>  <br>  just in-case people give me a thumb down...could you tell me how you would deal with the above situation. i would really like to know of a better alternative, because i cant think of one. torture should be last resort, but always an option.|`|mIj8hXGNaa	Mike Ingham, what do YOU do for this great British community that you speak of?

TGHckD8faa	Actually Hannity's 100% correct.  Many small businesses bring in more than $250,000.  Your fabricated figures just don't wash.  Obama is out to punish the successful, hoping to gain votes from the wealth-envy crowd.  We've only seen the tip of the iceburg, compared to what he's going to try to do to redistribute wealth in America.  He was exposed as the most liberal socialist in the Senate, and he hasn't moved toward the center since he got elected, nor does he intend to do so.|`|CM1dfztQaa	Interesting that CNN and ABC are also referred to in the first source you gave, but you only attacked Hannity, of FOX news.|`|58607c6ba5c8f548e69203c94d723527aa	The media can lie to fit is agenda.

Hannity is a twit, he thinks that because he worked as a construction worker he knows what is best for the average American - he somehow thinks that every average American is a construction worker.

I'd ask my employees to take a pay cut so that I wouldn't have to fire anyone.  I'd figure out a way to shelter my money so that I would fall underneath the $250K.

What I can say is that my mother owns a small business.  Because of a reduced client base in this recession, she has stopped receiving a paycheck from her business... just to keep the doors open and not have to lay off any employees.  She WILL fall into the 2% that you mention.  Given that she's not received a paycheck since October and has cut every other expense she can, when the increase kicks in she will have no choice but to lay off employees.  If it gets too much worse then she'll have to shut the doors altogether.  All with the turn of a key on her part, about 30 people will be unemployed.  Two percent may not seem like a lot to you, but when lots of the businesses in that two percent find themselves in the same position, you'll see the impact.  So, I don't know what Hannity's source is but my source is every day life and what I'm watching before my eyes.  My mom is close with several small business owners in her area, and many of them are in the same boat.  Go ahead and down play it all you like.  I hope for your sake that you're not employed by one of the businesses in that two percent.|`|AA11326877	That is what he does.  The man has nevered uttered a correct fact in his life.

Obama is a decent man.<br>  <br>  I think Obama will get us out of Iraq, but might go into Pakistan (I think the Bush administration thinks this as well, and they are going into Pakistan now to make it seem like their idea, not to mention their horrible realization that they have just a few months left to get Osama bin Laden).<br>  <br>  I think Obama is more likely to hold bailout recipients accountable than McCain or Bush.  I also think Obama is more likely to work towards a balanced budget than either McCain or Bush.  The bailout and general economic situation will make this hard if not impossible for any administration...but in recent memory, it seems the only President or party to make significant inroads on our deficit was Clinton and the Democrats.  (Why do Republicans label Democrats as tax-and-spend politicians when our national debt situation clearly shows the opposite over the last 30 years?)<br>  <br>  I think Obama is more likely to follow through with a comprehensive new energy program than McCain.  Neither candidate is taking this issue as seriously as I would like (before the bailout, this was my #1 topic, and I think the way we treat this issue could say much about how quickly we recover from this economic crisis), but it's harder to believe a Republican on issues of oil (a finite and shrinking resource, no matter what you read), alternative energy, and *gasp* climate change.<br>  <br>  I think Roe v. Wade will still be with us, possibly with either candidate, but more likely with Obama, simply because Obama and his VP would leave it as-is (Palin, though, would try to change it if she became President).  Frankly, though, other topics have become much more important in this election cycle.<br>  <br>  I think the Patriot Act will be repealed, or at least revised extensively with a serious reduction of federal powers, under Obama.<br>  <br>  I think people who write prediction lists like yours and mine ought to copy them and stick them in the corner of their bathroom mirrors.  In four years, the person with the list that is farthest from the truth should consider *really listening* to people with opposing views, and give those views a chance.|`|ssK4oJi9aa	as president you do not have the kind of dictatorial powers that would be necessary to carry out your electioneering promises, and that is why it is so easy to make promises. you are not allowed to keep them.|`|pNUtnoC8aa	I only agree with number 2 and 14.|`|sg2UdK5haa	No, Obama will be a very good president who will lead with   calm and thoughtful decisions.  <br>  <br>  you might want to see a professional about your paranoia though.|`|AA11280073	You need to get fitted for a new aluminum foil hat.

I think there will be a lot of unhappiness in the country in a very short time when the economy really takes a nose dive and people realize they have elected a closet Marxist to the highest office in the land. I only hope that we will still have some news outlets operating that won't give them a free ride when they start screwing around with the law and the constitution. I think we are going to all live in interesting times in the next four years.
u2rKccbXaa	I think she's in a 3 way "pickle" right now! Since Stevens was found guilty,she has to go against him just before the election.But I agree she's hypocritical.<br>  And her defense for her $150,000 wardrobe is to give it away.Why not auction it for charity.(??) Well,again the money didn't come out of her pocket.<br>  I'm wondering why she hesitated for so long,seems the Governor of Alas-KA, would have been following the story.I hope she doesn't have any pals with the oil companies.Though she seems to be intent on "drill baby drill". <br>  She has to be careful: she needs to get into the White House,maybe she already has in mind ,what friends she will fly in from Alas-KA such as:<br>  Along with David Neiwert, Blumenthal has a new article on Salon.com about Palin and the secessionists. Here's some interesting points:<br>  <br>  Walter Hickel, who served as governor of Alaska under the Alaskan Independence Party's banner before switching back to the GOP, was co-chair of Palin's gubernatorial campaign. <br>  Mark Chryson, a former AIP state party chair, has been a key political ally to Sarah Palin. Chryson, who has a cheery disposition, is a bit of a political nutjob. For example, he not only  supports Alaska's secession from the union, he also thinks the wrong side won the civil war. <br>  In Palin's first mayoral campaign, she called herself "the Christian candidate," implying that her opponent, John Stein, was Jewish. (Stein was actually Lutheran.) <br>  >|`|tCyIhaneaa	Absolutely... even though Stevens broke the law and she didn't doesn't make any difference. They both abused their office.|`|wEuLf8yTaa	Far as I know she hasn't  She said he will do what is best for Alaskans and he will  Right now he has the right to appeal and after that will be time to do something|`|Q7iXZlRqaa	BLIND BLIND BLIND...THERE IS NO HOPE FOR YOU!<br>  <br>  |`|sQsl1r5Yaa	Nope.

She is a scheming tough and mean person.|`|3UTlASavaa	In addition to Teekno's answer I would point out that when she ran for Governor she targeted Stevens and his ilk as corrupt.  Again she has broken no laws according to the review which said she abused her power (although how you do that without breaking laws is kind of beyond me).  Stevens, of course was no only indicted (which she is not) but convicted.  If, on the other hand, you don't understand our system of justice, you would obviously assume that an accusation is the same as a conviction.  That is the hallmark of socialistic/communist governments.  You seem well on your way...|`|Qmgn6JHLaa	Well, I do agree that there's hypocrisy here.

tsCsNDIsaa	Doesn't matter. If people liked what he had to say, he would have won the Presidency. There are NO NEW IDEAS coming from him, or his party, and its kinda pathetic. Obama might not have all the answers, but at least he's TRYING to come up with something besides the same-o same-o. What's wrong with improving education, fixing infrastructure, health care reform? Bobby Jindal hasn't even fixed the broken levee in his own state, and wants to refuse stimulus money. Katrina anyone? That's all the GOP can say...."cut taxes" (for the rich) The tired ol' 'trickle down economics' has not worked.  Frankly, I've been 'trickled down' on enough!!!!|`|A560oUeyaa	MSNBC and CNN are getting desparate for something to distract from reality that Obama has been creating.|`|CvoyIESkaa	The media can't help themselves.

t3QAaSN9aa	Arguably we were out of the Great Depression in 1937 and then into a recession. |`|CmG8oTH0aa	The same thing that brought us out of the depression has destroyed our country.<br>  <br>  The Military-Industrial Complex.  What don't you understand about that?|`|r2JPcUN8aa	World War II changed the world forever.  1937 was the first year that the country was coming out of the depression, so congress decided to raise taxes on the middle class and thus screwed the recovery.   Conditions in the 1930's were very different from the conditions today.  Had Hoover first responded to the potential for disaster in 1929/1930 with a credible plan, things would not have been so painful.  It took four years of ignoring the problem before intelligent people came up with a plan that would work.  That was the Democrats. |`|VNcxe3Hnaa	Look up FDR's First New Deal and Second new Deal...

As long as you aren't doing anything wrong then it shouldn't matter, right? It's all for protecting us from ourselves right? Besides, I love having my liberties raped and my Constitution slaughtered...|`|U2qRvH2laa	Yes, but question how stealth it is, I guess if one were to lack worldly experience they may not see it.|`|YsQQ30YJaa	I oppose the Obama administration period!|`|fPMVuB87aa	if he did it, wow, it would only compliment the USA PATRIOT ACT
KTM5JEkLaa	I am not a republican, but a conservative Libertarian, and I see it as a perfect example of excessive government power and spending.  When someone can show me in the Constitution where it gives the authority of the federal government to regulate the substances one can put into their body, especially substances that never cross state lines through interstate commerce, then I may change my mind.  While I don't advocate use of illegal drugs, that isn't my choice to make for you.|`|1UDDfDi6aa	Decriminalize the street drugs let people shoot as much skag as they want and when they hit the emergency room in OD mode make sure they take a number and take a seat.  If they personally decide to destroy their lives so be it let them bear the consequences.  Take 20% of the funds used to support the "war on drugs" and use it to educate people on this failed life style.  <br>  <br>  This sure would cut down the street crime with Coke selling for $5.00 a gram now wouldn't it.  Could say that corner was worth lets say a life term prison sentence because you shot someone to control it.  No cash flow problem because there ain't much cash flow,  this changes the direction and we can all try some other approach.  This one ain't working.|`|JpvXhgmraa	I'm not even a  Repub and I can answer this. I know that Crack is a bad drug, that people get hooked on, and will rob, and kill, and steal from people to get it. On the other hand..........Children's Aspirin....not so much.<br>  <br>  In other words, you can't just let durgs, like Crack go on the streets, for everyone to get hooked on.|`|zXq4NYXvaa	There was never been any war on drugs.  It simply created jobs for the friends of the president.  Let me ask you, have you seen a decline in the drug usage in this country.  Even after this "war" was declared, meth was introduced...|`|kVTryKlBaa	I think they have gone a bit overboard.  When one is put in jail for more time for smoking a joint than someone does for stealing a car, something is wrong. Coke, crack, heroin, meth are deadly, but there is some lead way in pot.  It's not that different and a case of beer.|`|E6EbbZXzaa	Yes. Personally I'd be in favor of legalizing drugs. I don't think it's the government's responsibility to protect us from ourselves. I also think that if you're dumb enough to fry your brain with drugs you deserve what you get.|`|mFa5ZDtcaa	Perfect example. It has never shown any indication of working and the standard defense is "We need more money!".<br>  <br>  The basic strategy of the War on Drugs has not changed in almost 40 years. I don't know if anyone even knows how many people have been arrested, convictd and sent to jail or had their lives ruined for non-violent drug offenses. No one can say how many hundreds of billions of dollars has been spent by local, state and federal agencies in battling drugs or prosectuing and incarcerating people.<br>  <br>  One thing is for sure, the situation along the border and in Phoenix is any indication, we about to lose.|`|9klx10iKaa	Well, your argument would rationalize against any form of law enforcement or military force. Guess your argument is irrational.|`|4b9a85a6035089657723b2a7f272c834aa	Yep. The "War on Drugs" is pointless. If the government legalized all drugs, they could then make a massive tax revenue from their sale (much like tobacco). Then we would be able to lock up real criminals in our prisons, instead of drug offenders. Then treatment clinics could open up if people want to rid themselves of their addiction, which would create more jobs.|`|YkZeA3Jvaa	Yes, and it was one thing about the Reagan Administration that I disagreed with.  But, again, you have to consider the Congress that allowed him to do it.|`|AA12104896	Even more ironic because the people the Republicans considered allies, Pinochet and the contras, were smuggling drugs into the US the entire time they were fighting their little war on drugs.|`|dHjya1Yoaa	I consider it more along the lines of Big Government that DOESN'T work... :/
9VRwBeATaa	Stephen Harper's approval rating is in the low 30s last I checked. He's Conservative so I'm not surprised with why he didn't act on the economy sooner. He did manage to release bailout money but only after being threatened by the Liberal party with a coalition. <br>  <br>  Conservatives and Liberals will always have their differences.|`|HuGF2h2Laa	Two people at my job have been laid off because of the economy. I am struggling to pay for rent and feed myself properly. A whole bunch of us are effected.<br>  Lots of people here are crazy about Obama, but personally I don't care. He's a president. Society and consumerism have made him into a celebrity. He's ....the president. Wow. Great. Just because he's black, why does that mean he's going to be a revolution for you guys?<br>  I hate Stephen Harper.

bjmmAwo6aa	Actually, what we are experiencing now is the result of nearly 20 years of failed Republican "trickle down" policies, with a brief respite w/ Clinton - who was really more of a centrist than a Democrat.  It was definitely a referendum on the far right - I mean we had 8 years of "born again" Christian leadership and where did it lead us?  Into 2 wars built on lies, a degraded public education system and a failed economy.  And for all their "Christian" values, our nation is largely fat, ignorant and rude.<br>  <br>  Looking forward to some change.|`|TY1PUI2baa	The margin of victory was only 6%.  That is not a referendum.  The economic crash is the number one reason for McCain's loss.  He could not hide from the fact that he was part of the problem.  Obama has only been in the Senate for 2 years and has done very little since he's been there (besides campaign for president) so he really can't be blamed for the problems we are facing.  <br>  <br>  Let's get behind President Obama and help make America the success we all know it can be.|`|9ZiqmgGzaa	if it was people have no idea what the right is about that s bush s problem he did nt do anything right ( pun intended ) <br>  left wing education bill<br>  no right energy plan <br>  spend spend spend <br>  failed to stop democrat led policies that crippled fannie and freddy <br>  hope the new guy does a good job stearin us out of this mess <br>  oh i guess war on terror and tax cuts were a good thing bush did |`|QM2A6rBlaa	Well with both the presidency and control of congress, democrats now have no one to blame things on but themselves if it doesn't work.<br>  <br>  Good luck.

Most lay the blame on the republicans and bush.  That helped obama.<br>  <br>  Those who supported obama didn't listen to what he did not say in his speeches.  (They will be the surprises in the next four years). I still think the funniest one is the $2500 health insurance savings for a family of four.  Fingers crossed, that's how much the insurance companies will lower your premiums AFTER obama hands them $50 MILLION to improve their technology and make themselves more efficient.  Of course the amount you 'save' will depend on what the insurance companies and hospitals want to let you have. (Obama's trickle down health care program!)<br>  <br>  Republicans took the hit for the democratic senate not taking control of the housing problem before Oct.  It got way to far out of hand.|`|0440336faf3bbaada17aec78b1b564b2aa	Indeed it was.  Right wing politics showed that is in its death throes this election.  The ineptitude of the George W.

I suggest you speak to the recruiters at your local recruiting office.<br>  You can't be posted abroad until you are 18 years old and some front line jobs are not available to women. |`|NlAi17XXaa	Well I'm you're a girl, in which case you can't be deployed to the frontline. There are some jobs you can do where you can see a bit of action though, things like combat medical technician (medic), or an interpreter (if you fancy trying Arabic, don't worry the army will teach you), and some other stuff, go to an army careers office.

LPO8RlVdaa	Do not worry about him, he has chosen an excellent and very rewarding career choice. Im ex infantry so I went through the same thing.<br>  <br>  First of all his requirements would depend on what he wanted to do. <br>  <br>  A basic squaddie can go in with basic GCSE's, if he wanted to train as an officer, he would need a degree. I would seriously reccomend getting some quals before he went in or at least training for them once he was in there.<br>  <br>  Second if he wants to be infantry (as in 'fight') he would need to be physically fit. A mile and a half run in 10 mins 30 secs is the base level of fitness, plus basic upper body strength, (he would need to be able to do 10 push ups/pull ups at least).<br>  <br>  The crap caps (i.e REME's, chefs, trades and so on) require less physical fitness but require specific training, quals before he went in would help with this but he can train in there.) <br>  <br>  Second of all hun, do not worry. You sound like you are really close and that will always give him something to fight for and come back home to! He will come out a much much better man than he is now and you will have a brother that you can be really proud of. (Not that you don't now!) He has chosen an honourable career path and he will be well looked after. I think a recent army advert said it best, 'you have a helmet to protect your head, armour to protect your body, and your mates look after your back'. That sums up the infantry perfectly with only one ommission, 'you also have a shedload of firepower to help you out too!'<br>  <br>  Tell him to go to his nearest AFCO (forces career office) and have a chat with the lads there, they will give him a LOT of options that he may never have thought of. You can go down too, and they will be able to allay your fears a lot better than I can.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps, and good luck to you both!|`|wUQ51VBdaa	my brother wanted to as well... i think he tried it for a few weeks in the cadets and didnt want to in the end.<br>  im sure he will be fine, my bro now does moto cross and i have been to watch him and i think i would rather him be in the army! lol the amout of times he falls off and goes flyin in the air!<br>  <br>  =]<br>  dont worry. <br>  i think these days u can apply online and order forms to fill in online...<br>  |`|txGRbdLSaa	Hi,<br>  Good on you for caring so much about your brother. <br>  My son is 19 and in the Army Infantry, we are very proud of him and yes we do worry about if the worst should happen to him. It's only natural.<br>  His younger brother and sister (15 & 8 years old) worried quite a lot at first, now the pride has taken over.<br>  If your brother really wants to join up then I'm sure he would be very grateful for your support.<br>  He will need a good level of general fitness (no need to pump iron or anything too extreme), it's mainly endurance.<br>  He can apply at any time, just pop in to his local Army Careers Office and they will be only too pleased to advise him.<br>  In our opinion, the Army has built on our son's character making him a lot more confident and outgoing. Yes, there is a risk he may be killed whilst doing his duty, but he could also be killed crossing the street. You have to put it into perspective.<br>  I wish your brother luck in whatever he decides and hope you will support him as family support is very important to squaddies when they are on a Posting.|`|ec75e725937fc92000f2745410651420aa	Its his decision, tell him how you feel about it but respect the decision he makes.<br>  <br>  go to the website below.

Citing two unnamed administration officials, the Associated Press reported: "The US military would leave behind a residual force, between 30,000 and 50,000 troops, to continue advising and training Iraqi security forces. Also staying beyond the 19 months would be intelligence and surveillance specialists and their equipment, including unmanned aircraft."<br>  Moreover, it appears that "combat troops" may remain in Iraq with the Pentagon merely changing their designation to support units. The New York Times quoted military officials as saying that "they did not know how many combat troops would stay behind in new missions as trainers, advisers or counterterrorism forces, at least some of whom would still be effectively in combat roles."<br>  The Times continued: "Military planners have said that in order to meet withdrawal deadlines, they would reassign some combat troops to training and support of the Iraqis, even though the troops would still be armed and go on combat patrols with their Iraqi counterparts."<br>  The Los Angeles Times quoted a senior military officer who seemed to suggest that the withdrawal timetable was really of secondary importance.<br>  "The thing I would pay attention to is what will remain," said the officer. "The key decision for the president is: what is that force and what specific duties does it have?"<br>  The officer added, "When President Obama said we were going to get out within 16 months, some people heard ‘get out' and everyone's gone. But that is not going to happen."<br>  The time frame for even the limited withdrawal is three months longer than the 16 months that Obama promised during the 2008 campaign, an apparent concession to opposition from Defense Secretary Robert Gates; Gen. David Petraeus, the Central Command chief; and Gen. Ray Odierno, the senior commander in Iraq, who sought to keep a large force longer in Iraq.<br>  All three of these figures were placed in their positions by the Bush administration and are identified with the military "surge" that saw a US military escalation in Iraq and an increase of troop levels by 30,000, beginning in 2007.<br>  In retaining both Gates and the military commanders, Obama has assured an essential continuity with the overall militarist strategy that was developed under the Bush administration.<br>  In an important tactical change, it has opted for its own surge in Afghanistan, having announced the decision to send an additional 17,000 troops to combat the insurgency in that country. This deployment is seen as only the first installment on what will be a major escalation.<br>  The drawing down of US forces in Iraq is being driven in no small measure by the ratcheting up of the US intervention in Afghanistan. Two of the brigades that are being sent to Afghanistan had previously been slated for deployment in Iraq.<br>  Yet, as the Obama administration escalates the war in Afghanistan, while increasingly extending the intervention in the region across the border into Pakistan, the occupation and the killing in Iraq will go on. That is the real significance of Obama's plan.<br>  Even as the administration prepared to announce its plan, four more US troops died in Iraq, three killed by insurgents in Diyala province Monday and another shot to death by uniformed Iraqi policemen in Mosul on Tuesday. In the second incident, an Iraqi interpreter was also killed, while three US soldiers and a second interpreter were wounded.<br>  The mission of the US military left behind in Iraq will not be confined merely to training, protection of US interests and "anti-terrorism" operations. With a continued monopoly over air power and heavy artillery in the country, it will remain the dominant force, with the Iraqi army functioning essentially as a US puppet force.<br>  The essential mission of the US troops, whether they number 50,000 or more, will remain the one they were given with the invasion of Iraq nearly six years ago—the neo-colonial subjugation of one of the most oil-rich nations on the planet.<br>  The Obama administration continues to pursue this goal—albeit by somewhat altered means. Its aim, like the Bush administration before it, is to secure a strategic advantage over US imperialism's principal economic rivals in Europe and Asia by establishing hegemony over key energy supplies upon which they depend.<br>  <a href="http://www.wsws.org/articles/2009/feb2009/pers-f26.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.wsws.org/articles/2009/feb200...</a>|`|1ce25e71aa4dd2eb1e82121617a06b87aa	He's not.<br>  <br>  He won't "loose" Iraq on his watch.<br>  <br>  He lied.<br>  <br>  The Dems lied in 2006.|`|WCkOUF9aaa	Sure why not?|`|JLayHNZCaa	I believe he will attempt to, like all rational people, he will evaluate the situation as the time comes up to see if it can be accomplished in an appropriate manner.

5fabd1dde8996146708da2f18d2feea8aa	Election laws are, by law, made by state legislatures, not by the federal fovernment.  Under Florida law, recounts in statewide elections must be statewide recounts -- not selected recounts called for by the loser.  Gore demanded recounts of Palm Beach, Broward and Miami-Dade counties -- three heavily Democratic counties.  The Supreme Court did not "decide" the election in 2000.  It simply said the recount must be conducted under Florida law: Recount all the counties, NOT just those demanded by the Gore camp. <br>  <br>  There is no other argument.  A statistical recount sponsored by the Miami Herald, the New York Times, and supervised by Price Waterhouse/Coopers showed that Bush won.  Why do so many people keep insisting that Gore won?  He didn't win. He LOST!  He surely won Palm Beach County, but that one country does not get to vote for all of Florida.<br>  <br>  The Supreme Court did not have the option of refusing to hear the case.  The Floirda Supreme Court tried to overturn the law and allow a selective recount. Gore and his cronies tried to "fix" the election results by recounting only counties that were heavily pro-Gore.  That would not have been an election.  It would have been an inauguration.

La verdad es que, si México no ha colapsado con tanta corrupción, es debido a que hay muchos mexicanos muy trabajadores y dispuestos a sacrificarse...|`|E1BZTw3Oaa	?No recuerdas que FECAL dijo que con muro o sin el los mexicanos seguirían brincando hacía los EUA?<br>  <br>  ESA es su "politica" de empleo....seguir exportando mexicanos al gabacho.|`|I6nopGJJaa	pOR ESO LA LEY ANTIINMIGRANTE QUIERE REVERTIR EL ASUNTO EN SEGUNDOS DEVOLVERLOS A SUS PAISES (MEXICO)PERO POR RAZONES POLITICAS PERO NI ASI SE DAN ABASTO<br>  ESPERO CAMBIE PRONTO LA SITUACION.|`|RWY0vZXWaa	Sabes el colmo de la ignorancia de FOX que cuando fué a hacer el ridículo USA, hablando que los mexicanos haciamos el trabajo que ni los ******, aaa no ese fué otro ridículo, pero bueenoo, cuando lo entrevistaron y el tipo dejo ver la inmensa y potencia ignorancia de la profundidad del tema, <br>  te dejo el link:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vv143EByPmI&feature=related" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vv143EByP...</a><br>  <br>  Cito a Fox porque en su sexenio México llegó a ser el primer país exportador humano en el mundo:<br>  <a href="http://www.estesur.com/chiapas.jsp?id=3447&pagenum=1" rel="nofollow">http://www.estesur.com/chiapas.jsp?id=34...</a><br>  <br>  Y si la nota que aporto Franzisco es más que elocuente.|`|VAxMajA4aa	Si, pero reclamalo al partido y al presidente del empleo.<br>  <br>  Es una labor de todos la migración, pero parece ser que este gobierno la ha ignorado olimpicamente, hasta el PRD, Que no es especialista del tema habla más del tema que misma Sedesol.<br>  <br>  Ahora bien los programas de la Sedesol, hay tenido poco avance junto con los de relaciones exteriores, ok, esta bien recibir bien al paisano pero no solo es recibirlo bien, si no también darle las condiciones de empleo requeridas para que pueda quedarse o irse definitivamente y llevarse a su familia, con condiciones dignas en Estados Unidos.<br>  <br>  Calderón ha evadido el tema por doquier, y las cifras siguen creciendo no hay mejoría en México y si hecho recorte en gasto público, que ha creado miles de desempleados, simplemente el no apoyar al campo Mexicano generó todo este desempleo, No olvidar que desde que se dejo de dar verdadero subsidio al Campo, las cosas han ido de mal en peor, más caciques, más importaciones de alimentos, y más migrantes.<br>  <br>  La política debe de cambiar, y ya no importa tanto lo que digan ciertas clases altas del′país de los flojos y de los nacos, esas son visiones, es es que es una visión simplemente inaudita frente a un problema grave y real...<br>  <br>  NI UN VOTO MáS AL PAN!
6vc0HLxoaa	I would say that you are an American... and on a personal note I feel that Obama's win should show you that I am too.   I am in the same categories with you with in-1,3,4,6.  <br>  <br>  I accept your challenge.<br>  <br>  I applaud McCain's fight for this race.  I have a grandfather who acts as if one foot is in the grave and another on a banana peel who is about 10 years younger than McCain.  But he did not let his age stop him from all that traveling and he persevered to the end.<br>  <br>  I am enthralled by Palin and her gallant efforts to be in that position after the many challenges that she has had.  If she could just come closer to the center just a bit I may just vote for her if she ever ran for president.<br>  <br>  I have heard conservatives speak about supporting our new president elect, such as Mike Gallagher, and giving Obama the benefit of the doubt.  That is all we ask.  We simply ask that you acknowledge that another addition to the American story has transpired, (this is not a dismissal of any other story) and to not allow your difference of opinion to blind you from the opportunity that is belongs to us all.|`|4a2b4c38598195f530e54c08fa3e232aaa	So what you're saying is, you won't be the bigger person here and start with yourself.  You will continue to complain and whine and complain.  That's your right.  But don't expect people to fall lock step behind you.  <br>  <br>  This is America after all and people are entitled to their opinion.|`|QI95S8pkaa	I'm with you,  I guess I'm a redneck as well,  there is no division of class in America.  Will not at least for the way this Government was designed.  We are all the same. We are Americans first. Anything else comes secondary!!!|`|3648e98700b8351146e2b5699bd638ecaa	7. i'm an a55hole.|`|AA10903642	One, Obama was born here.  The rumor that he is foreign born is just that, a rumor, that has been spread around.  <br>  <br>  Second, I am more a little peeved at the way this country has been going for the past 8 years.  And I don't just mean policy-wise.  Conservatives have called liberals traitors.  Ann Coulter says that she wishes that a plane flew into the New York Times building and killed all the "liberal" reporters, and conservatives rush to her defense rather than condemning her statements.  All liberals should die, right?  Bill O'Reilly says he wants the FBI to go over to Air America and arrest all the traitors.  All liberals should be arrested, right?  the atmosphere in this country has been oppressive.  It's not just been, hey, we have different political opinions, so let's argue and debate and disagree.  It's been, anyone who disagrees with us is a traitor who hates America and should be punished.<br>  <br>  After that, you can see how I'm a little bitter.<br>  <br>  So, until I am considered a human being by conservatives, and they tone down their rhetoric, no nicey-nicey from this gal.<br>  <br>  Edit: Case in point.  Lou says we'd riot if our guy didn't win.  <br>  <br>  Sigh.  There's just no getting along with some people.|`|uE6RQtQWaa	Your a conservative republican. We have just not seen any running for office since Ronald Reagan. Conservative republicans believe government should not run our lives. Smaller government = more freedom! Strict constitutional interpretation and the money you earn is yours!<br>  Just for example: I'm pro-life but can't control your opinion - just don't think my tax dollars should go there! I don't want to pay for it -  You do what you want with your money. <br>  Welcome to the "right" party.|`|uu61V847aa	To every fervent believer that holds Obama was "born here" - please provide the indisputable proof that he & his staff has not.  So far we've only gotten to see the admitted photo shopped copies posted on his campaign website as "proof".  If there's no issue, why did they use photo shop?  I want the truth (as I do about Bush's lies, 9/11, politicians & corp. involvements into all these secret, tight lipped clubs - such as the Trilateral Commission, Military Industrial Complex, International Bankers, New World Order, Bilderberg, Council on Foreign Relations, Freemasons, Illuminati, etc.). and our US Constitution must  be upheld (which states that the President must be a natural born citizen) regardless of any emotional attachment you may have..|`|09ee183ad811668a3a1b4dce30721af5aa	How true. How true. Now they want Unity. What were their plans if Obama had not won. Wasn't it riots and destructive acts?<br>  How do they expect us to forgive and forget overnight.|`|c2dfad4dc1f663f9f98d8667a84e7f6daa	I was going to try to honestly answer your question until I read "Obama hasnt really done anything yet (cept lie and cheat, he's not born here, but that's not the point". That shows your bias to a huge degree. #4 does not qualify you as a redneck. I'm a liberal who owns and knows how to use guns and I'm certainly not a redneck. |`|T7p9TYrAaa	I would make a party for retarded people, that lie... I mean, I don't care if you don't like Obama, but the fact that you call him a liear and a cheater is just senselessly stupid. Why you think he's a liar? Oh, wait, you're one of those people that think he's a terrorist related to the 9-11...|`|aa2f80403dc31ff8816cbe8c5d1bd389aa	You are a libertarian like about 60% of the country.|`|bgA9wLD0aa	i'm confused.  if you're being as objective as you say, why are you repeating lies about obama?  obviously, he was born in the united states, or he wouldn't be eligible to run for pesident; whether or not his parents were citizens is not part of the qualifications.  i don't recall that he's ever said anything about banning guns, and the vast majority of democrats who want gun control want just that: gun CONTROL.  you don't need an uzzi to hunt.<br>  <br>  the republican party started as a federalist party, with an ideal of small government and personal liberty.  it is currently controlled by a right-wing christian element that wants to legislate its religion, of which palin is the poster girl.  sorry, but i'm not going to join up with that and pretend to work for unity with people who want to control my personal life and beliefs.<br>  <br>  i despise the two-party system, and would vote for the other parties if i had that luxury.  but until the republicans return to ther roots, which i admire but don't agree with, i will vote democratic to keep the fundies from taking control of this country.  and i won't waste my efforts on 'national unity' with people who do not intend to respect my inalienable rights.<br>  <br>  you didn't give enough information to classify your party affiliation.  pro-gun is a classic republican stance, pagan fits best with the greens, pro-choice doesn't really indicate a party affiliation anymore.|`|u23sBafTaa	Like I said earlier today we have been called rednecks, trailer trash and hillbilly's, which show how little they know about how we live in the heartland. I would be willing to bet that the heartland of this country will survive with out the east or west coast and the city of Chicago, a lot longer than they can without us!  They might want to rethink their hate. We can ship down the Mississippi River to the Gulf.  We have the nasty coal companies and power plants. So we control the food and electric for this nation, we shut it down we still eat, and most of us have generators for power.  Hope they think about that tonight when they eat supper in their warm  houses!
0bca92964b851ca1b2f27db7faf7f57baa	Smaller government and spending cuts?<br>  <br>  Nah, makes too much sense.|`|cylb8em1aa	Yes, but unfortunately I think it's way to late for that.  <br>  <br>  <br>  I had planned on voting for McCain but changed my mind at the last minute and wrote his name in instead.  <br>  <br>  Welcome to doom, gloom, and the impending one world order.|`|644fe9633265c82afa8cdeb71d97a23daa	Why? Neither the Republicans nor the Libertarians follow him; why should anyone else? He's right on Iraq, but wrong on nearly everything else.|`|bmCInR5qaa	Yes, he needs more ridicule. |`|BuvQ8tuuaa	Yes, they should.  Had the right people listened to him, then the economic problems we face now would not have been quite as disastrous.  In fact, they might not even have happened at all....<br>  <br>  The Republican Party was irresponsible in not nominating him for President.|`|b3a0ff51ff5abf43910afdf0478e30f0aa	Yes unfortunately he will likely not run or be elected president. |`|KWhKwgsSaa	YES.|`|5Ho518J9aa	In a way yes, in a way no. He is too whiny and comes off like the crazy coot in the coffee shp. Kind of like Bill whatzizname from UFO magazine. He asks the right questions on that "UFO hunters" show, and it makes you go, "Huh" but then he starts going that one step further, and you go, "ohh boy"...you know what I mean? On The Constitution, he's right up my alley. It's the endorsement from the Klan that makes me go, "wait, why do THEY like him?" and stuff like him saying drugs like heroin aren't worth fighting. Why don't we spend the next 2 years coming up with a good third party and putting forth a decent Reagan Conservative, shall we? By primary season of 2010, we can have congressional candidates in office, 2012 a president. Lets leave the Nazis like Bush with Karl Rove in the Republican party.
jLxBvXZ5aa	Exactly!  Instead of people illegally entering the country.  If you come here illegally, what else would you do to destroy us.  We are Americans period, not whatever our heritage was.  I am proud to be an American.  We definitely only have room to honor only one country and to call this one our own.  We must protect this land not just for us, but for generations to come.<br>  If we wanted to model ourselves after Europe, then why are we here?<br>  Our loyalty should be to this country only, and to the rights and freedom represented by the Constitution.  Not to radicals who would change the meaning of it.<br>  <br>  Just say No to socialism and big government control over our lives.<br>  <br>  Yours truly,<br>  Carmen<br>  .|`|U50orfPhaa	Well seeing that 25% of our Prisons have  illegal immigrants-  I don't think the coming to America in good faith applies to what we are dealing with.     I don't think Roosevelt would approve or allow the drug situation to get so out of control either!|`|k6hicodfaa	In 1907 there existed no such term as legal and illegal immigrant.  Such legislation did not take effect until 1918.|`|9qKAy0dlaa	He mixed his xenophobia with patriotism very well...|`|TGHckD8faa	Roosevelt was right on the money in that essay.  Another, which is as applicable today as it was in Teddy's day is his essay entitled "The American Boy", in which he lists some of the traits that a boy must have or develop if he expects to become a real man.|`|2MfFXmNMaa	Agree with everything - kinda 50/50 on language. We don't have an official language.|`|q9D1mCJnaa	I believe I am an American, not a hyphenated American<br>  and thats one of many problems we have|`|715f1626818f5d62fcf3ef5c3b86c820aa	absolutely|`|vZe5DwRdaa	agree.|`|bARPX1auaa	I agree...too bad though that his nephew Franklin loved the bankers more than his country|`|c1566a746196b29f9589775543f6928caa	Here here.|`|fPMVuB87aa	I agree with him on the becoming American and becoming alleged to the US, since, why would you want to turn your back on the US?
ci4m7YSNaa	I'm sure they're already on the top of their game protecting him.  I hope no one tries it, but I'm sure that someone will give it a try...hopefully all who try get taken down hard.|`|3CSPfJu3aa	President Bush is still alive despite the dual enemies of Islamic Terrorism and Liberal hatred.  The producers of the movie "Assassination of a President" must be so disappointed that their how to kill Bush did not work.  Putting the face of a sitting President on character to be assassinated!?!?!<br>  <br>  Secret Service knows how to handle the security of our Presidents and if their is a President Obama their will be no need to intensify anything because they are already at their height of security with all these liberal nuts and other Terrorist threats of Today.<br>  <br>  The only intensifying would have to be done for a McCain Presidency and not for him, but Todd Palin.  The Secret Service will have to learn how to protect him in the midst of a wilderness race in the dead of Alaska winter on snow machines hitting 110 mph.<br>  <br>  The man who said White people are still racist this is for you.  You sir are the racist.  Is Rev Wright your pastor too?  The white people are 70% of this nations population and your half white half black man would not be close to the White House without the votes of a large portion of those white people you are calling racist.  Racist is the people who are giving Obama the biggest Affirmative Action pass in History and not checking out his background or questioning any part of his life or lack of experience and his connections to a terrorist and most despicable his 20 years in a church where what passed for preaching was racial rants against whites and God Damn America chants.|`|4c7xJ7oXaa	Well  perhaps a bit but most racist wackos aren't exactly stealth agents out to get the "man".   They sort of stand out in the crowd. Besides enough Presidents have been gunned down just for their ideas much less skin color.|`|JxYLnTGiaa	YES.<br>  <br>  We don't need any flying pitchforks hitting our President. |`|AA11861088	In my opinion, which may not be that important in the grand scheme of things, it could put out the image of America as being more open-minded and a place of social stability, to the international community outside of the Middle East. So internally, there may be the threat from racist groups. But they would see themselves as patriotic and if he is good for the image of America as a whole, they might think of the greater good and be less of a threat. Al Qaida and it's sub groups could be more of a threat and would explore the option of assasinating him to destabalise the country but try to pin the blame on racist groups to divert attention away from them while they plan further action and take the credit later. So, internally, no. Internationally, yes.|`|R9XE7IOoaa	I would have to say no because of the size of security details already and for the black racists no he hasn't secured the presidency (remember the Bradley affect and the polls are so close) and if y'all want civil war bring it on!!! Remember who won your freedom! You are too lazy to fight on your own and we have the long range and accurate weapons!|`|2Lte86aDaa	White people are still racist. They are scared because Obama has secured the win. He will take the whitehouse and they can't handle it. McCain represents many racist whites in this country. He will need security BIG TIME!|`|m9XQjNXjaa	I can foresee the liberal snitch stazi force and race wars right now....|`|8eeee84248737295c60d88565ceb0559aa	No, have you seen the security detail for Bush?

I have too heard that the GOP is asking for no more interviews. It makes sence because in an interview its not as easy to change the questions into something she can answer. Plus the Couric fiasco was probably a lesson learned to them. Did you know the part they showed was the best part?

IMSkR8Ajaa	Actually, socialism is the midpoint of capitalism and communism. It is where the government seeks to control the manufacturing/production sector of the economy but has not yet gained control of it. Socialism leads to laziness of workers which leads to complacency which leads to totalitarian regimes.<br>  <br>  No, social security and labor unions are not good for people. Medicare might have some benefits, but on the whole, it is just more government control of our lives.|`|2f8fcc269ee1c0aaa19aed69d01a15ccaa	And all of them have failed. Socialism demotivates society to achieve greatness.|`|1ce25e71aa4dd2eb1e82121617a06b87aa	"..common sense ..."<br>  <br>  To budget $4 Trillion, (based on a quick, strong recovery) when you only have hopes for less than half (perhaps $2 Billion), .... is common sense???<br>  <br>  Tell me another.|`|lvBUl3Zdaa	The anti-Social Security position is basically one of social Darwinism or eugenics, with a huge dose of schadenfreude thrown in. <br>  <br>  People like this want to eliminate the option of retirement from older people. They want to eliminate access to health care for the majority of Americans. They want more people to lose their homes and live out on the street. They want children to starve. <br>  <br>  They want people to die. They are absolutely sure that they'll never get sick or lose their job or reach retirement age and find their savings stolen by someone with an attitude very much like them. ∠°)|`|YkZeA3Jvaa	Because people who are in favor of it are constantly lying about it to make it sound good.<br>  <br>  Social security - I don't see a dime from it until I'm 67, and then it restricts how much work I can do on the side to supplement my meager benefits.  What a laugh.<br>  <br>  Labor unions are about to destroy the auto industry.  The UAW asked its membership to make some concessions the other day so that their jobs will still exist next year.  Even THEY are finally getting it.<br>  <br>  Medicare - don't even get me started.  My grandmother lived in a rest home for her last ten years, but the ranch she and my grandfather ran all their lives was still a working ranch, with the foreman overseeing it.  She outlived her money and when she went to apply for Medicare or be kicked out of the rest home, they told her she was ineligible since she owned too much property.  What did they want an 89-year-old woman to do?  Get out of bed, get on a horse and start rounding up cattle?  Medicare is GOOD?  Get real.|`|bVJSlo3Raa	Because they were told in the cold war it was evil.

Look at history. This is how it starts.  I don't think the government should dictate how much money I make or how much a hard working business owner should make.  That's socialist and it's wrong.  It's wrong for people who have worked hard to become successful being forced to pay more in taxes, especially so that 40% of the population (or 90% of Obama's desired Cabinet) don't pay their taxes.  You shouldn't be punished for success.  You should be celebrated.  <br>  <br>  As for your last 2 questions about Medicare, social security and it all being for working class people?   -  I think you're a little scewed on your views.  By the time I retire, social security will be gone.  Medicare will be no more.  We're using all of that money for the illegals in this country.  How is it fair that someone who has paid money into social security their entire working life not have anything because the American Government decided we needed to be "politically correct" and give it to illegal immigrants.  It's NOT fair!  it's wrong!!!  So, these programs that you're using to try to prove your point don't work.  What makes you think anything else will?|`|l5TKAStKaa	Didn't you noticed that they all failed?  Why?  Because socialism does not provide people the urge to excel.  Do you think the United States would have NASA, Intel, IBM, Google, Yahoo!, Sun Microsystems, Microsoft, Apple, and other advanced companies if it were a socialist country?  The answer is no.  That is why no American will every agree to any socialist ideas.  This country was founded on democracy and has excelled through democracy over the last 232 years.|`|xkcLOfTKaa	You are exactly right.<br>  When it is forced on you by the government, it can no longer be called SOCIALism...

It stresses that the control of the means of producing economic goods in a society should reside in the hands of those who invest their labor for production. In its ideal form, social classes cease to exist, there is no coercive governmental structures, and everyone lives in abundance without supervision from a ruling class. Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels popularized this theory in their 1848 Communist Manifesto. <br>  <br>  now does that sound like a cause for what you are blaming it for?<br>  the things you have mentioned are more likely to come from capitolism with everyone chasing money people losing jobs and general liberalness<br>  <br>  also take a double dose of your pills<br>  <br>  yes and capitolism hasn't done any bad things, especially america the good?<br>  <br>  and a question who is better che gurava or baptista(ruler before fidel) one a commie as you would call him and the other an american bed-fellow? who done things for the greater good of other countries?<br>  <br>  come on hurry up and answer you took no time in pointing out the attacks but cannot answer a question?|`|nzHtrczVaa	Yes he is and socialism leads to communism.<br>  <br>  Communism is the death of the soul.

One who hath yearnings For equal division of unequal earnings.

And we can't ever pay that debt off. The feds simply cannot tax folks enough to raise the money."<br>  <br>  And it's going to take way more than one generation to pay all of that off. Plus congress ain't even done yet!<br>  Here is what they got lined up:<br>  <br>  "Continuing Resolution" legislation to fund existing federal programs at $410 billion -- an 8.7% increase in spending over the last year which is the biggest increase on domestic spending since the Carter Administration. Currently being debated this week and next.<br>  <br>  Obama/Pelosi Housing Bailout at $275 billion. Proposed now and will be debated within days.<br>  <br>  Bank Bailout at estimated $1 trillion.

Anyone with half a brain can see that she is using him for her own agenda. That's why people on their own campaign are turning against her. I mean if you look at the speeches with the both her and McCain you would swear SHE was running for president the way she steals the show from McCain and he's too stupid to see it. I mean she just takes the hell over. It's ridiculous. I'm just about embarrassed to be a woman because of her, she is NO role model for me. How can you be a role model when the entire world is laughing AT YOU! :|. I wish she would f'ing wake up but that would be too easy. <br>  <br>  I wouldn't put it past her if Lord forbid McCain gets elected and she tries to secretly have him assassinated just so that she can take office :|. She's a trollop, trying to fool everyone with smiles and winks but the media is picking up on it and obviously slightly intelligent members of their campaign are as well!<br>  <br>  I don't support McCain but I don't think it's right what she's doing; HE'S running for president not HER she needs to sit her stupid looking behind down.

Here's a spending cut: I'm cutting special favors to those agribusiness guys who contribute to your campaigns!"

Vast majority of Americans 95%, will not be affected.<br>  <br>  So Republicans have a right to blame Clinton for everything the last 8 years, but Obama has no right to blame anything on Bush? Even though the economic recession started with him and the Iraq war started with him. You Repukes are living in a fantasy world.|`|THNvhp3Caa	The tax cuts were passed by a Republican Congress and signed by a Republican president.  They could have made those cuts permanent, but they chose not to.  The GOP determined that now would be a good time for the cuts to expire, and it looks wise that they did.  They should be taking pride in their foresight, not trying to duck the "blame".|`|e44b7050fb792247b231f218559774e8aa	Obama is cutting taxes for those who make under 250,000. It has only been in place for a week and I've already saved over 300 dollars!! :D<br>  <br>  Now the rich have to pay up something they have avoided doing for years.|`|FKDv6ycbaa	sooner or later the obama-bots will have to wake up to the fact that the democrats have ruined this country, of coarse it will be to late by than.|`|kVTryKlBaa	The media and left will portray it as so, watch and see.|`|CvoyIESkaa	Obama will be blaming Bush 4 years from now.|`|2MfFXmNMaa	Where are you getting this? Would just like to read the source as well.|`|LOyDAmyyaa	How is it a tax increase on everyone?<br>  Read turbo tax's quick summary & turn off your AM radio!<br>  <br>  <a href="http://turbotax.intuit.com/tax-tools/tax-tips/tax-planning-and-checklists/7108.html" rel="nofollow">http://turbotax.intuit.com/tax-tools/tax...</a>|`|q4EXFhV7aa	lol....the sad fact that you believe this I will blame on you, not Bush. You should actually read the paper or watch the news. <a href="http://www.bostonherald.com/news/us_politics/view/2009_02_26_Obama_budget_would_cut_some_taxes__raise_others/" rel="nofollow">http://www.bostonherald.com/news/us_poli...</a>|`|AA10546011	Bush will be blamed for everything for years to come...<br>  <br>  It's sad and dishonest, but true.|`|VS0PuI5paa	Well if Bush hadn't killed a trillion Iraqis and converted them to oil to power his evil weather machine that caused hurricane Katrina, we wouldn't have to pay taxes anyway.  Oh and he shot down flight 93 even though 9/11 was a hoax.|`|7de370467c1bd78c2289f9e195b0bb85aa	IF THE LIBERALS HERE ACTUALLY BELIEVE THE PART OF B. HUSSEIN OBAMA RAISING TAXES ON THE WEALTHY YOU REALLY MUST BE SMOKING SOME THING. THERE IS NO PLAN TO ALLOW ANY PART OF THE BUSH TAX CUTS TO STAY IN PLACE. THIS IS ONE THEY CAN'T BLAME BUSH FOR.|`|r2JPcUN8aa	Letting a tax rollback expire is not the same thing as a tax increase and 2% of the population does not equate to EVERYONE.|`|wz9szz3Gaa	Why not that is how Obama makes every move blame Bush. Now he is on his own on the stimulus plan he can't blame Bush!
BRyRtQSvaa	Yep...it's do different than raising our debt by three fold then saying he will cut it in half by the end of his first term......why do it to begin with? then you don't have to do anything. this guy is an idiot!|`|7UqccTp6aa	There is no logic to that man.|`|BHBQPFzlaa	When did he promise to cut taxes for those affected by the bush tax cuts? If I recall correctly, he never once indicated that the rich would pay lower taxes.<br>  <br>  Campaign Promise:<br>  People who make less than $250,000 will not see an increase. Many of them will actually see a tax cut.<br>  <br>  Address to congress:<br>  People who make less than $250,000 will not see an increase. 95% of them will actually see a tax cut. <br>  <br>  The missing 5% is those who are no longer going to enjoy the bush tax cuts. Their taxes go up.
ErTVzpUUaa	You got it!  That's how Obamas running his new regime, through the back door!  I heard he likes it that way!|`|c3vPZfghaa	Ok so let us assume you are correct.<br>  When taxes on capital gains expires, how are taxes on people who have no or very little capital gains to report going to see an increase in taxes?<br>  <br>  If Bush and Republicans intended to actually give you a tax cut, they wouldn't have voted on a temporary bill to begin with.<br>  <br>  and when they expire on couples with dependents making over $250K a year or individuals making over $200K, how will the a person making $70K a year see a tax hike?|`|fUh7LHzvaa	Okay...so whats your source??? You don't have have one? Surprise, surprise.<br>  <br>  *slaps my forehead* Dude, the tax cuts are ONLY expiring on households making over $250, 000. Get a clue!|`|7EkeIcw4aa	Hey Libs, get this! We will all be paying taxes on the extra $13.00 your God is giving us. At least when I got $1500 from Bush last year it wasn't taxable. There's your "change".|`|g3Yabux2aa	There's another lib term you left out "cuts" means "cuts to the scheduled increase".|`|bfB0luGQaa	Of course it's not, to dems. But, not increasing Medicare as much as last year, is CUTTING Medicare...|`|0PmOYIG3aa	ummm are you asking if the tax cuts for the top 10% of the country expire, will everyone have to pay higher taxes?|`|mlpYzrtvaa	Sure is Obama is lying again unless they are going to pass a low income under 250,000 a year tax plan, more lies the Joy.|`|2kgTdNRQaa	Your question sounds funny. You answered it.|`|hiCSVwchaa	The Bush tax cut that is set to expire did not benefit EVERYONE. <br>  <br>  It benefited only those earning more than $250,000 a year.
oVhKGw3Maa	Sounds like a hanging offence to me. Lets talk sense here for a moment. If you drive without a full licensed driver, your insurance is voided and what if you injure someone. Even if you get a bumper thump you will be years paying off the damages. Smarten up and wait, you have already waited 17 years, a couple of months cant hurt.|`|liLKDQu3aa	well i think its like having a learners permit.<br>  <br>  if you get caught breakin the rules then you have to restart the whole wait for a year thing, whether if your two days in or two days or way to getting a license.|`|hXQnR2Scaa	In most states, your Inter will be canceled and you will not be able to get your license until 21. I wouldn't advise it.|`|MOALBorJaa	Your intermediate privilege will probably be suspended and you won't get your full license on May 1st. Also you may have to pay a fine and appear in court with a parent. So not worth it.
1FkYHLXDaa	You are SO right. I am guilty as hell of that and I even get annoyed with myself. <br>  <br>  Government as a whole is the problem and we all need to come out of our defense mode and place blame where it belongs.......with every single one of them.|`|6J2kJHgSaa	"Wake up people, there is NO DIFFERENCE between Republicans and Democrats in Washington, for the most part, they are all COLLECTIVISTS working to end American sovereignty and advance a socialist world government." That's EXACTLY what I would have said!!!!|`|lwccQoEZaa	Unfortunately seems just bickering.. be nice to have an educated exchange of ideas with out getting hostile... we all have opinions as the saying goes.. both parties are just as guilty of pork etc... need to boot those.|`|cr5EoqVjaa	You're right. But there's no way to debate in a forum that doesn't allow threaded conversations.|`|uM1OoTVUaa	bickering only.|`|HZy629kLaa	Just bickering.|`|m0muVAXfaa	pretty much just bickering and ranting, so what's your problem Sparky?  Did I mention the insults?|`|jwTVz0q2aa	They're too stupid to realize that they are both controlled by Jews.|`|Nkwv2hygaa	Not too much debating, plenty of bickering.|`|u23sBafTaa	Some of both !  Some people get a little carried away with it sometimes.  It's a jungle just got be tough !  You are right we are all in it together and as much as it is said that the republicans are a dying party I really don't think people would want a one party system !|`|zNB3tZXraa	There is however a difference between liberals and conservatives. Liberals believe in socialism, and conservatives believe in the U.S. Constitution. It's time to take this country back, and out of the hands of the politicians that have an agenda other than the one they swore to protect when they took an oath of office.|`|VBunjbhKaa	People are just venting their frustrations and for the  record, it makes me feel better to vent.  Something about anonymity on the internet that makes people behave in a way they otherwise wouldnt|`|724634aa550e4f2aa216e83840f9e8a4aa	nice thought, but not going to happen.... havent seen a republican advancing socialism though...|`|fPMVuB87aa	I've seen and been part of some debates, in here, problem is that either I burst their bubble or they didn't want to hear the truth
WYPEG8l7aa	Foreign interests. Were getting something back most of the time its under the table not in the public eye.|`|kVTryKlBaa	Funny you didn't complain about the$900,000,000 we are about to give to hamas to buy more rockets to hit Israel with. <br>  <br>  <br>  I guess that shows which side you are on.|`|zXq4NYXvaa	Have you checked lately at how much in debt we are to China?  Get your facts straight.
j6Qa4DbEaa	Self-destructive. We can't even take care of our own people in our own country, how can we keep giving & giving when we have our own starving, cold, sick, poor, homeless....etc.???|`|XRYAfxpTaa	Israel is a nation I fully agree to support. <br>  <br>  I strongly disagree with sending a dime to Gaza where Hamas will find a way to convert aid to bullets and bombs.|`|AA10753086	It can't be Gaza and the Hamas because Obama is planning on giving them $900 million. I guess we know where his priorities lie.|`|7qRFw5fjaa	I would already have guessed Israel.  They have grown to be one of our closest allies.  If Israel has a need, if we can help, I'm good with that.|`|PBq7ODPzaa	I think supporting democracy is always a good thing.|`|0Y6CqSliaa	Oh, give me a break. Ifamericansknew is probably one of the most biased websites on the internet. It's basically packed with pictures of wailing Palestinians. That's a little something we call propaganda.<br>  <br>  Supporting the only democracy in the Middle East is good for America.|`|AWSmknxLaa	very very  good|`|alQ5wIVqaa	I don't think funding a terrorist organization, Hamas, is good use of my tax money.|`|5zJmqpMPaa	Good.|`|GgG0inaUaa	Money well spent. Maybe they should get a raise.
jwTVz0q2aa	This is a Leftist site.  They have a section for Gays and another for feminists.|`|cWmx0J4jaa	my guess is, they are saying, technically, you didn't answer THEIR question even though your points are valid.|`|eulMjLtPaa	Yahoo bots delete questions/answers that have been reported by others.  Yahoo has no censors.  <br>  <br>  The violation was that you didn't answer the question; I see no listing of cities that have reduced crime.|`|3ebb87ed0f276343bd04001d7c181545aa	As to why your answer was deleted, <br>  <br>  You did not answer the question asked.<br>  <br>  They did not ask a question about the 2nd amendment.<br>  <br>  They ask what cities have successfully reduced violent crime via gun control laws<br>  <br>  Your answer had nothing what so ever to do with the question asked.<br>  <br>  Thats why it was reported and deleted.<br>  <br>  You obiviously do not know how Yahoo Answers works.<br>  <br>  There are no moderators viewing all the qusrions asked.<br>  <br>  Yahoo Answer users are the ones who delete questions.<br>  <br>  Each Yahoo answer user is rated on the percentage of questions they report, that are deleted.<br>  <br>  Those with high percentages, can have a question deleted, just by themselves , if they report it.<br>  <br>  For others, it make take 2 to 20 people reporting a question to have it deleted.<br>  <br>  This is an automatic process, with no intervention from Yahoo employees.<br>  <br>  Only when you appeal a violation notice, does a yahoo employee become involved.
jwTVz0q2aa	They love Leftists, gays, blacks, Zionists, paedophiles.  All the bad folks.|`|2MfFXmNMaa	Because two people reported it and the moderators were too lazy to read it - they just sent the normal email. Happened to me yesterday.|`|773a0ef61688dd825e941d816e68d310aa	Because the Supreme Court is against gay marriage.|`|Izw8c3uNaa	yahoo aT&T is still practiing the BUSH POLICY<br>  <br>  illegal wire tapping of americans and rules
lsMYPmKvaa	Everything is above his pay-grade, so he has no stomach for anything other than smoking his dope.|`|OCILQltiaa	Damn good question... and yes he is a big Zero he says he is watching Gaza very closely... OMG what a moron. Who would have thought a month ago that Blago would come out on top in all this mess. Now, Obama is really worried because he knows Blago is about to tell on him if they do not let him go.|`|0SdT7cZXaa	No one is a big Zero.<br>  While I did not vote for him, I will give him the opportunity to become literate about topics and limitations of power.|`|0q8RvKS9aa	Um...<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  NO.<br>  <br>  Thanks.|`|eulMjLtPaa	Obama...is...not...the...President...yet...|`|7d2d6d4d7776168256be9f967571c2caaa	You chickens are really behind on current events, aren't you? Obama is not president yet!|`|644fe9633265c82afa8cdeb71d97a23daa	It would be highly improper for the Preisent-elect to interfere with the work of the current president or to meddle in the affairs of one of the states.|`|ciAAdMd2aa	Nope... what a stretch of a question anyway.  Next time please pick a distinct situation instead of garbling two different things into a incomprehensible question.|`|z7HVyedyaa	Obama is not President of the USA yet.|`|5Lh6wkPTaa	Is Obama the president yet? I thought he was gonna be sworn in on Jan.20...huh did I miss something?
AA10011095	1)  Freedom of speech  You can say racist comments and not be sued.<br>  2)  Affirmative action attempts to correct "systemic sexism" when staistics show one group is being discriminated against but not outright.<br>  3)  There are no black-only colleges.  That is illegal<br>  4)  Yes, it would be<br>  5)  Because child labor was a major problem in our history kids worked in factories and got limbs cut off it was really bad.<br>  6)  No<br>  7)  If you don't want to vote for Obama because he's black then you are racist.<br>  8)  This is a historical segregation in this country.<br>  9)  Racism is bad because it mirrors evils in our past (and present) and it is about power, so reversing it does not make it the same, unless all the power in this country was reversed also.<br>  10) No, doesn't change my opinioin, these are good questions.|`|9ab7c5b30122db984710185845f90cbfaa	the real answer to all your questions is in your first answer. That person and people like them are the reason there is racism in the world.The website he linked is nothing more then a pile of racist crap spouted off by unintelligent ignorant people. If we could find a way to put people like that away forever there would be no racism anywhere.I personally feel sorry for them and any unfortunate offspring of theirs|`|6cd91085321694b047db82c53067324aaa	<br>  I'm not sure about what my answer will be like to you but I just want to share.<br>  <br>  I read something in a book saying that the "American soil breeds racism". The culture there is what tells people like you to panic over these issues. Because if you go to other countries there is not much tension on race or gender issues as much as you have there.|`|F92FDQGEaa	Please visit here, it will open your eyes to the truth.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.newnation.vg/forums/index.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.newnation.vg/forums/index.php</a>|`|QNXnAUJaaa	Why can't a 14 year old get a job at a restaurant?<br>  <br>  <br>  Because most of us arent mature enough yet.|`|SEL1cjHtaa	Your age and race doesn't effect my opinion.  Reverse racism.. there is no way to reverse it, because all racism isn't pointed at white people vs. non-whites.<br>  <br>  There is no black only colleges.  That would violate the Equal Education Act of 1973.  There are historically black and predominately black colleges.  <br>  <br>  There are child labor laws that prohibit the hiring of children below the age of 16.  Child labor provisions under FLSA are designed to protect the educational opportunities of youth and prohibit their employment in jobs that are detrimental to their health and safety.<br>  <br>  Affirmative action IS racist, and in states like Michigan where I live, it has been abolished by voters who voted to prohibit Affirmative Action.  The term affirmative action describes many policies aimed at a historically socio-politically non-dominant group (typically, minority men or women of all racial groups) intended to promote its access to education or employment. Motivation for affirmative action is to redress negative effects of actual or perceived, past or current discrimination that is regarded as unjust by relevant legislative bodies. It also serves to encourage public institutions such as universities, hospitals and police forces to be more representative of the populations they serve.<br>  <br>  There is this thing called the First Amendment Right.  It protects your right to say what you want, where you want.  The only thing it does not protect is speech that violates laws, and speech that endangers the welfare of the population, such as yelling fire in a movie theater.<br>  <br>  There are just girls and just boy sports teams because males typically are more athletic than their female counterparts.  By segregating sports on the basis of sex you are doing a few things, such as providing safety for female players against males, and giving females time to play the game.  And, for ANY sport that does not have a seperate team for females, such as, if there was no female football team offered at a school, and a female wanted to play, she CAN play on the team.  Same thing with guys.  If a guy wants to be a cheerleader, which is typically a female sport, they would have no choice but to put the guy on the team.<br>  <br>  You are a product of society, unfortunately.  believing many false statements given to you by the media, your peers, and adults.|`|83df363c0b39116bc273bca1cf432436aa	America, is the answer to all your questions.
t3QAaSN9aa	No, because I would not have cut taxes for the wealthy while spending like a lunatic.  There would have been no unnecessary war in Iraq, which would have saved hundreds of billions of dollars, not to mention lives.  There would have been balanced budgets and maybe even the budget surpluses that we experienced under Clinton.<br>  <br>  In addition, I would have regulated the various industries, including the mortgage industry and the financial institutions instead of pushing deregulation and letting businesses run amok. I would have strengthened consumer protections, instead of weakening them.  Also, I would have paid attention to the declining economic status of the middle class and explored ways to strengthen job development in the US, instead of being complacent about and complicit in the shipping of jobs overseas.  I would also have  focused on developing new industries such as green industries, including alternative energy.  The list goes on but those are just a few thoughts.|`|YAiKlPkMaa	No one can answer that in all fairness. The last president had a Democratic congress for the last 2 years of his term blocking him and fighting him at every turn.|`|SIKuOevVaa	No, of course not.  I understand that not everyone is rich, and that Paris Hilton doesn't need a tax cut, and that universal health care will eliminate huge expenses for the people.<br>  <br>  Of course, for the first four of those years, I was too young to constitutionally be President, but then, over those four years we had the loser of the election in the White House, so the Constitution isn't the barrier you might think.|`|J03Qy5aoaa	Yes, because the presidents before you still haven't changed.... FAIR HOUSING ACT ANYONE?|`|A560oUeyaa	Yes probably there would be a recession, I doubt anyone could have solved it all.|`|r2JPcUN8aa	You bet.  And even bigger than this one.  Pay Backs are a b....!|`|l34etpuSaa	there would be more than a recession, there would have also been a coup and the US would have descended into utter chaos. i have terrible leadership skills|`|6J2kJHgSaa	Perhaps, but I know if Ron Paul had been president there most likely would not be a recession now. He's a genius to say the least.
lPwdDpxgaa	Absolutely - Political correctness is one of the weapons globalists use to soften up a country while prepping it for takeover.  Together with manipulating their economies, out of control PC silences the populace about everything.  It is rampant in Europe and the UK, and is sure gaining a foothold here in the US. Once the people are used to watching what they say, leaders can violate more and more of their rights,  Ultimately, global government takes over without people saying a word.

Considering that another 400+ billion dollar bill is making it's way through congress right now, thinking that Obama actually meant that would be laughable if it wasn't for the fact that the American people are going to have to pay for all of this.|`|1oxBCtmZaa	He means half of what it's going to be this year with all the stimuli, which represent a tripling of the deficit.<br>  <br>  So the deficit's actually going to be larger than Bush's mammoth deficits. <br>  <br>  It's like when stores increased prices and then have a "50% off" sale.|`|1FkYHLXDaa	But it *sounds* so good!

3ebb87ed0f276343bd04001d7c181545aa	Ah, we invaded afghianstan after 9/11,<br>  <br>  The country were the terrorist lived and trained and planned the attacks.<br>  <br>  So exactly how did we invade the wrong country ???|`|9rhmeb7raa	Since I'm nearing the end of seven decades of life on the planet, 25 of which were spent in the Navy, I'm quite aware of what happened prior to September 11, 2001. In February of 1993, on the second anniversary of the liberation of Kuwait from occupation by Iraqi forces, a terrorist attack was launched on the World Trade Center. On June 25, 1996 a terrorist attack was launched on the Khobar Towers Air Force barracks in Saudi Arabia. An airman I knew was severely wounded in the attack. On August 7, 1998 (the fifth anniversary of our first troops arriving in Saudi Arabia to eventually launch Operation Desert  Storm) a terrorist attack was carried out on two of our embassies in East Africa.  On October 12, 2000 (the Navy's birthday) a terrorist attack was carried out on the USS Cole and I lost some shipmates. <br>  Despite all this, the previous administration handled this as a "law enforcement problem". But, the final insult came when Larry C. Johnson, a counter-terrorism specialist in President Clinton's State Department had an op-ed column published in the NY Times entitled:<br>  "The Declining Terrorist Threat". It was published on July 10, 2001!|`|2bb016b1e780abaa80d9a9bd66d8e804aa	I guess you missed the following attacks on sovereign US territory in the "40 years of peace".  WTC Bombings (Clinton).  USS Liberty (LBJ).  US Embassies, Teheran (JC), Kenya, and Tanzania (BC, both).  Oh, let's not forget LBJ's lie - Gulf of Tonkin (got us deeply involved in a little place called Viet Nam - 59K+ dead Americans).  So invading under "false pretenses" is not a new thing.  If you want to place blame on why we're in Iraq ask Judith Miller of the NYT how she helped sound the war drums by repeating everything Chalabi said.<br>  <br>  It's painfully obvious those two names don't mean a thing to you.  The biggest problem facing this nation is people who are willing to disregard anything that conflicts with their version of truth (facts be damned).  <br>  <br>  Oh, and we are fighting in Afghanistan.|`|6HMTlQMaaa	Clinton is the one to blame for September 11.

If they do, then they are just throwing their profits out of the window anyways and have nobody to blame but themselves if their business goes under.<br>  <br>  If the top income tax rate is 70% and you have $1 million in taxable income, you have the choice of letting the IRS take $700k or investing enough of that income in the USA economy to get you into a lower tax rate.  High tax rates on the rich forces the incentive on them to invest in things that promote economic growth.<br>  Bush gave the rich huge tax cuts but they invested their extra income in things that did little to nothing to promote economic growth in the USA.<br>  <br>  Now here is another truth that you probably do not want to hear, the most prosperous times this country has had in the last 90 years occurred when the top tax income rate was 39% of higher.  For the most part, much higher.<br>  The worst economic times we have had in the last 90 years occurred a few years after tax cuts for the rich|`|lyhnHhuWaa	I wish someone would explain it in a way that it makes sense as well.

The Transportation Secretary said they were considering this as a way to maintain revenues from the gas tax lost by the use of hybrid cars and electric cars, better mileage etc. They wanted to put a riff chip in your registration tags and you would pay a mileage tax each year on the miles driven. Some states were talking about doing this and the Sec. of Trans mentioned it like I said, the next day Obama came out and said no we were not going to do anything like that.

Can you blame them?<br>  <br>  The idea that we are not a democracy because democracy is 'mob rule' is a really dumb one.  We are a representative democracy.  We decide on our leaders and they decide what to do.  <br>  <br>  There are two competing theories, whether the leaders are supposed to represent the peoples' ideas and wants, or whether they are hired to do what they think is best.  The latter is the way the British saw government 200 years ago, that elected officials' jobs are 'trusts', that they should run the country by their own expertise and make their own decisions. Americans have usually believed that the leaders were there to reflect the will of the people.

When you vote Republican, you are voting not for a man and his ideas and his agenda, but for the party agenda.  In 2000 the leaders of the party got together to determine the agenda and picked Bush to represent the agenda.  Bush was the perfect guy for this because he was relatively good-looking, he had no past in politics to speak of, and he had no political ideas of his own.  So they picked him and lined up all the money behind him, and from that point on, the media declared him the presumptive winner.<br>  <br>  McCain was really the maverick in those days.  He had his own ideas, his own agenda.  But the party didn't want him.  So when he won the first big primary, in New Hampshire, they destroyed his candidacy with a smear campaign in the next primary state, South Carolina.  <br>  <br>  McCain dropped out of the race, he went off to lick his wounds and decided that if he was going to make it in the Republican Party he couldn't be a maverick, he had to be a Team Player.  So he came back and endorsed Bush, he realigned all his opinions and positions, and for 8 years he was a cheerleader for Bush and the Party Agenda.<br>  <br>  If he wins this year, he will only continue all the programs and policies of Bush, because they weren't Bush's ideas in the first place.  Like Bush, he will be no more than a spokesman for the Republican Agenda.  In fact the people in his administration who make the actual decisions and policies will be the same people as in the Bush administration.<br>  <br>  And I really think this is a shame because I used to have respect for the man.  If he was running as an independent I might even have voted for him.|`|JGZfcytYaa	I DON't want McCain to win in anyway, but I do trust that he would have been better.  GWB was a terrible choice.  Our country has been downhill, but I don't think we would have been so far down.  I'm NOT a McCain supporter, but I think that the 10% he disagreed w. Bush could have made a difference.|`|UFfsdHbyaa	Yes I believe that MCCAIN would be a better president than Bush. However it is really wrong that people said they are the same. Because each president will have their own style of ruling the country so I don't think MCCAIN & BUSH are the same at all.|`|EAPHrwaDaa	It would be exactly the same, since they voted together 90% of the time.|`|TkDor17Vaa	It would probably be EXACTLY THE SAME.|`|peXKq1B6aa	HELL YES!|`|T7CNCDcZaa	Probably, I don't like McCain but he's 100x more competent than Bush.|`|YM9ZFwrRaa	Probably he's better!|`|QsL33Gylaa	Are you insane?? they are the same person...........

For the government to provide a happy, healthy, shameless, and even exciting society, for everyone, regardless of their personal means, requires a massive amount of cash from the citizens as well as all you can borrow. Further, to make sure that no citizen gets into trouble and is in bed each night at a reasonable hour, a huge government staff is a necessity. This, in turn, requires every dime the public can spare and just a bit more.<br>  <br>  <br>  Republicans<br>  Republicans, in their hearts, and especially at campaign time, really would like to cut back on government spending -- especially such luxuries as the social, environmental, and health programs. But there are necessities that it would be irresponsible to avoid. Such things as National Defense, which requires a military budget far greater than any we have had in any major war, can no more be cut back than you can cut back on helping the folks back home that need a superhighway to the new park out in the country. These are essential expenditures unlike the "feel good" stuff of the Democrats. When Iraq threatens our shores by such hostile actions as flying one of their planes over the southern half of their country, we better be ready for action. <br>  <br>  I rather be a republican!!!!!|`|AA11409272	The truth is...we all want what is best.. to live prosperous, healthy lives and be good and fair to each other.<br>  We simply have opposite ideas on how to achieve it.<br>  <br>  And my side is right!!  :OP|`|214e1adddf040b774a03079bd09796e3aa	I don't believe true Democrats & true Republicans are so different.  Thank God for the Blue Dog Democrats who actually represent the majority of that party but the radical, liberal Democrats are the party leaders and too many politicians just do not have the courage of their convictions and vote along the party line.  "Go along to get along"<br>  <br>  Republicans are more conservative but for the past eight years spent like liberal Democrats.  That is why we are in such a financial mess right now.  Also, just as there are radical Dems there are radical Repubs.<br>  <br>  Actually the U.S. is right of center but we are shouted down by the radicals, the ACLU and the powers that be that want to and are succeeding in dividing the Country.  No matter what name you put to it, the U.S. is losing it's values and things we hold so dear.<br>  <br>  It's all part of a generation whose goals are geared toward a 'one world government' and we are all being manipulated and brain washed so we just can't accept that it is happening.
C7wjR42Daa	I do not think you can request to go on IRR. IRR status comes after you end your active service or your reserve status as stated on your contract..<br>  <br>  If you signed a 6 year contract with the NG then you have to honor that contract. I cant see them releasing you because you want to apply to a job that you do not know if you will get. You get IRR after you complete your active reserve contracts.<br>  <br>  If that was the case you would have thousands applying to civilian jobs just to get out of their contracts.|`|kZ5NSg2Baa	You talk to your first sergeant...|`|wiUryW0kaa	Your first sgt isnt gonna do anything for you..You are under contract in the national guard..why do you think you can get out of it?<br>  <br>  you dont decide when you want to go on IRR that comes after your contract is done..your stuck and you have to finish the contract you signed 
bcc62a4f188c1522006cc8ba2c7b102aaa	No he's not. Obama is a continuation of the Bush regime, the ultimate status quo.<br>  <br>  Obama took office under conditions of a deepening worldwide financial and economic crisis. His economic policies, the major focus of his first 30 days in office, consist of a series of initiatives aimed at propping up the profit system and safeguarding the economic dominance of the giant banks and billionaire investors, at the expense of working people:<br>  ? The economic stimulus legislation, a $787 billion stopgap measure to prevent a complete collapse of consumer spending and state and local government. While business benefits from tax breaks and infrastructure contracts, and a large swathe of upper-income families get exemption from the Alternative Minimum Tax (worth more than $2,000 apiece), most working people will receive a miniscule $400 tax cut<br>  ? The second round of the bank bailout enacted last fall by the House and Senate (including Obama’s vote), which provides another $350 billion for the financial elite. Of this, the bulk is to be used in another round of cash handouts to banks, hedge funds and other lenders, including the launching of a Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility, or TALF, which will underwrite $1 trillion in low-cost loans to major hedge funds and other speculators<br>  ? The auto bailout (using funds from the bank bailout), which will require, as a condition of new loans to GM and Chrysler, the destruction of the living standards fought for by generations of auto workers. Wages, pensions and health benefits will be gutted, while the United Auto Workers union will be retained as a police force directed against rank-and-file workers.<br>  ? The housing bailout, announced by Obama February 18, which provides relief to relatively few of the millions who are now or will soon face the threat of foreclosure. The measure is so carefully crafted to safeguard the profit interests of the mortgage lending industry that BusinessWeek magazine headlined its report, “A Mortgage Rescue Banks Can Love.”<br>  <br>  These facts rip to shreds the ongoing efforts of liberals like the Nation magazine to present the new government as an expression of popular opposition to Bush and the right wing. The Obama administration constitutes an effort, on the part of key sections of the ruling class, shaken by the failures of the Bush administration and the financial debacle, to delude the American people with vague rhetoric while the most intense efforts are made to safeguard the position of the financial oligarchy, both at home and abroad.<br>  The Obama administration demonstrates the impossibility of effecting any significant change within the existing political institutions and the two-party system. These are wholly dominated by two forces: the military-intelligence apparatus and big financial interests.<br>  <a href="http://www.wsws.org/articles/2009/feb2009/pers-f23.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.wsws.org/articles/2009/feb200...</a><br>  For someone who had vote nader in his nick you're not very observant or maybe you choose to compartmentalize.

Bank officers needed a lot of very good indicators that you would actually make good on that loan, since it was their bank which would suffer the consequences of default.<br>  <br>  Compare with my experience in 2005. The "loan officers" I spoke too were like used care salesmen (or saleswomen), pushing me to take loans I was reluctant to take, offering to help me "fudge" my numbers so as to qualify for more than I could afford, urging me to take the huge risk of undertaking big initial payments which could be lowered when (not if) the value of the house rose and I could refinance. How very different! <br>  <br>  People were UNWISE to take such risky loans, yes, but unwisdom is not a moral failing, is not unethical. However the financial professionals and regulators who allowed these shenanigans ARE morally guilty -- these people had an ethical obligation to be advocates for consumers and instead victimized the consumers. <br>  <br>  Think of it this way. Two guys are in a room, a bank president and a floor sweeper. The floor sweeper is saying "Well, I don't see how I can possibly afford to pay off this loan sir, but if you say it's OK then I guess it's OK." Now ask yourself, who is the dumbest guy in the room?|`|BHBQPFzlaa	No, but it is his fault for not seeing this economic collapse coming. Also his fault for taking a $18 billion deficit from clinton, and giving a $1081 billion deficit to obama.|`|5d9pCmjyaa	So why did Republicans allow sub prime mortgages since they all knew this would happen?|`|q4EXFhV7aa	More than 600,000 people lost their jobs over the course of one month.

Clinton started this mess.|`|dHjya1Yoaa	No.... no one forced them to lie about there yearly incomes so they could be a house bigger than they could afford... also no one forced people to "flip" houses... :/ And obviously no one forced them to read the fine print nor did they understand what the word VARIABLE means...|`|724634aa550e4f2aa216e83840f9e8a4aa	well depends who you ask.....those that take time to research Fannie Mae and the Clinton initiatives for fair housing will say no..<br>  <br>  Those that kneel at the Moveon.org and Daily Kos sites or are swept up at the latest Obama cover at the checkout will say yes...|`|BRyRtQSvaa	No it isn't, it's the democat congress that forced the bank to lend to these people, and Barney frank and Chris Dodd and Franklin Raines should be in Jail!|`|WCkOUF9aaa	Of course not. But he did create hurricane Katrina with his presidential weather machine.<br>  <br>  "Republicans allowed sub prime mortgages" ? Thanks for the laugh!|`|4zKmOkI4aa	no,that would be bill clinton and the closing of the glass stegal act.then implementing the community reinvestment act which forced banks to loan money to poor people with bad credit!|`|i5F2jwvhaa	If you bought a house you could not afford the blame is your own<br>  <br>  I have no sympathy for people that live beyond their means|`|6a29fa9432cd11f6628b8d1ef1265ca6aa	No, it's his fault that they couldn't afford them.|`|aqeWwA71aa	Yes - everything that came out of Bush's mouth was a lie.  This particular lie was in 2003 with the "Ownership Society" speech.   This cynical republican lie purported to allow more people to own their own homes - but anybody could see Bush setting up the table for this bank collapse.  He gave permission to the bankers to speed up the risky loans.<br>  <br>  Why?  Bankers make BIG money when they loan money - so they made money then.  Bankers then get bailed out later when their bank collapses - and they make more BIG money.  This is an old republican scam from way back.<br>  <br>  AND - then the Super Rich come in and scoop up the cheap real estate when the prices fall apart.  So shhhhhh!  The Super Rich are feeding right now - and they don't want you to know about it.|`|XxUByikJaa	It is the American Dream to own a Home . I do not believe that people Buy Homes they can not afford . I believe that situations change -Like losing a Job illness and death , natural disasters AND THE PRICE OF OIL AND ENERGY that  has caused people to lose their Homes . Plus the fact that Mortgage lenders had hidden costs etc. Many people were not aware that their Mortgage payments were not at a fixed rate and would actually go up on their monthly payments . In that I blame Republican Deregulation.|`|Cn1tSHLpaa	You do realize that the banks were the one's approving those loans and selling those homes, don't you?  Would you sell something of great value to someone on a payment scale that you knew they couldn't afford?  The banks could have easily said, "No".  just because you apply for a mortgage doesn't mean the bank has to give it to you...|`|Fy54FMemaa	First off, No I do not believe it was Bush's fault that people tried to live outside their means, however.... he was on duty when the market started to boil and really didn't do anything to help it. Even tho the banks were deregulated, what stopped him from correcting that immediately. His focus and attention was on the war. When people remember Bush it will be the war and the economy they remember first. Also, I would like to add that NOT everyone who is having trouble with their homes are deadbeats. People get sick, die, lose jobs and so on that can change a persons living situation... that is not to say there are no deadbeats out there because there are plenty, my point is its not all of them... which brings me to my secondly; Tifa ***** YOU! You are the example of hate and racisim, you are the reason why this county stays divided..... you think its all black people?!  How would you know? How do you come to that conclusion..... please give examples... you cant can you... because otherwise your just another redneck, inbred asshole. I happen to know many black people that are doing much better then you will ever do in a wet dream. What are you doing here anyway, arn't you late for a meeting somewhere?!|`|bb5a54df57374dc4de372500ff862a7daa	NO - Bush was for the legislation McCain tried to put forth to control this - Congress (Dem Majority) voted it down and Barney Frank and Christ Dodd said it wasn't needed.<br>  <br>  and how about PEOPLE taking responsibility for living out of their means?  What about Clinton who started allowing it?????????|`|U50orfPhaa	No, Bush wanted to stop it in 2004,  then Democrat Barney Frank in 2006 said at a hearing the banks were fine.

Democrats fault mainly, but not completely|`|4d4ad126cb9f6297171d0aa263e7d425aa	Yes, as well as Barny Frank, Pelosi, Obama and all the other nitwits who allowed the practice to go on.|`|ErTVzpUUaa	I agree with Old marin.

Didn't you get the letter saying that if you didn't buy a $750,000 house Bush would use his hurricane machine on you like he did to New Orleans?|`|cr5EoqVjaa	Of course not.

Americans are positively schizophrenic in regards to the legalities of teen sex. They need to get a grip on reality. A 15 year old boy that sleeps with his 14 year old girlfriend doesn't put him in the same category with child molesters and sexual offenders.  I predict in the decades to come, the younger generations will get those stupid laws cleared up and put on a more realistic footing, instead of being in abject denial.|`|mNaubTX9aa	If nothing happened, it's not illegal.  Google statutory rape and the name of the state it happened to find out what the law is in your state; in many, it would be legal for them to have sex.|`|MOALBorJaa	It might be, some states still have those laws on the books, North Carolina for instance. In any case, teenagers should not be sleeping together because even though nothing happened this time, it easily could next time.

In fact the only real difference between Dems and Repubs on the stimulus plan is that Dems want 1/3 tax cuts and 2/3 investment and Repubs want 2/3 tax cuts and 1/3 investment.   Obama met with Republican leaders and tried to get them to cooperate and contribute to the discussion, but for their own politican reasons the Republicans decided instead only to carp and obstruct, so the Democrats worked around them.<br>  <br>  Obama remains popular, and he has majorities in both  houses.

Buckley, Jr.<br>  <br>  "History books and politicians in both parties sing the praises for Franklin Delano Roosevelt's presidency and its measures to get America out of the Great Depression. What goes unappreciated is the fact that many of those measures exacerbated and extended the economic downturn of the 1930s. New Deal or Raw Deal? is a careful documentation and analysis of those measures that allows us to reach only one conclusion: While President Roosevelt was a great man in some respects, his economic policy was a disaster. What's worse is that public ignorance of those policy failures has lent support for similar policies in later years. Professor Burt Folsom has produced a highly readable book and has done a yeoman's job in exposing the New Deal."-- Walter E. Williams, John M. Olin Distinguished Professor of Economics, George Mason University <br>  <br>  Product Description<br>  A sharply critical new look at Franklin D. Roosevelt's presidency reveals government policies that hindered economic recovery from the Great Depression -- and are still hurting America today.<br>  In this shocking and groundbreaking new book, economic historian Burton W. Folsom exposes the idyllic legend of Franklin D. Roosevelt as a myth of epic proportions. With questionable moral character and a vendetta against the business elite, Roosevelt created New Deal programs marked by inconsistent planning, wasteful spending, and opportunity for political gain -- ultimately elevating public opinion of his administration but falling flat in achieving the economic revitalization that America so desperately needed from the Great Depression. Folsom takes a critical, revisionist look at Roosevelt's presidency, his economic policies, and his personal life.<br>  <br>  Elected in 1932 on a buoyant tide of promises to balance the increasingly uncontrollable national budget and reduce the catastrophic unemployment rate, the charismatic thirty-second president not only neglected to pursue those goals, he made dramatic changes to federal programming that directly contradicted his campaign promises. Price fixing, court packing, regressive taxes, and patronism were all hidden inside the alphabet soup of his popular New Deal, putting a financial strain on the already suffering lower classes and discouraging the upper classes from taking business risks that potentially could have jostled national cash flow from dormancy. Many government programs that are widely used today have their seeds in the New Deal. Farm subsidies, minimum wage, and welfare, among others, all stifle economic growth -- encouraging decreased productivity and exacerbating unemployment.<br>  <br>  Roosevelt's imperious approach to the presidency changed American politics forever, and as he manipulated public opinion, American citizens became unwitting accomplices to the stilted economic growth of the 1930s. More than sixty years after FDR died in office, we still struggle with the damaging repercussions of his legacy.|`|EOhxXxM9aa	Effective until Roosevelt gave into conservative pressure to cut spending in 1937...........as the one poster said check the library.<br>  Take social security for example.........how many old folks would be living out in the streets without it?<br>  Look at the infrastructure it created.<br>  For example the Hoover Dam which has been generating electricity for the last 70 years|`|XxUByikJaa	FDR'S New Deal personally helped my Grandparents out a lot .My Grandfather had been raised on a ranch out here in the South West and was a Cow Boy (as referred to by Hollywood ).

He appears to have another agenda (perhaps it's the North American Union where he has already signed to "merge" our nation with Mexico!!! Who in their right mind would want to "merge" our country with the statistically most corrupt country in the world! and who is draining us of everything  we have (and on purpose!)). Bush's other agenda shows up very clearly as he refuses to secure our borders, thus: allowing thousands of terrorists to enter and hide in our country (and his amnesty would legalize them within 24 hours!), allow millions of lawbreakers who undermine the American worker by undermining their wages and stealing their jobs and who also steal our social services We Americans have worked for  - for other needy Americans (not for sneaks who force themselves on us). He allows thousands of illegals with the new TB which is contagious, and also Chagas Disease and a host of others to enter this country and infect our people. He allows tons of foreign criminals who molest our children, rape our women and murder Americans.  Over 300,000 violent felons are in all our prisons (that is over 1/3 of everyone in there) are ALL "ILLEGAL ALIENS"!They even have a bounty on our law enforcement, BP and MM.

I believe they give you another 30 days. And you know you can show up any day prior to the court date. It's like a "by" date. You must have appeared in court "by" that date, not after. Call the court clerks office and reschedule or inquire about the rules/laws in your state.|`|TXguKna3aa	YES<br>  You can go ahead of time and ask for a continuance.

You will still owe the difference of what the finance company gets for the car and how much you owed on it.  I'm not positive you will owe them the $650, but you probably do.   As far as getting jail time for any of this, no way.<br>  <br>  You didn't have insurance.  No one has ever served jail time for not having insurance.  If they did, our jails would be completely full of nothing but those without insurance.  You get a citation for that, in other words a fine.  But you must pay the fine or you could actually face jail time.  They usually always allow payments for fines.  Many people don't have the money and you can't put everyone away.  There is not enough tax money to pay for the big time criminals let alone something small like this.<br>  <br>  This company is just trying to scare you.  Tell them they can't get blood from a turnip.  Tell them to either take the payments offered or get nothing and do what they have to do.  You are doing everything you can to make things right.  Even if they would take you to court, which I doubt they will, the worse thing the court is going to do is set up a payment plan to pay them back that $650 which is what you are offering to do in the first place.  No one is going to have to visit you in the big house.  Good luck.<br>  <br>  |`|TEW2oCF2aa	I think you are in trouble since the car has some minor damage and has to be rectified / repaired. Since you have taken money from the man who hit me you should have done the repair properly. Or you should have insured the vehicle.|`|RIjjgex0aa	I don't think this would be considered insurance fraud, and to my knowledge thats the only thing an insurance company could have you arrested for. I think to get their money they would have to take you to small claims court, and their just trying to scare you. Don't understand why they won't accept payments|`|3648e98700b8351146e2b5699bd638ecaa	all your fault! U face jail time, contempt of court, fine. in first place are you crazy or stupid? never dealt directly with offenders, always report to finance, car company.  your at fault, nothing can help you now.|`|41XqvP09aa	its called fraud you just admitted to it online you can probally work out a payment plan im sure they want it now of course|`|B4O3f8w6aa	You financed a vehicle and agreed to make the payments. You turn the vehicle back in since you can no longer afford it. In the amount of time you had it, damage was done and not fixed, even though you were given a check to do so. What the finance company will now do, is sell the vehicle for whatever they can get out of it, and you will owe the difference between the amount owed and what they get for it. You agreed to all the terms when you bought it. They will probably take you to court if you do not make the amount up that you owe. Had to laugh about the "minor damage" that $650 would not cover. Sorry, but you will lose in court and have credit problems for a long time.

xZy05taKaa	While walking down the street one day a US senator is tragically hit by a truck and dies.<br>  <br>  His soul arrives in heaven and is met by St. Peter at the entrance.<br>  <br>  "Welcome to heaven," says St. Peter. "Before you settle in, it seems there is a problem. We seldom see a high official around these parts, you see, so we're not sure what to do with you."<br>  <br>  "No problem, just let me in," says the man.<br>  <br>  "Well, I'd like to, but I have orders from higher up. What we'll do is have you spend one day in hell and one in heaven. Then you can choose where to spend eternity."<br>  <br>  "Really, I've made up my mind. I want to be in heaven," says the senator.<br>  <br>  "I'm sorry, but we have our rules."<br>  <br>  And with that, St. Peter escorts him to the elevator and he goes down, down, down to hell. The doors open and he finds himself in the middle of a green golf course. In the distance is a clubhouse. Standing in front of it are all his friends and other politicians who had worked with him.<br>  <br>  Everyone is very happy and in evening dress. They run to greet him, shake his hand, and reminisce about the good times they had while getting rich at the expense of the people.<br>  <br>  They play a friendly game of golf; and then dine on lobster, caviar, and champagne.<br>  <br>  Also present is the devil, who really is a very friendly guy who has a good time dancing and telling jokes. They are having such a good time that before he realizes it, it is time to go.<br>  <br>  Everyone gives him a hearty farewell and waves while the elevator rises...<br>  <br>  The elevator goes up, up, up and the door reopens on heaven where St. Peter is waiting for him.<br>  <br>  "Now it's time to visit heaven."<br>  <br>  So, 24 hours pass with the senator joining a group of contented souls moving from cloud to cloud, playing the harp and singing. They have a good time.<br>  <br>  Before he realizes it, the 24 hours have gone by and St. Peter returns.<br>  <br>  "Well, then, you've spent a day in hell and another in heaven. Now choose your eternity."<br>  <br>  The senator reflects for a minute, and then he answers: "Well, I would never have said it before, I mean heaven has been delightful, but I think I would be better off in hell."<br>  <br>  So St. Peter escorts him to the elevator and he goes down, down, down to hell.<br>  <br>  Now the doors of the elevator open and he's in the middle of a barren land covered with waste and garbage.<br>  <br>  He sees all his friends, dressed in rags, picking up the trash and putting it in black bags as more trash falls from above.<br>  <br>  The devil comes over to him and puts his arm around his shoulder.<br>  <br>  "I don't understand," stammers the senator. "Yesterday I was here and there was a golf course and clubhouse. We ate lobster and caviar, drank champagne, danced and had a great time. Now there's just a wasteland full of garbage and my friends look miserable. What happened?"<br>  <br>  The devil looks at him, smiles and says, "Yesterday we were campaigning…Today you voted." <br>  <br>  in the debates with Senator Clinton Obama favored raising taxes for people making above 90,000 a year and now he claims he will only raise the for people making 250,0000 a year.. then last night he said 200,000 ...which is it Obama?<br>  <br>  I will vote McCain for far more reasons than that, mostly because I do not like Obama's allies, I do not like his cheating and lying, and I do not like his inexperience and his cousin Odinga being accused of "ethnic Cleansing" after loosing and Obama went and Campaigned for him in Kenya.<br>  I do not like his Saudi support which is why he does not want to drill and he wants to keep us dependent on oil from the middle east. Politicians are funny things, they have motives and to know where they really stand you have to see everything not just hear their voce or see their pretty ears.<br>  The Rev Wright thing really hist home with me also, he could not write his book or even say he did if he did not share those seperatists emotions.<br>  Sorry, he may be well presented but he is a politician, and nothing more.|`|I6dcRgD6aa	Obama, intelligent, decent, capable, good family man, sexy, Phd. high energy. focused, honest.|`|623zz8d7aa	Obama.

He will recruit the best and the brightest to work with him.  There will be true change.  He is highly educated, intelligent, articulate and an inspiration.  And, I agree with his positions on the economy, the environment, new energy, education, technology and medical research.  He is of the current generation... not of a bygone era.  This is an important time for our country.

None of us can afford to send me and my siblings to college because tuition is going up so fast... and currently I'm married to a US Army soldier who is deploying for Iraq in less than two months and I'm worried out of my mind about his safety and our financial situation.

9uoab0Izaa	m4|`|7qxqkjNhaa	British Bull Dog Pup|`|dAK8dS4kaa	UMP-45, compact and has more knockdown, can have a silencer and other little gadgets and gizmos |`|npMVWV7raa	It depends on the situation. There's a reason why submachine guns are better than assault rifles and vice versa depending on the tactical environment and situation. If you were engaging a bad guy in an open area like in the forest, an mp5 might not be a good weapon to try to engage someone at 100yds or so.|`|C1fBdw95aa	If it's cqb in an environment with noncombatants around, mp5 all the way. 9mm has less of a chance of over penetration, especially with hollow points. At longer ranges or if the targets are wearing body armor, I'd take the m4. Considering this is a SWAT team you're talking about, I think the mp5 would be better under most circumstances.|`|sQGm97USaa	It all depends on the situation that you are in. The mp5 fires 9mm rounds where as the m4 fires the trusted 5.56. Now if you want power and rate of fire you want something that black water made. It's called the Kriss.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEex2UChBtw" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEex2UChB...</a><br>  |`|RDL3wC62aa	mp5 is more compact but it only fires the 9mm<br>  the m4 is bulkier but fires the 5.56 so it hits alot harder <br>  i would go with the M4 myself|`|Z3DE80Q0aa	M4 has wayy more Stopping Power, the only thing about the MP-5 is that you can use a silencer, but most swat teams done use one so I would go with the M4|`|GNP93brHaa	Get a grenade launcher, then you can guarantee your target will be turned to pink mist.|`|9rEI0TnUaa	MP5 is used by the US Secret Service and Special Forces and, probably, the CIA.  That should settle the question.|`|oqnKz9mMaa	M4<br>  If possible, go with the mp7, it fires the NATO round (5.56) and is as compact as the mp5|`|ZQzQ48CYaa	M4 - Very reliable|`|xwDtwVckaa	M26A1<br>  <br>  :)|`|7eAG3E4iaa	m4 all the way|`|uaUezLt1aa	i'd say a deagle but if only those two m4|`|swtYhVx2aa	It does depend on the situation. I was fortunate enough to be able to carry both in my vehicle. The MP5 is a little better in close quarters, because it is a little more compact. The fact that is fires the 9MM is not really a problem because it does the job in close quarters just fine. <br>  The M4 is a very good weapon also. Because of its collapsible stock it makes it somewhat convenient in close quarters also. The M4 in my opinion is a little more accurate, however in close quarters such as SWAT, your are trained to move and fire. The MP5 is very good for this. With the training of SWAT you are taught to be very efficient with both weapons if the SWAT unit that you are with happens to use both. It is just kind of a preference issue. Some prefer one and some prefer the other.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps|`|vyOaYm8Saa	i would recommend the MP5 as its small and packs a good punch it is also used by the counter-terrorist group of the SAS.|`|gjVj1F6Xaa	AK-47|`|lmKwo7Kjaa	i like MP5

We will be in the Middle East for at least two more years.  Russia is acting wonky and hooking up with Venezuela which could also lead to violence and North Korea is shaking its saber.|`|6OLiuM9Gaa	The war on terror will be around for a while. Terrorists are not in an army. They're gangs. They don't play by any set of rules, conventions, or standards. They only want to sow the seeds of terror. An organized military, implemented properly, can make their tactics extremely costly... even for them. The people among whom they would sow their terror, may take heart with the advent of an organized military to protect them, and resist the terror. The terrorists will find that not only are their tactics costly, but they have become ineffective. Now, one would expect that any intelligent, rational individual would get tired of waging a costly war that was becoming ineffective... but we're talking about terrorists. They're neither particularly intelligent or rational. They're wild-eyed fanatics. They don't want capitulation. They don't want surrender. They don't want a forum to express their grievances or demands. They want anybody who disagrees with them dead... and the don't mind dying in that endeavor... in fact, some desire to do so. That's what makes them so dangerous. It was said of the Kamikazes of WWII, "They fought to die. The US sailors were fighting to live." It's even more true of terrorists. Most of the Kamikaze pilots really didn't want to die. They were sacrificing their lives for a cause and for their country -- just as did our troops. The terrorist has no country. He actually wants to die. He'll tell you it's for a cause. But he really thinks it's a holy ritual that will get him a place on the right hand of his concept of God... oh, yeah, and a bevy of virgins. With respect to the latter hope, one of our guys said, "They're going to be surprised. They don't allow women into heaven."<br>  <br>  When I went into Boot Camp... it was a few years ago... and it was Navy... they interviewed me for a program. They interviewed a lot of guys for a lot of programs based on their ASVAB scores. The question this one guy asked me at one interview changed my life. He asked, "Do you want to die for your country"? It's not a question I expected in Navy Boot Camp. Most of the Navy jobs are pretty safe. I knew I'd never be shot out of the sky or have the ground blasted from under me. I guess I answered incorrectly... and he liked the answer. I spent about 12 years pounding dirt, jumping out of planes and helicopters, and doing pretty un-Navylike stuff. Early in those 12 years somebody dusted off my degree and recommended me for OCS. But, when you make LCDR (O-4), they wean you away from the action. I'm not combat junky either. But I'd been pretty active all my life up until then, and the idea of being anchored to a desk for 20 years for a flag rank didn't charge my batteries. So, I got to O-6 and got out.<br>  <br>  The facts of nature with respect to combat are...<br>  (1) In combat, soldiers die.<br>  (2) There's no guarantee that you won't be one of them.<br>  (3) You can't change the facts of nature.<br>  <br>  Some guys know and can accept those facts. They tend to do ok.<br>  Some guys have to learn those facts and can accept them. They tend to be ok too.<br>  Some guys either don't know or can't learn those facts, or they can't accept them. These guys have problems.<br>  <br>  Make sure you have your head together going in. It gives you a better chance of having your head together when you come out.

In fact American-style capitalism is warped, it is not sustainable, it is speeding down the path to its own destruction.  Some people call it 'end-stage capitalism'.<br>  <br>  But under our system, the value of anything is determined by how much profit it produces. In -real- capitalism, profit and return on investment are a means to an end, the end being to raise the standard of living for everyone.  But in the US, profit is not a means to an end, it is the end in itself.  Whatever profits big corporations is considered -good- even if it impoverishes most of the people in the country. This is why wealth is more concentrated in the US than any other developed country, more than any time in our own history.<br>  <br>  The US is said (by capitalists) to have 'the best health care system in the world'.  What they mean by this is that it produces the most profit of any nation's health care system.  Here, the highest priority is profit, in the UK, the highest priority of the health care system is HEALTH CARE.<br>  <br>  But more and more Americans can't get access to health care, so we are not through having this discussion.  It might have to get worse before it gets better.  Well, actually it -is- getting worse.  Most of us favor a 'Canadian-style' single payer plan, rather than 'socialized' medicine like the NHS.|`|EbsekS7yaa	Because doctors have rent to pay.

He is majorly spooky and talks down to people like your typical Indian H1B who thinks they are better than everyone else.<br>  <br>  LA is one of the poorest states in the Union.  It also has a major unemployment problem.  Putting an Indian in charge is pretty bad since India is world famous for its corruption.  It is even worse than Louisiana.

WhUV9k6Jaa	Other countries, or individuals, purchase US Treasury bills. China is currently the largest holder of these debt instruments.|`|2k8TEiRtaa	The Federal Reserve. From each dollar that we put in as taxpayers, that is supposed to go to the Social Security Administration etc. FICA. <br>  Hopefully President Obama will redirect that money to make sure it stays where it is supposed to be. <br>  <br>  Think of it. To keep a prisoner in prison costs about $38000 a year. And a disabled or elderly person receives benefits of an average of $8000 to $10000 a year. That's all because of the dipping into the Federal Reserve for 8 years to finance an unnecessary war. It is a mess that will take years to start fixing.|`|s1LfdCdsaa	This present administration wants us to think that THEY think it grows on trees, while the Chief Executive wants to take it from the pockets of the white elite and working class.|`|CbeNLpb3aa	China and Japan - but once our credit rating drops that will be difficult.

Printing NEW money with out the back up of Gold or Silver is a recipe for disaster.|`|c85WWXV7aa	We borrow it from the Federal Reserve. At a interest rate that can be called due when ever they see fit. At one time this nations wealth was built on the value of gold. ow it is built on the value of interest. As much as I hate this Zeitgeist is right in this area.<br>  <br>  EDIT:<br>  OK for those of you that believe we can dip into the Federal Reserve to withdraw money just cause it is a reserve need to do homework.<br>  The Federal Reserve is a bank for nations. And is not owned or has any pert of the US government. The US when needing money does the same thing every other person and nation does they take out a loan that has to be repaid. The Federal Reserve is actually ILLEGAL as it was never ratified by all 13 states. and was put into place anyways. However that is irrelevant in this question. But that is where we get our money from. All the taxes and such that we pay DO NOT go to our Nation it goes to pay off debt from previous loans from the Federal Reserve.<br>  <br>  Congress initially defined a lawful money "dollar" as being and consisting of (at least) 371.25 grains of pure silver.  Before 1965 anyone could exchange one paper dollar for one real silver dollar.  However, in 1965 the united States' mint stopped minting silver dollars.  When this occurred inflation began to skyrocket.  Now it takes a whole fist full of paper dollars (i.e., "Federal Reserve Notes") to buy one real silver dollar.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.middleeast.org/comments/1/5672.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.middleeast.org/comments/1/567...</a><br>  <a href="http://ezinearticles.com/?Did-You-Know-That-The-Federal-Reserve-System-Is-Illegal?&id=910712" rel="nofollow">http://ezinearticles.com/?Did-You-Know-T...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.healthfreedom.info/Federal_Reserve_Fraud.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.healthfreedom.info/Federal_Re...</a><br>  <br>  Even here on our own government web site they state there are 12 Federal Reserve BANKS.<br>  <a href="http://www.ustreas.gov/education/faq/currency/legal-tender.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.ustreas.gov/education/faq/cur...</a>|`|GiJ7thLqaa	The Treasury will issue Treasury Bills and attempt to sell them to other countries like China, Japan, Saudi Arabia, European nations, etc.|`|RhDPB70Baa	Your pocket.

There is still going to be a three year limit to getting cash assistance. <br>  <br>  Yes they will have to doll out more money, but it is needed to provide services to those that have been laid off and need help to stay in their homes so that they do not foreclose on their mortgage and cause greater problems to our already devastated economy.|`|UpZFb6X5aa	Unfortunately, no it doesn't.

She said she hadn't been proud to be an American, and she also said Americans are mean.<br>  <br>  I love my country so much that I served it for 3 years in the Army. And as anyone with a family member in the service knows, if you enlist you're family enlists. Me and my brother enlisted and went off to basic training within two weeks of each other. I loved my country enough that I was willing to fight and die for it. I am proud, every day of my life that I am an American. I love my country, and I am proud of my country. Her saying she isn't proud is a slap in the face to those of us who do love our country and are willing to die for it. Did she ever apologize? No she didn't, and I think you have to be a whacked out psycho coward to say something so mean and disrespectful and not be willing to say you are sorry for being such an insensitive fool jerk!<br>  <br>  When Katrina wiped out New Orleans, how much money did the American people give to that cause? And it wasn't even that people just donated money. How many people donated time putting care packages and relief packages together? How many people flew down to help? I was stabbed and friends, co-workers, and neighbors were bringing meals over all the time because they knew my fiance had to work and I was unable to do much. These people took time out of their days, and spent money to make us food. Americans are not mean. Americans are kind, generous people. Remember that wicked tsunami? Remember hoe people gave money to that cause? <br>  <br>  If I could write Michelle Obama a letter, I would ask her why she is so willing to jump up and condemn her countrymen, yet is so unwilling to apologize for the hurtful, insensitive, and wrong things she said. I think it shows her low moral standing and her sense of entitlement. I also think she is a self-righteous, hateful, uninformed moron who has to much pride, and not enough common sense.|`|4pHTkTUaaa	You are not Jackie O.<br>  I can not buy the pair of earrings with the extra $13, that she suggested when Bush gave us $600<br>  <br>  Ok a serious answer---Ask her to please fix this so that people your age, when you are older will be able to find a job and earn a living.

There are those who find themselves unemployed and don't want to be, those who are unemployed and look to extend unemployment payments instead of taking a low paying full time job, and those on welfare who refuse to work at all (even those NOT on welfare who refuse to work at all).<br>  <br>  Many topics right there.|`|CbeNLpb3aa	Deport all the foreign workers and there will be millions of jobs available for Americans.<br>  <br>  www.numbersusa.com|`|bfe4ad38e28ddda61b321173866c1f9aaa	The best way to reduce unemployment is to pass laws and taxes that reward business for doing business in a community, State, or Nation.

We common people use our guns to stop crimes more than 2.5 million times a year according to Professor Gary Kleck, a criminologist at the University of Florida at Miami.<br>  <br>  And criminals are notorious for not obeying the law, so more gun control tends to only disarm the law abiding.  <br>  <br>  If you want some real in depth information done by researchers without an ax to grind, look here.<br>  <br>  Point Blank: Guns and Violence in America by Gary Kleck<br>  <br>  Armed: New Perspectives on Gun Control by Gary Kleck and Don B.

YOU HAVE NO SAY!|`|4bWUiIVdaa	Well, once I spoke with a female drill sgt about it and she said that it's because women are generally more emotional, even the tougher ones. Which is true. I guess when you really look at it, it is sexism, but the way I see it, is that all those men probably wouldn't feel at all comfortable having to have women in such a dangerous environment not to mention having them killed in that kind of environment. I'm talking about this when it comes to infantry and artillery... as for sniping I dunno that is sexist lol|`|2zym4J9xaa	You hinder the men to do their job.

I know I can speak for many women on this by saying that we are not "so" limited.

We had even more restrictions...It is a lot better now.<br>  <br>  It really isn't about whether or not a woman can or can't do the job. Plenty of women possibly could do infantry well. Of course that is not the point.<br>  <br>  Those combat jobs that are closed to women, are the few jobs that require an extra amount of strength and endurance and most women would struggle hard. <br>  <br>  God made men and women biologically different. I can't run as fast as a man nor carry as much weight in battle. I know my limitations and I know I would hold up my unit. I don't want that responsibility. I was a Corpsman. People might have died if I had to carry them out. Wanting to do it and actually being able to do it are completly different.<br>  <br>  As far as being a sniper? Do you really want to do that job? Do you even know what a sniper does? Women can and do shoot as straight as a man. But most snipers are on special teams...Women don't go into those teams for the same reasons mentioned above.<br>  <br>  As far as the Navy is concerned women don't go  onto subs because of privacy issues. I got to take a walk-through tour of a sub once, and the men can have it. Tight spaces ZERO privacy. and not to mention the hatch (door) was vertical, meaning on the deck (floor). I was almost too short to reach the first step of the ladder to get in the darn thing.<br>  <br>  There are many ways women can be in the military as active members. We offer many support and services to our country. I am proud to be a woman veteran and never felt like I was held back<br>  <br>  Please don't be one of the women who beg for something that they really don't want. Unless YOU plan on doing the job, let the women who serve and have served alone. We have enough to put up with.<br>  (I am not saying that you are like that, but some women want all the rights to go into combat, but don't actually want to do it. They want other women to do it for them.)<br>  <br>  I don't think it is a sexist policy. It makes sense to me and I am a woman.|`|mm5p5sy6aa	"Men can't be Hooters girls, I don't understand why because I think this is sexism. Blah blah blah"<br>  <br>  Women can't have Combat MOS<br>  Men can't be Hooters girls<br>  <br>  If my country will protect its women from the front lines and my eyes from men in those shorts I can sleep a happy man.<br>  <br>  Women are not 'so limited' it's just a couple of jobs that have to deal directly with combat that they aren't allowed into.<br>  <br>  Not to degrade or anything because I'm very happy that women are serving their country but you stick on all your battle rattle and a rucksack filled with supplies and go around for an hour or so and tell me you still wanna be infantry. Men are just born differently and are more engineered to do the type of work that is in these jobs.|`|sUAaeqlHaa	Well, I hate to hurt your feelings, but women's anatomy and physiology is simply too different from men's. <br>  I know there are exceptions, but most woman can't be expected to carry 75 pounds of gear in full battle rattle (another 20 or so pounds) with an M240b and full load of ammunition (another 50 + pounds) in 120 degree heat for miles and miles. If you can, great. I hope you're not the commo person, carrying a radio, extra batteries and extra antennas - that is at least another 20 pounds.<br>  <br>  Edit: Ever been to an outpost or JSS yard in Iraq? There are usually no women there. Why? Because they only take the necessities there - they don't take dividers for showers or latrines. There are no special sleeping areas for the women.|`|v5OQd0ugaa	For Women Stop being Ignorant! that's the bottom line.<br>  <br>  the reason is so obvious, because women are  physically weak, and when you've been compromised in combat zone and the enemy captured you, you're not going to be a captive instead of sex slave n' they're gonna rape your vagina the whole day, over and over... until  they rip your vagina apart....!|`|C62F31Dwaa	Actually women can be snipers in the Marines, and part of other scout units. <br>  about 89% of jobs in the military are open to women so I'm not sure what your complaining about. =P

When I become overwhelmed by my ever-rising debt and costs of living, I just open new credit lines and open new credit cards with higher interest rates... trust me, it'll work.|`|NFnLwi88aa	The fact that Obama is the president is a huge change I would say. Things look bad as of now but at least the truth is not hidden and is being taken care of.  At least we are giving effort to make a difference. I would say that the American people has also changed and soon, history!
a7c44ca57676a0db1e3d8ad650499612aa	I depends on the amount you have. It depends on the way you have it. If its in little bags they can get you with distribution even if you don't intend on selling it. Your friend probably will get jail time depending on how many times he/she has been in trouble. This is mean but I have to say it..... You need to spend more time on learning proper grammar and spelling instead of hanging out with crack heads.|`|h6NqNzHAaa	Depending on how much they had, the cops can charge with distribution whether they intended to or not. Your friend can face prison and fines.|`|TFdKrkP2aa	You get arrested for possession of a controlled substance and go to jail.|`|ECphQqetaa	intent to sell has nothing to do with whether you actually intend to sell it or not, but is based on the amount of crack you have in your possession. (this is true for all drugs) if you have over a certain amount of the drug, the charge increases from possession to possession with intent to sell, regardless of if you are actually selling it. intent to sell carries a greater sentence, than a simple possession charge. you can also be charged with intent to sell if you have paraphernalia associated with the selling and distribution of narcotics (such as a bunch of small plastic baggies) or anything else that you would put the drugs in to sell them.|`|ygccpU2paa	Bottom line: it's up to the judge hearing the case to determine the punishment.  At the very least, the drug possessor will be given probation with random drug testing and community service and a diversion program.  The court costs are very high because your friend will have to pay for the drug tests, the probation, etc.|`|uh2bkRrFaa	Any amount of crack is big trouble, but depending on the amount, if it's over a certain amount, it's automatic "for sale" whether you were selling it or not and you were. So you're looking at some jail time. What were you thinking? I mean, um...your "friend."|`|jgRRsG8Daa	The person who gets caught with the goods will get incarcerated.If the <br>  person gets apprehended is Singapore,China or any of the Middle East<br>  Sheikdoms,he will be summarily executed.|`|8qpEV4Fsaa	you will be charged with possession of a controlled substance...which in your "friend's" case is cocaine. you friend will definitely be doing time. For me to give an approximate sentencing time i will need to know how many convictions he has had in the past and how much cocaine was found|`|x6pLsb19aa	i would expect prison or jail time.....
ysclTmCoaa	You would only have to re-sit a driving test if the courts ordered you to or if your licence was revoked.<br>  <br>  A ban under the totting-up procedure would not merit a re-test.|`|GHefTsUyaa	I don't think being banned because of the totting up process would mean re-sitting your test.|`|968837a2f6943f22a9655689e9626ee9aa	you really need to be a persistant offender to to up 12 points in 3 years. It's a good phobia to have and should keep your licence clean|`|a1c9da4a2a6e971f43d988078b7d0b67aa	If you are a carefull driver it is actually quite hard to loose you license. You can continually get three point a year and never loose your licence as points expire after 3 years and it takes 12 for disqualification. <br>  <br>  However more serious offences that can not be dealt with by means of fixed penalty notice have to be dealt with at magistrates court, where tougher penalties can be impossed.  But still most people who end up in court get a couple of week suspension unless they did something especially dumb like drink driving - this will always result in a very tough penalty like a minimum 12 month ban and test resit.|`|2JqajMgeaa	You would have to resit both.

It's a hoax. The "world" is just as divided as the American people. The real people of every country are in the same percentage as we are as far as liking Obama. 80 % of Europe governments like him, because they are serving under the same policies. The people that live in socialism are hating Obama in higher percentage than it's reported. They are suffering first hand from the opressions and lies of extreme socialism. The ones that "like" him are either government leaches, or brainwashed people that have actually never tasted freedom on any level. <br>  Whoever said 80 % of the world likes Obama, is not doing any legwork. He's not counting people, he's counting countries. Typical of the lazy liberals whi will not get into detail for fear they might find the truth they know it will bite them in the ****.<br>  My sources are more in depth. Sorry!<br>  And... I don't like Obama as a person or his policies. As a person he's a very arrogant and rude loser. As a president, he's taking his 'assets' everywhere with him.|`|2f2A2Lz3aa	I do not .

However, it doesn't mean he'll make a good president or fix any of the problems we're facing these days.<br>  <br>  When I first knew he was running for president, I was very interested in him; until I started studying economics and I realized what he was planning to do will likely make matters worse.|`|xSxqKF3Jaa	I am sure he is a fine person.
