20090202165920AArYEP9	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Do the ends ever justify the means? ?	So what do you think, is committing a few sins acceptable to carry out the greater good?       Are their certain situations in which it would this would be acceptable and others in which it wouldn’t?       Are we more harshly judged by our peers (and God for that matter) on the ways in which we accomplish something than by the actual result?      Also, if you belong to a certain faith or school of philosophy which has shaped your ideology on this matter, could you list it. So if you are greatly influenced by the works of Machiavelli and that makes you believe the way you do, I would be interested to hear it.

As a Christian, don't we ALL sin and need to repent?  I don't go around telling every Christian or non-Christian they are a "sinner" and need to repent.  And I don't go around trying to be a hero trying to save every sinner's soul.  Why do some sinning Christians do do this only in regards to homosexuality?  Do they do this when a Christian sits down at Denny's for a "bacon" and egg breakfast?  Or, when they have a "shrimp" dinner at Red Lobster?  Or, at a Motel when a married man gets a room with a *****.  I don't understand why they have this magnifying glass on "homosexuality" only.      Does anyone understand this?

He parks his car towards the middle of the street to the point that people cannot get by easily.        Throws large branches that have fallen onto his property out onto a side street driveway that goes next to his house.  We all run over these branches.      Puts blinding motion detector lights up, so that when you pass by his house, you get blinded by lights.      Called the police because people were rolling through a stop sign on which the sign is from a dead end street.        Makes comments about people that walk the neighborhood that do not live in the neighborhood, like   "where did these kids come from and why are they here?"      Put's reflective tape on stop signs, or speed signs in the neighborhood.      Complains that one neighbor parks their trucks on the lawn, and calls them rednecks.

And he said to me that he really likes me back. So we decided to meet. We went to his house and chilled there. Watched House bunny and chilled in bed while watching tv. We didnt say much to each other during the time. We went out for a walk and talked though. I was really starting to like him. When I left I texted him while driving home that i wanted to see him again and he said ok. The following day we texted a little to each other bout the superbowl. But after that he didnt talk to me anymore. I never sent back the texts i gave him. Usually, hes the one who texts me and starts the conversation. He would say good morning to me over the phone and text me during school. I havent heard a word from him since though. I tried to call him but no answer. Either somethins seriously up with his phone, or he's trying to ignore me. Idk, i think im just overreacting. Am I? it's been bothering me all day. I wish he would say somethin.

20090202171632AAED9bE	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Other - Cultures & Groups	Whats my stereotype? I need and want one really bad!?	I know it's silly, but I want a stereotype really bad. Everyone has one out of my friends, and I don't. I stand out from my friends. I guess you could say I'm more normal then them. So could you help me?      I listen to country music, and I shop from Aeropostal mostly.  I have a few friends.  I love science, hate math and history though.  I wish I could draw well!! I love my friends; they're crazy odd.  I'm really random sometimes and I love to laugh. I try my best to fit in with others though and I like following trends.   I have somewhat short dark brown hair (if that helps at all) and I'm not that tall.  I hate myself most of the time because I think I'm ugly and fat, but most of my friends tell me that I'm not.  I'm very insecure. I absolutely HATE my family; friends mean everything for me.  I want to have alot of them, but most of them don't like me because of the friends I have now, and that bothers me more then most people think.  I've thought of suicide, but I'd never attempt it.    I love blood and gore. It's just my thing.  I LOVE to read.  Romance and Fantasy are my favorite genres, and I love the Twilight series.  I hate Scary movies, but some are alright.  I can't really spell, and I'm not that smart (out of school).  I wear basic tees, and kinda tight jeans, but not skinnies.   I hate teeny shoes, but Converse rock.  I just don't wear them.  In the summer I'm usually swimming and going to a friend's house to get away from home.      Alright, I think I gave enough info, now PLEASE give me a stereotype?   I want one terribly bad, just so I can say I have one.   Label me what you want, I want to know.Please?

20090202132056AALIzSv	Society & Culture;Mythology & Folklore	Why are so many people confused at seeing a spirit for the first time?	Now I believe that people are so confused at seeing a spirit for the fist time... Is because they have nothing in their minds to equate with that can explain this first time encounter... So that is why the human mind goes into a state of confusion looking for a way to intrepid what your eyes are seeing.... So I can understand why people ask could I have actually see an spirit.... When it truth that is what exactly the state that the human mind is in for seeing something the very first time.... For a real spirit is nothing like what you seen in the movie or tv etc... But if those people every witness a spirit a second time there will be no doubt whatsoever.....And another thing most paranormal encounter never happen again and those people that saw a spirit for the first time will always have doubt until they once again sees a spirit..... So all of you people out there that think that you witness a spirit a huge percentage of you really have seen a paranormal event that may never again occur in your life time... Please share with me what you think your first time experiences was like.................

I can always tell when someone doesn't like me because I can pick up on it.

Bless Muhammad and the House of Muhammad as You blessed Abraham and the House of Abraham; indeed, You are praiseworthy and glorious"... however isnt this talking about when the prophet saw and his family were alive, the context sugests that as when reffering to ibraheem it is past tense, abrahams blessings have been sent and it refers to as when he was alive and thus theese blessings are for when nabi saw was alive right? so why do we send them down now?

20090202153359AAysJlh	Society & Culture;Holidays;Ramadan	If your fighting to be called a Muslim, why not call yourself one?	I stop and wonder, sometimes laugh at some answers where the answerer fights to be called a Muslim, which is deserving upon any Muslim, but it sort of contradicts itself when you go right ahead and call yourself another title (one which was not given to you by Allah) in the same sentence.      22:78..... It is He Who has named you MUSLIMs, both before and in this (Revelation); that the Messenger may be a witness for you, and ye be witnesses for mankind! So establish regular Prayer, give regular Charity, and hold fast to Allah. He is your Protector - the Best to protect and the Best to help!      So what is wrong with you then? Allah named you Muslims, did you come up with a better one? Astaghfirullah.      If you want others to call you a Muslim, first and foremost you need to call yourself one.      Question: Why do you blatently ignore Qur'an? Why do you use Ahadith to justify your fights but ignore the verses which specifically tell you what you should  be called?      Assalaamu 'Alaikum

20090202150111AA71Suv	Society & Culture;Holidays;Valentine's Day	Valentine's Day Dilemma?	Valentine's Day is on Saturday next week. We'll be at my father in law's home [250 miles away] because of a family gathering in the area the night before.      My father in law is a disabled widower who lives alone [he's always refused our invitations to come live with us].      When we are at his home, my wife and I usually spend most of time doing chores for him. My wife works inside the house and runs errands for him. I do work both outside and inside...doing yard work, repairing anything that is broken, etc. [I've always felt that if I do it, he doesn't have to pay someone.]      I know he is on a limited income, and therefore I always refuse to let him repay me for the supplies I purchase. He's a good man who always helped others, so I believe it is a privilege to help him any way I can.      This time, I know that there are several things needing repair this weekend that might cost a fair amount. Therefore, I probably won't have much to spend for Valentine's Day. [But, I do promise to stop working in the afternoon so she and I can spend the evening together].      I'd appreciate any lower-cost ideas of what to get/do for my wife. She has always been very thankful for my assistance to her dad, and would never want me to cut back spending on her dad so she could have something nicer on Valentine's Day. However, I'm a little short on original ideas at this point.      Thanks in advance for any ideas!      Ciao,      Paolo

I posted a similar question, but I think that because of the word choices of my last question, I got some responses talking about how hard it is to find other gay people, and other things like that.      However, what I am actualy asking is wether it is harder to find gay partners who are faithful than straight partners who are faithful?      For instance, the few guys I have dated do things like kissing other guys even though we are dating, and also hitting on other guys when we are dating. This kind of disppoints me, and makes me feel very depressed.      Does it have to be like that? or if there are faithful gay guys where can I find one?

I was looking threw the questions and stumbled upon the men and women asking about abortions and asking advice how to deal with it.   Even if you think its murder or against your god, don't you think there should be some sort of human compassion for the person or people making this hard decision?      I honestly think its your choice and if some one is seeking help on making the choice or dealing with there choice that was made for a good reason in there mind then they deserve compassion from a human point of view even if you think its taking the life of another human. If you wish to be rude to people when they ask for help remember you may be asking that same person for help, or they may be the one trying to save your life or delivering your child. So i want to hear what gives people the sense of human decency to demoralize some ones choice and call them a murder.       I want to hear peoples honest thoughts and what if you needed help from that person would you ask for it or let your self deal with it.

I'm gay, and I have a huge problem when I'm trying to make new straight guy friends. I mean I do the normal guy things like play video games, but for some reason I just can't relate to straight guys and it gets REALLY awkward for me when I get close to a straight guy. Does anyone else have this problem? I hate this, I always start crushing on them after this and I get all clingy and **** and it really sucks. Sigh, I think I have just ruined what could have been a really close friendship because I got a huge obsessive crush on my close friend and now I keep making things more awkward because I get nervous when I'm around him and I have nothing to say. Damnit, I hate this. Why can't I just be friends with them?..

20090202171553AAo3TO0	Society & Culture;Holidays;Ramadan	For Muslim girls? Serious answers regarding marriage, please? :-)?	Salam to all,      I am a Muslim female, college student, and single. My studies are my number one priority. However, I recently had a guy ask for my hand in marriage, but I politely refused because I was not interested.      This occurrence got me thinking about the subject of marriage in Islam. Certainly, times have changed and Muslim girls (all people, really) don't get married as young as they used to.       For my Muslim sisters (and non-Muslims are welcome to respectfully share their opinions), at what age did you get married/intend to consider marriage and why? What do you feel is an appropriate age?      Moreover, how do you know if a guy is right for you when the time comes? In your opinion?      Again, I'm just curious to hear others' opinions. I'm not considering marriage anytime soon to anyone not right for me. It just never occurred to me that a I would recieve a proposal of marriage this early.       Again, please, let's have a serious and respectful discussion. Thank you! :-)      Peace.

20090202172757AABdkiP	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	Do you think he likes me (Continued)....?	When we first met, he asked if I had a boyfriend and if I were a top. We shared an umbrella in the rain. He never puts me down. He asked me to cat walk and claimed it'll boost my confidence. He also gave me a video game that he said he hated.      I think he's jealous of my best friend (a girl). Me and her hanged out and he was like "what to you so long!?". One of my friends say us hanging out and then called him to tell him about it.      The next day he said he didn't want to talk to me anymore. He was PISSED OFF! Then he called me a liar. I had to argue with him for 10 MINUTES just for him to calm down. After that he said "I don't know what to believe anymore..."      the next day, he was still complaining about it. Then I said "I don't like her!" and he said "I wish I had a lie detector...."      I like him a lot. He is so talented, too. He can draw, play the piano.      I told him that I had a music class and that I thought I'd fail. He laughed and said "Don't worry, you'll do ok".      Can you believe FIVE days later we took our finals and classes ended and he remembered to ask me how I did on my music final? It's almost as if he was concerned about my grades. He also was mad when I told him that I cheated on one of my tests. I'm happy he's so concerned about me.      Today, He called me "boring". He said I am so boring because I prefer some school classes which to him are boring but to me are fun. He said would I rather be with a girl or play a video game but I didn't answer. Then he called me quiet and imitated me. He imitated me quite well and I said "I do be doing that though, you ARE right".      Then later when we returned back to school from lunch he asked me to help him find his class. He was like "speak" because I was being quiet on the way there. Then he said "I dunno what I'll do if I went to your house, it'll be all awkward and quiet". I said "I'm not quiet" and he said "So speak to me then" and then I started to speak to him. Everything was great. A little while later his friend arrived and they started to speak about something I had no clue about. I became quiet. After that he complained that I was quiet again and then I said "it's only been 2 seconds since I've been quiet" and he said "no, five minutes I was counting". I'm like "so you observe ME that much to know everything I do?" and he said "yes".         What do you think? Do you think he likes me? Do you think he was hinting at something when he said "if I go to your house..."? And why do you think he's trying so hard to get me to talk?      *By the way, no one knows I'm gay and he also claims to be straight. Also I am NOT shy or quiet when I'm around him. He talks a lot and he wants me to start talking a lot too.
20090202172847AAYmHxD	Society & Culture;Etiquette	Question about dealing with a friend?	I have a friend who tends to be a "fair-weather" friend, is all I'll put it.  Example:  this person will cry on my shoulder when they have trouble with their boss or with their love life, but recently when I felt depressed and anxious due to a chemical imbalance and the fact that I was facing esophageal cancer (which has since been rectified), this person accused me of being a "Pitty Patty" (they majored in Psychology in college).  I think part of the problem is also that I want them to be more of a friend than they're willing to be.  This person used to work with me years ago and we talk almost daily online.  Should I let this person go for good, or should I just stay under the radar for quite a few months?

20090202173708AAZdnlh	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Everyone sins,all sin is equal, nobody is supposed to judge should that justify us still committing them?	Ok I sin, You sin, we all sin, but should that be an excuse to justify sin in our lives? Instead of us always saying, so and so  does this and i do that so who are they to say I'm wrong, its only up to God to judge me. there sin is no better than mine, probably worse. Should we not be sayin sin is sin and sin is wrong no matter who is doing it, and if some says something, instead of being angry and pointing fingers back at them for their behavior, should we not go to the Lord and ask Him to help us examine ourselves to see if there is any wrong or sin in us. Not for sake of others but rather for the Lord?(our sins nailed Him to the cross-our debt was paid)    We don't want to be a stumbling block do we, should we take the higher ground and stop being so proud and self righteous and love the person who rightfully or wrongfully accuses us, Pray for God to help us be a light and a blessing to them either way, instead of saying with bitterness and hurt, who do you think you are...   It just seems that so many of us all of us point our fingers and keep the old saying 3 pointing back at you, as truth...instead of lifting our hearts and hands up to God and asking to purge us and guide us as the lowly servant we are cleansing us from our sins, so our good won't be evil spoken of? If we were so busy looking up would it matter what people around you said? We still wouldn't be perfect but we wouldn't sin as often. and God would get more glory

20090202183209AACOrX2	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	I'm boring! What can I do to make me more interesting / a better person / happier?	I'm 25 and have 2 great jobs which I love (65hours per week -don't tell me to cut down please, I cannot). I didn't study further than secondary (high) school. I am fairly clever and would like to persue further education later but at the moment am enjoying work (and the money) too much.    I have recently had a failed attempt at a relationship and looking at myself through her eyes, realised that I'm fairly dull. At 21 I was the life and soul of every party, a player and a dealer to boot. Since then i have grown up a bit, abandoned womanising, drugs and most of my old friends. Now I have a very small social circle and few interests.    I'll cut to the chase. I would love some suggestions based on your experiences of something you have done at similar junctures in life which kickstarted another phase of your life.   Like, taking up Tai Chi   Learning to play guitar   Joining a sporting club   Returning to church (I have done this and have found it enormously fulfilling by the way)      Also open to more eccentric suggestions -and more likely to follow!   Like, buy decks and learn to scratch,   Learn all the lyrics to every Wu-Tang Clan song   Go paragliding.       Yeah, in fairness I am fairly happy, but I just feel a little empty and unfulfilled. Perhaps it is just love I need, or do I need to get my head straight before I can find true love?      Remember I am tied to these jobs for a few more years at least.    Thanks in advance folks, any advice will be considered.      (I'm not going to go paragliding, I'm Irish, It's always raining here:D )

20090202174849AAHB8lV	Society & Culture;Holidays;Ramadan	I'm feeling down about Muslims at my mosque?	I've been to the mosque three times. Apparently they are gossiping about me because I am an intersex person. None of these people have bothered to ask me any questions about myself or to befriend me.      The only two people who have befriended me are young and don't seem very Muslim to me. They don't seem very serious about it.      The mosque does not offer any Islam education classes for adults that I am aware of, if it does, no one has bothered to inform me. No one has offered to teach me how to pray correctly. I am sure they are gossiping also about that.      It's a very depressing situation. I thought it would be good to go there, but now I am thinking there are not really any true Muslims there for me to worship with. I don't know.      Should I keep going or stay home? It's not very encouraging situation. Should I call the imam and leave him a phone message about how discouarged I am that no one has offered to teach me how to do the prayers even though when I arrived I said to others that I was new and needed to be taught how to do things?      They have not been friendly the way people in this forum continually portray Muslims treating new members to the mosque community.      I don't think I want to go back to the mosque. Every fear I had about it appears to be coming true.

20090202182228AAIIw83	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	Is he hinting that he likes me?	When we first met, he asked if I had a boyfriend and if I were a top. We shared an umbrella in the rain. He never puts me down. He asked me to cat walk and claimed it'll boost my confidence. He also gave me a video game that he said he hated.    I think he's jealous of my best friend (a girl). Me and her hanged out and he was like "what to you so long!?". One of my friends say us hanging out and then called him to tell him about it.    The next day he said he didn't want to talk to me anymore. He was PISSED OFF! Then he called me a liar. I had to argue with him for 10 MINUTES just for him to calm down. After that he said "I don't know what to believe anymore..."    the next day, he was still complaining about it. Then I said "I don't like her!" and he said "I wish I had a lie detector...."    I like him a lot. He is so talented, too. He can draw, play the piano.    I told him that I had a music class and that I thought I'd fail. He laughed and said "Don't worry, you'll do ok".    Can you believe FIVE days later we took our finals and classes ended and he remembered to ask me how I did on my music final? It's almost as if he was concerned about my grades. He also was mad when I told him that I cheated on one of my tests. I'm happy he's so concerned about me.    Today, He called me "boring". He said I am so boring because I prefer some school classes which to him are boring but to me are fun. He said would I rather be with a girl or play a video game but I didn't answer. Then he called me quiet and imitated me. He imitated me quite well and I said "I do be doing that though, you ARE right".    Then later when we returned back to school from lunch he asked me to help him find his class. He was like "speak" because I was being quiet on the way there. Then he said "I dunno what I'll do if I went to your house, it'll be all awkward and quiet". I said "I'm not quiet" and he said "So speak to me then" and then I started to speak to him. Everything was great. A little while later his friend arrived and they started to speak about something I had no clue about. I became quiet. After that he complained that I was quiet again and then I said "it's only been 2 seconds since I've been quiet" and he said "no, five minutes I was counting". I'm like "so you observe ME that much to know everything I do?" and he said "yes".      What do you think? Do you think he likes me? Do you think he was hinting at something when he said "if I go to your house..."? And why do you think he's trying so hard to get me to talk?    *By the way, no one knows I'm gay and he also claims to be straight. Also I am NOT shy or quiet when I'm around him. He talks a lot and he wants me to start talking a lot too.

My fathers side of the family is very Catholic and my mothers side is Jewish.  (Weird combo, I know, haha).      Growing up we celebrated both worlds...every holiday for every side and went to temple and church.  In the end I am neither of those religions and my family thinks I am having a phase and I will eventually choose.        The thing is..our son is now 4 and our daughter 2. My husband and I  do not want to have Christmas or Hanukkah anymore.  We do not want to keep pulling and pushing our children in every direction and then telling them that their parents don't believe in those holidays.       I have to tell my family but it is hard. My father will be heartbroken.  I dint mind if they give the children gifts but it cannot be for the religious reasons.

20090202181941AADlRvW	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	Am i asexual or something?	I seem to hate everyone! I just can't stand people, if i make friends i'll like them for a little while, then i'll begin hating them after knowing them for more than a month and sometimes even shorter like only a week. I am a girl by the way, and i dont seem to find any guys hot, and guys tend to piss me off as well. I just dont trust anyone. Maybe i'm afraid of getting hurt? I dont know. Although i have kind of liked a guy for a while before once, but i very soon began hating him as well when he began ignoring me. I'm also beginning to think he's not as good looking anymore, not that i ever thought he was, he's just beginning to seem uglier and uglier by the day. When i get closer to people and actually begin communicating with them and seeing them more clearly, it's like i get disgusted and i begin changing my mind, i dont know whats wrong with me, am i asexual? I can't imagine me ever being happy with one guy.

20090202182338AALY4ij	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;People with Disabilities	Is mistreating and frowning upon disabled children an injustice?	It has caught my attention that constantly children with disabilities such as ADD are victims of frustration and cruelty. I believe these children are not at fault of their situation. Therefore they should be understood and helped. Even the parents and siblings tend to get frustrated with this since they do not have the knowledge needed to comprehend. In these situations people should get informed and trained by a psychologist on how to deal with these cases. The fact that not many programs that offer help are available and free bothers me. So agree with me that it is an injustice to mistreat these kids.

He introduced me to a bunch of women who were sitting at a table, including his brother's ex wife who he is still friendly with. I already knew them all at least in passing. He decided to move our table next to theirs. After a while he got up to get something from the bar. I wanted to chat with the women but I felt like everything about their body language and lack of eye contact was against it. I felt like they were doing it on purpose but maybe I imagined that, I don't know. In any case is this definitely rude or only sort of rude since I suppose they could have just not noticed me while they were so engrossed in each other?

But I have heard that some Muslim teachings are to either convert or eliminate not Muslims. Is this true?      No doubt there are some peaceful Muslims, but even harder to doubt is that there are many violent ones.      Do you think Islam teaches violence and intolerance of other faiths?
20090202184656AAiMNxQ	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Christian, is a new holiday in the making for Jesus death since we have all these other man made holidays ?	You have Halloween which was changed a few years ago to Harvest Festival which of course we didn't have that crap when I was a kid. What in the world is Harvest Festival suppose to be anyway. The day Satan was cast down from heaven?     Easter is a day that is suppose to be celebrating the resurrection of Christ. And how do the church show their respect, they bring a big giant Easter bunny to the church and bury painted eggs outside for children to go search. As soon as the child reaches a certain age, his egg haunting days are over with.     Christmas, the day that the church celebrate Jesus birthday but shame to say, the church doors are closed for that day because everyone is at home or out of town, opening up Christmas gifts and thanking God for it. I wonder what would happened if Jesus had decided to come share his birthday to the world, and no one was at the church to say happy birthday.     Since no one actually have the days of anything concerning Jesus birth, his death and his resurrection, why not have a holiday for his death three days before Easter.  We can call it, Blessing day.

20090202191422AAMBhkS	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Why don't they teach more about hell to prevent eternal burning?	Nowadays they don't teach about hell as much as they used to( a lot of them say its nuts). But isn't that the whole point of getting saved with Jesus? That without Jesus you will spend Eternity in hell?      There would be no Jesus story and no need to get saved in the first place without hell, so why are many religious educators not talking about this?      I ask this because a fundamentalist neighbor of mine said last year "They don't teach about hell the way they used to. Now all of these people are going to hell and they don't even know it!"      Why bother teaching about Jesus if people don't know about the hell that awaits for not converting?

20090202184917AAFbHSM	Society & Culture;Mythology & Folklore	How do you get people to realize that satan is very real and alive, along with witches and warlocks?	There is tons of information about occults, witches etc on the internet that can prove their existence. They are real and do possess powers. Their powers are from satan though, not from God. It says in the Bible that God is against all witchcraft, sorcery etc. People with these powers are very scarce though and barely ever reveal themselves to others - but some have.     When you research properly it really becomes an eye opener and it's pretty shocking. Rebecca Brown has good books on these topics.     What do you think?

Honesty   If I went to the movies,   And you weren’t there,   Or I asked for your number,   And you said no,   You weren’t ready to talk on the phone,   Or if I placed my feelings,   Anonymously,   Where I knew you would see them   And you’d know they were mine,      Would the charade go on?   Would you continue to hide   Behind the amber locks, like flax?   Would you call me out of my anger   And refuse me when I stutter   Because I’m nervous around   The sheer beauty of your face?      I act from foolishness,   For I am nothing, if not a fool.   I believe in things that could never be,   Because the impossible    Can be as real as the tears   I cry in impoverished spirit.      Are these tears for more?   Or are they the dying embers   Of a vision long gone and parted?   Where is your prayer?      Reach out to me!   Act from a place of honesty,   Risk your happiness, your purpose.   Bar the returns of unhappy strife.   Put away the tools of damnation.   Limn my voice, which makes you so sure.   Say what you feel; say what you fear.   But don’t think our hearts won’t break   Because there is nothing that is as real as that,   Over and over, once for each time   You place your hope in my hands.

I dread going to cooking class tommorrow because he is in there. Last time he saw me, he held the spatula knife to my neck like he was going to hurt me. I was really scared. Going to the principle does nothing. They just put the bad kid right next to you and ask them to say sorry. I am in 8th grade and I am a very nice guy. It takes a lot to make me mad. I've been playing hockey since I was 5 and I have an average build. I've been mad once, and when that happened, I didn't feel any pain and I was able to kick my desk across the room at my house. This has happened once. What should I do about this bully at school? Do I ask him nicely or is there another way that is not too dangerous? I've had it up to the ceiling with this kid now.

Basically about 4-5 months ago this girl in my class told me this guy a year older than me is after me because "I have been spreading his name" I don't know the guy, i don't know anything about him or what he looks like - until she described him - so obviously i want to know if im in danger - and if she is telling the truth. There has been a lot of discrepencies in what she ahs told me.      Apparently he was after me, but then this other guy crossed his path and so he stabbed him but apparently the police decided not to send him to a YOI (young offenders) so now that hes clear and the guy is sorted out he is after me again.      next he supposedly saw me when i was walking somewhere and he was apparently with his mate - but apparently he decided not to get me as his mate wouldn't have stopped hitting me if he had started.      then she said i need to go up to him and sort it out, tell him i havent done owt and he will be safe with me, but then 10 min later she sed he will probably just get/stab me. (big difference from being safe)      should i worry - she has given a lot of details as though he is real - could it be a case of he is real but he isn't after me.      please give advice - im **** scared      dont tell me to squeal to the cops

Like I call her my 'girlfriend' because she's my friend and she's a girl. Are you following me so far? Any-who, I told her today that I'm in love with her. She was okay with it.

And we lean into each other when we sit next to each other. Today was the closest we got to kissing. I wanted to so badly. I knew she wanted to too. But we didn't. I guess we're just to afraid to kiss in front of out peers, who don't know about our sexually. But, what I'm trying to ask is: Should I just lean into her and just kiss her? Should I ask her if it's alright first? Should I wait until she kissed me? Should I make the first move? Should I wait until she does? What should I do?

But girls in my class say skaters/tomboys have to like horror, violence, eat meat, not like animals, not care about the environment, not sensitive and basically act like a jerk.      I hate horror, violence and I absolutely LOVE animals (vegetarian). I'm very sensitive and I care about our environment. The girls in my class probably think all guys are like what I just posted above (when I believe some boys are actually loving and gentle).      I'm very sporty, and I love any sport that has to do with water or a board. I dress like a skater. I don't go crazy for how I look (well I do try and dress classy and wear a tiny bit of makeup for special formal occasions like graduation) and I mostly act like a skater when I'm with people who are like me; somewhat tomboyish or like a skater (still act like a tomboy everywhere I go).      Girls in my class keep telling me I'm not a skater and just because I don't do as much sports as this girl in our class (she's between girly and sporty) I'm not a skater.

20090202130330AA21RLH	Society & Culture;Other - Society & Culture	Can someone help me with these critical thinking problems??  I'm lost!?	1) For each of the passages below, determine if the passage expresses an argument. If a passage expresses an argument then underline the conclusion and put (parentheses around the premises). Indicate whether the argument is deductive or inductive and give a reason for your answer (e.g., "probably" occurred in the conclusion or the argument has the form of a categorical syllogism). If a passage does not express an argument then state "no argument.".       1.1) Certainly, the Federal Government should eliminate affirmative action since this country is founded on a principle of equal treatment and affirmative action violates equal treatment.         1.2) Do CEOs believe it is important that all business graduates they hire have some education in the international aspects of business? To find out, we surveyed the CEOs of Forbes's "100 Largest Multinational Firms" and Fortune's "America's 50 Biggest Exporters." We found that: (1) Seventy-nine percent believed that all business majors should take an introduction to international business course. (2) About 70 percent felt that business graduates' expertise in foreign languages, international aspects of functional areas (e.g., marketing, finance), and business, human, or political relations outside the United States is an important consideration when making hiring decisions. (3) A majority of the respondents believed that a number of courses in the international business curriculum (e.g., international marketing, international finance, export-import, international management) are relevant to their companies. It appears from the study that the CEOs of the major American firms doing business overseas are convinced that the business graduates they hire should have some education in the international aspects of business.         1.3) Unlike others holocausts, the African holocaust has yet to be officially acknowledged as such. It has been referred to as many things such as "The Slavery Question," but never as a holocaust. However, there is no denying that a holocaust is exactly what it was. Official acknowledgment and redress for atrocities have been afforded other groups such as Japanese Americans, Native Americans, and Jews after the war with Germany. Similarly, therefore, official acknowledgment and redress for the African holocaust is due to African Americans.         1.4)  If you procrastinate then you lose valuable time for working on your assignments.  If you lose valuable time for working on your assignments then you will do poorly in the course.   So, if you procrastinate then you will do poorly in the course.       1.5) Repeal of the drug-prohibition laws will probably not lead to tremendous increases in drug-abuse levels. The reasons for this come from our past experience with alcohol and tobacco abuse. We now know, for instance, that consumption taxes are an effective method of limiting consumption rates. We also know that restrictions and bans on advertising, as well as a campaign of negative advertising, can make a difference. There is even some evidence that government-sponsored education programs about the dangers of cigarette smoking have deterred many children from beginning to smoke.         1.6) If an exchange of goods is voluntary then it must meet three conditions: both buyer and seller understand what they are giving up, neither party is coerced into the exchange, and both buyer and seller are able to make rational decisions about costs and benefits.      1.7) Few of us have heard of Harriet Wilson, the first African-American woman novelist, or Mourning Dove, the first Native American woman to write both a novel and an autobiography.   This is explained by the fact that few of their contemporaries were willing to buy their books and the books quickly went out of print.         1.8) Since the only duty of a business manager is to maximize the shareholder's return on her investment, and maximizing the shareholder's return on her investment can only be accomplished by maximizing profits, it definitely follows that the only duty of business managers is to maximize profits.         1.9) Leo Dolinski purchased a bottle of "Squirt," a soft drink, from a vending machine at a Sea and Ski plant, his place of employment. Dolinski opened the bottle and consumed part of its content. He immediately became ill. Upon examination, it was found that the bottle contained the decomposed body of a mouse, mouse hair, and mouse feces. Dolinski suffered physical and mental distress from consuming the decomposed mouse and now possesses an aversion to soft drinks. The Shoshone Coca-Cola Bottling Company manufactured and distributed the Squirt bottle. Dolinski has sued Shoshone using the doctrine of strict liability. The doctrine of strict liability holds that if a seller is engaged in the business of selling a product, the product reaches a consumer without substantial change in the condition in which it is sold, and the product is defective then the seller is liable for any physical harm caused

20090202192304AAHxw6l	Society & Culture;Holidays;Ramadan	Qur'an Alone People, The Billion Dollar Question? Part2?	Read and understand the Question, people answered the last question without even understanding, and started to think they answered the question, without even knowing the question.      Prophet Muhammad PBUH had made it forbidden for people to have intercourse during the nights of fasting.  The Qur'an never forbade it.  People began sinning and having intercourse during the nights.  Allah then revealed the verses saying that it was made forbidden for you, you still sinned, and Allah forgave you.  And now Allah is has made it permissible for you.  Why would Allah reveal this verse if the Prophets order was not authoritative part of Islam?      "It is made lawful to you to go into your wives on the night of the fast; they are an apparel for you and you are an apparel for them; Allah knew that you acted unfaithfully to yourselves, so He has turned to you (mercifully) and removed from you (this burden); so now be in contact with them and seek what Allah has ordained for you, and eat and drink until the whiteness of the day becomes distinct from the blackness of the night at dawn, then complete the fast till night, and have not contact with them while you keep to the mosques; these are the limits of Allah, so do not go near them. Thus does Allah make clear His communications for men that they may guard (against evil)" 2:187      From this we get 3 points:   1. Intercourse on the nights of fasting was a sin.   2. those who had intercourse were being unfaithful to themselves.    c. ‘so He accepted your repentance and forgave you’, clearly shows that breaking the Prophet PBUH rule was a sin, since ‘repenting’ and ‘forgiving’ only occur after a person commits a sin.

A pet peeve (or pet hate) is a minor annoyance that can instill great frustration in a very small group of people, yet is experienced by everyone. It also must be insignificant, so people insulting you is not a pet peeve. For example, if you find that elevator doors closing before you can get in annoys you, but does not annoy all the people around you, it is a pet peeve, as it meets all three criteria: insignificant, experienced by all, and only you and a few others are annoyed by it.    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pet_peeve

I'm 19 and never been in a relationship--ever. My mom and dad have a very rocky marriage; they separated and got back together X amount of times; mom is a police officer, so she didn't always deal with her own kids the right way; dad's an alcoholic; they fought a whole lot when I was little, and whenever I see them being affectionate it makes me nearly sick to my stomach. Growing up, my mom always reminded me of my first 2 relationships (back in kindergarten)--my first best friend and my first crush--neither of which worked out because, as my mom says, I'm clingy, which is why I shy away from relationships and pretend to be an emotional hard-a** now. I think my mom suspects I'm bi, and of course made sure to make me feel guilty for that too cuz she doesn't believe in that.
