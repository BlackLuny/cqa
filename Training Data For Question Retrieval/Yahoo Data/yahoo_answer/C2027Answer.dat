KLL0Acrwaa	Both lenses are 3x lenses, but here are the differences:    1) the 18-55mm is wider, but doesn't have as much telephoto power as the 28-90mm    2) the 28-90mm is better at bringing further objects closer (more telephoto).    3) the 18-55mm is better for getting wider shots, like landscapes.  Plus for interior shooting, like say, friends at a party, you'll appreciate being able to get a group shot without having to step back all the time.    4) I suggest keeping the 18-55mm as it will be more versatile.  If you need more telephoto, sell the 28-90mm and get a telephoto lens with more power (i.e. like a 70-300mm) for those times you really need telephoto.

sg1wfaTAaa	RROD is covered by the warranty. call xbox to send you a box or get your own to send it out with. make sure they give you credit for the subscription time used while the unit is being repaired. when it comes back keep the box handy because RROD can happen at any time to any system (original xbox and even the newer units)    ps   you're right that HD is HD. and HD is 1080p video and uncompressed audio. currently the only media format that can hold that much content is a blu-ray disc, which can be played on the ps3. there are no video games that currently output at 1080p (maybe some cut scenes or videos but there are no games rendered entirely in 1080p) but most games are done in 1080i or 720p or 768p.      with that in mind, when games do run fully at 1080p with uncompressed audio, only a blu-ray disc based system can handle that true HD format. which means xbox will have to come out with an external blu-ray player the way they did with hd-dvd or have a built-in blu-ray player into the next iteration of the xbox    but they will probably have to go with the external version until they can figure out the RROD issue because no one wants to buy a blu-ray player and get the RROD while watching a movie    but rest assured that xbox will come out with a new hardware version of the xbox every year until they get it right- that's what they've been doing since 2002|`|HUrYSp4oaa	yes if its ring of death then the warranty has been extended. u should contact xbox on the number given by the other person or if its uk there is a number on the website i think we just googled x box.|`|eD2SzJ2Jaa	Don't worry the red rings are an exception to the warranty, call 1-800-4 my-xbox they will handle it from there|`|q6uyloYdaa	There are no exceptions for the Elite system, but the red ring of death is itself an exception to the warranty. Every other problem is covered by a 1 year warranty by Microsoft. However, since the red ring of death was such a huge problem, they decided to extend a separate warranty just for that problem to 3 years. So basically what you can do is call 1-800-4MYXBOX and they can set you up with a repair. Since it's still covered they will fix the system for free, although it does take at least a week and a half to get it back.|`|XooW91hWaa	my boyfriend had the red ring of death 3 time's and every time he sent his xbox off and it was returned fixed each time free of charge. it's worth ringing microsoft and asking them. i know that the red ring was a known problem and yes they extended warranty just for this reason only. like i said ring microsoft they will tell you every thing you need to know. hope you get it sorted.

475c01dc76b1f175b986a137414d9e50aa	The first thing to do is figure out which input the interference is on - maybe it is a certain mic?  After that, try a different type of mic on that same input - if the interference is still there it may be the mic cable itself - try switching the mic cable.  Condenser mics are more prone to interference.  If it is a mic, this page may help - you will need to solder:    http://www.alphasoundandlighting.com/sou...    It could also be an instrument like a guitar or it's cable.

Gem96NQyaa	Right now, the "deals" kind of suck.  For the first two weeks, they marked everything up by about 10% and then gave a 10% discount on the new marked up price.  The only things that were really clearance-priced were things that were already marked as clearance to begin with.    If you want to get an actual deal, you're going to have to wait until they get a little more desperate to get rid of their inventory.  The sale is supposed to run all next month and part of March.  Probably in the next three weeks or so, they'll start dropping prices.  I'm going out every weekend to see what the current discount is.  Last Saturday, it was 15% on most items, 10% on big-ticket stuff.    What's really stupid is that people get all excited about 10% off (which barely covers state sales tax here) and buy things left and right.  All the PS3s and Xbox 360s at my local CC are gone, and they were never even marked down from their regular prices (because they marked them up 10% to begin with)!  LOL!  But the games that ARE marked down have barely sold at all.  People don't price check things before they buy, apparently.|`|iQf8Xjj5aa	I heard the deals are not what you would expect.

The screen was bright blue and black.  It was one of the first phones to have that phonic ringtone or whatever, that sounds like real music.  It was SO high-tech at the time, everyone was fascinated with it.  It also could record voice and you can create your own ring tones on it with different sounding instruments...This was back in like 2001 mind you..Pretty neat at the time! :)|`|TGtgMu8eaa	sony ericsson experia    but 2bh  sony ericsson w910i is great|`|DHuEqvYVaa	I have the next to lamest phone ever.

oVz0fde6aa	when you first buy a phone, the battery takes some time to get familiar with what you use the phone for. When i got the Google G1 the battery only lasted for about 4-5 hours, then i called the company and they told me that since the phone is new, it isn't unusual. No wit works fine. It also may be that the phone just has a bad battery and you need to replace it.|`|jtG41TXZaa	If your Bluetooth is turned on that can wear the battery down very fast. If you are playing music and taking photos that can wear the battery down too. I dont think there is anything wrong with your phone.  Hope this Helps|`|wntdMR8caa	if you had an open java application (a game set on standby, or even a IM application ,aim, yahoo, msn). and they kill the battery, texting KILLS batteries. and also it might just be a bad battery or phone... these are the kinds of things you should ask your service provider when they occur so go back to verizon or where ever and inquire about a new battery, just be sure to bring all of your equipment with you, they might need it to give you a new battery so its always good to be prepared and save time..|`|AZKHHfr5aa	I would say its probaly becuase when you bought the phonee you switched it on straigt away or unpluged it while it first started to charge.

It will change the life of a new phone battery. I would recommend letting it completely die and then charging it for a few hours to see what happens if this doesn't help you should get a new battery and start over.(that or call the company for manufacturing defaults)|`|48e9baf113e4951f779199c900a19f63aa	Are you sure the phone was new?

jKc7aDCwaa	It looks like it does:     http://www.gamefaqs.com/console/wii/code...    Getting good at Ghosts N Goblins and Ghouls N Ghosts is it's own reward. You are of few in the gaming world, master of a absolutely maddening genre, knowing where all the secret chest jumps are at, where most gamers would give up knowing they can't even be bothered to get halfway through the first stage, jumping from heights becomes almost intuitive later on when you're jumping blindly for stumps that you HOPE will emerge from the lava. There's nothing realistic or applicable to the real world about some plumber jumping over barrels and trying to save some girl from a gorilla. Having to chuck lances into sausage roll ghosts bombarding you with green onions in your underwear? That's Tuesday to me, baby.
1HtTxOOQaa	Yes cause MGS4 was based to cater guys who knew the entire series.  I played MGS4 without playing any previous titles and couldn't understand a thing. And as much as I liked the cut scenes first, after sometime, it became frustrating to a point where even skipping the scenes became a chore.  K2 is meant for everyone who loves FPS accompanied with great graphics(Crysis). IGN, NG4 and various other sites who have previewed the game have given a thumbs up. I just can't wait for this game.    By the way don't ever even look for a PS3 exclusive review from the 360 mag. Those Xbots will always fall back on their age old slogan 'Halo is better' if K2 turns out to be the best FPS.

You are going to have to do a little research yourself.  Look on the various websites for their tower maps.  If you live in a gap, it won't matter how good people think that service is.  Ask your neighbors, family, friends who are in close proximity.  Contract plans are always cheaper for heavy users.  I have always found AT&Ts website the easiest to shop for minute/data plans, and the best place to get free phones.    US cellular has some neat calling plans and features, but again check the map.    Verizon usually gets props for their network, but people gripe about customer service.    Sprint is in the hole right now, (financially) but their new CEO will probably bring them back strong.  Their network and 'aircards' are good.      AT&T has given me 3 free batteries over the years, has really good customer service and a fairly large number of corporate retail stores.

fxXJZZRKaa	If you decide to upgrade to 2.2.1 and then rejailbreak it, you will lose all data that you had installed via the jailbreak. For example any paid apps that you got for free, or the winterboard downloads, etc. So my recommendation to you is leave it as it is. Firmware 2.2 to 2.2.1 is NOT a big difference. Just a fix abou a few bugs, that's all. It wouldn't make a difference, nor will it seem worth it.     But if you wanna redownload everything after rejailbreaking it you are more than welcome to do so. http://www.quickpwn.com/downloads    Read their blog, they don't recommend upgrading it either.

XcqppKaOaa	When you connect it, what does it do?    1)  It may have run out of battery.  If so, just leave it charging for awhile, then come back and turn it on, and see what it does.  This happened to mine on the second day of having it and it took FOREVER to actually go to the menu (off of the Apple logo).  Sometimes, the iPod will stay on without you knowing it because the screen goes dark and then the battery is completely down and you have to recharge it for at least 30 minutes to even get it to go to the menu.    2)  Restoring your iPod:  If you have any more problems, you might have to restore.  There is a restore when you connect your iPod to your computer.  It's on iTunes, where it says the name of your iPod.  This will clean everyone off of your iPod Touch (music, videos, pics, everything)    3)  Reset.  Hold down the button on the top of the iPod Touch and the round button on the face of the iPod Touch at the same time.  This will reset it but will NOT restore it.    Good luck!  I hope you fix your iPod Touch.  I know how frustrating it can be -__-|`|TnPiiwoAaa	Try take it down to an apple store, they might be able to flash the rom for you to get it starting again, provided you didn't actually drop or break it.|`|rDsKB0uXaa	Im afraid its toasted my friend|`|xU9Qhczqaa	push and hold menu button and on/off button at top    plug it into computer     and if that dont work send back to apple

I hate it when that happens.  Apple is in deep with Digital Rights Management.  The recording industry loves it.  You may have very well lost your library.  The only way to get your songs back is if you've backed them up somewhere else. Even if you want to share your library between your desktop and laptop, you'd still have to import the songs from a hard non ipod source.    You might be able to search your computer for files as long as you didn't format the disk.  go to the search bar and click the mp3 file type and see if you can locate your files.  Then you can just re add them to itunes.  (THEN, back it up on an external hard-drive, or start making discs. MP3, not CDaudio)  Then, once you have your music library isolated, you can port it to whatever computer you want.    Bummer, pain, I know.  It's why I haven't bought more Apple products.

DbmbwnzCaa	Thee Best!!   I would defenetley recomend it. Best game for wii except mario kart :D    Heres some features and stuff    Animal Crossing: City Folk's gameplay is built upon the gameplay of previous Animal Crossing games. The Wii Remote pointer and motion controls (including the Nunchuk) can be used for handling tools, such as axes, fishing rods and bug-catching nets.[1] Also, players live in individual houses spread apart from each other, unlike Animal Crossing, in which all four houses are located in a central plaza, and Animal Crossing: Wild World, in which all players share one house. Each town begins with six animal residents, and can grow to a maximum of ten. In previous iterations of Animal Crossing, the player can only customize clothes as a whole; in City Folk, the player can customize the front, back and sleeves of clothes; these are called "Pro" designs.    The player will be able to celebrate as time progresses several real world holidays, such as Christmas Eve, Christmas Day, Thanksgiving, Easter, Fathers Day, Mothers Day, and Halloween, although they are named differently in the game itself.[2] Holiday-associated characters from previous games return, as well as new additions such as Zipper T. the Easter Bunny, Pav (a peacock who celebrates "Festivale"), and Nat (a chameleon who hosts the "Bug-off").    City    The city is a new area added to the game. The player can go there by taking a bus from town, driven by Kapp'n. On their journey there, they will sometimes talk to Rover, the game's introductory character.    The city includes the following areas:        * Redd's Shop: After acquiring an invitation (from a local villager or a friend on Wi-Fi), the player can enter Redd's shop and buy furniture and paintings. Some furniture is rare, but some is common furniture sold at a higher price.      * An ABD (Automatic Bell Dispenser, also known as the "Bellpoint" in PAL versions of the game): Players are able to deposit and withdraw bells from the ABD much like an ATM, although players do not have to enter a PIN. Players can also access their balance from an ABD in the Town Hall. Once enough bells are deposited the player receives a debit-like card which can be used to pay for purchases directly from their bank account when they don't have enough Bells with them, but this can only be used at Gracie Grace.      * The Marquee: Here players can pay a fee to watch a performance by Shrunk to learn emotions, which can now be used outside the keyboard screen. The choices of emotions change every Sunday.      * The Happy Room Academy Office: Run by Lyle. Here, players can view how other members' homes rank via Wi-Fi. Players then can view a "model room" to see what the style of the month is. If players choose to copy this theme, they get extra points.[3]      * Gracie Grace: A high-class furniture and clothing shop run by a porcupine named Labelle. Gracie occasionally appears. The stock is updated every season. The prices are high, so have a lot of money in hand.      * The Auction House: Run by a Gyroid named Lloid, players can buy and sell one item per week over Wi-Fi. Check to see when you can bid and display items.      * Kicks: A shoe-shining skunk. Players can get the color or style of their shoes changed. The color will be changed to the color or style that is most common in their current outfit.[citation needed]      * Shampoodle: A hairdressing salon run by Harriet. Here, the player can change the color and style of the character's hair or apply a mask resembling a Mii stored in the Wii.      * Katrina's Shop: Katrina, a psychic feline,[4] can tell players their future or how to benefit others for a fee.      * Resetti's Surveillance Center: Accessible on random days after 8 p.m., Resetti conducts surveillance activities from his small cave. To get to Resetti's, go to the right as soon as you get off the bus in the city. Often there will be cones there, but sometimes there will not.      * Phineas: On fair-weathered days, Phineas, a seal, waits with his cart in the city. The player can choose to obtain a gift such as a bubble blower, balloon, or pinwheel.|`|BMConIedaa	Its fun.  Addicting, but very fun.|`|lcMWoe8xaa	I didn't buy it for the single reason that I have the one for ds. To me this one seemed a bit like the same thing but with a few things added.

k6vJU1r2aa	If you have a dehydrator (like one for veggies, etc) put it in pieces(the phone), (take the battery OUT) and put it in there.  other wise, a cool setting of a blow dryer, (also in pieces).  Never try to dry out a phone in a Microwave or tumble dryer.    As far as text messages, AT&T lets you send online, but not receive.|`|WWxMfGvTaa	This might sound stupid but you can put it in the freezer or the fridge and it will dry it out.  And to view your text messages it depends on what carrier you have.  You can Go to the main website and go to your account and check them there.  I hope this helps.  Good Luck.

I8yV5Hglaa	While AAC format is compatible, protected AAC is likely not.  Check if any of your songs are from the iTunes Store or anything.    I'm not sure about the "99 artists" thing, but I would think it would tell you once you hit your limit.

wX4KAOTZaa	If certain update's(Firmware would be the proper name) are needed for supporting feature's in game then the game will come with the latest firmware on the game disc, so in most case's you don't 'need' to download the patch. For example Motorstorm:Pacific Rift let's you take screen-shot's and listen to your own music and get 'Trophy's'. The music and trophy's is from update 2.40 and the screen-shot ability came in on Firmware 2.50, which mean's that MS:PR will come with at the least Firmware 2.50 to upgrade your PS3.  When you go online it will tell you if your PS3 need's a Firmware update and download it for you.  Some games may need a patch to themselves, fixing bug's etc, and these will need to be downloaded though only if they are really badly affecting you.    Current Firmware is 2.60.|`|HekFanRvaa	It also applies to offline games. And those are not Sony updates but game developers updates. Not all games are exclusive for Sony.|`|AA12268785	the firmware is not for online games u need them to use PSN and you need them to play new Games   of course all new games that need new firmwares have it on their blu-ray
6000349dbd0a8f8b344256f6899b5461aa	I'd go with the Kindle if I were you. I have the Kindle and my sister bought the Sony 700, the touchscreen one. She's way into the touchscreen tech - tablet PC, iPhone, iPod touch, Sony DSC-T700, etc.    I still liked my Kindle better. Except that the Sony Reader has a built in LED light. It's $399.     You can buy books at ebookstore.sony.com. I found that Kindle books are cheaper than Sony ebooks.    Another advantage of Kindle is that you can buy books directly from your device. Whispernet is fantastic. So if you are living in an area that has Sprint coverage, you do not have to connect your Kindle to your computer. You can receive the books you purchase in under a minute.    If you really can't wait, then go for the Sony reader, the opportunity cost is the Whispernet.|`|7pJ8S0Liaa	The best program I have seen is a READ ME program.

That's because it doesn't have one.  It doesn't have a camera lens because it does not have a camera.  Therefore it cannot take pictures.  It can only take screenshots.|`|Vxy7fV5jaa	If you had a brain, you would know that iPod touches dont have cameras!!!

HBNx77BBaa	You've done a good job of shortlisting. Both cameras are good and on the face of it the zoom is the decision maker. However, I would choose the A590IS even if the two were the same price.    As a starting point compare the A590IS with the A1000IS which is identical to the A2000IS but has the same zoom range as the A590IS. The resolution of the two cameras is so similar it doesn't much matter. However, in the A1000IS you have lost the optical viewfinder and you have lost the manual, aperture priority and shutter priority modes. All these things make the A590IS a very attractive camera to those with an interest in photography.    The ability to take manual control when you wish to makes the A590IS a much more versatile tool. You may not think you need that and it really does depend on how interested you get. Since you've put a lot of work in, I think you are probably someone who would resent being locked out of the camera's decision making process.    Does the 6x zoom of the A2000IS make up for the shortcomings of it's near-twin the A1000IS? No, certainly it wouldn't for me.    I'm in the fortunate postion of having an 18x zoom (a Lumix FZ18). I tend to use that in the widest setting a lot. I sometimes zoom in a little, no more than about 4x. And, I ocassionally use it on 18x to try to catch birds. They always need a bit more zoom than I've got, but that's another story. In other words, the vast majority of the time a 4x zoom is all I need and a 6x would offer no significant benefit.    So, for me the A590IS would be the one to go for. If you were prepared to pay a little more, I'd have a close look at the Lumix LZ8. It doesn't have an optical viewfinder but it does have the manual modes. Have a look at this review, in which both the A590IS and the LZ8 are compared with others in broadly the same price range. The A590IS did well, as it usually does in reviews, but it was pipped to the post by the LZ8 in this review...    http://www.dpreview.com/reviews/Q408budg...    (For me, it would still be the A590IS!)|`|0JV3tQm8aa	Canon Powershot A590IS is great    Thanks|`|a9398092706b68241341a0195af9943eaa	I could be wrong, but I don't see where the A2000 has manual controls, plus no viewfinder, I'd be buying the much cheaper A590 IS.   Amazon.com has it for $109-+ shipping.|`|HX1O5BLsaa	Im in the same field you're in right now. I've probably have read over a million reviews and to your advantage I haven't heard a single bad review of the canon powershot a590is. I've talked to a ton of people who have one that just absolutely love them. If I were you id just go with the a590is unless you anticipate zooming a whole lot I figure with out having the extra zoom you could always step a few feet closer. Camera makers try to make their cameras so full of cool stuff that most of it for the average photographer is unnessesary. ;]
RyvKws7Laa	You would be looking at about 20 to 22" model at most.  Remember that if you're using the stand, the height is then increased slightly as well.  If you're wall mounting without the stand, then the physical dimension of the body is the real height you need to be worried about.    Just go to the full specs of any TV you're looking at.  They always list the dimensions for you.  You can then find one that is only 16" high.|`|qHEpR92Gaa	http://www.overstock.com/Electronics/Zen...

For example  for a game like crysis  these are the requirements      Crysis System Requirements - Official    Minimum system requirements  from Crytek and EA    OS - Windows XP or Windows Vista  Processor - 2.8 GHz or faster (XP) or 3.2 GHz or faster* (Vista)  Memory - 1.0 GB RAM (XP) or 1.5 GB RAM (Vista)  Video Card -256 MB**   Hard Drive - 12GB  Sound Card - DirectX 9.0c compatible  Recommended System Requirements  from Crytek and EA    OS - Windows XP / Vista  Processor - Intel Core 2 DUO @ 2.2GHz or AMD Athlon 64 X2 4400+  Memory - 2.0 GB RAM   GPU - NVIDIA GeForce 8800 GTS/640 or similar    so it means u need to buy a graphic card which is compatible to run the game.
AA12336121	2 red rings is overheating. If you're repeatedly getting it, you'll need to send in your console to service.    However, in some cases, loose peripherals (hard drive, power supply, A/V cable) can cause 2 red rings.    Now, about getting the game out of the tray. It IS possible to manually eject the tray:  http://support.microsoft.com/kb/906935    Once you get the game out, try to troubleshoot the Xbox. If you can't get it working, arrange for a repair online:  http://support.xbox.com/support/en/us/nx...    Hope this helps!|`|LKiVXEcCaa	Ok first off turn it on and get your game out. Then if you have a warranty call xbox tell them the situation and they'll go through steps with you. BUT either way there gonna say either take it back where you got it, and since you got it yesterday I think your covered, and exchange it or they'll have you send it in to them|`|L0oYML7Oaa	try unplugging the power supply and letting it sit for say 72 hours then if you really want the game and it starts to work turn it on using the eject button this should help get your xbox working
yM7YPmzSaa	Call sanyo
eezTHTWQaa	Its really annoying but no, hopefully LG will start making new ones and some motion games because at the moment theres hardly any out there. Sooner or later if LG doesnt release some themes, some sort of hacker will figure out how to do it and start uploading them on the internet for everyone to use. Well i hope so anyway!
da6SPEe2aa	They marked the prices on everything up to suggested retail price first (no stores sell at manufacturers' suggested prices). Then, they applied 10% off to everything in the store.     Basically, they are closing the stores that are not busy and are not selling, and shipping their inventory to the ones that are. This way, they don't need to mark things down an additional percentage, but they will be able to liquidate all of the chain's inventory. It is possible they will lower prices a little bit more, if you live near one that will stay open because it is selling. The individual stores close dates are also determined by their leases. The one near me is very busy and pulling in a lot of merchandise, but it will be closing in Feb. because of its lease.    Their products are being sold as-is, as already stated. You don't even have the typical 30 day return policy. I'd buy things like CDs or DVDs there, maybe, but make sure you shake them to verify they haven't come off the prongs and scratched. I certainly wouldn't make any big purchases there. You'd be better off going to Best Buy or somewhere similar. Prices will be comparable to the 10% off prices-that-are-way-too-high, and you'll have a retailer that will be there in a month to back you up.|`|AA11828439	Prices are fair, but everything is sold as is. No guarantee on anything. Buy at your own risk.|`|7Z9U4f5paa	I can't go. they've closed here in Ohio.
UXwFJOwuaa	it all depends on who you are with. i just upgraded on orange although my contract didnt expire until march, the last 2 months will add on to my new contract.so a 12mth contract is now 14 mths.  you get to change the tarriff you are on so if you want a cheaper or more expensive one you can change it. and you can get a more up to date phone too. the link below is the site i upgraded on.  i got the LG Cookie, with a free laptop and a free blutooth headset, it was all delivered next day. and there are lots of combinations., if you are on o2 or orange you can upgrade there but it seems any other network require you to upgrade directly, but if you google  upgrade on  you will find a site that does it.|`|A1S5KNUkaa	Generally when you're upgrading you can alter your talkplan to whatever suits you and the handsets available are usually based on your last 6 months bills (the more you've spent the more handsets are available).    I'd also advise going into your local store and seeing what they can offer you as well as calling the network directly as they usually have different deals available.    Hope this helps =)
ncCWnApDaa	World of Goo is a great game, but then I would say that with a user name like mine, but seriously it is rewarding and original game with a lot of replay value, Lost Winds is an good platform game if a little short, and My Life as a King is an ok game but too expensive you have to buy additional download-able content to get the most out of it, and while it can be an enjoyable game its just not worth the money.|`|224d1d60d1b56362532d0d7f33ab994daa	World of Goo, yes, great game. Challenging and quirky.    I d/l'ed the Target Toss game too and have enjoyed it.    Big Kahuna gets lots of play at my house too.|`|xkqjtawKaa	I never checked out World of Goo. It depends what you like. If you like trivia, you can check out TV Show Kings.

HsSn9H5Iaa	Ive got that phone and it's the best phone ive ever had. it does everything and is yet to brake and easy to use. Id give it a 8 ouT of ten and its the best phone around at the moment apart from the N96|`|boeLZJkvaa	Here is a report on the Nokia N85    In a nutshell: The Nokia N85 is almost the same as the N96. It's slimmer but still comes with GPS satellite navigation, a 5 megapixel camera with autofocus, 3G video calling, WiFi, fast 3G HSDPA and support for 8GB memory cards. The screen is slightly smaller than the N96, but is still an outstanding OLED display with 16 million colours. We see this as an excellent alternative to the N96, if you want to save a few pennies.  Best buy: *Free* with a choice of free gifts from Dialaphone.      What exactly is the Nokia N85? At a glance it looks just like the Nokia N96, but slimmer. It has almost every feature of the N96 too:    Series 60 Symbian interface (version 3.2)   5 megapixel camera with Carl Zeiss & Tessar optics   aGPS and GPS navigation with Nokia Maps   Wi-Fi wireless internet connection   3.5 mm stereo headphone plug   Ultra-fast HSDPA data transfer   Support for 8GB microSD memory cards   The only things missing are the support for DVB-H TV (which doesn't exist in the UK anyway) and the 16 GB of built-in memory. Instead, the N85 has 74 MB of internal dynamic memory and 78 MB of internal NAND flash memory. But you can add microSD memory cards up to 8GB, so this really isn't a problem.    The design is a little different from the N96, with a slightly reduced screen size (2.6 inches instead of 2.8 inches) and a different keypad. There's little else to distinguish the two phones, so read our Nokia N96 review for more information about what the phone can do, and read the detailed specification below.    The N85 is a cheaper phone, so on contract you can expect to get it for free with a shower of free gifts - expect to get a free 8GB memory card, plus cashback or a free iPod, XBOX 360 or similar. With such a small difference between the N85 and the N96 we think it should really be called the N95 and a half! It's definitely a very good value alternative to the N96.    Features of the Nokia N85 include:    Series 60 Symbian interface (version 3.2)   5 megapixel camera (2592 x 1944 pixels) with Carl Zeiss optics, Tessar lens, autofocus, dual led flash, 20x digital zoom   Video camera: MPEG4/3GP VGA video capture at 640 x 480 pixels and 30 frames/second with digital stereo microphone (AAC format) and 10x digital zoom   Front camera for video calling: 352 x 288 pixels, 15fps, 2x digital zoom   Video and still image editors   Display: OLED, 16 million colours, 240 x 320 pixels (2.6 inches)   Digital music player (supports MP3/AAC/AAC+//WMA/AMR formats) with playlists and equalizer   Stereo FM radio with Visual Radio support   aGPS and GPS navigation with Nokia Maps   Voice commands   Voice recorder   Talking ringtone   Integrated hands-free speaker   Speed dialing   Messaging: SMS, MMS, Email (support for attachments)   Push to talk (PoC)   Java games   Memory: 152 Mbytes plus microSD memory card slot (max 8 Gbytes)   Connectivity: Bluetooth 2.0, USB 2.0, WLAN, TV-Out, 3.5 mm stereo headphone plug   WAP, EGPRS class B, WCDMA/HSDPA (3.6Mb/s download)   Quadband plus 3G   Size: 103 x 50 x 16 mm   Weight: 128g   Talktime: 4.5 hours (3G) - 6.9 hours (2G)   Battery standby: 360 hours       REVEIWS!!!!!!    Reviewed by Joshua from Australia on 9th Jan 2009  Dayum, this phone kicks butt. Likes - Wifi, GPS (Nokia Maps 2.0 works brilliantly and Integrated GPS is free, unless you also go online network to use the A-GPS, which your carrier will charge for data). User interface and applications easy, straight forward to use(for me anyway), Nokia PC Suite and Ovi easy to sync all the contents ie contacts, msg, photos, videos. Note read instructions/manual for a stress free setup. Dislikes - No Xenon flash, no silent camera sound option unless its from the US (if anyone knows how to disable camera sound will be great for Australia N85). Dual slide not exactly solid, but no biggie. Easily hooked on mobile internet which causes a packet. Keypad a bit fiddly but will get used to it. Overall, very good phone, just short of excellence. Has 95% of stuff most ppl will be happy with. If only it has Xenon flash, no camera sound option, better slide like the C905, better keypad , it will be the perfect smartphone until N97 comes out.    for reveiws check this site

After this go to your iPod menu in iTunes and select the Video tab and manually sync.|`|2CKd6qp9aa	You should make sure the video is MP4 or H2.64 format, the audio is Mp3 format for iPod. I like the DVD to iPod Converter Suite to rip DVD movie and convert videos in any format to iPod. It is the fastest converter I have used. Also, the output quality is great.

Some useful information you can get on the official site:  http://www.ipod.com   Also, you can google some other software:  http://www.google.com|`|YmP2NRTyaa	Take any video that you would like to use. Make sure it is in the format of .mov or .mp4 or another iTunes compatible format. If not, convert the video at http://www.media-convert.com. It's free and does not require you to download anything. Once you have that. Click and drag your video into the "Movies" section of itunes. When it is in there highlight it and then go into the "advanced" menu. When you get there click on "Convert for iPod/iPhone" once that is done, sync your iPod. It should then play on you iPod. Hope this works!

If you had all the recommended system requirements for Fallout 3 before you made this purchase, then the 9600 GT will dramatically increase your PC's performance.     The NVIDIA Geforce 9600 GT is a fairly modern graphics card currently available on the market. It will play Fallout 3 easily on full settings (the game only requires a pathetic 6800 accelerator card).     However, having said this, the 9600 GT will make little difference if your total physical memory or RAM is only 1 GB or under, as you may still have issues of lag or other complications with Fallout 3. For gaming at the moment you should at least have an AMD 4500+ running at 2.0GHz. On top of that, you MUST have a dual core processor or above.|`|5gqc5qyzaa	Well that kinda depends on what you had before, doesn't it? Fallout 3 is fairly well coded so you should be ok graphics-wise, but it also depends on what else you got in the PC.

I don't know what the costs are in the Republic, but I can give you the UK costs.  The phone is a one off cost of around 50-70.  Then you can top up by 10, which will give you 90 days Skype plus 30 days msn messenger.  You can also use your 10 to either to buy an internet pack, or a stretch, which would allow you extra minutes and texts.  The 3 website would give you more details.

RpCwfcRzaa	You're not supposed to have anything in your gamertag that reveals what sex you are. It's against the terms of service for Live. I advise against doing this because you'll get a lot of unwanted attention from pervs and you will come off as an attention seeker which in turn will cause more unwanted harassment. I suggest you choose something nondescript, but that's it's still meaningful to you.|`|hWm4DjrJaa	yea milk is soooo right you dont want to draw attention to yourself because some guys are just nobs.  you should go with something unisex  maybe a nickname or character you liked when you were small|`|9ae55890a5fcfea5236690724138dc1faa	I cant really tell you, it ought to be something you come up with and something that wont go out of date.

And just be careful with who you add.|`|68b4a6bb7c57acc66dc2a0d734cfb4ccaa	try to make your gamertag original. maybe use what your friends call you or use a nickname you like. you can also use what you like to do. for example, you can be Collage Girl 53 or something of that sort.|`|VPnCk2Muaa	Milk is right.

3yvuMkzTaa	You cannot use a Verizon phone on AT&T!!!|`|OosO8xxcaa	Hi. You wouldn't be able to use that Blackberry unless you switch over to Verizon's service. AT&T runs on a GSM network as well as T-mobile. Verizon and Sprint runs on a CDMA. Unfortunately, phones could not be unlocked or changed to switch networks. Hope this helps!

AA11256390	Don't worry, it's highly likely he's telling you the truth. The phone company will block both the handset and the SIM but normally in these situations the owner of the phone will want a replacement from insurance if it's covered or will buy their own. In turn the phone company will send out a replacement SIM with the same number as before. Therefore your answerphone service will not cease. People will still be able to leave messages and text the number and you will retrieve them all when you put the SIM in the new handset and it becomes active|`|tsaPnLzDaa	I believe so.|`|8soXWEh7aa	The sim card will be disabled so no I wouldn't think so.|`|0256768370823943bbd15e024f80932daa	well when my mom got a new phone she got her same  number on the phone and everytime someone called her the old phone would also ring but you couldnt answer it from the old phone|`|doeg7JSaaa	Call your phones company and report your phone stolen so they can block and disable it then the thief will not profit from his theft.

And in high school when I locked it, they had to give me a whole new sim card lol.. So they put the AT&T sim card into my Cingular phone :]|`|IcnilUuUaa	Yes its the same company.

fDKQswMgaa	A locked cellphone basically means that you can only use it on the network that you bought it on. You can pay to get them unlocked, and yes, this means that they work on every network. Depending on the type of phone, the cost varies.  This means if you unlock your iPhone, then it means you should be able to use it on whatever network you wish. I should ensure it's unlocked first before you buy it though.  I think it only works with SIM cards too. But don't quote me on that.|`|xDBZVswtaa	no u would have to use the phone on a network that uses a sim card in the us i believe it is only att or t mobile..it cannot be used on verizon..sorry|`|RCdm5LzAaa	with a couple exceptions (the storm and the 8830) you can't use verizon phones on att networks.  verizon phones will only work on cdma networks....    the same applies to att....they're GSM and you can't use GSM phones on a CDMA network.    the two exceptions on verizon are the new blackberry storm and the blackberry 8830 world edition phones.  they are both CDMA and GSM phones and can be used on both types of networks.    You can unlock the storm here:  http://www.gsmunlocklabs.com/unlock-blac...|`|Ogu8kZGxaa	no idea lol|`|2570b9df07ea87faedc36db3ab90c0e2aa	I recently sold my cell phone. I called verizon and had it locked until they received it. When the buyer received the phone I called verizon back and had the phone unlocked so they could get whatever plan and service they wanted to. So yes when it's unlocked it can then be used with most services, you do need to check though.
LTvReFIxaa	Go into a "Verizon Store" and they will do it for her ... they shouldn't charge you for it (I've never paid for it, at least).    ... OR ... she should be able to "upload" her pics onto the verizon wireless website, and then transfer them into the new phone ... ask them online:  http://wirelesssupport.verizon.com/phone...|`|faddb3c58c57bc112ff5dec44a742ff8aa	Has she tried `bluetoothing` them over?|`|Y32zA5Mfaa	I don't know about the sim card, but I just asked this in a Verizon store 2 days ago.  He told me that she can either (1) send each picture to her email one by one (he said unless you have the unlimited plan, it will be 50 cents each), or (2) you can bring both the phones in to a Verizon store, and they have a machine that will do it for you.  It will cost money though (I think he said $10 or something like that).|`|q1rPAlBLaa	thats the only way u can keep them... if theres no sim card she can either buy an sd card if the phone is capable orrrr she can send her pictures to an email using text..... but she wont have them on her new phone....    if she buys a sd card she has to save all her pictures to it....|`|DDduZ5q5aa	Ya Verizon Wireless doenst use Sim cards so you can either take it in to Verizon Wireless or send them trough text or email.

OosO8xxcaa	Hi- If you are switching over to AT&T and it is NOT a prepaid, you are going to be locked into a 2 or a 1 year contract. If you get service with them and buy a phone there, the SIM card comes with the phone. I recommend getting a 1 year contract if you do not want a 2 year. You would probably pay a little bit more of front, but you don't have to pay for the extra year of service. Also- if you buy a used AT&T phone and took it to the store to activate, they probably might just give you the sim card. Let me know if you have any further questions. I used to work for the four major carriers. Hope that helps!|`|8C6bt7Gvaa	Yes it would be wiser, because to even get a sim card that works you would have to have some sort of contract/service

fEH81Yamaa	I'm currently using a 2 wire at the moment. It works great wirelessly. I can run up to four items wirelessly at once. as well as four items hardwired.    One day, just to stress test the thing I connected three Nintendo DS to it, one running Mario Kart DS, another running Pokemon Diamond, and the third running Phantom Hourglass. Then I connected my Wii running Smash Bros. Brawl. I hardwired my 360, PC, PS2, and original Xbox and had the following games running, GTA 4 (360), Socom (PS2), Halo 2 (xbox), and was playing Left 4 Dead on the PC. I didn't experience any hiccups at all with any of the games running. However sometimes the PC can be a network hog when streaming videos. I got my router/modem through AT&T DSL internet service.    I don't own a PS3, but I figured that might have helped in your decision to try a 2wire. Just be warned sometimes the network will crash and you have to either unplug or turn off the router and get it back on so that you can connect.|`|ytNlz3b7aa	Huh? What?|`|i2DHNn3aaa	Yes 2 wire modems work great.|`|58kA85wLaa	ok, first off there is not a problem with your ps3    i had this same exact problem and it got me so mad i almost punched a hole in my wall.lol    u r getting signed out because your computers or laptops are interfering with the wireless connection so u need to simply turn ur ps3 and computers/laptops off.     then u wait five minutes. when the five minutes is up turn on ur ps3 but leave ur computers/laptops off    it should work    u can check to make sure that u will not get signed out by goig 2 network settings. check ur nat type. if it is type 1 then u will not get signed off    also, if this fails even though it shouldnt u should make ur router private cuz a neibor could be using it
r4FJjEGiaa	Sounds like you run the memory to its limits. Go to options > status and look at file free. If its lower than 4 mil bytes, there's your problem. You HAVE to keep enough memory on the phone to function or blackberry's will keep giving you a hard time. You say you text a lot. Do you keep all your text messages or do you delete them. You should be deleting them regularly or once again.. the phone will give you a lot of problems.
RpQfIQXmaa	You can't yet the rev team is working on the itouch 2g
qwqvng2gaa	If you do not have a router, you will have to connect the wii with a wire. They sell them at radioshack. Just hook up the internet that way. But, if you are in a location that an internet plug is unavailable, you have to move the wii or play w/o internet|`|N9nJWYa5aa	To play online you are going to need some type of Internet connection.  We know you don't have a wireless router, but if you have a wired router, then you can buy a "SPECIFIC" USB to ethernet adapter for the Wii and connect that way.  If you don't have access to the internet, how did you post your question?|`|0YnEvKlMaa	ive seen bunch of them for 15 - 30 dollars but usually you have to buy a wireless router|`|ImAg8BBeaa	Unless you bought a USB Wi-Fi adapter a few months ago, then you'll need a wireless router for internet play. I recomend a G, because you dont need anymore than that. I got my router for $60, and for Downloadable Content, or Wii-Ware, you need a Wii Points card. They're around $20. (The USB Adapters were discontinued because they had a tendency to melt to the floor...)|`|fEH81Yamaa	well you sir are in luck. You have two options. One of them is going to allow the wii access through a wired connection, but the DS can't connect.    Wired: You can buy the Wii LAN adapter for $24.99 from gamestop  http://www.gamestop.com/Catalog/ProductD...    All you do is plug this into one of the USB ports on the wii, take an ethernet cord and plug it into the adapter and run the cord to your router, do the setup process in the wii's system settings menu. You should connect.    THe other way is to get the Nintendo WFC USB adapter which will recognize I want to say four DS and a Wii. However the PC would have to be on, and Nintendo has discontinued making them. Your best bet would be to find them used.    http://shop.ebay.com/items/_W0QQ_nkwZnin...    You install, and configure the software on your PC, then configure the Wii to connect to that. But as I said you MUST have your PC on otherwise you will not be able to connect as there is no power being sent to the adapter.    Hope that helps, and enjoy Nintendo WFC (I recommend checking out the Wii shop channel and download some awesome retro games as well as WiiWare's World of Goo and Lost Winds.)

When someone calls your land phone (long distance) they pay for the call. I'm not aware of any 'minutes' restrictions on land phones.    If someone calls your cell phone, unless your service plan has a condition where no minutes are used if someone on the same service calls, or if you don't have some kind of "family" plan where certain people can call you for 'free', then even if you are the receiver of the call, your minutes will be used during the duration of the call.|`|k3ZFlXvZaa	When a person on a land line calls a cell phone...

3K1QW7Oeaa	You can't.    Most phones don't even go past 10 min.
Fg5qosaSaa	You can get a sim card and put it in the Blackberry. It can be a prepaid sim card, which will trick the Blackberry into sending texts, etc, but the internet won't work. It's like what I told my boyfriend to do with his I-Phone. He put a T-Mobile sim card in it. He can send texts and make calls on it.... lol. And AT&T (the company that charges for the iphone) has NO clue and they have no way of finding out anyway.     You just have to find a sim card that will fit. I checked and the BB Pearl does have a sim card.     If you buy a BRAND new BB unlocking it will be harder to "unlock" it so that the company doesn't harass you, than if you buy an "unlocked" bb online and just put a sim card in it. So you'd need to buy an unlocked bb. Cheaper anyways.     Or... there IS a way to buy the bb WITHOUT the data plan, which means no internet, email... but yes to texts and voice. And there IS a way  to hack the phone so it works with internet in some places. Lol. Talk to me about this.     Quote from an online site/source: "Jus cos you have a BB doesn't mean you have to have a BB plan."    Hope this helped. ;) Just talk to me if you need more info... lol.|`|jayk5X77aa	ll'

dVK7E5Kiaa	Hi,    Actually you can combine online faxing and VOIP phone service to get this features. Online faxing will not use your phone line, since it faxes over the internet. And you can talk to your conact with a VOIP phone service during the entire process! Sweet huh?    - Manage All your Fax, Voicemail & Email Communications  - Instant Phone and Fax Number for Your Business  - Online Service - Easy to Use Web Interface  - Use with Your Existing Phones, PC or add VoIP    learn how to get started with this service at http://onlinefaxfree.net/voip-and-fax.ht...    You will save tons of money (a fax machine is the most energy consuming office machine not to mention what you waste on paper and ink) and you will be able to send a fax 24/7 and use the phone at the same time!    hope this information helps! I switched over to this service last year and it is great, visit the link below to get started!|`|9CKrP9Keaa	The fax machine you're looking for will be released when Pigs Fly.|`|XA4Sa81Xaa	theghost is right theres no fax machine that can do that, yet.    I think the best thing for you if you want to be able to do call and fax at the same time is to get an account with Onesuite.com. You can make calls either using Onesuite voip or prepaid calling card and send/receive fax online, at the same time all in one account.    But if you insist on using a fax machine to be able to call and fax at the same time then tough luck my friend.

For example if you know you put the dvd cables into AV1, then using the tv remote you have to hit the input button to change it over to AV1.

qGfAlDd2aa	At present, the 2006 law is still in effect so the deadline is no later than 11:59 pm on February 17, 2009.    Congress is attempting to change the law to move the deadline to June 12, HOWEVER, that is only a bill at present, not a law.  In order to make a law in the US, the Senate and the House must approve the bill and the President has to sign it.  The House passed the bill, the Senate voted it down and it has not been given to the President.  I understand the Senate may hold another vote next week.    Even if the deadline is moved, there is nothing in the law to prevent a station or market from transitioning before the deadline, no matter what date is set.|`|4a189cf0bb5e0c77392a26e3764e81f4aa	It has been pushed back until June '09.

r9bOnqnfaa	Restart your iPod by holding down the sleep top button and home button until the screen goes blank followed by the apple logo appearing.  Then try starting your apps, if that doesn't work restore your iPod.  To do this click on your iPod under the devices tab in the sidebar in iTunes.  Then click restore under the summary tab.    The gray dot is a light sensor, it's always been there it's just hard to see somethings.  Don't worry about it.    If you've entered your credit card it should be automatic, best to contact apple about credit card and billing issues.    Hope I was of help, http://iphoneappreviewer.com

AA11068631	To resolve this issue you need to put a memory card in the phone and ensure that the transfer settings are set to memory card.  You need a micro SD card that is no larger than 2gb, as the phone won't support anything larger.   You also need to alter the settings in the handset and the software suite to be on file transfer - memory card, not file transfer - phone.|`|y6eqbv0Raa	um try takeing it back from were you got it from i had the same problem i took it back to t-mobile  and that got if fixed for me or if thay dont try taking it to a shop that fixes phone i think it will only cost about 25 pound min to fix|`|VNm1GIHLaa	Have you run the CD yet ?

v6ODmdftaa	Yes, in order to protect who actually gets the ipod, when someone does contact you ask them what the name is on the back. What color the ipod is. And than ask finally what are somea artists or playlists.     This way if someone just hears about it and decides to try his luck you'll outsmart him. If no one claims it within 3 weeks (at the VERY most) im sure you deserve to keep it. You did a good thing in bringing it back :]|`|Kwywmcs8aa	Well it could be anyones.  If the store doesn't contact you its fair game.|`|3K1QW7Oeaa	You can put a sign next to the place where you found it or post it on craigslist and put:    FOUND IPOD!    IDENTIFY THE COLOR, SOME SONGS, AND MODEL (optional) AND I'LL GIVE YOU THE ADDRESS TO WHERE YOU CAN PICK IT UP!    THE PHONE NUMBER TO CALL IS (XXX) XXX-XXXX|`|6J2NqXX0aa	just wait at least a week, and if no one claims its their iPod, guess you could probably keep it.|`|C7CaNLGlaa	The store might be able to track the owner down. The iPod has a serial number, they can use as a clue.|`|DY8YYluqaa	It will be pretty much impossible to track it back to its owner now.  Unless they come back to the shop purposely to find it... which they may not do because likely hood is someone has it.. and you do lol.    Keep it with you... if the store does not give you a reply within about 2 weeks with the owner contacting them... well.. its yours.|`|aOjMf5SPaa	google their name - see if an email address comes up or number. Apart from that - have you tried their name on facebook? you can send a msg when you click their name - get them to verify the ipod by the songs.    By the way - you are fantastic. You make the world a better place and give more hope to the people around you. Thank you for being a great person and trying to find the owner of the Ipod.|`|UH67GysTaa	no wait for the store to contact you back. beccause if you put it back, someone will keep it for themselves.|`|G5Ut9prSaa	You did the right thing. But no, there's nothing else you can do with only a first name. Hopefully someone will remember where they lost it!|`|Tv8cuXmtaa	If someone lost an ipod they will be looking for it so they will eventually turn up if you left your name|`|8HnLYjK4aa	"found" it in a jacket???    did the jacket attack you and thrust its pocket over your hand?|`|AA11773731	Give it to the police, tell the store if someone comes looking that it's been given to the police.|`|uC9iiQqVaa	when you register with itunes you have to give the  serial number on the ipod.

In this situation, there isn't a lot you can do now except hope that the person it belongs to contacts the store. The only other thing I can think of is if you have an ipod USB lead, connect it up to your computer and go onto itunes to see if there is a username assigned to the ipod that you could use to track down the owner. (You should see it on the left-hand toolbar in itunes.)    I hope that helps :)|`|0617bd18da4460c581ccb943da527d5faa	If the name is inscribed on the ipod, you could contact the Apple store and see if they can help you locate the right full owner.    My daughter lost hers, I wish that someone as honest as you would have found it.     I had inscribed "Live, Laugh, Love" and on the second line ALA which are her initials.

However, if not all the songs you have are in your library, and they're only on your actual Ipod, you'll have to get a program to copy the songs off your old ipod onto your computer, which you can then transfer onto your ipod touch. Just put in 'ipod to computer' into google, and choose a good looking, free option. If you have quite an old Ipod, you can do it manually- but I'm not sure how to do this. Just search around on google and you'll find a lot of information and different programs which will help you!|`|bC5OAfs5aa	If your songs are not on your iTunes library, you can use an iPod-to-iTunes transfer program to help you retrieve all songs from your old iPod back to your iTunes, like this one called iPod 2 iTunes <a href="http://www.gutensoft.com/Utilities/iPod-2-iTunes.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.gutensoft.com/Utilities/iPod-...</a><br>  It was specially designed to help transfer all music/playlists/videos from iPod back to iTunes in a direct way.

If there are tunes on your old ipod that u dont currently have on ur computer, theres nothing to do about them. You cant transfer songs from ur old ipod to ur library. In this case youd have 2 download them again.<br>  <br>  to clear the songs from your old ipod you could either plug it in and delete them all from itunes, or you could restore it back to factory settings. (which will wipe out anything on it) U can see how to restore on the apple site.|`|AA10265866	I just got a touch to replace an old ipod. I simply plugged it in, and I think I followed some instructions that automatically popped up. It was way easy. As far as songs from your old ipod to the new one, only if they are in your itunes library. There is software somewhere out there to pull songs from the ipod, but I don't know where to find it.

AA11068631	Bluetooth on the IPhone doesn't work like that.  You can't use it to transfer files such as music, pics, etc as Apple have deliberately not enabled that function.  You can only use the bluetooth feature for making/answering calls, and listening to music via a bluetooth headset.  Similarly, you can't use your own music as a ringtone or text tone.  You can only use the built in ones, or ones you buy from Itunes.

w4I9oj2Maa	Hmm, the signal is weak enough to NOT LOCK IN...    I'm sure you've tried pointing the antenna at the TV station...    So my next move would be to go to RADIO SHACK and buy a $30 RF amplifier with the highest DB rating you can find there...    I have seen adjustable 25 db amps from them, use them all the time.  Of course a 10db amp isn't as powerful as the 25 db amp is, so make sure you get the highest you can...    Other than that, you would have to put an outdoor antenna up to get it...An 8-bay bowtie antenna with that amp you bought at Radio Shack would be powerful enough to pull it in...    Unless of course you live in Seattle WA....
s7Muujxzaa	Put your address in here and lets figure out how far you are away from the broadcast tower.    http://www.antennaweb.org/aw/welcome.asp...    Digital TV is different from analog in that if the signal is marginal, you will see nothing on the screen whereas with analog, you probably would have seen a snowy picture.    My guess would be that your antenna system is not adequate in some way, resulting in a marginal signal that you are unable to see. If you are using rabbit ears, you probably need an outside antenna... if you have an outside antenna, you either need one with higher gain to receive a stronger signal or you could try putting an amplifier onto your antenna.    It is also possible this particular station is not broadcasting yet at full power on their digital transmitter.|`|b903943506a30e33141e4e9a48318686aa	Because channel 12 sucks!  I can get every other station nearly perfect all the time, but they're always choppy.  I had to stop recording 12-1 on my DVR because I kept getting a message saying "part of the recorded program has been lost" because of their signal...  So I'm just waiting to renew my Dish Network subscription to get HD locals.|`|AA11215737	HDTV is broadcast digitally and therfore cannot be recived via antenna without a converter box.  You need to go and get a converter box to get the channals.  If you want HDTV you need to talk to verizon, comcast, DISH, direct TV, or someone.
PlRxND5Naa	Obviously the Nikon! my friend has it, it's just AMAZING!|`|j5Apt8hWaa	Go into a store and try them both out.  Unfortunately you will not be able to test them both and take your memory card home with you to view the results on your large computer screen.    The Nikon uses the nearly standard of the industry SD/SDHC memory cards .. Sony uses the proprietary Memory Stick.    You will have to handle each of them and see which you like the best.  They are both capable P&S cameras.
AQ4b4Iilaa	Look at the Sony A200 and look at all those cheap but quality Minolta lenses on eBay that fit it!|`|PlRxND5Naa	D40x...it's everything is better..|`|AqKALUItaa	In addition to the lower cost, I prefer my D40 for :  1) smaller image files  2) higher flash sync speed      For more info and a more complete comparison, see:  http://www.kenrockwell.com/tech/recommen...  and  http://www.kenrockwell.com/nikon/d40.htm    Good luck and good shooting.
O8qdCBzLaa	A couple of reasons.     First, if you're watching channel 6 in analog, the audio carrier is very close in frequency to the bottom of the FM radio spectrum (about 88 MHz). So, the TV may be picking up a station near that frequency.    Another problem occurs if your cable TV system and/or home electrical system is not grounded properly. This causes the chassis of the TV itself to act like an antenna and tuner. This picks up the audio from the FM radio station and plays it weakly through your system.
IOGSCjVxaa	just think about all the songs and movies and videos you can put on your ipod classic|`|DY8YYluqaa	I love my ipod classic... yes the touch has all these special features... but the memory & price let it down a lot. Plus the iPod touch is all about look and its just another fashion item|`|4yzyPSJPaa	You can get the touch for free if you have friends willing to help with referrals, it's easy and cheap and it's were I got mine.  http://ipods.freepay.com/?r=46332798|`|MQngKAJCaa	Actually, if you don't want to surf the web or play games, the classic is superior. It has far larger memory than the ipod touch, and is therefore better for media storage and playback. I'd rather have all my movies and music on my device rather than my music, a few games and a movie or two.  What I find is really funny is that Apple went from 160gb to 120gb being their biggest size, while the guys over at Archos went from 160gb to 250gb.

eac8411737600cb69167ca52e369872faa	I have the phone and I really like it.  It does everything I want except speed dial.  The camera is pretty good at 3 MP, but a little slow.  I was hesitant at first about buying it, but now that I have it I don't regret it all all.  One of my favorite features is that when I set an alarm to wake me up or something, if I turn the phone off for some reason and forget to turn it back on, the alarm will turn the phone on at the alarm time, sound the alarm then when I press the button to shut the alarm off, it will turn the phone back off also.  I have all my contacts with their own images, ring tones and message tones.  So far everyone I have shown the phone to wants one.

1xr6T6h0aa	Ebay is NOT an automated warehouse, but you purchased from an actual seller.      On the item you won did you click contact the seller?  If so, your seller received your email and will make the change.    Fortunately for you, you can basically put any city on the mailing package as long as the zip code is correct.  Shipping companies generally go by the zip code and street address only.

AMrX5s1jaa	when you plug in your ipod a picture of your type of ipod and and your details about your ipod should come up on to your itunes screen.  on that screen look for tabs at the top where it says music videos games podcasts and ect. you have to click podcasts and make sure the box that says sync all podcasts is checked    by the way update this question if it doesnt work, ill check on it|`|kJFXxMeRaa	when you have your sync menu up click podcasts and then click sync all then click apply and it will sync them on there|`|ZZBGQ3GLaa	I don't know! why didn't that work?      Answer my question|`|0Frz9b1Caa	You have to go to your ipod menu (on itunes) and go to the section labeled "podcasts". There you will click sync all podcasts or choose certain ones. Once you've done that hit sync. good luck.|`|odQewFgvaa	Do you have enough space?
J1R7jRn0aa	i got the 32 gb 1 its huge fits about 300 songs + my like 40 vids. The 32 is only around 50 more than the 16gb, and so i thought if your going to spend that much money, y not spend that extra 50 in order to use the ipod more and have more choice.|`|KrQ4j0VXaa	the 16 gb is probably enough for you actually the best would be to get a sansa mp3 player with a memory card slot. it is really easy to put songs and junk on as well. and it works like an ipod with those you are just paying for the name. or get the 16 gb and get a mem card for it if you need more room.|`|EWDSI8P2aa	Well, to be honest i don't really know how manysongs/videos extra you plan to put on your ipod but..    Me personally, i have very few songs & videos and i barley use a few Gbs, so i no hesitation in buying the 8gb model as i knew that was more than enough space for me.     I'd just say the same to you, if your total libary is like well 14gb or so, maybe it would be worth getting the 32gb, but if you only have even like 6gb or so, the 16gb obviouslysounds more better choice.     Sure, 16->32gb isn't a great deal extra for double space but if you are quite simply will never get near 16gb then it would not be worth getting the 32 - even if it is just a bit more.     I don't know how much you plan to put on your ipid but i'm sure you have a rough idea andhow quickly you add to your libary, so just make th sensible choice, and don't just get the bigger one for the sake of it :p just if you genuienly will use it :)|`|yyDvNEJ8aa	32GB.

Call of Duty is quite Popular.|`|MLSLuRBJaa	I agree the Resident Evil Games are a lot of fun but RE4 is rated M and RE Umbrella Chronicles is rated T.  I would highly recommend Lego Batman.

7TQ5qGWcaa	When professional photographers take pictures of fireworks, a night sky, or a local football game they have made numerous adjustments to assure a quality image despite the special lighting conditions. A faster shutter speed to capture action, a wider aperture to allow more light in from a darkened scene, and so forth are necessary in many circumstances. Even that photo taken in the living room on Christmas morning has much different lighting than the shot taken of the kids running out through the snow covered landscape later that same day. Clearly, changes in the settings on the digital camera are what can allow such diverse shots to produce acceptable images.    It is few amateurs who wish to take the time to select all of the appropriate settings on a camera for each shot, and few as well who choose to purchase a camera with many manual controls. Luckily however, many digital camera models have scene modes that are readily available at the push of a button. These pre-programmed settings allow beginners to successfully adjust to the variety of conditions in which we wish to shoot. Once a camera is selected with these scene modes, it is merely a matter of determining which of them is appropriate for a given shot.    Like any device, there are unique settings on the various camera models and different names applied by different manufacturers, however, there are some settings that are very common and understanding them will get a novice on the track to better photos in short order.     Portrait Scene Mode    This mode is used, as one would expect, when shooting a "portrait" of a person or pet. With this mode, the camera uses a large aperture, and perhaps a faster shutter speed to compensate for the large aperture. This creates a sharper focus on a nearby subject and makes the background less distinct.    Landscape Scene Mode    In contrast to the portrait setting, the landscape setting on a digital camera makes use of a small aperture and perhaps a slower shutter speed in an effort to bring as much of a scene into sharp focus as possible.    Nighttime Scene Mode    This mode uses flash and a slow shutter speed in an effort bring in as much light as is available in a dark scene. Users still need to focus on maintaining a steady shot to assure good focus and a tripod or other steady surface is generally required for the best image.    Sports or Action Scene Mode    The fast shutter speed and wider aperture used when a digital camera is set on an "action" scene mode allows a user to capture rapid motion and minimizes blurring due to the movement.    Beach and Snow Scene Modes    In this mode, the digital camera will adjust white balance and contrast to keep colors more realistic and the photo from being too washed out or indistinct.    Macro Mode    This setting allows users to photograph items at close range using a smaller aperture. This setting is appropriate when shooting a subject, often a flower, an insect, or a small object such as a coin that is within 3 feet or less of the lens; too close for the typical point and shoot digital camera to focus without special adjustments. The subject of the photo should be clear and all of the background surrounding it blurred. A tripod is recommended in these situations to help eliminate problems with camera shake and the resulting blurriness.    Using the appropriate scene mode when shooting pictures merely provides a digital camera the instructions it needs to adjust settings for the specific situation, allowing beginners to create better quality images with the push of a button.|`|j5Apt8hWaa	No matter what scene you choose, you will have to know when the camera is going to be shooting at a slow shutter speed and cannot therefore be hand held without some camera movement, which in turn causes blur.  Even if you have your camera attached firmly to a tripod and are shooting at a slow shutter speed, the subject may move during the exposure and cause blur.    While P&S cameras can to most of the thinking for you, in the end you have to know something about how to control your camera.

If you're hard up for cash, you can buy an Arcade for like $150 and then pick a harddrive up used or new for $20-100 bucks.|`|4BeSKxdIaa	There is no regular 360. There are just 3 kinds of 360's. Arcade is garbage. Its cheap and nobody likes it. Get the middle one which is pro. The best one is Elite which you might want but is a waist of money. Pro is better because you are able to put on a hard drive to store space on it instead of a memory card plus it comes with one. You also need a hard drive to play live so you couldn't do that if you got the arcade. It can also play regular Xbox games which an arcade can't I think. Then the Elite is black and comes with a much higher spaced hard drive and has a cable that makes HD better looking when you play.|`|p3KxlgYeaa	the xbox360 arcade has no harddrive so therefor there is almost no save space so you cant get live or save much|`|xQwlB4TEaa	The Xbox 360 comes in lots of different ranges (4 in fact) and they are all slightly different in memory, games, software etc;    Arcade: Pretty much a waste of money unless you dont want live. It comes with some arcade games from Xbox Live and has a memory card which is useless. Around 130    20GB: Not sure what it's real name is, but it has a 20GB hard drive, usually a bundle with a game, and it good for playing multiplayer on Xbox Live. Around 140*    The 60GB: This i think, is the best one to get. It has a 60GB hard drive which is perfect for downloading game demos, arcade games, movies and game videos directly from Xbox Live. Around 190 with 2 games included.    The Elite: Comes with HDMI Cable for superb graphics and has a whopping 120GB Hard Drive. I find this a bit useless as I doubt anyone has filled one of these up with anything, but is also pretty good if you like downloading alot of things without the need for deleting things. Around 250-270 with a game included.    The Xbox 360s with a hard drive all come with a headset, ethernet cable and an HDAV Cable, apart from the Elite which comes with an HDMI cable.

Start by calling them so they can at least open a report on it for someone to research.    I'm on Verizon and never receive "off" calls, but just received 2 directly after each other within the last 1/2 hour. Reverse lookup showed that one was from canada, the other from CA based phone numbers. I opened an incident report with Verizon, but hmm... spooks in the machine lol.

38619f0f81204837c01cf800f96fba31aa	for under 200 you have a lot of choice.  I don't think theres a huge difference between the GP systems.    for features to look for  1) make sure the mapset is as uptodate as possible  2) make sure it can make use of the UK postcode.. that means all 7 digits  3) make sure the maps cover the area/countires you need, thers no point paying for say European or US maps if 'all' you want is UK  4) look for a an FM transmitter.. that means the GPS will transmit over FM to your car radio without any other devices  5) look for a GPS which has a MP3 player, and if it does look to see if the GPS will accept additional memory cards so you can load your music onto the SD card and play it over the GPS  6) look for a GPS which has bluetooth which measn you can use the GPS as a handsfree kit  7) check the battery capacity, some GPS only wokr of 12v car power or have a limited battery life, some have a battery life in excess of 4..8 hours. the battery capacity means that you can remove the GPS romt he car and walk to the address if need be.. usefull for pedestrianised areas  8) see if it has traffic alerts built in... some garmin Nuvi' shave it it. its not as useful as you first think. its difficult to prove if its ever truly worked (as by definition if you follow the directions it will divert you away from jam and its difficult to prove its saved you time).  9) see if the GPS has text to speech capability.. that means the GPS can read out the instructions phonetically.. its no quite as good as a human voice but its pretty usefull when it says turn right onto whatdoyermacallit drive, rather than turn right    there are some other frills which I'd classify as "that'd be nice" is of you can change the voice for directions, I think some of the tom toms allow you to download personality vcies such as John Cleese, Tom Baker and others    as to specific brands, personally I'd go with Garmin, used them for years so to me the Garmin 760 is the top end GPS for you. I would have a serious look at the other GPS both from garmin and others|`|kJ4g1vujaa	I had a Tom tom for 149 and it was great, but then I bought an RAC sat nav for 80 and its nearly as good,|`|ZYwyOBLJaa	Tom Tom 1 XL|`|XvtZIQBHaa	tom tom xl, i paid 140.00 from halfords|`|uEjh3CAbaa	buy a map they are cheaper and will not take you on some wild goose chase to beat traffic plus your car will be more vunerable to break ins if they see a sucker mark on your windscreen!|`|N2hMFrlYaa	TomTom 530 go halfords  reserve on line for best price.

On the same thing there is a small plate you can slide and if you slid it in one direction a little part turns red, that means your mic is on mute, slide it in the other direction and the other side should show green, that means your mic is not on mute and whoever you are talking to can hear you.|`|45f16ecdf3512cfd43cf659533ee6503aa	These new mics SUCK.

j5Apt8hWaa	If you have the skills using a 35 mm camera, you will have no difficulty moving to a DSLR.  The only difference is you will not have to change film to use different ISO's or white balances.    Here is what Ken Rockwell says and he has most of the "beyond" entry level cameras..    http://www.kenrockwell.com/nikon/d40.htm    Ken has a lot to say about top mounted LCD's .. I use them when the camera is on a tripod (shooting products), but otherwise would not miss it.    As you develop your DSLR system, you will eventually be buying a new body (about three to five years) and by then you will probably be buying one of the sub-$1000 cameras that do have top mounted LCD's    From a totally economic viewpoint, spending the same money to buy a D40 with two lenses may be a better investment.  Your new DSLR system will be one lens larger.|`|Mbg5Cz2Yaa	Honestly, I would recommend Canon. Ive used a Nikon D60 and a Canon 40D. The 40D is in a higher price class, but even Canon's lower priced options like the XSi perform much better [in my opinion] compared to Nikons. Canon also offers a wider range of lenses for you to choose from. With DSLRs, Canon really is the better pick and its definetly worth the purchase.|`|TbTO5SXlaa	Hello Dan.     I'm a little confused by some of what you've said. First you tell us you "... have shaky hands..." which is why you're interested in lenses with VR. Then you tell us you've been "... using 35mm film for nature..." and I'm completely unaware of any 35mm camera or lens with VR or IS.    You didn't tell us what 35mm camera you've been using but if its a Nikon then stay with Nikon since your lenses are compatible. If its a Canon EOS with the EF mount then look at a Canon DSLR since, again, your lenses will be compatible. If its a Pentax then you might want to look at a Pentax DSLR since it uses the same lens mount as the K1000 introduced in 1975. If you've been using a Minolta Maxxum then a Sony DSLR will use those same lenses.    If none of the above applies to your situation or you're not invested in lenses for any of the cameras I mentioned, you might want to look at the Sony and Pentax DSLR cameras.    Both Sony and Pentax have their respective versions of Image Stabilization (IS) in the camera body. Any lens you use will enjoy the benefit of IS, not just a select few. Plus, unlike Canon and Nikon, with Sony or Pentax you never have to pay for IS again after you buy the camera body. For someone who admits to having "shaky hands", having a camera with IS built-in seems like an ideal way to go.    If you're sold on Nikon then buy the D60 with the VR lens.|`|bcb5bce7aeb5e5a747203a085360538baa	my opinion is to go with the nikon d60 since you are already accustomed to nikon.  the lens should be compatible.  and changing over to dslr is easier than you think. do to dpreview and check out their comparisons|`|QYB6oRacaa	Neither - GO CANON!
3e354ee85999a7bc21252e59e538dc35aa	**If you have an analog (VHS) camcorder  You need an analog converter, either internal card or external such as the dazzle. It's very easy to use and come with good software. You would hook your analog VHS camera or VCR to the analog converter, the dazzle and then hook the dazzle to your PC. The dazzle cost around 85.00 , but worth the money if you have a lot of VHS to tapes to convert.     **Please Note There is no 8mm or Hi 8 to VHS Adapter that currently exsists. This type of VHS Adapter only exsists with VHS-C tape|`|jLTDqVHsaa	You can either get an analog-digital converter and use software like Corel/Ulead VideoStudio, or....    Just get a standalone DVD recorder, hook the camera up to it, and record a DVD.|`|42tTsVuxaa	you need to get something to convert then Dazzle make a converter, you connect your HI8 camera into it and plug it into your PC and capture the image.     Dazzle are not the only ones just do a search for analog to digital converter     Good luck     RR|`|AeEuNkKZaa	While you can do this yourself I recommend using a professional tape conversion service to get the best quality.  StashSpace.com is a good one, and can transfer hi8 tapes to digital files for $7 / tape (or Free with their current promo and a premium account).  Check them out at http://www.stashspace.com.  You can use their online software to watch, edit, share or get the files back on a portable hard drive or DVD.    To do it yourself you need to get an analog to digital converter.  Dazzle sells one.  Then using your camera/hi 8 player you playback the video and it is outputted to the video capture hardware device which converts the signal to digital and is captured by the corresponding video capture application.  Good Luck!
3SHf5drpaa	wii is really over rated to me its simply just a fad and it gets boring quick. the graphics suck. the game play sucks. the games suck. its tiring playing it. online sucks. at first when i got it it was awsome but after a week it started to suck. it gets boring really easy. the wii is for really small kids or adults they advertise their "best" games as mario cart and stuff which sucks if you want a really game console get an xbox 360 or ps3 well actually xboxs ARE **** TOO!!!!! and ps3s are alright but their games suck.. so actually all the consoles these days suck their either just gay and fruity, unreliable, or limited the ps3 has great potential and so does the xbox 360 if they fix some things (i have to pay 100$ to fix that piece of ****) and im selling my wii on ebay for an itouch. i played the ps3 and its alright but its expensive and their arent that many games, but the games they have are really good well the good ones. xbox is alright if it works but its unreliable its like buying a bmw its a good car but it breaks down after u use it alot ALOT. yea wii's suck their gay and are for either 7-12 range or 20+ or just casual people who dont know games. its just a fad and you get what you pay for 250? thats gotta suck!!!|`|nF3AbLBWaa	Wii, is based mostly for younger kids, along with the DS.  But older people do enjoy the games also.  Its mostly the people who review them have played so many games that are action packed and rated mature, so its not fun for them to move your arms around, instead of actually pushing buttons and playing.|`|2fbde007751b53153f91de150f61ac5caa	Because many developers are riding the Wii's train of popularity, and rush-developing games to take advantage of the casual market and make a quick buck.      and the PS2 is still selling well, due to it's large and great library of games.  i myself just bought one a few months ago.|`|C7rV71Cjaa	You forgot that No More Heroes, Gutiar Hero World Tour, Call of Duty World at War, Mario Kart Wii, de Blob, Boom Blox,Wiiware, Virtual Console games and others got great reviews too. No Nintendo will not make a HD Wii because they already made billions from the Wii now. As for those other games it would suck if we got poor ports that are not fun. Nintendo needs to foucs on getting more exclusives and not ports of other games. And Sony will cancel the PS2 by late this year or next year.|`|AA11464128	Because Wii has a diverse audience and casual games are not being reviewed by casual gamers. The guys reviewing Wii games are traditional gamers so they would feel like compelled to give GOW2 a better review than Zuma but I bet that my mother will think that GOW2 is not as good as Zuma.    PD: I like GOW2 and I used it just as an example.|`|zJv3QrJ3aa	most of the time it's because of the graphics. Don't know why people make a big deal of the graphics. Like Nintendo once said, "Graphics don't make the game". Yet more people perfer wii over the other 2 because how fun it is. Sites that rate games don't know how to rate games the right way. it's what i think|`|dPmVLo44aa	because 3rd party devlopers dont care about the wii unlike sega ea actvision and high voltage which they are working hard on the conduit u should check it btw at ign type in the conduit and watch some videos no they wont make a 1080p wii mybe the next wii and sony already gave up on the ps2 its the 3rd party that makes games for the ps2 they are making a re for the wii but not re5 its like a prequal to re4 btw also check out madworld at ign and the conduit|`|pwg8L6F0aa	Too many baby games. People thought it could be a main console but that didnt happen, instead u got my pet hotel when they got RE5 mirrors edge, Halo (360), bioshock2 GTA!!!|`|xYS1Hehcaa	the only reason games on the wii have bad graphics is that they r not made for the wii so its already enough to make it with motion but its even harder to adapt it to the graphics so games like brawl metroid zelda have good graphics cause they r exclusively to nintendo some i think look better than 360 and ps3 in my opinion ive seen 360 games and it doesn't bother me the graphics dont look that amazing   Wii's games r gonna suck this year theres no doubt about that but thats because in 2010 or 11 theres gonna be a new zelda and a bunch of ground breaking games plus in a year or 2 theres gonna be an update that makes the wii graphics like 360 ps3 or better     i for one think soul calibur 4 sux on 360 ive bought it plus wii has a soul calibur and resident evil game 08 was the last years there were gonna make new ps2 games

3kyLH5Ikaa	720P would look ok.  IF your TV is compatible with 1080i do that instead
TbTO5SXlaa	You need to tell us the model of Canon camera you have. The Promaster FTD 4000 may or may not fire fron your camera's hot shoe. If it doesn't, then your camera must have a PC (Prontor-Compur) connection to plug in the flash sync cord.    If you're using a Canon DSLR then I suggest one of the Canon flash units like the Speedlite 430EX II which will be 100% compatible with your camera.

4NxXKJBjaa	If it is an SB-16B it will mount directly, if an SB-16A (which it probably is if you were using it directly on an F3) you will need an AS-6.    It is safe to use (no issues with trigger voltages).  You will be limited to manual "M" or non-TTL automatic "A" modes on a Nikon DSLR.|`|bcb5bce7aeb5e5a747203a085360538baa	i tried a little research as i am not very familiar with older nikons.

xG5ZlJDqaa	You did not specify which Canon rebel you want to compare with the D80. I would guess you're looking at the Canon XSi. The Canon XSi is a great camera, highly responsive, fast, with a fair amount of manual overrides. On the downside, build quality isn't as good as the D80, and you're likely to fiddle more trying to figure out how to operate the camera than actually take pictures. The D80 is also a great camera. High iso and resolution performance loses to the Canon, but keep in mind the D80 is a much older camera. It also lacks live-view and anti-dust systems (irrelevant to msot photographers). On the upside, the build quality is miles ahead, and the viewfinder itself is bigger, brighter with a more accurate coverage due to its pentaprism design (compared to the Canon's mirrors). But the advantages in itself, in my opinion, gives more confidence to a photographer, which may be a very good reason to choose the D80 over the rebel.    But as you may know already, these cameras are not exactly "comparable" The D80 was introduced 2 years ago and aimed at the intermediate market. It successor, the D90, continues to aim at the intermediate consumers. The XSi, on the other hand, aims at the amateur photographers. The Nikon D60 would be a more reasonable to compare with the Canon.     Here is a detailed side-by-side comparison of the D60 and the Canon, with detailed reviews for both.  http://www.dpreview.com/reviews/compare_...

It allows you to shoot in RAW but also has settings you will find on DSLR cameras.    You can shoot in Shutter Priority where it will allow you to adjust shutter speeds as needed.  It also has Aperture Priority which will allow you to control the aperture.  Finally, it has full manual which give you complete control.    Another feature I really like is that it has a hot-shoe mount so you can attach Canon flash guns to it (like the 430 EX).    It also gives you the full auto "point and shoot" options on top of the more advanced ones if you need them.
BhNP2P8Xaa	There is no comparison. The G1 (which I own) is a full Internet phone, with browser, wi-fi capability, full QWERTY keyboard, GPS, music player, 3G support, SMS and MMS capability, touch screen, Bluetooth, 3 MP camera, and a bunch or other features.    Next to the G1, the Sidekick is a toy.

00mvTi7raa	You can always reboot your ipod. You can do this in 2 ways. First, what you can do is connect it to a computer then trying the game again. Or, the real rebooting is this. You click on the turn off button for about 10 seconds. Then it will say power off. You click power off and the whole screen will go blank...dark. Then wait about 10 seconds again and press the main menu button. In about a minute after the little white apple comes on, try the game again.  It can also be because of wifi troubles. Hope I helped!|`|Ons8CCojaa	Yeah that happens to me too.

vp1JASiTaa	For playing games online, you need a gold subscription. To just download things off of the xbox live marketplace (among other things), then you can do that for free with the basic silver subscription. But your question had to do with playing games and that means you do need a gold subscription.|`|WARdhMNjaa	no you have to buy gold its about 50 euros for 1 year but if you buy it from ebay you can get it with only 30 euros for 1 year all you do is type xbox 360 gold membership and buy a card for 1 year this is a link to one of the best ebay sellers link: http://cgi.ebay.co.uk/XBOX-360-LIVE-13-M...    copy and paste to buy|`|S3dnorbbaa	You need to buy live, you cant just connect it. Don't we all wish you could though. Lol|`|AA11477931	yes you need gold membership to play online,  also for wireless internet on the xbox 360 you need a wireless adaptor.
00mvTi7raa	OH no! you are mistaken. You mean like the whole thing show up when you plug in your ipod and it shows you like the pictures? That's just because you have pictures, no any other reason.|`|rEROnebiaa	just go to ITunes and it will show up as a ipod|`|tuWFp1Ziaa	your not allowed  to take songs from ipod to computer  only pictures from ipod to computer  use idump if u want to put songs on ur ipod to ur computer

Ur6H8gwkaa	It's usually free.    You need to be in a wi-fi hotspot. There are free spots everywhere. Some are there because businesses put them there for customers like Subway sandwiches and Malls. Others wi-fi networks that are left open and people don't even know they are open.    You'll come across lots of locked (password protected) wi-fi.    There are pay sites like ATT and other cell carrier wi-fi networks.    Boingo is the largest pay network that will get you into ATT, McDonald's and Starbucks etc.    So no, it isn't always free, and it's not like internet access on a cell phone like the iPhone where you get service anywhere you can make a call from. But the good part is that you don't have a 70-100 dollar a month iPhone bill.|`|NLLRpiWIaa	Yes, it's free.  I have an 8gb ipod touch and the internet is free on it as with my friends.
hSHT4DyHaa	Of course. I use limewire to download all my music.  After you download the software for limewire, it will save in your shared files library tab( you'll see it in limewire).  Then, make a playlist and "save as" in your music folder on your hard drive.  After that's done, go to windows media player and your playlist shoud appear.  Your zune software will pick it up then.
4BeSKxdIaa	That's happened to me. You have to go to Red Octanes website and find the number to call them. I could give it to you if you want. You have to call them and give them your information and tell them what you need. Then they email you a sticker to put on a box to send in the broken one. It takes about 3 days to send it then the day they get it they sent you a new one. It takes another 3 days to get it. In all it takes about 1 1/2 to 2 weeks for the email and mailing to be done.    The number to call is 1-800-229-6306    Hope this helped!|`|wjkVCD3Kaa	I think its time for you to move on to some REAL DRUMS!!!    WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO

Now I think you can just drag it to your iTunes like that. :)

I would jailbreak the phone, and after you have jailbroken the phone you will have a app on you r home screen that is called CYDIA.    IN THIS CYDIA APP YOU WILL FIND A APP CALLED YELLOWSNOW, THAT WILL DO A SOFT UNLOCK SO THAT THE PHONE WILL BE UNLOCKED TO WORK ON YOUR NETWORK WITHOUT THAT SILLY TURBOSIM.|`|uEjh3CAbaa	change from vodafone try asda 8p calls 4p texts

ddd5e90dc2f2dc38c72f539c860caa68aa	I got my sister a Nikon cool picks 8 pixel for xmass, i have a kodak and really wish i had hers. Its very nice, doesn't blur to easily, good detail, could stand to zoom a bit more. I think I spent about $100. I know Canon makes a good deal one for about 115-150. Try and stick to Canon and Nikon since all parts or almost all are metal and not plastic. Kodak and many other, almost all, use all plastic parts. Which brake a lot faster.|`|0JV3tQm8aa	These cameras are really great    Canon SD1100 IS  Canon Powershot A590IS|`|HBNx77BBaa	There are too many opposing items in your list. Professional and affordable don't go together. Long life and professional don't really go together either. Professional cameras have a short but hard life. If you use one gently it should last, but if it breaks down or gets damaged a professional camera is seriously expensive to repair.    It's also not clear if you want a 35 mm film camera or a digital camera. Few professionals use film these days, at least not when they're shooting for clients. Those that do still use film often use large format cameras shooting one sheet at a time. Great cameras and stunning results in the hands of a skilled photographer. Not exactly point and shoot...    Also, old fashioned? That doesn't go with professional. A professional camera may not get to see its fourth birthday in the hands of its original owner. And you don't want to buy an ex-professional camera any more than you want to buy a used stunt plane.    Twisty thing and professional. Try asking for one with a twisty thing in a pro camera shop. They'll be kind if you look wealthy I suppose.    Digital cameras don't last a long time. Solid metal or flimsy plastic isn't really the issue. It's just that something will happen to a camera that complex and after three or four years the repair estimate typically matches the price of an equivalent replacement.    If you just want to take good pictures, get a Canon Powershot A590IS for about $100. If you want a camera that is good to look at and which may well last for years, get a used classic 35 mm film SLR. Nothing too fancy - a good Pentax K1000 would be a sound choice but there are loads and half the fun will be reading about them on classic camera sites and in books.    You could take most of your pictures with the Powershot and just get a few rolls of 35 mm film to start learning the craft of photography on an old SLR. If it all fires your imagination, in a couple of years you'll know exactly what you're after and will be able to spot a bargain at fifty paces.|`|TVm0xcuIaa	nikon coolpix  theres one annd its around 130 dollars|`|49m7Rl7Jaa	then all you need to do... is buy the most expensive one cheap skate|`|3j0reWJXaa	Maybe you should research more about cameras, so you can figure out what those "twisty things" are.|`|liMNmri4aa	I have the Digital Canon Rebel XTi which has gone down considerably in price. You can probably find it now for upwards of 400 dollars. It's an SLR though and I think thats what you are wanting, but it takes a lot to learn since there are so many manual settings on it, you need to learn ISO speeds n what not.     If all that manual stuff might be too hard on you, there are other great cameras with bigger mpx's on them that do a great job and is easier to understand. I started photography on a 7 mpx camera that was not and SLR!

I saw Lone Wolf McQuade, the movie Walker Texas Ranger was based on. Great bad movie.    There's some total crap too, including just about every episode of family guy ever made, as if regular tv weren't already poisoned by that cheesy cartoon already.

KNYF1hnhaa	I would suggest calling AppleCare and letting them know whats going on.  You have 90 days of complimentary phone support through them and a 1 year warranty which would cover this issue as long as there is no evident physical damage on the outside or inside of the iPhone.  The number to call is 1-800-MYIPHONE|`|xDBZVswtaa	i would call the store where u bought it at they will give u a number to call.since u just bought the phone it is still under warranty they will either fix it or replace it..good luck..

uC7IKCQ6aa	it might be your ANA chip that's not being connected properly (hairline cracks in the solder) or your GPU    you could call MS and say you got the rrod and they'll fix it for free.   a little lie but it's their fault..     if you don't wanna open it up or send it in you could send it to me     I charge $40 for repairs plus shipping. if  can't fix it I don't charge anything. just shipping    good luck!|`|akjk0KDlaa	call microsoft up and listent o what they say. i had freezing too. was told to send it in as it was the symptom of rrod and it was sure to follow up soon.    so call em up
f4NqQoYgaa	I absolutely love my iPod Touch. No, the Wi-Fi does not cost extra. Many probably use the Wi-Fi on their iPod on their own home network, but if you use your iPod at a public library or other Wi-Fi hotspot, the answer is NO, the Wi-Fi feature on your iPod does not cost extra. The only Wi-Fi hotspot I've seen that charged for the use of their Wi-Fi was McDonalds. Every place you may go to is different, just ask first if you are unsure :)|`|dPGbFd1Faa	I have the ipod touch second generation, I use it all the time to listen to my favorite songs.|`|8sKeQvFAaa	My friend has an 8G one.

ESGIlaRIaa	You've probably not done the final step - run the Xbox with the fan sitting on top of the heat sink for about 5 mins until it overheats again and then let cool for 20 mins - reassemble. This 're-flows' the solder and allows for correct contact again    Make sure you get a good guide before you do this|`|WARdhMNjaa	its the red ring of death you have if i understood correctly here is a vid on how you could fix it link : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avWs4-wD1... i never tried it though glad i helped|`|uC7IKCQ6aa	ahem.. it's NOT the red ring.. it's E74 nub.. ^    but anyways you might have one of those rare cases that can't be fixed    try the x-clamp fix (make sure you use the proper washers or you will kill your xbox if it's not already dead)    try the pennies on the ANA chip and use pennies on the ram chips    this has fixed lots of my xboxe's     good luck

oM6cG1kcaa	Hey, good choice for your boyfriend, he's a lucky guy.  A good beginners guitar is anything by Squier, because they're produced under the Fender name. I played in a band for a while, and wayyyy way back I started on a squier guitar.  Here's one I found for 100 bucks, probably the best price you'll find.   It's a little more expensive than those starter guitars they sell at Walmart, but the quality is much higher so it's a good place to start.  Also, you don't have to buy this online and pay shipping, you can probably find it in a local sam ash or something!|`|glHbgpAAaa	you can go to sam ash or guitar center and get him a megaphone acoustic pack for 200 dollars and hey work great|`|0f1Rc73Aaa	Fender or Gibson are good brands for electric and acoustic guitars

RpCwfcRzaa	It depends on what game you want to play. Some of the original Xbox games that are playable on the 360 are Live capable or Live aware. First, you need to check to see if the game is playable on the 360. Go here http://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/backward... to see which ones are. Then you need to know if it is Live capable or Live aware. I know for a fact that Halo 2 is Live capable and Fable is Live aware where you can see your friends list through the game. For all Xbox games that are playable on the 360, the guide button cannot be accessed and neither can the friends list/ message system unless the game is Live aware.|`|45f16ecdf3512cfd43cf659533ee6503aa	If the game is backwards compatible you can go back and play it online with anyone else who is playing it, but you cannot use the guide button, or any of the 360 features (like chat)  But your friends will see you online playing Conker, but if they send you messages you wont be able to read them till you get back to the dash.  Also, if you send them messages they will see "this message is only readable from Conker"|`|4BeSKxdIaa	Call them and ask or just try...
nv8fxbbkaa	Well the Motorola W376g (tracfone) is $30 and it's like the KRAZR and it takes pictures and i'm pretty sure you can surf the web on it.     The Motorola W175g (tracfone) is $10 but it doesn't flip or slide    The Motorola V170 (tracfone) is $20 and it flips (i had this phone a couple years ago but i jumped in the pool with it in my pocket lol)    The Motorola C261(tracfone) is $20 and it takes pictures but it doesn't flip or anything     If you wanna see all the tracfone's go here:  http://www.tracfone.com/phones.jsp?task=...    There's the TNT (virgin mobile) $20 it flips open and can surf the web       (most phones at virgin mobile are over $20 and some over $50)    Theres the flare (virgin mobile) which is $30 it has games, ringback tones, web browser, and games oh and there's a facebook app you can put on it.     the marbl (virgin mobile) $10 which flips open but its made out of really cheap material my cousin has it but you can still surf the web and have real music ringtones    The aloha and the oystr are both $10 for virgin mobile, they both flip open and have web browsers, but the aloha looks better than the oystr.     all virgin mobile phones can be found here;   http://www.virginmobileusa.com/phones/ca...    NET10 is just an expensive version of tracfone.    hope this helps. (;|`|YLDR9fKpaa	You can look on www.ebay.com thry usually have some that are cheap.
0806e6e7cf26dee397f58421b5e679beaa	This HD one is made of harder glass, click this link for more info and all features:  http://www.hoyafilter.com/products/hoya/...    The Pro 1 is one of the best you can get, I used to have the HMC because it had a UV (0) rating, both are excellent but expensive filters, I've never seen the HD for sale and is probably much more expensive.    You can't really tell the difference in most pictures, I'm using the cheapest ones (green label) and the only thing that I've noticed is increased lens flare when compared with the HMC, the only reason why I use is to protect the lens, I'd suggest not to spend to much money on it.
iT4gn3z8aa	Without a receiver, your quarterback would just be throwing the ball to the ground. A team couldn't score and it'd be 0-0. We'd have no super bowl, and football wouldn't be fun to watch.    OH! THAT kind of receiver. You need one because without one, the signal coming to your sat. dish wouldn't know where to go. It translates the signal to a format that you can watch on your TV.    DVR- You can record your favorite shows, and set it to record a show every time it comes on automatically. Very handy.    HD- High definition. Makes your favorite shows look as good as watching a DVD (mostly)    Need one for every TV? Yes. However, most companies will give you 2 or more as part of  your package.    (Side note. I wouldn't go with dish or any other Satellite company. I'd go cable. I've had both and cable kicks the shiit out of dish. Plus, right now Fox and other big name channels aren't available on dish, Which means no American Idol... No Family Guy...)      Edit: Paul from San Diego> I said the EXACT same thing, why bother posting?|`|O8qdCBzLaa	A receiver decodes the digital satellite signals coming in on your satellite cable and allows you to select which channel you want to watch. It then has an output on channel 3 to plug into the antenna input on your TV. Or, you can use audio and video cables to get the picture and sound from the receiver to the TV.    Yes, you need one for each TV.    DVR is a digital video recorder, like a TiVo, that's built into the receiver. It allows you to rewind, fast forward, and pause live TV. And, you can use the on-screen channel guide to select the shows you want to record in the future.    HD is high definition, which allows you to watch the HD channels in high definition on your HDTV.
J8dDdWzHaa	If you want to receive fax while traveling then I suggest get an online fax service like Onesuite Fax Plus. You can send and receive online so it doesn't matter where you are, you're just a click away from your faxes. It will only cost you 2.5 cents sending out (per fax page)    For cheap way of communication, go with voip service.|`|dRUgXlOLaa	i would suggest a video phone.  You will not only be able to communicate but see each other while you do so.  As long as you have an internet connection you will get service.   i have seen them for 199.95.  There is a monthly service charge of 24.95 a month but the service is unlimited long distance calling to the US, Canada, and Puerto Rico.  There is a special on the phones now for buy one get one free.  i have attached a link for the video phones and a separate one for the cell phones.  They also have special features that will allow you to get the cell phones for little of nothing or free.|`|MeeJWmGtaa	An unlocked quadband GSM phone: that way you can use the same phone pretty much all over the world. 850/1900 Mhz GSM for the US, 900/1800 for most of the rest of the world.    Dunno about fax. Haven't sent a fax since the first Bush administration ;)|`|WyWtnigoaa	I believe this should be your best bet & this is what people are doing to avoid outrageous International Roaming charges-    You can have a World SIM Card OR Europe SIM card OR you can even get the local SIM cards for the different Countries you are traveling too (but you might not want to do that as you would have to change you SIM every time you cross borders), So World or Europe SIM should be better for you, it works in 200 Countries in World & 35 EU Countries respectively at low & flat call rates everywhere.     You can buy them online from RebelFone & they will deliever the SIM before you leave, so the best part is you will know your local phone number before hand. This SIM can be used with any unlocked GSM cell phone if you already have one, so you can avoid hardware cost too OR you get one of their SIM & Cell Bundle, which includes cell phone.     This service is post-paid so that means you need not worry about re-loading credit while on move, they will bill you for your usage every month & best part is you pay in local USD.     I hope you find this useful, I recommend it, check the link below:
OcbtPCtvaa	If it is a software issue, try connecting it to your PC, launch iTunes, and click restore.  This should fix it up.  Then you can just Jailbreak it again if you want to.|`|W9v4mfiHaa	First off the warranty is not through AT&T its from Apple (the manufacturer).    If you jailbrake it, you void the warranty and have an expensive paper weight. You could try restoring it and see if it will reset everything to the manufacture specs. Then try to jailbrake it again
S45PODlOaa	haha i just asked this question yesterday and got no answers =(. ill try to be of some help to you.     Propel: looks nice, but if you are looking for style, will probably be considered old by the end of this year...not saying thats important. Also have read that keyboard is small. Features are average.     Slate: looks nice, but feels a bit cheap. nice and thin though! keyboard is also small. lacking in number of features. no memory card slot! =(!    Matrix: Friend has this phone. Fun to text with and keyboard is very spacious. Got bored with playing around with it after about 10 minutes though. camera isnt great. thick =(. no way to change shortcut buttons. and yes you are correct about slider problems, i have heard that too.    Quickfire: After a few weeks of research i think i am leaning towards this phone out of the 4. Have heard some negative things about the touch screen, but i really needed a keyboard and this has the best keyboard out of the 4. Sadly highest priced too. I think this phone will also stay in "style" for a while because of the touch screen and the keyboard. I think it seems like the best of both worlds...a mix of the Iphone and Sidekick.     Hope I helped and if you see any of my questions regarding these, please help! lol

If you and a group of friends want to create a clan, the best way is to all give yourself that clan name through the creation tool. But there's no official join / start club associated with it inside the game.

AA11525080	When you drag song to WMP , you add them to the My Music folder.That is the same folder that itunes uses for it's songs. Make a new folder and add your music to it.Open WMP and click the F3 button on the keyboard then add this as a folder that WMP should monitor for your music and remove My Music folder for the same reason. The upside to this is you wont have to drag and drop anymore. WMP will monitor this folder and automatically add your music.

ZEwAalKPaa	You have got the dreaded E18 error that Canon, to their ever lasting shame, have known about but done nothing about and it is still coming up in even their latest models.  if your camera is still in warranty they will repair it foc.  If you are a week out of warranty they will not want to know.  There is a whole website full of people complaining about this fault.  Google  Canon E18 error  and read the posts, some people have managed to fix theirs by holding the camera with the lens downwards and gently wriggling it and pushing in at the same time. As far as i can gather there are a couple of little forks that fit over a couple of flange's and the flanges are not strong enough and flex and if you are unlucky a fork jumps off and the lens jams. Someone has actually given a step by step dismantling procedure to get to the part but it is long winded and complicated and i certainly would not attempt it myself and i can fix most things.    It would not be worth while paying to get it repaired as the bill would be high and the same thing could happen again.  In america there is a class action legal case against Canon about this fault which is leaving thousands of owners with unusable cameras'.|`|9944083b15b42aed4d89212f985007e7aa	huh|`|HDQlrhjXaa	funny lol

48b7amuZaa	Not sure about a 'downgrade' -- to me that means that you hope to retain your settings and sync'd music, but move to an older version of the firmware.  BUT, you can restore the old firmware, but you'd lose settings and you'd need to re-sync your music:    You should be able to download what you need here:  http://www.iclarified.com/entry/index.ph...    Make sure you get the firmware for your device.  Mine is a Touch 1st gen, so I'd get this one: iPod1,1_2.2_5G77_Restore.ipsw.  If you have a 2nd gen, then you need this one: iPod1,1_2.2_5G77a_Restore.ipsw.    Download that to a directory of your choice.  Then connect your touch and launch iTunes.  Go to the Device and look at the Summary page.  There should be a [Restore] button.  Hold [SHIFT] and click [Restore] -- this should open an explorer window and allow you to navigate to the location of the firmware you just downloaded.  Select the firmware and go.  OK, so it's been a while since I've done this to mine, so I can't give you exact step by step detail, but this should at least get you going.      UPDATE: Frozen iPod?  Hmmm.  Never had that happen to me.  It could have something to do with the computers of the Frozen iPod users.  I guess it's a your-mileage-may-vary kind of thing.  Good luck.

CZIQMIr0aa	Don't use limewire! Using limewire will cause you to download a ton of viruses onto your computer! Download utorrent [utorrent.com] and use demonoid.com or revtt.com [if you can get invitations - ask around on Yahoo answers] or if you can't get an invitation then use mininova.org! This is a much better system! However if you have no antivirus software on your computer then don't download at all - its just not worth the risk, honestly!|`|TnPiiwoAaa	Chances are you downloaded an executable instead of an MP3, limewire is crawling with malware. Do a virus scan and maybe use another P2P program.|`|kAVdBqs8aa	you should use the free VLC video player. Its a web pirate standard and can play anything you throw at it.    you should also get away from limewire and learn about torrents.|`|12d03e776b7ca3e38fd80f231dd1a289aa	you do know that limewire was created by the government and they do monitor all downloads.|`|H162bS7kaa	First let me say that Limewire unless used properly is an illegal download service.  Now that my legal liability is covered let me continue..  :)    I would not personally download anything that is not a mp3 or mpeg file when using any of these download programs.  Even then you should scan them.  Most of the quicktime downloads are nothing more than phishing or bot files.  As is the case with the powerpoint downloads.  You should not have to use powerpoint to listen to a song.      I know its a basic answer but thats really all you need to remember.|`|2qkSYsdSaa	lime-wire sucks caus of all the maillware u need to get utorrent it is great if downloads fast and has better quality songs. u just go to utorrent.com and click download and then click get utorrent 1.8.2 stable and then it will guide u through the rest. once u get utorrent browse the songs on mininova.org make sure that the songs say .mp3 for best quality. when u find a torrent u like click download torrent and it will open utorrent and a popup will open and have all the songs on there and u can select which songs u want. it should work fine with windows media player. hope this helps u out! :-)|`|AA12353423	Delete the song immediately.  Most likely it's some kind of malware or virus.  Many people are disguising viruses and bad files as mp3s now.  And because Limewire isn't exactly well monitored, it's not exactly the best program to be using for file sharing for the most part.
lGg8AU1Yaa	Yes you do because i wasnt online for about 3 months and 3 updates. so when i got back on and one update later got it all. i know because my cousins all have the ps3 and i followed there updates. those guys above are trying to make you feel sad.|`|sQdgzYKVaa	No that would suck if you did. You just need to get 1 update to get your PS3 up to date.

4Pk6VNftaa	I don't know if Blockbuster carries Wii Games.  I guess they do, but I've never had much luck finding anything worth renting from them.    You can also look online for game reviews.  I like Game Rankings (http://gamerankings.com) which allows you to quickly see the average rating of a game from a number of different sources, both print and website.  You can also access the actual reviews as well if you wanted more information.    Basically, anything with a 65 or lower is generally a game worth avoiding.  65-80 may be worth getting, but be sure to read some reviews first.  80 or higher is generally a pretty good game.|`|5Z4yxxXQaa	If you have any play n trades close to your house go there, blockbuster is overpriced.

Try to reset it by holding down the power button (in front) for 10 sec until it beeps and turn off. Then turn it back on and try again.    Remember, never use the back switch unless the light is RED.|`|6eiCySQfaa	Your blu-ray reader might have took a s***t on you try to play a blu-ray movie.

RpQfIQXmaa	There are many music download sites and software, but the best FREE, LEGAL, and SAFEST site/software I have used is Nexus Radio: http://www.nexusradio.com    It is 100% free and they have a bunch of music you can search and download. I have not found any other free or paid software that has as many features as Nexus Radio.    I have been using it for over a year without any problems.    PS: Never use limeWire, FrostWire, or BearShare...those networks are riddled with viruses and are heavily monitored for illegal file sharing!    -----by music king!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|ElvQTpUVaa	"no limewire stuff that causes viruses."  Stuff?    Much of the problem is that when you download music, you are installing a program on your machine and then downloading data from other people using the same network - that's two possible sources of malware infection (3 if you count the possibility that you'll download the program from a webpage hosting malicious code).    To get music, your choices are varied, and each comes with its share of risk and cost.    You can pay for the music  its legal (though that doesnt help if youre caught uploading the music to somebody else), and not all that expensive.  Problems include limited transferability of the music due to DRM.    You can download using torrents or over a peer-share network.  To do either, youll need to install some kind of client software (there are several networks, and may be numerous different client programs).  The risks:  the client may contain malware.  You can minimize the risk of malware by getting the program from the publisher, but not eliminate the possibility that the authorized program is also infected (or that youve unwiitingly mistaken a hackers page for the publishers).  You may also pick up some malicious code just by visiting the programs page (assuming it is the programs page).  Because these programs connect you to a network of other users, you will be expected to have some media to share beforehand.  Also, there is no way to guarantee the safety and quality of the downloaded media.    If you must go the peer-share route, I suggest foregoing Limewire (and its variants) and choosing WinMX or eMule.  Ive been using those programs for years and almost always get what I want.  Ive managed to avoid viruses (many LW users say otherwise) and when I finally tried LW, I discovered it was no better than my programs of choice.    You can also get music by logging onto internet radio stations.  These will stream music through your soundcard.  You can use any number of free programs to save the stream as an mp3 or a wav file.  Audacity will record streaming media, and it can edit the stream to make copies of that stream containing any music you want.|`|s7SveqWVaa	beemp3.com

S96qrpGDaa	Recharge it or put new batteries in it.|`|HSho71EPaa	Normally, low, discharged batteries are the problem...but then everything closes down and the lens re-tracks safely.  Depending on how much you paid for the camera and how old it is...be very careful about putting good money after bad! If  its out of warranty, then its over 12 months old...(unless you took out an extended one) and what ever you have done to it is going to cost...and cost.    I would suggest you take it to a quality camera shop and get a bit of (professional) advise....then go to another to see if it concurs. Depending on what both have said, you can then make the choice of repairing it or binning it.    Cameras are coming down in price and going up in quality so fast these days, it often costs more to repair than to change...    Good luck though...I have some cameras forty years old and no way would I part with them....but digital is so good now and so cheap, its hardly worth the  aggravation of sending it away and paying for a repair.    Get advice though.....it could after all be a simple malfunction!!!|`|a6kZ2q8Kaa	That happens to me and it works if I put in new or recharged batteries.  Are your batteries fine as you say?|`|JZy71j4Naa	its a problem with the lens barrel... and normally u cant fix it|`|jBdZvaf8aa	your probably pressing the off button.|`|tuDEQ8HXaa	its the motor u have tospend more money fixing the camera than its worth or just spend that same amount of money on a better camera than that one.
LrGZcI6yaa	Yes, it might work, it depends what type. It will still work perfect, unless its a fried drive. And if it is, your system will work fine still, just put the original one in. It will be fine unless the hard drive you have is like some modded thing you found on the ground, even then, it may be fine.     So you have a 99.9 % chance it's going to work in your system, and a 100.00% it wont brake your system.

s7SveqWVaa	Craigslist? Walmart?    All stores will have pretty much the same price on their ipod touches because they can't really change the price due to it being an Apple product.|`|ElvQTpUVaa	Apple store?|`|O282hR68aa	amazon.com usually has it around $220. The price changes every day though. the cheapest I've seen it for on amazon was $208. other stores are probably around the same price.
HBNx77BBaa	You probably know it's not looking too good without anyone spelling it out...    But first, don't force the lens at all. It may become unrepairable. If you have already, well, don't do it again.    This isn't a cheap camera so it's worth getting a repair quote from Kodak. That will allow you to work out what to do next.    Only you can judge how big a fraction of the purchase price you can tolerate as a repair price. For me if the repair exceeded half the cost of buying a new one, I would not go ahead.    You can get a better performing camera for about 20% less money if the body colour is not top of your priority list. Have a look at the Canon Powershot A590IS. If you got one of those, you might not look back.    There are two things you can do with the broken M863 if the repair quote is too high. Do not do the first until you are absolutely certain that you will not be going ahead with professional repair.    So, first, if you are not going to get it repaired, try the list of ideas on this link. Treat the camera gently and work though the list in order. The final item on the list is kill or cure...    http://camerarepair.blogspot.com/2007/12...    The second thing you can do, even if the attempted cure fails, is to list the camera on eBay with a full description of its faults. The only problem is that if you kill the screen while trying to fix the lens, I don't think anyone would be interested in bidding for it.    Best of luck.|`|tuDEQ8HXaa	its screwed u have to get a new one or spend more money fixing it.
zRcAz0oRaa	The touch is for music, games, and videos.  The iphone has the same features but can also call and text
j5Apt8hWaa	If your menu has an option (the Canon DSLR camera's do) where you can choose sequential numbering, set it in the On mode.  Your numbering will not return to IMG_0000 until you have shot 10,000 images    Continue putting new shoots in differently named folders so you can keep a handle on what is where.    File folders like Lake0109, Drags1208, TimsBday08 will help you manage your images in a good way
jLTDqVHsaa	Never mind drivers, that's not necessary.  What you DO need is a FireWire (DV) cable.  There is a port on your camera for it.  That's what'll let you get the video from your camera onto the computer.    Of course, you need a place on your computer to plug it in.  If your computer doesn't already have a 4-pin, 6-pin, or 9-pin FireWire port (look them up to see what they look like), then you'll need to get a FireWire card to install on your computer.  Make sure you pick the right kind, depending on what type of expansion slots your computer has.

The digital is temporarily on physical channel 3, although a digital receiver will call it 2.1.  When the analog shuts down, the digital will move over to channel 2 and, it appears, will have similar coverage to the existing analog.

N2rntAqvaa	Well, if you are willing to buy the PS3 that plays PS2 games, then I would suggest you get the 60GB.      First, let me just give you information before I give you my suggestions:  There are 6 different models for the PS3.    -20GB - discontinued (not in stores anymore) and plays PS2 games.  -40GB - same as the last one, but doesn't play PS2 games.  -60GB - same as first one, but more space.  -OLD 80GB - same as first one, but more space.    These are the models that are currently in stores:  -NEW 80GB - Doesn't play PS2 games  -160GB - Doesn't play PS2 games, but currently the model that has the most space    You should know that the ones that play PS2 games have 4 USB slots, and the ones that DON'T play PS2 games have 2 USB slots.    So, if you are willing to get a PS3 that plays the PS2 games, then you are only able to find it online, and it is probably gonna be used, even though sometimes people just buy it and sell it before they even opened it.      Now, you might think that there is something wrong in here, because the newer models are supposed to be better.  The reason Sony stopped the older models is because when they were backwards compatible, they were very expensive, and they already lost money, so they just took the emulator out and dropped the prices.    So, what I recommend the least, is the 40GB, because it has less space, and no backwards compatability.  I would recommend either the new 80GB, or the old 60GB, which you have to buy online.    I hope I helped you, and if you need any help just click on my profile, and feel free to email me, and I will answer you.|`|UQeK5FgZaa	Since you've never had a ps2 id get the 60GB.  The only difference is the 60GB uses more electricity.|`|JODuPNq9aa	60 all day long m8|`|HcZppReOaa	Only 3 models of the PS3 can play PS2 games and they have all been discontinued.

But I must say there are getting harder to find and are getting more costly. Also I have a 60 (because i wanted to play ps2 games after my ps2 took a dump on me) and i haven't touched any of my ps2 games in over a year... the new games blow the old ones out of the water, and after playing the new games the old ones are just plane "out of date"  It was like playing a NINTENDO NES game "the Original" compared to a N64... its just not the same anymore...  The only 3 games from a ps2 that even got put into the ps3 that ive had for 2 yrs now where Madden 07, GTA San Andras, And THUG2. This was before PS3 had put out many games.

cDYowiDNaa	I recommend getting rid of verizon! I canceled my verizon phone service a month ago because they were constantly messing up my phone bills. They were always trying to sneak in new charges.They were adding new charges every month and sometimes they would send me 3-4 bills. I had to call them every month, waste my lunch-break, just to get them fix their mistakes. They would always apologize, but the same thing happened every month. Finally, I decided to cancel them and get service else where. Well, I paid my final bill. Some how I managed to over pay it and they sent me a check for the over paid balance. The funny thing is that the very same day that I got a check in the mail, I got a letter from an attorney that was representing verizon, and it said that I owed verizon $21.00 I couldn't believe it. I got a check and a threat from verizon on the same day. I have had service with them for years, and I always paid my bills when due.  If anyone has verizon, you should watch your bills closely|`|aH3vvUfiaa	Samsung Omnia|`|26zfOKYNaa	I recommend the Dare.  Its a nice phone.
