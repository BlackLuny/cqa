20070105101506AAfpqsk	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	Why don't women realize that the double standard is justified.?	i believe that the double standard when it comes to the genders and sexual promiscuity is justified. Why are men called studs and women aren't?    If you want to understand the answer to this  perform the following experiment. Get an attractive women to go out and talk to 5 unmarried (and uninvolved) guys for 2 minutes and then have her make a blunt request for sex. Now send an attractive guy out and have him  talk to 5 unmarried women for two minutes and then make a blunt request for sex. We all know what will  happen in each case.  You see a man has to use skill and put in a lot of work that is why is considered a stud. All the women has to do is make herself available. Now if that ever changes then I will change my mind about all of this.

Although da answers i had were helpful i don't think people really got what i meant. I'll give more of a description. Me and him aren't frends but we aren't enemys. When I said i always see him looking at me. It's because he been placed in front of the board and when i look at the board he's staring directly at me no doubt about it. Either that or if i'm talking to my friend and hes near he always looks at me not both of us just me. If someone accuses him of being gay he makes a sarcastic comment then goes and try to kiss one of his friends. Although that might seem jokey he dives in on the oppurtunity and trys really hard to kiss. It is a possibility dat he was dared but he wouldn't do a dare like that. I know because i heard one of his friends say this dare before and he refused to do it. So y wud he hug me. I don't hope hes gay either because i'm not gay. Any ideas on how i can find out if he is gay without directly asking him. I am not gay i just want to know y he did this to me.

Recently I met a very gorgeous, funny, intelligent man online that is soon going to be moving to Virginia Beach from Bangkok. I really like him and I believe the feeling is mutual and we both have agreed to remain friends until we figure out exactly what we both want.    He is everything that I want in a man; he is a virgin, hard-working, intelligent, funny, etc. But the problem is that if we get into a relationship I wont be able to move to Virginia for 2-3 more years when I finish my bachelors program (which wont  be an issue because i want to get out of Kansas anyways).      In your opinion can long distance relationships last this long?? How much faith should I put in the situation, and what are some signs that the relationship will turn from being a serious friendship to a serious .... relationship.??

One of the group home guys just jumps in this man's car and demands: "take me to the train station." The man says, "I'm not going to the train station." The group home dude replies, "But I am! You have to take me." The man says, "I just brought breakfast for my family, so I'm going in to eat it." Group dude says, "Go ahead, I'll wait here." At this point, the man goes in his house and leaves the group home guy in his car. (I kept walking and don't know this ends.)      Anyway, what is the appropriate protocol for removing an individual with mental retardation who has invaded your home or car if they won't/can't understand that they need to go?

20070207110212AAd58rg	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Que contradictorio que es el catolicismo.?No?	Estuve leyendo una pregunta y la verdad, felicito al que la escribio.   Dijo que la Iglesia católica se va adaptando a las diferentes corrientes de los nuevos siglos, lo que la convierte en hipocrita y contradictoria. La Biblia dice que Dios siempre fue el mismo ayer, hoy y siempre, y tambien dice en una parte "No os amoldeis a este siglo......". Y ponen  excusas absurdas e infundamentadas diciendo que los errores se deben a que esta dirigida por seres humanos, etc. (Cosa que esta mál, pues la Iglesia es Cristo mismo en cada creyente, por lo que es perfecta), y sus imperfecciones nada tienen que ver con Dios y su plan.

He's kind, nice, supportive and very considerate. We started out as friends, but he seems to have developed some stronger feelings for me. I like him as a friend, but can't keep up with his pace of going on; I mean I don't love him, I think he's not my type, but I'm not sure, because i'm still a virgin and have never had sex before (i'm just 22). Although he has asked me several times about going back to friends, I was never sure to completely agree. So, I stuttered every time. We have been out some times, but that was all. No physical thing in between. He tried to show much affection, but i never responded. Some days ago, I told him i had no feelings for his affection and he said he couldn't do much about that. Now, I feel guilty, because I think i have lost a very good friend and he doesn't want to see me anymore. I'm also afraid that I won't be able to love him as much as he loves me now, because of the type and all that stuff.   What do you think I should do?

20070213231743AAqNeXM	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	MUSLIMS, WHAT DO YOU THlNK OF THIS INFORMATIVE WEBSITE ?	 http://www.bibleprobe.com/muhammad.htm       We apologize to anyone who may be offended by the history of the founder of Islam (Muhammad) below.  And we are aware of the sensitivities involved.  However, infinitely more damage has been done to Islam's "believers" by Islam's history of withholding the truth about its founder to them -- - and the circumstances surrounding its inception --  than any "damage" this true history below can cause.        As you will see below, Muhammad posed as an apostle of God.  Yet his life is filled with lustfulness (12 marriages and sex with a child, slaves and concubines), rapes, warfare, conquests, and unmerciful butcheries.  The infinitely good, just and all holy God simply cannot tolerate anything in the least unjust or sinful.  What Muhammad produced in the Qur'an is simply a book of gibberish consisting of later evil verses abrogating (superseding) earlier peaceful verses. These verses in Arabic poetically "tickle" the ears of Arab listeners.

I'm 22 years old & I've been with my girlfriend for about 5 months now. Here's the thing. I lost the superbowl bet between us and the consequence was that when we went out to celebrate, I had to wear one of her sexy lingerie outfits under my clothes, thong, garter, stockings & all. No one could see that I was wearing it, but she knew it was there & for some reason, this turned her on tremendously! When we got home, she asked me to leave it on when we made love and it was awesome for both of us. Now when we go out, about half the time we do this and our sex life is amazing! Now, I am totally straight, but I do get turned on by wearing these outfits, (she bought some just for me), when we go out & make love. Is this normal? Does any other women like seeing & being with thier man wearing lingerie???

I hate labels... but what you don't know is that you are labled. Your labeled as emo, punk, goth, prep, jocks, nerds, geeks, clubbers, skateres and posures/wannabes.    What I would like to know is that why do people have you classed as these groups or others? I always  think that its not always what you wear or how you talk or act, but how you deal with things. Am I wrong? My best friends and I are labled as punks, goths, skaters, and emos. But why do people have to lable us. I don't like lables by then  you have posures who think they can do whatever they want but they just become annoying. Whats up with that? And like I said .... why do people have to be labeled... its like War World 3.

I've been in a relationship for 10 months now with someone I love dearly. The first 6 months were extraordinary, but the remainder 5 have been truly challenging. I know in my heart that he loves me, on many occasions he had a chance to affirm it. Yet, I feel like we both made a mess of things and today we find ourselves in an unhappy and broken relationship, where everday there is an argument or misunderstanding over something. He blames himself for it and I do the same. We're also angry towards one another over the way we hurt each other.       I love him a lot and I would like our relationship to work out, but I don't know what to do anymore. I've took a break for one week to think, given him some space. I also try to communicate, but everytime we do it seems to escalate out of control.

You see ever since I got into  a serious relationship, all my friends have broken contact with me. I have tried to call and set up times to hang out and they either don't answer, or call me back, or have other plans. My boyfriend seems to think it's because they're jealous of us being happy. They're are all single and out doing the party thing. I mean if they choce to be single , do they have any reason to be jealous? I don't think so. So why are these people jealous and what can I possible do, that I haven't already done already, to rekindle a friendship. I'm to the point of letting them go and finding new friends.

20070517182101AAg3HXN	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Do you believe good and evil really exists in a world perspective?	Do you not believe the concept of good and evil varies among individuals as well as societies? Usually, good is something that you are attracted to and evil isthe opposite in that nature. Imperialism is a great example. Imperialism was obviously good for imperialists because it encouraged economic development, increased nationalism, and enabled them in acquiring new territories. It was obiously bad for the conquered because of the genocide and parasitic effect it had on their societies. Humans have the fundamental ideas of what good or evil is but there is nothing good or evil common to all. In that sense, what is good should be good to everyone as a whole(humankind) yet, the same thing one suposes is evil, is good to another. This indifference grants the same thing as both good and evil. In my opinion, religions are not exempt. Why do you believe your version or opinion of good and evil is correct?

20081001214953AAy9M60	Society & Culture;Other - Society & Culture	What would you do.......?	My mother went shopping at this clothes store for my cousins. Their clothes are relatively cheap about 5.99 or 9.99.  While she was shopping she saw this lady with 3 kids one a baby, take the baby out of its stroller and put clothes in it. The lady walked out and the security machine went off, and the lady at the counter did nothing. My mother said are you going to do something about that and the lady said "It happens all the time there's nothing I can do." My mother was going to call the cops but didn't. I told her to call the store and talk to the manager or talk to the corporate department. But she's hesitant, she feels sorry for the worker  because she said she looked scared and doesn't want them to lose their job. and the worker felt sorry for the customer who stole because she has 3 kids( I don't get that)      I was appalled when I heard this, that lady is teaching her kids to steal by involving them and the associate who works for the store did nothing even though the security alarm beeped. If she doesn't want to confront the thief she could call security or the cops or get the persons license plate number. Either way it's the owner who is losing out if this is happening.      What would you do in the situation?

Ora, olhem para a história: n?o fossem o desenvolvimento cultural seríamos diferentes dos nossos antepassados das cavernas? Ou, aos protestantes que fizeram tal pergunta, acham que vocês seriam diferentes da cristandade católica da idade média? O que nos diferencia dessas épocas é a evolu??o do conhecimento. E agora vocês colocam que isto é demoníaco.   Na boa, digam o que disser, mas n?o posso me posicionar contra a dignidade humana. E jamais poderia me colocar a favor de um deus que quer que nos humilhemos, quer que n?o acreditemos em nossas capacidades. Isto para mim é mediocridade e covardia.

Why do people still not believe in God and still not believe we are living in the end of times? Even though revelations tells of what will happen and those things are happening!? I mean some people who believe in God still don't believe Jesus is soon to return. It baffles me. I mean how long ago was it written? And its like a timeline for whats going on today. Its scary how Satan has deceived people so. He knows he will be in hell for eternity and he wants the same for all of us. And some people are too ignorant to even notice and take heed. The bible says hell enlarges herself daily... thats because so many people will be going there. But it doesn't say heaven enlarges itself does it? It also says in Hell they shall lift up their eyes. Meaning you rejected God on earth but once in Hell you will realize He's God. Don't let it be said too late people! Don't be caught with your work undone. This is just a dressing up room... earth is. Its not our home. I know one thing and that is that Satan knows God is real and knows he's running out of time. So he's busy trying to destroy people put as many as he can on the path to a burning Hell. Please people don't be deceived turn to God while you have the chance!!!!

The Munafiqeen (i.e. Sahaba) took very much out of Quran (took out the verses). (Ihtijaj-e-tibri, page #382).    When Imaam Mehdi comes he will bring with him the real and original Quran. (Ahsan-ul-maqaal, page #336, safdar Husain najfi).    The person who says that the present Quran is complete is a liar because the “complete Quran” was compiled by Hazrat Ali. (Fasl-ul-khitaab fee tahreef kitaab rab-ul- arbab, page #4, Noori Tibri).    Abu Bakr is kafir and the one who loves Abu Bakr is also kafir. (Haq-ul-yaqeen, page #690, Baqar majlisi).    Abu Bakr was kafir and Zandeeq. (Kashf-ul-asrar, page #69, khamini).    There is no difference in Abu Bakr and mirza Ghulam Ahmed Qadiyani. (Jagir fidk, page #690, Ghulam Husain najfi).    Neither we believe the Allah nor the Prophet of the God whose khalifah is Abu Bakr. (Anwar-ul-nomania, page #278).

20090202075148AAcVCtN	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	A Call to Unity for All Christians & Believers, Do You Agree?	Please tell me your thoughts on this. I have been thinking about this for a long time.      Don't you think it is wrong how many people believe in God, yet reject each other.      Christians have so many demoniations, and waste so much time fighting with each other and insulting other denominations and even other faiths.      At the end of the day, shouldn't we choose to join together based on what we believe in (God), rather than allow ourselves to be divided based on opinions of certain theological topics?      Which is more powerful? People who join together for a common purpose? Or those who divide themselves apart based in small differences?      By uniting, we could be much more powerful in our influence. This not only stops with christians, but also those of other faiths (Judaism, Muslim, etc.).      Shouldn't we all unite with our common beliefs, instead of segregating ourselves? We have a common enemy do we not? Is evil and sin not our enemy?      So what if one group thinks we should baptise with water? Or if the trinity exists? If Jesus was the Son of God or God? Isn't that their own opinions? Why should we judge them? Why not let God judge us?      It is like this: The military is divided into separate things (army, navy, etc.). Yet they fight with unity and common purpose against a common enemy.      Why can we believers not do the same thing? Who cares if we disagree on some things? Why not fight for the things we all agree on, and work together?

How would you feel if we regulated our population the way that the people did in the story "The Lottery" by Shirley Jackson?      This is how they did it:      Residents of a New England village gather for the annual lottery. Everyone is to draw a folded slip of paper.    After Mr. Summers shows up with the black box, he sets it down and prepares for the drawing. A housewife, Mrs. Tessie Hutchinson, arrives late just then, telling Mrs. Delacroix that she “Clean forgot what day it was” until she noticed that her children had left her house and remembered it was the day of the lottery.     Each of the townspeople draws a folded slip of paper but does not open it until everyone has drawn. When the big moment arrives, it is Tessie Hutchinson who has the paper with the black dot. Everyone then closes in on her, picks up rocks–the “proceeds” of the lottery–and stones her to death. (throws stones at her until she bleeds to death)       http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMOMcO0vl...

20090202195747AAmIAva	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Have we been working towards heaven since man ate from the tree of knowledge (adopted free will for aethiests)?	I have no knowledge of theology but feel that we could be around the corner from heaven on earth, nirvana, the apoclypse and subsequent rapture or what have ya. I don't feel Jesus will come riding across the skies on a golden chariot mind, rather a more subtle realisation or happening will occur which could cause humanity to say, use their collective knowledge, skill, wisdom and experience to bring an end to all unnecessary suffering in the world. Is that not Heaven?   What does the Bible/Koran etc. have to say?   Aren't they all conveniently vague enough to suggest that anything is possible?      All the wars, famines, superbowls, speed dating events, accidental frenulum tearing, voyages, nights in with a little popcorn and some draw. Could they have all been essential to mankinds eventual collective arrival as supreme beings???      Why the **** not?

Ok me and my exgirlfriend dated for five monthes. then in November she kissed me and left. i didn't hear more then three minutes out of her over four weeks. And everytime she came around her best friend, my brother, she didn't talk to me. It was an wierd silence in air when we were together after she left. i still have feelings for her and I was wondering if that awkward silence meant that she still likes me but thinks that I have moved on or does it mean that I am the only one in this relationship who still has feelings.

Not just in this section, but every section where I see a reference to anyone who's roman catholic, it's also tied closely to people who are strict and very "pursuitful" (for lack of me thinking of a word) in their religious beliefs.      I am catholic, on both sides of my family, and neither of my parents have really enforced going to church, being confirmed, etc. Is this atypical for Catholics, or is it just a stereotype that all Catholics act so strict?

So atheists use ridicule to educate theists?  Am I wrong about this? Am I generalizing some atheists?  I have read here in R&S that some atheists do in fact that ridicule of theists is a positive thing.  So how do you as an atheist effectively use ridicule?  If you don't, then why not?  Don't you too believe that theists need to be ridiculed?      Isn't that the whole point and ultimate end game of atheism, to ridicule any belief in God or gods, so that no one feels comfortable, and feels so embarrassed by their beliefs that they become atheists, just like you.      Please set me straight. I will read over some atheists' post while do just that.

20090202072108AA0Ygda	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	GOD has not blessed with affection of mother. But Jesus had the sweetest thing of life. So Mother affection?	is the main reason made JESUS kind hearted one. He is in one way blessed than god, who created him. Why not Mother Mary be counted as the supreme to give birth to JESUS? She is first and the best. This no way making Jesus less. Please try to understand the reality.  Just do not go with sentences of book.  See the Old Testament God? He himself led many wars, commanded for burnt offers and invading of other nations and imposed cruel punishments for simple faults or crimes of people, where as JESUS represented the PARDON and super seeded all the worst things of OT rules. That is because he had affection of Mother. Hence Praise Mother Mary along with JESUS.

20081109221615AAHVRr2	Society & Culture;Languages	Translate from spanish (I think) to english? (re: Guillermo Vargas Habacuc)?	I was reviewing this petition (  http://www.petitiononline.com/ea6gk/peti...  ) and wanted to research the "artist"..       From the following link I found the name that I'm trying to find some information about:       http://www.elheraldo.hn/Vida/Ediciones/2...       I can't ready any of the page, but i'm specifically curious about the following paragraph which mentions his name:           En el a?o 2007, Guillermo Vargas Habacuc, un supuesto ‘artista’, cogió a un perro abandonado de la calle, lo ató a una cuerda cortísima en la pared de una galería de arte y lo dejó allí para que muriera lentamente de hambre y sed. Durante varios días, tanto el autor de semejante crueldad como los visitantes de la galería de arte presenciaron impasibles la agonía del pobre animal. Hasta que finalmente murió de inanición, seguramente tras haber pasado por un doloroso, absurdo e incomprensible calvario. ?Te parece fuerte? Pues eso no es todo: la prestigiosa Bienal Centroamericana de Arte decidió, incomprensiblemente, que la salvajada que acababa de cometer este sujeto era arte, y de este modo tan incomprensible Guillermo Vargas Habacuc ha sido invitado a repetir su cruel acción en dicha Bienal en 2008. ??IMPIDáMOSLO!!!

Main paragraph:   A legitimate child of the Hyuuga's Main family, Konoha's distinguished family.

Her objective, is the one who in spite of the state of things got strong and changed her, separated from her somewhere in Earth making the effort to train, the person she yearns for.

In them, however, are some things hard to understand, which the untaught and unsteady are twisting, as [they do] also the rest of the Scriptures, to their own destruction.     17 YOU, therefore, beloved ones, having this advance knowledge, be on YOUR guard that YOU may not be led away with them by the error of the law-defying people and fall from YOUR own steadfastness. 18 No, but go on growing in the undeserved kindness and knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. To him [be] the glory both now and to the day of eternity.     Since one cannot come to the same conclusions that Jehovah's Witnesses do regarding JW's doctrines and beliefs without reading the publication of the WTBTS, would it be something to consider that maybe they are the ones that are twisting the scriptures to their own destruction. Just as the Mormons, one can't get their beliefs without their extra books, and other religions too...WHen one reads the Bible alone..they come to a total different conclusion about the deity of God and Christ and the Holy Spirit.

20090202085924AARdkie	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Shold hell be thought of as a punishment or as a lost opportunity?	Some object to hell as a disproportionate punishment, and they have a point:  No human crime seems serious enough to deserve infinite punishment.  But as a punishment, hell was prepared for the devil and his fallen angels, who had complete knowledge of God's love and yet rebelled against him, thwarting God's purposes and causing the loss of vast numbers of souls.      Consider an analogy:  If someone failed to obey warning signs that a bridge is out and drove his car into a river, we wouldn't think of his injury or death as a punishment, but as a lost opportunity to continue living. Would hell be similar, not a punishment but a dreadful eternity estranged from God, so that God does everything short of overruling our free will to prevent our downfall?

20090202085754AAhRZ1U	Society & Culture;Languages	Dyslexia & Learning a Foreign Language: Which One?	Summary: What foreign language would be easiest to learn for a dyslexic native English speaker?      I am an adult dyslexic.  I have "conquered" my dyslexia to a very large degree and am able to read for pleasure, write effectively, and basically function without anybody knowing that I have a disability.  I'm a very bright guy.  I'm even a member on Mensa.  But I have struggled for years with learning a foreign language.      I took french in elementary school and again in high school.  I simply didn't get it, but I was also still struggling with English at the time.  In college I failed French once, and upon retaking it didn't even try to learn it.  I passed by simply cramming and regurgitating for exams, but didn't really understand it at all.      I desperately want to overcome this hurdle.  I don't even care what language it is.  I know it will be difficult.      My question is this: which language(s) would be easiest for a dyslexic?  Would new alphabets make it easier or harder?  Are there languages that lack articles and masculine/feminine nouns (major problem areas for me)?  Am I just plain out of luck?

20090202090313AAQMcz0	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	How do atheists make decisions on a reason for living.?	Almost everyone has a reason for living.  Some of the answers I received to an earlier similar question are:      Girlfriend, Family, Country, Home, Money, morality, Humanity, Animal Rights, Food, Habitat, Companionship, my self, my friends, my hobbies, my job.      One answer was in part "There are billions of things that one can live for."      With all of those choices, how does the atheist go about making the decision as to which to choose?      A few answered that they just go with the flow (which I think is a good, honest answer).  I think most who answered can't imagine that there is a decision to be made and therefore couldn't figure out what I was writing about.      Do you go with the flow?  Do you adopt those things that make you happy as reasons for living?        Again, I am NOT asking what is your purpose for living, I'm asking how you go about making decisions between so many choices.

20090202215457AA71kB4	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	I was wondering about this ... ?	i just answered a question about gay marriages. because of religious reasons they say it's not ok. well, they also pointed out man law. now if they would not be accepted in the church, why not be accepted by man law? i mean, that should work, unless we are right about the church having a hand in government. arent those two supposed to be separate to beging with. i mean here in the U.S.   so when official make their decisions they are required to leave religion out of it and look at general public. ok so they arent able to have biological kids. but they sure can help the kids that are here already.   so why not have a ceremony that is a marriage by human law? they dont have to be married in a church right? so why not treat them as equal as the next straight person?   why not have two different ways to marry? would that not benefit all? even the church?    thanks for ur patience reading and i do want ur personal thought nothing else. no links or bible verses. just ur own thought. thanks   btw, i am straight and married. oh, and very curious.

20090202213032AAQbEAc	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	To LDS members only, what do you think about the sermon of Bringham Young below?	My next sermon will be to both Saint and sinner. One thing has remained a mystery in this kingdom up to this day. It is in regard to the character of the well-beloved Son of God, upon which subject the Elders of Israel have conflicting views. Our God and Father in heaven, is a being of tabernacle, or, in other words, He has a body, with parts the same as you and I have; and is capable of showing forth His works to organized beings, as, for instance, in the world in which we live, it is the result of the knowledge and infinite wisdom that dwell in His organized body. His son Jesus Christ has become a personage of tabernacle, and has a body like his father. The Holy Ghost is the Spirit of the Lord, and issues forth from Himself, and may properly be called God's minister to execute His will in immensity; being called to govern by His influence and power; but He is not a person of tabernacle as we are, and as our Father in Heaven and Jesus Christ are. The question has been, and is often, asked, who it was that begat the Son of the Virgin Mary. The infidel world have concluded that if what the Apostles wrote about his father and mother be true, and the present marriage discipline acknowledged by Christendom be correct, then Christians must believe that God is the father of an illegitimate son, in the person of Jesus Christ! The infidel fraternity teach that to their disciples. I will tell you how it is. Our Father in Heaven begat all the spirits that ever were, or ever will be, upon this earth; and they were born spirits in the eternal world. Then the Lord by His power and wisdom organized the mortal tabernacle of man. We were made first spiritual, and afterwards temporal.       Now hear it, O inhabitants of the earth, Jew and Gentile, Saint and sinner! When our father Adam came into the garden of Eden, he came into it with a celestial body, and brought Eve, one of his wives, with him. He helped to make and organize this world. He is MICHAEL, the Archangel, the ANCIENT OF DAYS! about whom holy men have written and spoken--HE is our FATHER and our GOD, and the only God with whom WE have to do. Every man upon the earth, professing Christians or non-professing, must hear it, and will know it sooner or later. They came here, organized the raw material, and arranged in their order the herbs of the field, the trees, the apple, the peach, the plum, the pear, and every other fruit that is desirable and good for man; the seed was brought from another sphere, and planted in this earth. The thistle, and thorn, the brier, and the obnoxious weed did not appear until after the earth was cursed. When Adam and Eve had eaten of the forbidden fruit, their bodies became mortal from its effects, and therefore their offspring were mortal. When the Virgin Mary conceived the child Jesus, the Father had begotten him in his own likeness. He was not begotten by the Holy Ghost. And who is the Father? He is the first of the human family; and when he took a tabernacle, it was begotten by his Father in heaven, after the same manner as the tabernacles of Cain, Abel, and the rest of the sons and daughters of Adam and Eve; from the fruits of the earth, the first earthly tabernacles were originated by the Father, and so on in succession. I could tell you much more about this; but were I to tell you the whole truth, blasphemy would be nothing to it, in the estimation of the superstitious and over-righteous of mankind. However, I have told you the truth as far as I have gone. I have heard men preach upon the divinity of Christ, and exhaust all the wisdom they possessed. All Scripturalists, and approved theologians who were considered exemplary for piety and education, have undertaken to expound on this subject, in every age of the Christian era; and after they have done all, they are obliged to conclude by exclaiming "great is the mystery of godliness," and tell nothing.       It is true that the earth was organized by three distinct characters, namely, Eloheim, Yahovah, and Michael, these three forming a quorum, as in all heavenly bodies, and in organizing element, perfectly represented in the Deity, as Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.       Again, they will try to tell how the divinity of Jesus is joined to his humanity, and exhaust all their mental faculties, and wind up with this profound language, as describing the soul of man, "it is an immaterial substance!" What a learned idea! Jesus, our elder brother, was begotten in the flesh by the same character that was in the garden of Eden, and who is our Father in Heaven. Now, let all who may hear these doctrines, pause before they make light of them, or treat them with indifference, for they will prove their salvation or damnation.       I have given you a few leading items upon this subject, but a great deal more remains to be told. Now remember from this time forth, and forever, that Jesus Christ was not begotten by the Holy Ghost. I will repeat a little anecdote. I was in conversation with a certain lear

20090202203309AAlS96W	Society & Culture;Holidays;Valentine's Day	Is he in love with me?	How can you tell if a guy youre dating is in love with you?   I know this is a hard question to ask.....but here's some facts about when we're together that maybe you can help me figure out. i think he may (he hasnt said it) but i dont know tell me what you think?.........   first off he calls me every day (i rarely get the chance to call first), he'll call meon his lunch break (or text me, cos if im working at the same time he's on break he cant call) ....he'll call me seriously the second he gets out of work and we'll usually talk from anywhere from 10-20mins (and this is every day).   he'll sometimes call before he goes to bed (or definetly will text me). when we hang out and are parting (either me from his house or vice versa) he makes it a point to call me the second he gets home (or insists i call him to make sure i get home ok).   when we are together......esp out in public, hes big on PDA's (public display of affection)......i noticed the other night at blockbuster, there were some cute girls across the way......he didnt seem to care that they were there (like most guys do, they have the wondering eye.....i notice that, but he didnt, if anything, he put his arm, around my arm in a linking chain sort of way, held my hand and then kissed it).   he called me one day cos a song was on his mp3 shuffle in his car that reminded him of me (just to say "hey our song is on, just wanted to let u know")   he does all the typical stuff, holding of the door, helping me with his coat on and always taking me out and paying.   we hang out anywhere from 1-3xs a week. (we both equally initiate plans.....me more so on saturday, but if we hang out extra days, like during the week, if he has free time from work and working on his masters he'll iniate those plans, that may happen like every other week or so.   i noticed on his iphone, his wallpaper is a picture of us.   ive met his parents (a bunch of times, and we've only been dating for 2 months).   we were out to dinner one night a buddy of his called, he was like 'i cant talk right now, ill call u later, im out with my girl"   when we're together, either his parents house or mine.......sitting on the couch, he always has to be snuggled with me one way or another, either just holding my hand, or with his arms around me, or even leaning on me so that im behind him and i have no choice to put my arms around me......he'll always kiss me here and there, either kiss my hand, my arm (if my arms are around him coming from behind) my cheek, head, or anywhere that he can. hes verrrrrrrrrrry affectionate with me.   ive met his friends.   so like i said.....i think he does. not sure tho' (cos i always have doubts) so i was thinking what you all thought. if these are tell tale signs that he does, or if theres other signs that are tell tale signs that he loves me. let me know, all feedback is great. thank you.

God-fearing Jews believe that the ultimate Redemption of the Jewish Nation will come about only through the Hand of God, and that at the time of the Redemption, peace will reign in the entire world. Any other type of forced redemption is but a sinful transgression, condemned by Hashem and His Holy Torah.        What more proof does one need than the fact that for centuries, Jews have lived peacefully in Arabic countries, enjoying the respect and friendship of their neighbors? The tragedy of Zionism changed all of that. The painful truth is that in the eyes of the Zionist government, Jews are merely the cannon-fodder needed for the 'State of Israel' to achieve its agenda, to the point that the Zionists collaborated with the Nazis to deny safety and life to many European Jews, so that the cause of the (Not) Jewish State could be forwarded.      Thoughts?  Reactions?  Thoughtful answers preferred.

20090203002140AAVM2Iz	Society & Culture;Etiquette	I think I insulted my teacher with a gift that I thought was very insignificant at the time but...?	I'm in college. My political philosophy professor has helped me tremendously and I have a great deal of respect for him. I smoke and so does he and the last few times I have run into him before class I have either just ran out of cigarettes or left the in the car, etc... and he always lets me bum one off of him. I felt a little rude for that...      I went to the smoke shop before school today for my own cigarettes and thought that I would replace the pack that has "lent" me. The cigarettes he smokes are the cheapest floor sweepings ever and you cannot even buy them by the pack, only by the carton - they are still DIRT cheap. So I just bought the carton and dropped the whole thing in his mail slot outside his office because I am not going to smoke those nasty things anyway.      He sent me an email saying "thank you" but to NOT do that again because he doesn't mind helping his students. I felt that the mood of the email was that he was insulted or thought it inappropriate to buy a teacher something. I didn't' mean anything by it and the last thing I would do is insult the man. I feel like I was rude while my intentions were nothing but good and thought it was no big deal. Am I worrying too much or do you think he's insulted?            He also said that he would keep them because he was taught that it was rude to reject a gift or a debt...      I think he is slightly overreacting but I just want to know if I was out of line so I don't ever cross it with my teachers in the future - or him since I will have him next semester also

20090203012614AAgZJSD	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Other - Cultures & Groups	What if it was the opposite?	People have had a go at me on here for identifying as white, and denying my black half. I was born to a white mother and black father, in 1989. I look mostly white, my skin is dark white, and my features are that of a white woman, excep my "booty". My black father totally abused my mother, constantly beating her, belting her and kicking her.   I think he may have even raped her, she has never said, but I suspect it.      One day when my father was at work, she packed our things and in a frantic hurry, we escaped. I was 5 at the time. I have spent the last 14 years of my life surrounded by my white family. I look mostly white, as I said, so I fir right in with them. I don't like black people, and I only date white men. I identify, and consider myself a white woman.       I know I can't change the fact that technically I am biracial. I know I always will be, no amtter what. I have learn to accept that. But I consider myself white, and identify as such.      Now, let's imagine the opposite scenario. A black girl is born to a white man and black woman. The white father abuses the black mother. The mother escapes with her child. the child looks mostly black. She is raised by her black family, and us sorrounded by blacks. She doesn't like white people, and identifies and considers herself black. She only dates black men.      How would you react to that scenario? Please be truthful.

God is personal thats the joy. God is not out there but in here, within the heart as scripture tells us. so yes athiests your right God cannot be proved but that folks is the nature of God, hence FAITH. and faith is a gift given to all those who are open to receive it again as scripture tells us. so u dont believe in God thats fine but u have no right to tell me that my experience is invalid because u have closed the door of faith on urself. oh one more thing please stop using the argument that religion is the cause of all wars its ignorant and stupid ever hear of pol pot, stalin maybe or what about a guy called hitler?

The sons of God saw the daughters of men that they were fair; and they took them wives of all which they chose. -- Genesis 6:2    There seems to be no good answer to this. Most believers say the "sons of God" are angels, and that these angels came down from heaven and had sex with women. But Christian Identity adherents say the "sons of God" were Adamic white men who were seduced by pre-Adamic non-white women. This race mixing event was what caused God to send the flood of Noah.

20060801101701AAku2xw	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	What does it mean to try and brainwash someone? Is science a cult? Is religion a cult?	Correct me if I'm wrong, I'm not a very intelligent person, is science a tool that we use to understand nature?      As an example, if someone taught me that the Earth was the center of the solar system,  this would be because they see the sun go up in the east and go down in the west, I would have no reason to think otherwise.      Using a tool of science, something called a telescope, I can gaze at the night sky, and record measurements of other planets, like Venus,  and I can record positions and make mathematical equations, and using this tool and math I can determine that the sun is in fact in the center of the solar system.      This is something that anyone can also repeat and get the same verifiable result.  There for this fact, that the sun is in the center of the solar system, is not "brainwashing"; but is an explanation of the nature of reality.      Are there any religious facts that people have, that I could get the same verifiable result by repeating the process?

Hello,      I just realized that I am a social/ psychic vampire, and that I constantly derive energy from other people. At first I was beginning to think that I was naturally gifted to become a personal banker or a personal relationship manager. However, I am now beginning to become aware of the fact that I simply like to be a leech and drain energy from others (and that I hate to be lonely) I do not wish to be a psychic vampire anymore since I do not want to cause others harm or act selfish.

People from ancient times believed that solar and lunar eclipses might be caused by the death of some important person. The people of Madinah began attributing the eclipse to the death of the Prophet's son, Ibrahim. Greatly displeased by this, the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) gathered the people and addressed them, saying:      "Eclipses of the sun and the moon are not caused by the death of any human being; they are two of Allah's signs. When you see the eclipse, you should show gratefulness to Almighty Allah and offer prayer to Him."(Al-Bukhari)       if he was a false prophet he cud have told lie....right            it is god who created the night and the day ,sun and the moon each one travelling with its motion in an orbit   quran c21 v33    point 1)night and theday   quran says night and the day,NOT DAY AND THE NIGHT   at time of creation there was no light   2) sun was formed 1st and then was moon   3)and its clear in verse abt sun and moon

If the Holy Spirit is merely a active force and has no mind of its own,answer me this    "16 But when there is a turning to Jehovah, the veil is taken away. 17 Now Jehovah is the Spirit; and where the spirit of Jehovah is, there is freedom. 18 And all of us, while we with unveiled faces reflect like mirrors the glory of Jehovah, are transformed into the same image from glory to glory, exactly as done by Jehovah [the] Spirit. II Corinthians 3:16-18 " Answer this~Is the Holy Spirit Jehovah as much as the father is?This is from The New Worlds translation,so you cant say it is a mistranslation.I am pointing out isnt the Holy Spirit called the Spirit of Jehovah or Spirit of God?Yes,no?

20060713065743AAGyFaw	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Is there a devil and where is he - is he omnipresent too?	To suggest that the devil is not created by god gives credence to the fact that the devil is an alternative god which manifested itself. Which means there could be several gods.  And if god is all powerful and created everything why did he create a devil in the first place and on what of the 7 days did he do it and why is  the creation of this other being not mentioned in the bible - I would have thought it would have been a whole chapter of its own.

My story>       When I was a young and immature girl in junior high, I went out with some friends one night (not good friends, mind you) and gave into peer pressure- egging the side of someone's house.      Years later, as a grown woman living in a place of my own- someone threw 2 bricks through the front window one night while I was sitting on the couch. One hit me in the hand, and one in the face and I ended up going to to the hospital (although it wasn't as bad as it looked, luckily).       I do think it was karma. The siding of a house ruined, and 3 times worse>>>my window smashed, a huge mess to clean up, the cost of replacing the window, the cost of the medical bills and ambulance ride, and the damage to my hand and cut on my face.      It's so much better to just be good in this world and have the good return 3 times strong instead of the bad! Lol!

Nas elei??es de 2000, o sistema do Tribunal   Regional Eleitoral (TRE) estava informatizado em todas as regi?es   do Brasil, com resultados em menos de 24 horas depois do início das   apura??es. O modelo chamou a aten??o   de uma das maiores potências mundiais: os Estados Unidos, onde a   apura??o dos votos teve que ser refeita várias vezes, atrasando o   resultado e colocando em xeque a credibilidade do processo.   5. Mesmo sendo um país em desenvolvimento, os internautas   brasileiros representam uma fatia de 40% do mercado na América Latina.   6. No Brasil, há 14 fábricas de veículos instaladas e   outras 4 se instalando, enquanto alguns países vizinhos n?o   possuem nenhuma.   7. Das crian?as e adolescentes entre 7 a 14 anos, 97,3% est?o   estudando.   8. O mercado de telefones celulares do Brasil é o segundo do   mundo, com 650mil novas habilita??es a cada mês.   9. Na telefonia fixa, o país ocupa a quinta posi??o em número de   linhas instaladas.   10. Das empresas brasileiras, 6.890 possuem certificado de qualidade   ISO 9000, maior número entre os países em desenvolvimento. No México,    s?o   apenas 300 empresas e 265 na Argentina.   11. O Brasil é o segundo maior mercado de jatos e helicópteros    executivos.   12. Por que nao se orgulhar em dizer que o mercado editorial de livros   é maior do que o da Itália, com mais de 50 mil títulos novos a cada   ano?   13. Que o Brasil tem o mais moderno sistema bancário do planeta?   14. Que as agências de publicidade ganham os melhores e maiores    prêmiosmundiais?   15. Por que n?o se fala que o Brasil é o país mais empreendedor do   mundo e que mais de 70% dos brasileiros, pobres e ricos, dedicam   considerável parte   de seu tempo em trabalhos voluntários?   16. Por que n?o dizer que o Brasil é hoje a terceira   maior democracia do mundo?   17. Que apesar de todas as mazelas, o Congresso está punindo seus   próprios membros, o que raramente ocorre em outros países ditos   civilizados?   18. Por que n?o lembrar que o povo brasileiro é um povo hospitaleiro,   que se esfor?a para falar a língua dos turistas, gesticula e n?o mede   esfor?os para atendê-los bem?   19. Por que n?o se orgulhar de ser um povo que faz piada da própria   desgra?a e que enfrenta os desgostos sambando.   é! O Brasil é um país aben?oado de fato.   20. Que os brasileiros s?o considerados os maiores   amantes do mundo, enquanto que os ingleses e os árabes s?o os   piores?   21. Que os brasileiros tomam banho todos os dias, às vezes mais de um    por   dia enquanto que os europeus tomam em média um por semana? O país do    mundo   onde a Gessy Lever mais vende sabonetes é o Brasil.   Bendito este povo, que possui a magia de unir todas as ra?as, de todos    os   credos. Bendito este povo, que sabe entender todos os sotaques. Bendito   este povo, que oferece todos os tipos de climas para contentar toda   gente. Por que o brasileiro tem a mania de só ser nacionalista e   patriota durante a Copa do Mundo?   Se fosse assim todos os dias, vibrador como é durante a Copa,   talvezhoje o Brasil seria uma super potência...Bendita seja, querida   pátria chamada Brasil!   reflita e sintar orgulho de ser BRASILEIRO!!!
20061017165918AAkNRI8	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	There's a sucker baptised every minute? To all who answered my last question, I apologize sincerely.........	I really, do sincerely apologize to everybody who answered my last question:    http://answers.yahoo.com/question/?link=...    I didn't mean to hurt anybody's feelings, I am a bad, naughty, EVIL little heathen(literally), but shouldn't this scare people? I didn't just twist God's word, I fabricated it--counterfeited it--I didn't even do that good of a job--and nobody noticed.      Now I count at least three people who answered who I know to be truly devout christians who know their bible as well as anyone--but nobody has it memorized, and framed inside a question, nobody thought to look it up--they just accepted it.      now for the REAL moral of this story--when I did this on Yahoo! Questions, it's not any real big deal and nobody got hurt--but what if the person doing it is a presidential candidate? or a medeival king?

20061005102231AALb0ib	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Why do people always say..."so do Christians" when you ask a question about Muslims?	Jesus and Christians gets parodied ALL THE TIME on Southpark, Mad TV, The Simpson's, various movies, and the Colbert Report. No one gets shot, stabbed or blown up. They aren't marching on the Pentagon and movie studios over it. If they find it sacreligious, they turn the channel, put the paper away...etc.       Anytime you open the paper, who is out en masse invoking terror in the NAME OF THEIR BELEIF? Sure, the Amish guy shot up a school house, but he didn't go in there representing for Jesus either and claim Jihad on the students.       I AM NOT A CHRISTIAN but I am tired of hearing people say this to me. Please, show me an article where some Christians, or hell, ANY major religion representative killed anyone in the name of Jesus, Krishna, Buddha, whomever in the past 6 months.       Are you just being cynical and attempting to be liberal minded? I'm black, but I'm not offended that blacks are the biggest minority population in US prisons. It's the truth.

Let's say, for example, you had made a planet filled with 6 billion people. You all gave them free will.       It turned out that the free will of 3 billion people didn't care about the fact that the other 3 billion people live in poverty, hunger or starvation.      You also saw that the rich 3 billion people kept on using free will as an excuse to get richer, and let the other 3 billion people would get poorer and poorer. The 3 billion poor people also have free will, but their free will didn't really count, because the free will of the rich 3 billion was superior.      Wouldn't you change it, if you came to realise that what you made, didn't really work out the way you hoped it would when you made it ?      Or would you do as all the previous Higher Powers, that kept hiding themselves behind the useless empty argument "oh, but they have free will" ?

But I knew I couldn't let it, because it was once dead. So I grab the cloth and threw it on the fish to stop it and tried to stomp it. The fish jump out and I continue to stomp it to death. For something in me knew I couldn't let the fish reach the water. I think because it was unnatural or that if it did something wouldn't be right. Maybe the fish got healed through me and I was so scared that it was alive again. That I over reacted and killed it.

And when he was gone forth into the way, there came one running, and kneeled to him, and asked him, Good Master, what shall I do that I may inherit eternal life?    :18  And Jesus said unto him, Why callest thou me good? [there is] none good but one, [that is], God.    1. He ran and kneeled before him, so was the Young Ruler making a public Display? 2. he call Jesus good.And asked "what must { I } do. Jesus replied why do you call me good there is none good but God. So was he trying to establish that "ALL" mankind need a Savior, not there own merit....next..   19.Thou knowest the commandments, Do not commit adultery, Do not kill, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Defraud not, Honour thy father and mother.    20  And he answered and said unto him, Master, all these have I observed from my youth.    1. why did Jesus only mention these commandments? could they be the ones the Young Ruler broke? 2.  wait till I finish to answer I ran out of space.

Dealing with skeptics, It turns out, is easier than dealing with dead people-all you do is ignore them.    There are some people who will never believe me, and I  don't care, I know the truth. And the longer I live the more I find out the truth about my life, who I am, who I was and who I am going to be. All the answers are connected within the spiritual world, beyond, and God. God is the master key.    Sounds crazy to those who never experienced spirits and communication.... I still seek these truths as they wish to give answer. And when we receive clues, it was for a reason.    I know you will bring up about evil spirits. Yes there is them too. But like earth there is good and evil, the same goes for the spiritual world.

I had some good lesbian friends in high school.  These were not bi-sexual girls, they were lesbians.  I noticed a pattern in that they would prey upon girls who were confused about their sexuality in hopes of converting them to the other side.  It never lasted more than a few months before the girls had realized that they weren't in fact gay, but had been taken advantage of.  I also realized the irony that the tactics these girls used to sway their vitims, were the same things they claimed to despise males for.  Why do lesbians do this?

AIDS/HIV    Statistics show that the majority of infected cases worldwide are men, women, and children with the highest infection rates in African nations due to lack of financial and social backing to stop the spread.Heterosexuals are the highest in infected cases worldwide.      Herpes   All are subjected to this and statistics show that 1 in 5 people, regardless of sexuality, have one kind of herpes or another.      Gonorrhea    All are subjected to getting this but the statistics show that this disease is more often passed through heterosexual sex      Hepatitis   Can infect anyone regardless of sexuality      Syphilis    Can infect anyone who has contact with someone who has a syphilis sore during ANY sexual activity of any sexuality      The list goes on...      STD's do not have a sexuality and there is no sexuality that is more "likely" to get a STD.Those who are more likely are people who believe themselves immune, while drunk or high, or just being irresponsible.

In the past year or so I have looked deeply into what I truely believe. I now know that I am an Atheist. I do not believe there is a God. (However, I'm not extreme about that. I keep an open mind.) I still attend religious education and go to church with my family because I am afraid that my family will ostracize me and treat me differently (I know they would) if they knew my true beliefs. My friend's cousin, who is 11, is getting a cancerous tumor removed. I wanted to take her to the movies tomorrow to help cheer her up. Tomorrow is Good Friday in Catholicism. My mother got very angry when I asked and said that I should be embarrassed for wanting to socialize on the day that Christ died. This is what I'm talking about. I'm afraid they would say the only reason I think that is to get out of church and religious ed. and situations like the movies I just mentioned because I am fairly young. But I know what I believe. What should I do?

20070714175655AA4SjBB	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	Aqui va mi segunda pregunta...?	He leido muchas veces sobre discriminacion y odio de ciertas personas o de grupos hacia la comunidad LGTB, pero tambien tiene que haber momentos graciosos y chistosos que nos ha pasado debido a nuestra condicion... Va la mia:      En mi trabajo tengo que ir como chico y hacer uso del sanitario de los hombres, asi que despues de haber almorzado, fui al ba?o a limpiarme los dientes y a los 5 seg. entro uno de nuestros proveedores al ba?o y abrio la puerta intempestivamente y cuando me vio que estaba ahi (de cabello largo recogido en una colita, de aretes y bien bonita) se quedo helado y con una cara de "ya-la-cague" nomas giro los ojos hacia la puerta para ver que decia el letrero; y ya cuando vio que decia "hombres" dio un profundo respiro, se quito la pausa (tambien la cara de "ya-la-cague") y fue al ba?o, orino y se fue... (si no se lavo las manos).   Ahi fue cuando me gano la risa y solte la carcajada a todo lo que da.      Cual es la tuya ?
20090202093620AAvMp0f	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Self-teaching about Islam - how to be respectful?	Questions for Muslims.  Am reading your Holy Book and a history of Islam, but learned in college to investigate my sources.  The more I read the greater respect I have for your Faith, so please take these questions in terms of a rough student making a sincere attempt to learn:    1. Is there a difference in respect level spelling The Friend of God's (pbuh) name between Mohammed and Muhammed?  If not, is there simply a preference among Muslims?    2. Same question regarding the Holy Book:  Qu'ran, Quran, Koran?    3. Recommendation(s) regarding history texts for a weekend reader (not a scholar) but naive student who reads only English and Spanish, educated entirely in the US?    Am at the point where I'd like to start asking questions but want to ask them respectfully.  THANKS!

He's been alive for more than 100 years already...unless their replacing the same groundhog and saying that it's the exact same one. I'm tired of him seeing his gosh-darned shadow, lol. Just kill him and replace him with a blind ground hog. (not really, but i hate winter)
