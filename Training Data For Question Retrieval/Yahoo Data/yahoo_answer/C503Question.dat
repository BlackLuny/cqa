20090220085526AA2ygMl	Health;Mental Health	Is love necessary in life?	I'm 21 and never been in a relationship, nor desire to be in one. I'm probably asexual. I think society puts way too much emphasis on relationships and finding that special someone. Why can't people just be happy with themselves? People think that being in a relationship will automatically make them happy and solve all their problems. Why is there obsessive interest over relationships?   I'm not really that close to anyone. I only have one or two friends. It's hard for me to get close to people in general...kind of because I don't see why people would want to hang out with me. So I guess in some ways, I have low-self esteem. I don't think I've ever emotionally opened up to another human being..   My question is, am I missing out on what life is all about?
20090220103342AAPr1yQ	Health;Diet & Fitness	I have some questions about salt/water retention making you look fat?	I have been thinking that I've been gaining weight, (in my tummy area) and I went to the doctor today, and I am still the same weight!! I have been eatting lots of sun flower seeds lately (lots of sodium). I've never been the type to bloat due to periods or salt, but my post baby body is not the same as before. Can salt cause so much water retention that I appear to have gained about 5/10 lbs? How do I/ How long does it take to go away? Obviously I have to stop eatting the seeds, but any other advice? How long will it take?
20090220103318AAdL4lE	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Allergies	Was I in the wrong?Food allergies and inlaws....?	Hello,   To start I have severe nut allergies...I can't be around them at all. My fiance and I both avoid it because if he eats something then kisses me, I could have a reaction.        So on to the problem... My mother in law doesn't like me because I am takeing her son away. Her words, not my own.      We were invited to a family dinner, and cards  at my inlaws. She is not very good with allergy friendly cooking and no matter how much I try to educate her, she has almost killed me 8 times. My fiance called and told her that we would be there for cards after they ate because of the lack of understanding with my allergies. She is blaming me, and she told to my fiance to reconsider what he'll be giving up. He just wants to keep me safe.      Now I feel guilty that we won't be there, but if she cooks anything with nut byproduct in it, I get rashy and my throat swells.      She's blaming me for him not being there to eat. Am I in the wrong here?  I didn't want to be rude or anything, my life is on the line.

20090220102417AAdF0d5	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Other - Diseases	I don't know whats wrong with me? weird illness?!?	Ok so on Wednesday i posted a question about me feeling unusually ill all of a sudden. On Tuesday night i was sat on my bed, and without feeling the slightest bit unwell i threw up. After that i've been feeling sick and suffered from diarrhea for about a day or so.   I was also experiencing loss of appetite. I did not feel hungry at all throughout the week. I thought it was best to still eat, so i did, but after eating i did not feel full up at all. It felt as though it didn't matter if i ate because:   a) i wasn't hungry in the first place   b) it wasn't doing anything after wards      So anyway, the sickness was gone this morning but i am still left with the fact that i am not hungry still. It's weird because the only days i have felt hungry this week were Monday and Tuesday. ;l      I also feel kind of dizzy and 'not with it'.   Please note i AM EATING breakfast, lunch and dinner (plus fruit as snacks) even though i do not feel hungry at all! So dizziness is not due to lack of eating.      Whats wrong with me??

I am not one to get headaches, much less the borderline migraine I had after the first and only reflexology massage I have ever had.  Not to mention that I didn't really enjoy my reflexology massage and found it rather uncomfortable, because she rubbed my feet pretty hard.  But, regardless - the circumstances surrounding this event were such that I may have been dehydrated after skiing all day on the mountain and having very little water to drink.

I try to go out and do obstacles but i cant accept failure and i cant just drop the past. I cant sleep anymore all i do is lay there and think with my eyes closed telling myself what i could have done with a decision or how much of a failure i am... i really cant live like this no more and its like i always had someone on my side to help me with life and now i have nobody because all everyone tells me is do what you gotta do... Someone please help me out because as the days go by i get closer and closer to giving up on life...

They don't take that very seriously that's for sure, but I'm fed up with alot of the behavior that I witness from doctors, nurses, etc. They act like a buncha jerks, who judge you, and make all sorts of assumptions and act like a buncha stay at home types who gossip about soap operas and crocs all day long. It's annoying.      I went into the ER due to a severe illness the other day, and they spent more time laughing and gossiping and being unhelpful and reacting really negatively when I had to buzz in the nurse...absolutely insane, and they kept saying, "would you like to see a counselor?" and treated me like I had mental issues...      So I was like okya, I don't give a f8ck catootey if YOU think I have mental issues. I'm angry and upset because I don't feel well at all and because I'm receiving sub-standard service. That doesn't require therapy, thank you. I also told them, just because I'm not conforming and acting happy like everyone else, and wearing crocs and gossiping about some stupid soap opera, that doesn't mean that i'm CRAZY.            WTF is wrong with these people? they're isane and I'm finally going to report them 100000000000 times to 100000000000 different people, and go on and on and on      non stop all day all night         until SOMEONE listens to me.         That behavior to be stopped.  Patients are NOT there to get made fun of, compared, judged, discriminated against, or expected to act like everyone else or act somehow to get the approval of the medical staff! it's not some sort of a doctor pleasing event,       WE'RE THERE TO GET TREATED!!!!!!!!!!!         Cut the office politics, the b8llshit, and the stupidity and leave it for the youngsters. It's ridiculous.

I have recently started going to the gym (4 weeks or so). I go four days a week for around 1h 30 min. I run 10 mins at level 10 on the treadmill then slow down to 6 for as long as i feel fresh. Then i do around 20 on the bike and 10 rowing and the rest is weights.... nothing too heavy but enough to feel it....      This is done 4 times a week and i do feel more healthy.... as i am new to the gym is it too much or not enough... what would you suggest for a better workout or improvement.        Also i am aiming to increase the treadmill speed by 0.2 every two days... is this ok?

20090220104248AAcEEuQ	Health;Diet & Fitness	Do you agree? diets are a pain and not always the answer!?	I had been trying to diet for ages, eating right and healthy, doing regular exercise...every single thing i should have been doing on a diet i was... and yet i wasn't losing any weight, and that's not because i was doing anything wrong, its because i, and my body just didn't agree with it and the emotional side of it got me really depressed... i was only 8 stone 3 when i started to diet and i just wanted to lose a couple of lbs and i ended up a few months later a stone heavier than i was!!!!      I went back to my old routine of eating what i want when i want (which wasn't all junk food by the way, i do like a lot of healthy food natural), and also i added more exercise to my original normal 'routine; and made a few extra healthy choices and swaps and now i have lost all the weight i wanted to and i am happier than ever and the perfect shape.      Do you agree, or have you experience something the same or similar?      What i wanted to know has anyone ever experienced what i have, and agrees that dieting and 'healthy eating' can be a load of bull, and you should be able to eat what you want when you want, still be able to keep it healthy and have some treats and junk as well, and easily have a perfect body!!!1

20090220104524AAsM2Dt	Health;General Health Care;Pain & Pain Management	How do I explain a harsh pain in my left-side chest area when I take a deep breathe or something?	Three days ago while I was coming back from school I felt an awful pain in my heart area as well as in the same spot in my back.       I think I could feel the pain any time I took a breathe and my chest reached some level. So I had to sit down and stop taking deep breaths. My heart rate was not increased; I wasn't feeling dizzy; I was only feeling the pain which was unbearable. I also could feel some pain or something weird in my left side of the neck... I was scared that I might get some attack or something.       I have had this same pain happening about 6, 7 times before for the last year or so... but it was not as painful as this time. In the previous times I didn't any pain in my back and neck...      I went to a doctor...he checked my lungs, heart, pulse, blood pressure, EKG and they were all good. So he told me it was a muscle cramp or something like that.. He told me it's connected with some nerv and that's why I could feel pain in my neck and back.      So my question is... does anyone know what that might be and what to do to prevent myself from this really painful thing occuring again.       Please, anyone knows something...?

A while ago while I was on a break from my previous job, I saw a lady coming out from a Dentist Office and I think she was a Dental Assistant (her uniform was the big clue).  I thought, ' hey, that looks like a good career choice'.  But then I notice that mostly females are dominate in the Dental Assistant Field.  I don't want to seem sexist but every time I visit a dentist; a woman would assist the 'Male' or 'Female' Dentist.      So I'm asking; why aren't there more males out there studying to become a DA?

Before I go to my appointment to get it checked out, does anyone know what this might be/be caused by? Does anyone know any way I can treat it before I see a doctor?

For a few weeks now, I've been experiencing a weird head pressure and lightheaded/dizzy feeling. It comes in waves (the dizziness) but the pressure is pretty consistent.       The pressure is almost coming from the middle of my head (I've had many sinus infections/headaches and this feels like a completely different type of pressure).       Sometimes, I will even feel a sharp pain shoot in my head, but it goes away. I haven't blacked out, passed out, or fainted. My blood pressure is completely normal (110/70) and my pulse is around 50 bpm (slightly lower than most people).      The doctors think that is has something to do with my heart (I feel an occasional flutter) but I'm not sure I'm convinced. What could this possibly be??

My migraines always start off with fuzzy strange shapes in my eyes ( I believe this is called aura?), and after that a splitting headache + vomiting.

I'd simply like to know beforehand so that if/when I ever do want to use it, I'll know if there are any risks involved.
20090220113655AAi8sYE	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Respiratory Diseases	Best way to treat Anxiety Attacks I get often?	I am 16 years old, and it seems like my chest hurts constantly every singe day. I also have trouble breathing, however I have not been diagnosed with Asthma before. On this site I read about people's chest pain being a result of anxiety and stress and this seems to be the most probable cause for my chest pain, as I am in pretty good shape. I usually put unnecessary pressure on myself to do the best I can at school, and I am constantly stressing out over not doing well in school, although I always seem to get A's and B's. The stress I put on myself is a result of never feeling good enough, as I don't have any friends, and as a result I feel A need to do the best I can at my schoolwork, even if that means putting lots of stress on myself. So my question is this, what can I do to take some stress out of my life???

20090220113550AAIDtdD	Health;Mental Health	How would you approach your GP about this?	I was actually putting this problem off for about 3 years because I didn't think it was important but finally I decided to go for it. So basically my symptoms are somewhat weird, they don't match well for anything I looked at before. I have a problem with maintaining interpersonal relationships, with perceiving other people's personalities, such as the last meetings determines what I think about that person regardless of previous experiences with them; I have a very strong black and white way of thinking; I have depressive episodes or I just simply feel flat, but still have mood swings. I feel extremely 'bored' and empty all the time; I never experience feelings of guilt or consciousness; I am often restless and easily irritated. I have a history of substance abuse, and I had a few overdoses, although never went to the hospital. (usually I wait until my system clears itself out) So basically I just don't want him to think I'm a complete nutcase and a danger to myself but I don't want to sound attention seeking as I assume there a lot of people coming to him with problems like this.So what would you say?

20090220111725AAcOHzf	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Allergies	How do I know for sure if my son is lactose intolerant?	My son always has very soft/runny poo. He used to cry out in pain when he went but thankfully that has now stopped. He went off baby milk at about 12 months and didn't really have much milk until he was about 15 months when he suddenly started drinking loads of it again, he is now 19 months old and for the past month I have been giving him lactofree milk. He has become much happier and has even had a couple of solid poo's with no problems at all. The doctor doesn't seem to take my concerns seriously and so I don't know whether to treat him as lactose intolerant, in which case we should see a dietitian or not?      If anyone has any experience of this or alternative explanations please help.

20090220113608AAZT89k	Health;Dental	6/7 years ago I had fixed braces put on my top & lower teeth to correct protruding top front teeth, I also had?	..a 7 hour operation to pull both plates of my jaw forward as the teeth on my bottom jaw were pushing my top front teeth forward and I was told my top teeth would end up being almost horizontal! (the operation was supposed to be 5 hours but there were 'complications' so it was 7).     I had initially had to wait 5 years to have the fixed braces on the NHS because of an administration error! (My dentist kept saying, 'Keep waiting, be patient, if I hassle them they might say you're being unrealistic and strike you off the list'. Then he died-probably of old age as he was ancient - and my new dentist phoned the hospital for me & discovered that they had no record of my referral, so I had to then be put on the waiting list for real and wait even longer!)      After my jaw operation I was worried the lower jaw hadn't been pulled forward enough but my surgeon said 'Don't worry your teeth will never move now'.    My braces were taken off & I was given a thin, brittle plastic mould of my teeth to wear at night. I asked for the usual retainer where you have a metal bar across your teeth 24 hours a day but they said they don't do those anymore.     I was told to wear the plastic every night for a year. I decided to wear it for longer because I wanted to keep my perferct teeth and was paranoid! But after a year & 1/2 of wearing it at night, it snapped, (my teeth had been moving against it and caused it to crack I guess). I was working in Thailand at the time so I couldn't go back to my hospital in England to get a new one & thought, 'Well I've worn it every night for longer than they told me to, so it should be ok.' When I did go back, 6months later, my 2 front teeth were protruding. I asked if there was a brace they could put on that would tighten them back again and was told there was nothing they could do.       9 months later I went back again as they'd been moving even more. I saw a different orthodontist who said that    a) I must have misheard my surgeon saying that my teeth will never move because they never say that,    b) I must have misheard the person who gave me the retainer because I was supposed to wear it every day for the rest of my life not just for a year! (If that was true, why are they made out of such thin brittle plastic?) and    c) the only thing they can do is to put fixed retainers on my teeth again for 3 years.    She said that I should think about it and write a letter to say whether I wanted to commit to that or not. I wrote to her to ask if I could have them but that I was going to Australia in a year on a year's working-holiday visa because I had missed out on doing this with friends when I was waiting for my first lot of braces and I was now at the cut-off age for eligibility for working visas. I asked if I could I have them put on when I returned. She never replied and when I phoned, her secretary said that she would phone me back but she didn't.      Now I'm back from Oz, I'm 33 and I look goofy! They've moved even more and I hate it, it's uncomfortable, I can't smile naturally - have to think about it first and rearrange my face so that I'm not looking too much like a rabbit when I finally do it. It's awful. I don't know if my old hospital will put fixed braces on my teeth again and really don't want to go through having them again as a) we would like to emigrate but have to do it in the next 2 years because of my boyfriend's age and b) feel that the NHS have acted like charlatons. I've found that if I go private I can wear invisiline braces for a year and 1/2 at the most and they'll move my teeth back, but they'll cost me more than ￡2,000. The hospital told me that putting those old-fashioned metal fixed braces on my teeth will cost the NHS ￡5,000! (If this is correct, somebody in the NHS is making a profit out of it if it's cheaper privately!)      Should I make a complaint to the NHS for how they've been and the fact that I don't feel I've been given the correct treatment?

Here's reasons she said no.      -I could go to the gym (But I'm very much am a coward, and people I know go to the gym, and I'm embarrassed)   -I used to HATE running, but it's gotten to the point where no matter if I like it or not, I need to.

But...Idk, any advice on how to ask her again.      Oh and btw,    -I can't run outside (freezing)   -My school has no track that i can use or treadmills there.   -And I live in a ranch house so I can't climb up and down stairs.

Girls are constantly complaining that it's not right to call someone fat, and there's way too much pressure to be skinny.      On the other hand, when they see a skinny girl they automatically assume that she is anorexic...      So they want to be skinny, but they tell skinny girls to "eat a sandwich!"      This is so hypocritical. I know this from experience because I'm a naturally skinny girl and I'm constantly mocked and called anorexic which is very offensive and I'm very happy with my body. So they call me anorexic but then they say "Oh I wish I had your body!"

20090220123346AAIzO56	Health;Mental Health	Had horrible panic attack last night...?	I've had Panic Disorder for almost a year and have been on Lexapro and Xanax since, which have helped and my panic has been under control for about 5 months. Last month, I decided it was time to start weaning off the xanax. I cut my dose from 1.5mg a day to 1mg a day, gradually of course. Then, my weight has gotten so out of hand, I decided I wanted my psychiatrist to swap my anti-depressant. He wrote me Effexor, which I'm still weaning off the Lexapro and am waiting to start it. Last night, I had 2 glasses of wine and 5 hours after, had a HORRIBLE panic attack. I started thinking about the future and what was going to happen to me, my family, will i ever be able to have kids, everything! I had to break down and take an extra .25mg of xanax, so i could sleep. I'm scared I'm getting back in the habit of panic attacks...I'm also on a decongestant that says it can cause anxiousness...I just don't know what to do. Any advice on how to not be afraid anymore?
20090220124127AA9aHzZ	Health;Men's Health	When retracting my foreskin, how long should it be exposed?	A couple of nights ago I retracted my foreskin for the first time. It was hyper-sensitive, and due to some research and Y!A I have come to the conclusion that this is normal for the first time.      I have now been suggested to retract the foreskin regularly every night, and in the bath/shower. I was not told how long to keep the foreskin retracted.      I have a couple of questions actually;      1) How long to keep the foreskin retracted, and the head exposed.   2) When bringing the foreskin forward over the head I was told to cup my hand and squeeze gently on the penis head. The problem is this hurts so much, is there any other way/any tips to get over the pain.      I am 13 years old, and I think all answers.

Ok so im 22 and had issues with food since the age of 15 when i went from 138llb to 109llb by not eating.    I have never truly got over this.      I can eat normally even have a takeaway for 3-4 weeks and then for the next few weeks, i feel so bad that i just live on coffee and slimfast.      I can then eat normal healthy for a few months and end up going back to not eating.      I get to an obsessed point then feel so bad on my 13 month old son cause i dont have energy, that i start to eat normal again.      I dont think this way of eating is doing my body much good and i never wanyt my son to see this as he grows up, as i love him dearly, what would this be classed as cause its not an eating disorder as im 5ft 6 and weigh 130llbs, which is healthy for my height.      I just want to stop it.

My dentist said he is "really disappointed in me!" in a loud, angry voice the other day when about to place a crown as he said I should not have asked for written proof from lab that they sent the crown I ordered (as the packing slip said something different than what I ordered - he said ignore the slip, the crown was right...)...anyway I have to return this week for the 'seating' and 'the proof'  that it is correct crown (actually I think they are sending a new one as I heard him yell at the lab they got it wrong but he won't admit it!).. I have since looked up the lab (saw it also on the packing slip on the counter) and learned that it has a local lab and within it an international lab that uses their CHINA location (FDA approved and visited by the local lab 5 times/year); specifically for scripts when costs are a factor...dentists are told to write on a certain color order slip for 'lower costs' restorations. I feel I need to ask my dentist if the crown made for me was done in-house locally or sent out from the local lab to China. I know I have the right to ask but he takes things so personally and I overheard him loudly on a hallway phone spell my name (for the lab to look up the 'correct slip') and muffled to the lab l that I was 'impossible'...I don't know if anyone will be honest anyway but feel the need to know 'at least I asked'...I have read that US domestic labs also may have lead as the ADA allows traces of lead up to a certain amount (on their website)...so should I just have it placed and take a pre and post lead test?  I am really not sure if I am over-reacting. I understand that the lead may not just be from the glass in the porcelain but the shading (coloring?) process of the tooth. Any professionals with advice out there or others with the words to say to my dentist at this point? I am really very concerned. I already have alot of amalgam fillings and heard lead and mercury are a bad combo!...one that with the ADA allowance for lead in terms of soluability makes me think is unavoidable? Any info helpful!

My son was talking and using 3-4 word sentences until something happened which he witnessed with his father and I. He has now regressed and is in speech therapy and play therapy. His therapist has only advised me to be patient while she works with him but things are getting worse. He screams and crys 95% of the time he is awake I have taken him to his pediatrician many times to be sure he isn't sick and he is 100% healthy. An example of his behavior is if he has a pen I will ask him to give it to me 3 times. He only gets three chances and I give him a minute to decide after that I take the pen. He will scream for 10-15 minutes non stop. After he is done screaming and following me around he will pick up something else he knows he shouldn't have. I have tried time out but he will not sit in time out. Trust me I tried reinforcing it for about a month picking him up and putting him back in time out won't work. I am so lost and feel like im losing it. He won't play by himself and just won't stop crying. Before all of this happened he was such a good kid now I feel like this will never end. Please help. I dont know what to do anymore.

I've gained ten pounds in the past month and it seems like my skin is getting tighter. Also, at night, I always feel at itch on my belly, on the back of my legs, and sometimes on my arms. And if they aren't itching, they burn only a little. Could this be I'm getting stretchmarks? I've already have some around my belly and my breasts, but I've only felt my skin tighten right now....      And my eating habit is TERRIBLE. I feel like it's not a lot, but to the people around me (like my parents and sisters) tell me I should cut it down a little. I really can't help it. I need big help.      But for right now, these are going to be stretchmarks on my skin, right?

20090220123435AAnfQrW	Health;Optical	Possibly going blind?	I'm 15 years old and had never had any trouble with my eyes really except I had a horrible eye infection as an child but my eyes were fully recovered from that according to the docter, But because of the infection I missed out on so much school I had to be homeschooled so I never had any friends to play with or anything to do really, So I would go on the computer and play games and stuff but I would just spend like 7 hours straight on the computer every day, I did that for years even though my parents told me not to, Finally my eyes started to feel real dry and hurt and so my parents took me to the eye docter, she said my eyes were very dry and to just use some eye drops and stop going on the computer for so long and so I did later she when I went again she said I had a slight stigmatism not bad enough to start wearing glasses, My eyes got better but never really felt right after that after a couple more years I noticed I couldnt see things I used to be able to see perfect but I didnt tell me parents anything about it, One day I got a flu and had a pretty high fever and one morning when I got up I went to go to the bathroom, after that I started feeling really dizzy and my vision completly went away for a phew seconds I went completly blind, I went to the hospital after that and they said it was just dehydration because I wasnt drinking enough, This all happind about...2 years ago, And after that I kept seeing big spots so my parents took me to eye docter again, She said they were just floaters and they would go away and that my stigmatism had gotten worse and I needed to wear glasses now, Well the big spots went away and my vision was fine with my glasses even though my eyes were still kind of dry, and I was only spending an an hour or so on the computer.   But then I started seeing a different kind of spots, they were tiny and always flashing and moving, kind of like...when you turn you're TV on and you forget to turn the satelite on and the TV goes crazy with all thoughs black and white spots but the eye docter said they would go away too so its been about a year, And I think now there only geting worse, I used to see them in the dark worse but I can even see them now during the day, And even more recently I think my vision is geting even worse, Sometimes things seem a tiny bit blurry even with my glasses on. And they still feel kind of dry and hurt, I figured all of this is from spending all that time on the computer but I dont even spend that much time on the computer now and they're still geting worse? Am I slowly going blind?

20090220124133AAdpXDR	Health;Diet & Fitness	Opinions on a diet pleease;?	So, anyone with a little knowledge about diets.. could you tell me how this sounds.      I'm 15, and i weigh just a little over 200 lbs. I'm 5'6, too. Most of the weight i want to lose is in my stomach, and legs.      So.. I figured to cut back on eating as much as I do I would eat like this:      Drink some kind of juice for breakfast, because I can't eat in the morning or I feel sick.. I don't know why.. weird, I know.      Then for lunch at school just drink milk and maybe eat a few bites, but nothing with bread and carbs and stuff.      Then, when I got home from school maybe eat a small salad, banana, or sandwich as a snack.      Then eat a smaller dinner, and nothing to fatty. And if I do have to eat something with a lot of fat, not eat all of it.      My biggest challenges are going to be to stop drinking pop/soda and stop eating chips. I don't have a problem with sweets and sugar, I don't eat them anyways.      So tell me what you think. Also, I thought I'd start going for like 20 minutes on my exercise bike or like a bun/thigh shaper we have every other night, and the nights in between do crunches or leg lifts or something?       If you have any tips about how you lost weight or better exercises that would help a lot, thanks :)

20090220125518AAqKG0L	Health;Mental Health	Why am I so dizzy/confused/dreamlike?	This has happened to me three times now in the past few months. At first I thought it was symptoms from drinking alcohol (I have read other peoples questions and I was getting the same thing- I would drink one night and for a week after I would feel dizzy, confused, kind of like I am dreaming and it would normally take a week to snap out of it and back to normal- I thought it was some kind of reaction to liquor). Now, I was just sick this past weekend and slept a lot (I had a high fever and a bad cold) and since Monday I have this feeling again- so needless to say it isnt from drinking alcohol since I didn't go out all weekend. I am like completely out of it, have a hard time concentrating on anything, and just very spacey. Its def. not from a lack of sleep because I have been sleeping a good amount (more than normal but not oversleeping)... and I am still drained and feel strange.   I feel it the most when I am walking and driving.       If anyone knows what this is or can help... please do! Thanks!!

I graduated from college last year and have had no luck finding a professional job.  There have been sweeping budget cuts and they aren't hiring teachers in my state at all.        I had a smattering of random jobs after graduating, my degree was Elementary Education.  I have worked at Kmart for seven years and i Hate it with a passion.  I worked at Ross and I also worked at a daycare.  I was fired from the daycare because a coworker decided to tell the boss that I wasn't doing my part, which was a lie.  I have had a hard time motivating myself to keep looking.  No one worth working for is hiring and even if they are there are tons of more qualified people out there.  My question is, how do I help myself believe in me again when I haven't in so long.  I come from an abused background.  My boyfriend has tried to help me, but he's drowning in his own homework.  He graduates in May and may have to move back home. I was fired from the daycare job around the time his sister got married and I was crushed because his family didn't want me there, and I couldn't afford to go.   I felt so worthless.  I don't know how to live again.  I feel like I am wasting my best years.

They have never had a cold sore but she said that she was told she had it when she got very painful bumps on her tounge that looked like swollen tastebuds. Also if you have genital herpes is there ever a safe time to have sex where it is 100% garenteed that you will not spread it or is that never possible. And if that is not possible then that means that you can never get pregnate. If you do not have any sores on the outside then how do you know that you have it? She said when she looked inside of her the only thing that she has is way back there and it does not look like pimples but she does not know if it is normal.

20090202214610AAwsmyv	Health;Diet & Fitness	Could you give me any advice on dieting tips, tricks or motivation?	I am overall thin, 25 years old, 5'5, 120lbs typically would look to have an average body build. But I have noticed now (in the middle of winter) I am gaining all this fat in my stomach, upper thighs, love handles and back. My jeans that fit perfectly this fall, now either fit uncomfortably and disgustingly tight or not at all. I have that muffin top look and am completely embarrassed, I have been wearing hooded sweatshirts all winter and barely even noticed the change happening until it was too late. I have just been eating whatever I want not realizing the toll it was taking. I cant even wear any of my cute stuff. I just want to cover it up. I am not typically a negative person but it's hard not to be upset and crabby because I just feel ugly. Every time I look down I am completely disgusted in disbelief. I look like am 3 months pregnant along with back fat!! (which I am definitely not!) So enough is enough! Any good tips on how besides joining a gym, that could help me get rid of this and be back in shape by summer time would be highly appreciated!

( clenched teeth )      my psychiatrist is adamant i DONT have bi polar  ,  only borderline personality.            years ago i was diagnosed with borderline personality disorder and my psychiatrist also accepted i have PTSD traits to.      im 31 and have endured a very hard life with abuse, victimization, mental abuse all throughout .      my symptoms from the age of 16 which got worse as years past by are :         mind racing, cluttered, scattered thoughts, forgetting what i was thinking minutes before ---obsessive worries--- repetitive asking questions on yahoo about same life circumstances ----- impulsive outbursts of rage in public, difficult controlling aggression and rage ; antisocial anger towards people ; spacing out ( dissociation ) - persecutory paranoia , agoraphobia , intense panic and anxiety feelings when outside , palpitations ; a feeling of feeling abandoned and out of control : always found it difficult to concentrate and absorb information : ( although ive read books and understood them ) : keep having to re read sentences to understand them : mind drifts off whilst reading a page of words.            always had low self esteem, difficulty interacting, forming and maintaining friendships . im very intellectual and are often told im very intelligent, understand things well, talk well , and have a good mind. have a good imagination. can converse very well.      as a kid was quite hyperactive, always running around , but calmed alot into teenage years.            my mind always races every day, racing thoughts, keep forgetting things , my mind feels scattered with thoughts, difficulty trying to organise and structure.   have obsessive worrying thoughts about physical, mental health.            everyday i get mood swings, from feeling totally depressed and despairing one minute , then the next minute , ' ok '' again - if im in a severe depressive low , then someone talks to me, reassures me, gives me clarity ---- my mood will suddenley lift to feeling ok again --            so would that rule out having bi polar ??               i used to have aggressive outburst in public, where stress would build up...my thoughts would race...disorganised....get paranoid that people were threatening me or persecuting me , get jealous of happy people -- than i would just end up losing it like a mad man, threaten people attack, lash out at strangers....            this has greatly improved for years now....i learned to control my behaviour, been seeking help. even though psychotherapy isnt available because of lack of resources.               i often worry though do my symptoms mean any other disorder other than borderline personality disorder ??            like : OCD , GAD , bi polar , add , ?? what do you think ?         i lived as a reclusive for many years, developed agoraphobia , and only go out to pay bills do shopping etc - i have bad anxiety and panic attacks when i go out, hyper vigillant , cant venture far from my neighborhood anymore etc. i stay in my apartment most of the time etc.

20090220114528AAJIOO0	Health;Mental Health	My Dr. prescribed me Lorazepam for my flight anxiety. Will it work?	My Dr. prescribed me Lorazepam for my flight anxiety. Will it work? Also, how should I take them, he prescribed 2-3 as needed per day, but the thing is I will have to deal with a total of 4 flights. The first flight is 6 hours, the second flight is 8 hours, and then when we come home the first flight is 10 hours and the second is 6. There isn't any one part that freaks me out - its the whole thing. I have been on 12 flights total including two international - and it was miserable. I feel like I am going to have a heart attack the whole time, and I am terrified before hand. We leave in two weeks and I am already starting to have horrible nightmares. So I guess I am wondering if anyone has taken Lorazepam for this, how well did it work, and how much and when did you take it? Thanks so much! (He gave me a total of 20 .05 MG tablets)      *I also take Wellbutrin XL 300 mg - does this mean I should increase what would normally be done because it has a tendency to heighten anxiety?

I have had low iron levels for 6 months now, levels are down to 4 but can range up to 12. Doctor says he does not class me as anaemic, however i have been taking iron tablets for past 5 months. 322mg x 2 times a day (ferrous fumarate) I do not feel any benefit from these tablets, i feel queasy an hour after taking them, they cause me bowel problems too. I have started to feel progressively worse recently, very tired, depressed, very very pale and black circles under my eyes. I have previously been tested for celiac which came back fine. As mentioned above, I have been on these iron supplements now for 5 months and i have been starting to feel worse the last 6 weeks or so. Bruising quite easy too. I exercise 2-3 times per week, eat very well and lots of iron-high foods. Why are my iron levels not rising and why am i feeling worse? Also why does the doctor say he isn't classing me as anaemic?

20090220150301AAPbHTA	Health;General Health Care;Other - General Health Care	My 18 year old daughter gets a seriously bad cold every month. Is a messy room to blame?	My daughter is always sick and I'm at my wit's end. She doesn't have a perfect diet but it's not bad and she eats a lot of fruit. Still, she goes down with whatever's going round and is off work or college for at least 3 days every month. I've tried to make her more independent by asking her to clean her own room and do her own laundry but it hasn't worked and she has a really, really messy room that is so full of junk and clothes it can't be cleaned properly. She doesn't do her laundry for ages and I don't think her sheets have been washed for months. She is prone to leaving dirty cups and plates in there for days until I can't stand it anymore and go in there to fetch them. It's like a jungle in there though. Someone told me this could be why she gets sick so often. Is there any truth to this?
20090220150354AAohhL5	Health;Other - Health	Is it just me, or is there something wrong with my feet?	I've had this problem for a while now, probably about three or four years, maybe longer. I can't walk on my toes in anything but shoes, and while it isn't so bad in socks, I definitely can NOT walk on my toes while barefoot. It never used to be this bad, but as I discovered last weekend, it's impossible for me to walk on my toes without my feet becoming painful. The arches of my feet are partially fallen- I say partially because they are not completely flat, but they aren't normal either. I cannot wear narrow shoes or heels for this reason.      I also have occasional issues when swimming, but they're a bit different. They really aren't similar at all, even the pain is different, but I'll mention them anyway. Sometimes (note- not always) one of my feet (usually the same foot) will start feeling like a bone slipped out of place. Obviously, if I'm in the water, I have to get out, because I can't swim with one foot useless.      I hope that's enough info for a good answer...
20090220150535AAkSp5Y	Health;Men's Health	Prostate Exam gone wrong!!!Help please?	Here is the thing. About 2 months ago I went for a Rectal Ultrasound Exam. This is not the DRE(digital rectal exam) that is done by the use of an index finger with a lubricant. Some doctors refer to it as TRUS(trans-rectal ultrasound). The exam is done with an impelement called "Rectoscope" here is the picture of it:  http://www.kolonrektum.com/images/rectos...       I was sent there by a urologist, who thought a 22 year old could actually have something wrong with his prostate. Weirdly enough, I agreed since I didn't know what I signed up for. The examiner assured me that no harm will be done. The exam took about 10-15 seconds, a bit painful but adjustable afterwards. The only problem was that the examiner never bothered to ask me about the presence of hemorrhoids. I didn't tell him because back then I didn't know it would be a problem . Anyway, when the exam was over, he to told me to clean up and go home. There weren't any suggestions on how to make it through the day. The exam results turned out to be perfect NO prostate cancer NO swelling. But up until today, I have now inflamed hemorrhoids and my stools are always hard to pass. My proctologist is almost certain that the rectoscope has ruptured my anal area. And today when passing a stool my internal hemorrhoids popped out. It's grey and not that hard, but it won't go back in and it hurts. This is all thanks to that exam.    The question is for those who took the same test and were the consequences such as mine???!!! Thank you.

I know this is gross but I'm human and at times things go wrong with my body and at this point I don't even care because I am in so much discomfort. At first , day 1, I felt the need to go # 2 so I went to the restroom and nothing. I put some strain because I thought it would come out but no I was wrong. After this I thought okay well later this evening it will pass, now it's day 5 and still nothing but very little runny stuff. I can feel it at the bottom but it won't budge. Is this constipation or a blockage or is there a difference? I'm a 26 year old female and I'm not pregnant. I'm pretty healthy and exercise regularly, actually it all started after my pilates class. The day before I went to a BBQ and ate bread pudding and some fried crap but I never had any bad reaction to it before. I don't have a fever and the only thing that hurts is my rectum as it feels there is stool that needs to be let out. Also I've been taking probiotic's to aid with my digestion and on day 3, I took very mild laxatives and again yesterday but nothing but some mild gas. HELP!!!! Do I need an enema? And if anyone has ever had one, are they painful?? ALso it is difficult for me to urinate because it makes my rectum hurt when putting any type of pressure in that area, however I can still urinate and it is not painful. I will go to the doctor if this is not cleared up by tmrw but I want to know what it may be or if anyone has and a similar experience. Thanks!

So i got really sick with high fever and usually i don't take drugs, i just try to drink lots of water and let it go away, so i never took tylenol in my life before. So as i said i got really sick  andi had a really high fever ( almost 39.5C to be precise) today and i really needed to get well for tomorrow , so i decided to take Tylenol for the first time, it worked like magic and within an  hour or so the temperature was down to roughtly a little bit than 38C which is good. Now, i realized that i took the "extra strengh" tablet, and i know that after people take a certain dose their bodies become used to it and they have to increase the dose for the tylenol to funcion. I know that i should have gotten a regular one and not "extra strengh" but i didnt see it , so i would like to know if after taking the "extra strengh" tablet my body became used to it and the next time i will have to take bigger dosages or one time doesnt change much?

I think I am healthy at 5'1 ft and 98 lbs., but the past few times I have been going to the gym I have been getting the most pulsating head-aches.  They literally feel like someone knocked me out with a hard blow to the lower, left back of the head (the occipital lobe area) then lately even when I am not working out I get these random dizzy spells to the point where I grab on to things and let my eyes go black for just a few seconds then they refocus.

I am a physical therapy student and I just sent my teacher and e-mail on what she might think (she has her PhD in PT-but she always takes forever to respond).

I have wondered this the past week, *ehem* *cough* stumbled across a few porn clips off of "Files" something like that and I wondered, since there are so many females doing this and seems a quick way to earn some good money, I even know of a girl I used to hang with who lived a city away who is in it now, very surprising, but then again, her whole family was strange along with the strange incestuous amongst her and her sisters and tat of her brothers name, weird. Anyways, I wondered, aren't they afraid of contracting a disease? Media has sure scared me of even having sex with a condom, I mean, since girls at young ages have sex it supposedly makes it more likely for them to contract that weird HPV sh**, I read its hard to detect that early at all. Yet these women go about business without a care in the world. Some of them looked coked up, yikes.

20090220132000AAJzfvc	Health;Women's Health	Preferably Ladies; Having Sex for the first time?	so, I am friends with this guy.. We've been talking for a while, and I seriously can't stop fantasizing having sex with him. Like, I don't think I've had this much of a sex drive towards anyone. Its all I think and dream about. i'm one of his best friends, and I know everything about him, so I know I'd be safe. What he doesn't know is that i am madly falling in love with him. I think he feels the same way because he never wants to stop talking to me and always wants to make sure im happy and ok. He's a really sweet kid with a naughty side too. I know he would never hurt me.  But I am 15 years old. Should I have sex with him or not? I feel like I'm ready, but I'm worried about the first time feeling... Like, what goes on? How does It feel? and another reason why I want to have sex, is because I wan't my first time to be special (oh and it will be), and I want to pop my cherry now, so when i have sex in the future, it feels good. Please help.

20090220131828AAjyc1P	Health;Optical	What can I do so that my eye glasses not hurt my ears?	I have this thing where I hate glasses behind my ears.  I have really sensitive pressure points on the back of my ears especially my left ear.  I've tried the metal glasses and they hurt worse, so i got frames like sunglasses.  BUT they still bother my pressure points.  I got them loosened up, but it still hurts, and it is even worse loose, since when I look down they rub against my pressure points when it goes down.  I'm not picky, but I really can't take the feeling of anything behind my ears and it really does hurt.  I can't wear contacts either, since they said that my eyes are too sensitive to light and contacts bring more light into my eyes.  That's why I had to get transitioned glasses, so that it reduces the amount of light into my eyes.  I don't know what to do anymore, and I have had this problem ever since I was little.  It bothers me so bad it makes me want to cry.  It hurts even worse when I talk I can feel it moving around my pressure points and it hurts me.  After I take my glasses off my pressure points are in pain for a while until they feel a little bit better again.

BUT my heels are pretty small.  So, when I get shoes that are nines, since my heels are so small, they just slip right out of them.  I got those little inserts that you can put in your shoe so that your heels don't slip out, but mine still do.  The only shoes that I can wear are tennis shoes.  I can't wear dressy shoes either.  One foot is smaller than the other (you can't tell by looking) so if I wear dressy shoes that will fit one foot, my other foot slips out of it.  Is the only solution to have shoes custom made for my type of feet?

I would like to some input on what this might be and what I can do to relieve the pain and concentrate long enough to get some of my school work done.
