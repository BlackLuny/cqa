YnNhr3eIaa	I have stayed at the Riu Palace in Playacar on 2 occasions. I found the group there to be 40's and up. The nightlife is pretty cruise ship level. I will say that the property is great and the food is unbelievable. If you go to this one you can walk to 2 other Riu properties. One has a disco but when we went there was no one there. You may want to investigate resorts in the Caribbean like Sandals, Couples, Grand Lido, or maybe even Hedonism. What I would recommend is that you go to an adult only resort. I hate dealing with a large number of kids. <br>  And, the Riu in Playacar is within walking distance of Playa Del Carmen which has some shopping and nightlife.
URO3gDXcaa	most places will not rent a car to anyone under 21.  i think since you are in school you can do estimates yourself.

It has its benefits, with space & land & No  neighbors so close as to bother  each other with out door activities. But close enough to still be neighborly. It has a few negatives , like if you need something, it is  quite  a drive to get  it. & Friends inside  the  town limits  think it  to far  to just  drop by.

aIZfiU6Kaa	If your medication is in the hold luggage, security would use sniffer dogs as well as X-rays so you will have no problems.<br>  <br>  If you need medication during your flight you should have it in your hand luggage and in a clear bag so that security can see it, especially if it contains more than 125ml of liquid or paste and you should declare it, it would also be advisable to have the prescription or your doctor's letter to go with it.<br>  Source(s):<br>  Ex London Airport Security Guard.|`|818a6c4a96262d3d9669cd5c91b5efaeaa	There are absolutely NO restrictions against you taking your medications with you.See site below and scroll down to the 2 column list to see that medications are allowed.It is best to keep them,or at least a few days worth of them in your carry-on, just in case your checked luggage is lost or delayed.|`|3tuwWidiaa	Never put medication in checked luggage.  Always put in carry-on.  If, for no other reason, this means that your medication won't get delayed or lost.<br>  <br>  If you must put in checked luggage, then you do risk it being pulled out for drugs.  Make sure to carry with you any documentation of prescriptions.  If it's over the counter medication, keep it in the original containers, if possible.  Keep in mind that drug sniffing dogs don't go after Advil or other similar drugs.<br>  <br>  However, if you followed the advice and didn't check it, you simply pull the medication from your carry-on and "declare" it at the security checkpoint.  This is required in many places, anyway, particularly for liquids or injectables.  The security agent (TSA in the United States) will look at it.  They will ask for copies of prescriptions.  Be aware that a prescription is required for liquids exceeding the limits and for all injectables or other medications requiring unusual devices.  You cannot bring OTC cough syrup, for example.  Which brings us back to the one reason why you might need to check.<br>  <br>  At worst, you'll require extra security screening.  However, there is usually nothing to worry about.  As I said, they know the difference between Advil and someone smuggling cocaine.|`|EnfChrwXaa	I'm not sure if this is a serious question or not - but - I never put medication in my checked in luggage, always take it in my carry-on bag.  For the prescription drugs I make sure I've also got a copy of a repeat prescription with me; this is me being OCD because if I get rushed into hospital whilst I'm abroad at least they can see what drugs I take on a regular basis (there's a lot of them!!) But it could also be used to prove that the medication is genuine.|`|Y5IUse1vaa	Unless you are carrying something illegal, you should keep your pills in your hand luggage. It's fairly easy to explain what they are for. If you pop your pills into your suitcase, you might spend a good while opening up your luggage and sorting out your pills.. You should always keep any medication in your handluggage anyway. This ensures that if your case goes missing(which is rare), you still have your pills to hand...|`|541b478967f8de1e9dea3a24f681ef62aa	yep, do NOT ever put medication in your suitcase, Always carry it on!<br>  <br>  now, make sure that your rx is allowed wherever you're going...you don't want a nasty surprise in Dubai, for example|`|ZHm0807kaa	Just put it in there, people take medicine abroad all the time.<br>  Being diabetic, I take loads of medicine and tons of needles, my suitcase has been scanned and they don't mind, just take a prescription if your worried.|`|GOYk4SYqaa	as long as the bottle has your name on it and keep it safe in a zip lock bag your good if its just over the counter stuff they dont care, i had a bottle filled of by back medicine in someone elses bottle and they never checked me|`|4277201b67af194037740747ba2be513aa	You can phone the airline and ask their advice. <br>  <br>  Remember that some legitimate prescription drugs such as codeine is still illegal in some places around the world - such as Saudi Arabia.|`|AA11101806	it's different for legal  prescription medications that you are allowed to possess.
Y5IUse1vaa	This is totally out of your hands. You can add huge pictures on your case, fancy ribbons and sticky labels that you can recognise. If the airport buffs send your case to the wrong place, there is nothing you can do about it!! I always put labels, stickers, bells, whistles and bows on my case. However, if it is lost in transit, I have to wait until it arrives at some poor souls house, they open it and find my address in it, then I have the chance to get it back...|`|UVUYG5jaaa	lost luggage is becoming a thing of the past with bar codes and airport codes. there is really nothing you can do|`|AA11496012	Since many people use black color luggage, what you can do is tie a bright colored ribbon to distinguish your suitcase from someone else's. <br>  <br>  At the ticket counter, verify that the ticket agent put in the correct flight number and airport code on the strip that goes around your luggage.  If the ticket agent enters the wrong airport code, your luggage may end up at a better destination than you.<br>  <br>  Sometimes lost luggage is beyond your control if for example your arriving flight is late and you only have 10 minutes to connect to your next flight.  There is a good chance your luggage will not make it.|`|EJpiaCMQaa	The only way you can be abolutely sure your luggage doesn't get lost is to take only a carry-on bag with you and put everything in it.  I do this every trip I take so I don't have to worry about lost luggage.  Plus, I don't have to spend a good deal of time waiting at the baggage carousel at the airport waiting for my luggage.  It's very easy to do, because I only put take what I absolutely need with me on my trip.  Travelling light has many advantages.  <br>  <br>  When I used to check my luggage, I always had luggage tags.  I would never consider travelling without them.  I know many people who have had lost luggage, but the airlines have always found their luggage and returned the luggage to its owners.<br>  <br>  One thing I can tell you if you still want to check in bags is to make sure the airline employee who checks in your luggage sends it to the right airport.  Check and see what airline code tag he/she puts on your luggage and ask them where you luggage is going just to confirm.|`|3tuwWidiaa	Check you bag only at the counter and not at the curb or with a skycap.<br>  <br>  When they put the sticker on the handle of your bag, look at it to ensure it has your name, your flight number, and the correct destination airport.  If you're flying through another city, make sure each layover is listed.<br>  <br>  Make sure they put your bag on the belt, or whatever is available for your airport.  If they put it next to the belt, ask why.<br>  <br>  Make sure that your bag is securely closed.  Use a TSA-approved lock, if your bag does not otherwise close.<br>  <br>  Put a note inside the bag with your name, phone number, and address.  If you carry a cell phone, make sure it says that.  If not, put contact information at your destination or the name/phone number of someone who can reach you (a relative or friend at home).<br>  <br>  Put this same information in a luggage tag on the outside of the bag.  Get a strong luggage tag made of hard plastic with a quality strap to attach it.  Do not use the airline's paper tags, except as a supplement.<br>  <br>  Other than that, there's little you can do.  Most luggage gets delayed or lost, not because of any of the above issues, but because it simply didn't make the flight.  Or because the barcode was misread (it happens).  Or because a human being misread something and sent the bag on the wrong flight.<br>  <br>  Luggage rarely totally gets lost.  Usually, it's simply delayed.|`|818a6c4a96262d3d9669cd5c91b5efaeaa	Seesitebelow.|`|GOYk4SYqaa	Yes of course, only bring carry ons you can carry pretty big carry ons my family of 4 went to washington D.C for a week and the three of us cause i had an infant had a carry on bag, and duffle bags fit the most stuff|`|he5HzEweaa	put something like a bow or something really bright on it so you know its yours!|`|aDQCs2yAaa	pop ur name and address etc on a piece of paper on top inside ur luggage
wOA2Mf6Naa	I was there from mid november last year to end of january this year. I spent 110000 peso all in all . I think that is 2400$ , but I rented two rooms in a boarding house (3100 peso a month electricity and water included). In this money is also sustaining my wife , her sister and my son. The birth of my son in a private hospital and medicine for my mother in law. So 3000$ should easy get you thru the three months if you live a simple lifestyle.|`|yh2hr3Vfaa	If you want to live simply, but with some degree of comfort for starters I recommend going to a smaller city like Iloilo or Bacolod. Your money will go 1/3 farter in a small city vice a big one like Cebu or Manila.<br>  <br>  Finding a short term furnished 1br house or apartment is difficult and definately wil be more than P10,000 per month. You need to know that while yes you can rent a 2 br house/apartment here for P8,000 a month it is unfurnished and does not include utilities. Same for boarding house rooms and they are generally not in the nicest of areas for a foreigner to be staying.<br>  <br>  Your best bet is to stay in a Pensione house. They are like a motel 6. Most will give a 10% discount for weekly advance pays in cash. The nicer ones with hot water shower and private bath, ac and catv cost roughly P15,000 ($300) a month. If you only want a fan room they are cheaper.<br>  <br>  If you eat at native BBQ places and calderitas (mom and pop roadside resturants) You can get away with spending $5 to $6 a day, maybe less. So figure on the high side $180 a month. <br>  <br>  So figure on $ a minimum of $500 per month for a place to stay, food and basic toiletry needs. <br>  <br>  You'd need some budget for entertainment. As long as you stay away from the Karoke bars with the GRO's another $150 or so would give you movies, bowling and a few beers once in awhile and some taxi/trike/jeepney fare.<br>  <br>  So altogether living with some degree of comfort $650 minimum a month X 3 months is $1,950 and tou will need a 59 day visa extension that cost's roughly $60 if you do it yourself.|`|l5B0KXSXaa	Firstly you need to decide where you will live because the further you are from the cities the cheaper things get. The second issue is cost of rents, I pay P3,000 per month for a 1 bedroom house which is fairly new in construction. I know of other people paying P8,000+ for a 2 - 3 bedroom and if you go for a sub-division house expect to pay P15,000+<br>  Electricity and water will be around P3,000 per month for the two. Transportation is cheap if you use the jeepneys taxi fares soon add up quickly. Eating out is cheap depending on what you live on. Currently me,my wife and our daughter live on P15,000 to P20,000 per month comfortably. For more info go to the website below but there are a lot of people living here  on budgets between $500 and $2000 a month. But you can survive on a lot less comfortably.|`|5EPwDjt8aa	I would say $3,000 would be good enough unless you like the high life.<br>  Rent is low here and if you eat local foods, that will be low cost too, but it could be dangerous too, so be careful where you eat.<br>  Also, things other than rent are NOT low cost here, they are the same and even higher than in the States in many cases.<br>  Most things are imported here, causing the high cost.<br>  It wouldn't be bad, but they over export here and have to buy so many things back just to supply their needs.|`|0VHlnNpiaa	Bring 5 with you and have 5 in reserve. It's cheaper there but not as cheap as you would think. Believe me when I say that plans go to hell once your there becuase you just end up having to much fun. Either way budget as much as you can and whack 5 grand on top because its just that kinda place where money burns. Best place ever though!|`|PN7XMglOaa	I would estimate $ 8000|`|6a7UKZVAaa	I know someone who when to Indonesia or Taiwan, I don't remember - but the two countries are somewhat similar, anyway he said he would only need 5$ a day for all his meals, a 3 or 4 star hotel and a planned event like scuba diving or motorcycling. I that's amazing, but if you only want to go to the Philippines just rrememberit's not a vey expensive country and you'll need to calculate the cost of food, transportation and lodging every day. =)|`|j8i4kSEDaa	I'm philipino (half) and we have a house over in the philippines and vacation there alot. <br>  <br>  Honestly I can't give you an exact number, but it won't be very much. But beware, if it's obvious you're an american, they will try to scam you by charging you more, in taxi rides, they'll take you around in circles in order to raise the bill. <br>  <br>  Don't fall for it, bargain down EVERYTHING that you can, and watch out when you're riding taxis. :)

A lot of this depends on what region you're going to.  I'm going to guess you're headed to S?o Paulo or Rio. In this case, it's generally sunny and 75 degrees.  They speak Portuguese as a general language but there are a few places they still speak native languages.  As for traditional clothing, this depends on the region as well. Sorry that this is so general but, this is an amazing country, and the culture is so varied that it's hard to answer this more directly.

jLTDqVHsaa	Check the laws of Idaho and Florida.<br>  <br>  Some states allow their permit drivers drive out of state, but some do NOT!  Also, some states allow out-of-state permit drivers, but others don't.  Check with the motor-vehicle departments of Idaho, then Florida, to see what their rules are.  If you have to call them, do so.<br>  <br>  But do be careful; upon researching, I have found some states that don't allow their learners to drive out of state.  I have also found some states that don't allow out-of-state learners.  I do not remember if Idaho and Florida have such rules, so the only way to be sure is to contact their motor vehicle departments.  Don't accept any other answer without concrete proof.|`|AA11404742	As long as it's valid at home, and you follow the local laws when you're there, and you meet the Florida rules to drive.  For example - if Idaho issues a driver's license at age 16, but Florida requires driver's to be 17, my guess is that you're still illegal.  You should also comply with any restrictions on your Idaho license as far as wearing glasses/contacts.  And stick to vehicles you're legally able to operate - ie, if you don't have a motorcycle endorsement or commercial driver's license, don't ride bikes or drive big trucks.|`|GvuMyMFOaa	It should be find as long as you follow the rules; have a licensed driver in the car, etc.|`|db4202a2e9fbae3dd80c2a1dcd903253aa	fur suree dear<br>  just follow the rules and you wil be finee

AA10478980	Generally you don't need to book the ferry to the Dry Tortugas in advance.  Just check it out when you get here.  Since you are visiting in March, I don't think it will matter a great deal if you choose the weekend or during the week, since March is a busy time here - height of the tourist season and also spring break time for some people.  The weekend may be a little busier, but in reality how busy it gets in Key West depends on how many cruise ships are in port, not so much on the day of the week.  We are getting more cruise ships than usual this year.<br>  <br>  As you drive down from Miami you'll see lots of interesting things along the way.  If you like nature and the outdoors I'd suggest that you stop in the Homestead/Florida City area and visit Everglades National Park.  It would take a day for sure to do that well.  You can camp at Flamingo, and it is primitive camping - no electricity, water hook-up, etc.  We were there on the weekend, and it looked like there was plenty of space.  The park itself offers several walking and hiking trails, and access to a couple of lakes for boating, canoeing, kayaking.  You might be interested in the Alligator Farm in the Homestead area, where you can also take an airboat ride.  The farm visit, including the boat ride, costs about $22 per person, and is well worth it.  To see all their demonstrations and to do the ride would take about half a day.<br>  <br>  Parking can be a problem in Key West, so rent the smallest car you can manage with.  Driving can be hazardous here because there are so many tourists driving rented golf carts and riding rented bicycles and of course, they don't know the town, so they often are uncertain about where they are going.  And they are on vacation, and are probably a little more relaxed than when at home.  And the streets in Old Town are narrow.<br>  <br>  When you get here, if you want to find out what you might like to do, take a tour on the Old Town Trolley the first day you are here.  Take the trolley, not the train, as the trolley is a much better deal.  The tour lasts for an hour and a half, and is fully narrated.  You'll learn a lot about our island, and may get some ideas about other things to do.<br>  <br>  One thing I would recommend is the star gazing evening on the schooner the Western Union.  You'll find it at the waterfront.  Ask any of the trolley company employees at Mallory Square and they will direct you to it.  The evening is conducted by an astronomer and is quite interesting.<br>  <br>  Enjoy your visit here.|`|b8e17f565936253241a343443917ca6baa	We were there a few years ago for our 10th wedding anniversary.  We took the ferry out to Dry Tortugas (which at that time I think ran about $125 each) and spent the day there exploring the fort and snorkeling.  (The ferry ticket included a picnic lunch and all the gear.)  I don't think we bought tickets ahead of time.  We just showed up early that morning and got them before we boarded. - - - Are you sure you're allowed to camp there?

0pM85b5Baa	Moonrise gave you a good answer. <br>  It's allowed by law to have till 4 wives at the same time. It's not common if we speak by real numbers not by TV serials and movies. It's by Islamic rules and it should be in certain conditions and the man should be very fair to treat his wives in equal way in everything including nice words, presents, care ..etc. <br>  The first wife has the choice to get a divorce or to be the first wife with certain rights in both cases. I believe this rule was not for the entertainment of men. It's a rule to solve many problems in the society that God knows about it. Woman in Egypt has very good rights law as far as I know. Treatment is not something easy to measure but in general I think they treated well comparing to what I know in many other countries. <br>  In Arab countries, it can be different. There is no rule goes for all, but most Arab countries allow more than a wife for the man by law. Also I think it's allowed {by Islam} that the ruler can stop this rule for a certain time if he found it useful for the society. God knows better if my last point is true or not according to Islam, but I think it's found in Islam to stop applying certain rules if it's useful of the society similar to the theft punishment when poverty spreads in a society. The punishment can be lower. Same goes to the multi wives rule if the society for example need it.|`|hhhk499qaa	No there are a lot of men then married again in Egypt. Some even marry 5.

But Man are not real with that I mean if the wife says no then he will threaten her with divorce.

ORjH7TD1aa	They totally both have great parts of them.  I first went to the Chattanooga aquarium when I was younger.  My fiance and I went there on the spur of the moment last fall and had a great time.  The TN aquarium is cheaper, and there are all types of amazing things to do when you are there that can be cheap also.  We also went to Lookout Mountain and rode the Inclined Railroad.<br>  <br>  I live in Atlanta, about 5 minutes from the aquarium.  The aquarium in Atlanta is definitely better.  It has more to do and takes longer to go through.  I really enjoy the parts that allow you to touch different things in different environments.  Atlanta is also more expensive, as are the things to do around it.  If money isn't an issue, I would definitely suggest you come to Atlanta, but if it is TN is also a great choice.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|91SFoU14aa	I would definitely go with the georgia aquarium!!!

Georgia has whales and sharks.|`|F9EvPa1Uaa	Georgia aquarium because there's a 3-d movie there,  in one part of the aquarium you can see the beligum whales, and in another part you can see the fish if you look on top, their are shopping centers, and food restraunts in there.|`|AA11580836	I live here in Tennessee and havde not been to the one here, however I have heard it is not all that, whereas I have been to the Georgia Aqaurium and I definately recommend it to anyone for sure!

Hope this helps, have fun!|`|KJ0P79n8aa	Georgia is so much better.<br>  In the Tennessee one, you get to pet some really gross fish in a tiny little round tank. In the Georgia one, you get to pet EVERYTHING! Baby sharks, sting rays, shrimp, urchins, starfish, crawfish. It's really hands on.<br>  Georgia is also really really good if you are bringing children. I recommend the Deepo4D thing, even without children. It's pretty cute.|`|7k8iwvvOaa	I have been to both and the georgia aquarium rocks over the chattanooga aquarium.  It is a hugh aquarium for starters and the people working there are wonderfully informed and courteous.  <br>  <br>  I wrote an article about the Beluga Whales at the Georgia Aquarium.

kgBPU4xxaa	It depends on where you are. In Florence, the Fiorentina is great if you're a steak eater. I often go for lunch on the weekends for the Ribollita. For dessert, go with the cantucci & vin Santo. If you're anywhere near Mantova, try the stracotto d’asino with polenta. Along the coast, there are lots of good places for fish. Branzino can be very good, but it's often pricy. Here in Emilia Romagna, there are tons of good pasta. Try the tortelli di zucca preferably with burro e salvia, but the ragu is pretty good too. In this area, the tortellini in brodo is also great. Prosciutto, parmegiano reggiano cheese and a good balsamic vinegar are also a must.|`|aXqi9lYJaa	Mmmm pizza.

Yum, wow, I'm trying not to eat right now and you got me all hooked on Italys awesome foood|`|1Vih78dZaa	It's a fact that you'll hardly ever get a bad meal in Italy. The Italians treat food far too seriously for any restaurant that doesn't produce good meals to remain in business long, so as long as you stay away from real "touristy" places, you should have an interesting time in food terms.<br>  <br>  One thing that not people outside of Italy understand is that there is really no such thing as "Italian food". What you'll actually find if you travel around and eat in restaurants serving the locals is that what's available varies a lot depending on where in the country you are.<br>  <br>  If you are touring the country, you'd be wise to ask what the local specialities are when you're in a restaurant. Some dishes are an acquired taste, but it's always interesting and usually tasty.<br>  <br>  However, something you definitely do need to try while you're here is Italian pizza. Not because it's fantastically wonderful (in my opinion, it's normally no more than okay), but just so you can know what a load of BS is spouted by pizza places outside of Italy who call the things they serve "Authentic Italian" or "Italian Style" pizzas.<br>  <br>  If you want a real laugh, you could try asking in an Italian pizzeria for a "stuffed crust" pizza or whatever is the most recent abomination the Pizza Hut marketing people have come up with.|`|sHuC3r8Zaa	one thing i loved was fresh mozzarella.  it was served almost everywhere.  normally it is served with lettuce and tomato.  <br>  <br>  its known to some as the national dish of italy.  the colors Red (tomato), White (Cheese), Green (lettuce) are the colors in the italian flag, and also included in this spectacular dish|`|rGQxgV1faa	deffinitely try:<br>  <br>  - lasagna<br>  - tiramisu<br>  - any pasta but bolognese is pretty good<br>  <br>  but any food in italy is great|`|sh6CZ3Ejaa	Pizza!!!!<br>  Eat one for me!|`|a9jMOJeHaa	there are lot of variety of food you need more than one life to try all.everywhere you go they make traditional -local food-..just eat as much as you can and enjoye.I live in rome for 18 year and now move to usa and miss italian food like crazy but in my 18 years travelling around italy i didnt finish to try all typical food.there there are all kind of pasta i guess more than 100 kind,not like usa just know as spaghetti meatball,chicken alfredo(we dont have that in italy )and lasagna.we have spaghetti boscaiola,tortellini alla romana,spaghetti alla amatriciana-carbonara.pasta al pesto,linguine all;astrice-scoglio-pescatora,rigatoni more and more and those are just first dishes.....|`|224a7eaaf46eec4d949ffc56fb6e1c6faa	try everything italian - stay away from fast food chains - pizza, pasta, meat - depends also on the season you go, in the summer lots of tomatoes adn bruschettas, ---   not to compare with what we have in the states|`|YzhZCs3Naa	ah....gelatos! yum! <br>  <br>  <br>  for a great drink......try limoncello! it's a wonderful lemon liquor.

f4759393d980deadc3255b5837265f76aa	I'll admit to being biased but I'd have to say NYC.  There is TONS to do and see.  And the flight from the UK to NYC is half that to LA.<br>  How long would depend on how much time you have and how much you and to spend.  You could spend a month in  NYC and still have things to see.  A week at least though would be good.  Depending on what time of year you intent to travel there will be different options (ie. winter - Christmas in Manhattan is truly excellent or summer - you could take the train out to the Hamptons for a day or 2 of relaxation and tanning on the beach)|`|AA10930398	If you've been to Disney World you probably don't want to go to Disney land....I wouldn't think.Disney land is older. Universal park and all the other attractions are so similar,with the rides and all. Are you from the US? Maybe the time of year might help you decide. I think a full week gives you plenty of time to see attractions. Inbetween you can relax if you want...two days are spent traveling. It depends on what type of places you want to spend your time at and how far apart they are.How about middle America? Utah, the Grand Canyon? New Orleans?
SjAewiyMaa	You can get some good deals in the Village (used clothing, handbags, etc.) or in Midtown on 34th St/8th Ave. there are some cheap stores like Conways, but you'll want to avoid most of Midtown/Times Square if you're on a budget. You can also buy admission to most attractions or a New York Pass (as the other poster suggested) online at a decent discount on the New York City Tourist Center website:<br>  <a href="http://www.nyctouristcenter.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.nyctouristcenter.com</a> There's also a section for free things to do in New York City.|`|8cf66894663c74e69b5ed17db7228d97aa	Get your sightseeing in and get around the city by buying a 2 day ticket (they will include the Empire State Building and Statue of Liberty) on the red dbl decker buses. It was the best deal I found. You get the info, can go just about anywhere (Manhattan) and get to see alot. See the empire state building-early-like at opening at 8-8:30 AM-then go straight thru to Statue and Battery Park. as you ride you can see other places like China Town and the Twin Tower site and Financial district (the police and fireman museum there, the shipping docks down on the water nearby -good food there in food court) Ride over to the Central Park area and you can hike all over to the museums and such-great day. Eat in the museum lunchrooms and at the food carts you see everywhere. Food costs the most! If you get the ticket for the bus route that includes evening ride-do it to see Times Square at night-get off and cruise around. Taxis are at every corner if you ever get stuck and we took a taxi from the airport to the hotel near the Empire State Building-it was about 50.00 but worth it as we were bushed after a 10 hr. flight! Go on Yahoo travel and you can check areas and maps and reviews of hotels-and costs-then you can book direct with the hotel.<br>  Forget! You will see guys in red on corners selling the bus tickets and many of the hotels sell them too.|`|f8aa8e21997cfa7908574dfa12f124cdaa	My friend, please do check the answer below.<br>  <br>  Thank you and good luck<br>  Native New Yorker|`|lqXmvJdRaa	New York is a big city.

Spring breakers are making trips, parents are taking kids of out school between spring break and Easter weekend, and the International Flower and Garden Festival kicks off on March 18th at Epcot.<br>  <br>  The parks will probably be crowded, but they won't be jam packed like during the summer months.    Utilize the FastPass whenever possible.  And if you have a hopper, go to the park that is having the Extra Magic Hours (if you are staying at a Disney hotel) only during those EMH's and head to a different park for the majority of your day.  People with a Base ticket flock to the park with the EMH because it means they can play longer.  So, if you only have a Base ticket I would avoid the EMH park... but that's just me.<br>  <br>  Also, keep in mind that although the economy is bad now, many people book their Disney vacation a year in advance.  I'm going in May and I booked (and paid for) mine back in June... so I'm going despite how the economy is.|`|GXx7WwRYaa	its a yes or no anwer??<br>  YES, it will be crowded do to Spring Breakers from all over the world.<br>  <br>  NO, it will not be crowded because although it will be SB the economy is bad.<br>  <br>  So, who knows until your trip?  anyways have a great trip and its just around the corner.  be sure to make restaurant reservations ASAP.|`|aVGj9yVfaa	no that's when spring break is for colleges the best time to go is october, november, december and january i have been going since i was 4 trust me this is the time to go.

g05wGcPhaa	As of right now it's nearly impossible to find a job especially in Miami Dade County. The unemployment rate right now in South Florida has reached 8.1% since December 08 , higher than the national unemployment rate of 7.6%. So that means 752,000+ are jobless right now. In the tri-county area, Palm Beach County had the highest unemployment rate, with 7.8 percent, followed by Miami-Dade, with 7 percent, and Broward, with 6.8 percent. Most companies are cutting jobs right now so it's going to be quite hard for you to find a job because now you have to compete with a whole bunch of people who probably want the same position.<br>  <br>  You cannot just move to the United States and expect to get a job like that. The United States in in a deep recession. 1 in 11 Americans are out of work and looking for a job. Even if you wanted to move here and find a job you would be required to have a work visa and if someone hired you and you cannot show proof that your legal then they will fire you in a heartbeat. <br>  <br>  Recently Miami Dade County was hiring 35 Firefighters. More than a thousand (1,000) literally waited and camped out just to get that job. Out of those 1,000+ only 35 of them got the job.<br>  <br>  Today in Davie there is job fair going on right now. Hundreds of job seekers hoping to get into the job fair to talk to about three dozen employers are waiting in a line that's stretching around the block and across a parking lot. Now thats some serious stuff. That's how bad thing are right now.<br>  <br>  To get to the point. It's better if you stay where you are now. Most likely if you come here you will be so stressed and jobless that you will end up back where you came from.|`|A7cWzCmpaa	is that a joke? yesterday over 6000 people showed up for a job fair and maybe 25% will get a job.  first thing they ask is do you have a visa to work in the US and those are not easy to get either.  my advice is stay put where you are till things get better.

AA10139908	Chakanaab Park (sp?) is a great place to go.  You can cab there easily or do it as an excursion.  Some of the excursions go to Discover Mexico - a six year old will not appreciate it at all - my nieces (7 & 10) did not.  They did love Chakanaab.  Chakanaab has snorkeling and a nice sandy area - not a beach.  There are snack bars, restaurants, etc. and they also do a Dolphin interaction thing ($).  Not sure what the fee is for the park itself, but not bad and we had a very nice day there.  Incidentally we found the convenience store inside the park sold cold cerveza for ~$1.50 while the waiters who come to your chairs want $4...

Besides that, most jobs will require that you have native level Japanese. So what is your job field ? Also realize your co-workers will be Japanese.And most Japanese don't speak English.|`|5b37795563969b19352fc16bf286b0a0aa	I hope you're a doctor, brain surgeon, rocket scientist, micro-biologist, because Japan doesn't need too many Americans working for them unless you have a very special degree.<br>  <br>  Most Japanese companies would choose an incompetent Japanese before a decent American.

With international air travel, there are usually several options for how to get there, more stops = less expensive, fewer stops = more expensive. For example, flying United you could have 1 stop in LAX; two stops - Denver then LAX; two stops - Denver then San Francisco; two stops - Chicago then San Francisco.

1d718ff96585004e8d1e8bc312c3655daa	It's going to be cold - like, probably really cold.  It's RIGHT on the beach, and we've got upper-30s weather now.  So don't expect to stroll the boardwalk.<br>  <br>  There's a lot more to do in CI in the summer - walk the board, go to Nathan's visit Keyspan Park, even though it is pretty pathetic, lol.  The aquarium is alright, it's nothing particularly amazing though.  I used to go when I was in high school pretty often, but I haven't been in like four years - I can't imagine much has changed. <br>  <br>  It's very easy to get there by train - take the D, F, B, Q or N all the way to the end of the line.  The station is accessible, and right across the street is the majority of Coney Island "attractions."<br>  <br>  Leave before it gets late and dark - it starts to get (for lack of a better phrase) ghetto.  I lived in Seagate, a gated, mostly Russian community that's within Coney Island but locks out all the creeepers, and it's not a fun area to walk around by yourself at night, or even with a boyfriend.<br>  <br>  Honestly, if I were you, I would wait until it gets warmer - if you don't have ANYTHING else to do, take the train ride out.  If you do, skip it - besides Nathan's (their dogs are amazing, as are their french fries), there's not much else to keep you here.<br>  <br>  Good luck and have fun!|`|bQraDPLUaa	The aquarium is cool, but Coney Island is essentially shut down right now, it will probably be a pretty cold and barren place.<br>  <br>  "Coney Island is a seasonal center operating roughly between Easter and Labor Day.

AA12112773	Personally I DETEST the bus! i would not advise it to anyone but maybe a teenager and then im skeptical! <br>  I would definitely opt for the train- my experiences for the most part have been great *aside 4 seat sharing - which u and ur fam wont have to do*. Schedule as far in advance as possible for the best rates. Bring your own snacks - as they tend to be pricey on the train- meals are decent - and also prob would be a good experience for the kids! <br>  Hotels - i would google that and see the best rates for your dates and it will give u a chance to compare hotels and the location of them- look for virtual tours.<br>   Oh sorry! now i see 3 adults not children..well 1 of you MAY be seated with someone for part of the ride..which isn't always a horrible thing! :)|`|2z4pOtYkaa	I recommend Mega Bus. I heard that they provide good service from Chicago to New York for a VERY reasonable price ($10 and under per person)! For the hotel, check around.

AA11280367	The tiny islands of the Mamanuca Group west of Viti Levu have the beaches and reefs you seek, plus lots of water sport activities. They're all easily accessible from Nadi Airport by fast catamaran several times a day. Which island resort you choose could depend on your budget and who you are. If you're under 35, you might like Beachcomber, Bounty, South Seas, Funky Fish, or Walu Beach resorts. If you're taking along the kids, Castaway, Treasure, Plantation, or Malolo resorts may be for you. Romantic couples will prefer Matamanoa, Tokoriiki, or Wadigi where children are not accepted at all. Those in search of the finest accommodations regardless of price could take an overwater bungalow at Likuliku Lagoon. Choose your resort carefully as they all have a slightly different character.

Yc3XR6Thaa	The biggest difference between Canada and the UK? TREES!<br>  <br>  Having lived in both the UK and Canada (where I live now) I can say that while there are a lot of similarities there are also a number of differences.<br>  <br>  First off, it's cheaper to live in Canada for the most part. Places like Vancouver can be very pricey, but most of Canada is pretty affordable. Houses are roughly half the cost of those in the UK. Petrol is half the price you're paying in the UK.<br>  <br>  A downside to Canada is that it can be too darn big. If you don't live in major city like Toronto or Montreal and you like to see big name concerts you're going to have to drive for hours, or fly, just to get to the venue.<br>  <br>  It's generally much colder in Canada in the winter, but our summers tend to be a bit hotter than in the UK. You have midges, we have mosquitoes and horse flies. You kinda get used to them after a while :)<br>  <br>  The cultures can be pretty different in several ways, but nothing that would shock you too much. We love beer, but so do the Brits :) We bbq a LOT, you not so much.  <br>  <br>  I love both countries and I think it would be a great experience for you to work here, at least for a while.
Q3RqWHFsaa	Have you looked all anime made in Japan? Or least  how many anime made in Japan have you ever seen before?<br>  <br>  The most of all Japanese anime broadcasted in Japan have sort of features like mostly not Caucasian but typical Asian looking girls with big eyes.<br>  <br>  Try to take a look at the site for rreference <br>  <a href="http://www.gyao.jp/tag/?keyword_id=6964&page=1&disp_type=1&sort=1" rel="nofollow">http://www.gyao.jp/tag/?keyword_id=6964&...</a><br>  <br>  If you are just staying out of Japan to see Made-in Japan Anime on broadcasting, it is because of the location itself for distribution why so many Caucasian looking girls are seen mainly. <br>  <br>  The broadcasting on local market outside of Japan has nothing to do with general Japanese boy's taste or their tendency. It is based on market research for demand on the independent location each in the world.<br>  <br>  It is of course natural if they made some stories based on Western tale such as Grimm's fairy tales. The reason why Japan don't make any black girls anime is because there is no profitable market for them as business.<br>  <br>  It doesn't mean that Japanese boys are not into Black girls at all.<br>  <br>  I think even white or black or something else, healthy, pretty and kind girls are always mostlikely loved much better by everybody than ugly, fatty and stubborn ones in the world.|`|AA10662056	>why do anime girls resemble European/American/(White) girls so much?<br>  <br>  Because Japanese anime fans like it.<br>  <br>  >And do Japanese guys go crazy over white women in japan if they think they look like anime characters or something?<br>  <br>  Not necessarily white women. But girls with big eyes are popular among boys as another says.|`|5ZtSR0IQaa	I think you ask a good question, as it's often asked by westerners who watch anime. But before you can get a straight answer, you may want to be reminded that it's one of the questions that are consistently in the numerous anime FAQs out there. The answers range from an over-analyzing of Japanese psychology to accusing white America to expect the Japanese to draw Japanese characters with the same stereotypes they have of the Japanese.<br>  <br>  The Japanese roots go back to Osamu Tezuka and his inescapable influences on anime and manga. This is a subject worth more than a book, and if interest warrants it, you are encouraged to explore that.<br>  <br>  It is absurd to think that the Japanese would have the same kind of ideas as American about facial features that make a look Japanese. If you watch enough anime that takes place in contemporary Japan, you might eventually find a token white American character. They will have the Japanese notion of exaggerated features that make up a white American anime face that most American cartoonists and animators wouldn't draw.<br>  <br>  But that's for the academics. One of the immediate features that makes anime characters not look Japanese might be their hair color, which wouldn't be black. If I were a director, I would reject character designs that didn't look different enough on the first draft. If Ami had red hair and Mai had blue, those would be good codes to differentiate characters.<br>  <br>  Now, you have anime fans in Japanese who are stereotypically afraid to talk to real women. These aren't exactly the type of people who go crazy over real white women. But cosplayers would be an exception.|`|d2f1c9545ed4c110bb4a655ee098e488aa	When the Japanese watch anime, they see JAPANESE people, not white people (unless, I suppose, it's set in a foreign country). <br>  <br>  It's a bit of a grey area regarding whether or not the love for "big eyes" means a love for white girls. To some Japanese, that's exactly what it means, but other Japanese are surprised by the question. And not all Japanese want girls with big eyes, although many also think Koreans have eyes that are "too chinky/slanted". A lot of Japanese think Japanese eyes ARE big eyes, even though Westerners would disagree. I have heard each of these things from various Japanese people. I would say there are curiosities about foreigners (white or otherwise, because Latinas, black girls, Arabs, Indians, etc. also often have large eyes) among some men, just like every country, but I would not go as far as to say that most of them want white women, because most are content with Japanese women.|`|f2959c3466eb9458fc5521de90e563d3aa	That's what the customers want apparently. It must appeal to whoever's paying. White guys love asian girls - maybe it's just the exotic factor?|`|YeFt3IEUaa	Much of the market is in the U.S. as many young people are into the whole anime thing. I have no idea what Japanese guys think about white girls.|`|5b37795563969b19352fc16bf286b0a0aa	No, they are supposed to be Japanese girls.  But Japan, and most of the east, right now has an obsession with big eyes.  Not so much western eyes, but large eyes.<br>  <br>  You see a lot of Jpanese girls make their eyes bigger, they dont make them more American like Koreans and Chinese do.<br>  <br>  Girls like Magi-chan have big eyes, they ulzzang their eyes and men go crazy over it. <br>  <br>  It's not so much the white factor. Trust me, I am light-skinned and most Japanese men look me over without taking a second look.

With the closings of Shoe Pavilion, Linens-N-Things, Mervyns, and Circuit City (soon to be), it's going to be EVEN MORE difficult.<br>  <br>  You will also need about $10,000 to start off.<br>  <br>  Decent prices start at $1000 mo. for either an extremely small studio or a 1bd/1ba apartment if you're lucky. There is no such thing as $550 mo. here. A minimum waged job alone will barely pay the rent. Remember, you need to eat, you need water, gas, electric, personal hygiene, etc.<br>  <br>  Bottom Line: Look elsewhere.

rVUvopaLaa	visit your nearest District hospital if not a government training hospital.  speak to a pediatric consultant or resident.  Tell them about your circumstances.  at times there are pharmaceutical companies will offer free immunization and coordinate with them.    <br>  find out from your pediatrician the name of the pharmaceutical companies and you can write a letter to the marketing manager.  elaborate your personal and financial circumstances and make an appeal.  <br>  <br>  good luck|`|7ONAv4vYaa	At community health centers.<br>  <br>  Just inquire at your nearest barangay.<br>  <br>  I think some immunizations are not offered by the govt and some health centers don't have the one-shot immunization.|`|S2Wp2Vjsaa	Local health center, although you have to buy your own syringes and immunization vials, the total cost will be very low.|`|VGMFkcziaa	Baranggay Health Center is absolutely free of charge|`|ZSAbJEv6aa	You can get it free in any health center in your area.  Each barangay has one.  <br>  <br>  It isn't that I advocate expensive spending at this time but if you want your child to be as comfortable as much as possible and not contract fever after each immunization, I would advice you to stick to your child's pediatrician.  Also, there is no guarantee that the vaccines in health centers are not expired because there were reported cases where medicines/vaccines in said centers were already expired yet were still administered to patients.<br>  <br>  However, if as you said, you are financially incapable to provide your child the benefits of an expensive immunization,  I think there are government hospitals that provide free inoculation.  What you need is just buy the vaccine yourself and they will do the rest.  You may still spend but at least you are assured that the medicine is not expired.

NMcFF0Iwaa	My retired man has seen all 49 states on his motorcycle road trips. <br>  His main idea, find a motel by 6 p.m. or you may not find one.<br>  He likes motels with continental breakfasts so he can get back on the road.  <br>  If you are using a credit card for gas, etc., be sure to call them before leaving so they know you are traveling.  (My guy had his frozen at a  California gas station on his first ride).  He called me, I was home, I called the c.c. to get him released.  They said they had caller I.D. & since I was calling from my billing phone number they would release him.  <br>  Always know the weather, he got stuck in a bad hailstorm in upper Texas one year. (Try riding a motorcycle in 4 inches of hail).  <br>  If you have a digital camera, put in a large sim card for tons of photos. <br>  Plus the usual, he always took a small bottle of laundry soap.<br>  Maintain your wheels to be road worthy before leaving, even then odd things happen sometimes.<br>  He loved Alaska in early June, all of Montana & Glacier National Park for beauty & riding, & upper California redwoods.  He also enjoyed the coastal ride from Florida to Maine, taking the under ocean tunnel to New Jersey.  This year he is going to Nova Scotia, hear there is a road next to the water that circumferences the country. Next year, Hawaii. I love his road trips, I get a vacation at home.

znLzOCHlaa	No, but I flew on a domestic US Airways flight. Usually on Intenational flights, food and stuff is free, if the flight is during mealtimes. But it is 5$ for a fairly good snackbox with food and a drink on the domestic flights, and I didnt see anyone purchasing a blanket an a pillow that had one. <br>  <br>  They got pretty good service. I think to be a flight attendant on international flights you have to ba able to speak the language that the flight goes to and from.<br>  <br>  There may be delays, but that is based soely on the airport and the weather. You will expierence delays with all airlines, and it is never their fault.

Its an interactive technology museum. i forget the exact location but its near tiffanys, by 5th ave. actually then, close to the american girl store.<br>  <br>  i believe the ice skating rink at rockafeller center is still open? that's also near by, and quite good for children.<br>  <br>  broadway shows are great. like the lion king, or something similar. <br>  <br>  the american museum of natural history is great for children/tweens.<br>  <br>  the movie theater at lincoln center has 3D imax movies. i remember going there on school trips and loving them.<br>  <br>  if its a nice day, the bronx zoo is open all year round.<br>  <br>  take them out to dinner at a themed restaurant like jeckyl and hyde.|`|64966f431eb7c4148256720cef5f2654aa	Well, considering the 8 is a guest, and the 13 year old lives there, you should taylor it more to the 8-year-old's interests.<br>  <br>  Definitely a trip to FAO Scwartz, and maybe the children's museum of manhattan.<br>  <br>  You can google children's theatre new york to get a listing of many of the companies and their offerings.<br>  <br>  GoCityKids is a great place for ideas for family events.
XD6as6d9aa	I stayed at the Luxor on November of 2007. We had a great deal on a nonsmoking tower room deluxe. These rooms are larger than the pyramid rooms. The pyramid rooms can seem smaller than they really are due to the angled wall on one side. I had no problems with the service or cleanliness of the room. The walk to the tower rooms is slightly longer but not a big deal. I've heard nightmares about long lines for checking in but maybe I lucked out or something because we arrived in the afternoon and checked in without standing in line at all. I would stay there again but probably won't because I want to stay at a different hotel every time I'm in Vegas.|`|RfbpvqSWaa	I would stay there just to ride on the inclinators.  You will have a great time in Las Vegas.|`|dFBccLExaa	I've stayed there multiple times. I've only had one bad exp because I arrived super late, and had to stay in the Tower (those rooms are smoking rooms, and I'm not fond of smoke). So rule of thumb is arrive before 10pm lol. Other than that, thuogh, I've had nothing but good things to say about the Luxor. It's a very nice hotel, esp since they renovated the inside.|`|mldo1vxYaa	I have stayed there before and wouldnt again, theres nothing really wrong with it, I just found the rooms to be very dark and outdated, stayed in the pyramid and i thought the room would have been better.<br>  <br>  Also there is much better locations and compared to other hotels the luxor would be bottom of my list to be honest. The other hotels do their themes so much better than luxor, with the advantages of better rooms and a better location.|`|XwXuJIF8aa	I stayed there in 2003, 2004. It is a very nice place. Nice pool. Nice coffee shop and really good breakfast buffet. Convenient if you rent a car and want to travel, great access to the garage.<br>  You will enjoy it. As for ripping, someone probably did not get a kick back. <br>  The ex wife played slots and won some money, maybe $50 but she did not lose. <br>  You should be happy at this location|`|tQM0ufHoaa	Yeah folks on Trip Adviser are ripping it up pretty bad. I stayed at the Luxor once about 10 years ago and had no complaints. Sometimes it best to just see for yourself. Either that or get a refund and go next door the Mandalay.|`|dA4fXc4Zaa	I stayed there a couple of years ago and the room was just ok nothing special. We stayed in the pyramid and expected more. The view was of the airport and a bunch of the dirt.

AA10478980	Sloppy Joe's bar on Duval is one of the most popular ones.  Take an Old Town Trolley tour (fully narrated hour and a half tour) to get to see the whole island and to learn a little of its history, and after that tour you'll have a few ideas about what you'd like to do.  Walk Duval Street and you will see numerous bars, restaurants and stores.  Walk along the waterfront to see several possibilities for boat tours, including a tour in a glass bottomed boat.  Visit Kermit's on Greene St. for key lime pie.  Louie's Back Yard is a great restaurant.  Check out all the things to do at Mallory Square, including the sunset celebrations everyday.  If you're a fan of Jimmy Buffet check out Margaritaville on Duval.  Key West really is paradise.|`|WoeRTuzCaa	I went and took a catamaran trip to the middle of the gulf and went snorkeling, it was a blast.

ZSOxZFLbaa	Okay...I wouldn't even waste my time in Paris for less than 7 days (Including arrival, which can take up to a whole day, anyway!)  <br>  <br>  You need to work on your French spelling, too.  You'll learn that there, though.<br>  <br>  Versailles (a Palace, not a Chateau) is going to take up a whole day.  It's not in the city...it's truly a day trip.  <br>  <br>  La Place de la Concorde and the Champs Elysées should be doubled up with the Louvre...they are all connected.  And the Arc de Triomphe is on the other end of the Champs Elysées.<br>  <br>  A lot depends on what interests you.  And how much money do you have to spend.  If you are on a tight budget, a lot of wandering streets like the Champs Elysées, and the Quartier Latin, ?le de la Cité, etc. and just browsing through stores could keep you happy.  Eat at budget places, you'll be able to pick them out, because every restaurant posts their menu where you can read and check the prices.  Eat Crêpes at a cart on the street.  Shop at the open markets. Wander through the gardens and go by all the famous buildings and just take photos.  <br>  <br>  You missed N?tre Dame and Sacré Coeur.  Can't say you've been in Paris without going to the two top churches!  <br>  <br>  While at Sacré Coeur, wander about in the artist quarter of Montmartre, and then go into Montparnasse. <br>  <br>  Are you into Art?  Or will the Louvre be enough?  (I find art museums, especially, I can only take about 2 - 3 hours at a time...I get fatigued, and plan accordingly...you know your tolerance level - Listen to your body...you go over, you are wasting your time).  Modern Art:  Musée d'Orsay, L'Orangerie, and Jeu de Paume.  EEKS!  there are so many!  Those are the four that we plan to hit.  <br>  <br>  Into modern architecture?  go into La Défense after climbing the Tour Eiffel.  Check out the Grand Arc de la Défense.  <br>  <br>  Just walk up the Seine.  Browse through the antique stalls around the Cathedral.  Take a Bateau Mouche ride (or any of the boat cruises).<br>  <br>  I think you have enough for 5 days.<br>  <br>  Email me if you want a detailed itinerary for Spain....I can give you expert advice.  Where to go...what to eat...how many days have you planned per town?  I need that to know what to give you....everything but Valencia...you're on your own there.  Only time I was there, I was sick and spent the whole day in a hotel room.  But I know the other cities pretty well.|`|AA11835015	buy a transportation pass for paris. i forget (since 2000) if they have 3 or 5 day passes for all buses, metro, trams, funiculars, etc. they also have a 3-day discounted card for the eiffel tower, louvre, certain museums, arc de triomphe; all you can go to for 3 days, for one price. i think it was called an orange card.<br>  if you don't know french, at least try to greet others when you enter a shop, answer the shop assistants with "bon jour" or "bon soirre" (not spelled right!! sounds kinda like bon swa). i've read that they think foreigners esp. americans, are rude because they don't respond to greetings! many speak english, but not many!<br>  eat some croissants. chocolates and waffles in belgium. france, too, as far as that goes! all the food is so tasty in europe.<br>  amsterdam has boats like paris, on the river. at night, we walked the red light district, looked into hash bars (didn't try any) and saw some drunk guy (i swore he must have been american) dancing on a table, putting his bare rear-end on a plate glass window. i was afraid he could lose something if the glass broke. i was always at ease all night in amsterdam.<br>  haven't made spain, yet, but there are some incredible cathedrals there, too; if you're into the history. and like walking up 542 steps!<br>  enjoy!!

While there you can dip into Paraguay and Brazil just to say you visited.   You might as well take the ferry over Uruguay too.<br>  <br>  Catch some tango dancing, they invented it.  <br>  <br>  The Malbec wine of Medoza is cheap and fantastic.  Drink it everyday.   They drink Mate a lot, nothing special.<br>  <br>  Patagonia would be nice, but I didn't go there, I live in Colorado anyway so I don't think I'd be impressed.<br>  <br>  I wanted to go to Antarctica on a cruise, but I was too late.  March should be good for that.  Not many people have been there.<br>  <br>  I lived there 6 months, but I was working, not all tourism.

So, here are the 5 best places to go in Buenos Aires:<br>  <br>  #1 Plaza de Mayo:<br>  Became the most important political scenario of Buenos Aires since the Argentine Independence in 1810. People with different political ideologies gather here in massive political demonstrations like those organized by Evita Peron or by the Mothers of Plaza de Mayo. The Plaza de Mayo also houses important city majors landmarks such as the Casa Rosada Presidential House, the Cabildo o Government House during the colonialismperiod; the Metropolitan Cathedral of Buenos Aires, among other magnificent buildings. Location: between Hipólito Yrigoyen 300, Rivadavia 300, Balcarce and Bolívar streets.<br>  <br>  #2 Recoleta:<br>  A classy residential and commercial district replete with French-style buildings and art nouveau constructions, Recoleta is one of the most expensive and elegant neighborhoods of Buenos Aires and one of the most popular for tourists. Its central Plaza Francia is surrounded by coffee shops, restaurants and other hot tourist spots like the Del Pilar Church, the Palaise de Glace or the University of Buenos Aires Law Faculty. Every weekend, exciting cultural activities and colorful crafts markets take place. And for the thick-walleted, you can enjoy exclusive high-end shopping from global brand names.<br>  <br>  #3 The Congress:<br>  The magnificent gray stone Palacio del Congreso emanates an imposing and awe-inspiring presence in this neighborhood which the locals commonly refer to as “Congreso.” It is a middle-class area with strong commercial activity that gives you a taste of the real Buenos Aires. The Plaza Congreso decorated with several monuments and sculptures, is the second most important political venue for Argentines. Many demonstrations either begin or end at the Congreso because it is connected to Plaza de Mayo via ten block of Avenida de Mayo.<br>  <br>  #4 Belgrano:<br>  A residential neighborhood in the north of Buenos Aires, Belgrano offers both a peaceful oasis and commercial energy. The upper middle-class enjoys living among the quiet leafy inner streets as well as shopping along the busy Avenida Cabildo lined with shops, boutiques, and corner cafes.<br>  <br>  #5 Tigre:<br>  Located just 17.5 miles (28 Km) north of Buenos Aires city, this beautiful and colorful town lies on the shore of the Parana Delta. Tigre’s various outdoor activities can vary from taking a tour through the islands of the Delta; walking around the charming town, screaming your lungs out at the Parque de la Costa amusement park, or gambling away at the Casino. To get to Tigre is very simple taking the line Mitre of Buenos Aires Railways and after 40 minutes travel between Buenos Aires northern neighborhoods.|`|mUDqzRB1aa	Buenos Aires and Around (2-4 weeks)<br>  <br>  Fly into Buenos Aires.

Any of the places that the other people have recommeded to you are great, you cannot go wrong. I live in the states but was born there and I promise you a wonderful time. Everyone is full of life and the food anywhere you go will be the best. I would try to fly via LAN airlines for sure. If you've never been there you will have the time of your life. In the capital go to Molier nightcliub or El Bosque (in the city of Qulimes 20 from the capital) and you will have a wonderful night. I just returned and have planned to return to move there. Also if you care to shop hit Avenida Florida and you will find anything you desire. Have a wonderful time!
8K5Aiqq5aa	Chosen by Dowager Empress Cixi while on her deathbed, Puyi ascended the throne aged 2 years and 10 months in December 1908 following his uncle's death on November 14. He was titled the Xuantong Emperor. Puyi's introduction to emperorship began when palace officials arrived at his family household to take him. Puyi screamed and resisted as the officials ordered the eunuchs to pick him up. His wet-nurse, Wen-Chao Wang, was the only one who could console him, and therefore accompanied Puyi to the Forbidden City. Puyi would not see his real mother again for six years.[2]<br>  <br>  Puyi's upbringing was hardly conducive to the raising of a healthy, well-balanced child. Overnight, he was treated as a god and unable to behave as a child. The adults in his life, save his wet-nurse Mrs. Wen-Chao, were all strangers, remote, distant, and unable to discipline him. Wherever he went, grown men would kneel to the floor in a ritual kow-tow, averting their eyes until he passed. Soon the young Puyi discovered the absolute power he wielded over the eunuchs, and frequently had them beaten for small transgressions|`|asaLj4BTaa	The youngest emperor is Liu long, emperor shang of han.

4nEErhXmaa	First; park and take the Metro into Paris (you could park at the airport and go in via the train). I'm sure you're a great driver, but they just do not have parking, anywhere. Once in town you can even get a bicycle from a rent by the hour and return anywhere rack and wheel your way around. <br>  <br>  Often the best views (like the Eiffel Tower) are from a ways back, find the Trocadero at sunset and you will have the best view in town of the tower. Visit Montremarte (white church on hill where the young and hip hang out). Grab a Batobus river/and city bus tour. <br>  <br>  Paris doesn't look like "Paris" until you get right into the heart of it, so don't give up as you see all the warehouses along the interstate!|`|RMS7eFfpaa	I hope by road trip you mean taking public transportation. Driving in Paris is next to impossible for Americans... (assuming you are American). Parking is another matter: it doesn't exist and it's very very expensive. Seriously, forget about driving in Paris.<br>  <br>  As for places to see: there it Louvre, Les Champs Elyees with Concorde on one end the Arc de Triomphe on the other. The Grand and   the petit palais. Montmartre. Notre-Dame... and many more.

tDV8BlLKaa	threaten a complaint,  complaints to dean = review = time out of her day and paperwork = problems for her and no body wants that,  or just stand up to her , or let ur bf do that, if she says a word to you, just ignore it and only talk to your teacher or leader|`|3On59BLLaa	sorry, buddy, you dug the hole and fell into it, so now you have to crawl out of it by yourself! ;D|`|85a4c9cde9714c89ebb089295f22fa0daa	try posting this question in the "etiquette" category, you may get more responses,. so you don't have to re-post it three times.

Get your grades up and show that you are serious about this. Then, try to transfer over to UWM. This would show that you are trying to improve your grades.

oPec3sWdaa	Im pretty sure no one is that racist against blacks but its a known fact that light skinned people have it better then the dark ones. Tyra Banks actually had a show about the topic. But don't let it get to your head that us light skinned people are more succesful in the world because thats not true either ! So just keep an open mind and don't let the color of your skin affect your attitude ! Be the best you can possibly be and i wish yu the best of luck in your foreign destination !|`|vKM2Sdymaa	We do not have ningun problems.<br>  The problem that tenewmos in with the gypsies

lcj1AKt1aa	What type of cabin is it? Is it Penthouse suite, Royal, Celebrity, Sky, Aquaclass, Deluxe Veranda or Ocean View? The site is not saying anything about the cabin numbers. Only someone that has been in that same one would be able to answer you correctly.<br>  <a href="http://celebritysolstice.com/#/accommodations/aquaclass/" rel="nofollow">http://celebritysolstice.com/#/accommoda...</a>|`|fv2GAAdPaa	check with your travel agency or go to travel reveiws and see if that info is there.<br>  <br>  =]|`|CpJnhy1saa	go to cruisecritic.com and ask there. There is on page on choosing a cabin. Good luck.
yz0cx103aa	a passport or birth certificate|`|siHN027laa	Legally, it can't be done and you could be in legal difficulties, as well.<br>  Reason is, any minor leaving the U.S. must be accompanied by a parent and having a notarized letter of authorization from the other parent.<br>  If neither parent is accompanying the minor, more serious issues arise.<br>  The reason they do this is:<br>  1. To stop the kidnapping of minors by one parent or the other and taking the minor to another country.<br>  2. To stop the illegal trade of minors for sex trades.<br>  3. To stop kidnapping for monetary gain by the the abductor(s).<br>  4. To stop kidnapping for the slave trade.<br>  Personally, I'd wait until your friend is 18. No problem at that time regardless of how remote the chances are of being stopped or questioned. Not worth the risk now even though your intentions may be good..|`|D6NBfSVoaa	I'm not really sure on the letter, but I do know though that he/she needs a passport, in case you didn't know, in order for the person to go with you.
AA10780838	Civil Air Patrol|`|bzAV03kbaa	you are legally old enough to take flight training. it's expensive so, my suggestion to you would be to get a private lisence,  tthen work your way up. it's expensive, but worthwhile. I can't  believe your having that much trouble. study study study, Im glad you are so devoted. i learned to fly when i was 16.  A good way is to volunteer (when your licensed)and just pay for going up. If you want a career maintaining aircraft, that<br>  s a different deal. Do you want to fly. or do you want do be ground crew??|`|03c870c2ab95c32e4284f873e1540058aa	i dont think you can even get driving lessons, i hope you can't fly yet
Gj4o5222aa	You could take the Alaska Marine Highway from many ports in Alaska to Bellingham WA.  There is no rail service from Alaska to the lower 48.|`|MmTe8W8uaa	There are no "ferries" in the sense of a quick ride where drivers stay in their cars and get to their destination the same day.<br>  <br>  There are cruise ships.  They are expensive.<br>  <br>  There are trains.  I know that there is a train from Alaska to Canada, that there are trains from Canada to the lower 48 states, and that there are trains in California.  I am not sure whether there is direct service; you will probably have to change trains a few times.<br>  <br>  There are airplanes.  You might have to ship the motorcycle and fly without it; anything containing gasoline is not allowed on passenger planes for safety reasons.|`|2t7EvPd6aa	There are ferries which have sleeping quarters on them.  Contact British Columbia, Canada travel or AAA, if you are a member.

G4XgFTlfaa	lindinho is kinda like a pet name.. directly translated, its something like my little cutie/handsome (For males) for girls its minha lindinha although thats less heard.. Yes you can say it either way.|`|JHAqEETmaa	means "my little beautiful".<br>  Well, for my own experience, this term isn't only used in a bf/gf way.<br>  Sometimes a girl, just friend, can say that to a man without any hitting intention. (or a man to a woman).<br>  It's even used in a sarcastic way. (but not aggressive though)<br>  One thing i assure you: i never used that expression with other guys!<br>  lol|`|3SR3EGuxaa	my beauty<br>  lindinho for men <br>  lindinha for woman<br>  if spoken directly for you means you are a men.|`|CMm8eQwtaa	It is literately translated "My little handsome". "Meu" means "My", "Lindo" means "Handsome", and if you add the "inho"on the end it means "little handsome". If you want to say "Beautiful" it is "Bonita" or "Little Beautiful" is "Bonitinha"<br>  <br>  I guess you could say it to your friend depending on how close you guys are, but it is usually used in a boyfriend/girlfriend way.<br>  <br>  I learned all this when I lived in Brazil from a Brazilian instructor.|`|oxfvyOLxaa	mue means my<br>  and <br>  lindinu means beautiful/ pretty<br>  so it would be something along the lines of my beautiful (person your talking to or object )<br>  <br>  examples: Mue lindinhu bebe (my beautiful baby)<br>  or it could be used as: Mue lindinhu casa (my beautiful house)<br>   <br>  if your calling someone mue lindinhu, then yes i would suppose it would be directed toward a boyfriends or girlfriend. =D
