20090429064053AA4JeAq	Yahoo! Products;Yahoo! Answers	I have a question about blocking ( quite serious ) ?	OK so one day I got this e-mail from a (male) YA user. I can't remember what it said but it seemed fairly normal. And I replied to it, as I normally do.      But recently I've been getting quite disgusting, sometimes threatening e-mails from the same person. Yesterday he added me as a contact. I blocked him straight after.      Now I know blocking someone means that they cannot email you via your profile, but will he be able to go into his inbox, find the email I sent him and click "Reply" and send emails that way ??      Thanks...

20090226144609AAgcIIy	Yahoo! Products;Yahoo! Answers	Yahoo Answers - No Best Answer, Deleting questions, any way to bump posts?	I am finding frequently that I ask questions and get few or insufficient responses. I'm not exactly sure the best way to deal with this sort of situation. I need to know first off, if there is some way of perhaps bumping my question, or making sure people see it? With very specific questions such as my Crysis Widescreen sort of questions, I can understand not getting responses. However, questions about common, everyday things ought to have more answers, so I'm wondering if my questions are being suppressed by newer questions? How can I prevent that? And no, I'm not talking about expanding the expiration; I do that already.      As for questions where I get a small number of "answers" and none of them work, what exactly happens both to me and to the answers when I choose No Best Answer? When I delete the question? I mean as far as points are concerned. Speaking of Best Answer, it seems like sometimes I can choose a Best Answer directly, but sometimes it's put to a vote. Why is that?      I would really prefer honest, direct answers as opposed to a link and/or you telling me to read the same Yahoo stuff that I've already read. Thanks in advance.

20090226154435AA5Y8dK	Yahoo! Products;Yahoo! Messenger;Other - Yahoo! Messenger	Plz respond..Im so frustrated!?	ok....Im a guy and i have been playing volleyball for a while now..im 15 years old....freshman at highschool....In november, i have been invited to play in an off season league for my school...I was so happy cuz i didnt have highschool experience at all...just from my brother training me and teaching me things is how i learned how to play (hes on the varsity team)...we won the entire league, and this was the first time they won ever, i know i was a huge help to them because i had alot of kills, digs, perfect passes, and alot of aces..And the school coach said he was impressed with me and said im really good. and i have no highschool experience at all. So now, my brother's club team coach, asked me to play for the 16's team!! i was so happy! i was only 15 and a freshman and im good enough to play with the 16 and sophomores. And when i played with them, i was like better than most of them...I was happy cuz i was at the top of everyone my age...So ive been practicing alot lately and going to the practices and stuff and we play at tournaments and stuff.. So now, tryouts are next week for freshman and im really pumped and nervous but all the varsity players told me not to be cuz im really good and i can play jv later on in the season...Now, all the freshman are saying i cant spike on a guys net and stuff and they keep talking crap to me saying i suck and i cannot spike just because im short...im about 5'6 but i have alot of technique and experience now...(i play rightside hitter)....i can put alot of topspin and i can block a little bit like i can get a few a game...and my defense is good....I just get mad when everyone keeps thinking i cant hit...Like ive seen them play they think their good at "gym volleyball" but their really bad at it....when they try to spike it on a girls net they like run into the net and the ball is like a little tip and no control and its like so weak....so what should i do about these kids? their about 5'9-6'0 footers but from what i saw, their all horrible....What should i do? please respond!!! Thanks im stressing out about this!   Thanks a bunch!
