20090304124005AA7lxtH	Pets;Dogs	How do you train a dog with this kind of problem?	A friend of mine has a small terrier type dog that has just recently started becoming aggressive. He is 3 years old and his behavior problems started about six months ago. He has been neutered so I've ruled out chemical in-balance. He has no problem towards the inside dog but when it comes to the outside dogs, he becomes dominate and chases them away when they get to near his house. He has also begun to bite people. It has only been up until recently that he just nipped at people, mostly men. He seriously bit someone yesterday. I found out the my friend's ex-husband is aggressive towards the dog and I figured that was part of the problem. Now it is attacking a majority of the men that come around, from friends to the UPS man. What I cannot figure out is the dog does not attack my friend's father, an elderly gentleman, nor her uncle, another elder and he is very affectionate towards her son as well as her son's friend (I think). It is very strange. I am asking for suggestions on what to do to help him stop the biting and hopefully stifle his aggressive, possibly territorial behavior. Any help?

20090304124345AAMCDrI	Pets;Dogs	My puppy barks and is scared?	We have a 6 1/2 month old puppy who we've had since he was 6 weeks, he is part GS/Rott. Recently everytime he's outside he has started to bark at  EVERYONE and will not stop. Though I want him to bark to warn us, I'd like him to stop when I tell him to. Is there a way to do this? Also, he is very afraid of our son in law, though we can not figure out why. He will not go near him, shakes likes crazy and doesn't like to be in the same room as him. We can't figure out why. He does not look intimidating, is not mean,etc. He doesn't see him very often cause of his work schedule but just loves my daughter and grandson who is 3. The only thing we can even attempt to think of is that he is bald. (?) But is this really a reason to be afraid? My son in law will even go near him to pet him and talk to him,give him treats but.... no such luck as of yet. Thanks for your help!

I bought a hexagonal fish tank, 35 gallons in size, and the piece that allows the front part of the hood to open has broken. I cannot repair it for the life of me.

20090304130917AA41ybI	Pets;Dogs	Is flea and tick preventative 100% necessary?  Or can a dog go without?	Do dogs have to have flea and tick preventative or can they go without?      I am asking because in times like this where the economy is bad I'm sure the thought has crossed many minds.      I mean I do believe the Heartworm preventative is very very important.      But isn't flea and tick something that isn't a must?   I know many who treat their dogs as it happens and check there dogs for ticks every day?   Give flea baths if they get ticks.      So is that a smart thing to do or not?      I know what vets say (after all they make money on the products) but I don't always agree with the vet or my doctor for that matter.      I'm just curious I'm not saying we are going one way of the other I'm just curious about what the general public thinks      How many of you are not currently using flea and tick preventative?

20090304131835AA7H0M8	Pets;Dogs	Help with dog eating?	I have a 2 1/2 year old female Siberian Husky. Ever since we've had her (since a puppy) she hasn't been a real big eater. Recently she's gotten really skinny, her sides are starting to sink in, and you can't really see it because of her thick coat, but you can easily feel her ribs and her spine.   I took her to the vet two weeks ago, and there were no health issues found that would affect her eating. So, he suggested changing her food. She was eating Purina Dog chow, but we switched her to Purina Pro Plan, which she barely even touches and she doesn't seem to be gaining weight, and she's been on it for two weeks.      So, I was wondering, what would be a good food to feed her that, even if she doesn't eat a whole lot, will put a bit of meat on her. Has anyone had a dog in the same situation? And what worked for your dog?   Thanks!

She is showing with enlarged mammary glands.     I read a book on cats and it said I should deworm her to prevent her kittens from getting worms.   I called a vet and they said I should wait until the kittens are taken to their first visit to the vets at 6-8 weeks.   Is this a ploy to get more money from deworming potentially 5 kittens and cat or       Should I do what the book says or the vet?      Have you any experience with this?

Today I took this thermometer thing and my garage in from 50-58 and my mom said it was close enough but I'm, not too sure. I have one of those cat carrier cages that cats come in when you buy them ( http://www.pet-dog-cat-supply-store.com/...       --> like that but bigger) and I was going to buy him a crittertrail one (because it was the only one that fit) and put it in there (we have cats in out garage) then put an old bed comforter over the cat carrier. Would that be enough keep him warm? Also I can put extra bedding in the cage and put a small blanket in the cage. Please help me, I am really upset!

20090304141045AACe6jU	Pets;Horses	What's the best way to halter break a colt if you can't do it yourself?	See here's my problem... I have a colt that needs to be halter broken but I'm pregnant so it's not safe for me to do it myself. My boyfriend and mom volunteered but they don't have any experience so I'll have to walk them through it. I also lost my round pen a few months ago due to a grass fire and I only have a small feeding pen, the colt is only used to me, and he doesn't like to have his face touched even by me. I'd hate to chute him but I'm thinking that may be the only way to get the halter on him without potentially getting my less experienced volunteers hurt in the process. I thought about getting my fiance to brush and feed and accustom the colt to him as well as train my fiance at the same time first but Stephen just doesn't have the time to do it as often as I do. Any ideas?      P.S. There are no other local trainers for me to hire. The closest one it 64 miles away and he wants an arm and a leg to come do it.

Should be good with kids and nice to strangers and other animals. Should love to play and have fun and be super cute. It doesn't mind sleeping alone it has to stay in the kitchen at night. Has to be not that expensive were not going over 350$. If you know the breed of dog i need or where please be in Maryland, Baltimore or somewhere near that place because that's where i live. I want a puppy that won't mind cuddling but also loves to play outside. I know this is a lot of requirements but my mother is sort of "picky" and here are some dogs that are not good for me: Poodles.

Sorry for all the requirements but i need to know what dog is good for me. i really want a puppy so badly as soon as possible thanks!

When I put him back in it, he went immediately to the bottom of the tank and started hyperventilating in the corner. After about 5-10 minutes of that, he went to the top of the tank to take a breath. He then began wobbling on his side and then onto his back. He is now completely on his back and it has been about 10 minutes. I don't know if he is dying,  or if he is going to be okay. My friend and I are on a fish watch right now to see if he is still breathing. Basically I just want to know if anyone has had this problem or if they have any advice for me on the subject.

She is going to give birth any day now and I was just wondering on average how many to expect. I had a friend who moved to canada and I know she had a hamster who had 18 surviving babies and 5 dead ones.   I'm really worried on how I am going to sell them too. What would happen if I can't and there are no pet stores will accept them. I am not allowed to advertise on the internet.   I have done loads and loads of research and know exactly how to look after the babies.   This would be her first litter definately. So how many do you reckon I should expect?   Thankies x
20090304145957AARxAZ2	Pets;Cats	My landlord's cat is in my bedroom refusing to come out from under the bed. How do I get it out?	I've just moved into a room in the landlord's house. I was in the bathroom and the door was ajar and the cat walked into my room.   It is hiding under the bed.   I am trying to coax it out but it looks frightened (it can see me naked lol). I can't get all the way under the bed to grab it, and if I try it just runs to the other side of the bed.      I've tried to feed it with a grape, but that doesn't work. It just sniffs it and backs away. It sniffs my fingers.   Shall I harpoon it and eat it for dinner?   Help!

Is there some way I can stop them from doing this? The only way they have access is when I allow them to play for awhile in the backyard.       I generally pick up the poop once a day, when I first got them I would pick it up immediately but I was not working because of medical reasons. Now that I'm back to work I don't have time to clean it up until the evening.       How can I break this habit of theirs?
20090304143819AAidClh	Pets;Dogs	How can I get my dog to like being in a car?	I have a dog that's about 8 months old now and still a puppy of course, but whenever I put him in my car to take him places he starts to cry.  But he doesn't really cry, more like short small whistling out of his nose as you all would know.  Then he'll jump on my lap while driving as if he wants comfort from me or something.  I'll push him to the passenger seat and put the window down so he can do what dogs do, but he doesn't.  He'll just do the whiny thing and jump on my lap again!!!      How do I get rid of this or what is the problem here?
20090304101452AACQ8mD	Pets;Dogs	Want an english bulldog, what questions should i ask?	Me and my husband have been talking about a bulldog for a few years now. We intend on this being and indoor pet. i am stay at home , take care of everything while he works. We have a 6 and a 7 yr old boy and girl. We feel like we are ready for an animal to take into our family and to love. We have located the breed of dog we want, on the internet, about 3 hrs away. i am hoping it is not the bait and switch, I want to call them up and talk to them but i am nervous and dont know which questions to ask. Like the amount they want seems a little cheap for an AKC and how to ask them the questions without offending them. ask about health conditions and things like that. I basically need a laundry list of questions to ask when ttrying to purchase an AKC so I dont put any uncomfortable conversations forth. i just have trouble talking to strangers and dont want to mess this up.   Any one, or any dog buyers or breeders, please give me some insight. I would prefer a male that we could stud later down the road if we choose that option, mostly, we are just looking for the animal to be a part of our everyday life
20090304145150AAa4Hes	Pets;Horses	Fear Of My Horse ASAP!!!!!!!!!!!!?	Before I type this I want everyone to know dont tell me "Cowgirl Up" i need advice.      Okay so my horse used to be crazzy but we took him off protein food and he stopped. After having to gain my trust back for a couple months I woldn't hesitate to put people who have never been on a horse before on him.       Today I was lunging him over a ground pole and he was perfect at the walk and yrot then suddenly I asked him to canter he went over the pole once then took of alloping and bucking. Refusing to let go of the lunge line I yanked it and sharply told him NO!! He stoped then I go up to him hit him on the shoulder and tell him no. Then I trot him some more and he is a angel and when I ask him to canter he does the same thing twice and he doesn't go in a circle he goes straight. He is far to big to go in a circle at that speed. I understand horses are aloud to misbeahve on lunge line but not to this extent. Also he is almost always bombroof and his tempermant is 2.       I now am afraid to get on him. Does anybody know why he might be doing this? Any advice on how to mend my fear? Thanks! And please be understanding!

They didn't get hurt though. I fixed the gap (which was fairly small).

I would only be giveing lessons to about 4 kids, my brother and sister, a 8 year old boy who is going to lease my horse and my sisters friend.      so anyways what would be a apropraite price to charge them? also what would be Required before i did lessons? would there be some special insurance?

20090304122623AAwtpWS	Pets;Fish	Should I get a heater for this small tank...?	I'm kind of a beginner.  I got a 2.5 gallon tank with a filter.  The tank says it's good for goldfish or bettas.  I haven't gotten the fish yet and still wondering what fish to get.  Problem is the water's cold right now, it's colder than the thermometer reading -- estimating about 50 degrees.   Is there a heater for a tank this small?  Where could I find one if so?   I read goldfish don't like heaters though, and could get burned.     I know the water should warm up in the next month, I just have it in a cool room.     Should I just get goldfish, or a betta?  Thanks for your help.

20090227074831AAVfKIE	Pets;Rodents	Does spaying rats affect personality?	I have two female rats.  The older is spayed and the younger one will be spayed on March 17th.     I know girl rats are usually all over the place but my spayed girl acts more like my boy rat.  She has gotten a bit fat and naps a lot.  My younger rat is quite rambunctious and always on the go.  Will this change once she is spayed?  Is the spaying the reason for my older rat's laziness or is she just a squishy lazy little girl?  Anyone else notice behavior changes in females after spaying?      Also...my rat who is already spayed was nowhere near as active as my little rat before she was spayed.

20090304133408AAAcZVF	Pets;Cats	Cats fighting, what do I do?	I have a cat that I'm pretty sure is a Maine Coon. I've had her for almost three years now, she is one of two cats. My older cat is about six. Normally Ruby, my MC, is a very loving and sweet natured cat. However, the other night my older cat was in my lap and when I went to get him off so I could get up Ruby flipped and started viciously attacking him. My husband and I separated them for over an hour. When we let Ruby out she went up to Dillan and they touched noses so we figured everything was okay...Then my husband thought it would be a good idea to vacuum, which Dillan is horrified of...I believe that is what set both of them off again because they started to tear into each other again. Anyways, we made a knee jerk decision and ended up taking poor Ruby to the pound. My husband is on his way now to go get her back(it was like losing a child for both of us). So I guess my question is, not because of the 24 hour separation but because of the fighting, do we need to re-introduce them???

20090304141002AAiwd2x	Pets;Cats	Kitten Skinned!! WHAT KIND OF HELP!!!!?	First off my uncle had a new kitten come to his house.      Then about 2 nights ago, at night he said  he heard a racked out side on his back porch, and he said he went outside and seen that something had the kitten cornered, and was on top of the cat.      He said that the object looked like a cat, but was much bigger then a cat, and had a long skinny tail.      He said he chased the object off the porch and that the object darted off the porch, so a possum, or a raccoon is out the question, because they general move slow.       The kitten rang toward the wooded area between our houses, and then a few mins later he heard them again, and he said he knew that  the object was after the kitten.      Then today, early he went out to his shed and found the kitten skinned, with only the tail and feet skinned and he said that it looked to him that the kitten was dragged back to the shed and skinned there, the skin was gone.   The kitten's body was intact!         My question is, what kind of animal could it of been??      and why would the animal just skin the cat? and not eat the cat, and just skin part of the cat???      What kind of animal do you think this could be???      HELP!!

20090227074535AAJVBxX	Pets;Dogs	Is it normal for a spayed dog to go this crazy?	My girlfriend let Lulu, my recently spayed female beagle, into the bedroom this morning while she was getting ready for work.  She hopped in bed and went under the covers, as usual.  Typically she'll lick a foot or leg in the process of going under there.  However, today she added a new step.        She tried humping me.      She's done this in the past.  She woke me up once using me like a typewriter.  She'd hump her way down my leg, and then hump her way up my leg, repeat.  I didn't know what was going on because I was asleep.  The bed was shaking and I heard panting.  I stopped her after I realized what she was doing and finally stopped laughing.      Today she went under the covers, again, nothing unusual, and then I felt her flop onto my foot.  She wasn't doing the grinding part because I guess she's still sore, but I'm pretty sure I knew what she was up to.  I moved my foot only to have it mounted again a few more times before she gave up.      We have a male dog and neither of them has showed interest in mounting the other.  The two times she was in heat they'd go in circles trying to mount each other for days even though he was fixed at a young age.      Why am I the victim here?

I feel we dont have a strong bond and it makes me feel as if I am doing something wrong. i want her to be like my ther dog ( well i want the bond to be like that), is there anything I can do besides play with her and walks?

20090304132357AAjteYW	Pets;Cats	Cat has a lump on her stomach?	We got a cat about a month ago from a lady who just had a baby and said she didnt have time to take care of the cat too. She is 4 years old and has been spayed and shots and everything. Well my husband and I have been joking about how fat she is because of her tummy flap til I went to rub it today to play with her and the minute I touched it she cried out and hissed at me and ran away. Assuming it is hurting her pretty bad if she gets defensive when we try to touch it. From what I felt it is soft and it really looks like just a flap of fat right on her stomach,  it doesnt go any further up, like by her chest. So I was thinking it might be like an abscess or maybe an infection of some sort? I cannot get ahold of the lady who gave her to us to find out exactly WHEN she was spayed to know if maybe that is the reason. But has anyone else experienced this? I plan on taking her to the vet ASAP but I would like a few ideas also.
20090304141418AAjDYZl	Pets;Rodents	HOW TO GET KNOWN AS A BREEDER!?	I breed hamster's, for the love of it.   I love seeing the colors especially since I've noticed   the more colorful and gorgeous markings they have the more   a person will want that certain one.      How do I let people know I have them? Sometimes, I get over-run but how can I get pet stores or other places to buy or just take them?      P.S I'm not fond of pet stores but most of their animals are grossly and sickly. If I sell them healthy ones they will be adopted out faster. I live close to the local pet store including the one in the mall so I can keep an eye on how their being handled if I don't think they do a good job.

It's a half tail like an Aussie's but he is 3/4 German Shepherd and 1/4 Belgian Shepherd.  The young guy I got him from bought him from a Belgian immigrant couple who owned the parents.  I've asked for the information but he wouldn't or couldn't give it to me (I think it might have been a relative).      Has anyone heard of this happening?

I may be an anxious new puppy owner but if anyone has heard of this happening it would ease my mind.
20090304120649AAftKhO	Pets;Horses	My mare doesn't take a bit well, or let me mount?	I recently bought a 6 y/o mare, and she's a stubborn little bugger.      When we try to put the bit in her mouth (Not sure what kind of bit I'm using--I'll add it in later), she'll throw her head back, back up, etc. I usually have to get someone to hold her halter so she can't move and then slip my thumb in her mouth to get the bit in. Even that doesn't work all the time, because she usually still manages to get a few head tosses in, which throws both me and my helper off, so we have to start again.       Then, the mounting. She'll watch me from the corner of her eye, and when I go to put my foot in the stirrup, she'll either kick out at me, or try to run me over with her hindquarters. I've, again, had to use a helper to hold her head in place so she can't move, and then use a block, as I'm a bit out of practice at mounting, anyway.      She generally lets my dad mount, though. I know it's probably because I'm scared to death of that little girl, and she knows it.      I am sick and tired of her disrespect. Does anybody know what I can do?

Now they pee poop and play with the pads, but they all the sudden got this habit of take their poop to there bed and start eating it.      My question is how can i get my puppy's to stop playing with there peepee pads and stop eating there poop?   I tried speaking to them with a firm voice then rubbing there face on the bed and the peepee pad and telling them no but it doesn't work. It's not a problem with odor...Iready tried everything possible in my mind.. i honestly don't know what to do.

The puppy will gently nibble the kitten and try to hump her, all of which she is happy to accept. The problem is, this dog is way more huge than the cat! Should I be concerned that he might accidentally bite her too hard or squish her, or just let them work out their inter-special relations?

20090304144038AAQALzC	Pets;Rodents	How do I convince my mom to let me get a guinea pig?	Last year i had a hamster that i loved a lot and i liked taking care of. When I went to pet smart to buy it something they had guinea pigs and my mom said when my hamster died I could get a guinea pig. My hamster died in October and I was really upset. I miss having my own little furry pet to take care of and feed evryday. I asked my mom if i could get a guinea pig now like she said I could and of course she said no cuz thats the kind of b***h she is. I said please and I told her she said I could, but she still won't let me. She said maybe in 3 years but the only reason she said this was because in 3 years im going to college and won't be able to have one.    I dont think this is very fair considering my life passion is animals. I have two dogs but they are different then rodents. I like rodents actually better because they are smaller and they stay in my room and they belong to me, not my family. I feel more responsible and mature. Is there any way to convince her to let me get one? I told her this. I told her I really miss having one and that I feel like theres something missing from my life. She just doesnt care about it.       Any Ideas??

He was very friendly and playful around us but was always shy around around people outside of the family.  We got him a choke collar yesterday and he has improved his behavior a little so we were happy.  Today I put him on one of those outside chains so I could play frisbee with him (never played it before with him).  Well he peed on the chain and when I came back with the frisbee he ran toward me and reached the end of the chain and he went flying then he ran back away from me and did the same thing only twice as bad.  So what could have happened because now he is very timid around us again just like when we got him?  Please help us.   Thanks in advance

20090304151124AA7J4OK	Pets;Dogs	What qualities do you look for in a mentor?  How important is it that the mentor be "nice"?	I got to thinking today about my "dog" mentors... and those people I learned the most from.        Stunningly, the people I learned the most from were NOT the people who everyone would consider "nice"... they were the people who simply told the truth without trying to whitewash it.      As the early days of my involvement as an adult with dogs are moving into the past 20+ years now ~ I've also found that some of the things that REALLY upset me in my 20's and 30's now make sense and I am sorry that I cannot now apologize for my attitude then to the people who were attempting to educate me.   I have few regrets in my life ~ but that is a big one.      So - I'd like your take on things.      What qualities do you look for in a mentor?  and is being "nice" one of them?

20090227080240AAtUwqc	Pets;Dogs	My dog is limping and is raising his left hind leg. What's happening?	My 3 year old Bichon is limping around since yesterday night. He doesn't seem to display any signs of pain besides the limping. I checked between his paws,his entire leg, and applied pressure to all parts of his leg to see if he broke anything- nothing. He is trying to walk normally but is limping so that he runs with his leg up, as if he was going to pee. so it looks like he's always in the "pee position". His leg is also shaking a bit when he tries to put the leg down. After trying, he quickly brings it back up to the pee position again. Extending his leg seems to be the problem. Any thoughts? I'm going to take him to the vet after a couple of days.

They told me she is mixed with a terrier of some kind. I am doubting this. They knew the mother was full blooded Basset but never actually saw the father. Anyway she has shorter ears and LONG legs. The coloring is that of a Basset and she certainly has the personality of a Basset! Her walk and tail and feet are very Basset-like. Her ears are shorter and are perky but when she relaxed them they look like Basset ears. Any ideas? Here are some pictures of Molly.

20090227081033AAecI0h	Pets;Fish	What can I do about my cichlids?	I have two 1-and-1/2-inch cichlids in a 15 gallon tank. The blue cichlid is clearly the dominant fish, but I'm concerned that the yellow cichlid is going to die from stress because the blue cichlid chases him so much.    The yellow cichlid has taken to hiding up behind the impeller casing of the filter. He hovers vertically there, which can't be good for him...He also squashes himself between the plants and the glass at the back edges of the tank, sometimes sitting so still that I worry he's dead, until the blue cichlid starts to chase him again.    I'm also concerned that he's not getting enough to eat. He only eats food if I can get it to fall very close to him, otherwise he's too afraid of being chased. Would putting more rock/wood/plant hiding places in the tank help at all?

20090304152515AAL3hEf	Pets;Birds	Crop Bra for 2 week old cockatiel?	I know it's long but I need your advise.   Our little baby is having a problem with his crop. It sags so low it's hard for her to empty it out.    A little history: After the hatching of 3 eggs the parent birds abandoned the last egg. This being our Little Darlin. We put the egg in the brooder to keep it warm and a week later it hatched. We tried to put the baby in the nest with the others however, the parent birds would not have anything to do with it. Since they pushed the baby aside we put it back in the brooder and took on the feeding ourselves. We followed the feeding to the T. The right amount of food and at the right times. I don't know why the crop stretched so far down making it hard for the baby to empty. Little Darlin begs for food anytime any one of us in the house walks by. We made a crop bra and she is now wearing it. Her crop seems to be working better. At noon today she had 7cc, she is 15 days old. her next feeding should have been at 5pm however it looks like she still has about 3cc's still left.    Is there anything else I can do that I haven't done yet. I know to let the crop empty. Will she be okay missing a meal?   And how long will she have to wear the crop bra?   Thanks
20090304152644AAJwdNH	Pets;Dogs	Jack Russell/ Rat Terrier Mix- behavior issues?	I have a year old jack/ rat mix (male) and I am really concerned something is seriously wrong.  I have had dogs since childhood and never have had the issues in training that I have had with him.       The major problem is the biting:   My husband and I have tried the yelping when he bites to signal the "hurt" sound and he stops for a second and then goes for our hand again. We have also tried what our vet suggested which is placing our thumb and forefinger around his jaw when he bites so that he "can't bite." and then say to him... "NO BITE."  in a stern voice.  That again is only temporary.  I have also tried placing my hand around his mussel and saying "no bite as well."        My husband and I have been doing this for the past year and it hasn't gotten any better. What can I do that I'm not doing?!?! I love this dog but he can't go around biting people whether it is "play biting" or not.       We have also had other issues but this is the most pertinent.
20090304153124AAdHyTq	Pets;Other - Pets	I just got a puppy(cavachon) and I already have a cat...?	and they seemed to progress pretty good in getting along(not enough to let the dog go on his own without supervision of course).  We only really had one problem.  The dog kept wanting to eat my cats' food.  We can't think of a way to keep the dog away except for putting the cats food on top of the kitchen counter but we don't want to promote going up there.  Does anyone have any ideas(and if you went through the same thing I would love to hear what you did to solve it)?

20090304153319AAixsHi	Pets;Cats	What are some of the best ways to stop a cat from peeing in corners?	I have a 18 year old spayed female. She never went into heat. She's lived with my family since she was six weeks old. We also have another female spayed cat, 20 years old, had her since she was six weeks old as well. The kitty in question is a nervous nellie but she has mellowed with old age and having a human with her almost all the time. As far as I can tell, our older cat is the dominant cat. We had this problem with our kitty before when we redecorated our home. However she stopped a couple of years ago. Recently she has taken to peeing again. We haven't changed anything in our home since December and that was just adding an excerise machine. We have at least one cat hanging outside our home recently but our cat is an indoor cat, always has been. Around May, we became aware that her hearing was going and in July, it finally went but she seems to have adapted well and has been adjusted for about three months after she lost it. I can't think of any reason she would begin this again. Can anyone suggest some methods to stop her from peeing?

20090304154330AAv7mC8	Pets;Reptiles	Please help, I'm very concerned with my bearded dragon?	Well my beardie has been acting kind of strange. I just got him on Saturday. He has been very tired. He sat in a corner all day today. And the weird thing is, he was on the opposite side of his basking light. He usually spends alot of time under the basking light. He also hasn't pooped since Saturday/ Sunday. Since then, he has eaten crickets and superworms. He has also had 3 warm baths. He has a basking light and the temperatures are 90-100, but right now it is at 86. We changed the bulb yesterday and we accidently put in a bulb not strong enough. But we are getting another bulb today. He also has a UV light. His previous owner did not use a UV light, which also worries us. He doesn't really like to drink water either, but we try to get him to drink as much as possible. He is a 2 year old male.       Is he ok? Should I take him to a vet?      Please help, I'm worried D:

20090304154107AAuYDEv	Pets;Dogs	What are your opinions on these topics?	There are a lot of controversial dog related topics, that certain people feel very stronly about. So I am going to provide a list to see what the concensus of YA is on these topics. Just copy and paste the list, and then delete the answer you don't want.      Raw feeding, Good or Bad?      A related topic, kibble, good or bad?      Vaccination, Good or Bad?      Breeding (as in responsible breeding), Good or Bad?      Owning more than 10 dogs (or 20, or 30), Is it always bad, or can people do it properly?      PETA, HSUS, and animal rights in general, Good, Bad, or Just plain crazy?      Dominance training (like Caser Millan, alpha dog), Effective, or ineffective?      Dog shows (like Crufts), Good or bad?      Hunting with dogs (like open field coursing which is hunting live rabbits with sighthounds) Wrong, or the best way to provide stimulation for a hunting dog      I can't think of any more, but if you can think of some, you can add them to your answer and I will add it to my questions.

20090304153611AAlU7sJ	Pets;Dogs	Any suggestions for new tricks to teach my dog?	I took in a stray pit bull a few months ago, and he's a really fast learner!  I've already taught him sit, down, stay, heel, fetch and either drop on the ground or place in my hands, paw, other paw, and up high! [when i hold out my hands and he jumps onto his hind legs for the high five- the trick was to teach him to go for my hands, not my tummy]  He will NOT learn roll over, he won't let me roll him over, and he even stops listening to "sit" and "down" when he knows I'm trying to do roll over...who knows why, it may have to do with a past experience or maybe he's just being stubborn, it doesn't really matter.  But now I don't know what other tricks to teach him!  He's really smart, and I can tell he's looking for a mental challenge, but I'm all out of ideas.  Any suggestions?

20090304153632AAhBeIF	Pets;Dogs	My Siberian Husky won't stop whining.?	I have a siberian husky. She's a little older, but she's always been really quiet and she hasn't barked hardly ever. Within the last month, she's started this whine...a really harsh whine, like what a human would do in pain. I've told my parents, but they don't think anything of it...but it's really not like her, at all. She just whines, constantly...she won't come to me when I call her to give her attention, so I was wondering if something else could be wrong?    I was also wondering if it could be a trait of pregnancy? We had my brother's dog here for a while, a Pomeranian, and he's not fixed, so we thought she could have been pregnant a few weeks back...but she's not gaining weight, but I still think she might be.    Any help would be terrific. Thanks.
