db32e228f722e24e3c47946a59ae4075aa	It will explode!<br>  <br>  My mom and step dad work for an electronics store... <br>  <br>  A lady came in to their shop with her microwave, it was filthy, covered in dried blood and fur. She tried to get it as clean as possible before bringing it in to the shop. It wasn't working and she wanted to pay for it to get fixed so she was there to show them the damage and get a quote on how much it will cost to get it fixed.<br>  She told the counter guy what her granddaughter did. Her granddaughter gave her kitten a bath, then wanted to dry off her kitten fast... soooo she stuck her kitten in the microwave and BOOM within 50 seconds. Both the lady and her granddaughter had no idea it would do something like that.<br>  <br>  pretty sad but now we know to just hold our wet kittens or hamsters in our lap wrapped in a towel.  <br>  <br>  =)|`|EsVjwKPAaa	toasted hamster|`|3t9cH1CTaa	you are a champion. you just turned my **** day around. if you want a equally as funny but not neraly as mess or illegal, try putting an egg in / should have samey results|`|YXCDdDKIaa	totally hypothetical?<br>  <br>  I sure hope so!<br>  <br>  I don't know what to say other than, YOU ARE STUPID!<br>  <br>  You shouldn't even kid about things like that. I don't care if you are kidding or curious, there is something wrong with thoughts like that.|`|25u9sxfsaa	well ud get caught on animal cruelty charges.....<br>  <br>  :P<br>  <br>  hmm, i think it would just cook|`|niGAKJT4aa	i've always heard they would blow up but i'm too scared to find out for sure.|`|UMkfjFLzaa	It will be cooked i think

uap6JAqQaa	i was going to suggest skinny cow - the ice cream sandwiches are great! they don't taste like "diet" food at all.|`|a251tw6caa	Edy's Slow Churned Ice Cream<br>  It's naturally low in fat because of the slow churning process(4 grams and under) and it comes in all of those awesome chocolate flavors!<br>  <br>  If you don't have Edy's brand there, other companies also make slow churned.|`|sXfw3qxdaa	The amount of fat in ice-cream usually depends on the amount of milk in it (so it's wise to check the milk percentage which is usually under the ingredients). Peter's has a low amount of milk, so it is lower in fat, but it contains more sugar- which converts into fat if you do not burn it (so unless you do a lot of exercise, I would not recommend it). But look in your supermarket isles. Sometimes your favourite brands may also make low fat!
sF13O9Fmaa	Thats a strange question but the serious answer is that human flesh would provide more nutrition than any other kind of meat.<br>  <br>  It would be so sick though.|`|eze4eR3yaa	then I guess you're healthy ()()()()()()()()<br>  cannabolism?|`|9LXXs93haa	Hmm,maybe you could ask Dr.Hannibal Lecter....what about your brain?|`|S1YGHrRzaa	Go see a doctor!

It's thousands of years of education and religious and social taboos...
65e0c93e39fac0974cefe1be5c93b58daa	In general, most mixed drinks call for 1 shot of the alcohol poured over ice and then fill the rest of the glass with the mixer.  This tends to give the best flavor.  You'd have to experiment a bit to get it just right for your own tastes.<br>  <br>  The ice is part of the deal, so if you want the cup without ice, only fill it 3/4 full. <br>  <br>  You're pretty small, so I'd say you'll always have to watch how much you drink - unless of course you like falling down a lot!<br>  <br>  Happy drinking!|`|9twZdl6laa	1 1/2 ounces|`|TzZnsjquaa	Depends on your tolerance, too. Given that you were "wobbling over the place" after two drinks, I'd say it's likely low. One shot glass full of 80-proof alcohol is equivalent to one drink, and as a small female, that will likely put you at about .03 BAC - probably a little buzzed. Two will get you quite buzzed, and at three you'll easily be legally drunk.|`|db32e228f722e24e3c47946a59ae4075aa	I'm 5'4 and 145lbs.. <br>  <br>  I don't drink any alcoholic beverages... it's just dumb.<br>  <br>  I used to love vodka and rum but all it did to me was killed my liver, made me look dumb..... and wobbly...and ended up getting raped.. not good.<br>  <br>  I'm good with my dr pepper, water, propel's...etc<br>  <br>  and I'm happy... and I have a very healthy liver still!!!
ys8YrveKaa	I love movie theater popcorn so I have to BUY that.  But I also love to dip it in the little cups of nacho cheese they sell (for $1.50).  I found a 4-pack of the exact same nacho cheese sauce at WalMart for about the same price that they charge for 1!  So I heat it up at home, wrap foil around it to keep it warm and stick it in a ziploc in my purse.  Works every time.|`|4f277076c7dd369d5ac6ab9f14e344f6aa	If you go to Target you can get some candy for 1.00<br>  <br>  I like recees pieces the most - the chocolate and peanut butter drive me crazy.

0eaFftjyaa	I would say it is too dry, the recipe i have for marzipan is <br>  <br>  250g ground almonds<br>  1-2tsp water <br>  500g caster sugar <br>  Drop of vanilla Essence<br>  <br>  Mix the water with the almonds until you have a paste, add the sugar and vanilla Essence and another tsp of water, stir over a low heat until the mix has dried out a little, work the mix like dough until you get the right consistency.<br>  Another way is far more difficult as you will need a sugar thermometer <br>  <br>  350g ground almonds<br>  170g caster sugar<br>  <br>  add a little water to the almonds until they become a paste, melt sugar over low heat until it reaches 101c, add the almonds to the sugar and mix together, remove from the heat. Make sure to scrape the sides to prevent the sugar sticking when it is removed from the heat, the past is ready when the marzipan does not stick to the back of the hand. Place the past on a board and sprinkle with caster sugar, it is ready to use when cool
ozWi3TJlaa	Lucky, lucky YOU!  There are many things to do with them, but I live in Michigan, and our favorite way is to dip them in flour seasoned with salt and pepper, and then fry them over medium heat with butter and a little oil (to keep the butter from burning).  Drain on paper towels and chow down.<br>  <br>  I could give you a zillion recipes, but this is a Michigan classic.|`|da580af9e5114d80d24d6e1ac5858417aa	Send them to me ;)  What a treasure!  I will post a couple of recipes tomorrow, but in the meantime if you want my address, please feel free to e-mail! LOL|`|wWpmYSMEaa	Store them and eat what you want and sell the rest. You could get a big chunk of change for them! But make sure to store them in the fridge in a loosley closed paper bag and never in a sealed plastic bag because this keeps the moisture in and leads to rot! When you are ready to eat them rinse and pat them dry.|`|db32e228f722e24e3c47946a59ae4075aa	eat 'em!<br>  <br>  Bon apatite
S1YGHrRzaa	I did that most frequently when I was in elementary school... Ha! That was funny. I've always been somewhat attracted to sour drinks (used to drink balsamic vinnegar for pleasure...). Nothing special. The peel makes your mouth feel like on fire, burning and the sourness of the interior is rather palatable after it. I like it. Enjoy it even now from time to time... But most often I just peel them off as one does with oranges and eat it whole. It's glorious!!! I love the sour taste and the slight sweetness it leaves in your mouth. I have a friend who puts broken pieces of peeled lemon in a jar of honey (2-3 lemons for half a pound of honey) and he uses that as food one day a week. Claims it keeps him healthy... Whatever....|`|F3ppjOwlaa	As a small child, I used to eat large chunks of lemon for the amusement of the adults present.  I remember the initial taste and then the involuntary shudder I made as I chewed up the lemon. I don't think the experience ever varied.
282a6319def08c9536ee77d12721bce3aa	If you look at your voucher you will see a VALID UNTIL date which is usually around 2 yrs hence you have 2 yrs to spend your voucher or save them. If you don't spend them they do not get added onto your next statement. You can also ring Clubcard up and ask for them to be sent yrly if you want to save them.|`|PwHQSAxvaa	The voucher expires on the date printed on it, and is not carried forward. I can't quite understand why Tesco don't just scrap the Clubcard, which costs them money to operate, and simply replace it with discounts in store for everyone.|`|w5uHiNcoaa	The tesco vouchers that give you a value to spend (the amount varies with the amount of points - eg 1000 = ￡10) those ones are valid for ages - around a year, I think.<br>  <br>  However, the other ones that you get, the ones that are for specific items that give you maybe extra points, or money off or whatever, they are only valid a couple of months. Those ones are often tied into the sort of things that you buy - for instance, if you frequently buy, say, Tesco own baked beans, you may well find a voucher for a named brand of beans. Those ones aren't really anything to do with the amount of points you amass.<br>  <br>  With both types of voucher, if you don't use them, then you lose the discounts - the points are nt added back onto subsequent vouchers.<br>  <br>  It is a case of 'use them or lose them'.|`|LCHnUuS6aa	The vouchers are valid for a long time, up to a year I think, so you will not get another voucher for the one you already received, just new ones for the points accumulated during the next period.|`|SttRtZ1Kaa	Everything you receive from "tesco club card" will have a expiry date on it.<br>  If you don,t use before this date, you lose it.

THEN you get the height.|`|ob9oJpKbaa	Use dental floss or cotton. Tie it around the middle of the cake. As you pull the tie tighter, it will cut perfectly through the middle of the cake.

LCHnUuS6aa	Redbush tea is great, it has that nice strong flavour, is great with milk, but is naturally caffeine free.  Find it in your supermarket near the regular teas.|`|09Y8F6hQaa	I just read that you can decaffinate your tea by using the tea bag once, then using it again and drinking the second batch of tea.  Most of the caffeine is eliminated this way so the second cup is basically caffiene free.|`|LThQhmFhaa	While I know you said that herbal tea tends to be too weak, have you tried Celestial Seasonings Red Teas?  They have a red tea that is Pomegranate flavored and it seems to be pretty strong.  I usually mix mine with sugar and milk and find it to be pretty strong.  Celestial Seasonings also has a Thai Coconut Chai tea that's pretty spicy & strong.  I always drink that with milk.<br>  <br>  I really like the decaf teas, that would be my other suggestion, but you said you don't care for those.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|RfihwARBaa	Yeah... have a glass of milk... and then go to bed earlier.. you'll wake up refreshed and energized for the next day...|`|4IQqkEdGaa	Try Redbush tea

AA11297232	To make ice-cream within an hour and half is impossible. If you are making it by hand it needs to go into the freezer, set and that takes ages, then beaten till smooth , returned to deepfreeze, no sorry you won't be able to make it within that time.:)|`|AA11707728	You can't.....as in its physically impossible.  An ice cream maker makes it fast by constantly running the mixture along a cold surface and then scrapping it off as a thin layer freezes.  Without that, you will need to freeze an ice cream mixture.  Any mixture that does not contain fat, you can do this (fat will seperate out as the mixture freezes).  That takes way longer than an hour and a half.<br>  <br>  Basically, take any ice cream formula and replace any milk and cream with fat free milk in the exact same amounts.  Then just freeze normally.  It will probably come out as hard as a rock but 10 seconds in a microwave will fix that.|`|ZnoLaj1raa	yes you can you just need patiance , all you do is take two container i inside the other , but with enough space to fit ice around the sides , put the ice cream in the inner container , and start rolling it back and forth and in like 15 min youll have ice cream|`|SyuGWtq0aa	Hi, you can make it without an ice cream maker but not in an hour and a half...sorry.

First of all, this is not even a question this is just you saying dramatically and pathetically that you can't handle being a vegetarian.<br>  <br>   Vegetarians only become vegetarians if they care about other lives human or not. They don't say that they don't care about animal cruelty. They don't just become vegetarians for the heck of it and then after a few months whine pathetically that they can't handle it! And what's cats and dogs got to do with this??...are you trying to blame them for eating meat??? Just because they eat meat doesn't mean that you should too. <br>  <br>   You could eat meat but just think about how many animals die just for people like you who eat their flesh, enjoy it and not feel any guilt about it and only caring about the taste.|`|dPfpstQLaa	I can't believe I haven't seen this answer already, but I guess most people who have answered are either vegetarians themselves or the carnivores that like to bully the veggie board, but why don't you just eat organic free-range meat.  And I know sometimes the labels lie, but you could probably Google local ranches and guarantee their accuracy.  You speak about animal cruelty, which might mean that like me you don't think that the eating of meat is wrong, per se, so much as the way financially motivated companies deny these creatures basic rights.  If so, just seek out humanely slaughtered animals and limit their place in your diet.  I can't speak for the radicals, but PETA's website says that even cutting back your meat intake to a meal a day helps the world greatly, so why not comprimise?  Seems like you've got a good start.|`|kPNnfjNSaa	Dude, eat meat. I know it feels wrong to eat animals because they're living, breathing beings, but you know what? That's literally pretty much why they're here. Humans would not have been able to survive all these years if the neanderthals were skittish about what they should eat. It's the food chain, and it's a natural part of life. <br>  <br>  If it makes you feel better, try to find a local farm that you can purchase animals to kill and cook yourself. Sounds cruel, but you'll feel more comfortable if you see that they were well taken care of, and that you're not causing them too much pain in the process.|`|pKNAeYCQaa	TRY PESCATARIANISM! :)<br>  <br>  It's where you don't eat meat or poultry, but you do eat seafood. I do it and it's really great. There are so many types of seafood to try that you'll never get bored and you'll get all the protein you need. I highly recommend salmon, scallops, and a wildcard -- shark. I don't eat shark because I particularly love sharks and don't want to see them killed, but I did try it once and it's honestly a LOT like chicken. So if you really want something like meat that isn't meat, you could try shark every once in a while.|`|7857ce4d05df69a811cf2ac828f90172aa	If you eat fish you're not a vegetarian of any kind, pescetarian is a word you guys invented to make yourselves feel special. <br>  <br>  You are not a vegetarian.

The cruelty thing doesn't make sense.  If we don't kill some of the animals, it will be over populated in a very short time.<br>  <br>  There are a reason for us being able to eat meat.  It is because it is so good!|`|cZdXcmFlaa	hi, I am a veggie and I know how you feel I get the worst cravings for meat sometimes. <br>  There is nothing wrong with giving in to those cravings every now and then the odd weakness is still making a difference as its not as if you eat meat everyday so your still saving many animals.<br>  Also if you think being veggie really is not for you , why dont you eat ethically free range chicken and meat and buy local. I personally do not have a problem with people eating meat as it is nature and animals eat other animals, the problem is the mass farming and the horrific lives these animals have before they go to slaughter. If they have a good life before though I dont see the problem.<br>  If you dont want to give up all together then like I say the occasional weakness is sometimes what you need, you may find you no longer like the taste of meat and it will put you off again. I give in maybee twice a year and I find it helps me not crave it the rest of the year as it turns me a bit now.<br>  Also it doesnt say in your answer where your from , but if quorn is availabe to you have you tried that? its far better than tofu! also if you feel a bit unwell perhaps your not getting enough iron?its in green leafy veg and dried apricots<br>  well done you for even trying to become a veggie and help the lives of animals , you shouldnt give yourself  a hard time as your trying your best !|`|sMTVcfiVaa	Well, then, go "flexitarian." It's better for your health than just eating *whatever*. Flexitarianism is when you are mostly a vegetarian and stick to vegetarian values for the most part, but indulge in meat once in awhile. If you really feel like you can't possibly handle life without meat, well, then it's just not for you. Think long and hard about what you want to do. If you really feel like you can't handle being a vegetarian, then just eat what you want to eat. Nobody's making you stay veg. It's a personal lifestyle choice and you need to sit down and really think hard about it.|`|F3LBgfvwaa	Actually your body CAN live without meat, you just have no willpower.

There 's no biological reason that you can't/<br>  <br>  "I hate tofu, I hate mock-meats"  - There is no reason a vegetarian diet needs to include these things.  In fact the longer I'm vegetarian the less I use them and the more I eat natural foods.  Beans stew, nuts to snack on, cheese ravioli, chocolate soy milk, edamame - I find these to be much better ways to get protein.<br>  <br>  "Cat's and dogs eat meat" - I know this is a shock, but you are not a cat or dog.  You are a human.  You have a developed frontal lobe.  You make your own decisions.  You also probably don't eat your own poo, spend all of your time naked, pee everywhere to mark your territory or eat one single food source out of a bowl on the floor.<br>  <br>  "I feel week, I feel lethargic" - What have you been eating?  You talk about processed food and protein but you don't mention fresh fruits or vegetables.  You don't say that you are getting enough iron and B-12 and Omega3 and fat and all the rest.  Eat some dark green veggies, some citrus fruit.<br>  <br>  "Bulky enough for me" - What does that mean?  Also if you are eating seafood then you're not a vegetarian of anysort.  Sorry, but there is a dictionary definition and it includes all things in the animal kingdom, not just those on land.<br>  <br>  You want to eat meat, go ahead.  No one's making you be a pescaterian.  But be informed about your choices.  Learn something about nutrition.|`|AA12334360	You are right in that cats and dogs eat meat.

BWxSSADaaa	Roti is made with a whole wheat flour, whereas wheat tortillas are usually made with white flour.  The biggest difference is that there is substantially more fat in the dough of a tortilla.  Roti uses little or none in the dough.  Most recipes call for just flour, water and a bit of salt (some call for a very small amount of oil).  Tortillas on the other hand, include shortening or lard in the dough.  Nutritionally, I would say they're very similar, though, as rotis are brushed with ghee after cooking to make them soft.|`|AA10923010	Wheat tortillas or any Mexican tortilla is made with lard or shortening and it closely resembles an Indian chapati. <br>  <br>  The word for bread in several languages spoken in India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Bengal, Africa and the West Indies is roti.<br>  <br>  Here are some of the rotis cooked in these parts of the world.<br>  <a href="http://www.top-indian-recipes.com/Indian-breads-rotis1.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.top-indian-recipes.com/Indian...</a><br>  <br>  Indian roti can be made from a variety of different flour types and they can also include other items to make the dough The dough can also be stuffed, and they use oil or ghee in or on the rotis to cook them. <br>  <br>  Here are two sites for you to compare the tortilla and the roti also you can include naan and chapati in your search. .<br>  <a href="http://allrecipes.com/Recipe/Mexican-Whole-Wheat-Flour-Tortillas/Detail.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://allrecipes.com/Recipe/Mexican-Who...</a><br>  <a href="http://kitchensofindia.com/default.asp?re=o" rel="nofollow">http://kitchensofindia.com/default.asp?r...</a><br>  <br>  Also check on Pita bread and see how closely these breads are related.<br>  <br>  My background history:  Born in India, lived in the middle east, the West Indies and Mexico.

dPfpstQLaa	Yes, it's only meat that is not allowed by vegetarian standards.  And if you are thinking of going vegan, there seems to be different levels.  Of course eggs are out-I know plenty of vegetarians that don't eat eggs, just cause they're "almost" chickens,but some stop with cheese, milk, ect., and others don't do honey or yeast, but those two don't really seem universal.|`|ZZcsGRIvaa	Eat organic honey.

It is the ocmbination of Starch and Fats.  I don't reccomment cutting either one of them out, because out body needs both.  I lost like 20 lbs in slightly over a month just by seperating my starches from my meats on a day to day basis.  <br>  <br>  I came across this while I was searching for a way to help me with my digestion (I have stomach problems).  The starches are what create the cells that store fat.  If there are no cells, the fat can't be stored, if there is no fat the cell will not be able to exist for long.  <br>  <br>  Are stomachs were never designed to eat both at the same time, and our bodies aren't able to gain all the nutrients it requires from just one or the other.  It is proven that those types of diets are extremely hazardous to your health!  So please be careful with these diets.<br>  <br>  Also, vegetables are a great source for all of what are bodies needs, we NEED meat as well.  Vitamin B12, in particular, can be obtained only from animal protein. It is essential in the production of red blood cells and, scientists in the magazine Nature have just revealed, vital for preventing brain shrinkage and dementia. And with two out of five Britons deficient in B12, that's a big concern.  Zinc is important, too, for wound healing and it also helps control the appetite. <br>  <br>  No human civilization has ever subsisted, let alone thrived, without animal flesh of some kind. In fact, the study of past and current tribal populations shows that traditional diets contain about twice the protein intake of the typical Western diet today. On average, about a third of hunter-gatherer diets were protein-based. And protein for these folks meant mostly meat.<br>  <br>  <br>  There are more reasons, but I dnot have time to write more.|`|YiY9Yd2Jaa	Yes. Staying away from starch is a good idea.

Plant-based diets are bad for them, and hard to digest. Humans don't require meat.<br>  <br>  Also, animals doing something doesn't justify us doing it. For example animals are incestuous.

One way I'm doing this is by raising my own chickens, thereby boycotting the poultry business.  <br>  <br>  It's also possible to buy milk and meat from local farmers, as well.

Whenever a vegan tells me eating meat is wrong, I respond by telling them other animals in the wild do so in the same manner, and sometimes, in a more brutal manner. Here's you answer though, it's NOT wrong. However, if meat isn't eaten for religious reasons, I respect that highly, but for moral reasons, it's illogical. <br>  <br>  EDIT: I've looked through these answers, and I've noticed a girl that didn't even think of this. Wow. lol. Also, I've noticed the first answerer that said, "Not all animals eat animals, some eat plants." Okay, not all serial killers murder women, some murder men. Does that make it any different? Nope. Either way, they are still serial killers and they are bad news. Well, carnivorous animals are still eating meat, and because we humans are designed by nature as omnivores, we eat both meat and plants. I've noticed someone say animals don't get meat from the store and such, well, animals aren't smart enough to do that. Someone also said you were comparing human intelligent to that of a dog. Well, when it comes to eating food, it's not about intelligence, it's about surviving. Simply because we're the smartest animal on the planet doesn't mean we can't eat other animals. It's in nature.|`|AA11707728	Eating meat isn't wrong.  And the motivations of the people trying to trick you into thinking it is wrong....are evil.<br>  <br>  The point of moral vegetarianism is to reduce the importance of human life to under that of an animal.

Vegetarians sometimes attempt to convert other people because animals are usually harmed in the process of their death.

There is a demand for meat in the world and a select group of people aren't going to change the fact that animals will continue to be killed. They'll just be killed... pointlessly, thus wasting a life that they could be utilizing. Humans are animals, and it isnt the fact that we have an instict to hunt "meat", but we do have an instict that hunts proper nutrition. Protein is easily found in meat and has been nourishing humans for billions of years. Really, if I were you I wouldn't bother becomming a vegetarian.

Some people deside that it's wrong for THEM.|`|zeFUwg6Zaa	I LOVE ANIMALS..they are delicious!!!|`|uUDNcsyUaa	There is nothing 'wrong' with eating animals...humans are the top of the food chain.|`|CYeWFPcoaa	its not bad|`|vEp1fzr5aa	It is almost impossible to argue for a vegan/vegetarian lifestyle from a purely evolutionary perspective (we are just the highest of the animals). <br>  <br>  The argument must prove that humans are held to a higher standard than other animals (we either evolved morals or were created with <br>  them). <br>  <br>  Survival of the fittest claims that the strongest creatures will utilizes other creatures to promote their reproduction. Also, plants are living things.  Every time you buy a piece of celery, it once was living and had some life of its own. The argument then would be 'animals feel pain' so, I think the most consistent thing to do is fight for livestock to be sacrificed humanely.|`|ByxEE8eeaa	Vegetarians would argue that carnivorous animals don't farm other animals and eat them on a huge scale. They hunt them, which requires a lot of effort, and are usually unable to digest much plant material, making carnivorism a necessity. People, on the other hand, have the option of not eating meat.<br>  <br>  That being said, I'm not a vegetarian. I believe that as long as you show some degree of respect for the animal that died for you (don't play with meat, try not to waste it) then there's nothing wrong with eating it.|`|jej0Vnudaa	There are many good reasons to be vegetarian, such as health or the environment.  About animals, I have heard it said that some animals have to eat meat, while others eat plants.  Some people argue that people aren't supposed to eat meat.  I don't know if that's true or not.  Clearly, provided our diet is varied enough, we don't need to eat meat.  Cats, on the other hand, MUST eat meat.  So, even if we CAN eat meat, it doesn't mean that we must or should eat meat.  <br>  <br>  But in any case, it is clear to me that we aren't supposed to eat very much meat at least, if the high levels of heart disease and cancer we see are any indication.  Eating too much meat is simply unhealthy, and god knows what kinds of hormones and antibiotics they put in there.  It's actually true that antibiotics are less able to cure infections due to resistance the bateria have developed due to overconsumption of antibiotics, partially through consumption of animal products from animals that have been given antibiotics to make them grow faster.<br>  <br>  To me, you have to look at the whole industry as well as the whole society, even the whole planet, to see the impact of eating meat.  It's not a question simply of whether it is a case of is it natural or not.  Many people have gone their whole lives being vegetarian and have not had any problems doing so.  Vegetarianism is very common in India, and they seem to live just fine.|`|k2jGZjKjaa	who stated eating meat was wrong?  unless one is following the guidelines of the Bible on meat eating, then that's their choice.<br>  <br>  animals are designed to eat meat.  <br>  <br>  humans can SURVIVE without eating meat.|`|dovtFcDOaa	Yah they do.

Depends on the animal.<br>  <br>  You should just eat organic meat if youre concerned.|`|tB5bRBp3aa	Most of the animals that eat other animals are what we call "CARNIVORES." The can't even digest plants and fruits. If you want to look at it religiously then ask: why would god give these animals razor sharp talons. claws, and teeth if he expected them to not eat meat. You can't really compare yourself to anyway.<br>  <br>  Edit 1: Brianne is crazy   O_o|`|mIebCB7daa	Because animals are evil. That's why I put my cats on a strict vegan diet, since birth. I hate that other animals are meat eaters. That's why I leave anti freeze out for dogs that I see chasing other animals|`|bc0NTxNUaa	I think of it this way; humans have most definitely evolved much more than any other organism on the planet. We are intelligent enough to make our own healthy alternatives to meat, so why not take advantage of something much more humane? <br>  Also, excess animal proteins (which doesn't take a lot to have too much) a big cause of kidney stones and tumors. Just thought I'd throw that tidbit in there (:|`|cdaae96Yaa	Not all animals eat other animals, some eat plants|`|T2IzGMU7aa	other animals need to either to survive if theyre carnivore or to get all the right nutrients if theyre omnivores and we would need to eat meat if we where living as hunter gatherers in the rainforest<br>  <br>  but... since weve created a society in which it is not neccessary or helpful for us to eat animals we shouldnt kill an animal that doesnt need to die or keep it captive for our own needs unneccessarily|`|j04gpOKOaa	there is nothing wrong with eating meat. animals will be killed regardless of how many vegetarians there are. and plants alone can't feed the world.|`|22Oy1qp0aa	Yes<br>  <br>  <br>  And just fyi, a lot of people don't eat meat simply because of the meat industry, not the meat itself.|`|mQsF5dLnaa	Eating meat is not wrong, its just another liberal idea. I'm sure liberals don't have a problem if people ruin their minds and bodies on illegal drugs.|`|6NdC58n8aa	The animals that only eat plants evolved that way.  Notice how huge their guts are?  They have to be to digest only plant matter.  Humans are carnivores; not eating meat is not natural and not healthy.  If humans were herbivores, our guts would be as large as a cow's.|`|Jl91LewOaa	i suppose you don't know about herbivores?<br>  <br>  i luuuuuuuv meeeeeeaaaaaat, theres nothing better than a nice piece of juicy tender succulent meat!|`|B39SjaQmaa	Hmm, I'm a meat eater myself. But I sometimes have some guilt...<br>  <br>  The thing is, we have evolved into meat eaters. That is what Nature has made us. If you don't believe me, think about it this way:<br>  <br>  Humans have teeth called Canines (the pointy ones), which are named after the latin word for Dog. Now what do dogs eat? (If you say dog food, you're a moron)|`|lVdyjaiRaa	there's nothing wrong with eating meat since we're omnivores, not pure herbivores<br>  <br>  that's why we have the digestive tracts and teeth we do|`|jL6ppXqNaa	Some critters do, some don't. Humans are omnivores, so we eat plants AND meat. Vegetarianism is a choice, since we know alternative sources for protein. If you do become a vegetarian, make sure you get all the vitamins you need.|`|sHWh47jFaa	Yes, people are meant to eat animals as well as plants. Its not bad to eat other animals, everything in the world does it.

Eat the damn animal|`|Qe7IZGbCaa	eating meat is'nt wrong its the circle of life|`|Th9s2VSmaa	This is a great question, and I'll be happy to answer it:<br>  <br>  Humans have really long intestines, like over 30 feet, or so. And when humans eat meat, the meat gets clogged in our intestines. Inconclusion, the meat stays in your body until you trow up. (?)<br>  <br>  Animals have really short intestines, so the meat just goes through in seconds.|`|y3P2FgMpaa	It's not wrong. Its the way of life. Technically, we are animals (in a sense...) so, just like lions have an instinct to eat meant, don't we too?<br>  <br>  *shrug* just a thought|`|Jd8IAhCYaa	Dude, don't dwell on right or wrong, what other people think or what other people do. If you want to become a vegetarian go for it, your life your choice. <br>  Vegeterian's sometimes try and persuade people to not eat meat because they are convinced its whats right.<br>  and you can relate it to religion as well, people who believe in god will want you to follow there beliefs because of god's will and what not, there may not be a superior being that watches over us.<br>  <br>  What i'm basicly trying to say is no one is right or wrong, people have there own opinions on things and if you want to become a vegetarian then go for it man (Y) good for you.<br>  <br>  In my opinion, I love the taste of meat and I don't give it up because I believe that life is about survival. Were gonna end up passing on sooner or later so live life to the full.<br>  If a lion goes to eat you he ain't going to stop and think "is this wrong?"<br>  he's going to think "i'm ******* hungry"<br>  <br>  And thats what i think too when i go to eat.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  EDIT: I find it pathetic that people have actually voted a thumbs down for what ever answer they have come up with, just because they disagree with it? This guy asked a simple question and everyone just starts an huge argument on what they think is right. Jeeze everyone just needs to grow up.|`|g0o1YnlJaa	i wouldn't become a vegetarian! eating meat is not a bad thing.

I don't care how many B vitamins they take... also.. I have never met a happy vegetarian.. I think it is their deep desire to eat a juicy steak.. and they know they can't because of what they preach..|`|0k9Lt27uaa	well its not bad to eat meat.<br>  <br>  the problem is how do they make it.<br>  <br>  a chicken doesnt see daylight, and only gets food so they get fat.|`|sSg7wIcEaa	it's not wrong.<br>  i prefer you to eat everything.<br>  not eating vegetable can lead to<br>  bad skin problem

No one is going to give that up.|`|0maJCeLCaa	Well, they are not legal limits, they are guidelines, and as such they are quite valid - in lack of tried-and-tested limits, that can be valid for all. Such limits will never be found ... <br>  <br>  The 14/21 guidelines are actually based in studies - which have shown, that people who drink less than 2 - 3 drinks a day, and never have more than 5 drinks in one day, are less likely to suffer from a number of lifestyle deceases, than those who drink more, and who binge-drink. <br>  But they provide no guarantee for the individual, that staying within the limit will keep one safe from illnesses. <br>  <br>  And as I mentioned before, such limits will never exist, because a 100% reliable limit is very individuel, and is based on a lot of other factors in your life. The stress factor in your work, how much money you make, the environment where you live, your diet, your family life, your general sense of security, your level of exercise and your genes etc. <br>  There really is no way of telling what you personal limit is, until your life is over. Maybe not even then ...<br>  <br>  Other studies have been published to show, that red wine is healthier than beer and alcohols like vodka and whicky - and even healthier than white wine. Well that?s a little bit backwards .. because the studies have shown, that people who prefer red wine have less health problems from their drinking. <br>  And that's probably because these people tend to eat healthier in general ... so is red wine healthier? Or does it seem so, because healthy people just happen to choose red wine ...

You might just try giving them whatever you eat. Make sure to ask mom if they have any allergies!

mo8YBvC4aa	depends on your tolerance level to alcohol and many other things...if i had to guess tho prob like 4-5 beers or m/b 5 shots...just a guess tho hope that helps|`|7nGwou8uaa	wow. assuming you are young, get a life and shut the **** up|`|1NF6f4y7aa	Depending on your tolerance for alcohol, you should probably take it easy at first.  I say two beers and you'll be feeling a buzz.  I'm over two hundred and have a tolerance but can feel it after two beers.  Tolerance is more associated with longevity. Just because I can get buzzed after two beers doesn't mean I quit.  I can drink ten more before I'm drunk.  So if you are 115 lbs, you will be buzzed after two, but how many you drink after that is your tolerance level.  This of course deals with how much beer you're drinking.  If you drink liquor on the other hand, I would be very careful if I were you.  One drink would be enough.  It also depends how much liquor is in that one drink.  I would put one shot in to start off.  Liquor works different but can hurt you much more quickly and you'll end up talking to porcelain for half the night.  I would just be careful, be moderate, and try not to get too blitzed too quick.  It won't make your night any better and the next day you'll basically have to write off due to a hangover and being emotionally unstable.  Be moderate!|`|0b8887cb1bb770f83c9043e623f4cffcaa	i only weigh 125 lbs, and i hardly ever drink and on new years, i had like 8 shots of crown royal, and like 3 shots of tequila...but don't ever mix your alcohol...if ur already drinking like crown just stick to crown, if ur drinking beer, stick to beer, if u mix, you'll puke ur guts out.|`|e8vnFhi0aa	depends on your tolerance level. Some people have a good natural tolerance, some don't. But for the average person of your size, i will say 5 beer or probably 2 to 3 mixed drinks, or 6 shots. Well i hope i helped!|`|Z7dJA1e5aa	You can check out this cool bartender site, it has lots of information about alcohol. <a href="http://bartenderschool.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://bartenderschool.blogspot.com</a>|`|LoHPfvcyaa	Well your weight, tolerance and what you eat prior to drinking will all play a part in it.  Obviously you are a petite girl, so it will come down to how often you drink and you eating.  So if you go out to eat before you drink then you will help yourself out.  Then is it all down to tolerance.  If you drink often you will be more accustomed to the booze and can handle more.  Your body can process one drink per hour, so anything more than that will begin to get you intoxicated.  So how many can you handle?  How drunk do you want to get or not want to get?  <br>  If you are good you can have a couple in the first hour, get a little buzz and then pace yourself for the rest of the night.  Or you can get really drunk, not eat and pound away, but that won't lead to anything good.  So get a nice buzz and enjoy the night.|`|ivejg4whaa	Not much. Probably 3 beers or so.
XzLUA7ataa	You will need eight scoops of coarsely ground coffee to add to the carafe. (the scoop that comes with the press)  My preference is Christopher Bean Colombian Coffee.  Add four cups boiling water to the carafe and stir,fill to within about an inch of the top.  Place lid assemblyy on carafe.  Brew four minutes.  Press the plunger down slowly to filter the coffee.  Pour into individual cups and add about two ounces of half n half.  If you enjoy flavored creamer, you may use that instead of half n half.  I sweeten mine with a packet of Splenda.

xrRZeROmaa	Answer: People frequently assume that the main difference between lo mein and chow mein is the type of noodles that are used. It makes sense - after all, chow mein noodles are crisp while lo mein noodles are soft, right? Actually, the main distinction between these two popular dishes lies in how the noodles are prepared.<br>  <br>  Know Your Noodle Vocabulary<br>  <br>  Mein or mian is simply the Chinese word for noodles. Lo Mein means "tossed noodles," while chow mein or chao mian means "fried noodles."<br>  <br>  What Type of Noodles are Used in Chow Mein and Lo Mein dishes?<br>  <br>  Both lo mein and chow mein are made with Chinese egg noodles - wheat flour noodles with egg added. The noodles need to be softened in boiling water before cooking. Dried noodles are parboiled in boiling water for 5 to 6 minutes before using, while fresh egg noodles only need to be boiled for 2 to 3 minutes. The exact amount of cooking time will depend on the thickness of the noodles, so be sure to follow the package instructions if available. But whether you're working with fresh or dried noodles, the goal is to boil them until they are just cooked but not too soft (what the Italian's call "al dente," or "cooked to the tooth").<br>  <br>  If Chinese egg noodles aren't available, Italian pastas such as fettucini or linguini make a handy substitute. A "quick and dirty" lo mein can be made by using Ramen noodles with a flavor packet.<br>  <br>  How are Lo Mein and Chow Mein Prepared?<br>  <br>  The main difference between lo mein and chow mein lies in what happens to the noodles before they are combined with the other ingredients. In chow mein, the noodles are fried separately. Usually, the fried noodles are combined with the meat, vegetables and other ingredients in the wok at the end of cooking.<br>  <br>  Noodles destined for a dish of lo mein skip this separate frying stage. In fact, the noodles may not undergo any further cooking at all: it is common to serve the parboiled noodles in individual bowls at the table and pour the other ingredients over top. Alternately, the noodles may be quickly tossed with the sauce and other ingredients in the wok before serving.<br>  <br>  Since the real star of any lo mein dish is the sauce, it's not surprising that Lo Mein recipes often use more sauce than chow mein recipes. Frequently, the sauce is thickened with a cornstarch and water mixture before being combined with other ingredients.<br>  <br>  Which is Better - Chow Mein or Lo Mein?<br>  <br>  It all comes down to your personal taste. Soft lo mein noodles soak up more of the sauce than western-style crisp chow mein noodles. On the other hand, you can get a greater variety of texture in a chow mein dish. For example, crunchy noodles and celery could be combined with soft mushrooms, bean sprouts and juicy tomatoes.<br>  <br>  Did You Know?<br>  While chow mein with thin crisp noodles is a staple of many Chinese take-out restaurants, authentic chow mein is made with soft noodles. The main difference between the two comes down to frying time: for dryer, crisper noodles, add more oil and increase the frying time.<br>  <br>  So If you have crispy noodles from the package, or the can, it is definitely chow mein, no matter how you prepare the sauce, and if you stir fry the noodles, after boiling them, then again, it becomes chow mein, no matter what the sauce.  <br>  <br>  I propose that the health of the dish is in what you put into the sauce, and the small amount of oil involved in stir frying the noodles, or absorbed by crispy noodles, most of which are baked in commercial bags and cans, is insignificant.<br>  <br>  I honestly don' t believe the healthyness of the two dishes is significantly different.|`|d8FjURwhaa	Lo mein all the way!! lol

If you want a hotter jelly leave the seeds and ribs in all of them.) <br>  1 green bell pepper (or red if you want the color), seeds and ribs removed, chopped <br>  1 cup cranberries (optional but recommended, will help with color and with setting) <br>  3 cups water <br>  3 cups white vinegar <br>  3 1/2 cups sugar (7/8 cup for each cup of juice)<br>  Equipment Needed<br>  One 6-quart pan (Stainless steel or copper with stainless steel) <br>  A candy thermometer <br>  A large fine mesh sieve (or several layers of cheesecloth, or a muslin cloth jelly bag) <br>  4-5 half-pint canning jars<br>  <br>  Method<br>  <br>  Combine the apple pieces, apple cores (needed for their pectin content), jalapenos, bell pepper, cranberries (if using), water and vinegar in a large pot. Bring to a boil and then reduce heat to medium-low, simmering for about 20 minutes, or until the apples, cranberries, and peppers are soft. Stir occasionally to make sure nothing is sticking to the bottom of the pan where it might burn. Use a potato masher to mash up the apple pieces to the consistency of slightly runny apple sauce. If the mash is too thick, add more water.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  2 Spoon the mash into a fine mesh sieve, muslin cloth, or a couple layers of cheesecloth, suspended over a large bowl. Leave to strain for several hours (even overnight). If you want a clear jelly, do not squeeze or force through the mesh. Just let it drip. If you want a fuller flavor jelly and don't mind that the result won't be clear, you can force some of the pulp through the mesh. If your pulp is too thick, and nothing is coming out, you can add an extra 1/2 cup or cup of water to it. You want to end up with about 4 cups of juice. <br>  <br>  3 Measure the juice, then pour into a large, wide, thick-bottomed pot. Add the sugar (7/8 a cup for each cup of juice). Heat gently, stirring to make sure the sugar gets dissolved and doesn't stick to the bottom of the pan and burn.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  4 Bring to a boil. Cook for 10-15 minutes, using a spoon to skim off the surface scum. Continue to boil until a candy thermometer shows that the temperature has reached 220-222°F (8-10°F above the boiling point at your altitude). Additional time needed for cooking can be anywhere from 10 minutes to an hour or longer, depending on the amount of water, sugar, and apple pectin in the mix.<br>  <br>   <br>  Left: Jelly is too runny. Right: Jelly is wrinkling when pushed, which means it's ready.<br>  <br>  Candy thermometers aren't always the most reliable indicators of whether or not a jelly is done. Another way to test is put a half teaspoonful of the jelly on a chilled (in the freezer) plate. Allow the jelly to cool a few seconds, then push it with your fingertip. If it wrinkles up, it's ready.<br>  <br>  5 Pour jelly into sterilized jars* to within 1/4" from the top and seal. <br>  <br>  Makes approx. 4 half-pint jars.<br>  <br>  Serve with cream cheese on crackers.<br>  <br>  *There are several ways to sterilize your jars for canning. You can run them through a short cycle on your dishwasher. You can place them in a large pot (12 quart) of water on top of a steaming rack (so they don't touch the bottom of the pan), and bring the water to a boil for 10 minutes. Or you can rinse out the jars, dry them, and place them, without lids, in a 200°F oven for 10 minutes.<br>  <br>  Note that jalapeno jelly can be pretty "hot" if you have included a lot of the seeds in your cooking. The fat molecules in the cream cheese absorb the hot capsaicin of the jalapenos, reducing the heat, but leaving the flavor of the chiles. This is also why sour cream tastes so good with spicy Mexican food.<br>  <br>  www.elise.com/recipes/archives/002089j...

5zNwBQZHaa	Very good question.<br>  <br>  I think it is on a category all of its own.  The reason I say this is often in a big grocery store - the aisle that has the gum is labeled "Candy and Gum."<br>  <br>  Plus - candy is just a snack, a treat.  But gum is like a breath mint, you use it for a specific purpose other than to eat - it does something.  Likewise there are gums that are supposed to be good for your teeth, there used to be a gum with aspirin in it (asper-gum, do they still make it?).  <br>  <br>  So I think it might be separate from candy.  (And people make "home made candy" all the time, but have you ever seen "home made gum" advertised?)  <br>  <br>  I hope this means you win the argument :)|`|KtkitJwIaa	Yes, it is considered a candy.

Sounds interesting.|`|Hhifw93laa	mmmmmm my fav recipe<br>  <br>  Lemon-Glazed Madeleines<br>  <br>  24 cookies<br>  <br>  <br>  Adapted from The Sweet Life In Paris by David Lebovitz<br>  <br>  <br>  If you use baking powder, they may take another minute or so to bake since the batter will rise higher. They're done when the cakes feel just set if you poke them with your finger. Avoid overbaking them. There's nothing better than a fresh, buttery madeleine. <br>  <br>  <br>  I also prefer to bake these in the upper-third of my oven, so the tops get slightly-browned. I love the lemon glaze, but you can omit it if you want your madeleines nekkid.<br>  <br>  <br>  3 large eggs, at room temperature<br>  2/3 cup (130g) granulated sugar<br>  rounded 1/8 teaspoon salt<br>  1 1/4 cup (175g) flour<br>  1 teaspoon baking powder (optional)<br>  zest of one small lemon<br>  9 tablespoons (120g) unsalted butter, melted and cooled to room temperature, plus additional melted butter for preparing the molds<br>  <br>  <br>  3/4 cup (150g) powdered sugar<br>  1 tablespoon freshly-squeezed lemon juice<br>  2 tablespoons water<br>  <br>  <br>  1. Brush the indentations of a madeleine mold with melted butter. Dust with flour, tap off any excess, and place in the fridge or freezer. <br>  <br>  <br>  2. In the bowl of a standing electric mixer, whip the eggs, granulated sugar, and salt for 5 minutes until frothy and thickened.<br>  <br>  <br>  3. Spoon the flour and baking powder, if using, into a sifter or mesh strainer and use a spatula to fold in the flour as you sift it over the batter. (Rest the bowl on a damp towel to help steady it for you.)<br>  <br>  <br>  4. Add the lemon zest to the cooled butter, then dribble the butter into the batter, a few spoonfuls at a time, while simultaneously folding to incorporate the butter. Fold just until all the butter is incorporated.<br>  <br>  <br>  5. Cover the bowl and refrigerate for at least 1 hour. (Batter can be chilled for up to 12 hours.)<br>  <br>  <br>  6. To bake the madeleines, preheat the oven to 425 degrees.<br>  <br>  <br>  8. Plop enough batter in the center of each indentation with enough batter which you think will fill it by 3/4's (you'll have to eyeball it, but it's not brain-surgery so don't worry if you're not exact.) Do not spread it. <br>  <br>  <br>  10. Bake for 8-9 minutes or until the cakes just feel set. While the cakes are baking, make a glaze in a small mixing bowl by stirring together the powdered sugar, lemon juice, and water until smooth.<br>  <br>  <br>  11. Remove from the oven and tilt the madeleines out onto a cooling rack. The moment they're cool enough to handle, dip each cake in the glaze, turning them over to make sure both sides are coated and scrape off any excess with a dull knife. After dipping, rest each one back on the cooking rack, scalloped side up, until the cakes are cool and the glaze has firmed up.<br>  <br>  <br>  Storage: Glazed madeleines are best left uncovered, or not tightly-wrapped; they're best eaten the day they're made. They can be kept in a container for up to three days after baking, if necessary. I don't recommend freezing them since the glaze will melt.

wjlLWqLuaa	there is a slight chance that soy might suppress your thyroid and slow down your metabolism. i read this online. it also decreases ones sex drive. <br>  on the other hand, soy does great stuff for you as it helps regulate certain hormones in your body as well as cancer prevention. <br>  <br>  my diet is, whenever i can, soy free because of just that. i used to lose a lot more weight when i refused soy consumption.<br>  <br>  now i love rice dream ice cream lol. i got used to it. <br>  <br>  <br>  Why thumbs down? I've been a vegan for many years and experienced this.|`|hEAdpYHvaa	If you're working out that much and eating only that many calories, and you're still not losing weight... I'd say you're in top shape. You don't have to be in a constant state of losing weight... that will only end in death. Don't listen to the advertisements and media.<br>  It's got nothing to do with WHAT you're eating, but HOW MUCH. If your question is "Why aren't I losing weight?" then it's because you're eating enough calories to sustain your current weight. If you want to lose weight, eat less. But I would keep up with what you're doing now, and not even worry about calories.|`|jZRtTpZiaa	This question is asked over, and over, and over again in the forum.  That makes me realize just how much confusion there is about soy products.   Many people have quoted websites that are biased, anti-vegetarian, or anti-soy,  such as weston price,  soy online service, mercola, and others, which are absolute crap websites.  The w.p. one  even wrote a letter to the president screaming that soy fed to prison inmates was the equivalent of torture and medical experimentation.  They're also very anti-vegetarian, and their funding comes from farmers who are their members.   You have to be careful about what you believe from either someone who is extremely in favor of soy as the cure-all health miracle,  or from someone that says it's the next asbestos.     It is neither.    <br>  <br>  I eat soy products like tofu and soy milk-- and will continue to do so.  I have eaten soy for decades without problem.  I haven't grown boobs, or experienced shrinkage of male body parts,  or had any of the ridiculously overblown claims some of the online sites make.   I have not been "turned gay" by soy and my sex drive is just fine thank you.   I know many people who have eaten soy for decades before me, with none of the problems those sites claim.     Soy can be a problem for people who have an existing thyroid condition,  and can mimic the effects of estrogen if consumed in large quantities...  they contain weak phytoestrogens--  from plants, not from animals that may also have a protective effect against breast cancer in younger women before menopause.    If you're going to cut down on anything,  cut down on the highly processed products like soy hot dogs and junk like that.     Milk and some meat contains quite a bit of animal estrogen,  which is never mentioned on those sites, and is potentially more dangerous to your health.     I can make a website to tell you how dangerous water is.  In fact if you drink too much water, you could die.  But that doesn't mean you avoid water.  Some of the things in soy are in hundreds of other foods. It makes sense that anti-vegetarian groups like to pick on it especially hard because it has often been recommended as a good source of protein.  While they are picking on soy,  they conveniently also avoid the fact that it's fed to the animals they are eating also. <br>  <br>  Go take a look at some of the other answers to this question that has been asked frequently in the forum.<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=At.V6H987841OxBHX_DG7srty6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090303093859AA4oDtu&show=7#profile-info-KX5ALUzWaa">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a><br>    <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=Ar_0cAJjPkD0ENBsZNwrSLHty6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090227123612AAwSLXu&show=7#profile-info-defzWOvMaa">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=ArmQeDPkLQnO6ad4udI.eSvty6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090308140245AACeNJl&show=7#profile-info-PQzrsXsKaa">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|UyhmdJKUaa	Don't believe it. That's just Meat industry propaganda. There is nothing wrong with soy as long as your diet is not lacking in iodine. If so Veganlife brand makes a tasteless kelp powder to supplement. Iodine can also be found in sea weed and table salt.

sG5FKmAYaa	This is what I would call the Traditional English Recipe.<br>  Beef Wellington <br>   The Duke of Wellington was a highly prominent statesman and soldier of the nineteenth century. This dish, however, bears his name not because he was a great gourmet but because the finished joint was thought to resemble one of the brown shiny military boots which were called after him. <br>  Ingredients<br>  Serves: 8<br>  <br>  1.4 Kilogram Fillet of beef (3 lb)<br>  1 Tablespoon Vegetable oil<br>  40 Gram Butter (1 1/2 oz)<br>  225 Gram Button mushrooms, sliced (8 oz)<br>  150 Gram Smooth liver paté (6 oz)<br>  325 Gram Puff pastry (13 oz)<br>  1 Egg, beaten, to glaze<br>  Method<br>  Pre-heat oven to 220 °C / 425 °F / Gas 7. <br>  <br>  Trim and tie up the fillet at intervals with fine string so it retains its shape. Heat the oil and 15g ( 1/2 oz) of the butter in a large frying pan, add the meat and fry briskly on all sides. Press down with a wooden spoon while frying to seal well. Roast for 20 minutes, then set the beef aside to cool and remove the string.<br>  <br>  Meanwhile, cook the mushrooms in the remaining butter until soft; leave until cold, then blend with the paté. On a lightly floured surface, roll out the pastry to a large rectangle about 33 x 28 cm (13 x 11 inches) and 0.5 cm ( 1/4 inch) thick. Spread the paté mixture down the centre of the pastry. Place the meat on top in the centre. Brush the edges of the pastry with the egg. <br>  <br>  Fold the pastry edges over lengthways and turn the parcel over so that the join is underneath. Fold the ends under the meat on the baking sheet. Decorate with leaves cut from the pastry trimmings. Brush with the remaining egg and bake for 50-60 minutes depending how well done you like your beef, covering with foil after 25 minutes. Allow the Beef Wellington to rest for 10 minutes before serving.|`|AA11786341	Beef Wellington <br>  <br>  2 -to 2 1/2-pound beef tenderloins <br>  Ground black pepper (optional)<br>  1/2 of a 17.3-ounce package Pepperidge Farm?

8pIGQdybaa	You need to read margarine labels before you buy one...most contain casein or whey. Fleischmann's unsalted margarine is really dairy free, but again you have to read the label when buying, because their regular margarine contains whey. <br>  <br>  If you're eating cheese every once in awhile, you may want to try Galaxy Veggie cheese or rice cheese. You can find the veggie slices and veggie shreds in Kroger in the produce section, but they do contain casein (a milk protein).

The products that were on the recall were items that used peanut paste product or institutional peanut butter (hospitals, nursing homes) from the Peanut Corporation of America.  This company has been shut down, and many companies who got their peanut paste from them is now getting them from a new company.<br>  <br>  Go to the site listed in the first answer and see what is on the recall list.  If your store has these products, check the manufacturing date anything that is made just recently and on the shelf should be safe now.  Anything that is more than a month old then it should be pulled.|`|W2cj85OPaa	Yes, peanut butter is safe to eat now it's just that some peanut butter products are still on recall. Just look at the category "Peanut Product Recalls" on the link below. I hope that helps!|`|hNa5oHxQaa	Yes<br>  it's safe.

AA10394452	Most of the time you should put  parchment paper into the bottom of the pan and sort of make it stick there with butter and flour. You tap the excess flour out so it's just a thin, even coating. Also make sure your cake is on the middle rack of the oven. Do you have a gas oven? If so, get an oven thermometer stat! They have oven thermometers at conventional department stores like Target. The first thing you want to do to get an evenly baked cake or bread is make sure the temp is right in the oven.<br>  Most cakes want to be baked at 350 if they are in an 8 or 9 inch pan, but consult the recipe and follow it. Now if you are going to make cupcakes or little small things, then the temp will vary- usually at a higher temp for a shorter period of time.<br>  Never add more leavening unless you are very experienced. Keep following recipes and learning through trial and error. Know that some recipes just suck and also some ovens aren't that great (mine at this rental home is torturing me). I like "The Best Recipes" book put out by Cook's Illustrated. They have been tested and come with explanations on why they work.|`|S1S0pxHQaa	you are cooking it too high and half way between cooking you should turn the pan around.

McDonalds is not a government agency, therefore we have no power over it. The only way we can tell McDonalds what we think it should sell is by not going there until what we want is sold there.  Veggie burgers do not seem to sell well in McDonalds in New York City, so you rarely see them on menus here.  That is because McDonalds restaurants are franchises and each franchise is free to pick and choose from the corporation's offerings and sell only what the owner chooses (that is why, in McDonalds ads, you see "available at participating McDonalds"|`|mIebCB7daa	They shouldn't because McDonalds is the worst place EVER.

Fold Cool Whip into the pudding.<br>  <br>  Fold together pudding mixture and butter-cream cheese mixture.<br>  <br>  Layer this mixture (about 1/3 of it) onto the crumbled cookies in the pot. Next, add another layer of the pudding mixture, then another layer of cookie crumbs, continuing until all ingredients are used.<br>  <br>  As you're layering the ingredients, decoratively place several gummy worms and critters in the "soil" so they will be seen emerging. If you have a toy (clean) garden trowel, a plastic daisy, or some edible flowers, these can also be used creatively to embellish the presentation.<br>  <br>  Chill in refrigerator for 3 to 4 hours before serving.<br>  /////////////////<br>  WORM DIRT CAKE  <br>  <br>  1 lg. pkg.

Okay, to answer your question: Of course, you get intoxicated or drunk if you drink 5 shots of Captain Morgan. Remember, it is a rum and is quite strong. Okay, it is a spiced rum, so that makes it a little tasty and sweet but it is still rum and rum has a bigger alcohol contents than say a beer or a wine, so it gives you a wallop and you will get drunk without your knowing it. Believe me, I''ve been there before, and getting drunk is very, very embarrassing. Even if you try to mix it with soda, still the accumulation of alcohol in your system would get you drunk if you continue imbibing it, and in a party, you will not notice but you have already taken so much and before you know it, you are drunk and dancing like there is no more tomorrow. Depending on your body weight, as you have said around 100 to 120 lbs., and you are not an experienced drinker, even a shot of rum will deaden you and how much more if you take 2 or 3 shots. Beware! Good luck to you and God bless.|`|qjf1BoNIaa	If you are this clueless about alcohol consumption then you should not drink. Jesus, of course you will get drunk on 5 shots. Probably two and if it's half soda & 1/2 rum it's half a shot. Regardless, for your size five drinks in any 8 hour span will get you drunk. If you have one drink every 90 minutes or so you should remain only tipsy if you drink lots of water in between and stop at three drinks. No one drinks more than three a night unless they are planning on getting drunk.|`|B6BUR6zJaa	No, I can't.  But that's because I can't shoot rum.<br>  <br>  Half and Half is barely a shot.

Severe drunkenness may lead to acute alcohol intoxication. Common symptoms may include slurred speech, impaired balance, poor coordination, flushed face, reddened eyes, reduced inhibition and uncharacteristic behavior. Drunkenness can result in temporary experience of a wide range of emotions, ranging from anger, sadness, and depression to euphoria, lightheartedness, joviality, and sexual disinhibition. Consuming excessive amounts of alcohol may lead to a hangover the next day.|`|xi9amEG2aa	You wont be able to see straight, you'll be wobbly and really giggly...well, I am.  Everybody different and reacts differently to different types of alcohol....whether it be Smirnoff or Whiskey.  Although, it does enhance whatever mood you're in.  So if you're happy, you'll be happier.  If you're sad, you'll be like depressed.  My boyfriend also said that it's like a 'truth' serum'...you just start talking and talking, although people most likely wont be able to understand half of what you're saying.<br>  <br>  Being drunk is fun.....throwing up isn't.  I haven't really had a hangover yet, so I can't tell you what that feels like.  The worst I had was the day after my 21st bday I had to work (bday was on a thursday) and I didn't feel like moving, I had a very slight headache, and whenever I would stand up, I'd feel sick.  But that was it.|`|wIb3bXTFaa	Well it occurs in steps.  The speed you progress through these steps depends on how quickly you drink, when you stop, and how much experience you have as a drinker.  But generally, for someone who has not drank a lot before, they go:<br>  <br>  1) You start feeling good.  A little more awake, a little euphoric, a little happy.<br>  2) You start feeling really good.  Funny things are funnier, beauty is more beautiful, and you have a lot more confidence.<br>  3) You are feeling really really good now.  You are still feeling very euphoric, in a great mood, you're very confident, and even quite careless.  You can laugh at just about anything, you suddenly like everyone a lot more and think they like you a lot more.  Congratulations, you're officially drunk.<br>  4) But wait, it doesn't stop there!  You still have more alcohol!  Now having started drinking several hours ago, and on your 9th - 12th beer (or 5-6th mixed drink) you're not so much euphoric as numb.  You're much more confident and careless.  Now those goofy ideas you came up earlier for a laugh are starting to sound like something you could actually do.  Your speech isn't beginning to slur just yet, or maybe it is, but you wouldn't care either way.  You're having fun.<br>  5) Okay now you're wasted.  You're still having fun, but you don't really feel anything.  Physically or mentally.  You're wide awake, yet your eyes are droopy and you're slurring your speech.  Your judgement is shot (going for a drive sounds like an excellent idea right now!) and you're as likely to hate someone for no reason as you are to love them for no reason.<br>  6) Anything can happen now.  It all depends on what you've been drinking and your physiology.  You may get tired and go to sleep.  Or you may fight your best friend.  You may fight someone you don't know, and then decide you want to be best friends with them, or you might sleep with someone you've never met.  You may or may not remember anything that happens after this point.  But odds are, if you're not tired yet, then you're probably doing something you'll regret (now keep in mind, some people would have stopped drinking at step 4, but many (most?) wouldn't).<br>  7) You probably stopped drinking at step 6.  Because even if you were still trying to drink, you probably kept forgetting what you did with your beer/drink.  It doesn't matter anyway, you've already drank to much.  You ran out of steam, and now you're sitting down, or laying down, and you're really hot (you already noticed around step 2 or 3 that you were starting to feel warm).  The room is probably spinning and it's making you angry because it won't stop.  Then you realize you're sweating.  You're still in denial, but in the next few minutes, if you don't pass out, you will come to terms with the fact that you're going to throw up.  Now if you'd thrown up back there at step 6, before the room started spinning, you'd probably be okay.  But now you're sweating and sick and the room is spinning and it's time to go throw up, and then stick your head up against the side of the porcelain toilet bowl and thank it for being cool on the side.<br>  8) ???<br>  9) Profit!<br>  <br>  Of course, it's not always like that, but for teenagers it's the worst because they don't know when to quit drinking.  Well actually most people don't learn until they're about 23 or so, I think.  At least most of the people I know.<br>  <br>  You can have a good time drinking and not get into any trouble, as long as you know when to stop.  Or if you're one of those people who pass out early.

b73296a75da0c37af734e3ef9c03113baa	Ah yes, that IS tthe question. <br>  I have a website power packed with some of the most original and delicious vegetarian and vegan recipes available including more than two dozen excellent eggless cakes, I too have recipes utilizing time honored culinary techniques but use foods from a plant based diet. . . no meats fish, fowl, game, eggs or the juices and biproducts thereof. The recipes I have developed over a lifetime are offered all free of charge and I do this pretty much as a public service. Making money from the site has not yet really happened.  I have ideas about how to translate that into cold hard cash but frankly it takes $ to get them to happen. At this time I have more than 500 recipes each sitting on its own page in process of an updated site and it has taken many months to get it where it is and most of them are not yet posted to my site -- I am still several months out from getting it all together and uploaded. It is a huge amount of work for a non-technical person. At this point there is an online mall and some google ads but that has generated only about $100.00 in six months so I don't think it will cover the cost of tuition for you. I wish you every success with your project and when you figure out how to capitalize on your God-given talent while not charging for the recipes -- please let me know. <br>  My immediate thought for you, however, is to actually put your manuscript together and send it off to a cookbook publisher whose work you like along with a cover letter talking about your commitment to the vegetarian way of life and your fabulous recipes and mentioning your age. Give it an age appropriate title and see if that gets you published.

Don't worry about getting color on them the first time around.<br>  <br>  Next, never dry on paper towels or anything else that would cause the potatoes to just sit in grease.  Use a cooling rack or something else with perforations and let the potatoes sit on that, maybe on top of a sheet pan or something.  Season your fries at this point, because the moisture will cause the seasonings to stick instead of bouncing around all over the place.<br>  <br>  Note:  I would not blanch them, because that won't cook the potatoes enough.  The point of blanching is usually just to set the color of something, such as green beans or broccoli.  If you blanch these vegetables, they will actually become greener than usual and if you shock them in an ice bath, they will hold their color.  Blanching takes about 30 seconds, and if you just blanch the potatoes, they won't cook enough on the inside.  The fryer works best if it is mostly crisping them, not cooking them as well (unless, of course, you use my first method).|`|jArglpzOaa	Peel russet potatoes, cut into fries, pour extra virgin olive oil to coat, salt and pepper.

l4tZTALfaa	Lemon Chicken Recipe <br>  Print Options<br>  Print (no photos) <br>  Print (with photos) <br>  Ingredients<br>  3-4 pounds chicken parts (thighs and legs recommended), skin-on, bone-in, trimmed of excess fat<br>  2 Tbsp lemon zest <br>  1/3 cup lemon juice <br>  2 cloves garlic, crushed <br>  2 Tbsp fresh chopped thyme (or 2 teaspoons dried) <br>  1 Tbsp fresh chopped rosemary (or 1 teaspoon dried) <br>  1 teaspoons salt <br>  1 teaspoon black pepper<br>  2-3 Tbsp melted butter <br>  Lemon slices for garnish<br>  Method<br>  1 Place lemon juice, lemon peel, garlic, thyme, rosemary, salt, and pepper in a small bowl, whisk to combine. With the tip of a sharp knife, cut into each chicken piece one or two times by about 1/2 an inch. (This will help the marinade penetrate.) Place the chicken pieces and the marinade in a gallon-sized freezer bag. Rotate the bag so that all chicken pieces are coated with the marinade. Seal the bag and place in a bowl in the refrigerator (in case of leakage). Let marinate for 2 hours.<br>  <br>  2 Preheat oven to 425°F. Remove chicken from marinade and place in a single layer in a large baking dish, skin side up. Reserve the marinade. Use a pastry brush to brush a little melted butter on to each piece of chicken.<br>  <br>  3 Bake for a total of 50 to 55 minutes, until the skins are crispy brown, and the chicken is cooked through, juices running clear (breasts have an internal temperature of 165°F and thighs 175°F). Half-way through the baking, at about the 25 minute mark, baste the chicken pieces generously with reserved marinade.<br>  <br>  Depending on the size of the breasts, they may be ready before the thighs, so if you are cooking a mix of chicken parts, keep that in mind, you may have to take them out of the oven before the thighs. <br>  <br>  Let rest, covered in foil, for 10 minutes before serving.<br>  <br>  4 Pour the juices from the pan into a serving bowl. Use a tablespoon to skim the fat off the top (save the fat for cooking with later, or discard, but do not discard down the drain or it will solidify and clog your drain). Serve the chicken with the juices on the side or a little poured over the top of the chicken.<br>  <br>  Serves 4-6. Serve alone or with steamed rice.<br>  <br>  and a good salad|`|AA11786341	Grilled Lemon Chicken  &Salad Recipe<br>  <br>  ***GRILLED LEMON CHICKEN***<br>  3/4 cup freshly-squeezed lemon juice<br>  3/4 cup good-quality olive oil<br>  2 teaspoons kosher salt<br>  1 teaspoon freshly-ground black pepper<br>  1 tablespoon minced fresh thyme leaves<br>  2 pounds boneless skinlesschicken breast halves<br>  ***SALAD***<br>  1/4 cup freshly squeezed lemon juice<br>  1/4 cup good-quality olive oil<br>  1 cup raw sugar snap peas -- trimmed<br>  1/2 red bell pepper -- julienned<br>  1/2 yellow bell pepper -- julienned<br>  1 lemon -- thinly sliced<br>  1/4 teaspoon kosher salt<br>  1/4 teaspoon freshly-ground pepper<br>  <br>  For the Chicken: Whisk together lemon juice, olive oil, kosher salt, pepper and thyme.

Spread the chicken pieces out in a flat-bottomed baking dish (not piled on top of each other). <br>  Pour half of the lemon sauce over the chicken pieces, reserving the rest for later. Turn the chicken pieces in the sauce several times, ensuring they are well saturated. <br>  Leave the pieces turned upside-down in the sauce and allow to marinate in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes, or up to 24 hours ahead of time. (If marinating longer than 30 minutes, be sure to cover the dish). <br>  Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Turn the chicken pieces right-side-up and sprinkle each one with a little salt. Add a touch of water to the bottom of the dish around the chicken (2-3 Tbsp.), ensuring it won't dry out. <br>  Bake uncovered on the middle rack of your oven for 1 hour, or until chicken is golden-brown and well done. <br>  While chicken is roasting, place reserved lemon sauce in a sauce pan. Bring to a boil. <br>  Reduce heat to medium-low and add the cornstarch dissolved in water. Stir well. The sauce will thicken. (If you'd prefer a thicker sauce, add a little more cornstarch dissolved in water until desired thickness is achieved). <br>  Taste-test the sauce. Add a little more fish sauce if not salty enough, or a little more honey if you'd prefer it sweeter. More chili can be added for extra spice. If you'd prefer even more lemony taste, add some grated lemon zest (1/2 to 1 tsp.). <br>  Serve the chicken pieces with the lemon sauce on the side. Garnish with lemon slices and a sprinkling of fresh coriander. This dish pairs equally well with rice or potatoes. ENJOY!<br>  Note about the picture: Here I've also garnished my lemon chicken with some lemon peel "ribbons". To make these, simply peel long pieces of lemon rind using a potato or vegetable peeler. I then cut these pieces into thin strips using scissors. To make them curl, simply place the strips in a plastic bag in the refrigerator for a little while.|`|OX6WPocYaa	thyme and salt goes really nicely.|`|OzAcn50qaa	try foodnetwork.com =)|`|bmoCpcdraa	just shake some lemon pepper on it and bake it dear,|`|9440e28b2ef820fd5eab4d5cfc34217faa	I use a lot of lemon pepper, and sometimes add tarragon or oregano.

Garnish with parsley to serve. <br>  <br>  Greek Chicken:<br>  1 baking chicken<br>  2 Lemons<br>  1/2 Orange<br>  3 sprigs fresh rosemary<br>  a few oregano stems with leaves<br>  4 tablespoons roughly cut garlic<br>  Salt<br>  <br>  In a bowl, mix 1 roughly chopped lemon and orange with 2 sprigs of rosemary, oregano (reserve a tablespoon or so) and 3 tablespoons of the garlic.  Add about a teaspoon or so of salt to the mixture.  You won't be eating this stuffing, but it will add flavor to your chicken and keep it oh so moist. <br>  With the remaining garlic, rosemary and oregano, finely mince, and add a teaspoon of salt.  Rub this mixture between the skin and meat of the chicken.  Cut remaining lemon into rounds.  Place a few rounds between the skin and meat.  With the remaining lemon, just place it in the baking dish you'll be cooking the chicken in.  Tightly cover the chicken and place in preheated 350 degree oven.  Cook for 1 1/2 hours.  Remove from oven.  Increase heat to 425.  Remove cover from chicken and place back into oven for 10 - 15 minutes to brown the top of chicken. You can cook potatoes in the baking dish with the chicken too.|`|hosyXVKFaa	Prawns or fish can be tricky for a beginner as they go pretty quickly from "not done" to "over done".  And over done prawns are not so good.  I'd save those for when you're more comfortable.<br>  <br>  Cooking in the oven is usually easier than trying anything on the stovetop as well because you have more time to adjust and you don't have to watch it while you prepare the sides and such so the roast chicken is a fine idea and can be really good.  I cook a lot and it's always one of my favorite things.<br>  <br>  *  Roasting chicken (not a fryer, if you can help it)<br>  *  1-2 whole lemons<br>  *  Sprigs of fresh thyme and oregano and rosemary (or, if you don't have those just some dried sage can work as well)<br>  *  Olive Oil<br>  * Salt and pepper<br>  <br>  Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.<br>  <br>  Remove the packet of offal (gizzards, kidneys, liver heart, etc) from the inner cavity.  Rinse it well inside and out under cold water and then part it dry.<br>  <br>  Sprinkle salt and pepper on the the inside of the cavity.<br>  <br>  Roll the lemons gently on the counter to loosen up some of the juice and then cut in half.  Wrap some of the sprigs of herbs above around the halves and stuff them into the body of the chicken.  Saving some for the outside.  (use a little less oregano than the other 2 as it tends to overpower).<br>  <br>  Pull the flaps of the cavity closed and you can either try to secure it with toothpicks or string or just try to get it as close as you can together and leave it.<br>  <br>  Remove some of the herbs from their stems - you may want to give the rosemary leaves a bit of a chop.<br>  <br>  Rub the outside of the bird with olive oil (I usually just pour some on my hands and give it a massage).  Sprinkle your herbs over the top of the bird, sprinkle salt and pepper over that and massage everything in lightly so that it's all evenly coated.<br>  <br>  If you have a large enough roasting pan, you can also cut up some Yukon Gold potatoes into quarters, add some quartered small onions and some carrots and cook everything at once.<br>  <br>  Cover it loosely with foil and stick it in the oven.  Use the guide on the bird itself for when it should be done.<br>  <br>  You'll want to periodically check it though - after about 20-30 minutes it should start releasing some of its juices.  When you get enough in the bottom of the pan, use a spoon to spoon it over the whole chicken.  Don't neglect the legs - also baste your veggies if you're cooking them with it.  Periodically do this every 15 or so minutes while the bird cooks.  After about 45 minutes take the foil off so that the skin gets nice and brown and crispy.<br>  <br>  If you don't want to (or can't) do the veggies in the same pan, you can get a squash like an acorn squash, halve it and put it cut side down in a shallow pan and bake it with the chicken.  It won't take as long, only about an hour, so you may need to put it in afterwards.  You can also wrap baking potatoes in foil (rub with olive oil, salt and some herbs if desired) and cook them with the chicken as well.<br>  <br>  If not then you have plenty of time while the bird is roasting to make some rice or a salad or something.<br>  <br>  Make sure you let the bird rest for about 15-20 minutes before carving it.  You can tell if the chicken is done if you cut into the joint where the leg meets the body and the juices run clear.<br>  <br>  If you've got your heart set on fish though, then choose a fatty one like salmon or something as they're generally a little more forgiving.  <br>  <br>  You can try oven poaching your salmon though it works best with wine and not sure how that will fly with your folks - get some salmon steaks about an inch thick, mix together about a cup of wine a couple of tablespoons of fresh lemon juice, some fresh dill and 5-6 peppercorns or a a little ground pepper. <br>  <br>  Put the salmon in a shallow-ish pan like a 9x13 baking dish and pour in the sauce (you don't want to cover the salmon, just have enough in there so they almost steam) then cover the pan with foil and put into a preheated 375 degree oven.<br>  <br>  It should take about 20-30 minutes but you'll want to check it at 15-20 minutes.  The salmon should flake easily and have mostly (but not completely) lost all of the translucence in the thickest part (pry your piece apart to check so you don't mangle the other people's :-)  )<br>  <br>  You can make a sauce by taking some of the liquid the fish was poached in and warm it up in a pan and mix in some butter (and possibly like a little stone ground mustard) and heat it up enough so it comes together (but not too long, you don't want your fish to get cold)<br>  <br>  Steamed veggies go nice with this.  Asparagus (might want to use a veggie peeler to peel off the tougher outer layer), Steam zucchini and yellow squash.  You get the idea.  A nice rice pilaf can finish it off.|`|6GHtXQzTaa	Fun and Easy and what's better for dinner than breakfast.<br>  <br>  ZIPLOC OMELET <br>   <br>  (This works great! Good for when all your family is together.  The best part is that no one has to wait for their special omelet).<br>  <br>  Have each person write their name on a Quart-size Ziploc freezer bag with permanent marker.<br>  Crack 2 eggs (large or extra-large) into the bag (not more than 2) shake to combine them.<br>  Put out a variety of ingredients such as: cheeses, ham, onion, green pepper, tomato, salsa, etc.<br>  Each person adds prepared ingredients of choice to their bag and shake.  Make sure to get the air out of the bag and zip it up.<br>  <br>  Place the bags into rolling, boiling water for exactly 13 minutes. You can usually cook 6-8 omelets in a large pot. For more, make another pot of boiling water.<br>  Open the bags and the omelet will roll out easily. Be prepared for everyone to be amazed.<br>  Nice to serve with fresh fruit and coffee cake; everyone gets involved in the process and a great conversation piece.<br>   <br>    <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>  Imagine having these ready the night before, and putting the bag in boiling water while you get ready for work.

0g4dIaEsaa	FRIED CHICKEN (LIKE KFC)   <br>  <br>  2 eggs, beaten<br>  1 1/2 cups milk<br>  1 cup flour<br>  3/4 cup fine bread crumbs<br>  1 tsp. Knorr chicken bouillon<br>  1/2 tsp. salt<br>  1/2 tsp. garlic powder (not salt)<br>  1/4 tsp. onion powder (not salt)<br>  1/2 tsp. paprika<br>  1/3 tsp. Bell Seasoning<br>  1 tbsp. freshly chopped parsley<br>  2 large cloves garlic, minced<br>  1/2 tsp. soy sauce<br>  2 tsp. black pepper<br>  1 tbsp. Wondra flour<br>  1/2 tsp. Monosodium Glutamate (optional)<br>  additional flour for separate pre-coating<br>  5-6 cups Crisco cooking oil<br>  1 frying chicken, cut in pieces<br>  <br>  Safety Warning: A special pressure fryer is the only type of pressure cooker that you can fry in safely. Read your manufacturer's instructions before frying in a pressure cooker. If you don't have your instruction manual, then prepare this chicken in a deep fryer instead.<br>  Pour the oil into the pressure fryer or deep pan suitable for frying, and then heat over medium heat to about 360 degrees.<br>  <br>  In a small bowl beat the egg, milk, and soy sauce, then stir in 1/2 tsp. Knorr chicken bouillon (save the other 1/2). Put the garlic cloves through a garlic press and add into the egg mixture. Add half of the parsley and 1 tbsp. Wondra flour. Stir well.<br>  <br>  In a separate bowl, combine the 1 cup flour and the bread crumbs, and the remaining ingredients. Mix well with a fork.<br>  <br>  Put about 1/2 cup additional flour in a separate small bowl. Use this to dip each chicken piece, prior to dipping in the milk and seasonings.<br>  <br>  Roll each piece of chicken around until well covered, first in plain flour, then in milk mixture, then in flour/bread crumbs mixture.<br>  <br>  Gently lower the chicken pieces into the hot oil and allow to become a golden color (add the bigger pieces first).<br>  <br>  <br>  Pressure Fryer:<br>  <br>  If you are using a pressure fryer, place the lid on and lock it when the chicken is a very light golden color, usually about 3 minutes. Begin timing when the lid is locked and the gauge indicates a pressure of 5-6 pounds. Bring temperature up immediately and watch carefully (don't walk away!).<br>  Remove from heat after about 7 minutes and reduce pressure following manufacturer's directions. Remove the chicken pieces and place on layers of paper towels. Return the pan to the stove and bring temperature back up and continue until all chicken pieces are fried. If your chicken was too brown, cook the next batch for a minute or so less, and vice versa if your chicken wasn't browned enough. Do not overload the cooker with too many pieces, as it brings the temperature down too quickly and will cause the pieces to absorb more of the cooking oil than it otherwise would.<br>  <br>  <br>  Regular Deep Frying:<br>  <br>  Fry the chicken at 360-375 degrees, placing the larger pieces in when the temperature is slightly lower (temperature will drop when pieces are added). Put the smaller pieces in when the temperature is higher, and they will be cooked more quickly. Remove when chicken is golden brown and drain on paper towels.<br>  TIP: To flavor the oil in this method, you can thickly slice a few large onions and add to the oil before the chicken - skim these out when they are browned, before adding the chicken. It will add an additional layer of flavor to the oil!|`|FcZU29W6aa	My Aunt always said they used a lot of fresh ground black pepper.

Bake in a 375 F oven for 15 to 25 minutes or until <br>  it is heated threw and the crust is golden brown. <br>  <br>  Colonel Sanders loved rice and beans and decided to create a recipe <br>  that could be used together to create a great tasting item.

You'll notice a real difference in the texture of the batter after that time|`|1jIzBUkhaa	yes it will help your cake makes it stay together better, and not dry|`|AA10007956	Eggs are used as a binding ingredient for the cake mix so it really depends on the consistency you want your cake (less mixing, more chunky/moist, more mixing, more fine/dry).<br>  <br>  But generally speaking 2 eggs should be enough for a standard cake mix.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Jenova.

NGyfvuEiaa	I ate my cereal with orange juice at home sometimes when I didn't have milk so I think it is only the most used thing because of commercializing. Considering that cows and other animals that produce milk have been around since Bible times and I doubt that the branded cereal we have now was the first, they probably milked the cow or goat or whatever back then and either drank the milk next to the cereal and ate the cereal next to the milk and later someone tried milk over cereal. Earlier cereal before branded cereal had to be soaked overnight before it could be eaten, so that could have been the case. I don't actually know.
