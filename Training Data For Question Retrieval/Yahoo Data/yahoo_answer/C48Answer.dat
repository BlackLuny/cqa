AA10988289	Time has proved exactly the opposite - the Ugandan economy collapsed, partly as a result.<br>  <br>  You could point to the problems of Muslim extremism but two points spring to mind, the first being that Idi Amin was himself a Muslim and second that the people expelled were, in terms of social class and level of education very different from the first wave of immigration from Pakistan.<br>  <br>  In terms of how well behaved and keen to integrate the different ethic groups are, I do think it is a little far-fetched to complain about the Hindus.  What on earth have they done to cause trouble in this country?  the only example I can think of was protesting (peacefully) about a cow being slaughtered in the last foot and mouth outbreak.  This is hardly dangerous extremism!<br>  <br>  Hindus as a group are massively successful in the education system, expremely law abiding and a pleasure to have in the country.  They have also massively improved English cuisine.<br>  <br>  Economically, I don't think it is fair to say that they send all their money back to India.

The majority of these Indians that you refer to are now British, either by naturalisation or by birth, and so are no less British than you or anyone else is. The only way you can "get rid of" them is by introducing racist laws and I hope that racial discrimination is not something that you would be in favour of. As for where they should spend their money, after an honest day's work, your earning is yours to spend wherever your please. If you want to give some of that money to your relatives who need it more than you then that is applaudable. In fact, if more people did this, then the effect of the recession could be reduced for some families.

AA12109395	The rules for determining if one is mentally competent to stand trial are extensive, specific, very detailed, closely monitored, and periodically re-evaluated by the American Bar Association and the Medical Community.<br>  <br>  Depending on whether the defendant is alleged to be incompetent as a result of mental illness, mental retardation, or other medical disability, an officer of the court would order ( by means of very specific guidelines and procedures ) an evaluation from a "qualified professional"who would upon conclusion, render "expert testimony" to<br>  the court as to the defendant's competence to stand trail.<br>  <br>  The terms "qualified professional and expert testimony" refer to professionals who have met certain prerequisites set by law and have been determined by the courts as acceptable. QP's must have:<br>  <br>  (1) sufficient professional education and sufficient clinical training and experience to establish the clinical knowledge required for the specific evaluation being conducted and<br>  <br>  (2) sufficient forensic knowledge gained through specific training or an acceptable substitude, therefore necessary for understanding the relevant legal issues and satisfying the specific purposes for which the eval is being ordered. <br>  <br>  Although no system is totally unbeatable, the thoroughness of this procedure would make it pretty difficult to "fake it" since ones entire adult medical history is evaluated.<br>  <br>  Unable to locate any case history, however the website below is very educational and informative.

AA12212403	I do feel that Unions had their place years ago before employment laws were enacted.

The have become all powerful.<br>  Union bosses live like millionaires on the blood of us all.   There are pay offs, fancy vacations and lunches.  I used to be an HR employee for a union shop.  The union bosses would come round for fancy pay offs, lunches, cocktails, gift certificates and wheel and deal with the HR director.  After all these "gifts" they would leave and the employees were not any better off.  The warehouse union employees got their regular raises weather they did a great job or not.  The incentive to work harder and earn merit raises and promotions just didn't exist, the people were like drones.  They couldn't ever get anywhere beyond where they were.  They had comfortable benefits and the like, so their incentive to even work elsewhere was taken away, but they were never going to go further.<br>  In the end, the company I worked for went under.  There were a few union strikes to get raises.  The company had to bend or close, and then they ultimately folded.  You can guess why.<br>  By the way, the non-union employees got the same medical and dental that they had, but I had it cheaper as I wasn't having union dues deducted from my check.  : )|`|8tf5rOXdaa	Unions in the present are destroying every company they touch.<br>  <br>  I don't know if I would abolish them just make every state a right to work state and let the employees decide.<br>  <br>  At least regulate them.|`|8PCriC7Vaa	Put it this way, imagine losing all the $14 hr. workers, or losing the multimillionaire management who have no interest in cars at all.

DNaMIcomaa	You flushed me out Martin!!<br>  <br>  ALL!! I have stated many times that I want the public to be educated, and not propagandized.<br>  <br>  About a week ago while I was traveling I had the pleasure of listening to an A.M. radio station from Berkeley Springs WV (I wrote down the call sign and bandwidth of the station while I was driving but lost the scrap of paper that i grabbed while I was driving) that followed what I would consider a proper use of the fairness doctrine. On the show that I listened to I heard views from both a republican senator from N Carolina and a Democratic congressman from PAconcerning the stimulus package. Both gave me interesting views on a subject that I profess to not having enough education to make an informed decision on. I did in fact feel that I was smarter from having listened to it.Unfortunately the signal on this station was weak and I quickly ran out of reception range.<br>  Compare that to the distortion of facts and emotionalizing that I experienced on the talk station that I found to replace it.Glenn Beck (which I could find on several stations I could not find any like the station from WV I travel a great deal and I can assure you that fair talk radio is EXTREMELY rare, Right -wing is ALWAYS available,Left wing is scarce,and fair radio is a jewel that you almost never find) mr. Beck not only distorted the facts about the stimulus package, but also thought that it was comical to make a commercial promoting Country-Time Lemonade and it's great flavor with post stimulus bill cannibalism.<br>  <br>  Edit; Found It WCST 1010 on the A.M dial<br>  <br>  Martin I know that your question asked if I support applying the fairness doctrine to all media which I do. I especially support a fairness doctrine for talk radio. I believe that talk radio is DANGEROUSLY powerful for two reasons.<br>  <br>  1.You can multitask while listening to radio. You can listen while driving,eating, gardening, you can listen while in the office, you can wear headphones and listen while working, and etc. I am sure that you get the picture.The audience is large.<br>  <br>  2. 99% of the working people in this country do not have the intellectual curiosity to seek both sides of an issue, and they prefer to be entertained. The right knows this and takes advantage of that fact. Talk radio does have some entertainment to it. It is also highly funded. The lack of a fairness doctrine insures that dissenting opinions are not aired. Couple the lack of a fairness doctrine with a constant inoculation of the right with overblown claims of "liberal media bias, and you have effectively split the working class,the largest block of voters in the country.<br>  <br>  Edit; Hello again Martin. Since you posted this question in the law and ethics section I believe that I will start with the finding of the Supreme court.<br>  <br>  A license permits broadcasting, but the licensee has no constitutional right to be the one who holds the license or to monopolize a...frequency to the exclusion of his fellow citizens. There is nothing in the First Amendment which prevents the Government from requiring a licensee to share his frequency with others.... It is the right of the viewers and listeners, not the right of the broadcasters, which is paramount.<br>  — U.S. Supreme Court, upholding the constitutionality of the Fairness Doctrine in Red Lion Broadcasting Co. v. FCC, 1969. <br>  <br>  Now that we have the legality of the doctrine established.(which I am sure that you are well aware of) I guess that you understand that I DO NOT find free speech dangerous. What is dangerous is the lack of ability for Americans to get both sides of an issue. Talk radio is definitely one sided for several reasons and I am sure that one of the largest reasons is funding. I doubt that most corporate sponsors are going to give much money through advertising to the ideology that gives the American people the best chance of limiting the power of corporatism in Washington.Their are several good progressive talk show hosts out there and the reason that their shows are not popular is not that they are not good shows. They just do not have a twenty year leg up on conservative talk radio nor the corporate sponsorship.                                                           <br>  <br>  Yes we do need some form of balance. I personally would prefer more of a debate type format it would be much more educational than either left-wing or right-wing propagandizing. I would however settle for a requirement that if you engage in political commentary in the form of talk shows, you have to allow equal time and quality for ALL opposing opinion in the form of talk shows. I don't want commentary stifled, I want more and varied commentary available to the voters of this country.<br>  <br>  I guess that you got the answer to your question I would prefer that ALL media be made to conform to some form of balance in their commentary,BUT, I have no ideological qualms to some form of fairness being applied to only that media that is controlled and licensed by the FCC.Please keep in mind that I do not want restrictions on news. If a news source simply states "A bill was introduced in the house today....." there is no need for balance, but as soon as someone says "Here is why this bill should not pass..." the need to give voters all sides of the issue should become mandatory.<br>  <br>  Martin, I do not think that the current noise concerning the fairness doctrine is going to get anywhere. There is too much distortion of what the fairness doctrine is. I also understand that what I desire is not what the original FCC policy was. I also think that you and others that believe on ideological grounds that no one has the right to tell the owner of a broadcast station what his content should include are safe for the forseeable future. And that I believe is a disservice to the American public.|`|MDFqos60aa	Only one I would not support it for would be the internet because you can find news sources there for any viewpoint, that is not true for all other news sources. <br>  <br>  Every other news source does the equivalent of peeing on peoples legs and telling them it is raining.|`|AA11248330	It's amazing how right-wing trolls and their hosts love to pontificate, isn't it? Unfortunately for them, they only prove my points. One of them offers: "...MSNBC, CNN are losing their audience in greater numbers, while Fox, Hannity or Rush Limbaugh numbers are increasing. ..." Unfortunately, the argument is not only lacking in facts, but illustrates why the Fairness Doctrine is important. For instance, Fox "News" ranted on, as did Rush and Ken doll Sean, about WMDs in Iraq, as well as every other lie put forth by the Bush administration, reaching millions of listeners and viewers, while also slandering the U.N. weapons inspectors, who just happened to be right. If you add political Christian broadcasting to this toxic mix, you get a monopoly that is dangerous. Progressives didn't get on Armed Forces radio until late in 2005, but even then Ed Schultz was threatened with cancellation before he even debuted, because he criticized someone in the Bush administration. This isn't championing free speech. It is patently unfair practice. It also illustrates the tilted news our military is getting. That, too, is dangerous. <br>  <br>  Right-wing radio offers propaganda, not facts, with the intent to play on the listeners emotions, without offering content that is based in reality. The ratings prove that FNC, Fox "News" channel is losing out in the ratings. In addition, the ignorance of conservatives about media and radio is further shown when they say the Fairness Doctrine is about "...demanding that the government implement further control or regulation over an entire industry, it might be simpler to look in the mirror, at the rating points & ad revenues & realize that the market for the “progressive” or liberal slant isn’t as popular or pervasive as you assume it to be. ... Again, they miss the point. Ed Schultz and Stephanie Miller, as well as the leader in progressive talk, Randi Rhodes, are making it in the commercial market. They are not only popular, but growing. The issue is to allow more progressive hosts on local am/fm radio to see if we can also make it. Unless you've been in the battle for radio you don't know what it's like, with conservative corporations not even giving progressives a chance to get on air, or cancelling good hosts before they have the time to prove themselves. You have to give progressive hosts a chance to build an audience, which takes time. But conservatives do not want fairness, which can be seen through their trade policy, as well as their anti-union rhetoric, which has decimated the middle class, by selling out workers for outsourcing all in the name of profit. They want a one-way talking machine on radio, paid by and benefiting only their political partners in business, as well. <br>  Right-wing is on the air and getting advertisers because they're the only game in town, except for a few progressive hosts like Schultz, Miller and Rhodes. The Fairness Doctrine will not keep a bad show on, but it will allow entry to good hosts who are now being shut out by conservative conglomerates<br>  The short version of the Fairness Doctrine is that in 1987 Reagan had it scuttled. Shortly after that Rush Limbaugh began his journey and right-wing radio was created and gradually took over the airwaves, with the help of their corporate friends. The Fairness Doctrine could really make a difference. Why do you think conservatives are screaming like crazy?|`|9Vs6IgYUaa	Please..  no American citizen actually supports that crap.

Please tell me that in this age of high-technology warfare, you don't really think that your pop guns would be of any concern.  Let's say that you form a civilian militia and attempt to take on the national guard with your squirt guns and pop guns.  What are you going to do when they stand out of firing range and simply zap you with an array of nonlethal weapons until you can't stand it anymore?  Have you not seen directed energy weapons that the military has that can blast your hearing with a beam of ultrasonic sound, or heat your body with microwave energy from a distance?  The government and the military are in possession of nonlethal weapons that are far more effective at crowd control than the ones that I have mentioned above.

You must have one dominant culture and one dominant language otherwise their will be chaos. The pro-illegal alien traitors in the US push this multiculturalism garbage on the rest of us in the name of diversity. Well, studies have show that the less diverse a community is the less crime and strife.<br>  <br>  The Wonders of Multiculturalism, my title, Wealthint<br>  Taboos <a href="http://www.powerlineblog.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.powerlineblog.com/</a><br>  <br>  One of the basic tenets of the contemporary liberal faith is the beauty of "diversity." Every day the dogmas of multiculturalism are promulgated relentlessly by our schools, newspapers and media, and public authorities. The transformation of the United States by waves of immigration from non-European countries is always depicted as a phenomenon to be celebrated, as are the immigrants' religions and cultures.<br>  <br>  Minneapolis and St. Paul have been deeply affected by the large number of Somali and Hmong immigrants who have made the Twin Cities metropolitan area their home. Their occasionally disturbing cultural practices and the related social costs are rarely discussed.<br>  <br>  Despite the liberal dogmas of multiculturalism, for example, one of Minnesota's leading left-wing legislators was responsible for legislation criminalizing the Somali practice of female genital circumcision in Minnesota in 1994. Her feminism trumped her multiculturalism. Female genital mutilation was not much of a problem in Minnesota before Somalis settled here in the 1980's and 1990's.<br>  <br>  MULTICULTURALISM, IMMIGRATION AND AZTLAN* By Maria Hsia Chang <br>  Professor of Political Science, University of Nevada Reno            <a href="http://www.diversityalliance.org/docs/Chang-aztlan.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.diversityalliance.org/docs/Ch...</a><br>  <br>  One of the standard arguments invoked by those in favor of massive immigration into the United States is that our country is founded on immigrants who have always been successfully assimilated into America's mainstream culture and society. As one commentator put it, "Assimilation evokes the misty past of Ellis Island, through which millions entered, eventually seeing their descendants become as American as George Washington."1 <br>  <br>  Nothing more vividly testifies against that romantic faith in America's ability to continuously assimilate new members than the events of October 16, 1994 in Los Angeles. On that day, 70,000 people marched beneath "a sea of Mexican flags" protesting Proposition 187, a referendum measure that would deny many state benefits to illegal immigrants and their children. Two weeks later, more protestors marched down the street, this time carrying an American flag upside down.2 Both protests point to a disturbing and rising phenomenon of Chicano separatism in the United States — the product of a complex of forces, among which are multiculturalism and a generous immigration policy combined with a lax border control. <br>  <br>  The Problem Chicanos refer to "people of Mexican descent in the United States" or "Mexican Americans in general."3 Today, there are reasons to believe that Chicanos as a group are unlike previous immigrants in that they are more likely to remain unassimilated and unintegrated, whether by choice or circumstance — resulting in the formation of a separate quasi-nation within the United States. More than that, there are Chicano political activists who intend to marry cultural separateness with territorial and political self-determination. The more moderate among them aspire to the cultural and political autonomy of "home rule". The radicals seek nothing less than secession from the United States whether to form their own sovereign state or to reunify with Mexico. Those who desire reunification with Mexico are irredentists who seek to reclaim Mexico's "lost" territories in the American Southwest.4 Whatever their goals, what animates all of them is the dream of Aztlan.|`|iWLeHnlnaa	I think you got told!

Once in a great while a woman will be involved in something like this, but so rarely.<br>  <br>  The "gruesome" murders you speak of are usually sadistic - murders which involve a great deal of suffering on the part of the victim.  These are carried out by psychopathic men - aggressive - sexually aggressive - but without the slightest idea what other people feel - no compassion. Something missing in their minds and/or their upbringing.  <br>  <br>  It's a very complex thing.  I'd bet Jeffery Dalmer didn't really understand WHY he had done the murders he had.  He did them for sexual reasons - but why don't all men do this??  All men don't do this - but Dalmer did - so why?  Was he abused? - apparently not. <br>  <br>  These things are quite a mystery - and a good reason to NOT have capital punishment is that when you zap somebody like Jeffery Dalmer, you lose a lot of potential information about the psychological makeup of these people.|`|80Dyljhdaa	what about that lil Anthony girl?

Was this youngster who killed her playmates without any feelings of guilt the result of a monstrous family or a bad seed or something else?<br>  <br>  The Black Dahlia<br>  Hollywood's most famous murder case took place in post-war Los Angeles. Elizabeth Short, an engagingly attractive young woman was found brutally murdered and dumped in a vacant lot. She was called the "Black Dahlia" because she always dressed in black. This unsolved case became an obsession and will continue to be legendary when the Black Dahlia movie comes out this fall with an all-star cast.<br>  <br>  Lizzie Borden<br>  This classic has to be one of the most enduring murder mysteries America has ever produced. Elderly Andrew Borden, still in his heavy morning coat, reclines on a mohair-covered sofa, his boots on the floor so as not to soil the upholstery. As he naps, his wife, Abby, is on the floor of the guestroom upstairs, dead for the past hour and a half, killed by the same hand, with the same axe, that is about to strike him, as he sleeps. <br>  <br>  The bloodiness of the acts are startling. Along with the gruesome nature of the crimes is the unexpected character of the accused, not a hatchet-wielding maniac, but a church-going, Sunday-school-teaching, respectable, spinster-daughter, charged with parricide, the murder of parents, a crime worthy of Classical Greek tragedy. Many people believed she killed her father and stepmother, but recent forensic research suggests that she didn't.<br>  <br>  Diane Downs<br>  "Somebody just shot my kids!" The blond woman yelled to the emergency room nurses. <br>  <br>  The two nurses teetered when they looked through the windows of the Nissan. Side panels were soaked in blood and amidst the blood lay three small children, one in the front passenger seat, two in the back. First glance told the nurses the children had been shot at very close range. Two of the children still breathed, although strenuously; the boy gasped for air. The child found slumped in the front seat appeared beyond help; despite frantic efforts by the doctors at the operating table, the damage had been lethal. She was pronounced dead moments after being wheeled to emergency. <br>  <br>  Someone without a heart had deliberately attempted to murder three kids in cold blood, and, despite the odds, despite a fate that looked gloomy, the caretakers hastened to keep that fate at bay and beat it at its own game: with deliberate intention. <br>  <br>  Who in the name of God could have aimed a pistol at three small children and pulled the trigger?" <br>  <br>  The facts came to light in a most suspicious manner and unlike those explained by the mother, Diane Downs.<br>  <br>  As you can see from the above cases women can be as vicious as men when it comes to killing.

I just don't get it.<br>  <br>  Its fine and dandy to question your government if your a leftist, but the other way around and your a racist or hate monger.|`|s1LfdCdsaa	You are correct, but I can honestly say that I don't care what people think about the fact that I speak the truth.<br>  <br>  If the truth is dissent, then what is it that evokes such dissent?<br>  <br>  That's where the focus needs to lie.<br>  <br>  "Privately," plenty of people who fell for Obama's campaign of con, are now remorseful about their vote.<br>  <br>  OK people, what are you going to do about it? It is clearly time for you all to form as unified a voice as possible, and call for Obama to step down.<br>  <br>  This act would be about as patriotic as it could get in these tough times!!<br>  <br>  YES YOU CAN!!|`|LZw4JntHaa	You're right. I remember Hillary saying--or rather, screeching--that it is patriotic to criticize any administrationn. That, of course, was when GWB was president. I doubt she would say those words now.<br>  <br>  Left-wing governments must suppresss dissent and opposition to stay in power. They trumpet their virtues only when they are out of power.|`|5b85793bae21d013c789850655fa694caa	Try and follow dear, you need a logical reason or you sound like a ten year old.<br>  He hasn't been in office long enough to have actual dissent, just right wing dissatisfaction.<br>  That's to be expected, That's your opinion, but not the opinion of those who elected him.  We didn't want him to do things the Bush way anymore.  It didn't work.<br>  When or if his policies fail you can dissent, right now the Republicans are just whining, and its getting old very fast.<br>  <br>  I hope you had time to read this before the Thought police you are so afraid of came to your door.<br>  Really!|`|wdBY1fWaaa	Exactly. It's right there in the constitution, the right for each citizen to petition the government. Oh but wait, that was BEFORE OBAMA.<br>  <br>  Now, you must just go along with anything that he and his administration proposes. If not, you are an "obstructionist", "not for change", "bitter" and of course the last fig leaf...."a racist".<br>  <br>  Oh he's so smart that Obama. Yeah, let's just spend spend spend. Never mind it's been proven throughout history that this economic approach has NEVER worked. Then today he actually has the gall to mutter the words "fiscal restraint". Are you freaking kidding me? Fiscal constraint after you spend trillions and trillions?<br>  <br>  He did say though that he's going to cut the national debt in half by the time his first term is up. I think I hear a "George Bush's fault" coming....don't you?<br>  <br>  This guy is a disgrace.<br>  <br>  Added: There it is...someone posted "good intent". Yeah, let's fill the national treasury with "good intentions". Oh bless his heart. Yes, let's pray.|`|N5pPJUS8aa	I seem to recall a certain conservative radio show host that said if you don't respect the President you are Un-American.<br>  <br>  So, you can't have it both ways.<br>  <br>  Who, exactly, are the hypocrites?|`|PtHThRoNaa	What do you mean not allowed.

AA10779599	Remember at best the government is totally indifferent to the individual.  If he is your friend he is screwing some one else. The government isn't even a zero sum gain.  Bureaucrats cost money.  You have to pay their salaries, benefits, & retirement.  They get better benefits than the private sector employee.<br>  <br>  At the same time the government wishes to give the entitlements to the fewest people they can.  What does that do to the quick fix free loader?  It will lock him into a lower life style than he could create for himself.  This is done by the entitled person losing more fringe benefits than he earns dollars to replace them once he chooses to have some self respect by supporting himself!|`|e380b6c435d028a856da0ab58ab394f2aa	There was a time when states told the central government to back down.

AA12212403	They are part of what I refer to as the dumbing down of America, sadly.<br>  Let's look at our teachers (union) who are not paid highly.  Let's look at some of the most well educated and intelligent people who would make great teachers, yet they won't go into low paying teacher's jobs where they can get anyplace.<br>  So, we have substandard teachers (not all, some are amazingly good, thank goodness) who don't teach well.  The go-getters won't work in a unioned job that won't pay them according to performance.  The education of all suffers.  <br>  Lots of kids in school goof off and it's almost a peer pressure thing to not being doing well, do drugs, drink, etc.  Everthing is dumbing down our country.  People don't strive to work hard and be rewarded, students think it's better to party and then wonder if they can't get a decent job when they graduate and their grades are not good enough to get into colleges.  Where is American pride?<br>  I have to add that there are still some great students and some great teachers out there, so we can have some hope.  But, this is a snowball effect thing that people must take a long look at.  Reward teachers and attract the best of the best to teach them.  Teachers should be paid on merit and then the good people who want to teach and can't afford to teach and pay their bills might choose to do that as a career again.<br>  At any rate, when our populous is not educated on basic economics and principles of finance, they just view the stock market as "the rich get richer".<br>  People don't understand and think they know that "the man" is getting richer and they deserve more, etc.  It's the Obama mentality at it's best.  Yet, he has a great education and I'm sure his own investments are well protected.<br>  As for me, my money is OUT of the market for now, no more for us until we all ride out this storm.  FDIC insured CDs for us, even if the earnings are low, they are still earnings vs. any more losses.<br>  I do not rejoice in the market's plummeting, though I have to sit back and look upon Obama's choices as affecting this greatly.  He will point a finger at Bush, but if McCain were our president, I would confidently be leaving our money in the market and know that he and Palin would have fixed things instead of made things much worse as Obama has already done.<br>  I sadly protect my family investments and worry for the rest.|`|A2qbzxrfaa	These are people that wallow in wealth envy, as a result from government education. (basically) They are programed to believe that high achievement  is BAD, and that anybody with money must be greedy and evil.

94067f0094ecabf35aa20a2ef3c6e10daa	Oddly enough the definition of Self-defense actually varies from state to state. <br>  However, the one thing that remains the same, is if some one is attacking you, you have the right to "defend" yourself, but that does not necessarily include you hitting back.<br>  So regardless of where you live, if he ATTACKS you, yes you can take reasonable means to stop the attack.<br>  Depending on where you live, you may or may not be able to hit back.<br>  Its a screwed up system.|`|U0Rvsabdaa	Yes.

Yes, if he attempts to strike you, you have the right to subdue him.|`|AA12151705	in my opinion (please note that this is all personal opinion, and i'm not a professional), since he's made the threat to start a fight, then i think as long as he takes the first step and doing things that will harm you physically, then you should get the right of fighting back for self defence<br>  <br>  but if he only threatened, and you decided to take that seriously and take the first step, then it shouldn't be called self defence|`|8cN4e8Vmaa	I agree with the first guy. You have the right to defend yourself and if you kick his *** than good!! Let him learn his lesson. I have been bullied throughout my education and I never defended myself.

Just remember, if it comes down to self defense you may only use enough force to fen him off, and no more or that is con-screwed as over and above what is required by law and you could be charged. Not only that, you may unintentionally do more harm to him than you wish.<br>  I hope you can come to a resolve without violence. Possibly have an adult or peer councilor mediate if the other party is willing. Or, if he's not willing ask this chump to go to the YMCA and arrange a boxing match between the two of you with an adult who will referee in a fair fight.

Europeans had settled and fought for the establishment of the US.  Other countries had the opportunity to do the same, but failed to do so.

Later the immigrants came through Ellis Island and were registered and had health checks.<br>  No matter how much history you quote you can not justify illegal aliens invading the US. This is not a FREE world, and everyone must follow laws, and respect borders.<br>  <br>  EDIT: You previously answered a question asked by No Amnesty and you stated "He's living in the past".

If she said she definitely saw you do it, and she made a positive identification of you in the act, and if you have been definitively cleared then yes, there may be a case.  If she reported the crime and simply stated that she thought it was possibly you that did it, then she is clearly NOT guilty of slander, but would be giving the police enough cause to suspect you and investigate you.  And my best guess is that that is exactly what she would say.....<br>  As for making repeated accusations against you, after a couple of times, the police will refuse to take further steps and treat her as a 'vexatious complainant' and she will be told that without conclusive evidence the guards will not pursue further complaints (the boy who creid wolf idea).|`|HyulW3aiaa	Get a good solicitor and launch a lawsuit for damages etc. Also,start keeping accurate records of your day,places ,times,people etc.Just in case.|`|jHXUNbYGaa	Is it true?  If you are being investigated and someone believes that you are a suspect, no.  Plus, if you have no damages, which it does not appear that you do, nothing can be done.<br>  <br>  A defense recognized in most jurisdictions is "opinion". If the person makes a statement of opinion as opposed to fact, the statement may not support a cause of action for defamation. Whether a statement is viewed as an expression of fact or opinion can depend upon context - that is, whether or not the person making the statement would be perceived by the community as being in a position to know whether or not it is true. If your employer calls you a pathological liar, it is far less likely to be regarded as opinion than if such a statement is made by somebody you just met. Some jurisdictions have eliminated the distinction between fact and opinion, and instead hold that any statement that suggests a factual basis can support a cause of action for defamation. <br>  <br>  EDIT:<br>  <br>  For one, you have to KNOW and not THINK.  For some reason if an attorney would take this to court or if you would, you have to show damages.  What are your damages?

They feared that the president would have too much power and that the national government would impose on the state's power among other things.<br>  <br>  While the Anti-federalist's lost the debate, when the Constitution was ratified, their efforts during the ratification debate led to the creation of the bill of rights to protect the people from their government.<br>  <br>  Hope that helped!

Some time during the early medieval period murder became an "unamendable" crime, meaning that it could not be excused by paying off the victim's family (which was the traditional anglo-saxon practice). The category of early, unamendable crimes became felonies in medieval england.<br>  <br>  Although the word "murder" was not used until some time later, by the 15th century at the latests it had many of the aspects of what we now call murder - it required an intentional killing - but murder was also limited to killings on a pre-conceived plan, or by poisoning or by stealth.<br>  <br>  To this day, in England, there is no one law that defines murder or makes it illegal (and the idea of felonies faded away in the 19th century here, when forfeiture of property was ended). It is all just a patchwork of judgments in different cases, down the centuries.|`|RixAK2mPaa	It comes from "common law" in England. It depends on which state you live in (if in the US).

In the last 35 years in the U.S., 130 people have been released from death row because they were exonerated by DNA evidence. These are ALL people who were found guilty “beyond a reasonable doubt.”  Unfortunately, DNA evidence is not available in most cases.  So, as long as the death penalty is in place, you are pretty much GUARANTEED to occasionally execute an innocent person.<br>  <br>  Really, that should be reason enough for most people to oppose it. If you need more, read on:<br>  <br>  2. Because of higher pre-trial expenses, longer trials, jury sequestration, extra expenses associated with prosecuting & defending a DP case, and the appeals process (which is necessary - see reason #1), it costs taxpayers MUCH more to execute prisoners than to imprison them for life.<br>  <br>  3. The deterrent effect is questionable at best. Violent crime rates are actually HIGHER in death penalty jurisdictions. This may seem counterintuitive, and there are many theories about why this is (Ted Bundy saw it as a challenge, so he chose Florida – the most active execution state at the time – to carry out his final murder spree).  It is probably due, at least in part, to the high cost (see #2), which drains resources from police departments, drug treatment programs, education, and other government services that help prevent crime.  Personally, I think it also has to do with the hypocrisy of taking a stand against murder…by killing people. The government fosters a culture of violence by saying, ‘do as I say, not as I do.’<br>  <br>  4. There’s also an argument to be made that death is too good for the worst criminals. Let them wake up and go to bed every day of their lives in a prison cell, and think about the freedom they DON’T have, until they rot of old age. When Ted Bundy was finally arrested in 1978, he told the police officer, “I wish you had killed me.”  Khalid Shaikh Mohammed (the architect of the 9/11 attacks) would love nothing better than to be put to death.  In his words, "I have been looking to be a martyr [for a] long time."<br>  <br>  5. Most governments are supposed to be secular, but for those who invoke Christian law in this debate, you can find arguments both for AND against the death penalty in the Bible.  The New Testament (starring Jesus) is primarily ANTI-death penalty.  For example, in the Sermon on the Mount, Jesus praises mercy (Matthew 5:7) and rejects “an eye for an eye” (Matthew 5:38-39).  James 4:12 says that GOD is the only one who can take a life in the name of justice.  In John 8:7, Jesus himself says, "let he who is without sin cast the first stone."|`|auUeI2Vnaa	Nope.  Truely sick individuals do not deserve to be alive.  If we had a giant island to send these people to so they could kill each other off...then I'd be against the death penalty.  We don't have an island like that though....|`|bdaff1aefd0fc9f0124cfd06758eb166aa	I have mixed feelings about it.<br>  <br>  If someone was driving while high or drunk and killed someone I say let them sit in jail and live with the guilt<br>  <br>  If it is clear cut that they intended to harm/murder/rape someone and the courts had proof (not circumstantial) then I would say the death penalty because they have no conscience unless they are truly mentally ill.<br>  <br>  It's a hard call. There have been people in jail for crimes they really didn't commit. Not many but they are there, you can't reverse a death sentence if it has already been done for them.|`|OiAl6w48aa	I am FOR it.  There are some people that will always want to hurt and kill others for their own amusement, no matter what treatment of punishment they are given.  <br>  <br>  I used to be against the death penalty, but then I read the book "Journey into Darkness" by John Douglas.  He's one of the original criminal offender profilers for the FBI.  The stuff he has to say is truly amazing.  But I think he summed up his argument for the death penalty for serial killers when he said that its like baking a cake with gasoline in it.  The cake may look OK, but you'll never be able to eat it and you'll never be able to get the gas out of it.  Some people are just evil for lack of a better word.|`|03ec65bf77c70de35e61bf195676e487aa	I don't have to think about it at this point.  I'm 75 years old and have thought about it for many years.  I don't believe in the death penalty.  "Vengence is mine, sayeth the Lord."|`|KZh3x4g9aa	for ! guaranteed no repeat offenders.....|`|YCL50xgnaa	Against.  There have been too many false murder convictions to know for sure that the person you're putting to death is 100% guilty.  It's also more expensive to put someone to death than putting them in prison for the rest of their lives.  Finally, because death is the easy way out.  It's much more of a punishment to be alive and spent the rest of your life in prison.  When you're dead, you're dead.|`|4ba573d10043e0b2f1d30e9ba0bb3383aa	FOR! We desperately need some form of population control on this planet and what better place to start than on death row!<br>  <br>  Add: Morpheus, I am not religous by the way. And you are right, it costs a lot of money but the legal process in which the death penalty is carried out needs to be overhauled. It shouldn't cost the tax payers millions just to feed, house and care for a death row inmate for 20 years before their sentence is carried out.|`|ygGr1nX7aa	I've thought about it a lot, and I am totally against.<br>  <br>  I just can't justify it.  I fail to see how forbidding murder, and then committing it, is anything other than hypocritical, and wrong for all the reasons murder is.<br>  <br>  If it were an effective deterrent, there would be no-one on death row.<br>  <br>  It costs the state *more* to execute a person than to imprison them for life.<br>  <br>  Worst of all, though, is the effect it has on society.  It means murder is, however tenuously, condoned as acceptable, and that does something ugly to some people.  Check the question below if you don't believe me- I don't know about you, but I just find the idea of someone in favour of killing a child in cold blood sickening.  Murder is one thing, but coldly planning it out in advance, with an audience?  It dehumanises us, borders at its worst on /revelling/ in the death of a fellow human being, however misguided.  We should surely be seeking to rise above that, and no matter how traumatised a family may be by criminal acts, don't we owe it to them to give justice rather than revenge?  To avoid inflicting the same pain on another family?<br>  <br>  And all that assumes that they WERE guilty.  How much worse is it to kill an innocent man or woman?  It happens, and even once is too often.<br>  <br>  I could go on- this is something I feel very passionately about.  I hope that helps.<br>  <br>  Some responses to other answers:<br>  <br>  - If you believe in God's judgement, then you believe everyone will face it, and there is no need for us to intervene in that.  No one lives forever.  The Bible also says 'Vindicta mihi'- Vengence is [God's] alone.<br>  <br>  - Surely 'stopping prison overcrowding' is tantamount to saying money is more important than justice or human life?  How can one judge someone else's life with priorities like that?<br>  <br>  - No repeat offenders: True.  Also no second chances.  No disrespect, if that's what you believe in- I personally don't.<br>  <br>  - Common, I tend to agree- I believe that some people are just broken, beyond all help.  I'd rather lock them up for life than descend to that level, though.|`|WdfXLeXGaa	I'm Against it, death is an escape, murderers need to suffer through living in a cage. What if that person that was being killed was Innocent and nobody proved it you don't know killing someone your just doing the same thing and it don't make you any better<br>  so am against it. Think of your family what if it was your family but they should suffer in a cage...That's just my opinion...|`|B42PBRk6aa	For. <br>  <br>  The punishment MUST fit the crime. <br>  Prison, where the prisoners run the program, is not an acceptable punishment for some crimes. <br>  I do not believe in spending tax dollars for 30 years to feed, offer medical care for, clothe, educate, entertain, or otherwise support and protect anyone who didn't show the slightest hint of concern or mercy to someone else.|`|8cN4e8Vmaa	People do horrific things to others. Things that are unimaginable! Why do they deserve to live? It even says in the bible. I'm afraid to let my children walk to the park right inside my apartment complex because of these damn freaks! That is not right!! Each and every one (rapist, molestors, murderers, terrorist, tortures) all deserve to face God's judgement.|`|2425cc2cee9552b0f1a53567bfd23012aa	Against.  I see you asked about this a few times.  If this is for a school project, the best place to start is at <a href="http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/article.php?did=1917" rel="nofollow">http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/article....</a>  It'sspecifically for students, has links to both sides (click on curriculum) and is easy to navigate.|`|aacbd878822577abf5c1d2cc198cd1c5aa	I am for it, especially in cases of irrefutable proof and admission.|`|aqeWwA71aa	Against - it's expensive, for one.  The people being executed go through unbelievable amounts of court time.  By the time we've executed one person, it's cost millions.<br>  <br>  Capital punishment isn't a deterrent to crime.  I know it's a favorite saw of the right wing - but it isn't.  Most murders are two guys who know each other - they're drunk and they have a gun and they get into a fight.  They aren't thinking:  Oh, better not do this, they have a death penalty.  <br>  <br>  Capital punishment allows the religous right to feel SO justified.  They love revenge - and I don't think our official society ought to be directed by people like this - they don't tend to use their heads for anything.|`|A6rm7ExXaa	Many people attempt to rationalize this with the "an eye for an eye" mantra but this falls short since this is biblical and these same people will say we must follow the 10 commandments well this means that the death penalty is unacceptable because it violates the 6th commandment: thou shalt not kill<br>  <br>  i am personally against it because<br>  who are we to decide who should live and who should die we should never assume that we know what someone deserves|`|gU5gFsjXaa	For, i believe if someone took another person's life I think they should be killed. I don't think they should be killed with shots though, i think they should go back to the guillotine or the noose, so they can feel what the people they killed felt like. Just my 2 cents.|`|2tBJT53Kaa	For the death penalty!<br>  Prevents prison overcrowding.<br>  Hopefully it will deter crime.|`|QwTqyarlaa	for.... why should we be paying for these horrible people to eat, drink and sleep everyday?
OHn91mP1aa	Currently all the money that goes into Social Security (SS) is collected by the US government in the form of taxes that are automatically deducted from the paychecks of people who are working.  The government takes that money and invests it (sort of) then distributes it to all the people who are collecting SS payments.  You don't have a choice how much money is collected, nor how much money you'll get.  The government controls that.<br>  <br>  Some people favor the idea of "privatizing" SS.  In this system the government would not collect taxes from working people.  Rather the government would require working people to keep the money in a special account they control themselves and they would use the money to directly purchase stocks or certain other investments.  <br>  <br>  The upside to this is that people *could* make quite a bit more money than they'd get with the current SS plan if they pick good investments that do well.  The downside is that they also stand to loose much or all of their money if they pick bad investments.<br>  <br>  Many - if not most - Americans don't particuarly like the idea of directly investing their money themselves.  It's complex, requires attention and the risks worry them.  They prefer the fixed SS plan from the government, even if it may mean less money in the long run.  <br>  <br>  For those who do like to invest, there are special "retirement accounts" (such as IRA plans) which let them invest additional money of their own.  But they still have SS taxes removed from their paycheck to help fund the payments of those who simply want to stick with the current SS plan.|`|wz9szz3Gaa	privatize is when you take the money you put into it and invest instead of the gov. controlling it. Bush had brought this issue up as an alternative since S.S. is in trouble. Ironically Obama was going to talk about it today and suggest the same as Bush and the democrats had to remind him that was Bush's plan and the democrats voted that down. Imagine our President who was a Senator at that time forgot. That's no surprise to me he never voted on anything. I believe it would have been a good thing prior to this economic collapse but now it would be to risky to invest in the market. If the market was good yes it would make money for you instead of just sitting there not a good idea at the present time.|`|1amF7oNwaa	IT IS PROBABLY THE ONLY WAY OF SAVING IT BUT IT WILL NOT HAPPEN|`|UpZFb6X5aa	Sure.<br>  First--the current system. Workers (and employers) pay social security tax (a combined total of 12.4% of each workers income up to  $106,880 (2009). That money goes to pay social security benefits to retirees, persons with disabilities, and some dependant children.<br>  <br>  The idea of privatization is to replace this system, either in part or totally, with individual accounts. A worker would pay into the acccount, the money would be invested, and upon retirement woud then have his/her own pension. Some of the money paid would still go toward insurance against early disability and similar programs.<br>  <br>  In effect, what you are talking about is a mandatory Individual Retirement Account (IRA). Google that and look at how those plans work Or go to irs.gov and read Publication 17.<br>  <br>  The problem with this is twofold.<br>  >first, we have an existing system you can't simply change overnight. 35 million people depend on it--and millions more are far to close to retirement to build up enough funds in a privatized account. So how do you transition from one system to the other.<br>  >safety. Investments (other thhan very conservative ones) carry risk. Do you restrict people to CDs and other safe but low-paying investments. If you open it up to potentially higher return investments, what do you do about the unlucky ones who end up losing money off investments -- investments they were forced to make. Remember this is a mandatory system.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps|`|e380b6c435d028a856da0ab58ab394f2aa	Privatized, in this case, means the individual can choose where and how it is invested instead of leaving it up to some politician (who just spends it on pork barrel projects).

fcc97be1ae1addc02f0b674cef5d4949aa	Most people would probably respond with Washington.  I think much of Washington's success as president was because he didn't have to face any dissenting opinions.  The new country pretty much followed his lead.<br>  <br>  Adams was unpopular with a large section of the population and this was responsible for the creation of the two party system we have today.<br>  <br>  Jefferson was his biggest rival.  Jefferson opposed the national banking system set up by Adams.  He believed that states should have more rights than the federal government.  He strongly believed in individual rights over government control.  Probably his biggest achievement was the doubling the size of the country through the Louisiana Purchase and the establishment of the policy of Manifest Destiny.|`|U0Rvsabdaa	Jefferson.

Good Luck!
xxDjV6Axaa	Agree with #2.  Arrears are suspended until he has something to pay with.  Right now he doesn't.  If he gets backpay from SS, I am sure it will be more than enough to cover it.<br>  <br>  Just also wanted to note, if his disability was work related, he should also be filing a claim with worker's comp.  WC can go on as long as he is alive so they usually want to settle.  Get a lawyer who is experienced so he gets the most he can.|`|9f15OV0Naa	They found that at this time, he is unable to pay and are putting this obligation on hold.  It does not mean that he will not eventually have to pay it.  He is required to prove to the court through a doctor's statement every 3 three months that he is still disabled.  In the event that your husband in no longer disabled or there is an increase in his income, he will have to start paying child support again.|`|xL9EpNctaa	It has been dropped for now and the order is modified. He needs to provide doctor proof that he is still disabled on a quarterly basis (every 3 months). IF his situation changes and he becomes able to pay the arrears, it will be re-instated.|`|GBpLZ2REaa	"Arrears as of xx dollars remitted without prejudice to be REINSTATED in the event of a change in circumstance or ABILITY TO PAY as appropriate"<br>  <br>  Yes, when he gets social security, he''ll have to start paying a potion to help support his children. If he gets a lump sum, they'll probably take a portion of that to pay some of his arrears because at that point he will be ABLE to PAY.<br>  <br>  Why is this even an issue? Your husband should WANT to help out financially when he gets social security. They ARE his children, after all. They still need to be fed and clothed the same as before.

I did.|`|yKLBdoigaa	Air Force or Navy. Navy can probably hook it up with a better signing bonus for anything Nuclear related. Background check will have to be clean however.|`|XOWf6JGQaa	Depends on what you want I would suggest Navy since its my branch but here is a non biased general breakdown of the branches.<br>  <br>       ARMY- Expect to be pestered by the Army A LOT after you stop in the first time. Also army recruiters tend to screw you over more the other recruiters. The Army is heavily deployed in Afghanistan and Iraq and even though not all Soldiers are sent over there you should expect to go over there if you join the Army. Boot Camp is proboly the second hardest in the military.<br>  <br>       MARINE CORPS- The Marine Corps recruiters will put it to you straight no bullshit. You cannot be garunteed of your job before you go for instance I got a 92 on my ASVAB and the only thing they wanted to give me was Infantry. Also the Marine Corps have small signing bonuses and the lifestyle is to live breath and eat the corps so dont expect to have a social life and expect one or more tours to Iraq or Afghanistan as a certainty.<br>  <br>  <br>       AIR FORCE- is a good branch if you want a more civilian like job. The Air Force is very safe and get deployed to other places than Iraq or Afghanistan and they are very laid back. They promote vary slowly and are down sizing so you run the risk of losing your job in 4 years<br>  <br>       NAVY- Is the most flexible of the branches you can do almost anything that yoju can do in the other branches in this branch including infantry ( Idividual Augmentee). You are also garunteed your job upon singing and there are many programs for you if you become more gung-ho such as the SEALS, SWCCS, SEABEES, EOD, and many others plus you can get up to a $40,000 bonus! believe me join the Navy

rNRDRkuPaa	Eminent Domain, as created in the Constitution, applies only to land seized by the government for the explicit purpose of building "canals, forts, and highways".  <br>  <br>          While this statute could certainly be expanded to include the modern equivalents of "canals, forts, and highways", such as airports, another mode of public transportation, and missile silos, military facilities like the "forts" allowed in the statute, it was never intended to allow the government to seize private property from a citizen and grant it to another citizen.  <br>  <br>           However, activist judges have seen fit to unconstitutionally re-write our Constitution to attempt to allow this.  <br>  <br>           Until these judges are reigned in, Crichton's prediction may very well become reality.|`|be1cae5db2f57740061ac3e82e7f4e5eaa	I haven't read the book, but Michael Crichton always gives me quite a bit to think about.

I've read that genetic researchers have patents on sequences that they have discovered. This enables them to get a cut of any of the money that comes from therapies developed from what they have found. There have also been cases where patients have donated cells to researchers who then tried to take the cells with them when they changed employers. The initial employer then sued to keep the cells. It seems possible that a cell line might be subject to "eminent domain", and more possible that a government might resort to legal measures to get it if the cell line could cure cancer. If I had a cure for cancer in my body, I don't think I'd have a problem donating it.|`|MevVqZOEaa	hmmm i dont know, but what i do know is that i take fiction very seriously too...i even cried when dumbledore died :| lol!

Ordinarily minor violations of probation in misdemeanor cases are not treated harshly, but I would not be surprised to see a judge impose a short period of jail custody for this kind of violation.<br>  <br>  Beyond the legal question, if this person is unable to stop drinking despite the inevitability of discovery and the real possibility of incarceration, he has a severe problem and needs to seek help ASAP.|`|202f32be961b3b4d8c82dd46d14b9e70aa	I think that you go back to jail.

The City Police Department patrols the city.  The local County Sheriff covers everything in the county but outside the cities.<br>  <br>  The Highway Patrol was doing their job and probably responded to assist the City PD because they did not have an officer available.  The Highway Patrol was not deployed to respond to a robbery in the city because that is not their primary role.  Most of the time the HP is where they are is because of citizen complaints or a high number of accidents in that area.<br>  <br>  All the officers of these different agency are certified state-wide and can come to the assistance of each other.  This is just the division of labor (jurisdiction).|`|86dbf689c9539acccd15feefb8b8f2a7aa	That is doing police work.  Breaking the speed limit is breaking the law, and police are there to enforcement.  Because its a small stretch of highway doesnt make a difference.  Perhaps there is a lot of room to sit and wait for traffic violators safely?  Or there may have been many reports of problems with fast cars or traffic in that area?  Or maybe there are plenty of blind spots so that the police have a good tactical advantage?   Whatever the reason, the police are employed to serve and protect and thats what they're doing by enforcing the laws of your state.

Needless to say, it was built, at the edge of our neighborhood.  The property values dropped drastically over the next five years, and many people took their losses and moved out because of how badly the neighborhood had deteriorated.  Oh, the public housing buildings were torn down two years ago.  Another chapter in the brilliant history of liberalism.  Go Liberals, you ROCK!!!|`|1ad8ef0cb30db45878f918d28e25887daa	Maybe we should work on making all the schools like the nice little school you went to before.

So they never really formulated a fight against the 1 woman; and that was the beginning of the end.  From that point on the Liberals couldn't pass laws, so they went to the courts to force Liberalism down the throats of a generation.   The frustration of seeing generations now growing up not seeing the damage that has occured to the original design of our government.  Legislators are elected by the people to make laws, some are voted on by the people and pass only to be trashed by the judicial branch.  Judicial branch is to interpret law not make law.  When laws are made and interpreted by one branch; and more power is handed to the branch of government that needs restraint in power, the power that belongs to the people is destroyed.  That is the greatest harm to this country and harms not just me but generations to come.  The suffering continues....|`|577a7e15bd8268697126063dfaed4449aa	yeah it was when the president and his advisors hijacked the constitution...damn liberals, true conservatives would have NEVER done that.|`|bb67be57b37611049acefd6e08f6911aaa	Extremists on either side...liberal or conservative...frighten me.

Pot was legal for a long time, but it was demonized in the 1920's. A person of hispanic descent commited a volent crime. The newspaper reported that Marijuana was in his system. The link was made between pot and volent crime, and so the public urged the FDA to ban it.<br>  <br>  Same thing with cocain. Racist cops would get smacked down by african americans, so the cops saids that it was because the person was on coke. The public feared what a suped up black man could to, so they, again, urged the FDA.<br>  <br>  Oh, and BTW, "Willie" didn't have "control" of the house and senate. The Democrats did. And, if you know anything about anything, then you know that the President is not the leader of the party.<br>  <br>  Now, as far as why not legalize? The question is, "Why should they?"

Recent reports have shown that MJ is now one of the largest cash crops being grown in the US right now, and recent estimates put it's potential tax revenue well into the hundreds of Millions per State!  Not just the Feds.<br>  <br>  Personally I don't smoke pot, but even I can see the potential positive impact that the legalization of it could have.  Not to mention it does have some medical potential, especially to a person like me who has cancer and one day may have to take it just to be able to get past the pain.  I hope that day never comes but it would be nice if I had some options.  I'd rather be able to pass from this world in ease than go out in pain.

AA10915667	If it were me, I'd see if I could get the government to grant tax breaks, or some kind of break, to local entrepreneurs starting a business.  Any incentive to start a business would be good, because businesses will generate jobs.  <br>  <br>  The solution, though, lies ultimately with citizens having the guts to try something different than just getting a job.  There're always opportunities, and it is perhaps when things seem darkest that normally unseen opportunities show themselves.<br>  <br>  I realize this is not America (or any Western society) we're talking about, and the general attitude of seizing opportunities may be entirely foreign to them.  <br>  <br>  In a nutshell, tho, I think the best way to create jobs is to attract other businesses to move to your location, or attract entrepreneurs to establish one, and this is achieved through a variety of factors.  For instance, no one wants to move into a region fraught with terrorist strikes, civil strife, and general instability.  Those must be quelled, one way or another, to take any additional steps in the direction of being attractive.  The list is endless.  The ways to make your nation more attractive are limited only to your imagination.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|4f7df60a399891c046412ad7222e19a1aa	Join the army, and go kill Taliban, that will boost your economy and inable you to get your agriculture back on line.|`|PbZJ60upaa	Implement capitalism, and Christianity, and keep taxes low.

Heroin!" because of the poppies, but, keep in mind that if you had buyers, any other type of flower that might grow there, and would be just as greatly purchased. Humans are vain, and love pretty things, so flowers is a great export item. This will stimulate the need to expand irrigation efforts, and possibly even hydro-electric ambitions.<br>  <br>  In the field of aggregates, look at pictures of Afghanistan. There are rocks everywhere! Rocks can be gathered, categorized, and sold for construction purposes (remember the hydro-electric ambitions, mentioned above?). Quarries can be expedited, and thus engineering can resume in this former portion of the Persian Empire. <br>  <br>  Philosophy applied to life and improving life: People will fight because they are poor and have no hope but to fight. But, if you show them a life, where they can make money, become educated, and live better, they will fight harder for that.|`|AA11179275	we all need to litter and then pay people to pick up are trash.... i have already started to do this

If you don't feel comfortable talking to any of the Health Techs, inform them that you'd like to talk to the Chief Medical Officer. (CMO)  You should have a medical briefing before you actually start your physical.  In this briefing the Health Techs will have you fill out some paper work called "Report Of Medical Examination and Report Of Medical History."  On the Report of Medical History, there might be a question about HPV.  If it is, make sure you check the appropriate block.  Again, if you don't feel comfortable discussing this with one of the Health Technicians, make sure you discuss this with the CMO.  More than likely, the CMO will require medical documents (MED DOCS) from your visit to your family doctor.  If you don't disclose this information or try to hide this information, this will be known as "Fraudulent Enlistment" article 83 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice.  You can tried by a military court and if found guilty, can be incarcerated with a dishonorable discharge.  Long story short, PLEASE LET THE MEDICAL DEPARTMENT KNOW! Ok?  Aight!

They are overseen by Congress as well. The Board of Governors are appointed by the president and confirmed by congress.<br>  <br>  B) Ownership - This is the source of much conspiracy thinking. Here is the straight dope:<br>  <br>  - The Federal Reserve System is run by the Board of Governors. This is 100% quasi-independent government entity. There is no structure or mechanism for private ownership at this level.<br>  <br>  - The 12 Fed branches are organized like corporations and have some semblance to private ownership. Each member bank is required to buy shares that receive a standard 6% dividend. These member banks also have a fair amount of influence within their branch. They elect 6 of the 9 branch board members. A counterargument to the 'ownership' issue is that the 'shares' cannot be sold to another private party, only turned in for face value. <br>  <br>  The Board of Governors has sole power to set monetary policy. The Fed branches have power limited to the daily operations of their branch within the rules set forth by Congress and the Board of Governors. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/generalinfo/faq/faqfrs.htm#5" rel="nofollow">http://www.federalreserve.gov/generalinf...</a><br>  <br>  C) Result of the Federal Reserve Act of 1913 - Previously the nations banking system was operated under the National Bank Act passed in the latter 1800s. The act authorized National banks to distribute currency. There was no real central monetary authority. Bank panics were common mainly because there was little recourse for a bank if they ran short of money.<br>  <br>  The intention of the Federal Reserve Act of 1913 was to create a central authority for managing the nations money supply and a central bank that could be the 'bank of last resort' for banks in trouble. But it did not live up to expectations for the first few decades.<br>  <br>  There was a lot of political wrangling between those that wanted to continue private bank control and those that wanted a strong central bank. The 1913 act was a compromise. The operation of the 12 Fed branches were dominated by private banks, and the Board of Governors was a public oversight.<br>  <br>  Controversy continued and the seeds of change were being sown as the 1913 act was not having the intended consequences. The Branches resented their Board of Governors oversight and acted independently. The NY Branch tried to coordinate activities but such coordination was voluntary by each branch. The Board of Governors (and by extension the President and Congress) was frustrated. Bank panic and failures continued because the private bank influence didn't care that their competition was eliminated. Then there was the concern about bank loans being used for stock market speculation, but the NY branch resisted any interference in this alleged practice. When the crash hit, it emboldened the critics about the flaws in the 1913 act and wanted stronger central control.<br>  <br>  The next big change for the Fed came in the form of the Bank Act of 1935. For the first time, the Board of Governors had clear control over monetary policy and near absolute power over the Branches. The branches simply became operational centers executing under Board of governors rules. The Board of Governors was also given more authority to regulate banks with the charter to ensure the overall health of the system.<br>  <br>  D) Elasticity - Just means that the money supply can be adjusted to match the needs of the economy. So at Christmas when more people are spending, the Fed distributes more cash. <br>  <br>  Another example is farming; farmers borrow more in spring, then pay back at harvest. So the system needs to provide more flexible borrowing when there is a need. <br>  <br>  You can see the results of a non-elastic (Gold standard) system in the 1800s when loan interest was highest during planting season and lowest during harvest. Going off the gold standard allowed interest rates to be relatively stable and predictable.|`|AA11932760	In summary, the Illuminati.<br>  The Fed is controlled by a group of banks, which in turn are controlled by their shareholders. They primarily consist of Rothschild, Rockefeller, Morgan and their fellow conspirators.<br>  The result of the Federal Reserve act was that the American government lost control of the dollar.<br>  Elastic means not attached to anything meaningful like gold|`|8cfb6e43e8bdf7e8288670c291ad80faaa	the frderal reserve has a Franchice to run control the money and inflation rate of the us (and the world in essance)   they are not answerable to the government and that is not good     after all we are a government of    for and by the people      and above all    answerable to the people      but they have the gig    hmmmm something to change     ya think|`|c82e1860f53bad07b6d1350bd386ce86aa	Elasticity of currency is the ability of banks to create money out of thin air. At first this sounds like lunacy, but bear with me for a moment.<br>  Banks are allowed to lend out $9 for every $1 they have in their coffers and still charge interest on the full $9 although they only have to pay interest on the $1 if this dollar should happen to be deposited by someone else.<br>  <br>  Another aspect of elasticity is the disconnect of the currency from the gold. This was done by Richard M. Nixon in the early 70's. So the currency is no longer backed by any value and is nothing but colored paper that by law is supposed to be value, but indeed isn't. Try to buy an airline ticket with cash; they will reject it although it bears the words: Legal tender.<br>  <br>  The federal reserve bank is not owned by the government at all. Paul M.Warburg, the father of the idea rejected the name central bank, because it had such a bad connotation to the three central banks the U.S. had before the fed was established back in 1913. The Fed is largely owned by Chase. Controlled it is by no one and the president has nothing (absolutely nothing) to say about the dealings of the Fed. Fine, he names the chairman, but that is nothing but a ceremonial act. The chairman is predetermined and has all the freedom to deal however he sees fit. There is no congressional oversight of the Fed. That would be futile for congress. Congress needs money, because they do a horrible job being fiscally responsible, so they obtain debt in form of debt notes from the Fed and the fed in turn prints the money, hence increasing inflation. Inflation doesn't have to be if politicians would do a good job.

This means Spec Ops recruiters are looking for ways to DQ you, because they have many many more good candidates than they do open slots.<br>  Pretty much any serious weakness can get you kicked out.<br>  Yes some missions are more likely to involve swimming than others, but  the Spec Ops community doesn't play "Oh, Fred can't go on this one, he's not a great swimmer."<br>  <br>  Secondly, Spec Ops asks so much of you that you have to be good at everything. "Not my job" just doesn't cut it when you are 30 miles behind enemy lines on a two week combat patrol.<br>  <br>  Most importantly, you are looking at this wrong. The way the Spec Ops people I have met would solve your problem would NOT be by accepting a limitation (not being a good swimmer) and trying to work around it. The Spec Ops community has taken the "positive can-do attitude" to an insane degree...(you sort of have to if you are going to be parachuted into Afghanistan and told "take over the country" with what you can carry).  <br>  <br>  The Spec Ops people I know would do whatever it took to make themselves a great swimmer so they could be the best and qualify; not  and look for the service with the easiest qualifications.

YaOxRfBYaa	Yes. A hate crime can be committed by anyone against in another identifiable social group. It's important to know that race is not the only factor in determining if a crime is a hate crime. Men, women, rich poor, black, white, gay, straight ...etc. can all be victim of a hate crime. A Muslim is committing a hate crime if he beats a man because he's white, a black is committing a hate crime if he vandalizes a business because it's gay-owned ... etc. <br>  <br>  Also, you'll need to check your state's statute on hate crimes.

Hamas' charter (written in 1988 and still in effect) calls for the destruction of the State of Israel and its replacement with a Palestinian Islamic state in the area that is now Israel, the West Bank, and the Gaza Strip.[3][4][5] The charter states: "There is no solution for the Palestinian question except through Jihad."[6]<br>  <br>  Hamas is listed as a terrorist organization by Australia,[7] Canada,[8][9] the European Union,[10] Israel,[11] Japan,[12] the United Kingdom,[13] and the United States,[14] and is banned in Jordan.[15] According to the US State Department, the group is funded by Iran, Palestinian expatriates, and private benefactors in Saudi Arabia and other Arab states.[14] In a 2002 report, Human Rights Watch stated that Hamas' leaders "should be held accountable for the war crimes and crimes against humanity" that have been committed by its members.[16]<br>  <br>  Since the death of Palestine Liberation Organization leader Yasser Arafat, Hamas's political wing has entered and won many local elections in Gaza, Qalqilya, and Nablus. In January 2006, Hamas won a surprise victory in the Palestinian parliamentary elections, taking 76 of the 132 seats in the chamber, while the ruling Fatah party took 43.[17] Vehemently anti-Israel and according to many anti-Semitic,[18] Hamas's militant stance has found a receptive audience amongst Palestinians; many perceived the preceding Fatah government as corrupt and ineffective, and Hamas's supporters see it as a legitimate resistance movement defending Palestinians from what they see as a brutal Israeli occupation of Palestinian territories.[19] Hamas has further gained popularity by establishing extensive welfare programs, funding schools, orphanages, and healthcare clinics, throughout the West Bank and Gaza Strip.[20] Since Hamas has taken control, the Palestinian territories have experienced a period of sharp internal conflicts, known as Fauda (anarchy), in which many Palestinians have been killed in internecine fighting.[21][22] Much of the internal instability has been caused due to the lack of funds for public works that came in the shape of aid from western nations, but stopped due to the election of a Hamas government.|`|kA8xSOvwaa	by bringing together all the people who were and still are opposed to what they call "the occupation".|`|n51GGFqiaa	The same way the U.S. military is formed to protect its interests.

Our Constitution is such an incredible document & is as functional now as when it was conceived over 200 years ago.<br>  <br>  Many folks have grown skeptical recently for a variety of reasons. The biggest one is probably the lack of knowledge about how our system actually works. Sadly it is not on the curriculum in schools anymore.<br>  <br>  Our government of the people , by the people , & for the people is still alive & well . There are certainly challenges before us, but that is nothing new. So many of our fellow Americans have so much , they have no idea what adversity our people have faced & overcome thru history.<br>  <br>  And the advent of the internet while a fantastic resource, also facilitates the dissemination of an incredible volume of misinformation that is taken as fact by far too many.<br>  <br>  I've traveled to other countries & they have problems too.....that is not something uniquely American....but our government still allows us more freedoms & opportunities than any other.|`|AA11875488	The reason it's been two hours since you asked the question and I'm the first one to attempt an answer should tell you that nobody has a clue.

Cheney, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice,  Donald Rumsfield and Attorney General Alberto Gonzales have committed violations and subversions of the Constitution of the United States of America in an attempt to carry out with impunity crimes against peace and humanity and war crimes and deprivations of the civil rights of the people of the United States and other nations, by assuming powers of an imperial executive unaccountable to law and usurping powers of the Congress, the Judiciary and those reserved to the people of the United States, by the following acts:<br>  <br>  1) Seizing power to wage wars of aggression in defiance of the U.S. Constitution, the U.N. Charter and the rule of law; carrying out a massive assault on and occupation of Iraq, a country that was not threatening the United States, resulting in the death and maiming of hundereds of thousands of Iraqis, and thousands of U.S. G.I.s.<br>  <br>  2) Lying to the people of the U.S., to Congress, and to the U.N., providing false and deceptive rationales for war.   <br>  <br>  3) Authorizing, ordering and condoning direct attacks on civilians, civilian facilities and locations where civilian casualties were unavoidable. <br>  <br>  4) Instituting a secret and illegal

the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.<br>  <br>  7) Making, ordering and condoning false statements and propaganda about the conduct of foreign governments and individuals and acts by U.S. government personnel; manipulating the media and foreign governments with false information; concealing information vital to public discussion and informed judgment concerning acts, intentions and possession, or efforts to obtain weapons of mass destruction in order to falsely create a climate of fear and destroy opposition to U.S. wars of aggression and first strike attacks.<br>  <br>  8) Violations and subversions of the Charter of the United Nations and international law, both a part of the "Supreme Law of the land" under Article VI, paragraph 2, of the Constitution, in an attempt to commit with impunity crimes against peace and humanity and war crimes in wars and threats of aggression against Afghanistan, Iraq and others and usurping powers of the United Nations and the peoples of its nations by bribery, coercion and other corrupt acts and by rejecting treaties, committing treaty violations, and frustrating compliance with treaties in order to destroy any means by which international law and institutions can prevent, affect, or adjudicate the exercise of U.S. military and economic power against the international community.<br>  <br>  9) Acting to strip United States citizens of their constitutional and human rights, ordering indefinite detention of citizens, without access to counsel, without charge, and without opportunity to appear before a civil judicial officer to challenge the detention, based solely on the discretionary designation by the Executive of a citizen as an "enemy combatant."<br>  <br>  10) Ordering indefinite detention of non-citizens in the United States and elsewhere, and without charge, at the discretionary designation of the Attorney General or the Secretary of Defense.<br>  <br>  11) Ordering and authorizing the Attorney General to override judicial orders of release of detainees under INS jurisdiction, even where the judicial officer after full hearing determines a detainee is wrongfully held by the government.<br>  <br>  12) Authorizing secret military tribunals and summary execution of persons who are not citizens who are designated solely at the discretion of the Executive who acts as indicting official, prosecutor and as the only avenue of appellate relief.<br>  <br>  13) Refusing to provide public disclosure of the identities and locations of persons who have been arrested, detained and imprisoned by the U.S. government in the United States, including in response to Congressional inquiry.<br>  <br>  14) Use of secret arrests of persons within the United States and elsewhere and denial of the right to public trials.<br>  <br>  15) Authorizing the monitoring of confidential attorney-client privileged communications by the government, even in the absence of a court order and even where an incarcerated person has not been charged with a crime.<br>  <br>  16) Ordering and authorizing the seizure of assets of persons in the United States, prior to hearing or trial, for lawful or innocent association with any entity that at the discretionary designation of the Executive has been deemed "terrorist."<br>  <br>  17) Engaging in criminal neglect in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, depriving thousands of people in Louisiana, Mississippi and other Gulf States of urgently needed support, causing mass suffering and unnecessary loss of life.<br>  <br>  18) Institutionalization of racial and religious profiling and authorization of domestic spying by federal law enforcement on persons based on their engagement in noncriminal religious and political activity.<br>  <br>  19) Refusal to provide information and records necessary and appropriate for the constitutional right of legislative oversight of executive functions.<br>  20) Rejecting treaties protective of peace and human rights and abrogation of the obligations of the United States under, and withdrawal from, international treaties and obligations without consent of the legislative branch, and including termination of the ABM treaty between the United States and Russia, and rescission of the authorizing signature from the Treaty of Rome which served as the basis

Would you not be furious too if your home country did this to you and covered it up and told you that you might be insane while you went to work, someone invaded your privacy, tampered with records at work, rifled through your files, and everyone lied to you?!!

It is perfectly legal, but there is a little something, though.<br>  <br>  A soldier below the age of 18 will NOT be deployed to a theatre of operations.  It is illegal to arm a member of the military who is less than 18 years old with the intent that he uses his weapon in anger.  As such, very young soldiers do not go places where they are expected to defend themselves and others with lethal force or participate in offensive operations since it would go against International Law and the Law of Armed Conflict when it comes to child soldiers.<br>  <br>  So no, the UK and the US, and Canada and all the others are not above the other nations in that regard.  We just allow younger people to join, but within the constraints of International Laws and the Laws of Armed Conflict.|`|K2fiOt6daa	i don't know about the uk, but in the us it's 17 w/ paernts permission, or 18 without.

DRIZIuXWaa	to the previous poster who said that its a religious war between the Hindus and Buddhists, all i got to say is that u better brush up your history.<br>  <br>  Cos its not Hindus Vs Buddhists,<br>  its Buddihsts Vs Non-Buddhists<br>  <br>  its as simple as that.<br>  <br>  Tamils are mostly Hindu but there are Tamil Christians as well. And the LTTE is made up of Tamil Hindus and Tamil Christians<br>  <br>  The Un, Amnesty International, Human rights watch and many other non-governmental Organizations have made more than a dozen comments demanding the srilankan government to stop the genocide but it has fallen on deaf ears. <br>  <br>  a background on why Tamils are asking for a seperate state:<br>  <br>  Tamils belong to the Dravidian people. The Dravidians have been living in south as its native people. whereas the Sinhalese(who came to srilanka only in the 6th century bc) were of aryan people. they were NOT the original inhibitants of India or south asia. They came from the central asian region and moved into india at around 1800 bc . and then to srilankan in the 6th century bc. Tamils have been living here for millenia.<br>  <br>  the very fact that there have been many archaeological findings(especially of burial urns) that have corroborated the fact that Tamils lived here LONG before the Sinhalese came to this island. so by any means this island rightfully belongs to the thamils.<br>  <br>  This island always had at least 2 kingdoms. many times more than 2. It was NEVER a single country till the british colonised it and merged the two administrative sections for efficencies sake!!<br>  <br>  when the British left the srilankan Tamils, who fought for independence from British agreed that the country should be unified into a single country. cos they believed that Tamils and sinhalese could live together. they were so wrong.<br>  <br>  the sinhalese resented the fact that the Tamils were Very highly educated, and were overwhelmingly prominent in business as well.<br>  <br>  when the British left, the sinhalese brought laws that said "sinhala would be the only national language"!! this country is a "sinhala buddhist" country. and Tamil has no place in this<br>  <br>  All the Tamils, who worked so hard for independence from the British were devastated, by this cowardly backstabbing by the very people they had helped!.<br>  <br>  overnight, tamils became second class citizens in their own land!. Tamils who did not know sinhalese were kicked from their jobs.<br>  <br>  Huge anti Tamil pogroms and riots broke out all over the country.thousands of Tamils lost their lives, their livelihoods, and their belongings. they houses and businesses were burnt and they were butchered on sight!<br>  <br>  they protested peacefully, and the protesters were set upon by bloodthirsty sinhalese mobs and many lost their lives there.<br>  <br>  the riots happened again and again in 1956, 1958, 1968, 1971, 1977, 1983 and 1987<br>  <br>  more than 75% of Tamils have becomes refugees because of this. tens of thousands of Tamils have lost their lives to these riots, to carpet bombing of villages and temples by the srilankan airforce, to kidnapping, to torture and to assassinations<br>  <br>  the tamils had the best library in all of south asia.Housing all their rarest of books and literature(tamil is one of the 8 classical languages in the world and has an unbroken literary tradition going back at least 2500 years). this library, the symbol of tamil pride and history was burnt to the ground<br>  <br>  tamil students (even though tamils were only 20% in the new state) made up to around 70% of the engineering and medical students in the srilankan universities. the srilankan government brought a new law that said "tamils have to get FAR higher scores to get into the universities than the sinhalese students , for the exact same exam!!!)<br>  <br>  this blatant act, on top of countless other actions by the government finally forced Tamil youth to ask for their rightful land. this has led to the civil war that continues to this day<br>  <br>  and most of the western nations simply dont care about this(even though, the UN, Amnesty international, Human rights watch and many other non-governmental organizations around the world) had condemned the srilankan government for their human rights abuses.<br>  <br>  but this had fallen on deaf ears as the average sinhalese is not literate enough to see through the "religio-ethnic" propaganda spewn from the mouth of the buddhist monks.<br>  <br>  some links on this issue<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tamil_eelam..." rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tamil_eelam...</a><br>  <br>  anti tamil pogroms<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/black_july..." rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/black_july....</a><br>  <br>  state terrorism in srilanka<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/state_terro..." rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/state_terro...</a><br>  <br>  17 international aid workers killed b the srilankan military.

65fca584d7048fc70cf7c0e76a7300f2aa	Pat Tillman was a hero.  A real hero.  Not a politician who is willing to roll the dice with someone else's children.<br>  <br>  Pat believed that Iraq was an unjust war.  He left a multi-million dollar job to be a patriot (a choice that simply wasn't there for most of our working class military).  Like Jessica Lynch the military put dishonest spin on the circumstances of his passing because they were inconsistent with the marketing recruiters were doing around his enlistment.  <br>  <br>  The biggest tragedy in the Tillman story is that the same @ssholes who promoted the Iraq war and sold it to a gullible, thin and evanescent majority thought that their words, their spin could add anything to the heroic essence of his contribution.  Pat Tillman was a hero for who he was, what he did, what he gave up, why he did it, irrespective of spin.  To lie to us and his family in order to recruit a few more middle class kids to their death in Baghdad is the ultimate disservice to his memory.  It's too bad only the low level officers that served with him will catch fallout for it.|`|208b193483dd7d7b272bebb9a7fe1deaaa	Unfortunately friendly fire has always been a part of warfare.

But that does not matter because if you truly value these lives you will provide for their care with tax dollars.

And you will teach people to use birth control methods, stop with the stupid abstinence only education.

AA10467187	Your signal will be weaker (ie: static, less clear picture, pixilating). Call your cable provider and ask them to do a line test. Let them know that there might be some piracy going on. Trust me, they will be on it like flies on sh..|`|AA11028702	If it's just the BASIC CABLE service, you should be able to see a SPLITTER attached & the extra cable line will be coming off of this device & go directly into your neighbors place!  Most people who do this aren't smart enough to hide what they are doing.  A splitter is like an extention cord with one line going in & 2 lines going out.  It can easily be obtained at any 99 cent store & applied to your cable along the roof line OR underneath the building.  Sometimes they are just out in plain sight on the side of the building at eye level!  If you can't tell by just looking, then call your cable company & tell them your concerns.  They will have a technician come out & do a line test on your cable.  If your neighbor IS illegally using your cable, then you should stay out of it & LET THE COMPANY HANDLE IT.  I assure you, that the Police WILL be involved & the neighbor will be dealt with in a way that leaves you out of the loop of being the person who did the reporting.  As a paying cable customer, you do have the right to have a clear signal & if you are having any type of difficulties getting a clear picture, then there IS a break in your line SOMEWHERE & the CO will be able to track this down.  If your nutty neighbor gets caught up in the middle...OH WELL, that's what happens when you take something that isn't yours!  Don't engage in any type of a yelling match with this neighbor, because they COULD be into other types of illegal activity, if you know what I mean!|`|4664c2fe6fc6d235757bda9f63ad4f59aa	Call the cable company and let them know you want it to be annonimous.

5428d63d083e56aa6399197e0e01c57eaa	I am not sure if i am completely qualified to answer this question. I am from india now living in canada , I have been to Singapore , England , US , Quatar , and  especially  to the Philippines ,6 times in the last 5 years.Wonderful people and country , never ever had a bad experience while i was there. <br>   This is the impression i got about the philippine politics. It is a mess, the people are really not concerned about who is ruling the country , the poverty is so rampant that they are only concerned about putting food on the table and having cloths on their backs.<br>  The country is having a kind of pseudo democracy , the reason being the politics is  a kind of feudal system power being in the hand of vested interests , which are politicians them selves and power being handed over from father to son and so on. There is no middle class to speak of, all the people who can leave, have already left the country , the people who are staying there being those who cannot leave and those who have no need to leave.<br>  The catholic church is the only institution holding the country together.If it is not for catholic church the country will now be in the throes of a revolution.<br>  That being said there is a lot of interference by the church in political life, for example in population control and contraception, the policies of the church is not consistant with the realitiy that the country faces; there is over population and philippines have a limited land mass.<br>  Philippines was the leading light amoung the countries in the south and east asia during the 1970's, look at philippines now the development have stagnated. Philippines is now the sick country of asia. <br>  I will never invest in the philippines if i have money to invest.I will choose stable economies like china or india.<br>  There should be a fundamental change in the governence of the nation to revive the philippine economy, things like charter change are just, forgive my expression "bull ****".<br>  there should be transparency in governance and corruption at all levels of the society should end.<br>  The government should provide people with basic nessessities like food shelter clothing health care and education at a reasonable cost. People do not need ipods and flat screen tv's.<br>  Population control measures should be strictly implemented. Interference in governence from church or other vested interests should be eliminated. And stupid shows on TV like MTB  and SOP should be shut down.<br>  These are also the things i want to see happen in india as well. All third world countries suffer from maladies like corruption, graft and non-transprancy in governance.<br>  We need statesmen, people with vision not politicians, in order to force these changes.

7dLiFX0Taa	Definition - An unlawful attack by one person upon another for the purpose of inflicting severe or aggravated bodily injury. This type of assault usually is accompanied by the use of a weapon or by means likely to produce death or great bodily harm. (It is not necessary that injury result from an aggravated assault when a gun, knife, or other weapon is used which could and probably would result in serious personal injury if the crime were successfully completed.)<br>  <br>  It depends on the severity of the crime and the age of the assailant and victim. A good friend of mine was charged with aggravated assault x2 but he managed to get both charges dropped because he proved it was in self defense.|`|vX0sI990aa	Time in the slammer.|`|677985e3c1cf019f2cbee8aa3921f3ecaa	In TX its similar, it means that they at the least displayed the firearm in a threatening manner in the course of an assault.

7dLiFX0Taa	Oh my you're in a pickle. The maxiumum fine is pretty hefty for the crime you committed.

Ohio law does not follow this trend. The maximum penalty in Ohio for selling tobacco products to minors is a fine of $500 and/or 60 days in jail. However, a handful of Ohio communities have passed ordinances that permit authorities to suspend tobacco licenses if the retailer sells tobacco products to minors. The strictest ordinance is in Twinsburg, which is located between Akron and Cleveland. In Twinsburg, a tobacco retailer's license can be suspended for 3 days on the first violation for selling tobacco products to minors. Even this short suspension gets the message across that Twinsburg is serious about limiting youth access to tobacco.<br>  <br>  Good luck!

Off the top of my head I'm sure you could bring a civil suit, but this would probably not be a practical solution because it would cost you money in attorney's fees.  In short, there is absolutely no law that would prohibit an employer from correcting your time.  I am no lawyer, but I am a law student.  If you are serious about getting your time back my advice is to confront this guy and make it clear that you want your time back.  If there is a work schedule posted that had you working at the time in question, you should attempt to acquire a copy of it.  This, of course, is not conclusive proof that you worked, but it is evidence which implies that you worked.  If not, then why would your employer put up with this?  Somebody who completely fails to show up to work would be fired!<br>  <br>  Acquire the schedule if you can.  Either way, confront your boss with the argument- I was scheduled, if I hadn't worked then why is there no evidence of a reprimand (or firing) for not showing up.<br>  <br>  If this does not work, then contact the employment agency (can't remember what it is called) listed on the poster that your employer should have posted in some conspicuous place.  It lists the minimum wage, rights, remedies, etc.  Again, I am unsure as to the law in this area; there may very well be a statute that addresses this problem, especially now that I have thought about it a little more.  I'm sure that scamming workers out of time is an issue that has been addressed.<br>  <br>  Do not be afraid to contact the agency on the freakin' poster.  These people will help you!|`|6cc0ef9c129d778515f998ecf2e9261daa	yes, but you'll have  atougher battle if you signed something to that effect...look in the employee manual that no one reads|`|AA10900163	Yes, it is.

baf130a2a607da681a60051a131a8dfcaa	I am sure certain states do have the law that protects contractors from being screwed over. Once, you've already started a job via your signed contract, the people that you are doing the actual work for can't withdraw unless they have substanctial complaints about your work done by you and employees and that you have verification of contracts written by you that they can't fire you or your employees regardless of performances and due dates. I think you may be screwed over unless stated so in your contract when you and your client signed it. Otherwise, yes you can.

The court of appeals in each circuit appoints bankruptcy judges for fourteen-year terms. District courts appoint magistrate judges for eight-year terms.In many States, judicial compensation committees, which make recommendations on the amount of salary increases, determine judicial salaries. States without commissions have statutes that regulate judicial salaries, link judicial salaries to the increases in pay for Federal judges, or adjust annual pay according to the change in the Consumer Price Index, calculated by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.<br>  <br>  Judicial activists is a term used by political commentators to describe a tendency by judges to consider outcomes, attitudinal preferences, and other public policy issues in interpreting applicable existing law. Judicial restraint is a theory of judicial interpretation that encourages judges to limit the exercise of their own power. It asserts that judges should hesitate to strike down laws unless they are obviously unconstitutional.<br>  <br>  In criminal law, a guilty defendant is punished by either (1) incarceration in a jail or prison, (2) fine paid to the government, or, in exceptional cases, (3) execution of the defendant: the death penalty. In contrast, a defendant in civil cases is never imprisoned and never executed. In general, a losing defendant in civil litigation only reimburses the plaintiff for losses caused by the defendant's behavior. <br>  <br>  A court of appeals decides appeals from the district courts within its federal judicial circuit, and in some instances from other designated federal courts and administrative agencies. There currently are thirteen United States courts of appeals.<br>  <br>  The United States Court of International Trade is an Article III court, with full powers in law and equity.The Court possesses limited subject matter jurisdiction, meaning that it may hear only cases involving particular international trade and customs law questions.<br>  <br>  <br>  to elo: either help or gtfo!

He denies he ever said any such thing. The Canadian government has confirmed the conversation indeed took place. The New York Times printed the memo. Who should we believe, Obama or that lying Canadian government?<br>  I have not looked up his views of SPP and the NAU.  His duplicity about NAFTA was as far as I needed to go, in light of all the other lies and manipulation he has committed.  Since he favors NAFTA (according to his assurances to Canada) I would have to think he favors SPP and the NAU.<br>

CowgOqXTaa	Allegations made to CPS are *very* highly protected because as a matter of public policy we want to encourage people to call CPS if they suspect abuse without being afraid that they'll be sued if they are wrong. <br>  <br>  As a result it is *almost* impossible to successfully sue someone for making a false complaint. <br>  <br>  However, deliberately making a false complaint to CPS is a criminal offense, so while the subject of the false allegation may not be able to sue, the State can certainly press criminal charges. The mother should file a formal police complaint. She should also ask the CPS caseworker to do the same - CPS are overworked and REALLY don't appreciate people abusing them for their own purposes.<br>  <br>  Richard|`|OiAl6w48aa	Yes, your friend can sue over that IF she can prove that the report was knowingly made in bad faith.  In other words, she will have to prove that grandma knew the kids were not in danger and was only making the report to further her chances of getting custody.  Not a very easy standard to meet.  <br>  <br>  In the short term, your friend may very well want to consider seeking a temporary restraining order based on harassment.   A TRO will prevent grandma from being able to come and sit on the sidewalk in front of the house.  If she does, your friend can then call the cops and have her arrested.|`|W7bnWOsTaa	technically that's slander, which you can sue for. the CPS will have records of every call and also of what they find when the go round, which, if they have never found anything (which obviously they haven't) would stand up in court as sufficient Evidence of slander.<br>  <br>  good luck to your friend|`|zwJbUbWMaa	I don't think so.  I was always trained that we should always make a CPS report if we ever have any doubt that there is any abuse or neglect going on.  If we have even the slightest doubt then we make the report and from there it is CPS's job to investigate and decide whether or not there is anything going on.  They are well trained and will most likely start to recognize the pattern of grandmother calling, them investigating and finding nothing, and eventually stop following up with her reports.  That is actually a sad case of crying wolf too because there may be one day when she actually sees some real abuse or neglect somewhere and they will ignore her when she does the right thing and reports it.<br>  <br>  It all just depends on if the grandmother truly believes there is neglect when she makes the report.  Whether or not there really is is not the case.  All that matters is if she really believes that she is doing the right thing when she reports.  There are lots of grandparents that think just because their child isn't raising their children the way that they themselves would do it, that they are making mistakes or are harming their children.|`|4q2Z01Qsaa	A person commits a criminal offense (State Jail Felony) if she knowingly makes a report that is false.  <br>  The making of a false report can be grounds for a court to restrict access to the child by the person who made the report.<br>  If she is convicted the court "shall order" the person convicted to pay attorney's fees incurred by the person who was falsely accused of abuse or neglect.|`|AA10091004	Sad story. My mother did that to my oldest brother. He had a visit once and they put on file that he checked out to be fit and noted that our mother's accusations were unfounded. She needs to move and stay away from her mom.  See if she can go to a court and get a protection from abuse, and tell them her mother is mentally and verbally abusing and harrassing her. Then take a copy of the order to CPS so they have it on file.|`|AA11179275	If you could prove that she is lying but if she is convinced she has a legitimate reason to call you can't. |`|j62rw4SCaa	no|`|8f0AJY8gaa	unfortunately no...  However, you can not allow the grandmother into the house and can deny her access to the child.  That way if CPS is called again it can be construed has harassment.|`|6a29fa9432cd11f6628b8d1ef1265ca6aa	Yes, she can be sued for this. She is abusing CPS.

It's a hard life.<br>  <br>  edit// And LOL, saying that black people are voting for Obama only because he is black is saying that white people are voting for McCain only because he is white.|`|j6BrnfvJaa	Simple: IT'S TIME FOR A CHANGE<br>  <br>  you need to think beyond one miniscule detail of his stance on abortion.However, being a woman (although I am only 19) women's rights are very important to me. McCain's abortion policy would mean that even if a woman were raped she wouldn't be able to get an abortion. it's not the government's role to decide what a woman can do to her body. McCain believes men should earn higher salaries than woman and supports the Violence Against Women Act (Makes me wonder how Sarah Palin feels about all this). McCain is the epitome of George Bush aka worst president in history. If you want to get drafted into war then by all means vote for McCain who by the way spends $10 billion a month for a war that is solving nothing. Our troops need out of Iraq. Obama plans to provide health care for everyone and reduce the cost of it for families. He's gonna give tax cuts to 95% of middle class workers. Finally, Obama will make America popular once again. Thanks to George Bush and his lack of a brain, Americans are hated on by countless other countries<br>  <br>  VOTE OBAMA|`|9HrFNoaoaa	Most voters aren't one-issue voters, which seems to be what you are talking about.  <br>  <br>  And what do you mean "premature babies".

They can go back to watching favorite programs on their 1929 model television or better still try to find the NY Times headline on October 30 1929 which states that President Franklin D Rossevelt addressed the nation the day before.

Absentee?<br>  <br>  How is that bashing?  Have you read the headlines about her tenure and lies in Alaska?  Have you watched McCain flip-flop daily on all issues?  This is not the same guy that we saw 8 years ago.  Not to mention the rhetoric coming out of their mouths at rallies.  Even McCain is getting sick of it and I assume his mad dog running mate.<br>  <br>  See the articles below for some information on the two of them.

I do not work, I tried but some days I can walk a little and other days I can't move the right side. I have no control of my butt so I don't smell good enough to be in the workplace. Others have reasons too. Some guys went to jail for being a different color. So, their wife and children still need to eat. AFDC saved their lives. Guy gets out of jail and looks for another job. Boss has to garnish his wages to pay the state back. Guy can't live on that. Selling Crack in the park is what he is forced to do. You republicans think this is bad. It is just like you. You are no different. You think of something you can sell and profit. You also want to start a business and sell a product to the public. You are the same to me a businessman is a businessman. I get so tired of you calling us lazy and worthless. Change the stupid system so we have some hope. So we have some dignity. I will work if you can get someone to carry me to the bathroom every ten minutes and wash my behind.<br>  Many women would work if you go get them in the morning and help them get the kids ready to come along. I know many guys that would love to do something to get ahead. They are not stupid. They just can't think of the devious things you can to make money. They don't just say I'm gonna go out and rip someone off. If they do it it is illegal. If you do it it is business. You rip us off and the government. How about this... Put me on your payroll. I will work for minimum and I will work for you one hour a year. Okay I am now an employee and I am part time so you don't need to give me benefits. I am handicapped so there is a tax break for you. I need to transport my wheelchair to work so I need a minivan Sienna, or Quest, or Oddysey. (Shut-up these are all made in America by Americans. Not South Korea like Chevy or Mexico like Ford...) So, I need a van to get to work. You can buy me one and write it all off your taxes. How about that? Sounds good to me. You did that with your wife's car and she doesn't do anymore for you than I do. I would like a cell phone because I am stuck when my chair's batteries die. Your phone is free you write it off. Can you buy a plan for me and write it off? I didn't think so. Even though it will cost you nothing you still have that business mindset of if I'm not profiting it is not worth my time to do it. How much is your time worth? Eighty bucks a minute? Thirty three thousand dollars a day?|`|p9rbEdpdaa	I've looked at the electoral map. It shows we are coming together...behind Obama.

I do not see hate coming from the Left.  It all seems to emanate from the likes of Rush Limbaugh and Sean Hannity and the rest of that ilk.  Nobody likes to have vicious lies told about them.  That is what divides the country.  So quit patrionizing any advertisers that advertise on Limbaugh's show or on Fox and write to the FCC and tell them to take away all of Fox's broadcasting licenses.|`|OIQvZ87gaa	Elections are always like this because people feel strongly in what they believe to be the truth about their candidate. Although this election is very different because the liberal media is blatantly out for one candidate over another and determined to get him elected so all we hear is slanted information. You really have to investigate yourself to get to the truth if you can find it and then make your decision. I think the media is to blame for all the division. They can't let the facts stand for themselves, they have to turn and twist them to the advantage of their candidate. The polls are also a factor. They are always proven wrong, but they seem to keep using them. |`|F4IjI9qaaa	One of the great things about this country is that we are all allowed to say what's on our minds - no matter how "dumb".<br>  <br>  We recognize this and, unlike many countries, will still show up to vote without fear of being killed.<br>  <br>  Wouldn't it be great if we could all discuss and disagree in a civilized manner?

Since there is such a clear contrast in the candidates and their campaign styles they bring out the extremes of both sides. <br>  <br>  Thankfully though our next president will have the charisma to bring the country back together. Hopefully we are on the verge of seeing a new type of political race trend, it would be good if after this more people choose to address what they themselves will do and focus less on mud.

I don't understand how folks can in good faith vote for Obama with all his skeletons in the closet and Socialistic ideas.

I just want to make sure that everybody who is behind you, that they've got a chance for success too," Obama responded.

It just says that expectations are high because of the excitement over the election.  People are putting words into his mouth and expecting miracles, and he needs to remind them of reality as he did in his acceptance speech.  NOBODY could fix the current situation in 100 days.  If it could be done, Bush would have done it by now and McCain probably would have won as a result.  Everyone should know this situation is going to take time to resolve, but he needs to remind some of his more overly exuberant supporters of that before they start putting more words in his mouth and making him sound like a miracle worker.|`|84871326f6678fb2f9c40486796e4ebbaa	Not to worry...everything that CAN be done will be done.

Yes, it will take time to turn this country around and going in the right direction.  Atleast he was upfront with the country by saying that it will take time for him to do what he wants to do.

AA10664307	Yes. There are several articles at the Chicago Sun-Times website you can search through. Especially search for the articles dating between 2004-2006.<br>  <br>  You missed probably the most important lie on your list, however. Obama promised the people of Illinois that he would NOT run for president. Keep in mind, he has only been in the Senate for not quite four years, yet two of those four he has been campaigning for president. The full article is linked below. Here are some quotes from that article, dating back to 11/4/2004:<br>  <br>  Ridiculing it as "a silly question," Democrat Barack Obama pledged Wednesday he would resist any overtures to run for president or vice president before the end of his six-year term as a U.S. senator.<br>  <br>  "I was elected yesterday," Obama said. "I have never set foot in the U.S. Senate. I've never worked in Washington. And the notion that somehow I'm immediately going to start running for higher office just doesn't make sense.<br>  "So look, I can unequivocally say I will not be running for national office in four years, and my entire focus is making sure that I'm the best possible senator on behalf of the people of Illinois."<br>  <br>  "I am not running for president in 2008," Obama said. "I mean, come on guys. The only reason I'm being definitive is because until I'm definitive you will keep asking me this question, but it's a silly question."<br>  <br>  |`|X6PO2LZXaa	read the protocols of the elders of zion, then go run and hide somewhere....dork|`|0iVz6eCKaa	factcheck.org<br>  snopes.com<br>  <br>  Read dumby!|`|VyU2d8Ohaa	where is your proof?|`|iqGY5jvfaa	BONG!!!!!!!!!<br>  <br>  I JUST NEED 2 POINTS TO ASK SOME QUESTIONS.<br>  <br>  HE HE|`|AA10265144	Obama skipped 95% of senate votes, but voted against funding our troops.|`|eluInD1Aaa	No, and your question has no proof at all.

He was one of the first to attempt to manipulate public opinion using the psychology of the subconscious (propaganda) --  which has nothing to do with republicans in specific, and everything to do with the fact that he was a world-famous PR guy at the time. <br>  <br>  Goebbels read one of Bernays' books. The Nazi's use of the book to support a deliberate, planned campaign of negative PR against the Jews has nothing to do with the republicans or McCain.<br>  <br>  This seems to be much more the type of book that Obama would read, with the persuasive speechifying that has swayed so many while saying so little.<br>  <br>  |`|KcAehrrKaa	Hitler taught them everything. Also, people say Obama is Hitler, they are idiots.|`|acWyJ3t0aa	Totally false , but since when do the Democrats care about the truth as truth to them is what ever Obama says and only what he says . |`|bK5MJCxhaa	I don't know, but I suspect that Carl Rove learned everything he knows about propaganda from the Nazis.|`|EfcS6HwJaa	Learnt lol....that's a new one.

But, the fact is that many, many Americans are only a few paychecks from homelessness or serious financial crisis, the Iraq war is doing a lot of harm (and has killed 4000 Americans), global warming is threatening farming and nature, the energy crisis is making us dependent on countries we don't want to be dependent on, and health care is an overpriced luxury for many people.

9PAavWnyaa	Yes, much better. Free market = competition. Teachers need to compete for merit raises, and for the retention of their jobs. The unions prevent this and it is the students who suffer. I am all for vouchers. |`|AA10929465	"So this forces schools to try harder"<br>  <br>  There's the problem.

I do have to say though that the school that they do go to does very well with what they have,|`|0iVz6eCKaa	No. privatizing schools would lead to a further seperation of classes. Rich kids get the best education poor kids get trash.  Our schools should have stricter policies nationwide. We just kinda let them go. Equal education for all.  <br>  Thats like privitizing the police force.|`|4c2e5d9e10f23cb24ac709dd1d50dfe6aa	Sure, of course that works "better".  But our goal is not education; educated people would vote out the current government.  We just want socialized daycare for well-occupied working parents.|`|GbeF6gQuaa	Yes, I think that the european model is better.  Public schools here are under-performing socialist brian washing machines.|`|wNcTEADJaa	Yes, and if they don't make the grades they are kicked out as the governments investment in that child was poor.|`|a556Z3NTaa	Nothing will work as long as kids don't find any interest in education<br>  we need better syllabus |`|joh3VNcZaa	Sounds good to me.|`|94b31ad970dd548d692cda0b0f8b72fdaa	Been watching the "free market" lately?

This country needs so much repair domestically and abroad, that the partisan infighting has prevented just about anything of import from getting done.  I'm sick to death of it.  At least this way, something will get done for a change.  If the country doesn't like it, it will vote in a Republican Congress next time around.  That's nothing new either.  Look at Bush's rubber stamp Republican Congress.  The country finally said "enough!" and turned the Congress Democratic.  Same principle.<br>  <br>  EDIT:<br>  Your add'l details are incorrect.

Our country is deeply divided politically and emotionally,  We owe China our lives at this point and our healthcare system is unavailable to 47 million of us.<br>  Or we can go bankrupt trying to pay the medical bills.<br>  Our elderly have to sell their memories to keep themselves in nursing homes, and we begrudge them every cent.<br>  We would have to look hard to get any lower, so anything is an improvement<br>  In the past fourteen years we have had a Republican congress for twelve years.

You first salute the recruiter and and then ask "Permission to go ashore", you will get a "permission granted" and then a salute which you return, and then you salute the flag and leave.|`|d9baWh0haa	The proper way to address your recruiter, depending on her rank, whether she is a Petty Officer or a Chief, is to simply call her Petty Officer (if she is a Petty Officer) or Chief ( if she is a Chief).  Simple as that, because this will be the only way you will address your RDC's (Recruit Division Commanders) in boot camp. And because your not in any type of Navy (Government Issued) uniform you wouldn't have to salute her.

OfmVD4QXaa	Sistemi di voto negli Usa, un menu molto vario<br>  <br>  REGISTRAZIONE DEGLI ELETTORI - Una manciata di stati permette la registrazione nello stesso giorno del voto, mentre la maggior parte chiude le liste circa un mese prima delle elezioni. La registrazione in contemporanea al voto potrebbe aumentare l'affluenza alle urne, ma per i critici è potenzialmente foriera di frodi, perché non c'è tempo per le verifiche.<br>  La legge federale richiede agli stati di eliminare dalle liste coloro che sono morti o si sono trasferiti. Alcuni stati lo fanno cancellando gli elettori che non rispondono alle lettere ufficiali, oppure eliminando le persone i cui dati non sono coerenti con quelli di altri database governativi, come l'elenco delle patenti di guida o della Social Security. I critici si lamentano che per un semplice errore di battitura si possa perdere il diritto di voto.<br>  Alcuni stati riammettono automaticamente al voto chi ha finito di scontare una pena, mentre altri richiedono una complicata procedura. In questi ultimi, alcuni elettori con fedina penale immacolata hanno detto di essere stati cancellati dalle liste, perché il loro nome era simile a quello di condannati.<br>  Entrambi i partiti maggiori si sono attivati per registrare un gran numero di nuovi elettori ed ognuno ha accusato l'altro di avere richiesto false registrazioni. I supervisori elettorali sostengono che i falsi vengono puntualmente individuati e cancellati, garantendo la regolarità del voto.<br>  IDENTIFICAZIONE DEGLI ELETTORI AI SEGGI - Secondo la legge federale, chi vota per la prima volta deve presentare un documento di riconoscimento valido con foto. Gli stati sono poi liberi di chiedere dei requisiti supplementari e molti lo fanno.<br>  C'è spesso confusione tra gli elettori sui documenti da portare al seggio. Alcuni si convincono addirittura a non andare a causa di false notizie, secondo cui verrebbe loro impedito il voto se i controlli di identità mostrassero che devono ancora versare le tasse o non hanno pagato un biglietto del parcheggio.<br>  DIFFICOLTA' AI SEGGI - Sono di diversa natura: macchinari che non partono, affluenza superiore alle attese, difficoltà a reclutare scrutatori o impossibilità di reperire abbastanza cabine elettorali. Agli elettori in fila all'ora di chiusura dei seggi viene normalmente permesso di votare, ma sono gli stati e le contee ai decidere se prolungare l'orario.<br>  MACCHINE PER VOTARE E CONTEGGIO DEI VOTI - Una sfida serrata tra candidati porta a chiedersi se sia stato contato ogni voto e chiedere l'eventuale riconteggio, come avvenuto in Florida nel 2000, quando la competizione all'ultimo voto tra George W. Bush e Al Gore ritardò il risultato per la Casa Bianca.<br>  Sono gli stati o i singoli distretti a decidere quale tecnologia usare. In 24 stati sono in uso macchine elettroniche o macchine a leva per votare. In quelli dove ci sono ancora le schede di carta, si ricorre a scanner elettronici per lo spoglio.<br>  I problemi sorgono quando le macchine si rompono o il software è difettoso e quando il numero degli elettori che hanno firmato al seggio non combacia con il numero delle schede da scrutinare.<br>  VOTO ANTICIPATO/VOTO PER CORRISPONDENZA - Un terzo degli elettori avrà votato prima dell'election day sia per posta che in seggi aperti prima.<br>  Il voto per corrispondenza può innescare nuove polemiche perché alcuni distretti richiedono che sia recapitato entro l'election day, altri che il timbro postale porti la data di quel giorno. Gli elettori all'estero sono in difficoltà se vivono in luoghi dove la posta non è affidabile.<br>  Si è dibattuto molto se la scadenza sia da estendere per i militari all'estero, tradizionalmente più vicini ai repubblicani. Inoltre, il voto per posta è stato in passato fonte di brogli, dato che è difficile dimostrare che sia davvero quello della persona il cui nome compare sulla busta.<br>  ELETTORI DELLE MINORANZE - La legge federale proibisce la discriminazione razziale o etnica e richiede che le schede siano stampate in altre lingue laddove vi siano comunità numerose con limitata conoscenza dell'inglese.<br>  Gli stati o i comuni con una storia di discriminazione devono ottenere l'approvazione federale prima di cambiare la loro legge elettorale. Ma in pratica, le minoranze come i neri dicono di essere spesso dissuase dal recarsi alle urne, perché i seggi nelle loro circoscrizioni non sono sufficientemente equipaggiati, le verifiche di identità sproporzionatamente lunghe o perché ricevono false informazioni sulle modalità del voto e gli orari dei seggi<br>  |`|spJOlPTMaa	NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!|`|IKnX1S1iaa	per quanto riguarda le scuole votano si ma nelle palestre e nn nelle aule..poi nei luoghi "pubblici" o che possono essere utilizzati come tali|`|z5RlQsIyaa	palestre, scuole, atri, chiese...|`|Hd9ub6Rvaa	Non solo<br>  oggi ho sentito che McCain ha votato in una chiesa, mi pare|`|87XOFa0Baa	no votano nelle chiese e nei comuni ciao<br>  |`|VBpzsJQIaa	nelle chiese nei comuni........

I am surprised that we aren't attacked more.|`|nOFvdF9yaa	Possibilities? The USA is already a terrorist nation to many nations. Actually, the word or the term:"Terrorism" is the factor! What's terrorism indeed? Those, who become terror to me is a terrorist to me, agree? Then go & find so many nations who of course claim the US as a terrorist nation. Funny thing is this, when one speaks about the US terrorism, all the American civilians take the blame on their own shoulder! Whereas certain people or certain nation never blame the innocent Americans. But when few terrorists are seen in country like Bangladesh, Pakistan, Algeria, Somalia etc, then the whole Americans think the whole of those nations as terrorists! US uses to forget that the evil actions are done by some policy-makers or by particular notorious political persons. You will get the true picture here: just think, the particular nations who use to blame USA now, are also waiting for Mr. Obama to come! Why? Because they expect that a changed policy might come! That's the key point------ the very policy sometimes taken by some American policy-makers, that becomes terror-flavored or basically terrorism.    |`|1b47d266c534a22e56fed1ec2c0bf117aa	Terrorist Nation????<br>  When Terrorists from (mostly) Arabia blew up the World Trade Center, did you accuse Arabia of being a terrorist nation?<br>  The US will have some explaining to do about the Syria incident but you can't stamp the US nation a terrorist Nation because of the misdeeds of a few foolish soldiers...can you?...will you?|`|SWkaGJpgaa	I have more faith in the US military telling the truth than I do in some lackey lickspittle of Bashir Assad telling the truth.<br>  <br>  Of course the Syrians are going to say it was innocent civilians and children.

Man you people are pathetic.<br>  <br>  People voting for Obama aren't narrow-minded enough to base their vote on the price of gas.  There's a much greater cause here.  Please, give it a few months, you will see what real love looks like.  You will see how liberationists love.|`|236b0efe0cd727ee742018b701390d03aa	2.88 here. Where do you live?<br>  I have use for Obama or McCain. So long as they play ball, I'm sure they'll be more effective than our current administration. As much money as Obama has taken from the large corporations, I trust he'll play ball. Most economists seem to agree.<br>  I'd prefer McCain for ideological reasons. Because he's a free market guy, because he's strong on defense. But the broader picture tells me that this election isn't pivotal. |`|GFLPgtDAaa	nope i need some welfare checks to roll in the mail i want my money back from wall street and i want my family members out of that war.  I still need him.|`|lRFkow1Raa	It's still at $2.60 where I live, lucky you.|`|jkKAMm1Naa	I had a feeling you did crack.<br>  <br>  I think McCain has no use for Palin now that gas is below 2 dollars a gallon.<br>  <br>  Clearly McCain chose her in part because he thought gas prices would be the top issue, and she has a background in energy..... but then, darn it, something changed, and economy imploded...and gas prices went down.<br>  <br>  It doesnt surprise me that you're from Alabama...which is known for some of the worst test scores from school-aged children in the country. |`|4obQz3FSaa	actually, how about we quit the whole oil habit all together? <br>  <br>  it would cause less global conflicts and save the environment at the same time.<br>  <br>  new technologies need people to pioneer them and create them meaning an awful lot of new jobs.<br>  <br>  if your someones cancer looks like it is no longer present should they stop looking for a cure?|`|9Vchzon2aa	Another republican trying to make Obama supporters look bad.

And no, we're not all stupid, but I'm pretty sure oil companies are not actually the devil and electing either man will not lead to an apocalypse.|`|YupMCYHlaa	I sure care!  I've pointed out here many times that money has become not the most important thing in politics but the -only- important things.  Before a candidate can even announce his candidacy he has to make 'deals' to get the money.  So by the time you even SEE him, he's already sold out.<br>  <br>  And, as you point out, since both parties get their money from the same sources, there's no reason to think their agendas would be that much different.<br>  <br>  That being said, I still think Obama is the better of the two choices.  He's far from my ideal president, but of the two choices I pick Obama.  McCain is just too beholden to the standard Republican agenda, the failed Bush-era policies.  Obama at least has the chance for change.|`|qksvRJIyaa	The thing with Obama is he likes to pretend he hasn't been in Washington long enough to be corrupted. He's pure and hasn't been infected by the evil doers. BS!!! But as long as his followers believe it, then in their eyes he can do no wrong. Even when presented with the facts. We know McCain is corrupt, WTF have we NOT found out about how corrupt Obama has been? It's all slowly starting to come out. |`|63c199397a307505e128e69aead4d08daa	The special interest groups really don't care who wins. They simply want the winner to be "in their pocket", so they support all the candidates. That way the special interest groups are always on the winning side, and the rich get richer. |`|FVKIscpBaa	That's what corrporations do.  "One of these two will win, why not give them both money, and we're covered no matter what happens?"  Sadly the way the world works.|`|3gd8jGSLaa	Because thats just business, kid.

And it's only going to get worse.|`|kUlZCbhNaa	Bush, Paulsen and Bernanke have stolen the money and have it hidden in one of those swiss bank accounts.|`|uef7Vmxkaa	It hasn't gone away but has grown.|`|nrIxatRMaa	It got lowered to 700 billion and given to a bunch of losers! |`|5ac2dCxJaa	So far it is up to about $5 trillion. Here’s why the plan for the government to recover the money is whistling in the dark: It calls for banks to “earn their way out of debt” by selling more of their product – credit, that is, debt. Homeowners and other consumers, students and car buyers, credit card users and their employers – the “taxpayers” supposed to be helped – are to pay the repayment money to the banks, instead of using it to purchase goods and services. If they charge only 6% per year, they will extract $93 billion in interest charges – $42 billion to pay the Treasury for its $700 billion, and another $51 billion for the Federal Reserve’s $850 billion in “cash for trash” loans.<br>  <br>  Like I said the banks have to "earn" their way out of the mess, which is to increase usury and ultimately implode before it could possibly pay back the bailout so that teh American people receive their "profits". <br>  To answer in a more matter of fact manner the money given to the banks is in the banks accounts. The reason it is not in the system is that banks a keeping their powder dry, they won't loan to each other or the public simply because the next shoe to drop such as auto loans, consumer credit (cards) and the next wave of sub prime and ballon loans to re set 1st quarter of 2009 will require more capital to ride out. The hoarding is strategic and the end of this is far off.

Consider larger vehicles like semis or buses which would be higher off the ground and thus able to look at your birthday suit's accessories.|`|VB3ZK5f9aa	Public nudity is illegal, but it is not connected to the act of driving.<br>  One could claim (male) that you aren't visibly nude, so not exposing yourself, but I doubt you would win.<br>  <br>  Interesting defense:  Do it in a small sports car, and claim you are clothed because you are 'wearing' the car.  You could get quotes from car magazines and reviews where they use that phrase.

I believe we are more then ready.  I simply wish that the one nominated more accurately reflected my normative and policy beliefs.  It's sad really.

Fact.|`|AA11404720	He meant that if you make a lot of money, you should be giving it to people who don't. Meaning he taxes the rich and gives money to the poor. He is going with a money redistribution that reminds me of communism where everyone has the same amount of everything. I am not rich, but if you are you work hard for your money and I don't think he should raise taxes to give it to others. After all, rich people already have to pay tax on all of the money they make so they give away their good share.|`|ubCYzAzwaa	Did you figure this all out on your own? Good!

Would it be fair for everyone to pay $5000.00 a year in taxes no matter if you made $12000.00 a year or $2,000,000.00?  Biden said that the average working person has gotten the short end of the stick.  Meaning the middle income people pay a higher percent of their earnings in taxes than the rich.  A flat tax rate of 15% for everyone has been discussed thru the years.  That seems fair if they would eliminate ALL the loopholes that the rich people and rich businesses take advantage of.|`|3LuejgR6aa	Hey many of the people that most benefitted from the Bush tax cuts were people making over $500K a year and coincidentaly were the same people so damn set on sending our young men and women to the Iraq war.

And we will not be able to keep money we earned as much as we want. It is not fair for people who make less money than us, so we have to give our money to them like it or not. It is redistribution of money by government. When Sarah Palin said that, Biden countered it, but that is what happened though.|`|UcF86tBOaa	No, he meant it was fair to raise their taxes back to where they were before they were given the last tax break.

tw2HHGMFaa	molti a questa domanda rispondono  che gli italiani non vogliono fare certi lavori. sono tutte balle!!! la verità è che non vogliono essere sottopagati.  hanno famiglia casa da pagare e tutto ciò che segue. esempio: anni fa per mungere le mucche pagavano due milioni delle vecchie lire al mese.gli extra comunitari  lo facevano per 500 mila lire dormivano in stalle  il cibo lo dava il padrone.lo stesso  avveniva nei campi.per  la raccolta degli ortaggi. nei cantieri manovali a poco prezzo  tutto in nero e così via.non è vero che gli italiani non hanno voglia di fare lavori pesanti. non si possono fare in quelle condizioni e sottopagati.ogni giorno ci fanno vedere in TV che  dormono  in baracche  case pericolanti abbaini ecc. ecc. perché non hanno a seguito la famiglia. voglio vedere quando si ricongiungono con la famiglia e avranno tutte le problematiche che comporta il caso .figli a scuola casa da pagare luce telefono, ecc. ecc. se si accontenteranno dei soldi che gli danno ora.i datori di lavoro che pagassero gli italiani come vanno pagati  e vedrete  quanti fanno i lavori sopra citati.La storia insegna,siamo sempre stato un popolo di grandi lavoratori riconosciuti da tutto il mondo e loro non devono certo venire a dirci che non vogliamo lavorare.|`|4f8OkKvyaa	C'è poco da dire! Italia è quella che stai vedendo!<br>  Italiani spesso viziati! poco volenterosi! tutti vogliono fare i medici, ma senza studiare...<br>  La politica di certo non incoraggia! vedi politici che non fanno assolutamente niente e prendono stipendi da capogiro,... tutti sono coinvolti, le TV, i giornali, la scuola, la sanità, in ogni settore ci sono fottiture.<br>  Le TV ci parlano solo di cose che attirano l' attenzione, la politica dice alla TV di dire cazzate, per allontanare dalla mente delle  persone i veri problemi,... per esempio ci raccontano delle storie d'amore dei giocatori di calcio, ci raccontano di leggi inventate per creare scompiglio, infatti, facendo una legge del c.a.z.z.o si fa un po' di casino cosi tutti ne parlano e pensando a questa legge di mer... non pensano ad altro ed i problemi reali restano... Ti chiedi perchè? Perche i problemi seri sono difficili da risolvere e si spera sempre di far faticari i prossimi che verranno....|`|7teDoABRaa	Prima di tutto la pubblicità che hai visto si riferisce ai flussi che, nella maggior parte dei casi, serve per regolarizzare una persona che già è qui e lavora e quindi non "ruba" il lavoro a nessuno. <br>  Tempo fà ci serviva un assistente per mio nonno gravemente ammalato e all'annuncio di lavoro hanno risposto solo donne dell'est, nessun italiano.Quindi se gli italiani non vogliono fare assistente anziani non è certo un problema degli stranieri..<br>  <br>  Ti farebbe piacere che la gente del paese in cui tu hai lavorato per 5 anni pensassero di te che hai "rubato" loro il lavoro?|`|A5RVr45Jaa	guarda non voglio essere pessimista ma secondo me andremo a finire male e quasi sicuramente l'idea di far venire gli stranieri e solo una tattica per far abbassare gli stipendi, cosi l'operaio costa meno e l'ho stato puo' chiedere piu tasse alle imprese e  noi pian piano doppo tutti gli scioperi dei nostri genitori e nonni per i diritti dei lavoratori,noi pecoroni stiamo facendo tornare lo schiavismo ciao bello|`|UbbOm5Laaa	Penso che servirà soltanto a toglierlo agli italiani, che già ne hanno poco... <br>  Inoltre secondo me, è tutta una scusa, perchè costano di meno perchè sfruttabili.

In particolare:<br>   1. Il Prodotto Interno Lordo (un indicatore globale della ricchezza prodotta da ogni nazione) cresce meno di quello europeo . Gli italiani cioè stanno diventando relativamente più poveri (o meno ricchi) degli altri Paesi <br>  2. In Italia la percentuale delle persone al lavoro nella fascia di età fra 15 e i 65 anni è più bassa della media europea. Tale differenza è cresciuta in tutti gli anni ’90 fino ad arrivare a -10% nel 2002 <br>  3. La produttività media dell’Italia, cioè la ricchezza prodotta da ogni lavoratore (uno degli indicatori della competitività di un Paese) dal 2006 è sotto la media europea e (unico caso in Europa, con l’eccezione del Lussemburgo) è addirittura calata in termini assoluti <br>  4. Gli stipendi dei lavoratori italiani sono più bassi del 10-15% rispetto alla media dei Paesi europei più sviluppati e la differenza dal 1997 in poi è andata costantemente aumentando <br>  5. L’Italia ha una scarsa capacità di attrarre capitali stranieri <br>  6. Il debito pubblico italiano è superiore alla media dei Paesi europei, anche se nel 2007 la differenza si è ridotta<br>  7. In Italia la distanza di reddito fra ricchi e poveri è andata aumentando fino a diventare più ampia che in tutti gli altri Paesi europei (con l’eccezione del Portogallo)."<br>  <br>  <br>  "Dal 1950 al 1990 l’Italia ha conosciuto un periodo di forte sviluppo economico, reso possibile soprattutto dai bassi salari e dalle frequenti svalutazioni della lira. Il declino dall’inizio degli anni ’90 è dovuto all’accresciuta concorrenza di Paesi con costi salariali più bassi e alla stabilizzazione della lira seguita poi dall’introduzione dell’euro"|`|o92uUZKaaa	In Italia siamo precipitati contua assenza a quasi 1000000<br>  clandestini,cresce solo criminalità.<br>  Regolarizzando qualche parte di irregolari saranno visibili più<br>  delinquenti inutili perlo stato.In tanto contributo che da per crescita economica immigrazione e incredibile.Vediamo che cosa si cambia.<br>  Penso che e chiaro per te che sei stato fuori a lavorare.

Not to mention he was a highly decorated and esteemed GENERAL in the united States army for a good part of his life. How many liberal democratic generals do you think are out there (he was not one of them). It seems if he is willing to endorse Obama most any half intelligent, undecided, voter should think he is more than "just a guy with an opinion"..

You have not been taught the truth about the communism that Obama espouses. <br>  <br>  At 18 you haven't worked hard to build a business and support your family... and then be told by Obama that he wants to take the money you have earned and give it to lazy people.<br>  <br>  At 18 you haven't learned the lessons that life experience alone can teach. At 18 you haven't seen the holocaust that was beaten back by this country.<br>  <br>  At 18, you are not a Democrat, you are someone who has been taught lies by a liberal educational system.<br>  <br>  At 18 there is still hope for you as you experience real life. Your parents might well understand...they may have been Democrats also before they grew up. When you see the damage that liberalism does, and your money given to special interests...you might grow up too.<br>  <br>  When you grow up you will hopefully grow a backbone also, and won't want to promote the class warfare that Democrats promote. When you grow up... you might value lower taxes when you see how much the government rips you off.<br>  <br>  Unfortunately some people never grow up,, they remain Democrats all their lives. They whine and cry because they aren't getting enough welfare. They hate people who succeed at something they were too lazy to try.<br>  <br>  Hopefully you will grow up and be a Conservative...not a linp wristed<br>  Liberal.|`|Z6lhZiXsaa	Lol that would be funny. You're parents shouldn't really care who you vote for as long as you are informed and know why you're voting for Obama. They should be happy you've looked into the issues and made your own decision! A lot of kids just go along with their parents' political views without questioning it. But of course, if you're parents are judgmental and you think it would just start some big argument between you guys voting is a private thing and you don't have to tell them.|`|dBwLflHfaa	Just tell them if they are too stuck up to accept it then you've obviously got some serious family issues anyway.

They'll understand. I was pretty liberal at that age, too. <br>  <br>  <br>  Did someone here say don't tell because they'll throw you out when you graduate? Shouldn't you already be thinking about being on your own when you graduate?|`|59JS5lnhaa	I doubt your parents base their love for you on your political views, so don't worry so much.

At the same time it gets pretty monotonous sitting back while they blast your candidate of choice and then look to laugh along with them.  Don't let that happen.  If you want to avoid confrontation just say something like " I don't think he's that bad" or " I don't think making fun of people is right"  In any event if you decide to say, screw it, I'm letting them know, make sure you do research, I wouldn't categorize myself as a democrat, but I'm voting for Obama while my roomate is voting for McCain.  As long as you can give GOOD REASONS for why, that make sense, you shouldn't have too much trouble.|`|5GUCkELlaa	You really need to ask yourself why you are voting for Barak.  Also if your parents have afforded you a decent life, why would you punish them by voting for some one who wants to take their hard earned money and giving to those who either haven't worked as hard, haven't been as diligent, or for what ever reason a person hasn't been successful. Also, why do you want to elect some one who would CHANGE this country from what has made it a great nation to a nation of give aways.|`|zYNqPJqLaa	eh, maybe it might just be best not to tell them... I have members in my family who do not know that I am a liberal, even though I am a political science major, with some people it may just be better not to tell them your political ideology.

ixJrlCqXaa	My husband is a debt collector for a major bank here in the UK, and I can tell you that if your friend has things in the house they can repo them... but it also means they can take away things that aren't necessarily his if no one can produce ownership for them.  For example, if you bought the sofa, but don't have any receipts (credit cards or bills from the store where you have paperwork), the bailiffs can take away the sofa.  You or your friend need to produce ownership for your things.... they'll take anything they can get some kind of money for. DVDs, CDs, television, furniture, kettle.... just about everything to pay off the debt.  So if they're coming and he's not there, be sure you either move your things or have proof they're yours nearby.|`|3jgbOGnMaa	I worked in the court a few months back as administrative staff, and although I did not deal with these things myself I often heard people phoning in and asking the same question. It was mostly parents phoning and asking that if their children had outstanding fines and if the bailiffs came around can they take anything of them (the parents)? Fortunately they cannot take anything from anyone else that does not belong to her, but the other thing is that she might give them some of your stuff to settle the debt and then she will tell you guys that she could not stop them! I know for a fact that they can't take anything from you, so you'll want to ask yourself how well do you know this person and if you trust her?|`|ykxbI0HVaa	be carefull do not let them in best not to answer door they will try and tell you they can take what they want and its all legal but they are lying they are very sly and nasty people|`|NbiJcMIvaa	Even though it is a communal student house, all the students most likely have their own private living quarters. Since you know when the baliff is coming, make sure you are present in the house when they arrive. If they try to access your living area, demand to see the court order. If your name does not appear on it, and the seizure order states only your housemate's assets and residence area, then tell them to get lost. They may state that it is reasonable to believe your housemate is trying to conceal assets in your living area, but that's nonsense. If they get insistant and pushy, tell them to get a court order with your name on it. Only then would I let them enter. If they force their way past you, call the police because that's illegal entry and trespassing. If they make any physical contact with you, then that's assault.

She needs to walk away and have zero contact.<br>  <br>  His family may be freaking out as your aunt knows things. They may all be in danger of being deported. The probable idea is that they are still messing with her so that she feels intimidated and that will keep her from pursuing legal avenues.

f0pBeJajaa	Okay, does the term "illegal" mean anything to you? It is against the law. Does this not raise a red flag or two?<br>  <br>  Beyond that, do you realize that there are 30 million people who are enjoying the fruits of America most of whom are getting paid cash under the table and therefore don't pay taxes, yet still get education, healthcare, police and fire protection and all the other things taxes pay for? Something for nothing, I believe it's called.<br>  <br>  The effect on crime is incalculable! Here in Colorado just last month an illegal who had been pulled over no less than 12 times before under various aliases killed a young girl and her mom when he plowed his vehicle into a Baskin Robbins. Since he was "undocumented" it was difficult to keep track of him and his crimes until something major had happened.<br>  <br>  Last year, again here in Colorado (and I understand California and New Mexico have FAR more prevelance in these cases) an illegal committed murder and ran back over the border to Mexico. Why wasn't he caught? No Colorado ID, no home of record, no record of workplaces, no known associates... no way to track him. I'm not sure what his extradition status is, though I believe he was caught by the Mexicans.<br>  <br>  There is a morale question too (not "moral") You have 30 million people in the United States that don't WANT to be Americans - they want to take what they can, drink the milk without buying the cow, however you want to phrase it. EVERY emigrant group previously has desired to BECOME American - the Irish, the Germans, The Dutch, the Russian, the Cubans... they all WANTED to be a part of the melting pot, but the illegals, they just want to use us.<br>  <br>  On that issue, also keep in mind that the majority of the money the illegals "earn" is not put back into our economy, it is wired to relatives in Mexico, so Mexico and Mexicans are getting free money at the expense of our economy.<br>  <br>  Lastly, as someone in the military, it irks me to no end that the 30 million illegals in a time of crisis - if a draft were instituted - would have no obligation to defend this country that gives them so much. They are under no obligation to give back, to sacrifice, or to defend this great country.<br>  <br>  Getting something for nothing, that's all they are about. I believe the term for that is a parasite.|`|AA11313983	Because they are breaking the law!  No one should be granted citizenship while actively breaking the law.<br>  <br>  People immigrate legally every day, so no one can tell me it's impossible.|`|jd14u32qaa	If they are already here, then they have broken the law by entering the country illegally.  They should be sent back to their own country.  Anyone that wishes to come here LEGALLY should be able to apply for citizenship.|`|4810f1ddde8104d49db91aaae4bcd680aa	With citizenship comes privilege.  One of the most important privileges of citizenship is the right to vote.  That is not something that people should be allowed to steal.<br>  <br>  I can understand the economics of allowing people who have lived here illegally for years and made a life here the opportunity to stay here.  A permanent green card (with no chance for citizenship) would be OK with me.  But to reward them with citizenship would be wrong and open the door for more illegal entry.<br>  <br>  Giving illegal immigrants the right to vote is a bit like giving a car thief the title to the car.|`|WBDsKwylaa	Since advocates for illegals believes every illegal from ever corner of the world should be allowed to  have instant citizenship.Even those in jails they believe can be rehab. Advocates for illegals have made a new gospel that document fraud is alright, it's alright as long as the illegal can cheat the system and Mexico's people come before Americans. Have you notice illegals resent and hate the America Military- I wore my Fort Hood Army T -shirt and the illegals were not happy-they were balking something in Spanish, I did catch Gringo and pointed at me t-shirt over at Walmart|`|Uk4OwRtMaa	What incentive would there be for someone to do it the legal way if illegals were just given citizenship. If I just walked into Canada or Mexico, I wouldn't expect those countries to automatically grant me citizenship.<br>  Let anyone in this country illegally return to their country, apply for a visa, and then follow the legal route to citizenship. Many folks do it this way.<br>  If they want to come for work, there are visas and guest worker programs for that already.|`|spuz7DvNaa	The key word here is illegal. They have disrespected our laws and crossed our borders instead of applying legally to come to America. Many work for cash and do not pay taxes. They take jobs that should be for Americans first. They drive down wages. They create unfair competition in the market and drive some people out of business.<br>  <br>  <br>  The link below will provide you with all the information you need as to the cost of illegal immigration to America.|`|8Sg2nj4zaa	I am all for anyone trying to have a better life and be happy but the fact is that they are illegal. They are breaking the law and that cannot be rewarded with automatic citizenship. Although some will tell you that it is too dificult to do it the right way, becoming a U.S. citizen is not very hard however it may take a couple of years. Even still you can be granted temporary work visas and things like that while in the process. I think it also has a lot to do with a matter of national security, after all we know nothing about the hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrants that come here every year, or their intentions. Hope this helps, good luck with the paper.|`|M9yQdxchaa	well being an immigrant myself its not fair that some one can come here illegally when my family had to go through this whole legal process to even get the visa to come here and then it took another 12 years to get a citizenship.<br>  <br>  also with out the background checks who knows what these people are bringing into the country<br>  <br>  And if they are given citizenship, will they vote for our next president?

t4LMyEPnaa	A case against your former employer would be difficult to win for several reasons.<br>  <br>  First, you have not described any discrimination based on gender, race, ethnicity, or religion. Neither have you stated any facts to believe that your case would fit within any other protected areas, eg whistle-blower, exercising a right, etc.<br>  <br>  You have discussed conduct by your boss and coworkers which would be described as rude and outrageous, it does not sound like it was for an illegal reason. Quite simply people at work can be difficult. And unfortunately this is common.<br>  <br>  The medical issues (asthma) you have discussed would also not be sufficient for a claim under the American with Disabilities Act (ADA) and your employer is only required to accommodate you. Since you quit, you probably did not ask for accommodation by your employer. <br>  <br>  You should have filed a workers compensation claim for the emotional distress you had on the job. In a lawsuit emotional distress is not usually recognized without a physical injury.<br>  <br>  Also, it is doubtful, since you are unemployed, that you can afford to sue your former employer. The costs of the case would be large: depositions, filing fees, to name a few. In addition, you would have to hire a lawyer unless you found one to take your case on a contingency. Not many would since as I stated above your case is tenuous.<br>  <br>  Finally, an employment/labor lawsuit can and often does take from 3 to 5 years to litigate and your life would be on hold for that period of time. Generally employers who are sued fight back pretty hard and invade the privacy of the plaintiff, you. Some people think that an employer will settle to avoid the embarrassment, not true! Since you would be asking for emotional distress damages, your medical records would be subject to disclosure. Possibly medical records for your whole life.<br>  <br>  Unemployment can be difficult enough without also having to deal with an expensive lawsuit. And if you sue and lose, you could be required to pay the costs of your former employer.|`|AA10934212	You can sue anyone for any reason but in your case I'd say just forget it and move on.  First, most governmental organizations are exempt from being sued or allow such a low possible payoff that no lawyer will take the case.  Second, I can't see where you suffered any harm.  People get insulted in all jobs.  Most give it back in kind or just consider the source and ignore it.  It sounds to me like you need to work on a sensitivity problem.|`|AA10872465	Those would be considered minor grievances by a court.<br>  but if your former supervisor is giving out false or malicious <br>  references about you, you could sue for that.<br>  but most states require you to go to labor mediation and get a "right to sue" letter from the state first.|`|Afo6Raliaa	You probably don't have a cause of action for a lawsuit, but if you really want to look into the possibilities, you should talk to a lawyer.  Many employment lawyers do free or relatively cheap consultations.  For this type of lawsuit you will need lots of proof of discrimination, singling out, etc.  Plus you will need to show that you've been substantially damaged by the employer's actions.|`|VZFHoNmOaa	Anyone can sue for anything but you should let this go. You have way too many better things to do in your life than spend it in litigation on a case that you probably will not prevail in.|`|Wf5k8ZTnaa	You need to know that there is a time limit where you can file complaints. if it is the ADA, it is 300 days. This is usually about what most federal protection laws work. The government program that regulate are for the most part understaffed and choosy about which claim they pursue.<br>  <br>  You can sue your former employer for giving out negative information. They are only supposed to give your job title, dates of employment and pay. <br>  <br>  It is very difficult to make a case. I used to hire and when I checked references, often the way people gave legal information said a lot. Plus in they did tell me negative information, I did not pass it on.<br>  <br>  The best bet I would say is to find people who will say good things about you and use them as references. Usually people agree but I have had there agreeable references include negative info. Ask for letters of reference. If anyone wont put good things about you in writing, they may not be reliable in talking about you.<br>  <br>  You need to put a positive spin on why you left the job. You could say " I had many family issues and needed to leave so I could take care of them. Now they are resolved and I am eager to resume my employment."<br>  <br>  The best revenge is success.
erH2EP4caa	McCain<br>  <br>  I don't agree with him on all issues, but he is the best choice in this election.  I did not vote for Bush, and I do not believe he is another Bush.  It takes very careful analysis to figure out (if it is at all possible) who is to blame for our current state of affairs.  We have Bush as president with a democratic Congress (of which Obama is a member) and many people choose to lay all the blame at Bush's feet.  That's ridiculous.  Even I, who didn't vote for him, am not that short-minded.<br>  <br>  I believe that Obama will hurt our economy, but more importantly, I believe he will damage our democracy.  He is extremely eloquent.  He is dangerously eloquent.  People are not paying attention to what he is really saying.  He is socialistic.<br>  <br>  He keeps making excuses for his past associations, but I don't buy it.  I know that I could never have sat in a church and listened to someone like Rev Wright for 20 years without getting up and taking other true Americans with me.  I think it's really sad that the first viable black candidate has this kind of background and will never have credibility and respect from a great number of people, of every color, because of it.<br>  <br>  I am voting for McCain because I have figured out that I am much more "American" than I am Democrat or Republican.|`|73kknl3Qaa	Obama|`|1270a2c558de1c5ce444bf6f3447f4beaa	Why shouldn't an Obama supporter explain why?<br>  <br>  <br>  EDIT:  Amen to Rotorhead's comments, I couldn't possibly say it better myself|`|mFa5ZDtcaa	Simple.

It usually corresponds with the rank that you are, but in some cases your pay grade and rank may not match (usually only in the case of retirement or in the rare case that an E-7 or above becomes a warrant officer and the W-1 pay is less than the E-7 pay so they get payed at the E-7 rate). Normally an E-1 is a private, E-2 is a PV2 (also a private but with more time in service) E-3 is a Private first class, E-4 is a Specialist or a corporal (a corporal is a non-commissioned officer but payed at the E-4 level) E-5 is a Sergeant, and so on...<br>      I am going to attach a web sight below that has a military pay chart. It shoes the E pay, O pay, WO pay and OE pay. E of course is enlisted, O is officer, WO is Warrant officer, OE is officer with at least 4 years of enlisted time prior to becoming an officer. The pay chart is base pay only, and does not include things like flight pay, jump pay, BAH, BAS etc. In all if you had an E-5 with no special pay, and an E-2 with a few different specialty pays, the E-2 could possibly make more money than the E-5.<br>  |`|68ecd527cdfb0f4257f38ac027faac28aa	its your pay grade. the E stands for enlisted, the higher the number after the letter the higher you rank and/or paygrade. how much each paygrade makes depends on how long youve been in. |`|9NLe96auaa	try the occupational outlook handbook at www.bls.gov|`|dNjjwBDbaa	Try the site below.

One of the main arguments against Obama is what has he accomplished? Well McCain lost that argument when he made Palin his VP.  <br>  <br>  Obama has the luxury of voting "present" and Palin has the luxury of a GOP State Congress.  Just as Obama is very liberal, Palin also did not "Stand up against her party," she defeated a Republican in a primary and won the seat, but in that argument we could make the point that Obama stood up against his party when he defeated Clinton in the primaries.  |`|zkhXlXI8aa	A Gov. is an EXECUTIVE.<br>  <br>  They MUST make decisions, they impact lives every single day.<br>  <br>  Senators have the luxury of PROPOSING ideas....  sitting around and "debating" in infinitum and never be held accountable for what they do (or don't do).<br>  <br>  <br>

I believe it is the greatest nation in history.  My reason is not some silly sentimentality, it is based on the fact that our nation was created by men who were determined to give us the maximum amount of freedom.<br>  <br>  Never confuse our criminal politicians with our nation, or even our government.  Our government is run by our Constitution.  When our politicians ignore the Constitution, for example, waging war without a Declaration of War by the Congress, it is not our nation, it is not even our government, it is criminal politicians who are in violation of the law.  They have all sworn an oath to support and defend the Constitution.  When they break that oath, they are no longer acting as agents of government, but as criminals.<br>  <br>  It is vital that the American people understand this difference.  If you are playing cards, and your opponent suddenly hits you over the head with a bottle, would you say that playing cards is a dangerous game?  Of course not.  Hitting you over the head with a bottle is NOT in the rules of the card game.  Actions and legislation that violates the Constitution are also outside the rules of our government (the Constitution), and should be viewed as the actions of those who commit them, not of our government.|`|tI53w21saa	The history of the WORLD is that of conquest, genocide, migration, and assimilation of the conquered peoples.

America is not meant so be socialistic, fascistic or anything else than defined by the constitution. If you don't like it that way, I see no reason for you to stay, as you could just as well move to Europe - there you can have it all, no effort required; they've already un-free'd themselves (not to say you're that way; judging by your applauding the constitution, I guess you're a constitution supporter).|`|447d32e3763216a21069502e28a81b7eaa	People say that as a means of saying, "The vast majority of people here are generally happy with how things are.

To have a better life and live without fear. Personally if I could. I would leave the US and move to Canada, but that's not an option because I don't have the money to do so. But yes, if you hate it here so much you should leave because you apparently don't deserve the freedom our forefathers fought so hard for. And technically if you think about it. Everyone was an immigrant at some point because europeans came over and discovers this land TOOK it from the indians and kept it for their own to prosper off the land. So technically your family is not even from here. You were just born here, and your family immigrated years and years ago.

However it, in itself, is not a right.<br>  <br>  No one has the right to marry whomever he wants. Gays can already get marriage licenses on exactly the same terms as anyone else. Everyone is equally barred from marrying another person who is under a certain age, or too closely related, or of the same gender, or already married to another. Sound reasons underlie all these requirements, which apply equally to everyone, male and female. Gays can already get marriage licenses on exactly the same terms as anyone else. Homosexuals are seeking a special right. They already have the same right to marry the rest of us have-the right to marry a person of the opposite sex. Limiting marriage to one man and one woman doesn't discriminate on the basis of sex or sexual orientation. Gays already have the liberty to live their lives as they choose, set up housekeeping, share income and expenses, make contracts and wills, and transfer property. What they are now demanding is respect and social standing for a lifestyle that others believe is immoral (like mixed-gender cohabiting).<br>  <br>  Proposition 8 is about preserving marriage; it’s not an attack on the gay lifestyle. Proposition 8 doesn’t take away any rights or benefits of gay or lesbian domestic partnerships. Under California law, “domestic partners shall have the same rights, protections, and benefits” as married spouses. (Family Code § 297.5.) There are NO exceptions. Proposition 8 WILL NOT change this.<br>  <br>  The narrow decision of the California Supreme Court isn’t just about “live and let live.” State law may require teachers to instruct children as young as kindergarteners about marriage. (Education Code § 51890.) If the gay marriage ruling is not overturned, TEACHERS COULD BE REQUIRED to teach young children there is no difference between gay marriage and traditional marriage.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.protectmarriage.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.protectmarriage.com/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.thelandofthefree.net/youdonthavearighttomarry.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.thelandofthefree.net/youdonth...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.bellaonline.com/articles/art29110.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.bellaonline.com/articles/art2...</a><br>  <br>  Edit: It bugs me when people like the user above me gets it all wrong. You said if u change the word only whites can marry and blacks cannot. That is simply not true. Black/Gays CAN marry, just not gays!<br>  <br>  Like I said nobody can marry whomever they want! There are restrictions on marriage as it is NOT a right. They always had the right to marry!!!|`|AA11179275	Vote no on prop 8. Don't spread hatred. Think about it change the word gay to black. Eliminates right of black couples to marry. Only white marriages will be recognized. That's not ok. SO why can we change just one word? All families are important. It is not whether or not you agree with it because it is not our place to discriminate under the law for religious purposes. Gay marriage has been ok for months and i must have missed the whole that god ripped in the universe. Did you see it?

Obama has never lead anothing in terms of governmental policy. As far as his experience goes, he has been in the Senate for 22 months and has been running is presidential campaign for 21 months. This is not an exaggeration.<br>  He is an intelligent man. I will give you that. After all, this campaign will either give him the White House or millions in book and movie sales or both. He can lose the election and still come out the winner. <br>  It's sad that his supporters can't see the game he is playing. He won a spot in the Senate and has been cashing in every since. And he is preaching reform... Excuse me, CHANGE. Reform is actually a goal. Change is simply a hollow promise. <br>  <br>  Yes, I will vote for McCain. McCain at least has experience on his side. While there is the rhetoric that McCain voted with Bush 90% of the time, anyone who knows anything about politics will realize that there is much more to a vote than simply yes or no. By the time a bill reaches a vote there is so much crap attached to it that you could truly believe in the intent of the bill but choose to vote no because of the pork attached. <br>  Laying that aside, McCain has proven his loyalty to this Country. He has bled for us. He knows sacrifice. And as far as I am concerned, he picked the right running mate. Palin may be pushy and a little hard core, but do we really want a puchover in the Whitehouse? She may not know everything about the Bush Doctrine, but I trust her when it comes to the economy.<br>  Obama is in it for himself. Unless of course he plans on donating the procedes of his book deals and mechandising to the national debt.

Others who made it to the place where the where to be sold were starved, beaten, raped, killed, forced to abandon their names and religon, and thats before being force to work for free and bare children for breeding. All of these acts were done by people who share the same views as some poeple today who if it weren't illegal to do so would probably act in the same way.<br>  <br>  Welfare was made during the great depression for all those americans who were hard on their luck, black people were already going though that so welfare was not made for blacks.<br>  <br>  The rest of those people who believe that things ok, they aren't but it's gettin better, and there is no need for payback it's already here.|`|BwGOjB1Raa	I think Africans descendents deserve reperations for what happened.  America probably wouldn't be as powerful as it is if it had not been for African enslavement.  Africans sold Africans to Whites because they didn't want whites to kill and enslave them and their families.  READ MORE THAN JUST U.S HISTORY!  As far as Africans enslaving themselves, well, whites should have enslaved themselves.|`|6L1YwoWdaa	some years ago? you mean 150? How about the Africans still using slavery? We also happily fought a war to free them. We happily created a civil rights act. You should happily burn in hell.<br>  <br>  EVEN WITH YOUR ADDITIONAL COMMENTS YOU GOT TAKEN TO SCHOOL ON THIS ONE. STOP MAKING YOURSELF LOOK LIKE AN IGNORANT FOOL. GO BACK TO CLASS AND THIS TIME PAY ATTENTION. THE REST OF THE WORLD ARE AS BAD OR WORSE THAN WE EVER WERE.<br>  <br>  WOLFIE IS ALSO IGNORANT AND DEAD WRONG. YOU HAVE TO MAKE THAT CRAP UP BECAUSE IT JUST IS NOT TRUE.

YOU ARE A LIAR.|`|2e405d18fda0a031cdc970b9510cd13caa	Let's see, where did these "kidnapped americans" come from?  Oh yeah, that's right, the warring tribes in africa SOLD their captives to Dutch slave traders.  So, I guess the "kidnapping" was done by africans.  Do I think they'll get paid back?  Doubt it.  Don't see any reason to refund money on a bunch of people that aren't working any longer.  I mean, really, if the product is defective, the seller is supposed to give US a refund.  So really, the African tribes ought to pay the Dutch, who in turn should refund the money wasted on a non-functioning commodity.<br>  <br>  Now, if you mean do I think that the blacks here in this country will act stupid and try to riot and create chaos if Osamabama does or does not get elected, here's something to think about.<br>  <br>  Do you HONESTLY think the blacks are the only ones pissed about the way the whole slavery thing turned out?  I mean, is there any reason to believe that there might be some other faction in this country that may be a little upset about the outcome of the Civil War?  Maybe the side that now has a preponderance of the guns and ammunition in this country?  The group that now has a greater number of NRA members than elsewhere?  You mean like THOSE people (I guess I should say "us")?  Well, if you are talking about them, then, yeah, I'd say that payback may be a true bi-otch.  When people get all "riled up" and decide to riot, commit crimes, or run in the street like animals. then yes, it is entirely possible that that group of people will make it very unpleasant for the "kidnapped americans" who choose to attack us.<br>  <br>  Let's just hope that the "kidnapped americans" have the common sense not to press the issue with this group of people.  Knowing, of course, that common sense has never been their long suit...|`|mACkoDAuaa	Some who are descendants of those kidnapped Africans could have ended up as a side dish on Idi Amin's lunch tray or have bloated bellies due to hunger brought about by corrupt African leaders.<br>  Descendants of kidnapped Africans ought to be thankful they are here!|`|ZBMUal8Taa	Are you kidding me?<br>  Seriously...  that's just sick.<br>  (And for the record, Obama is just as much "white" as he is "black," so I don't see how this is any amount of "payback.")<br>  Embarrassing...|`|tqnxAar7aa	Africans enslaved Europeans long before we did.

They were purchased. From their own people. If you're looking for payback, you're looking at the wrong nation.|`|n5dEIBU3aa	LOL!

Funny how all of you seem to forget that the blacks were selling the blacks to the whites!  Besides how many more years need to go by before we can put the slave thing to rest?  Don't ya think it's way past time for you all to get over it?  I mean nobody in your generation was a slave and probably not your parents either!  It's part of the past and needs to stay in the past!|`|QqxrVVnlaa	I find it interesting that a lot of people on here simply do not understand what happened during the slavery period. Initially slaves were just snatched from African villages. This became more diificult as resistance started and more people began to die...slavers, but mainly prospective slaves. <br>  <br>  This was very costly and a different method had to be devised. The new system entailed approaching chiefs and telling them that if they organised the slavery themselves they would be paid, if they refused there villages would be destroyed and the people killed. This is called being between a rock and a hard place.<br>  <br>  To blame other Africans for slavery is ridiculous. Pick up a history book. Read!!!|`|AA10628838	I think all the welfare should make us even.<br>  <br>  It is a well known fact that Africans. and their government supress causing them to live in poverty, kill and maim their own people.|`|qxteTM9Kaa	Americans must repay the Native People first,and return the stolen land.|`|DSSio06daa	Between welfare and affirmative action, throw in a little reverse discrimination and let's not forget that they were sold by black africans in the first place...end users,my friend, are not the ones the injured party should have a problem with.<br>  I for one am sick and tired of it all.  All other minorities and injured parties have gotten over it, it's time for the blacks that are bitching to get that big fat chip off their shoulders and take some personal responsibility.  <br>  |`|dQcPV4Rqaa	And just which people are you referring too...The Africans we used probably had a better life being slaves and they would have in Africa getting eaten by lions !!  Or they would have probably starved to death... Most of the slaves we have were sold by warring tribes in Africa to the slave traders anyway, so I guess they should be mad at their own people, shouldn't they ???<br>  <br>  And since slavery ended they have had quite a vacation for generations...Not working, stealing, having one fatherless child after another, being supported by tax dollars of hard working people.. joining gangs,taking and selling drugs...by the way, they could always go back....If it is so miserable here then pack up and get back to where you came from !!<br>  <br>  I also believe that probably most of the people who brought them here and used them are DEAD !!  So who are they going to pay back??? Just get off your butts, go to school, get an education, then get a JOB..<br>  You have the same opportunity that everyone else does..stop crying and do something constructive....We have been the slaves of the decendents of the slaves for a long time now..I think we should be looking for the payback !!|`|dHjya1Yoaa	You do realize that Black people owned Black slaves as well... oh and there were also White slaves.. but they weren't called slaves, they were called indentured servants... and I am pretty sure that it was tribal leaders that sold off their POW's into slavery... :/ So honestly no one should be getting "paybacks"... <br>  <br>  and like someone else said... it happened over 200 years ago... who from that time is still living? We are living in the US not South Africa...|`|Ebecdbt1aa	"some years ago"....you mean like 200 years ago...?<br>  <br>  NO.....there is no payback..we're all Americans, we're all patriotic and love this country.....<br>  It's time to put race issues and anger behind us...once and for all.<br>  <br>  are you trying to incite fear again ?|`|G96GCH9Uaa	I didn't have a darn thing to do with that.

He's hilarious!!!!|`|2mcDKo4Naa	I agree with the other answerers.  He is a comedian.  I think that he acts like an extremely conservative republican because it's not only ridiculous, but funny as well.  <br>  <br>  Just watch him--when he's being especially "republican" in his comments, he is often trying to stifle a smile/laugh.<br>  |`|L5pJSaktaa	No No No.  Colbert is an extreme liberal.  That is the gag of his show.  He is "in character" as a conservative pundit.  In reality he exaggerates and makes fun of everything that is wrong with the republican party.  He is as liberal as Jon Stewart.

And in a good way!<br>  That being said, I also think people are putting too much pressure on him.  No one short of God himself (if there is one) would be able to pull off everything people want Obama to.  They're calling him the new FDR who passed something like 15 new acts of legislation in the first 100 days of his presidency.  There's no way Obama can do that considering that he has to work with Republicans, other countries, the public, etc.  <br>  I'm optimistic though!  I think he'll do this country and me proud!|`|ETj3xEPNaa	It's really hard to say...it could go either way. He has the potential to be either one of America's greatest presidents or one of its worst. <br>  <br>  In terms of certain issues like war and what not i dont know how much change will incur there. He plans on phasing out Iraq troops...but then he wants to go and put them in Afghanistan.<br>  <br>  He has great charisma, he's well educated, and hes a natural born leader...what it comes down to are his own personal intentions/morals...whichever way he goes (corporate interest/public interest) will decide what quality of change he'll bring.|`|03DlS4Vhaa	I am staying open minded and hoping for the best.

KLFpzHc5aa	I don't know about Colorado, but In FL and CA I went a few times to court for traffic tickets. Never needed a lawyer and never got any points. <br>  <br>  1- if the officer that issued the ticket doesn't show up at the court, the state has no witness. You plead not guilty and don't get a conviction, don't have to pay the ticket and don't get any points.  <br>  <br>  2- If the officer shows up:  The judge might offer you to make a "non-contest" plead. He will make you pay the fine and might not give you a conviction (no points).  In FL, this option always worked. Judges in California are tougher and the best I could get away was a "guilty, with an explanation" plead. Explained that the violation wasn't intentional and he just put me in probation for a year. As long as you don't repeat the violation during that following year, you don't pay that ticket or get the points. Again, I paid the fine, but wasn't convicted and didn't get any points. <br>  <br>  3- You can plead guilty and ask to go to traffic school, if you qualify.<br>  <br>  Fortunately, the last time I got a ticket was in 2001.  But if it happens, I will go to court again. It is my right, why not use it?|`|AA10604086	Yea, but maybe $ 500.00 for a lawyer with no guarantee.

You may not get it dismissed but he may be able to get the charge changed to a straight speeding at a reduced speed and a smaller fine which will result in fewer points.|`|KybzQNd0aa	I got a speeding ticket and all I did was call the court and ask to talk to the da and they reduced it right there on the phone... If I accepted great.. if not then of course you can higher a lawyer.

m5WpvVRhaa	No, the company that you are working for will not know that you filed for unemployment, for plenty of reasons. <br>  <br>  For starters, you have not worked for them long enough to collect from them, not to mention you did not make enough while working. <br>  <br>  You will simply pick up where you left off as if you never worked for them.|`|AA11481889	Yes they will know and it may jeopardize your future opportunities with them.  Why not just register with a temp agency and actually work some more temp jobs rather than just get back on unemployment? |`|9cpKYneZaa	Don't know if you would qualify. I thought you had to work at a place for at least 6 months before you could qualify for unemployment. Of course it may be different in PA. |`|AA11109157	They will know, because Unimployment Insurance contacts them to make sure you were not fired "for cause." A for cause firing would make you in eligible for unemployment benefits. They may or may not have to pay more. Depends on the number of employees and how many have collected. Each state assigns a risk level to an employer, that risk goes up the more people who collect. Its unemployment insuance and it works just like car insurance. The more accidents you are in the more likely yor insurance will go up. |`|O06Ms8RQaa	unemployment is set up through taxes every employer pays them no matter if you were employed by them or not

rBd9dINaaa	The problem is that LDV is owned by Russia.  If HMG chucks in ￡30mill as required, how much of that money will actually be used within Britain for the benefit of the UK employees?  We have no guarantees that it would, and Russia has cashflow issues of its own, after all.<br>  <br>  If I was the government and this Russian company said it couldn't afford to keep its factory running, then I would expect to buy that company for the ￡30mill.<br>  <br>  Russia would be free of its "lame duck" and Britain would have something to build a car industry upon once again.  Ironic, considering that it was the communist infiltration of our unions in the 1970s that caused the demise of British Leyland in the first place and the Russians who then bought what was Leyland-DAF and turned it into LDV.<br>  <br>  Other than transfer of ownership I think HMG is right not to provide the money that the Russians are trying to use workers' futures to blackmail out of the UK.  GM tried this ploy in Sweden with Saab and got nowhere too.<br>  <br>  Too many individuals outside our borders see Britain as a soft source of cash.

Ot7PJrddaa	They will tell you if your family lets the Red Cross know - my Dad died on my first tour and my Mom on my third and I was notified of both via the Red Cross.|`|AA11163314	There is a process for doing this.  A member of your family will have to start the process by calling the Red Cross.  The Red Cross maintains an office in the Pentagon and as soon as they verify the emergency this office sends a 'Red Cross Message' into the military communications system.<br>  <br>  The message is passed as a priority message until it reaches either the soldier's Company Commander or First Sergeant.  Then the soldier has to be notified and the time of notification logged and reported back up through the communication channels back to that office in the Pentagon.  If the Red Cross officials in the Pentagon feel that the time to notify was excessive then the Commander/First Sergeant will have to provide an explanation of why notification was delayed.<br>  <br>  During my time as a First Sergeant I made it a point that an Red Cross Message was passed on to the soldier only by myself or the Commander whenever possible.  I also regarded making this notification as my only mission until completed.<br>  <br>  In addition I would instruct my headquarters personnel to prepare leave papers and start arraigning for priority transportation to get the soldier back home.<br>  <br>  The standard we were supposed to meet was less than 48 hours from the Red Cross verifying the emergency to the soldier arriving at his/her home (from Iraq/Afghanistan).  From a stateside assignment the standard was 24 hours or less.|`|f08acadf20db255caa972f1c2ebf2c7eaa	You will be informed immediately.

Where the hell did you get that?  <br>  You are notified via the Red Cross and the Chain of Command-assuming you aren't in the field you have priority on flights home. It's called Emergency Leave.  If you are on an op, then efforts will be made to try to get you back so you can leave-but that can take a while.|`|MnbMpzaoaa	Unless you are on a deep cover special ops mission, they tell you.  They grant you leave to attend the funeral.  All of this is done through the Red Cross as a humanitarian gesture (go figure).

It will never happen, but great idea.  If you have a CDL, gotta pass a drug test.  If you work in health care, gotta pass a drug test.  If you work in the oil fields, gotta pass a drug test.

P0gIKAVJaa	As someone with a foreign citizenship, the process to obtaining Irish citizenship is generally similar to that of many other countries.<br>  <br>  ie.<br>  <br>  Automatic if you have a parent holding an Irish passport at your time of birth - which will require proof and possible registration before a certain age.<br>  <br>  Otherwise: citizenship will be granted only after a period of residence where good character will be demonstrated.<br>  <br>  Permisssion to take up residency will usually be granted to those claiming a right to abode via ancestry connections (grandparent), marriage or through some skilled migrant channels.<br>  <br>  Both of the later options require some years of residence and further applications after the time requirement has been met.  Only then may citizenship be granted...|`|ZA11WBR2aa	if you're born there, you get it automatically.|`|a66nvk0taa	If you are the spouse of an Irish citizen who is applying for Irish citizenship you must meet the following conditions:<br>  You must be married to the Irish citizen for at least 3 years <br>  You must have had a period of 1 year's continuous "reckonable residence" in the island of Ireland immediately before the date of your application <br>  You must have been living on the island of Ireland for at least 2 of the 4 years before that year of continuous residence <br>  Your marriage must be recognised as valid under Irish law <br>  You and your spouse must be living together as husband and wife <br>  You must be of full age, good character and intend to continue to live on the island of Ireland <br>  You must have made a declaration of fidelity to the nation and loyalty to the State<br>  <br>  Certain periods of residence do not count for the purpose of reckonable residence, for example, periods when you did not have permission to remain in Ireland, or you were here on a student visa, or you were seeking asylum.<br>  <br>  The application process is the same as for becoming a citizen through naturalisation. There are, however, more favourable residence requirements than those for foreign nationals who are not married to Irish citizens. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has discretion to grant or refuse your application. <br>  <br>  If you have previously been married and divorced<br>  You can only claim citizenship by marriage if your current marriage is a valid marriage under Irish law.<br>  <br>  You are not free to enter a second marriage unless, at the time of your second marriage, your previous marriage had been terminated by:<br>  <br>  The death of your first husband or wife <br>  A divorce that would be recognised under Irish law. <br>  A divorce granted by an Irish court will be recognised as having terminated your previous marriage. If your freedom to enter your current marriage was based on an earlier marriage terminated by a divorce, and that divorce was not obtained in Ireland, you will need to find out whether that divorce is one that would be recognised under Irish law.<br>  <br>  You will be required to present documentation showing the validity of your current marriage, which would include documentation showing the validity of any previous divorce.<br>  <br>  Citizenship through descent from Irish grandparents<br>  If one of your grandparents is an Irish citizen but none of your parents was born in Ireland, you may become an Irish citizen. You will need to have your birth registered in the Foreign Births Register.<br>  <br>  If you are entitled to register, your Irish citizenship is effective from the date of registration. The Irish citizenship of successive generations may be maintained in this way by each generation ensuring their registration in the Foreign Births Register before the birth of the next generation. <br>  <br>  Since 1 July 1986, a person registered in the Foreign Births Entry Book after 1986 is deemed to be an Irish citizen only from the date of his/her entry in the Register and not from the date of birth. This means that children born to that person before his/her date of entry in the Register are not entitled to citizenship. <br>  <br>  People registered before July 1986 are deemed Irish citizens either from the date the original Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act came into force, that is, 17 July 1956, or their date of birth, whichever is later. Only children born after 17 July 1956 can claim citizenship in such cases<br>  <br>  The following table may help to explain the situation: <br>    If you are: Then you are: <br>  A Born in the island of Ireland on or before 31 December 2004 Entitled to Irish citizenship or you are an Irish citizen <br>  B Born on the island of Ireland on or after 1 January 2005 Entitled to Irish citizenship if your parents are Irish. Entitled to Irish citizenship, if your parents are foreign nationals legally resident in the island of Ireland for 3 out of 4 years immediately prior to your birth. <br>  C Child of A, born outside the island of Ireland An Irish citizen <br>  D Child of C and a grandchild of A, born outside the island of Ireland Entitled to Irish citizenship, but you must first register in the Foreign Births Register <br>  E a child of D and a great-grandchild of A, born outside the island of Ireland  Entitled to Irish citizenship, by having your birth registered in the Foreign Births Register, but only if your parent D had registered by the time of your birth.|`|edde127b1150f72ea601ce2bc4a9a90baa	Call the Counsel General of Ireland's office.

So they car rewrite all they want buy people like me always can tell. Anyone can rip these people off cause they are attracted to cons.
