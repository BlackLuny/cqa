XzoqNnOBaa	This would depend on how your tea was processed.  Black tea is the heaviest, green less so, and white even less so.  Black is roughly 3-4 grams per tsp, green roughly 2-3 grams, and white may be as little as 1-2 grams - depending on how fluffy the leaves are.<br>  <br>  Respectively per ounce, there are 8 cups for black, 12 green, and 18 for white.  You might want to think of this in terms of doses of caffeine!  Black is the highest, green less so, white even less so.  This way I use less tea for black, more for green, much more for white - to adjust for caffeine doses - but that is just me!<br>  <br>  There are other teas that contain caffeine like Yerba Mate that can be drank in very large quantities for a cheap price.

e6jrBORRaa	When I was a kid, my mother used to make us pork brains pretty regularly.  I loved them until I got older and understood exactly what I was eating. She loves to tease me about this now that I have an aversion to the idea, but she'll still eat her pork brains.  You have to understand:  She's an old country gal.  When she was growing up, they didn't let a thing go to waste.  She loves pickled pigs feet, too. <br>  <br>  Bleah.<br>  <br>  On the good side, I had "Bubble Tea" before at a place in Atlanta (Little Five Points) at a restaurant called "TeaSpace".  It's basically tea with tapioca beads floating in it.  They give you this huge straw so that you suck up the beads when you drink the tea.  It was fun!!  *Much better than the brains.*  LOL!!<br>  <br>  More about bubble tea:  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_tea" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_tea</a>|`|ILpp3ncYaa	Pig ear sandwich.|`|c9adce326b761303adb12127ff5dabd0aa	Matter of opinion here.

53giV6PFaa	Did you buy it at an American grocery store?  If yes, then you can go ahead and try it.  It's not bad, but to really enjoy a good kimchee you need to get it from a Korean restaurant or Korean market.  <br>  <br>  I love it and eat it all the time.  There are over 200 kinds of kimchee.  I really like the radish and cucumber ones the best.<br>  <br>  Don't eat it by itself.  It is strong in flavor and heat.  It's meant to be a side dish to rice and Korean meals like bulgogi.  I also like to eat it with ramen noodles.  I disagree with the first poster, Kimchee can be really spicy depending on who makes it and how much red pepper they add, so don't go into it thinking it's really mild.  <br>  <br>  I am Korean and love it.  My American husband thinks it the best thing about a Korean meal.<br>  <br>  To store it after you open it - make sure the lid is on really tight and I put the jar in a large zip loc bag.  It has a strong odor and can get throughout your fridge.

fgISdJsWaa	If its raw then they will obv eat it but i don't think it would be to nice lol<br>  but if its cooked then no because it is no longer raw. Some raw fooders only eat like raw veg and still eat cooked rice and bread, so your better of asking the specific person. If that makes sense lol|`|Vgz45FwCaa	they eat all things raw. traditional "bread" is baked which would make in not raw therefore not eaten. you can find recipes online for "crackers" though they are not cooked but dried. i dont think i'd want to eat raw rice,  i'd imagine it would expand once in your body and make you feel bloated.

(We do this step a little differently at the restaurant, due to our equipment, but if I shared that information, I would be fired.) Mix well. Take Ribs, use a shaker and your favorite dry seasoning (we have our seasoning for sale online at www.TexasRoadhouse.com ~~lt><a href="http://www.TexasRoadhouse.com>" rel="nofollow">http://www.TexasRoadhouse.com></a> ) and thoroughly coat each of the Ribs. Place Ribs in the pan.<br>  <br>  STEP TWO: Cooking<br>  <br>  Place pans in 300 F oven and bake slowly until done. Ribs are fully cooked when the bone in the center pulls freely from the meat. At this point, remove from the oven. <br>  <br>  STEP THREE: Grilling<br>  <br>  Pick your favorite BBQ sauce for re-heating and basting the Ribs. Pre-heat grill. Brush and season the grill before use. Place the Rack of Ribs vertically, with the underside down to the grates. Heat until sizzling hot. Turn Ribs over and baste the underside of the Ribs, and heat until sizzling hot. Baste the top. Turn the Ribs over one last time and baste with a final coat.    i hope i helped|`|8740c9d03300d2d76f91ceaf7a9ffc93aa	3-6 hours!|`|8lYZROjuaa	I don't know how thick they are or how much they weigh, but season them the way you like (maybe a dry rub) and place in large baking pan.

If you want to add sauce, uncover, slather your favorite stuff on them, turn the oven up to 450 to help carmelize the sauce into the meat, and cook an extra 20-30 minutes, depending on how you like them.  <br>  If you want your ribs 'fall off the bone tender,' cook them a little longer while covered. <br>  It's gonna be good.|`|AA11180444	<a href="http://allrecipes.com/Recipe/Honey-Barbecued-Spare-Ribs/Detail.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://allrecipes.com/Recipe/Honey-Barbe...</a>|`|hg8ExtsNaa	Just until the pig stops squeeling

Gradually beat in powdered sugar and then gradually add strawberries and beat until light, fluffy and stiff peaks form. Should frost 2 8 or 9" layers. Refrigerate cake after frosting. Make sure cake is completely cooled before icing.<br>  <br>  <br>  I don't know if this qualifies as an icing lol but we use it as such - mostly on pound cake or angelfood:<br>  <br>  We use our electric mixer for this.<br>  1 envelope unflavored gelatine<br>  1 large (16 oz) Kool Whip<br>  1 8 oz frozen/sweetened strawberries -well drained - or 2 cups fresh sliced strawberries that have been sugared with 1/2 cup powd sugar and let stand for 1 hr or overnite in fridge and then drain them.  Too much liquid make frosting too runny.<br>  <br>  Sprinkle gelatine over kool whip and beat for 1 min on high with wire whip.  <br>  <br>  Add drained strawberries and frost immediately.  Set in fridge for 1/2 hr to 45 min to let the gelatine get firmer.  It will stay firm enough to continue eating for 2-3 days if kept refrigerated.<br>  <br>  In the summertime when the strawberries are 'on' we then slice more sweetened strawberries over the cake for Strawberry shortcake!!  <br>  <br>  Hope this helps you.

DTog0VZWaa	The whys I don't know.  I have to assume the chemicals in non-organic growing, or the process allowing them to grow faster & develop less fully?<br>  <br>  I know I've been eating organic for years.  Recently I bought some non-org fruit when i couldnt' find the organic version & it just had no flavor, wasn't as good at all.  I decided not to buy if I can't get organic on this (it was dark grapes, blackberries & blueberries.)<br>  <br>  On two ocassions I've had a blind taste test turn up positive.  I went to my folks kitchen to get an apple (1x), orange (the other).  Came back to my mom & complained they didn't taste very good, "chemically".  In both cases later my mom when in the kitchen & pointed out where she'd put the organic fruit she'd bought for me ---I'd pulled the regular stuff for the rest of the family.  I'd been complaining (due to health issues) that I felt better with organic & knew someone else who also did much better...but this was the first blind test where I correctly identified the difference, by accident, two diff times.<br>  <br>  How watermelon is a different story.  I love it & used to buy & eat a 1/4 at a time every few days through the summer.  Once I switched to organic, I just don't like or crave it as much.  It tastes different.  Apparently there's chemicals in the original I really like.<br>  <br>  PS Often organic is transported not as far & picked later.  Many organic stores try for local produce.  That may be all it is.|`|b73296a75da0c37af734e3ef9c03113baa	You are so right! <br>  So many foods that are available now are genetically engineered, not for flavor but for longer shelf life. So, for example, Monsanto (chief culprit)  has spliced fish genes into tomatoes etc. That definitely alters the flavor of the food. They are genetically modifying flavor out. Organic produce is not genetically modified. It is what food used to taste like! Imagine that! Also, if you are a person who drinks milk in the United States and you travel to Europe you are in for a shock! European Milk and butter tastes entirely different! It is richer, fresher and more flavorful. <br>  When it comes to apples -- there you have a huge gamut of flavor from the very bland and flavorless-ness of a red delicious apple to the intensely sweet/tart of the Macintosh.   <br>  Take a look at Andrew Kimbrell's book Your Right to Know. It is really important.|`|yAvTxh47aa	With fruit it's usually because they lack vegetable wax and are riper, having not been artificially ripened.|`|zJi5Cjpiaa	maybe b/c the fertilizer is different|`|IJh7nuW3aa	Its because fertilizers are not used on organic foods and therefore you get the natural taste from them - In non- organic products the fertilizers takes away more than it should and so the sweetness of an apple for example is not the same.

What you should do is have a breakfast cereal (like special K or cheerios) and If you don't have time then wake up earlier. If school is at seven and you wake up at 6 30 than start waking up at 6 15.

But get a good coffee first, as a cheap coffee will always taste horribe even if you do make it righ!|`|cPMHKz4Oaa	Use a 1/4 measure cup  of coffee and 31/2 cup of water in a drip coffee pot|`|skgN9TJLaa	Easy mum put kettle on she makes it better then me.|`|v4xIauuYaa	i put a good heap of coffee in mix up the milk and sugar and just add water lol|`|F77AfkUIaa	I make coffee at my office every morning and people prefer that I'm the one to brew it because I apparently have a really good grasp on how to do it.<br>  <br>  Coffee will always taste better if you have whole beans and grind them right before you brew the coffee. Here's a guide to how many tablespoons of whole beans you should use compared to the cups of water for your coffee (based off the marks on your coffee pot): 4 cups of water to 3 tbsp beans, 6 c to 4.5 tbsp, 8 c to 6 tbsp, 10 c to 7.5 tbsp, and 12 c to 9 tbsp. <br>  <br>  If you don't have a choice and you're dealing with coffee grounds, or it's just plain cheaper (which it is), then the rough rule is 1 tbsp per 2 cups of water (so for 4 cups of coffee, use 2 tbsp ground coffee and 10 cups should get 5 tbsp). <br>  <br>  Also, the water you use should be as cold as you can get it, and if you can use purified water, all the better.<br>  <br>  I do agree that higher quality coffee will almost always produce better taste, but my dad is a Folger's drinker and he can still make good coffee with the cheap, ground coffee (I swear I'm not a coffee snob... ;) )<br>  <br>  I hope this helps!

I hope that sounds good to you too. You add the beef with the spice packet that comes with it (also a bonus) and let it sit there for hours and hours...... add cabbage the last 30 minutes, if you have the patience.... add carrots and onion and potatoes about an hour before you are ready to eat... otherwise, potatoes are still good to go at the beginning.|`|DBUmR8FTaa	It comes with a small recipe book.

DbK7oJMraa	According to the latest statistics many do, because their sales have dropped 40%+ and SB is closing a ton of stores.  I personally am not that into coffee and with tough times it was the first thing to go.  I think their prices are going to plummet along with their clientele & yes I think their coffee is Way over rated!|`|DoaMYpfMaa	i do i do i do and it doesn't even taste that good|`|REGTZ79xaa	I actually like some of Starbuck's blend and the way I can micro-manage the customization of my orders (2 seconds blend on mid setting), not quite fond of the atmosphere and own quite a few of its vacuum flasks - love the designs and they functions well.<br>  Price wise? The priciest one is (or was) the Sumatra blend at USD 5.00. I live in Indonesia (Sumatra is an island east of Indonesia) and a cup of Starbuck's Sumatra blend here is also USD 5.00 (same year, in local currency value) but if I buy local brands in supermarkets, a cup of thickly-brewed, full-flavored original Sumatra blend would only cost me around 50 cents.<br>  Yup.Overpriced. Over rated, maybe not so much.

SSDp4YpPaa	Contrary to want you might think, eating apples tend take a long while to cook down, whereas cookers cook down faster in my experience.  If you need the apples in more of a sauce-type consistency, it may not work properly with eaters. However, I am all for experimenting with new ideas so give it a try!|`|zzE3GXCzaa	I think sausage meat will be better.<br>  I joke. <br>  Of course you can but Granny smiths are sweeter and may go a bit squishy. It'll taste a bit different to the cooking apples but its not a big deal.<br>  Or maybe i'm joking again?<br>  <br>  Stick to the sausage meat!|`|jS5O0LaUaa	Yes as they are not as sweet as most dessert apples good luck|`|AA11786341	go for it,the other ingredients will make up the difference|`|P9kT15caaa	Yes they are sweeter than a cooking apple|`|1cd4b4483ad121c243e7ab5d39b4f29baa	Yes, They should add flavor.

You'll want something that fills you up.<br>  <br>  I'd recommend packing some hummus, with baby carrots for dipping.  Pack a few wedges of whole grain pita bread for dipping as well.  <br>  <br>  Other options:<br>  - Egg salad sandwich made with lite mayo, whole grain lite bread (has about half the calories of regular bread - it's got more air in it, more protein and more fiber)<br>  <br>  - Veggie chili or hearty soup with lots of beans in it.<br>  <br>  - Mix some canned chick peas (rinsed) with a little fresh lemon juice, garlic, onion, parsley and a small splash of olive oil.  Serve the bean mixture on top of a green salad with a sprinkle of feta cheese. The beans can be made ahead of time.  They will just get more flavorful marinading in the fridge.<br>  <br>  - Veggie wrap sandwich with a little prepackaged roasted tofu and light dressing<br>  <br>  - Llight cottage cheese and fruit<br>  <br>  - Near east lentil rice pilaf (from a box).

Seal the bag. <br>  <br>  Put milk, vanilla, and sugar into the small bag, and seal it. <br>  <br>  Place the small bag inside the large one, and seal it again carefully. <br>  <br>  Shake until the mixture is ice cream, which takes about 5 minutes. <br>  <br>  Wipe off the top of the small bag, then open it carefully. Enjoy! <br>  <br>  Tips:<br>  A 1/2 cup milk will make about 1 scoop of ice cream, so double the recipe if you want more. <br>  <br>  But don't increase the proportions more that that -- a large amount <br>  <br>  might be too big for kids to pick-up because the ice itself is heavy. <br>  <br>  <br>  Here's an improvised version of the homemade ice cream recipe from another parent: <br>  <br>  These are the homemade ice cream ingredients . . .  <br>  <br>  1/4 teaspoon imitation vanilla butter and nut flavor <br>  1 tablespoon sugar <br>  1/2 cup 1% milk <br>  <br>  These are the other supplies . . .  <br>  <br>  Plastic sandwich bag (e.g., Ziploc) <br>  12 water softener pellets <br>  1 tray of ice (My ice cube tray makes small cubes, so it produces only about half a tray.) <br>  Large plastic bag <br>  <br>  Put the ice-cream ingredients in the small bag, and then put the bag, salt, and ice in the big bag.<br>  <br>   Hold the bag shut and stir it around on the floor for about 5 minutes. <br>  <br>  Although the salt pellets hardly dissolved, I got ice cream.<br>  <br>   It was not as smooth as ice cream, probably because of the low-fat milk.<br>   Instead, it was a little like sherbet. I think if I had more ice in the bag, I could have shaken it better.<br>  <br>   I'd recommend wearing gloves.<br>  <br>   It is incredible that it is ready in 5 minutes (not counting assembling the ingredients.) <br>  <br>  <br>  Next, I changed the recipe, using a tablespoon of cocoa, a tablespoon of sugar, and a cup of milk.<br>   I really wanted to use carob, but I didn't have any. It was a tad too chocolatey, but good! My daughter has milk allergies, so I suggested she try this with fruit juice.

ZhiYghZ1aa	its a personal choice. yes i realize that just because im vegan does not mean that whole world is going to agree with it or all convert to veganism. i wish more people would try veganism before they automatically condemn it to be some radical hippie choice. im vegan because in today's society meat is a luxury and unnecessary and many animals must pay and suffer for humans to enjoy animal products. at one time it might have been necessary for humans to rely on animals for nourishment but not anymore. the less violence and suffering the better in my opinion.|`|yOK32PM9aa	I have been vegetarian for 35 years, and vegan for over 25.

NxS5D5DSaa	If theyre coming out too greasy. that's because the oil isn't hot enough and it's soaking up excess oil.  The oil should be hot enough that when you drop your batter it immediately starts to bubble.

Luckily, over here in Ireland 99% of bar staff (including myself of course) know what they're at when it comes to the famous two-part pour, but across the pond it's a different story.

ubukt8WWaa	You can assume it is Italian basil pesto.  It is made with fresh basil leaves, olive oil, garlic, pine nuts or walnuts, sometimes parmesan cheese (or other hard italian cheese). <br>  <br>  You can buy it fresh, in containers.  It also comes in small unrefrigerated jars (not quite as good).<br>  <br>  Making your own is easy if you have a food processor, but you need a lot of fresh basil leaves.  Sometimes that can be more expensive than just buying premade pesto.<br>  <br>  Here's a basic recipe for pesto:<br>  Fresh Basil Pesto Recipe <br>  <br>  Ingredients<br>  2 cups fresh basil leaves, packed <br>  1/2 cup freshly grated Parmesan-Reggiano or Romano cheese <br>  1/2 cup extra virgin olive oil <br>  1/3 cup pine nuts or walnuts <br>  3 medium sized garlic cloves, minced <br>  Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste<br>  Special equipment needed: A food processor <br>  <br>  Method<br>  1 Combine the basil in with the pine nuts, pulse a few times in a food processor. (If you are using walnuts instead of pine nuts and they are not already chopped, pulse them a few times first, before adding the basil.) Add the garlic, pulse a few times more. <br>  <br>  2 Slowly add the olive oil in a constant stream while the food processor is on. Stop to scrape down the sides of the food processor with a rubber spatula. Add the grated cheese and pulse again until blended.

Mince it (with a knife or pulse in a food processor) and mix with same amount of parboiled long grain rice (directions to follow). For every three cups of rice and lamb mixture, add: 1 tablespoon each tomato paste, chopped fresh dill, chopped fresh mint, and grated onion; 1 teaspoon each dried oregano and minced garlic; pinch red pepper flakes. Thoroughly and carefully drain then rinse grape leaves packed in brine. Lay one leaf flat and put one to two tablespoons mixture on middle of leaf, with shiny side down and fold over ends. Roll into a cylinder and arrange in layers in a stock pot. Cover with low sodium chicken stock and weigh down with a plate. Bring to a boil, and simmer for 20 minutes. These go great with yogurt and mint sauce. I think they taste better cold, but that's a personal preference. <br>  <br>  To parboil to rice, bring equal parts rice and liquid (stock or water) to a boil.

0HfhltzZaa	You need the dough to stand in order for the yeast to do it's work to make a really nice pizza crust. You let it stand until it doubles in size  . Depending on the warmth and humidity in your kitchen, this can take anywhere from 45 minutes to and hour and a half. If you are using instant yeast, all you have to do is mix your ingredients (yeast, flour , water, etc) and let it sit for about 10-15 minutes and then roll out the dough. If you bake everything asap after mixing, you will end up with tough, extremely chewy, unappetizing pizza crust.|`|HAEIpcAraa	You need to let the dough stand until it rises completely and doubled in size.

So, on a biological level, man is really not supposed to be a vegetarian.<br>  <br>  Next, if man were supposed to be a vegetarian, how is it the nutrients one can acquire for one or two types of meat have to be replicated in many additional supplements? Again another biological level in which man is not really supposed to be vegetarian.<br>  <br>  And lastly, if man wasn't supposed to eat meat, why on earth does it taste so good?<br>  <br>  Meat does not gross me out as death is a part of the natural cycle of life. And the food chain is another part of that cycle. I have personally killed animals for my own consumption, and while I do admit that the first time was odd and somewhat macabre, it was a learning experience that gave me an appreciation for the animals in which we eat. If you contemplate the origin of food, you will realize that even the vegetables are gross, as they are fertilized with nutrients in the soil, and those had to get there though decaying material (IE poop and rot).

With spaghetti it might be starch reacting with the heat. It's not plastic.|`|RcwWcj3aaa	that is just a layer of starch. if you leave potatoes for a while you will find that the same things happen. but it is more obvious in spagghetti because of colour and texture.

If we have to much of a certain thing than our body may reject it and tell us not to indulge in it.  We all also have our own taste buds and learn from others or may of had a bad experience.  Once I got sick on pizza and would not go near it for over 10 years.  If you ever have food poisoning very bad I bet you will never want to see that item on your plate again.  Also our nose can be sensitive to an order and tell us whether we want it or not.|`|36a3ynpJaa	Taste varies dramatically from person to person.  Most chefs have twice the number of taste buds as regular people do.  Also certain tastes are sensed much more by some people than others and some people will taste certain chemicals that other people can't.<br>  <br>  Kids are usually much more sensitive to alkaloids which taste bitter to them.  This is because most poisonous plants are bitter as well.

7oDIgqg9aa	Khachapuri (Georgian Feast Bread)<br>  <br>  2 loaves <br>  <br>  Ingredients<br>  <br>  Dough<br>  <br>       1 cup milk, scalded*<br>       3 tablespoons unsalted butter<br>       1 1/2 teaspoons sugar<br>       1/2 teaspoon coriander powder<br>       1 1/2 teaspoons salt<br>       2 teaspoons instant yeast<br>       3 1/4 cups unbleached all-purpose flour <br>  <br>  Filling<br>  <br>       2 cups cheese (Monterey Jack, Sharp Cheddar or Muenster)<br>       1 cup ricotta cheese or cottage cheese or goat cheese<br>       2 large eggs<br>       2 tablespoons unbleached all-purpose flour<br>       1/2 teaspoon salt, if needed**<br>       1/2-1 teaspoon fresh ground pepper<br>       1 teaspoon paprika<br>  <br>  Directions<br>  <br>  1. Dough: Heat the butter and milk in a small saucepan, or in the microwave, till the butter has melted. Put the sugar, coriander and salt in a medium-sized bowl, and pour the hot milk over them, stirring to combine and to dissolve the malt or sugar. Set aside to cool to lukewarm.<br>  <br>  2. Add the instant yeast and flour to the milk mixture and stir to form a shaggy mass. Set this rough dough aside for 30 minutes.<br>  <br>  3. Knead the dough until it's smooth -- in a bread machine set on the dough cycle, about 2 minutes in a food processor, 6 to 8 minutes by electric stand mixer, or 8 to 10 minutes by hand. Put the dough in a greased bowl, turn it over to coat the entire surface, and cover the bowl. Let the dough rise for 1 to 1 1/2 hours, or until it increases in size by at least one-third.<br>  <br>  4. Filling: If you have a food processor, use it -- it's ideal for this filling. Cube the hard cheese, add the soft cheese, and process until well-mixed but some chunks remain. Add the eggs, flour and seasonings, and pulse just to mix thoroughly. Refrigerate until ready to use.<br>  <br>  5. If you don't have a food processor, grate the hard cheese, and beat in the soft cheese and eggs. Continue beating, adding the flour and seasonings. Refrigerate until ready to use.<br>  <br>  6. Shaping and Baking: After the dough has risen, turn it out onto a lightly floured surface. Divide the dough in half (you'll be making two loaves), and cut a small (1-ounce) piece of dough off of each half. Round all four pieces of dough into balls, and let them rest, covered, for 15 minutes.<br>  <br>  7. Roll each large ball into a 10- to 12-inch circle. Place one circle into a lightly greased small pie tin, 8- or 9-inch round cake pan, or onto a lightly greased or parchment-lined baking sheet. Dollop half of the cheese mixture into the middle of the circle, and pull the dough up around the cheese, folding and pinching it, and "pleating" it into a topknot. Leave a small hole in the very center of the knot, and place the small ball in this hole. Repeat with the remaining dough and filling. Cover the loaves and let them rise for 45 minutes or longer -- they'll look puffy, but not doubled in size. If the pleats have opened, pinch them shut.<br>  <br>  8. Bake the loaves in a preheated 375¬∞F oven for 15 minutes, then lower the temperature to 350¬∞F and bake for another 20 to 25 minutes. When finished, the loaves will be golden brown, and the middle should feel set. Tent the loaves with aluminum foil after 15 minutes if they seem to be browning too quickly. Remove the loaves from the oven, and allow them to cool for at least 15 minutes before slicing.

In medium bowl, mix flour and salt. Cut in shortening, using pastry blender (or pulling 2 table knives through ingredients in opposite directions), until particles are size of small peas. Sprinkle with cold water, 1 tablespoon at a time, tossing with fork until all flour is moistened and pastry almost cleans side of bowl (1 to 2 teaspoons more water can be added if necessary). <br>  <br>  2. Gather pastry into a ball. Shape into flattened round on lightly floured surface. Wrap in plastic wrap; refrigerate about 45 minutes or until dough is firm and cold, yet pliable. This allows the shortening to become slightly firm, which helps make the baked pastry more flaky. If refrigerated longer, let pastry soften slightly before rolling. <br>  <br>  3. Heat oven to 425¬∞F. With floured rolling pin, roll pastry into round 2 inches larger than upside-down 9-inch quiche dish or glass pie plate. Fold pastry into fourths; place in quiche dish. Unfold and ease into dish, pressing firmly against bottom and side. Trim overhanging edge of pastry 1 inch from rim of pie plate. Fold and roll pastry under, even with plate; flute as desired. <br>  <br>  4. Carefully line pastry with a double thickness of foil, gently pressing foil to bottom and side of pastry. Let foil extend over edge to prevent excessive browning. Bake 10 minutes. Carefully remove foil and bake 2 to 4 minutes longer or until pastry just begins to brown and has become set. If crust bubbles, gently push bubbles down with back of spoon. <br>  <br>  5. Reduce oven temperature to 325¬∞F. Sprinkle bacon, cheese and onion in pie crust. In medium bowl, beat eggs slightly; beat in remaining filling ingredients. Pour into quiche dish.  <br>  <br>  6. Bake 45 to 50 minutes or until knife inserted in center comes out clean. Let stand 10 minutes before serving.  <br>  <br>  Time Saver  <br>  No time to make your own crust? Look for Betty Crocker? pie crust mix, or consider using a ready-to-go refrigerated pie crust. <br>  Variation  <br>  <br>  For Mushroom Quiche, add a 4-ounce can of mushroom pieces and stems, drained, and a 2-ounce jar of diced pimientos, well drained, with the bacon.

rsTB7D1zaa	First time drinking you'll almost certainly hate whiskey.  <br>  <br>  If it cost over $25 for a 750mL (ie, Jack Daniels or better), then you should try some over ice.  If you can't handle that, then add some coke.<br>  <br>  Under $25, they don't particularly taste good straight up.  So, mix these from the start.  Coke works with most, but sour mix works really good with cheap whiskey because it has such a powerful flavor (on its own, its like a lemonade that is too sweet and too sour).<br>  <br>  If, however, you happen to have Scotch then I must say that it is best taken neat, or if you must, mixed with distilled water.  To be honest, all Scotch starts out around 63%ABV (in the barrels), and the DISTILLERY themselves *ADD* water to make it 40-43%ABV where people can drink it neat.  It's still strong, but manageable.  Adding more distilled water cuts the flavors, which is why some people object to such things, but it also cuts the alcohol concentration so it goes down easier.  A common example of Scotch would be Johnnie Walker (Red label is under $25).  You can also add ice; this benefits because it cools down the drink making the alcohol flavor less pronounced, then as it warms up the ice melts and dilutes your drink so its even easier to drink.|`|rUvaitfLaa	Mix it with 7-Up or Sprite with a lime squeezed in it.

TODzjTczaa	You actually would die before you lost any appreciable amount of weight.  When your nutrition is THAT poor, your body goes into "ultraconservative"mode, and it consumes your own organs and tissues rather than give up it's fat reserves, which it percieves as needing in order to survive on such little nutrient.  <br>  <br>  And, the previous answer is correct -- you can survive for 3-4 weeks on just water.  Celery is actually WORSE than just water, because it requires more calories to digest than it gives you, but the only result of that is that you would be completely exhausted for those 3-4 weeks instead of just starving to death.|`|CXOs4mAEaa	Maybe 3-4 weeks but only if you are drinking fluids...

f262cda35c3c0959f3b4089b38f0359faa	Pecans have about 1/2 the carbs as do almonds. so you may want to try them unless all you have are almonds then I see no reason why not.|`|b455e7e5ef382907322ac029d8e12a86aa	That recipe sounds delicious!  Almonds MIGHT work, but they would be a very expensive alternative.|`|YupMCYHlaa	For this recipe, the breadcrumb are not an integral part, just a coating.  If  you put them in the mixture in the first step, then they would be there to absorb moisture, or to bind the mixture together, and in that case ground almonds wouldn't be a good substitute.  But in this case they're just a coating, so you could use a lot of things instead.<br>  <br>  Though the recipe says 2 cups of breadcrumbs, the amount of breadcrumbs one person would eat is not really very much, maybe a tablespoon or two.  There is a lot of fat in the recipe (cheese and egg yolks!  Both fairly high in fat!) and fat slows the absorption of breadcrumbs in the digestive system, so the amount of carbs is not as effective as if you ate the same amount of bread by itself.  So you probably could get away with using breadcrumbs.<br>  <br>  But there are other things you can substitute.  You could get some fried pork rinds and crush them, they have no carbs at all.  Yes, we all know pork rinds are not good for you, but we're talking a couple of tablespoons here.  Coarsely chopped nuts will also work, plus they taste really good.|`|oX1209WOaa	This recipe could be quite sticky due to the eggs.

If it's for saving animals or for the environment, it's entirely your decision. Maybe you could make a rule where you only eat meat at that restaurant. <br>  <br>  But really, no one should tell you it's wrong that you do or don't eat meat; because who cares what other people think anyway. It's your life and your body, and if you can go vegetarian for a little while then you can eat meat whenever you want to too. Don't let 15 year old girls or old guys tell you what you should and shouldn't do.|`|XMEQPIvBaa	No, stay a vegetarian! That's my advice, at least.

6beL9zycaa	I don't know how they make theirs, but get a jar of crushed garlic (in olive oil), & mix in a big tablespoon of the garlic with some softened (salted) butter... you can adjust the ratio to your own taste, I use a LOT of garlic!  Don't melt the butter completely because it separates & you don't want that.  After you mix the garlic & butter, spread it onto your french bread or whatever your preferred choice of bread is, sprinkle just a tiny bit of salt over it...just a PINCH, throw it under the broiler until it turns golden, take out, let it cool, & PIG OUT, it's SO good, lol!

It's not that GM crop are more suceptable than standard crops, but genetic diversity in crops prevents major crop losses.<br>  <br>  The second issue I have is with crops that express toxins as pesticides.  These toxins are typically used by organic farmers as a intervention when infestations occur, but by having the plants express the toxin, the insects will quickly evolve resistance to the toxins.<br>  <br>  Third is the concept of stealing genetic material from the developing world and then patenting the genes so that non-GM crops are no longer legal to grow.<br>  <br>  Another legal issue is creating terminator seeds, so that farmers can't use part of their crop to reseed their fields the next year.<br>  <br>  GM crops also put much of the world's seed supply into a few hands, which can create cartels and artificially raise the price of seeds.  It also means if something goes wrong with a company, the impact of losing their product can be catastrophic.<br>  <br>  GM crops need more inputs, like water weed killers and fertilizer, than standard crops. In the developing world, this means risking money which is scarce, vs time and labor which is abundant.  Farmers have to borrow money to get the chemicals and if their crop fails due to drought infestation or some other cause, they become bankrupt. 700,000 Indian farmers have commited suicide from crop failures after borrowing money for seeds and chemicals and many more have sold their wives into protitution to pay off the loans. In other countries the farmers sell off their kidneys to pay off the debt.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.reasonforliberty.com/reason/how-government-kills-poor-farmers-the-gm-genocide.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.reasonforliberty.com/reason/h...</a>|`|wj5YVqroaa	um, it could cause long term health problems..<br>  gradual build up of toxins in fatty tissue..

Other independent restaurants will get it premade from a variety of restaurant suppliers.  It may not be the same dressing available in retail stores.<br>  <br>  My favorite pre-made dressing is Maries.  It's in the refrigerated section near the salad stuff.

aWjYJjzoaa	Yes, there is as much a difference between a fresh beet and a canned beet as there is a difference with any fresh vegetable that also comes in cans.  Canned beets are highly processed and sitting in liquid in a can for god knows how long before you get them...<br>  <br>  Here is how I cook my beets at home:<br>  Leave the root end alone, and cut off the stems leaving a full inch attached to the beet.  Drop them into boiling salted water and lightly boil for about 30-45 minutes till you can easily slide a sharp knife into their centers.  Strain the beets.  When cool enough to handle, remove the skins under running water.  <br>  Toss the beets onto a baking dish, pour olive oil, salt and pepper over and bake in the oven 400o for another 20 - 30 minutes.  Shake them around every 10 minutes.<br>  Fantastic!  You'll never return to canned again.<br>  <br>  <br>  Really? Thumbs down?|`|f262cda35c3c0959f3b4089b38f0359faa	1. Yes.

Bring to a boil, then cook for 20 to 30 minutes, until tender. Drain and cool, then cut in to cubes. <br>  While the beets are cooking, place the walnuts in a skillet over medium-low heat. Heat until warm and starting to toast, then stir in the maple syrup. Cook and stir until evenly coated, then remove from the heat and set aside to cool. <br>  In a small bowl, whisk together the orange juice concentrate, balsamic vinegar and olive oil to make the dressing. <br>  Place a large helping of baby greens onto each of four salad plates, divide candied walnuts equally and sprinkle over the greens. Place equal amounts of beets over the greens, and top with dabs of goat cheese. Drizzle each plate with some of the dressing.

Fill sink with "neutral" water which is room temperature. Add your frozen food which will cool down the water quickly by removing the heat from the food.

If you have no whisk and can't get one, use two forks and hold them together with the tines facing out.

This results in all the fat being retained in the body whenever milk is drunk.  If you buy 'full cream' unhomogenised milk... although you take in a higher fat product, the fat globules are intact and of such a size that they cannot be ingested... and they pass through the system and are excreted.|`|b3889ee355f01fc906d1159fd12fa66daa	I used to work in Tesco and the milk tastes this way if it is left out of the fridge too long, when it is delivered they have a time frame to get it back in the chiller but sometimes they think they can get away with leaving it outside a bit longer if it's cold and thats when it tastes creamy.|`|8nmEXGctaa	I buy semi skimmed from Tesco and must admit that I have not found it to have changed.|`|m01ijLFUaa	Uhh..

AA11786341	1. Get out a medium or large skillet. You'll want something with a depth of at least 3 inches because that how much water you'll be putting in. I've seen recipes say to use a 1/2 cup to a full cup of water. I prefer the 2 to 3 inches of water measurement. Add a pinch of salt and bring the water to a boil.<br>  <br>  <br>  2. As your water is heating up, let's crack your egg. The way to go here is to break it into a shallow cup or bowl. A coffee cup will do fine. We're doing this for two reasons: 1) We don't want to break the yolk and 2) we don't want any funky eggs.<br>  <br>  <br>  3. Before you add the egg to the water, reduce the heat of your water so it is right on the edge of not boiling anymore. Now, gently... gently Florence... ease your egg from the cup into the water. Just let it slide out.<br>  <br>  <br>  4. This is the fun part. I love watching poached eggs cook. They look like little floating angels or ghosts. Those flowing strands of white are nothing to be worried about. Just sit back and watch the magic. The amount of time you leave it in the water depends on how firm you want your yolk. Generally speaking, it's 3 minutes for medium firmness, 2 minutes if you like them runny, and 4 minutes if you like a firmer yolk (like your friend Mr Breakfast). <br>  <br>  <br>  5. You'll want to scoop out your egg with a slotted spoon so it can drain. Even if you like your yolk runny, gently finger-touch a thicker part of the egg white to make sure it's firm, as you lift it from the water. If it's not, sink it back in the water a little while longer.<br>  <br>  <br>  6. Spoon your egg onto a paper towel and gently... gently Florence... also pat the top of the egg with the sides of the towel to remove the excess liquid. Some people might advise you to cut the edges of your egg to make a perfect circle at this point. Those people are crazy. The paper towel will retain any loose strands of white and your egg will be shaped just fine.<br>  <br>  <br>  7. Now spatula that tasty poached egg onto your plate or on top of a waiting piece of toast and eat the heck out of it. While reviewing poached eggs to write this, I made one simply seasoned with Lawry's Seasoned Salt and a couple loose peppercorns. It was delicious and reminded me how wonderful poached eggs can be.|`|AA11180444	Either or.

I believe it is to keep the egg from sticking to the bottom of the pot.|`|f7mosa6vaa	So easy, just boil water in a pot with a little salt. When the water gets to a boil just carefully crack open your egg into the water and just lower the flame so it does not over boil. Watch how the egg comes together just right and with a large spoon that has holes in it flip it carefully and then it should be ready in about 3 minutes.  Get English Muffins and toast them and place the Poached eggs on top on the buttered English Muffins with a little pepper and there you are. <br>  <br>  If you are afraid of the boiling water, just crack the egg in a bowl and use the bowl to handle it into the water to prevent yourself from burning your fingers.<br>  <br>  Everyone I know loves Poached Eggs.<br>  <br>  Good Luck<br>  <br>  Linda B

This makes them a bit sweeter than the cans/bottles.<br>  <br>  I too prefer colas like this, far better than canned I feel (although I don't like ice in it) but what is horrid is if the syrup is running out - sometimes there is more carbonated water than syrup and that is not nice!|`|ILpp3ncYaa	All fountain drinks are sweeter.|`|RYDALYuKaa	Haha yess i do as well!

1gyzz3kxaa	I've had to do the same thing for a lot of my recipes.  One of my family's favorite is chicken parmesan.  What I do is season the chicken breasts then dip in egg.  Once coated in egg, I dip it in ground oatmeal that has garlic powder, italian seasoning, and low-fat parmesan sprinkle cheese.<br>  <br>  Once coated in oatmeal, place the chicken on a cookie sheet thats been lightly sprayed with PAM.  Bake for 25 minutes on 400 degrees.<br>  <br>  Briefly take the cooked chicken out of the oven to place a spoonful of sauce upon the filets and cover with cheese.  Cook for 5 more minutes.|`|h9Q9fJOaaa	I don't think it's ever said anywhere that you need breaded chicken for chicken parm.  I make it with whole chicken breast, baked for 45 minutes at 400 degrees.  I use whole wheat noodles boiled in extra virgin olive oil.  I put the chicken on the noodles, put organic marinara on top the chicken and top with 2% mozzarella or fresh parm.  It's much healthier than any fried breaded chicken and the cheese has less saturated fat.|`|Vm7vpqsmaa	LOW FAT CHICKEN PARMESAN   <br>  <br>  Chicken breast (boneless)<br>  Bread crumbs<br>  Pam spray (butter)<br>  Spaghetti sauce (favorite ready-to-use variety)<br>  Parmesan cheese, grated<br>  Egg whites<br>  Mozzarella cheese<br>  <br>  Dip chicken in egg whites that have been slightly beaten and then roll in bread crumbs.

t0tFtPYQaa	There are a dozen ways to cook a steak and all probably very good.<br>  GRILL is by far the most popular way to cook a steak. Either over a wood fire or use charcoal.<br>  BROIL is another by placing the steak3 to 4 inches under the heat.<br>  Fry is another method if done properly.<br>  Fry/Bake As a matter of Fact I am doing that in a few minuets.<br>  I make a rub out of,-<br>  2 tablespoons brown sugar<br>  3 tablespoons meat tenderizer<br>  1 teaspoon hickory smoked salt<br>  1 tablespoon season salt<br>  2 teaspoons ground pepper.<br>  Place rub on steak and let sit at least 2 hours. I placed the rub on yesterday afternoon and will fry/Bake tonight.<br>  Fry bake is to preheat oven to 375 Degrees. Place a CAST IRON skillet on the stove top on high heat. The skillet MUST be CAST IRON and must be HOT.<br>  Remove steaks from the refrigerator 1/2 hour before cooking them to bring to room temperature.<br>  When the skillet is HOT place the steaks in the skillet. DO NOT add any oil of any kind. Place DRY steaks in the pan. This will sear the meat and hold in the juices so the steak will be Juicy but cooked through without drying out. The meat should sear on one side for 2 minutes. Turn over and seat other side for 2 minutes. Remove pan from heat and place in oven for 6 to 10 minuets depending upon the thickness of the steak.|`|MS6IzOPLaa	New York Strips are usually very tender and naturally full of flavor.  You want to enhance their natural flavor and not cover it up.  Use a bit of salt, garlic and pepper.  Then definitely grill them.  I never broil or pan cook a steak, even when it 30 below zero.  Grilling is the only way to go.  Also, be sure you don't overcook them as this is a sure way to ruin a good piece of meat.  Enjoy!|`|ILZY7BD0aa	New york City?  The same way you make new jersey steak.|`|hT7BhNamaa	Sukafree, be smart, just season them with a little sea salt and freshly ground black pepper.

nzpg9jxpaa	Well, heres the skinny, and this is sure to be controversial.  People have deeply rooted beliefs that HFCS is "industrial" and therefore "unnatural" which is automatically "bad" and will "kill you".  None of this is true.<br>  <br>  People started getting "fatter" than "before" in the 1970s, which coincided with the wide introduction of HFCS, causing this "bad and unnatural" link.<br>  <br>  Corn syrup is a sugar product, not unlike table sugar.  It comes from corn, and is very inexpensive in a climate like america where corn grows well and sugar cane does not.  <br>  <br>  The molecules themselves, however, are different than table sugar.  Table sugar is sucrose, which is a 5 and a 6 carbon sugar bonded together into the simplist of the complex carbohydrates... making it a polysaccharide or a disaccharide, to be more precise.<br>  <br>  Corn syrup, however, tends to be a mixture of simple saccharides.  Since it is a mixture, the product does not crystalize at room temperature, making it a syrup.  Sucrose which is 99.999% sucrose crystalizes very well, its like having a bunch of marbles in a box... they sit on the bottom fairly regularly if you shake it up.  If you put a bunch of army men and plastic miniuture trees in a box, however, they won't form any sort of regular structure.  Thats what its like in HFCS.<br>  <br>  This does not change the fact, however, that it is a simple sugar.  Because it is mostly fructose and glucose, our tongues detect it as sweeter than sugar-- we are more sensitive to those chemicals than we are to sucrose (the combo sugar).<br>  <br>  So what is HFCS?  Its sugar, just made from corn instead of cane.  And as long as you are eating a healthy, well balanced diet, there is no more danger in HFCS than there is in eating raw sugar (and it sometimes tastes better, to boot.)|`|WoAAdxHEaa	The truth is, it's ok for you, in moderation. As long as you aren't constantly intaking it, because of all the calories, it is as safe as adding a spoonful of sugar to sweeten up some lemonade. But if you take in too much, just as eating too much, you build fat.<br>  <br>  ignore anyone who says it's bad because it's not natural. all they do is take corn, and concentrate the sugars found in it, creating a sweetener.|`|0ectWZxAaa	Yep and there is mercury in 50% of everything with high fructose syrup. And Mercury is a nuro toxin which is bad for your brain and nervous system.|`|AA11402528	sugar and hfcs are both basically the same nutrionally<br>  <br>  both are bad<br>  but ok in moderation|`|rUk58ywKaa	They say that hfcs is fine "IN MODERATION".  Even the hfcs industry uses those words.  The problem is that it is in almost everything so it is very difficult to consume it only in moderation.  In order to consume hfcs only in moderation it is necessary to do the best you can to avoid it.<br>  A general rule of thumb is to consider how close something is to it's natural state.  The closer it is to it's natural state, the better for you it likely is.  Unfortunately, hfcs is nowhere near it's natural state.|`|5678944d8c35bafa3487e881abd3a2f4aa	I believe HFCS is correlated with foods that cause obesity, diabetes and heart disease.  It is added precisely to foods as a cheap filler extender that will add flavor.  You couldn't have such fine quality products as Fritos and Crunch'n'Munch without it - not necessarily the foods that lead to a fit or even muscular form. <br>  <br>  It's bad - and the proponent websites are corn propagandists.  Oprah should do a show on it - just like she took on beef!|`|umEgRb7Vaa	Your professor and sweetsurprise.com are correct. Taken by itself then hfc is somewhat bad, but it is seldom taken by itself, so there really is no issue. Even in sodas there is sodium usually in the product.|`|AlJ557gHaa	hfcs is kind of like sugar.  it is okay in small doses.  people say that it is really bad for you but that isn't true.  it's just like having sugar.|`|JCaAqF1vaa	Keep your intake of fats and sugars reasonable, get a lot of fruits, vegetables and grains high in fiber. Eat lean meats. Exercise. Drink water. You'll be fine.|`|aFHJC4Blaa	girls and guys who consume hfcs tend to weigh more than people who dont...so i dont eat it :( nasty stuff|`|oKRbe6XYaa	High fructose corn syrup is high in acid & it could be good or bad depending on what circumstance. Like for example, drinks & juices that are high in fructose corn syrup, can be harmful when you consume a big amount of it. A little is okay, just keep the amount balanced. When using high fructose corn syrup for cooking, it can be replaced for real sugar, which gives more flavor. But overall, high fructose corn syrup isn't all that good cus it's rich & natural simple sugar found in corn. It can be really bad & high in calories. High intakes of it can cause someone to be diabetic. So yea, it really depends but just try not to take too much of it since it's real sugar.(*_*)|`|wTqid2ONaa	Anything not naturally occuring, like sugar, is bad for you.
zN6CJ3tzaa	Growing up, we always had venison. The best way to cook it, to me, is in a crock pot. Put the venison in, cut up some celery, potatoes, carrots -- sprinkle with salt and pepper to taste -- put about two tablespoons of cider vinegar or balsamic vinegar on top -- core out a granny smith apple and quarter it, place it on top -- seal it up, set it on high. Leave it to cook all day. When it's done, it will be fork-pull tender.<br>  <br>  The vinegar and the apple help to tenderize and take some of the gaminess out of the venison. Depending on how it was killed, believe it or not, does effect the texture and taste of the meat. If it was hunted down with dogs -- it ran a great deal -- the meat is going to be chewier and there will be a greater tang to the taste. If it was killed by 'still hunting' -- killed quickly and no chase was involved -- the meat will be more tender and the tang will be much, much milder. Sounds crazy, but it's true.<br>  <br>  As a side, cook some broccoli and cauliflower with salt to taste.

Less expensive hot dogs are primarily chicken or turkey, due to the low cost of mechanically separated poultry. Hot dogs have high sodium, fat and nitrite content, which have been linked to health problems in some consumers. In recent years, due to changing dietary preferences, manufacturers have turned to turkey, chicken, or vegetarian meat substitutes, and have begun lowering salt content.<br>  <br>  In general, if a manufacturer produces two types of hot dog sausages, "wieners" tend to contain pork and are the blander of the two, while "franks" tend to be all beef and more-strongly seasoned.|`|mzk0t6Ovaa	When we make them, we make pork hot dogs, and we<br>  use everything from the rooter to the tooter.|`|8cWXhZGjaa	You don't want to know what hot dogs are made of because if I told you, you would not want to eat one again.|`|AA11193773	nobody really knows...<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Unless you look on the ingridients|`|HzkDjDpyaa	Cow sphincters and ant eaters.

If using a large baking dish, cut the pudding into 12 squares. Pour the sauce over the pudding, allowing it to seep down around the sides and cover the top. (Use a fork to pull the pudding away from the pan, to get the sauce down the sides.) Bake for 2 to 3 more minutes. Remove and cool to room temperature. Serve with vanilla ice cream, if desired.

AA10690878	It depends on how fast you drink. Your body processes about 1 oz of liquor per hour, so if you have one drink and then stop, you should have no buzz (or even a slight hint of one) after one hour. If you drink 4oz in one hour, on the other hand, you are legally drunk. (It generally takes the equivalent of 3 drinks to get over the legal limit.)<br>  <br>  There are many different "Russian" cocktails. A White Russian is about 1 to 1-1/2 oz of vodka, 1/2 oz of Kaluha, and 1/2 oz of cream. For a Blind Russian, substitute 1/2 oz of Bailey's for the cream. For a Black Russian, elimiate the Bailey's or the cream altogether.|`|cq2XIko9aa	i have drank vodka once in life 350ml but and i was not drunked,kid this is bad thing one day u r gonna die and u will see hell or heaven so do good deeds and go to heaven

Let proof 5 minutes. <br>  <br>  Put yeast mixture and remaining ingredients (except the egg yolks and 2 T. cream) in food processor fitted with steel blade. Process 10 seconds. Turn dough out on a lightly floured surface and knead by hand, adding more flour as necessary to make a soft but manageable dough that adheres only slightly to your hand. <br>  <br>  Transfer dough to buttered bowl; turn to coat all sides with butter. Cover with plastic; set aside to rise 1 1/2 hours or until doubled. <br>  <br>  Punch dough down with lightly floured fist. <br>  <br>  To bake in 12 individual 3 1/2-inch tins: Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Divide dough into two unequal portions (one-third and two-thirds). Divide each portion into 12 balls (12 large and 12 small balls). <br>  <br>  Place large balls in 12 buttered 3 1/2 brioche tins. With floured thumb make an indentation in each larger ball. Nestle a small ball in each indentation. <br>  <br>  Let rise until doubled. Whisk together egg yolks and cream. Brush brioches with half of the egg glaze, being careful not to let glaze touch sides of tins. Repeat 5 minutes later with remaining glaze. Bake 10 minutes, then reduce oven heat to 350 degrees; bake until golden brown (about 5 to 10 minutes more). <br>  <br>  To bake in loaf shape: Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Form dough into a loaf shape. Place in a single buttered 9-inch loaf pan. Let rise until doubled. Whisk together egg yolks and cream. Brush dough with half of the egg glaze, being careful not to let glaze touch sides of pan. Repeat 5 minutes later with remaining glaze. Bake 10 minutes, then reduce oven to 350 degrees and continue baking 30 minutes longer or until loaf sounds hollow when tapped on the bottom. <br>  <br>  Remove from pan and cool completely on a rack before slicing. <br>  <br>  Makes about 1 dozen 3 1/2-inch brioches or one 9-inch loaf. <br>  <br>  Since you have to use yeast it's going to have to rise.

The Coca-Cola Company discontinued Mello Yello in the mid-1990s and replaced it with a similar drink called Surge that never really caught on. They brought Mello Yello back after a few years, but it's still not available everywhere. In many places the soda/energy drink hybrid Vault has replaced it. <br>  <br>  According to Wikipedia in America it's sold mainly in the southern states, so maybe Coca-Cola has decided it doesn't sell well in northern states with their milder climates. By that reasoning they probably figure it won't sell well in Canada either. I live in Wisconsin myself and can't remember the last time I saw it for sale anywhere. (That doesn't necessarily mean they don't sell it here, though, because I rarely drink it and thus wouldn't be looking for it.)

hKlsJgVSaa	I would stick the chicken in the freezer in protions of how many your family usually uses per meal. If you freeze them solid tongiht then take them out of the freezer like tomorrow after noon or so you should be good. It have found that it usually take 2 days for stuff to thaw in the fridge.<br>  <br>  The beef will be better for longer. The person who was talking about smelling the chicken was only partially right. You do that with beef not with chicken. If there is a strong beef smell that is good as it means your beef has aged and will add some flavor to crappy super market beef.<br>  <br>  If there is a sour or spoiled smell then toos it out. But like I said a strong beef smell is still okay.|`|qjPD5yinaa	I probably wouldn't. If it is best before today the meat is not going to be as fresh as when you first bought it (which if you think of it, how long has it been in packaging before you bought?), so if the meat is already old, you are cooking old meat, and then in two more days time you're eating even older meat despite it being cooked.  Smell it, if it has a smell that isn't like fresh meat then turf it, it's better than being sick.  If in doubt chuck it out.|`|AA11180444	You should be ok, think if it was still in the store and no one had bought it.  Wouldn't you think it would still be ok?

EMDNVrcjaa	I've seen some posts about how to make Curry Chicken, Chicken Curry etc. Firstly, everyone calls it Curry Chicken except Guyanese people and most Caucasian people. The correct term is Curry Chicken (as in Curried Chicken). Secondly, there are hundreds of types of Curry because curry in its natural form is a green plant that is mixed with other spices including Tumeric/Safrin (which give it is yellow color). When making curry of any kind be aware of the type of curry that you use. Here is the Trinidadian Style Curry Chicken recipe that I am familiar with.<br>  <br>  Ingredients:<br>  <br>  1 Large Diced White Onion<br>  3-4 Pealed and Diced Potatoes<br>  5 Large garlic cloves<br>  1 tbsl Fresh Ginger<br>  6-7 tbls Curry powder (Preferably Lahl's Curry Powder)<br>  2 tbls Cumin<br>  1-3 Green Chili's (uncut and depending on preference) Congo or Scotch Bonnette peppers are best<br>  1/4 cup Finely chopped fresh cilantro<br>  12 Chicken thighs (or quaters split into leg and thigh)<br>  2 tbls Vegetable Oil<br>  1/2 tbls Brown Sugar<br>  3/4 cups Finely Chopped Green Onion<br>  4 tbls Dark Mushroom Soya Sauce<br>  Salt/Pepper<br>  Cooked rice<br>  <br>  1. First thing is marinate the chicken by mixing in and rubbing the Curry powder, Cumin, Soya Sauce, Onions, Green Onions, Ginger and Cilantro all over the meat (Some people like to mix in some oyster sause too) so that it can sit while you do the other parts. Leave a little bit of the Onions for the next step.<br>  <br>  2. Start the pot with the Vegetable Oil at just below high (each stove varies) and throw the Garlic and Onions into the oil and let it sizzle until they turn clear, then turn down the temperature to just above medium. This allows the oil to take the flavour of the Onion/Garlic.<br>  <br>  3. At this point you throw all the chicken in to the pot and stir it around a bit. Let the excess water from the thawed chicken boil out then add 2-3 cups of water so that the chicken is just below the water. Cover the pot and let it boil.<br>  <br>  4. Take the brown sugar and put it in another pot with a few drops of oil and water on medium temperature. Melt the sugar and allow it to turn brown but don't let it burn to your pot. It should turn a dark brown color and thin out into a liquid (You can skip this stage by buying browing sauce at the Supermarket). Pour into the pot with the chicken.<br>  <br>  5. At this stage you should have a pot of chicken boiling away and it should be a brown color NOT yellow. If isn't brown, you may need to add a little more soya sauce but no more browning sauce as it can turn everything bitter. Let this boil for about 10-15mins or until the chicken starts to look 'fluffed'. Add the Pototoes and let it boil until the Potatoes are cooked and starting to melt.<br>  <br>  6. Salt to flavour and let sit on low for 3 mins with the cover on.<br>  <br>  7. Serve on Rice (optional with Pepper Sauce) with Salad<br>  <br>  Serves 6-8<br>  Preparation Time: 10min<br>  Cooking Time: 30-35min

FEVQisMGaa	Meat grades. Courtesy of the United States Dept. of Agriculture<br>  <br>  Prime > Choice > Select.<br>  <br>  It deals w/ how marbleized the fat is.<br>  <br>  Marbleized = good.<br>  <br>  Generally, fat content is a good thing. But there are instances where you wouldn't want a high fat content. When you cook meats to well done or close to well done status, the shrinkage is proportionate to the fat content/marbleization.<br>  <br>  It's not good for a hamburger that is well done.<br>  <br>  Here's an expanded grading system. Again, USDA standards.<br>  <br>  Prime<br>  Choice<br>  Select<br>  Standard<br>  Commercial<br>  Utility<br>  Cutter<br>  Cannner<br>  <br>  But the grading system has shifted--specifically, standards were lowered for economic reasons to feed more people.<br>  <br>  There is also a grade of meat that goes beyond most nation's Prime rating. That's the Japanese Kobe beef courtesy of the Wagyu cattle.<br>  <br>  To achieve the designation, it has to be a Wagyu breed (a special steer that has been bred for centuries specifically for it's marbleized fat) and raised in the Kobe region of Japan.<br>  <br>  No exceptions. You can have Kobe equivalent Wagyu, but it cannot legally be called Kobe if it is not from Kobe.<br>  <br>  It is pampered, fed, and naturally raised (actually it's above and beyond natural)--some have suggested that cows are given sake (alcohol, a Japanese analog to beer).<br>  <br>  The marbling at times is so extreme that the beef looks as white as snow.<br>  <br>  It has a specific fat that is considered healthy for consumption and is frequently compared to foie gras in tenderness and fat content.<br>  <br>  American beef fat contains a lot of chemicals, given how they were raised. Vitamins/chemicals store themselves in the fatty tissue deposits.<br>  <br>  You might be thinking to yourself...<br>  <br>  Why does fat matter?<br>  Well it does, and it doesn't...<br>  <br>  Fat is essentially an oil. And oil acts as a chemical transport.<br>  In this case, the chemicals you want are flavor molecules.<br>  Ergo, fats and oils are flavor transports.<br>  So meat where the fat is well incorporated within the muscle tissue can distribute and carry flavor better than meat with little to no fat.<br>  <br>  Natural fat in beef, however, generally has no flavor. So beef that is improperly prepared, regardless of it's high grading/marbling, can come out bland and flavorless.<br>  <br>  A problem with poorly cooked Kobe.<br>  <br>  Fat also gives the beef a more tender texture. But tenderness is also a factor of the cut of the meat, and how the meat is sliced, and how you go about chewing it.|`|XzLUA7ataa	Prime -comes from young specially fed cattle, is well flavored, fine-textured, tender and encased in fat.  Not available in neighborhood markets.<br>  Choice - has less fat than prime in the marbling of the lean portions.<br>  It has a slightly darker tone, retains high, tender, juicy eating quality<br>  Good - Is still relatively tender, but has higher ratio of lean to fat<br>  Standard - Is cut from young low-quality animals with little marbling in the lean portions.  It may be bland or not tender.<br>  Commercial - come from old animals may be tough, lacking in fat|`|829070aea711a47d99d908ff132df3bbaa	The higher the fat content the better the meat.<br>  Prime=high amount of marbling and fat.( most expensive).<br>  Choice=fair amount of marbling<br>  Select= little to no marbling<br>  Standard=Completely void of marbling( cheapest)|`|hXQjnPuGaa	Its how they describe the quality of the meat, based on the amount of marbling (fat) and tenderness of the meat.<br>  <br>  Prime has the most fat, and is the highest quality. It's the most expensive and the most tender. <br>  <br>  Select has some marbling, and is often tougher.<br>  <br>  Choice is in the middle, and is preferred by most Americans. <br>  <br>  Those grades only tell you the quality of the meat based on the tenderness of the meat.  they tell you nothing about the wholesomeness. The lower quality cuts provide the same nutrition, but they will be tougher and may require a moist heat cooking method. <br>  <br>  There are other grades of even lower quality than select. There's cutter, canner, and I think there's another one but I forget the name. They're used for processed foods.|`|5zNwBQZHaa	It has to do with amount of "marbling" in the meat.  Marbling is the small amounts of fat found in the muscle tissue.  The more fat in the tissue (as opposed to surrounding it) the better it tastes.<br>  <br>  Prime has the most marbling.  Most of this goes to restaurants but some high end grocery stores have it.<br>  <br>  Choice has less marbling than Prime, but more than select.<br>  <br>  Select has less than choice - <br>  <br>  How the decide meat grades has changed over the years, but those are the definitions.|`|1gyzz3kxaa	Only the top three grades are sold in U.S. markets. Grading is based on several factors blah blah blah, but it's primarily determined by the amount of marbling. The higher the grade, the more marbling and therefore the more flavorful the cut should be. The lower the grade, the leaner and tougher the beef.<br>  <br>  Prime, the Highest Grade Prime has the most marbling and is so hard to find, they usually come attached to a French waiter with a pencil-thin mustache and big bill.<br>  <br>  Choice, the Next Highest Grade<br>  Most filets are rated Choice, so it's hard to call this grade second best. While these cuts have less marbling than Prime, they're still of exceptional quality. Generally, this is what you'd find at your local butcher shop.<br>  <br>  Select, the Short Bus Grade<br>  Still in the top three, Select has the least amount of marbling, making it leaner but also less flavorful. This grade is typically found in the self-service meat department at your local supermarket.

xBd96wvRaa	Don't bake it broil it. On your broiler pan. <br>  Pre-heat the broiler and I leave the broiler in to get nice and hot to achieve a more seared effect. <br>  <br>  An average steak (thickness 1 1/2 inches) will take between 3-6 minutes on each side. Depending on how done you like it. Error on the side of undercooked. <br>  <br>  For a olive oil on each side. <br>  <br>  You can also purchase steak seasoning at your local grocery store, that is convenient because many spices are already combined in one shaker. <br>  <br>  I would put it in a deep plate or casserole dish, poke some holes with a fork pour a bit of red wine and Worcestershire over it. <br>  <br>  Season it using the steak seasoning, pat the seasoning into the meat a bit, then lightly brush on some olive oil I have added a bit of fresh garlic to. <br>  Sometimes I used real melted butter instead of olive oil. <br>  <br>  After you have done all that let it sit for about a half hour, a really quick marinate. When using wine you don't want to marinate it for too long. The presence of the wine with fork poked holes tenderizes the meat nicely. <br>  <br>  Remember to let it sit after you remove it for about 5 minutes so when you cut it the juices don't end up outside the steak on your plate.<br>  <br>  If you feel creative use the left over marinade left in the casserole dish to make a reduction sauce- dump it in a pan and heat and stir until thickened on the stove top, more red wine or a port (a sweeter sauce then if you use a cab or other red wine) can be added and should be during this process. I serve the sauce on the side for dipping. <br>  <br>  Costco has the best steaks, I prefer their New York cut, about 2 1/2 - 3 inch steaks).|`|XzLUA7ataa	Rather than bake the steak in the oven, select another method of cooking.  Prepare it in an ordinary skillet by searing one side and then the other, or place it under a broiler to brown each side, or use an outdoor grill.<br>  <br>  If you bake it in the oven, you are preparing a pot roast and it will take about two hours.

You should immediately hear the sizzle sound and smell that great cooking smell that will just wet your appetite. Wait about 3-4 minutes all depending on the cut - thickness and turn over and you should see a nice golden brown on the side you cooked.  Hint, then if the steak is thick take the frying pan and place it on 450 degree oven for 10- 15 minutes and it should be rear.  If you want the steak medium then leave it in a little longer.

You cook chuck steak in the oven.<br>  <br>  Sirloin you pan fry in a skillet after pounding it flat with a mallet.<br>  <br>  At 3 pounds it sounds like you have a roast instead of a steak.  Cut it into two possibly three steaks....the thinner the better.  Then fry them.<br>  <br>  It you just have to have them as a roast, your best bet is a slow cooker (crock pot).  Take a knife and stab deeply into the meat at various angles.

The reason is the fat isn't marbled into the meat...it's in a trim along the edge.  Whatever fat is in the meat will quickly sweat out of the meat which will then turn the consistency of shoe leather.  A chuck steak, the fat is all marbled and mixed in with the meat.

xrRZeROmaa	What she had was a sour dough starter.  It did not become bread, until a portion of it was removed, and baked.  You knead the bag daily, and at least once a week, you add more flour and water, and remove enough for a loaf of bread, which you bake in an oven after it rises at least twice.<br>  <br>  This is out of context, but if you visit Wikipedia, you will recognize this bag of dough, and the reason for it's existence.<br>  <br>  A sourdough starter is a stable symbiotic culture of bacteria and yeast present in a mixture of flour and water. The yeasts Candida milleri or Saccharomyces exiguus usually populate sourdough cultures symbiotically with Lactobacillus sanfranciscensis.[1]. Lactobacillus sanfranciscensis (bacteria) was named for its discovery in San Francisco sourdough starters.<br>  <br>  Often a starter will consist of basic items such as: water, bread flour, rye flour and a sourdough starter which can be purchased at certain grocery stores. Once the starter is made, water and flour must be added in time increments over a period of days. Depending on the locale of the bakery and the type of bread being made, the starter can be either a relatively fluid batter or a stiffer dough; as a general rule, more sour breads are made with a liquid starter. Firm starters (such as the Flemish Desem starter) are often more resource-intensive, traditionally being buried in a large container of flour to prevent drying out.|`|IduItEH9aa	She was actually making yeast from which she then made bread.   You're thinking of what some folks call "friendship bread".

In our hi-tech world almost everything comes prepackaged and designed for instant gratification. So where does a recipe that takes ten days to make fit in? Maybe it's a touch stone to our past - to those days not so very long ago when everything we did took time and where a bread that took 10 days to make was not as extraordinary as it seems today. <br>  <br>  The recipe comes to us from Mrs. Norma Condon of Los Angeles. Amish Friendship Bread is a great bread for the holidays. When you've made your bread, you can give your friends a sample and the starter that made it! Then your friends can make their own and pass it along to their friends. This is why the bread is called "friendship bread". It makes a great homemade birthday and Christmas present. Church groups and hospitals have spread a lot of love and cheer by making Amish Friendship Bread for their members. Many people make it regularly just because it tastes so good! <br>  <br>  Amish Friendship Bread is a genuine starter bread. If you know someone with a starter, you are in luck. For those of you without access to a starter, we've done our research and found a great option. It's a special starter in powder form that can be activated with flour and water; it's safe, very inexpensive and we can send it to you.<br>  <br>  Starter for Amish Friendship Bread (G-110) <br>  <br>  The Recipe<br>  <br>  Important Note: Don't use metal spoons or equipment.

xrRZeROmaa	baking times will be extended if you are cooking other items in the oven at the same time.  Might take 2 1/4 hours.  You can use a Microwave to hasten them along, but it will affect the texture and taste of the potatoes.  <br>  <br>  Kitchen stores carry aluminum nails which can be inserted into the middle of large russets for baking.  They will cut the cooking time almost in half by adding heat to the middle of the potato.|`|eeHrcxjEaa	Easier way, and alot faster:<br>  <br>  Take a fork and stab holes deep in the potato, all over it.  Soften some butter and spread it all over the potato.

xrRZeROmaa	A really simple recipe is to cut your chicken in cubes about the same size as canned new potatoes, and alternate one piece of chicken with one canned new potato and one slice of onion or bell pepper, or both.  Since the potatoes are already done, the process involves only cooking the chicken.  Season it the way you want, and turn often or put on a rotisserie.  This is an excellent recipe for open fire cooking at a camp out.  Too bad it's raining.<br>  <br>  You can do this with small red potatoes or small new potatoes, if you parboil them for about 15 minutes before skewering them.|`|6f2db755a3cb804e6e5942093e504c5baa	here is wat you'll need<br>  enjoy XD<br>  <br>  <br>  ? cup Olive oil <br>  ? cup Red wine vinegar <br>  2 Cloves garlic; finely chopped <br>  2 tablespoons Chopped fresh herbs <br>  2 teaspoons Sugar <br>  ? teaspoon Salt <br>  ? teaspoon Pepper <br>  4 Boneless skinless chicken breast halves; cut in 1 1/2 in cube <br>  4 Red skinned potatoes; quartered <br>  8 Strips bacon; halved lengthwise|`|Vm7vpqsmaa	Measure Ingredient <br>  ? cup Olive oil <br>  ? cup Red wine vinegar <br>  2  Cloves garlic; finely chopped <br>  2 tablespoons Chopped fresh herbs <br>  2 teaspoons Sugar <br>  ? teaspoon Salt <br>  ? teaspoon Pepper <br>  4  Boneless skinless chicken breast halves; cut in 1 1/2 in cube <br>  4  Red skinned potatoes; quartered <br>  8  Strips bacon; halved lengthwise <br>  <br>  <br>  Brush grill rack with vegetable oil.

Mix Beef (or eggplant or soy) with sauce.<br>  Step2<br>  Heat over to 350 degrees. No boiling is needed, no matter the kind of noodles used. Layer bottom of 9x13 pan with sauce (using a large spoon) and place 3 noodles side by side, longways and not touching, in pan. Layer more sauce on that and sprinkle mozzerella (and parmesan if wanted) across. Spoon drops of ricotta over, then repeat the above steps until pan is almost full.

doz7RIoeaa	Unless you really know what you are doing, it's best to just buy dehydrated meals at a "survival" store which are tried and tested. Most home made "meals" by amateurs come out slimy, unappetizing and sometimes toxic. If you want, you can make individual dehydrated items from fruits like pineapple, mango, apricots. Best to use fruits that are not too watery at their fresh state. Then just make a "meal" put of them with nuts, vegan crackers/pretzels etc. You can also bring dried pasta, rice and other grain and cook them later, There also military MREs (Meals Ready to Eat) that I think are vegan like the spaghetti with marinara sauce.|`|llkSmgLJaa	You can dehydrate potatoes but they last good anyway. <br>  Dried fruits. <br>  Trail mix. <br>  Instant oats<br>  Instant rice <br>  Soy flour to make soy milk. <br>  Coffee<br>  TVP (textured vegetable protein) you add water to make veggie patties similar to Boca burgers.|`|YfxydPF5aa	When I go backpacking I will dehydrate marinara sauce. You can add it in to the boiling water with the noodles. Sometimes I'll bring one of those thai boxed noodles and seasoning meals (i take it out of the box before i go). I know you can buy instant re fried beans and you could bring tortillas but I don't know how it would go to make your own.. Good luck!|`|AA10923010	you can dehydrate most veggies and rehydrate them later but they always eat better in soup. take lots of veggie boullion|`|ELIKp5tDaa	what about a veggie boullion and some dried veggies <br>  could bring barley or rice or something to add to veggie soup.<br>  <br>  other than that im not sure 'cause im not vegan lol
