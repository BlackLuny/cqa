Four of the remaining questions, including one on geometric distributions are worth 7 marks each and the remaining 4 questions, including the question on binomial distributions are worth 9 marks each.   The 7 mark questions are the first four questions on the paper, but are in a random order.   The 9 mark questions are the last 4 questions, but are arranged in random order.      Find the probability -       b) the questions on geometric distributions and on binomial distributions are next to one another.      c) the questions on geometric distributions and on binomial distributions are separated by at least 2 other questions.

What was your initial velocity?      b) In attempting to turn your car around, you inadvertently end up stuck on the patch of ice (assume it is a frictionless surface) and have to be pulled off the surface by a tow truck with a cable and winch.  The two truck cable is at an angle 40.0 degrees with respect to the horizontal surface.  The tension in the cable during the pulling process is 3.50 X 10^3 N.  The car has a mass of 1.0 X 10^3 kg.  How much work is done by the cable in moving the car a distance of 15 m?      c) The tow truck driver pulls your vehicle onto the flat-bed.

To do this:      Using the fact that the volume is 15 cubic inches express h in terms of r.      Then express the surface area of the can in terms of r, by first expressing it in the terms of r and h and then substituting in your answer for h.      Finally graph the function of the surface area and find the r value that gives a minimum.      What r gives the minimum surface area? What height does this correspond to?      Thanks so anyone who helps.

20090202121314AAp0jM7	Science & Mathematics;Mathematics	Quadratic graph help!?!?	I have a question about quadratic graphs. I have been asked to use x values of -2 to 4 and find the corresponding y values. I have to use this equation: 2x^2 -5x -3. I have been trying to do this at least 7 or 8 times now. I keep getting these y values: 15, 4, -3, -6, -5, 0, 9.    How come the y values don't repeat to make a proper parabolas? How come the quadratic graph isn't symmetrical? Am I doing something wrong?   I don't think I copied down the function wrong because it is y=2x^2 -5x -3 which is the same as y=ax^2 +bx +c

To determine the amount of NaHCO3 in Alka Seltzer tablets by observing the amount of CO2 produced   from the acid-base reaction of HCO3   - with acetic acid (in vinegar).   Background:   Alka Seltzer is an effervescent tablet that contains aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid), citric acid, and   sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3). As soon as the tablet dissolves in water, the NaHCO3 dissociates to   form a bicarbonate ion (HCO3   —) and a sodium ion (Na+)   1. NaHCO3 (s) → Na+ (aq) + HCO3— (aq)   Acetic acid, which will “donate” H+ to water to create H3O+(aq), is added to the mixture. The following   acid-base reaction then takes place:   2. HCO3— (aq) + H3O+ (aq) → 2H2O (l) + CO2 (g)   (The sodium ion does not take part in this reaction, and so is not included in the equation.)   According to the above equation, one mole of HCO3   - reacts with one mole of H3O+. If the   number of moles of each reactant is not the same, than one reactant will be completely used up during   the reaction, while some of the other reactant will remain at the end of the reaction. In this experiment   you will dissolve Alka Seltzer in various concentrations of vinegar and measure the amount of CO2   produced. From this data you will calculate the amount of NaHCO3 in the Alka Seltzer by percent   weight (mass).

20090205113700AAqEe6I	Science & Mathematics;Earth Sciences & Geology	How do we know what the Earth's composition is under the crust? How likely is Science going to change?	I heard that no one has been below the Earth's crust before, however we have good scientific evidence to believe the inner core is solid, outer core is liquid, the mantle is another way, etc.  I heard scientists reasonably believe this because when there's an earthquake, seismic waves move through the Earth, so they measure refraction of waves, or something like that?  How does this all work?  How do they calculate?      Also, I keep hearing that in Science we can't "prove", but only "fail to disprove".  Newton gave us all of these equations and scientific laws.  He would test them by saying, "If this scientific law is correct, we expect that this will happen."  However, just because these observations happened, didn't prove the reverse, that Newton's Laws were true (universal).  Over time, new up-to-date and refined laws and equations explained all the previous observations just as well, and Newton's equations were replaced by different ones (even if they were mostly minor changes).  The history of Science tells us that over time, new empirical evidence can make us refine and change our equations and constants.  So, one thing I was wondering, they use equations and constants to calculate what's under the Earth's crust from seismic waves, right?  If these equations and constants change over time to fit new empirical evidence, how possible is it that Science's view of the Earth below the crust could change?  (Keep in mind, I'm not saying it will, I'm just being hypothetical)  And if it does happen, how much could it change by (ex. very slight, moderately, etc)?  This is something that I was just thinking about, since I learned in Science you can't prove but only fail to disprove.  I don't know too much about seismology and under the crust, but was curious how they study it.

The most common answer seems to be that "gravity pulls me and makes me remain over Japan"...but lets assume that I am hovering over the Equator and remaining over the Equatorial line the whole time...meaning the gravity remains the same through out....and I was of the belief that Gravity is directed towards the center of the Earth and not over any place in particular (JAPAN ) in this case....If I am right..then how can Gravity which is always directed towards the center of Earth...cause a drag effect that keeps me over Japan.....  Then another answer i got about being governed by the laws of nature...and flying form east to west and from West to east taking different time....isnt that right actually...isnt that the reason why aircrafts flying from US to India flies against the rotation of the Earth  and not with the rotation of Earth...correct me if i am wrong.
