I am not a steelers fan, nor do i hate them   i am not a cardinals fan, nor do i hate them      But i dont know what i find more annoying since the superbowl ended last night....(ITS BEEN ONE DAY AND IM ALEADY LIKE SHHHHHHHH[please])       Cardinals fans screaming about blow calls, missed opportunities, the ways of fate, bad pass blocking, 3 men unable to guard one wr, poor defensive play, last second calls and everything else      or steelers fans who even though they won the super bowl, can not calm down and be happy about it, still are yelling at eveyone one else, screaming at the angry cardinals fans, screaming at everyone else they think there better then, screaming just because they like to hear themselves.         I watched the game, and yes did see that the Cards did get a lot called on them, but honestly most of it was there fault. Though in their defense, WHAT THE HECK was harrison doing to that poor cards player? he just kept beating him to the ground for no reason.All the respect i gained for him on his sweet PICK-6 all went down the drain after that BS.      And the cards really should have sacked Big Ben a lot more then they did so its really not much to whine about i suppose. They let his bug butt run up and around, buying hours of time to make completions as they look dumbfounded like which way he go?      all in all i found it to be quite an exciting game.      but seriously, both of you sets of fans need to calm the heck down      (steelers and cards fans will most likely ignore all ive wrote and just start yelling about something random, but hey its whatever)      anyone one else's thoughts?

20090202111448AAF1A6Z	Sports;Football (American)	The refs at the Superbowl were one-sided.?	Does anyone else think the refs were unfair against Arizona? The Cardinals lost more then 100 yards just because of penalty's. The Steelers lost about 30 if that. The cardinals lost the ball at the end and i think his hand was moving forward. That might have cost them the Superbowl. When the Steelers ran 100 yards in one play, one of the defenceman should have got a holding penalty but the refs didn't even THINK to look at it but when the cardinals did something that NOBODY saw, it was a huge penalty. stuff that shouldn't be a pealty like at the end when someone hit the quarterback, it was a roughing penalty. HE DIDN"T EVEN THINK ABOUT HITTING HIS HEAD! One of the steelers was pushing a player and punching a player when he was down but all they got was a TINY penanly! I think the refs were really unfair. Even though I was going for the cardinals, my friends were going for the Steelers and they agree with me so don't think i did all this because i don't like the Steelers. I really think the refs were unfair.

Ciao,      tra l'1 ed il 2 settembre sarò a Loreto per l'incontro col Papa. E' previsto dunque dormire all'aperto con il sacco a pelo.       Ne ho un paio. Uno, davvero buono ma credo forse non adatto, che regge fino a 5° (l'ho usato ad esempio a Colonia, sempre durante una veglia in un pellegrinaggio), ed un altro, più leggerino, dove c'è scritto fuori: " 17° - 19°".      Ho la sensazione che forse dovrei prenderne un altro? non so se la notte a Loreto potrebbe scendere un po' più al di sotto dei 17°.

20090205102008AAuoXUA	Sports;Football (Soccer);Men's Premiere Leagues (UK)	I have a list of Liverpool players that I would like to see leaving this summer. What do you think?	Philipp Degen   Alvaro Arbeloa   Andrea Dossena   Dirk Kuyt   Lucas Leiva   Ryan Babel   David N'Gog         I know a few people will defend some of the above, by saying that they're "alright", but at the end of the day, "alright" doesn't win you Premier League titles. And that's the whole point of transfers isn't it? Replacing players with better ones? It's not like we don't have enough money...we spent stupid amounts on most of the players in that list.      Would you add/take any players to/from that list?
20090202115516AAsq4RC	Sports;Basketball	Who Else Likes Antonio Daniels's Game?	I always liked him he has hops for a 30+ PG and is great to have in a team concept game because he knows how to direct a team and pick his spots on the offense. Where he is a good jump shooter and 3pt shooter. He is not a bad defender either.      Anyways, if you paid attention to him in Washington over the years the team played better when he subbed in for Gilbert Grape. Cause Arenas is a terrible PG for a team concept he does not pass and because Butler and Jamison are not great passers themselves when they are on the floor together the game was stagnant and the other players watched the Big 3 go 1 on 1 and pcik their spots. With Daniels there was a better flow to the game.      Daniels has an NBA ring w/ the Spurs and hopefully now he can assist CP3 in turning the Hornets into perennial contenders he is a better fit in the Big Eazy than what Mike James was.

I think it's safe to assume Bynum will likely be out until the first round of the playoff, maybe more although I do not think he will be out for the whole year again. So Lakers are left with the team that went the Finals last year + a healthy Ariza.      First Q: Are the Lakers capable of beating the Spurs??      2nd Q: Will Gasol be out muscled next week against Celtics & Cavs?      Last Q: Will Bynum be able to pick up the pace he was going before the injury when he returns late in the season or playoff??

People are always posting on here how it's Vince Mcmahons fault for the death of WCW and therefore being the only wrestling company left. However, that was not his fault. WCW was the one who wanted direct competition, they're the ones who legitimately wanted to end the WWE, and all of a sudden it's Vince's fault that he won. Why is that a bad thing? All of a sudden it's a bad thing to do your job and win? Also, it was Ted Turner who turned to Vince to buy his company. Since when? It was WCW's fault. Anyways, even if WCW had been sold to someone else they still would have failed. Why are you all blaming Vince?

It is not thin, but it is dashed?      5) Band from Guelph, Ontario sang this song with a title that means the REAL policeman of the game?      6) English rock band, Uriah Heep, sang a song was titled as an easy way for a center to score?      7) American Idol winner Kelly (same last name as Toronto native on the Devils) sang a song, that is a goaltenders worst nightmare?

20090205094621AA5oitL	Sports;Baseball	What is the blueprint of a baseball lineup? (Example Players)?	I know a good amount of baseball (really football and basketball are my main sports) but when a baseball manager is creating the line up, what does he consider for each slot.   The best answers I was given were      1. high obp+speed and good stolen base %   2. high contact hitter, who can lay down a bunt, good speed, sees a lot of pitches   3. The best hitter on the team with power, high obp + good power numbers, decent speed   4. POWER (RBI's, HRs, Doubles) Usually also plays 1B, DH or OF   5. Usually another power hitter but not as good as #4 who can drive runs in (you don't want this guy to be a easy out, because then no one will ever pitch to you power hitter)   6. A hitter who will at least stroke a fair number of singles and doubles to score the 3-4-5 guys. He'll usually have some pop in the 15-20 homer range.   7. Probably the weaker end of the order; managers will often put rookies in a 7 or 8 spot or maybe a player used more for defense   8. Usually 1st or 2nd worse batter who has low stats but should have a good eye to walk and get on base so the top of the lineup can do damage.   9. Either double leadoff or worst batter. In double leadoff, they have just as good of speed as 1st batter more or less. Can bunt for a base hit and/or slap all around the field for hits. Good contact with low power. As not double leadoff, likely lowest average, hits, stats, gets replaced in 7th to 9th innings (or pitche NL)      Now I wanna know what players in history would make good examples of these attributes of each slot.      for example      1. rickey henderson   2. maybe derek jeter   3.Manny Ramirez   4. Barry bonds   and so on.   (if your a historian of baseball then you can make an all time list if not then just today's players) Thank you
