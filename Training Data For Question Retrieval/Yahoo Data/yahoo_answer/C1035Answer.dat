kitTfJsbaa	CHRIS JERICHO COME BACK?<br>  This was the text in the video and this is what they probably mean <br>  Save_Us.222: I know for a fact I have been seeing signs on RAW that say "Save Us Jericho", maybe WWE picked up on this and ran with it<br>  <br>  - CHAMP_HARD: Jericho was a former WWE Hardcore Champion<br>  <br>  - SMACK_BROUGHT1: Jericho was on SmackDown and on his debut, he brought the "smack" to The Rock. Also, remember back when Jericho interviewed the #1 Draft Pick from SD!, John Cena. Jericho was also brought over from RAW to SmackDown.<br>  <br>  - CD_VOLUME4_1: This might be the most significant clue, as Jericho's theme Break The Walls Down was the first track on the 4th WWE Music CD<br>  <br>  - WM00_MATCH and WM_MATCH_TRI: Jericho wrestled Benoit and Angle in the Triple Threat Match at WM<br>  <br>  - LIVEWIRE: A song by Jericho's band, Fozzy, also an old show, WWE Livewire<br>  <br>  - TALENT_PRE: Obvious, Jericho was a former WWE talent<br>  <br>  - BAT_***_WEEK: A reference to Jericho on VH1's Best Week Ever? Or a clue at Jericho's obvious humor side<br>  <br>  - JVC_FIX: A former WWE sponsor<br>  <br>  - PROMO_99: Jericho's WWE debut came in 1999 and he cut that infamous promo on The Rock<br>  <br>  - 7_OCT: WWE's No Mercy PPV in October<br>  <br>  - RAW_DOUBLE_FIN and RAW_REV: A possible reference to the match against Triple H on RAW which Jericho had won, or so we thought, only to see Triple H void the title change. Also, Jericho and Chyna both won the WWE IC Title on a double pin.<br>  <br>  - KOR_Qualify13_60: Jericho qualified for the King of the Ring twice<br>  <br>  - r/shara/catman/a_man/cat1: A Lionheart reference, maybe<br>  <br>  - share/Insight/library/SGI_bookshelves: Possible reference to Jericho's book<br>  <br>  - RAW_REV_MAY2.action: Jericho defeated Benoit for the WWE IC Title on May 2, 2000<br>  <br>  - BIG_SHOW: This is the only name that means anything that is in the promo, so WWE could have thrown it in there just to confuse the fans. Also, with the above mentioned CHAMP_HARD, Jericho defeated Big Show for the Hardcore title in 2001.<br>  <br>  - RAW_WAR_BUMPER: RAW is WAR was the catchphrase back when Y2J was around, and he often "bumped" the phrase around to say RAW is Jericho<br>  <br>  - DISP_CHAMP: A possible reference to Jericho's reign as WWE Undisputed Champion<br>  <br>  - giga/flame_5.0.7OCT/action: WWE No Mercy starts at 5:00PM on October 7th<br>  <br>  - Also, according to his official website, his book signing tour starts on 10/25, and none of those dates are for Mondays. Also, I'm pretty sure WWE Cyber Sunday is the 222nd WWE PPV, though I could be wrong. I guess it would be possible that the SAVE_US.222 could countdown and change to SAVE_US.22J then end with SAVE_US.Y2J.<br>  <br>  If you listen closely on the video, you will definitley hear a voice whisper "I'm Back" and it also sounds like there may be a "Lionheart" whisper in there as well. The video even counts down from 6 to 1, kind of like his old WWE Y2J debut promo did. If that isn't enough to add speculation to the fire, The Allstate Arena in Chicago. where WWE No Mercy will be held this year, is the same place that Jericho made his original debut with WWE.<br>  <br>  The whole "Save Us" could trace back to when Jericho came to WWE originally, his whole schtick was that he was here to "Save the WWE" and in many of his old promos, he always refers to being a "saviour" and stuff. In another interesting note, WWE Cyber Sunday is being held in Washington, D.C. which is the last place Jericho wrestled a WWE PPV match.<br>  <br>  There's also a slight reference to the Bible verse, Joshua 2, Verse 2 (Joshua 2:2) which is: "The king of Jericho was told, "Look! Some of the Israelites have come here tonight to spy out the land." 3 So the king of Jericho sent this message to Rahab: "Bring out the men who came to you and entered your house, because they have come to spy out the whole land." The Bible verse, Joshua 2, Verse 22 contains no Jericho reference: When they left, they went into the hills and stayed there three days, until the pursuers had searched all along the road and returned without finding them.<br>  <br>  Now I realize that all of these clues and guesses are taking a long shot, and some of them may have been thrown in there by WWE just to fool with the fans. Whether it really does mean Jericho's return or not, Cyber Sunday or No Mercy, it is still a great new angle for WWE to come up with to get the fans excited again after the disappointing "Illegitimate Son" storyline.|`|LnDlhyeHaa	I saw that too...I hope it is Jericho...|`|N9LQG5u3aa	I wonder how WWE will go nuts without Y2J|`|WWwDwM1Kaa	yeah but also keep in mind despite jericho coming back vince  is still in charge and he might keep his same old stuff with jericho,  but lets hope not|`|9XdRD5coaa	Ive heard for ages that Chris Jericho is going to be involved with a twist about McMahons son.<br>  <br>  Where can they go with Hornswoggle being his son...But where can they go with Y2J being his son.<br>  The difference is huge.<br>  <br>  And also it states 0CT7 which is No Mercy PPV in Chicago.<br>  Jericho debuted in Chicago with him stating he would save the WWF ----> SAVE US_222|`|W4xhR9Fcaa	good idea i hope its right|`|k13BwVkDaa	I shure hope that our paragon of virtue, the lion heart, the iotola of rock and rolla, y2k Chris Jericho does return to Raw they need someone with character besides HHH and HBK|`|d71392a8d7aafb5823c7f35357002dd0aa	Naw, the 2:2,2 gives it away on it's own.

WPsje4Foaa	Hi!!!<br>  <br>  Antes todos criticaban a WWE por ser muy predictable, ahora, ya todos no saben, todos desconfían, todos dudan, todos tienen espectativa sobre lo que vaya a pasar o a hacer la empresa, entonces...<br>  <br>  Eso quiere decir que, ?WWE está empezando a hacer bien las cosas? Hell No!!!<br>  <br>  No, porque vamos a analizar esto de una manera más Objetiva, y analizando todo lo que a WWE lo rodea en la actualidad:<br>  <br>  En este mes de Octubre, WWE presenta su evento annual No Mercy, mientras que por el otro lado, TNA (Su Peque?a, pero siempre competencia) presenta el Evento Premiere del a?o, Bound For Glory, y este ultimo evento presenta un evento estelar que muchos queremos ver, desde hace muchos a?os. Mientras que WWE coloca a Esteroides Jones "Batista" vs Inmovible (Literalmente) "The Great Khali", y también como es costumbre desde hace a?os, tendremos en nuestro evento estelar a 5 Movidas McGee "John Cena" derrotando a Randy Orton en un Last Man Standing (Mi predicción).<br>  <br>  Entonces, WWE sigue siendo muy predictable, y ?Por Qué?<br>  - Porque tiene en los eventos estelares a la misma gente desde hace 2 a?os, cosa que hace mas facil ganar dinero, al querer apostarle a Batista o a John Cena.<br>  <br>  Debido a la predictabilidad de los eventos estelares (que son 3), han decidido hacer esta movida, que al parecer esta resultando muy bien, porque muchos comprarán el evento, tan solo por estar a la expectative de ver si Jericho vuelve o no vuelve. Solo por eso.<br>  <br>  Llámesele Marketing desesperado, Llámesele marketing alocado, pero al parecer la cuestion del "Save_us.222" esta dando resultando, porque Incluso Bellatrix esta interesada. Jaja. Just Kiddin'.<br>  <br>  En lo personal si estoy seguro que Chris Jericho es el protagnista del Video, y por lo tanto Chris Jericho estará en No Mercy, y principalmente, para Opacar la Mediocridad de lo que el evento será respecto a la calidad. Pero eso en WWE ya es costumbre.<br>  <br>  Me parece muy bien, porque al menos WWE tiene a Chris Jericho para tanto fan, que esta cansado de Cena/Batista/Mediocridad a través de todos estos meses.<br>  <br>  Por cierto, mis predicciones:<br>  - Gana Batista<br>  - Gana Cena<br>  - Gana Punk<br>  <br>  Gracias.<br>  <br>  Un Saludo!!<br>  C'ya.|`|1B69lqlPaa	Ya habia visto el video pero parece un video estra?o.

SAVE_US.222 es el tema principal del video <br>  Se comenta que durante algunos shows de la WWE, había fans con carteles que decían: “Save Us Jericho” (Jericho acostumbraba decir que había llegado para salvar a la WWE), quizá la WWE tomo inspiración en los carteles <br>  Un verso de la biblia (Jousé 2:2) dice: “El rey de Jericó fue informado….” <br>  Una de las frases que se muestra varias veces dice “cd_volume4_1.act“, en el álbum “WWE The Music: Volume 4“, el track 1 (Break The Walls Down) es el tema de Chris Jericho <br>  La frase “7OCT” también se repite varias veces, el 7 de octubre es la fecha para el próximo PPV de la WWE: No Mercy <br>  Otra de las frases es: CHAMP_HAR, Jericho fue campeón Hardcore de la WWE <br>  PROMO_99: el debut de Jericho en la WWE fue en 1999 <br>  RAW_WAR_BUMPER: RAW is WAR, cuando Jericho debutó, el lema de RAW era RAW is WAR, al micrófono Jericho la cambió por RAW is Jericho <br>  DISP_CHAMP: una posible referencia a que Jericho fue el primer campeón “Indisputado” de la WWE <br>  En el sitio de Jericho, están las fechas para su tour promocionando su libro, y ninguna de ellas es en lunes <br>  La arena Allstate Arena en Chicago, donde se llevará a cabo NoMercy, es el mismo lugar donde Jericho debutó hace 8 a?os <br>  Y por último, no olvidar que el debut de Jericho en la WWE también fué anunciado con un video “misterioso”:

S7bclNcuaa	In CBS Sports line they have the following written.  From what is written I would go with Harrington.<br>  <br>  Marc Bulger (at DAL): The Cowboys secondary has improved since their Week 1 performance against the Giants, but this is more about Bulger than anything else. He has two broken ribs, an injured offensive line and no Steven Jackson (groin). Bulger only has two touchdowns for the season with three interceptions.<br>  <br>  One-week bust: Joey Harrington (vs. HOU). Harrington passed for 361 yards, two touchdowns and no interceptions in Week 3 against Carolina. That's just his second game over 300 yards since 2005. He will not have back-to-back 300-yard outings since he's never done that in his career. He has been sacked 14 times this year, and the Texans are No. 16 in pass defense.|`|y25zmY2Gaa	Bulger all  the way.|`|RkFT7V9Baa	Bulger. BUT! you should drop Harrington for another QB on free agents. Any other starting QB is worth taking right now than these two that you have.|`|10302514907cc7c0aca4f1a0f05393b3aa	I'd still pick Bulger despite the match ups and injuries to his teammates and his ribs.|`|V9Xwp4lIaa	bulger joey harrington sucks|`|fcda8cd616a28ab925477deb6ec52e69aa	Bulger.

( I don't think they'll be a sweep btw) Even if they don't get to the World Series he's gone. I'd like to see them hire Joe Girardi personally. I think Arod will be back next season.

muVyvTnEaa	Dude don't worry about it. Alloy's do dent easily but they will work for at least a season. If they bend then you just have to bend it back into shape and it will not snap.If you want a really durable shaft I would recomend Titanium or carbon composite. All shafts dent and bend, some just a lot easier than others.|`|4iQSHyScaa	Not as reliable as my shaft.|`|oPKhBgK6aa	Alloy shafts are always better than aluminum or Harrow, you could use the shaft for the rest of the season and it would be fine.  When you get a new shaft I would recommend a brine swizzle or a swizzbeat or the old warrior titan classic but the new one is pretty good also.
i0ZHQRVfaa	good point you have here. however, you're missing something. When Gasol was traded to the Lakers, team chemistry wasnt an issue. The Lakers got off to a great start right away and soon thereafter won like 13 games in a row. Bynum however is the questionable one. hes out of shape and hasnt been playing basketball ever since his injury. the question now is, if bynum is cleared to play, should he come back and risk getting reinjured? or should he wait until next year coming back at full strength. With this in mind, i think the lakers will go keep into the playoffs this year. Pau's gelling back into the lineup isnt going to be a problem. lakers need ariza back. luke is useless, and i cant imagine him in the playoffs|`|nz220kO4aa	i think they have decent chance of going deep in the playoffs i think its about how bynum does in the playoff ..and the bench ..i dont think they can get to the finals ...but i believe they can be good as any western conf team when they are healthy ....but next year every team in the NBA will be scared of them .. !|`|34mqQ7Lhaa	Lakers will rape in playoff, we Orlando Cavaliers will win world series!!!|`|6399ff02ed09c90c9d4182100df49ab0aa	you made a very interesting point about the whole chemistry and health thing. gasol and the lakers have chemistry, its just adding bynum with gasol and kobe that worries me. but hopefully once bynum starts playing with kobe and gasol he'll pick up right where he left off in january. if bynum,bryant,gasol clicks together just like gasol did with the lakers the first time he played, then the lakers should make a very strong push down the playoffs.....having two players who are seven footers can bring some headaches to their opponents.|`|90a62262392f687adf7be2cca8687509aa	I HATE THE LAKER'S AND KOBE THEY WILL GET SWEPT 1ST ROUND JUST BECAUSE KOBE IS  BALL HOG AND SO BIG HEADED!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|A01Z5DH7aa	I'd like to think that the Lakers will go deep.  But if they don't, any team but Suns and Spurs are o.k. with me.|`|HT5iRqCsaa	I dont think they have the true rhythm or team chemistry that it takes to get it done in the playoffs. The Celtics will win the championship this season!!!!!|`|LBh5cyqBaa	You are right about what you said. But I still think the Lakers will go deep in the playoffs and I still think that they are the favorites. Kobe, backed by Odom and Fisher and the rest of the bunch will be good enough to get them past round 1. Once round 2 comes along, both Gasol and Bynum should be 100%. Gasol actually should be good to go before the playoffs. The Lakers can definitely get by the first round with Gasol. When Bynum comes back, they should probably play him as a backup center in the beginning to get him back comfortable and not ruin whatever chemistry and rhythm they have developed. By the time the second round comes around, the Lakers should be 100% and ready to make a strong push for the Finals.|`|OJnrXgaDaa	spurs are the best|`|S7y2t2Z3aa	Lakers who?No dont count on them in the playoffs.I admit i hate the lakers, but they are a decent team.Your right ben, Spurs are best.|`|SL6MvE0daa	i think that kobe is good and there team so well i think they will go at lest the third round|`|ZydE0XWNaa	I do see the lakers going all the way this season. I think they one of the best starting lineups in the league and have a bunch of weapons. You have Kobe who can score points and distribute the ball, odom who can rebound and score decent points, gasol and bynum who are dominate down low, and of course fisher who is just a great ballhandler...And you even have that great bench...Farmar, Vujacic, Turiaf|`|qIknHaeGaa	you know if they get healthy the are going to the finals no problem. but as of right now they will probably make it to the western conference finals and lose in 7 games to the NO.<br>  <br>  It doesn't matter who makes it out of the West as long as its not the suns. i have NO RESPECT for that fat *** named shaq and cant wait till they get beat in the playoffs to see who he blames for the losing then.|`|rJ9U0LOKaa	Second round, then they're out.|`|zETdkpiHaa	you know what i dont this this question can be answered. the west is so tight, and this asker is right- every round in the west is going to be like the confrence finals, and to be honest every team has a chance to getting to the finals. could be the lakers, could be the hornets. there is no way to tell. all anyone can say is that this is gonna be one hell of year in the playoffs- one for the history books.

I know you probably can't go buy everything, and that's alright, just do the best with what you got, and try and borrow stuff.<br>  <br>  1) long underwear (not cotton)<br>  2) a waterproof, breathable jacket (your goretex jacket shoudl be fine)<br>  3) possibly a fleece or wool jumper underneath your jacket, for added warmth<br>  4) snow pants, waterproof<br>  5) thick woolen or synthetic socks (1 pair. anymore and you run the risk of restricting circulation to your feet, which ultimately can cause frostbite)<br>  6) a beanie, or even better for a beginner, a helmet.<br>  7) warm, waterproof gloves (bring a spare pair to change into if they get too wet)<br>  8) goggles or sunglasses (both protect your eyes, but goggles keep the wind out)<br>  9) wrist guards. This is a commonly injured part for new boarders.<br>  10) sunscreen. The sun reflects off of the snow and can scorch your face.<br>  11) Impact shorts, or hip pads, or even borrow a friends hockey shorts if you don't mind looking bulky. (for under your pants) They don't look cool but will probably be appreciated for your first day.<br>  <br>  It's imperative that you don't wear cotton.

Lots of falling. You'll be pretty sore haha, but trust me, it's worth it. If you have some sort of padded shorts, called impact shorts, it's definitely a good idea to wear out there. My tailbone hurt bad for a while, I didn't have any of those shorts. Also, something for the pads on your hands, because those will be taking a lot of blunt force blows everytime you fall. And if you have messed up knees, wrap and protect those suckers. For clothing, just dress right for whatever weather you're going to be in. Just remember, you're going to get so hot when you're just learning. It's crazy how hot you can get. So layer appropriately. I would wear as least as you think you can and keep most of your gear in the warming hut or where ever they'll have you put your stuff. It's bad to start sweating bad and then take off all that gear, it chills your body, opening your immune system up for attack, seen it bunches. But anyways, yeah just try not to sweat a ton before taking that gear off. It's a lot of fun to do, so enjoy it =] and good luck!|`|XoTH3zIwaa	well since you're a beginner I'm assuming, then whatever keeps you warm and dry, since you won't look great anyways sliding on your butt down the hill ( no offence everyone starts off their snowboardin career like that )<br>  <br>  yeah gore tex is good ****, Jeremey Jones, Chas Gueldemond, and a few other pro snowboarders endorse it, so do it up ! also warm gloves are essntial for beginners, cause you probaby arent used to the cold on the hill|`|u1dfullSaa	Well usually snowboarders wear waterproof jackets or Warm hoodies, slim snow pants and gloves.<br>  <br>  I don't really know what glortex is aha but hopefully that will answer it |`|pPcAU4Adaa	a snowboard would help you

QC2NozBkaa	If you handle the 12ga you will have no problem with the .270.  My only concern is you mentioning moose hunting.  In my opinion the .270Win is borderline medicine for moose.  It can and has taken many, many moose, elk and big bear.  Just be extra careful of your shot placement.  I'd use a 150gr partion style bullet for the big stuff.<br>  Good hunting!|`|3WTdU7mPaa	No Problem. I've shot a 270 all my life. It's a great all around caliber. I started shooting mine when I was 18. I'm 51 now. The construction of the gun along with the grain of the bullet has a lot to do with how much the gun kicks. A heavy gun will most of the time kick much less than a light gun. What is the make and model of your gun? Synthetic or wood stock? These are all variables in the way the gun kicks.|`|A7GyXCI7aa	The 270 doesn't have that much of a kick to it.<br>  <br>  If you don't have a good shooting technique - then any rifle will pound on you too much................|`|380c69d894ee05a48f1af85c8a4850deaa	A 270 is fine for medium sized game but NOT A LARGE MOOSE! they can get larger than a horse so you should give that some thought.|`|nooi0ldjaa	i shot and killed a deer with a .270 when i was 9 years old, i think you can handle it. really not much kick to it.

aTkPvZQuaa	spot on totally agree............................|`|9d792c6e2da6e5b53a036baec7115b43aa	When it comes down to it the problem lies with the players. The team is full of so called class players but they have just not performed. The loss of Berbatov and Keane was a tremendous blow especially when the management admit that the two strikers they now have cannot play together. Does this mean the team must go into every game with one recognised striker even at home? Modric and Bentley have hardly enhanced their reputations and they will have to have a good hard look at themselves and start performing. There is no way Jol will come back to Spurs after the way they treated him. At least he could speak English!|`|9DbCsmnhaa	Exactly!!! Bringing back Martin Jol would be fantastic; but I don't see him leaving top of the bundesliga for bottom of the prem team whose board treat him like crap!!!|`|d88c64fba653794e23272678624d43a3aa	Couldnt put it better myself!
aTkPvZQuaa	hoping he will be fit for both........................|`|uUitKmJMaa	cause thats the only competition spurs are like in, cause there league chances is gone, there out of the carling cup, cause they have liverpool in the carling cup next...and we all know whos going to win that.<br>  if they are not allready knocked out of the fa cup they prob will b soon|`|HGnk5bfgaa	It doesnt make any sense 2 me either but we dont know whats going on. Spurs wont go down and they will get into the next round of uafa cup with 3 teams going through but wont win it. Maybe Ramos is waiting for uafa cup 2 end before christmas to focus on the league who knows.|`|GpqJQT5Caa	God knows. Ramos wont be at the club for the UEFA cup matches if he keeps it up.
XLaiS6n0aa	I think Tendulkar will hold the mantle of greatest for a long time.  He invokes passion, and ahs been seen as the centre of the team for so long.|`|AA11088802	tendulkar|`|f9hiPMDxaa	They have had some greats. Gavaskar, Pataudi, Tendulkar, Bishen Bedi, Eripali Prasana. I wouldn't like to choose from them, they are all great.|`|cOm8LQ1Daa	Tendulkar - There is no one like him in the whole cricketing world! Master of Recordsssss! He is the best all-time cricketer in the world! It's not easy to achieve wat Tendulkar has achieved - simply the Best!

There is class written over his each and every shot.|`|qKDBml4Jaa	Ranjitsinhji, the first and still greatest batsman India has ever produced. He revolutionised the way batsmen played, previously the game had been an off-side one and cricketers apolgised to bowlers if they hit the ball into the leg side, Ranji changed all that and with great wristwork introduced the leg glance (a stroke some deemed immoral) to the game.<br>  <br>  His Test batting average of 45 is worth far more in another era. He scored a century on Test debut and another on his overseas debut, Wisden described the former innings thusly: "playing an innings that could, without exaggeration, be fairly described as marvellous. He very quickly got set again, and punished the Australian bowlers in a style that, up to that period of the season, no other English batsman had approached. He repeatedly brought off his wonderful strokes on the leg side, and for a while had the Australian bowlers quite at his mercy....The innings came to an end for 305, Ranjitsinhji carrying his bat for 154. It is safe to say that a finer of more finished display had never been seen on a great occasion, for he never gave anything like a chance."|`|PNla3BW5aa	tendulkar|`|Jqs7pH8baa	Kapil Dev for his ability to bat and bowl.on Par with Hadlee and Botham
RGxMkT0zaa	I think the fab 4 are playing on and ruining their averages. They are behaving like gamblers, who think one day they will win and recover everything. Tendulkar is not performing in his tension of going past Brian Lara.<br>  Kumble has an injury  and not performing as a bowler.<br>  Dravid and Laxman just batting average.<br>  <br>  Much though I like them all and think they should retire at their own pace, I think they should gradually bow out. This way they will face less criticism.<br>  They will leave a great vacuum.<br>  India will surely miss them.|`|M8XmhqIhaa	I think its time for Kumble. He has been a legendary bowler and one of the greatest bowlers of all time. He has been around for a while and has served Indian cricket really well.|`|AA11088802	Kumble|`|8FUAMccRaa	on current form-Kumble but Dravid hasnt been in good form for over a year so its out of those two. Depends on how they play through out the series|`|e7f9613d5b480e9758d037bfe66ac6b9aa	kumble|`|wz8gx3gaaa	I think no one should go from Fab-4.  Even Ganguly should remain in the team.|`|fHqhqFO4aa	Dravid, Laxman and Kumble are already being disregarded from the ODI side since quite a while now. Tendulkar, despite missing matches due to injury, has been in the side consistently and has been scoring. He was essential in the CB Series earlier this year against Australia. After Ganguly if any player should go it should be from either Dravid, Laxman or Kumble. As per current form, it seems Kumble should be the one to go. He has been quite ineffective for the past series against SL and even in the first test against the Aussies. His captaincy has been patchy and perhaps after the end of this series, captaincy should be handed over to Dhoni. Although I still respect Kumble for his immense talent and his great personality, as per current form, he isn't contributing much.|`|VGeODn1Naa	In the 1st place Ganguly has done nothing for which he deserves to go. He chose to go on his own, because he is no longer prepared to take anymore insults. After him, no one should go, because they all DESERVE  to be in the team, and they wouldn't call it a day like Dada either, because I'm sure that no other Indian cricketer would have to put up with so  much humiliation. <br>  <br>  |`|juyXgHfkaa	No disrespect for any legend of Indian cricket but I think Kumble and Laxman should take retirement.|`|OccsxsbVaa	I Think Its Time For all to go......................<br>  Both Of them have played well enough and its now time to them to leave thier ways to youngsters.................................<br>      They should Guide the youngsters.............|`|k1GTHfToaa	POOR PERFORMER.<br>  <br>  Even MSDhoni also.<br>  <br>  If any body not performing well he should go out.|`|Kf7P3QuPaa	I think  kumble 
AA11088802	He has strange look. but a real good bowler.|`|M8XmhqIhaa	He has shown very promising signs and he's only 20 years of age! With a little more experience, I think he can be one of the greatest pace bowlers the game has ever seen!|`|1uLfl0sXaa	He has looks. Whether he'll last can only be speculation. I don't think Sree santh is finished.<br>  For now, Ishant is doing a fine job.|`|AA11599788	Naveen says Ishant bowls at 145 KMs per second ??? Hahaha. |`|oRIWyTZxaa	He is a promising youngster for Indian pace attack|`|e7f9613d5b480e9758d037bfe66ac6b9aa	he would look smarter with short hair|`|KIP15uNKaa	Ishant looks smart. He has a lot of hand power too. He can bowl upto 145k/second. He bowls well especially against Australians.He gets a lot of swing too. I am sure that he will be in the Indian team till his retirement.|`|a5KP4vocaa	ishant will be good, he won't dip like irfan did.  irfan was a swing bowler, he lost his swing and became mediocre.  ishant is a full pace bowler, he'll be airite.  |`|ts179E50aa	He has the potential to be Indias greatest fast bowler, and also one of the worlds best but he needs a haircut.|`|XLaiS6n0aa	I reckon Sharma has the goods to alst a while in Cricket, he ahs pace and a good bit of movement.

M8XmhqIhaa	Thats for him to decide. Personally, I don't think he will retire. He still has a long way to go and is still a fantastic cricketer.|`|AA11088802	No|`|uKLlkOPSaa	According to his poor performance - I think its better for him to take retirement|`|wPlfPc0gaa	I think, he is still playing good. And if he feels it is time bid adieu to cricket, he will do it.|`|fAOoVacxaa	I Think Yes |`|e7f9613d5b480e9758d037bfe66ac6b9aa	no|`|fbdb40d72758d295a4739ba1c80cfd0daa	no, he is not ready to retire, anyway if he annonces his retirement no one will be suprised, he has no mass following like tendulkar or dada,<br>  <br>  dravid and kumble also can go without any fuss|`|ZLymgyP6aa	No, not even anytime soon. Ganguly is retiring after this series. Next in line seems to be Kumble, not Laxman!|`|vljKVh33aa	India need him as well as Tendulker, Kumble and Dravid to retire they are playing past their prime.|`|VCHCanJnaa	Hope so he has lost his touch as has<br>  Ganguly<br>  Tendulkar<br>  Laxman<br>  Sewag<br>  all to old|`|6fd54ca5b94118bd8674efe6463e71e3aa	It is early to predict.|`|Kf7P3QuPaa	I don't think so

I movimenti di questo stile sono morbidi ed eleganti, alternati a forti contrazioni muscolari; le posizioni si mantengono tendenzialmente alte.<br>  <br>  nale del giappone. Sankukai  [modifica]<br>  Il Maestro Y. Nanbu nasce a Kobe in Giappone nel febbraio 1943. Appartiene ad una vecchia famiglia di judoka. Il nonno era un lottatore di Sumo molto famoso; suo padre (5° dan), teneva corsi di judo al Dojo della polizia della città di Kobe. Sotto la direttiva del padre, il maestro Nanbu cominciò a praticare il judo a soli cinque anni. Quando entrò nella scuola comunale, imparò il Kendo sotto la guida di suo zio. Negli anni cinquanta, sia il Karate che l'Aikido erano vietati (infatti il generale Mac Artur, comandante delle forze d’occupazione degli Stati Uniti in Giappone, aveva proibito la pratica di queste due discipline) così Nanbu dovette cominciare a praticare queste arti sotto la direzione del maestro Someka, che era direttore di un club "amichevole". Egli cominciò a leggere con avidità i libri di suo padre su tutte le arti marziali: Tonfa, Nuntchaku, Tambo, Sai, eccetera, cui si dedicò ben presto nei Dojo del vicinato. A diciotto anni il maestro Nanbu entrò nella facoltà di Scienze Economiche di Osaka, dove ebbe come maestro Tani, 8° dan, che professava lo Shito-Ryu. Fu ben presto promosso capitano della squadra di Karate della sua università, titolo questo che ha molto valore, data l'importanza dei karateka universitari giapponesi. Nel 1963 divenne campione universitario del Giappone (c'erano allora 1250 concorrenti). Per questa vittoria Yoshinao Nanbu ricevette ufficialmente la "medaglia al valore" (mandata da tutti i Karateka giapponesi) dalle mani del direttore dell'università di Waseda, Ohama, promotore dell'organizzazione dell'Associazione degli studenti dell’università. Nel 1964 ricevette l'invito da PLEE, allora promotore del Karate in Francia, a partecipare come invitato alla coppa di Francia; la vinse combattendo individualmente. Partecipò anche alla coppa internazionale di Cannes (sette Paesi; Gran Bretagna, Germania, Italia, Norvegia, Stati Uniti, Svizzera e Francia), e vinse anche qui il combattimento individuale. Da questo momento il maestro Nanbu cominciò a considerare la sua arte come una professione, e così di conseguenza modificò i suoi programmi. Nel 1968 andò a trovare tutti i maestri giapponesi, invitandoli l'uno dopo l'altro, per imparare tutti i tipi di tecniche; ufficialmente però si trovava ancora sotto le direttive del maestro Tani e cioè del SHUKOKAI-SHITO-RYU. Lo stesso anno, proprio su richiesta del maestro Tani (che diceva di lui che aveva il genio del Karate), Nanbu si diede da fare per mettere in piedi l'organizzazione mondiale di Shukokai. La sua riunione ebbe successo grazie alle numerose dimostrazioni da lui date in parecchi Paesi, come la Scozia, la Gran Bretagna, la Francia, la Norvegia, la Germania, l'Italia, il Belgio e la Jugoslavia. Aprì in seguito dei "club Nanbu" a Parigi e in provincia, e divenne allenatore della squadra francese. (I suoi nuovi allievi da quel momento cominciarono a vincere i campionati di Francia e d'Europa). In seguito ai suoi duri sforzi per promuovere il Shukokai, il maestro Nanbu venne nominato presidente della federazione scozzese di karate, consigliere e direttore tecnico della federazione belga di karate, presidente della federazione norvegese di karate, consigliere e direttore tecnico della squadra di Karate Jugoslava. Nel 1969 il maestro Nanbu giunse per la prima volta in Canada, per salutare dei suoi discepoli; e lo stesso anno il maestro Tani gli propose di occuparsi dell'organizzazione del terzo campionato del mondo di Karate che avrebbe avuto luogo a Parigi nel mese di ottobre. Il giorno dopo il campionato, il maestro Nanbu ruppe definitivamente con lo stile Shukokai, poiché si era accorto che, essendo uno stile essenzialmente competitivo, i suoi seguaci finivano per praticare solamente le tecniche più redditizie per la competizione, e, cioè lo Tsuki (pugno diretto) e il Mae-Geri (calcio frontale), lasciando da parte le altre tecniche come il Yoko-Geri (calcio laterale) e il Mawashi-Geri (calcio circolare) più difficili da applicare durante la gara. Questo modo di combattere era divenuto cosi rigido e schematico che un esperto di Shukokai poté un giorno dire: "Questo metodo, in sé eccellente purtroppo non ha saputo fare altro che fabbricare handicappati". Cosciente dei limiti del Shukokai, il maestro Nanbu riparti per il Giappone, e dopo lunghi mesi di riflessione e di meditazione trovò la soluzione dei suoi problemi, fondando la sua tecnica personale, che chiamò SANKUKAI. Quando il Sankukai prese la sua fisionomia definitiva, il maestro Nanbu sottopose le sue conclusioni a un istituto riconosciuto ufficialmente, che ne studio i rapporti di forza e la dinamica dell'energia. La conclusioni che gli esperti trassero furono ottime; infatti essi approvarono la nuova tecnica, poiché questa mostrava chiaramente che si potevano migliorare in maniera considerevole:<br>  <br>  <br>  Lo stile Shotokan di discendenza da entrambe le aree di influenza del karate (Shorei e Shorin), fu creato e diffuso da allievi del maestro Gichin Funakoshi, allievo diretto di Azato e Itosu. Dopo il 1922, data di presentazione in Giappone della sua arte, Funakoshi insegnò karate spostandosi da un dojo all'altro; una prima sede fissa venne creata nel marzo del 1938, quando Funakoshi aveva già settant'anni; fu lui ad affiggere al dojo l'insegna con la scritta Shotokan (da kan, casa e shoto, pseudonimo con cui il maestro soleva firmare poesie e opere di calligrafia).<br>  Il dojo Shotokan rimase il centro dell'insegnamento del karate di Funakoshi anche quando ne cedette la direzione al suo terzo figlio, Yoshitaka il quale ebbe una parte importante nella diffusione dello Shotokan; egli apportò alcune modifiche nell'insegnamento, introdusse l'esercizio del combattimento libero elaborandone tecniche e strategie e ricercò maggiore ampiezza e dinamismo nell'esecuzione delle tecniche, sempre finalizzate alla massima efficacia, ed introdusse tecniche molto importanti come i calci alti, tutti i calci circolari (mawashi geri, ura mawashi geri, ushiro ura mawashi geri), ed il calcio laterale alto (yoko geri)<br>  <br>  Tra le critiche che spesso vengono mosse sullo Shotokan, c'è quella della fermezza dei combattenti durante il kumite. Questa diceria è dovuta al figlio di Funakoshi, che essendo malato di tubercolosi volle creare uno stile inconfondibile, per cui addestrò dei combattenti con un allenamento specifico per aumentarne la massa muscolare, a tal punto che potevano star fermi durante il kumite poiché la loro mole bastava di per se a parare i colpi. Oggi non è più cosi, e i "saltelli" tipo pugile sono entrati nel repertorio di qualsiasi karateka shotokan, e sono consigliati da tutti i maestri.<br>  <br>  <br>  Esistono poi al giorno d'oggi anche molte scuole che hanno ripreso a praticare lo shotokan full contact, spesso però con un nome diverso dello stile.<br>  <br>  Il dojo di Wado-Ryu, venne fondato nel 1937/1938 da uno dei primi e piu validi allievi di Funakoshi, il maestro Hironori Otsuka, egli creò lo stile Wado Ryu; e fu il primo maestro fondatore di uno stile ad essere originario del Giappone. Nato nel 1892 a Ibaragi, vicino a Tokyo, cominciò in tenera età la pratica del jujitsu, continuandola per 17 anni, sino al suo primo approccio con il karate. Divenne allievo di Gichin Funakoshi rimanendo a lungo con lui, prima di codificare, consigliato dallo stesso, un nuovo stile: il Wado ryu, Via della pace, il quale assomma influenze di jujitsu, Shito Ryu, Shotokan e dell'aikido, di cui conosce e frequenta il fondatore Morihei Ueshiba, presentando rotazioni spostamenti laterali e movimenti molto veloci che lo rendono particolarmente adatto al combattimento (Kumite). Affida ai suoi primi allievi, i maestri Yamashita, Kono, Suzuki, Toyama (in Italia) e Mochizuki di trasmettere e divulgare lo stile Wado Ryu in Europa.<br>  Il Wado-Ryu, è oggi diviso sotto due linee di pensiero: Il Wado-Ryu e il Wado Kay.<br>  <br>  Il Wado Ryu, pone come figura principale Hironori (Jiro) Otsuka II (X Dan), il figlio del fondatore dello stile che segue le fila indirizzategli dal Soke stesso (suo padre). Nel vasto territorio mondiale, egli ha posto come caposcuola europeo il maestro Masafumi Shomitsu IX Dan Hanshi fondatore della Wado Academy. <br>  Il Wado Kai è stata fondata dal M° Hironori Otsuka in persona, per divulgare il Wado Ryu nel mondo, ora è gestita da uno dei più abili allievi del fondatore: Il maestro Tatsuo Suzuki (IX Dan). Che modificò la linea indicatagli da Otsuka, ed introdusse gli Ohio Kumite. Suzuki portò il Karate Wado Ryu dapprima in Inghilterra, poi nel resto dell'Europa e negli Usa. Sicuramente la sua bravura e qualifica non ereditata ma acquisita lo pone come uno dei maestri storici di questo stile. <br>  La diatriba che portò alla scissione tra Wado Ryu e Wado Kay, è da attribuire al fatto che i maestri dell'associazione Wado Kay (che in passato faceva parte, come associazione, del Wado Ryu, e che solo da 30 anni è di fatti uno stile) chiedevano a torto o a ragione un'autonomia che il M° Otsuka I non voleva concedergli. La situazione si tradusse in un processo, nel quale vi fu la separazione legale dei due stili. L'accademia Wado Ryu Karate do Jujitsu Kempo Italia (AWKJI), è la federazione italiana che più tiene alle tradizioni del karate stile Wado Ryu, anche agonisticamente, i cui karate|`|9cNH0xxcaa	Precisazioni : <br>  <br>  - Shotokai non è uno stile. E' un' organizzazione.<br>  <br>  - I " saltelli " nel Kumite non sono nel repertorio di qualsiasi     atleta e non sono una prerogativa del Karate Shotokan Tradizionale. La " Mobilità ", e l' atteggiamento durante un Kumite (non necessariamente sportivo) sono una cosa diversa e strettamente soggettiva, anche in base all' esperienza. Rigidità e staticità non appartengono al Karate   Shotokan che è sempre morbido nell' approccio, nella guardia e nella postura, e duro nel momento finale della tecnica.|`|DglBFUsqaa	bo|`|Mq9yQmhtaa	again.....il "migliore" e il nemico del "buono".....regola prima di ogni AM.|`|R5SKifh2aa	in molti punti è veloce ed efficace il kokusan ryu della F.E.K.D.A e abastanza completo,ma trovo migliore il wado ryu<br>  cmq ci sono altri famosi stili come lo shotokan altrettanto efficaci e belli<br>  ciao|`|iRc2Ribcaa	Vari sono i stili del karate, tra qui alcuni tradizionali altri nati attualmente!!!Cmq dipende xke lo vuoi praticare: x la difesa,... in versione sportiva?!secondo me ti dovresti informare(facendo ricerche) e poi scegliere xke qualunque sceglierai x te sarà il migliore in confronto agli altri!!!fidati lo fatto anke io;)|`|uhB7Nk91aa	secondo me il migliore è il shotokan|`|wxB6Ynqeaa	ekko qui ----><a href="http://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shotokan#Shotokan" rel="nofollow">http://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shotokan#Sh...</a><br>  il mio stile preferito è lo shotokan (cm s vede ank dl mio nick)!!!!!!!...lo pratiko da 8 anni e mi piace davvero MOLTISSIMO|`|DS3PUHeNaa	si dice karate.. il migliore? secondo me non ce ne sono! è tutto collegato!

N0KFPcy3aa	You can go on my page and see how I feel as a Twins fan..I feel the exact same way just look at some of my questions|`|SEOg9S2Raa	No offense but nobody cares about the Sox or Twins. I live in Chicago and I will tell you that nobody goes to White Sox games and the media loves the Cubs because fans support them win or lose. When talking about the four game series between the two top teams in the NL it is a huge series regarding the standings but the atmosphere is so electric (Milwaukee is an hour drive from Chicago). The fans are split 50/50 when it comes to the Cubs playing at Miller park because Cubs fans are everywhere.<br>  <br>  All in all lets just be happy they are not talking about the Yankees/ Red sox. Cause that makes me sick to my stomach!|`|l75KGFMbaa	For some misterious reason the Cubs have more fans around the nation. When the Cubs are on the road many local fans are rooting for them. Last night it seemed like 50% of attendance in Miller Park were Cubs fans. They are also a recognized team abroad. ESPN needs big ratings nation and worldwide in each game they broadcast.|`|8uFtBGuZaa	i was wondering the same thing, on each show that was the main story and i was like.....why??<br>  <br>  theres white sox vs. twins going on<br>  mets vs marlins<br>  <br>  it was a good game but i think they overreacted b/c they have nothing else to talk about but brett favre|`|JmZ8xpkXaa	I haven't seen the bias myself. I follow all division races and I have to say that the AL Central has been hyped all year.|`|il2vAkqnaa	according to espn<br>  <br>  cubs>white sox|`|s5kxHAfqaa	Cubs- Zambrano<br>  MIL- Sheets<br>  <br>  And they are better than the Sox and Twins|`|V430UrvFaa	The Cubs- Brewers is considered a marquee matchup for ESPN rather than the MIN- CWS game.|`|aUyopOWiaa	I've been wondering the same thing. This series has 1st place in the AL Central up for grabs.|`|tq5vKKWzaa	ESPN somewhat assumed that the Cubbies and Brew-crew would duke it out in the NL. They don't want to be proven wrong in the AL so they keep hush-hush about it. Plus, the Cubs and Brewers have more a "star" quality about them, whereas the Twins are no-name players tearing it up and the White Sox have a lineup filled with players most assumed were washed up (but have proven otherwise)|`|rwQCRQDJaa	Because the Cubs have a huge fan base and the Brewers are a great team. Both have a chance to go deep into the playoffs. With the Red Sox, Rays, Angels, and Yankees all playing great ball in the American League, no one cares about the White Sox and Twins.|`|a0223cb90091117bae34fe4ba8dec364aa	I agree. I hate how ESPN pulls that crap.<br>  <br>  And to that moron Joseph, I live in Chicago too and plenty of people support the White Sox and go to games there. Don't be jealous because we have won a WS in the last 100 years!!|`|ZyfYh4vdaa	ha yeah i no they always do that with that divison

HVPQYxTkaa	The best tournaments have a few things in common. If you want a celebrity to be a part of it, do these things then just ask one. You need a good cause, good food, and good prizes. Having a good cause will get you the food and prizes donated. Charge for the privilege to play in the event and give generously to the cause from the proceeds. The first couple of years will be tough, but once you get a regular group to play you can expand your influence. Then just ask a celebrity. They love a good cause and will most of the time do it just for that. |`|m0muVAXfaa	Start by talking to a seasoned PGA pro, tell him/her what you would like to do. They can give you the best advice at the ground level. It is a lot of work and you will need help. Good luck.|`|d0PFbP3Taa	You would have to be encouraged by the local PGA to get club pros involved and then many radio and TV stations to publicize the event to get celebrities involved. Many have demands on their time which often make participation impossible. However, charity affairs like the ones preceding the GHO in Cromwell, CT or the Celebrity Golf prior to the Vince Gill outing require rather hefty entry fees . See what is required, who will support your endeavor and the best wishes for success.|`|QyVKiiHvaa	I'm guessing you are a celebrity yourself, maybe doing two shows a night at the Sands three on the weekends. Contact some of your celebrity friends, see if they would like to hang out for a weekend in the desert playing golf.<br>  <br>  Have fun.

PC8YiooHaa	Hace unos a?os era en especialista en pelota parada; sabia contener y cubrir muy bien la pelota en el medio campo, metia pases impresionantes y manejaba muy bien los tiempos. Incluso hasta el a?o pasado jugo muy bien en Boca. Pero ya cumplio su ciclo, estando mal fisica o animicamente no hace nada. Ultimamente se duerme mucho, no es desequilibrante, entorpece el juego, y no marca diferencias. Hace un monton que no lo veo patear al arco (siendo que un enganche debe hacerlo). No se asocia mucho con Messi Tevez o Aguero que son indisctutidos en la seleccion sobre todo el primero mencionado. Argentina necesita un juego mas rapido y dinamico con mas espontaniedad, ya que contamos con jugadores para hacerlo, con buen pie, gambeta, velocidad. Messi se asocia muy bien con Dimaria por ejemplo. Si te pones a analizar cuando perdemos en la seleccion te das cuenta que es porque Messi juega de delantero con un solo punta y Riquelme esta 40 metros mas atrasado. A quie voy con esto? A que Riquelme muchas veces le quita las posibilidades a Argentina de ganar, cero factor sopresa con el. Te frena los contraatques.<br>  Ha sido un  buen  jugador, pone unos pases impresionantes. Pero hoy en dia Messi da muchisimas asitencias y es un jugador mas completo. No es bueno ser Riquelme dependiente. Veremos como juega hoy dia la seleccion sin el. |`|FBWDdIxAaa	No es un jugador diferente como muchos quieren hacer creer. Es un jugador común que tiene dìas buenos y días malos, no brilla en la cancha y es demasiado lento. A mi entender, el jugador por excelencia es el que entra en la cancha y convierte goles o asiste para que lo haga el resto del equipo. Riquelme es un buen jugador pero no es un crack.|`|odudxYIoaa	anda jugá vos seguramente lo haces mejor no?? dejense de joder con roman, a lo mejor no esta en el nivel de antes, pero no deja de ser un gran jugador con una excelente pegada, tecnica, etc....|`|LxqZbQZQaa	hoy contra chile riquelme la rompe... |`|hpPZ4SOnaa	reitero lo dicho en otras preguntas: antes que deleitarme con 30 min de fútbol de Riquelme, por mas minutos no juega por falta de estado, prefiero ver jugar al 10 de YUPANQUI que seguramente se va a descoser el cu... jugando o haciendo el intento por lo menos durante los 90 min. Dejemonos de fanatismos, jugadores sobran, dejemos a este tipo de estrellas para los 90 min de la playStation.<br>  Mi humilde respuesta con toda sinceridad.|`|5edFUutIaa	No merecía ser convocado porque estaba jugando muy mal pero ya ven que el Coco lo conciente y lo convocó igual, de todas maneras acertó al hacerlo porque se puso las pilas para jugar el sábado, personalmente creo que es un gran jugador y es excelente pero tiene una desventaja muy grande y es que aveces juega muy pero muy desganado y eso no me gusta.

b7JS16dyaa	I find it weird how WWE likes to waste good overall talent. They should move him to ECW and let him shine without his comedic character holding his credibily down. If they don't, he could get released soon. If they do, he could be a great performer and work with the newer talent, and when he's ready, move him back to Smackdown. I could totally see him in the U.S. picture with Shelton, MVP, Hurricane Helms, R-Truth, etc.|`|IMu3wBu8aa	Charlie hasn't been getting any air time. I wish he would be on weekly because he's sooo great. He is beyond underrated and isn't used properly. I want him to turn heel and have a more serious gimmick.

KIOR56r6aa	I knew this question would come sooner or later. And I think the answer is because you're Shawn Michaels' number one fans. You feel that you're emotionally attached to him, that's why. But that's a good thing, that shows us that you're a true fans, not some stereotypical fan girl who support cause of looks. And I'm sure it's only a matter of time before u start rooting and campaigning for Shawn Michaels to defeat The Undertaker at Wrestlemania 25 (LOL).<br>  <br>  Losing always bothering people, that's just how it is. It's normal. And if u ask me if I'm worried about HBK losing at Mania, the answer is no. Simply because I'm The Undertaker number two fans, second only to Hannah Hardy.<br>  <br>  BQ : The Legendary Deadman|`|xKXu0Qb2aa	Like I Said - It's Because Shawn is Your Hero , Your Idol , Your All Time Favorite & You Bond with Him Way better than 'Taker. You Said that Yourself. You have a Connection with Him Closer than Any Other Performer. He Means Everything as a Performer in the Business to You.<br>  <br>  RR - No. Because I saw it Coming. I Knew Shawn wasn't Winning for a 3rd time , & with 'Taker being #30 , it was Pretty Obvious.<br>  <br>  WM25 - Again , No. Because I know what's gonna Happen. As Everyone Should. Shawn is gonna Lose & Put "The Streak" Over Yet Again. He'll put up a "Valiant Effort" & Make it Seem as Though He'll be "The One" , Just like Everyone Else has - but Ultimately be Tombstone Piledrivered for the 1-2-3.<br>  It Worries Me Not , because I Know Shawn isn't Worried or Bothered by it Himself.<br>  <br>  <br>  BQ - As a Performer: Shawn.

The thing that really bother me was Shawn lost to Jeff hardy in a clean one-on-one match.At least Taker's a legend, but come on, it's jeff hardy for godsake. Taker got good mic skill(ABA gimmick), great wrestling skills and is a respected veteran. Jeff hardy, bad mic skill, mediocre wrestling skill and not very well respected (drug and quit histories). <br>  <br>  I'm not being rude to jeff but it's just my opinion. Look at HHH. He defeated Jeff in every title matches and proved his superiority(or backstage influence), but Shawn losing to Jeff just proved how much or little respect left by WWE to HBK. <br>  <br>  I'm more bothered in HBK loses to Jeff more than to Taker.|`|tPFikOY7aa	I'm glad someone feels somewhat like me. I'd be very angry (and im bracing for it) if shawn loses. I love Shawn as well and he has been so good to the wwe for having to lose many memorable matches. I feel wwe owe him a big win cause he has been on the wrong end of many wrestlemania classics. I don't hate taker but shawn is given an unfair run with big matches and winning titles. He hasnt been champ for like 5 or 6 yrs.|`|b7JS16dyaa	I think it slightly bothered some people (like me) because in our eyes, they're pretty much even, and the biggest legends currently in the WWE. Seeing one win over the other is kind of weird, but who cares about scripted wins. Shawn and Taker don't care, why should we? Scripted wins can't hurt either of their legacies now, unless they lose to Funaki or something. Just enjoy the fact that they're both still competing, when they don't actually have to anymore.<br>  <br>  BQ: I love both, but I prefer Shawn because of his charisma and entertaining moments over the years.<br>  <br>  <br>  P.S. Couldn't you just use the other questions you made for this? =P

kqP7GwOcaa	I think the most over rated fighter of the past century is Joe Calzaghe.  As shamelessly protected as the early Mike Tyson media creation, but without any real career risks later, or possibly ever, his whole career has been contrived to create a work of fiction.  I consider Joe at best mediocre.<br>  <br>  Mike Tyson is the most over rated fighter in the history of the sport of boxing, out right, bar none.  But at least Mike eventually took career risks, albeit tragically because of the untimely deaths of his early support group, and fought outside the protection of his original handler's due to Don King's encroachment.  King's influence exposed the simple fact that Mike was even less a talent than Joe Calzage, a historically minor talent that enjoyed the best support in the history of boxing.<br>  <br>  There are no other fighters in history as over rated as these two below average fighters, and their success is a tribute to their respective handlers.|`|R5G9h2ygaa	People actually thought that the shadow of Roy Jones was going to beat Calzaghe, some people refuse to lose faith in him.<br>  Im an aussie but ill say a few question marks should hang over Vic Darchinyan as he strangly didnt have the power to stop Arce<br>  Up and comers ill throw in include James Kirkland, many people think he is ready to become the top junior middleweight but he scores knockouts under a barrage of punches which he would not be able to do against the defenses of Williams and other top guys, he takes too many shots to beat them on points as well.<br>  I dont know if it still stands but Andre Berto looked awful against Collazo after some people thought he'd have a chance against the likes of Cotto.<br>  Julio Cesar Chavez jr is very well managed and promoted and i think he will be kept away from the top middleweights/junior middleweights for as long as possible, though he is still young.<br>  Chad Dawson - best p4p he isnt. Not accurate or busy enough to trouble Calzaghe while Hopkins would just cherry pick against him.<br>  David Haye - had no strategy against Monte Barrett, basically went punch for punch and will get destroyed by a Klitschko if he doesnt employ a strategy|`|dh48AkbCaa	edwin valero, who as yet has no defense and needs a heep of seasoning if the is to stay champ.|`|ehQ2XTGxaa	Mike tyson.|`|bqrLJeceaa	Miguel Cotto and you will find out why in his next fight|`|ZpShIvylaa	Chad Dawson is the most overrated fighter. They would talk about how much speed and power he has. He almost got KO'd by Glen Johnson, who was robbed in that fight.|`|I1w0HfQbaa	Chris John is my pick. Yes, he is 42-0 but with the exception of the big win over Juan Manuel Marquez in 2006 he has been mostly fighting a good chunk of stiffs for the duration of his career. Since his career defining win he has been in it with a string of club-fighters until stepping up his game and winning a decision over Hiroyuki Enoki and then getting a draw against Rocky Juarez. He is overrated because although WBA featherweight champion since 2003 he has fought maybe two or three good names since he won the title. The funny thing is, he seems like a very good boxer but needs to step up his level of competition.
dh48AkbCaa	quarry beat ron lyle and ernie shavers, as well as patterson, and fought frazier & ali twice each.<br>  <br>  apparently, george foreman later admitted he ducked quarry in the '70s, especially after jerry beat lyle, so 9 times out of 10, he beats todays crop of cruiserweights, including haye.|`|AA12325046	First of all I must address Jordan S.  Sir if you don't like fantasy fights etc. don't answer them.  As far as I'm concerned, I like them.<br>  <br>  Jerry Quarry was a smaller heavyweight with good boxing skills and good punching power.  He beat men such as Ron Lyle, Floyd Patterson, Mac Foster, and Earnie Shavers to name a few and went toe to toe with Frazier for 7 rounds in one of the most exciting fights ever!  He lost to Ali as Ali was just too fast for him as he was for just about everyone.  In a lot of era he would have ben heavyweight champ and if there had of been a cruiser division back then, he would have been champ.  Against the guys you mentioned, none of them fought nearly as high a level of competition as did Jerry and none had the skill or power of him either.  Jerry would have stopped Adamsek in 8-9 rounds, would have stopped Cunningham in about the same amount of time and had a little harder fight with Haye, but would have either knocked him out late or won the decision.|`|bIbyAkHPaa	Quarry would whip the piss out of the whole lot of them.|`|Ghiy6Cwlaa	he would be champ til someone worth wild comes around|`|kqP7GwOcaa	I think Quarry would probably KO all three.  David Haye is in my opinion the best of the three, and might have been able to escape with a decision loss to Quarry, but Adamek and Cunningham would get KOed by Jerry.  I don't think any of them would have beaten Jerry.  <br>  <br>  Great question.

rC6RD8Wcaa	I think all of those players are some of the most talented players in the league the only one that i hold in question is Julius Peppers in the 3-4 scheme being a 3-4 linebacker isn't something that just anybody can do and i dont know why he wants to stray away from being the beast of a 4-3 end that he is because there is no guarantee that just because you are a good athlete you can play 3-4 outside linebacker (example Vernon Gholston is a very good athlete but did not do so hot as a 3-4 outside linebacker)<br>  <br>  T.O. is still a good player even though he is always in the news but i truly believe that this guy is not what the media perceives him to be..still though he is an outstanding player and would probably be an even better one if he was a better team mate and the media dint ride him so much<br>  <br>  Chad Johnson brings the attention to himself with all the guarantees and the TD celebrations...he is a very good football player that had a down year last year for whatever reason look for it to get harder for him without TJ there to complement him (unless they find someone else) and i think if he dint bring so much attention on himself then the pressure wouldn't be so much to produce...when you guarantee something and you don't come through you look like a fool and thats in his mind every time he drops a pass<br>  <br>  Mike Peterson should know that arguing with your head coach will land you on the bench and out of that team no matter how good you are thats just something he can not tolerate otherwise everybody will think they can get away with it...still a very good player and played very well for the jags i wonder who he will play for next <br>  <br>  Pacman-this guy was highly rated out of college and had a very good first few years...then he started getting in trouble...i thought he would be a steal for the cowboys and boy was i wrong he got beat on a daily basis...and im not sure he will ever return to form....but before all this legal trouble started he was a very good player and could have developed into one of the top corners in league (and returners)<br>  <br>  LT is a guy that i think can still produce but the chargers need to take a LOT of carries away from him so that he will be fresh come playoff time..i think the chargers need to change to a 3 back backfield like the giants used to have (distribute carries between sproles LT and a back they draft)....LT probably wont like this if they do that so he will retire much quicker if they do take a lot of his carries away<br>  <br>  the only player out of all these players that is recognizable off the field is LT (im pretty sure he won an award of some sort for his community service).... none these other guys gives A LOT to the community to my knowledge i dont know if that would change without their respective distractions|`|dfiW1IICaa	peppers wont be better since he takes like every other play off hes to lazy

hlqj0pvxaa	What most people don't understand is that all arts have many techniques that are applicable in a ground grappling situation. <br>  <br>  These aspect are not explored so most people don't understand them and ignorant people will deny them out of lack of knowledge. |`|hQWucH5uaa	Both Shaolin and Wudang styles of kung fu have all wrestling ground fighting components included within the system itself.<br>  <br>  Shuai Jao is grappling in Kung fu.<br>  <br>  There is a book which also covers the ground grappling found in kung fu called:<br>  CHINESE FAST WRESTLING by Shao-Yu Liang.|`|gBO908P6aa	No, there are elements of groundfighting from various systems like Mantis, monkey, drunken boxing etc.  Southern Dog Fist Boxing does include a lot of ground techniques and striking from the ground.  Kung fu styles concentrate primarily on stand up striking manuevers first.  If you already learn jiujitsu then that's as good as anything on the ground.<br>  <br>  Edit: well said clowns.  "Proper" by who's standards?  Every style has its own "truth" about combat.  That being said I'm getting a feeling this question is just another strawman argument.|`|Qpx6gCwFaa	At least you've stopped thinking that Kung fu is all striking :P<br>  <br>  Here are some clips:<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__JYhJJXZr8" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__JYhJJXZ...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Hpt_ZVXm-I&feature=related" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Hpt_ZVXm...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2IZMPW3ieU&feature=related" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2IZMPW3i...</a><br>  <br>  Anyway, just because there aren't any youtube videos for it, doesn't mean it doesn't exist. Can I just ask, how come you keep saying kung fu is useless because it only has striking and no ground fighting but would recommend Muay Thai?<br>  <br>  Here's an interesting article:<br>  <a href="http://www.damazen.com/blog/2007/09/30/grappling-ground-fighting-and-chinese-martial-arts/" rel="nofollow">http://www.damazen.com/blog/2007/09/30/g...</a>|`|w9kSGLBxaa	yup. I watched a clip of tiger kung fu that was showing submissions like the heel hook reverse heel hook and a figure four toe hold. What he was using to set them up was a form of single leg take down. he was using arm drags to set up neck cranks and such. <br>  <br>  just youtube or yahoo search kung fu grappling techniques. There is also Mongolian wrestling.<br>  <br>  How you may define proper is purely subjective. I am 100% certain there are kung fu practitioners that practice such techniques against a person who is trying to escape and fighting back (rolling). Remember just because you do not see them does not mean they are not there.<br>  <br>  I have never seen your brain, yet I know it is there.|`|AA10270018	Mantis kung fu has ground mantis whereby you pull your opponent to the ground and finish him.|`|5RqdB1UPaa	Great question!<br>  <br>  There aren't many who would think of kung fu and grappling, but there are several styles, especially those that originate from Western, and Northern areas in China that include ground fighting. The interaction with bordering nations helped to influence the style and so the martial arts of the opposite nation were folded in to the typically high stanced, high kicking, fast Kung fu we associate with the North.<br>  <br>  My own style of Lama Pai is an example of that. Lama Pai is a Northern style that was passed down through Tibet. The most distinguishing factor of the style is its long circular arm movements that are reminisent of the Ape, and is quite lethal when used correctly. Another aspect is the influence of mongolian wrestling, with an understanding that not all fights will be fought on two feet. The lion's roar style and later the Lama Pai system was often used by traveling bodyguards and so the reality of groundfighting was a distinct probability.<br>  As for other styles i can't give you in depth information because of my lack of experience with them.|`|bKPcfEwTaa	In a word - NO - because if you take the most famous of Chinese styles...Wing Chun Kung Fu the idea is to meet force with force...as it was designed by a  woman so that anyone with any build, gender and so on could defend themselves. Ground fighting is ridiculous concept in my viewanyway, if they have got you on the ground then you have lost basic rules of self defence. Maybe I am biased because I hate UFC...but I really think this form of fighting is a successful method.|`|bqIrBR6kaa	Most of them have. The problem is that kung fu orignally came from warriors and ground-fighting is not a warriors art. If you pin somebody down, you also pin yourself down. You could get stabbed in the back or hit by a spear.|`|M0qoqvJbaa	I'm fairly positive there are no systems in any strictly Chinese martial arts which address ground fighting and grappling in the same devoted manners as styles like judo and wrestling.

A me piace lo sport in generale e vorrei vedere in tv più discipline sportive, infatti seguo sempre con passione le olimpiadi che mi permettono di vedere tante discipline di cui non si parla per nulla, però purtroppo anche le tv fanno vedere quello che attira maggiormente il pubblico (sky in questo mi da una mano nel vedere più sport differenti)<br>  Sul fatto dei calciatori hai ragione, vengono pagati troppo in base a quello che fanno. Ma se provi a informarti negli USA dove gli sport nazionali sono il Basket, il Baseball e il Football ci sono giocatori che prendono anche 20 milioni di euro l'anno, penso quindi che tutti debbano darsi una regolata.<br>  Poi ovviamente il fatto che piaccia o meno questo gioco è tutta una questione di gusti, forse sembra che gli italiani siano tutti appasionati perchè se tu chiedi a chiunque quale sia la sua squadra del cuore ti saprà dare un nome e tutti sembrano tifosi, ma fra questi ci sono tanti che non hanno neanche idea di quali siano i giocatori della loro squadra e di come funzioni la Champions League per farti degli esempi.

Carson might not get you the numbers he got last year due to Rudi taking a larger load this year, but Carson will get you consistent points.

e1GZDKo5aa	Rodgers has 6 TD passes and only one pick in his last three games! He's thrown for at least 290 yards in three games and has thrown 3 TDs twice! Only two games with an interception and he's thrown a TD in every game except for one (Week 3 against Dallas, he never threw a pick in this game either)! He's got 12 TDs in only 7 games so far and has only thrown 4 INTs in that span as well! His QB rating is 98.8 and he has 3 rushing TDs on the year!<br>  <br>  Orton has thrown 10 TDs and 4 picks in his last five games, in fact, since he didn't throw a TD or a pick in his first two outings, 10 TDs and 4 INTs is what he has on the year! Only 2 games with an interception, but two games without a TD! Only one 290+ yard game and one 3 TD game! His QB rating is 91.4 and he has no rushing TDs on the season! <br>  <br>  It is kinda close, but Rodgers can be safely called the better of these two QBs so far this season! As for the better career, I would guess Rodgers! He has better receivers around him (Donald Driver, James Jones, Greg Jennings beat out Rashied Davis, Brandon Lloyd, and Devin Hester any day!!!) and the Packers O-line gives slightly more time to throw the football from what I've seen than the Bears O-line, but the O-lines are practically even overall! Basically as long as Green Bay is able to keep a good O-line and great receivers around him then there is no reason why Rodgers shouldn't stay better than Orton for the majority of their careers! <br>  <br>  On a different note, careers are too tough to predict (especially when dealing with people as young as Orton and Rodgers) due to injuries, teammate retirements, unexpected teammate deaths (God forbid!), free agency, the trade market, and the pressure the media puts on players (especially on great young ones like Rodgers and Orton)! <br>  <br>  Besides Green Bay has a history of having great QBs! Bart Starr and Brett Favre are the ones when people come to mind! The Bears have historically always had a hard-nosed D with a great running-game to boot (but we ain't talkin about RBs here, are we?)! I say Rodgers continues the trend; he's certainly playing like he will!<br>  <br>  As for better season I say Rodgers, and even though I am sort of reluctant to predict careers I still say Rodgers has the better career of the two if everything goes accordingly!|`|X7O0Uxqxaa	Kyle Orton by far.|`|FmZyN6ORaa	AARON RODGERS!! Even though the bears are awesome, orton isn't performing as well as I thought this year. As for rodgers, he has been a great replacement for favre, and is totally living up to the role.|`|ejrVotg8aa	So far they're numbers are fairly close, I'd say Rodgers had the better season since he's had a lot more pressure on him and has played with a banged up team. By far Rodgers will have a better career. Orton won't even be a starting once the Bears bring in a real QB. |`|RqRruAIbaa	Is this a serious question?  Rodgers wins over Orton with ease.  You can't ask for any more from Rodgers after only starting 7 games.  He has done a great job amidst all the drama with Favre.

He gets a positive passing yards or 238 average per game out of the last 7. He has had 4 ints, 2 fumbles and 113 rushing yards with only 30 attempts! But, he has been sacked 13 times with a loss of 79 yards total<br>  <br>  So far, I see rodgers is the better qb, but for career it has to be Orton!|`|PTv3K8maaa	Rodgers has 6 TD passes and only one pick in his last three games!

The fact that he is a rookie, leading a team with very little talent to a winning record is mind boggling to me. Especially since there were so many that doubted his talent because he played in a weak college conference. I myself was one of these people, but he has beyond proven that he is a great quarterback. I mean the guy is on pace to throw for over 3000 yards, and almost 20 touchdowns, with a bad supporting cast. Exceeds all expectations from a rookie.|`|ukihtM9Haa	definitely Matt Ryan..... cuz he is doing great for a rookie QB..... sure he may not have da best stats, but he has done da job for a QB. he is playing like he has been in tis league 4 years. he also made a combination wit Roddy White to make a really dangerous duo..... just imagine him in da future.... he is like another version of brett favre..... a qb turning young players into elites..... he is a true future, no, a true leader right now 4 da falcons..... he deserves his big contract...... u may doubt da payments 4 rookies, but it worked wit Ryan....... i swear, tis year in da NFL, rookies have had a huge impact in da game.... for example: matt ryan, matt forte, steve slation, chris johnson, joe flacco, donnie avery, kevin smith, eddie royal, darren mcfadden, chris long, jonathan stewart, and many more......|`|kPApr9qaaa	Jason Campbell. last year, he threw 12 TDs and 11 picks.

e0e20edaaaeca83191f8c91285412008aa	You made good points that he does need to start passing to Odom and Radmonovic because he needs to get more of them involved.  However, he doesn't do those plays to wow people, he does it because he can't trust his teammates to make their shots or finish plays.  But I do agree he should pass more this season now his team is more experienced and can actually give him some help.|`|2e097f10e6bde66ff68f5afe6af5912daa	You nailed it bro ...

(he got booed for that one) hahaha lol|`|AA11265241	This is the way I feel. Kobe is by far the best. But I do agree he could pass a little more. But not as much as people say. I think the optimal situation would be where he wins a scoring title but not by much and has a few more assists and steals. His optimal stats would be like,<br>  32.4ppg     6rebounds   5.5 assists   2.2 steals<br>  with a 48% field goal %<br>  As for your question I kind of feel like that's saying is throwing a 104 mile per hour fast ball keeping a pitcher from getting strike outs.|`|9171de795bc9c24255d8419b11327416aa	He's just a showboat that isn't going to be as good as he could be.

JCRdicqXaa	Ahley Cole is ambushed by the Mafia under instructions from Cheryl.<br>  Thereafter he is dangled over a cliff and made to promise not to cheat on the dear Cheryl ever again.|`|Ia8pJg1iaa	In the ending some crooks have stolen some gold and put into a bus, they drive on a mountain side and skid onto the edge so the bus is balancing on the edge of a cliff, gold one side and people the other. They can't move as the bus wobbles. It ends there literally a "cliff hanger"!<br>  However in the article they are not relating it to the Italian Job film, it's just a play on words as Ashley Cole wants to beat Juventus who are an Italian team, hence the Italian Job. Chelsea won the first leg 1-0 and only need to keep it that way to win the second leg.|`|awHJ0KKpaa	The italian job ends with the bus teetering on the edge of a cliff, the Cast standing to the end still on the floor and the gold pulling the bus over. Michael Caine (Charlie Kroger) attempts to go and retrieve the gold but each time he walks down to the gold, he can stand there for one or two second before the bus tips. He then attempts to crawl down slowly and pull some gold back but whenever he gets closer the bus tips and the gold slides down even further at which point Michael says "Hold on, I've got a brilliant idea". Then the film ends leaving us pondering what the brilliant idea could be. Someone has figured out how it could have been done. 'Michael would slide down on a board with wheels that was in the back of the bus, grab one crate of gold and one of the crooks would quickly pull him back up before the bus starts to tip. Then so on until all the gold was on the other end and they could carry it out the door (Which was still on the road)'. Now the makers of the film haven't said this is how it happened but it's one of the only explanations we have. Hope this is helpful and not too much to read.|`|4BppP7Mkaa	check out cashley in that pic.

The only good U of M is University of Michigan. Go Blue. |`|AA10236380	Hockey's cool, therefore girls who play it would, by association, be cool.<br>  <br>  However, U-M sucks.  I hate U-M.  So unfortunately if you go there and/or play for them, I'll have to hate you.<br>  <br>  Notre Dame kinda sucks too.  Maybe Purdue?  Penn State?  Just not U-M.  That's all I ask.<br>  <br>  ** Correction **<br>  <br>  U-M (University of Michigan) sucks.  U-M (Minnesota)  does not suck.  The Gophers are fine.  You're 100% in the clear.

sPrBxmuqaa	answering on my wife's log-in because I wanted to answer this question.<br>  <br>  Running even splits is VERY tough and leaves NO room for error.  If you are hitting around 5:00, then take this advice:<br>  <br>  Hit your first lap at 70 (1:10).  This will give you a good start and give you some time to play with.  2nd lap - don't intentionally slow down, but a 75 (1:15) will bring you in at 2:25.<br>  <br>  The third lap is the key.  This is the lap that you have to concentrate.  Too many inexperienced runners try to save too much for the last kap (or the last 100 meters) and lose the race or don't hit the time due to a bad 3rd lap.  Don't worry about the last lap - you will either have it or you won't.  Even if you do "have it" that last lap, what difference does it make if you are already off the pace?  And if it's not there - you'll have the few extra seconds in your back pocket to use.<br>  <br>  NEVER EVER plan on having that final kick.  If you have it - GREAT, if you don't have it that day - then you're in trouble.<br>  <br>  I raced for 12 years and no matter what I tried, some days I had a great finish, sometimes it wasn't there - you never know if it will be there until it's time to use it.<br>  <br>  The 3rd lap - you really need to not dip under the 75 (1:15) lap split.  If you fall off to far, the last lap won't leave you enough time to get the time back.<br>  <br>  In the final 200 meters, try to build up gradually - you may not want to kick in the sprint until the last 100 meters.|`|5VXSD7C4aa	try to aim for 74 to 75 secs a lap.Try to pace yourself And kick the last 400, and try to sprint the last 100, coming out of the turn.  That way you will break 5mins if you have completed the other time splits on time.|`|eELS8zSRaa	well if you can keep pace with someone from the top three. If you are getting close to 1:30 on more than one lap you need to step it up.<br>  <br>  1:30 1:15 1:15 1:00|`|UBIlwiALaa	Not sure if this is what your asking but 1 min. 15 secs. per lap if staying the same pace?|`|DQ2eTxaSaa	Well, to get even splits, you would have to run 1:15 laps. But most runners don't run even splits.<br>  I would go hard (but not to hard, you don't want to be dead after the 1st lap) on the first lap and aim for 1:12 or 1:13.<br>  The second lap should be right on target: a 1:15.<br>  The third lap is going to be tough, and you'll probably slow down no matter what you do. Hopefully the most your time is 1:17 or 1:18.<br>  On the fourth lap, you'll probably have an adrenaline rush, being the last lap of the race. Try to run this one at a 1:15, or lower if you can, but it will be hard with the lactic acid building up in your legs.

He just lost me though when he threw his little victory dance two seasons ago in the playoffs against the Colts.  That was un-cool.|`|ofC4JQIhaa	because he talks alot of trash and no he cant back it up lol|`|KyFvW86vaa	Only a chargers fan could even ask that question? The guy has plenty of talent but that is no reason to over look the fact that the guy acts like a jerk.He is a fanchise QB, so he is supposed to be a level headed leader and spokesperson for the organisation not some immature brat.he needs to grow up and get on with it.|`|7BzlBFjtaa	Because he can't back up his trash talk. He wouldn't be half as good of a QB without the running game that LT and Darren Sproles provide for him. I could name 5 QB's better than him without even thinking about it. P. Manning, Drew Brees, Big Ben, Brady, little Manning, Kurt Warner, I'd take Cutler over him too. He's been to one championship game (which he lost.) Let's look at the other QB's in his draft class. My boy Big Ben: 2 Superbowls. Eli Manning: 1 Superbowl. Rivers? I think you probably know that he has 0.|`|JMVkZJzUaa	He's a decent QB, but not as good as he thinks he is.  His stats can be OK, but he shoots his gums off at innapropriate times.  I will give him credit for being tough.  I think he will mature and be a good leader, but right now, not so much.|`|o5jSID4Jaa	Because QB's are supposed to be leaders. You can't look much like a leader if you're taunting fans or constantly running your mouth. He's a good QB but its hard to respect him because he's so immature.|`|Rpk9qyfBaa	yea yea...players talk trash but he talks trash in a different way...he mocks fans....fans hate that...and fans especially hate QB's who talk trash because usually QB's never talk trash|`|Xk8z820Uaa	his way to cocky i guess and he disses other QB's like  Jay Cutler, rivers gave him the **** in his first 2 years|`|e9hneRYcaa	he is arrogant and whines a lot, the same goes for cutler|`|AOZvz2dpaa	he is a cocky white boy<br>  <br>  thats the worse kinda white boy|`|6a0dd7563167279d8fff996ef06631f5aa	He's a marginal QB with a huge ego and cocky to the point of being obnoxious.|`|KTp27Fokaa	Philip Rivers is a very good QB.

AA11674745	Well, kind of. I mean a rule is a rule and nothing seemed to be wrong on the part of the ref. But that was a legitimate goal. Hiller left the puck on the doorstep and Zetty knocked it in. In the end, the Ducks did play a better game.<br>  <br>  If anything, situations like that should be reviewable.<br>  <br>  So, nobody did anything wrong, but one cannot come away feeling that the Red Wings weren't robbed in a way - even though the ref did lose sight of the puck.

But they'll prevail in the series.|`|c7992d905ee1715cf5c3ed1c09c6ee98aa	Well the ref was on the other side of the puck and could not see it so he blew the whistle even if it was in plain sight to everyone else it doesn't matter the ref could not see it.

c9aed0222358b05c920b95caa376c061aa	I think that they're going to put Dampier starting just because he has more expierence, but Diop should get the starting spot as the season progresses.  Diop is big and long and can shut down any center defensively.  I think stat wise Dampier will have a better season because he knows how to score better, but as far as productivity goes I'd have to give it to Diop.|`|0b7bb7bd6b12805ae4636a5c7d655a2eaa	damp|`|a04e49123a56fd4dee10b3c9c6648b1daa	no i think diop is starting, check out last week's sports illustrated's scouting reports|`|c622c5e14bb0274ad2e37ad83fbc381faa	dampier! dampier is the better center i think...heck,he can even guard shaq! remember him in his golden state days? diop however is the better blocker. hmmm...diop could really steal minutes from dampier but i think dampiers gonna get the nod for dallas...that starting lineup worked so well for them last year..|`|86ba1eb61b371fb85569ada93dcb3652aa	I think it`s Diop....|`|e0e20edaaaeca83191f8c91285412008aa	They are probably going to start Desagana Diop.  He played some good defense during the finals, and also Eric Dampier is getting old.  Dallas is probably using Dampier for being their main rebounder.  Diop has come a long way from the cavs to now becoming a starting center for dallas in the finals.  He's a young player who is great defensively, could use a lot of help on his offensive game however.

At this stage in his career, I'd want him to come off a bench and light  a spark out on the floor, but I'd take him off quickly because of his selfishness.<br>  <br>  I don't see A.I. ever going for a roll like that.<br>  <br>  Somebody will sign him, but it won't be the Celtics or Lakers (or any other team who feels they can win it all)|`|0ytjj1EGaa	No it is not over<br>  <br>  But he is also FAAR away from his PRIME<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  ADD Not all R Retarded only some R|`|BGOPARrTaa	well so far ive been watching him play his being a team player and i think he gets the most assist...|`|GBGcI509aa	When you're having 20+ppg 5APG avarages and you're 33 thats good.|`|0yljkLGeaa	oh man i can't imagine NBA without my main man AI, <br>  Ai still got skills left under his sleeves the main thing is that he became a fish out of water when he was acquired by JOe dumars, he is not really a team player, but like what Joe's reason for signing him up is AI is a natural born player that can carry a team OFFENSIVELY, a player that could match today superstars in LEBRON WADE PIERCE and even KOBE on the offensive end<br>  <br>  <br>  he might lose few steps this season but he is still better as ever remember last year 51 vs LAL and other scoring shows he poured in DENVER<br>  <br>  i would love to see him back in PHILLY<br>  <br>  <br>  AI is no 5 star player anymore i must admit that<br>  but he is still at 3 to 4 level|`|248105516e0a10aa90a923223f69a619aa	Allen Iverson can be use as a back up.

b0af4140b671aeeb8f7f443973bea0bdaa	That might be the best move the Lions have made this decade.  Saying no to TO.  Lord knows the Lions have more than enough problems without the TO circus coming to town.|`|qo0kKtvpaa	The Lions are focusing on rebuilding after last season. They don't want distractions.

Garcia, PHI w/ McNabb and DAL w/ Romo).  I am expecting Detroit to bring in a QB (probably M. Stafford) w/ the #1 overall selection in the NFL draft.  The Lions want to do everything they can to have a supporting locker room behind Stafford.  Bringing T.O. in was not going to do that, especially since T.O. will be the #2 WR option in Detroit behind Megatron.   <br>  <br>  Be mindful that T.O wants to win now.  That isn't going to happen w/ the rebuilding Lions in 2009.
7ee92dd5b03131613a5e576ba37a2851aa	Its a great debate.  People who say it isn't argue that there is no head to head score, there is no direct competition.  People who say that it is point out all the athleticism it requires, and the teamwork.  But really why people say it isn't is because they are so used to thinking of the cheerleaders as a side note to their football game.  Like its not the main event, and not a sport.|`|8ecf3d8d8e2b8b93edd9a23ed0e23945aa	because you do kartwheels and jump and yell but i think jumping and doing kartwheels is being active and a sport is activities when you are be active or moving around for at least 15 minutes.|`|a62c1b781a423fb77b8001e542494978aa	it's not head on competition that one can sit and watch and root for one team or the other.  it's a sport like gymnastics is, not like football is.  most sports fans only call the head to head competition sports like basketball and baseball and football real sports.|`|de9a43d4261643cd35fedcf013bcf414aa	i have no idea and it bugs the living crap out of me

2s244jGgaa	I really like your team, youve done really well. Seriously, your forward lines is good and you were able to afford 2 quality ruckman like Aaron Sanderlands and Big Dean Cox. They will grab you plenty of points, great decision to have mitch brown up forward too along with Chris Yarran and Brett Deledio - young guns. <br>  <br>  Im a first timer too, good luck : )|`|mXFOru11aa	IDK about you guys but i'm getting sick of this q|`|NMDUPd8paa	anyone from Port Adelaide|`|378GRzrnaa	looks good.. good luck|`|4wRyTY9Raa	Looks pretty good to me.|`|sQpoIxf7aa	that team is good but mines better HAHA!!!!!|`|ph5ZX1ioaa	Very good effort for a first timer. I like your selection of gun players (Bowden, Goddard, Cornes, Ablett, Swan, Deledio, Didak, Cox in particular).<br>  <br>  > Patful is a defensive negator who is unlikely to average more than 50 - you want to avoid these types - look for the attacking defenders that zone off their men and gather possessions on the rebound. <br>  > Richo and Harvey would be better suited to the forward line - there are more quality midfielders to chose from then forwards<br>  > Your bench choices leave a fair bit to be desired. You want your bench players to:<br>  <br>  (1) Fill in when needed<br>  (2) Increase in price so they can be downgraded to other rookies free up cash mid season<br>  <br>  Some good options at this stage for each position:<br>  <br>  B: Suban, Broughton, Rance, Petrenko<br>  M: Beams, Anthony, Swift, Robinson <br>  R: Graham, Currie, Jacobs<br>  F: Brown, Gumbleton, Walker<br>  <br>  ...however keep track of the teams for R1, the bench is probably where you'll do the most shuffling in the last week.|`|Rs5hFckCaa	that's a nice team out of 10 i would go maybe 9/10<br>  GOOD LUCK WITH IT!

AA10907759	Mark D, The most important muscle groups for throwing the discus are the legs, the lower back, and the core group (as lestermo suggested).  The bicep, pectoral, deltoid, latissimus, and traps are really more support muscles for this event.  The bench press is more of a triceps-and-pectoral exercise, so it isn't my main discus throwers exercise.  I have them do squats, leg press, calf raises, back raises, pec deck (or flys), various rowing, lat pulls, curls, shoulder flys, and dumbbell bench press, along with lots of plyometrics (jumping, sit-ups, core-with ball, etc.).  But you also have to look at the way you lift.  Powerlifters use high weight with low reps-per-set and long rests between sets (1.5 to 3 minutes) to build strength.  Typically (once warmed up) my throwers will follow an 8-6-4-2 pattern of sets, increasing the weight each time.  During the regular season we will do one set of muscle groups (back + bi, Chest & tri, Legs) in each of three days (Mon, Wed, Fri).  When we get to the end of the season we will focus on legs and maintaining.|`|Ce9DOYSAaa	I dont have much to add to these guys but the fact that in order to improve, you need to analyze your release height, and all the little things.

My dad is 5' 8" and my mom is 5' 4".  If you've had your growth spurt yet then most likely no.  But if not then you have a good chance at being 6' 6".  Also, it depends on your diet.

It needs to be spread out a little better. If anything, Jeff Hardy needs to be brought to ECW. But, that's only because I'd like to see the Hardys fight as a tag team more often.

With Edge out of action there are no other A-level stars on Smackdown.  Undertaker doesn't wrestle very often on TV and Jeff Hardy is not A-level yet.  Big Show's current role doesn't have him in the ring nearly enough to carry the show.

AA10107142	if it makes you feel any better kel-tec (people either love or hate kel-tec) was heavily involved in the design and manufacture of the ruger lcp.  you can get a kel-tec for a little less and most dealers have them in stock if its going to get rattled around a truck and beat up this might be the best choice, around here you get put on a waiting list for the lcp and extra mags are almost impossible to find.<br>  <br>  there are lots of sub-compacts out there, the kel-tec is slightly less expensive than the lcp, the roughbough r9 is smaller but costs almost 5x as much.<br>  <br>  on the larger side glock, and springfield make great sub-compacts that are affordable.  kahr makes some great little guns, the cw line is pretty affordable.  walther has the new PPS out and it's a pretty slick little gun, comes from a company with a pretty decent reputation, the classic ppks is a great little pistol.  <br>  <br>  if you want the best and are willing to pay for a top shelf sub-compact the h&k p2000sk is unbeatable (out my collection the p2000sk is my favorite even though the kahr cw9 is more comfortable to carry)  as is the sig p239 and p230/p232 (basically an improved ppk with better quality construction).|`|CFm0u13Paa	First choice is a .38 or .357 revolver. Utterly reliable and easy to learn. <br>  <br>  <br>  If you must have an auto, I love my Kahr K9.

He's a typical modern day moronic athlete.|`|Bnoz7N0Caa	What's wrong with you? Releasing Pierce? He's our best defensive player. Burress might be an idiot but if we can keep Pierce then that's what we're going to do.|`|0f5cc27a5aca75cf6162b2cbb88fc13caa	Plaxico Burress is expected to be charged with criminal possession of a weapon after shooting himself in the thigh Friday night. The felony chage results in a mandatory 3.5 year prison sentence.<br>  "He went for his gun and fumbled it. And now it will cost him," a police source told the NY Daily News. Details continue to emerge, such as Antonio Pierce berating Plaxico for bringing the gun to a club. Pierce also stashed the gun for Burress and didn't call 911 at Plaxico's request, so he could face charges as well. Cops only learned about the incident after the Giants quietly reached out to them to report it.  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  If this was T Owens it would be OVERKILL on the media and on here.  They would be saying he was on his way to rob a bank or trying to attempt suicide and 90% of the people would be posting about it on here. Go ahead an thumbs down, its the facts|`|h0LR993Uaa	Look, so they made a mistake - everybody does. Just because your team isn't half as good as the Giants doesn't mean you have to pile on. The Giants aren't going to release them for a tiny episode like this. Watch out, we're going to the Superbowl...|`|6tGYe5roaa	Yes he is. He is a really big idiot.|`|2BEMSGPdaa	Well since the NY News had the same thing on the front page  I guess so.|`|KvrBxEZ8aa	New York City police were looking for Plaxico Burress last night to question him about accidentally shooting himself in the right thigh, the latest episode in a fast-growing list of off-the-field incidents that could potentially place his Giants career in jeopardy.<br>  <br>  A police spokesman said the shooting happened just before 1 a.m. at The Latin Quarter nightclub in midtown, which was where Burress was believed to have been partying with two Giants teammates and his wife. The bullet went "in and out" of Burress' leg without hitting a bone or artery, police said.<br>  <br>  Burress, a wide receiver who earlier Friday was ruled out of today's game against the Washington Redskins because of a hamstring injury, arrived at New York-Presbyterian Hospital/Weill Cornell Hospital with his wife, Tiffany, and an unidentified man, police said. He was admitted around 2 a.m. and treated and released before 1 p.m.<br>  <br>  New York City police arrived at Burress' sprawling $4-million home in Totowa, N.J., at 4:35 p.m. and spent 37 minutes outside the home. According to a police spokesman, Burress' wife, Tiffany, told them, "You can't come in. You can't talk to my husband."<br>  <br>  In October, Burress was fined one week's salary - $117,500 - and suspended for two weeks after missing a team meeting. The NFL also fined him $45,000 for his actions during and after a game that month against the 49ers in which he questioned the officiating and threw a ball into the stands following a touchdown.<br>  <br>  The Giants gave Burress a new five-year, $35-million contract before the season opener, but only $11 million is guaranteed. The relatively low $4.5-million signing bonus also means they could cut ties with him after this season without too much of a debilitating effect on their salary cap situation next year.<br>  <br>  Plaxico Burress is now a Giant issue<br>  <br>  <br>   In othe words "Plaxy" should be arrested or just suspended|`|qov5T21Daa	Yea, he is a stupid idiot. I had asked a similar question in here and some one said it best "you can take a guy out of the ghetto, but you cant take the ghetto out of the guy. He has such great potential as an athlete and I just hate see him waste is talent. I hope he does get locked up as lesson of stupidity for other players with tons of money ($35M contract). |`|AA12199588	He was supposed to get over all the "issues" when he got his new contract they said at the start of the season.  He's not an idiot, he just has very poor judgment all the way around and thinks rules don't apply to him.  He is wasting his talent and being nothing but a distraction for his team.  It is sad to see.|`|414b7351b200219e50b4bef935b60195aa	I still don't really understand what happened.<br>  <br>  So, he had a loaded gun, and he brought it into a club with Antonio Pierce, and "somehow" shot himself in the upper thigh? It really doesn't make much sense, if you ask me. |`|tWUQU4Juaa	Yes and I bet that the Cowgirls just can't wait to get the idiot on their team which is a collection of stupid criminal type players .|`|jNGqRsbFaa	Yes.|`|RL3EVSW2aa	at least he didn't shoot his mouth off like normal|`|ULCpuGUEaa	yes he is an idiot he and all of NFL players should know not to do something stupid like micheal vick and adam packman jones as burress did basically the same thing as jones being in a club with a gun. stupid idiots.|`|SWZ1WSftaa	He is a complete waste of human flesh.  I think it is hilarious what happened to him.  That sounds mean but what a sorry a$s he is.  I guess his sore hammy isn't bothering him as much anymore.  Now he has a hole in his thigh to worry about.  |`|AA10201898	yes Plexi Glass is... Watch out with a question like this dude. I asked a similar one and some Giants fan took offense and reported it as a "violation"...|`|gIzCwdDzaa	Total botard!|`|2TWeQz98aa	I dnt know if he is an idiot but I know he is fine as hell!

They might carry it, but they should also carry better bikes for not too much more money. If you plan to ride trails (esp. hard ones), this may give you too much grief.<br>  <br>  Check out GT, Giant, or better models Trek, Specialized. These are better bikes. Schwinn is now owned by Mongoose. Not so hot a company.

Since Motobecane colors were silver, black, and red that is not much of a clue either.<br>  <br>  There was a major renaissance of road bikes during the period you mention with many brands maturing in the U.S. market and Motobecane was one of them. The only thing I might suggest is to search online for old catalogs- many are posted and available for perusing- and see if anything looks familiar.

b7JS16dyaa	The current ECW is a great breeding ground: it worked wonders for CM Punk, and is working for Jack Swagger. I liked the original ECW, but it wouldn't work in this era, and I don't like living in the past. The current ECW is basically like airing a better FCW on a bigger scale.<br>  <br>  P.S. They should rename ECW, maybe to "Entertainment Championship Wrestling", because it's no longer "extreme". Raw and Smackdown are more violent than the supposed land of violence.|`|W8SgRKo7aa	i gota sya that i miss thron, marcus, RVD, Tazz and the dudleys but like its a great breeding ground...<br>  <br>  christian shouldnt be thre but... like swagger has a massive future cause he started great at ECW when he is ready he will go to raw or soemthing but its just a future place with all the futures there.<br>  its pretty much practice for the big groounds now.|`|oCvIydKHaa	While I also prefer the old ECW, I think the "new" ECW is still very good. It has possibly the most wrestling on any of the current WWE shows on TV.<br>  <br>  I do miss the days of Raven, Sandman, Sabu, RVD, Dudleyz, and the like... but I've gotten over it.. and even though I don't really like the name of ECW being used the way it is... I still think it's a great show.<br>  <br>  I just wish they would have brought back the WCW brand name instead.
z7JsVzcnaa	Hit the wall to get your stick back.  Both hands, switch hands, quick sticks.  Get out on the field and scoop some ground balls as well.<br>  <br>  If you're in decent shape, start doing some sprint workouts.  Sprint 50 yards, jog 50, reapeat x15.  4 stops are really good too.  Start on the end line.  Sprint the GLE and back, to the restraining line and back, to midfield and back, to the far end line and back.  6-8 of those work pretty well.|`|1PId0SOGaa	idk what lax is but if you wanna get into shape... heres my advice. first eat breakfast. get some energy... then do two laps around a track for a warm up.. stretch. then do another lap... you should be feeling good. then do 10 push ups... get up and do lunges for like 15 yards and sprint for 20... turn around.. 10 push ups... lunges sprint. go there back there back there back there back.. after that run a lap... just get loose. try not to drink so much water cuz your conditioning. drink after and before be during just drink enough to not pass out. but yea.... do that every other day and you got a leg work out you got some upper body you got endurance... but the lunges will get your legs back.

eb418d623d1c0aaeca28d877d73fc1faaa	Agli esordi quando l’Italia andò a far visita all’Ungheria che all’epoca, insieme all’Austria, rappresentava quanto di meglio si potesse trovare sulla scena del calcio mondiale vi fu una pesante sconfitta che gli Azzurri rimediarono a opera dei Magiari. Nell’occasione, quella fu la seconda e ultima volta che la Nazionale utilizzò maglie bianche con lo stemma di Casa Savoia. Fu deciso che dall’incontro successivo (per combinazione, sempre contro gli Ungheresi, il 6 gennaio 1911 a Milano) il colore da utilizzare, proprio in onore dei Savoia, fosse l’azzurro della loro bandiera, al centro della quale v’era lo Scudo Sabaudo rosso con una croce bianca all’interno. Le foto dell’epoca ci mostrano un colore slavato tendente al celeste e in effetti le sfumature cromatiche della maglia cambiarono notevolmente nel corso degli anni, passando da un bluastro-indaco fino a un azzurro scuro, non essendo mai stata chiarita con precisione la tonalità dell’azzurro da usare. Comunque, il colore fece subito presa e fin da allora i giocatori della Nazionale vennero chiamati Azzurri. Azzurri si chiamano anche oggi, per estensione, tutti gli atleti che, dopo i calciatori, si trovarono a rappresentare l’Italia nelle varie discipline sportive.|`|972fdfeb57159705b519674536b4857baa	qual'è il colore della maglia????|`|65db43d9520a3ffc1624592a5b2b5c64aa	Io ho sentito dire che inizialmente l' assegnazione dei colori delle casacche nazionali è stata per sorteggio: blu alla Francia, bianco alla Germania, rosso alla Spagna, azzurro all' Italia, etc.. poi  non so.|`|1955b82eaf23abb1a93af9e3037b05ffaa	Per via del colore della maglia no?|`|5c089e5080dcdfe2e84b64209909c327aa	perchè hanno la maglia azzurra, infatti quelli del milan si chiamano rossoneri, inter nerazzurri, juve bianconeri.... dipende dal colore della maglia in poche parole|`|6e14e669d92fbb18ff57531c3aa4c259aa	la maglia azzurra nel calcio è in onore ai savoia, l'italia nelle altre competizioni soprattutto motoristiche ha il colore rosso.. blu la francia, argento la germania, verde l'inghilterra, bianco gli usa... per questo c'è il rosso ferrari il rosso ducati il rosso alfa e non l'azzurro, un bacio a tutti voi e.. forza italia|`|6de08c52708351a3e307be858dd7a28daa	Guarda bene la maglia!

PPewAOU5aa	who cares, i'm sick of black people alway's getting the attention.|`|065b430f4b4b9a58a8c14fa3b764d8c1aa	Strictly speaking, Robinson wasn't the first black player in baseball, but he was the first in the modern era.<br>  <br>  Teams did not make the decision of which players would and would not wear his number today.  Every team was asked to have at least one player do so, and most teams asked for volunteers.  No team would have said no to any other players doing so.  But some players may not have felt that they were not worthy to wear Robinson's number, even today.<br>  <br>  So, for the most part, each of the 750 players on the active rosters, plus each coach and each manager, was given the option to wear 42 or not.  Some teams decided that everyone one do so, and I applaud that.<br>  <br>  One team decided that the last person in baseball who ought to be wearing 42 today was the only one on their team to be doing so.  Really, if you want to be questioning any such decision today, question the Giants' one.|`|2pSgIuY3aa	From the Blue Jays website:<br>  "It was (Royce) Clayton's former teammate in Cincinnati, Ken Griffey Jr., who first asked Major League Baseball for permission to wear No. 42 on Sunday's anniversary. Selig liked the idea so much that he opened up the opportunity to everyone in baseball. <br>  <br>  Four members of the Blue Jays organization were quick to accept. In addition to Clayton, hitting coach Mickey Brantley, designated hitter Frank Thomas, and center fielder Vernon Wells wore the number."|`|4EMmDa04aa	All lot of players wore his number today but their games got rained out. You missed quite a bit.|`|AA10784467	There were white/Hispanic players that worn # 42 <br>  Grady Sizemore, Cleveland Indians <br>  Ivan Rodriguez, Detroit Tigers <br>  Jim Thome, Chicago White Sox<br>  to name a few.|`|O3S2HLiCaa	This is a good question followed by a good point. Obviously the Blue Jays decided to let their black players pay tribute to Jackie Robinson (the first black player in the Majors), but I agree that it would have been just as respectful, if not more respectful, for even non-black players to where #42 today. Only allowing the black players to wear it shows some sort of segregation that we are trying to get rid of today. However, I do see the point in just having black players do it as it is to show respect to the First Black Man to play the game that they are playing today.|`|TsmZHvqBaa	Grady Sizemore and Pudge wore #42 today.
cOPCNP7Laa	No. It's the team that sucks in the CL...<br>  <br>  Even the original Ronaldo didn't. And he was better, in his prime, than this Ronaldo imo.|`|FFE9Qztzaa	Hmmmm.. Tough question.......<br>  <br>  <br>  NO.|`|IWM1khX7aa	No.  There were different aspects for Man U and Inter.  Manchester United, without Ronaldo, would have not won the CL Final.  Inter is and always is good team, but they always fail to make footsteps to the next round.  Inter has not made it to the Semi Finals in the past 5 years.  Even with the star talent they had, Ronaldo wouldn't be as good because his team never performs well.  One player does not make a difference, even if he was the best player in the world.|`|H7iswFA1aa	Ronaldo is a united player and if was to play in italy with players like Gattuso then ronaldo wouldnt be around long enough to make a single apperance for inter, hed be crippled and crying in his bed.|`|WdOAxQmoaa	and he was at Arsenal head quarters before joining man utd ohhhhhh how story's come about eh!|`|WS8MvKQAaa	Ibra would have knifed him.

Take a look at a game and watch Ray Lewis play. He has lost a step and still is in on almost every play. He is one of the smartest linebackers ever (See his film study at home and talk to Mike Singletary, his former position coach and biggest mentor). Teams take the week prior to change their offense to go away from him. that says it all. With Urlacher, if you have a above average tight end he is going to have trouble covering him.|`|d2b6c616d0d3168e6621ae6fa0d97d61aa	in some ppl opinion......... yeah he is pretty good but I just can't call him the best because of who he plays for.<br>  <br>  PACKER'S RULE.

4c74b1d7bfb97da42bddf5f695d322d9aa	As the other answerers indicated already, the Braves are doing great after the trade deadline. Mark Texiera has proved to be a great asset and they've definitely utilized their new pitchers as well.<br>  <br>  Unfortunately for Atlanta they have had a couple of injuries over the last two days and their two star players are not 100%. Edgar Renteria had been their hottest hitter after the All-Star break averaging around .425. He's going to be out for at least two weeks...a huge blow. Escobar is a mediocre replacement, although he showed sparks of excellence tonight.<br>  <br>  Chipper and Andruw really need to step it up as well as Willie Harris and Escobar to make up for his absence. However, once Edgar comes back, I think the Braves will steamroll their competition. It'll be interesting to see how their upcoming matchup with New York goes...|`|GXmRb35Vaa	The Braves are doing a little better since they picked up the big bat of Mark Teixera who promptly homered in his first two games and five at-bats.  They also picked up Ocatavio Dotel who has done fine.|`|Mdax9soJaa	I think the Braves will probably make the post season but not by much...|`|tUe6aJZJaa	Since the Trade Deadline the BRaves are 3-2. Many thought that they had the best trades made. And it is showing to be true with Mark Teixaria hitting three homers and driving in 7 runners in his first 4 games with altanta. And Dotel has been doing good, all though he did give up some runs on Sunday.

KG will give you a double double but he won't take big shots... basically he disappers in the 4th quarter. KG will take his 10 to 15 shots a game and when he hits that limit he is done.

Look at the MVP races in the last few years.  Its always the player on the team who is towards the top of the NBA.  Other players get mentioned but is ts not with any real consideration.  Look back to a few years ago.  K.G. was the same ole K.G.  Still putting up numbers and still giving 104% on the floor.  The year that his teammates decided to step up and play together, he got MVP.  But when the team falls and K.G. does exactly the same thing that he has always done, he gets no love.|`|ce3e1c973a85180b6a985c5ac2beeb48aa	kg is better than duncan because he has more versatility than duncan but the fact still remains that duncan is on the team that has better guards and their team get more recognition!|`|ykKaF0vMaa	Duncan bad Kevin  good|`|5cb7f33712dcb55d25a4c8c25cfcae3caa	maybe the reason duncan is on the 1st team is because his team reached the playoffs while kg's team is already enjoying their vacation

QDx09AlVaa	Longer strides are better as long as you have good form.|`|yKh7wo2qaa	Longer strides allow for a greater push off and greater area covered. In other words, you'll get to where you want to go in less steps. The key to a sprint is actually the turn over rate of the stride. If you can have a fast turnover with a long stride you'll be pretty good. Find some videos of college and professional track athletes and examine strides from the side, you'll see that most sprinters use the longer stride. In the end, it's all about what gets you there the fastest. Good luck.

D9SU1dTmaa	anke a me piacciono holly e benji peccato ke alla tv nn li danno +!!<br>  cmq nn so rispondere alla tua domanda... ciao|`|66e3babb65248d7d8c7896ee8ff5d21faa	Prova su youtube.com e scrivi holly e benji|`|20AhbKFJaa	Dopo lunga meditazione, ecco la risposta alla domanda che mi ero fatto da solo: quanto e' lungo il campo di Holly&Benji? <br>  Allora: per trovare la distanza a cui vediamo l'orizzonte, basta un po' di trigonometria: il raggio della terra (6327 Km), il raggio della terra più l'altezza dell'osservatore (facciamo un 1,70 m, anche se sono giapponesi e,di conseguenza nani) e la linea che va dall'osservatore alla linea dell'orizzonte, formano un angolo rettangolo (T___T perché' non posso postare un disegnino?). L'angolo al centro della terra risulta essere 180-2x. Da questo posso impostare l'equazione: 6378 Kmc78,0017Km*cos(180-2x), da cui ricavo il valore dell'angolo al centro della terra. A questo punto, la distanza fra l'osservatore e la linea dell'orizzonte si calcola <br>  semplicemente come 6378,0017 km*sin (angolo al centro della terra). Cosa? Volevate solo la misura? Ops! <br>  La distanza a cui uno di1,70 m vede l'orizzonte e' di circa 4,5 Km. Tenuto conto che la linea di porta compare quando un giocatore e' più' meno sulla tre-quarti campo, il campo e' lungo, circa...... 18 Km!!!!!!!!<br>  Ok ok, fin qua ci siamo, ma ora la vera domanda e': a che velocità'media corre Holly (o Mark, o Julian (questo spiega perché' sto povero malato di cuore non riesca mai a concludere una partita per riuscire a farsi tutti i 18 km del campo nel poco tempo in cui riesce a farli? <br>  No, la domanda e' un'altra....hai presente quando Holly dalla sua area tira una mina che attraversa tutto il campo (18 km),buca la rete e sfonda il muro?<br>  La domanda e': ma in Giappone li fanno i controlli anti-doping? E se si': quanti altri kriptoniani sono scampati all'esplosione? (spero pochi,perché' quelli vivi sono tutti qui di fisso....cacchio arrivano sulla Terra e diventano immortali....sarà' mica il paese della Cuccagna? Chi volete che sia cosi' fesso da non venirci?)<br>  E poi ancora: <br>  * Che schema usano per occupare tutto il campo? L'1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1? <br>  <br>  * In cosa consiste la tecnica del contropiede? <br>  * Come fa l'anziano della difesa a chiamare il fuori gioco, spara un razzo in aria? <br>  * L'arbitro gira per il campo in moto? E se investe qualcuno? E se gli finisce la benza? E se estrae il cartellino rosso mentre va a 80 all'ora con tutti i carabinieri li' intorno? <br>  * Per fermare il gioco cosa usa, la tromba? <br>  * Per fermare un giocatore lontano gli spara? Alle gambe o "purché' lo fermi"? <br>  * Se un tifoso fa invasione di campo quando lo ripigliano? <br>  * Se un giocatore resta a terra non rischia di creparci prima che qualcun lo veda? <br>  * Come cacchio si fa a fare ostruzione? <br>  * A fine partita gira l'autobus per il campo o i giocatori se la devono cavare da soli? <br>  * I guardalinee usano una vela per le segnalazioni? E quando devono mettersela tra le gambe per segnalare i rigori? <br>  * Se uno segna,dall'altra parte del campo come lo scoprono? <br>  * Se uno attraversa tutto il campo palla al piede, scarta tutti, scarta anche il portiere e giunto davanti alla porta vuota, dopo stimiamo un paio d'ore di corsa, la butta fuori cosa fa, si spara? Si butta sotto la moto dell'arbitro? E quando scopre che la partita era già' finita da mezz'ora (e che c'era pure stato l'intervallo)? <br>  * Se in una partita c'e' più' di una rete passa alla storia? <br>  * Se un giocatore chiamato dall'arbitro scappa via per non far riconoscere organizzano una squadra di ricerche? <br>  * Se uno perde palla sotto porta dopo azione continuata (tre quarti d'ora) della squadra cosa gli fanno?

The 1920's start and end with Babe Ruth,  altough you can include Al Simmons of the A's,  Grove Cleveland Alexander of the Cardinals.

The 1950's featured Mickey Mantle,  Willie Mays,  and Whitey Ford.  The 1960's include great pitchers such as Sandy Koufax and Bob Gibson,  along with Carl Yastremski and Hank Aaron.  The 1970's include Johnny Bench,  Pete Rose,  Reggie Jackson,  Steve Carlton.  The 1980's include Mike Schmidt,  Roger Clemens,  Rickey Henderson,  Fernando Valenzuela.

l75KGFMbaa	It will keep pitchers from concentrating properly. Many hitters in the 50's refused to wear helmets because of that. Also many pitchers have very mobile windups. Just imagine if a helmet falls in the middle of a delivery. It would be impractical. Pitchers are in danger of being hit by line drives, but training helps to diminish that danger.|`|Ar54Tylsaa	Good question.  I wish I had a good answer.  Does this, by chance, have anything to do with the Tampa Bay pitcher that got hit in the face?|`|7utqyJozaa	AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH U of A won WE ROCK ARIZONA ROCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br>  BAYLOR SUCKS!!!!!!!!<br>  YAY KRISTIE FOX!!!!!!!!!!!<br>  <br>  Because pitchers like taren Mowett dont need them they catch the balls win hit to them! helmets are only for batters so they dont get hit in the head when they are batting.|`|AA12131869	with a heavy helmet it makes it tough for a pitcher to balance poroperly not to mention they lose Perfiral vision to pick of batters... Its no good period.|`|Rmi5F4aeaa	In college baseball they use aluminum bats.  Balls batted by aluminum jump off the bat quicker, so in my opinion it's more risky in college ball.  <br>  <br>  That's why they need to get rid of aluminum and use wooden bats.  I know some colleges up north got rid of them.  Good for them.  <br>  <br>  That's the only reason I will not watch a college baseball game, hearing a 'ping' instead of a 'crack' of the bat just isn't right.|`|tQGXW1doaa	Batters wear helmets to protect their heads from getting hit by the ball. Since pitchers are throwing the ball the most likely wont be hit by it. I think this is why pitchers do not wear helmets.

bxt511X2aa	Les Fran?ais jouent toujours mieux lorqu'ils sont à l'étranger.. ils n'ont plus de pression sur les épaules, celle de vouloir faire bonne figure devant leur public...

Et puis il n'y aurait plus de charme...|`|5288b3c382490258e60fe10b977ba6a3aa	Non, c'est quand même bien que chaque tournoi du grand chelem ait une surface spécifique (Synthétique pour l'Australie, terre battue pour Roland Garros, gazon à Winbledon et ciment aux USA)<br>  Pour les fran?ais, il y a un manque d'entrainement dès le plus jeune age sur terre battue. A l'inverse, les jeunes sud américains et espagnols s'entra?nent énormément sur terre, ce qui fait que c'est leur surface de prédilection.<br>  La terre battue est vraiment spécifique, pour que des génies du tennis comme Sampras ou Federer n'y aient jamais gagné! (Féderer peut encore espérer, quand même)|`|AtLhkbXOaa	Certainement le gazon a besoin de beaucoup d'eau.|`|c92427e566ab9d6130371d4738e28f78aa	Non!

Je crois qu'un peu plus de sportivité (entendez impartialité) serait la bienvenue sur les courts.<br>  <br>  Il réussissent bien à l'extérieur car il n'y a pas cette pression inutile.

QGF5huJgaa	I always thought they blew bringing the nWo to the WWE, but if they were to do it again, the lead heel should be HHH. By the way, I can't stand him, but in the nWo he might be interesting in Hogan's old spot. He could have Nash and Hall as enforcers and Batista and Randy Orton should be in it.

O2mZhhwEaa	yes, "hard pace for the first 400 and sprint the lst 400" would be the be the way to go. and to pace would be to keep up with the others but not to put all your energy to be in front.<br>  you should wait until a bit past the 500 mark and then right when you find there is a point when most of them are tired, tke the advantage and give it all you got. chances are at that moment they wont be insired to chase after you because they have been putting it all out being in front so that would give you the head up on the race..<br>  <br>  Hpe i helped,<br>   <br>  experienced fellow racer

Both competitions are now geared to the larger clubs in Europe with huge squads. Bring back the old European cup where you had proper cup teams like Malmo etc in the final!!|`|Y8rB9iuHaa	It was a good competition, but only because football itself still displayed notions such as sportsmanship, decency, loyalty and moral rigour when it was in existence.<br>  <br>  Football today is all about money, greed, lying, cheating and cheap notoriety.<br>  <br>  I know your point is to have a dig at Arsenal... (I am  Liverpool fan)... but if new ideas are the loss of ethical behaviour?... must we always move with the times...?
23qMl5LXaa	Forget the tatoo. That will mark down a ton. Wear exactly what they told you to, and bring a bow along to see what everyone else is wearing. Shoes at the time are not to worry. Get those later when you make the team. Don't waste money. Just wear some plain old white sneakers that are comfy and you can maneuver in. You just need to wear the basics.

fKAnnQeWaa	What Alou said was completely right. The Netherlands won that game by the help of an error. Think about it, other than the error, would the Netherlands had won that game? It isn't disrespect. It's analyzing the truth. <br>  <br>  I think that Alou was referring to Hanley's throwing error. Not the Netherlands.<br>  <br>  Edit: Wow, I just finished watching the game versus Panama and what Alou said came true, with an exception to it. Panama was the team they were suppose to beat 9-0, which they did, not the Netherlands. I agree with you on him being rude though.|`|0VbAMZccaa	me|`|Rz9vY53Aaa	i do|`|BFOOOzwBaa	thats a funny ? but messed up i didnt read wut u put but i wanna tell u something about wut u said to my ? i no tos aint good i no he has a bad team but the year he won his ring he did have a good team and he averaged 27.6 or .4 ppg and thats good no matter whos on his team and its no that i dislik lebron its just to many people on his tip or in other words on his case that they forget about al the other good players like d-wade but dont get me wrong i d-wade is my fav u no that but little do u no i watch lebron and i noticed that the team revolves around lebron trust me if you watch closely ull see what i mean for ex they shoot right after he gives the ball up and you would notice lebron is a forward playing a POINT guard position hes the onthe forward with them assist and wut i was saying is that d-wade wasnt giving it his all like every one else but win u drew blood he kicked it up to 500% and i from the comment you left i would say u liked lebron because u had nothing to say about kobe and he may lead the league in the most turnovers but its just because he has to be the best defender on his team which is no his job(center/forwards job) and be the point guard he originally was his rookie year in order to take his team to the playoffs and no disrespect and not to sound cocky but i would say i no a little more about basketball then you do|`|vY0ScgeXaa	if i didn't live in florida for 2 yrs, i dont even know what dominican republic is, by the way i do know a girl whose white mother married a dominican republic warlord's son or something, they were persecuted and immigrated to the united states, the son joined the navy and met the tall blonde girl and married her, thats how the girl i know was born.
H3nbC71eaa	WQ: Yeah, there's been plenty of those. Sometimes either the wrestlers don't think or are still too immature to know how to reach success. Brian Kendrick is a good example. Paul London had backstage issues and he's gone. MVP had an attitude backstage and went on that long losing streak. Jeff Hardy could've been World Champ long before he was but his drug issues held him back for quite a while. So there's been many.<br>  <br>  Also, RVD and Sabu were going to be stars in ECW after McMahon started airing it under his company. ECW was going to be somewhat extreme, not like the original but something like it, and RVD and Sabu get caught smoking pot and with pot on them while driving around somewhere in Ohio. McMahon then decided to change up the format of ECW, afraid that the original ECW wrestlers were going to be doing drugs and stuff. RVD then dropped the title to Big Show...the show hasn't been the same since. Though it's become something a bit different now..not that bad.<br>  <br>  <br>  WQ2: I'll say Dynamite Kid..he had some backstage issues while with the WWF, a phenomenal wrestler who was a big influence on Chris Benoit's wrestling style, but never made it in the WWF because of his issues. Though he wound up doing ok wrestling in Japan.|`|a6cb15fd4b323dbc753a289a5e6f7a87aa	I agree, like Shelton Benjamin has so much talent.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Your question was wanted in Astronomy because it had "Stars" in it.|`|9x1w6Tg0aa	TBK?|`|VENyKvgaaa	yea Brian Kendrick should win a world title|`|UbUSth5haa	My Top 3<br>  Shelton Benjamin has all the potential in the world but isn't using it<br>  John Morrison could very well be a multiple time World Champion, but he is letting Miz ride his coattails, he should be moved away from ECW to SD!<br>  Cody Rhodes is doing great with Legacy but when the group evaporates I see a great singles wrestler|`|Ofn6NXKxaa	This is a pretty easy question,<br>  <br>  I think Mr. Kennedy has all the potential needed to be on the top of WWE, but due to his injuries and behaviors, WWE is not pushing him.|`|QV3YfVcBaa	I know this probably has nothing to do with your question but it was sad when hbk lost his match at wrestle mania.|`|UWJinEbIaa	Paul London either quit or got fired for the same behavior.  They were long term tag champions but all they did was work house shows and were never "featured" stars of Smackdown or WWE....|`|oAjbBLDpaa	Great point about Kendrick.<br>  Maybe MVP could be considered an example? I heard that he got into that huge losing streak because of his insulting of a drug tester.<br>  <br>  Jake "the Snake" Roberts had plenty of potential with his great in-ring psychology but his personal problems and demons kept him from the top.
8bTder08aa	Santa Anita installed the synthetic surface in response to a mandate by the California Horse Racing Board for all licensed pari-mutuel racetracks that conducted race meets other than the county fair circuit to replace their dirt tracks with synthetic surfaces.  <a href="http://www.chrb.ca.gov/press_releases/2006_05_25_press_release.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.chrb.ca.gov/press_releases/20...</a><br>  <br>  This came about after a number of high-profile breakdowns of racehorses, including the breakdown of Barbaro in the 2006 Kentucky Derby.  While Santa Anita agreed to the mandate-- it had to-- track officials would have liked more time to comply.  They disastrously installed a surface manufactured by Cushion Track that had drainage and other problems that cost them some racing days, then removed that surface and installed a new surface by Pro-Ride, which is still being "fine-tuned" by the Santa Anita management and the Pro-Ride support staff.<br>  <br>  Even with our climate, we can't go to an all-grass format, because racing is conducted over the Santa Anita track more than 150 days out of the year, plus year-around training.  The turf track couldn't hold up to 9 races over the track that many days a year and all the training over it in the morning.  <br>  <br>  Places like England where racing is conducted primarily on turf hold very short race-meets, no more than a few days at a time, and horses don't train over the track surface.  The turf on those tracks has lots of time to recover from the beating it takes during race meets.  That would not be the case at Santa Anita or any other American track.<br>  <br>  Also, Santa Anita is geographically located in an area that is, rainfall-wise, a desert.  The track has to be constantly watered to keep the turf healthy.  Several times since the drought of 1977, we've had low-rainfall years when water conservation measures were enacted.  There's a real fear that a severe drought might cause the temporary closure of the turf courses at the Southern California racetracks.  (Part of the selling point for the synthetic tracks was that they wouldn't need as much watering as the dirt tracks, resulting in a substantial savings in water costs.  The jury is still out on this.)<br>  <br>  This whole question may be moot what with Magna Entertainment Corporation, the owner of Santa Anita and a bunch of other racetracks, filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy.  It is entirely within the realm of possibility that there will be NO Santa Anita racetrack in the next couple of years, that the property will be sold for development and a great historic racetrack will join other tracks that have been plowed under for development.  Tough times ahead for the MEC-owned racetracks.  Sad.|`|zywy6vOGaa	America should change all their tracks to turf. Its alot safer, less bias but not only that the only other country that uses mainly dirt is Dubai which is only on one month of the year. And hopefully it will be proven again in the following month that the turf horses are just as good as the dirt horses on dirt while dirt horses can't transit to turf. Which is a big problem for the US, cause they can't travel to much and prove their horses against the world.<br>  <br>  Its biased that the best horses in world are horses from the US, the Europeans proved in last years breeders cup meeting that there are better horses. And I'd like to see a horse from the US come over to Australia and win one of our big races, while horses that don't do well here can go over there and win. The latest case being Red Arrow.<br>  <br>  The American's breeding market will be much better if they bred more  turf horses because they'll get alot more overseas owners wanting buy, which means higher clearance and more money.<br>  <br>  Also all racing industries around the world are in trouble. But I would say the US has the worst industry, while the best industries are Australia, Hong Kong and Singapore, and there all turf tracks!<br>  <br>  Alot of people probably disagree with me, but thats my thoughts on the matter or dirt vs turf.|`|tJRxQjdtaa	Because then they would HAVE to give up the Santa Anita Derby, which is their biggest race of the season and also a KenDerby prep race. If they change it to the all surface or the synthetic track, it is still considered a dirt track, and therefore dirt races could be held. It would be a waste of money to have two turf tracks.

9NRyeif9aa	I Disagree.you see Rey Mysterio is one of the Veterans in the WWE. the guy is Poetry in Motion.talking about Educated Feet.Rey has it. even though he's not the BEST High Flyer.but he's ONE OF THE BEST High Flyers in Pro Wrestling.in fact he's even a better wrestler than Batista,Cena and Khali.he's even better than Jeff Hardy though (just like what the Sharkhead guy said) the Kids love him! because he has Charisma,He's Talented and he has wrestling skills homeboy.<br>  <br>  Rey Mysterio deserves a Major Title run.just like Kane.he's not getting a HUGE Push on Raw.back at No Way Out,he's just One step closer for being the 2nd time World Champion.unfortunately,Edge was the predicted and expected winner at that time.so for me,Rey Needs to be in the MITB or Feud against the Intercontinental Title.in fact,he's more deserving than Henry's spot in the MITB.i wouldn't be surprised if Rey Mysterio wins another Major Title this 2009.|`|EZf00NJJaa	Rey will be on the card .<br>  <br>  ===<br>  3 possibilities .<br>  <br>  1.

I want him to be the WWE champion or World Heavyweight Champion again he was soooo close in the Elimination Chamber but that damn Edge had to cheat..............again uhhhg.|`|b7JS16dyaa	I think he should be in the MITB instead of Mark Henry, but I don't know why people would want him away from Wrestlemania. He shined in the recent Elimination Chamber, and he has a huge fanbase, so if he isn't there, most of his young fans would probably be pretty disappointed.<br>  <br>  He still has a chance of being in the match though.|`|4eQqTiYwaa	well , i believe he deserves a match at wrestlemania , hes really the only little man that wwe give a good go|`|6ueL0gkAaa	I dont mind Mysterio and never have. People need to realize hes not as young as he used to be, so hes toned down alot of the moves he used to do in WCW and ECW to prevent injury. I think he deserves a Mania match.|`|19KqIxWjaa	I'm not sure, but some people think he is too small. He may be small, but he has 20x more talent than Cena, Jeff Hardy, & Khali combined.

b299b6f7ae59c5434e4f37421a123123aa	If you have a look at Stewarts win percentage against his stack rate you will find that when Stewart does not stack he wins, but when he stacks he is unable to come back from it and he stacks a lot.  <br>  <br>  The point system does what it is meant to do and you get good points for a win and if you don't and are back in the pack you don't get good points.

HBK was being looked at a lot many years ago when Ted Turner still owned WCW. Bischoff (at the backing of Nash and Hall) made numerous offers to HBK.

Yg1QR4mmaa	I think this fight would of been very interesting to see but I see this fight going the same way as the Ted Kid Lewis fight, minus the referee distraction. I see Marcel swarming Carpentier and winning most of the rounds before being dropped by a sneaky right hand and stopped as a consequence. Carpentier is just too big and too good a right hand puncher for the smaller Cerdan to leave the fight on his feet.<br>  <br>  My pick is Carpantier by late round KO.|`|Fx2lB9LYaa	carpentier was a light heavy marcel cerdan a middleweight i would think capentier would have the advantage|`|dh48AkbCaa	going against the grain, i pick cerdan to outpoint carpentier and win on points|`|thcr8Y5vaa	Georges Carpentier...|`|kqP7GwOcaa	Yep, thumbs up to John T, the size advantage of Carpentier over Cerdan would have to play a heavy role.
kqP7GwOcaa	With all due respect, I consider myself a huge fan of Lennox Lewis, great guy and great champion.  There is no doubt Lennox was one of the best of his era.  That said, if Oliver McCall and Hasim Rockmon can KO Lennox, Kenny Norton would have done so as well.<br>  <br>  Ken Norton by decision in the unlikely event that Lennox could go the distance.  I think Norton would expose that fragile chin of Lewis's a lot faster than McCall or Rockmon did.|`|e2e426c7412c57bd7f104afda806b223aa	Ken Norton - Norton was tough as nails and he could take Lewis' punch. On the other hand, if Norton so much as sneezed on Lennox he would go down. Lewis doesn't have a chin, hit him solid and he falls like a deck of cards.|`|dh48AkbCaa	lewis to outpoint norton in a reletively close contest, but if this is the muscular norton who fought holmes, lewis wins it by a wider margin.|`|Fx2lB9LYaa	kenny norton connects to the chin its over  STOP COMPARING LEWIS TO ALI YOUR NOT EVEN CLOSE|`|8fa17d06395754a44604a2b42063588daa	Easy one.  Styles make fights.  Norton has everything that makes a fight easy for Lennox.  He can punch but he  would not take the chance needed to get the job done.  Like Lewis, Norton is a powerhouse who thinks like a boxer.  <br>  <br>  Believe it or not, Norton, like Evander Holyfield, is a SOLID puncher but not a very HARD puncher.  He LOOKS like a world beater but look at his KO ratio and compare it to others who's bodies DON'T look as impressive.  You will see that Ken Norton was really not as great a puncher as people seem to think upon appearence. <br>  <br>  Show me a better LOOKING boxer than Evander Holyfield in the last 30 years.  You cant.  But I can show you MANY who PUNCH HARDER.  The difference is that Holyfield takes a better punch than Norton ever did.  <br>  <br>  Ken Norton was a GOOD fighter,  Not a Great one.  He held Great Company but lost to everyone of the Greats he fought.  People make much of the series with ALI but they fail to see that Norton would not have done so well had ALI never gone into exile.<br>  <br>  Lennox Lewis has everything that spells DOOM for Norton.  He would know that Norton has a Punch phobia.  Lennox isn't one to take chances but he'd survive a few shots just to get himself in range.  It wouldn't take long to figure that Norton would Rather NOT mix it up.  Lennox, now fearing little from Norton, would make his way in and force a battle in the trenches.  <br>  <br>  Here, Norton would not last very long.  His crab-like defense is effective from outside.  Lennox will have already gotten Inside.<br>  <br>  Lewis by KO in 3|`|aOSZuBM9aa	Ken Norton|`|thcr8Y5vaa	Lennox Lewis...|`|BNqbOfBsaa	I also like Lennox Lewis in the matchup. Lennox at his best knew how to take advantage of his size. and their is no way that Norton gets inside of Lewis's jab. I think he knocks him out in 8 rounds.
AA12325046	Walcott was a very clever and hard hitting heavyweight.  The first fight he had with Joe Louis, he was robbed in my opinion and deserved the decision.  Norton is famous for giving Ali his 2nd career loss.  He had a deceptive jab and good power.  I think Walcott has the speed and power advantage and Norton the better jab and definetly the size advantage.  I believe that this would have been a fun fight to watch and a close one.  Walcott hit hard enough to deck Ken in my opinion and after about 6 rounds, would connect and send Norton to the canvas.  Ken would somehow tough it out and press the action on the elusive and clever Walcott who would counter punch effectively.  I think Walcott pulls out the fight with a rally in the last few rounds and wins the decision.|`|ZPfCk0sZaa	Jersey Joe Walcott|`|Ghiy6Cwlaa	jersey in 12|`|kqP7GwOcaa	Tough call, Joe hit a little harder than Ken, and his skill level was higher, but as physical tools go, Ken Norton was as formidable as any heavyweight in history.  Ken had equal power and the conditioning to out last just about anyone.  I think Norton would have worn Walcott down and eventually imposed his will on Joe.  Walcott would have held his own in the early rounds, but Norton would have eventually got to the slicker Walcott late.<br>  <br>  Norton by decision.
kqP7GwOcaa	Agreed, I like Ellis in this one, Chris Byrd will never impress me as a heavyweight, as awkward as Chris was, he never quite reached the level of respect a true heavyweight champion should have commanded.  Ellis on the other hand was limited by the huge talent pool of the seventies, and in Byrd's era Jimmy Ellis would have dominated.  Byrd didn;t have the power to keep Ellis at bay, and much like the Klitschko's did, Ellis would have walked Byrd down.<br>  <br>  Ellis by KO inside ten rounds.|`|AA12325046	Jimmy Ellis was good enough to beat Floyd Patterson, and Jerry Quarry and would have certainly been good enough to handle Byrd in my opinion.  Ellis had the misfortune like many fighters did to have fought in the 70's with Foreman, Ali, and Frazier in the picture.  He had excellent boxing skills and would have taken Byrd to school in my opinion.  Ellis by unanimous decision.|`|ZPfCk0sZaa	Jimmy Ellis is the winner|`|dh48AkbCaa	ellis|`|Ghiy6Cwlaa	ellis in 10
I1w0HfQbaa	I like Razor Ruddock for the win by KO. Both fighters were punchers in their prime but both also suffered debilitating defeats at the hands of world-class fighters. For Cleveland, it was getting KO'd brutally by Muhammad Ali and Sonny Liston. For Ruddock, it was getting KO'd by Lennox Lewis and losing that heart-breaker to Tommy Morrison. They are both brutal knockout punchers and were feared contenders during their heyday. However, Razor is a little bit better in this one. Razor at least went the distance with Mike Tyson in the rematch and gave Tyson a helluva fight in the first fight and went seven rounds with the da' baddest man on the planet--an unheard of feat at the time. Razor also came within a hair of putting Morrison away in their shootout when he scored two knockdowns only to lose when Morrison scored that left hook in the sixth round and when Razor was getting nailed with a barrage of punches before the ref stopped it with seconds left in the sixth. Razor also scored wins over quality contenders like Phil Jackson, Michael Dokes, Bonecrusher Smith and Mike Weaver. <br>  <br>  So he is battle tested against tough fighters. Razor in his two fights with Mike Tyson distinguished himself as a feared contender. Cleveland in his two fights with Sonny Liston, well, didn't. He was also crushed with relative ease by Muhammad Ali in Ali's most efficient ruthless performance of punching power ever seen in the heavyweight division. Razor also has a better chin than Cleveland. This should be a see-saw affair but I don't think it will go to the mid-rounds because both are such concussive knockout punchers that any hook, uppercut, cross could spell lights out for the other combatant. We also have to see how well Cleveland fares in this types of fights. He was KO'd in three by Ali and KO'd in three and two respectively by Sonny Liston. So he is not going to get to the mid-rounds in this type of fight. Razor wins this slug-fest by a fourth round KO.|`|kqP7GwOcaa	I don't often disagree with Jeff Murdoch, even this answer that he gave is extremely well written and entertaining, but in my opinion there is a huge and glaring difference between losing to Ali and Liston verses losing to Tyson.  Cleveland Williams clearly faced far better competition than Donavan Ruddock, and truth be told I though Richard Steele stopped the first Tyson/Ruddock fight prematurely, Ruddick was in it and giving Tyson trouble.  Granted Lewis pole axed Donavan, but if we are basing the comparison on level of competition, I believe Ali and Liston were far tougher than Tyson and Lewis.  Call me old school, but I have to disagree with Jeff on this one, I think Cleveland Williams would have taken Ruddick the distance and won a decision.|`|AA12325046	Cleveland Williams 78-13 (58) was a big hitting heavyweight contender as was Razor Ruddock 25-17 (14)  I believe that Williams has the better overall boxing skills and stamina.  I believe that each man would land some heavy shots early on in the fight which would bring the crowd to it's feet.  In round 9 Williams would connect with one of his devastating hooks to the jaw of Ruddock and win by knockout.|`|8fa17d06395754a44604a2b42063588daa	I don't see this fight going past 5 rounds.  These two are among the hardest punchers the division has ever known and neither is known for movement.  <br>  <br>  Williams is a better boxer but I don't see him trying to win on points.  By the time he realizes it's dangerous to trade the fight may be over.  I think it depends on how soon Big Cat realizes he has an advantage.  I'd give Ruddock the edge in power.  That's why I laugh when people claim Mike Tyson can't take a punch.  Not many in history can punch harder than Ruddock.  He's built like he was born to punch.  <br>  <br>  If Williams walks into some of the bombs Ruddock throws he will be put to sleep.  Williams punches hard too but I don't think he will realize the advantage he has in boxing.  By the time he does he will be just seconds from being KO'd<br>  <br>  Ruddock by KO in 5|`|dh48AkbCaa	williams (pre bullet wound) wins by mid round stoppage.
4432bf9b709422220cc7a44ccbf8f500aa	Archie Moore scored the most knockouts of ANY fighter, of ANY weight. . . . but I don't think that necessarily meant he had the biggest punch.  That distinction, I believe, belonged to Bob Foster.  <br>  <br>  The greatest left hook in the division's history sent everyone in the weight class to the canvas. . .and even rocked a prime Joe Frazier in their short (albeit awesome) slugfest.  Bob Foster. . . the hardest-hitting lightheavy there ever was.  <br>  <br>  A little side note about Foster:  He is still a little bit bitter that the 1960 lightheavy US Olympic representative was Clay (he thought it should have been him).  He claims that Clay was a natural heavyweight, and came down a bit in weight to make it easier on himself.  He concedes that Clay was the better fighter, but that the US team had gotten another gold medal that year if only Clay had fought heavy, and Foster had fought lightheavy.  And honestly, I tend to believe him.<br>  <br>  ***I'm not sure that using the fact that Moorer also was able to land two heavy titles lends any credence to how big a hitter he was as a lightheavy.  Roy Jones' accomplishments as a middleweight aren't used to calculate his greatness as a lightheavy, are they?|`|AA12325046	In my opinion among the fighters that at one time fought as light heavyweights in boxing history, the biggest hitter was Ezzard Charles.  As a light heavyweight, he was very dangerous.  Not to say he wan't as a heavyweight too, but more deadly as light heavyweight.  Michael Moorer was also a big hitting light heavyweight that also had success as a heavyweight too, but I just believe he's a notch below Charles.  I consider Bob Foster the heaviest hitting light heavyweight champ of all time.  All you have to see is what he done to Tiger and Mike Quarry as testement to his power and of course Archie Moore knocked out more fighters than anyone in boxing history so his name must be mentioned here too.  So here is my rankings as the hardest hitting light heavyweights:<br>  <br>  1.  Ezzard Charles<br>  2.  Michael Moorer<br>  3.  Bob Foster<br>  4.  Archie Moore<br>  5.  Young Stribling ( heavyweight that fought at 172 lbs)<br>  6.  Michael Spinks|`|dh48AkbCaa	bob foster.|`|Eg4K2zP1aa	archie moore !!!|`|cLfZVQHEaa	It's either Bob Foster or Archie Moore.|`|Ghiy6Cwlaa	arche moore with 143 kos|`|kqP7GwOcaa	I honestly think that  Michael Moorer was as hard a puncher at 175lbs as Archie Moore.  I realize that Archie was a gifted and accomplished fighter, with a distinguished hall of fame career.  But truth be told, Moorer doesn't get the credit he deserves, he was one of, if not the hardest hitting light heavyweights in the history of that division.  The fact that he was the first southpaw heavyweight champion of the world doesn't hurt the argument either.  Mike had some defensive lapses and like Riddick Bowe, he wasn't exactly easy to motivate when it came to training, but there was no question that his punching power was world class.  I think both Moore and Moorer were superior punchers than Bob Foster, and the argument will never really end.<br>  <br>  My pick for the biggest hitter in light heavyweight history is Michael Moorer, he KOed every single Lightheavy weight he ever faced, then went on to win the heavyweight title, twice, a feat neither Moore nor Foster was able to accomplish in their storied careers.
I1w0HfQbaa	Jimmy Young for the win by unanimous decision. Jimmy Young was a great boxer who has been in it with the greats in the Heavyweight division when the division was at its very best in the 1970's. He has given the greats like Muhammad Ali, Ken Norton and George Foreman some incredibly tough and close fights. And anyone who can out-box and out-fight Foreman and his punching power over the course of twelve rounds without missing a beat is good enough to out-box stiff Frank Bruno. Anyone who was top-ranked during the golden era of the heavyweight division is more than good enough to outbox Bruno. Also Young has a superb chin and even when he was past his prime he was still rather tough and could go the distance with the top ranked heavyweights of the 1980's such as Tony Tucker, Tony Tubbs and Greg Page. <br>  <br>  Frank Bruno is a stiff with poor movement, mediocre survival instincts, and a weak chin. He was a protected commodity for the duration of his career. He was KO'd in eleven by Tim Witherspoon; KO'd in eleven by Bonecrusher Smith; KO'd by Lennox Lewis in seven. To his credit, he did put forth a good effort in those fights and did his best to win which is why against a top ranked heavyweight from the 1970's this is going to be nowhere good enough. Jimmy Young is not a  puncher so the danger of Frank getting knocked out is pretty slim in this fight. But you never know with Frank Bruno. But as average as Bruno is my money is on his staying the course of the twelve rounds. Young wins every round of this fight and shuts out Bruno over the course of twelve one sided rounds.|`|Ghiy6Cwlaa	jimmy wins in10|`|kqP7GwOcaa	Thumbs up to Jeff Murdoch, I cannot improve on his answer.  As for comparing and discussing the merit of two fighters of different eras, it is one of a boxing fan's great joys, the guy who insulted your questions is a meatball.  You and toughguy are famous at yahoo answers for some of history's most spectacular comparison's and I am a huge fan of both of you.  Keep up the good work, conversation and comparison of fighters past and present is the reason this site exists, you sir are along with toughguy are among the best and brightest, keep up the good work.  It is a privilege and a joy to read and respond to such questions.  It is an unfortunate aspect of an open site that trolls sometimes visit it as well, and Jordan S is entitled to his opinion, even if he is dead wrong.  <br>  <br>  Jimmy Young by unanimous decision over Bruno.|`|AA12325046	I remember Jimmy Young as the man that made big George Foreman want to retire after defeating him in a big upset, the man that gave Ali all he wanted during their title fight that many thought he deserved to win and an excellent boxer and defensive fighter.  He didn't have a lot of power but was very clever in the ring.  Bruno was a strong, hard hitting, but rather mechanical fighter that was one of the first fighters to ring the bell of Mike Tyson and gave Lennox Lewis a beating before Lewis landing a big shot to turn the fight around.  I believe that Young would have been too smart for the plodding Bruno and won an easy decision in my opinion.|`|V7lGsaR8aa	In the UK we have a very old radio commentator called Jimmy Young , and if that's the one you are on about i would back Young . Bruno was useless built up by our press , a big hitter if the opponent would just stand still .|`|dh48AkbCaa	young beat foreman & lyle, so unless bruno stops young by the fifth, young takes it.|`|8fa17d06395754a44604a2b42063588daa	Frank Bruno is awfully slow.  His best chance would be to somehow corner Young and pound away.  The big problem here is that some fighters are very strong but don't know how to make the best of the power they have.  Bruno is such a fighter.  <br>  <br>  It's hard to explain how a man as strong as Bruno can fail to use the power he has to it's best potential.  Even up close I don't think Bruno would seriously hurt Young because he just doesn't know how to punch properly in order to get the best of his power.<br>  <br>  In the meantime, Jimmy Young would figure out that Frank, despite his mass, can't seriously hurt him.  He might not even fully understand why Frank can't hurt him.  It wouldn't matter.<br>  <br>  The early rounds are more of a feeling out process with Jimmy keeping a save distance.  After a while he takes a few chances and learns that Frank doesn't punch as hard as it would appear.  At that point Young begins planting his feet and walking through some of Bruno's punches.  He wouldn't just take them but he would not make as great an effort to avoid them either.  Bruno is not difficult to avoid.<br>  <br>  Young by TKO in 13
AA12325046	First of all Larry F must have forgotten that Manny fought at lighter weights too including as you said, featherweight.<br>  <br>  Saldivar is one of the most underrated smaller fighters in boxing history in my opinion.  He beat Sugar Ramos, Howard Winstone, Ismael Laguna, and Jose Legra.  He had good punching power and good speed.  Pacquiao has proven to be one of the best fighters of this generation and has improved greatly since he started fighting.  He throws a tremendous amount of punches and has good power and toughness.  Both men are southpaws which nullifies any advantage there.  I believe that Manny is a little stronger and would impose his will in this fight.  Saldivar would have moments in this fight and would hold his own.  Pacquiao would land the more effective punches and capture a close decision victory.|`|cLfZVQHEaa	are you nuts???<br>  <br>  It's 12 rounds, 15 rounds is extinct!!!<br>  <br>  Manny is already a welterweight!!<br>  <br>  No chance for this fight to happen!<br>  <br>  Next question!<br>  <br>  If they did fight, it's Manny all the way!!!|`|dh48AkbCaa	two southpaws do not always make for an exiting fight, but this could be an exception.<br>  <br>  i go with manny by the closest of margins because of a higher workrate.|`|wNxADbnYaa	Manny Pacquiao<br>  go Pacman!!|`|Ghiy6Cwlaa	pacman in 14|`|kqP7GwOcaa	Thumbs up to maurice, I too see Pacquiao winning a decision.  Level of competition and power are both big edges to Manny, and recently Pacquiao has improved his boxing ability significantly.  Salvidar would be out gunned.
AA12325046	The Cuban Hawk vs Hands of Stone.  Great matchup!  Gavillan fought and beat some of the best fighters of his era.  He beat such men as Chuck Davey, Billy Graham, Ike Williams, and Beau Jack.  He was a tricky fighter known for his famous bolo punch.  He didn't have great power, but had an iron chin, never having been knocked out in his long career.  Duran made his name as a lightweight of course but also won the welterweight title.  He fought and beat such men as Sugar Ray Leonard, Esteban DeJesus, Pipino Cuevas, Davey Moore, and Carlos Palomino in his great career,  He was a hard hitting fighter and a very clever counter punching boxer as well.  I believe the diffference in this fight would be the power and aggressiveness of Duran. Gavilan would have gave Duran some problems with his speed and footwork but not enough to offset the aggressiveness of Duran who would land the harder shots.  The decision would go to Duran in a very entertaining fight.|`|dh48AkbCaa	duran, but it will be razor close. <br>  gavilan was slick, and tough, but duran edges it in a great fight.|`|cLfZVQHEaa	Roberto Duran all the way, he was an absolute force for anyone to handle!|`|Ghiy6Cwlaa	duran by split decision|`|kqP7GwOcaa	I don't often disagree with maurice, but there is no doubt that Duran would have dominated Kid Gavalin, I don't think it would even be close.  If Gavalin was lucky enough to survive to the final bell, Duran would walk away with an easy decision.
cLfZVQHEaa	Baer may have been champion, but Quarry was one of the best in the GOLDEN AGE of the heavyweight division, the late 60's and 70's. Quarry just faced two fighters from another dimension, Ali, and Frazier. If not for them, and Foreman, Quarry would have been a great champion.<br>  <br>  Quarry would definitely WHOOP Bear's ***!!!|`|AA12325046	Max  could have been one of the greatest of all time had he taken boxing and training more seriously.  He liked to chase women, party, and in the ring wasn't always focused losing some fights he probably should have won.  One thing he did have though was great punching power especially in his right hand.  Jerry Quarry fought in an era with the likes of Frazier and Ali that quite possibly prevented him from being heavyweight champ.  He had good power and good boxing skills.  One of his major weaknesses was his propensity to cuts.  Baer is the bigger man in height and weight and Quarry has the advantage in speed and boxing skills.  Baer has the power edge though Jerry is no slouch himself.  Baer would attempt to press the action and Quarry would fight smartly countering Baer's wild swinging punches effectively.  Baer would have some moments and even stagger Jerry a few times, but would be unable to follow it up.  Quarry would land the higher volume of punches and take the unanimous decision.|`|8Sw8rJgtaa	The problem i have with Quarry is that he took a lot of punches flush.Fighting Baer in that way would be very dangerous.I think Baer would be able to handle Quarry with his size advantage and reach.Quarry was skilled but Max was no slouch.Max beat Schmelling,who i believe to be a better boxer than Quarry.Baer would have had an easier time with Jerry,because it was easier to land a clean shot on him.I don't think Quarry could stand to many right hands from Baer for to long.As the fight goes on Quarry would deteriorate from all the heavy blows.Baer would get him against the ropes and unload.Baer by T.K.O. in the 9th.|`|dh48AkbCaa	baer, in shape and motivated, takes it....but if max takes the fight lightly, then jerry beats him.|`|Ghiy6Cwlaa	max in 5|`|kqP7GwOcaa	Thumbs up to Larry & maurice, Baer was as heavy a hitter as Quarry and I think this one is even money, it could go either way.  The difference is Quarry fought better competition.  I think Quarry would have taken Baer.
AA12325046	Barney Ross was one of the greatest welterweight champs in boxing history. beatin such men as Tony Canzoneri, Jimmy McLarnin, Billy Petrolle, and Ceferino Garcia.  He was a fast, and clever fighter and never knoced out in 81 fights despite the beating he took from Armstrong in his last fight,  Rodriquez was a very cagey and hard hitting fighter who had wins over fighters such as Emile Griffith, Benny Paret, Bennie Briscoe, and Denny Moyer.  As good as he was, I just believe that Ross was better.  I don't think it would be a cakewalk for either man with Ross having the advantage in speed and Rodriquez in power.  Out of the 15 rounds, I think that Ross would take 9, Rodridquez 5 and 1 even.  Ross by unanimous decision.|`|cLfZVQHEaa	Barney Ross, he was too good, only outclassed by the legendary Armstrong. Luis pales in comparison.|`|ZPfCk0sZaa	Luis Rodriguez is the winner|`|Ghiy6Cwlaa	ross in 10|`|kqP7GwOcaa	Thumbs up to Larry F, I agree Ross was superior to Rodriguez,
kqP7GwOcaa	Tough call, Curry was about as gifted an armature as boxing ever produced, but Emile Griffith had a grit and toughness that surpassed the slick boxing  Curry.  I have to agree Griffith would be a slight favorite going in, but Curry was in my opinion the better boxer of the two.  I think Donald could pull it off in twelve, but the extra three rounds would be enough for Griffith to edge him in close decision.  The difference would be that slight and Curry could conceivably win the 12 rounder but lose the 15.|`|AA12325046	This is a very even matchup.  Both had good hand speed and boxing skills with Curry the advantage in power.  I believe that Griffith could take a better shot and was a little cagier in the ring than Curry.  Griffith had some great fights with Benvenuti, Monzon, and Tiger during his career and held his own against these top notch fighters.  This would be a close and entertaining fight.  In 12 rounds it may very well be a draw, but in a 15 rounder, I think Griffith pulls out the tough decision victory.|`|dh48AkbCaa	griffith, unanimous decision.|`|Ghiy6Cwlaa	griffith in 6

FtVfuByHaa	Yes that is true and you should make sure that you are not trying to achieve more than is possible in that particular position and condition of your body. Listen to your muscles and try to stay in one position 20-40 seconds but if it feels like youre dying, your brain should tell you to stop and at that point it is not healthy stretching anymore.|`|S5fJrwGkaa	don't make your muscles do something it can't do<br>  work on flexibility gradually each day<br>  pain is not good, but soreness is normal|`|vw201sblaa	when its a mild burning, its flexing, when it becomes sharp and makes you want to screech or whatever is when its hurting pain, you dont want to stretch to a point that you cant hold that position for a good 30 seconds, because if you cant hold it for 30 seconds, your stretching too far, it would be like a scrawny guy trying to lift 1000 pounds the first time he ever lifted a weight, its gonna hurt something, ALOT. :)
mJvZhdAuaa	McMahon-Helmsley Era, for sure, mainly because currently, Triple H would have no one to reunite with (Orton is in Legacy, Flair retired, and Batista is on the bench).  I think Triple H, Stephanie and Shane will be the members of the stable.  Who else do they need, they did it the first time.|`|d9tCS7BPaa	I don't think either will return.<br>  <br>  The purpose of a stable most of the time is to push the wrestlers who are in the stable. Orton and the former member of Evolution are already established enough. This is why there is Legacy. To gain some credibility for Rhodes and DiBiase.<br>  <br>  And for the McMahon Helmsley Era...well let's hope we don't see that again. We already see enough of HHH and he already does his fair share of burying younger talent without having his wifey at his side during promos to make him seem like less of a badass than he is.<br>  <br>  I think if we see another stable pop up it will either be an entirelly new one with a few new stars mixing it up with older stars.

Gli arbitri sono esseri umani, non dovrebbero ma commettono degli errori... in generale considera che un attaccante di serie A possa commettere una decina di errori a partita (tra i vari fondamentali)... e sarebbe già bravo... ma quanti palloni realmente ha toccato? l'arbitro valuta (e quindi metaforicamente tocca) tutti i palloni della partita, più volte (una per ogni tocco di entrambe le squadre)... e poi gli errori capitano... credo che l'arbitraggio a pallavolo sia molto più difficile, e che quindi anche sotto il profilo dell'arbitraggio siamo se non un isola felice quantomeno una baia ben riparata... poi se dei singoli esseri umani sentono una qualche sudditanza (a livello giovanile succede la stessa cosa nei campionati provinciali con squadre come cuneo o macerata) è un problema da sradicare individualmente, senza coinvolgere una classe che ha molti difetti ma rende possibile praticare lo sport agonistico che noi amiamo|`|8nVfRsFGaa	Le cose sono due: o dici che facilitano il gioco della Sisley o che il volley resta lo sport più bello. Non puoi tenere un piede in due scarpe.<br>  Allora, gli errori arbitrali ci sono ovunque sia per le squadre più titolate sia per le altre. Non credo che sia uno sport dove una squadra conta più di un' altra.<br>  Probabilmente non capiti troppo spesso nei palazzetti italiani, per vedere il campionato maschile e femminile di serie A.<br>  La classe arbitrale non è quella calcistica e cerchiamo di averne rispetto.|`|VOE6zg6Uaa	gli arbitri sbagliano spessimo!anche perchè arbitrare una partita di pallavvolo di alti livelli diventa molto complicato,ci sono falli di tocco,di posizione, invasioni aeree...ecc...ecc...a cui si deve per forza prestare attenzione!se la partita è punto a punto gli errori arbitrari possono bruciare...ma la partita non è mai in mano all'arbitro a meno che la sua mancata super-partes sia palese!cmq non credo nella malafede degli arbitri di pallavvolo!poi spesso c'è un adetto che si occupa di segnalare quelli che sbagliano troppo...io ti parlo di bassi livelli,ma so che qualche arbitro ha appeso il fischietto al chiodo!quindi immagino sia lo stesso anche in categorie più alte...|`|Z8DLZVg4aa	io sono di trento gioco a pallavolo faccio servizio campo all'itas e lo tifo con tutto il mio cuore!! ho sentito via radio ieri sera la partita si sono d'accordo l'arbitraggio non era il massimo anzi!! peccato :-(
q9ic3r3Laa	Je vous donne simplement un bref aper?u de l'histoire du judo :<br>  <br>   Si les arts martiaux se développèrent de manière quasi universelle, ils n’eurent jamais un développement aussi important qu’au Japon.<br>  <br>      Les premières règles du Ju-Jitsu (art de la souplesse) furent imaginées par un vieux médecin chinois et les différentes écoles gardèrent jalousement leurs propres secrets. Différentes formes de disciplines de combat virent le jour à travers les époques utilisant différentes techniques, armes ou instruments. Vers le milieu des années 1800, on dénombrait au Japon près de 160 écoles majeures d’arts martiaux répartis en 8 familles (notamment le Ia?-Jitsu, l’A?ki-Jitsu, le Ken-Jitsu ou le Ju-Jitsu).<br>  <br>       Ces écoles, en se multipliant, évoluèrent aussi. D’arts ou de techniques, ces disciplines devinrent des voies philosophiques ou des styles de vie. La confrontation physique permet alors à chacun d’affirmer sa personnalité et d’accéder à une meilleure ma?trise de soi tout en pratiquant des techniques susceptibles d’assurer sa protection. C’est le fameux passage du Jitsu en Do. Ainsi, l’Ia?-Jitsu devint-il l’Ia?-Do, l’A?ki-Jitsu, l’A?kido, le Ken-Jitsu, le Kendo et le Ju-Jitsu, le Judo (voie de la souplesse).<br>  <br>  <br>   Le Judo<br>  <br>      C’est un universitaire et haut fonctionnaire impérial qui a créé et diffusé le judo moderne. Pénétré de traditions, il est pourtant innovateur. Intègre et idéaliste, c'est toutefois un homme habile, soucieux avant tout d’éducation et de progrès moral. Et surtout, Jigoro KANO fut rapide à saisir le dynamisme du système sportif occidental. Ce spécialiste du Ju-Jitsu, étudia sur des documents originaux l’ensemble des techniques ancestrales du Sumo et l’art des saisies (Kumi Uchi) qui aboutira au travail primordial du Kumi Kata (les prises) en judo. Au décès de son 1er Ma?tre, Ma?tre FUKUDA, il entre à l’école Kito-Ryu où il découvre sa propre méthode qui repose sur l’utilisation efficace de l’énergie. De toutes ses recherches et synthèses, il décida de créer son propre dojo (salle de pratique) en 1882. Ce dojo comptait alors 12 tatamis (tapis de judo) et 9 disciples. Il nomma cette école le KODOKAN.<br>  <br>  Le premier Kodokan<br>  <br>       La réputation de l’école ne tarda pas à se propager grace aux nombreuses victoires remportées contre les autres écoles. Le dojo ne cessa alors de s’agrandir et de déménager. Elle passa de 12 tatamis à 167 en 7 ans. Le judo du KODOKAN fut reconnu en peu de temps et représente aujourd’hui le judo pratiqué dans le monde entier. Ceci est clairement établi dans l’article des statuts de la Fédération Internationale de Judo : ? La Fédération Internationale de Judo reconna?t comme judo celui créé par Jigoro KANO. ?.<br>  <br>  En France<br>  <br>      En France, le judo appara?t dans les années 1930 mais il se développe surtout après la 2ème guerre mondiale grace aux actions de Ma?tre KAWAISHI, Moshé FELDENKRAIS et Paul BONNET-MAURY, Président fondateur de la Fédération Fran?aise de Judo en décembre 1946.|`|20229fe76273eb48d2c233e138756770aa	la base est les samoura?s en judo et jujutsu en tous cas le reste je crois que c'est pareilles mais je ne suis pas sur|`|Px9APa5Zaa	La base : Quand on te donnes une claque, évite là !|`|f5094da33c471312021cb2eb96eb3509aa	Difficile, car les arts martiaux viennent de différents horizons, différentes cultures, et ils ne se sont ni déloppés pour les même raisons, ni forcément aux même périodes.<br>  <br>  Si le ju-jitsu, la capoeira, le viet-vo-dao, le krav-maga, le jeet kune do, le kung-fu,... sont tous des arts martiaux, ils viennent tous de pays différents (japon, amérique du sud, vietnam, israel, USA, chine,...). Certains sont dit-on, millénaires, d'autres ont été crées il y a moins de 50 ans.<br>  <br>  Dans une même région (asie, amérique,...) certains styles ont pu être importés puis transformés (ex : ju-jitsu se transformera en judo, aikido,...), d'autres sont nés subitements pour des besoins spécifiques (luttes des escaves, interdiction du combat avec armes, combat sportif, combat de rue,...).<br>  <br>  Les arts martiaux asiatiques ont une origine floue : ils étaient présents en inde au moins 6 ou 5 siècles avant JC (avec une étude des mouvements animaux), et on peut surement lier leur diffusion avec l'arrivée du boudisme en chine et la création vers 510 du Chan/Zen par Bodhidharma (cf légende des moines Shaolin).<br>  Japon & Chine ont longtemps été des zones de combats claniques instables, où la population n'avait que peu de moyens de se défendre, aussi, l'apprentissage de techniques (jutsu) se développera bien avant l'apparition d'écoles et de styles bien définis où le pratiquant suit une voie (do).<br>  La majorité des styles japonais sont nés après 1500.<br>  <br>  Cf sources pour plus d'infos (un résumé est difficile).|`|aa8320f3ec4479d8ae69f07ed1ce1d01aa	Cette question a été évoquée ici :<br>  <a href="http://fr.answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20070707071820AAVeMNO">http://fr.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...</a>|`|Ekcbd3pyaa	Petite précision. à la différence des autres disciplines le judo n'est pas un art martial. Jigoro Kano a créé un sport de combat. Sport authentique qui fera son apparition aux jeux olympiques dès 1964.

However, no creative plans have been made. Hogan reportedly pitched the idea of working a match against John Cena. <br>  <br>  Stone Cold has also been rumored working a match against Hulk Hogan, but Hogan has had back issued recently and may be unable to work. Austin is prominently featured in WrestleMania 25 advertisements so I think he will at least appear on the show, the night after he is inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame. <br>  <br>  <br>  Plans for Chris Jericho are still up in the air but i was told it will involve the angle with the legends.

Something involving Maryse/McCool may happen too. <br>  <br>  JBL was also scheduled win the IC title from CM Punk in the coming weeks, but due to the script being leaked, that may now have changed, but JBL was planned to make history by having the IC defended at WM<br>  <br>  These are the plans as of now, but Vince has been described as being "obsessed" with keeping things from leaking (see No Way out - using a curtain over the chamber pre=show to prevent knowledge of Edge being in both chambers) Plus plans change all the time, but these are what are known now.<br>  <br>  <br>  If you haven’t already, sign up to swag bucks and WIN SWAGS and FREE PRIZES<br>  <br>  <a href="http://mywwesearch.swagbucks.com/?cmd=sb-register&rb=145837" rel="nofollow">http://mywwesearch.swagbucks.com/?cmd=sb...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  Hope this helps|`|jJCBGGHbaa	*This is not a prediction*<br>  *MATCH SPOILERS*<br>  <br>  1.

The Ravens have the same caliber defense they had in 2000 when they beat the Giants.  <br>  <br>  Go Cowboys (this week)<br>  go STEELERS (every day)|`|5634ea0b363c54045b18dbd8c10fee15aa	Root for the Cowboys so they can get to the playoffs because the Ravens have a better chance. I root for the Steelers, so seeing them beat the Cowboys again will be fun.<br>  <br>  (btw the refs just do their job, if you don't like the rules, I guess you can write to the NFL)|`|MFF61HvDaa	The Raisins, that's a good one.<br>  I'm rooting for a tie, then the season-ending game between the Cowboys and Eagles will be very interesting, the Eagles have a tie also.|`|kH8yYBAcaa	its totally up to you who you choose to root for. but on the otherhand, who says that you have to root for anyone? why not just watch the game without ties to either team?|`|DUo1Xh8gaa	You're the man, I agree with you 100%.  As far as NFC root for Philadelphia, Tampa Bay, Atlanta and Chicago.  AFC root for Miami, New England and San Diego.  These teams are still in the wild card hunt.|`|2AkilKwlaa	well, if Baltimore wins, they not only throw a wrench in Dallas's playoff hopes, but they also screw up my other least favorite team's chances, the pats. so baltimore|`|uoEfoI7aaa	COWBOYS!!!!!!!!!!|`|bnV6ApLNaa	Sounds like the Cowboys would help you out more because if they win then the Steelers and Refs won't have to screw the Ravens out of another game in the playoff. <br>  Give me all the thumbs down you want we all know the refs help the Stealers win. This should be the correct spelling for that team. <br>  I am not a Ravens fan either, I can't stand them, but the truth is the truth.|`|fhI6GGWBaa	The lesser of two evils eh....I hate both but I'd cheer for the Team that can help your Team in the standings the most. I'm rooting that T.O. gets hit in the mouth and has to get it wired shut so we don't have to listen to him anymore.|`|KN6h1PZVaa	i hope the ravens win. im a steelers fan and would love to see the ravens in the playoffs. the ravens havent beat a good team all year! their nothing but whinny bit*hes!!! 3-0 vs. the ravens this year? sounds great to me!|`|c6LjXDPOaa	Well i hate both teams too especially the cowboys since im a giants fan.Defenitly root for a tie,maybe they can pull off a phily v bengal game lol.|`|gS4efDjgaa	im a big steelers fan too. but i hate the cowboys because they have owens{he is such a poor sport} so i would go for ravens|`|7DYDVWzYaa	in that game, go for baltimore to beat dallas so the cowboys possibly miss out on the playoffs.|`|Tb3jlpTAaa	im a redskin fan but i think u should root for the cowboys because they are in a different coference|`|Z2K2eZGvaa	root for ravens..... cowboys are a disgrace too the nfl|`|SPC6a6h1aa	Dont watch the game. Plain and simple.|`|VCu5mQh3aa	UMM NOBODY I GUESS!|`|fHxpycJSaa	My advice is, never root for the Cowboys, even if they're playing Iraq.|`|YmLezz03aa	a tie would be great. <br>  giants fan|`|8juUgSK2aa	its on nfl network so you wont be able to watch it anyway. Really it doesn't matter who you "root" for. So put away the pom poms and go out and do something instead of rotting away in front of your TV|`|58TDAT1zaa	Pull for the Ravens since you know the Cowboys will be one and done assuming they make the play offs anyway.|`|njLVIp55aa	To bad the game is on Saturday...smart guy!!! <br>  <br>  Go Ravens!!|`|WaaFCtuOaa	These are the two teams I dislike the most, but would rather see the Cowboys lose

3DnX9NmAaa	The official belt system goes white, green, then black. At least that's how Hatsumi Soke does it. Some dojo may do it differently, but my dojo teaches the way Soke does. Mukyu (10th kyu) is a white belt, 9th kyu through 1st kyu is a green belt, and shodan (1st degree) through jugodan (15th degree) are black belts.<br>  <br>  There is no set time limit to how fast you progress. It depends on how fast you learn and your teacher. It's a lifelong martial art, so don't expect to get to black belt in a mere 4 years. I know a guy who has been training in Bujinkan since 2001 and is still a 5th kyu (and he's very good!). It's just that our shidoshi is strict about belt promotions. Belt promotions are usually few and far in between. What really weeds out the men from the boys is the godan (5th degree black belt) test. Where the Soke himself tests you and he decides whether you deserve your rank.<br>  <br>  Bujinkan belt promotions can take anywhere from one month to several years to get. If you train regularly, you could probably get your shodan in 8-10 years. Then the real training begins.<br>  <br>  Nothing is given to you in Bujinkan Budo Taijutsu. It's a combat martial art and the color of our belts are the least of our concerns.|`|1fac5a761af3a94ccdce3f25d3999768aa	Hi there<br>  <br>  Youre going to open a big can of worms with this one my friend!<br>  <br>  Basically there are 10 kyu ranks, 10 dan grades and another 5 more dan grades taking it to 15 but i must stress that these are just 5 additional levels to the 10th dan.<br>  <br>  As for gradings well there is no set sylibus and you will find it varies between clubs as to what you have to do for your grades. There is a major problem with quality control in the west! That doesnt mean that there arent some good shidoshi out there! It just means you have to put some work in to find them. Bujinkan when trained correctly has very little to do with ninjutsu and its more about a malgamation of movement from 6 other jutsu arts! If anything its more like aikido and jujutsu than anything else. Keep well clear of the ninja nutters who tuck their tabi into their gi bottoms. These type of people are plonkers! <br>  <br>  A good shidoshi will expect you to learn taihen jutsu, kihon happon, a selection of ryu ha kata plus the weapons forms for your grades. If all you are being shown is henka of the kihon happo then i would look else where! <br>  <br>  Here is a rough kata list as to what you should be learning!<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.mbdojo.com/ryukata.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.mbdojo.com/ryukata.html</a><br>  <br>  As a rule only 5th dan and above can teach but lower dan grades may also instruct under their supervision. Both must hold shidoshi ho and shidoshi kai lisence that are isssued by the hombu and all 5th dans are graded by hatsumi.<br>  <br>  All documentation such as membership, certificates, instructors lisences etc must ALL be issued from the hombu in Japan! There are no western governing bodies of this art. Its a Japanese art so dont accept anything else other than these. If your instructor cant get hold of them then they simply arent a registered shidoshi!<br>  <br>  Theres a lot of crap and silly people out there in bujin land and some of them i feel sorry for. But amongst the rubbish  are some really great shidoshi. Many of them hold dan grades in other arts but choose to teach bujin! Your biggest challenge is to find one!<br>  <br>  Dont settle for Sh&ty ninja wanabe instructors! Find the ones that know their taijutsu!<br>  <br>  <br>  Best wishes<br>  <br>  idai|`|LnJjS8BRaa	They vary somewhat but the basic system goes green belt, red belt black belt. You might start with a white but it'll depend on the school.<br>  <br>  Each rank will be indicated by patches or badges you earn instead of many more belts.<br>  <br>  I've read that in some places you're either red or green depending on whether you're male or female. From there you earn the aforementioned badges until black belt. Again, the order of progression can vary from club to club and I'm going by what I've read rather than first hand experience.<br>  <br>  Testing is more up to the instructor. Some have a set day each month, some will test you when they feel you're ready. <br>  <br>  From black belt there are 15 additional degrees you can earn.<br>  <br>  That's about all I've heard about the ranking. The style looks interesting if it's taught well but I've heard negative things about it's consistency for quality. Good luck.
XZTwrn2Qaa	Smith  never had a chance|`|15wwA3jjaa	I personally think Alex Smith got the very short end of the stick in San Francisco.  The kid was thrown to the wolves in 05 and never really got the opportunity to grow as a quarterback, hell he had a different offensive coordinator every season he started.  Honestly, I think if he wins the starting job back this season, we are going to see a whole new player under center for the 49ers.  Hell you could've put Peyton Manning on that team and he wouldn't have fared much better than Smith in my opinion.|`|gBfPkdroaa	haha, im sure he has.<br>  <br>  i like the 9ers, but im a SD fan but i have to say, smith was quiet a bust, and so was lawson (kinda)<br>  <br>  but shaun hill is def. stepping up his game|`|DPlJiWyWaa	Interesting question.  Just to think, Rodgers would've been still the guy on the bench while Favre was deciding what to do, this time last year.  Now he's the starter and looks damn impressive if you ask me.  Alex Smith I always felt was decent, he obviously was in College but the NFL hasn't done wonders for him.  Rodgers is going to do well I think.|`|C8v47HIGaa	Honestly neither quarterback was ready to be thrown in the fire as a rookie. if the 49ers drafted Aaron and he went in there to start from day one he would be in the same situation Alex Smith finds himself in today. he very much so needed to sit behind a HOF qb and learn the league and the Green Bay Packers, and I am so glad we gave hit that chance. he'll be a Pro Bowler next year as we win the North. =)|`|Sb93dIXbaa	The difference is Alex Smith was thrown to the wolves from day one and had to scramble for his life behind a weak offensive line and Aaron Rodgers had time to groom himself for a couple of years behind Brett Farve. Lets see what happens this year if Alex Smith gets a chance to play behind Shauwn Hill.|`|7dd92fa9e1fedaa65abe9b3824b3fba3aa	I don't think he feels that TOWARD Smith but I do believe he feels satisfaction that all the TEAMS that passed on him, especially the 49ers feel like they made the wrong decision.|`|YoqkRaY0aa	go 49ers.

I work as a Pschyc Tech at the Napa State Hospital were I am constantly being attacked by the criminaly and mentally insane. Aikido is bassically a mixture of Grappling, Judo, and Jui-Jitsu. It is very good at taking people to the ground quickly, and then getting them in a pin or joint lock. It is perfect for what I do because Im not really trying to hurt anyone seriuosly, and want to take them down fast and efficiently. I also think that BJJ is good, it just wouldnt work well at my job because Im not trying to seriously injure my patients.

uuHrf7cGaa	I agree that the pitches in sub-continent India are mostly flat with little bit of grass depending on what the team composition is. The pitches are built to favor spinners because that is what India, SL, Pak to an extent and BD has relied upon. Pak is slightly different as they have very capable pace bowlers - more accurately swing bowlers and they have tendency to swing the ball(the art of it) and make use of reverse swing.<br>  <br>  Coming to Rosbif - I hope we are not going to start an all out war. Admittedly that some of the great bowlers have cheated by tampering the ball - that does not make it a valid statement or cheats. It is human nature to force things to happen in your favor and be a hero. He claims that Imran was the teacher - how wrong is he? The swing master was Sarfaraz Nawaz - he was the articulate of Pak swing bowling and later it was taken by Imran. Imran was so confident that he would ask Sarfaraz to pick the new ball and he was the master of it knowing which ball gives the best possibility of swing. Imran learnt these things from Sarfaraz and then he took it to his Oxford univ games and to county cricket. Remember what did John Lever did? He was a cheater too only to be caught using the Vaseline. English players and others had no clue about Reverse swing - read Imran's autobio - only when they came to know about it they started to call it as "reverse swing". So just calling the swing bowlers as cheat is not right and that is my point to Rosbif. BTW - tampering the ball with in the so called legal means is allowed and hence I would not call it as cheating. <br>  Tampering of the ball continues legal or illegal - but it is matter of being caught. Every player does this to an extent. English are not good at everything - do not get me started on this - they were only good at colonizing rich countries and making them poor. Divide and conquer was their mantra.....that is all they are good at. If Pak players have done this and admitted to it - in the least they have come forward to saying this, the English players hide it and never want it reveal unless they are caught. No player is angel. But this has nothing to do with the pitch question, but I am forced to state as Rosbif makes comments about sub-continent players in an arrogant manner.|`|2Gz6pVbKaa	Yes to a degree I agree. However its the attitude of the bowlers that makes the difference, spinners think they have an advantage in the sub continent so they are more confident therefore bowl better. The difference between pace and spin in India was only 2 wickets per test. I think its more a mind set thing fast bowlers hang there head as soon as they know they going to sub continant, and everyone knows cricket is played between the ears. The sub continant in my opinion is better than Aussie wickets for a fast bowler, in Aus we get no real swing or seam and the pitches a lot slower now, in Pak or India the ball will start to keep low and the SG ball has a harder seam than Kookaburra ball so it should seam a bit to.|`|bbf096ad6f74d4fe631cb97301e1a43baa	Absoultely agree 100%. Their pitches have always favoured spinners rather than pace bowlers.<br>  <br>  <br>  He's the one they call Dr. Feelgood<br>  He's the one that makes ya feel all right<br>  He's the one they call Dr. Feelgood<br>  He's gonna be your Frankenstein<br>  I've got one thing you'll understand<br>  (Dr. Feelgood)<br>  he's not what you'd call a glamorous man<br>  (Dr. Feelgood)<br>  Got one thing that's easily understood<br>  (Dr. Fee lgood)<br>  He's the one they call Dr. Feelgood<br>  Oh yeah<br>  <br>  He'll tell you he's the king<br>  Of these barrio streets<br>  Moving up the shangri-la<br>  Came by his wealth as a matter of luck<br>  Says he never broke no law<br>  Two time loser running out of juice<br>  Time to move out quick<br>  Heard a rumour going round<br>  Jimmy's going down<br>  This time it's gonna stick<br>  <br>  He's the one they call Dr. Feelgood<br>  He's the one that makes ya feel all right<br>  He's the one they call Dr. Feelgood<br>  He's gonna be your Frankenstein<br>  <br>  Let him soothe your soul, just take his hand<br>  (Dr. Feelgood)<br>  Some people call him an evil man<br>  (Dr. Feelgood)<br>  Let him introduce himself real good<br>  (Dr. Feelgood)<br>  He's the only one they call Feelgood|`|d1b38b13b953ba1dbaf4d9bcd50f9de4aa	I think anybody who has watched cricket in the last 60 years would agree with the comment that "most of the pitches in the subcontinent do not favour pace bowling".<br>  <br>  The only form of bowling other than spin which can prosper is quick reverse-swing bowling. If you can't get the ball to reverse-swing (by tampering with it, usually) then nothing is going to go your way if you're a seamer.<br>  <br>  That's because the pitches on the subcontinent are lifeless due to the climactic conditions. Therefore only bowlers who can make the ball deviate are likely to prosper. The exact opposite conditions are found in England, where accuracy and consistency are rewarded.<br>  <br>  Just as an example, in 219 test matches in India, pace bowlers have taken 2716 wickets (12 per match) @ 33.06, SR 70.8. Spin bowlers have taken 3191 wickets (14 per match) @ 32.79, SR 80.0. <br>  <br>  Comparison: In England, in 450 matches, pace bowlers have taken 8683 wickets (19 per match) @ 29.73, SR 64.0. Spin bowlers have taken 3436 wickets (7.63 per match) @ 32.73, SR 79.7.<br>  <br>  Says it all.<br>  <br>  EDIT<br>  <br>  Although I try to remain as neutral as possible, I would say that Imran, Waqar and Wasim have all admitted to regular ball-tampering, and if I say "Shakoor Rana" then everybody will get what I would like to say about the outside help that those three (admittedly great) bowlers received during their careers...<br>  <br>  EDIT 2 <br>  <br>  The "subtle art" (blatant cheating) was brought over by Imran and taught to the bowlers at Sussex. He certainly didn't learn it in England, he just taught it.<br>  <br>  As to the assistance which home bowlers could rely on in Pakistan, just look at these two shockers which Mike Gatting got in 1987: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V9xnMvgO0A&NR=1" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V9xnMvgO...</a> ...<br>  <br>  EDIT 3<br>  <br>  "The English are just the best in everything they do, they dont need to admit anything!"<br>  <br>  <br>  I never said anything pro-England...where did you bring that up from??? If there were things to be admitted to, I would admit them.<br>  <br>  This is about the subcontinent.<br>  <br>  Another Edit @Justdolt (appropriate)<br>  <br>  Stop being so sensitive. I just followed a discussion where it was going. Sarfraz did teach the other Pakistani bowlers to alter the condition of the ball in dry conditions...but Imran was the one who spread it widely in England. I have read Imran's autobio, that's how I know that he spread the word about ball tampering, as it wasn't known in that form at all in England before he got there...maybe you should get it off the shelf and refresh YOUR memory...?<br>  <br>  BTW, I don't appreciate being criticised personally by people I've never once heard of in my life. As to a "war"...please grow up. Anything like that starts and I'm out of the cricket section, I have other things to do with my time if people don't want me to share what I've learned.|`|AA11088802	i saw only one pitch in srilanka which favors the pacers.. at which asif took 10 wicket haul and Pak win the match...other wise 98 % hopeless for pacers|`|e7f9613d5b480e9758d037bfe66ac6b9aa	yes

68c1d5b1f14b95ec630477c10b85baefaa	The general answer is that if it is illegal to hunt deer with a rimfire in your state, it is also illegal to "finish it off" with one. use a legal and humane firearm at all times.|`|YczLYtWjaa	no state in the USA will allow rimfires for deer hunting.......so it IS not legal|`|AA10834367	I would say no, but I don't know what state you live in. Most states have a minimum caliber that can be used to take game, whether it be the initial shot, or the fatal one. If the deer keeps running from you, and you think you have a fatal shot put on it, just give it time to find a place to die. If the deer is wounded to the point where it's not able to run, just cut it's jugular or insert a knife through it's ribs and into it's heart. Then again, I have had a few bucks kick the crap out of me doing this, so maybe your best bet is to just fire another round from whatever you used the first time.|`|IEjc4R3Raa	There are two issues involved. First, it is usually not legal to admisiter a coup with a cartridge that isn't legal as the basic hunting arm. And rimfires are not legal deer hunting weapons anywhere.<br>  <br>  The second issue is that most states do not allow you to hunt while armed with more than one weapon. So, where would the .17 come from?|`|AA10510875	im not sure what state you are in, you really need to check your local laws.i can tell you that in the state of missouri there is no minimum caliber, however it must be centerfire, rimfire is not allowed in any instance for deer hunting, |`|wArBivLSaa	 If you wound a deer, I suggest finishing it off with the gun you used to shoot it with in the first place.

cEHmT2Coaa	As far as I know, some girls do, some don't. I think it's preferred that you did wear something under them though. Especially if you're a flyer, you don't need anyone to see anything out of your area... I think spankies usually cover everything, but sometimes they slip so yes it would be good to have some undies of the same color. It's just up to you|`|JrI5sqGSaa	BTW: This isn't a volleyball question. <br>  <br>  Anyways...it depends on what you like. Alot of people I know all wore underwear under our spankies but if your one of those people that don't like to wear underwear, don't.

8ZXN8q8baa	In line skating all that will do is mess up your ice hockey stride and recovery. I suggest the sean skinner power skating dvd set. one word: amazing. the off ice training is fantastic. Here is the website for sean skinner power skating DVD: <a href="http://www.skinnerhockey.com/shop25/item-detail.cfm?ID=SK8%20DVD%209%20and%2010&storeid=21" rel="nofollow">http://www.skinnerhockey.com/shop25/item...</a><br>  you will not be disappointed But if your not looking to spend as much all the power in the stride is in your hips and legs. Squats with weight, no weight will help Alot it gets your legs strong. another is improve your agility try ladders or what I do is use a ball like a german stick handling ball or a puck and do ladders but stick handle while doing it.<br>   Another is try getting a medicine ball and try to balance all NHL players to this it make them what they are today. Lunges with 4 pound medicine balls are also helpers in strengthening the legs<br>  <br>  Good Luck and I hope these will help you become a better hockey player|`|qlDV1OZwaa	inline hockey ilove it
ghzhPhNDaa	no.  The Seattle Seahawks are among the work team/franchises in the NFL.  I see the Seahawks winning 4 or 5 games in 2009.  If ALL if their STARTERS are healthy.

Seattle suckssssssssssssssssssssssss.     lol..  you should be ashamed of yourself.|`|BAeodkdTaa	Sadly, most likely not. New coach will spend the year getting a feel for the 'hawks, while Houshmandzadeh will offer little to the team as he is grossly overrated. <br>  <br>  And we always hope they will come out of the season with few injuries, but how far has that gotten us. Give them 3-5 more years and they could start to be a force in the West.|`|QFT9PQ8kaa	manchester united and arsenal and liverpool and barcelona and all others all lose to the one great football team-----------singapore(roar!)|`|6e8eb208cb0422b7103ca1b8cb9ab2ecaa	They can't get much worse.<br>  Hey, wackjob. if they won 4 or 5 games, that would be considered better.<br>  I bet they beat your 69ers at least once next year.
eo3lDZDWaa	That's about my average time for the 400m dash. It's pretty good.|`|WrDGhduxaa	That is an exceptional time. You need to make sure the distance is correct and also the timing.<br>  If you are near to that time over 400 meters I think your potential is in track, not football. <br>  You are not going to find many 15 year olds who can run that fast.|`|0dbDQh8Haa	50 seconds is good, but there is room for improvement. you definitely are a good runner, that's for sure. but if you'd like to be exceptional, i would try to get it to 48. that doesn't seem like a lot of improvement, but in a short race like the 400, every second counts|`|eELS8zSRaa	When I was 14 I got 52 seconds, a pretty good time that got me conference. But considering that you're going up against people that are 18 years old it's not the best, despite it might being the best for your age group. With time it will come!|`|KBjleE6qaa	for a 15 year old male, anything under 55 is really good. average is prob around 58 so you are waaay ahead of the game|`|uNUYjO1Eaa	I think thats pretty good, but it isnt the best.

ll2y4YIGaa	no you cant, and heres why.. the companies have gotten smarter and "filled" the end next to the blade. however you can flip the shaft and put a blade (standard) at the top where your grip used to be. so to all you people who say you can, YOURE WAY WRONG!!<br>  <br>  Edit: Might I add that if you need a replacement stick to tie you down until you work up enough money for another really good one, I'd recommend getting the RBK 4K. It's a good stick and it wont break the bank.|`|b6aN6rz2aa	As others have said, you can flip the stick around and put a blade in on that end. That side is not "filled" in case people wanted to put an extension in.... BUT.........<br>  <br>  keep in mind if you flip the stick and put a blade in on the other end, then your top hand grip is going to be on the holes of the stick and if is also much thinner at that end. So this is going to feel completely different to what your use to.  ALSO...<br>  <br>  The stick is designed to have a kick point close to the holes, so if you flip it and put a blade in not only will the grip be much different but the stick will not function like it did before, it will not have the whip it used to have and therefore will alter your shot.|`|QSShHlRiaa	Yeah you could put a new blade on the end.<br>  but with the stick you have you cant becuase <br>  they "filled" the newer sticks so that you cant<br>  if it was an "older" stick you could.|`|pMIc1XXWaa	its alot easier to simply flip the stick and put a standard blade in the end that you normally would put the butt end into.|`|yVmRcnUTaa	just flip the stick and put the blade on the but end|`|x9GODf8eaa	You can't put a blade in the side that the original blade was on (see Bladerunner's answer). <br>  <br>  You can, however, flip it over and but a blade in the butt end. The problem is that the stick was designed to kick at a certain point in the stick. The overall feel and flex will be different with the stick upside down. A lot of people wouldn't notice the difference, but if you are good, and have some experience with good sticks (as you obviously do, as you use a 9k) it is going to feel really weird. But its better than spending another 200 bucks.

OAEuYZkZaa	Nope, you can't use .22 LR ammo in a .22 WMR.  The .22 Long Rifle brass will split nearly every time, and this will cause extraction problems and gas leaks.<br>  <br>  The .22 WMR uses jacketed bullets of .224" diameter, and these bullets are seated inside the cartridge case.<br>  <br>  The .22 LR uses a heel-based bullet that is the same diameter as the cartridge case, with a sub-caliber heel which is inserted in the cartridge case and the case is crimped on the heel.<br>  <br>  I've owned a .22 revolver since 1975 that had both .22 LR and .22 WMR cylinders.  When I bought the revolver, a box and a half of 40 grain Winchester JHP .22 WMR cartridges were thrown in.  I still have most of the full box left, plus another box CCI .22 WMR's that I bought in the late 1980's when I bought a Ruger Single-Six Magnum.<br>  <br>  You buy the rifle that you want.  But I'd not swap my .22 LR rifle for half a dozen .22 WMR rifles.<br>  <br>  Doc|`|Jkflk0aTaa	Not a good idea. I dont know what if anything would go wrong but it sure would not be the best thing for the gun or for accuracy. Like another answer said, there would be a gap before the rifling starts and that could deform the bullet and possibly cause it to lodge in the barrel. if you just want to have fun I would say go with the .22lr, cheap and fun to shoot.|`|AA10834367	Ummm...no. There is a reason rifles are chambered for certain cartridges. A 22 long may fit into a 22 mag, but it may not fire safely. Sure, it may fire 9/10 times without a problem, but that 10th time may cause undesired results.|`|QNX9NET3aa	No,you really shouldn't. The bullet has a big jump before it enters the rifling. This does nothing for accuracy and can damage the gun.|`|3b8557f01cef58611c2e78e57d57b1e5aa	No, very bad idea.*|`|xWApXu8Aaa	NO, you can't unless you want to get a face full of hot gases from the action when the case ruptures.<br>  <br>  This warning has been brought up in gun magazines several times in the past.<br>  <br>  The .22wmr uses a slightly tapered case and the bullet used in it is not a "heeled" type like what is used in the .22lr cartridge. (You will immediately notice a difference in the base and rim diameters of the 2 rounds when compared next to each other)<br>  <br>  Firing a .22lr round in a chamber meant for .22wmr will cause a ruptured case and hot gases being sent back toward the shooter.  (I've seen this happen on 2 different occasions)<br>  <br>  For verification of this, you only need to look at the Ruger Single Six revolver.  It comes with 2 cylinders (one in .22lr and one in .22wmr) for a very good reason.  Because it's not safe to fire .22lr in a chamber meant for the .22wmr.<br>  <br>  Just get a .22lr and shoot the "hyper velocity" (such as the CCI Stinger or Remington Yellow Jacket) rounds through it to get closer to the power of the .22wmr. <br>  <br>  There is no major advantage to choosing the .22wmr over the .22lr|`|69a47001c8449771a6964bf1c2360497aa	Quick answer:  No, a .22 Magnum rifle will not feed .22 LR ammo.  You can fit them in one at a time but this is not recommended as they don't fit right and if they fire at all the case will swell or split jamming the action and possibly damaging your rifle.  Rule of thumb, firearms are ammunition specific.<br>  <br>  H<br>  |`|9f1815216915b904efd9e933b1a5b03aaa	<a href="http://www.sako.fi/sakoquad.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.sako.fi/sakoquad.php</a><br>  <br>  You can't shoot a 22LR in a 22 WMR but the link above is for a rifle that has interchangeable barrels for 22LR , 22WMR, 17HMR and 17 Mach2 so you get four calibres with one gun and it is safe.|`|Ekx7G30jaa	No, please don't try it.  The rifle will say what cartridges it will take.  I don't think there's a heck of a lot of difference between the two.  |`|ce24da18ce0797a2fbcab8cdca8ccdeeaa	i would say get something like a remington 552. they fire .22 short, long, and long rifle. in all reality .22 LR is more than enough to take out varmint. |`|PoXuuczAaa	no you couldnt the barrels are rifled differently. buy a long rifle its bettter and ammo is cheaper|`|8VrlRUfhaa	No. The 22 WMR is a longer and ever so slightly larger case.|`|4qT0TfMZaa	NO!  The cartridge case for .22 WMR is slightly greater in diameter and the .22 long rifle cartridge won't chamber properly.
ZSM5bUZgaa	i use a 22/250 |`|QNX9NET3aa	.223 or 22-250|`|ofP7bbX7aa	I have used a 22 Magnum for years.  It has always come thru and the ammo is cheaper than the 22-250, hornet, or jet.  I have not fired the .17, but I have 2 friends that really like them. In Arizona when I was a kid, a lot of people used the .243.  It is a good all around rifle and can also be used for deer or any small game. The Forestry service use the 22 magnum to thin herds.|`|AA10834367	Depends on what your looking to do. For harvesting them, I would use a .22 MAG. This caliber does very little damage to the hide and will easily take down a 'yote with a head shot. Next would be a .223, then a 22-250. The 250 does (in my experience) more damage to the hide than any other varmint rifle. However, I have done quite a bit of damage with a .223 also. If I were to pick a general, all around rifle for terminating the song dogs, I would choose the .22-250. That's my personal opinion.|`|55f484fccb20683f2f5f49e6f812ee7caa	depends on where you hunt  shot gun .17 cal 22 long rifle 22 center fire 3006 208 |`|CeRof6draa	I'd go along with Dave above with the 22-250.|`|bOGpyWsVaa	I think I would agree with them on that gun, but to be honest with you a really powerful pellet gun and a nice shot to the head will work too.

YrxLbfiIaa	I shoot a lot of shotgun so take my advice......<br>  <br>  Do not be intimidated by the recoil..... To start with only buy 2 3/4 inch trap / target / game shot loads..... Do not make your first shot in anything 3 inch... No buckshot and no slugs.....<br>  <br>  Just fire the 2 3/4 inch target / shot load first.... You will find the recoil quite manageable and you most likely will immediately think "that wasn't bad"...... Fire a few of those to get used to the kick...... Then move up to 2 3/4 inch managed recoil slugs or buckshot.... Remington sells this stuff.... Its got a bit more of a kick but since you already have a feel for the shotgun it wont be surprising...... AVOID at all costs any 3 inch cartridge, high velocity cartridge or anything that says magnum on it..... Only graduate yourself to that stuff when you have been out a few times with your shotgun....<br>  <br>  I personally am recoil sensitive... I do shoot up to 50 cartridges of 2 3/4 inch game loads, buckshot and slugs in an afternoon and dont think anything of it... I will not shoot anything 3 inch because it knocks the snot out of me so avoid this in the beginning....|`|6KaMW1Vzaa	The menace of the shotgun should be a function of which end you're on. You have your shoulder, your cheek, and your off hand to handle recoil, so it's really not an issue. Yes, it's loud, but so are handguns. Wear hearing protection.|`|AA10834367	When first shooting a new gun, whether it be a pistol, revolver, rifle, shotgun or muzzle-loader, I always shoot with the "intent to fire" the gun. Meaning, I will aim the gun at the target (making sure nothing is anywhere near the intended target) and just pull the trigger. With rifles, shotguns or muzzle loaders, I don't shoulder the gun, like I said, I just aim and pull the trigger. This may not be the safest way, depending on the intended target, but the target I always shoot at is several hundreds of yards away from any unintentional targets (houses, people etc). This way, I can get a feel for the gun. Your mossberg should not rattle you too much, depending on the load you're shooting. Slugs and magnum shells will hurt the most, but some number 4's or 6's (good home defense rounds) will not be bad at all. Just take your new shotgun out, shoot from the hip at first (which is where most home defense shots are fired from), then shoulder the gun and see how it feels. Good luck!!!|`|3b8557f01cef58611c2e78e57d57b1e5aa	You did not mention what gauge you bought it in.* The 12 gauge is the one with the most recoil, 16 and 20 gauge have moderate recoil.* If you find that the 12 gauge is uncomfortable for you, buy a Limb-saver recoil pad and put it on your shotgun, it reduces the recoil by 50%.*|`|TvARYVRJaa	well   itms  a little  louder  however  the rang  i assume  is going to give you low base  7 shot   so the recoil wont be a issue tu eddie  get your self some  high brass  # 4 or 00  buck for home!!!!!|`|jYLsK3k0aa	buy a recoil pad if it scares you but i can shoot mines from the hip no problem |`|wh3FWpDtaa	My 2nd gun I bought when I was 18 was a FEATHERWEIGHT 12 Gauge single shot.

You would not believe how fun it is to shoot clay pigeons flying in the air. I have shot all sorts of pistols, military style rifles, and shotguns in various calibers. I think that shooting shotguns is still my favorite shooting activity.|`|Iw4zDe7Qaa	recoil shouldn't be a problem. don't fear the recoil thats the worst thing you can do we call that magnumitis aka flinching which throw your shot off.|`|rDQepcW7aa	depending what calibre your m1 is (.30 short?) you will probably find the shotgun nicer. shoulder it properly.<br>  shotguns have very cushy recoil compared to the crack of rifles, if you're that worried, invest in a limbsaver recoil pad and you wont even feel it.<br>  and yes, shotguns are loud, but it's a different kind of loud. (400kHz as opposed to .30 which is ~800kHz) wear earmuffs anyway. shotguns are hella fun to shoot.<br>  if you plan on using it for HomeD then you'll want to get over that fear, even though you hopefully wont actually need to pull the trigger. i wouldn't fear most women pointing guns at me (asides from something getting shot accidentally), because they're horribly incompetent, and not very convincing, if you're timidly waving a boomstick around the crim is gonna try it on. practice looking scary, shoulder it confidently and aim for the chest, laser pointers help. also if you chamber a round as you enter the room, it ads that scary "shuk-shuk" sound to it. speak loudly, tell the c*nt to get on the ground if you have a laser then make sure it's pointed at the floor just infront of his face so he can see it. keep your distance, if you're within 2 ft of me i can take a gun off you and put you on the ground, most crims probably can't. but i'm not a crim.
AA10834367	I had a bb gun I did this to. I ended up blowing out the seal on the air chamber (as you pump, this air chamber gets air compressed into it, much like the tank on an air compressor). Once this air chamber reaches it's full capacity, and you keep pumping, the seal on the intake side (where the air goes in) will blow out and render the gun useless. This is what happened to me anyway. |`|39d77d396b6018aac260eb632b7665f9aa	>>What happens if I over-pump a pneumatic air rifle?<<<br>  <br>  Nothing good will come of it, that's for sure.<br>  <br>  You do not increase your rifles power by any significant degree, but you can damage it. <br>  <br>  They are  "chipmunks" and I can't think of one good reason to shoot them (?)|`|539babdd05cb8f15f125aa0052e12d02aa	First of all they are called chipmunks, and what is the point in shooting them? And to answer you'r question, you don't add much power to you'r bb gun and you just damage it, after a while it will not shoot straight and might just break from the inside and then it would be no good. |`|u7CnecIOaa	If you really can notice increased power,then go for it.<br>  You'll notice that you'll be pumping more and more as the seals go away!|`|vMOraU11aa	it will break. it puts to much presser on it and breaks the spring and than you can't pump it any more|`|VEoG1VCsaa	You will blow out the seal and break your gun.<br>  <br>  Stop shooting chiPmunks.  There is no logical reason to do so.
BQ7rS5m2aa	I think they're in for a good year. If Toby Thurstans is able to actually maintain the key defensive position Chad Cornes held, then Cornes is going to be able to have a run through the midfield or go up forward to relieve some pressure off the others. Also, watch out for Tredders, looks like he'll have a good year this year.<br>  <br>  Just think about it, they have Tredrea who usually has the best defender against him, with Motlop and Westhoff  having the 2nd and 3rd best defenders. If Cornes goes up there, then he'll most likely have the 2nd best defender opposing him, leaving either Motlop or Westhoff and then Ebert to run free a bit more.|`|2s244jGgaa	You make some very good points, but they have a problem. They do lack a large key forward to take those hard pack marks or take on the big defenders which little blokes like Daniel Motlop (who the team depends on for most of their goals) can not handle. Warren Treadrea is just a forward, not the main one. His golden days are over, but he can still play the game. Blokes like brett ebert will have to stand up, and if the westoff brothers put on some weight and play well the power are in for a chance to regain their 2007 home and away season form.|`|qUBWjHq0aa	Lookin at their Draw they should do fairly good altho i think they will only just make the final 8 if not 9th or 10th.<br>  <br>  They will certainly improve on last yr as well as Tigers, Melbourne (may still get wooden spoon but win more games)|`|ZXGRJuI9aa	hopefully the top 8 somewhere.

For your your swing, your biceps, forearms, wrist, and shoulders will take a beating, while for serving, your back, shoulders, and forearm will be worked quite a bit. But this all depends on how you play. Some players (depending on their grip), utilise their triceps to generate spin, and so that would be a fundamental muscle group to their game. <br>  Play a long match after you have been taught proper, and chosen your preferred technique, and then find out what hurts, or needs work, and alter your gym workouts accordingly =]

We are all pretty much biased, and are going to suggest the methods that we are partial to. You're going to have to research on your own.  Just ask yourself what your immediate needs are.  If you are looking for something that can help you NOW, committing to a martial art that you are going to have to spend years practicing before you can defend yourself is not what you need.  Find a training program based on simple moves.  Look for programs tailored towards defending against street assaults, and make sure defense against weapons is on the curriculum.  A grown adult male (or female) is just as likely, if not more, to be assaulted by a person with a weapon as he is to get in a shoving match with some @$$hole at a bar, and yet traditional schools spend very little time, or none at all, on weapons defense.  If anyone thinks learning defense against armed assailants  is a waste of time, do some research into the Lloyd Irvin home invasion case.  Irvin is a BJJ instructor and MMA trainer who also practices practical self defense outside of his traditional system.  He was able to disarm a gun-wielding attacker who invaded his home, saving his own life, his wife and children, and the life of one Brandon Vera who was staying with him while training for his UFC fight against Keith Jardine at the time.  In closing, find a system that suits you, is based on simplicity, and that covers all the bases, armed, unarmed, more than one attacker.  In the meantime, use awareness and common sense to stay out of trouble, and, yes, i'm saying it again, CARRY A WEAPON that you can get to quickly and  does not require extensive training, and use it in a  RESPONSIBLE manner. (if you can't do that, don't carry one at all) as always I suggest a small blade or a concealable impact weapon for in close, pepper spray if you want distance.  Good Luck.|`|SRmNJCdiaa	Thats a difficult question because most people pick the style they personally like the most, and will defend it.  It depends on your build, your style.  I took Kung Fu for a while and although it kind of has a bad name for being showy and useless (from hollywood, thanks again) it again depends on the style.  Some styles are showier than others.  My teacher prefered Kung Fu because he was able to adapt and use it although he had arthritis.  My dad loved Tae Kwon Do because it fit his style and personality.  Many people love MMA (mixed martial art) because of its versatility and others like Krav Maga because of its ferocity.  <br>  <br>  I don't think there is any one style that's the best over all, it has to be the one that fits how you would naturally fight.  Most studios offer a first class free or be able to watch a class so you can see what you're getting into.  Some studios focus on self defense and other focus on exacting form.  <br>  <br>  Visit studios and find out.|`|v811KD7raa	jujitsu or aikido|`|riQ24gKWaa	The best is letting yourself loose (crazy no jutsu)|`|ByntGOwQaa	taekwondo|`|wlNGP0Bvaa	I take Kenpo, its pretty much all martial arts in one.|`|AhFrrOinaa	krav maga id say as well<br>  those israelis are scary...lol<br>  <br>  i take TKD but its pretty useless unless ur pro like me XD

p6GGoFDsaa	You've made some good points there, so good that I actually did read it all :)<br>  <br>  Well I have to say, slowly but surely the WWE tag-team division is regaining some sort of greatness. Obviously it's nothing like it used to be, and probably never will be again, but thinking back a year or two ago it was much worse than it is now.<br>  <br>  The main problem in WWE is that only the main titles (WWE and WHC) are having story-lines and feuds written around them. When it comes to mid-carder titles like the IC, US and tag-titles, there are sporadic matches between random guys just thrown together, which are never followed up. This lack of interest by the WWE writers has rubbed off on many of the fans, and caused them to believe these titles are essentially worthless.<br>  <br>  I like the fact that the Colon brothers are now a tag-team, they have an obvious chemistry in the ring which really, we're struggling to see in any other WWE tag-team.<br>  <br>  That being said, I think Morrison and Miz make an extremely entertaining team. What I don't like about the fact that they're together is that Morrison has enough talent to be World Champion. The Miz has greatly improved since he first began in the WWE, however he still isn't anywhere near as good as Morrison.<br>  <br>  Now a potential tag-team/stable was the Hart Foundation 2.0 which was used in various indy's and FCW as well. It consisted of D.H. Smith (who's in FCW,) Tyson Kidd (a.k.a. TJ Wilson) and Natalya Neidhart. There were various other wrestlers who got involved with it including Teddy Hart and Jack Evans but the three I mentioned are the main ones. I hear that DH Smith is being selfish, and has decided that he wants to be in the "Legacy" as opposed to being in a stable with Tyson and Natalya. It's decisions like this on the part of the wrestlers that are completely killing the division.<br>  <br>  As you said Cryme Tyme are arguably two of the most popular wrestlers today, are great wrestlers, and make fantastic entertainment. So why is it that the writers are choosing to throw any two singles wrestlers together in order to create a tag-team, when we have a perfectly good one right in front of us?<br>  <br>  <br>  I think that the WWE tag-team division has improved since last year, however they aren't going to get any better unless WWE put some real thought into who is being a tag-team, instead of putting any two guys together. Because unless this is done, the tag division is essentially dead in WWE.|`|037d26fcff528b19e4939c529e6ccad8aa	wow dude do you have your own blog? i totaly adgree with you on this one<br>  <br>  however i think you forgot to metion the possiblitly of a title unifaction between the colons and miz/morrrsion <br>  <br>  you aslo forgot to metion vinces hatard for tag teams<br>  <br>  and as eric used to say, why pay 4 man for one match, when i can pay them singly for 2 matchs!|`|W8SgRKo7aa	id rahter have no high titles and jsut tag teams becuase its jsut annoyinfg make the icand us the best and get rid of the wwe and whc. tags would be good  to be higher then those titles now. the hardys and christian and edge should be back together...|`|b7JS16dyaa	To sum it all up: The division is non-existent now. I think they should just unify the titles and have any team from any brand compete for them, because there's not enough teams available.<br>  <br>  WWE has a tendency to break up good teams, like Cade & Murdoch, Deuce & Domino, the Hardys (although I could see why), Jimmy Wang Yang & Shannon Moore, etc. which is the main reason why there's hardly anyone left. Most tag matches these days come from random pairings, which makes no sense.|`|ZKqINiuKaa	He is both because i think it's in his song|`|EZf00NJJaa	What a short Question .<br>  <br>  The tag team division suffers because of the head of the WWE .<br>  <br>  Vince has never cared for tag team wrestling , and he never will .<br>  <br>  You can only make cosmetic changes , but if the the big man himself <br>  does not care , why would the writers ?<br>  <br>  A Few  good tag teams have gotten through . , they are the exception to the rule .<br>  <br>  A few years back , there was WCW , there was competition , meaning even the tag division had to be good , hence they put in a lot of effort .<br>  <br>  Now , WWE rules all , there is no competition ...so they take it easy and allow things to play out .<br>  <br>  The only reason for tag teams now is to put a big star [ HHH ] over ,or to turn one of them , split the team , and then proceed to a singles career .<br>  <br>  Unless the attitude of the WWE itself changes , nothing can be done...at least in the near future .|`|NLJ33Nkeaa	Insane Clown Posse....Whats Wrong With You....<br>  <br>  <br>  There Were Only There In The WCW<br>  <br>  And If Were Talking Bout WCW<br>  <br>  How The Heck Did You Forget....<br>  <br>  <br>  The <<<<<<<<NWO>>>>>>>>>

Dhoni's batting style may be unorthodox, but the consistency he has achieved and is continuing to maintain, forces us to admit that he certainly has a technique of his own that is quite effective over a sustained period of time and in varying conditions and bowling as well!! Somewhat like Sehwag who has no footwork worth mentioning!!|`|RGxMkT0zaa	I think Raina knows what he is doing too.<br>  So does Dhoni. He needed to support Sachin. And Raina was OK and in a comfortable position to play his way.|`|rjWRMDYUaa	At this time he can bat anywhere because he is going through a good time.|`|bN6S0FJEaa	According to Raina himself, he is enjoying batting at any position as long as India is winning.<br>  <br>  Why are you so concerned. Relax have a glass of cold water.|`|H4BW2ALNaa	I think all the Indian batsmen are flexible and can bat at any position but i think his position should be 5|`|0ac3af7f05344feefbb618ff09a3b896aa	I think it is better if he bats in the 5th position.(After Dhoni)

Though Jackson needs to pass his physical which is a question after 3 rounds tonight.<br>  <br>  Mir had his knee scoped so 3 months is a minimum in my guess.  However every scope is different and he might be training and ready to fight next week.<br>  <br>  No the decision will not hurt Jackson.|`|ULw1777caa	UFC 100 is not till July.  He should be fine for that fight.
pLYY0SlFaa	I would LOVE to see that match. I love Evan Bourne so seeing him in a high flying match like that would be amzing. It would be such a high flying match. If it did happen i think Evan could win because the wwe should be giving him a push. I think though that Evan will be in the MITB match it would be amazing if he would be put up for the ECW title match. Either way id love to see any of those matches. Evan vs Rey Mysterio would be great though|`|ZUTfMc8vaa	that would be high flying|`|EZf00NJJaa	Would be great , but I prefer to see both in MITB .<br>  <br>  Or Evan should be in a ECW Title match with Christian / Swagger .|`|1WgOj89kaa	It aint blockbuster which Wrestlemania 25 should be so they will probably find their way into MITB.|`|sQpoIxf7aa	the odds of this match happening are the same as cena winning not going to happen|`|XVYRUzkEaa	Rey Mysterio will win if this match takes place..|`|W8SgRKo7aa	Evan is to "air Bourne" for rey|`|b7JS16dyaa	I'd actually love it, and if Evan could somehow get an upset win, it would be a great return match with good high-flying spots. I think the WWE writers should consider it, because I know they're holding off on Evan's return due to a lack of ideas for him.|`|XuX4lavPaa	I think it would be a great match but it wouldn't sell as much.  I just don't think this match will be fit for a major PPV.  But maybe if they build up a good promo and feud with them, yes it will be a good average match.|`|s4FIoGwmaa	i would love that.  unfortunately its not going to happen.  which sucks.  there would be some great action spots in that match and would work as a midcard or as you said a great opener.|`|77b5BDf3aa	I think Rey and or Evan will be in the MITB. Rey will find a way to qualify maybe he will be in the battle royal for the last spot and win it.<br>  <br>  Evan is good and all but gooo Rey.|`|gi0haHtdaa	First: your a hypocrite<br>  <br>  Second: your a parasite<br>  <br>  Third: no one cares about Evan Bourne<br>  <br>  Fourth: Rey can't wrestle<br>  <br>  Fifth: just die hypocrite|`|19KqIxWjaa	Both of them should be in MITB instead of Mark Henry (Why WWE, Why?).<br>  <br>  Edit: BTW, I just noticed your username. Yeah Man, Cena Sucks!!|`|KvjTfjQraa	Rey deserves a title shot or the money in the bank not just another appontent to vs i think<br>  <br>  rey would win for sure|`|R4I9LCxCaa	i think that would totally be sweet!!!!!! 8D it will be like the two best high flying ppl go against each other at wrestlmania. i say deff.!!!! and plus this is a chance for rey to be in wrestlemania. he might not be in it because of that money in the bank qualifing match but ya i totally agree to that challenge. 8D
4tvI9WYjaa	to bad this is not one night stand ecw  where john cena got the most hate from the fans that was funny but  i rather not see cena on the wrestlemaina card at all|`|vY0ScgeXaa	prolly nothing|`|Z5bH2LOZaa	None of the above. Judging by your question I can tell that you do not know very much about wrestling at all. Cena is getting better all time, but he needs a gimmick change and maybe a heel turn. Why don't you actually watch what he does in the ring instead of bagging him.|`|EZf00NJJaa	He makes the big show tap out and ends The biggest show of the year with the title held high as the Internet explodes .|`|sQpoIxf7aa	he will go down once again to the BIG SHOW!!!!!|`|ZUTfMc8vaa	i am going with the first four suggestions to you questions|`|b7JS16dyaa	From the list: The first one... He gets booed. I don't dislike him, but it's always funny when a babyface gets negative reactions from the crowd.<br>  <br>  From me: I'd like it to look like he's about to pin Edge after an Attitude Adjustment (ugh), but then Big Show gives him a nice Right-Hand and pins Edge instead, winning the title. Anyone else want something fresh instead of Edge and Cena? I do; a Big Show w/Vickie alliance against Edge and Cena, or anyone else, would be a nice change.<br>  <br>  <br>  P.S. Why would my OPINION get a thumb down? Anyways, to the hbk_619_ guy, how is Cena better than Edge? I know it's your opinion, but it seems like you're judging it based on storylines and characters instead of actual skill.|`|77b5BDf3aa	Cena will be in the Edge and Big Show match. Making it a triple threat match.<br>  <br>  He will get in because of whatever it was he whispered to Vickie. That's why the contract signing will be on Raw this week.<br>  <br>  I'm a fan of Cena and he always gets a good mixed reaction from the crowd. He is 100% better then Big Show. And he is better then Edge geez Edge needs to win a title without cheating or stuff like that.<br>  <br>  Cena will win and reclaim his the World Heavyweight Title.|`|v811KD7raa	id like him to sing "what what in the butt i said what what in the butt you wanna do it in my butt in the butt"|`|s4FIoGwmaa	i wanna see the big show frog splash him from the titan tron through an announcer table onto a huge buzzsaw.  but of course he makes the wwe money so hell come back 5 months early from his injury|`|hT32vMkPaa	gets killed by the new world heavyweight champion<br>  the big show<br>  he will be in aa triple threat with big show and edge, he wont do nothing, adn if you think he will do nothing, you are an idiot|`|TmgEbCrZaa	assassinated.<br>  but id rather see the triple h and randy ortons match. id like to see him breaking randys neck as he said he would.. i doubt it though.. and might say he did, but it wont be..|`|1WgOj89kaa	I would not as far to say he will get assinated, but i would like him injured.|`|UzHt495Saa	Cena needs to get his @$$ kicked by THE RRRRRROCK!|`|db7e40dd5354decef471fb1fb7b3d134aa	Yes - thats fine by me<br>  No - Spiteful<br>  No - Spiteful and nasty<br>  No - he can wrestle<br>  No - Taker is going 17-0<br>  <br>  Here are there plans for Wrestlemania:<br>  <br>  Undertaker vs. Shawn Michaels, with Taker going 17-0 at WM<br>  <br>  Triple H vs. Randy Orton for the WWE Title<br>  <br>  Edge vs. The Big Show vs. John Cena for the World Heavyweight Title<br>  <br>  Some surprises in the MITB ladder match, as Kane, Mark Henry are rumored to be in the match. Kennedy, CM Punk, MVP, Shelton Benjamin, Miz, Morrison are all good possibilities too.<br>  <br>  The Hardyz are expected to have a match<br>  <br>  a 25 Diva Battle Royal is scheduled, and have contacted many former Divas to take part such as Jackie Gayda, Sunny, Mae Young, Lita, Trish Stratus, among others,.<br>  <br>  Jack Swagger vs. Tommy Dreamer for the ECW Title has also been talked about, but Christian may be used instead of Dreamer<br>  <br>  I was notified late last night that there has been some informal dialogue between Hulk Hogan and WWE about the possibility of him working a match at WrestleMania. However, no creative plans have been made. Hogan reportedly pitched the idea of working a match against John Cena. <br>  <br>  Stone Cold has also been rumored working a match against Hulk Hogan, but Hogan has had back issued recently and may be unable to work. Austin is prominently featured in WrestleMania 25 advertisements so I think he will at least appear on the show, the night after he is inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame. <br>  <br>  <br>  Plans for Chris Jericho are still up in the air but i was told it will involve the angle with the legends. Mickey Rourke vs. Jericho was obviously the plan a couple of weeks ago but there has been concern from both Rourke and WWE about how it would go over. WWE officials are said to be concerned that it would be too big of a risk.<br>  <br>  Melina vs. Beth Pheonix looks likely for the Women's championship, but they may not have that on the card. Something involving Maryse/McCool may happen too. <br>  <br>  JBL was also scheduled win the IC title from CM Punk in the coming weeks, but due to the script being leaked, that may now have changed, but JBL was planned to make history by having the IC defended at WM<br>  <br>  These are the plans as of now, but Vince has been described as being "obsessed" with keeping things from leaking (see No Way out - using a curtain over the chamber pre=show to prevent knowledge of Edge being in both chambers) Plus plans change all the time, but these are what are known now.<br>  <br>  <br>  If you haven’t already, sign up to swag bucks and WIN SWAGS and FREE PRIZES<br>  <br>  <a href="http://mywwesearch.swagbucks.com/?cmd=sb-register&rb=145837" rel="nofollow">http://mywwesearch.swagbucks.com/?cmd=sb...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  Hope this helps|`|19KqIxWjaa	Booed, Injured, or the worst match. <br>  <br>  I don't hate the actual guy so I wouldn't want him to die.<br>  <br>  As far as the last one goes I wouldn't really care, It would be a good chance to go to the bathroom. Taker is way overrated, I hate him almost as much as Cena.|`|XuX4lavPaa	From what I can see, he gets booed 30% from the crowd not 80%.<br>  I know for sure that its going to be a Triple Threat between the World Champion.|`|WRIcZySSaa	What the AHole said
dnwJmNkdaa	Or what?.... The Jets haven't proved anything Defensively yet... last year their D was horrible<br>  TO and Evans can only catch balls thrown in there area code...  Edwards has little accuracy<br>  Pats will be good though an aging D should worry Pats fans<br>  and Miami .... poor Miami I will agree they are getting better but its hard to come down from a 1 win season.... If not for backyard football making a comeback they may only have 2 wins<br>  <br>  AFC East played the AFC west and NFC west last year the 2 weakest divisions...this year the NFC south adn AFC south...  A bit tougher   New england takes the division 10-6  Buff goes 8-8 missing the playoffs and NYJ and Miami have losing season|`|qo0kKtvpaa	First off, the Jets don't even have a quarterback. Then you got the Bills who just got TO, who can very well burn this team down. Then you got the dolphins, and the patriots. Dolphins are OK, but the patriots are great. So you got 2 out of 4 teams that have a decent chance for the playoffs next season. Not "Bada$$" but an OK division. A badass division would be the NFC East. Skins who just signed Haynesworth and Hall, the Giants who are still a force to be reckon with, the eagles who are almost always a good team, and the Cowboys. Cowboys just fought off some of their cancer, they just might be good to go with no real distractions.|`|JMVkZJzUaa	UM, lets see...<br>  <br>  The Patriots should be good, Miami might have been a fluke, Buffalo shot themselves in the foot by getting T.O., and the Jets have no QB.  Not exactly Bad***.<br>  <br>  I can think of at least 3 other divisions that are better from top to bottom.<br>  <br>  Sorry, can't agree with you, even though you are entitled to your opinion.|`|dfiW1IICaa	the best divisions in football are the NFC south and the NFC east|`|paIUgtLRaa	What....<br>  <br>  Miami is done. The Wildcat is over. Miami will surprise no one. The Jets will have no offense, and the D will take some time. Buffalo will stink as always. Owens will do nothing to change that. The only one that will go to the playoffs is the Patriots. Miami, New York, and Buffalo will be stuck at home...again.|`|VAx6qu58aa	yeah there a good division but the NFC EAST is better my eagles came in 2nd place but w/e as long as dumb dallas doesnt make it to the playoffs. <br>  this is what i think<br>  1st-NFC EAST<br>  2nd-AFC EAST<br>  3rd-AFC SOUTH|`|q9D1mCJnaa	the AFC East played the weakest schedule in football they played the afc west and the nfc west 8 off most of their wins came against sum .500 teams<br>  <br>  the pats will be for real this year but the rest will fade|`|FZ1dy9uCaa	Do you want to see a badass Division?<br>  <br>  Check out the NFC East. Hardest Division in the NFL.<br>  And thats not even being biased lol|`|hBzEmMO4aa	badass division see NFC East|`|6IefObqzaa	that "badass division" was able to hold their own in the playoffs so you might want to think that over again.|`|zJv1Cxuoaa	the bills got better on offense with to and we'll soon find out how well they perform.|`|VQPgNedQaa	ya im so excited my two fav teams r in the two best divisions|`|AA12103453	You think Evans is that good? You think Trent Edwards is that good? T.O. is getting old and not that great now, and Edwards isn't going to be helping him. There is a reason T.O. is signing for one year. He wants to let himself look good on a bad team to get a better contract. <br>  Next you have the Jets. They got a "great" QB last year who destroyed them down the stretch. I don't care how good you THINK their defense is(Sorry but a Badass Defense is Pittsburgh or Baltimore, or The Titans last year) they need an offense. For them to be great they'll need a new QB or be hoping Clemens is good to great.<br>  Miami is getting better I'll grant you, you set the bar low enough I can agree.<br>  <br>  So based on the TRUTH of what you are saying of I'd say no they aren't a badass division, and you showed you are a homer to the division.|`|15wwA3jjaa	I wouldn't really call it a bad *** division to be honest with you.  The Patriots pretty much own that division every season except last year when Brady injured his knee 7 minutes into the first game, even then they came in second due to a technicality.  The Dolphins made huge strides last season but I honestly expect them to be the Saints of 2009, 1 good season and then wont even make the playoffs.  As for the Bills and Jets, well 1 team doesn't even have a quarterback, and the other just signed a 36 year old receiver who is on the decline and hope he can revive their offense.  Outlook, I expect to see the Patriots running the show in 2009 if Brady is back on the field in good health.
KyFvW86vaa	Ralph Wilson is entitled to one stupid decision every season, so he has already made his for this offseason (ie: TO). signing Mike Vick would take it to another level.Vick is the most over-rated QB in the League (Sorry the criminal has not been reinstated yet) so the most over-rated player not in the league.Please Ralph don't sign anymore losers to the Bills.|`|ofC4JQIhaa	um  what do u think the chances are that vick should not come back to the NFL but of course he will but not with the bills they already added trouble to their team they dont need to have anymore|`|6e8eb208cb0422b7103ca1b8cb9ab2ecaa	Not gonna happen.

He actually looks like he's up for the battle which is the main thing.<br>  If the rest of the squad had his attitude and commitment I wouldn't be worried about relegation at all, but I think we are in real danger of going down.|`|JRuaWQsUaa	Can't be any worse than Viduka look how many games we've got out of him since we signed him.|`|cUJbhspDaa	yes been a good loan bargain they have enough talent to stay up|`|euZRbiA2aa	Hes good when he wants to be but can also be lazy and huffy he didnt leave Rangers on the best off terms or his last German club who cancelled his contract.

bb75c006e5dfff116ffb27872ce76d0aaa	I sympathise with you and know how you feel.  You are not alone.  The same types of thing happen to me!  I also started karate late, at 33 years old.  Five years later down the line I am still at it!   I am now 2nd kyu brown belt in wado-ryu karate.<br>  Don't give up!  You passed your first grading!<br>  <br>  Try some of these self-help tips:<br>  <br>  - Learn about panic. Simply knowing more about panic can go a long way towards relieving your distress. So read up on anxiety, panic disorder, and the fight-or-flight response experienced during a panic attack. You’ll learn that the sensations and feelings you have when you panic are normal and that you aren’t going crazy.<br>  - Avoid smoking and caffeine. Smoking and caffeine can provoke panic attacks in people who are susceptible. As a result, it’s wise to avoid cigarettes, coffee, and other caffeinated beverages. Also be careful with medications that contain stimulants, such as diet pills and non-drowsy cold medications.<br>  - Learn how to control your breathing. Hyperventilation brings on many sensations (such as light-headedness and tightness of the chest) that occur during a panic attack. Deep breathing, on the other hand, can relieve the symptoms of panic. By learning to control your breathing, you develop a coping skill that you can use to calm yourself down when you begin to feel anxious. If you know how to control your breathing, you are also less likely to create the very sensations that you are afraid of.<br>  - Practise relaxation techniques. When practised regularly, activities such as yoga, meditation, and progressive muscle relaxation strengthen the body’s relaxation response – the opposite of the stress response involved in anxiety and panic. And not only do these relaxation practises promote relaxation, but they also increase feelings of joy and equanimity. So make time for them in your daily routine.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.helpguide.org/mental/panic_disorder_anxiety_attack_symptom_treatment.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.helpguide.org/mental/panic_di...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.panicattackhelpguide.com/?cid=stopattack" rel="nofollow">http://www.panicattackhelpguide.com/?cid...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.ofear.com/phobialist/Panicattacks.html#4" rel="nofollow">http://www.ofear.com/phobialist/Panicatt...</a>|`|51dff71b1a9e764ae4aa42218cfb19d3aa	What Mushin said!<br>  Feel exactly the same started at 33 and 4 years on still very nervous about sitting an exam tommorow (!!!), first kyu brown the one before the black, yes going through a mix of "don't care", "gonna give it all up anyway" - its all in the journey.

Examples of dialogue might be,"It's just anxiety.It will go away. I will not lose control.<br>  I can still go about my business feeling spaced-out.It won't hurt me."<br>  <br>  5.DISTRACT--Get busy.Do something to release some of this self-induced stimulation.Your body is like a car in high gear with the brakes on .Don't just sit there! Walk,jog, clean closets -but do something.Distract yourself from the way you are feeling.<br>  <br>  6.LET TIME PASS-- and try to see a little humor in the way you feel.You may feel weird ,you don't look weird.Give yourself permission to feel weird for a little while. It is no big deal.Try to figure out what is really bothering you. Is it some type of conflict that you don't want to deal with?Is it a scary thought? Is it a ridiculous expectation you have about yourself? How about the television program you watched  last night?What is bothering  you?<br>  <br>  <br>  It takes time and lots and lots of practice.But the only way to stop fearing panic and anxiety attacks is to experience them .Then, work your way through them and begin to see that they won't hurt you.<br>  <br>  There is no need to avoid or fight .<br>  <br>  YOU are your safe place and your safe person .<br>  YOU can make yourself feel better.<br>  <br>  Feel good!<br>  <br>  Praise to Lucinda Bassett !|`|2342825964248c03e3b4b0af44b00b59aa	Congratulations on your testing and promotion.  As you observed yesterday you were the oldest one.  I mention this as that in itself sometimes creates this for adults like yourself.  You are in an environment unfamiliar to yourself, under pressure trying to showcase your skills, knowledge, and technique when you test.  That in itself is a learning experience and one that most adults have long since left behind from earlier in their lives when they may have been involved in athletics.<br>  <br>  When you are in class sometimes picture yourself testing in front of Sensi as you are practicing and doing those things that you are going to be tested on.  Along with this there is no substitute for good preparation.  Try to be as prepared as possible for testing and then just focus on doing things the same way during testing as you practice them in class.  Along with this talk to some of those that have tested before you to get a better understanding of what may be expected of you on your next testing.  Also have one of the higher ranking students run you on a couple of psudo tests with you doing those things that you will be expected to do next time.  In you mind place yourself doing this in front of Sensei as well.  For some people their first testing is their hardest even though it is the easiest one they will probably have.  You now have the experience of one under your belt and realize how you need to not only prepare physically for it but mentally as well.|`|GpzvrlHdaa	Mushin gave you an excellent answer.  I will also tell you you aren't alone, but there is a solution.  But it is your solution, and you must find it, with some help to be sure, but your martial art is about you.  Calm your breathing, and realize that it is no big deal to make some mistakes.  You must make mistakes if you claim to be human!  Belt ranks are not important.  They are merely an inaccurate gauge of skill sets. Inform your coach of this inclination to panic.  If he/she is good at instructing this art they will know of some ways to help you.

Look up "tips for panic attacks" and you should get some helpful results. I went to the doc and got a little handout on how to prevent/improve them, and it Really helped. The biggest thing was calming the body/mind through deep breathing and strict calm concentration. Good luck man..

3hOmWoXUaa	1 - Get a helmet and use it.  Period.<br>  #2 - saddle bag, spare tube, tire levers, pump, and learn to use it at home before you have a flat.  (CO2 is a nice-to-have but not always reliable.)<br>  #3 - get a multi-tool.  I like the Park MT-1<br>  #4 - gloves.<br>  #5 - water bottle or Camelbak.<br>  #6 - bike shorts.  They're padded and they don't get hung up on things.<br>  #7 - go take a safety class, especially one that teaches safe riding in traffic, or riding in a group.  It will make you more confident and safer.  Seriously.  League of American Bicyclists LCI instruction is excellent and consistent.<br>  <br>  You'll eventually want real bike shoes and clip-in pedals if you ride a lot.  They will allow you to pedal faster and use your muscles through more of the pedal stroke.  Cages will do OK. <br>  <br>  From there, everything becomes specialized.  <br>  Cold weather?  You'll need hats, jackets, arm warmers, tights, shoe covers.  A wind vest and arm warmers almost went on my # essentials above.<br>  Do you ride in the rain?  Fenders, raincoat, etc.  <br>  Do you ride at night?  Lots of reflective gear, front and rear lights.<br>  Want to carry stuff?  Get a handlebar bag.<br>  Touring or commuting?  Front and/or rear rack, panniers, trunk bag, etc.<br>  <br>  I've tried one of everything over the years.  I have different bikes for different occasions, and different accessories to go with.  It becomes an addiction, but you'll eventually find things you really like, and things that will go on Craigslist.  You can find forums with dozens of posts in one thread arguing over the best kind of handlebar bag.<br>  <br>  Most important is to just get out there and ride - a lot!|`|468e5cy8aa	1. Helmet. Never put your butt on the seat without your helmet on your head.<br>  2. Tire levers (about $3), spare tube (about $5), patch kit (about $5), and a pump (about $15). Why both a spare tube and a patch kit? You might get more than one flat in a single ride.<br>  3. Wedge bag to hold all the above. Put a card with your name, address, and emergency phone numbers in the bag.<br>  4. If your bike doesn't have a water bottle cage, get one. A water bottle is essential.<br>  5. Lights if you ride at night. For night riding, I also wear a reflective vest and bands on my left ankle and wrist.<br>  <br>  Learn to change a flat tire.

fdf78d43fe1121f9be25f88e4fef9e3baa	Your Meridia should have 8 gears on the back wheel and 2 on the crank... by the pedals. 8x2=16.<br>  <br>  If someone has modified it so there is only one gear on the pedals then yes,value is severely affected.|`|xxq5JAM6aa	It was probably modified to reduce weight. The owner was serious racing dude, strong, and probably rode on mostly level ground, so didn't need the lower gears.|`|JSGLKnA4aa	you only have 1 chainring on crank? 8 spd gear is the cog on cassette. 16spd just means you have 8 cogs and two chainring.
ZT9I6uJLaa	Munaf.............y cant he leave ?? Where is Sreesanth ?? He has recovered cmpletely...he shud hav been recalled as he can bowl vry well in New Zealand ! Havin a steady seam position,evry 1 saw wat Sreesanth did in SA...rattled the SA batsmen with his swing and pace.........|`|XVYRUzkEaa	Yes, it's time for Munaf Patel step up and leave.<br>  There are better bowlers than him like Sreesanth [who can even swing the ball] and very good young talents. [like Ashok Dinda, Yomahesh, etc.]<br>  RP should have played...|`|b7f6b1292b666a974a7a9c247d278b21aa	If Munaf do not step up, then he will not find a place even in the top 20.  The competition is stiff.  Irfan/Sree Santh/RP and other waiting to grab an opportunity.|`|RGxMkT0zaa	I never liked Munaf's game.|`|bN6S0FJEaa	For your information, in today's match between Ind v NZ every bowler has gone for runs.  Southee has given 100+ in his 10 overs.<br>  <br>  Munaf is a good bowler and he deserves his place in the team.<br>  I dont say that RP and Sree are not good but you cant play with 15 players in your team.|`|QtdO1RlQaa	Its time for Munaf to leave i suppose. R.P.Singh can exploit these conditions to the fullest.... Look at the Indian bowling department reserves, Munaf i think is very vulnerable if he errs in his line, hes a goner.|`|H4BW2ALNaa	I wonder why RP Singh is not in the team , but Munaf is actually in the team because of the injury ti ishant sharma|`|77d0e6ce90c816f67f90982c2b7d3082aa	Munaf needs a serious kick in his backside.I never saw a international player that much casual & stupid.|`|558ff4ba8e7d33a8220d4cc8b1701f56aa	I think there are some other good bowlers other than munaf and praveen.|`|IeM9MAPBaa	exactly!|`|rjWRMDYUaa	India is the world champion...<br>  I think we need r.p singh , sreenath , ishant sharma back.|`|0ac3af7f05344feefbb618ff09a3b896aa	No<br>  I don't agree with you!!!|`|e7f9613d5b480e9758d037bfe66ac6b9aa	rp is better bowler|`|wPlfPc0gaa	Today it was a bowler's game and so giving away runs is not the main reason to worry. But he cracks easily under pressure, e.g.  he bowled 2 high full tosses in 3 balls today. And he is consistently erring in line and length with no real swing or pace. He is more like a slow bowler.<br>  It is time for him to step up the gear else someone else is going to take his place in the team.
onvpwieHaa	Kobe is the better player.|`|vFbzBo4eaa	LeBron is the best player in the nba<br>  Wade is second<br>  Kobe's third<br>  i watched the game last night,Wade got the scoring battle but in the other things James was better and i hope Dwayne Wade doesn't get eject in other games|`|tzrLDbHWaa	I know from what you said that you like Wade the most and LeBron the least.  There are a few problems with your logic though.  First of all, your knock on LeBron is that he doesn't put up big numbers unless someone brings it up, or something.  Essentially you knocked his big game against the Knicks since he was just trying hard to one up Kobe.  Ok, understandable, but then you say that Wade's performance against the Knicks was better and he wasn't even trying until they made him mad.  Well, isnt that kinda the same thing you're accusing LeBron of?  Not playing 100% at all times.  Personally I don't want the player on my team that's not trying all the time, I mean, you're making how much money and you don't try all the time?  F**k you if you give it your all every game.<br>  <br>  Also, Wade leads the league in scoring but he has no one else on his team, I don't think that he would be scoring as much if he had a reliable 2nd option like LeBron and Kobe do.  Also, 3rd in the league in turnovers is NOT a positive stat.  He actually leads the league in total turnovers.  That shows that he's trying to do too much and makes bad decisions with the ball.<br>  <br>  Edit: You guys all say Wade deserves more respect, but why?  Because he's 1ppg ahead of Kobe?  He has no one else on the team to score so he has to take it all himself.  When Kobe didn't have a team he was over 30, was up to 35ppg in 05-06.  Kobe can score more if he wants, he just doesn't have to, that doesn't make him worse than Wade.  Finally, all you guys that are on Wade's sack, why don't you explain last night?  How does he get himself thrown out of a crucial game like that because you can't just shut up and play.|`|ofC4JQIhaa	Lebron is the BEST enough said|`|FFjxwBHyaa	wade i a better player than kobe and lebron ....his statistic is far better...|`|0ytjj1EGaa	Kobe is best now<br>  <br>  after he Retires LeBron (I doubt that u will find a better one)|`|248105516e0a10aa90a923223f69a619aa	WADE is Good.<br>  <br>  LEBRON is Better.<br>  <br>  KOBE IS THE MVP!!!!!|`|W7Dr5YaEaa	Kobe's still the best player in the NBA/World.|`|37Mq8ouIaa	Kobe|`|gprdq8E2aa	This is a good topic, people think because Lebron and Kobe are leading the MVP race that they are hell better than D Wade, but thats just because they have better team records, and if you read what Rob Peterson said this week in the race to MVP you will see that D Wade is nearly in front of Kobe. But Rob didn't want to upset any of Kobes bitchy fans.<br>  <br>  D Wade has mad stats and people diss him because of his 3.5 topg, but Lebron is so much better with his 3 topg. Hey i can see the difference. Like thats a whole half of pass a game.<br>  <br>  D Wade averages more assists, without any real good players. Meaning he has a better court sense than Lebron, which is more important in a player than anything else you can think of.<br>  <br>  D Wade DESERVES MORE RESPECT!<br>  <br>  and i agree Lebron is overrated. Kobe isn't his best anymore and should lose the 2nd spot in race to MVP. Also Howard would have to be up in this conversation.<br>  <br>  But in all we can't compare their stats because, Wade is sg(plays alot of pg for miami tho), Kobe is sg, Lebron is sf and Howard c. So their stats will be different depending on what their role is on the team.|`|uHHwZmhqaa	guys. U idiots, U idiots,U idiots. It's not about likeing anyone, it's about facts. D-wade clearly, clearly,clearly, clearly,clearly, clearly, has better stats than Kobe and LeBron. LeBrons a little better than kobe. <br>  d-wade sooooo underated. Now, I'm not a d-wade fan atleast i wasn't till i saw these stats. I'm a tmac. Personally, i think d-wades the best player in the nba right now. But on the long run, I'd pick a healthy t-mac anyday.

I think he has incredible natural talent and has the potential to be one of the best riders around. We just have to wait and see what he does with that talent. I don't know the specifics of what Jason has been in trouble for and really don't care. He is going to throw away a once in a life time opportunity if he isn't careful though. Yes, a lot of riders did go down in the first turn at Daytona, but wasn't Jason one of the fastest qualifiers that day? I think he also qualified in the top 3 last week but got too sick to race that event. The boy has skills. You know, I may be the Lone Ranger here, but I like him. I now how cocky I was at his age and I was only a state champion then. If I had been in his shoes as a teenager who knows what I would have been like.
