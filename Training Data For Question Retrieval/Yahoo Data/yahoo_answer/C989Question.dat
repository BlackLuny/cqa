Of course, I doubt it will ever come up in college hoops, because of the lack of sportsmanship rampant there, but...here goes...      We all read about the two HS teams that played the other night. A player from one of the teams lost his Mom to cancer earlier that day, but still showed up after leaving the hospital. He suited up, but wasn't registered at the start of the game to play in that game. Refs had to call a "T." Coach put him in anyway, "T" is called for illegal substitution. Other coach and captain says they don't want to shoot it. Player intentionally bricks the 2 shots. Crowd goes nuts, cheering both squads. Very touching story...both teams share pizzas after the game. I applaud everyone in the whole situation. BUT,      If this was to happen in a D1 game, where we all know betting is rampant, could the player that intentionally bricked the shots be accused of point shaving? I know it would be a cold thing to do, but there simply is no more chivalry in college hoops.      Tell me what you think would've happened if this scenario went down in D1.      Thanks in advance.

20090220175126AAo1iL7	Sports;Football (American)	How can I become a better player of (American) football?	Yeah, I'm a huge fan, but as a player, I suck the big one.      So I was at school playing a ramshackle football game- embarrassing myself like hell. Forward pitches, dropping handoffs, trying to shut out my own teammates (mind you, we weren't wearing anything to differentiate who's on what team), muffing kickoffs, and having an all-time 0.2 rushing yard record. Of course, playing with kids who have legitimately -played- citywide football didn't help, so I already had my hands full trying not to get laughed at, heh.      I'm slow, heavyset, and don't always think on my feet, and I've decided to shed this sadsack image I've had since elementary school in the most fun way I can think of- football- but not if it comes at this expense. I just want to be a good and substantial recreational player who actually contributes to the game instead of falling on his ***, getting faked out on a regular basis, and dropping the ball like a hot potato.

It's been about 4 weeks since I have been consistently practicing for softball so I still shouldn't have a sore arm after practice and games.      But lately, my biceps and triceps as well as my elbow have been hurting terribly during practice and games, I don't know if it's too serious though because after I ice it it goes away but then comes back.      It feels like I have a dead arm, it gets sore, lethargic, and weak after I throw long-distances. It's especially bad because I play right-field so I have to make long throws constantly. Also my Varsity coach may be replacing me if I can't throw my best which CAN'T happen, I've worked so hard for this.      So how can I treat this? I don't want to have to deal with it all season.

20090220183259AABpHwh	Sports;Baseball	True or False: The Yanks have a down side as great as their up side?	As much potential as they have, I also believe the Yanks could have bad potential. Here's why:       1. CC Sabathia threw over 250 innings last year for a wear-and-tear on his arm, and lefties don't do well at Yankee Stadium (despite the New Stadium)       2. They lost Abreu and Giambi who provided about 100 runs each. Teixeira is a better individual player than both, but losing the two sort of cancels out the transaction.       3. Pudge is gone so if Jorge is not ready to catch 162 games this year, Jose Molina will once again be their starting catcher.       4. The Red Sox bullpen is heavily improved. Ramirez, Saito, and Smoltz. The Rays have Burrell as well as David Price. So the competition is as good if not better than last year.        5. They plan on sending either Nady and/or Swisher to the Nationals for nothing for whatever reason...      6. The whole A-Rod thing...         Do you agree with this???

This year, everybody is arguing that Lebron or Kobe will win the MVP and I want people to give me five reasons on etiher or both on who should be MVP and why. I'll give you the stats of both..      Kobe Bryant:   27.4 PPG, 5.5 REB, 5.0 AST, .472 FG%, .868% FT    Lebron James: 28.4 PPG, 7.5 REB, 7.1 AST, .491 FG%, .776% FT   Lakers : 44-10                                                    Cavaliers: 44-11      In my opinion, Lebron is the MVP because of his better stats, better playmaking skills with less talent on his team. But if you can, give me five reasons why Kobe should be MVP instead of Lebron or stenghten my beliefs on Lebron James for MVP.

When should I use it, after workout? Taste isn't important to me, all I care about is the best value. I am only 16 years old so nothing that is un-safe. Please give me some good information on how to get bigger, gain weight and add muscle. Also, I have a friend who said he used it 2 summers ago and it made him really fat. Is this possible. I run track and I don't want it to slow me down. Will it slow me down? I will give best answer to the person that gives me the best information. Thanks a lot.

They just got a new stadium and home town.   4. Just got a new coach.   3. Made some great trades around the deadline, I mean amazing trades, Sefolosha will help a lot, Tyson wudda helped even more but he didn't pass the physical, and trading Wilcox and Joe Smith, some vets who are washed up, was good/   2. The got a mascot, I don't care what you say but if you don't have a mascot, you won't do as good, unless your the Celtics or Lakers.   1. Keven Durant and Russel Westbrook duo, a rookie and sophomore who will grow together, awesome.      I think the Thunder are going to be a great team in only 2 years because of their young talent and surprisingly smart trading, if they are smart enough to keep Westbrook and Durant together, and get an alright pick-up next year and in '10, they will be amazing.      Your thoughts please, and say the top 5 reasons you think they are or aren't a good team.

As you all know...Aguirre is out of a job!        http://www.mediotiempo.com/noticia/74002...       Do you think this is a sign that Mexico should fire Sven and hire Aguirre?        Should Mexico take that risk?     Give me your two cents on this!      I see it as a test.  If Mexico loses but with a good game and great effort....He should stay.  But if Mexico gets humiliated by the USA, then I think they should fire him and bring Aguirre in before its too late!

20090203103356AASvrYh	Sports;Basketball	What do you think of the NBA putting in a power play system?	Like in hockey.  If someone fouls, they are taken out of the game for 30 seconds, or until someone from the opposite team scores a basket.    A power play for those of you who dont know is when there is a foul called, one player is taken out so it would then be 4 on 5.    Thoughts

Might I add, If you had to coach a NFC championship Game, and You knew you had cancer In your Spine. , and you were feeling effects of it, Your saying you would be 100% right in the mind, and would be able to be yourself and do what you do, Jesus Christ the man had to sit up in the box couldn`t be on the field with his players.

20090220223242AAUWwiK	Sports;Baseball	In the '73 World Series, Game 2, Bottom of the 9th, Was the Deron Johnson Double a Misplay by Willie Mays?	Baseball-Reference.com shows a leadoff double by the A's Deron Johnson, just after Mays entered the game defensively in CF (after having pinch-run for Rusty Staub in the top of the 9th).  But was this one of the fly balls that was "lost in the sun" by the aging outfielder?  I remember seeing an ESPN special about this Series, and the Mays misplays were highlighted, as well as a shot of Mays on his knees begging for the home plate ump to change his out call on a teammate.      So if this Deron Johnson double really was a misplay by Mays, allowing the A's to score the tying run later in the inning--though the Mets ultimately won the game in 12 innings after a (who else?) Willie Mays RBI single and a couple of errors by the ill-fated Mike Andrews--my question is this:  Was Willie Mays' suspect fielding in Game 2 (and note, Mays had already committed an error going after a single in Game 1)--is it the ultimate reason that Yogi Berra never again in the Series allowed Mays to take the field defensively?  (Mays had only one more at-bat in the Series after Game 2, a pinch-hit fielder's choice SS-2B in the bottom of the 10th of Game 3; he had pinch-hit for pitcher Tug McGraw in that situation, so he was conveniently replaced defensively by reliever Harry Parker in the top of the 11th.)  That would be the last appearance of Willie Mays' playing career.      I remember the ESPN show quoting Mays' about "losing a ball in the Oakland sun," but now I'm not sure if it was on that double by Johnson.  The narrator seemed to suggest that Mays' quote was only an excuse, that Willie Mays in his prime would have caught that ball no matter what, that now he was only hurting the Mets by playing center field in the Series.      Please note that I am not trying to deride the legend of Willie Mays.  The 1973 Series is fascinating to me, as I have only heard of it through baseball specials and from ex-Oakland players reminiscing about it.  I love the "understories" of that Series:  Mays in the twilight of his career, playing basically on merit rather than talent; Mike Andrews--the ill-fated second baseman--making two consecutive errors in the 12th and immediately after the game demoted by Finley, only to be reinstated by Commissioner Bowie Kuhn; the turmoil in the dugout as A's manager Dick Williams threatened to walk out on Finley; the Amazin' Mets making another run at it despite a barely-over-.500 season record; and of course the sheer talent of that formidable A's team, even with all the adversity in the clubhouse, boasting such names as Reggie Jackson, Catfish Hunter, Ken Holtzman, Vida Blue, Campy Campaneris, Blue Moon Odom, Rollie Fingers, Darold Knowles, Gene Tenace and Joe Rudi, and of course captain Sal Bando.

Some people are actually curious as to what others think and why they feel the way they do like me. You may cause me to change my mind or see something i didn't notice or care to before.  If you don't like what you read or see just move to something else, it's that simple. I'm sure we've all been reported sometime or another and you know what i'm talking about. I've personally never reported anyone and don't feel the need to because i know what i'm getting myself into when asking or answering an opinion related question. I think we all share some level of boredom or we wouldn't spend the time we do here. I've also noticed like many others about this "Troll" thing going on. Does it really need to be that deep? Just my thoughts here, but if you ask or answer an opinion related question.....shouldn't we already know not everyone's going to agree with us and just lighten up a bit.

20090219115604AAoGT9M	Sports;Basketball	Holy **** What A Great Day No?	There is still a chance that before the season ends Marbury could go somewhere else and be someone else's problem. We traded Malik Rose for a good player in Wilcox that can take out the considerable minutes in the rotation from Jeffries if Jared even stays.       We got ourselves a much needed pure SG instead of Q being our starting SG when he is a SF. We can trade Jeffries - our only long term contract unfortunately and traded away dead weight expiring contracts in Rose and James to get Rose and Wilcox. If we trade Curry Walsh has done what seemed to be impossible and that was turn around the Knicks salary cap woes in less than a year. Completely is turning around Isaih Thomas and his mess around as we speak.

20090219114756AALkRe1	Sports;Football (American)	Is Asomugha worth being paid the most EVER per year by a cornerback?	3 years for $45+million      I think its a little risky putting that much stock in a player that before last year was an unknown in the league operating primarily as a nickelback.      That being said, I think he is well worth it and the best cornerback in the league.  I remember doing a franchise on Madden during the 2007 season and he was on my team.  He started off as like a 70 something and ended up a 99.  Obviously, this is not how the experts spot talent, but its no fluke, either.  From what I have been able to see of him (only a couple games, I live on the East Coast), he is a true ballhawk; he doesnt have breathtaking speed, amazing ups or monsterous hits, but he does know how to be in the right place at the right time.  He reminds me of an Ed Reed with Cornerback agility/speed/skills.  I think he will be a shutdown corner for many years to come.  You?

I really like the park though so I'm looking to get a really small, flexible park board for next season.       Couple things you might want to know, you don't have to read this if you don't feel like it:   - I'm pretty small (150-151cm, ~107lbs) so I was thinking something in the lower or mid 130s.     - I'd really prefer if the graphics were the least girly ever, but, you know, that's not what it's all about.   - Even if it's a kids board, lol, it's all good. Like I said, it's not about that, I just want a sick board.   - Price range is really whatever, I'll be working for awhile by the time it comes time to buy it and I'd be willing to spend extra cash for extra quality.      So if you could recommend anything, that'd be awesome. Thanks!

Orton and will now face Edge at Wrestlemania. Beth Phoenix also became the new Womens Champion.      GM Paul Heyman comes out and welcomes the new World champion, Edge out to the ring. Edge says hes always been waiting for this title and has finally caught it. Edge says that spear off the Cell nearly took his life and in the end, he leaves as World Champ. RVD then comes out and says that he has a rematch clause and would like to use it at Wrestlemania. Y2J then comes out to the ring and says that he is only going to face 1 of them at wrestlemania in a singles match. Heyman then says that it will be tonight, WHC Edge vs RVD!      Match 1. Money In The Bank qualifying match-    Evan Bourne vs Chavo Guerrero      Backstage WHC Edge is with Paul Heyman. Edge asks Heyman if hes crazy or not to put his title on the line after winning it just 4 days ago. Heyman says RVD has signed a rematch contract if he loses the title so Heyman cant do anything about it.      Match 2. MVP vs Mark Henry      RVD Is at the parking lot and tells his partner, Randy Orton to help him win back the World Title. Orton says he will not only help him win it but he will punt the hell out of Edge for being a traitor.      Match 3. Money In the Bank Qualifying match- Rey Mysterio vs The Miz w/Morrison in his corner      John Cena walks to Heyman's office but then CM Punk comes up to Cena and tells him that last week he got lucky and escaped the cage. But tonight, Hes not going to escape at a match with him.      Match 4. John Cena vs CM Punk- No Holds Barred      WAR's Tag Champs APA are backstage with Heyman. Heyman says tonight WAR's tag team champions will take on Deathzone's Dudley Boys      Match 5. Dudley boys vs APA      Match 6. I choose the winner because of storyline purposes-   World Title- Edge vs RVD   This match ends in DQ after Randy Orton comes out and gives Edge an RKO after he tried to spear RVD. Then RVD was argueing with orton and Orton gives another RKO on RVD. Orton has betrayed the alliance and leaves RVD in the ring.      Rate the show
