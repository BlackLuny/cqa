I don't get it.      So scam? Real? Shall I try it anyway and ask for refund if it does not work? Thanks for your honest feedback.

It seems like a simple question but no one can give me a good answer.      Does the fact that I recieved a stimulus check last in 2008 have any affect on my taxes when I do them this tax season? Do I get taxed on it? Do I have to claim it? Do I have to pay it back?

At that time the house appraised at 250,000.  We owe $223,000 between 1st and 2nd, with interest rate on 2nd >11%.  Our home now appraises for <180,000!  We have never been behind.  Do we have any options to get mortgage in line with value? Or are we once again part of the "screwed" class that will never get relief?

20090222111551AAMKIvq	Business & Finance;Small Business	Im young and need help with a small buiseness?	Ok so i heard about this site called cafe press and basically what i have been seeing so far is what you do is you open a shop for free. Then you pick out what items you want to put your designs on tshirts and stuff.   The item you choose though allready has a set price and you put a markup price on the item and thats the amount of money you make for each shirt sold.      So basically what im asking is would this seem like a good idea for something to do in my free time at night to make a little extra cash or would it be to difficult?  Thank you for reading

I have basically been writing checks on the credit line to pay my rent, etc. and to pay minimums on the credit cards.  I have decided to stop doing that.  However, I have been unemployed for a long time and have no assets.  I have seen advice on Yahoo Answers telling people to call the credit card company if they can't pay.  But I am assuming this advice is for people that have an income that can try to make payment arrangements.  I have no income.  Should I still call them?  Or would it be pointless since I have no income and no assets?  Will I just have to not pay and let it default?

I sent a letter to Equifax and they said that they didn't maintain my file and I had to resolve it with 'CSC Credit Services'.  I sent all the info to CSC around Feb 1 and am still waiting for a response.  How could one of the bureaus not report ANY of my information, while the other two do?  I've been denied credit before by creditors that pulled my Equifax report, and now I know why and am quite livid about it.  Anybody else have an issue like this?  Thank you.

20090222102154AAAsnCs	Business & Finance;Renting & Real Estate	Home Value Crisis, (military) What do we do?	I am hoping you can offer some help regarding our current situation. Let me preface this by saying that we are active duty military and are forced to move at other's discretion. We bought our current home a little over a year ago in the Phoenix metro area. We were given orders to relocate and we did not want to lose money on renting a home, so we bought the cheapest house (a short-sale) we could find that would accommodate our family of 6. Now, we are facing orders to move again, soon. We purchased our home for about 200,000 and current market conditions place our current value around 35-40% less than what we owe. We have no problems making our payments, we budgeted well and did not buy beyond our means. However, what can we do? We do not have 70-80,000 to bring to the table if we sell for less than our home is worth. We are considering, when the time comes for us to move, to try a short-sale or let the property go into foreclosure. We are hoping since my name in not on the loan, only my husband's credit will be affected and we can still purchase another home. Do you have any suggestions for individuals in this specific situation?

Ok, I got pre-qualified for an FHA 203k loan. The house I put my offer in is for 74k, its a 1900's two family mill style house. It needs a good amount of work, my gf's dad is a very skilled home renovator, its what he does as a job, Im not sure what he has for licenses, but in his career he has been: a realtor, a home inspector, a licensed electrician, a licensed plumber, and a few other things. He now just works with another guy flipping houses. Hes going to be doing all of our work for us. He estimated the house needs about 35k to make it beautiful and functional. If he isnt licensed, can he still submit that estimate to FHA, or are they going to send down their own people to take estimates, etc... I dont really know too much of what needs to be done next.

20090222122555AAgpqVw	Business & Finance;Small Business	I need a manufacturer that will produce less than 1000?	Okay, so I'm opening up an online store.   I've been designing since I was about six or seven years old and it is my dream to become a fashion designer. The only problem that is holding me back, is that manufacturing companies only produce 1000 minimum per item. That is way too many products to be starting out with as a beginner. I was wondering if anyone knows of a small manufacturing company, maybe family owned, that will produce just the amount I need.   Thank you!      Also, how would I hire employees?   I would like just a few to help me manage my company/store.

When my family asks me what do you want to be when you get older, and i say an automotive technician, they laugh and say you should become a doctor or something, And that automotive technician is just a better word for mechanic, kind of like garbage man and sanitation worker. Is there a difference??? And if there is, on average how much does both get paid a year, And if i do decide to become an automotive technician, how many years of school do i have to go to. I also want to open up my own shop, instead of working for a car dealership, do you think this is better???
